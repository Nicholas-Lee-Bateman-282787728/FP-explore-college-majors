1274112,5,B00003CXMG,"I saw an advance screening of this film and I just can't say enough good  things about it. It is close to  flawless.
  As usual, Crowe's gotten a superb ensemble cast  together. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Lee, and Billy  Crudup are predictably great, but the real joy is newcomer Patrick  Fugit, whose winsome, innocent portrayal  of a  teen coming of age is pitch perfect.
  The  plot is gripping and unpredictable. The subject matter is intimately  familiar for anyone over the age of  25 or so,  but younger folks will also identify with the characters' love for  music.
  But the real strength, as with all  of Crowe's work, is the *writing*. Good writing is rare in movies of any  sort,  particularly this summer's blockbuster  sludge, but Crowe nails all the details of dialogue, characterization,  and pacing with unparalleled skill. You will laugh  out loud, repeatedly, and cry too, many times simultaneously.  Every time he makes a film he renews my faith in the  medium.
  I'm not one to gush over films,  usually, but this touching, honest gem is worth losing the cynicism for a  while.  I consider it a life preserver thrown  to save me from the Perfect Storm that rages over Hollywood.",968544000,2,1202,4.797029702970297

1274843,5,B00003CXMG,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Anyone who was there will notice that this film captures almost perfectly what it was like when the music appeared. I was on stage with Led Zeppelin, Johnny Winter, etc. I could never convey the excitement and love of this era's music but this film absolutely delivered Thank you Cameron for taking the time and effort to portray this PERFECT time of life. We were special, gifted, enlightened to be able to experience these events.

The music clips were absolutely capturing the element of life as a teen in 1973. God Bless everyone who was involved with this film, I have never seen anything like this that took me back to when I was this young. I feel so forlorn that life is so different now given the musical options we have and rarely listen to anything now. Sigh.

High recommend for those who were there, for those who wanted to be there, and for those who have no clue what it was like then. I feel so sorry for anyone who missed this era. Thank GOD I was!",1493078400,15,1007,4.403225806451613

1274847,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous is one of those few magical movies for me. Every shot is perfect to me. The film just has a certain energy about it. It goes beyond the great writing, acting, performances and directing and becomes greater than the sum of its parts. There is one memorable scene or moment after another. The nostalgia in the film goes beyond specifics as well. I think people of any age can relate to the journey from child to adulthood.",1492300800,5,434,4.506329113924051

1275430,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous is in my opinion an excellent film that was inspired by experiences that the director Cameron Crowe had when he was a teenager writing reviews for Rolling Stone Magazine,the film tells the story of a teenager who wants to be a rock journalist and his travels across the country with an upcoming band called Stillwater whom he meets while trying to get backstage at a Black Sabbath show after being given an assignment by his friend/mentor  Lester Bangs (played by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) ..In my opinion this is a damn good film the story is in an interesting one,the actors performances in it are great and if you're a fan of classic rock there is one hell of a soundtrack to boot.",1482624000,,705,4.595238095238095

I don't watch a whole lot of movies repeatedly, at least not voluntarily, but I have enthusiastically watched this one at least five times, and there will be a sixth... and seventh... and eighth. This movie takes us all on a magic carpet ride back to those less complicated times when everything was more innocent and yet, more indulgent. Sure, there is sex and drugs and rock'n'roll here. But there is also excellent character development, great writing, good music, and lots of fun. If you grew up in the 70s, enjoy. If you grew up later and always wished that you'd grown up in the 70s, enjoy. If you've secretly never grown up, enjoy. This is a road trip movie that will make you remember wistfully that once upon a time, belief in the power of music was enough to unite a generation.

Alas, for some reason we are forced to watch only the Extended version. It's not bad, but it's way too long, went into character depth I really didn't need, and it just gets to be too much of a good thing. The video quality isn't that much better than the DVD as well. If you have the original DVD don't waste your money on this release. I guess I will buy this again if they ever release the Theatrical version on blu-ray in the future.

I bought the Blu-ray for about $5 and it's a great bargain at that price. My 5-star rating is for the Blu-ray, which looks and sounds great and offers many special features. The name ""Bootleg Cut"" is just a gimmicky name referring back to the days of bootleg vinyl records - the special features are the ""bootlegs"", the behind the scenes stuff, demos, etc.",1453593600,,574,4.314814814814815

But THIS version is so much richer than the original it eclipses any memories of what I now consider 'the abridged version'.
For someone who mildly liked the original, stick with the short version.
If you too fell in love with the people, the era, and the journey in the theatrical cut, find yourself a copy of THIS cut. It is so much more of what made the original so good.
This version joins Casablanca and a select group of films I will never tire of. A great story, well told and a serendipitously perfect cast come together to create a cinema classic. (IMHO)",1448409600,2,642,4.31404958677686

For a film based on the real-life experiences of a Rolling Stone journalist, it was as shallow, trite and commercial as AM radio bubblegum hits.  Really, this film isn't even about music.  It's about celebrity and celebrity worship.  The music is merely incidental.  This cheapens and exploits the true talents of the era.  It seemed out-of-context to see posters of real artists such as Jimi Hendrix, the Allman Brothers, the Who, Led Zep, and downright offensive to hear the names of Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, Ian Anderson, Neil Young, etc.  The ""Tiny Dancer"" bus singalong was a wretchedly dumb and unbelievable low.  The only highlight:  Philip Seymour Hoffman as the rock critic Lester Bangs.

For a truly clever, trenchant and wickedly funny take on rock bands, see Spinal Tap.  Almost Famous makes me feel like saying..........get your &%# hands off my music.",1442275200,,1002,4.795321637426901

I really enjoyed this film.

Kate Hudson gives a subtle, deeply felt, complex performance, and she was worthy of her Oscar nomination. She is lovely, sympathetic, seductive, and so very charismatic.

Story of William Miller/Patrick Fugit, who is only fifteen, awkward and earnest.  He follows along with band Stillwater, who allow him on their burs, persuaded by William's passionate verbiage.  William's mother, played by the quirky Frances McDormand, is concerned and protective, especially of him.  Her daughter, Anita/Zooey Deschanel left home years ago to be a flight attendant, and has thereafter had little to no contact with her mother.

The story is touching and lovely, with a lot of well-meaning but flawed characters.  Love many of the songs.

Cameron Crowe's direction is spot on, and the story is wondrous and enrapturing.",1442275200,,1036,5.339506172839506

It is significantly longer and allows one to delve into Kate Hudson's character ""Penny Lane"" much more, and is an asset. She puts in her best performance, I think. Patrick Fugit absolutely steals the show. Cameron Crowe is a terrific American director, and this film truly bears that out. My one and only criticism is how he does the ""director's commentary"". There are too many people talking, and there are not pauses when they should. A small criticism which has nothing to do with watching the film as is.

1278863,2,B00003CXMG,"Hmmmm, Cammy, Cammy, Cammy, what were you thinking?  For someone who's been writing in the field of rock journalism for eons, couldn't you have done a better job on this mysteriously overrated project than you did?  If anyone should know better than to portray the 70s rock scene in such a milquetoast fashion, it's you!

It would take a lot longer to go through everything that's horrifically wrong with this movie than anyone would ever want to read, so I'm just going to go into the obvious low lights.  Patrick Fugit spends the entire movie generally telling us, ""Look at me, I'm AAAAAACTIIIIIING.""  Well, that's HIS opinion.  He's not even as good as some of the child actors that used to get cast on old Sid and Marty Krofft programs.  He gets to run around all over the place chasing an up and coming band full of arrogant, unwashed egomaniacs when the least he could do is pursue the bigger and more interesting acts they open for.  Ironically, while his goofy ""don't take drugs"" mommy lets him have carte blanche, his older sister isn't even allowed to bring rock albums into the house unless she sneaks them in.

Billy isn't terribly interested in anything but pretending he's big buddies with Stillwater, a mediocre band that seems to be a cross between Skynyrd and Zeppelin, and chasing Kate Hudson's character Penny Lane around.  Wow, I guess love (or something like it) is blind, because Hudson spends the entire movie looking like a cross between Drew Barrymore and Robert Plant in a mini skirt, and displaying all the intelligence of a Swiffer.

Penny, in turn, virtually stalks the crapola out of Stillwater's guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) to the point where I felt compelled to call the police on her.  The band is unbelievable, especially Jason Lee as the screaming mimi lead vocalist who thinks he's cool for no other reason than fronting a band is the only thing that keeps him from living under the bridge he looks like he crawled out from under.  The song Cammy's wife wrote for them is a Zeppelin-wannabe dungheap called ""Fever Dog.""  WHAT is a fever dog anyway?  That's not nearly as bad as when they're all sitting on the bus and apparently know all the words to Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer.""  Thanks, Cammy.  That was one of my favorite songs before I saw this.

Other low lights include the bimbos shrieking that Simon Kirke from Bad Company is outside by the hotel pool.  That's interesting since this story takes place in 1973, and Bad Company's first album didn't come out until a year later.  ""Opie must die then take out our laundry."" tied with ""I'm a golden god"" are also particularly vexing.

There are really only two highlights in this film:  Philip Seymour Hoffman's Lester Bangs portrayal, and the fact that this movie finally ended.  Geddy Lee from Rush was asked what he thought of this movie, and he said he didn't buy the band.  Well, then, he did better than me.  I couldn't buy the entire movie.  Even Bebe Buell's silly, self-centered autobiography was more believable than the two hours it took to get through this coma inducing saccharine trip, and at least she wrote about interesting people.  This movie is only interesting if you want to see Cammy show us yet again that his 45 year-old love affair with Peter Frampton (who naturally got a small part in the film) has never died.",1422057600,3,3340,4.703958691910499

The acting is excellent. Everyone does a fine job of portraying their character. Frances McDormand as the anxious, single mother totally nails it. And of course, Patrick Raymond Fugit as William, the eager young journalist, is totally believable. (Why did it take 14 years for him to make it back to a box-office hit?)

1279083,2,B00003CXMG,"This has aged poorly. Once touted as a great movie, I watched this again the other night and was struck by how lame it is. The central character, the teenaged Rolling Stone writer, is a very boring actor. And his unrequited love for the Kate Hudson groupie character is all schmaltz. Billy Crudup's rock star character has retained its style the best over the past 14 years.
But the worst aspect of the whole movie is the central conceit that a rock star could effectively get a story in Rolling Stone killed by simply denying his quotes to the staff fact-checker. That would never happen in real life, never mind the current Rolling Stone brouhaha over the false UVA rape story that got by its current fact-checkers.
The sound track is the best thing about this film, but even that could have been better with a few more classics.

The story of a teenage boy who yearns to be a music journalist, this is a cut above many coming of age films, not at all giddy, but funny as heck. Our hero cons Rolling Stone into hiring him, sight unseen, to do a road trip piece on an up and coming band. He gets in so over his head that he's almost overwhelmed, but he figures out a lot about how people and the world operate. You get your adventure story, love story, music history, and a terrific, TERRIFIC sound track that doesnt interfere, it enhances.

Kate Hudson is pitch perfect and has all of the nuance of this experience exactly right. I grew up on the road and saw all of this ten times over, there is nothing happening in this film that hasn't happened. But what is so magical, and magic is precisely the right word, is how transcendent this experience is, how filled with love and deep transformation. Only someone who loved rock and roll and was really a pert of that family could write and direct and create this. Could know it so intimately and know that he was home. You see hack after hack trying to write about rock and roll and they put in the drugs and sex and decadence, but it always misses the mark completely. It's always a callow attempt full of cliches from people who were not there or don't get it. The whole dynamic of Lester Bangs and William is excruciatingly perfect.

1279761,5,B00003CXMG,"Warning slight spoiler in this review.

Great acting, a clever and original story, and many quirky characters that you can't help but love. what more can you expect from a movie? As a bonus, you pick up a few nuggets of pop psychology to chew on along the way.

Great movies need great moments that grab you as they happen, and this one has several. For example, listen for Elton John's song ""Tiny Dancer"" and savor the moments that accompany it. Another great moment occurs near the end of the movie. and this one is really great. where one of the characters suddenly finds himself somewhere else entirely that where he thought he was going. You can see it in his face, and live the moment with him,  as emotions flow from anticipation, to confusion, bewilderment, dawning realization, awe..

I suspect the movie works so well because it was based on the actual experiences of Writer/Director Cameron Crowe as a music reporter. The music tract by his wife, Nancy Wilson (member of the band 'Heart'), certainly helps the experience along.

For some reason, the movie turned out not to be a big box office success... one of those things about life that I may never understand.",1399075200,,1175,4.684466019417476

In character, Hoffman regales his wisdom to a neophyte writer; ""The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what we share with someone else when we're uncool"". Ironically, Lester Bangs died of an overdose at age 33. Phil followed him in the same manner at age 46.

The original theatrical release version is a great movie in itself. However, the extended ""The Bootleg Cut"" version is a masterpiece! Although I haven't done a scene by scene comparison to detail every difference between the two versions, I can only say that the ""The Bootleg Cut"" feels like it is complete. This, in my opinion, is Cameron Crowe's crowning achievement as well as one of the greatest rock n' roll movies of all time ( This Is Spinal Tap, The Last Waltz, Jailhouse Rock, etc. ).

The Blu-ray is great. It's packed with more bonus features than you can shake a stick at....it's loaded with tons of cool stuff.

Released on September 15th, two thousand, Almost Famous is written and directed by Cameron Crowe (who also wrote Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Jerry Maguire and Say Anything). The film stars Patrick Fugit (although oddly Billy Cruddup gets top billing in the theatrical credits), as a fifteen year old kid, in the 1970s, who gets a job at Rolling Stone to interview the up and coming (fictional) band Stillwater and follow them on the road, for a plethora of adventures.
The film is fun, serious, honest and realistic without ever getting too dark in tone. I feel that it was also the progenitor for the dramady resurgence/renaissance that has occurred in later/recent years with films such as Juno, Little Miss Sunshine, Ruby Sparks, United States of Tara, Lars and the real girl, Kings of Summer, etc.
Thats what I love about it too, its a fun, mostly happy film that also isn't afraid to be honest about life. So, what do you think of Almost Famous? Who are some of your favorite 70s musicians? Comment below and let me know.",1393977600,,1242,4.75462962962963

1280042,4,B00003CXMG,"Californian William Miller is 11 and naked in the school shower when his classmates rip into him about his lack of pubes. He quickly discovers two things  - he needs to grow up fast - and he has a gift for getting out of jams by convoluting the truth (like all the best writers do). And this is before he has to deal with his overbearing potty mother who seems obsessed with him not doing anything - let alone having promiscuous sex and copious amounts of hallucinogenic drugs (what a meanie).

Then one afternoon in hair-curlers and to the backdrop of Simon & Garfunkel's ""America"" his older sister Anita has finally had enough of `no' Mum and exits the nest (dialogue above) leaving young William a parting gift that will shape his whole life - a carry bag full of vinyl albums under his bed. Inside is - Crosby, Stills & Nash's self-titled debut from 1969 on Atlantic, The Rolling Stones ""Get Your Ya Ya's Out"" (1970), Led Zeppelin's ""II"" (1969), Joni Mitchell's ""Blue"" (1971) and The Who's double ""Tommy"". Lighting a candle as instructed by sis (an early part for the gorgeous Zooey Deschanel) - William puts the needle down on the original 1969 US Decca vinyl of The Who and is transformed...

Written and Directed by Cameron Crowe - ""Almost Famous"" (2000) is his homage to Rock and a touchstone for suckers like me. I know all the references - all the feelings - all the inexplicably gorgeous women way out of your desert-boots reach. Why - because like so many of my generation - I lived it. And like many of us Crowe also seems to feel that something changed between 1973 and 1975 - Rock 'n' Roll somehow died and got replaced with pomposity and drugs and dumb Rock Stars as Gods who had no answers anymore - corrupted by a hard in their pants and an itch in their arms...

Sporting a fantastic ensemble group of actors - soppy-faced Patrick Fugit (as William) does well to keep up with Kate Hudson, Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, Noah Taylor, Anna Paquin, Fairuza Balk and Frances McDormand. But you also forget just how good Philip Seymour Hoffman was (even then). He plays Rock Critic Lester Bangs with a relish and character accuracy that is astonishing. As he eyes with horrified insider knowledge the naivety of the now 15-year old William hustling for a career in Rock journalism - Lester correctly surmises that the icons William loves so much will eat him up and spit him out a truly sullied being. But the kid is just so damn earnest...so Lester tells him ""to be honest and unmerciful..."" and hopes he'll survive a tour with rising rock band Stillwater who are supporting Black Sabbath on a US tour. Cue tour bus rides with paperbacks of Ray Bradbury, Circle magazine, sexy girls with long flowing hair boogieing to The Allman Brothers and the most fantastic use of an Elton John song in any movie - ever (""Tiny Dancer"" from 1971's ""Madman Across The Water""). There follows spaced-out DJs, dodgy promoters, electrified mike stands, trashed hotel rooms, Rolling Stone magazine deadlines, band squabbles and his ever-present mother phoning about drugs every ten minutes (and she'd be right too). There's even an early but memorable cameo from Modern Family's Eric Stonestreet as Sheldon The Hotel Desk Clerk (he gets about 4 lines)...

The BLU RAY picture quality is lovely (if not unremarkable) throughout and at 1.85:1 aspect ratio - fills the entire screen. Audio is English TrueHD 5.1 while Subtitles include Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, English For The Hard Of Hearing, English, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Korean, Mandarin, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish (Latin American), Thai and Turkish. But the two extras are a major let down - ""Love Comes And Goes"" features the cast goofing about on sets without any dialogue to camera which is awkward and uninformative (although Nancy Wilson's demo of the rock song ""Love Comes And Goes"" is great) - while the ""Lester Bangs Interview"" features the real Creem Magazine writer in archive footage bitching about the vacuous nature of Bryan Ferry and ELP (it's good but last mere minutes - not enough of it).

It should also be noted that this BLU RAY features only the half-hour more 'Extended Cut' of the film (2000 DVD has the original film at 122 minutes). It would have been better to include both versions - but at least the longer 'Director's Cut' does feature material that expands the fictional band's relationship with their fans and more of William's coming-of-age - and it genuinely adds rather than detracts.

True - the album date lines are a bit screwed about with and careful scrutiny will reveal continuity problems - but none of that stops ""Almost Famous"" being magical to someone like me. And as you sit there - marvelling at just how truly gorgeous Led Zeppelin's acoustic ""That's The Way"" from ""III"" is - you're transported to a time when music could change the world and expand your horizons and record shops were places you stood in shaking with excitement at what new thrill you would find...

""Now's the time to look again..."" Robert Plant sings on that lovely song (Track 3 on Side 2).
Turns out that even in 1970 - one of Blighty's best ever singers was right...

PS: Crowe went on to make the equally wonderful music-laden ""Elizabethtown"" in 2005.",1392854400,,5281,4.781798245614035

1280127,3,B00003CXMG,"If you are a fan of Rock (not rock and roll, that is the 60's) and came of age in the 70's, as I did, this is a film for you. It has some the great songs of the era, and is an earnest look at a (fake?) band of the '70's trying to make in the Rolling Stone, arena rock days. It focuses on that band, a nascent rock journalist (still in high school) and a ""band-aid"" (super groupie) who loves both the band (especially its superstar guitarist) and the young journalist. I sought it out, as it was on my list for a long time, and the death of the great Philip Seymour Hoffman gave me an excuse to watch it. It is a good film. Surprisingly, it feels overlong in places. I say surprising, because there is a Director's Cut version that I have not seen that is actually nearly 30 minutes longer and available on Blu-ray. Maybe the longer version actually flows better and feels less episodic. I like Cameron Crowe's films, and I would recommend this film based on that, although first I would say Jerry Maguire and, especially, Say Anything, are more essential viewing. Again, this is surprising, because the film is at least semi-autobiographical. Crowe began as a rock journalist. The performances are no better than good in most cases. The most overrated is that of Kate Hudson as the band-aid. She actually received an Oscar nomination for her performance. Billy Crudup is better as the guitarist. Frances McDormand and, especially, Mr. Hoffman steal the (too few) scenes in which they appear. I am going to rent the longer version to see if there are more of their respective performances saved from the cutting room floor. Maybe you will soon hear me recommend the 162 minute version over this 123 minute theatrical version.",1391644800,,1724,4.564516129032258

1280405,5,B00003CXMG,"I have few perfect movies in my collection and this is one of the rare ones. Probably due to the fact that I grew up during the time period in question (1973.) The story revolves around a young teenager's passion for music and writing and the behind-the-scenes dynamics of his family. His dreams finally materialize when he's given a chance to interview Black Sabbath. It's from that point the story unfolds in all its 70's splendor. Cameron Crowe's writing and directing was near flawless. Kate Hudson made for a memorable Penny Lane, Phillip Seymour Hoffman hit it out-of-the-park as Lester Bangs, Patrick Fugit brought the right amount of naivity as William Miller, and Frances MacDormand totally owned the role as William's strict analytical but loving mother Elaine. Billy Crudup and Jason Lee as members of Stillwater nailed it as rockers (and believe me, I interviewed my share in the late 70's.) Although now divorced, Mr. Crowe's then wife, Nancy Wilson, helped with the musical score, which makes me one degree from Cameron. In 1978, I sat in on our station's interview with Heart. The album ""Dog and Butterfly"" had just come out. I remember Nancy being so out-of-it that all she could do was chortle in that high-pitched laugh of hers.

It invoked a lot of nostalgia on my part because I identified with Patrick Fugit's character growing up. It was all about the music. Been radio for 36 years, met the groups, partied back stage, hung out with the groupies, and conversed with the writers. I'm not going to get into color saturation and sound so I can drive home a point here - I was so immersed in the movie that it didn't matter. Could care less. Most movies out of Hollyweird these days invest more in the ""look"" of the movie instead of a well-crafted script.

So much so I repurchased it on Blu Ray both for the added clarity and the 30 minutes or so additional footage of the ""Directors"" Cut. I do have a few issues with the extended version. Without going into a scene-by-scene comparison there are many lines added into the middle of the scenes, additional scenes, and in some cases I believe a few lines edited out so that it gave me(who's watched this movie at least 5 or 6 times previously) the feeling that the film was closer to 50% ""new"". I'm not sure I like the ""Directors Cut"" version better, so since it unfortunately isn't included on the BluRay I would strongly encourage people to hang onto their original DVD copies. Sometimes giving the Director license to expand on a film that was already 2 hours long just shows why the film was edited down for succinctness in the first place. Not sorry I purchased it by any means but know you're getting a fairly distinct, different cut that to me doesn't better the original.",1371427200,2,1016,4.4972972972972975

1280471,5,B00003CXMG,"The bargain-rack movie for last night was ""Almost Famous"" (Widescreen Edition) starring Kate Hudson and Billy Crudup. I found it in the five-dollar  bin at a nearby Wal-Mart. It was well worth the cost. Good movie. I've been a Rock 'n' Roll ever since the genre came into existence in the mid-fifties. Plus, for me, that was just about the time of leaving the nest. This story is a multi-layered account of a family where the children are in the process of leaving the nest. First to go is the young daughter who becomes a flight attendant. The second departure is by the young son who is interested in being a Rock and Roll reporter. It's a coming of age  time and the main story concerns the son who gets tied up with a tour of Stillwater, a rising band in need of good press. Of course there are Band Aides (most of us would call them Groupies) and it's party, party, party with the son's nervous and protective mother following every move, albeit at a distance. It's a fun story, and very well put  together. If you've ever wondered what it might be like to be on the inside of a rock 'n' roll tour, well, this is probably as close as most of you will ever get.

The movie is well put together.  It seems overly long, but I can't recognize anything that needs to be cut. The photography is excellent. The soundtrack is a wonderful rock and roll collage that would fall into the ""oldies but goodies"" category. The flow of the story is quite good. The acting is well done and I especially appreciated Kate Hudson, one of the tender young Band Aides. It's a fun and uplifting movie. If you like rock and roll, you should love this one. Be sure to look over the included extra materials as they add a lot to the telling of the story.

1280531,5,B00003CXMG,"I love this movie!  This has become my favorite movie!  In fact, Rolling Stone magazine brought me here.  I love the music in it and I love that it is all about the music.

I am an avid reader of Rolling Stone magazine and often check their website--by often I mean everyday--and saw one of their lists.  The list was the Top Thirty Rock 'N' Roll Movies, and Almost Famous was number three.  I then saw another list entitled, Top Ten Music Movie Moments at number eleven with the ""Tiny Dancer"" scene.  After reading about it, it made me really want to see it.  So, I can really say that, Rolling Stone magazine made me want to see it.

The movie is about fifteen-year-old, William Miller (Patrick Fugit), who is an aspiring music journalist, and lives with his overprotective mother.  William starts out covering a Black Sabbath concert for Creem magazine, asigned to him by editor and mentor, Lester Bangs, when he meets Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) and ""Band Aids"" (a.k.a. groupies who care about music) and the up-and-coming band, Stillwater.  William covers the concert and interviews the band, when a few days later, he is called up by Rolling Stone to do a editorial on the band.  William ends up going on tour with Stillwater, as well as Penny Lane and the rest of the Band Aids, and witnesses the ups and the downs of this up-and-coming rock band.

This movie has by far become one of my all-time favorite movies.  I love the story--and how it's pretty much a fictionalized memoir of writer/director Cameron Crowe's experiance of writing for Rolling Stone when he was seventeen--I really enjoy it everytime I watch it.  I have literally watched it everyday for a week, or two (but who's counting?).  It's a must-see for any music or Rolling Stone fans, even for future journalists.  I loved it so much, that I downloaded it on my Kindle (which is something I don't normally do, if that says anything).

The only thing I would say bad about it is, is there are some questions about some of the characters that could've been answered (like, Penny Lane for example, what made her become a Band Aide, those kinds of questions), which from my understanding, is answered in the ""Untitiled"" Bootleg edition (I only have the regular DVD and Amazon Digital Download).

I hope my review was helpful, and made you want to see it, like Rolling Stone did for me.  This is a must see, and you will not be wasting your money, it's worth it!  Rock on!",1364169600,2,2439,4.586605080831409
1280532,5,B00003CXMG,"It is the innocence amongst the squalor, when music and lust and chasing the dream drove bands -- and the girls who loved them. Long before name brand-checking, business people worried about back-ends and music vetted by committee, there was a Garden of Eden period for rock & roll.
It was during that time that Cameron Crowe became ROLLING STONE's youngest writer. And in ""Almost Famous,"" William Miller shows us the things that the Oscar-winning director/screenwriter saw. The struggle, the patched together nature of scratching at the ceiling of success, the business that is necessary and the glory of that moment of breaking through are all here, as well as misassigned loves, romances that're more about the moment than the heart and how one great romantic's broken heart causes a reckoning for the hero, the writer and the girl herself.
Some of the greatest lines about life and rock & roll ever delivered. Some of the sweetest undercurrent points that would be overlooked by most. Some of the hope that makes rock music more than sheer nihilism. Completely worth watching, if only to understand why once upon a time this music mattered so much.",1364169600,,1152,4.943298969072165
1280533,1,B00003CXMG,"The only thing more undeveloped than the kid are the characters.  Aside from Philip Seymour Hoffman, who infuses life into every role he plays, these people were as interesting and compelling as a sack of hair.  The mom teaches something about the collective unconscious in college and yet thinks rock and roll is dangerous and evil?  The word Incongruous comes to mind.  And why is the mom, who banned her daughter from listening to Simon and Garfunkel of all things, allowing her son to skip school and join the tour bus?  How does that make any sense?  And Kate Hudson?  Vacuous as always.  Has she run away from home?  What is she doing on this tour?  She's one step away from the cheerleading squad which is fifty steps too far from a typical bus groupie at age 16.

The movie started by being cute - a young kid gets a shot to do what all young, aspiring journalists want to do; interview the bands.  After that first shot of cute, the entire movie tries to ride it out for 2 hours.  I made it through one.  The reason this scenario is interesting is because it's potentially dangerous.  The only dangerous aspect of this rock and roll adventure was its bold and unceasing boredom.  Conversations that went nowhere, drug use that never materialized, the whole rock and roll fantasy here is about as adrenalin worthy as a tumbleweed blowing across state lines.  Hanging out with a band is nearly every kid's dream but this dream is, at best, slightly more interesting than trigonometry homework, if only because he's on a bus.",1363737600,8,1531,4.611111111111111

1280568,4,B00003CXMG,"First of all, I want to commend this movie for its historical accuracy. _Almost Famous_ mostly takes place in 1973, and all the music is from 1973 or earlier.

Kate Hudson does a standout job as the ""band-aid."" She follows the band around because she is a fan. She also a charming relationship with the main character. Hudson's character is convincing and lovable, in spite of her obvious issues.

Patrick Fugit does a great job as the teenage lead. He is based largely on the real life of Cameron Crowe, who also went on the road with the Allman Brothers as a teen.

One can tell that Crowe care deeply about this film. It shows throughout. It seems that this film comes from Crowe's own longing to be cool. You won, Cameron Crowe--you made a cool movie.

This also features an early role for Zooey Deschanel. She is charming as always.

Frances McDormand does a great job as a the uptight, overprotective mother.

1280575,5,B00003CXMG,"I came of age in the early Seventies.  Long hair.  Bell bottoms.  Sex.  Drugs.  And rock 'n roll.  And Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical ALMOST FAMOUS captures this extraordinary time, when rock bands and their groupies explored communal love and carnal desires in tour buses and flea-bitten motels.  This film is a coming of age tale for 15-year-old William Miller (Patrick Fugit), a talented teen who gets a once-in-a-lifetime gig from 'Rolling Stone' magazine to cover the up-and-coming band Stillwater as the group embarks on a national tour.  Stillwater is led by lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup is sensational), a mega-diva who feels his considerable talents are wasted with his bandmates, and who keeps putting off interviews with the hero-worshipping William.  Yet the band is smart enough to allow William into their midst to befriend him--a strategy the members hope will result in a glowing article; and this midst includes the traveling groupies, including Russell's favorite, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).  William becomes smitten with this flower child, and accordingly, comes to resent Russell's callous treatment of her.

The interactions of the band, their fans, and William's eye-popping observations of all that transpire, are as believable as they are hysterical.  And during this journey, William is mentored by a cynical publisher (Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a terrific performance) and his progressive, yet overbearing mother (Frances McDormand ain't bad, either).  Over the course of three breathless weeks, William experiences love, euphoria, disappointment, and angst; for this teen, it's a life-altering experience.  Yet for Stillwater--in particular, Russell Hammond--their lives are forever altered, too.  And this tour causes Penny to do some serious soul searching of her own.  The music is terrific, the interactions totally credible, and the comedy flaunts a distinct, hard edge.  If you never got to experience the Seventies, ALMOST FAMOUS is one of the best ways to see for yourself how we old geezers used to get our grooves on.

Though I have had a PS3 for a number of years I never bought a Blu-Ray because I switched over to digital downloads a while back and now having this one disc is another thing for me to keep track of and who knows maybe it would be worth it.  Why do I care about seeing a band movie in HD?
But I looked into it and read some reviews that really changed my mind.  I loved the original but it did feel like it was missing some stuff to make it really great.
This Bootleg Edition fixes that and makes the movie amazing.
Cleans up scenes and plot points for you to really understand how things developed.  More scenes on William feeling out of place with his peers in school.  There is an awkward shower scene that would make any feel sorry for the kid (but its still funny).  Expands a lot on Russell and Penny's story and Penny's story overall.  Also the small cameo that Jimmy Fallon got in the original edition is expanded so you like that character more.  One of the best added scenes was the expanded walk into Rolling Stones at the end.  Walking down the hallway with everyone shocked that William is so young.
Sadly they didn't add the Stairway to Heaven scene into the movie but I guess getting the rights was too much or a pain or something.

Overall: If you thought the original was good you will love the extended edition and if you thought the original was missing stuff then watch this and you will discover why so many love this film.",1360281600,,1484,4.28673835125448

So thank you Amazon for putting EXACTLY the SAME product reviews for this one disc bluray version as the three disc bluray version as well as having a misleading product description.

As far as the original, theatrical release I would give it an A+.  It was an amazing movie and that's why I wanted to have it on bluray since the dvd version I had got lost or was never returned to me.  As far as the director's cut, it has over 30 mins of extra movie time and I love that, but it's a different movie with the added scenes.

The rest of the cast was spectacular. The ending is such a bittersweet ending. It is cathartic experience if you are a fan of rock n roll and the lifestyle that is associated with it. I really, really liked how there was not too much drug use, there was drug use, but not the type that caused unrepairable damage like suicide or some rock n roll cliche that turns characters against each other.",1356912000,,567,4.514563106796117

My questions never bothered me for not getting answered, but then came the blu-ray edition with the director's cut on it.  I immediately bought this movie and watched the very awesome director's cut and all my questions were answered.  I'm very glad I can watch both versions, but I definitely prefer the director's cut over the original.  I wish they would show the director's cut on cable so others can enjoy it as much as I did.

The story takes place in 1973, when real music ruled the world and people turned their love for it into a lifestyle. It's a life I've often fantasized about myself, and I know I'm not alone there. Almost Famous follows 15-year old rock journalist William whose dreams come true when he is asked by Rolling Stone to go on tour with the fictional band Stillwater and write a piece about them.

William, the band, and their faithful Band-Aids go through a multitude of emotions over the course of the film.

I just felt so GOOD after watching this movie, it made me feel so happy and just glad to be alive. I immediately connected with the character of William and related to him very easily. Throughout the film we take this journey with him, and Cameron Crowe presents the film in such a way that it feels as if we are taking the journey with him. There were times when I laughed out loud, and cried. But in the end I just felt so good, and I was completely full of joy and warmth from this movie. Everyone should see this, especially teenagers between 13-15. Who cares if it's Rated R, it'll get them ready for life!

THIS SUCKS. It's been an ""exclusive"" at Best Buy for months, and I got it there because the deliberately misleading package says this disc ""includes"" the extended cut. ""Includes""? You mean FEATURES! ""Includes"" means IN ADDITION to something else, presumably the original cut. As there was no specific mention of the original cut on the package, I kind of expected that it was not also ""included"", but it still irked me to have that confirmed when I got home.

As I said in the review title, in another year or two you can definitely expect an ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" or some such, containing both films (as well as, probably, the 6-song Stillwater EP that came with the DVD release of ""Untitled"" -- which, ahem, DID ""include"" the original film as well).

Then, when the extended ""Untitled, Bootleg Cut"" came out, with both the theatrical version and extended version of the movie, I bought it. However, the DTS soundtrack that accompanied the theatrical version of ""Almost Famous"" was not included on the extended version.

Now, I have the best of both worlds: An absolutely gorgeous Blu-ray version of the extended ""Almost Famous"" movie with a terrific English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. Apparently, Paramount has given an exclusive initial distribution deal for the Blu-ray version of the ""Bootleg Cut"" to a large retail chain store. I have posted a cover picture that shows where to buy this disk for, as of this writing, half the list price.

I have been reading reviews of the previous extended version of ""Almost Famous"" with great interest. It seems that some people who hated the original theatrical version of the movie thought that the extended director's edition might appeal to them. It didn't.

Decided to risk getting this version from Best Buy (pretty cheap) hoping Dreamworks did a better job than the import did. Boy, did they ever!! This is one fantastic looking and sounding blu-ray! The colors really shine in this hi-def release. The DTS-HD audio really kicks in during the concert footage with plenty of bass. Very glad to see this finally get released in hi-def here in the states, wonder why it took so long? This blows away the drab looking DVD of this cut of the film (originally called Bootleg) with the visuals and sound. This is well worth the upgrade! Don't understand why it seems only a few people are selling it on Amazon. Got mine at Best Buy for well under 20 bucks...and its worth it!!

1281041,3,B00003CXMG,"REVIEW OF THE UK BLU-RAY IMPORT -- ""Almost Famous"" is a terrific movie that plays almost like a fan's love-letter to Rock N'Roll - this and ""High Fidelity"" are probably two of the best films that will remind you of why you love rock music so much (and both rank in my personal favorites for both films of the last 10 years or so, as well as rock n roll films).  I'll assume that if you've searched for ""Almost Famous""'s Blu-Ray version, you're probably already familiar with the movie (and like me, might be looking to upgrade), so i'll cut to the chase on the Blu-Ray version:  Overall, it's a good transfer, though i don't know that i'd say it's a spectacular transfer to the point of being revelatory in the visual sense.  The version of the film presented here is the 'Untitled' cut, which runs around 2 hours 40 min or so, and sound quality is very good.  This pressing is actually a UK pressing, though (as i learned) there doesn't seem to be regional-coding protections on Blu-Ray (as there are on DVD's) and this disc played fine in my US machine (no artifacts, etc).  There are very few extras: only a 2 minute Lester Bangs interview plus around 10 min of table readings/set rehearsal footage.  So if you popped for the 2 DVD/1CD ""Almost Famous"" so-called 'bootleg' edition, i'd recommend hanging onto that set (which is now out of print, i believe), if only for the extras, the audio CD, etc.  Overall, i guess i'm happy to have it on Blu-Ray, though the skimpy extras and the almost-negligible improvement in picture quality somewhat temper my satisfaction with this purchase.",1270944000,4,1587,4.6263345195729535

1281116,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous is the world of early 70's Rock `n' Roll when that first flash of the classic rock era had passed. Rock was settling into becoming a business, but still was young enough and still had a sense of innocence about itself that William Miller (Patrick Fugit) an overachieving, yet awkward teenager can be taken seriously as a rock writer, and be assigned by Rolling Stone to tour with and write about an up and coming band. Almost Famous is also my story. An innocent drawn to a world that looks glamorous to him and where he thinks and he'll be cool. It's the story of everyone's innocence of their teenage years.

Almost Famous is based on writer/director Cameron Crowe's own experiences. William wants to fit in and his innocence is palpable and real. On his assignment from Rolling Stone to follow the fictional band Stillwater, he finds himself locked out of the Rock `n' Roll world he worships and wishes to be a part of. Even the girls his age, the Band-aids, leave him standing on the outside. The Band-aids lead by Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), don't consider themselves groupies but more like muses for the bands, but are much more learned and experienced than William . It takes the late arrival of his favorite band Stillwater to gain him access to the Rock `n' Roll world he seeks. When William walks into that first concert he is awkward, shy, doesn't know anyone or anything about that world. By the end of the concert he's so caught up in the rush and excitement, he's shouting knowing goodbyes to the bands and roadies. William seeking to be cool he tries to impress Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) by introducing him to Penny without knowing they have a history. Director Crowe really hits the nail on the head with William's feelings and experience.

William's innocence continually betrays him. When he goes to L.A. with Penny, she goes off with Russell. William follows them only to discover them making out. You can see it William's face, he's crushed. He likes Penny but doesn't think someone as glamorous and sophisticated as her would be interested in him. Russell betrays William by promising an interview that never seems to happen. Stillwater betrays William. They befriend him hoping he'll write a favorable article of them for Rolling Stone, but when Rolling Stone verifies William's truthful story, the band disavows it.

While William's innocence betrays him he never abandons it. That theme shows itself again and again during the movie. Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Lester Bangs tells William that rock is in it's death rattle since rock has started to become a business. The rock stars portrayed in Almost Famous espouse this, notably lead singer of Stillwater Jeff Beebe (Jason Lee). If one the band's fans could save the world, ""it means rock can save the world!""

Frances McDormand as William's sincerely concerned but beleagured mother who fears she`s pushing her children away, William and daughter (Zooey Deschannel) and leads to unintentionally funny moments in her life such as when she tells a group of students ""my son has been kidnapped by rock stars!"" Or that Simon and Garfunkle are poets of drugs and promiscuous sex. Jimmy Fallon is almost unrecognizable as Dennis Hope the professional manager who takes over guiding Stillwater through the hazards of Rock `n' Roll. The casting of Almost Famous lives up to the title of the movie. Almost everyone in it was on the cusp of becoming stars or at the beginning of their careers.

By the end of the tour William, who has seen and experienced more than he ever thought he could, and even understands the world better than Penny emerges with his innocence intact. He reunites his mother and sister, and when Russell shows up at William's house, William is still willing and able to get the interview from Russell that he always wanted. Even Russell and the band redeem themselves. Russell calls Rolling Stone and tells them William's story is true, and Stillwater rediscovers the innocence and joy of creating music when they step back from the high power business of Rock `n' Roll and go back to their roots of playing smaller venues.

Crowe hits all the right notes in characterization and the times. Everyone seems perfect for their roles and they're delivered with sincerity that most viewers can identify with. The 70's are realistically evoked from the burbling of a bong to a light organ in a fan's bedroom. Almost Famous has a complexity in characters and plot rarely seen in movies. It's truly a movie where everything comes to together to make a near flawlessly executed film.",1266969600,2,4603,4.857324840764331

1281226,5,B00003CXMG,"It's 1973 and William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is about to have one of the craziest adventures of his lifetime. He's writing a piece on the new up and coming rock band Stillwater for the magazine Rolling Stones. He's going to get to go on tour with them and write about anything he wants about them for the next month or so. First though he has to get permission from him mom (Frances McDormand)... because he's only 15.

Before he gets this little gig, he's trying to get an interview with Black Sabbath when he meets Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), who's not just a groupie, but a Band-Aid. The difference being, she's in it for the music and not the sex with someone popular. Penny is definitely one of those `out of this world' types of girls. Not just in looks, but in her actions as well. She's a legend to the rock bands because she's just so much fun to have around, and she can always light up a room when she steps into it. She tugs on the tendrils of every heart of every man who comes into contact with her. But the only man she truly wants is Russell Hammond.

Will is accepted as a friend and not just `the enemy' as usual by the band members of Stillwater. Most notably by Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee). Jeff is the lead singer and Russell is the lead guitarist and also heart throb of the group. While Jeff is sort of an open book for Will, it's Russell he's a bit more interested in, mainly because Russ never really gives that interview he's looking for, but more than not just some one liner quotes. As time goes on, we see how the band has some inner turmoil due to Russell's looks. He's becoming the front man of the band when it was supposed to be Jeff, like the plan was. Just like a lot of bands, this one started off great, but slowly, it could be coming to an end.

I absolutely love this movie. Every time I watch it I have a big smile on my face almost the whole the time. From the atmosphere to the music to the settings to the parties, everything just makes me happy. Maybe it's because somewhere deep down in me I'm a rock star myself. Sure I can't sing, nor play an instrument (recorders don't count!), but by god I'm a rock star! The whole story is so much fun to watch unfold. Getting to witness the first time William gets to go back stage to the first time he gets to hang out at a hotel party, all the while making sure he calls his mom in the morning to check in, is just so much fun.

I actually watched `The Bootleg Cut' of this movie to do this review, and I'm pretty sure it was the first time I ever watched it. It's mostly the same, but more Penny Lane. Those parts were good but there were some parts that I still thought that should've been left out. For instance one scene has Will writing some paper, and his sisters ex comes in his window and starts talking to him about nonsense. It felt very weird and definitely should've been left out. Some scenes I could see why they were left out but were ok I guess. Like a scene that involves Stillwater going to a radio station and doing and interview with a drugged out DJ. It was kind of funny and also a little informative of the situation between Russ and Jeff. But they also left out some scenes. I don't remember them all, but I do remember one. It was the scene where Will is in the hotel room and has some of the girls jumping around him and basically it's left to us, but he has sex with them, which is his first time having sex. They left that out. That was a great scene, so I don't know why it was taken out. Oh well.

Also all the actors were great. Kate Hudson was very good, and I love the scene where Will tells her someone sold her for 50 bucks and a case of beer. She starts to cry just a tad, and then asks, ""What kind of beer?"" and smiles with a tear still rolling down her face. That was awesome. Patrick Fugit was good also, being the nice, sweet, and innocent kid and getting introduced to the life of the rock star.  Jason Lee rocked his part perfectly. He just had that 70's rock band swagger with the long hair flowing and not a care in the world except for his band being awesome. I also liked Billy Crudup and really everyone that was in Stillwater. They just seemed like a real band. So real I'd love to get a faux poster of the actual actors in their get up with a big STILLWATER above them. And Frances McDormand was just phenomenal as the mom of William. You honestly couldn't help love her. She was a great mom, even though a little crazy. You could tell she loved her kids, but was just a little too protective (so the movie makes you think). I actually thought she wasn't that protective though like the movie makes her out to be. Seriously she let her 15 year old kid go on tour with Stillwater to write for the Rolling Stones. At 15 I had to be home by 8pm and 9pm on weekends.

It was also fun to see a lot of cameos. Jimmy Fallon (a little more than a cameo), Nick Swardson, Peter Frampton, Zack Ward, Martin Starr, and a lot more.

In the end, man I would definitely say own this movie and make it the bootleg edition. That way you can watch both movies versions. I would DEFINITELY watch the award winning Theatrical Version first though.

P.S. - The bootleg edition comes with a 6 song EP of Stillwater. I love this CD. `Fever Dog' sounds so good as well as the other songs. I just wish I knew who really sang these songs.",1237161600,4,5375,4.170520231213873

1281233,5,B00003CXMG,"To be completely honest, when I first saw this film about five years ago I was under-whelmed.  It had been hyped up and won all sorts of awards and received so much attention, and really I didn't see why.  I was disappointed to say the least.  Then last night I decided to give it another shot.  Removing myself completely from the hype and praise and just amercing myself into the film was a huge plus for me, and I walked away from the experience singing it's praises like a church choir.  The film moved me in ways I didn't remember the first time; its rich sense of honesty ringing through with every frame.  The script is so real and raw, which I attest to the fact that director Cameron Crowe wrote this as a semi-autobiographic tale, and that first hand insight really gives `Almost Famous' an edge as possible his best film to date (and that's saying a lot since he has always been a genuinely talented director).

`Almost Famous' tells the story of William Miller (a fictional representation of Cameron Crowe), a young kid sheltered by his mothers iron fist, the same fist that drove away his older sister Anita.  At fifteen Miller gets the chance of a lifetime, to follow around the rockband Stillwater and write an article for Rolling Stone about the band on the road.  What he finds within their world is something starkly contrasts to anything he imagined.  It is a world that entices and appeals to him, but at the same time it's a world that conflicts with his inner person, especially as he watches the fame tear the band apart and take out innocent bystanders in the wake.  Stillwater is still trying to find its sea-legs so-to-speak and the process proceeds to shake up the members and all those in their company.

The performances by most the entire cast is strong and lends much support to Crowe's vision.  Billy Crudup and Jason Lee are effective as the feuding band leaders.  Crudup plays Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist filled with mystery, the one that everyone wants to be with.  Crudup does a good job of filtering through his characters inner contempt for the corruption within his profession.  When he's speaking with William's mother in the phone you can read in his voice his disgust with the whole `fame and fortune' aspect of his life.  Jason Lee is slightly less effective as Jeff Bebe, the jealous lead singer of Stillwater.  I didn't think he could completely sell his character.  I've never been impressed with Lee to tell the truth, and while his performance is not `terrible' it is merely passable here.  He tends to try and oversell things, and it got on my nerves a tad.  Patrick Fugit still seems a little green to me (but then again, when this was made he was green, right?) but he has a feeling of honesty in his performance that works well for what Crowe was attempting.  Fugit comes off uncomfortable with his performance, which I think aids in creating the vibe that he is a real fifteen-year-old kid who, lets face it, is pretty uncomfortable with himself.

The three standouts here though are McDormand, Hoffman and especially Hudson, all of whom raise the bar for the rest of the actors in the film.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is rarely seen moving around, but his grasp of his characters idealisms has a strong influence on the film.  Frances McDormand really gets under her characters skin (that of William's overbearing mother Elaine) and draws out such unrestrained emotion that you can't help but feel for her in every scene, even the ones she doesn't embody.  For every scene she is not though, there is Kate Hudson, who is so effervescent as Penny Lane I can't help but adore her.  Her innocent devotion to a machine that just wants to use her, a machine that doesn't care enough about her to deserve her unwavering adoration is just so raw and believable and sympathetically captivating I just can't help but fall in love with her.

Truth be told though, this film is all about Cameron Crowe.  His stamp of reality is felt on every frame.  The audience is allowed to become completely absorbed into the world in which he himself was found at such a young age (at eighteen Crowe wrote for Rolling Stone Magazine, and this film is based on his `adventures' so-to-speak).  His direction is flawless, but even more amazing is the script, which bleeds on every page the smell of honesty.  It may not be my favorite script of the year (`You Can Count on Me' remains one of my favorite screenplays ever written) but it is certainly one of them.

`Almost Famous' truly has that extra something (not to mention the amazing soundtrack), that honesty that makes it worth every second of your time.  Cameron Crowe really put himself completely into this picture, and the finished product is something he can truly be proud of, and something we can all praise him unflinchingly for.",1218412800,,4827,4.666666666666667

1281304,4,B00003CXMG,"This is a movie I really enjoyed.  While it is definitely in Crowe's voice, it is a fairly unique movie and has a lot of charm.  This is essentially a film about family, both actual families and adopted families of friends, with all the problems this entails.

The performances range from really good, to decent.  Fugit does a passable job, although he still comes off as a kind of annoying kid.  While this doesn't kill the movie or anything, it does let him get overshadowed by much of the rest of the case.  MCDormand and Deschanel both put in great performances, and are really likable.  You feel that this is the guys family with them.  Hoffman of course steals the scenes he is in, but this is to be expected.  Jason Lee, who before this movie was know for comedy, also really carries his scenes, and it is easy to see how he keeps getting work and increasing notoriety.  The two real standouts for me were Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson.  Both delivered very real performances, showing a huge range of emotion though the film and really portraying broken people.

The writing itself is for the most part good.  The story is very believable.  Since this is somewhat autobiographical, this is to be expected.  A problem this film does have is pacing.  It really drags in some parts and could have had a better flow.  It is a nice looking film, but not so to the point you will think about the visuals later.

The music should also be mentioned.  There are some really good performances and some just good music scattered throughout.  The performance of Tiny Dancer in particular is spectacular.

1281306,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous is a fantastic (and true!) tale of a young kid who ends up writing for Rolling Stone magazine.  Borrowing from different parts of his real life, writer/director Cameron Crowe introduces us to William, an extremely gifted teenager who ends up touring with a band named Stillwater.  William misses a half dozen deadlines, gets caught in the middle of band politics, and falls in love with the ""band aid"" Penny Lane.

This is one of my favorite films of all time.  I was afraid that the director's cut would screw up a great narrative, but the scenes that were removed were cut simply for time.  They flesh out the band members more, and give you even more insight into what an outsider William is.
Even better, the commentary track includes the voice of Cameron Crowe and his mom.  Letting his mother join the commentary proves to be both daring and insightful, as she corrects some of the slight differences between the film and real life.
Other extras on the disc aren't quite as special... but the director's cut does include a disc of ""Stillwater"" songs, written by Cameron and his wife, Nancy Wilson.

This disc takes one of the best films of all time and makes it better.  Well worth the purchase.

There are 2 dozen interviews, and there is only one other male interviewed, male groupie Pleather. The book chronicles the exploits of groupie's, from Mary Magdalen, through Tura Satana, Pamela herself, Cynthia Plaster Caster, Gail Zappa, Sweet, Sweet Connie of Little Rock, Lori Lightning, Bebe Buell, and Pleasant Gehman, among others. The reason for the inclusion of Cameron is for the film, Almost Famous, and the character of Penny Lane, played by Kate Hudson. She is NOT a groupie, she is a Band-Aid, and the young journalist, William Miller (Patrick Fugit), in an early scene in the film, also claims he is NOT a groupie. I recently emailed Tura Satana, and she also claimed she wasn't a groupie either. She just happened to have had a fling with Elvis, among others. Sure, Tura wasn't a groupie, and maybe you could even say that Elvis was her groupie. Penny Lane, the non-groupie character in Almost Famous, says that groupies do it for the thrill of getting close to someone famous, but ""Band-Aids"" do it for the love of the music. A better term for them is ""Muse"" as in someone who inspires an Artist or Musician.

Anywhat, Almost Famous is mostly a thinly veiled autobiography of Cameron Crowe, the film director who began writing for Rolling Stone at the tender age of 16. After such an auspicious beginning, he went on to direct

Penny Lane, Polexia Aphrodisia (Anna Paquin), and the other women are somewhat peripheral. Elaine Miller (Frances McDormand), his mother, and his older sister Anita Miller (Zooey Deschanel), play just as pivotal a role in the young auteur's rite of passage.

Jason Lee is of course very familiar from the TV show My Name is Earl, but eerily, he also plays David Seville, manager of The Chipmonks, in the recent remake of that seminal prototype to The Monkees, The Archies, Josie and the Pussycats, Gorrilaz, and other pop music/cartoon, and/or television projects. What is eerie about it is that the opening scene of Almost Famous, the first music heard, is actually the aforementioned Chipmonks, as the young William Miller (Michael Angarano) listens on the radio. Back to Jason Lee, though, he not only sang well, he also acted his part superbly, bristling in the shadow of egomaniac Russell Hammond. Crudup's character is revealed when he attends a party with some mid-west locals, takes a psychedelic drug, and jumps off the house into a swimming pool, proclaiming ""I am a Golden God.""

The DVD includes as a bonus some of Cameron's articles written for Rolling Stone, and they really shed a lot of light on the subject. The Allman Brothers story is written after Duanne Allman's fatal motorcycle accident. Perhaps, then, the Russell Hammond character is based on Jimmy Page, as another important interview of the young scribe was done of Led Zeppelin, who despite their huge success and tremendous album sales, were continuously slagged by critics, chief amongst them, Rolling Stone. There is a lot of mistrust and animus between musician and journalist. When they meet, they nickname him Enemy. Meanwhile, mentor Lester Bangs warns him, whatever you do, don't become their friend.

The music for Stillwater was written by Cameron and his wife, Nancy Wilson, of female heavy metal group, Heart. The actors who played the band, Stillwater, were coached by Peter Frampton, who actually got them ready to perform within a few months with a little intense Rock Star Fantasy Boot Camp training. One of the Rolling Stone interviews is of Frampton, just after the huge success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frampton-Comes-Alive/dp/B000009HF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frampton Comes Alive!</a>, and just prior to the release of the ill-advised film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Pepper-s-Lonely-Hearts-Club-Band/dp/B00009APB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>. In the preface to that interview, he confesses that he broke the cardinal rule of Rock Journalism, as laid down by Lester Bangs: Don't befriend the musicians. Knowing what a fiasco and career wrecker the movie would be, one can only wonder why he would let his so-called friend make such a disastrous movie. But the amiable Frampton took his success in stride, and seems to have also taken his subsequent fall from grace quite well.

But I digress, and just let me say here that the inclusion of the Rolling Stone articles is quite a bonus, as they not only illuminate what goes on in the movie, but also validate the protagonist's saga. Because, if he had sucked as a writer, what a silly story that would have been. But the writing is very impressive, and all the more so when you consider the author's tender age.

Patrick Fugit, playing the Cameron Crowe/William Miller character does a fantastic job of acting as well. He yearns to be cool, but he is so not. He has a crush on Penny Lane, and one scene where he is deflowered by some of the other ""groupies"" is quite tastefully handled, well-acted, and what is most striking is that he makes eye contact with Penny Lane throughout, and you feel that there is some kind of strange love between them, however unrequited it may be. Another scene has Penny asking him if he wants to go to Morocco with her, and he says ""Yes,"" then asks her to ask him again. It was later revealed in the ""Making of"" footage that he was asking for another take, but they left it in because it was spontaneous and captured an ethereal quality of yearning. Another scene that shows Crowe's skill as a director was one in which Penny Lane (whose real name is finally revealed as Lady Goodman) is smashed on qualudes. As she rolls around vomiting in her diaphanous lingerie, and the young journalist calls for emergency medical assistance, the soundtrack plays Stevie Wonder singing My Cherie Amour. He can't help loving her, in spite of it all. It is just this sort of juxtaposition that makes the mise en scne of auteur Cameron Crowe unique, and why watching any of his films is always such an enjoyable experience.",1197936000,3,8406,6.0225752508361206

band touring in the seventies as seen through the eyes
of an almost-employed young journalist who's been hired
to follow them.
Most of the characters are expectable if not exactly pre-
dictable. The surprise-and for me, the delight-of this movie
is the depiction of the young, drifting groupie. Kate Hudson
pulls off the perfect combination of toughness, vulnerability
and romantic dreaminess.
In the very masculine world of rock movies, this depiction of
a young woman stands out not just for its rarity but for the
contrast of her many-layered humanity with the testosterone-
fueled excess of the rest of the cast.

In the very best sense, this is a superb chick flick about a
remarkable woman.

I love it that the lead guitar player of StillWater is egocentric and self-centered yet is still a pretty good guy. All the characters on this movie have that real, flawed, and multidimensional quality.
The story is also original and doesn't try to be anything more than what it is. The plot is solid but still loose enough for the characters to drive the movie. Really brings the 70's alive without parodying it. Great movie, great soundtrack.

What Cameron Crowe has done, is design a world that seemingly you feel a part of. This utopia where dreams in fact can and do come true, where if you just have some guts and some brawn and go with your heart, the road may lead to a different path than you first intended, where music placed in the most perfect of scenes can transport you to a time of endless love and karma and you can, if only for an hour or two, wonder why the world can be so cruel and unkind. Kate Hudson is radiant. I fell in love with Penny Lane. I wanted to run my fingers through her hair, let her cry on my shoulders, sing to her. I feel in love with Billy Crudup, his passion for music ignited another fire in me that was brewing for some time: to get out and see the small things that perhaps in the day to day heydey of living, I take for granted. If you haven't seen this yet, take the plunge, watch more filmmaking that crosses the threshold from simply a movie, to a journey.

That my fine friend, that in all its joyous craft and benevolence is what Almost Famous is to me. A journey of the heart, a journey of the soul and a journey of a boy and a dream and the perservarance to give it all he could. Truly something that finally deserves 5 stars in my book. Cameron Crowe is a powerhouse with this motherload!

I even have a tendency to steal things like William does in the movie.  Even if you don't hang with bands this movie is a lot of fun.  I give this movie 6 out of 5 stars.  It's a new look at bands and how they really bond and work with each other.",1183161600,,571,3.9130434782608696
1281495,3,B00003CXMG,"I truly enjoyed this film, over-enjoyed it in fact.  There are far too many wonderful scenes, great joints of dialogue, and an overflow of brooding young men and women.  I felt like I had no character on which to focus my sympathy.  I wanted to focus on the perspective of the young writer, William Miller (played expertly by Patrick Fugit), but the film wouldn't let me.  I wanted to envision Russell Hammond (played genuinely by Billy Crudup), but I couldn't decide if he was a rock star, a little boy trapped in a man's body, or a surrogate father to William.  I didn't understand Kate Hudson's Oscar nomination, but I understood Frances McDormand's.  And why the hell Philip Seymour Hoffman wasn't nominated, I'll never understand.  Something was going on in this movie that confused me.

I think the greatest flaw in this movie - the theatrical version, at least - is that there are simply too many great performances and too many fascinating characters for the film to center itself.  I'm positive that the director's cut is the version to see.  The theater cut was pieced together with an air of sadness in order to meet a marketable time limit.  I felt like I was missing a lot of back-story, supporting roles, and important moments.  If you have never seen this movie, avoid the theatrical version.  It is severely dismembered, and it's clear that the director (Cameron Crowe) had more to show the viewer.  The director's cut is over forty minutes longer, and I look forward to seeing it.

I probably should at least attempt to place this movie.  The film covers the 1973-74 tours of the band Stillwater.  There were an actual band back then, but the majority of their representation is fabricated for the sake of the movie.  Most of the music in the film is representative of the time period and not so much from the band.  Thus, this is not a true biopic, but an imagined biopic, a movie about a band that was, as the title states, almost famous.",1180742400,,1957,4.636627906976744
1281496,5,B00003CXMG,"Uplifting coming-of-age stories generally don't do it for me. That is, unless they include great dialogue, comedy and drama, top-notch performances and a fantastic soundtrack. And that's exactly what multiple Oscar nominee ""Almost Famous"" has going for it. Of course, the fact that the main character lives out my dream of touring with a rock band doesn't hurt, either.

""Almost Famous"" takes place during the early '70s, an era when rock legends such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and The Who were in their prime. It's into this milieu that William Miller (Patrick Fugit), an earnest 15-year-old, finds himself thrust when he scores a Rolling Stone magazine assignment to cover a rising rock band called Stillwater. Against the odds, Fugit works his way into the inner circle of the band, initially winning their respect through his knowledge of their music.

What begins as a short assignment turns into a multiple-month odyssey during which Patrick follows the band as it tours and grows from a second-tier rock group into superstars. Several compelling relationships develop along the way, including a unique friendship between William and the band's guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), and a touching bond between William and Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), a Stillwater groupie who prefers to be referred to as a Band-Aid. As dissension brews and excess rages within the band, Patrick is faced with a difficult decision: tell the band's real story and sell-out its members, or write a powder-puff boring article that might end his journalistic career.

If the characters and their relationships with one another seem startlingly real in ""Almost Famous,"" that's because director/screenwriter Cameron Crowe (""Say Anything,"" ""Jerry Maguire"") based the story on his own experiences. As a result, Crowe gets every little detail right, from the band interactions to family dynamics to the music itself, to the point where you may start wondering whether this Stillwater band is real or fiction. Was ""Almost Famous"" robbed of a Best Picture nomination? You bet your a--.

The brilliant ensemble cast wonderfully compliments Crowe's razor-sharp writing skills. In the lead role, the underrated Fugit is utterly believable. Academy Award nominee Hudson gives a performance that's simultaneously sexy, strong and vulnerable. Crudup is by turns obnoxious, kind, egotistical and funny. And Jason Lee again showcases his fine comic touch as Stillwater's lead singer, especially when he attacks Russell for hogging too much of the limelight: ""I'm the frontman, and you're the guitarist with mystique!""

The best movies often draw you into their world and allow you to share their characters' fears, loves, sadness and joy. In ""Almost Famous,"" we share William's exhilaration as he lives the life of a rock star, and his sadness as he experiences the darker side of life and love. Ultimately, William loses his innocence, but manages to maintain his hopefulness. ""Almost Famous"" is the rare film that earns its feel-good sentiment by showing us the humor and heartbreak along the way to achieving it.",1180051200,,3093,5.291242362525458

You're really missing out if you miss this.",1177804800,3,238,4.0
1281498,5,B00003CXMG,"Cameron Crowe's (Jerry Maguire, Vanilla Sky) light hearted comedy drama about a young teen spending months traveling around with a bunch of big-ego rising rock stars really hits home.

The beginning of the movie starts off with a very creative way of listing out the credits via William (played by Patrick Fugit). From the start you know that music - more specifically rock 'n' roll - is very focused upon because all the ticket stubs from rock concerts and stickers as well. You next get to see how William's mom (played by Frances McDormand) is very controlling and strict...and Crowe likes to make point of that as often as possible throughout the movie.

After his older sister leaves with her boyfriend, and he also figures out that he is eleven years old in the seventh grade while everyone else is thirteen the movie skips four years until he's fifteen. But, before the flash-forward, William is instructed to look under his bed from his sister. He goes to find a collection of (what we now know) as some of the best rock albums of all time. He puts on The Who's ""Tommy"" and then flashforward 4 years.

Anyway, William becomes incredibly interested in Rock 'n' Roll as you next see him as a fifteen year old high school student sketching the hot rock bands of the time on his notebook. He then gets a little job offer from Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymor Hoffman) to write a small editorial on Black Sabbath because they were playing a show that night. At the show, William runs into Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) along with Stillwater (The blooming rock band) and hooks up with them. Afterwards, the movie picks up and the story starts to unfold.

As the movie goes on, you really get to see Kate Hudson fill in a role that was so made for her its scary...actually, she was made to be Penny Lane. Billy Crudup really shines as the ""hey, I'm the good guy who'll befriend everyone"" but who really has a lot of issues of his own. William Miller is the kid in all of us as we watch - very relatable to the viewers. Cameron Crowe really makes William a solid character as the only solid member of the whole tour. He is what a lot of us are like, at least I really relate to him. He is an innocent fan in a world of drugs, sex, and rock 'n' roll - all foreign to him. The way he really grows up in the movie is awesome, and one of the most enjoyable character developments I've seen.

I really enjoyed this film overall. The acting was so dead-on, It was like watching a documentary. The soundtrack tops most all other soundtracks in recent memory. Led Zeppelin is the highlight band in the soundtrack, as songs like Tangerine and That's The Way are played a few times throughout. Actually, its been said that Stillwater (the fictitious band in the movie) is actually somewhat molded after Led Zeppelin. This is Crowe's best achievement to date - topping Jerry Maguire. I have to say that anyone who is a fan of classic rock, or is someone who has always been the odd man out...watch this film.

Acting is solid all around.  Patrick Fugit inhabits the character of William Miller.  How much of the performance is based on Cameron Crowe, and how much is truly Miller, the world may never know.  It doesn't matter, he does a great job.  Billy Crudup delivers as Russell Hammond.  He's at times likable, annoying, and cruel (even if he doesn't know it).  In the end we like Russell, but we also want to have Elaine beat him upside the head a few times.  I'm not a huge fan of Kate Hudson, but she does a great job as Penny Lane.  It's still my favorite part she's played, and I think she'll have a hard time topping it.  The supporting cast is equally good, with Francis McDormand nearly stealing every scene she's in.

Cameron Crowe's film is more than a little autobiographical.  The script does glorify the time period at times, but it never harms the film.  Instead it gives the viewer a cozy feeling.  The ending is never really in doubt, but the journey is what makes it work.  Crow's direction is solid and involving.

This is one entertaining movie.  It skillfully combines comedy, romance, drama and nostalgia, balancing the mixture perfectly.  Any fans of music or coming of age stories will find plenty to enjoy here.  The theatrical cut seems a little too light at times, but the longer version (called ""Untitled"" by the director, and currently out of print) is more gritty and delivers a more satisfying film.

In this sense, the material is interesting but the film to my view falls respect its anecdotic feature, without exploring another important factors that permeated those times.

I thought this was a very well told story about the excesses of rock and roll music, music journalism, fandom and groupies. Most movies on this topic tend to be overly cynical or over romanticized, and I appreciated that it was done from such an honest perspective.

I especially appreciated the line spoken by one of the old-timer band-aides while she was looking at the new girls so scornfully...

""They don't even know what it is to be a fan. You know, to truly love some silly little piece of music, or some band, so much that it hurts...""

Although I am not, and never have been a groupie by any stretch of the imagination I am an avid rock/pop music aficionado, I thought that line in the movie captured the spirit and sentiment of die-hard fandom perfectly...

I liked the way Cameron Crowe humanized the groupies. Sure, some groupies and regular fans are definitely delusional, but many of them do have goals apart from sleeping with rock stars...and they do have feelings, just like anyone else...and I thought he demonstrated that well when developing the characer of ""Penny Lane.""

At any rate, the music used in the movie is just awesome! It sure was fun to hear ""Go All The Way"" by the Raspberries as well as ""Tiny Dancer"" by Elton John. How could you not sing along to that 70s classic?

Then the other night it was on Bravo and I figured I had time, I might as well watch it.  Let me say that I'm glad I can finally say I've seen it, and what a wonderful experience it was.  Despite my feelings about the lack of talent young Patrick Fugit has, he's quickly offset by the other talent on the screen.  Kate Hudson delivers the best performance here with her Penny Lane, groupie extraordinaire who follows her favorite band `Stillwater', the same band that William (Fugit) is traveling with in order to write an article for a rock magazine.  Penny is such a free spirit, and she's so devoted to the music she loves that you're instantly drawn to her.  Billy Crudup also does well as the bands lead singer and Penny's crush, and Jason Lee is hilarious as the lead guitarist.  As I'm sure all have read that this is a fictional tale based on Cameron Crowe's younger years as a reporter for Creem and Rolling Stone and so as the director Crowe makes sure that the film has those personal touches that lift it from sheer entertainment and create a realistic and homey feel throughout the film.

I'd heard about ""Almost Famous"", that it was a rock'n'roll kind of film, but the moment I found out it was set in the 1970s, I kept my eye out for the DVDs. Being born in the 1980s, I can't say whether this was an accurate potrait of the music scene back then, but I certainly found it interesting.

William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a clever kid, so clever he's been skipped ahead two grades. He likes to write, it seems, and he loves rock music and the scene that surrounds it. He wants to become a rock journalist, so he finds a local writer, who gives him a few pointers, and his first job - to write an article. William writes his article, and it goes down really well. So well, in fact, that Rolling Stone magazine give him a call, asking him to go along with Stillwater on the road on their ""Almost Famous"" tour. He's underage, and has lots of exams to do at school, but with a deep voice over the phone and the help of a ""band-aid"" by the name of Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), he is off around America with the rock group. On the tour he sees the ups, the downs, the dirty and the cleaned up. He falls in love, learns a lot about himself and hears a little more than a music journalist is supposed to. To top it all off, his concerned mother keeps ringing around, trying to get him to come home!

It's an intriguing, involving ride, I thought. You get to see the perspective of a 1970s band, a worried 1970s parent, a 1970s fan, and a 1970s groupie. That's a lot of points of view, and they're all handled thoughtfully, I thought. I like the look of the sets and the locations. The young extras are a nice touch too. The music playing in the background really helped set the scene, I felt. Led Zeppelin, The Who, Simon & Garfunkel, plus a song from a couple of my favorite 1970s groups like Jethro Tull and Yes. It's always nice when a good film has a good soundtrack.

If you're interested in 1970s music, this film is definitely worth a look.",1158451200,3,2085,4.194513715710723

I'm only 19 and yet I felt the way my parents must have when they heard these songs. They had meaning again. They felt pure.  Never in all my life has a movie done that for music.  Im going to start an online group dedicated to bringing back Rock and discovering modern day artist who hold on to that unique sound. You have to see this movie.  It speaks to me in more ways than one. I'm an aspiring journalist and though I don't sing or play an instrument it moves me musically too.  Music is my mood changer.  I could be pissed at the world and for that moment in that time, that one song could calm me.  These songs can do that again.  Buy the soundtrack. Buy the movie. ROCK HAS MEANING FOR ME AGAIN!!!!",1155427200,5,813,4.094936708860759
1281560,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous is my favorite movie of all time and Cameron Crowe is my all time favorite writer/director. This movie is by far one of his best films yet.

Set in 1973, Almost Famous tells the story of 15-year-old William Miller (Patrick Fugit), who's dream is to become a great rock journalist while his overprotective mother strives for her son to go to law school. After writing some pieces for local magazines, the editor of Rolling Stone magazine contacts William (not knowing that he is only 15) and sets him up to go on tour with the up and coming band Stillwater. While on tour, William falls for a ""Band-Aid"" named Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). He becomes torn between wanting to belong with his new rock star friends and his wanting to be a ""honest and unmerciful"" rock journalist.

Almost Famous is an adaptation of Cameron Crowe's real life. He was William Miller. Cameron Crowe actually did write for Rolling stone when he was in high school and really did tour with all kinds of rock stars (i.e.- Led Zepplin and the Allman Brothers). He even reveals in the commentary (which unfortunately is only located on the directors special two-disc edition) that there was a girl he knew while on tour who went by the name Penny Lane. The character of Penny Lane was derived from many girls who went on tour with the bands simply because they loved their music.

Amazing movie, amazing performances by the actors, amazing music. Do yourself a favor and buy this movie!

I also recommend Say Anything, my second favorite movie (also written/directed by Cameron Crowe).",1154822400,,1567,4.75

1281670,5,B00003CXMG,"The majority of the time, once you reach that 2 hour mark, your saying to your buddy ""Aight, when's this thing gonna end?""

Well this isn't one of those movies. I just wanted the film to keep going and going. But, sadly, it had to end. It's an amazing experience that will go down in film history forever. It has an amazing cast and amazing story. It's hilarious and sad at the same time.

The story follows a young journalist's attempt for fame and recognition. He finally catches his break when Rolling Stone stumbles upon his writing and decides to give him a chance. His assignment: To write a story about Stillwater, the band he recently befriended.

The movie really has some amazing performances. Phillip Seymour Hoffman has an incredible supporting role. It really is one of his best performances of his career. It's very memorable. Billy Crudup, has the best performance of his career, as the troubled guitarist of the band Stillwater. Frances McDormand and Kate Hudson both have amazing roles. Patrick Fugit, William Miller, has the best performance as the troubled young journalist. The supporting cast is also very good. It includes: Jason Lee, Anna Paquin, Jimmy Fallon, and Noah Taylor.

The direction and writing of Cameron Crowe, are both flawless. That's basically all you can say about it. It's brilliantly done.

Also, if you can, buy a copy of the Untitled addition. It is OOP, out of print, but if you can find a used copy, buy it. In my opinion, the Untitled version is a much better experience.

I hope you decide to buy or rent the movie. Enjoy every second of the wonderful experience.",1149379200,5,1610,4.752688172043011

In terms of the plot, Almost Famous is anything but predictable and the various obstacles that William, the main character, must overcome and the challenges the other characters face, will keep you in your seat. Although I, being born in the late 80's, never had the opportunity to live in the 1970's, Almost Famous enabled me to learn various aspects of the lifestyles and culture of rock n' roll's hottest time period in American. Everything from the rocking music, clothing trends, and the care-free attitude in this movie will bring you back to a more exciting time in history and can make anyone wish they were on tour with a 70's rock band.

It is about a teenage boy who wants to become a reporter for the Rolling Stone, so he joins the tour of Stillwater, an up and coming rock band.

1281675,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous is a near note-perfect recreation of the rock music millieu before it had exhausted itself in excess in the middle to later 70's. Director Cameron Crowe weaves heavy doses of his personal experiences into a fictional tale of how a hard working band, Stillwater, rises to stardom aided by all sorts of willing dreamers.

The interactions between the band members and all of the people whose lives they touch are simply mezmerizing. Especially interesting is the examination of the range of participation that people have with music. Crowe differentiates in many shades between the casual and the romantic aspects of music: On the casual side we see music as a business -- its creators and fans as product to be sold or reported on, to be seen with or to have casual relationships with; On the romantic side we see music as a revelation unto itself -- it generates love to be shared between people.

The characters and actors (great casting!) are all believable and, in the end, inspiring. The sex and drugs aspects are sanitized a bit, but then this is a love story with a relatively happy ending, not a tale of failed music.

Some of the lighter fun includes all sorts of visual and spoken references to many of the premier performers of the early seventies: Bowie, Sabbath, The Who, Led Zep, Elton John, Allman Brothers, Joni Mitchell, Lou Reed and a blur of others...

If you like the theatrical version and are interested in the autobiographical aspects in more detail, I highly recommend the director's cut. The mother-son relationship that seems somewhat implausable in the film was apparently right on the money, and Cameron Crowe did in fact skip 3 grades (one skip instigated by a simple mistake!) and graduated high school at the age of 15. The near airplane crash, the Lester Bangs relationship, the sister who leaves Cameron with her music collection and her wisdom and then meets him sitting alone in an airport -- all true!

Another interesting note from the director's cut is that Cameron is married to Nancy Wilson of Heart and they co-wrote the fictional Stillwater band's songs and she wrote other parts of the soundtrack as well. Cameron also comments on several reactions to Almost Famous from bands or individuals that were included on the excellent soundtrack of the movie.

Finally, In addition to the autobiographical richness, the director's cut adds insightful personal and relational depth to virutually every major character in the movie.

Unless you really dislike the aforementioned musical sources, I recommend you take a look at this movie as a cultural historical document, if nothing else. If you enjoy music from that period of Rock or were growing up during that time, Almost Famous is not to be missed.",1138579200,2,2752,4.905376344086021
1281676,3,B00003CXMG,"I neither loved nor hated this film.  I can't say much bad about it, and I can't pinpoint many things I liked about it either.  Guess it's just not my kind of film.

But there were some good points.  The acting is top notch.  The dialogue and direction is natural and engaging.  There were one or two moments that made me chuckle with their gentle humor.

But there were bad points too.  I liked the viewpoint character, but the rest were remarkably unsympathetic and often mildly annoying.  Although no one else seems to think that, so this criticism can be disregarded, I think.  Also, I didn't like the mother at all.  Not one little bit.  Judgmental, pretentious, obnoxious, Yech.

Also, the production design and costuming is exceptional, but the 70s was such an ugly decade that it kind of put me off.  That's not really a fair complaint either though.

A good film, not great.  But then again, it's not my thing so if it is your thing, I do recommend it.",1136678400,2,961,4.5
1281677,5,B00003CXMG,"Cameron Crowe has without a doubt made many great films (though his recent work has been lacking), but it's no contest which of his films is his masterpiece: ""Almost Famous"". Funny, inspiring, and at times heartwarming, and backed by one of the best soundtracks ever, ""Almost Famous"" is a cinematic masterpiece that I would place right up there along with ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Godfather"". IT IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE.

The film (based on Crowe's younger day) takes place in 1973. William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a 15 year old amateur rock journalist for Cream Magazine. Mentored by world renowned rock writer Lester Bangs (a perfectly snide Philip Seymour Hoffman), he is given by the biggest assignment of his life. He is hired by Rolling Stone to pen an article of the up and coming rock band Stillwater. He is sent out on tour with them, much to the dismay of his overprotective mother (the always wonderful Francis McDormand). He becomes close with the band, but mostly with the band's disillusioned and drug addicted guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup). He also meets the woman who will change his life: ""band aid"" Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, who steals the show). Over the course of the tour, William does a lot of growing up, and learns of the harsh realities of the music industry. By the time the tour is over, he is no longer the 15 year old boy he was when he left.

This movie is amazing. The cast is wonderful, and the soundtrack is the greatest ever put onto a film (this can be said for several of Crowe's film soundtracks). ""Almost Famous"" is a film you'll want to watch again and again.",1135123200,4,1605,4.667844522968198
1281678,5,B00003CXMG,"Cameron Crowe's fictionalized account of his young days as a rock writer is a beautiful tale and a trip down memory lane.

Every one of these characters is lovable despite their flaws.  The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and it is integral to the tale Crowe is weaving for the audience.

Boy was I wrong on that one!!  This is a wonderful, sensitive film that develops a number of themes:  finding a mentor, making your first foray into the world, discovering what (relative) failures most of us are as people, and of course, the decline of rock in the 1970s.  Not only was the psychology of the characters subtle and realistic, but the evocation of the time - when the 60s idealism gave way to crass commercialism and, well, genuine mediocrity - is vivid and accurate.

I am almost the exact same age as the protagonist, so I identified with him on many levels:  rebelling against a parent he loved to go his own way, accomplishing something original by getting inside with his own talent and gall, and seeing the people behind the idols of cool.  It is amazingly successful at all this, and for kids there is a lot to learn from it.  Heck, even I re-wrote my life somewhat while enjoying this adventure of youth!  It is lovely, sad, and uplifting.

Warmly recommended.  This is a great director.",1129161600,2,1278,4.581497797356828

1281789,5,B00003CXMG,"Before taking the plunge and buying the rather high-priced director's cut, I figured I'd watch the original version first. I have always known about this movie, but when it first came out I didn't appreciate classic rock like I do now. Knowing this had to do with a rock band, and also knowing all the hype that surrounded it during it's release, I finally decided to watch it. I wasn't completely sure of what to expect when I bought it, but being a Kate Hudson fan, I had a feeling it'd be good. I found I was completely correct in this assumption a mere 20 minutes into the film. But I also went into this movie thinking it was solely about Kate. I was a bit dissappointed to find it wasn't, but I feel that Patrick Fugit had a more compelling story behind his character.

This movie follows William Miller (Fugit) through a once in a lifetime experience. By faking his age, Rolling Stone unknowingly hires him to do an article about an up-and-coming band called Stillwater. Along the way he meets, and befriends, a ""Band Aid"" who calls herself 'Penny Lane.' She basically shows him how a band functions. He also befriends the band's guitarist, Russell Hammond. While the rest of the band refers to William as 'the enemy,' Russell looks past that and becomes a kind of role model for him, taking him under his wing. But when it comes time to turn in his article, William finds he still hasn't had an interview with the most popular person in the band, Russell. So William writes about his experiences with the band. When the magazine calls to confirm the authenticity of the article, the band says it's all false. There's the basic story.

But this movie is about more than just the story, it's also about the music. It features one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, and the rousing sing-along of Elton John's 'Tiny Dancer' is worth the price alone.

With memorable performances from everyone involved, this movie is without a doubt the best one I've seen in years. I wasn't expecting Patrick Fugit to do very good in a leading role (I saw 'Saved!' and didn't think he did as good as he could've), but he shows he can carry a movie as well as the next person. But the true standout is definitely Kate Hudson. She has the ability to make every one of her characters likeable and truthful to real life people, and it's no different in this film. Billy Crudup as Russell is one of my favorite people in this movie though. One minute he's the typical 'drugs, sex, and rock and roll' guy, the next he's a true human. Jason Lee even puts on a very good performance as the band's lead singer. Who would've thunk it? A five star movie all the way.",1126656000,,2651,4.473140495867769
1281790,4,B00003CXMG,"O.k. be kind since I am going to be honest here.  I already own one copy of ""Almost Famous.""  I bought it at Best Buy for $10.00.  It was the best ten dollars I've ever spent.  This is one of my favorite movies.  However, when I discovered Cameron Crowe made a ""bootleg"" version I could barely wait until pay day to go buy it.

I didn't wait.  I borrowed money!

I go into the store.  One copy left.  I pick it up and stare at the price.  $29.00.  I stood there holding it for about six minutes.  Thirty dollars? I wanted it very much though, fueled by all the great reviews of it out here at amazon.

From reading the other reviews you are all probably familiar with the great special features.  There are two DVDs. The first DVD is the one that you want.

  This DVD has the Director's cut- the longer version of the film.  It is a strange feeling to watch the scenes that have been cut and put back in.  I almost felt like I was watching something that really happened.  The music score is a little different then the theatrical version as well.  The best part of this though is the Directors Commentary.  It goes along with the longer version of the film, so you get to hear the goodie reasons why these scenes were cut.  As you all know, the real life inspiration for Elaine Miller-Alice Crowe accompanies Cameron on the commentary.  She is just like her character,  quoting Freud and others while commenting on things, ""Remember when that happened Cameron?"" or ""Oh yes, this brings back memories.""  Cameron reveals a lot, has a very sharp memory,a good sense of humor, and does not hesitate to tell which experiences actually happened,(the de-flowering of William, much to the dismay of his mother, his sister finding him haggard in the S.F. Airport, one-very famous rock star shouting ""I am a golden god"" from the sunset strip, and the real life inspirations for his Stillwater band members.)  He talks about his experiences as young journalist- great information you will not be able to find anywhere else.  I believe the commentary is the thing that you will want to hear the most- and it is mysteriously missing from the first DVD release.

Also on this DVD  is a short-very short-behind the scenes feature. (It's fun but could of been much longer) Maybe not more then five minutes.  Also if you play around with it, you will discover some hidden special features (not easy to find) that talk about Philip Seymour Hoffman's  eerie day of playing Lester.  Also on this DVD are some of the few Rolling Stone articles that Crowe wrote as a teen.  Which are actually very very good.  You can see why RS had him write for them.  Also is a fantastic clip of a Lester Bangs interview.  You can actually see him speaking and talking-in almost real life.  That would be very hard to find anywhere else.

All my praises go out to Cameron for the DVD #1.  However, DVD #2 is practically identical to the version of Almost Famous I already own.  That was a little disappointing.  He did add the full length Stillwater concert in which the band plays 3 or 4 songs.  That was fun, because you do not see the full concert in the movie and it does contain the original full length theatrical version of the film, in case you do not own it already.  The third DVD is actually a CD with six full length still water songs.  It looks like a CD you would get as a promo at a live concert.  It's neat if you like to listen to fictitious band music.

Overall...I think it is an awesome DVD #1, and it really gives the fan more to love about this movie.  You feel like you've been let into a birds eye view of this movie.  More importantly, a  honest and truthful look into Camerons real life experiences.  The rest of it?  Disappointing.  30 dollars is a lot of money to spend for one DVD.  If you do not already own Almost Famous, I think you will feel this is money well spent.  For me who already owns it? I'm a little sad about the rest of it.  I think it was a little pricey--but it was still money worth spending because I am such a huge fan.",1126483200,4,4035,4.369770580296896

1281867,5,B00003CXMG,"Inspired by Cameron Crowe's real-life journeys and writings of some of rock and roll's biggest names(at least during the 70's anyways), the film is a kind of autobiographical-but-sort of telling of a boy becoming a man in probably the most un-innocent way a boy can.

William Miller is an aspiring journalist who writes for some magazines, notably Creem. He meets Lester Bangs, a legendary critic/journalist who warns him of rock stars. He gives him an assignment to do a writing on a Black Sabbath concert and get an interview but he's not allowed backstage. Until up-and-coming band Stillwater decides to bring him in. He becomes so well-liked that Rolling Stone offers to send him on tour with the band and do a piece on them. And so the journey begins.

With a largely 60's-70's soundtrack and many classic scenes, it's kind of hard not to like the film. The director's cut fleshes things out even more with more development into the characters, in particular band aid(don't call her a groupie) Penny Lane.

While Kate Hudson is a nice find(not to mention cute), it's Billy Crudup to me who makes the better performance. Flawed, funny, and weirdly likable. Patrick Fugit is good in some scenes but other scenes it's almost like he didn't go further than he could've. Phillip Seymour Hoffman also gives a great performance as Lester Bangs, an actual journalist.

Personally on a given day, I still prefer Jerry Maguire but this is probably Cameron's 2nd best film, even though it's obviously his most personal.",1112313600,,1513,4.8984375
1281868,5,B00003CXMG,"I originally saw this film in the theatre, and after having bought this particular package, I have to say it's a much better movie with the extra footage.

If you watch the both versions back to back, the omissions are glaring in the theatrical cut.  The film would likely have garnered more Oscars than nominations had this footage been in the theatrical release.

No matter, for those of us who have a love-hate relationship with the DVD industry, this is one director's cut that justifies the format in every single way.  Oh, did I mention the performances?

From top to bottom, everything about this movie is perfect.  From the casting to the editing, from the music selection to the writing, there isn't a weak link in the chain.  Cameron Crowe seemingly goes from strength to strength, and this film represents the pinnacle of his life as a filmmaker.

Although I grew up with a big crush on Drew Barrymore, I have to say that Kate Hudson (at least in this role) was MADE for the big screen.  Hopefully she'll get more dramatic parts, but I have a feeling this will be the crowning gem in her career.  She's absolutely luminous, and has you alternately saddened and infatuated at various times throughout the movie.

Frances McDormand is also stellar in her supporting role; she gets the biggest laughs.  Just when I thought Crowe wouldn't be able to top ""Say Anything"", he pulls this one out of thin air.  Stunning.",1109721600,,1422,4.685483870967742
1281869,5,B00003CXMG,"I'll be straight forward. You will only enjoy watching this movie if you appreciate the art of journalism and history and the formation of Rock And Roll. The movie takes place in the sixties and seventies when rock was starting to lose the effect on fans it once had. I don't think there could have been a better era to base this movie on. Rock was more innocent and more wild all at the same time! The music was soothing-- the kind you listen to while burning an incent and thinking deep within yourself. Then music was based on becoming famous and getting big only in hopes of being exposed to women, parties, s e x and d r u g s. Absorbing this all in your fifteen minutes of fame.

This movie is genuinely produced to satisfy all themes of what movies are typically based on. It is ingenuis!!! Almost Famous reflects the heartbreakes, true love, self -discovery, failure, finding your dreams and the truth behind music. Most movies are set on one particular subject. Cameron Crowe features life lessons all throughout this movie that immediately grabs, the viewer by the horns because of the intensity of each scene!

 I started loving this movie as a teenager. Probably because Almost Famous explores the rebelliousness of teenagers and purpose of a childhood. Patrick Fugit's (Williams)  mother, like many, was a rainstorm on his sunny summer day. He was robbed of adolescence. The day William realized his destiny was the day his sister left behind rock records with a note "" Listen to Tommy with a candle burning and it will set you free."" Music is an influence to us and we don't even know how much it impacts our lives! Music places angelic choirs in our head that molds us. This movie hits closer to home to younger generations than anyone else. For example, my grandmother saw this movie and had no interest whatsoever.

 The point of view of this movie is that of a teenage boy getting the real life story on rock band Still Water from the side of the stage. He dramatically transforms from a sheltered kid under his mothers wing to a roadie of a famous rock band. This movie really opened many doors for me. Fugit's character proved to me that living an adventurous life leads to the wildest things you could ever imagine and the stories you can tell to people. From getting intoxicated with Band-aids, rooming with Americas favorite band or rising every day to the flamboyant orange and yellow sunrise, not expecting what will happen today. This movie is a rollecoaster! It takes the viewer to highs and lows-- which really keeps your eyes glued on the TV screen. It ranges from Still Waters successes on making the cover on Rolling Stone to a life threatening airplane ride.

 Almost Famous is a movie that must be seen more than one or two times. I have seen it twelve times and still learn something new every time! Fugit's character inspires us to get out in the world and meet new people. Those who help you acheive your dreams and learn lifes most valuable lessons. Let go of moms hand and see for yourself a world full of the most wonderful places! The movie inspired me to not let anyone or anything be an obstacle on my journey through life. After all, you only live once. I strongly suggest seeing this wonderful movie. It will make you feel like a child all over again!",1101772800,10,3295,4.5728813559322035
1281870,5,B00003CXMG,"This movie will not make you cry, or even laugh very much, but in terms of impeccable story-telling this movie is matched only by the few greats such as Forrest Gump or American Beauty.  Cameron Crowe goes above and beyond here to show that the old adage is true, the best stories in life are the ones that actually happened.  The film is a semi-fictional account of Crowe's life as a teenager when he was given the opportunity to begin writing for the cream of the crop of music journalism, Rolling Stone Magazine.  The pace of the movie flows much like many of the classic rock songs that play almost non-stop throughout the movie.  It starts off a little slow, then goes into the first build and you get an idea that something special is about to happen, slowing down again at points to give the viewer a moment to reflect on what the characters are feeling and then it ends with a predictable yet unquestionably satisfying conclusion.  Everyone is perfectly cast here, with Billy Crudup proving he is worthy of a leading role and this movie MADE Kate Hudson the leading actress she is today.  While an unknown for the moment, Patrick Fugit more or less carried the movie on his shoulders, which was necessary because most of the film is told through his eyes.  With the exception of one scene that drags on just a little too long (Plane Turbulence), the rest of the movie is generally flawless and I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't like this movie.",1098144000,3,1454,4.547892720306513

Along the way, he experiences 1st hand what the life of a rockstar is really like, falls in love with a girl, and at the same time, finding his place in the world! The soundtrack for the film was composed by singer/songwriter Nancy Wilson. Each song in the film complements each scene perfectly. Almost Famous is one of the best films of our time.

The deleted footage of William losing his virginity and the silent ""Stairway to Heaven"" makes the pace of the movie completely different.  Commentary by Crowe and his mother reveals where a few scenes came from with additional details.  Overall, I think ""The Bootleg Cut"" is one of the best extended edition DVDs with both versions of the film and the Stillwater CD.",1097452800,18,484,4.807228915662651
1281873,5,B00003CXMG,"At first impression, the story of a young boy coming of age. on second thought, much more than this. Who is he? A young writer. Does he seem like the young, naive type? No, he seems grounded solidly-- if trecherously-- in reality. He absorbs the impact of his new experiences in the wild world of rock and roll-- including loosing his virginity-- as if something else is on his mind. Or someone.

We are not concerned whether the young boy will suffer as his inner naivete clashes with his reality. Rather, we are concerned whether what he chooses to write about will reflect accurately the world as it is-- the conflicted lives of his hero rock musicians. We are concerned with which world he chooses, not which world he is capable of dealing with. He is a writer; a lens of reality. And he chooses truth.

It is fitting that he should love a woman who represents the opposite -- a woman who lives in a self-conscious fantasy world, in love with a rock star. She walks as if an apparition. She is a temptress; a muse. The rock and roll band sings to her. It is through her eyes that the lead guitarist sees himself as genuine and talented.

But we see that same guitarist on the roof of the house of a fan, yelling that he is a ""golden god"" while tripping on acid. The band wonders whether he wants them. He wonders whether he wants the band-- but he stays with them because it makes him look cool. He accepts popularity with his band as an alternative to developing his full talent.

His band is becoming popular, taking the leap from small-time to big-time. The musicians are quarreling, adulterating, and it is not until they are almost killed in a plane crash that the truth comes out.

The question facing these characters is what is real? Will the woman step out of her fantasy world? Will the rock musician verify the story that the boy gives Rolling Stone, and expose the unmerciful truth that accompanies it? Will he stay with the band? Seen this way, the movie becomes a stunningly integrated masterpiece.

The boy's face has an innocence that stems from truth-- not naivete. And that is why everyone is unusually honest with him; that is why everyone loves him. But what will they say to him, how will they treat him? After all, he is a rock journalist. He is the enemy.",1096588800,2,2282,4.4735576923076925
1281945,5,B00003CXMG,"With over 400 reviews here,I doubt that I can add much...But this is such an uncommonly good film,I'm going to throw my two cents worth in anyway...There are people in this world for whom the phrase ""First Love"" will not evoke memories of a person,but rather a song. For whom music would become not something they simply enjoyed,but more something that they lived for...A song is not something they listen to,But something they live in. Some will go on to write and record,others to write about those that do. Others still, will find any way to involve themselves in the magic,And almost all of them will amass large record collections as a consequence. Not because they are ""record collectors"",but because they need to have every song that ever meant anything to them at close reach. It makes no difference whether it's Josey and The Pussycats or John Mellencamp,if it speaks to you-It's all good! This film is about those people, and that music. Cameron Crowe's brilliance lies in his ability to,in this film give the music a face. thus,making it the central character while the principal characters all play out their own individual relationships with it.--Think ""Something About Mary"" with Rock'n'Roll in the Cameron Diaz role,and you'll get a handle on this film. Crudup,Fugit,Lee,McDormand,and Hoffman are all flawless in their roles,but it is Ms. Hudson who will knock you off of your feet. One scene in particular that stands as a testimony to both Her skills as an actress and Crowe's as a Director is when her character boards the plane..Hudson is able to convey so much and so many emotions just through Her face, that you are simply blown away. I've watched a great many films in my life,but I've never,ever seen anything that I would consider PERFECT--Until now. If you're expecting SPINAL TAP,look elsewhere. A tell-all expose on this band or that,Not here. If you are looking for an example of filmaking at it's absolute finest, buy this and make it a permanent and prominent part of your collection.

1281946,5,B00003CXMG,"Don't you know now... Well this is how it was, and full marks to Cam Crowe and his insanely talented team for blessing us with this dead-on insight into the world of a touring Rock band and the role of the journalistic 'Enemy'.

Cameron and wife Nancy Wilson of Heart even wrote many of the songs, including the superb Fever Dog, with some additional contributions from music guru and Rock God, Peter Frampton. There is also a delightful cameo by Peter as the Humble Pie manager, Reg. Peter was the Pie's lead guitarist, along with the sadly late Stevie Marriott.

Not only is this a flawless piece of casting, including the always excellent Frances McDormand as Pat's Mom, but the band are totally believable, even though Billy Crudup and the brilliant Jason Lee weren't even musicians at the outset. You don't get a piece of this quality without a great deal of hard work, research, and attention to detail, and between Peter Frampton and Cameron himself, they have ensured that the finished product is a work of Art.

The Bootleg Cut is absurd value, featuring the extended version of the movie, plus the original and an excellent 6 track CD, which includes the Wilson-Crowe classics Fever Dog, Love Thing and Love Comes And Goes.

Stillwater are totally believable as a band, musically and visually, and the Cleveland Concert (one of the numerous Special features) looks 100% genuine. Jason's Paul Rogers of Bad Company look is perfect, and his lip-synching is flawless. Likewise Billy's guitar playing.

Kate Hudson absolutely shines, as does newcomer Patrick Fugit, who plays 'Cameron'. Naturally, to quote Jason, ""the chicks are good"", as you might expect with a collection of stunning and talented actresses that includes Kate, Fairuza Balk, Anna Paquin, Olivia Rosewood and Bijou Phillips. Yes, it's a BabeFest.

Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, with a simply stunning soundtrack. Aaaaaah The Rain Song...

1281947,5,B00003CXMG,"Basically this movie is about a young man who gets the chance to go on tour and write about an up-and-coming rock band for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine.  Loosely based on the director, Cameron Crowe's life.

 I am an 18 year old girl who loves the 1960's-1970's and appreciates the movies, clothes and especially music of that era. However for me it was incredibly difficult to find a movie made very well of the rock music scene until i rented ""Almost Famous."" From the beginning of the movie with the main actor Patrick Fugit writing the credits on a piece of notebook paper, to Kate Hudson's Oscar deserving performance, you are taken by this movie, at least I am.

  This movie is appealing (at least to me) because its about a young man who travels with a band and experiences it all. It's literally a dream come true for most people. Who hasn't wanted to travel with their favorite band and learn all their secrets and how they were inspired to write each of their songs? I certainly would love to know what makes Pete Townshend write the songs he does, because he is one of the greatest lyricist's alive.

  This movie is timeless. You will laugh and love & appreicate all the characters you come across in this movie. With amazing performances by Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee, Patrick Fugit and Zooey Deschanel I'm sure you'll enjoy this movie. It certainly is the best movie of 2000.

1281948,4,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous is charming and you can watch it with your older teens.  They'll ask you questions like, were you at Woodstock dad?  Did you do acid and meet mommy in a sleeping bag?  Sure kids, another time, another place, and don't do drugs.

Rock died in the mid 70's, came back in Seattle in early 90's, and died again. Roaming the world in bus and jet like gypsies, that's really cool for a little while. Only groupies and drugs make it bearable for the long haul.

Cameron Crowe had his experience back in 73 and Almost Famous is his belated version.  The actors are okay, the sets look rock-like, but something is not documentary true about those days. I was there and this fake sex and drugs was not fake in 73. In film, the era is sanitized for paying customers, my teens and the nostalgic baby boomers.  Penny Lane is sure nice for a really bad girl.  Read the screenplay and it's as good as the movie.  Hats off to Camereon.",1092873600,3,933,4.3468208092485545
1281949,5,B00003CXMG,"In order to understand this movie you actually just need to read it's soundtrack's lyrics. This movie is based on music, this movie revolves around music, this movie lives on it`s music. One might have the impression that the movie's makers had an easy one producing this movie, because never again did us humans have such a creative Phase as towards the end of the sixties, and the music makes this movie what it is. Anyhow, as we see on MTV every day, Music's effect on us is even bigger when it has a good music-video. Probably songs like ""America"" by Simon and Garfunkel , ""Sparks"" by the legendary The Who, ""That's the way"" by hard rock giants Led Zeppelin and ahead of all ""Tiny Dancer"" by Elton John wouldn't  give you the creeps as much without the movie being so damn good.

""Blue Jean Baby, L.A. Lady, seamstress for the Band.  Pretty eyed ,pirate smile, you'll marry a music man"". Elton John's classic ""Tiny Dancer"" is about a girl in the sixties , a groupie. She was a Ballerina when she was young, but she decided ,as so many other girls did at that time to dedicate herself fully to ""sex ,drugs and Rock'n'Roll"" and to travel around with one of the much promising bands throughout the country from one festival to the other, from one arena to the other, from one booze-up and from one bed to the  next. Producer Cameron Crowe gives his ""Tiny Dancer"" the name of Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). She believes to be better than the ""regular"" Groupie, she actually doesn't consider herself to be one, but as someone who loves music and for this reason spends so much time with the band called ""Stillwater"". Indeed also she's just one of the toys available to play with for the band and the crew, especially for self-proclaimed band leader Russel Hammond (Billy Crudup) to sweeten the straining tour throughout the country. Joining them on their journey is the film's main character William Miller (Peter Fugit). He's actually one of the uncool kids as critic-mogul Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) tells him, but he knows everything about modern music and is very ambitous to become one of the big time music- critics. Against his mother Elaine's will (Frances McDormand) he joins ""Stillwater"" in order of the Rolling Stone Magazine. This actuality lets some of the band members have doubts in the boy ,the are scared that he might cause harm to their career by writing a negative report about them. Only Russel has trust in him and takes care of him, as well as Penny Lane. William becomes the first one to know her real name and they form a close friendship but to his annoyance she spends most of her nights with Russel ,which puts him in an odd situation. It comes to an embittered conflict in which William fights for his credibility towards the other band members, a battle against time and external pressure from the Rolling Stone bosses and a fight for Penny Lane's dignity and her love. On the other side stands the awareness on the fact that he's way to young for this situation, he's only fifteen,  that he should actually be doing his high school graduation that year (he skipped several classes when he was younger) and that he should become a lawyer, as his mother demands of him. She plays an important role in this context. A woman who's sickly anxious about her son's well being and prays every day that he's in good hands, a woman who has already been abandoned by her husband an her older daughter and who is about to loose the only person she has. Frances McDormand acts her role very convincingly with a lot of heart and passion. She knows how to express the sixtie's parent's fears. But she aswell has to accept that the times they are a changin and her son is changing ,too. Patrick Fugit has a great film-debut and embodies the uncool genius with the advantage of being loved by everyone he meets. The entire cast of the movie did a great job in expressing the time's feelings and emotions but the greatest contribution is done by the music. This movie has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in hollywood and gives you the creeps in many parts of the movie. It even reaches musical character when the entire tour bus starts singing ""Tiny Dancer"", after a huge clash between the band members , which immediatley lets the ice melt again.

And the times have changed again, but have they changed to the better? The times of the groupies are over, but is that a positive cognition? It was rebellious, it was a battle, it was escape, it was better than doing nothing.",1092528000,,4504,4.5818858560794045

You also get to hear him getting the runaround while on tour with the Abe Smellman Group - a band with no appeal, no talent, no existence. The highlight of this band's creativity is when the lead guitarist drops acid and announces, ""I am a golden god!"" The movie is more or less This is Spinal Tap, with a fifteen year old journalist thrown in... oh yes, and a sixteen year old groupie who bangs all the rockers. That's wholesome, isn't it?

It is one of those films where you know there are flaws here and there, but it is so utterly engrossing and the tone is so perfect you forget that there are moments when there should have been more drama, but it was toned down for inexplicable reasons.

This is one of my shorter reviews, but really, there isn't much you can say except:

-Kate Hudson was mysteriously intoxicating. You believed every guy wanted her.
-Frances McDromand made you feel sorry for her despite some unnecessary strictness. And she was hilarious.
-If you find rock awesome (like I do), you'll appreciate this portrait of the genre, the bands and the fans, and what drives it all.
-The writing was often clever and involving, if a little on the lighter side (sometimes, not for the best).

There is nothing left to say except...well...have fun!",1089849600,4,883,4.683870967741935
1281952,5,B00003CXMG,"I got this director's cut edition because I so was so intrigued by the original theatrical release.  I wanted more.
What I didn't expect was how very the new material (typically extended scenes though there are a few new scenes as well) changed the tone and feel of this film. Penny Lane comes across as a tragic, lost soul. Stillwater comes across as a bunch of debauched, spoiled, poorly educated, brain challenged musicians. The ""suits"" - including the Rolling Stone ""hippy suits"" - come across as sharks. William Miller comes across as a well intentioned but naive quick learner. He seems vulnerable.  Alot of the ackward mysteries of the theatrical release (How did Lester Bangs and William end up at a pizza joint after they had just said good-bye?  Why did Russell deny everything after encouraging William to write what he wanted to?  What held Stillwater together after those shocking confessions on the plane? There are many other examples.)
It almost like a different film!  In fact, a BETTER film I would have to say.
Further, based on my experience in the music industry I found this director's cut to be more reality than fantasy -- the inverse was true of the theatrical release from my perspective. It's STILL not at a ""documentary"" level but, hey, this isn't suppose to be a horror flick is it?
Also, I know it's kind of whacky (maybe I'm a brain challenged musician too) but I really dig Stillwater's music.  I have been listening to the Stillwater CD that comes in the package since I got it.  I agree with Cameron Crowe, if these guys toured I would go see them!  The movie is great but this CD (filled with songs by Nancy Wilson of Heart and Peter Frampton) really cooks.

just the coming of age tale he wanted to tell for a long time, it is the crowning achievement that not only vastly impressed critics, but it also vasly impressed audiences as well. This is
an autobiographical account of Crowe's early days, working as a
teenage reporter for Rolling Stone magazine, in which we are introduced to his alter ego, which is 15 year old William Miller
(Played by newcomer Patrick Fugit), who gets introduced by rock
music from his spiritual older sister Anita (Zooey Deschanel). Following this and the overprotective attitude of his mother (Played by the always entertaining Francis McDormand), William
Miller goes on the road to interview the band Stillwater who is
headed by the lead guitarist (Billy Crudup), from then on he starts to travel with these people and meets an upbeat and very
beautiful road groupie named Penny Lane, who is played by the
always gorgeous Kate Hudson, who not only gives a breakthrough
performance, but delivers the performance of her career. I will
stop talking here, just see this wonderful wonderful movie. Filmmaker Cameron Crowe may have been put on the map by Say Any-
thing and Jerry Maguire, but it is Almost Famous that is his
main crowning achievement and to prove it, he won a more than
well deserved oscar for best original screenplay. Francis McDor-
mand won a well deserved oscar nomination for best supporting
actress. However it is the talent and gorgeous Kate Hudson who
steals the show as rock groupie and wallflower Penny Lane. She
was so great shw should have won the best supporting actress oscar. However Marcia Gay Harden won instead for her brilliant
performance in Pollock, but I would have given Marcia Gay Harden
the oscar for her performance in Mystic River instead. This movie is a must-see film. Long Live the 21st century, I love the 21st century including it's movies, internet, DVD's, music,
and Cable TV.

1282011,3,B00003CXMG,"Whew. It's not often that I run across a film that is extremely annoying, yet also impossible to turn off. Yet, much like an Old Navy commercial, this film fits into this rare category.
There's something pre-9/11 about this movie's tone; some sort of vacuous innocence that wouldn't work in a movie made today. This gives the film an unintended shading of dated nostalgia, which is somewhat ironic, because the movie itself is about nostalgia.
How annoying is Kate Hudson? How bad of an actress is she? How many grains of sand are there on the beach; how many stars are in the night sky? Let's just say that, without her winning place in the genetic lottery, she would never have been given her role in this movie (or indeed, any other American film).
The editor of ""Cream Magazine"" is played in a nail-bitingly irritating manner; he'll remind you of any local, overweight, fifty-ish, burnout guys you may know who perform comic roles in your local community theatre and who can't stop talking about Iggy Pop. However, this may simply be superb acting on the part of the performer who plays the character, maybe the editor of ""Cream Magazine"" back then WAS a really annoying person; who can say?
Now, let's say you love the band Procol Harum, and you love the band Heart, jamming around with headphones on, blasting their music as you clean your trailer. Then, you will not find this movie annoying at all; in fact, you will love it.
The rest of us mortals -- well, let me put it this way: when you get to the part where they are all singing ""Tiny Dancer"" on the tour bus with tears in their eyes, you will long to press the ""off"" button on your DVD player. However, some unwashed ghost of 70's rock will prevent you from doing so, and you will find yourself somehow watching this inane film until the bitter end (and somehow sort of liking it, too).",1088035200,3,1850,4.541916167664671

i cant vouch for its authenticity but you want to believe its all true...who wouldnt want to run away with a rock band..live among the stars and fall in love with Penny Lane..even for a short time..the movie shows the ups and downs of a touring band trying to make it big..in the still some-what innocent times of the 1970's. humor, tears, and hey even a happy ending..just a great movie for anyone who loves music..the dvd has great extras too the deleted scene with ""air-drumming"" to stairway to heaven is absolutely hysterical.",1086825600,2,650,4.612068965517241

1282014,3,B00003CXMG,"A good movie about rock, ""Almost Famous"" is also one of Cameron Crowe`s best efforts to date. Focusing the daily tribulations of fictional band Stillwater, this story intends to give a scoop into the backstage of the music world, focusing the band members` relationships, the contrived press connections, the groupies` appeal and the extremely difficuld career in the music business. Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson shine as the young, innocent and passionate teen couple who is discovering life through music and must face a new and complex world that forces them to make hard choices. ""Almost Famous"" is clearly a labour of love, since everyone seems to be enjoying what they`re doing, and the fact that some elements are based on Cameron Crowe`s experiences also helps. Enjoyable and bittersweet, offering strong acting, direction and music, this movie is a worthwile cinematic experience that doesn`t quite change the world but makes it look like a better place.

1282015,5,B00003CXMG,"""Almost Famous"" takes place in the early seventies and is a depiction of William Miller's experiences on the rock n' roll rollercoaster.
William has just scored a job with Rolling Stone magazine which leads him on the road with rock band Stillwater.
They go from town to town accompanied by their groupie band-aids such as the loveable but naive Penny Lane.
Penny Lane is crazy in love with Stillwater guitarrist Russell but Russell is only in it for the thrill.
William goes thru heck trying to get his story from Stillwater due to their reluctance to open their soul to a Rolling Stone writer who they call ""The Enemy"".
William is assisted  in his times of frustration by his mentor and co ""uncool"" writer Lester Bangs played lovingly by Phillip Hoffman.
Lester believes that rock n' roll is on its last legs in 1972..
If only Lester could see how pathetic rock n' roll is today...

Anyway, William turns out to be one of the few real and ""cool"" people in the end because he sees how denial can lead to heartbreak and he's the only one there to save Penny Lane from her demise.
I tell you that this movie is one heck of a ride with a soundtrack that will have you singing your heart out especially when ""Tiny Dancer"" comes blasting out on the tour bus!
The entire cast brings to life their characters with inspiring memorable abandon especially William's unconventional but loveable mom played winningly by Frances Mcdormand and director Cameron Crowe creates an authentic 1970's rock n' roll atmosphere coated with nostalgia and sensitivity that results in a most compelling and touching film experience.

But it's the word-play and the situations that these fine actors find themselves in that propells the film forward.  The script is so sharp, in fact, that many times during the movie I felt some of the actors had a hard time keeping up.  Don't take that as a negative criticism because screenplays are rarely this well-written with such a huge cast as its centerpiece.  It just doesn't come together all the time.  I should not forget to mention the outstanding soundtrack, which I'm sure was hand-picked by Cameron Crowe.  He is notorious for his films having fantastic soundtracks.  ""Singles,"" for instance.

1282086,5,B00003CXMG,"This movie is a semi-autobiography of how Cameron Crowe (director of Almost Famous) got started as a rock journalist.
It all begins in the Christmas of 1969 in San Diego (complete with the Chimpmunks singing ""Christmas Don't Be Late"" in the background), where 11 year old William Miller finds out an embarassing secret and his rebellious older sister Anita (Zooey Deschanel) leaves home to see the country.  She leaves him her record collection with a note ""Light a candle while listening to Tommy and you will see your future.""  Cut to 1973, William (Patrick Fugit) turns 15 and aspires to interview some rock bands, with his semi-understandably protective mother (Frances McDonald) as the reluctant chauffer.  Here he befriends the charismatic ""band aid"" Penny Lane, whom he naturally grows to have a crush on (Kate Hudson) and the rock band Stillwater against rock critic Lester Bangs'(played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) advice.  William and Penny wind up on tour with the band, with William trying hard to get interviews with each member with little success.  Lead singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) is in love with fame (""Make me look cool, man!"") and Russell the guitarist just wants everything to be ""real, man!""  Based loosely on the adventures of the Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin (""I'm a golden god!""), William sees the rise and near falls of Stillwater firsthand. Meanwhile, Mrs. Miller wants her son William home.  ""Rock stars have kidnapped my son!"" she exclaims, while attempting to teach college students.
Then, of course, there's the music- The Who's ""Sparks"", Simon and Garfunkel's ""America"", The Guess Who's ""Albert Flasher"", Neil Young's ""Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,"" Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" and ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"", Stevie Wonder's ""Cherie Amour"", Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"", Yes' ""Your Move"", Deep Purple's ""Burn"" (which came out in 1974), Zeppelin's ""Rain Song"", ""That's the Way"" and ""Tangerine"" and closing with the Beach Boys' surrealistic ""Feel Flows.""
If you really liked the movie, I cannot recommend The Bootleg Cut enough.  In addition to the movie (both the director's cut and the cinema version), there are outtakes (one features William trying to defend that music is art with ""Stairway to Heaven"" in which you provide the musical soundtrack yourself!), the Stillwater concert in its entirety, Cameron Crowe's comments on some of his favorite albums of the 1970's, some of Crowe's interviews with Zep, Fleetwood Mac, Allman Bros and a CD of Stillwater's songs (written by Peter Frampton, Nancy Wilson and Cameron Crowe).  Last but not least is an introspective commentary given by Mr. Crowe (with support of his mother!).  If you liked classic rock and have yet to see Almost Famous, to paraphrase a line from a Stillwater song ""you have to be there!""",1076976000,3,2796,5.138766519823789

1282088,5,B00003CXMG,"""Almost Famous"" is one of the best films that I've seen in a long time.  Cameron Crowe masterfully comes up with a semi-autobiographical story about a boy named William, who gets the ultimate chance of a lifetime: go on tour with a rising rock band, and write about it for Rolling Stone Magazine.  On his adventure with the band (Stillwater), he meets people that change his life completely and help him come of age.  The movie is funny and moving at the same time, and if you're a music freak, than I think that helps make the experience even better.  Besides having a perfect cast, the soundtrack is also great, featuring songs by Elton John, The Who, Led Zeppelin, and many others.  Buy it, it's awesome.",1075593600,,707,4.579365079365079
1282089,5,B00003CXMG,"'Almost Famous' is one of the most reviewed products on Amazon.com -- 463 at the time of writing this.  And that should come as no great surprise.  The movie is about a fan who writes reviews and makes it big.  How close is that to the aspirations of Amazon reviewers?!
'Almost Famous' was written from the heart, coming largely from Cameron Crowe's own experience.  Having toured with Led Zep and the Allman Brothers, and ended up marrying Nancy Wilson from Heart, Crowe seemed pre-destined to conjure this masterpiece.  It is hard to imagine him ever bettering this work.
Without bettering the original theatre release, the Director's Edition gives us an extended glimpse into the lives of the characters, and introduces us to a few more, such as the stoned DJ who slumbers during his interview with Stillwater.  These extra 35 minutes are the main bonus, if, like me, you already have the single-disk version.
There is a 'B-Sides Featurette' which frankly is a shamble, as Crowe admits, although it ends in rock video style with a Stillwater sung this time by Nancy Wilson.
Crowe's critique of the Top 10 albums of 1973 is lamentable.  His selection is OK, even though he overlooks Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' and Steely Dan's 'Countdown to Ecstasy'.  But Crowe's explanation of why his top ten were such great LPs is so brief and so anodyne.  We would expect rathermore fom a regular Rolling Stone contributor.
Which brings us to the Lester Bangs interviews.  Despite slamming into several British bands in these clips -- Roxy Music, Jethro Tull, and ELP -- Lester was a cult figure in the UK in the 70s, through his writings for 'Sounds' and the NME.  And actually, in all his observations presented on this DVD, he gets it precisely right: Bryan Ferry was vapid, Jethro Tull never should have included a rabbit in Passion Play, and ELP were emotionally distant.
But ultimately this extended DVD just provides us with more justification for judging it to be a magnificent feel-good film.  There are many bits of fantastic dialogue -- e.g. ""Of course I'm at home.  I'm always at home.  I'm uncool."" -- without getting bogged down in the argot of the day.  ""It's all happening"" is repeated several times as a signature to avoid ever having to use ""Far out"" or ""Way out"" etc.
Where this wins as a feel-good movie is that a lot of smiling goes on.  (If this were a movie about a British band, it would be a constant stream of sullen expressions, interrupted by the occasional knife-fight between members of the band.)
And I still think one of the coolest images ever is of the band and its retinue, just after the revelatory electric storm, walking towards the camera in the tunnel at the airport terminal.  The lead singer, who looks like a cross between Free's Paul Rodgers and Roxy's Phil Manzanera, has just the right degree of disturbed swagger.  It's just so ... cool!",1075075200,3,2884,4.722554890219561

I won't try to get too eloquent or elaborate and I'll try to keep things simple. The film, as many Cameron Crowe films are, is about many things.  On the surface it's about music and love, but dig deeper and you'll find so much more. I originally thought that I enjoyed the film so much because as a pseudo-journalist myself, I could relate to a lot of the issues as a film.  But really, this is a film that everyone can relate to. If it's not one thing, it's another. Kate Hudson does a terrific job of playing the ""one who got away"" - the first love that everyone's got and everyone thinks back to over a warm beer on a boring day.  Frances McDormand was robbed of an Oscar for her role as the loving yet overprotective mother who only wants her kids to grow up right but has them both leaving home at early ages. The scene where she's one the phone with William in the kitchen and after he hangs up she throws the phone to the floor is classic.  In fact, there are so many scenes in this movie that are classic - Penny Lane dancing to Cat Stevens in an empty concert hall; a late night conversation between William and Lester Bangs about the perils of being ""uncool""; William revealing to Penny how she was ""traded"" from Stillwater to another band I could go on and on, but I'll spare you.",1073001600,,1425,4.205128205128205

I was so very happy to see Anna Paquin's character in a few more scenes, because I didn't ever think her character was explored enough.

1282092,4,B00003CXMG,"A tale of a young boy, William Miller, who lies about his age and finds a way to interview rockstars for Rolling Stones magazine.  Along the way he finds himself immersed (""imbedded""?) into the counterculture of rock n' roll.  No longer a journalist, he now is one of the band--sort of.  While he does not play with the band, you get a sense that little Miller is overwhelmed with joy at the prospect at following the band into their VIP hideaways--including hotels, houses, bars--everywhere.
The movie also provides an aspiring message to those who aspire to reach the heights of their career--whatever it may be: if you truly have the talent, it really has nothing to do with age or experience.  In America, the story tells us, merit is what is important.  Who cares if the boy is 15?  He's able to carry out the duties of someone twice his age.  Yet in our society we typically would choose the more experienced or older person.  That is the wrong approach . . . instead, choose the best person for the job.  An aspiring movie.

While this is a semi-fictional account of an up and coming band starting to make waves and a loving homage to the music of Cameron Crowe's youth, many have questioned it's authenticity. You people are totally missing the point! This is a film made for music junkies like me who smile everytime we recognize a song (the movie is chock-full of those moments)and for those who were actually around during that magical era in music. Moments like Stillwater taking to the stage and ripping into ""Fever Dog"" or sitting around thier hotel strumming guitars and drinking with their women are classic!

William is a 15 year old who wants to become a critic and he catches up with a rock n roll band StillWater and travels with them while he talks with his mom and she gives him details to not take drugs.

And Penny tries to kill herself after Russ introduces his wife to her, and that is when William tells Penny that he is in love with her. Then the band tells Rolling Stone that the story William is trying to get published is 98% lies. So William goes home and the band is about to break up when Russ confirms that every word of the review was true. And Russ tries to talk to Penny and get her Address so they can meet and make things right, and PEnny ends up giving Russ Williams address instead. And so the story goes.

1282210,5,B00003CXMG,"I had the awful feeling that I was going to hate this movie when I popped in this DVD for my inaugural look at the film. But my initial apprehension toward the picture vaporized almost instantly upon watching the film's first scene.

I couldn't believe how much I liked this movie.  In my view, Director/Producer/Writer Cameron Crowe has done the near-impossible with this motion picture.  That being: He's taken a group of people that could have been so easily looked down upon and intensely disliked, and instead turned this assorted band of musicians, groupies, mothers, sisters, and rock-n-roll managers into some of the most interesting and fun-to-watch individuals ever to share a movie set together.

Add to this mix one very likeable-right-off-the-bat young 15-year-old would-be music journalist (played to perfection by Patrick Fugit), and what you have in your midst is a highly-entertaining movie about ambition, music, a devoted mother's love, soul-searching, friendships, and chasing dreams.

Every scene in this film is a memorable one. The whole movie feels ""real"", in this writer's opinion. Nothing seems faked, or phonied, or Hollywoodized. A reason for this, of course, is in large part due to the fact that the film is a great deal auto-biographical, with Fugit portraying Crowe when Cameron was a teenaged writer for Rolling Stone Magazine.

And while it's rated ""R"" (for language and drug content), the film never once bogs itself down with the cliched rock band negativity of drugs, sex, and booze.  Sure, these elements are shown through Mr. Crowe's camera lens; but it's never displayed in such a way as to be a turnoff.  If this film were in the form of a book, it would indeed be described as a real ""page turner"".  The viewer anxiously awaits the next ""page"" (scene).

There are two scenes in this film that are true ""set pieces"" in my mind (and after just seeing the movie one time).  One such piece occurs as the fictional band with which our talented young ""Rolling Stone"" journalist (""William Miller"") is travelling encounters severe turbulence on an airplane flight taking the group to its next concert date.  As the severe thunderstorm batters the plane to the point where all aboard are nearly convinced they'll soon be meeting an untimely demise, one by one the passengers begin to confess their inner-most secrets and indiscretions. This fabulous scene is at the same time comical, bittersweet, and poignant.  As the aircraft finally breaks free of the turbulent air, much to the delight of the exuberant pilots, our band of passengers is too mentally drained from the confessions they've just offered up to each other to join in the celebration of the fact that they are, in fact, going to survive the ordeal.  The scene concludes comically with a member of the group, who has just informed everyone of a dark secret concerning sexual orientation, slamming the cockpit door closed to silence the cheers of the pilots.  Great, great scene!

Another highly-memorable portion of the film takes place on the band's tour bus.  Elton John can be heard on the bus radio, singing ""Tiny Dancer"".  Gradually, the vehicle is filled with singing, as everyone begins joining Elton in belting out the tune.  This scene is one to play over and over again, as the feeling of togetherness and harmony fills the bus at that moment.

The DVD presentation here is as flawless as the film contained on the disc.  Picture quality is exceptional via the nice 1.85:1 Widescreen Anamorphic transfer. And the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack is definitely robust enough to give those speakers a nice workout, especially during the many musical numbers heard throughout the movie.

There's an adequate Making-Of featurette included as well, which contains several photos of a young Cameron Crowe ""on the road"" as a Rolling Stone scribe.

For anyone who hasn't seen this picture who might be thinking (as I did before viewing it) that this is a movie filled with loud, obnoxious, cocaine-snorting booze-heads and the less-than-desirable environs that people of that ilk generally inhabit, let me assure you that ""Almost Famous"" will pleasantly surprise you.

These characters are well-written, never ""over the top"", and totally engaging from the first chapter of this DVD until the last.

It immediately has zoomed into my Top 25 of all-time favorite flicks!

I still can't believe how truly good this movie is.  It's one that could easily be viewed time and again, and enjoyed just as much with each successive screening.",1066003200,,4536,5.029411764705882

Which is why I swooned throughout the entire movie the very first time I saw it, falling in love with each of the characters (Penny Lane especially, for her motherly concern for the well being of others, her fragile facade of iron will while being so obviously soft, and her unbelievably real sweetness). Penny Lane is a falling leaf in this film, beautiful and fragile and adrift on the changing winds of other's emotions. Yet, behind this exquisite frailty lies a masked strength of character and an almost regretful understanding of ""when and where the real world occurs.""
I found it only fitting, then, that the movie ended on my favorite song -- Zeppelin's underrated ""Rain Song."" I feel this is perfectly appropriate for the scene, for its underappreciated beauty and time-capsule capture of that one fleeting sense of drifting away from innocence and daydreams, wanting to hold on, yet understanding and saying goodbye anyway... and trying to understand you were better for the experience. Now, when I hear this song, I envision the scene of the weary kiss blown from the fingers a tired fan as she watches the tour bus drive away into the morning, Penny Lane skirting the desolate and littered post-concert grounds with a rose and a smile, spinning on a napkin, and the innocent, unabashed brown love gaze of William Miller through the colored scarves of the band-aides.
I can watch this movie a million times and I would give it as many stars if I could. One of the best quotes: ""The only currency in this bankrupt world are the things we share with each other when we're uncool.""
Superb movie. Perfect casting. Perfect soundtrack. Heart-wrenching cinemetography and acting. There's nothing else to say.",1065052800,6,1949,4.803571428571429

It is a story of a somewhat small town boy with a mother who wount cut the umbilical cord, and a sister who left because of the mom. He gets all his sisters albums when she leaves and decides he waqnts to be a writer for a music magazine, he gets an awesome assignment to go on tour with this 'Allman Brothers/Aerosmith' sounding band and writes this amazing artical for Rolling Stone, and has all of his hopes and dreams crushed to the ground before him in a matter of seconds.

1282213,5,B00003CXMG,"This is a perfect film.  However, to review it and add nothing. . .adds nothing.  So, let me say that amidst all of the rightfully glowing praise this movie has received, let me add this: this film is the greatest depiction of mother-son love ever displayed in cinema.  The bond between young William and his ""wise"" sage of a mother is the true heart and soul of this story.  It is interesting that Cameron Crowe is such a fan of ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""  That film is the best father-son (and daughter) film ever.  Both stories spring (ultimately) from the realization that a parent has to let their child experience life--as painful and exacting as that realization is to the parent.  Both stories demonstrate the deep admiration we all have (or should have) to parents standing up to the conventions of the times (racism or consumerism).  William is ""allowed"" to enter into his journey by a mother forever providing advice (""Don't use drugs!"") and ""meaning well.""  The ensuing phone calls from the road and scenes with the glorious Frances McDormand are priceless.  The scene where McDormand sees her son after his ""trip"" is Oscar worthy--look at her love and relief that he's. . . HOME.  Further, her dressing down of Billy Crudup's character is one of the funniest scenes in any film (""ye-yes, ma'am."")
There are so many wonderful scenes in this film and the acting is superb. The ensemble is as good as any I've seen.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the lonely, uncool mentor is perfect.  Jason Lee as the egomaniacal (but ultimately vapid) lead singer is pulled off with aplomb.  Billy Crudup as the ""soul"" of rock and roll is the best.  This guy will win an Oscar someday though ""his looks are becoming a problem!""
But ultimately, it comes back again and again to me as this:  watch this film and bear witness to the most difficult thing any of us have to do in our lives as a matter of course--watch our children grow up and become independent of us, their parents.

1282216,4,B00003CXMG,"The film ""Almost Famous"" is a Cameron Crowe and Dream Works Home Entertainment movie.  Cameron Crowe has won an Oscar for best screenplay for this movie and he has been nominated for an Oscar for ""Jerry Maguire"".  This movie was released in 2001 and is approximately one hour and eighty-five minutes in length.
 This is a drama about a 15-year-old boy named William Miller (Patrick Fugit) who wants to be a journalist for Rolling Stone Magazine.  Miller meets with a ""Band-aid"" named Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) who introduces him to the band Stillwater.  While writing an article about the band, Miller befriends the guitarist Russell (Billy Crudup).  Both Russell and Miller fall in love with Penny Lane and it hurts their friendship.  Now Miller has to write an article for Rolling Stone without letting his feelings get in the way.
 I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates Rock `n Roll.  I thought that Kate Hudson did a great acting job as Penny Lane.  She was both believable and fun to watch.  The story line was good as well.  It showed a back stage glimpse at the lives of rock stars in the early to mid 70's.  The soundtrack to this movie is important as well because it compliments certain scenes such as in the bus when they are listening to Elton John after they were all in a big fight.  I would give this film 4 and a half stars",1059955200,,1355,4.545454545454546
1282313,5,B00003CXMG,"Is Cameron Crowe a genius or what?  Not only has he brought us the likes of 'Singles' and 'Jerry Maguire' (I'm forgiving him 'Vanilla Sky'), and now 'Almost Famous'.  I have had this movie on VHS for a couple years and had been wanting to buy it on DVD when I saw that this 'Bootleg' version had been released.  I now own it and must say it is well worth the price (if you like the movie, that is).  I thoroughly enjoyed watching the 'Director's Cut' of the movie...I couldn't believe how much stuff was added - you definitely get a lot more insight into some of the characters.  The cast is great - Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand are brilliant - I also really like Jason Lee's character, he's good for a lot of the movie's laughs.  Not to mention the soundtrack to this movie is great, although I know a lot of the movie's best songs are not on the soundtrack CD (the one that stood out for me was Elton John's 'Mona Lisas & Mad Hatters' - not on the CD).  With the bootleg version of this DVD you get both versions of the movies (theatrical release and director's cut), a Stillwater CD with 5 or 6 previously unreleased songs on it and lots of bonus features, including an interview with the real Lester Bangs (portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is excellent).  If you like this movie you would love the insight that this DVD brings!  GET IT!",1058832000,3,1353,4.337301587301587
1282314,5,B00003CXMG,"This is one of the best movies released in 2000.  Cameron Crowe amazingly reflects on his times as a writer while traveling with legendary bands(Led Zeppelin, Allman Brothers, The Eagles, etc.).  He takes certain events that occurred during each tour and gives it to the movie's band.  Every piece of that fits perfectly amongst one another to create one masterpiece movie.  It's great that Crowe can make some of those serious events and put some comedy in them. Therefore, he was well-deserving of his Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay.
 Patrick Fugit makes a triumphant debut as William Miller.  If he continues to do movies in this style, he'll go far with his acting career.  Why did Marcia Gay Harden win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress(""Pollock"") over Kate Hudson as ""Penny Lane""?  Who knows.  Frances McDormand performs wonderfully outside her usual style as William Miller's overprotective mother.  This is Billy Crudup and Jason Lee at their best as the lead guitarist and lead singer of Stillwater.  Though Fairuza Balk and Anna Paquin had minor roles as band aids, their acting shined.  This is one of Paquin's best roles since her Oscar winning role(at the age of 11) in ""The Piano"".
 ""Almost Famous"" could be a huge influence for those who dream of making the big-time in music, any genre.  This is also a good one for those who are looking for quality comedy.  There are many surprises so one will laugh unexpectedly in various parts.  Why wasn't it nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture or Best Director for 2000?  Who knows.",1058227200,,1555,4.85171102661597
1282315,4,B00003CXMG,"I love this film. And it's not only because Cameron Crowe and I are close in age so we grew up during the same time, but the cast for this film was well selected and the film is well shot. The music, both the scoring and the period pieces, are great choices and in the case of the score well produced.
Almost Famous depicts a time in our/my lives when everything not only seemed possible but those same things took on some mystical sense which Cameron is quite able to depict because he was there.
Not enough can be said of Cameron's experience in these matters. He was in the right place at the right time to see, hear and appreciate all those things he used in this film.
Yes, there was a war on but our awareness of it was not always taken over by the politics surrounding it. This films captures the joy it was to see and be with a rock group that was growing in popularity and status.
But back to the film itself. As I said a good cast that was well thought out. It doesn't always happen that the right people play the right parts. All to often an actor or an actress gets by in a part but only because the vehicle is good and not because of their part in it. In this case though the players fit the rolls they're assigned to and play them very well. It also doesn't hurt that Kate Hudson has her mother's adorable smile and giggle or that Billy Crudup did a spectacular job with his role as does Patrick Fugit, Frances McDormand, Jason Lee and everyone else.
The appropriate venues were used and the depiction of products, vehicles, music gear and clothes were all very well done. Nothing seemed to be out of place. The language used in the screenplay was very good and (dare I say it) right on.
There are a few questionable edits and some small continuity problems but I only was aware of them after multiple viewings.
A great film depicting a time that, although, has been seen before in film was never as well played out as it is in this film.",1057276800,,1952,4.25

1282317,5,B00003CXMG,"As I was born in the 1980s, I can only check out the era of blossoming rock'n'roll (Rolling Stones, the Doors, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin) through books and movies. ""Almost Famous,"" a semi-autobiographical movie about the 1970s rock scene, gives a glimpse of the life of a young reporter (based on Crowe himself). A must-see for music fans!
When William's sister (Zooey Deschanel) left home, she gave him her collection of records: the Who, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, and many others. When William (Patrick Fugit) is fifteen he manages to get a writing assignment with Creem, and then with Rolling Stone magazine to write about the rising rock band Stillwater (think a mixture of the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin). William falls in with the Stillwater guys and their circle of adoring groupies, including an effervescent blonde, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).
Despite the displeasure of his controlling but loving mom (she claims adolescence is a marketing ploy), William accompanies Stillwater across the country. He keeps trying to get an interview with guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), but Russell is too busy partying with Penny and diving off rooftops (literally) to give William his material. But some alarming incidents show William that the drugs, sex and rock'n'roll are only a veneer for what really matters.
""Almost Famous"" is a fantastic mixture of expose and tribute -- there's music, there's romance, there's comedy. There isn't a lot of pratfall humor, although there is some (Anna Paquin running smack into a cement wall); the scene on the airplane where everyone confesses their sins is fantastic (Ed's only line is hysterically anticlimactic). We get to see inter-band conflict (who's the star?), groupies, rock journalism, and the unfortunate aftereffects for groupies. Yet the sort-of-romance between Penny and William is very sweet, rooted in genuine affection.
Both the glamour and the grit is shown here. The dialogue sparkles (""Last words: I dig music... I'M ON DRUGS!"", ""Forgive me Father, for I may sin tonight,"" ""I'm about to boldly go where... many men have gone before""), and the direction is superb -- it cuts forward just when it needs to; the camera follows people out onto the dizzying stage and then zooms in for intimate close-ups. Nowhere else could a stomach-pumping scene actually contain an element of romance.
Patrick Fugit is a surprisingly solid lead, with a sort of wide-eyed innocence that contrasts sharply with everyone else. Kate Hudson plays a sweet groupie who doesn't practice what she preaches (""Never take it seriously, you never get hurt."") and falls in love with Russell -- only to get tossed away. Her fragile ""why doesn't he love me?"" is one of the best lines in the movie. Billy Crudup has disarming charm and selfishness as Russell; Anna Paquin is very funny as one of Penny's groupie pals (""Don't worry, he's still a virgin""); Jason Lee is likably grumpy as Jeff Bebe, and Frances McDormand is fantastic as Fugit's weird mother.
Music lovers and rock aficionados will love ""Almost Famous,"" a bittersweet coming-of-age comedy/drama/music movie. A rare treat. When and where does this ""real world"" occur?",1054425600,4,3175,5.143133462282399

Full of great extras, two different versions of the film, some cool easter eggs and wonderful commentary, this is a perfect DVD set.  First off, the movie is wonderful- it really did not get the attention it deserved when it came out.  The acting, writing, soundtrack- all wonderful.  Every performance is wonderful- not a weak actor in the film though I have to give a special nod to Philip Seymour Hoffman as rock critic Lester Bangs- just a great fit.  Based on Director Cameron Crowe's life as a teen writing for Rolling Stone in the 1970's- the movie has a gentle touch to it with a delightful love story and a fair amount of laughs.  The sound (both Dolby Digital and DTS) is great as is the picture quality.  The extras are many and the disappointments few.  Crowe's mom rocks as she watches a part of her life on the screen.  This is a fun package. This is a DVD that should be part of the collection of anyone who enjoys good movies and the potential fulfilled of a great DVD package.

1282319,5,B00003CXMG,"Writer/director Cameron Crowe digs into his past and comes up with a rose-colored gem in Almost Famous, a touching and entertaining trip that rolls along through the wild rock scene of the 1970s. This semi-autobiographical story follows the coming-of-age of William Miller, a teenage prodigy journalist who lands an assignment for Rolling Stone magazine, and chronicles the depth of emotion that happens in a love affair with rock-and-roll.
Patrick Fugit plays the young protagonist, a smarter-than-his-age music geek whose sister (Zooey Deschanel) promises he'll be cool someday. Someday comes when William is taken in by the ""band aids"" (otherwise known as groupies) at a Black Sabbath concert and gets swept up in the circus of life on the road, despite the strong reservations of his overprotective mother (a feisty and funny Frances McDormand). Crowe distills his early experiences with the Allman Brothers Band and Led Zeppelin into Stillwater, a fictitious Midwestern band embarking on its first major tour. Guiding William by phone is Lester Bangs, the legendary Creem magazine critic who tells him ""don't make friends with the rock stars."" William does of course, and in his exuberance, falls for the angelic and mysterious band aid, Penny Lane, whom Kate Hudson plays with a rapturous combination of playful passion and vulnerability.
William soon realizes that the music is not the only affair happening on tour. Penny Lane is enamored with Stillwater's guitarist, Russell Hammond (played with a troubling mix of charm and selfishness by Billy Crudup), and William becomes a go-between for the pair. Although the film tends to shy away from the truly darker parts of the era, the characters uncover in sweet and more personal moments the various shades of honesty and reality that are part of being an adult. It helps that the wonderfully-written dialogue also manages to avoid much of the saccharine tart that has stolen the emotional cred of some of Crowe's past movies, namely Jerry Maguire.
But what is most impressive about Almost Famous is the fact that none of its many characters get lost in the mix. Each is thoroughly drawn and played with gusto, from Stillwater's prickly lead singer (Jason Lee) who refers to William as ""the Enemy,"" to the manic and outspoken Lester Bangs, through whom Phillip Seymour Hoffman shows his seemingly unending range by countering Fugit's innocence and energy with a jaded razor wit.

Finally, no review of a Cameron Crowe movie would be complete without mentioning the soundtrack. This is a movie about the 70s after all, and the music takes center-stage throughout. When the band sings along to Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" on their tour bus, it becomes the emotional benchmark of the film. It is also a scene that could easily be considered an attempt at coy filler in the hands of another director. But Crowe asks the audience to simply listen and experience the bond that occurs when music gets a hold of you.",1049673600,,2964,5.073770491803279

1282402,4,B00003CXMG,"They really need to put a .5-spot in the scale, because this movie would be a 4.5.  It's not quite perfect enough to receive a 5 star rank, but it's better than just plain 4 stars.  Either way, this movie is awesome from star to finish.
I look at a director like Cameron Crowe and wonder why more people have not heard of him.  From his 1996 blockbuster hit ""Jerry Maguire"" to his newest movie: ""Vanilla Sky"", he seems to be on a role; or at least good at directing them.  This movie tells the story of the 70's little-known rock band Stillwater.  It's a brilliant story that at many points trys to include you in the movie.  First time actor Patrick Fugit could not have played the part of a fan/writer any better.  He's stellar, and you can't help but fall in love with him.  Oh, that innocence.  We also see appearances by the famous (or infamous, which ever you prefer) 'Penny Lane', played by the beautiful, yet cute, Kate Hudson.  And if you know anything about the actual band, this movie strikes new hope into the based-on-a-true-stories era that never really amounts to much.  The two main stars of the band,  Russell Hammond (played by Billy Crudup) and Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) work wonders with each other, even if they are just fighting throughout the movie.
And as you see, the cast is just piling up with stars.  Along with Crudup, Hudson, Fugit, and Lee (who, by the way, stars in Cameron Crowes mentioned film ""Vanilla Sky"") we have SNL star Jimmy Fallon and an underrated Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Philip plays the part of ""Lester Bangs""; rock and roll star by way of musical taste.  All in all every part is covered, and covered well.
I can't imagine why anyone who likes rock music, great movies, or a combination of both, wouldn't like this movie.  It's an awesome storyline that is as dramatic as it is funny.  Don't miss this movie; it is--hands down--the best movie of 2000.",1044230400,,1894,4.523529411764706
1282403,5,B00003CXMG,"'Untitled' would be it. I liked 'Almost Famous' a lot when it came out in the theater. It's a coming-of-age/road movie about loving rock 'n' roll and trying to not grow up. Other reviews have been written about the film's plot, etc., so I'll focus on this specific DVD. After watching the long, unreleased version, it's clear that this is the labor of love Cameron Crowe intended to make. I like 'Singles', 'Jerry Maguire' and 'Say Anything' a lot, but I like this movie more. I would have paid full price twice to sit in the theater for the extra half-hour. Here's what you get in this DVD that you didn't get in the theatrical release: more continuity in the story line, deleted scenes that really add to the characters, a hilarious scene with the band and Tenacious D's KG as a mind-tripping DJ and enough extras to keep you entertained for an entire sick day - music, behind-the-scenes stuff, commentary (I ran it in subtitles, no extra audio, but I think you can actually listen to Cameron Crowe and his mother talk if you want to) and if you like to read on your television, Rolling Stone articles by Cameron Crowe, as well as the film script. The DVD also provides a new way to have fun with your copy of 'Stairway to Heaven.' If you like good '70s-era rock music (Allman Bros., Led Zep, The Who, Elton John), this is definitely worth checking out.",1043798400,,1355,4.512195121951219

The Director's edition is worth the extra money.  It has the theatrical version as well as an extended Director's cut, which I found worthwhile.  They're both good movies, but the director's cut spends more character time and I like the characters enough that I will probably watch the longer version by default.
This one lives up to the billing as a Special Edition.  It not only has two versions, but great commentary by Crowe and his actual mother.  Crowe's mother only had one criticism of the mother character in the movie, and it was surprising what she chose to dislike.
Other extras include Cameron's picks as top of albums of 1973, some short vintage interviews with Lester Bangs, a CD of Stillwater music, some rehearsal footage and other tidbits.",1043020800,2,980,4.635838150289017
1282406,5,B00003CXMG,"I guess it goes without saying that history is best told by those who lived and participated within it. It's never been more true than in Almost Famous, Cameron Crowe's film of a young journalist who gets sucked into the rock world, much like happened to Crowe in his teenage years. The film is a sentimental treat, even for those who didn't exist in the early '70s when it took place.
William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is incredibly youthful looking for his class and soon learns why when he's told he's been skipped ahead a few times. His overprotective single mother (Frances McDormand) has finally driven his sister to leave home, but her one gift to William is the record collection she's been hiding from their mother. William's life is never the same as the likes of Bob Dylan and the Who navigate his life down a new, exciting path.
While in high school William sends his writings out to various publications, gaining the attention of legendary critic Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) of Creem Magazine. He schools William in the art of rock writing and reminds him that they are firstly not cool, secondly are to avoid becoming friends of the rock stars because it will destroy all sincerity of his writing, and lastly to watch out for big time magazines like Rollingstone who will end up editing up his stories. Rollingstone Magazine has taken notice of Mr. Miller and they offer to send him on the road with the band Stillwater if he'll get their story.
Here's where all seems to go wrong. William quickly becomes friends of the lead guitarist of Stillwater, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), as well as Russell's mistress of the road, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). The trouble William soon runs into not only trying to get his information and interviews but attempting to balance his journalist duties and his friendships is the bulk of the story and what ends up attaching us not only to William, but Penny and Russell as well. William knows he could make or break Stillwater but doesn't want to alienate the band or his magazine.
Every sequence is filled with love, compassion, confusion of youth, and humanity. William is only 15 and he's trying to be this adult he's not ready to be yet. He's trying to make sure he doesn't get used by the band while trying to figure out why Penny can't see she's ultimately being used by Russell. William and Russell's relationship is one based on trust that they know when each is in their professional or friends mode and their actions and words jump around based on who is functioning as what. William and Penny's relationship is just as complex, they confide in each other all the things they can't with Russell and the band.
As good as the central actors are, it's the supporting cast that steals the show. McDormand is flat out amazing as the worried mother who constantly is trying to keep track of her son a thousand miles away who she says has been kidnapped by rock stars. Hoffman is every bit the legendary Lester Bangs who is William's sole calming influence and his words are truer than William could have known as he sees all too well his protg was suckered by the rock lifestyle.
It's apparent Crowe would not have given up his experiences in the rock and roll world as a youngster up for anything. Throughout the film the one thing that everyone, no matter if they're on each other's side or not, can agree on is that music can make a difference and when they're having troubles music is the one thing that can bring them back together.",1042934400,3,3500,4.646774193548387

Everybody who has seen the movie already knows what a great rock n roll movie it is, possibly the best. anyone who has not seen it yet should simply because this is a classic.",1042761600,3,738,4.556390977443609

1282410,5,B00003CXMG,"Wow, how do you review a movie like Almost Famous? Let me just say it is one of my all time favourites. Almost famous is about a boy who wants to be a rock critic in 1973. The kids got extreme talent for a fifteen year old, but is growing up in a time when Rock and Roll is being bought out. He gets an assignment from a critic named Lester Bangs from Cream magazine to interview Black Sabbath after a local concert, but the bouncer won't accept his pass. So he waits along with a group of girls who call themselves band-aids. Anyways, one of the head band-aids is Penny Lane. The girls get in with a band and promise to find him a pass. completely out of hope he sees a bus pull up and out steps Still Water, late as usual. At first they won't talk to him because he's a critic, but he proves that he's a fan above all and they befriend him. Later her gets a call from the Rolling Stone magazine and pretending to be older he gets a job. He chooses Stillwater as the band he interviews and follows them around, but ends up joining the party more than writing about it. He also falls in love with Penny Lane, but she loves the lead singer. This movie gives off great vibes and is the basis for great music.",1040688000,,1206,4.0928270042194095

Gems like this only come from the pen of Cameron Crowe and while this is the type of movie that everyone will love, you'll feel the passion if you're in on the same music fan wavelength that Crowe is.
There are several touching scenes; Crowe takes some soulful rock & roll tunes and sets them to scenes that he always knew deserves to be played out to. It's like when you play a song, you have a picture of a scene, a setting, a situation that it plays to, and Crowe makes that come to life.",1038700800,,610,4.177966101694915

1282531,4,B00003CXMG,"This movie is one about coming of age through change.  It follows three main characters:  a young writer for Rolling Stone, the leader of a Led Zeppelin-like band in the 70's, and a beautiful groupie.
Each person is faced with intense highs and terrible tragedies at the hands of the others throughout the story.  The strength of the movie is that, instead of shoehorning the characters into roles and making them tragic heroes, it instead makes the events change them.  By the end, it's the Rock hero that looks up to the writer, the suicidal groupie that mothers the other two into an understanding, and the aspiring writer who fails at writing but still finds his dream.
A huge part of the movie is probably the soundtrack, a collection of original works and the best soaring rock of the 1970's.
Excellent movie.  Even when it falls into the trap of being saccharine, it at least avoids seeming contrived.  I would recommend it to any nostalgic baby boomer, confused teenager, or wild gen-Xer.",1037232000,,996,4.761627906976744

1282533,4,B00003CXMG,"If you look closely, you can see the arc of Cameron Crowe's films as they mirror his own journey from precocious adolescent (FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, SAY ANYTHING, SINGLES) to successful professional (JERRY MAGUIRE), with music always marking the trail he has taken. Now a successful 40-something, Crowe does what we all do at that stage. He looks backwards, with longing. And so, in ALMOST FAMOUS, he offers us a loving reflection on his youth and the music that lit the way. With this picture, Crowe does the impossible. he makes us nostalgic for the 70s. Somehow, thanks to Crowe, the era has taken on that burnished glow that only memory can endow.
Crowe starts his film with credits... not an unusual technique. Except these credits are being written in pencil on a yellow note pad by a disembodied hand. The hand writes out each name, even misspelling `Frances McDormand' then erasing the error and fixing it. The credits have not even finished and I already love this movie. This in not some generic, Hollywood story, measured and sliced with a cookie-cutter called `market research.' This is a personal story being told by somebody. And a young somebody, to boot. inexperienced, but gamely writing as fast as he can, fixing his mistakes along the way. If the credits are this good, what will the movie be like, I wonder.
Crowe was a teenager who wrote Rock criticism for Rolling Stone magazine in the 70s, before his FAST TIMES adventure. It is that period of his life that provides the basis for the movie's plot.
Cast as the young Crowe is Patrick Fugit. He is Crowe as a decent, nerdy, talented boy (called William), who is barely surviving his loving, overbearing mother. As mom, Frances McDormand is simultaneously unnerving and endearing in her Oscar nominated performance. William's loving but irritating big sister clashes with mom and sis takes off with her boyfriend to become a stewardess. In an effort to save him from mom's influence, sis leaves behind her record collection. That pile of vinyl opens up a whole new universe for William. He is an `un-cool' high school kid, isolated and in pain, father-less, sister-less. but Rock n Roll becomes his world and his salvation.
William becomes a writer, precociously penning music criticism for local papers. He is befriended by the burned-out editor of Creem Magazine, Lester Bangs, brilliantly played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman creates a curmudgeonly mentor for William, a sort of ghost of Christmas-yet-to-be, ranting that `Rock is dead' and providing other such heartening insights, while also giving him a willing ear and an encouraging word. Though based on an actual figure, Hoffman's Les Bangs is an original film creation. a Rock prophet-guru-nerd who, seeing his end in sight as he slouches toward Bethlehem, can't help but try to pass the torch.
William is offered the chance to cover a touring band on the rise (the group a bit preciously named `Stillwater') for Rolling Stone magazine by an unsuspecting editor that doesn't know the kid is only 15. William joins the tour while his worried mother screams to anyone who'll listen that `musicians have kidnapped my son!' She has only let him go because she knows how much he needs this adventure, yet she is deathly afraid of losing her last child. Upon boarding the tour bus, young William/Cameron journeys like Dante into the inferno. He is doggedly pursued by worried messages from mom and accompanied only by his yellow note pad, his long-distance calls to mentor Bangs, and the `Stillwater' family that teaches him about who he is and who he can become. Still waters run deep, indeed.
One of his Virgils is the band's enigmatic guitarist, Russell, brought to vivid life in actor Billy Crudup's breakthrough performance as the Rock n Roll hero with feet of clay. The other is the siren Penny Lane, the beautiful free spirit who, as a `band-aid', acts as both muse and sex toy for Crudup. She is ephemeral and damaged, living in devotion to the music. Of course, the Russell-Kate-William triangle is an eternal one, resulting in pain and growth for all concerned. Kate Hudson's Penny Lane is a magical character, and it's a star-making performance, worthy of her Oscar.
But the key, supporting player in Crowe's tale is the music. There is a moment in the movie when everyone is on the bus, and it has been a long, bad night. Emotions are frayed. The mood is fragile. Elton John's song `Tiny Dancer' is heard and, one at a time, everyone starts to sing along. Music heals. Families can injure, but they can heal, too. Like his earlier films, music is the heart and soul of this film, both in the dramatic moments and concert scenes, dramatizing the effect on both the players and the audience as together they create, for a moment, a surrogate family for all who need one.
It seems at first a small story to build a movie on. Nothing blows up. The sex is mostly off-screen. Like all of Crowe's other pictures, ALMOST FAMOUS is a character study in the coming-of-age genre. But, when seen through the context of his career to date, you realize it's about Crowe coming of age, as much as the characters in the film.
Unlike film-school filmmakers, Crowe doesn't make films about films. He makes movies about life. And so, he tells stories about us. They are stories worth telling and he tells them wonderfully well. Like all of Crowe's other films, ALMOST FAMOUS is a tale both personal and universal. It made me reconsider the era I grew up in, and the person I was then and am today. goddamn him. That's the power of a great storyteller and, make no mistake, Crowe is perhaps the foremost auteur of his generation.",1034553600,4,5659,4.805128205128205
1282534,5,B00003CXMG,"This movie is a must to view more than once--there are nuances that might be missed with the first viewing.  Though the subject is set decades ago, Almost Famous has a fresh, 21st century slant to it.  The scene in the plane is just too hilarious to describe!",1033344000,,259,4.375
1282535,5,B00003CXMG,"This DVD has left my utterly speechless. It is so good, the extra's so in-line with the movie, the menues so fitting, and the commentary so entertaining that I can't say enough good things about it. But let's start with the movie itself.
There are two version of the movie included here. The original ""theatrical"" release, which is roughly 2 hours, and the ""bootlegged"" extended release, shown here for the first time. This version of the movie adds 40 minutes worth of scenes. Both versions are excellent, but since the ""bootlegged"" release (or ""untitled"", as it's called) is simply more of what made the original so good, the same comments can more or less be applied to both. Note that the ""Untitled"" version is ultimately far superior, but if you haven't seen either you will be just as well off (if not better off, for that matter) watching the shorter version first.
It would be easy to describe Almost Famous as a time-piece, ""a movie about Rock and Roll"". And while it certainly is that (a movie about Rock and Roll), the connotations that come with such a description would limit the emotional power of this film drastically. It is just as easily a movie about family, a movie about love, a movie about money, and a movie about music in general. What ties this all together is, for lack of a better word, ""magic"". Sure, I could go in and analyze what makes this ""magic"": the cinematography (by mastermind John Toll) that makes a movie about Rock and Roll seem like a historical epic. The aching music, compiled (and at times even scored) by director Cameron Crowe and his wife. The innocent yet extremely subtle acting. Sets and costumes that are so good you quickly forget you are watching a movie. This ""magic"" is demonstrated in any number of emotional scenes; it is what ties the movie together, holds it on-course, helps it maintain it's vision.
In one of the best composed scenes in the movie, the band has just talked to a new manager who wants them to hire him. He represents everything that was going wrong with Rock & Roll in the early 70's (and indeed still today): bands loosing touch with thier fans/roots, sacrificing art for money, popularity over content. After he leaves, there is an uncomfortable silence. Finally the drummer says, ""I miss him already"". The scene cuts to Penny Lane, our main ""groupie"" in the tale, dancing over the stadium of what was but a night before a concert all. In the background we hear Cat Stevens achingly singing ""The Wind"". The magic and energy of the concert that is now gone, part of the past, can still be felt in the air. Penny literally dances with it. The contrast between the band selling out and Penny, thier biggest fan, basking in the bliss of what makes music so powerful, is moving beyond words. Even if you have never had any interest in rock (or music, for that matter), you will still be appreciate how real some of these scenes are. Cameron Crowes eye for detail is at times frightning.
The extras on the DVD are really nice, and since half the fun is discovering them yourself I'll leave that to you. The commentary is worth noting, however. It is between Cameron and his mother, Alice. It is easily the warmest Commentary I have ever heard.
In short, this is highly worth the price. In my opinion really a standard for how DVD's aught to be made.",1033257600,11,3321,4.602023608768971
1282536,5,B00003CXMG,"~Set in San Diego in the early 1970s, Almost Famous subtly introduces the element of rock'n'roll music as a venue for freedom. Finding moral support in the lyrics of Simon & Garfunkel, 18-year-old Anita (Zooey Deschanel) rebels against her conservative mother Elaine (Frances McDormand). Deciding to leave home, she urges her younger brother William to let himself be influenced by the music of the era. Over the years, William (Patrick Fugit) develops an interest and befriends legendary music critic~~ Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman: Flawless, Magnolia, The Talented Mr. Ripley), who asks him to cover a Black Sabbath concert for ""Creem"" magazine. His article earns the mature-sounding 15-year-old an assignment from Rolling Stone magazine to join the more accessible ""Stillwater"" band and interview lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and lead singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) during their ""Almost Famous"" concert tour. Postponing his obligations at school and at home,~~ William develops emotional ties with the band and with the coquettish groupie Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), and discovers the contradictions of being a subjective journalist.
Almost Famous constructs its plot with effective time constraints which create suspense and establish the film's sense of humor. This is explored within the arena of William's responsibilities toward his editor (who thinks the writer he has hired over the phone is much older) and his mother (who wishes her boy is mature~~ enough to resist peer pressure and drugs, but young enough to obey her). Both the editor and the mother, who require that William constantly check back with them and who impose deadlines (to submit the article outline or to return home), communicate with the protagonist via the phone throughout most of the film. Still, rather than interrupt the boy's tour/trip with the band, the editor/mother interludes emphasize the main character's inability to escape from duty. The comedy rises from~~ William's efforts to be seen as a free adult --a status the band members claim to have reached-- while he struggles with his evident inexperience. Never quite reaching a dramatic point, Almost Famous maintains a comfortable level of seriousness as it explores the main character's doubts and decisions in relation to his role as ""The Enemy"", or the critic who ""writes what he sees."" Not letting his perceptions be influenced by the illusion of friendship, nor letting them deny the validity~~ of his subjective reality, the protagonist finds freedom in those attempts that ""almost"" fail or ""almost succeed"". In this sense, Almost Famous finds a temperate --almost happy-- middle ground in its treatment of such commonly temperamental issues as sex, drugs and rock'n'roll.
Special Edition DVD Release: December 4th, 2001 (as Almost Famous: Untitled) Cameron Crowe spoke at length with The Hollywood Reporter about it: ""The DVD version is a whole cut of the movie, a different,~~ fatter cut. It's about two hours and 45 minutes, something like that, and it has the full Stillwater [...] concert stuff. It has Frances McDormand's character, Elaine, listening to [Led Zeppelin's] ""Stairway to Heaven"" in its entirety, and you at home have to put on ""Stairway to Heaven."" The DVD version of that scene will just have the longer version, because Led Zeppelin will never sell the rights to ""Stairway to Heaven,"" you at home get to supply it from your own music~~ collection.""
Also there are 2 hidden extra scenes where Kate Hudson and Patrick are doing the bus scene over and over again. Another cut scene is where Kate says the name ""leslie"" over and over again, for literally 5 minutes.~",1031875200,5,3657,5.231686541737649
1282655,5,B00003CXMG,"It is an old literature axiom that all good fiction is autobiographical, meaning of course that among other things, writing believably and well about any subject requires not only knowing something about it but understanding it as well. That this idea has merit is substantiated by this remarkable period piece both written and directed by Cameron Crowe. As he did in his quite captivating original screenplay for ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"", he mines his personal background with an uncanny ear for realistic situations, dialogue, and personal experience to pull us deep into the quirky and sometimes surrealistic world of sixties rock
The protagonist of the film is a teen-something reporter for Rolling Stone magazine, and like Crowe, has an eyes-wide-open view of everything swirling around him, from sex, drugs and rock and roll to all the happenings associated with the rock and roll lifestyle itself. One finds William (newcomer Patrick Fugit) sucked into the vortex of a fictitious rock band's pulsating experience, and the moment to moment happenings surrounding Stillwater are so realistic, believable, and palpable that we roll along with it all, finding too much to remember from what we recall of the sixties. Also excellent are the ensemble of supposed Stillwater rock musicians, from Billy Crudup to Jason Lee, and the very lovely Kate Hudson showing her future potential as a leading lady in a powerful and convincing role here.
This is the closest any of us are likely to come to living vicariously in a rock and roll band. The fact is that Cameron Crowe actually did experience a lot of what goes down here himself as a sixteen year old reporter, and the verve and energy in the film owes to this authentic recollection of those times, and to his uncanny ear for all the elements of the rock scene. This is a terrific movie, and although it is fiction, is also quite representative of the times it purports to describe. Enjoy!",1031616000,5,1947,4.957186544342508
1282656,5,B00003CXMG,"There's little I can say that hasn't already been said by multiple reviewers.
 Almost Famous is now one of my all time favourite film's.  Cameron Crowe's screenplay is a beautiful thing.  Very funny and deeply moving.
Billy Crudup, Patrick Fugit, Frances McDormand, Jason Lee, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Kate Hudson are all terrific.
How Crowe could follow this up with the terrible Vanilla Sky is still one of the biggest mysteries of modern cinema.",1031184000,7,451,5.0675675675675675
1282657,5,B00003CXMG,"This film is good on many levels.  Overall, I think the film gives us the image of coming of age, reaching that understanding of who we are and where we want to go.
On one level, there are the three main characters who all must come to grips with the life they think they are living and the life they need to live.  The main character, William, is an uncool rock journalist.  He is younger than other kids in his grade at school, and probably too young to travel with the band.  He believes he is cool because that is how the band makes him feel.  After submitting his story, he begins to realize that what he thought about himself was not true.  His mentor helps him come to the realization.
Penny Lane, the Band Aide, must also grow as a person.  She has her idealized life, but doesn't understand her place and importance.  After finding out that she has been ""traded"" and having William attack her dream of a far-off land, she realizes that she must move on.
Russell, the guitarist, is trying to understand his place in the band as the leader and as a better musician.  He thinks that he will have what he wants with no repercussions.  He hurts Penny and thinks that he can correct this.  Her getting him with William shows him that he has responsibilities as a person and musician.
On the next level, the rock band, Stillwater, is the quintessential band coming at the end of a generation of musicians.  The life they want is no longer there; the scene of rock and roll is progressing, and they must learn to adapt.  The idealized notions they have will hit the wall once they hear of the article on them.  Afterwards, they must mature to continue.
This is a fine movie, and I would highly recommend seeing it.  It is witty and serious at the same time.",1030320000,2,1758,4.382716049382716
1282658,5,B00003CXMG,I loved this movie when I saw it at the theater.  I also had a lot of questions about the story and the characters.  Crowe answers all in the bootleg dvd.  The uncut version of the film is excellent and explains the relationship between Penny Lane and Russell much better.  Excellent entertainment and I highly recommend it to any fan of Kate Hudson's or Goldie Hawn.,1030233600,,367,4.515151515151516
1282659,2,B00003CXMG,I just don't get it. This movie was MAYBE good. People treat Crowe like he is the Second Coming after this flick.,1028678400,,113,4.181818181818182
1282660,4,B00003CXMG,"Roll back the 70s: a teenaged reporter who writes reviews for  underground rock-mag Creem gets a sudden break when he's employed by big-league-mag Rolling Stone to go on the road with up and coming Stillwater and deliver a report on them.
  During a wild 3 weeks on the road he (and we) sees the inside of rock n' roll of that era. All the elements are there. The 70's looks and attires, the drugs, the music (original songs written among others by P.Frampton and Cameron Crowe), the teeny ""rebellions"", the inner band strifes,the groupies and the developing rock industry, the then societal pulse, and the overall atmosphere set by the film's main characters, most notably the teen-reporter, star-groupie Penny Lane and of course the band members and last but not least the boy's ""crypto-conservative"" desperately-trying-to-be-progressive mother.
  ""Almost famous"" is a brilliant film. Before you can even begin to care whether what the film depicts is accurate, you find yourself laughing endlessly, and being ""sucked-in"" by a story that at times has semi-documentary touches (makes sense, as the story is a semi-biographical account of Cameron Crowe's) and loving the main characters (all charismatic in their own sense).
  The film's main ""weapon"" is its superb humor. I don't merely mean one-liners but the overall feeling it has, you don't only laugh but this movie tends to have a feel-good sense all over it as well. It's supposed to, right? After all, this is the 70s when everything still had a ""purpose"" or when things seemed to be more upbeat (compare with the prozac ridden 90s and their ""nowhere to go from here"" sentiment).
  All the actors do a terrific job to make the time machine work here. The mother is great in portaying a representative of the mothers generation that first perceived music as an ""enemy"" and as a gateway to drugs and (oh my god) wild sex. The band members are going from cool to uncool all the time (as real band members very often do) as they try to act like rock stars (""make us look cool, man"") and at the same time try to maintain their human nature (...). The teeny reporter (in my opinion the least convincing of the lot) is decent too while the show is stolen by the enigmatic and pivotal character of groupie Penny Lane. She's is the one character that the others actually revolve around like satellites whether they realise it or not and also serves as a solid reminder of that period as well ( or maybe, not only of that period, in fact, why is rock music being mostly made if not to be ""cool and get chicks"")..
  The dialogue is great, the directing is great, the actors do a great job. Anything missing from Almost Famous to keep it from being a classic?? I would think not, but: because of the way this film works and of its very nature ppl will tend to see it as somewhat of a documentary. Is it? Tough question that one.
  The rock era of the 70s wasn't a monodimensional one. It wasn't only about bands that were Led Zepellin lookalikes and people who  were constantly professing ""it's all happening man"", and above all things were not always that lighthearted. In fact, a lot of people back then thought that there was a musical revolution going on which was going to -in turn- bring about an overall change of things. Ask anyone who's over 45 whether the music of that era did bring about a revolution and get prepared for some really long discussions with very differing conclusions.  Inotherwords, there were very many people around back then who took the whole thing very VERY seriously. Perhaps that is -epidermically- depicted by the rock critic in the film.
  It would be unfair though to criticize the film on that premise. After all you cant expect a film to fit in all that in 2 hours. And even if it somehow had done that it could've very easily been boring albeit more accurate.
  The fact of the matter is that ""Almost Famous"" is a wonderful film in very many respects. It goes from hilariously funny to touching with its dripping nostalgia. And yes it does have this ""things were better and purer back then"" feeling to it, but in the end the way people perceive the times they live in depend on very many different factors.
  I've seen this movie twice already and loved it both times and i hardly see how anyone could not love it actually no matter what other thoughts are to be had on the side.
  Almost famous is almost perfect",1028160000,7,4401,4.62853470437018
1282661,5,B00003CXMG,"There's a moment early on in ""Untitled"", Cameron Crowe's 'Bootleg' Director's Cut of ""Almost Famous"", where rock critic Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), in mid-rant, claims that the Box Tops' ""The Letter"" says more in less than two minutes, without even trying, than Jethro Tull can say in hours, while trying their damndest.  It got me thinking: why didn't Crowe take his own advice?  Why did he take a perfectly serviceable 122-minute movie that appeared to say everything, and turn it into a 162-minute movie?  Well, I've seen ""Untitled"".  It blows up ""Almost Famous"", makes it spectacle and spectacular, while never losing its intimate edge.
This is a case where more of a good thing doesn't turn into too much of a good thing.
What do you get with ""Untitled""?  Well, more character.  Backstories are fleshed out, relationships are better defined, and the humanity becomes more human.  We see William's (Patrick Fugit) kleptomania, along with more examples of how his youth made him an outcast.  We get Penny Lane's (Kate Hudson) nurturing side, explicitly portrayed.  And we get a full-on glimpse of Jeff Bebe's (Jason Lee) envy, why it started and how it manifests itself.  A couple of full scenes are added, most notably a radio station appearance that's terribly funny, albeit irrelevant to the plot.  But most of the additional footage comes from existing scenes being lengthened.  More often than not, the point is clarified without boring the audience with tediousness.
The audio commentary begins with Cameron Crowe outlining the two paths they might go down.  The first is the hemming-and-hawing path, where all the truths are covered up, in favour of banal stories and technical information.  The second path is the heart-on-your-sleeve path, where all the inspirations and backstories are owned up to, where mistakes are agonized over, and the truth is king.  If you've ever seen a Cameron Crowe movie, or heard the man speak more than two sentences, you'll know which path he chooses.
Crowe dominates the track.  He's joined by a couple of execs (or PA's or something; they're never really introduced and don't say much).  But the real treat of the track is the inclusion of one Mrs. Alice Crowe, Cameron's mom (and Frances McDormand's doppelganger).  Besides being a doting mother, and quick to offer praise for her son, she also offers some real insights into the genesis of the film.  She appears to know the movie backwards and forwards, and acts as further proof of the film's accuracy.  It's amazing to see how much of the movie was really based on actual events.  Every scene appears to begin with either Cameron or Alice being taken aback by the memories it invokes.
This is probably one of the best commentary tracks I've heard, for the inclusion, in equal measure, of technical information, on set anecdotes, and passion.
Also included on Disc One is real life video footage of an interview with Lester Bangs.  Lester's vitriol is palpable, his menacing nature is enormous, but his warmth shines through.  It's an interesting tidbit, in that it offers further proof that Hoffman is one of the greatest actors working today, for he doesn't stoop to imitating Lester.  It's more like channeling.  Then, Cameron includes a list -- complete with fully-represented album covers -- of his top albums of 1973 (the year the film is set).  An interesting curiosity.  Some of the works actually inform specific scenes from the film, which is kind of a neat trick.  They've also put together a ""video"" for the Stillwater song ""Love Comes and Goes"", which is basically a montage of behind-the-scenes moments from the Rock Camp the actors had to go through.  More of this can bee seen on ""B-Sides"", another video montage.  Most interesting is the inclusion of seven of Crowe's Rolling Stone articles from the era, printed in their entirety.  It's not hard to see the nascent voice of Crowe the filmmaker shining through these passion-filled pieces.
Disc Two has a lot less going for it.  Its main feature is the original theatrical version of the movie.  Also included is the full-length (15 minutes or so) Cleveland Concert, parts of which we see in the movie.  Despite the fact that Billy Crudup sometimes plays notes not actually in the songs, and that Jason Lee still has to work on his between song banter, this footage shows just how well the actors did in achieving their collective band persona.  The music's not that great, but the vibe, captured by on-stage camera work, is authentic.  The Production Notes section is basically the same essay you'll find in the box's liner notes, only with additional information.  There's an interesting little video moment, with Pete Droge and Elaine Summers singing ""Small Time Blues"" in a Hyatt House hotel room.  It's a moment quickly passed by in the actual movie.  But here you get to hear the whole song, from William's voyeuristic point-of-view, and it's just stunningly beautiful.  You can also scroll through Crowe's screenplay, peruse the cast and crew bios, and watch the theatrical trailer.
Disc Three is an audio CD.  It's got the six Stillwater songs, written variously by Nancy Wilson, Cameron Crowe, and Peter Frampton, among others.  They're not very good songs, and I'm not sure they fit the era they're supposed to come from, but for an ""Almost Famous"" completist, like myself, it's neat to have them in all their (sub-)glory.
A lot of effort was put into making this set look like a real bootleg, the kind of clandestine little document you'd pick up at a seedy record store.  I think the look and feel enhance the movie.  Which was pretty good to begin with.",1026864000,117,5645,4.921775898520084

(A loser boy that's into rock and roll lands a job with a rock and roll magazine and interviews Led Zepplin wanabes. Plus he meets this sterotypical wild girl that has sex with him plus with a few other girls in the room.) Doesn't that story sound very familar? BORING! Been there. Done that.

1282663,5,B00003CXMG,"This director's edition of ""Almost Famous"" is one of the best DVDs on the market. ""Almost Famous"" is Cameron Crowe's autobiographical story about a teen-aged reporter on the road with a rock and roll band. The character that Crowe based on himself is William Miller (well played by Patrick Fugit). A reporter for his high school newspaper, the unpopular William dreams of writing for a rock and roll publication. He gets his big chance when he meets his idol, rock reporter Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, in a great supporting role). Bangs tells William to write an interview for Cream Magazine.  That interview (with Black Sabbath) does not happen, but he meets the opening act, Stillwater.  Soon, Wlliam finds himself on the road with Stillwater, with an assignment to write an article about  them for Rolling Stone.  William is befriended by groupie Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, who deservedly won a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination), whose boyfriend is the band's lead guitarist (Billy Crudup). What follows is William's sometimes funny and sometimes painful experiences with life on the road. He becomes friends with the band and falls in love with Penny, all while trying to write an objective article for the magazine. It is hard for him to stay objective about his new friends. As Lester observes:""They made you feel cool. And I've met you. You are not cool.""  These situations are all observed with a lot of heart and soul in Cameron Crowe's Oscar winning script.  Frances McDormand adds just the right touch as William's mother, who doesn't understand her son's dreams, but wants to be supportive anyway.  The ""bootleg"" edition DVD is loaded with lots of REALLY COOL extras. The first disc includes a director's cut with 35 extra minutes, including a birthday party scene for Penny, among others. The second disc includes the original film. The package also gives you commentary by Crowe and his mother Alice; behind-the-scenes foootage; unseen Stillwater concert footage; the original shooting script; an interview with Bangs from 1973; Crowe's top 10 albums of 1973; reprints of Crowe's articles for Rolling Stone; even a six track CD of Stillwater's songs. Only ""Fever Dog"" appears on both this CD and the soundtrack album. All the songs on the bonus CD are great. ""Almost Famous"" is one of my favorite movies in recent years. If you are as big a fan of the film as I am, you'll want to get this double disc set. It is a ""must purchase.""",1026000000,15,2458,4.894230769230769

Cameron Crowe's autobiographical film about a young music journalist wannabe who ends up on the road with a rock band is truly brilliant.

1282780,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous is beautifully entertaining and easily sinks into your heart. It's about a young boy, William Miller, who's healthy relationship with his mother is what's keeping him away from the experience of sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll. After his older sister leaves him with her collection of familiar 1970s records and a note explaining that one song by The Who can make him see his future, he grows up and dives into the rock culture of what the world once became. Sooner or later, Lester Bangs, a famous critic for rock music, becomes a mentor and leads William to his dream of living the ultimate behind the scenes life as a flourishing young journalist. Just as William enters the world and finds the true meaning of being on tour, he finds himself overwhelmed hanging out with a fictional hard rock band Stillwater. He also finds himself gorgeously infatuated with the openminded dreamer Penny Lane, a young band aid, which is a false name she takes on, and would never tell a soul.
 As soon as the hardship of the almost famous band and later confessions of secrets uncover, they sit quiet, put things behind them, and grow closer together. They also sing along together to Elton John's Tiny Dancer (a memorable scene). While the tour continues, and William's mother's concerned phone calls continue, William loses his virginity but gains the meaning of what it means to understand and appreciate life in general, and that you can't take the good without taking the bad.
 This movie is a classic instant winner, with a cast that shines, and music that catches you. It's so touching and happy, you'll fall in love with it endlessly.",1022803200,,1641,4.774647887323944

1282782,5,B00003CXMG,"Cameron Crowe, former teenaged rock critic matured into essayist, screenwriter and film director,  created my favorite film of 2000 (tied with ""O Brother Where Art Thou"") by bottling a precious ingredient found in few movies- real magic.
Drawing from his own rich autobiography, Crowe vividly relates the journey of a teenage Odysseus (played here with wide eyed purity by Patrick Fugit) who embarks on a journey of discovery, pain, love, maturation, loss and spiritual awakening.
The magic of Almost Famous lies in its characters' abilities to reach that most heroic of human experience: transformation into a better self.

Fugit plays William Miller, a fifteen year old genius based upon Crowe himself, who is given the impossible task of writing a ""think piece"" in Rolling Stone magazine about a fictitious rock and roll band called Stillwater. Forced to travel the road with the band and their entourage of ""professional girl friends/fans/groupies""- called band-aides here, Miller finds himself caught between staying true to his calling- writing honestly- and betraying new found friends.
Crowe's genius, as previously expressed in his earlier films Say Anything, Jerry Maguire and Singles lies in his ability to craft through careful collaboration with his always superb casts, real people who despite great character flaws and warts, have the spark of goodness inside them. In a Cameron Crowe film, everyone has the chance to be saved- and in their own way- everyone does end up forgiven and transformed.
Unlike many of his cold-hearted, mean spirited and cynical film making peers who actively seek out the sordid, the ugly and the destructive in society, Crowe possesses a sincere love not only for his characters and the world they inhabit but for the audience as well. That love radiates throughout every frame of every film he makes (this does not speak to his misstep ""Vanilla Sky"")
Crowe also possesses an uncanny instinct to marry music with the film. The sequence fusing Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" to a Stillwater's collective forgiveness of Russell Hammond is pure bliss. Of course Crowe creates many other similar sequences with music and image.

This is not to suggest Almost Famous sugarcoats the harsh realities of an early 1970's rock and roll experience. Crowe is too honest a storyteller to allow that.  Free sex, drugs and the related decadence are ever present as are the consequences for such behavior. There is a real general callous soulessness that lurks on the tip of each scene threatening to consume the frail humanity of this Odyssey. But that evil is held at bay and ultimately destroyed by the great good that certainly dwells in every character's heart.
As consistent with all previous Crowe films, the acting ensemble is perfect. She has so many scenes that literally broke my heart while making me smile. Billy Crudup as self obsessed guitarist Russell Hammond, although far too good looking for any real rock star, swings gloriously unpredictable between sullen silence, affable congeniality and rage. He is a star in the making. Jason Lee, as lead singer Jeff Bebe, possesses just the right amount of shallow intellectual posings, narcissistic self promotion and paranoid uncertainty that prevails so many in his vocation. Frances McDormand is absolutely perfect as Miller's hyper-protective Mother.
The director's cut DVD is a God Send. The commentary by Crowe and his mother is priceless as is the fleshed out sequences which manage to humanize and elevate the characters even more. Being able to read the complete script is fascinating also as a reference point. It proves the old addage that all good films must begin with a great script.

Almost Famous is Absolute Magic. Don't miss this one.",1022112000,25,3738,5.151565074135091
1282783,5,B00003CXMG,"I enjoyed this movie from the first time i saw it on video. it is a well acted film and well written film. it is a quasi-autobiographical story of a 15-year-old boy who loves rock and roll and gets to write articles for Rolling Stone magazine. talk about a cool job! the different characters are well rounded, showing their faults as well as their strengths, making them more human than in many other films out there. and for anyone who loves Led Zeppelin or any other 70s rock band, this film is dedicated to you.",1022112000,,514,4.421052631578948
1282784,5,B00003CXMG,"Cameron Crowe is such a meticulous director, the detail in this movie is like stepping into a time machine and going back to the year 1973!  The movie has a lot of feel to it, you are on this roller-coaster ride right along with the main characters from beginning to end.  Jason Lee, as the egotistical but likeable singer, Jeff Bebe, is my favorite.  I'll have to search out more movies with Jason Lee.  I just love that scene where he's wearing his new Jeff Bebe t-shirt (finally, a t-shirt with a big picture of himself on it!), and he's freaking out over William Miller's portrayal of them in Rolling Stone magazine.  This movie goes from hilarious to sad and back again.  I love that.  For anyone who's curious enough, I recommend reading ""Let It Blurt:  the life of Lester Bangs, America's greatest rock critic"" (influence and mentor to Cameron Crow), and ""Rebel Heart""  by Bebe Buell (one of the girls Crowe met while interviewing bands).",1020816000,2,945,4.644578313253012
1282864,5,B00003CXMG,"This is one of those rare films that brings you right back into the 1970's. I was just a kid in that decade, but I saw older kids and younger adults who looked and talked like some of the characters in this film, so the *feel* of the '70's just came back to me as I watched. The excitement, the decadence, the long hair and beards, the earth shoes, and the great rock 'n' roll music that was as thick in the air as the smoke; it was all there in front of me, but somehow most of it eluded me. As a member of 'Generation X', I missed out on all that fun--but also all the excess, the drugs, and the social sicknesses that defined the 'Me Decade'.
This film has all of the above, but this is not merely a time warp.  It tells the story of how a repressed, yearning young boy became inspired to become a rock 'n' roll writer--at the tender age of 15 years old. It made me wish that I had pursued my dreams at that age! Based on writer-director Cameron Crowe's own life, the story of the adventures of young William Miller (played to innocent man-child perfection by Patrick Fugit), as he follows the fictional hard-rock band Stillwater during their romps with groupies, prostitutes, and assorted druggies, held my attention from beginning to end. It made me realize that my life may not have been all fun-and-games even if I HAD pursued my dreams in my teens!
The reason why ALMOST FAMOUS is so wonderful? Let's begin with the excellent, and informative, writing from the pen of Cameron Crowe, who saw it all at such a tender young age. Let's continue on with the well-fleshed-out characters, who are so real and yet always seem to have that magical way of revealing something about themselves in nearly everything they say. Let's conclude with the always-compelling story, which has many twists and turns, yet never feels contrived.
All in all, this film has it all.  Besides the brilliant low-key starring debut of Patrick Fugit, we have a wonderful, fully-realized performance from Billy Crudup (one of the best actors of his generation; look for his first Oscar within the next three years) as ""golden god"" lead guitarist Russell Hammond, who perhaps single-handedly personifies the various changes, and the vices, of the '70's.  Also impressive is the realistic performance of egotistical lead singer Jeff Bebe by Jason Lee.  Of course, no review of ALMOST FAMOUS would be complete without mentioning the star-making performance of Goldie Hawn's beautiful progeny, Kate Hudson, in an extremely well-realized performance as the ultimate rock groupie, Penny Lane.  If you love a great story being told in an incisive, intelligent way with love for its characters who are completely real, then please buy this DVD.  This was one of the five best films of 2000.  MOST RECOMMENDED",1020124800,5,2777,4.71340206185567
1282865,5,B00003CXMG,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in years. Cameron Crowe perfectly captures the entire essence of that not-really -too-long -ago-but-a-lifetime-ago-time. Yes, if you were there (circa early 1970's), this movie will totally fulfill any nostalgic yearnings. It brought back faces & places I hadn't thought about in 30 years. Those fabulous, jewel-bedecked, feathered creatures, standing off to the side of the stage, while Alice Cooper or Black Sabbath blew our minds at ear-splitting volume, I always wondered (and envied) what their lives were like. HOW did THEY get in?? (God, I was dumb.) And even if you weren't(there), the performances are all SO great, that this is the closest you can come to ""being there."" You WILL smell patchouli! Yes, I, like many, very much identify with the un-cool, rock star worshipping 15 year old, ""William"". (I even had that same awful, swept over, un-hair-do!) And was just as naive. We ALL wanted to hit the road, & follow around our favorite band, & this movie ALMOST fulfills that un-fulfilled desire. But it's about so much more. It is also a beautiful coming of age story. I had never seen Kate Hudson before, but from the moment she enters her first scene, you'll be enamored of her beauty, screen prescence, and obvious intelligence beyond her years. I deplore hype, but everything they've said about this actress is true (for once). Her ""Penny Lane"" is much more then a groupie. Really, all the players in this film are great, and there's not a wasted moment. That director Crowe based William on himself is obvious & now well known. How perfect that, in ""real"" life, he got his own rock goddess, in marrying Nancy Wilson, of the fabulous ""Heart"". Dreams really can come true. I haven't seen the un-issued version, but, after reading the reviews of those who have, I plan to. There's really so much to say about this great film, so, just SEE it. I suspect those few who REALLY disliked this film probably went into it with a bug up their...! Ignore them, they have no taste, & probably dress badly. I've seen this about 4 times now, & loved it more at each viewing. I think you will too. So, enjoy one of the best movies made in 2000 (or in many a year.)Just...

1282866,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous portrays a lost age. An age of innocence and of responsibility. An age of happiness and of anger. An age of music and of everything but music.
  It's the early 70's and 15 year old William Miller(Fugit) is infatuated by the immense world of rock and roll music. Such obsession is brought on by an early experience of his sister leaving home, giving him all her albumns(The Who, Led Zeppelin etc) to let the music set him free from his over-protective mother(McDormand).
  Miller follows the example of a cynical battle-hardened music critic Lester Bangs(Hoffman) and his own music reviews get noticed by Rolling Stone magazine. Rolling Stone, unaware of the fact he's 15, sends Miller on tour with ""Stillwater"" a ficticious band that might as well be a real one as it is portrayed expertly without cliches. On the road, he meets Penny Lane(Hudson) Shes not a groupie, shes a band-aid. Penny shows Miller the otherworldness of rock music. She shows him it's heart and soul personified by Stillwater. All the while being checked on by his mother, Miller desperatley tries to get an ever-growing story into Rolling stone on time. A crucial element to said story is an interview with the elusive yet emotional guitarist Russell Hammond(Crudup) The conflicts between the members of the band and the ever-present hysteria of 70's rock and roll bombard Miller in this powerful film with a wonderful pace and brilliant performances. The 70's will never return. This lifestyle will never return. And this film brings it all together to tell us the true story.",1019865600,,1564,4.935361216730038

The next morning I woke up with no ache. And so I thanked God and continued watching film. And... and I think it was one of the best movies Ive seen this year or maybe ever.

A kind of surprise was Lou Reeds Im waiting for the man, I really adore cover-version of this song performed by my favorite singer Vanessa Paradis), great screenplay, great work of all the film's cast. So I want to thank everybody who made this touching, happy and lyrical picture about music, love, life and growing-up. To thank them all.",1019347200,,1121,4.242990654205608
1282868,5,B00003CXMG,"Okay, this is not an analysis of the ""Tiny Dancer"" bus scene; if you want to read about the music of the film, read my review of the soundtrack.  Moving on...
What can be said about Almost Famous that hasn't already been said?  First, this was the first truly great film of the new milennium (I hate Gladiator with a passion, but that's another story).  Second, Caneron Crowe LOVES rock music (hell, he's married to Nancy Wilson).
Third, this is what magic feels like.  It's sun flares in the camera lens as Stillwater and etc. are leaving a truck stop.  It's Kate Hudson dancing in concert trash after the Cleveland show.  It's the Band Aids' scarves dancing in the eyes of Patrick Fugit.  It's Jason Lee's popularity speech.
What this special Untitled Bootleg DVD does is make Almost Famous a universe.  There are two versions of the film: the theatrical version (what you show to people who have not seen the movie) and the ""Untitled"" version, which clocks in at almost three hours. Among the special features are the script (no notes, however. ...), Cameron's fave albums of '73, with commentary, a behind the scenes music video with Nancy Wilson singing.  There is the complete Cleveland show, more songs, the infamous ""Stairway"" scene (supply your own Zeppelin), and three hidden features.  One of them is pure brilliance, Cameron's homage to Truffaut.  If it were included in the theatrical release, Kate Hudson would have won the Oscar. Also included is a wonderful full-length commentary on the Untitled version.  This is, by far, the best commentary I have ever heard. It is like watching the film with Cameron,his mom, and the Vinyl Films production company.  There are insights into his life, how the film was made.  In short, it's a lovely kiss blown to the kiss blown to rock n' roll.  One of the best additions in this package is the bonus third disk with all six of Stillwater's great songs (in acutality, Fever Dog is my least favorite!).  If you didn't know better, you would have thought that they were authentically vinatge.
But what about the movie itself? In my opinion, the best films make you want to do something.  Almost Famous makes some want to go out on the road and either sleep with or write about almost rock stars.  That is too specific.  This film, like Cameron's others (Say Anything, Singles, Jerry Maguire, Vanilla Sky), makes you want to do something great and scary.  William Miller, at fifteen, goes out on the road with a rock band to write a story for Rolling Stone.  Penny Lane goes out on the road with Stillwater because she truly loves the guitarist, although she preaches against falling in love with rock stars.  She wants to encourage him to be great; she wants to help William become great.
While greatness is an ongoing theme in Crowe films, the heart of Almost Famous is (cheesy, but true) a string of love stories.  It is a love story between all of the characters and rock music (clarified by the Untitled cut.  Watch for Russell's cut ""woo"" speech at the San Diego show).  It is a love story between Russell and Penny, complicated by rock politics and the cool factor.  It is a confused love story between William and Penny, one not knowing how to feel about the other.  And it is a family love story; William's mother is embarassing, yet he is never embarassed nor apologetic about her.
This film is a prime example of brilliance in making the specific universal.  We are each a fan of something.  Cameron Crowe is a fan of rock music, but he used that fandom as a flavoring in this beautiful coming of age story.  By the end of the film, each character has grown up.  William is no longer a boy, Mom respects her son's ambition, Russell is more selfless, and Penny... well, she was the most adult person in the film anyway.  She brought the others to her level... she did her job.",1019088000,13,3837,4.6301775147929
1282869,2,B00003CXMG,"This movie was pretty boring. I thought the best scene was during the near plane crash. Jimmy Fallon did a good turn as the supporting character. I could have cared less what happened to the main character as he was way too removed and bit of a [weakling].
Kate Hudson's ""star making perfomance"" seemed to mainly consist of traipsing around with a knowingly annoying smirk. There were some good bits but they were far and few between. Viewers would be better served by viewing any number of documentaries about the Stones or the Who.",1018915200,4,533,4.680851063829787
1282870,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous is Cameron Crowe's third time writing and directing and after Jerry McGuire he has a lot to accomplish here.

This mostly Autobiographical story follows you William, a fifteen year old as he tours with an up and coming 70's rock band for a dream shot at writing for Rolling Stone. After finding out his mother lied to him about his age because he skipped ahead to years in school and didn't understand at 12 why he hadn't hit puberty - because she has let him believe he was 14. Sounds preposterous, yes, but it happened. Much of what you see here really did in some for.

Fictional band Stillwater stands in as a composite of several bands Crowe actually interviewed as a teenager. Lead by Billy Cruduptand Jason Lee (of every Kevin Smith film but Clerks) the band rises, falls and faces reality as William grows up, looses he virginity (to three girls, including Anna Paquin, I think Crowe embellished a bit here?)  and falls in love with the lead guitarist favorite groupie/mistress/girlfriend, a self proclaimed Bandaide played to the hilt by the too-cute-for words Kate Hudson.

The theatrical cut suffered from being too-long without enough character development and humor, this Longer version is better because it adds all the little things that hold a long film together. Simply put, it makes more sense and is more involving with the extra info.

This is a watch it two-or-three times film where you can really notice different plot and character points with repeated viewings. The Commentary with Crowe and Real-life-mom is nearly as entertaining as Francis McDormand's performance as her.

A great movie that might have been an Oscar contender had this complete version been the theatrical release.",1018569600,,1723,4.944636678200692
1282871,5,B00003CXMG,"""Almost Famous"" (2000)
You may not know it, but Cameron Crowe - Almost Famous's director - is in love with music. Almost Famous is based on his experience with Led Zeppelin back in the 1970's, and it is a startling and amazing film that intrigued me with its developed characters and viewpoints of live in its set decade.
Cameron Crowe is really getting on my good side. I loved Jerry Maguire, and thought it was one of the best films of 1996. Almost Famous is very different to Jerry Maguire, and I am thoroughly enjoying the way Crowe is changing his styles. He's done teen movies, romantic comedies and now Almost Famous is his tribute to music, that has a bit of everything - drama, funny and comical scenes and a mysterious romance. Crowe comes off as a natural in his directing department and his writing skills are even better. Crowe also wrote the film, and he shows true talent for bringing his stories to the screen.
The acting in the movie is outstanding. It is headlined by a marvellous cast, including Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee, Frances McDormand, Anna Paquin, Fairuza Balk and newcomer Patrick Fugit. Crudup and Lee are horribly underrated as actors. They gives a very realistic performance of band members struggling on the hard side of rock `n roll and still managing to party on and have a good time. McDormand is now one of my favourite actresses. She just has amazing on-screen presence. Fargo won her Oscar, this one gave her a nomination and in Wonder Boys her underwritten performance was very enjoyable. I strongly recommend seeing how this woman works. Fugit, the newcomer of the actors, is very human and sweet, however hard his character tries to be ""the enemy"", Fugit comes off as just a cutie on the edge of stardom. Hudson will be huge! Also starring in Gossip in 2000, Hudson pulls off a performance like no other actress this year. Her character is mischievous and mysterious, and Hudson is truly a perfectionist in her role. I couldn't imagine seeing anyone play Penny Lane better. Balk and Paquin are pretty much there just to look at, but they have some good scenes, especially Balk, who has a hilarious telephone conversation with William's (Fugit) mother. ""Is this Mary-Anne with the pot?""
The chemistry between Fugit and Hudson is very believable. These two don't come across as 2 people who are meant to be together or anything on the outside, because one is a rock `n roll groupie and the other is a 15 year-old journalist, but because the script really allows you to go deep in Penny and William's souls, you see really these 2 would be hopeless lovers in real life. I'd love to see them do more work together.
The Oscar nominated editing in the film is also a highpoint. The sequences in which the band perform use many techniques and extras to bring the concerts off as believable and exciting. The editing was used particularly in these scenes, but there are also little things you might notice too.
To fully appreciate Almost Famous you have to at least like music a little, and I like music a lot. This movie worked for me on many levels, it had the power to engage me, I had lots of people to care about, and overall I just had a heck of a fun time. Cameron Crowe - welcome to fully official stardom.

1282872,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous has become my favorite movie, ever!  I fell in love with each and every character!  My two favorites are Elaine Miller and Penny Laine.  Two very different, but equally colorful, characters.  I was thrilled that Cameron had his own MOTHER (the inspiration for Elaine) join him in the director's commentary!  It was funny.  I also enjoyed hearing more about Penny Lane from Cameron's own mouth.  Not surprisingly, she was inspired by real-life girls he met while touring with bands.  He names two of them: a Penny Trumble and a Bebe Buell.  I would've loved to see pictures of these two ladies, heard them comment along with Cameron's mom.  But I'll  settle for looking up these two entities online!  Oh well...
What else?  I loved watching the interview with real-life Lester Bangs---Philip Seymour Hoffman did an EXCELLENT job! Many of the cut scenes were good enough to be in the actual movie.  Especially the hilarious Stillwater radio interview (what a whack job that DJ was!), Penny and Russell alone at the Riot House, and Penny ""cutting the cake"".  The Stillwater concert is a great perk, especially ""Hour of Need"", my favorite song by a band that doesn't exist!  The ode to Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, ""Small Time Blues"", is shown being sung in its entirety at the Riot House!  There are so many great ""little"" scenes in this movie, I would've loved to zero in on like that.  This is a wonderful movie with wonderful extras!",1017964800,3,1451,4.782258064516129
1282873,5,B00003CXMG,"On an assignment for Rolling Stone magazine, painfully uncool adolescent William Miller meets deeply cool rock groupie Penny Lane, falls in love and ends up saving her life.
First off, this is a great movie for fans of rock movies. At times it shows some of the comic genius of Spinal Tap (especially the scene in the aeroplane). The fictional band Stillwater have some great early 70s tunes that really take you back (or take you there, depending on how old you are...).
But it's also worth watching even if you hate all that kind of thing. Almost famous is really an exploration of the meaning of friendship. In a rock-tour world where every relationship is as shallow as a one night stand, William unwittingly shows what real friendship can be, and calls those around him to live up to the best in themselves. I expected this movie to be merely Ok. It far surpassed my expectations. Every performance is superb.",1017878400,4,914,4.683229813664596

There's so much packed in here, I've been listening to the Stillwater cd on an almost daily basis.  I really enjoyed the deleted scenes, even if they didn't add much to the plot.  It's great to see it all, even if it's not ALL the deleted scenes!  The extras, like the Stillwater concert, are fantastic.  I found the director's commentary particularly interesting.  I liked hearing about what inspired Cameron Crowe to make this movie.  He mentions a Bebe Buell as being a partial influence on the Penny Lane character.  If you want to know why Penny wanted to go to Morocco, try doing a search on Bebe Buell.  In a chat transcript for Playboy online, Bebe mentions always wanting to visit Africa someday!  There are interviews online where Bebe says the very first conversation she had with Cameron in 1973 was about their ages.  Sound familiar?!  I recommend reading ""Rebel Heart"" by Bebe Buell too.  You're bound to see other ""Penny Lane"" similarities.",1017705600,3,1041,4.716666666666667
1282983,5,B00003CXMG,"I avoided seeing this one for ages because I assumed from the previews it would be another ""kids are cool - adults are stupid"" piece of trash. What was I thinking?
Every now and then a movie grabs me, and I watch the DVD literally every day for a couple of months. Contact. L.A. Confidential. 54. That sort of thing. And now, Almost Famous. This movie works on so many levels and rings so absolutely true from start to finish that you don't watch it, you live it. If you were around in the 70's, and you didn't live under a rock, you knew this world, in the same way that a young boy feels he knows the players on his favorite baseball team. I read Creem Magazine all the time. It was like a sacrament. At last, I get to see the other side, the lives of not only the people who wrote those sacred words, but also the people they wrote them about.
Although there is plenty of star power here, all the monumentally talented actors are still unknown enough to bring nothing but talent to their roles. There's no star baggage or hype. Even Kate Hudson, the archtypical Hollywood insider, is fresh and new and utterly believable. The exception, of course, is Frances McDormand. As an Oscar winner and three time nominee, she's nobody's unknown, but her gift for loosing herself in memorable roles shines again as the mother of a young Carmeron Crowe-like character angsting over the sudden maturity thrust upon her prodigal son.
There are moments; the band on a bus singing ""Tiny Dancer"", the guitarist on the roof proclaiming ""I am a Golden God"" (once uttered in real life by Robert Plant), and just about every scene with Patrick Fugit, who is nothing short of amazing, where this movie transcends its medium, its message, and becomes something much more. It's a time portal and a crystal ball and a backstage pass all in one. It lets you relive your childhood and fill in the parts that were denied to you the first time around.
Don't miss this movie, and don't wait too long before you see it. You've waited far too long already, and in a magic instant it could be the 70's for you all over again, only better.",1017532800,10,2109,4.466321243523316
1282984,5,B00003CXMG,"Among the special features on the original DVD version is an interview with Joni Mitchell which was originally printed in Rolling Stone magazine.  The great questions in the movie pushed the envelope, in an effort to understand what was cool, as that kind of question might be asked by a teenager whose mother was the Goethe-quoting college professor whose attitude about everything was the opposite of cool.  In the process of being confronted by such an individual, Joni happened to remember a night when she wanted to crash a party, and someone at the door, who had been dubious about letting any stranger in, suddenly realized that Joni Mitchell being there was more cool than anything that had ever happened in the young lives of the people who had been invited.  As I remember the interview, Joni was 36 and wondering if she might find a man who would be around long enough (six year minimum in modern times) for her to be an appropriate mother, and she wasn't likely to find him at that party, which was sometime when she was much younger, anyway.  Watch the movie first, which is about being young, before you try to understand the interview, which is two aging people trying to get a grip on art, or escaping the grip of what is currently considered cool by fleeing the social scene, jumping into a swimming pool, or mostly, by growing old.",1016928000,2,1349,4.65546218487395
1282985,5,B00003CXMG,"Sometimes a film comes along, and it enchants and excites you. It makes you believe in movie magic again. This may happen infrequently, but when it does, it reminds you of what made you fall in love with the movies to begin with. Of course, even the best movie triggers these feelings in only part of its audience. For me, Almost Famous is one of those pictures. Since the print media and the visual media are so different, I doubt this review can tell you if the film has the same in store for you.
Writer and director Cameron Crowe has had a charmed life, and he knows it, as can be seen in this partly autobiographical and partly fictionalized tale. When he was just fifteen years old, he got the first of several writing assignment from Rolling Stone magazine. Almost Famous is the story of a kid on the road with a rock and roll band in the early 1970s.
Young William Miller [Patrick Fugit] has come to the attention of Rolling Stone because of some articles he wrote for Creem magazine. The assignment comes via telephone, and the editors are unaware that they are hiring a teenager. William doesn't have much luck hooking up the band Stillwater until he gets a little help from a groupie called Penny Lane [Kate Hudson]. Penny is in love with Stillwater's lead guitarist, Russell [Billy Crudup]. Since he has a girlfriend back in New York, she tries to pretend she's just a friend, but everyone sees right through her. William's mother, Elaine [Frances McDormand], who has already alienated her daughter, Anita [Zooey Deschanel], is reluctant to let William go. She gives in when he promises to be back in time for high school graduation and swears he won't do drugs. He keeps his word on the drugs, but the tour and the group mesmerize the kid. He winds up on the road with them for weeks. It is, to say the least, an interesting trip.
This is perhaps the best coming of age movie I have ever seen. It ranks arguably at the top of movies about rock and roll, and it certainly feels like the most authentic. The songs performed by Stillwater were written for the movie by Crowe and others, and they fit in seamlessly with the vintage rock and roll tunes played throughout the film. The look and the feel of the 70s is captured perfectly. It was a very different time for music. It was a period when talent and idealism ruled the scene. It would not be long until all pop music was all confiscated by vast corporations. You see the beginnings of this process in the movie when a creep from the record company comes in to replace the band's long time manager and friend.
The acting is all world-class. Francis McDormand and Kate Hudson were deservedly nominated for Academy awards, but the whole cast is uniformly excellent.
This movie has a lot of drama in it, but it also has a lot of laughs. It remains upbeat more often than not. It has heart, something that is lacking in many films, but it is never sappy or sentimental. it touches you without making you feel manipulated. It is, I suspect, the best movie of last year.
Rated R for language, drug content and brief nudity. [I disagree with the MPAA on this one. I think Almost Famous is perfect for teens. Did they expect it to be historically inaccurate just because what was cool then isn't cool now?}",1016323200,5,3264,4.505902192242833
1282986,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous is Almost Perfect, because there's nothing perfect in this world, but is very close to be perfect. The story and the characters are well written and Cameron Crowe directing his own writing is always a sign of a good movie. If you like his past movies like ""Say Anything"" or ""Singles"" you are going to Love this one.",1016323200,,329,4.5
1282987,5,B00003CXMG,"When's the last time you saw a coming-of-age movie that wasn't filled with melodramatic teenage-angst?  There was alot of hype about this autobiographical film when it came out  and it's always scary when the critics become so enchanted with a project that they're falling all over themselves about it. But this really was the feel-good movie of 2000 and luckily it escapes that sticky-syrupy feeling by being true to its two main characters:  the music and the teenager.  The spirit of 70's rock 'n roll is as much the focus here as is the young writer who becomes enthralled by it.  Crowe recreates the 70's music scene with loving attention, but doesn't play it over the top.  It's just loud enough to capture its allure.
The movie centers on William Miller (played by Patrick Fugit) a 15 year old rock 'n roll fan and music critic who lands the break of a lifetime: a cover story for Rolling Stone.  That his mother lets him go on tour with the band ""Stillwater"" to get his story is surprising enough (she thinks rock n roll is evil and that all musicians are on drugs). But he promises to call twice a day and be back before high school graduation and so a deal is struck. Grounding William in a home where he's still just a teenager, with a mother (another amazing performance by Frances McDormand of Fargo fame) who keeps reminding him to ""don't take drugs,"" sets up the juxtaposition William is walking into: the delirious world of sex and drugs and rock 'n roll.  Fugit, in his first role, plays William with an honesty that is essential to the character's success.  He's wide-eyed and curious and completely star-struck.
As the story progresses, William becomes more and more a part of the scene and less of an outsider looking in.  He never completely joins the party, but he's no longer awed by it either.  As teenagers will do, he idolizes Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup -- who gives such an easy-going performance that he makes it look simple) and considers him and the band his friends.  Creem editor and music critic Lester Bangs (played with cynical humor by Philip Seymour Hoffman), makes several appearances as the young critic's mentor, warning him early on to be neutral (""these people are not your friends""). But William, just a kid, can't help but get pulled in.
Also capturing William's attention is the beautiful Penny Lane, a Stillwater groupie and Russell's on-the-road lover, played by Kate Hudson.  Hudson's performance is stunning; the camera loves her and she's given plenty of screen time to shine in its spotlight. She gives Lane a softness and vulnerability without losing the character's edge.  Lane befriends William and he falls in love with her. Fugit shows us this growing love with right-on twinges of jealousy in his facial expressions.  He's subtle and effective. In fact, his face gives away most of what his character is feeling all of the time, often in the absence of words or actions to help tell his story.
Having lost all objectivity, not to mention his childhood innocence, William is now faced with several dilemmas: he's in love with the band leader's girl, and he wants to write his story without feeling that he's sold out his ""friends.""  This is where the movie starts to turn.  From here on the story unfolds more quickly than slowly, but it's paced well enough where it doesn't feel at all rushed.  We're proud of William at the end.  And it's obvious that Crowe is too.
Of course, no film is ever perfect and this one is no exception.  There are two weak links in this movie.  One is William's sister, Anita, played by Zooey Deschanel.  Anita is a marginal character who doesn't quite work.  She's a rebelious teen who moves out when she turns 18 to live with her boyfriend, and who decides to become a stewardess. She's a little too stereotypical and Deschanel doesn't seem to be able to give her the right turn.  We know very little about Anita, and we don't seem to care either way.  Her story just isn't very satisfying.
The movie's ending is also a bit of a disappoitment.  Crowe found it necessary to tie up every storyline so tidily that it gives the movie's successs a bit of a jerk in the wrong direction.  It's just too pat, and borders on that syrupiness he's managed for two hours to avoid.  Still, it's a minor point in a movie that does so much so well.",1015372800,4,4345,4.659239842726081

This semi-autobiographical movie follows 15 year old William Miller as he experiences the behind the scenes happenings of an up-and-coming rock band, Stillwater.  In the beginning, you meet his overbearing but well meaning mother, who surprisingly enough allows him to tour with Stillwater.  Frances McDormand steals several sceens with her wonderful acting.  Miller meets his favorite rock critic, Lester Bangs, and Bangs has Miller writing for Bangs's magazine, Creem.  The next thing Miller knows, Rolling Stone wants him to write for them!  That's how Miller ends up on the road with Stillwater and the wonderful Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).
This movie is multi-faceted, has well developed characters and never gets bogged down in useless drivel.  I own both the VHS and DVD versions, and the DVD is definitely the one to own.  The uncut version is better than the original, and the extra material fills in a few very small gaps in the movie.  Also, with the DVD, you get both versions anyway.

The film is a slightly autobiographical tale of Cameron Crowe's teenage life. As he went around the U.S writing reviews for 'Rolling Stone' magazine. As our young protagonist William ventures around the country with a up, and coming rock band 'Stillwater' The film is essentially a comedy, but has moments of drama and romance ribboned through it's highly lucid and entertaining storyline.
The performances in 'Almost Famous' are flawless leading the charge with brilliant performances by Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson the film can appeal to a variety of age levels and lovers of the era.
Through Crowe's masterful directing the audience are subjected to a wild ride of sex, drugs and rock and roll. The viewer can experience what life is like in the late 60's and how each of us deals with fame. A tour de force soundtrack again allows the audience to feel this lifestyle.
Overall the film is an utter triumph, one that is unsurpassed in scope and vision.

I saw Jerry Maguire with my wife at the movies when we were dating and I don't think I've ever left the theater feeling better.  Almost Famous, however, didn't quite measure up to my expectations.

Crowe has said that Stillwater was inspired by the Eagles and he perfectly captures the heady 70s rock scene.  The cast is uniformly excellent, but Frances McDormand as the mother and Kate Hudson as Penny Lane are especially good.  The movie is sentimental whithout being too sticky and several scenes are instant classic.  In particular, I love the bus scene where the actors all sing Tiny Dancer.  Unfortunately, as good as this movie is, it lacks a director commentary from Cameron Crowe.  Worse yet, he subsequently released the ""bootleg"" version...that does include his commentary.  What a gyp!",1012521600,,725,5.042016806722689
1283158,5,B00003CXMG,"Everything about this film is just incredible.
Starting off from the title sequence of Crowe's handwriting to the ending.
The score is just magnificent! Crowe always throws in great music in his films.
You get great performances from Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand, Jason Lee, Kate Hudson, and especially from Patrick Fugit.
The style of directing is A+ directing once again from Mr. Crowe.
I must say that Almost Famous got robbed of the Oscars. Steven Sodenburg for Best Director?!? Gladiator for Best Picture?!? You have to be kidding!
The film is very mesmorizing, and also very inspirational. I recommend this film to everyone, especially to the music lovers out there.",1012003200,,675,5.1454545454545455

I still can't find the Cameron-with-Mom interview, but I have to assume it is there...
There may be nothing wrong with this disk after all and the movie is superb. If the subject matter is of interest to you, this is a must have. But, you probably already know that by now.",1011916800,,552,4.216981132075472

THE GOOD: 1) PLOT. A very moving story concerning one boys seach for himself, but there is so much more behind it. Everyone who has ever listend to music will understand just what this story is trying to say. 2) ACTING. Outstanding, pure and simple. I can now see why this won so many awards the year that it came out. Every role is taken seriously by each actor and that seriousness shines through in droves. 3) MESSAGE. By this I mean what is the story trying to say. Most movies out today come in smally, neatly rapped packedges that when you are done with then they leave you with no questions about yourself. That is what entertainment is supposed to do right? Well, this movie both entertains and enlightens. Quite simply put, you will be changed by this movie.
THE BAD: Nothing. I can not believe that I am actually writting nothing here. This movie does it all, every character is believeable; the story is not too sappy and moves right along; and most of all the time is just right on the whole thing. Nice job everyone!
THE BOTTOM LINE: See this movie, plan and simple. When I first saw it I had to run out and buy it right away so I could watch it again. It had a profound impact upon my life and did what I said it would, change you.",1011830400,,1521,4.321678321678322
1283161,5,B00003CXMG,"""Almost Famous"" is Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical story of how at the tender age of fifteen, he went on the road as a writer for Rolling Stone Magazine. It is also one of the finest movies ever made about the golden age of 1970's rock n'roll. Crowe's alter ego is William Miller (played admirably by Patrick Fugit)who goes on tour with the fictional band, StillWater (a composite of real life rockers the Allmand Brothers, Eagles and Led Zepplin).It is here on the road he must deal with his domineering but loving mother's phone calls, groupies and musicians with outsized egos. Throughout the film William walks a fine tightrope between becoming friends with people who are his heroes and maintaining his journalistic integrity. This film is a brilliant meditation on why we like music and what is the meaning of being a 'true fan'. ""Almost Famous Untitled"" is Crowe's director's cut of the film. The grapics of the packaging and on screen menus are made to look like that of a 1970's bootleg rock album. It includes over thirty minutes of footage not seen in the original theatrical or initial DVD release. In most films, scenes and dialogue have been originally deleted, because of pacing or the fact that they do not contribute to the story. Many of these director's cuts feel padded and have been put out just to make a quick buck off of fans. This is not the case with ""Almost Famous Untitled"". Crowe's additional footage greatly adds to the story and gives us a greater understanding to the motivations and emotions of the characters. I would say this is an improvement over the original cut. This edition also includes many more extras then the initial DVD relese. One glaring ommission from the first DVD release was it's lack of commentary track. This edition makes up for this with Crowe giving us a both inciteful and hilarious commentary with his real life mother. These two laugh and reminice with great chemistry and make it very obvious, that their relationship was accurately captured in the movie. Also included are a variety of other deleted scenes, trailers, concert footage etc. If you are a fan of 1970s rock n'roll then this is the movie for you!",1011744000,,2177,4.808
1283162,5,B00003CXMG,"I already have written a review on ""Almost Famous,"" after I saw it in the earlier part of 2001.  However, rumor of this ""Bootleg Cut""  kept me from purchasing the original.  When mom used to say ""patience is a virtue,"" this was one of those reasons to take her on her word!
  Writer/Producer/Director Cameron Crowe presents ""Almost Famous"" in it's original incarnation titled: ""Untitled!""  Yes, you heard right.  Crowe finally had the chance to insert the sequences that explained more of his characters, gave him a better piece of mind, and probably told things that wouldn't be understood by the audience (the film originally ran 2 hours long, and the 35 minutes that appear in ""Untitiled"" would probably make some squrim out of boredom in their seats).
  For those not sure of the film, here's the summary:  William Miller is a young man trapped in a family with an overbearing mother and her hope that one day, he will become a great lawyer.  But in actuality, William loves Rock and Roll, and he uses his love of music to write reviews and reports for several local and underground papers.  One day, Rolling Stone magazine gets ahold of his work, and asks William to do a story for them.  William then takes to the road with the up and coming band called ""Stillwater,"" where he meets the lead guitarist Russell Hammond(Billy Crudup), and even the infamous Penny Lane(Kate Hudson), a young girl who's the most enigmatic screen presence you may ever see.
  The extras that Crowe includes in this DVD set include audio commentary by himself and (possibly a first for an audio guest) his Mom!  She's very informative, and also helps keep the conversation lively.  There's also a longer cut of a scene featuring the band ""Still Water,"" as well as articles Crowe wrote for Rolling Stone in his youth (this film is actually a biopic of his life, with some fiction).  There is also a great interactive scene that requires you to have Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven"" on audio, CD, Vinyl or any form you can get your hands on it.  Trust me, get a copy of ""Stairway"" if you get this DVD set. What it's for is a great scene that was cut because they couldn't get the copyright for the song.
  As an added bonus, there is a 6-song CD featuring the music written for the band ""Stillwater"" in the film.  Every single song is Excellent!  Not a bad one in the bunch.
  The set contains the original cut of the film on Disc 2, which is a great way to compare the cut for the big screen, and the true director's vision.
  The film has been known to off-put some people ( almost all my family didn't like it), but for those that like music, nostalgia, and a film that is really unlike what most people create or experience, this is a great set to get.",1011484800,,2740,4.527494908350305
1283163,5,B00003CXMG,"there are few words to describe the loveliness of the movie.  If you love music, if you love actors, if yo ulove movies.  Just don't think twice.  Get this already!",1011398400,,164,4.4
1283164,5,B00003CXMG,"But we're also seeing ""Director's cut"" movies released all the time, and a lot of them end up being real disappointments (The ""Apocalypse Now Redux"" comes to mind), filled with schlock that does nothing to advance the storytelling and probably should've stayed on the cutting room floor or in the ""bonus materials"" section.  (Kevin Smith was wise enough to not provide a longer cut when he released ""Dogma"" last year.  Bravo!)
So, it was with some trepidation that I sat down to watch the ""Untitled"" cut of Cameron Crowe's masterpiece ""Almost Famous.""  I thought I would end up bored and dissatisfied with this new version:  It's one of my favorite films anyway, how can it be better.  However, this DVD is a pleasant surprise.  All of the extra footage is very good, and it truly adds to the plot of the film, rather than just being there for the sake of being included.  Some of the stuff is totally new, including a very funny radio station interview scene.  Other things cut back into the film are subtle changes to familiar scenes that clear up some of the things about both the characters and the plot (particualarly, they cement the relationships between Penny, Russell and William).
When I saw the ""Tiny Dancer"" sequence in the theatre, I felt like I should be at least misting around my eyes.  Last night, I outright cried at it.  Crowe has done a great job making a DVD that tugs at you just a little more than the theatrical version of the film.  It's a whole new (and much better) movie.",1011398400,,1499,4.597744360902255

I despised this movie. I felt dirty for having watched the whole thing. There is nothing even remotely interesting happening at any point in this horrible, horrible waste of celluloid. The characters -- every single one of them -- lack any depth whatsoever. The acting is mediocre at best. Every attempt at humor falls completely flat. But the most despicable thing about this movie -- beyond the boring script, beyond the annoying Kate Hudson and the irritating little peach-faced journalist guy (So cute!

Cameron Crowe somehow managed to make a quintissentially funny, romantic, nostalgic, melancholy, celebratory, tragic masterpiece, and anyone who has ever loved something and seen its deterioration will respond, primally, to this film.

Being a product of the 80s, I think I was more able to appreciate the subtleties of the story better.  Certainly my Mother & Father wouldn't understand it quite as well.

What I liked best about the movie is the ending.  That is where all the parts come together.  That is where we, the audience, really get the opportunity to ""know"" the characters for who and what they are.

 I don't own this movie and don't really plan on buying it.  But I am certainly glad to have seen it..once.",1010793600,,660,4.208
1283257,5,B00003CXMG,"Set in the early seventies and the time of endlessly touring British and American concept rock bands and told through the eyes of high school kid and wannabe rock journalist William Miller, the movie follows the lives of the up-and-coming fictionalised rock band Stillwater and one of their most special fans, Miss Penny Lane (the excellent Kate Hudson). Whether you were around in the seventies and remember this era (I wasn't and I don't) it is hard not to be moved be this rock odyssey as the band move from town to town, squabble to squabble and we watch William grow.
This has everything you'd expect from a movie about a rock band, girls, drink, drugs, fighting and general excessive bad behaviour but it skilfully avoids ever falling into clich because the characters here are not just rock stars or groupies, they are real people, with human weaknesses and human strengths. Crowe's writing and direction are both subtle and beguiling and he draws extraordinary performances out of all the main leads including Billy Crudup (as lead guitarist and charismatic star of Stillwater), Kate Hudson (as Penny Lane), young Patrick Fugit (as William) and great supporting turns from the finest young character alive at this moment, Philip Seymour Hoffman (as legendary rock journo. Lester Bangs) and Frances McDormand, as William's overprotective mother.
I must admit to being a big fan of Cameron Crowe's work ever since seeing Say Anything and Jerry Maguire and unlike the, by all accounts, very disappointing Vanilla Sky, Almost Famous is up there with Crowe's finest work. Great romance, great humour and great warmth, this semi-autobiographical movie has it all in bucket loads and if this doesn't warm the cockles of your heart their aint much hope left for you I'm afraid.",1010534400,10,1777,5.027118644067796

I think I've watched it 5 times, and could watch it another 5...or 6...or...you get the idea. Cameron Crowe nailed the time period, the music, and the total feeling of the rock scene circa 1973 as well as his intent to give something memorable back to those who gave so generously to him in his youth. I enjoyed the ""Untitled"" version of the movie, though could see why come of it was left out of the theatrical release. Like Russell Hammond says in one of the restored scenes...""It's all about what you leave out."" Though he's talking about music, I thought the comment to be a little ironic. But I digress. I'll probably buy more of his movies because this one definitely said ALOT to me. I've even gone out and bought some of the movies Cameron mentions in the Director's Commentary of ""Untitled""...those being ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and ""The Apartment"" just because I have such a great respect for Crowe after seeing his passion for both music and the art of film making through this movie.

1283261,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous Untitled: The Bootleg Cut - Director's Edition.
I've decided to review the Bootleg Cut of ""Almost Famous"" as most of the other reviews are of the original theatrical release.
This is a wonderful two-disc ( actually 3, more on this later ) DVD collection.
First, the packaging. We are presented with a brown tri-fold package, much like the bootleg recordings of the seventies. Not a whole lot of artwork on the cover. Simply a small photo of Kate Hudson (Penny Lane).
The first tri-fold presents us with a wonderful addition to this DVD set. Included is a STILLWATER Music CD. This music CD is only available in this collection and features songs from the film as performed by Stillwater. Four of the tracks are co written by Nancy Wilson ( of Heart ) and Cameron Crowe ( the director ). This little bonus CD is great and very appropriate to the theme of the set.
I'll jump now to DISC 2 of this set which is the Original Theatrical Version of ""Almost Famous"". This is the academy award winning version that was released and it's great. The story is well told and very engaging.
DISC 1 is ""Untitled: Almost Famous : The Bootleg Cut"" which is not rated.
This version is a gift.
Cameron Crowe has taken the time to ( lovingly ) recut his film and include an additional 36 minutes of film. The addition of these precious minutes change the film but do not deminish it's impact or watchability.
The additional 36 minutes add mostly to the character of Penny Lane ( Academy Award Nominee Kate Hudson ) and expand on her history.
Unlike many extended versions which add little to character development, this version of ""Almost Famous"" brings more insight and depth to nearly all characters.
The acting is outstanding, and it's clear that the scenes not in the original release were cut strictly due to time constraints as the acting is right on.
This is a great cast. Kate Hudson is a stand out, as is newcomer Patrick Fugit. Billy Crudup is wonderful as well, this is the movie which should have made him a movie star. Jason Lee ( of ""Chasing Amy"" and other Kevin Smith films ) is hysterical and just enough over the top to be believable. The movie, this version, rests soundly with Kate Hudson and Patrick Fugit.
I would think, had this Bootleg version been released theatrically, then perhaps Kate Hudson would have actually won the Academy Award rahter than just being nominated. She's done a wonderful job with this complex character.
The director's commentary is priceless, much like attending a film school seminar as conducted by Cameron Crowe.
This two disc set is a must have for any film fan. Even if you've got the original DVD release ( rather than this special edition set ), this is still more than worth the purchase price.
I would recommend this set. Strongly.
Best Regards,
turtlex

1283262,5,B00003CXMG,"This is the rare instance where the director's post-release tinkering has improved what was already a fantastic film. Watching the ""Untitled"" cut (Director Cameron Crowe had such difficulty coming up with a title he almost released the film as ""Untitled"") is like discovering long-lost chapters to your favorite book, or hearing outtakes from your favorite band. The additional scenes bring viewers further into both the hero's home life and the surreal life on the road of a touring rock band. The original cut of the movie is included in the set, but why anyone would want to see it after seeing this film in the longer form is beyond me.
And the extras ... simply the best on a DVD I've ever come across. The commentary with Crowe and his mother is at turns insightful, touching and hilarious. The part where they discuss whether Crowe lost his virginity the same way his alter ego on screen did is worth the price of admission alone. The deleted scenes include one that invites the viewer to cue up ""Stairway to Heaven"" since that was supposed to be the soundtrack for the scene, but the rights was unavailable. The satisfaction of seeing the characters on screen react to your dubbing is incredible. And there's a bonus CD of songs by ""Stillwater,"" the faux band in the film. The songs are a great pastiche of 70s rock that heighten the believability of the film. You really think you're listening to a great undiscovered band from the time.
As for the movie itself, the original film deservedly won an Oscar for best original screenplay and should have won more. Had more of Kate Hudson's performance as ""band aid"" Penny Lane been in the movie, she would have an Oscar today. Billy Crudup perfectly personifies both the innocence and the arrogance '70s rockers exuded, while Patrick Fugit's performance captures the uncool kid yearning to be cool we all were at that age.
Put simply, if you even just mildly enjoyed ""Almost Famous,"" you owe it to yourself to give this a spin. It's everything about the movie you liked, raised to a higher level.",1009324800,18,2051,4.731843575418995
1283263,5,B00003CXMG,"Though I love rock music, I don't tend to like movies about rock music. This one did me in. An overwhelming charm seeps from every frame of this movie, every character, every moment, making it impossible for me to imagine that Cameron Crowe ever had doubts about bringing this story to life.
If you enjoyed the strengths of Almost Famous, I think the ""bootleg/Untitled"" cut of this movie will only make the movie better for you. It is essentially a more detailed, slightly slower-paced, but richer version of the movie, where the magic moments take more time to unfold, the sense of reality is more firmly established, and the characters are better explored. Billy Crudup and Jason Lee are absolutely wonderful as the feuding vocalist/guitarist team; Patrick Fugit brings much innocent charm and emotional honesty; Philip Seymour Hoffman, Fairuza Balk, Zooey Deschanel, Noah Taylor and Frances McDormand are all sublime; and of course, Kate Hudson steals the show as one of the most adorable characters I've ever seen, a combination of naive sensuality, sheer joie de vivre, and romantic longing. Crowe richly deserved his Best Screenplay Oscar, as well -- this movie contains magic moments aplenty, and the dialogue shifts effortlessly from the gloriously funny to the achingly heartfelt.
The bonus materials are abundant -- this is more than just a bootleg, it's a veritable boxed set. A Stillwater music CD, an interview with Lester Bangs, outtakes (including one patience-testing, but still amusing sequence shot of Penny Lane -- smart not to include in either version of the movie), transcripts of Crowe's original Rolling Stone articles -- in a year of great DVD releases, this one stands on its own, even among Criterion's Hitchcock releases, the Godfather DVD set, and the second season of The Sopranos.
Cameron Crowe's love of music has translated into cinematic form. And the feeling envelops us all. We are the better for it.",1009324800,8,1936,5.091194968553459
1283365,5,B00003CXMG,"A movie with a soul.  It is honest, sensitive, raw, and wonderfully entertaining drama.  I didn't see this film in the theater.  I rented it, then bought it.  This movie transcends your typical teenage rock movie by documenting the loss of innocence - both of the main character, William Miller (brilliantly under played by newcomer Patrick Fugit) and the music industry as a whole.
Miller discovers the world of rock from listening to his older sister's albums and through circumstances ends up on an assignment for Creem magazine to write an article on Black Sabbath.  When he tries to gain entrance backstage to do the story, he ends up meeting band aid (NOT groupie) Penny Lane (played by Kate Hudson) and his life changes.  Instead of meeting Black Sabbath, he falls in with one of their opening acts, a fictitious band called Stillwater, and Miller's early career as a writer takes off.  Penny Lane befriends the young Miller and is his guide into the world of rock and roll.
The achievement of this film is it manages to show the drugs and sex, the emptiness, and shallowness of the music industry without making the viewer lose fascination or obsession with its stars and glamour.  The people are human, talented, affected, and driven.  That's where the film so gloriously succeeds.  As Miller follows Stillwater on their Almost Famous Tour on assignment for Rolling Stone magazine, we see him fall in love and get used, and he just keeps coming out of the trenches to face more because in the end - every one is in it for the music and living for the moment.
Some of the most magical moments in the film are between Patrick Fugit and Kate Hudson, Patrick Fugit and Billy Crudup, and Patrick Fugit and Frances McDormand.  I find it hard to imagine all the attention heaped on McDormand and Hudson to the exclusion of Fugit.  While the ensemble cast in this film is one of the best ever assembled (Altman eat your heart out), Fugit and director Crowe are the glue that hold this movie together and make it what promises to be one of the most enduring films ever made.  Not to mention Academy Award winner Anna Pacquin and Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Oscar-worthy roles.  And Jason Lee proved in this film that he should never go back to skateboarding.  Ever.
Guitarist Peter Frampton was a technical consultant on this film, and Nancy Wilson (Mrs. Cameron Crowe) formerly of heart wrote the score for Almost Famous.  Cameron Crowe said as he was accepting the Academy Award for best original screenplay for Almost Famous that the film was his love letter to the music industry.  I just hope he sends a few more their way.  Or ours.  This movie proves he doesn't have to take a back seat to Harper Lee as long as he stays honest.  The more we see of Crowe in his work and the less of Cruise the better.  If dipping into his own experiences yields this kind of entertainment, I hope the well never runs dry.  In Almost Famous, he bared his soul and created a cinema masterpiece that captures more about the human spirit than anything put on celluloid in two decades.",1009324800,,3070,4.625461254612546
1283366,4,B00003CXMG,"Recut and re-released films should be treated the same as remakes--one has to ask why it should be redone. Any number of films have benefited from this type of ""remake"". Just as many, though, have had little added. In effect being able to go back and re-edit a film as allowed artistic second guessing. Sometimes it's to the disadvantage of a classic.
Crowe's ""bootleg"" version of Almost Famous (released under it's original title ""Untitled"") kind of falls between these two camps as nothing essential is really added back to the film. A pity this wasn't released like this previously as the running commentary between Crowe and his Mom is actually interesting.
Still, kudos to Crowe (and the marketing folks at Dreamworks)for the way this package is put together. The CD of unreleased songs and having both versions of the film make this an interesting boxed set. A pity that Apocalypse Now Redux wasn't released in this format (there's a good example of a film that would benefit this type of packaging. It would have allowed the inclusion of the original film, the re-edited version --in the slightly different aspect ratio--along with the stunning documentary Hearts of Darkness by Coppola's wife).
SInce music is so essential to all of Crowe's films I can't help but wonder what he will do as a film director/writer once he finishes mining the past. What happens when he hits his midlife crisis? Who know what artistic explorations might be in store...",1009065600,3,1457,4.926829268292683

'Say Anything', 'Jerry Maguire', and 'Almost Famous' are all deeply moving films showing a film maker learning and improving on his craft and his storytelling with each year.  My only complaint was that before seeing Almost Famous I started hearing rumors about a longer, richer cut of the film.  It took an edge off the original experience.  I found myself noticing jumps in the storyline.  Character were left unresolved that needed to be resolved.  I just wanted more!  Now it's here, and it was worth the wait.

There are 3 discs. One is a Stillwater audio cd with 6 songs. The main disc has the Director's Cut of the movie with the commentary tracks and a few other goodies. The 3rd disc has the original theater release, and some more extras.
One thing that distinguishes ""Almost Famous"" from other DVD's with deleted scenes is that they are intergrated into the movie, as originally intended. The extra 30 minutes is really interesting and fits nicely. You don't need to seek them out in an extras section and watch them on their own, without understanding where they were supposed to play in the movie.
In addition, the Cameron Crowe commentary is truly awesome. It is very personal, and you learn a ton. It is worth the price all by itself.

1283372,5,B00003CXMG,"The main character in Almost Famous is a 15 year old rock journalist named William Miller. He gets the chance to write an article for Rolling Stone magazine about an up and coming rock band, Stillwater. He goes out on tour with the band and what starts out as a simple assignment, turns into a life altering experience for all involved. The character of William is director and writer Cameron Crowe's on screen alter ego. Mr. Crowe was a 15 year old who wrote for Rolling Stone and the story is based on his life. The film also involves William's overprotective and aggressive mother (played by Frances McDormand) and the battles she waged with his sister. They are based on Mr. Crowe's own family's struggles and the fact that he was willing to air his family's problems in public adds a touch of humanity and reality to the film. Stillwater is led by Jeff Bebe and Russell Hammond who bicker at one another about the band's future and possible fame. Billy Crudup plays Russell the lead guitarist and Jason Lee is Jeff the lead singer. They have a natural fear of the press and refer to William as the enemy. In fact, William struggles to get an one on one interview with Russell throughout the film. The band is followed on tour by a bunch of groupies who refer to themselves as Band-Aids. Their leader is Penny Lane played wonderfully by Kate Hudson. She is in love with Russell, but it is William whom she confides in. The tender relationship between Penny & William is one of the film's great strengths. Throughout the film, William seeks and gets advice from legendary rock critic Lester Bangs. Mr. Bangs is played amazingly by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Mr. Hoffman provides the film's conscious and his brief time on the screen is electric. All the performances in the film are first-rate including Ms. Hudson who is luminous, Mr. Crudup is brooding and dark, Mr. Lee is self-righteous and Ms. McDormand is a fierce presence. But the most startling performance is that of Patrick Fugit as William. Mr. Fugit had never appeared in a movie before and had minimal acting experience, but he is the emotional center of the film, the link between al the characters. He plays William perfectly and captures the essence of what Mr. Crowe was trying to capture. Mr. Crowe guides the film with an eye for detail as the sets and feeling are completely real and harkens the spirit of the 70's. His screenplay perfectly balances drama and comedy and has some of the sharpest dialogue in a long time. Mr. Crowe took home a Best Original Screenplay Oscar at the 2000 Academy Awards for this great script. Almost Famous is Mr. Crowe's love letter to his youth and the 70's. The film is easily his most personal, but it is the personal touch he adds that gives the film its universal appeal.  This is an expanded three disk DVD that has everything one could want regarding the film including a disk of Stillwater's live performance that was filmed for the movie and vintage Cameron Crowe Rolling Stone work.  The DVD is as expansive as any released and worth the few extra bucks.",1007683200,,3067,4.6464088397790055
1283373,4,B00003CXMG,"""Almost Famous"" is a sort of riff on Director Cameron Crowe's early years reporting for Rolling Stone.  You don't have to be a rock enthusiast to enjoy its sweetness.  Set in the early 1970's, when rock was drenched in a sort of easy-going, sun dried, alcohol and drug-fueled haze, and teenagers across America worshipped at the altar of Led Zeppelin with a fervor thought reserved by Star Trek fans, it tells the story of William Miller, a high-schooler trying to become a Rock N' Roll Journalist.  Preternaturally mature (by age 11, he's in the same class as 13 year olds, and they still hate him), and sheltered at home by a lovingly domineering mother (superb Frances Mcdormand), William falls in love with Rock yet is less determined to become a rocker himself than follow in the footsteps of  the legendary Lester Bangs, the self-appointed Dean of Rock Criticism.  Getting his first break writing for Bangs's ""Creem"" magazine, Miller gets his big break when he's tagged by Rolling Stone to cover the burgeoning band ""Stillwater"" on its ""Almost Famous '73"" tour.  Bangs remains ever present mentoring Miller through the process of covering the fast-rising band, an endeavor that requires Miller to remain aloof and objective, but not so distant that the band's suspicious members won't shun him as ""the enemy"".  Despite her better instincts, and on Miller's oath that he won't miss high-school graduation, Miller's mother allows the boy to go on tour with Stillwater, a fictional band loosely hinting such 70's confabs as Credence, the Allman Brothers and the Eagles.  A steady stream of sex with the band's dedicated groupies (called ""Band-aids"", young girls with fake names who insist that they're there for the music) and various feuds between band members helps to occupy Stillwater's principals, and frustrate Miller's attempts to get the band to say anything coherent on tape.  Too sweet (or uncool) to be insistent, Miller follows the band across America, watching self-imposed deadlines come and go.  Adding to Miller's stress is his own burgeoning love for Band-Aid in-chief, ""Penny Lane"" (Kate Hudson), whose adoration for Russel Hammond (Crudup), Stillwater Lead Guitar, blinds her to how the band uses its groupies.
""Almost"" is a great movie, one of those understated gems from director Cameron Crowe. Though an anthem to 70's rock fandom, the film excels on its characters -  Stillwater's lead vocalist's pompous platitudes on the significance of Rock, Crudup's acid-induced meanderings at a party he crashes in Topeka, Phillip-Seymour Hoffman as the sage Bangs and especially Macdormand.  Like a band, the film excels not only on solo acts but also on how the characters impact each other - the look on the Topeka partygoers or (in one of the flick's running gags) the look on the faces of hotel workers who have to take messages from Miller's mother, or the lecture that Hammond receives from Mrs. Miller herself.  (I'm not sure if Mcdormand's character is supposed to be a reference to the song, Mother"", off of Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"".)  Above all, the script drips with tasty lines, bizarrely unforgettable zen koans (like the one about groupies who eat steak but don't use birth control) and a fair amount of period rock references.  When Crudup's Russel Hammond proclaims himself a ""golden god"", you might miss the Zeppelin reference, but you won't miss the imagery, one of a lost age that outdid ancient Greece in resembling the cover of ""Houses of the Holy"".",1007596800,,3485,5.036521739130435

Also, the are actual interviews with the REAL Lester Bangs, a behind-the-scenes documentary, Cameron Crowes Top 10 Albums of 1973 (narrated, of course) among many other features. Disc 2 is the Theatrical Release, and features extras like an entire Stillwater Concert, the ENTIRE screenplay (Which won an Academy Award), and the precious ""Stairway To Heaven"" deleted scene, in which William and his friends and mentors use the Led Zeppelin epic to convince her the positivity of rock music and let him go on tour with Stillwater. The scene was not included because they could not get the rights to the song, so the scene directs you to get your copy of ""Stairway"" and play it along with the scene as you watch it. Among the other features are a trailer, cast & crew bios, production notes, all of which were included on the first DVD. The third disc is an audio CD of all six Stillwater songs heard throughtout the movie, all in studio form, which are all excellent.

1283452,4,B00003CXMG,"(THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE ""UNTITLED - BOOTLEG CUT"" DVD SET)
(4 and 1/2 stars) Since there are many reviews of the movie itself already available, I will focus here on what's in the ""Untitled"" DVD set.
--- The extra scenes in the ""Director's Cut"" give more depth to the characters and connect the story together even better.  It's not that there's anything amazing in the extra stuff (or else it would have been in the theatrical version), but it's certainly fun to watch - especially the scene with a stoned DJ interviewing the band.
--- The ""Cleveland Concert"" is actually just 3 songs, 15 minutes long.  Interesting to watch, good music, although it does sound like studio recordings with a bit of crowd noise before and after the songs.  (No crowd noise at moments during the songs where it might be appropriate.)
--- The music CD has 6 songs by the fictional group Stillwater.  The last 3 sound as if they're the same exact recordings as in the ""Cleveland Concert.""  Still, this is one of the attractions that got me to buy the set, and it's something to play in the stereo or in the car.  (I wonder why these songs weren't on the soundtrack CD though?)
--- I enjoyed hearing Mr. Crowe's rundown of the ""Top Albums of 1973.""  He explains the enduring value of each of CDs by Bowie, the Stones, Jackson Browne and others.
--- The infamous ""Stairway to Heaven"" scene is finally released.  I expected it on the previous DVD edition, but at last now I was able to do the interactive thing of playing my own Zep CD along with the scene.  It is kind of an amusing scene, and gives us a chance to watch Crowe's mom playing one of the teachers.
--- Several of the other extras were worthwhile, like the Nancy Wilson demo for one of the Stillwater songs.  I enjoyed it even more than the Stillwater version.",1007424000,,1801,4.463414634146342
1283453,5,B00003CXMG,"If you loved the theatrical release of ""Almost Famous"" then this is just what the doctor ordered. I'd read the script in it's original form before I saw ""Untitled"" and I knew that this version of the film would really complete the story. I WAS RIGHT! Throw in all of the extra features (including a 6 song CD of music from Stillwater) and you have a DVD that's a gem! If there was a disappointing moment it was when I realized that the intervention scene was still deleted from this version of the film. No worries though...Cameron Crowe couldn't get the rights to use ""Stairway To Heaven"" in the scene. The scene is included in the DVD set...you just add the song from your own personal collection.

The movie was a loving reminder of my youth and it brought me back there again, it all came alive for me in such a personal way.  Almost Famous struck so many emotional and melodic chords that for the first time I truly appreciated every convoluted and glorious moment spent in every day-glow painted bedroom.  The movie was like a backstage pass into life.
For a good part of the movie, I WAS YOUNG AGAIN, I hated it when the movie was over and the only way to get that feeling again is to play the movie again.  It's addicting.
I wanted to hold Penny Lane just one more time and be there listening to Zepplin, Yes and the Allman Brothers....  To relive the parties, the concerts and the experiences of my youth in a carefree manner... Oh what a glorious movie.
If you don't own this movie, you must.  It is a great ballad to the rock bands,  those who love music and to all of us who grew up to the passionate, moving and emotional rock music and times of the 60's and 70's
You will watch Almost Famous and listen to the wonderfully produced soundtracks over and over and over again.

1283455,3,B00003CXMG,"As a fan of most of Cameron Crowe's other work, I was somewhat disappointed with this movie.  It wasn't terrible or the worst movie of the year as some reviewers here seem to think.  It also wasnt' great or one of the best of the year.  It was good, but I also thought it was very boring.  The acting was outstanding by Crudup, Fugit, Hudson, McDormand, and Seymour Hoffman.  The screenplay was good, I was very happy to see Cameron Crowe finally win an award.  He won the Oscar for best screenplay.
The idea of this movie really seemed like a good one to me, and when I first watched the movie, I was pretty happy with the outcome.  Then recently I watched it again and was bored.  I kept saying, did i really like this?  It just seemed so lame and to not be going anywhere.  Maybe it just isn't one of the movies, for me anyway, that I can view repeatedly. The music I could certainly listen to over and over.  The soundtrack is better than the movie.
I just thought the story was really not all that interesting or entertaining.  It seemed to drag, and it wasn't particularly funny.  If it was supposed to be, I don't know where I was supposed to laugh.
It's certainly worth a look at for the great acting and soundtrack and screenplay.  It's just not all that fun to watch.  I compare it to another Crowe movie, Jerry McGuire.  This movie had so much hype, like Almost, and when I saw it in the theaters, I fell asleep!!! I am a woman, and I love romance comedies.  I didn't think either of these films were much of either but more of a sleep aid.
I think Crowe's best work was Singles and Say Anything.  They were both very entertaining comedies.",1006992000,2,1651,4.288025889967638
1283456,5,B00003CXMG,"From beginning to end, I really loved this movie.  Its cast alone is enough to please even the harshest of Cameron Crowe's critics. Patrick Fugit plays a naive but completely understandable precocious aspiring teen writer. Billy Crudup plays the brooding and unexpectedly accessable lead guitarist of the vaguely ""Allman Brothers/Led Zepplinesque band, Stillwater.  Jason Lee, who in my eyes truly cannot do any wrong, plays a hilarious foil to Crudup's character, trying so hard not to fall into his guitarist's shadow that every effort he makes not to pushes him more out of the limelight.  His performance is truly groundbreaking and I don't mind saying that he's got even the rest of this awesome cast beat!  Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the overly knowledgeable editor to one of the magazines Fugit's character is writing for and gives sage advice to him while still being a vulnerable little nerd who knows way too much about music, while kind of hating musicians at the same time.  As with most of his portrayals, he has a way of stealing his scenes very subtly.  Kate Hudson does an adequate job of pulling Fugit's character ""into"" what he's supposed to observe from the ""outside.""  I prefer the more suble performances of Anna Paquin (an Oscar winner, you will remember) and Fairuza Balk.  They play just as convincingly the ""fan"" roles, or truly, the groupies.  My only real regret about this movie is that they don't use Anna Paquin more.  She has been so good in so many things lately (e.g.--HurlyBurly, and she was even excellent in the X-men movie, however little it allowed her to show off her acting chops).  Anyhow, with an outstanding cast and very good story writing, this movie really pulls it off.  I was so disappointed that it didn't walk away with the best picture Oscar.  So often, a movie with a ""less serious tone"" such as this cannot win that coveted honor.  Well, in my opinion, this one is right up there!",1006819200,3,1935,4.806646525679758
1283457,5,B00003CXMG,"If you liked Cameron Crowe's other well known effort Jerry Maguire then this movie will probably leave you with the same satisfied ""nice"" feeling and the same silly grin on your face.
A semi autobiographical work it creeps along with humor, sentimentalism and a strong cast, ultimatly leaving you with an affectionate look back on rock culture and what it means to the musicians and the fans alike.
Patrick Fugit does a very good job as the young man in question and Billy Crudrup and the always great Jason Lee (Chasing Amy, Mallrats) are equally good in support.
Kate Hudson is the revelation, as Penny Lane she exerts the same beauty, and strange mixture of innoncence yet world weariness as a 70's Holly Golightly and by the end of the movie you feel as though you could fall in love with her in an instant, which if anything adds credibility to the fact that most men in the movie seem to do this.
The soundtrack is fantastic, and while I do have a soft spot for the kind of music from the late 60's and of the early 70's I was never really a fan of some of the artists used... but it was perfectly complimentary, and the scene on the tour bus with Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" never fails to make me smile and feel good, although i've never liked his music in the slightest. So credit must go to the director for this scene.
It might be too sugary for some tastes, but I found it just about sweet enough, i cringed in all the right places, i laughed a lot, i envied the main character and so generally fell into every emotional trap the director set for us, not once, but on repeat viewings also.
In short an excellent feel good movie, not quite Jerry Maguire, but close enough, and more importantly, different.
I should also note the special features, which were very good and added value to the dvd, especially so the Rolling Stones articles of a young Cameron Crowe, which consisted of in-depth interviews with (amongst others) Led Zeppelin, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young, fascinating reading, especially as I've already said, i have a soft spot for some artists from this time, these being some of them.",1006819200,5,2110,4.526178010471204
1283458,4,B00003CXMG,"I had heard and seen so much hype about this movie that I went into the viewing with some loathing.  As it turns out it is not a movie to loath but one to embrace at least for the moment as it transports you back to that heady time that was the early seventies.  It occurrs to me that this movie will make more sense and have more meaning to people in their forties as (we) lived it about the same time that Cameron Crowe did.  The movie is a bit of a ""cop out"" as it does not hold true to Crowe's actual/factual experience of being on tour with Led Zeppelin.  Now that would have been a 5 Star movie.  Instead we are treated to the on tour saga of a fictional Stillwater complete with a photograph of the band sitting on anvil cases a la Allman Bros. Band Live at Fillmore East.  Two stand out perfomances are Phillip Seymore as Lester Bangs and Jason Lee as the lead singer of Stillwater.  I read damn near every word Lester ever wrote and I do see him coming off as very cynical but not introverted and uncool as depicted in the film.  Lester/Phillip does have some good lines like:  ""Hey man I'm always home, I'm not cool.""
Some problems I have with Almost are constant references to the year 1973 when some of the soundtrack songs are from many years forward.  Russell on top of a house with a head full of acid shouting, ""i am a golden god"".  A quote later attributed to Robert Plant in Hammer of the Gods.  Crowe's homage to his time with Led Zeppelin?  Not enough sex and drugs but plenty of booze and beer.  A very watered down seventies.

Seeing the plethora of positive reviews here makes me almost lose my faith in mankind. This movie is to films what britney spears is to music, what pink donuts are to food, what the brady bunch is to tv. After enduring scene after scene of nauseating treacle I had to switch this video off, much to the applause of my fellow viewers.

Everything in Almost Famous reeks of heavy handed sentimentality; how sweet it is when the groupie chick takes a shying to our what, 10 year old journalist protagonist? How poignant it is when billy crudup goes to the party and spends time with ""real people"". How humorous it is when journalist boy speaks like a man over the phone. This, friends, is sarcasm.
The characterisations and plot are as about as thin and 2 dimensional as a goddamn soap opera. Beleive me, I love movies, and I know what a good movie is. I also know what a crowd-pleasing, multiplex filling, heart warming excuse for a film is. Almost Famous is just that. This movie is a glass of Coke, a Happy Meal, an icecream sundae, it's designed to go down easy.

1283606,5,B00003CXMG,"~This has got to be The BEST film I have senn in all time. Kate Hudson as Penny Lane, literally shines in every scene.
Set in San Diego in the early 1970s, Almost Famous subtly introduces the element of rock'n'roll music as a venue for freedom. Finding moral support in the lyrics of Simon & Garfunkel, 18-year-old Anita (Zooey Deschanel) rebels against her conservative mother Elaine (Frances McDormand). Deciding to leave home, she urges her younger brother William to let himself be influenced~~ by the music of the era. Over the years, William (Patrick Fugit) develops an interest and befriends legendary music critic Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman: Flawless, Magnolia, The Talented Mr. Ripley), who asks him to cover a Black Sabbath concert for ""Creem"" magazine. His article earns the mature-sounding 15-year-old an assignment from Rolling Stone magazine to join the more accessible ""Stillwater"" band and interview lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and lead singer~~ Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) during their ""Almost Famous"" concert tour. Postponing his obligations at school and at home, William develops emotional ties with the band and with the coquettish groupie Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), and discovers the contradictions of being a subjective journalist.
Almost Famous constructs its plot with effective time constraints which create suspense and establish the film's sense of humor. This is explored within the arena of William's responsibilities toward his~~ editor (who thinks the writer he has hired over the phone is much older) and his mother (who wishes her boy is mature enough to resist peer pressure and drugs, but young enough to obey her). Both the editor and the mother, who require that William constantly check back with them and who impose deadlines (to submit the article outline or to return home), communicate with the protagonist via the phone throughout most of the film. Still, rather than interrupt the boy's tour/trip with the band, the~~ editor/mother interludes emphasize the main character's inability to escape from duty. The comedy rises from William's efforts to be seen as a free adult --a status the band members claim to have reached-- while he struggles with his evident inexperience. Never quite reaching a dramatic point, Almost Famous maintains a comfortable level of seriousness as it explores the main character's doubts and decisions in relation to his role as ""The Enemy"", or the critic who ""writes what he sees.""~~ Not letting his perceptions be influenced by the illusion of friendship, nor letting them deny the validity of his subjective reality, the protagonist finds freedom in those attempts that ""almost"" fail or ""almost succeed"". In this sense, Almost Famous finds a temperate --almost happy-- middle ground in its treatment of such commonly temperamental issues as sex, drugs and rock'n'roll.~",1005696000,4,2865,5.312775330396476

 Based on a true story, this film is one of the future classics of the American film industry. Directed by Cameron Crowe (the story is based on real events that have happened to him), it gives one of the most realistic portrayals of what it is like to be the extra guy in the band. Even if you don't play for them. It gives a very accurate depiction of the lives of groupies, musicians, and reporters of the 70's rock scene. If you love bands like Allman Brothers, Led Zepellin, Peter Frampton, and Lynyrd Skynyrd, this movie is for you.

1283609,4,B00003CXMG,"I put this in my DVD-player with some hesitation.  I was born in the 70s, and I love the music, but the lifestyles and the culture of the time doesn't hold a lot of allure for me.  I had heard good things about this movie, though, so I checked it out, and I'm glad I did.
The characters were pretty much all likeable.  I loved Russell, even though he could be a jerk.  I adored William, even though he was naive (maybe because he was naive).  And I absolutely adored Penny Lane.
Kate Hudson's performance in this movie was touching and endearing.  She captured the magnetism and wisdom and vulnerability that was required for this role.  Yes, wisdom, because Penny Lane was very wise about the lifestyle they were leading...she just wasn't wise about her own heart.  I wasn't too impressed with Jason Lee's performance, but it may just be the role he was given.  Billy Crudup did a fantastic job, and Patrick Fugit shone in his role.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman was also great as William's mentor, Lester Bangs.
The climax and resolution were certainly unexpected, but I thought it was an appropriate way to end this story.
This movie also provides a great quote; towards the end of the movie, Lester is talking about being uncool, and he says, ""The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when you're uncool.""
All in all I give this movie a hearty recommendation.",1003881600,5,1399,4.604838709677419
1283610,2,B00003CXMG,"Because it got overwhelmingly good reviews, I had high hopes for this film - you can scarcely imagine a better target for knowing ridicule than the world of rock 'n' roll, and Cameron Crowe, having written for Rolling Stone, has the credentials to do this. And basing a film around the celebratedly outrageous Lester Bangs had to be a riot. Didn't it?
Apparently not. Almost Famous doesn't even hint at some of the outrageous things which actually were going on in the rock scene at the time. Bangs is portrayed not as a odorous, loudmouthed, romilar-addicted wild-eyed preacher-man of rock journalism, but as an eccentric, slightly cranky uncle.
What it boils down to it that this isn't a rock movie at all. It's a coming-of-age movie. It's about a 13 year old Cameron Crowe bluffing his way into writing for Rolling Stone. Now, that story *MIGHT* have been interesting if he'd decided to tell it straight - actually naming and shaming - but he doesn't. He wimps out by making up the characters and then double wimps out by making the characters dull. Stillwater - the fictional band at the heart of the action - are completely implausible as rock idols, having no streak of threat about them at all. They all wear brushed cotton shirts.
If you ignore the cop-out plot headline, what you're left with is some silly treacly stuff between mother and son (not even Frances McDormand can save this one, having been given a stinker of a part as a college lecturer and highly-strung mom) and a highly improbable, depressingly sanitised sub-plot about a sixteen year old groupie who doesn't *do* it.
Good one, Cameron.
If you want a coming-of-age movie, watch River Phoenix in Stand By Me. If you want a rock 'n' roll spoof, then there's still only one contender - This is Spinal Tap. But as for this minor turkey - if you see it on the shelf at the video store and think twice... keep walking.",1003536000,11,1888,4.655688622754491
1283611,4,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous reaches out to anyone who has ever been caught between the expectations of normalcy and experiencing the extraordinary.  William, the main character, struggles with the pressure from his mother to be a ""person of substance"" in the real world. Yet, he also wants to be part of the rock and roll lifestyle on the road with Stillwater.  The emphasis on the real world is just a personal construction that changes every day.  More people may accept a certain way of life as reality, but others create their own unique reality.  For William's mother it is education and success; for Penny Lane it is living in the moment with rock stars.
Stillwater adopts William as part of their family.  William is working as a journalist for Rolling Stone is referred to as the ""enemy"".  To the band, he is the enemy because his reflections of them can shape how the rest of the world views them personally and their music.  It is his job to report his observations, not present the band how they want to be seen.  As William befriends the band, he realizes it is hard to be honest but concludes that honesty is true friendship.
For William, life on the road is different than life at home.  On the road, there is no routine, everything changes from city to city. He is part of the group instead of an outcast, as he is at school.  While he is out of his element he does expereince life on the road.
The movie left me wondering what it was like for Stillwater and the band aids after the party was over.  Where do you go after reaching out to so many people and then fade away from the spotlight?  It is also interesting whether or not the experience changed William.",1003276800,2,1663,4.470198675496689

Hell, I knew a lot of these people in high school.  The performances ARE perfect, and I was quite disappointed at it's lack of Oscar nominations.  This, in my opinion, was the best film of the year.  So why only 4 stars?  Well, there's a sequence at the end that just annoyed me.  Upon finally getting his exclusive interview, William asks his first question... and the movie should have ended.  But Crowe chose to do a series of cuts that were jumbled and out of sequence.  It really was a series of some bad choices.  I don't know what effect he was trying to achieve, it was lost on me.  Maybe someone else has an interpretation.  At any rate, it was a second-class ending to a first-rate movie.

1283613,5,B00003CXMG,"I guess, like many people, I was unsure about watching a movie about music and set in the 70's.  I am too young to know anything about the 70's, and as the film mostly deals with teenagers, it would appear that it has no market.  Don't let that fool you, as this is one of the best movies of the year!
It features star performances from Fugit as the young reporter and from McDormand as his mother.  It's also nice to see Fairuza Balk, such a greatly underrated actress.  The only remotely bad thing I could say about this movie is that Kate Hudson is not nearly as good as I had expected her to be.  She was still very good, just not as superb as I had been led to believe.
Basically, although 'Almost Famous' deals with teens, it is far from your typical teen movie.  It raises questions of freedom and restriction alongside the failure of modern music to truly inspire any of us anymore (or that was the message I got anyway).  As William the young reporter leaves his home in hope of freedom, friendship and rock and roll, he slowly realises that this very world he's looking is being destroyed by the people he admires, attempting to overglorify themselves though... reporters.  In short, he's never truly ""free"", restricted by his own emotions for the beautiful Penny Lane.

1283721,5,B00003CXMG,"This movie is about what it was like to be a fan of 70s album music, albeit from the privileged viewpoint of a teenage journalist who had access to rock groups that most of us could only dream about.  Though I didn't see the movie in a cinema, I'm one of the fans who has gone a bundle with its release on video, buying both the DVD and the soundtrack CD.  Though there are already 268+ reviews of the DVD on this site, I feel I just have to say how much I too love it.
What I love about the movie, besides its gentle humour, its superb choice of music and uplifting theme, is that the characters are so fully rendered that there is so much going on in each scene.  Take the moment where guitarist Russell first speaks to William's Mum on the phone -- though the key to the scene is that she manages to freak even him out, writer/director Crowe still finds space in the same moment for Penny Lane to fend off another groupie making herself too available to Russell.
I also like the fact that the plot contains no bad guy or violence.  Though in the UK the DVD carries a '15' rating -- for the use of expletives -- I'm happy to let my ten-year-old daughter watch it with me.  (I'm using it mainly as a covert means of getting her to appreciate the 70s music that I enjoy so much!)
Despite the fact that there's no bad guy and the superficial resemblance of the film to a road movie, we shouldn't allow our senses to be beguiled into ignoring the clever plot structuring, which is still based on the Hero's Quest map used for 'Star Wars', 'Lion King' etc.  Lester Bangs makes an excellent mentor in this movie -- far more wisdom spews from his lips than say, William's Mum's.  Setting the climax in an aircraft poised on the brink of crashing in an electrical storm was a brilliant stroke.
The choice of songs for the movie was excellent. Camercon Crowe chose the high-quality album tracks of the period, rather than the dance-oriented oldies that most nostalgia movies go for. 1972-76 is the period in rock that I ought to know best, but there are several songs here, such as 'Tiny Dancer', 'Mr Farmer' and 'Every Picture Tells a Story', which I hadn't heard before. Even the Cat Stevens' track ('The Wind') was a revelation which has considerably increased the respect I have for the artist.  My appreciation of Led Zep's acoustic numbers and even Simon & Garfunkel has also improved as a result of Crowe's highly intelligent juxtaposition of sound and vision. But I still loathe Rod Stewart!
But the soundtrack sound quality is so good that I'm half-convinced that Crowe re-re-mastered many of the tracks specially for the movie.
Much of today's expletive-loaded music seems to do nothing but encourage violence and bring out the worse in people.  (There I go sounding like William's Mum!) The late 60s and early 70s was a time when music tried to elevate our senses.  Many thanks, Cameron, for making this excellent tribute to the period.  One of my teenage friends at the time regularly went on about what a superb journalist Lester Bangs was.  Now I know what he meant.",1001462400,11,3073,4.497307001795332
1283722,5,B00003CXMG,"again.  That wierd era where rock bands were eventually swallowed up by the disco craze.  What were we thinking?  Cameron Crowe is obviously an authentic student of the era.  If you don't know that the story is a rough autobiography of Crowe's own experience as the enfant terrible of rock journalism, you may find the plot to be unbelievable.
Crowe admits to combining many of the elements of several rock bands that he chronicled for Creem and Rolling Stone to create Stillwater, the fictional rock band of this tale.  Sights, sounds, clothing and thought processes of the era are all faithfully reported in this gem of a movie.
Watching the Crowe interview in the special features section, and checking out his Rolling Stone articles, you know that the casting director for the film was a genius.  Unknown Patrick Fugit has many of the mannerisms and wistfulness that made ""then-Cameron"" and ""now-Cameron"" delightful and admirable.
The real star of the movie is the music, and the mix of authentic and pretend rock of the era, along with some of its unusual anthems (all of Elton John's early music touched cords in rock lovers - we weren't sure why we loved it, but we did).  The group scenes in the movie, most set to music, have an authentic camaraderie and sense of ""chilling"" that made ecletic groups of band members such memorable icons of the era.
Crowe was obviously enamored of both his mom and Lester Bangs, an early mentor.  He cast them richly with the incredible Frances McDormand and a beautiful cameo piece by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.
Many of the band members and wannabes were well cast, but the centerpiece is Kate Hudson, who illuminates the screen with her charisma and vulnerability.  A well deserved Oscar for a talented young actress.
This film earns a resounding 5 stars - there is not a target audience, because there will be something for everyone to enjoy.

It has a young-boy-finding-himself appeal, rather like a 1970's 'Perks of being a Wallflower', yet the characters are exceptionally developed and appealing, especially the divine Miss Pennylane, a groupie come professional band aid.
The plot has a handsome gentle humour and a fabulous way of ordering scenes to maximise the effect of the piece. I adored the phone call and reply 'Has the acid kicked in yet?' and reply, 'How can you tell?' followed by the immediate shot of Russell on the top of a house screaming 'I am on drugs'.
The director delivers a sensitivity to the film and the characters, and reveals beauty admist the drug culture and ideas
of the 1960's and 1970's. Of particular note was the scene in which the bus sings Elton's classic 'Tiny Dancer' and the aeroplane scene in which members of the band admit their mutual dislike, love and homosexuality. As well as Pennylane's reply 'What kind of beer?' when it is revealed she is traded for $50 and a case of beer. But then, the brillance never ends in this film.

1283727,2,B00003CXMG,"Okay, I love classic rock. The presets in my car are all set to stations that feature the Allman Brothers, Led Zep etc. ""Almost Famous"" is documentary-like in its evocation of 70's era rock, its look and its sound. With that being said, I still found Cameron Crowe's autobiographical movie to be a tedious and insignificant ode to himself. Nowhere in this film is there anything of thematic substance. The 70's were a trippy yet liberating time? Rock and Roll is a lifestyle as much as a form of entertainment? It is important for youth to find its own means of expression in order to be free? Seriously folks, haven't we seen or heard all of these themes a hundred times before? I really don't find Crowe saying anything new in this two hour movie (that feels like four).""Almost Famous"" is just Crowe looking back wistfully on his youth, and the film would be stronger if he actually offered up something to say, as opposed to just nostalgia for a dead era.
On the other hand, the performances are above average throughout this film. Working with scanty material, Kate Hudson makes an indelible impression, Frances McDormand dominates evry scene she is in, and Billy Crudup is arresting as the self-absorbed but vulnerable lead guitarist. In fact, the strongest part of this movie is in the likeable and realistic characterizations. Crowe clearly uses his experiences to great advantage here. It is just sad that he give them nothing very interesting to say.
I am not surprised this film did not merit any serious Oscar consideration. I am sure it will be forgotten by all but conneissuers of rock and roll features (nad Cameron Crowe fans) within the next five years. Crowe seems to labor under the impression that a wide audience will be as interested as what his formative years were like as he is. He would have been better off making a home movie, and screening it for himself and his family.

This semi-autobiographical take on Rock and Roll, its cynical, destructive and transcendent parts all rolled into one, really sucks you into another time and place the way few movies in recent times have done. The movie feels authentic, in part because the characters are drawn with flaws, with natural story arcs, as opposed to the cardboard cutouts that we have come to expect.
William Miller, the boy at the heart of the story, has to balance his boyish desires to be one of the gang with his journalistic intentions to tell the brutal, honest truth.
Kate Hudson's character, Penny Lane, injects poignancy into a movie that could have been just another ode to guitar-heads, booze and acid.
Frances McDormand, as Miller's mother, also is great as a liberal counterculture mother who contends with her own desires to both protect her son and set him free.
The DVD also has a number of interesting extras, including interviews, et al. A special treat are the actual Rolling Stone articles that Cameron Crowe wrote, including his classic story about Led Zeppelin.

The early 70's was a wierd time, fully in between definitive cultural frames of reference - not quite the 60's, but not really what we think of as the 70's -  and especially a wierd time to be me:  still respectful of adults, anti-drug, college bound and intent on success independent of anyone's help, financial or otherwise.  And what I want to say about this movie is that it taught, keeps teaching me, alot about myself, who I was then and, more importantly, what it was that all my friends were seeing, doing while I was busy being me.  Rock and roll as a way of life.  ""It's all happening"".  I never got it then but I'm starting to get it now, and it feels like it was cool.

It is a tremendous injustice that this film was not nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award because it should have won the statue for Best Picture of the Year. In my opinion, it is the best film of this past year, and I do not understand how you can see this movie and not think this. Director Crowe should have also been nominated along with the score and several of the supporting performances.
If you have not seen this movie, I suggest you see it. I do not think that ANYONE could not connect with the characters, the script, the story, and the emotions. These people are so real and caring that the story can only be seen through a warm perspective - you will smile throughout the entire two hours.
Kate Hudson's performance of the ""band aid"" Penny Lane is a near flawless performance. She inhabitats this character's thoughts and actions -- her laugh will make you laugh, her smile will make you smile. She should have the won the statue for Best Supporting Actress (although Marcia Gay Harden was a good selection too). And the others like Frances Mc Dormand and Patrick Fugit also allow this movie to never miss a beat. The other members of the supporting cast are also good, and everyone is worthy of some recognition.
The soundtrack also perfectly matches the feelings.
I cannot say enough about this movie; I honestly think that there will be a place in everyone's heart for this story - it is so warm and inviting and real. When you are finished viewing this film, you will have wanted to know these characters - they will keep you smiling for days.
If you are any type of movie fan, you need to love this movie and DVD version of the film. The extra features allow fans to really understand the making of the film; the extra scenes allow viewers to understand more about the characters too. What you once thought about the characters still remains true, but with this version, Crowe digs deeper with each scene. (The version with Crowe and his  mother talking over the film is fun to watch and listen - their commentary is very amusing.)
If you are any type of human with a true heart, you need to love this movie. My recommendation is for everyone because no one should miss this treat; go rent this movie.

This masterpiece also offers witty comedy that you will enjoy every now and then, giving the movie a lighthearted and believable touch. In addition, seeing the bands life beyond closed doors in this proved to be a lot more entertaining than VH1 specials. The ending is memorable and unexpected, to say the least.
Most of the acting performances were above average. Patrick Fugit brought about a great personality to his role. He was a peaceful, very smart music fan who endured an experience that made him change from being a starstruck kid to a professional journalist. The band, Stillwater, looked a lot like the bands of its time era, though I wasn't yet born. Frances McDormand brought back the famous overprotective and helpless mother that has been familiar to all teenagers at some point in their life. The only drawback to this movie was the performance of Kate Hudson's character, Penny Lane. I think that this sort of plot does need a female lead like her, but she needs to do something. Her character accomplishes nothing, as far as I am concerned. But, it doesn't hurt the movie enough to kill it.

This film has a great story and some brilliant acting to back it up.
Newcomer Patrick Fugit plays William Miller, a 15-year old  music-lover who happens to have a nose for journalism. While trying to do an assignment for Creem Magazine, William comes across the new band Stillwater. Kate Hudson does a excellent performance as Penny Lane, a groupie William befriends who helps him get inside of Stillwater. Soon William is asked by Rollingstones Magazine to write a story about Stillwater that could make the cover. So William joins the band on a tour to end all tours.  Billy Crudup plays the lead guitarist of Stillwater (another excellent performance) who refuses to give an interview to William but soon begins to like William.  Philip Seymour Hoffman does a classic performance as Lester Bangs, the editor of Creem Magazine who shows William the ropes to rock and roll journalism.  Almost Famous has some great scenes that include a charming ""Tiny Dancer"" bus ride that will make you smile.
What makes this film so great is that it is true to what the film is all about... the music.  All of the characters, no-matter how different, share one thing...the love of music.  With a soundtrack that includes Led Zepplin, The Who, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Elton John, the music truly adds to the mood of the film.  The film is done wonderfully from the beginning credits to the subtle yet surprising ending.  Almost Famous is a great film that is destined to be a classic.",996624000,,1707,4.798634812286689
1283833,5,B00003CXMG,"ALMOST FAMOUS is truly the greatest film ever made. I wanted desperately to see this ever since I saw the trailer. I never even knew I'd enjoy this kind of film. After all, me...a 17-year-old who doesn't normally like rock 'n' roll but a teen Pop fanatic who loves the Backstreet Boys instead of Led Zeppelin loved this film! So it doesn't really matter if you are not a huge fan of rock 'n' roll or lived in the 70s.
Anyway, this is a feel-good, smart comedy that takes place in 1973. It's roughly about director/writer Cameron Crowe's life as a 15-year-old rock journalist. William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is an extremely smart young teenager who, even though he is only fifteen, is a senior in high school. William lives in San Diego with his hard, strict, down-to-earth mother, Elaine Miller (Frances McDormand), a college professor who can't seemed to understand why her children like rock music and stuff. He also lives with his older sister, Anita Miller (Zooey Deschanel), who is rebelious and decides to leave home so she can have more freedom.
William's love for rock music urges him to become interested in journalism, and soon he meets the editor of Creem magazine, Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who starts giving him tips on being a good rock journalist. Then Lester gives William an assignment: get an interview from the rock band, Black Sabbeth. William manages to get his reluclent mother to let him do this, and he goes to the Black Sabbeth concert. When that doesn't work, the band Stillwater shows up late for the concert since they are the opening act. William manages to get an interview from them instead by showing off his intelligence. Finally, Rolling Stone magazine calls William and asks him to do an interview with Stillwater, which takes him on an incredible journey-experience with Stillwater, where he eventually becomes friends with the band, especially close to the band's lead guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), and the beautiful, but mysterious ""band aid"" follower, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).
ALMOST FAMOUS has humor in it's own right. The cleaver, original script and screenplay is only a part of this masterpiece. The actors are a large piece of the masterpiece - the chemistry between all the actors is the thing that holds this film together. All the actors are perfect for their roles - from Patrick Fugit, who is a truly gifted actor, to Jason Lee, who plays the lead singer for Stillwater. I am ashamed that this film was, for the most part, over-looked by the Academy for Best Picture. I was glad that ALMOST FAMOUS won Best Original Screenplay, which it deserved, but it should have won more Awards. And I think Kate Hudson deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress more than that other woman who won it.
This, by all means, is my favorite film of all time - it even beats TITANIC! I recommend this film for anybody - you don't even have to like rock 'n' roll to enjoy this film. ALMOST FAMOUS rules!",996192000,,2963,4.777777777777778

1283964,4,B00003CXMG,"What makes ""Almost Famous"" so much fun to watch is that it manages to capture a glimpse of the pop culture past without ever becoming heavy-handed, precious or sanctimonious in the process.  It clearly loves the rock music world it is exploring, yet the film is also clear-eyed enough to see that strange subculture in its totality - warts and all.  As he did in ""Jerry Maguire,"" writer/director Cameron Crowe shows himself to be a master at mixing disparate moods and exploring universal truths within the context of a light romantic comedy.
Based on Crowe's own experiences as a teenaged rock journalist, ""Almost Famous"" tells the unusual story of a 15-year old writer named William Miller who finds himself composing a behind-the-scenes article for ""Rolling Stone"" on an up-and-coming rock band called Stillwater.  As a part of the tour, William is privy to all the backstage shenanigans, interpersonal conflicts and free-living excesses that are an integral and inevitable part of any rock band's existence.  William sees firsthand the conflicts that arise when one band member seems to be rising in prominence and popularity often at the expense of his band mates who can but look on in jealousy and wonder.  William also observes how fame, fortune and recognition often require a compromising of both artistic integrity and the musical purity that made the members want to be rock stars in the first place.  Like all the members of the team, as well as the hangers-on, groupies and roadies, William is drawn to rock and roll because it speaks to some indefinable need in his soul - yet, he also learns, through observation, that much of the glamour is really a cover for the insecurities and emotional emptiness of the individuals who comprise this strange, life-in-the-fast-lane world.
Yet, all this makes ""Almost Famous"" sound dark and preachy - which it definitely is not.  On the contrary, Crowe keeps the proceedings light, airy and fast-paced thanks to the fact that William himself always remains such a clear-eyed, steady and likable young man.  William is the anchor that helps keep Crowe's movie real.  This wide-eyed fifteen year old seems far more mature and emotionally grounded than all the older people he is involved with.  These include the band's handsome lead guitarist, Russell Hammond, and a beautiful, sweet and radiant ""band-aid"" named ""Penny Lane.""  As Penny, Kate Hudson literally lights up the screen with warmth, sincerity and vulnerability every time she appears in a scene.  She is truly a natural.  The same can be said for young Patrick Fugit who never hits a false note as William, making him a character the audience can identify with from first moment to last.  Billy Crudup conveys just the right combination of arrogance and good-natured insecurity to make Russell a complex and believable individual.  And the wonderful Frances McDormand steals every scene she is in as William's fretful, up-tight, but obviously loving mother, who can do little but stand back in open-mouthed astonishment, aghast at the ""immoral"" lifestyle of the people who have ""kidnapped"" her child.  Yet, at the same time, something about her child makes her trust that, when the temptations come fast and furious, his innate moral strength - the strength she has imparted to him - will triumph in the end.  Thus, she reluctantly and anxiously allows him to fulfill his dream.
Lovers of early `70's ""classic"" rock will adore the sound, the look and the general time capsule feel of the film.  Crowe has gotten all the ""accoutrements"" of the period absolutely right - from the shaggy hair, to the frenzied concerts, to the casual drug usage to the familiar tunes playing on the soundtrack.  ""Almost Famous"" is a movie to relax into, especially if you yourself came of age in that era.  It will gently carry you back to a past that seems both terribly recent and painfully long ago all at the same time.  Enjoy the journey.",993945600,4,3936,4.969512195121951

1283966,2,B00003CXMG,"This is one of those movies you've heard so much about and are thoroughly disappointed by. ""Almost Famous"" is almost Gidget in it's simple pansy story about Rolling Stone Magazine's cub reporter Cameron Crowe in the early '70s.  The music isn't even relevant of it's day but are even older radio hits. This kid really began to ware on me. I kept wating for something, anything to happen.",993686400,5,387,4.6911764705882355
1283967,5,B00003CXMG,"By the end of watching 'Almost Famous' I felt really cheated. By cheated I mean that I wish I could have lived at that time. It seemed like such an era of real emotion and adventure. Today's commercial world that shows in the music and in the additudes of society makes me feel like something was taken away from me.  By the description above you can tell I really connected with this movie. That's because when I watched it I never saw Patrick Fugit or Billy Crudup or Kate Hudson. I saw William Miller, Russell Hammond, and Penny Lane. It was just so real to me I felt like I was there watching William's life as if I was sitting next to him. I guess it's because the script was based on Crowe's real life and he did actually live the story. Along with the great actors who put themselves into the characters. The realism was unlike anything I've ever seen, it was like watching a documentary but a whole lot more enjoyable. This movie made me see what I missed.  On a different subject I think one actor in this movie who was also a little cheated. His name is Michael Angarano and he played the 11 year old version of William Miller and even though he was only in the movie for the first 8 minuted of dialogue, I thought he was really great. Mike added to the real emotion as well as the older and more well-known actors but nobody in the Amazon.com reviews for this movie recognized that and I would like to be the first.",993427200,2,1426,4.277777777777778
1283968,5,B00003CXMG,"Cameron Crowe wrote and directed ""Almost Famous"", which is fitting since it is largely about his own beginnings. Cameron was the youngest writer for Rolling Stone magazine and, as a teenage journalist, he followed numerous bands as they went on tour. In this film, these bands are rolled up into a four-man group called Stillwater. These guys get my vote for the best band that never was. Since I was just out of kindergarten when the story was set, you should forgive me for thinking, after my first viewing, that Stillwater was an authentic recreation of some famous group from the early 70's. The realism is that perfect!
But this movie is not about a band, at least not predominantly. It is a  coming of age story. A young man raised in an unusual household, with an unusual mother, is taking his first steps to adulthood. The interesting thing is that his first steps are so large as to stretch past most people's entire careers. Through a combination of talent, luck and timing, young William Miller, played perfectly by Patrick Fugit, is recruited by Rolling Stone magazine to write an article on Stillwater. This strange occurrence actually makes sense when you watch the film despite sounding ridiculous as I write it.
If William goes through dramatic changes in a short time, his mother is a rock of stability. Elaine Miller is able to ""freak out"" most people, with a few choice words but to her son, she is home, safety, love and in a way... imprisonment. She is very intense but caring and it is this combination which drives her eighteen year old daughter to a life of airline stewardship. We can see Elaine's true courage however, when she agrees to let the fifteen year old William go ""on the road"" with a drug taking,  womanizing rock band. This, after we have seen her characterize Simon and Garfuncle as ""stoned"" and forbidden their music from her house.
One of the most important people William comes into contact with, on his journey, is Penny Lane. She is a beautiful, glowing, perfectly permed young dryad who follows the bands and has a following of her own. Adamant that she is not a groupie, Penny has created a concept called ""Band Aids."" Her subscribers refrain from sex with the performers in an effort to more truly embrace the pure experience. She talks a good game but in the end, she's just a young woman in love. The object of her affection is Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist and Zen-master for Stillwater. Her situation is complicated after William falls in love with her, at first sight.
Thus Alice enters Wonderland and many an adventure is had. Despite William's best intentions and the good advice of his mentor, Lester Bangs, the band manages to seduce him. His plan, to get in and out before missing a test, is soon discarded in the face of a larger than life rock and roll experience. There is one truly touching scene where the band, (and company), is riding their bus to the next gig and singing along to ""Tiny Dancer."" William leans over to Penny and says, ""I have to go home!"" To which she replies, with a magical pass of her hand, ""You are home."" That says it all.
There are several contrasting character changes happening during the film.  One stands out more than most. William starts his professional career as a fan, loving the band, the music and the whole lifestyle. As the tour progresses and his eyes are opened, he becomes, not jaded but more worldly, professional and wise. Conversely, Penny Lane is introduced to us as the epitome of sophistication. She is young but knowing, and handles William as an older sister might. As the film progresses we discover that Penny is not so all knowing as she seemed. She is just as fragile and naively hopeful as any other girl her age. In the end, it is William that has to send her a reality check.
Everything about this film is fascinating. The music is just wonderful, with Billy Crudup and Jason Lee bringing authenticity to every performance. The band's interpersonal dynamic is almost a character of its own. This climaxes during the famous plane crash scare, when each confesses their deepest secrets to the unrestrained laughter of the audience. William, his Mother and Penny are all unforgettable creations. Crowe is a wonderful writer, so good in fact, that I am disappointed he didn't turn this story into a book. Watching the movie will just have to be enough, for now.",993168000,3,4381,4.701822916666667
1283969,3,B00003CXMG,"This movie does not have the lasting impact of other Crowe films: Singles, Jerry Miguire or Say Anything (all of which rank among my favorite films). If it weren't for Jason Lee (who does and outstanding job given his under developed character) I would have given it a 2.
The story is based around  a young boy with a gift for writting, he teams up with a band grows up a bit along the way. Unlike the other crowe films, I couldn't find any enjoyable characters (save Jason Lee). The predictable story-line just doesn't offer any moments that come close to ""You complete me"", and the ending will leave you unsatisified.
The actors are good, but I believe  a few were cast for the wrong parts.

1283970,4,B00003CXMG,"This movie, along with Dazed and Confused, is one of my favorite looks back at the seventies.  I was just starting to discover rock in the late seventies and aside from the actual LP's and AOR radio, Creem magazine was a guide and a bible.  I remember the dedication and memorial in Creem when Lester Bangs died.  It was great to see Philip Seymour Hoffman portraying the original ""gonzo rock journalist"" and getting to hear a sliver of Bangs's twisted, enthusiastic views on music and being a rock fan.  You can't hide the nerd music lover behind the facade of the cynical rock writer.  I also love his hatred of Rolling Stone, a magazine that regular readers of Creem always knew was a poser and pretender in the world of rock magazines.
The cast are superb.  The boy, Patrick Fugit, is charming and perfectly cast as a shy, naive fledgling reporter.  A lot has been written about Kate Hudson's performance and it's all true.  She convey's self-assuredness and insecurity at the same time.  Billy Crudup's character is likable, despite his bad behavior.  the supporting cast are all outstanding.
The movie, as Cameron Crowe points out in the featurette included on the DVD, is a love letter to seventies rock, the people who perform it and the fans that love it, as a result it's a lightweight film.  Despite the bad behavior of the band and the potential to show the dehumanizing treatment of groupies by misogynistic rock stars the movie glosses it all over and everyone acts with honor.  I don't mind though, there's always room for an up beat movie.  I really enjoyed this movie.  If you liked it I would suggest Dazed and Confused, and This Is Spinal Tap.",992995200,,1662,4.666666666666667

The music is way cool, and captures the era well. Francis McDormand is very outstanding as the know all mom who has to deal with her growing son. Billy Crudup is great as the guitarist/star of the ficticious band: Stillwater. The movie is worth the price itself, but the DVd contains many interesting extras like articles written by Cameron Crowe back when he was kid, that were published in Rolling Stone.

1283972,5,B00003CXMG,"The main character in Almost Famous is a 15 year old rock journalist named William Miller.  He gets the chance to write an article for Rolling Stone magazine about an up and coming rock band, Stillwater.  He goes out on tour with the band and what starts out as a simple assignment, turns into a life altering experience for all involved.  The character of William is director and writer Cameron Crowe's on screen alter ego.  Mr. Crowe was a 15 year old who wrote for Rolling Stone and the story is based on his life.  The film also involves William's overprotective and aggressive mother (played by Frances McDormand) and the battles she waged with his sister.  They are based on Mr. Crowe's own family's struggles and the fact that he was willing to air his family's problems in public adds a touch of humanity and reality to the film.  Stillwater is led by Jeff Bebe and Russell Hammond who bicker at one another about the band's future and possible fame. Billy Crudup plays Russell the lead guitarist and Jason Lee is Jeff the lead singer.  They have a natural fear of the press and refer to William as the enemy.  In fact, William struggles to get an one on one interview with Russell throughout the film.  The band is followed on tour by a bunch of groupies who refer to themselves as Band-Aids.  Their leader is Penny Lane played wonderfully by Kate Hudson.  She is in love with Russell, but it is William whom she confides in.  The tender relationship between Penny & William is one of the film's great strengths. Throughout the film, William seeks and gets advice from legendary rock critic Lester Bangs.  Mr. Bangs is played amazingly by Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Mr. Hoffman provides the film's conscious and his brief time on the screen is electric. All the performances in the film are first-rate including Ms. Hudson who is luminous, Mr. Crudup is brooding and dark, Mr. Lee is self-righteous and Ms. McDormand is a fierce presence.  But the most startling performance is that of Patrick Fugit as William. Mr. Fugit had never appeared in a movie before and had minimal acting experience, but he is the emotional center of the film, the link between al the characters.  He plays William perfectly and captures the essence of what Mr. Crowe was trying to capture.  Mr. Crowe guides the film with an eye for detail as the sets and feeling are completely real and harkens the spirit of the 70's.  His screenplay perfectly balances drama and comedy and has some of the sharpest dialogue in a long time.  Mr. Crowe took home a Best Original Screenplay Oscar at the 2000 Academy Awards for this great script. Almost Famous is Mr. Crowe's love letter to his youth and the 70's.  The film is easily his most personal, but it is the personal touch he adds that gives the film its universal appeal.",992476800,4,2800,4.63894523326572
1283973,5,B00003CXMG,"""Almost Famous"" is a love story, but on different levels than most movies. Of course, you have the love between men and women (Crudup and Hudson) First love (Fugit and Hudson) but also Mother's love for her child (McDormand and Fugit) bandmates love for eachother, the band's love of the rock-n-roll life and most importantly, Crowe's love for rock-n-roll. That's what the movie really is - an ode to rock-n-roll and why it's important to so many of us...Fugit comes of age and experiences love and loss in ways that are familar to us all, backed with a soundtrack of a lifetime.
 Music has always went hand-in-hand with life's little triumphs and loses for me, and it's beautifully examined in the movie. One of my favorite scenes is when the band are at a low point, Crudup and Jason Lee having just had a blow-out and Crudup having gone missing and coming down from an acid trip, when, on the bus, they all slowly join in singing ""Tiny Dancer"" and that just shows you how music can heal all wounds and make wrong things right again. Music will stick by you through good times and bad, and in those little quiet moments of reflection of past memories, who doesn't associate certain events with certain songs?
 It's funny, some of my friends don't 'get' the movie and to truly 'get it', I feel one must have that personal love affair with music that Crowe describes to a tee. I love music. It has changed my life (to use a well-worn cliche) but it's true and this film is a tribute to the love story that many of us have shared with music throughout our lives.",992304000,,1561,4.492957746478873
1284092,5,B00003CXMG,"""Almost Famous"" is a story that you won't forget. Unlike most movies, there isn't a recognizable person to hate, because everyone has their own demons which they use against themselves. Whether it is falling into a trap you have been warned of (figuratively speaking, of course) or repeating your own, sad history. All analogies aside, this movie had a real story. It had depth, while being enjoyable. The intensity was at the right level so that it can be a feel good movie, or a serious film. The music played was spectacular, and brought me back to some of my favorite songs.
We can relate easily to this movie, because the protagonist is an intelligent, normal kid. The mother is everyones worried and paranoid mother, who is under extreme circumstances. The supporting actress (Kate Hudson) is superb in her role. And the band is amazing. This is the kind of movie you can stare at intensely or let it wash over you. This movie was nostalgic for most, and a new adventure for many.",991872000,,986,4.672413793103448
1284093,4,B00003CXMG,"Yes, it's another coming-of-age film but I was completely drawn in because so many details of the 70's-milieu rock scene seem so genuine and accurate -- the characters, the dialogue, the clothing, the settings, the music -- it's all there.  Even the name 'Stillwater' recalls a Lynyrd Skynyrd-type band from the mid-70's.  The scene in which William Miller becomes mesmerized by the album cover art while listening to The Who really hit a nerve with me.  This is exactly how rock fandom begins, the discovery of music and lyrics that seems to be speaking directly and only to you.  Much of the rock world that stays on the periphery of the familiar coming-of-age story is fascinating, and because it feels like it had been informed by insider knowledge, I felt like I had been brought along for the tour.  Moreover, Crowe inserts us into an eminently fascinating period of rock 'n roll, when it was going through one of its cyclical downturns.  On one side, rock music was being slowly strangled by the increasing pursuit of profits by music labels and their increasingly sinister treatment of their artists, and on the other side, there was the oncoming juggernaut of the more danceable, manufactured musical form of disco.  Another highlight for me is Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Lester Bangs.  Why Hoffman is not already a Hollywood star I have no clue.  Crudup, Hudson and McDormand are also very strong and they will certainly contend for Oscar recognition.  My only quibble about the film is that it is content with depicting everything through rose-coloured glasses.  Even the way the film ends with all the loose ends neatly tied up and everybody happy and intact seems a little too disingenuous.  Crowe seems to have ignored the rampant nihilism and misanthropy that existed at the time.  The only person in the whole film who comes off looking like an a**hole is the screeching associate editor of Rolling Stone, and she appears onscreen for only a couple of minutes.  It's strange that although Crowe's semi-alter-ego learns the important journalistic lesson of being ""honest and unmerciful"", that advice appears to have escaped Crowe.  But then I guess this is why he's a filmmaker and not a journalist.",991353600,,2214,4.929919137466308
1284094,3,B00003CXMG,"I like Cameron Crowe's sensibility, and in a climate where all movies are ""edgy"" or ""lightning-paced"" a movie like Almost Famous is a welcome breather.
Cameron Crowe's loose fictionalization of his stint as a journalist for Creem and Rolling Stone can take you back to a time in your life where music really mattered and hit you on a personal level; all the references and the soundtrack can really spark your memory. And watching Patrick Fugit portray an intelligent, kind, passionate, and yet, uncool, music fan strikes a real chord in the heart of every aging teen misfit.
The real blind spot of this movie lies with the lack of emotional substance: as a journalist, William has been warned to remain impartial to the celebrity of musicians, which he does, but he also seems distant from the music itself; Kate Hudson as Penny Lane idolizes the band, but mostly you see her involved in a damaged, temporary fling with no emotional component; Frances McDormand is the greatest success here, yet her maternal embraces kind of fall into a litany of ""don't do drugs, and remember you can't swim"" - you get the idea.
Even with that, Cameron Crowe's films can't be held to that strict a standard. He makes solid films with some reliable emotional spots, with no pretensions to grand style - like a journalist.

The movie genuinely surprises you, and carries with it the ring of truth, in its situations, its dialog and its depiction of an era in time.

She deserved the Oscar nomination.  Ultimately, the film is a bit gentle--it does not amend or revise our cultural insight into the era and environment it portrays; it is not a take-no-prisoners satire; it does not bleed--and that's why I'm giving it a 4 rather than a 5.  It does deserve a 5 for what it is not--not another gross-out comedy, not a violent movie, not unwise, not a badly made movie of which we are seeing way too much these days.",990576000,,985,4.703488372093023
1284099,5,B00003CXMG,"I remember the days before Rolling Stone was mainstream.  It covered the newly emerging world of rock'n'roll and the stars with an upfront and personal hand...Some of the correspondents became as followable as the stars themselves.  Cameron Crowe has converted his memories of life as a 16 year old rock stringer, a career he started on a lark, (with little knowledge of the music)into a very watchable and likeable movie.  This movie leaves you trying to guess who the characters are based on in the real rock world. The cast is outstanding and true to the times.  Patrick Fugit is perfect as the wide eyed, idealistic young man( William Miller, the character Crowe based on himself), entering a world previously unknown to him.  Francis McDormond is William's mother struggling to retain some grasp on her disintergrating family (it is easy to forget how devisive rock music was within families). Phillip Seymour Hoffman, dead on as the world weary Lester Bangs, providing  Willaim Miller with entry to the rock world, while warning him of its dangers.  And luminicent, Kate Hudson as Penny Lane.  It is easy to see this as a star making role for her, she inhabits the role of a proud, ever hopeful ""band aid"" and draws your heart to her.  A wonderful look into the beginnngs of rock and roll, bringing back many , many memories.",990230400,2,1331,4.802631578947368

1284200,3,B00003CXMG,"I have to agree with the other below average reviews after having just seen this, and the lauded performance of Goldie Hawn's daughter pretty much sums up my opinion of the movie: a LOT of hype for very little substance. There is an occasional laugh and reasonably good acting especially by the lead singer, the mentor writer from Creem and the kid weren't too bad.  It seems as if based on many of the reviews, the soundtrack is the real star of this movie which brings up another point.  This assertion that Rock Music was poisoned and a betrayal to its sincere, humble beginnings after 1973 is laughable. Check your CD collection, I bet you've got some music that was made after that that sounds pretty good right? Feel betrayed or that you're being hustled by big bad corporate types when you listen to it?  The only bad thing that happened to Rock at about that time was it was then that the kind of snobbery that still pervades in terms of judging another based on what Rock they listen to began. It's all just subjective rubbish and ""Rock"" is still just Rock -- not Beethoven or Haydn.",989884800,,1092,4.505050505050505
1284201,5,B00003CXMG,"Many people may underrate this film because it didn't win or get nominated for very many Oscars and it didn't hit it big in the box office. But ALMOST FAMOUS is probably the best movie of all time. It's humorous and heartwarming (and I'm a 17-year-old girl who wasn't even born yet in the 70s).
This story is basically about director/writer/producer Cameron Crowe's teenage life as a rock journalist for Rolling Stone magazine. William Miller is Crowe's alter-ego (newcomer, Patrick Fugit) who has to travel around the country with a fictional rock band named Stillwater and get an interview with them. Along the way, William learns about life, true love, how to have fun, and how to ""be cool"".
Some people who actually lived through this time period may feel as though this film is unrealistic. Well, this is one person's view of the 70s and every other person has different experiences so of course you probably wouldn't think this is the kind of thing you did in the 70s.
The stand-out performances are the ones by Billy Crudup (Stillwater's lead guitarist, Russell Hammond), Kate Hudson (Penny Lane), Francis McDormand (Elaine Miller - William's overprotective mother), and of course, Patrick Fugit (William Miller). The supporting cast was excellent, too especially the girl who played Anita Miller, William's older sister, Jason Lee (Stillwater's lead singer), and Ana Paquin's character. Also, the guy who played Lester Bangs was great, as well.
ALMOST FAMOUS isn't just about Crowe's life as a rock writer: it's about rock 'n roll, sex, drugs, love, and everything that was great about the 70s. This is a timeless classic and if you have a great sense of humor and love everything or something about the 70s and don't want to see a movie with cheesy or corny parts, then this is definitely for you! Go buy or rent ALMOST FAMOUS and I know you won't regret it!",989798400,,1867,4.855799373040752
1284202,5,B00003CXMG,"Now Here is Cameron Crowe's best work ever, and considered by many, including myself, to be the best movie that represents 1960's & 70's Rock And Roll. I own the original VHS copy, and have yet to buy the new Bootleg Cut version, which I hear is also something to love. I love the soundtrack, some of the best songs ever and other rarities of Rock and Roll are included.
OK now back to the movie, He picked the best actors for the best parts, like Kate Hudson (who actually is married to a rock star) playing the famous band-aid, Penny Lane. Or newcomer Patrick Fugit as William, the struggling 15 Year Old Rolling Stone Journalist. Or Jason Lee (of Jay And Silent Bob Fame) as Jeff Bebe, the Lead Singer of Made-Up Band, Stillwater. Or how about Billy Crudup as Russell Hammond (and is not in anyway related to the organ company famous for the B3), the guitar player and other artistic focus of Stillwater (I heard some rumor that Crowebar officially recruited Brad Pitt to do Russell, but he was busy doing The Mexican with Julia Roberts).
Now for a minute I wanna talk about something in the movie which was true masterpiece. In the beginning of the movie when William discovers rock and roll through The Who's Tommy, he plays Sparks first. What Crowebar does in the movie, he mixes the first half of the original Tommy Version with the 2nd Half of the Live At Leeds Version as the scene changes to 1973 from 1969. He should have either put that on the soundtrack album or better yet used Amazing Journey attached to Sparks for the album, because that would keep the mood of the Psychedelia and Rock of Sparks. Either way it would have been great.
Anyway, If you are young (like me) or old (doesn't matter) and you are deep into 60's and/or early 70's Rock (Volkswagen Bus and Everything), then you would love this movie! As the chef said, ""I Guarantee!""
And on a closing note, this movie actually takes place at the end of the greatest period in American History, The 60's. Most people say that the 60's ended in 1969, but the spirit of freedom, free-love, drugs, and anti-war protest lived on until 1973. So Lester Bangs was actually sort of right, by '73 Rock and Roll was almost over (""You Made Just It In Time for the death rattle, last gasp, last grope""), but as we all know Rock and Roll never truly died until December 8, 1980, the day John Lennon was assainated. So in one sentences to sum up everything I have said in this review, The 70's were a drag after '73 (why? 1 Word: DISCO!!!!!!!! I HATE DISCO!!!!!!!!!!).",989625600,,2527,4.471861471861472

1284204,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous is a perfect movie.  This is a very bold statement, I know.  I probably won't be able to back the statement up in a few sentences.  You will have to watch Almost Famous to see for yourself.
Cameron Crowe has always been my favorite movie writer/director.  Say Anything.  Singles.  Jerry Maguire.  And now, Almost Famous.  Crowe has an amazing ability to give his characters down to earth personalities.  From the way they give their lines to the expressions on their faces, it is as if the actors in Crowe's films go to ""The Cameron Crowe School for Acting"" before filming.  What makes this aspect of his films interesting for me is that each film is very different from the last, even though they are similar on many levels.
Kate Hudson, Bully Crudup, Patrick Fugit and all the actors were perfectly cast.  Kate Hudson seems to be a natural.  She handled the character of Penny Lane like a pro.  Her facial expressions, the ways she moved and positioned her hands, and her laugh, made Penny Lane seem like an innocent yet mysterious and experienced groupie.
I would like to give special props to Fairuza Balk.  Even though the part was small, Fairuza's Sapphire was a great addition to the film.  I love the scene in which William's Mother called the hotel and Sapphire spoke of what a great boy William was.  Fairuza seems like an old soul, perfect to play a groupie from the 70's.  She reminds me of my Mother's old hippy friends from when I was a kid.
The soundtrack...PERFECT.  The Who, Simon & Garfunkel, Led Zep...and Cameron (or whoever chose the music) picked all of my favorite songs!!
I have not been so in love with a movie like this since... I can't even remember.  One question: Where was Eric Stoltz?",989539200,3,1729,4.609836065573771
1284205,5,B00003CXMG,"This film is a love letter to rock music in the 70s and includes heartfelt performances from the entire cast.  I was particularly struck by Frances MacDormand's portrayal of the ever-patient mother, struggling to remain relevant to her kids during a time of family disruption.  The music is fun - the relationships are fun - and Cameron Crowe neatly ties up all the loose ends by the final credits - it's a good ride!  You'll enjoy it!",989366400,,435,4.623376623376624
1284206,5,B00003CXMG,"After the touching tale of Jerry McGuire, Crowe comes back to write what could be interpreted as a type of self-biographical piece.  As a young kid growing up, Crowe was also a rock journalist, and he acturately portrays the triumphs and downfalls of the profession in this movie.  Crudup and Jason Lee are truly the best two performers in the movie.  Lee gives an outstanding performance as the lead singer of the band Feverdog, and Crudup is a kid who the audience feels for the entire movie.  Crowe's all star cast make him ALMOST FAMOUS among the great directors of his time.  If you like rock music, journalism, or a story about a mid-level band learning what it takes to stay together through the media, ALMOST FAMOUS is definitely a movie you need to check out.",989366400,,768,4.617647058823529

I didn't want to like this movie, but it's so very likeable.  Yeah, there are plenty of corny moments, but there are more moments of honesty than camp.  Kate Hudson was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Penny Lane.  Her performance is endearing, a little provocative, but ultimately vapid.  The real star here is Patrick Fugit.  If for no other reason, see this movie to see his performance.  You have to root for him 'cause he's so damn pure and true to himself despite all the people trying to sway him to their way of thinking.  Someone who has probably received little notice but very much should, is Michael Angarano, the young(er) actor who plays the young(er) William for a few minutes in the film.

1284358,4,B00003CXMG,"I saw this film and thought it was very entertaining.  Cameron Crowe definitely captures the spirit of the time this film takes place in because he lived through that era.  Frankly, I have to laugh at those reviewers(probably people under 30) who found that this film wasn't ""exciting"" or ""funny.""  They can go watch ""The Mummy Part 2"" or ""Joe Dirt"" and I'm sure they'll enjoy themselves since a lot of these people have short attention spans.  Most of today's films contain too much eye candy or roller coaster-like moments.  And as for comedy movies today, a lot of people won't find a film funny unless there is a lot of gross-out humor (or one of the ""stars"" of the film is a former or current member of ""Saturday Night Live."" )
This is what makes ""Almost Famous"" stand out from the crappy movies being made these days.  The humor is subtle at times(""It takes 18 minutes for the machine to copy one page..."") and the actors have a lot of nice dramatic moments.
I liked the performance of Kate Hudson, but I thought the actor who played the lead character was outstanding.  Jason Lee, from Chasing Amy and Mallrats, also gives a good performance as one of the bad members of Stillwater.

1284364,4,B00003CXMG,"The year is 1973 and contrary to popular belief, Rock and Roll is far from dead.  Almost Famous is the story of fifteen-year-old William Miller and his journalistic journey to capture the lives of the rock group, Stillwater, for Rolling Stone magazine.  Through William's adolescent eyes, we get a behind the scenes look at a mid-level rock band and the struggles they go through as a group.
Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical screenplay is superb and the actors bring each and every one of his characters to life.  Frances McDormand is great as William's eccentric and over-protective mother, Elaine.  McDormand will have you laughing with her ""just say no to drugs"" speeches.  Billy Crudup portrays Stillwater's lead guitarist ""Russell Hammond"" just the way you would picture a rock star to be: cool, confident and temperamental.  Patrick Fugit also gives a good performance as the wide-eyed and innocent William, while Kate Hudson gives great energy to the worldly teen Miss Penny Lane.
Almost Famous was definitely one of the best films of 2000.  There have been many movies about Rock and Roll, but Almost Famous is different.  Almost Famous humanizes rock stars and lets the viewer see what their world of drugs, sex, fame and music is all about.  If you are looking to see a movie with great acting, great music and a great script, then look no more, you've found it.",988416000,5,1377,4.952173913043478
1284365,5,B00003CXMG,"Every time they do a writer story I get all choked up.  This is like Shakespeare in Love only different.  Like Shakespeare in Love?  WHAT?  Well, we have a writer as the hero.  And...?  And he's in love.  And...?  Okay the rest is different except that he's really working hard to be a success and he's around performers and...  Anyway ""it's all happening.""  By the way, that should be ""It's all happening at the zoo"" a lyric from the Simon and Garfunkel album in the opening scene.
Okay, okay.  I'm having a little trouble with this one.  I thought it was just so, so cute, and so touching and warm, even though I know it's only ""[my] rock and roll fantasy.""  However I don't care.  I watched practically the whole thing with tears in my eyes, partially from nostalgia from the music and the clothes and the hair styles done so perfectly, and partly because the story of ""Penny Lane,"" sweet flower child groupie, ""seamstress for the band"" (to borrow a lyric) who has a ""rock and roll record"" to borrow another lyric (Great White, this time) who wears her sophistication on her sleeve to cover her heart that's also there.  And for a slightly nerdish kid who grows up before our eyes and falls in love and is too young to really be loved in return, a nervous writer on his first assignment who overwrites and sees the best in people, even as they treat him like a little girl, a kid who is so, so unsure of himself.  (Is writer and director Cameron Crowe again reprising his youth as he did so well in the script for the now classic coming of ager, Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)?)
Kate Hudson (Goldie Hawn's daughter) is unforgettable in a completely original creation dreamed up (or better yet, probably remembered) by Crowe, who here improves on his fine directorial work in Jerry Maguire (1996).  I understand that Sarah Polley (The Sweet Hereafter 1997) was originally picked to play the part of Penny Lane, and she is a fine talent, but quite frankly Kate Hudson stole all the scenes she was in (she learned it from her mother!) and I don't think the movie would have been quite the beguiling, bittersweet experience it was without her.
Billy Crudup (a name to look at twice) manages to look exactly like all the wanna-be rock stars of the seventies wished they had while exuding the kind of charm that breaks hearts as Russell Hammond, guitarist for the band and Penny's true love.  Patrick Fugit is William Miller the would be teenaged writer as hero who is charming, boyish, vulnerable and well, heroic.  Frances McDormand plays his mother with just the right combination of pigheaded earnestness and her unique sense of the comedic.
The entire cast was terrific and the characters were truly original.  The Academy Award winning script was clever and at times profound, interspersed with sparkling lines.  (My favorite, from Lester Bangs on William's school mates: ""You'll meet them all again on their long journey to the middle."")  Also, and this is important, Crowe paid close attention to detail throughout and never lost his concentration.  Everything seemed amazingly authentic right down to the floral stitch on Russell's shirts and the bottles of Jack Daniels in his hands.  And nothing was done in a routine manner.  Every scene was carefully planned and even minor characters were roundly developed.  I'm thinking in particular of Lester Bangs, mentor and cynical rock critic brought to life in a fine performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and William's sweet and slightly dippy sister, vividly portrayed by Zooey Deschanel.  Notice how Crowe even took the trouble to satirize flight attendants with the parody of the stewardess uniforms (day glow orange!).
Yes, I loved this film, and I predict that the Academy, whose members obviously did not really SEE this film, will be rewarding the producers sometime down the road for the oversight.",988416000,8,3867,4.793363499245852

But then the rest of the movie, instead of being his ""future"", turns out to be a boring film diary of goofball antics on the road-- sort of a ""Summer School"" type movie with much more pretention.  Of course there are a few funny moments-- Billy Crudup on the roof shouting ""I am a golden god!""; the deflowering scene is amazing.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance also lends the film a lot of quality and cred (I think he should ask for it back).  But ultimately, we've got this doe-eyed kid who never says a sentence more than three words long, and we're expected to believe he's a wunderkind music journalist.  Furthermore, this movie has all the emotional content of the song ""Do you believe in magic?""  Sitting through it was like chewing gum for way, way too long.

The movie has a lot to say about this particular period in our country's history, taking us back in time to a place where happiness was achieved not solely through drugs and sexual practice, but also through bringing entertainment and joy into peoples' lives through music. The movie has a lot of sparkle and comedy to it, which makes it shine like no other film of this genre since ""Forrest Gump.""
The story is based on actual events of director Cameron Crowe's life, his interactions with a band just getting to know itself, and his own self-discovery as he becomes involved in more than he bargained for. The protagonist surrounded by all of this is William Miller, who lives with his mother and sister in San Diego. He was put in the first grade at the age of five, which makes him a senior at the age of fifteen. Without a father, his mother has become a control freak, dominating every aspect of her childrens' lives until his sister cannot take it anymore and leaves. This sets up the coming stages of William's life: he finds his sister's collection of record albums, which his mother describes as ""the poetry of drugs and promiscuous sex,"" at which point the movie shoots ahead to his fifteenth year.
His introduction to the head of ""Creem"" magazine leads him to new heights: he is given an assigment to write a column about Black Sabbath, leading him to meet the band Stillwater as well as Penny Lane, part of a group of girls known as the Band Aids, who are basically groupies without that particular title. At this point in the film, William's character is seen in many different lights: he's vulnerable to the many degrading aspects that come along with the rock-n-role lifestyle, yet he is completely entranced by finally getting out and into the mix of it all, especially so close to the real action. Crowe is magnificent in bringing out his childish wonderment and awe, which will serve as the higher power for the rest of the film.
After receiving a call from Rolling Stone magazine, William is given the opportunity to travel across the country with the band in order to write a full-length article on them. His experiences with the band and their followers provide us with an in-depth look at the music as well as the complications and arguments that arise from its creation. The band brinks on falling apart at various points throughout the film, and it's interesting to see all of this play out onscreen. William is thrown into a mix of things he has never experienced: drugs, sex, music, parties, screaming fans, to mention a few. He never does any drugs, but his resistance to them sets him apart from the rest of the crowd, and his struggle to fit in with everyone becomes hindered.
From his first interactions with Penny Lane (which, by the way, is not her real name), he develops a deep interest in her, even though the feeling is not completely mutual. Penny is involved with Russell Hammond, the member of the band most focused on by William as well as the movie, and her relationship with him goes against everything she claims that the Band Aids stand for (""Groupies sleep with rock stars because they want to be near someone famous. We're here because of the music"").
And that's what the movie is really all about: showing us that people are not what they say they are, or what they appear to be. Everyone in this movie has, beneath their thin veneer, has a deeper human feeling, or something that they haven't shared right away. The band's discord is one such example of this: they have problems with Russell, who they think is taking away from their fame, and their proclamation that they care more for satisfying their fans is countered by these very arguments. Penny and Russell's relationship will reveal something much fuller about both of their characters, as they come to terms with what they have experienced and what they really want in life.
William's character is the most complex out of the group. His journey from a protective mother to the wilds and thrills of the rock scene becomes an engaging trip for the audience. His devotion to writing his article soon becomes less important, trading this plot point for William's coming-of-age in the midst of a revolution in musical history. He still retains his values and moral beliefs, and he even picks up new ones along the way.
Everything about this movie is fun and entertaining. It's got lots of elements at work in it: there's lots of loud music that has meaning, there's a human story behind that music, there's a little bit of romance, themes about friendship, loyalty and trust... do I need to go on? Everything here comes to life in this movie, whether it be the bright and airy attitudes embodied in the characters, or the delightful costumes and set pieces that bring the beginning of the 70's to life in vivid detail. There are bursts of comedy and deep thought that combine in bringing this era to life as well, keeping the movie entertaining and meaningful all at the same time.
Crowe also employs one of the best ensemble casts of 2000. Billy Crudup plays Russell Hammond deeply and with emotion, while Kate Hudson supplies cheeriness and bright wonderment to the movie. Frances McDormand is a nicely rendered controlling mother, while Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the voice of advice for William, who is portrayed exquisitely by newcomer Patrick Fugit. This is a dynamic collection of acting talent from all arenas, bringing a diversity and nostalgia to the movie that keeps it alive and frivolous.
""Almost Famous"" bubbles over with the sheer joy and happiness that the era was filled with, and it succeeds in bringing that joy to life. It tells an involving story about a boy who sees more than most were ever able to, giving us a unique view of a unique group of people. Its ideas are in the right place, as are its messages and elements. I felt a great sense of exhilaration in watching this movie; it has a little magic in it for everyone to share.",987465600,3,6396,4.686222222222222
1284495,5,B00003CXMG,"This film is amazing when you begin to think that it is basically true.  This really happened to the writer/director Cameron Crowe. The characters in this film are probably the best developed ones, considering they don't say much.  The majority of their development occur through silent looks.  This is an amazing accomplishment in my eyes.  Check out the Tiny Dancer scene on the bus, this is one of the greatest uses of music in a film since the Wise Up scene in Magnolia.  This scene summaries the entire feel of the film, it's amazing.  Stillwater's music is awesome and has the classic feel that it needs.

This was an opportunity to make a great, or at least fun, movie about the music and larger than life characters from 1970s rock and roll.  Instead, it's a flop.  The movie gives us an excellent soundtrack, but we learn nothing about the artists who made that music.  It presents us with some interesting characters, but they are not portrayed in any depth.  There is some potential in the storyline -- a 15 year old away from home for the first time touring with a rock band -- but the story we are given is boring mishmash about flunkie groupies and shallow, moronic rock stars.

First of all know that I consider this movie along with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Billy Elliot"" the very best of 2000. Cameron Crowe really nailed this one.

1284596,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous is a charming movie with heart and soul rarely found in today's mire of blockbusters. I found Almost Famous appealing on many different levels, and while it wasn't a tremendously funny film, I wore a snug smile continually while watching it.
On one level, it's a great movie about a talented and earnest teenager commissioned by Rolling Stone Magazine to write a feature on a rock band called Stillwater (they don't know he's only fifteen, of course). His name is William Miller, and he has become liberated from the vehement values of his mother through rock music. He develops a passion for it, and his role as a young rock critic garners the attention of Rolling Stone. On the road with the band, he meets (and becomes infatuated with) Penny Lane, a groupie whose character (played by the lovely Kate Hudson) is heartbreakingly delicate. She tries to rationalize her existence and rejects the notion of being emotionally damaged by this fantasy world lacking morality.  William is saddened by how Russell (Stillwater's guitarist) treats her, and helps her out in the end. William also befriends the aforementioned guitarist Russell, and their developing relationship allows them both to learn from each other.
On an ancillary level, it's a movie about rock music. During William's travels with the band, the band scores with a successful record, endures battles of ego, and goes through management changes. Although Stillwater is a fictional band, the script and director's canny sense of time and the business could trick you into thinking they were real. It's about the pragmatics versus of ideals of the industry. It's about a critic's integrity, the cruelties of the biz, and more.
Why this movie is so wonderful is that it's a great movie about growing up. William's exploits with the band parallel coming-of-age for most teenagers. He is a starry-eyed idealist who witnesses the broken hearts and inclemency of the real world, yet still steadfastly clutches at confidence and optimism. William is a smart kid, and his character is very well-acted with the right amounts of naivet and youthful exuberance to add credence to his role. Great, great movie.",987292800,12,2175,5.0584958217270195
1284597,5,B00003CXMG,"This movie was incredible, there wasn't a thing about it that I didn't like. What I enjoyed most was the use of music to emphasize what was happening in the film. In almost every scene there was a different piece of music in the background, or foreground to set the mood. Music is a large part of our lives, and its ability to take us back to specific times and places is amazing, and this movie will do that for the viewer.",987206400,,424,4.182926829268292
1284598,5,B00003CXMG,"The media has done an effective job of convincing the world that nothing existed between the Baby-Boomer generation and Generation-X, between the 1960s and the 1980s.
However, there was indeed another generation in-between, that is quite different from those who came before and those who came after.  While the Baby-Boomers were (and still are) primarily concerned with ideology and rebelling against their parents, the generation that came of age in the 1970s was primarily concerned with art - especially rock music - and spirituality.
Cameron Crowe is the first person from this generation to create an accurate portrayal of the 1970s and our generation.  How far off most previous depictions have been, is easily demonstrated by the media equating the 70s and .... disco !  Disco didn't start until the 1970s were OVER.
All the characters in the film, from William Miller and Penny Lane, down through the Zeppelin fan to the partygoers in Topeka, are all amazing accurate and correspond closely to people who I knew at the time.
All the locations in the film, particularly backstage at the San Diego Sports Arena and at the Continental Hyatt on the Sunset Strip, were also amazingly accurate - not only in terms of the look and feel , but also in terms of what went on there - as I was there, in both locations, during the 70s.  (The scenes were really shot on location, with current furnishings replaced by what used to be there in 1973.)
And, furthermore, all the dialogue was precisely the way we talked in the 70s, as well as what we would talk about.  And, lastly, the music was really what we listened to.  You couldn't avoid hearing Elton John, Led Zeppelin, Neil Young and The Who, among many others.
All this amazing accuracy is made possible by the film being an autobiography.  The claims that it is ""only semi-autobiographical"", seem on close examination to be mainly for legal purposes, like the disclaimer at the end that all the characters are fictional, when in fact I've met personally more than one of the well-known named personalities in the film.
What is remarkable is that Cameron was able to remember so clearly many of the tiny details, details which make the film like a time machine for those of us who ""came of age"" in the 1970s.
It's very satisfying that now the record has been set straight, and that there is finally a true depiction of those times, that are of great significance in the lives of a generation who previously were not even acknowledged as existing!
Many thanks to Cameron Crowe for putting us on the map!

1284599,5,B00003CXMG,"This original screenplay won an academy award this year and I can understand why.  There's a lot of heart in it as it's based on the writer/director Cameron Crowe's own experience as a teenage writer for Rolling Stone Magazine.
The young Patrick Fugit is cast as William Miller,  the 15-year-old reporter who, with a combination of pluck and luck manages to get an assignment to write about the fictional rock band, Stillwater.  He's a true innocent and plays the role with wide-eyed wonder as he winds up traveling with the band, much to the upset of his mother, played by Frances McDormand.  Billy Crudup, with his chiseled good looks plays the lead guitarist of the band and his role goes beyond the stereotype of a rock musician.  And then there is the lovely Kate Hudson, who adds sparkle and sensitivity to her role as a groupie.  William Seymour Hoffman also adds his talents as the writer/rock critic who the young William looks up to as his mentor.  It's a great cast.
The best part of this film, though,  was the way the screenplay captured the time and place of the rock music scene of the 70s.  Some of the music was original and some were old favorites such as ""America"" by Simon and Garfunkel, ""Every Picture tells a Story"" by Rod Stewart and :The Wind"" by Cat Stevens.  The details were all there -- the attitude, clothing, and youthful energy that was so much a part of the times.  I couldn't help but notice though that even though drugs were talked about, there wasn't much on-screen drug use. This is to the film's credit which was, basically, about the relationships between the people as well as the music.
The world that this film captures so well is long gone.  The characters have grown up and the young reporter is now a successful Hollywood screenwriter. The intensity of the times have faded and we now live in a world of computers and cell phones.  What a delight it was though to again feel the pulse of the 70s and hear the music once again.",987033600,4,1971,4.54957507082153
1284600,5,B00003CXMG,"If you are a fan of 1970s rock n' roll then this is the movie for you. Cameron Crow's autobiographical film is both an homage and love letter to a bygone era. We follow William Miller (Cameron Crowe's alter ego)as he discovers both the backstage world of rock n' roll and a little about himself. He travels with the fictional band Stillwater (purportedly based on real life bands the Allmand Bros., the Eagles and Led Zepplin)to get his first big story for Rolling Stone Magazine. During these travels William must deal with his strong-willed mother, a groupie (though she denies this)named Penny Lane and various band musicians with massive egos. In the hands of a lesser director this story could have become a crass farce. Instead Crowe brings us a moving story about growing up. Special note she be made of the Oscar nominated performance by Kate Hudson. She has a very special presence in this film. Also,this film has a brilliant soundtract which features such '70s icons as Elton John, Cat Stevens,Lynyrd Skynyrd,Rod Stewart,and Led Zepplin. The extras on this DVD include a very interesting documentry on the making of the film. What is missed is a commentary track by Crowe,himself, which I think many of the film's fans were waiting for.

1284704,2,B00003CXMG,"The tone of this movie left so much promise from all the trailers put out upon its release.  When I finally rented it last weekend, I was quite dissapointed.  The fifteen year old genius seems out of place on the road with the fictitious band Stillwater.  This fifteen year old does not even have any passion for rock n roll music.  He is just a good writer who happens to be underaged.  The only reason he was into music was because his sister left him a handful of records.
The comments about the rock n roll era being on its death bed and that Cameron Crowe arrived just in time for the death rattle is ludicrous.  1973 was the golden age of rock n roll as many styles of music were still considered cool.
The road trip scenes were pretty interesting and the presence of the groupies seemed like they were depicted fairly accurately.  However, the pace of the movie just dragged and dragged with little of consequence that was in any degree memorable.

Well, that ...... not only didn't get paused, I ended up reading those priceless Rolling Stone Interviews until 3 AM! While not quite American Graffiti, it was still an excellant movie. I agree that the voters for the Acadamy awards were too busy fawning over Russell Crowe to give this one a fair shot, but that's ok, we the folks who really appreciate Almost Famous, know a good movie when we see one. I am only two years younger than Crowe, and this movie took me right back to the 70's, and rock's last blast. Now, here is my only criticism of this movie, and it is a serious one. By naming the fictional band ""Stillwater"", they have stolen the identity of the real 70's band of that name. The real Stillwater was Capricorn Records' stablemate of the Allman Brothers., Fronted by Jimmy Hall, Stillwater had a hit with a song called ""Mindbender"" co-written by Buddy Buie of The Atlanta Rhythm Section back in 1977. Very cool song, the chorus, ""My daddy was a Gibson, my mama was a Fender, that's why they call me, Mindbender.."" was sung through a talkbox, ala Joe Walsh and Peter Frampton. (I am surprized that Cameron Crowe overlooked or ignored that. Plus, in a search on online, I have found another band named Stillwater, with a CD released in 1998. Hence, my opening question, Just how many Stillwaters are there? Well time to watch this one again, Almost Famous is 2 hours well spent.

And that classic example he gave us, was not even an example.  She was trying to be strong, and not show her true emotions.  Doesn't he remember what she said in the car on the way to LA.  Obviously he has no clue what it is to be a girl. The film may have not gotten to in Stillwater, but maybe that is because the film is based on a boy who loves music.

He is equally good at handling teenagers and adults in his work without making them look like caricatures.  This is based upon his own life when he went on the road at age 15 to first write about rock and roll music for ""Rolling Stone.""  He toured with a band and came to know a very different world from his very sheltered home life.  His mother, a college professor played by Frances McDormand, could be called overprotective, both in the movie and in real life, but certainly her results in child rearing indicate she was a great success at it.

Billy Crudup does a star turn as the lead rock n'roller that the boy comes to know.  You are attracted to him while also seeing his self absorbed behavior.  Kate Hudson plays the girl groupie who tours with the band and is used by them, especially by Crudup's character.  Hudson shows a lot of acting promise and she has none of the irritating mannerisms of her mother (Goldie Hawn).  Patrick, who plays the young Crowe, does a wonderful job throughout too.  I am not a big rock n' roll fan but you don't really need to be to enjoy this movie.  Crowe understands people and he renders them as perfectly as the rock music scene, which makes this a movie everyone can enjoy.  Crowe deservedly won the Oscar for his writing.

I think the reason ""Almost Famous"" was so widely praised was because there were so many people who grew up during that time period and recall it fondly.  Watching the film probably helped bring back good memories, the way ""American Graffiti"" would to kids of the early 60's.  The difference between those two films is that ""American Graffiti"" had deeper characters that you could identify with regardless of when you grew up.  ""Almost Famous"" doesn't have that, and that's where it falls apart.  Apart from Billy Crudup's character, there's no a whole lot of character depth going on here.  Kate Hudson's character is supposed to be more than simply a groupie, but the film fails to rise her above that.  Classic example: when she's told she's been traded to another band for a case of beer, her reaction is cute, but because she acts so blase about it, that's how we feel about her.  It's a pattern that occurs throughout the film that undermine it.
And while I'm sure most of the stuff in the film actually did happen to Crowe, it doesn't mean it can't feel contrived.  An Elton John singalong on a rancorous tour bus brings everyone together?  A near plane crash gets everyone to spill their guts?  There are too many ""movie moments"" like that that ring false.  A better film like ""Spinal Tap"" takes those cliches and uses them as commentary rather than content, which is where ""Almost Famous"" gets it wrong.  It's too worried about being nostalgic that all the bad things are ignored or given a palatable sheen.
And there's no sense of urgency in the film.  The afore-mentioned plane scene, Fugit's missing graduation, Hudson's hotel room scene: there's no real sense of danger in any of these scenes because the film refuses to go deeper into its subject matter.
Last complaint: I'm sure legally it wasn't possible, but if this is all based upon Crowe's experience, why not use those bands rather than a composite band whose music you don't really learn anything about?  You hear about one minute of ""Fever Dog"" in the film.  How do you know the Stillwater is any good?  Or that Crudup's character really is a good guitarist?  You don't, and that's part of why the film lacks depth.  For a film obsessed with music, its main characters don't really make any of it.
I think people were so hungry for a halfway decent film last year that they globbed onto this one as brilliant just because of what it was based upon.  It isn't a brilliant film, and time will bear that out.  ""Spinal Tap"" and ""Woodstock"" are the greatest rock and roll films ever, because they already know music is something special, while ""Almost Famous"" spends all of its time trying to tell you the obvious.",986342400,11,2697,4.673728813559322
1284712,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous is a delight from beginning to end.  Cameron Crowe's valentine to his youth is warm and very funny, touching without being sacharine, and beautifully written and played.
Newcomer Patrick Fugit is a terrific find as the 15 year old Rolling Stone writer, bright but inexperienced, innocent but learning fast.  Kate Hudson is enchanting as Penny Lane the premier ""band-aid"". Frances MacDormand hilarious as the eccentric but caring mother.  Billy Crudup is charismatic as the lead guitarist and Jason Lee as the insecure lead singer. Philip Seymour Hoffman, again, does wonders with a small cameo role...indelible as the ascerbic and acute Lester Bangs. All the surrounding players are excellent.
As Cameron Crowe says in one of the extras on the DVD he likes to make movies about the ""small moments"" that change your life.  He has done so here.  All of it rings true, because it IS true...Crowe lived it and remembers with fondness  the people who helped shape him.
I don't know, if you don't like movies where stuff doesn't blow up every 5 minutes, this isn't for you.  And, if the characters have to be venal and crass or cruel and violent....give this a pass.  After all, the Academy did in favor of an empty formula epic (Gladiator).  But, if you like movies with people who are flawed but basically decent, and movies with a heart....this is your flick.  Oh....and great music too.",986256000,,1398,4.885593220338983

I couldn't help but envy the main character. This is undoubtedly the best movie released last year. It deserves more than just an Acadamy Award for the screenplay. Ask Roger Ebert or the guys from the Oxnard Star(see the Time Out section from March 23). Look at the sales of the DVD. Just because the itiots at the Academy did not give it a Best Picture nomination doesn't mean that it doesn't deserve it more than any of the films nominated this year- and possibly last year too.

I could probably write for pages on what makes this the best movie of the year, ie acting, directing, story, soundtrack.  Trust me when I say watch this movie.  Watch Almost Famous if you want to be told a good story; watch it to watch Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Kate Hudson, Frances McDormand, and Jason Lee turn in some of the best performances in movie history; but more importantly than that, watch Almost Famous if you love music.

Hence for someone like me who happens to have grown up during the 90's and having a very faint idea about the rollicking 70's(yeah that of sex,drugs an' rock an' roll)this movie was about alot of things. Music,friendship,love and most importantly growing up which is not a easy thing to do. Hence through the eyes of a fifteen year old unfolds a story which is extremely engrossing and bittersweet. While watching this movie my attention did not waver even for a single second because I wanted to catch every word and every expression. There are a host of characters in this movie Russell the enigmatic band leader,Penny Lane the lovely but somehow naive bandaid,William's overprotective but endearing mother and finally young william who just wants to be cool.

1284807,4,B00003CXMG,"I did not see Almost Famous at the theater but looked forward to seeing the film on DVD.  I was not disappointed.
From Patrick Fugit as William Miller, the young writer, to Frances McDormand as his mother, to Billy Crudup as the lead guitarist of the band that William goes on tour with, the performances are extraordinary.  When you add in Kate Hudson in a luminescent role as Penny Lane, a groupie (excuse me, Band-aid) and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the editor of Creem magazine, you have a film that is like a great desert.  You savor each scene, and can't wait to see what happens next.
The DVD is crisp in terms of audio and crystal clear in terms of video.  The soundtrack, which could have been either predictable or purposefully obtuse turns out to be just right.  If you can make it through the ""Tiny Dancer"" scene without a smile on your face, you are unsalvageable.
I did not particularly enjoy the seventies.  I was exactly the age of William in this film, but actually enjoyed the music of the fifties and early sixties better at the time.  (I am the product of a family that listened to early Elvis, country, and classic fifties rock).  However, this film gives me an appreciation of the era.
Cameron Crowe captures the feel of a segment of society that has come through the late sixties flower-power era and has developed a hard-edge, in things like their drug use and their attitudes towards money and success. At the same time, he portrays them as what they truly were - just kids who wanted to make music, write, be part of the scene, but, at the same time, realized that being successful at what they did was not necessarily a bad thing.
Buy this DVD and enjoy it.  It is not the perfect masterpiece that certain people have professed it to be, but it is darned close and that is more than I can say for most of the films I have seen in the last 5 years.",985996800,,1873,4.405797101449275

1284809,5,B00003CXMG,"I absolutely adore ALMOST FAMOUS...it's now my most favorite film of all time. Before this movie, I never really cared much for Cameron Crowe's works and didn't really know a lot about him except that he had directed JERRY MIGUIRE, which I never saw. I'm 17 years old, a girl who's never got to experience the '70s or '60s, and after seeing this movie in the theaters, I wish I had gotten to really experience those two unforgettable decades. Living through those two decades must have been great! Anyway, I thought THE SIXTH SENSE was a great film. I thought THE BREAKFAST CLUB was an incredible film. I thought TITANIC was the best movie in the world. Well, I was right about all of that - that is, until I saw ALMOST FAMOUS. I fell in love with the film almost instantly. ALMOST FAMOUS is not just a cheap comedy about the 70s, it's a drama with a beautifully written story, and Cameron Crowe had definitely deserved that Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, which I was thrilled the film won. The acting in this film is perfectly flawless by the entire cast - nobody else could have been more perfect for the roles than the diverse, incredible assemble of actors Cameron Crowe had chosen for this film. Each role was made especially for these actors - they were all meant to be in this beautiful film; it was their destinys!
Although ALMOST FAMOUS's plot isn't a very difficult one to understand - most people would be able to understand it with ease - it's basically about Cameron Crowe's life as a teenager and working as a rock journalist for Rolling Stones Magazine. The film starts out when William Miller (Cameron Crowe's alter-ego, played wonderfully by newcomer, Patrick Fugit) is about seven or eight years old, I think. He is very smart, so he has skipped several grades. He lives with his very overprotective - so overprotective that it's funny - mother, Elaine Miller (played by Academy Award winner Frances McDormand) and older sister, Anita Miller (played by Zooey Deschanel). Anita leaves home because she hates living there and not being able to do anything on her own, but she doesn't leave until she tells William that he will, ""One day be cool..."". So finally, when William is 15 years old, and he is a senior in high school. The other high school students don't like him and make fun of him because he is younger and smarter. William soon discovers his love for writing, especially journalism. So he writes several articles to a local town music magazine called CREEM. The editor of CREEM Magazine hires him instantly, and puts him with an assignment right away. To interview a rock band. When that doesn't work out the way William has expected it to, he gets a call from the editor of Rolling Stones Magazine, who wants him to get an interview of Stillwater, a popular fictional rock band. So they send him on Stillwater's ""Almost Famous"" Tour. William gets lots of advice from the editor of CREEM Magazine like he can't make friends with the band because he is supposed to be the band's enemy. And lots and lots of advice from his mother like, don't take drugs and he'd better make sure he comes back in time for his high school graduation...more like demands than advice! When he goes off on the tour, trying desperatly to get an interview from the band, he begins to realize Stillwater isn't what they all seem to be. And he falls in love with the mysterious band-aid, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), who's a couple years older than him. While trying to get Stillwater's interviews, William tries to win over Penny, who is in love with Stillwater's lead guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup). But Russell Hammond is married to someone else, even though he's got deep feelings for Penny, too.
Simply a beautiful film. The best movie ever created, in my eyes. The music is so amazing, too. And although I'm not a huge rock fan, this movie has made me appreciate 70s and 60s rock music more. One of my favorite sceens of this whole film is the unforgettable sceen where they are all in the tour bus and singing Elton John's, ""Tiny Dancer"" - watching that sceen nearly made me cry, and I don't do that often while watching most movies! Patrick Fugit is so adorable and now one of my favorite new actors of all time, and so is Kate Hudson. I was really ashamed of the Academy Awards for snubbing this film for the likes of GLADIATOR, TRAFFIC, CHOCOLAT, and CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (which I would have seen by the way, except that CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON was all in subtitles, and I absolutely hate subtitles!). I truly thought ALMOST FAMOUS deserved more Oscars than it had won and been nominated. Sure, it hadn't hit it big in the box office - which I can't understand why, to all of those snobbish people who missed this film! - but just because it didn't make it big in the box office, doesn't mean it's a bad film and shouldn't be at least nominated for many Oscars! How dare those damn' Academy Awards. At least make the winners more diverse and not have the same few not-so-great films win all the Oscars. ALMOST FAMOUS should have won and been nominated for Best Picture, and Cameron Crowe should have been nominated and won Best Directing. Kate Hudson or Frances McDormand - either one, I don't really care, though I'd prefer Kate Hudson - should have won Best Supporing Actress. And this film should have won Best Film Editing, which it was also up for. I'm sure the Academy looks back now at the mistake they have made and are very ashamed for making such a crime. Hopefully, next year, the Academy Awards will choose more wisely which movie should win what award. I definitelyr recommend this film. If there is one and only one film you could ever see, then it should definitely be ALMOST FAMOUS. Go buy it - I know you will not regret it!",985824000,3,5784,4.594777562862669

Needless to say,I was quite disappointed.  What's the big deal with Kate Hudson?  She had a few good lines, but all she did was prance around and smile. The young man who played Crowe should've had the movie all to himself, because he did a fine job, and followed through with his dialogue, sincerity of the character, and the innocence that was showing in his face as became quickly involved in such a corrupt, whirlwind environment. It was sweet of Penny Lane to give the Stillwater leader Crowe's address.  But that was such a cheap ending.",985737600,3,683,4.528455284552845

All the performances are right on target! The screenwriting never feels contrived or rushed. It's brilliantly done. First to applaud the performances. Patrick Fugit, Kate Hudson, Frances McDormand, Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, Philip Seymour Hoffman, all give excellent performances. Even the characters that aren't big parts are great. I loved Fariuza Balk and Zooey Desmerack (I don't think I spelled that right at all) whose characters had small but pretty important parts. Fugit gives a wonderful debut. He's adorable with his dimples and his innocence. I can't say enough good things about this movie. I'd give it a thousand stars if I could. All I can say is if you enjoy a good movie with some great character development and a good story, then I highly suggest that you rent this! It'll be an experiences you'll never forget.

From an audio perspective, the sound quality of the DVD is music to your ears.  I personally have a Dolby Digital 5.1 setup, and it is one of the best sounding DVD's in my collection.  The music of the film is also great, and very symbolistic of the early 70's rock era.

1284895,5,B00003CXMG,"""Almost Famous"" is one of a VERY few movies I bought without seeing it first and I'm so glad I did. The cast is enchanting, especially Patrick Fugit, as William Miller in his film debut, and the charming Kate Hudson as Penny Lane, the first ""band-aid."" Billy Crudup was perfect in his portrayal of a ""rock star"" with an ego, as was Jason Lee as lead singer of ""Stillwater.""
Since I'm a music journalist myself, I can vouch that just about everything in the film is pretty much how things go. From your name missing from the list, to your photo pass being confiscated by the venue at the last minute, to the interviews with the ""egos,"" to the interviews with the guys that have so much talent they aren't on an ego trip, and ALWAYS a deadline staring you down. I've seen it all and I really empathized with the William Miller character and his constant trials to get his interview with Russel Hammond (Cruddup), while trying to placate the head honchos ""Rolling Stone.""
This film was just so REAL! I know it's based on Cameron Crowe's years with ""Rolling Stone,"" but as a journalist I still remember how thrilled I was with ALL ACCESS passes, interviews with stars I never in my wildest dreams thought I'd meet, the tour buses I visited and many other things. I think any music lover wants to be in those shoes!
Being out of the country back in the '70s, I wasn't aware of the ""band-aids not groupies thing,"" but their part in the story is critical to William's growth as both a journalist and a man - especially Kate Hudson's character Penny Lane. Frances McDormand turns in a stellar performance as well as William's mother. Hudson and McDormand indeed deserved their Oscar Nominations. The music in this movie is also outstanding, if a bit nostalgic.
The DVD may not have as many ""Special Features"" as others I've seen, but I really enjoyed Cameron Crowe's narration of how things were accomplished (Peter Frampton taught the Actors in the band to play for real!), the numerous pictures of Cameron with Rock Legends insterspersed with scenes from the film and the actual articles he wrote for Rolling Stone.
Most of the rest of the Special Features are bios and photos of cast members and the actual movie makers, but they were still interesting to read. I'm not used to reading most of the Special Features on a DVD, but none of the ""extras"" on the DVD version were a disappointment, although the ""Jerry McGuire"" moments seemed a bit out of place to me.

At least the Academy did right by it by giving it the screenplay Oscar. The DVD is wonderful. I especially enjoyed the 'making of' with the interviews and the addition of the actual Rolling Stone articles by Cameron Crowe. The day I received it, all I wanted to do was finish work so I could go home and relive the great experience that this movie is. The acting is superb and fresh. From the naive yet worldly Penny Lane as played by Kate Hudson to the star struck William (Patrick Fugit) right on through the entire cast, there are no insignificant roles in this picture. We even get the bonus of watching Phillip Seymore Hoffman and Frances McDormand in action, however briefly. But with them it's quality not quantity. Everyone contributes something worthwhile. Stillwater, the fictional band that everyone wishes were real, has that classic rock presence that today's real bands could learn from. In a time before we were forced to endure Brittney and the boy bands, this is what music was like. I was only 5 in 1973 but seeing Almost Famous is the one (and only) thing that makes me wish I was older. When I saw this film for the first time, I remembered why it is I loved movies and couldn't wait to go and see it again.

1284898,5,B00003CXMG,"When this movie first came out in the theaters I really didn't have a huge desire to see it.  I knew that it was getting great reviews, especially acting wise, but I passed on it.  How stupid was I?  After seeing Kate Hudson win several awards, including the Golden Globe, and then get a nomination got me interested.  I love Goldie Hawn, and Kate is a whole new version of her.  How great to have another Goldie(but make no mistake Kate is her own woman) around. So Friday I decided to rent it, and put off watchigni t until about ten P.M.  thinking I'd be bored and fall asleep.  Wow!  I had no idea.  I was hooked right from the begining.  Laughing outlouad as Frances McDormand hit the screen in a fabulous performance worthy of the nomination for Best Supt. Actress she got.  Not long after came Kate Hudson, making the character of Penny Lane her own right from the start.  Immediately I loved this character, and completely forgot she was Goldie Hawn's daughter.  She was sweet, loving, and probably the most loved character in the show.  The boy was great, and Billy Crudup was wow!  Where did he come from.  Yet, whenever Ms. Penny Lane wasn't on I was longing for her to show up, and so excited when she did.  She rocked throughout.  She showcased this great person, yet when she gets her heartbroken which almost ends in tragedy, I felt myself litterally praying for this character.  Cameron Crowe has created one of the best films ever.  As soon as this movie hits a more reasonalbe price, well, I'm adding it as fast as I can to the collection.  Furthermore, Kate has gained herself a new fan, and this is because of her acting skills and her exceptional performance, not because she is Goldie's daughter.  I truly believe Kate was robbed for Best. Suppt. Actress and was shouting at the screen.  She deserved so badly.  But then I thought, look at it this way, this is technically her fourth film in which she is a lead, and in only four films she gets that kind of recognition, and in only two years.  I have a big feeling that soon Kate will be back at the Academy Awards sooner rather than later, and I predict she'll walk away with one of those Oscars in the very near future, just like her Proud Mamma, who has every right to proud.",985564800,,2251,4.431707317073171

I swear i couldn't pick anyone better to play any of the characters. Of course there is my favorite actor, Jason Lee, who was born to be a rock star, (not a mallrat!) Patrick Fugit is just great for the character he plays, Billy Crudup is fantastic, and needless to say Kate Hudson is astonishing. I dare any guy not to fall in love with her after the scene where she and Fugit 'discuss' their ages. She's so alive throughout the whole movie, and is just...amazing. The ""Tiny Dancer"" scene is so good that it makes me cry. Finally it seems somebody (Cameron Crowe) realizes the power of rock and roll and how it can mend anything, no matter how big or small. I think Crowe and I would have been good friends if i had known him in highschool. Of course, the soundtrack is fantastic, i bought it right away.

Though the movie is centered around this boy, you see more of Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand.  Kate stars as the young and smart charater named Penny Layne.  The character is a band groupie, or as Penny Layne perfers, ""Band-Aid.""  Fances plays the boys mother who is worried about and knows of the way off following a band.  The characters bring most attention to themselves because you can laugh, cry and feel every emotion.  The characters they portray is shown in one light yet give a glimpse into what the ""real"" charater is about.  Not often do we find that the male Actor in a film is not the one who stands out but the women who support him.  The women in the film actually paved the way for it's success only because they allow you to see what these rock stars and boy would be like with or without them.  Though Oscars where given last night, and Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand lost Best Actress in a Supporting Role to Marcia Gay Harden (She portrays the role of Ed Pollock's wife in ""Pollock""), they both have a career gain.  McDormand who is no stranger to Oscar after winning Best Actress for her charater in Fargo really did not need this award, it simply added anpother notch to the belt.  Kate Hudson, who everyone thought was a sure in for the Oscar, did not need this award niether.  The nomination was perfect for the role she did.

We viewers can identify with these emotions as real and as close to our own lives minus the pompous images and other fake realities of movies.

1284902,5,B00003CXMG,"Writer/Director Cameron Crowe (""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", ""Jerry Maguire"") has a knack for capturing the human condition in all its imperfect glory.  He is particularly insightful when he is writing from his own experiences.  To write ""Fast Times"", he went undercover at a high school posing as a student.  The result was an honest and genuine high school flick that was too real to be fiction.  He does the same with this film, drawing on his experience as a writer for Rolling Stone Magazine when he toured with Led Zeppelin at age 16.  Though the band and the most of the people in this film are fictitious, many of the situations are based on real events and the characters are composites of real people.
Some people have compared this film to ""This is Spinal Tap"", but other than the fact that it follows a rock group, there is little similarity.  ""Tap"" was a spoof documentary with its tongue firmly in cheek.  AF is raw and real with a believable plot (except perhaps the silly airplane confession scene) and affecting characters.  Crowe went to great lengths to capture the rock scene precisely, sending the actors to band camp to get them to the point where they could actually perform.  Stillwater is literally a rock band created out of actors.  While some of the vocals are dubbed, Jason Lee really sings lead on a couple of tracks, and Billy Crudup and the band are actually playing.  Crowe was quoted as saying it was a pity that the band had to break up after the film was produced, because they were actually a pretty good band.  Nancy Wilson and Peter Frampton wrote most of the band's original music to give the songs an authentic sound.
Crowe's direction is excellent.  Though the pacing of the film is a bit uneven, dragging at times, his ability to depict the feelings of the time through the performances of the actors is superb.  The sound track is rich in 1970's music that is enhanced by the use of the DTS format on the DVD.  The DVD also has numerous fascinating behind-the-scenes segments, including a copy of the original articles written by Crowe when he wrote for Rolling Stone Magazine.
The acting by the ensemble cast is outstanding.  In keeping with the theme of the film, most of the actors are bright young talents who are almost famous.  Billy Crudup is the closest thing to a leading role actor, having starred in a few good but minor films (""Without Limits"", ""Waking the Dead"").  Crudup's performance as the self-absorbed and brilliant guitarist who holds the band together is first rate.  Frances McDormand is fabulous as always as William's oppressive mother.
In a cast replete with fine performances, Kate Hudson stands out, giving a brilliant presentation of Penny Lane.  She brings enormous emotional power to a very demanding role that ranges from effervescent to suicidal.  Newcomer Patrick Fugit finds the right balance between nerdy and wise as William.  Jason Lee is wonderfully turbulent as the temperamental lead singer.
This film is a winner.  By capturing the emotions rather than just a series of rock events, it takes us behind the scenes of the rock revolution in a way that no documentary ever has.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is necessary viewing for rock fans young and old.",985478400,,3234,4.742397137745975
1284981,4,B00003CXMG,"Few writer/directors working today can match Cameron Crowe's consistently beautiful work. He continues his his winning streak with Almost Famous. The fictitious rock band Stillwater and the assorted Band-aids (NOT GROUPIES!!), managers, roadies, and other hangers on that surround them are the focus of 15 year old William Miller's first assignment for Rolling Stone magazine. William is the stand in for Crowe himself who lived most of what you see onscreen when he worked as rock journalist in the 70's. Almost Famous cotinues the Crowe tradition of laugh out loud comedy combined with sentimentality, and heart rendering drama. Far be it from me to jump on the Kate Hudson bandwagon, but she absolutely deserves an oscar for her supporting role as the lead band-aid Penny Lane. She captures the screen everytime she is on. She will break your heart and make you love her character. Patrick Fugit plays William. Why he got so little attention for his finely shaded performance is beyond me. The rest of the cast includes Frances McDormand , Billy Crudup, and Jason Lee among others. They all deliver fine performances, even Lee whom I have always found a bit stiff. I highly recommend at least a rental of Almost Famous, but do yourself a favor and buy it. If only so you can watch the Tiny Dancer sing a long over and over.",985478400,3,1326,4.845814977973569

You simply won't find better acting in any film this year.  Frances McDormand as the somewhat flaky and over-protective, yet absolutely loving mother of aspiring rock-journalist William (Patrick Fugit) absolutely nails her character.  A character who could so easily have turned into a two-dimensional, over-the-top cut-out in her hands becomes a quirky, yet sympathetic and lovable individual.  And Fugit's portrayal of William was so honest and believable that you truly forget you're watching a movie; instead, for a couple hours, you inhabit the 70s with him.
Kate Hudson is perfect as the tough-yet-naive groupie William is destined to fall for.  She is a marvel to watch, and imbues her character with warmth, humor, a touch of tragedy, and ultimately, an indominable spirit.  And fortunately for us all, the rest of the cast is just as good.  You'll find yourself transported back in time and riding with the band -- and it's a great ride.

Let me start by marveling at the plethora of negative reviews here. Even the critics that didn't name it to their Top 10 list didn't dislike the movie. You will be hard pressed to find a single negative professional review anywhere on this movie. Please disregard the short, ignorant reviews here that do no more than call the movie names. This movie is all you could ask for and then some.
The story is old news by now. Everybody knows it is based on CC's real life experiences as a teenage scribe covering the rock scene for Rolling Stone magazine. Unlike many movies based on a true story, many of the pivotal scenes in this movie actually took place. Very few artistic liberties were taken with regards to key events.
The acting was virtually flawless. Phillip Seymour Hoffman would have won an Oscar if there was an awards given for cameos. His role was too small to be considered for best supporting actor, but it was the best performance I have seen in a long time. McDormand and Hudson both earned their nominations. Kate Hudson's range was astonishing, especially in the ""$50/Case of Beer"" scene. Jason Lee was born to play the part of Jeff Bebe, and Jimmy Fallon was surprisingly strong as a sleazy agent. The movies focal points were Billy Crudup as Russel Hammond, a self-centered guitarist with several intricate layers to his makeup. Crudup played the part perfectly and deserved official recognition for his work. Patrick Fugit, playing William Miller/CC was excellent in his debut. Like Hudson, his expressions were worth a million words. Even Zooey Deschanel was fabulous in her short scenes as William's influential older sister. I expect to see a lot more of her in the coming years.
Several scenes stand out, and the soundtrack was wisely chosen. Anyone that remembers albums had to appreciate the way a wide-eyed William gazed at all those covers with amazement for the first time. The late night conversation between Hoffman and Bangs near the end was heartbreaking and warm and brialliant and funny all wrapped up into one. The movie is full of nostalgia, but not so much that it becomes provincial and self-indulgent.
The Academy snubbed this movie for the likes of Gladiator, Erin Brockovich, and Chocolat. Never before has that disconnected gang of oafs committed such a crime. Buy this movie and treasure it, because art like this doesn't come around very often.",985305600,95,2593,4.803131991051454

Kate Hudson is extraordinary as groupie Penny Lane,sensitive yet all knowing. Frances McDormand plays William's off-beat, eccentric, yet loving mother with her usual zeal.
This film is a great reminder for all us kids who grew up on 70s rock.""Stillwater"", the fictitious band dramatized in the film, is a perfect amalgamation of Zeppelin, with touches of other 70s greats (Foghat?) thrown in.

His was probably the worst performance by a leading man in recent memory and ultimately lets the film down,and as for the overrated Kate Hudson,an oscar nod for staring into space half the time,it seemed to me that she was just reciting lines from a script and not acting at all. Thank God for Frances McDormand for giving it a touch of class.

Period pieces can be a gamble, they're usually inaccurate, or overly goofy, but this movie was very well done.  Billy Crudup does a killer job of playing a messed-up rock star.  He probably won't win any awards for it (the best ones never do), but he is definitely deserving of it.  Patrick Fugit is a likeable young actor, and Kate Hudson is extremely talented (not to mention very beutiful).  The story, basically, is of a young writer in the early 70's who goes on tour with a nascent rock band to interview them for a magazine article, during which he befriends the band members, and finds love with a mysterious female follower.  I found the story to be particularly enthralling, due to my love for music, and for the fact that I myself love to write, so it was easy for me to put myself into the place of the main character, and see the story through his eyes.  I also enjoyed the gritty depiction of the life of a rock star, it's important that people remember that it's not all glitz and glam.  The world has changed in the past thirty years, but this story could easily occur much the same way in the here and now.  I cannot recommend this movie enough.  It will surely stay in your mind for days after you have watched it.  Also, there are tons of great songs in this movie, many of which can be found on the soundtrack.  There's even a song by Stillwater, the fictitous band from the movie.  I know these guys are actors, not musicians, but they rock!  The part where they are singing ""Tiny Dancer"" on the bus is really cool, too, I'm guessing it symbolizes something, but I haven't figured out what yet.  It had to have some meaning.

Patrick Fugit delivers an astounding performance (made more so by the fact that he's a newcomer to major motion pictures), conveying a blend of naivete and enthusiasm that makes his character utterly believable.

I'll address the latter group in a second; let me fill those unfamiliar with the film in first. ""Almost Famous"" was one of my favorites from last year, and after having viewed the DVD it was nice to know it lives up to repeated viewings. The story revolves around a young 15 year-old rock and roll magazine critic who gets his first really big assignment: to write an article on an up and coming band named Stillwater for Rolling Stone magazine. The film follows his travels with the band while on tour across the U.S. The film itself is autobiographical in nature: director Cameron Crowe was himself a journalist in the 70s. The film has a few brief concert sequences of the band on stage, but these are secondary to the behind the scenes look at the band and how life on the road changes those involved. If you like films about teens coming of age or just a film that is a well-written balance of laughs and poignancy then this is one you'll enjoy. If you're looking for a gag-filled comedy ala ""Meet the Parents"" then look elsewhere. This one is character driven and intelligent. I also have to make a special mention of the soundtrack (being a huge music buff): the songs included in the film are a great mix of popular stuff and lesser-known tracks. Unlike many of today's soundtracks, which are created solely as a commercial buy product, the CD is actually a decent ""mix tape"" of songs from the 70s. For those who have seen the film, this DVD is lacking in extras: there are no deleted scenes (as it was believed to contain-see the other review about a forthcoming longer version) and for some strange reason the opening credits have a different widescreen ratio than the rest of the film. The 'making of' featurette is one of those that rehashes the film with scenes from it interspersed with interview clips with those involved (basically an advertisement for the film).

During this trip, William becomes more mature and aware of what happens on rock shows backstages, which represents a new world to him. Doing his job, he mets some ""groupie"" girls, who belong to music bands universe and make this film even better.
The soundtrack is great and the characters have complex plots. The cast was very well chosen, and the best performers in scene are Kate Hudson, as the crazy groupie ""penny lane"", and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who has a small part, but does it extremely well, as always.
Frances McDormand is also great as William's repressive mother. Most part of the film she is worried with her son, and the influence sex, drugs and rock'n roll may cause in his teenage life.
This movie has memorable moments, such as the dialogs between ""penny lane"" and william, and the airplane scene, when the stillwater, the groupies and even william start confessing their sins. I also enjoyed the ""groupies girls"". Actually I know a few girls like that, which follow some local bands in my country and behave the same way as the characters of this film. Really unbelievable nowadays! I will never understand what makes these girls so devoted to group members and why they need to follow them and enjoy the sucess they do not deserve. It's kind of depressing, if you consider they have very low self steem, getting envolved with everybody in the bands.
This DVD also brings HBO Behind the scenes, which I really recommend.

All the while, his mother (Oscar winner Frances McDormand) sits at home, her over-protective instincts running wild. What transpires through the film is beautiful coming-of-age tale with humor and wit to burn. I'm a bit hesitant to reveal many plot details about the film. It's something you're better off not knowing much about. Experiencing the maturing of William and the painful realizations of fame that the band goes through during the tour is half the fun of the movie. You will get to know each character through-out the film. They will become your friends, your heroes, and you will cheer them on and weep for them. Such is the brilliant simplicity of Cameron Crowe who, as both writer and director, has fictionalized a portion of his own life to share with us. And I for one am grateful. It's rare that a movie has the power to effects it's audience in a way this film does. Much like William, we are newcomers to the world he experiences. William's slow realization that these guys in Stillwater might be larger then life when they are on stage, but when they are not, they are just as vulnerable as we are and just as human, is pure magic. The members of the band include Billy Crudup as the charismatic guitarist whose good looks cast him in the limelight, Jason Lee as the lead singer whose desire for attention creates tension through-out the group, and real-life musicians Mark Kozelek and John Fedevich. Their music was written by Crowe's wife Nancy Wilson of the group 'Heart' and was actually performed by the actors themselves. And they are quite good, both musically and performance wise. Lee continues to show his versatility and Crudup delivers his second great performance of 2000, the other in the wonderfully skewed 'Jesus's Son'. The rest of the cast sparkles as well with McDormand and Fugit convincingly playing mother and son, one desperate to stay close while the other begs for a little room to grow. But the film belongs to Kate Hudson, whose grace and tenderness leap from the screen, and to Philip Seymour Hoffman as the wise and cynical rock critic Lester Bangs, stealing every scene his is in. And to Cameron Crowe, who continues to turn everything he touches into pure gold. This is the best film of 2000 and one you cannot afford to miss.",984614400,,3013,4.695652173913044
1285196,2,B00003CXMG,"Time now for my review of Almost Famous.  While the ex-hippies might be enjoying this boring movie if you're looking for a fun movie to watch you might try something else. What's ridiculous about this is that the critics gave the movie a good review and I watched it because of that. But the movie is a lot of feel-good nonsense in the tradition of the 70's. Just goes to show you that you have to make up your own mind on these things.

1285267,4,B00003CXMG,"Myself, like many others, counted down the days until March 13th arrived.  Cameron Crowes ""Almost Famous"" has reassured me that this talanted director creates films unlike all others.  There is always SOMETHING unique about every movie this man has been a part of.  With Almost Famous, I had a constant 2-hour smile on my face, at the same time remembering a bunch of adolescent memories like my first girlfriend, my first kiss, the first time I got to experience real freedom away from home.  And I am sure I'm not alone here, because what made this film so wonderful is that it has provoked similar memories in those that saw this wonderful film.  OK, let's talk about this DVD.  As soon as I received mine, I immediately looked on the back for the 'extra features.'  Let me make this clear before I start my review, there is NO COMMENTARY and there is NO 30 MINUTES OF EXTRA FOOTAGE.  From what I hear, Cameron Crowe was too busy working on his next film to spend time on this DVD release.  So, I'm expecting a FUTURE release of this film with all those extras many of us were hoping for.  However, I DO recommend getting this DVD in its current state, because simply, it's just a GREAT film!  OK...NOW back to the DVD.  I opened the case up and was introduced to an attractive looking DVD with a picture of the cast on the DVD.  The pamphlet inside is nothing special.  It has 3 behind-the-scenes photos and a little background on the making of the film.  It also has chapter listings.  I popped the DVD into my player and was pleasantly surprised by the menu design, very easy navigation with eye popping moving menus and colors, all displayed with the background music of Stillwater.  The 'main menu' has a choice of 'special features', 'scene index',  'audio options' and 'subtitles'.  Under 'special features', you have the choice of watching an HBO special on the making of Almost Famous, the theatrical trailer and the ""Fever Dog"" music video.  You can also view production notes, cast and crew biographies and Rolling Stone articles written by the director.  The ""Making Of"" special is a nice look into the film, with interviews by many cast members.  Nothing we haven't seen before, but still nice to have.  The ""Fever Dog"" video is pretty bad.  Yes, it contains a few cuts not seen in the film, but 3/4 of it seems out of sync.  (I'm an editor, I notice stuff like this).  The whole video resembled an old 'Godzilla' TV show after a while....oh well.  The 'scene index' is wonderful.  It has a title for each scene and moving menus which create a very attractive screen.  You have 3 'audio options'.  DTS Digital Surround, 5.1 Dolby Digital and 2.0 Dolby Digital.  You also have a choice of having English 'subtitles' on or off.  My favorite 'special feature' were the articles written by Cameron Crowe.  Reading these articles makes you realize what a terrific writer Cameron Crowe is, and how much of a pleasure it must be to read his scripts.  OK....now to the technical stuff about the movie. I was very VERY impressed with this beautiful anamorphic widescreen transfer.  The cinematography in this film is wonderful.  Colors are beautifully rendered, blacks are rich and the concert footage is gorgeous.  No complaints about picture quality, it is excellent.  The audio is also wonderful.  Although the dialogue is pretty much center channeled, the movie sounds far from monaural.  Ambience sounds are surrounding and the music is outstanding.  If you watch this on a surround system, the concert footage will envelope your ears and bring you right into the show.  I was even impressed with the audio on a 2 speaker system.  Your subwoofer will kick in during the concert footage, other then that, this film is not one to test your system out.  Having the dialogue strictly centered makes the concert footage EXPLODE!  The sound design is terrific, clean, clear and beautifully recorded.  (Yes, I found myself singing Tiny Dancer.....again!)  In conclusion, Almost Famous is one of my favorite films from the past few years.  It's full of emotion and PERFECTLY casted with wonderful performance from all involved.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this DVD.  I give the film 5 stars, but the DVD loses a star for lacking the footage we were all hoping for.  Go get this DVD if you want to smile  for 2 hours straight.  You'll find that you can't help but relive those early-teen memories while watching this film.  If you ARE a teen, trust me, you'll still enjoy this movie.  If you are of the older generation, who knows......I think you may love this film!  You'll laugh, cry and go through all the emotions a Cameron Crowe movie brings out of us.  Enjoy Almost Famous....and oh yeah....""Don't do drugs!""",984614400,8,4710,4.731527093596059
1285268,5,B00003CXMG,"This movie could almost have been my story. Like William Miller, the 15 year old lead character in Almost Famous, I too found myself immersed in the backstage world of the 70's concert scene. Unlike young Miller or Cameron Crowe (who the character was pretty much based on), I wasn't a writer, I sold vintage guitars to all the touring bands that hit Houston starting in 1974 but I too was only 15 and was basically the same wide-eyed kid. I remember `your name's not on the list' and being in love with a `band-aid' or two that only had eyes for the band members. This movie captures exactly the way it felt back then: the musicians, the road crews, the music, the girls, everything. I ended up being a guitar tech, then a road manager and finally a manager before I left the business a couple of years ago at age 40. Ironically for me, (you'll understand why after you've seen the movie) I was the tour manager for Steve Marriott's, Humble Pie from 1982 to 1985 but I don't think I ever won a girl in a poker game like Reg.
There were a lot of little details that made it very real for me. There's a shot of the band's tour manager when he introduces the band. After he finishes, the camera lingers on him for a bit and you get a feel for the amount of pressure this guy is under. This particular character wasn't really fleshed out that much in the movie so I was surprised to see this particular shot but I'm glad it didn't get cut.
The DVD quality is excellent on this one and bonuses include a `Making of' feature, original trailer, production notes and cast and crew details. The DVD also includes several full-length Rolling Stone articles written by Cameron Crowe in the `70's. About the only thing missing was a deleted scenes section.
Comedies like Still Crazy and Spinal Tap do a great job of lampooning this eras rock bands while still paying a sort of tribute and both are excellent movies but this movie falls into a category of its own. It took me back to what it was like in the very beginning when I first fell in love with rock and roll. Thanks for the trip down memory lane, Cameron.",984614400,9,2103,4.353689567430026
1285269,5,B00003CXMG,"I had high hopes for this movie.  I didn't catch it in theatres, but I work in a video store and have been counting down for the past month until the day I could finally rent it.  After what seemed like a lifetime of waiting, I finally watched the movie.  I was blown away and despite the high hopes I had held my expectations were surpassed by a supreme margin.  The acting was perfect, flawless.  Each character was matched with an actor who captured the spirit to a 'T'.  Jason Lee is in his best role ever, despite it being a seemingly small part.  Billy Crudup is now in the running for my personal list of best actors.  And of course, it was great to see the lovely Fairuza Balk return in another simply dazzling film.  Even with the perfect cast a movie could still do badly, but Cameron Crowe added a beautiful script, and lastly, an extremely well done soundtrack that epitomizes the feeling of the movie.  It even includes ""Fever Dog"" by Stillwater.  The story was too great for words.  I hoped that it would not end. I was too caught up in the story, and I wanted to find out the rest of the epic.  What happened to Stillwater?  Where does William go from there?  And Penny?  But even with questions, I was left feeling like everything was perfect in the world, longing to have grown up in such a lovely time where bands had long hair and self indulgent guitar solos, and people actually yelled ""Does anybody remember laughter?""",984528000,2,1439,4.414448669201521

1285271,5,B00003CXMG,"This is a great movie, one of the best.  But this DVD does not include 30-minutes of extra footage, or any kind of directors cut.  It is the same as the theatrical version.  The extras are o.k., but nothing special (not even an audio commentary).",984528000,4,246,4.4222222222222225
1285272,3,B00003CXMG,"Don't get me wrong; I love this movie.  I thought it was the best film of 2000.  ...  The cut seems identical to what I saw in the theater, and there are no deleted scenes included.  The only important extras are a music video, a behind-the-scenes making-of special, and Crowe's original RS articles.  Also, this is a 1.85:1 transer, not a 2.35:1 transfer as some sources claim.  So there you go.",984528000,,396,4.507042253521127
1285273,3,B00003CXMG,"I didn't get a chance to see Almost Famous in the theaters, so when it came out on DVD, I immediately rented it.  The story is fun and there are some fine performances by Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Jason Lee and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  However, I thought the characters played by Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand were extremely annoying and definitely not worthy of the Oscar nominations they have received for their performances.  I think Cameron Crowe must be friends with Goldie Hawn and agreed to get closeup after closeup of her little girl Kate so that she can become a star based on her beauty.  But she doesn't do much for the film in my opinion (the same goes for former Oscar winner Anna Paquin, who plays one of Kate's fellow ""band-aids"").
I also thought that since the character played by Fugit (Billy Miller) is essentially Cameron Crowe himself, he pretty much has portrayed himself as a perfect child with few faults.  I find it a little hard to believe.
Overall, it was a good movie, especially if you enjoy the great music that is part of the soundtrack.  But, it isn't ""classic"" material.",984528000,2,1111,4.671794871794872
1285274,3,B00003CXMG,"First off, Almost Famous looks and sounds just as good it as it does in my memory of seeing it way back in August. It still holds up really well and stands out as being one of the best films to be released this unsteady year. Also, the inclusion of several Rolling Stones articles written by Cameron Crowe are available for reading or browsing in full, which provides some nice background and kinda lets you piece together what bands are being cobbled together in the story of the fictional ""Stillwater.""
The problem is, the DVD is advertised to have 30 minutes of deleted scenes, while the DVD itself doesn't mention the 30 minutes and doesn't have any additional footage, unless behind the scenes footage and clips from the trailer count.
Crowe has been interviewed about the disc and says that he will be putting together the original 4 hour cut of the film, entitled ""Untitled."" So, if you're getting the disc for the deleted scenes, which is my main motivation, hold on, because there will be a monster definitive cut that will far exceed anyone's expectations.
but, if you can't wait, there's enough greatness in the film to merit buying it and enough interesting tidbits in the supplemental stuff to warrant it. But if you're a completist and have to have the Criterionesque bells and whistles version, this will only let you down.",984441600,20,1338,4.746781115879829
1285275,5,B00003CXMG,"I viewed the film today for the first time and oh my I must say that this has to be one of the greatest films of last year and truly one of the best of all time. Cameron Crowe is really a genuis, the writing in this film is just phenomenal. I'm young and I must say I am now in awe of all music that came out of the late 60's early 70's. I plan on getting the soundtrak to this film.
On to the film. Patrick Fugit is an incredible actor, he has such heart in this film especially when speaking with Penny Lane about how Russell really cares about her. Then Kate Hudson's performance in this film, can be described in one word; AMAZING! I have not seen such great acting for someone as young as Kate in a long time. You really forget that you are watching Kate Hudson on the screen and you think you are watching Penny Lane, and that is what great acting is all about and very few films and actors have the ability to do that anymore. But Kate can! As well as Patrick Fugit. While I was watching this movie, I didn't like of it as a movie, you completely forget while watching it, because the acting is so top notch. Frances McDormand as William Miller's over protective Mom is so great, I love how Cameron Crowe described her ""You could have a whole movie just based on my Mom"" And really you can. Frances gives one of the best performances of the movie, behind Kate and Patrick, who just hold the whole movie together. Patrick is the innocense and Kate is the heart. If Kate Hudson is not awarded the Best Supporting Actress Oscar this year, I have lost all hope in HollyWood!
Billy Crudup who plays rock star Russell is also great, but he has this stigma about him, that just says JERK! Also the fact that he treats Penny Lane like a toy makes you want to hate him even more. Penny is in love with the music, she is there as a fan who is in awe of the music along with her other bandaids. And the fact that Russell and his other bandmates always say it is for the fans, Russell fails to see that Penny is their biggest fan and he treats her as though she is just a peice of trash. But then Russell also has a quality about him, saying please just like me. So I give him credit.
The other members are not featured much, but play a prominent role in some scenes.
This is really a movie about the love of music, finding your true self and just having a helluva time expeirencing and meeting new people. I encourage everyone to see this film and I promise you that will not regret it. Even if you hate Kate Hudson you will appreciate her just for giving you the pleasure of seeing her perofrmance. Also if there is nothing you find you like about this film, there will always be the music!",984441600,,2687,4.159309021113244
1285363,4,B00003CXMG,"It's almost unfair when Cameron Crowe simply shoots album covers from thirty years ago, and you suddenly are reminded how important the music was, and how much fun those days were.  In other words, a nostalgia flick, but a very charming one.  I know there's been much criticism of the lack of horror displayed dealing with drugs and free sex/groupies, but let that be somebody else's movie.  This is a warm, fuzzy memory to dream on.",984441600,4,433,4.671052631578948

1285365,5,B00003CXMG,"When I was fifteen years old, I had a subscription to Rolling Stone magazine, and every notebook and backpack I owned bore the logo of Led Zeppelin and The Who.  Which is probably why ""Almost Famous"" didn't resonant completely with me the first time I saw it.  I wanted to fall in love with fictional band Stillwater just as I had Zep.  But I didn't.  On seeing the film a second time, it's not that surprising.  By the its own admission, Stillwater is an average band making good on charisma and hard work and a touch of luck.  But the music is merely a canvas.  The passions of the individuals involved are the paint that makes this movie a great piece of art.  The boys in the band are passionate about the music.  The groupies (excuse me, ""Band-Aids"") are passionate about the music, and the bands who make it.  The 15-year old rock journalist (and Cameron Crowe double) is passionate about the music and what it takes to write about it.  His mom is passionate about her beliefs and instilling them in her kids.  And everyone is passionate about finding something real to latch on to, to make them, in the end, ""people of substance"".
And director Crowe is passionate about telling this autobiographical tale with energy and sincerity and dignity, but also about keeping it true, exposing the warts and all.  He does so.  Magnificently.  It lives up its pedigree, being superbly written, honestly acted, and insightful to such a degree that it exposes bone.
""The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when you're uncool,"" says Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) at one point.  It is my favourite line in a script that, even though it lacks a ""Show me the money"" moment (""I am a golden god,"" pales in comparison), speaks deeply on a lot of personal issues in a pristine and economical way.  A story that on first glance I found meandering and pointless, I appreciate now precisely because it is meandering and pointless.  We follow a rock band on tour.  What could be more meandering and pointless than that?  On the other hand, when one sheds the veneer of cynicism that adulthood saddles us with, we have to realize that there is nothing more beautiful.  To the people living it, it is Bohemia and Valhalla rolled into one.  Beautiful life and beautiful death.  Crowe's script lets these weighty concepts hang in the air, available for the passionate viewer to latch on to, and come along for the ride.
The acting ensemble is led by four (and a half) wonderful performances.  Patrick Fugit, in his first major role, is asked to carry the bulk of the film's innocence.  And he does so with aplomb.  It is an assured and strong performance.  Kate Hudson deserves all the accolades she has received.  However, on my first viewing, I had a tough time appreciating her work, because I was busy falling in love with her.  But now I see that she gets things right most of the time, showing she is able to simultaneously play the spirited sprite and the broken old soul.  I also suspect that she must have given the cinematographer fits, because she seems to be composed solely of a warm, bright light.  She glows.  Frances McDormand, on the other hand, plays the dowdy and domineering mom.  The revelation here is that she manages to enliven her with an odd kind of cool.  I adore everything she does here (and in her other movies), and whatever capacity for crushes I had leftover after my run-in with Ms. Hudson, I gave wholeheartedly to Miss McDormand.  Billy Crudup, as Stillwater's mysterious guitarist, didn't have me convinced the first time around.  But on the second pass, I realize that his is the best performance in the movie.  There's a moment near the end that clinched this realization for me.  He realizes he's been duped, and shows his appreciation for the person who got the better of him with a sheepish grin.  It's the capper in a series of subtle suggestive glances that line his flawless performance.  (N.B. The ""half"" performance noted above belongs to Phil Hoffman, who, in what amounts to an extended cameo, proves once again that he is incapalbe of giving an unrealistic performance)
As for the film's insight, well, I'll leave that for you to discover.  Needless to say it will be more beautiful that way.  I know, I know, this all sounds like mindless hippie drivel, but when I encounter a Cameron Crowe film, I find it very easy to wear my heart on my sleeve.  With pride.  And passion.",984268800,16,4456,4.643222506393862

William quickly makes friends with a ""band-aide"" Penny Lane (Kate Hudson in a star making, Oscar nominated role), who will introduce him to the fast paced world of rock stars.  Guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup in a perfomance that definitely deserved an Oscar nomination),  is the first to take a liking to William, and the two will form a bond that is held together by Penny.
While traveling with the band, city after city, William is no closer to the angle of his story, but with the help of legendary writer Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), he may come up with the story of a lifetime, and learn some important lesson's on life.
""Almost Famous"" is the best movie of the year, it is PACKED with superb performances; Kate Hudson is so good that you can't take your eyes off her.  Billy Crudup is nothing less than spectacular in a role that proves he is one of the most talented actors working today.  Newcomer Patrick Fugit lights up the screen in the lead role of William (based on writer/director Cameron crowe).  Frances McDormand, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Lee, Fairuza Balk, and Anna Paquin are top-notch in supporting roles.  Look for 70's rock star Peter Frampton in a small role.

The Beatles are no longer speaking, the Rolling Stones are making the first of their many bad albums, Hendrix and Morrison have kicked the can and Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and The Who are almost over.  The dust is settling and a decade of great music is quickly fading.
""Almost Famous"" is equally about the love of music as about the story of a band.  The characters and plot are well crafted and it's even more interesting to watch because it's Crowe's autobiography.  Anyone who has a deep love of music will probably enjoy this movie, especially the many references to (what I consider to be) good music (""Pet Sounds"", ""Raw Power"", ""White Light/White Heat"", etc).

I recall having a smile from ear to ear when watching that moment, and I cannot wait to see it again.  The film, taken from director Cameron Crowe's own experience as a teen journalist for Rolling Stone, centers around the day to day events on the road of a fictitious(?)rock band called Stillwater as seen through eyes of a budding 15 year old writer.  Almost Famous documents, in hearwarming detail, the crazy, almost surreal, aspects of the rock and roll lifestyle in the early 70's.  The parties.  The drugs.  The egos.  What I found most interesting was how the movie explored the relationship between journalist and celebrity and how one feeds off of and uses the other and vice versa.  Crowe, however, is too good of a writer/director to let his film fall into cynicism which it never does.  The performance are all excellent but the standouts are Philip Seymour Hoffman as rock critic Lester Banks and the beautiful Kate Hudson as a groupie named Penny Lane.  The fact that this movie did not get nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars proves, again, that the truly great films are all beyond reach.",983145600,,1344,4.7296137339055795

I had seen the strange poster of the blond girl with the huge mirrored sunglasses in the lobby (heck, I had put it up), and then, I saw the film!  What can I say?  The critics were right: it deserved all the praise and critical acclaim it received!
  Patrick Fugit plays William Miller, a young boy living with his mother(Francis McDormand).  Listening to Rock and Roll, Young William soon begins to write review for an underground newspaper.  One day, his work catches the eye of Rolling Stone magazine, and he is sent to go along with the up-and-coming band ""Stillwater.""  At the first concert he attends, Will meets several band-aids(young women who are there to support the certain band), including the mysterious Penny Lane(Kate Hudson).  Before he knows it, Will is whisked all over the country, and becomes close confidant to lead Stillwater player Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup).
  The film plays well on several levels, and on it's humor.  At the beginning, Will is unsure how to go about his duties to report Stillwater's happenings, and his questions to Penny Lane create some incredible enigmas for us(what is her real name?).  Some of the best comical moments involve the constant call by Will's mom to make sure he's staying out of trouble and not doing drugs (my mom would have probably done the same thing), and one scene in Nebraska where Russell goes to a nearby party and gets wasted.
  Based loosely on an early life experience by Cameron Crowe, he takes us on this journey, and wew get to experience much of it from Will's point of view, rather than just viewing it like an outsider.  The story has many twists and turns, and probably not since ""Forrest Gump"" had I seen a piece reflect the period it was contained in so well.  It's movies like this that make me yearn for the era of retro-style (there was one lamp in the movie that my parents had in the late 70's).",982713600,8,2004,4.631728045325779
1285372,5,B00003CXMG,"After watching the Oscar nomination announcements today, I was extremely pleased to see this movie so well-represented among the mix of an otherwise weak year in movies. This movie really stands out as one of the better films to show this year, even though not many people saw it.
When I watched it this fall, I was shocked that so few people were at the theaters. After the movie was over, my girlfriend and I seriously considered seeing it again. The coming-of-age story is hardly new, but young Cameron Crowe's adventures were told in a delightful and unique way. Although the budding journalist entered into a world of sex, drugs and rock-n-roll, the corruption did not overcome him.
And that's a good point the movie makes - rock-n-roll isn't evil (OK, some bands are, but that's your fault for listening). Music is a driving force in many people's lives: It captures all of the emotion, love and heartache of the human spirit. Crowe made a great movie that shows us just that, and the soundtrack ain't to shabby, either. For those of you who missed this gem in the theaters, this is your chance to see one of the best movies of 2000.",982022400,14,1139,4.615763546798029
1285442,5,B00003CXMG,"It is surprising that a movie that takes place in the unreal world of the rock and roll circus is much more grounded in reality than most movies.  This film stubbornly resists the clichs and sentimentality that in lesser hands would have sunk it.  It concerns William, an endearing 15 year-old who is mature but nave and tags along with a rock band in order to write a profile of them for Rolling Stone.  The band's leader, Russell, is worldly but immature -- just the opposite of William.  Both have to enter the other's world, both physically and emotionally, to become complete.  Fluttering between them is Penny Lane, the groupie who is about William's age but can't see his love for her because of her infatuation with Russell, who is easily twice her age and who uses her as a plaything.  It reminds me a bit of the love story in Forrest Gump, where the woman goes for a series of manipulative men who embody the Zeitgeist of the kooky `70s while she ignores the simple and true love that is hers for the asking.  Almost Famous captures the crazy feeling of a rock band on tour and the strained dynamics that can almost break up a band.  Despite the debauched background of a mid-70s rock and roll tour, this is a sweet film that is by turns funny and touching.  Don't miss it.",981676800,,1283,4.448717948717949

And that part on the bus where they all sing along?  Can a filmmaker be any more manipulative?  Cameron Crowe is like a little puppy dog that pants at your feet ""Do you like me?  Huh?  Do ya?"".  No doubt his experiences on the road could have made for some interesting story-telling.  Jerry Maguire was a better film by trusting the material and the actors and telling the story first and foremost.  But Almost Famous does what it shouldn't do: It tries to be moving first and foremost.  Cameron Crowe should be forced to sit down in a dark screening room and study Boogie Nights and Magnolia, since that's obviously the type of movie he's trying to make, and with this effort, failing miserably.

If I hear, ""You had me at hello,"" again, I'll scream) did not overdo it here.  Crowe tells his story--pours his heart out on film, and does it with respect to his then profession--Journalism--and the rock scene of that time. Here, he takes the rock immortals and make them mortal and flawed. He kindly views the groupies--band-aids--as girls attached body and soul to musicians and their art and not as sexual intruments.  Each scene is emotional, but we're too captivated by all that we witness that we too surrender to it. In the end, it feels as if we went through a journey of profound wonder that just like the main character, we see the world as it really is--human. Rock stars--human. Groupies--human.  I hope you see this film and love it as I loved it.  This is truely a journey worth taking.",980380800,7,1154,4.528846153846154
1285447,5,B00003CXMG,"Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous,"" isn't a movie about fancy camera work or tricky lighting schemes.  Instead, the film creates something so much more extraordinary by remembering what it means to be a teenager, what it means to be on the cusp of fame, and what it means to fall in love.  These are only three of the many themes that the movie takes time to delicately address in the most subtly moving 2 hours you'll ever spend at the theater.  The performances are great.  Billy Crudup's lead guitarist Russell Hammond is overly self-confident on the outside, inside he's just as much of a kid searching for himself as Patrick Fugit's William Miller is. Fugit's so good you almost forget he's even there until you realize that he's the one you've been identifying with.  And then Kate Hudson's Penny Lane who is the soul of the film, holding together the era of Rock and Roll in between The magic of the 60s and the excess of the 80s.  She calls herself a band aid, and that's exactly what she is.  After an unnerved Fugit utters that he has to go home as they travel on the old bus to the next show she simply smiles, waving her hands in front of him and assuring him that he is home.  Tiny Dancer by Elton John plays in the background and even though it's Elton John, for some reason you feel at home when the song plays, feel optimistic even though you don't know where you're going.  That's just like the movie, not knowing what direction it's going in, just following it's instincts.  ""Almost Famous"" isn't about controversy or death or even the meaning of life it's just a movie about people.  It used to be an art form to create characters that seemed so real, and that the visual effects or the interesting camera angles meant nothing if not for the characters.  Here they feel real and they act real for once not seeming like they understand the plot as well as we do.  We see their public moments and their intimate moments and both seem to be just right.  It's nice to have characters to care about again.  The movie is magical without realizing it, incredibily perceptive without preaching and when you watch it something just makes you feel like you are home.",980380800,,2172,4.505102040816326

 It makes me remember the fact that music seems to be there for a reason, and it is to tie sounds to your memories, to times during your life, and that is priceless.

1285449,5,B00003CXMG,"""Almost Famous"" was one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year.  When the trailers started to play, everybody was talking about how badly they wanted to see it.  And then it came out and nobody went.  Talk about a real shame.  ""Almost Famous"" is one of the most satisfying films of the year.  2000 was a year of overstuffed and overhyped films.  ""Almost Famous"" is one of the few that didn't dissappoint.
It's been criticized of having an ending that is ""too optimistic"" for a movie about the Seventies.  Afterall, that decade didn't end all too well.  But what these critics don't realize is that ""Almost Famous"" is a piece of nostalgia; a dedication to a period in history that filmmaker Cameron Crowe remembers with great emotions.  He loved everything about the seventies, especially the music and the fact that he got to grow up in that decade.
This labor of love has it all: great performances, great dialogue, and a wonderful story.  The film's centerpiece of rock is observed gracefully by newcomer Patrick Fudgit (I think that's his name).  Crowe does a masterful job of showing us this world through Fudgit's excited, wide eyes.",979430400,,1149,4.781725888324873
1285450,4,B00003CXMG,"AT the end of Cameron Crowe's semi-autobigraphical piece the question is asked ""What do you like about music?"" So I ask you this ""What do you like about films?"" If your answer is action, sex and fart jokes, this is a movie to stay well away from.  If, however, you like films about growing up, tasting life and finding your place in the world, this is one you should not miss.
The story tells the tale of William Miller, a 15-year-old aspiring journalist who finds himself working for Rolling Stone, covering the 1973 tour of an almost famous band called Stillwater.  Clutching seemingly forever onto a notebook and pen, William immerses himself into the culture of the rock star, and ultimately finds out as much about himself than the feuding rock band he is sent to expose. Whilst getting down on paper just exactly what makes a rock band tick, William has to struggle with his first experiences of love, rejection, fitting in and being cool.  The major strong point is the universally superb acting.  Patrick Fugit as the young writer holds the screen with striking authority without falling into over acting, reminiscent of John Cusack in one of Crowe's earlier films, Say Anything.  He is aptly supported by Kate Hudson, Goldie Hawn's daughter, as the object of William's affection, whose character has arguably the finest scene in the film.  Frances McDormand is excellent as the over-bearing mother whose constant protection of her children ultimately drives them away from home in search of there own answers to life's questions.  Billy Cudrup and Jason Lee shine as the bickering wannabe rock superstars, neither of them happy with their positions within the band and finding it all too easy to complain about each other's falterings.  However, the star of the show is Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Williams mentor Lester Bangs, a man who has an opinion on all facets of the music world. His lyrical waxings are the core of Williams's journey, from  ""Hey, I met you.  You are not cool."" to ""If you wanna be a true journalist, you cannot make friends with the rockstar.""
The film itself has a sumptuous look, complimented by an almost painless attention to detail.  The script is fabulous, with lines to make you laugh, cry and most importantly, think as the story charts the ups and downs of the fictional rock band.  This, however, is the source of my only gripe as the story tends towards the formulaic, with the ending that the film seems to be avoiding coming true in the last moments.  But this flaw is more than compensated by Crowe's deft direction, and his ability to pull together all the loose strands already mentioned into one cohesive whole.
Better than Crowes' previous effort, Jerry Maguire, yet not quite achieving the same iconic status as Say Anything, Almost Famous is nonetheless a film that I urge you to see.  It sure makes a welcome break from films only concerned with being as gross or as violent as the censors will allow.

1285451,5,B00003CXMG,"""Almost Famous"" is one of those rare movies that become enjoyed by all generations of people. It isn't a family movie, but the story is very interesting no matter who you are and what your age is (not to mention, it is based on actual events). It shows a common high school student at the time, with common likes and dislikes, and with dreams. Unlike his other friends and enemies, Patrick Fugit's character William Miller gets to live out his dream. I haven't ever met a member of a famous rock group, or seen anything big about their private life, but this movie is very in-depth with the detail to all of the rock stars lives.  It shows the viewers that rock stars are human beings. They do have to face many problems, just like the average citizen. The publicity of rock stars is displayed well. The lives of real rock stars from that time era seem to be very accurate with the movie. From the bonding while on tours to everything else. Patrick Fugit does a convincing performance as a starstruck 15 year old journalist major. He shows respect to everybody and is polite, but acts very emotionally. The movie is funny too and isn't all that explicit.  It is about a rock band of the 70s, and the movie has talk about drugs and sex, but it is more informative than offensive. It wouldn't be the worst thing to let a child watch this, just to let him understand how things were.

This movie and the stories written about it, allow you to see that the influence of his college professor mother may have developed a base of knowledge to springboard him into a writing career.  Having enjoyed Crowes' masterpieces such as ""Ridgemont High"" and ""Jerry McGuire"", I'll always watch his work and feel privileged to have experienced his autobiography.
The movie itself has exceptional casting.  Crudup as the rock star was perfect.  Kate Hudson as the groupie added an innocent charm that really pulled the movie together and generates the emotional response from the crowd.  And the newcomer who played a young Cameron Crowe really projected a sweetness of adolesence.
There's really two overlapping parts to the movie, his life touring with rock bands which is funny and amazing, and his family's stuggles with how he and his sister handle growing up.  A less gifted writer would have just told the rock story.  But the family story adds a charm to the movie and makes you think to some of your interpersonal battle with loved ones.
The surprise about this movie is why more people aren't going.  I went with 6 other people and to a person, everyone loved it.  Their ages ranged from 47 to 24 with most in their 20's.  I write this as the box office results are coming in disappointing.  Don't be confused.  this is a great movie and will definitely be in my video library.

The plot was original, fast-paced, and exciting: a fifteen-year-old boy follows his dreams of journalism by writing a piece on Stillwater for Rolling Stones magazine in 1973.  This movie does a great job of chronicling the musical scene during the 70's, as well as portraying the journalism world accurately and interestingly.

it's amazing that patrick fugit (william miller) did not get top casting in the credits because, at least in my mind, he was the star....i can't believe i've never seen him before.  he has such an intense honesty to his face that is hardly ever seen in actors his age (and it's great to know that he is a teenager because it's so silly when a character who's 15 or 16 is played by an actor 10 years too old)...i really hope to see him in other things.
kate hudson's luminous performance brought to mind a couple of wonderful old film's heroines (audrey hepburn in 'breakfast at tiffanys'; shirley maclaine in 'the apartment').  her stunning portrayal of penny lane brought a real depth to 'almost famous'.  she has a childlike quality about her and, with even just a smile or glance, she stole every scene she was in...like william miller, the audience can't help but fall in love with her.
i expected not to like frances mcdormand's part as ms. miller, but i actually did. and i felt sorry for her and the all worry she goes through with being distant from her son for so long, having ""rock 'n' roll"" kidnap him...and the immense conflict in her mind; on one hand, really wanting her son to be happy and do what he's talented at, but on the other, desperately wanting him home.  she's very realistic as a mother and, in spite of her different way of life, always has a very strong opposition to drugs and sex.  it's good that she's not the bad guy for being the worried mother and, from what i took from the film, there are no bad guys.  in that sense, 'almost famous' is unbiased..
there are so many amazing pieces in 'almost famous', both funny and touching.  and the cinematography is gorgeous...amongst many other great scenes, who could ever forget the bus sing along or the ethereal ""deflowering""?  the only shame is that there were only 5 people in the theater, myself included.  everyone should watch this film.  it will steal your heart and by the end return it softened with love and music inside.",971654400,3,2536,4.59070796460177
1285514,5,B00003CXMG,"Almost Famous-****-Rated R-Starring Patrick Fugit, Kate Hudson, Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand- Oh what a terrific movie.  Almost Famous follows the path of a 15 year-old writer for Rolling Stone as he tours with the almost famous rock band in the seventies called Stillwater.  Patrick Fugit plays the writer, named Wiliam Miller.  While he is with them, he meets up with Kate Hudson, a groupie with the band.  He falls in love with her, even though he knows that she'll be gone soon.  Stillwater is your typical rock band from the seventies: Sex, Drugs, and Rock & Roll.  It is warming to see William see things for the first time in his life and just look around in awe with gleaming eyes.  One of the best scenes in the movie is when William's mother (played wonderfully by Frances Mcdormand) calls one of the members of the band (played by Billy Crudup) and disciplines him and says, ""You still have substance left in you.  Do something with your life.""  Russell, (Billy Crudup) the wild drunkun guy, can only respond with ""Yes, Ma'am.""  Almost Famous is enlightening and provocative.  This is a movie that you can sit down to in a bad mood, and emerge warm and happy. The music is also terrific with Simon and Garfunkel, Led Zeppelin, Cat Stevens, The Who, Yes, and Stillwater themselves all on the soundtrack.  Simon and Garfunkel's America especially sets the mood in one scene near the beginning.  There is terrific acting by all and a great plot.  This is a true story of the director Cameron Crowe, who also wrote this movie.  Crowe was actually a young reporter for Rolling Stone when he was 15.  Cameron Crowe does a terrific job of bringing his story to life on the screen. He develops the characters so well that you actually feel like you are traveling through the Rock and Roll world with William Miller.  Almost Famous is funny, touching, happy, enlightening, provocotive, and great in almost every way.  There won't be a better movie this year.",970876800,2,1963,4.723529411764706
1285515,5,B00003CXMG,"People fight, people love, but there is always the music. A young William lead the most unordinary childhood one could imagine. Lied to even about his age, he tries desparetely to latch onto something real that he can identify with. Even at his young age his sister leaves from their mother's superimposed values on them and her reckless control. William writes for his school and is eventually noticed by an editor for a local music critque which Willima views as a mentor.
It begins when William is finally noticed by Rolling Stone and is asked to go write an article about Stillwater which is an up and coming band. He soon travels with the band and their ""Bandaids"" which is a petty euphimism for groupies. One in paticualr catches William, a girl who calls herself Penny Lane.
The movie is fair in the sense of camera work, sound, and shot selection. One thing that this movie has that is untouchable by almost any other movie is the writing and character's power. The characters, oh the characters... not one was left uninteresting.
The band themselves are the driving force behind the story and is the reason that the group keeps going to wherever they go. The band's lead singer is the typical man who went to music for stardom, even preplans how the fans will view him. He tries to act like he doesn't care and that is what the audience adores, but he is simply faking it.
The editor of the local magazine is what William becomes through his journey and he does this the hard way. William learns what this man has learned through experience and leanrs most importantly the number one rule that he was told. ""Don't think that you are their friends.""
Russel, the band's guitarist is the one that is what the lead singer wants to be. He is the famous band player and truly is what everyone wants, an easy going slacker. This is what brings much tension between the band memebers, the trueness of Russel. After a long fight and pain between the band was the best scene in the movie. The music brought them back together. In a bus together they play a song and they can't help it, the music gets in them and they sing together. The music brings them together.
Russel himself doesn't know what he wants yet goes simply on instinct in his decisions and that is what gives him his power and his weakness. One of the most important things that comes of this instictual life is an affection for Penny Lane, THE bandaid. The love between Russel and Penny seems as true as could be but it was a candy coat for Russel's instict. The tour had to end and everyone has to return to their respective homes and their respective lives. One part of Russel's life is his girlfriend back home. This to even more tension due to Russel's lack of reality.
Which brings us to the most interesting character of the movie, possibly of the year. The blue jean baby, the LA lady, the seamstress for the band. Penny Lane lived for the life of the band, not the fame that naturally followed them. She loved the music, not the thousands of screaming fans. Sh wanted to live in a fairy tale, and in her own mind was. She always talked about the real world, but never wanted to go back. She was the band's tiny dancer, she wanted to marry a music man. She was the tiny dancer for all of them, she is in them and always with them from then on. If you don't know what I mean, listen to Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"", this song was written for this character. The song made a cameo but should have been a theme.
This was a powerful story about love, pain, but importantly life. Life in its rawest form from everyone's view.

Two)  I loved Jerry Maguire (Cameron Crowe's other big hit) and it was not only because of the characters, but because it dealt around football.  This one has Awesome characters, but deals around 70's rock music--which I know not much about nor do I like the music

The acting is incredible especially when you consider that none of the people were really ""Big name"" actors.

1285596,5,B00003CXMG,"It's 1973, San Diego, California; an exceptionally bright fifteen-year-old aspiring journalist with his heart in rock n' roll goes after an interview with a heavyweight metal band in town for a concert, and winds up tagging along on tour with a band called Stillwater, in ""Almost Famous,"" a semi-autobiographical story from writer/director Cameron Crowe.  And once the bus leaves, it's music, mirth, mayhem and an unforgettable, career-launching experience for young William Miller (Patrick Fugit), as he gets a first hand look at what living the life of a rock musician is all about.  It's a lot to take in, but Miller's intelligence and adaptability belies his youth and he eases into his role quite naturally, with a little help from a couple of new friends:  Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), leader of the groupie elite ""Band aids,"" following Stillwater on their tour; and Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), who plays lead guitar for the band.  For young William it's a foray into a real fantasy world, through which he conducts himself professionally and objectively; quite a triumph considering his previous experience as a writer was limited to a few unsolicited submissions to ""Rolling Stone"" and ""Creem"" magazines, from which he received, up to this point, no response whatsoever.  His only real link to any of it, in fact, has been a chance encounter with Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), editor of Creem, who ultimately becomes something of an anchor to reality for Miller.  Cameron Crowe has given us a brilliant film that works on a number of levels; it's entertaining and insightful, delivered from his own unique perspective and presented objectively and without moralizing.  It's like an excellent piece of journalism committed to film, which enables the audience to make that necessary emotional connection that makes it all so satisfying.  Whether or not you even like rock n' roll, it's undeniably a force that has long since been ingrained in the universal consciousness of the world, and Crowe has captured the essence of it's soul in this movie.  There are characters and moments here with which everyone will be able to readily identify; from Miller's mother, Elaine (wonderfully played by Frances McDormand), the professor who cannot understand the music and fears the influence of it on her children, to the kid who just loves the music, to those obsessed and taken over by it.  It's a detailed look at what it means to be, not necessarily a rock ""star,"" but a struggling band grabbing for the brass ring, and how it affects the lives of so many people directly and indirectly involved.  Crowe takes it deep and demonstrates the upside as well as the down, in a way that sparks the imagination without being too graphic.  It's a movie that allows you to experience the exhilarating, sometimes manic highs as well as the unpleasantness that must accompany it, but Crowe takes pains to deliver the message without ever taking you into unnecessarily dark or murky waters.  He maintains a delicate balance throughout the film that gives it both conscience and credibility.  There are a number of memorable performances, beginning with Fugit, who does such a great job of conveying the maturity of his character, which makes him so believable.  Billy Crudup and Jason Lee (as lead singer Jeff Bebe) breathe life into Stillwater, while Kate Hudson absolutely sparkles as Penny Lane.  And Hoffman takes the small role of Lester Bangs and imbues him with such spirit and nuance that his presence is felt throughout the entire film, as is Elaine, thanks to the tremendous talent of McDormand.  Rounding out the terrific supporting cast are Anna Paquin (Polexia), Fairuza Balk (Sapphire), Terry Chen (Ben Fong-Torres) and Zooey Deschanel (Anita Miller).  ""Almost Famous"" is, in the end, a stirring, thoroughly enjoyable experience; there's great music and some madness, and some real lessons about life in the real world to be learned along the way.  It's a film with wide appeal and something in it for everyone; and if you've ever listened to a record or heard a song, believe me, this is one movie you're going to want to see.",969840000,8,4140,5.0087463556851315
1285597,5,B00003CXMG,"Cameron Crowe is getting better and better with age.  He knows that remarkable things can be done with simple people in simple stories.  It's all a matter of how your present the details.  What is surprising to me is that Crowe is able to make such good movies that are utterly without pretense.  This movie is touching without being maudlin, and manages to develop the character of an ultra precocious 15-year-old--Crowe's alter ego--wihtout making the kid annoyingly cute, and loveably different.  In fact, to all appearances, he's a normal, ""uncool,"" as one of the movie's characters puts it, kid, who happens to have an unusual talent for writing.
Crowe has squeezed remarkable performances from all his actors, who present us with finely realized, 3-dimensional characters where a lesser writer/director would have given us types.  This movie also has some truly funny moments.  And, of course, for anyone who grew up on 70's rock-and-roll (even the tail end of it, as I did), this flick is a memorable blast from the past.",969840000,,1028,4.976608187134503

1285599,5,B00003CXMG,"I thought this movie shows what really talented filmakers can do.  Just when everyone thought movies were going down the drain and noone had an original thought in Hollywood, along comes a movie that breaks those barriers and establishes itself as a classic.  Cameron Crowe did it before with Jerry MGuire and here he does it again only topping himself this time.  The stroty and cast were made for each other and the funny moments were just as tender as the sad moments.  It truly reminded me of what it was like to love Rock and to be in love with someone who doesn't know it.",969494400,,578,4.4245283018867925
1285600,5,B00003CXMG,"It brings back memories of the 70's, the best time for a lot of people.  It is about a up and coming rock n roll band, StillWater and an ambitious writer who knows more than alot of 15 year olds do.  They travel around the US and he is interviewing along the way along with the Bandaids, a few girls who are groupies.  This movie has excellent music, superb acting and a dynamite plot.  I will definitely see this again and again and be in line to purchase the DVD when it is available and tomorrow I will be purchasing the soundtrack.  A must movie for fans of both Jerry McGwire and 70's era.",969408000,,594,4.175438596491228
1285601,4,B00003CXMG,You'll just feel good if you go see this movie. I hardly give perfect scores but this should be 4 1/2 stars. Frances McDormand as the mother is wonderful. Kate Hudson is as sparkling as the  glitter that surrounds her. Billy Crudup & Jason Lee could front any rock band and Patrick Fugit is as wide-eyed an innocent as you could hope for. The soundtrack is a must have.,969408000,,369,4.3478260869565215
1285602,3,B00003CXMG,"I was disappointed in ""Almost Famous""; I was expecting more from this movie.  The story centers around a teenager traveling with a rock  band, during the early 1970s, while fulfilling journalistic duties.  In the  meantime, he starts to have feelings for one of the groupees that has been  traveling with them.  The previews made this movie look much better than it  actually was.",969235200,,380,4.936507936507937
1285603,4,B00003CXMG,"""Almost Famous"" has all the right ingredients to be a success; a nostalgic coming of age story about a young man who comes to terms with  himself and the world, an utterly appealing cast of actors, and a  writer/director who has already earned respect and praise through his  previous work. The movie is impossible to dislike it, mainly because it is  crafted with such heart-felt sincerity, and it helps greatly when the array  of performances shine from beginning to end. In terms of touching upon  issues such as growing up and realizing your own identity, ""Almost  Famous"" does a fairly effective job using the 70's rock-era as a  backdrop and a naive 15 year old as the emotional centre. It is evident  that Cameron Crowe is infusing the film with his own experiences, and it  generates a feel of affection (a bit TOO much at times) for the story and  it's characters. He has a great eye for detail, with both the physical and  emotional dynamics. I was genuinely impressed with Kate Hudson's  performance as Penny Lane, she helps build the most poignant moments, and  plays her role with beguiling nuance. The only real fault in ""Almost  Famous"" is how it meanders at times, losing focus on themes at hand,  plus there's a plane scene towards the end that feels like a total  contrivance. But overall, this is still a good movie that will definitely  be remembered as one of 2000's few cinematic highlights. Oh yeah, and the  soundtrack is an all-around winner too.",969062400,,1471,4.7204724409448815
1285604,5,B00003CXMG,"Cameron Crowe's latest, ""Almost Famous"" is hands-down the best picture of 2000.  It is a funny, dramatic, romantic, and stunning  auto-biographical love letter to 70s rock.  The acting is immpecable, with  Billy Crudup, Jason Lee and Kate Hudson giving the strongest performances  of their careers.  Newcomer Patrick Fugit holds his own in high company  with a performance that ties together every aspect of the film, and Philip  Seymour Hoffman steals his scenes in slight subtlety.  The direction, the  acting, the cinematography, the script, the soundtrack - they are all  masterfully executed and combined by Cameron Crowe, who with every picture  gets better and better.  I wasn't alive in the 70s, nor do I have an  especially strong affinity for the music of the period, but anybody who  loves character and story-driven movies will love this.  Mr. Crowe and I  share a favorite director, Mr. Billy Wilder, and I must say that with every  picture he gets closer and closer to attaining a diverse and consistently  brilliant filmography to rival that of the master Wilder's.  And, if you're  a Wilder fan, look for a slightly twisted homage to the stomach pump scene  from ""The Apartment"" in ""Almost Famous"".  I strongly  recommend that everyone who enjoys movies of a deep and profoundly  entertaining nature see this.  With ""Almost Famous"", nobody can  honestly say that contemporary cinema produces nothing of value, because  Cameron Crowe and co. have.  I saw this just a few hours ago and I still  feel it.  I think it will be on of those films that sticks inside for a  long time.",969062400,22,1592,4.935361216730038
