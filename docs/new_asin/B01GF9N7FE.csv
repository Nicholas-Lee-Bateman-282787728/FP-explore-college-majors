7759473,3,B01GF9N7FE,"This is another end of the world formula film. Thomas Rourke (Johnny Strong) is the rogue element who has survived on his own fighting berserker creatures who only come out at night. In Dallas he meets up with a group of people who want to find an airplane (try the airport) so they can all fly off to ""Brave New World."" Lance Henriksen plays the tough guy the head of the group, and Chelsea Edmundson the token leading lady saved by Thomas. Thomas has a plan, but nothing goes as planned.

Like most films of this nature, the budget confines it to a limited amount of sets. The idea that after two years fuel stabilizers might be needed is not entertained. This is a low budget ""Mad Max"" plus infected vampire-zombies. Characters are stereotyped.

7759482,3,B01GF9N7FE,"*** 3 Stars *** Could've been called 'The Running Dead' cause we got us some fast and acrobatic zombies here.  It's ok to change the stereotype, but all we get out of it is an excuse for nearly endless (and always accurate) machine gun fire ... honestly, too many of the action scenes just seem like repeats of the last one, and that can get boring despite the bullet count.  That said, the best thing about this flick (just as with 'the walking dead') is the sense of community, the relationships, between the characters.  Of course the main guy (Rourke, played by ever steely-eyed Johnny Strong) isn't up for any warm and cuddly moments, but ... you sort of expect that.  All in all, a perfectly average but watchable zombie flick (Or are they vampires ... they catch fire and turn into ashes when the sunlight hits them, just like your average drac, but ... they're not blood-suckers - just your basic carnivores.  Wow, could be a whole new species of post-apocalyptic nasties!)

7759484,4,B01GF9N7FE,"The only thing big budget movies like this have, that this one doesn't, is a ton of CGI and other special effects.

The Undead are vampire runners, not Walkers. Guns are used how guns really work in real life. (Such a welcome change, TWD crew should ask for lessons.) There is pretty much nothing but action, but it's well done, and suspenseful. There isn't really any character development to speak of, but with its pacing, it isn't needed past the point it does, and everything falls into place well.

It's a standard End of the World story that is well executed, good actors, good cinematography, good editing, and good pacing. The music was all composed and performed by the lead actor: Johnny Strong, (who was in Black Hawk Down, and Fast and Furious,) and it's very good. The instrumental score has a heavy Ry Cooder vibe to it, like Last Man Standing, and Book of Eli.

There's nothing cheesy about the movie. It's a very credible outing for a end of the world action flick.",1516060800,,981,4.594285714285714

7759487,4,B01GF9N7FE,This is a fun film. Well made and performed. Not sure why a couple reviewers thought only a few actors were good. These are all top notch actors and the production design etc were top notch. Truly felt Apocalyptic. It's another view with slight differences then other Zombie/Infected humans. I checked it out cause of Gary Cairns. Was a fan of a film he did Lost In A Crowd and Malignant so I saw he was in this. Wish he was in it more but nonetheless this film was a pleasant surprise. Now I'm a fan of the Director of this film and a few more actors. Good Ol' Lance Henriksen makes his presence felt. Love his voice.,1513123200,2,618,4.245762711864407

It has a very gritty and dirty feel to it as if it was filmed back in the 80's. The lead man is a real life gun guy, knife maker and has a black belt in Jiujitsu. The action, gun handling, and tactics are amazing. Our hero is your classic ""lost everything he loved"" type who is basically traveling across country killing as many creatures as he can. The story could have been a little better, but everything else makes up for it.  Definitely more action than dialog.  There is no shortage of ammo or cool guns.

7759495,4,B01GF9N7FE,"As an independent film maker myself, I have to say they did a hell of a job with this one. I enjoyed the camera work and thought the color grade was spot on. The acting was decent for the genre and the realistic efforts with the weaponry was especially appreciated. However there was some great opportunities to develop the story which would of made this film a much more solid effort. This being the only reason I'm taking a star away.

I honestly felt that there was no strong character development. You want to see those bonds built as they progress through the story so one can truly cheer on the protagonist. This could of been achieved rather early in the story, a strong opening act was missing here. You have so much action and fighting in the opening, middle and final acts that I feel you missed a great opportunity to really get us to invest in these characters.

It was wonderful to see Lance Henrikson still in action. I got a wonderful chance to meet him at Crypticon in Seattle. Was a lovely man, and I'm sure he was probably a joy to have on the production! The rest of your cast really delivered as far as performance. I especially like Louis Mandylor's efforts. He was probably your strongest actor on the film, followed by Lance and Hakeem.  Johnny and Chelsea did a acceptable job but I felt they were rather limited by the story trappings.

Overall though William, your work as a director should be praised, you nailed the small details and I can only imagine the heart and soul you poured into this production. Bravo sir. You should also be very proud of the crew you worked with, they did a hell of job for their parts in the film. Finally.

If you're looking for a fast-paced Z-flick, this is for you. If you're looking for great dialogue, you're in the wrong place. If you're itching for a zombie movie, give it a shot, but go in without comparing it to whatever your beloved zombie show/movie is and youll enjoy it.

It puts a slightly new spin on the genre. What helps to set it apart is the smart thinking zombie- that's all I'll say...

Lots of action- running, killing with guns, knives, explosives, and surprises (I didn't think I could jump from a zombie film anymore, but apparently I can). Its the typical virus or something hits (I don't recall them saying what caused it but maybe I missed it), causing fast zombies who want to feed off unaffected humans. People trapped looking for escape- good, bad, those who can't fight, etc.

Honestly its a bummer the dialogue wasn't better because it wouldve been a huge hit.

Yes predictable, but worthy of a watch.",1490227200,2,952,4.682634730538922

7759544,3,B01GF9N7FE,"Characters were extremely archetypal to the point of predictability. The writing is poorly done, though better than most low budget films. The action is better than most low budget films, and is entertaining, even if a bit absurd at times.

The characters that are supposedly well trained, long term survivors, though act as if this is their first rodeo. They utilize poor tactics, beyond some well implemented military posturing, they don't check doorways properly, and make poor fall-back decisions. At many points you'll find yourself questioning why in the hell would they ever split up and go different ways, when given the option of standing together, in a point where they have to stand together, as they need to defend the entry ways to the next level. There are significant gaps in the writing, though these are somewhat mitigated by the fact that it is a low budget, they couldn't afford better I guess. Too many plot holes; feels like a generic zombie survival movie. Generic plague wiped out humanity, turned them into fast moving Ghouls (if you know the reference from Fallout). Big Bad is LITERALLY seen to be wearing a Bulletproof vest...people question why their shots to the chest aren't harming him, yes they were aiming for the chest on a guy that has to be wearing better armor than what our soldier's wear.

Predicable characters:
*If you think a character will die, they likely will.
*They act just as they would if they were the exemplar of their type, rather than like a human being would. They don't have conflicting emotions or decisions, and seem to act only as the generic, one line description, of their character would.
*Characters do not grow or evolve over the course of the movie, do not believe the official description. He does not really stick around to help them, he just does it, to do it.
*Loner main character is loner, with no emotions, thoughts, or feelings. Wants revenge for a stereotypical reason that I'd be ashamed if you couldn't see coming from 5 miles away.

Survivor Group:
*They lack cohesion like you might expect, but do not have realistic depth. Character that says assholic things and looks like an idiot, is an idiot and does stupid things.
*Their main directive is to find a way to reach a plane, not a spoiler b/c this is revealed like directly upon meeting them. Except, they have no USE for said plane. No plans to go anywhere in particular, despite them having ample knowledge that the plague wiped out the majority of humanity. They have no airplane fuel either, they do have a pilot. Decrepit plane hopefully will have not been down day of plague due to unfinished repairs. They didn't check. :D
*No solid sense of time since the plague happened, so no idea how 'veteran' they are. Based on the scenes pictured, it's been at least a few months. Their guards work alone, fall asleep on the job, do not take shifts, are very bad at what they do. This happens comically often.

Last thing, rather minor spoilers, Ghoul-people somehow are smart enough, and strong enough, to pick up cars to block a garage door, but not strong enough to break down a thin metal or wood door at times with utter ease?

Chad Law wrote another winner and William Kaufman killed it as the director.  This is a winning team that seemingly can't go wrong.

The infected, plagued can't go in the sun. When they bite you, you become infected. They don't turn into bats and can be killed by bullets.
The Alpha is their leader. I don't want to spoil the movie but his ability to take more damage is not a S on his chest but a .........
The survivors have the mandatory douche bag who ironically is in a expensive car when he gets his.
One maurauder was wearing a prison jumpsuit. One of the plot points is that society fell 3 years ago. I would think a con would change out.
The infected mostly wear hoodies and dark clothing. This makes a great Halloween costume. I did like the tactics and gunplay.
I would like the director and production company to make more movies in Dallas.",1483747200,,957,4.252747252747253

Yes, it is entertaining and not a bad way to spend an hour or so. In turn, I believe they committed almost every movie cliche they could get their hands on, action and a few horror.  The plot is weak, there are holes in the story line you can drive a mack truck through and the acting is all over the board on the bad side of the spectrum, from over acting in some scenes to pretty general bad acting in others.  The main antagonist looks like a pro wrestler with orangutan teeth rather than the traditional vamp fangs.  I really do not understand how Henricksen's experience did not rub off on the less than seasoned actors.  This movie had potential to be a great low budget action/horror film but fell way short.

Best zombie movie I've seen since the remake of Dawn of the Dead!  I've watched/tried to watch most of the zombie movies available through Prime.
Highly recommend.
I rented it based on a strong recommendation from a friend.  I don't normally re-watch movies, but I watched this three times during my rental period and ended up going ahead and buying it.
Production values are at a B+, acting A-, storyline is a solid B+.
The firearm handling was entertaining and better than most large budget movies.
The way different groups developed and organized within the remaining non-infected was plausible.
If you're into apocalypse / zombie flicks, this is a breath of fresh air wrt most other movies available now on Prime.
I even took the time to copy/paste the product link.  Probably won't do that again for any review.",1478908800,11,971,5.682758620689655

Similar to Snake from escape from new york fame, Rourke is a stand alone entity that only needs what he needs to continue the fight. He is not worried about the next day, just the now of it. When you do watch this movie remember that. It's about Rourke coping with the reality of what is.

7759731,4,B01GF9N7FE,"Daylight's End is a small-budget film in the zombie/infected genre that can actually be enjoyed as long as you keep your expectations within the genre itself, which is full of clunkers. By small-budget I wish to distinguish it from films with hardly any budget at all being made nowadays by amateurs who are learning as they go. This film was made by professionals who know how to set up scenes, shoot a camera, edit and thankfully, act. It's small budget in having a small cast (though more than most of these films) and having to shoot mostly in a couple of abandoned buildings. Even with these limitations, action director William Kaufman (Sinners & Saints) manages to make an entertaining action-oriented film.

Do not expect anything too new in the film. The genre is very limited because the zombies can't really think (like vampires or aliens) and this has plagued the whole thing from its inception. The major innovation was to make them fast ""infected"" people who are basically more dangerous but who aren't as eerie as the slow-moving living dead. Some films have blurred the lines between these two. Nevertheless both types are mindless and once you start making the creatures intelligent, as some have, they're not zombies anymore. So what you have here is the people-holed-up-in-a-building-fighting-zombies and hoping to escape plot.

There is a difference in the creatures here. Definitely not Romero zombies, these are most similar to Richard Matheson's I Am Legend ghouls (the book not the movie), but in a different way than other adaptations. In The Last Man On Earth with Vincent Price they were almost like sleepwalkers; in The Omega Man with Charleton Heston they were very literate and talked a lot but were albinos wearing sunglasses; in I Am Legend with will Smith they were really ugly and more like ""infected"" ravagers. Here they tread a middle ground. There is some intelligence but it's more like animals since they follow an ""Alpha"" who is their leader. Mostly they act like 28 Days Later types and run at you so they can bite you but they can turn over cars to block people's escaping, which makes them smarter than your average zombie. Like the creatures in Stake Land and 80's film Near Dark (both highly recommended) they burn up in sunlight and must hide by day and are only active at night.

It all takes place in Dallas, mostly at a police station (the actual one where Lee Harvey Oswald was shot), and an abandoned hotel. Johnny Strong, with experience in many action films, is good as the loner who falls in with the group of survivors to help them. It's decent overall as long as expectations aren't too high. I did think that the end happened a little too neatly and quickly but not enough to spoil the film.",1474070400,18,2748,4.781052631578947

7759739,4,B01GF9N7FE,"Yes, it is low budget. Adobe After Effects abound. As another reviewer stated, however, the shooting and action sequences are plentiful and well done. This movie reminded me greatly of the video game, LEFT 4 DEAD (and LFD2). The plot line was somewhat skewed and I must warn there are possible spoilers in this statement: SPOILER ALERT: The main character states he came to Texas from New York. He has only just arrived at the Dallas area police station when he sees a Zambie he knows, in fact, it is the one who ""turned"" his wife-to-be into a Zambie some time ago. So HOW is it that this exact same Zambie is now in Texas? To me, that was a HUGE GAPING WHOLE in the story. Then you have to have stupid questions asked at inappropriate times. As the crew is preparing to meet a Zambie attack which will mean life or death for them all, the female lead asks the male lead what his girlfriend was like. REALLY? Why not ask for his favorite chili recipe too, while you're at it!? Yeah, we don't want to go to hard. So we soften the violence with such puffery!  STOP IT!

Can't cut this film a break when it has the same fight scene again and again, and when doors are not closed and blockaded, and when all the characters are given so much time on screen that each one becomes emotionally important, and then most of them die in the same dang way.  Writing and acting was great for sussing out characters, but the editing and continuity problems kept jarring me.

And is there a single derelict building that some low-budget film hasn't used?  And aren't all these actors dying of various maladies from breathing in the toxic air of these sites?  GAWD!  Who isn't tired of an endless HD parade of jump cuts to yet more and very detailed heaps of garbage, refuse, broken stuff, trash, with peeling paint, and dirty yucky cruddy scuzzy germy fetid rot being relentlessly forced into the viewers' brains?

This wasn't a horror film -- it was a psych test to see if one could Zen muster up some interest in the film to last until the end, but I ran completely dry by the 3/4ths of the film mark.  I just didn't care anymore when there was so much the writing never had these characters devising to help themselves in obvious ways.  Dirt galore, stupid people, and 300 identical zombies that all growled the same, ravaged the same, affected the same sports-wear and fashion accoutrements, and could win a gold metal in the 100 meter sprint.  Boring.

Meanwhile the silent hero thing got very old.  And the artsy fartsy dream scenes just didn't belong.  Too many good people who then died.  Only one jerk in the film had me wanting more personality flaws so that I could enjoy the deaths at little more -- yes I just wrote that, but at least 20 sussed out characters got killed, it hurt -- and it just turned off something in me, and the film became a chore from then on.

AND I HATE WHEN CHARACTERS USE A FLASHLIGHT IN WELL LIT ROOMS or worse when they shine the light around when they're trying to be stealthy.  GAWD!

My bad.  The reviews were warning enough and the trailer didn't lie.  May my financial loss be a lesson to others so that I might at least serve some purpose by having suffered.  I took one for the team.",1473638400,,2253,4.459657701711492

7759749,4,B01GF9N7FE,"I just watched this and felt the need to review based on some misleading comments from other reviewers here on Amazon. This movie exceeded my expectations, but you do need to have the right context going in - compared to other low-budget, direct-to-video options, this movie is a gem. Compared to larger-budget Hollywood films, it still stands up ok but is definitely not in the same league.

So here are a few things to consider which might help you decide if you want to give this a try:

1. Do you insist that all zombies must follow the Romero/Walking Dead rules, i.e., headshots are the only way to kill and they are slow shamblers? If so, skip this one. However, if you enjoy ""zombie""-esque movies which have different, but consistent, rules, you might like this film.

2. Do you appreciate movies that use realistic gun handling and combat tactics? If yes, you will definitely enjoy this one (and if you are a gun buff, you will appreciate the use of a lot of nice firearms that are often overlooked, including the hero's sweet M1A SOCOM, multiple 1911's and a wicked bullpup shotgun).

3. Do you prefer zombie movies where the cast spends 80% the screen-time hand-wringing over the plight of humanity and the meaning of life in the new zombie-infested world? If so, skip this one. If you like lots of action and realistic combat strategy, give this one a try.

4. Lastly, are you willing to forgive weak (but not bad) storyline for strong, believable action, above-par (for the genre) acting and good production values? If yes, this might be your movie.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that this is really an action movie set in the ""zombie"" apocalypse rather than being a horror movie with some action. I agree with other reviewers that the story could have been better, but the other elements made up for this weakness.",1473638400,154,1842,4.669753086419753

It's a bit trite, and seems a little confused as to what kind of movie it wants to be. It tries to move in too many directions at once, and as a result, goes nowhere. The writing seems a bit sophomoric as well, as if none of the characters have permanence of memory. The acting was actually quite good, but bad writing is bad writing, no matter how well acted. I suspect many of the 5 star ratings are from people involved in its production or promotion. This is a great marketing tactic tied in well with a negligible price difference between rental and purchase. All of that being said, it's a pretty good one-off rental. It won't blow you away and you probably won't remember it in a week, but it will keep you from dying of boredom (though boredom related injury may still occur).",1473552000,7,888,4.291666666666667

Even though you won't really care much for the characters or have any quotable one liners or laugh at all or look past the mediocre  acting, the simple plot is decent enough. They did their best with the under a million dollar budget and every penny is on the screen but the legit tactics and cool fire fights are what sell the movie. The military and firearm advisers for the film did a great job.

Except for the fact that the set designer didn't weld the top of the metal webbing to the frame on three sides.  This means a zombie could easily figure out how to squeeze a zombie hand between the webbing and grab our hero and eat him.  Lots of other silly stuff that eventually became so boring I fell asleep.

William Kaufman as director & Chad Law producer/writer. I can't say enough good things about this match up.

Gary Cairns II did a wonderful job with his comedic approach as Drew & last but not least, Lance Henrickson, an absolute master playing what I know best...a police chief.

7759800,3,B01GF9N7FE,"I've watched untold zombie flicks, and this one seems to have two camps of reviewers - those that say it's crud, and those with a more positive spin. If you've truly watched low-budget movies, then Daylight's End has many things it does well. The cinematography exceeded my expectations, the zombie make-up was decent, the firearms/combat scenes were realistic (and professional), the music was good and the acting was entertaining (Lance, Johnny Strong, Chelsea Edmundson, Louis Mandylor... really most of the characters had good moments). I have seen far worse, especially in this genre. Based on these categories alone, I would have given it four stars on my Indie scale.

So, what's the problem you ask? My answer - the writing. I don't know the backstory on the film, but someone needed to rework this plot before letting it loose. It has too many jumbled aspects that don't mesh. One reviewer asked if there were two different directors between the beginning and end scenes, and I understand why. These next few observations are PLOT SPOILERS, so stop now if that's a concern.

A few examples of the mess include the following, you'll get the idea:

1. Are these really zombies (shots to the body kill just as well as head shots), yet we also have one alpha zombie that takes three shots to the chest but ignores them like bee stings;
2. The alpha zombie has a history with our hero seemingly from NY and yet it turns up in Texas with our hero who has been speeding across the country in his car;
3. The zombies burn in daylight, begging the question of are we dealing with vampires, zombies, diseased people, or what?;
4. The zombies take direction from the alpha, i.e., knocking out cameras, piling up cars and attacking on command - so now they think? Okay, if we have intelligent zombies, then does it make sense to have the zombies rushing into hailstorms of bullets without thought as they are mowed down in droves?;
5. Marauders - we have one opening scene (that was cool) of human marauders, after that, they never appear in the story again. This goes to suspending your belief that this world exists;
6. Similarly, there should be millions of zombies - however, in this major city, we only see a handful controlled by the alpha - zombies should be all over the streets at dusk.
7. The survivors needed to transport lots of people - women, children, etc. -  and despite sending scouts out for two years to check for an airplane, no one ever thought to scrounge ground transportation?
8. The building they are in has power? Okay, after two years...how? Gasoline goes bad fairly quickly, even with a stabilizer. They have fresh gas and charged batteries to jump cars... cars that are dead after two years on the street.
9. The ending - not horrible, just so trite, so expected, so not offering anything new... the opportunity was wasted.

Parental Warning - hey, its a zombie flick...plenty of violence, blood, cursing and death. Older teens should be fine given every other zombie movie they've seen.

In conclusion, the firearms, hand-to-hand, and combat movements were much appreciated, as were the other positive factors, but the story hurt this offering in that if done with more care, it could have been a great ""B"" movie. Now, I'd say as long as you adjust your expectations, go ahead with a rental when the price drops.

7759817,4,B01GF9N7FE,"Overall  ""Daylights End"" is a fun and solid zombie based action film. I will start with the perks of the film. The weapons handling and attention to detail was extremely realistic. Its one of the best films I have seen that portrays gun play properly (weapon jams, reloads, tactics). Even YouTubes James Yeager shows up rocking his Ak47 like a boss. The action was filmed very smoothly and the music was brought in appropriately. The protagonist did a rock solid job for being new to the industry. There is decent character development and the dialogue is not at all bad. Some of the downsides are the plot is of course cliche and the ending is not quite satisfactory. This is just a run and gun type of movie and to be enjoyed as it is.

Good guys, bad guys, excellent gun fighting and zombie vampires (Zompires?). What else could you want! The score (by lead actor Johnny Strong) is terrific and runs the gamut from hard rock to creepy instrumentals. Johnny Strong as the anti-hero stranger is sheer perfection. Lance Henriksen gives us exactly what we expect: Lance Henriksen. Tough, abrasive and compassionate all rolled into the same character.

Never saw him in anything before but can tell you I'll be on the lookout for his work. Has kind of a deadpan delivery but with action, action, action I suppose dialog isn't a top selling point.

to the top of that list and is another must own for me. It's action
packed from the opening scene all the way until the end and I never got
bored once while watching it. It's got some great jumps in it along
with some cool shoot out sequences. If you like guns there are plenty
here to enjoy. The production value, editing, acting, sound design, and

It has a lot of action, a handsome rogue hero on a mission, loss and gain, and lots of blood and zombie gore, and while hinting at romances, never focused on sex. It got down to the business of fighting the enemy and winning.  I loved it! I loved the visuals and the makeup artists on this film rocked. The writers created a more real life type of movie which made the movie more realistic than fiction and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Be ready for a lot of blood, a lot of guns fighting, and great twists and turns.  It was well directed, well cast, well thought out and so much fun!  What I truly loved was that the story line built up to a great ending which also left room for a sequel...and left you wanting to see one.

7759864,5,B01GF9N7FE,"(Beware, amateur posting ahead.) Of course there are many who come to this via one Mr. James Yeager, and his brief appearance is very forgivable considering how absolutely entertaining this small budget action movie is. Many folks in the firearms community will appreciate the ""realistic' use of guns in this movie where folks actually reload their weapons because rounds, unlike some big budget movies funding, is a finite resource and I would bid, this works in this movies favor.

  For many, the ""end of the world"" genre may have reached its peak long ago but this movie brings a fresh approach IMHO. Harsh realities are dealt with. Sacrifices are made with no ""hero worship"" as they do what they have to do with no fan fair and this alone I think is worth the trip or at least, i appreciated it.

  As a bonus, there was much screen time given to Sony Puzikas and he does ""his thing"" very well indeed. Folks not familiar with ""the Russian guy"" in the movie may find his weapons handling very.....""unique"",  but rest assured, this is what he does. As an aside, hes not killing anybody with kindness in this flick, its pure 7.62x39 and God bless this gentleman for it.

  The main character was a bit of the typical ""brooding"" silent type but really, who could blame him. Women love him, and men want to be him. (P.S....there's some eye candy for the ladies..and for some of the mens). I think he fit the bill perfectly. Some may recognize Mr. Strong from Black Hawk Down where he portrayed real life hero (seriously folks), Randall Shughart. I don't know much about this actor but he did a fine job in this movie and his weapons handling was exceptional which added to his role as ""where the hell did this guy come from and what the hell did he do before?"" I hope to see much more Mr Strong in the future.

  Many folks contemplating watching this movie will be from you tube for sure and I say to you, GO FOR IT!!!!

  To all involved in this movie, damn well done! Thank you:)

Even the smaller supporting roles did an amazing job. The music / score was also on point. I enjoyed the song at the very end of the movie.

7759878,5,B01GF9N7FE,"I'll open up with saying that I have been tracking this film for the better part of two years, and waiting on baited breath for this release. Though I certainly enjoy the title actor - Johnny Strong - he certainly hasn't been my pull, nor has a biased anticipation. For far too long, action-horror has existed in the realm of the poorly devised - where film quality is no better than a camcorder, the music no better that an old Nokia ringtone. This is merely a segment of the issues faced by an indie production, but I will say, Daylight's End has not met such an unkind fate.

There are a few things that I required, so I won't labour on. I need action - real action. Not some old 1970's Batman rough'em up, but the kind of action that you could actually picture in such a scenario. Being that there were more than a handful of true gun-guys on set - and a prop department that didn't cut any corners - it's no surprise the the gunplay was top notch. Honestly, I can't wait to see someone cut together a 'kill count' for this movie, because it'll give Commando a run for its money. Again, I could go on forever about the sequencing, but I'll leave it at this...

For the first time in a long time, I didn't find myself yelling at the screen, demanding that the actors do something 'better'. The whole cast and crew made this a thrill to watch, and heck, had me on the edge of my seat for a number of 'close' calls. For that alone, top friggen' notch.

The second piece that is critical for me is the music. All too often you'll have an indie flick with music that either doesn't fit, or just makes you cringe. I truly enjoyed one of Johnny Strong's last flicks (Sinners and Saints), but man, the score was an absolute train wreck. The whole thing sounded like it had been built on an old Casio keyboard from the 80's, and couldn't have been more of a violation. Daylight's End on the other hand was absolutely masterful, and perfectly cued to match the emotion. I had wondered why this was such a perfect fit, and quickly had my answer. Not only was the movie led by Johnny Strong, but also scored. This of course led me down another rabbit hole, in which I discovered that he is actually an amazing musician from a band called 'Operator'. So you have an actor who's up to his neck in the film, and then he's given the opportunity to score. How you could get a better fit, I really don't know. Nailed it!

So I'm rambling here, sorry - let me try and bring it back around.

If you like zombie flicks, catch this film. If you like vampire films, watch this movie. If you like face-melting shootout scenes, watch it. If you like the saturated pallet of a film noir such as Underworld, watch it. If you like a solid and true action flick, watch it. There won't be any Oscars on this one, but I can say that there wasn't anything that I didn't like...that is the true mark of a good movie for me. Well, there is one thing: I don't know when they're doing another, but I can't hold that against them.

If you liked Underworld, 28 Days Later, Stakeland, Daylight, Dawn of the Dead (2000's), or any other topnotch action-horror, you won't be disappointed in the least. Go get 'em!",1472256000,3,3175,4.318791946308725

Sure, it might not have a huge amount of character development on all the characters, but then it's not a drama, it's an action movie! Compared to Aliens or Predator, or any other classic action movie, Daylight's End gives enough character development to keep the characters from being flat while keeping the focus on the action so the movie doesn't drag. That's exactly what you need in a good action movie. I was especially impressed at how the characters handled their firearms. In many action films I can tell the actors don't really know what they are doing and wouldn't know how to properly handle a firearm if they had to do so for real. A common mistake you see is when a lead character picks up a handgun or rifle...and immediately puts their finger in the trigger well on the trigger while picking it up. I saw no such mistakes in Daylight's End, which tells me that they hired people who really knew firearms or at least trained the actors in proper handling.",1472169600,33,1066,4.61578947368421

This film gives a big middle finger to that kind of action film.
It gives you, the audience, a visceral and believable experience- from the beginning to the end.  There's nothing left out, from the score casting an eerie, uneasy tone, to locations and costuming so realistic, that I believe Dallas has fallen. To a complete plot line that doesn't fizzle out.
