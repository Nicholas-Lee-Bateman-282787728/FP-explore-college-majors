7878850,2,6304896816,"This is the sixth volume in the famed BLACK JACK OAV series, based on Osamu Tezuka's pioneering manga about a maverick medical doctor of extraordinary skill and daring who takes the toughest, most demanding jobs. While many of the BLACK JACK animated tales have their bizarre elements, this one is the oddest, due to the fact that it appears to be set in feudal Japan and involves a dying Princess, a loyal retainer, a jealous official, and numerous soldiers dressed in military armor and carrying traditional weapons. Answering a two-year-old call, Black Jack finds himself on a remote mountain seeking his patient and winds up in a temple where a Buddhist nun serves as his entre into what seems to be a trip back in time. The dying Princess is given to fits of violence and the cause of her condition turns out to be very unusual indeed. Meanwhile, the nun conspires with the court official to punish the Princess for refusing to marry him. It turns out that the Princess is in love with the loyal retainer.
To make a long story short, the explanation for Black Jack's mysterious time trip is rather prosaic and not unexpected, but still pretty unsatisfying. The final sequence, which ties things up, offers some compensation. If you can watch the historical portion as simply a historical tale and not worry about the whys and wherefores, you will at least be treated to a well-designed and pictorially beautiful rendition of old Japanese mansions, temples, interior decor and costumes, all set amidst an unending fall of snow.",1058745600,,1531,4.847328244274809

(Maybe that's just me.) Anyhoo, get this video (the best one is Clinical Chart 2!!)  ~M (Ps: The theme songs are beautiful {though I like the earlier ones [Darkest Time-Just Before the Sunrise]better}) (pps: Pinoko is the cutest little anime girl since Rini! Cuter!*L*)",975369600,,592,4.92
