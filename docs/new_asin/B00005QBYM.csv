8537488,5,B00005QBYM,"Great movie that gave off a bit of a Kevin Smith vibe. The reviewer below, who reviewed it poorly did not seem to understand the point of the movie, kurt Cobain is just a subplot. The movie gives a great view of ""Generation X"" and is very funny as well with great acting from the entire cast.",1156377600,,292,4.140350877192983
8537489,5,B00005QBYM,"This movie is full of great one liners about several different things, including the troubles of being vegetarian in arrogant meat-eating America. It also talks about how stupid society is, and how everyone is just conforming to it. You actually can very easily relate to the actors in this movie, unless maybe you are a materialistic yuppy. The conversations and arguments between the friends are very believable, and remind me much of my friends and I discussing how horrible the music industry is. This movie is definitely worth seeing, and to me definitely worth buying.",1103587200,3,574,5.052631578947368
