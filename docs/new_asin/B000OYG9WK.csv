8187773,5,B000OYG9WK,"This is the story of Misaki, she's moved to Tokyo to attend middle school and live with her aunt. On her first day there she sees an ""Angelic Layer"" battle on TV and falls in love with it. In Angelic Layer people compete using dolls they remotely control with their mind to fight. It's a very popular game that has a huge fan base and lots of skilled competitors. Misaki gets an Angel and starts to play Angelic Layer. Through the game she meets lots of new friends and even unlocks secrets about her past, like the true identity of her mother and father.

This anime is mainly a fun & games type show. It has a lot of good lessons to teach about love and friendship with a descent amount of drama, but it's not upsetting drama; it's more fulfilling. I have loved every CLAMP anime I've ever seen and this is no exception. It's not as emotionally heavy as X or Tsubasa, but it's a nice change of pace. It think this is also one you can sit down and watch with the whole family. Young and old can find something charming about this little gem.",1356739200,,1042,4.262626262626263
