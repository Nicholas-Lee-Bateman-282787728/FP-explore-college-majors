7790151,2,0783216998,"There's good reason A Mother's Prayer isn't on DVD, and can be purchased on VHS for less than $5.  It's not a very good movie.  The dialogue and acting are pretty uneven, and it seems like there wasn't enough rehearsal.  This is apparent when seasoned actors like Kate Nelligan and Bruce Dern were on screen.  They seem to take it in stride, delivering professional performances that put most of the others to shame.  Linda Hamilton is okay, but you will HATE the obnoxious kid!!!  Bad writing / direction may've been partly to blame, but I hope NEVER to see Noah Fleiss in ANYTHING again.",1314576000,,589,4.615384615384615
7790152,5,0783216998,"This was a VERY well-done movie about the subject of AIDS and what it does to families. Everyone in this one was excellent, but I must single out two performances--Rupaul, who was really extraordinary--and Linda Hamilton--who did her usual superlative job for her character on screen. I would highly recommend this to anyone--but especially to ones dealing with the hideous epidemic named AIDS.",1208304000,2,394,5.26984126984127
