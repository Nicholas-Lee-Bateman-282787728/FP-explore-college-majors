5047118,4,B0071AD9OQ,"I bought a number of these for presents this Christmas. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the long, seemingly unconnected first part (11 minutes with a young girl) and a story at the end that wasn't too interesting if you don't like car racing. The 30 minutes in the middle are well worth wading through the rest.",1355788800,2,333,4.301587301587301
5047119,5,B0071AD9OQ,Great thought provoking words. Purchased this video along with the 4 part Passion series after seeing the one on Indescribable at our church. We are so lucky that God gave us the gift of his own Son. Giglio is an awesome speaker who you will not be bored with! Interesting the whole way thru!!!,1332460800,,294,4.462962962962963
5047120,5,B0071AD9OQ,"Louie Giglio tells the story of Jesus miraculous birth.  Louie's a very gifted and powerful speaker, and tells the Word of God more personal way. Louie puts into perspective the circumstances in which God came to us, and shows us the character and endless love of God, and the perfect hope found in Jesus Christ.",1331683200,,312,4.672727272727273
5047121,5,B0071AD9OQ,"Again and again, Louie Giglio goes to the heart of a subject.  His presentation is inspiring, thought provoking and genunine as he portrays an understanding of Christ to a lost and dying souls.  What comes from the heart goes to the heart.",1299110400,3,239,4.666666666666667
5047122,5,B0071AD9OQ,"This video is a great teaching about the beginning of Christianity and what it took for our salvation to be bought. It talks about what Joseph and Mary had to go through to deliver baby Jesus, our Savior. The price that was paid for our eternal salvation.",1293753600,10,255,4.446808510638298
5047123,5,B0071AD9OQ,Our women's Bible study group watched this together in our sanctuary.  We were very moved and it touched many our us personally.  It was a good way to begin the Christmas season.,1292025600,6,178,4.53125
5047124,5,B0071AD9OQ,"This is a very inspiring video, as is all of Louis Giglio's video's.  He knows how to capture his audience, keep their attention and cause them to learn and be awed by God.  I recommend this video for youth groups or adult audiences.",1291680000,4,233,4.395348837209302
5047125,5,B0071AD9OQ,"Louie Giglio is a revolution in Biblical presentation. Sound Bible teaching, but such a fresh and hear-able form of delivery, makes this dynamic speaker worth listening to. He presents the same Christ Child story, first from the Bible's own words, ""the Gospel unchanged,"" and then enlarges and expounds on it in the earthy, human, common language way that only Louie Giglio can present. He shares the difference that has been made for man in ""The 12 Words of Christmas"", not the 12 days. He states about the nativity day and location: ""Nothing perfect about that night except the baby came."" And then explains why.

The taping was done at Atlanta, in conjunction with a Chris Tomlin Christmas concert. I believe it was early in the tour for ""Glory in the Highest: Christmas Songs of Worship"", a CD released last year. The tour is continuing now, Christmas, 2010. The DVD runs almost an hour, an all region release, and has a background pianist playing, a shadow in the darker background and uncredited, which I suspect is the music of Tomlin. It adds to the dynamics of Giglio's sharing of ""The Twelve Words of Christmas.""

A great companion to Chris Tomlin's Christmas music CD, but it must be bought separately. This DVD has bonus material: About Louie Giglio; About Passion; More Info on the Passion Talk Series; and a booklet containing discussion questions.

This would be a great DVD to play for upper elementary students through senior worshipers at a church, followed by some of the discussion questions, or small group possibilities. And of course Christmas candy/cookies and assorted soft drinks. THE Christmas message, presented as fresh as it can be done, drawing emotion from the viewer, as well as hope for those needing inspiration. If your wondering what Christmas is all about, it's here in a DVD nutshell. A great stocking stuffer for a youth minister. Or family and friends who really need to hear the story of what the holiday is about. Or the worshiper who desires a fresh reading about the holy family's beginning.

Also, for an amazing presentation on the universe and God's creation, take a look at Louie Giglio in his DVD called ""Indescribable"". It is indescribable, you just have to see it to believe it.",1289779200,19,2230,4.875989445910291
5047126,4,B0071AD9OQ,"Once the message started, it was excellent. Not sure what the opening part of giving a gift to a girl in the audience was supposed to communicate, but it was cute. Louie took the familiar Christmas story and made it come alive talking about the wonder of how it all worked, how God made everything perfectly unexpected. It made me think through the Christmas story with fresh amazement.",1420675200,,386,4.6911764705882355
5047127,5,B0071AD9OQ,"I love Louie Giglio, but when it arrived to its destination it wasn't wrapped and I selected that option.",1418515200,,105,4.578947368421052
5047128,5,B0071AD9OQ,"Louie Giglio has a certain style of presenting the gospel and if you like his other videos then you'll probably like this. If you have a preconceived issue with louie or the gospel, then you probably won't care for this.",1414022400,,220,4.525
5047129,5,B0071AD9OQ,"As always Louie Giglio did it again. He has to get his messages from on high, God because they are so up lifting.",1413763200,,113,3.9565217391304346
5047130,5,B0071AD9OQ,As always Louie is superb. He is my main ministry tool.,1411603200,,55,4.090909090909091
5047131,5,B0071AD9OQ,"I know that I am beginning to sound like a spokesperson for Louie Giglio.  But, let me explain.  Watching Louie's DVDs have put a new fire in my ""belly"" to draw closer to God the Father and Jesus my Savior. During the past nearly eighty years I have had the opportunity to hear some of the best pastors up close and personal.  Louie has the ability to grab my attention immediately and to explain Scriptures in a way that is real, exciting and I don't want the teaching to stop.  I watched The Twelve Words of Christmas DVD a couple of weeks ago and I plan to watch it again and again.  I also bought a copy for each one of my children and grandchildren.  Don't think for a minute that this DVD is only for the Christmas Season.  I highly recommend purchasing this DVD because I am certain you will enjoy watching and sharing it with others.",1411344000,,841,4.284810126582278

5047135,5,B0071AD9OQ,"I have yet to listen to a teaching by him that is not riveting.  He is an anointed teacher, down to earth and practical.  He makes
the Word of God real and touches your heart.",1391385600,,175,3.9714285714285715
5047136,5,B0071AD9OQ,"I enjoyed watching this DVD and was excited to show it to the youth group that I lead because Louie gives a clear, biblical look at what Jesus did for us coming to earth. We as Christians so often focus on what Jesus did for us on the cross (and rightly so), but Jesus made an unimaginable sacrifice in coming to earth to live among us.",1388793600,,336,4.106060606060606
5047137,4,B0071AD9OQ,"Louis is a great communicator. The message is good, maybe a little too long of an introduction. Brings one back to the treasure of Christ's miraculous birth.",1388102400,,157,4.851851851851852
