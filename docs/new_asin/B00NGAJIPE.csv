6649036,2,B00NGAJIPE,"This movie unlike any other holiday movies, is not the kind what you expect. Arguments, something is missing, stuff like that. All thanks to the Lord of the Imps a Christmas fiend who is the one behind all this. A boy named Andy who helps clean Santa's workshop comes to a miniature house that has the Lord of the Imps imprisoned in. He accidentally released him causing havoc in the village. Now that it's up to Andy and his friends to stop the lord of the imps with the help of Santa and Napo the mule to capture the imp back to the miniature house to imprison him. I saw it on Netflix once and I feel like this movie is not really worth of owning it on DVD. If you do not want to see this kind, I say skip this holiday film.",1478822400,,727,4.055555555555555

6649040,1,B00NGAJIPE,"I watched this on netflix and thought it was terrible there voices made me want to scream, I only watched the first 18 minutes of it until I just couldn't take it any longer and it seemed like there was no point to the story at all.

6649048,1,B00NGAJIPE,"Tried watching this animated film with my grandchildren, ages 4 and 6.  They did not like the animation and in fact thought it was, ""scary"".  It was not very appealing and we did not get beyond the first fifteen minutes.  It might have been a good story, we simply did not watch enough of it since it was not appealing at all to my young grandchildren.",1482710400,,352,4.303030303030303

8677911,1,B00NGAJIPE,"My 3 year old wanted to watch a Christmas movie so we sat down as a family to watch Mule-Tied Christmas. Although it held his interest we shut it off after about 20 minutes after hearing the goblin drop an f-bomb. It's not the language I want my young child repeating, especially from a Christmas movie. My husband and I were left highly disappointed. It looks like we'll have to review each Christmas movie for our son before he views it.",1482969600,2,439,4.432098765432099
