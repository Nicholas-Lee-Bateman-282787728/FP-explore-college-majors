If you are a fan of Tosh and are not easily offended, then you will love this.  Beware though, he's got no boundaries!  Nothing is off limits to Tosh in this one.",1460851200,2,356,3.9166666666666665

7564717,5,B0196M7050,"Just watched this on a flight to Seattle. I appreciate Tosh's sense of humor and like his stand up far more than his Comedy Central show. There are some jokes that might make some people squirm, but I found it really entertaining. I'd love to see more stand up from him in the future. You can tell that Daniel is a highly intelligent guy and I think that's part of why his comedy works. His timing has also only gotten better over the years.",1479081600,,441,4.261904761904762

7564761,2,B0196M7050,Not as good as the first two DVDs from Tosh that I have. He seems much more negative and bitter in this special which is a shame because he's so talented. I'd rent it first and see if you like it.,1464566400,,196,3.8048780487804876

I have seen Tosh live, in concert, and laughed nonstop for the entire show.  This hour long special is nearly as good with new material that is really hilarious.  It is not constant laughter, but close.  I have watched it now about 3 or 4 times and still laugh out loud at so many jokes.  His style of comedy just never gets old.

7564767,5,B0196M7050,"This is my second review of Daniel Tosh's stand-up.  I don't think I did Daniel justice in the last review. With this one, I would like to try a different approach...

 He is so funny.  You ever have those moments in your life where your mind takes a sick and twisted view of the crazy stuff that happens to you (you have to laugh at life otherwise you would die of depression), and you start thinking ""wow, if only I could manage to speak about my crazy life in front of an audience, show people the humor in my horrible situation, it could really make a killing at the comedy clubs""?

That is what it's like listening to Daniel Tosh's comedy.  He is the twisted part of yourself who has seen way too much horror in life; the part of yourself that cuts the jokes in your head constantly, just so you don't lose your mind from taking life too seriously.

I watch it, barely able to breathe from laughing so hard, struggling not to pee my pants on my couch, and all the while I am thinking ""He must be a soulmate!  Holy c**p, that is so me!"".

Daniel is so awesomely funny!  It is an art form to be able to find that much humor in so many facets of life.  There are so very few men who can keep me laughing that hard for that long without some help from alcohol.

Thank you",1463788800,3,1272,4.126016260162602
7564768,5,B0196M7050,"Absolutely hilarious.  As noted by another reviewer, this one has a dark side to it but it also makes it funnier than all of the others.  IF you are a fan of Tosh you will love this one.  BUT if you have never heard of Tosh / his show / his other specials than be warned that this might not be for you.  Go to comedy central first and watch and episode or 2. If you find that funny then come back here to watch this one.",1463011200,,420,3.793103448275862

8744196,5,B0196M7050,"I drive two hours per day for work, and I listen to a lot of standup comedy (radio and streaming). I've been a fan of Tosh since about 2008 when ""Completely Serious"" came out (I saw him live during that 'tour'). I believe Tosh is about as ""all-star"" as standup comedy can be right now, with Bill Burr and Anthony Jeselnik tied for second place. While I loved ""Happy Thoughts,"" I did feel it was a step down from ""Completely Serious."" So I went into ""People Pleaser"" with mild expectations.

With ""People Pleaser,"" Tosh is back to form like he was with ""Completely Serious."" Topics like dead Michael Jackson still making billions, the great things 9/11 created for relationships (his comment ""That was worth a tower...NOT TWO"" is about as horrifically awful - and therefore hilarious - as ever), the environmental crisis (which, by the way, his ""cure"" is actually spot-on), and his worst day in traffic, etc. are chock-full of Tosh's trademark awfulness. He even makes jokes out of what people think of him who feel the need to take him seriously (I invite reviews trashing him to listen to that part.. he's a COMEDIAN, and tells JOKES for a living).

If you loved ""Completely Serious,"" don't even hesitate on ""People Pleaser."" It's some of his best work.",1508544000,,1254,4.7214611872146115
8744197,5,B0196M7050,"Absolutely hilarious; there is a stretch of about 15 minutes of flawlessly executed jokes.
