I had a perfect experience with the sellers: correct, polite and patience with me.

But asa i received the CD and DVD i tried to play it and I discovered that the DVD quality is too low and CD might be HQ standards, but I cannot hear any big difference.
I dont' think it is a copy, I'm sure it's original (and it came complitely wrapped and unused!).

So I'm afraid this is a bad item to buy, even if the seller is 100% WOW!",1369180800,,479,3.9791666666666665

I own a bunch of box sets, collections, special releases, etc.  Stuff like Quadrophenia the Director's Cut, Townshend's Lifehouse, Free's Songs of Yesterday, ZZ Top's Chrome Smoke & BBQ, Tull's Cigar Box thing, Iron Maiden's Eddie's Archives, Europe's Live Look At Eden, and many many more...but they all pale in comparison to this set, at least design/lookwise.  It just oozes quality and attention to detail.  It's gorgeous.

But the best news of all - and something that should be helpful to others thinking of getting this, is that the DVDs are REGION 0, aka REGION FREE or REGION ALL, NOT RESTRICTED TO REGION 2 as seems to be claimed on this Amazon listing and elsewhere that I have seen this for sale on the 'net!!!

You do NOT need a ""region free"" player to play the DVDs in this box!  At least not in the set that I got, and from what I can figure out, there was only one printing of this (which has since sold out although it is available still in some stores in Japan or from 3rd party sellers), so I do not believe that I got a set that is region free and that others might be only region 2.

I'm not sure if the DVD format is PAL or NTSC (I suspect they are NTSC) but most players nowadays will play either format & convert that as needed for your TV.

I do not have an ""all region"" player anymore so I was worried that I would not be able to watch these DVDs in my current player (would have had to use my computer which has ""all region"" set drives) but found that was not the case at all.  It even says REGION ALL on the BACK of the packaging for this set.

As far as the content goes the live 2 CD set is great (I love the What If album, think it is their best, so nice to get some live versions of some of those songs).  The booklet is fantastic, a work of art in a way.  And I haven't even had time to watch the two DVDs other than to check that they do play AOK in my setup.

Can't recommend this set highly enough for other Mr. Big fans, worth every penny.",1361750400,2,1994,4.113695090439276
