2127179,4,B0002VKLQK,"This collection of ORIGINAL Gumby films from the 1950s & 60s totals 8 episodes, one of which is Art Clokey's Fantasia influenced ""GUMBASIA""! Yes, it's under 4 minutes long, but I have looked high & low for THIS film for years, and here it is on a very economical DVD.

There was much disappointment with that lousy collection Rhino Video released [don't get me wrong, ""RHINO"" is a GREAT company!] but the Gumby DVDs they released have that yeechy boring 1980s re-made music in all the episodes.

The fact was, was the original MUSIC LIBRARY CUES the films used [made up of ""CAPITOL HI-Q"" ""CINEMUSIC"" ""EMI PHOTOPLAY"" & ""SYNCHRO""!] was & since has become a muddled affair, even WITHIN the 'production music library' business!

So Art Clokey did a 'smart business move' by RE-CREATING his OWN music for the films that HE would own......unfortunately, Art, we love you too, but you ruined our 'childhood memories' of ""Gumby"" by doing that.

People will tell me ""aww, get a life!"" when reading this, but I'm obviously not the only one who's been burned by savvy, sneaky revampings of 'things we liked in our childhood'. Art says he'll eventually get them ALL re-released again someday, with the ORIGINAL music. Well, us fans of vintage audio & video don't know WHO to trust anymore [i.e. the removal of Frank Comstock's ORIGINAL music from the ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"" DVD re-issues! Criminey! What ELSE has secretly been destroyed?] [:-)]

Anyway, you can't lose by buying THIS DVD. The original William Loose [& friends] music is THERE. Some of the prints have scratches, but Art, we'll enjoy these off-beat releases until you can get things straightened out with the library music care-takers [good luck!]",1097107200,10,1699,4.905923344947735
2127180,4,B0002VKLQK,"This DVD is the best bargain of the year: 8 original episodes with the ORIGINAL SOUND--not the horrible redub and synth soundtrack found in the Rhino edition.  There are only 8 episodes, but the selection is a good one--Stuck On Books and Robot Rumpus being the highlights. Sounds OK and looks OK-nothing spectacular, but then again look at the price you're paying for these.

This is labeled as volume 1--we can only hope volumes 2,3,4 etc quickly follow.",1096156800,5,456,4.833333333333333

8033260,5,B0002VKLQK,"I took a chance on this one and was greatly surprised to see the cartoons I remember from long ago. This is the whole collection of Mr Piper stories,and the only way to get any of these on DVD.
This Mr Piper guy is cool. The stories haves witches,giants,magic trees,ants,fish,and birds that talk to humans,snotty queens,princesses galore,and all done for children to watch and expand on their imagination. Oh yes,they are fables with morals at the end as told by Mr Piper!
It is not like Spongebob or any of the new so called cartoons w/ adult humor.
These 1960s toons are very well done and there are 2 very funny cartoons at the end that I love to watch because the animation is great and you can't find them anywhere else!
Elves driving carts pulled by grasshoppers....too cool...buy it",1257206400,2,789,4.642857142857143
8033261,1,B0002VKLQK,"If you recall Gumby fondly from your childhood like I do, pass on this collection, which will besmirch his memory.  It's a slapdash affair, poorly put together, featuring a wildly inconsistent set of episodes the inclusion for which there appears to be no discernible rhyme or reason.",1166918400,3,284,5.042553191489362
8033262,4,B0002VKLQK,"Gumby, that little piece of green clay created by the master of claymation, Art Clokey, celebrates his 50th year in 2005.  Clokey, who started his craft in advertising with commercials for Budweiser and Coca Cola, pioneered this stop motion animation process also known as ""pixillation"". In his spare time, Clokey made the fantastic ""Gumbasia"", which led to the birth of Gumby and his friends, Pokey the horse, Too and Loo the musical notes, and Nopey, a dog that can only say ""no"".

Claymation is very inventive in the hands of Clokey and his head animators Ray Peck and Pete Kleinow; we get to see the abstract ""Gumbasia"" in this collection, as well as 4 from 1957 (Gumby voice by Dallas McKennon), and 3 from 1967 (voice by Dick Beals).

Total running time is 60 minutes.

Episode list:

1: ""Gumby Concerto"" (1957), Gumby visits Musicland with Too and Loo, plays ""Chopsticks"" on the piano and makes rhythms with percussive instruments.

2: ""Gumbasia"" (1953), the abstract masterpiece that started it all, which is only 3  minutes long, but brilliant, and riveting for animation fans.

3: ""Robot Rumpus"" (1957), Gumby and Pokey leave the work to robots, with some dire results.

4:  ""Too Loo"" (1957), Too and Loo escape from Mr. Sour Note, and Gumby helps them find their home in Musicland.

5: ""Gold Rush Gumby"" (1967), Gumby, Pokey, and Nopey prospect for gold.

6: ""Mysterious Fires"" (1957), Sir Gumby reasons with a fire breathing dragon, and saves a starving populace.

7: ""Stuck on Books"" (1967), Nopey gets stuck in a book, and is rescued by Gumby and Pokey.

8: ""Tricky Train"" (1967), Gumby gets a big shipment of toy trains, and Nopey gets to chase them.",1116115200,8,1665,4.816901408450704
8033263,4,B0002VKLQK,"Ah yes, Gumby, the green clay boy that sprang from the imagination of Art Clokey. Sometimes Gumby's adventures served as metaphor, sometimes they were just whimsical, always, they were surreal and divine. The cartoons shown here are all in the public domain which accounts for the grainy look and sometimes shaky audio. Public domain means that the copyright has expired on these and Mr. Clokey doesn't get any royalties on these until he re-applies for their copyright. That said, it's nice to see these in their unaltered form. The Rhino collection has apparently been released with a disappointing audio track. Art Clokey and his son Joe are currently re-marketing Gumby and Davey and Goliath. Do a web search and you'll find all that you need to know about all that is Gumby. Art Clokey was and is a visionary, let's hope that he and his son can continue that magic.

As far as the packaging is concerned, the cardboard slipcase can be easily replaced with the packaging that arrives in your mail from AOL. Just throw away the AOL cd-rom, and slip out the AOL packaging. Cut the Gumby packaging to fit and you're all set.",1108425600,,1125,4.739795918367347
8033264,3,B0002VKLQK,"Yes, I bought the big Rhino set, and while my baby loves it, I really missed the original theme song. And something about that set just bugged me while I was watching it, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Then I read the reviews here and a big ""aha!"" went off: it was the music and voices! What a shame they redid all that. This little 8-episode DVD sampler is nothing to write home about, but it did give me a chance to see the episodes the way I remembered, with the original sound and voices.

The good:

-You can hear the original Gumby theme song, snuck in after the episode ""Mysterious Fires.""

-Original music and voices (so much more melodious than the grating voices that grace the Rhino collection).

-Two episodes that don't appear on the Rhino collection: Stuck on Books and Gold Rush Gumby.

The bad:

-No ""play all"" selection: you have to scroll to each episode separately to play. That's inconvenient.

-Really terrible picture quality.",1107907200,13,953,4.570588235294117
8033265,4,B0002VKLQK,"Well, you coul call this DVD ""Cheap"". Yet, look how much it is! It's a great price. The audio is the same. It has 8 episdoes, and is 40 minutes long. It also has ""Gumbasia"" on it. But I think it shoul of came in a plastic case, not a piece of paper! But this DVD is worth about 4 stars (which is what I rated)",1103328000,,309,3.696969696969697
8033266,4,B0002VKLQK,"I was thrilled to be able to share Gumby with my babies. They're the same age I was the first time I saw it (age 3 - maybe I was a little younger) Anyway, they love this DVD and so did I. There are only a couple of things I would add. A plastic case, (although I'm sure I can find one at the store) More of the opening song, (It's snuck in only once, at the end of ""Mysterious Fires"") and I'd love to see some special ""behind the scenes"" features (and I'd be HAPPY to pay extra for that, haha!). This was an unbelievable deal for the joy it brought to my little family, and I hope to see more episodes in the future.",1102896000,2,616,3.8968253968253967
