I have purchased this movie only because I adore Christian Slater & Brian Bloom, but wish the ending was different.  I would suggest renting it before buying it.",1107734400,,307,4.446428571428571
1233973,2,B00000JKXS,"This video is based loosely on a true story of young love and obsession gone horribly wrong and ending in murder.  The subject matter involves a young lady (Tammy Lauren) ""desperately"" trying to win the  affections of a young man who is only mildly interested in her, and the  consequences of her using his best friend (Christian Slater) to attract his  attention.  Christian Slater's character has been in love with the young  lady for sometime, and the misplaced affection he receives brings the  situation to a horrible end.  This film had a lot of conversational drama  and very little action.  Fans of Tammy Lauren and Christian Slater are  probably going to want to own this film out of a since of completism,  because both young people have considerable camera time.  As a huge fan of  Tammy Lauren myself, it pains me to see her talents wasted in this movie,  but her ability to come off as real and true to the character she plays  still stands out in the performance.",962323200,6,977,4.658823529411765

7912477,4,B00000JKXS,"Certainly not an up-lifting movie. This depressing story, based on someone's real life is a good movie for fans of Christian Slater (especially when he was younger), but otherwise, I wouldn't bother.",1400284800,,199,5.25
7912478,5,B00000JKXS,"Movies based upon true stories are often the most thrilling ones of all.  ""Desperate for Love"" is a film about a rural small town in Georgia.  Lily Becker, (Tammy Lauren), loves Alex, the high school football star and musician, one of the popular students.  Cliff Petry, (Christian Slater), is Lily's childhood friend and one of the unpopular kids.  He is also Alex's friend.  These three teenagers' become embroiled in a triangle of passion, lust, and obsession that results in tragedy.  When Alex's parents forbid him to continue his relationship with Lily, the manipulative ""woman scorned"" turns her attentions onto Cliff, using his love for her and her seductive beauty to win Alex back.

My plot overview might put the viewer in mind of a ""Fatal Attraction"" scenario, but this film has much more depth than your average ""femme fatale"" movie.  All the characters are multi-faceted, particularly Lauren and Slater's characters.  Lily Becker is manipulative, but the viewer catches revealing glimpses of a tumultuous family life that might provide a reason, (if not an excuse), for her actions.  Cliff is portrayed as a young man seeking to discover his identity and the reason for his father's desertion of his mother.  These two teenagers are sympathetically drawn.

Both Tammy Lauren and Christian Slater turn in engaging performances, and the other performers are equally good.  Please give this movie a chance.  God bless you all.",1277856000,,1437,5.137931034482759
7912479,4,B00000JKXS,"Desperate for Love, in my opinion, was fantastic. The quality is really crappy but the acting and the story were great. The ending is surprising, which is something you don't see in most movies. You feel for all of the characters. I really liked it. I love Christian Slater. I bought the movie before I saw it and when it started, I thought ""oh no what did I buy? This is going to be terrible."" It ended up being one of my favorites.",1194825600,2,433,4.228915662650603
7912480,5,B00000JKXS,"My wife fell asleep on the last 20 minutes of this TV movie - so I picked it up for a couple bucks. It didn't tie things together enough for me, but for her, well she thought it was pretty good.",1168473600,,194,3.7560975609756095
