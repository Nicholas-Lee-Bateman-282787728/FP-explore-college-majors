2894924,5,B000T4T954,"Corner Gas is a situational comedy show from Canada.  We accidently discovered it when it showed up in our TiVo suggestions.  After watching several episodes, we found this show to be funny, witty and family friendly.  In our time zone, WGN America broadcasts the show on Tuesday, prior to 6 am.  So many folks have yet to discover it.

Corner Gas is a local gas station and mini-mart located in the fictional town of  Dog River, Saskatchewan.

Attached to the gas station is a diner.  Eight main characters relate the issues of their lives in humorous stand-alone episodes.

Corner Gas, a production of CTV, Canada recently completed their sixth season (107 episodes).  Due to the show's high popularity in Canada, DVDs of the first four seasons have been produced.

If you have watched every episode of ""Everyone loves Raymond"" and Seinfeld and are looking for something fresh, check out Corner Gas",1240099200,2,900,4.894039735099338

This show isn't for everyone, but if you like shows such as Scrubs, Seinfeld, and the like you will enjoy Corner Gas.",1235952000,,436,4.166666666666667
2894926,5,B000T4T954,My purchase of this DVD set went without a hitch.  I received the set very quickly and it was in excellent condition.  I love the show and will shop for other Corner Gas DVD sets at Amazon.,1233273600,,189,4.081081081081081
2894927,5,B000T4T954,"Season Four continues to build on the fine comedy traditions now firmly established by the first three seasons.  The quality of the humor and of how the episodes flow continues to be consistently high.

The name's Butt--Brent Butt, part of Her Majesty's Secret Service Stations!  This ""007"" theme, like Season Three's cartoon theme, is strictly a marketing/package art thing and has nothing to do with the show itself.  It's cute, and mildly entertaining--BUT with a serious flaw.  In carrying the 007 gadget theme into the DVD menus they have created something entertaining for about the first 3 times you attempt to pick an episode.  After that it becomes cumbersome to navigate--PAINFULLY cumbersome at times.  However, it is a testament to the show's writing that this DVD menu problem is the biggest criticism.  Once you GET TO the episodes, you enjoy the same great Corner Gas personalities and high humor quality one comes to expect from this show.

Other knocks continue to be the now trademark use of ""Jack@$$!"" by a main character (Brent's father, Oscar), and the fact that Lacey's blouses continue to be a bit too revealing for modesty's sake.  However, this is overall a consistently clean show, given these two caveats.  (BTW, I recognize the humor in the use of Oscar's trademark expletive.  However, this paragraph is to advise on the crudity/impurity content of the show for those who are so concerned, so I do mention it here.)

One thing that had to be pointed out to me as an American watching the show.  The last names of the characters in the show are all the names of towns in Saskatchewan.  This homage of Corner Gas's creator for his native province is a characteristic example of what makes his comedy so great.  He is able to laugh WITH (and not just at) the small town foibles which he mines so eloquently for the shows humor, because it is the SELF-deprecating humor of one who has love and respect for his roots--not the condescension of an outsider.  The frequent use of Canadian celebrities in cameos of the show continues to entertain, even if I have to have explained to me who some of them are.

I highly recommend this DVD, despite the cumbersome menu flaw.  The quality of the show itself IS worth it. (Although I do hope that subsequent seasons will revert to an easier to use menu format.)  I eagerly await the release of the Season 5 of Corner Gas on DVD and intend to order it as soon as it is released.  (I also sincerely wish that WGN would air current episodes instead of confining itself to reruns, which they do as of this writing.)",1207872000,,2577,4.694877505567929

This is a Canadian T.V. sitcom created by Canadian comedian Brent Butt (Yes! That's his real name).  The series ran for six seasons from Jan 22, 2004 to April 13, 2009 for a total of 107 episodes.

Deriving its name from the roadside gas station in the fictional small (very small!) town of Dog River, Saskatchewan, Canada, ""Corner Gas"" is the only gas station within 37 miles (60 km) in any direction.

The characters of this small town are quirky:

Brent Leroy (Brent Butt) is the proprietor of the gas station.  His parents, Oscar (Eric Peterson) whose favorite word is ""jackass"" and Emma (Janet Wright) are life-time residents of Dog River.

Wanda Dollard (Nancy Robertson) works at the station's convenience store as a retail assistant.

An adjoining cafe, The Ruby, is owned by Lacey Burrows (Gabrielle Miller), who inherited it from her Aunt Ruby.

Dog River's Police Department (the ""DRPD"") consists entirely of veteran Davis Quinton (Lorne Cardinal) and rookie Karen Pelly (Tara Spencer-Nairn).

Brent's best friend, the perpetually unemployed Hank Yarbo (Fred Ewanuick) spends his time hanging out with Dog River residents or drinking coffee at the Ruby.

A number of notable Canadian celebrities and politicians appear as guest stars or have cameo roles in many episodes.

Most of the episodes are stand-alone and can be viewed in any order.

This very funny show, which was filmed entirely in Saskatchewan, became an instant hit, averaging a million viewers per episode.  In Saskatchewan, April 13 is known as ""Corner Gas Day.""  This show is presently televised in 26 countries.

I found that season four of Corner Gas retained its quirky characters but some episodes did not retain the humour I've come to expect.  Prime Minister Stephen Harper has a cameo in the very last episode of this season.

Finally, there are two extras with this DVD (released in 2007): (1) bloopers (2) ""mobisodes.""  These are quite good.

In conclusion, the fourth season of the hit comedy ""Corner Gas"" presents more episodes in the life of a small town where there's ""not a lot goin' on.""

Warning!!  Once you become addicted to this series, you officially become a ""Butt head.""

(2006-2007;  19 episodes on 3 discs;  22 min per episode; total time: 418 min or almost 7 hrs;  wide screen)

Season Four continues with the spirit of the earlier episodes, delivering a show that's good natured, not afraid to be goofy (and it's funnier for it) with a likeable group of characters who are just good fun to watch.

On paper, the premise of the people of Dog River, a small town in Saskatchewan, Canada,  creating big dramas for themselves by blowing little everyday things out of all proportion sounds like a concept that would get old very quickly. However, the inventiveness of the writers combined with the quirks of the characters makes 'Corner Gas' a show you'll want to come back to again and again.

2894978,2,B000T4T954,"Season 4 has some of the best episodes of the entire Corner Gas series.  The episodes really deserve a 5 star rating instead of the 2 stars I give this DVD.

The problem is the DVD's skip and quit playing in all but brand new DVD players.  I had to return my first copy, all three disks had problems.  My second copy will only play completely in one DVD player for me.  The other five seasons of Corner Gas all play much much better than season 4 does.  It's a shame because I like season 4 a lot.  The season 4 DVD really should be re-issued in a better playing format, then it would be worth 5 stars.

Run time is labeled approx. 435 minutes, or 7 hours and 15 minutes.  It's all very funny material, the DVDs just don't play very well.
