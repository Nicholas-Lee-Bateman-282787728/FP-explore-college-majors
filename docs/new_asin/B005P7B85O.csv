4856441,5,B005P7B85O,"This is a very insightful DVD from a guy who started his career as an atheist and evolutionist and became a creationist after discovering the overwhelming evidence that the Solar System was created by an intelligent designer (aka God).

He discusses each planet's uniqueness and attributes, highlighting errors in the evolutionist model in how each planet came into being. He uses quotes from a variety of sources, many who say they really can't explain how some planets exist, especially Uranus and Neptune. As more data is collected from the technology that has been in space, the evidence continues to tear down the argument that the Solar System spontaneously developed.

I learned a lot from this DVD. It's pretty sad that most people are kept in the dark about these new discoveries. Too bad that evolution (or the astronomy version of evolution) is taught as fact, instead of a theory that has many unknowns- especially as new discoveries weaken it.",1338163200,11,956,5.0062893081761
4856442,1,B005P7B85O,"Umm, I hate to break it to you, but Evolution isn't the Theory that covers how the Solar System was made.

Please, at least get your Theories straight before you waste our time.",1335657600,4,177,4.363636363636363
4856443,5,B005P7B85O,This DVD is absolutely amazon. The information presented along with the visuals are just wonderful.  It is very informative as well as eye opening. A must see!,1331683200,6,159,4.888888888888889
4856444,5,B005P7B85O,"Regardless of where you stand on the issue of cosmogony, this video poses thought provoking questions about our solar system. The photos and graphs used in the presentation are outstanding.",1327363200,6,189,5.333333333333333
4856445,5,B005P7B85O,"I gave 5 stars because mainstream astronomers avoid talking about the problems associated with planet formation and their peculiarities. With humor, Psarris reveals the usual explanation for many of the problems. The usual explanation is an asteroid came along and did this or that to produce planet x, moon y or geological feature z. Whenever something in our solar system cant be explained by the laws of physics, the passing or colliding asteroid is often employed to provide a remotely plausible explanation for everything from retrograde orbits to whatever peculiarity is observed.

I liked Psarris willingness to oppose standard explanations that really don't explain. As a creationist, he is committed to a biblically-based solution to astronomical problems.

Because Psarris was an engineer in the United States military space program and has done graduate studies in physics, he has some familiarity with planetology. I would recommend this DVD to astronomers who are not satisfied with the standard explanations and want to hear alternative explanations that are more satisfying. Also, the general public can benefit from watching this DVD because all they ever hear is the ad hoc explanations for the many peculiarities resident in our solar systems planets and moons.",1398038400,4,1279,5.422110552763819
4856446,4,B005P7B85O,"It appears this (Vol 1) is ""out of print"" presently and I was only able to find one source that happened to have a couple copies left. I wanted Vol 1 because I had previously watched Vol 2 (readily available) and wanted the complete set. Both volumes contain useful information and are a valuable addition to a library of DVDs. Even if you are unable to obtain Vol 1 I'd still recommend Vol 2. Both of these point out the huge gaping holes in the theories of evolution from the astronomy perspective.",1390953600,2,500,4.445652173913044
4856447,5,B005P7B85O,Makes a strong case for creationism. If you want to know the shortcomings of solar evolution this dvd will help.,1379548800,3,112,4.65
4856448,5,B005P7B85O,A lot of very intriguing questions are asked in here. questions I have been asking. Some were answered. Some were promised to be answered in the next volume. I watched it over and over. Besides the astronomy photos from NASA are breathtaking too!,1374278400,4,246,4.744186046511628
4856449,5,B005P7B85O,"To quote the NASA website, ""There are many questions associated with the creation and evolution of the major constituents of the cosmos."" Many scientific publications refer to the ""Evolution"" of the universe and cosmos. While I agree that the term ""Evolution"" was first applied to biology, the term has been appropriated by many Big Bang theorists to describe how the cosmos came into being and is still being formed. To the reviewer who criticized the use of ""Evolution"" as applied to the theory of existence of the cosmos: The term ""Evolution"" has been used for over 40 years to describe the development of the universe/cosmos by Big Bang theorists. YOU should get your nomenclature straight. This DVD is excellent and unassailable. If you had bothered to see this DVD before you criticized the use of terminology, you would know that Mr. Psarris, the narrator, explains how he uses the term ""Evolution"" to describe development of the cosmos. He does so because the use of the term ""Evolution"", in this way, has become normative in the Big Bang scientific literature, including Big Bang textbok titles, as he shows in the DVD.

Mr. Psarris did a magnificent job in this DVD. I highly recommend it. No inaccuracies or sloppy terminology in this DVD. It is up to date, as of its publication, which is more than I can say for the reviewer who criticized the use of the term , ""Evolution"".",1369612800,6,1387,4.803347280334728
4856450,5,B005P7B85O,"My son and I enjoyed this video, as did several of his friends. The video is factual and well-presented. You'll learn a lot about our solar system from watching it. The author's sense of humor in showing how often asteroid impact theories come to the rescue provides some comedic relief that is especially enjoyed by younger viewers.

The video is long -- almost two hours. However, you can easily choose an amount of content to fit whatever time slot is available, because the material is organized into one capsule per planet (or other object). The DVD menu makes it easy to pop in the DVD and select a specific planet or object to learn about. This is a good feature for watching with kids, because you need only 15 spare minutes, and that's a short enough period that most kids will pay attention for that long.

Finally, I will comment that the presenter backs up what he says with references to the scientific literature. My son is a high-school junior with a strong interest in science, especially physics. He is keen on supporting references, and comments favorably upon this DVD for having them.",1359417600,8,1104,4.715025906735751
4856451,5,B005P7B85O,"I am an engineer at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and I was so impressed with the scientific and presentation quality that I ordered 4 more copies. This video is so professionally done that children through adults will enjoy learning how our solar system was formed. I have watched it at least 5 times. Out of the hundreds of DVDs and books I have on these subjects, this is the best astronomy DVD I have seen. My wife just watched it with me and she now wants to send a copy to our three grandkids in Michigan for their school work (7, 8, 9 years old). She is homeschooling our grandkids remotely from Florida.

A link to this DVD needs to be added to the MiraculousBible.org website (The site answers: What would prove that the Bible is a miracle? Or what would be considered as evidence it could only be from God? Videos like this one are one of the many proofs.). I have discussed evolution's many theories with many scientists at KSC. They want proof (scientific, historical, mathematical, logical, etc.) that the Bible is a reliable book. This video provides some of those proofs for the Bible and shows you some of the miracles required for evolution (solar system formation).

Evolutionists hide the many miracles that would be required if evolution was true. But scientists and engineers like this (DVD's Spike Psarris) will be attacked from every corner of the educational & media establishment because the evidence shown in the DVD is so compelling that anyone can understand that evolutionists are hiding evolution's miracles.

Scientists (& truth seekers) are supposed to follow the evidence, not popular opinion or emotional arguments. So notice the arguments made against this DVD. Notice their emotions and appeal to majority opinions. Then examine the evidences for yourself. Stop letting your family be led as sheep to the slaughter. The evidence speaks for itself. Again, see MiraculousBible.org or ApologeticsPress.org for even more proofs.

Which miracles will you believe in? I will believe in the miracles that have the evidences to back them up.",1359158400,8,2066,4.945244956772334

4856453,5,B005P7B85O,"It is at first disconcerting, but also refreshingly liberating, to discover we've been lied to all these years, and to finally learn the truth.  Quoting swept-under-the-rug confessions in textbooks and scientific journals, Spike Psarris shows the standard explanations for how the Sun and planets came into existence all by themselves, without any help from a Creator, simply don't fit the data.",1356048000,6,395,5.475409836065574
4856454,5,B005P7B85O,"An extremely well done and up-to-date video narrated by a former NASA scientist. He explains complicated concepts in understandable terms to non-scientists. As the title states, there is a lot of misinformation in the media today about how the planets are formed. After seeing this video you will see the giant holes in many of the current theories, big bang and such, and probably won't enjoy watching the Nova series as much. As an electrical engineer I appreciated the balanced approach to this topic backing things up with documented quotes from scientific literature. Regardless if you believe in creation or not, it's important to become informed on the current state of scientific thinking is on this important topic.",1347494400,15,724,5.1440677966101696
8482353,5,B005P7B85O,Excellent material to counter evolutionists. Hard not to be upset at the total black-out of teaching creation based science in our schools. The production values aren't the best(it gets better in vol. 2/3) but not a distraction from the actual material itself.  Very well narrated. I own all 3 volumes. Can't wait for more to be released.,1511136000,,338,4.9298245614035086

8482356,5,B005P7B85O,This is a very interesting watch. It is well done with a lot of the best back ground I have seen. I want to see volume two now that I have seen this volume.

8482360,5,B005P7B85O,"This film exposes just how much modern scientists do not know about our solar system. So much of what is taught as scientific fact is revealed to be fairy tales that would make Mother Goose roll her eyes. Modern scientists try to explain the origin of planets and moons using mythical events and objects which, ironically, do not actually explain anything. In one sense, it's so far fetched that it's comical. But in another sense, it's tragic because schools teach solar mythology as established fact.

Spike Psarris uses quotes from respected, peer-reviewed scientific journals to make his case. Every quote is provided with a reference so you can see for yourself that the quotes are not taken out of context.",1430784000,,712,4.933333333333334

8482362,5,B005P7B85O,"Spike Psarris was an engineer in the US military space program and was an atheist and evolutionist.  That was my first ""intrigue"" at the potential for a well-rounded presentation.  I am not a fan when creationists bash evolutionists or portray them as idiots no differently than I am not a fan when evolutionists bash creationists or portray them as idiots.  Spike does a great job of simply stating the evolutionary theories that try to explain our solar system and how they simply fall short.  Afterall, this was enough to change his stance from atheist and evolutionist to believer in the validity/truth of the bible and creationist.  The imagery is breathtaking.  My six and seven year old love watching it for its visual impact while my in-home bible-study group loved watching it because of its thorough and in-depth look at the theories that should explain the baffling facts about these planets but cannot.  Bottom line being that while creationism is banned from the educational system under the ""freedom from religion"" act, this video begs to ask if we should be lobbying that evolution be banned from the educational system for this same reason... both theories require a whole lot of ""faith"".  And Spike does a great job, using scientific evidence, to show which theory best matches these giants in the sky and the unique ways in which they operate.  As an aside, one fact that I marveled at is that Earth is the only planet with a moon that is 400X smaller than the sun but 400X the distance leaving us to be the one and only planet in our solar system with the privilege of perfect eclipses... another testament to a Creator who said ""I have made the sun, moon and stars to be for SIGNS and for seasons.""",1413936000,2,1718,4.719063545150502
