8522557,1,B007WE6QS2,I purchased this dvd twice! The movie Vision Of Terror would not play on either disc. The maker of this disc needs to check the product before selling it!,1433116800,2,154,4.344827586206897
8522558,1,B007WE6QS2,The movies were good. The two I was able to watch.  The main movie I wanted to see with Barbara Eden would not show.,1421798400,4,116,3.8333333333333335
8522559,1,B007WE6QS2,"I received this the same time as my other movie, the problem here though is that the movie content seemed to be fine if I could have seen all of it. The packaged came cracked in three areas the top the bottom and the side it seemed as though the case was very old. I decided to see the movies any way. The movie had four movies but I was only able to see three. The Vision of terror did not show  and Thompson last run showed twice. It is a pity I really could have enjoyed the movies if I was able to see all the content. buy again very questionable, no",1419811200,5,554,3.9026548672566372
8522560,1,B007WE6QS2,"I hope this has been pulled.  There were problems viewing the CD.  Amazon replaced the CD free of charge, but the replacement  sent had the same issues.  Too bad as I think the episodes would have been enjoyable.  I actually made it through 95% of the one staring Robert Mitchum.",1412294400,7,279,4.5
