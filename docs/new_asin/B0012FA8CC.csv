3088895,5,B0012FA8CC,"I finally gave into temptation and bought The Dante's Cove Guilty Pleasure Pack despite already owning and having watched all three seasons.

I really wanted to see The Lost Pilot which as it turns out should have stayed lost.

The only good thing about The Lost Pilot is that it shows the importance of proper casting.

In the pilot Jill Bennett was cast as Grace sadly she could not produce the right level or type of venom needed for the part.

Most of the rest of the pilot was also totally miscast.

The original Toby had all the appeal of cold oatmeal and the other actors were totally wooden it was like a bad production done by a high school drama club.

The saving forces of the pilot were William Gregory Lee and Gregory Michael.

William Gregory Lee had the part of Ambrosius nailed at the audition.

His audition was an extra feature on the pilot and he was instantly believable as the tormented Ambrosius.

In Season One we were introduced to the history of Dante's Cove and we got to know the characters and their individual stories.

We got to watch as Kevin and Toby struggled to build a relationship and leave their individual baggage behind while dealing with doubts and the magical mess that surrounded them.

In Season Two we got to watch as their relationship struggled due to doubts,temptation and manipulation.

In Season Three we watched as Kevin learned magic in an attempt to release himself from Ambrosius while he struggled with the feelings he was developing for him.

We also got to watch Toby dealing with his knowledge of and dislike of Ambrosius while moving on with his life because he believed Kevin was happy.

Returning in season 3 was Jill Bennett.

She was wonderful in the dual role of Michelle confused innocent who was clueless to what was going on around her and the agent of malice for The House of Shadows.

Over the course of 3 seasons it was wonderful to watch several of the characters grow and mature.

I watched as Ambrosius was released from his prison and began stalking Kevin and professing love simply because he believed they were destined to be together.

The irony was that because of his past in which he had to repress his sexuality he had no concept of what love truly is.

He slowly became a man who knew that simply possessing somebody was not love and that if you truly love somebody you must give them the time and freedom to explore their own path and return to you if love is true and shared.

I also enjoyed watching Grace go from being a woman/child who had been mislead, manipulated and emotionally abused to serve the needs and ideas of her mother into a fully matured woman who was finally able to see and except true love.

Both She and Ambrosius were also able to see that their fight was a result of manipulation,half truths,useless grudges and a total waste of both their energies.

The most interesting character change was in Adam.

He went from a sexually confused trust fund kid who was hiding his pain in drugs and alcohol to a man who knew his attraction to and love for his friend Toby was worth giving up his claim to family money.

He learned that nothing could ever make him as happy as sharing his life and love with Toby.",1213574400,22,3208,4.529513888888889
3088896,5,B0012FA8CC,I Loved Season 3 of Dante's Cove Finally Kevin And Ambrosius are together this season is great i love the season finale i hope there is a season 4 cause i want to know what happens to toby and adam and Diana i Hope they Bring back everyone and i want to know what happens to kevin I love Dante's Cove keep The seasons going,1212796800,3,323,3.9846153846153847
3088897,5,B0012FA8CC,"WARNING!! SOME SPOILERS!!

I absolutly loved this season!! I admit i was a bit apprehensive when i discovered Van (Nadine Heiman) wasn't going to be in this season after her crucial role in season 2 and actually the whole series, but with the addition of the newest cast members, this season ranks as the best yet in my opinion. I was extremely pleased that Michelle Wolf (Britt) was a main cast member this season. She is awsome!! I also really enjoyed Jill Bennett taking over the role of Michelle, not that i didn't like Erin Cummings, it was the fact Jill brought a more deeper, even darker dimension to the character. I also was extremely pleased Thea Gill (Diana) returned. She takes on a greater role this season, very very well done. Despite Van not returning, the writers did come up with a clever way to explain her absence while still keeping the season opener continuing from the end of the second season. So i would definatly say that fans won't be disappointed, this season is even more sexier and darker than the two previous seasons with many surprising twists and turns leading up to a stunning finale. I was on the edge of my seat the entire season!!!",1203897600,48,1169,4.5933014354066986

3088910,3,B0012FA8CC,"I loved how Season 2 played out with Kevin being taken by Ambrosious and Adam and Toby having some serious chemistry. I looked forward to Season 3 , but found it disappointing on many levels. The addition of Jensen Atwood as Griffin is a plus and Grace (Tracy Scoggins) is given a little more depth this season. But newcomers Jenny Shimazu and (especially) Reichen Lemkuhl are awful. Poor Reichen does nothing but parade around shirtless (but never removing his Rolex) and manages to be slimy more than sexy. Jon Fleming's Adam is dumb but smokin' hot and he and Toby (Charlie David) make a better couple than Toby and Kevin (Gregory Michael). Thea Gill is just plain annoying as Diana and her character's part in the ""Shadows"" plot is needless. But the Season is saved by the storyline of Ambrosious (William Gregory Lee) and Kevin. Mr. Lee does a great job in allowing Ambrosious some softness and his unrequited love for Kevin is sweet and affecting. Mr. Michael continues to be the best Actor here - his  soft and sensitive Kevin is the perfect foil for Ambrosious and the more Kevin tries to leave ""Bro,"" the more he is drawn to him.",1385596800,,1138,4.633663366336633

3088929,2,B0012FA8CC,"I'll admit, I only bought this because I like looking at Reichen, but this was the first supernatural series I've ever seen so I gave it a try. I've owned this title for 24 hours and I already am selling it back on Amazon. I honestly gave it two stars because all the men look incredibly hot (lets face it!), there's tons of T&A, and they filmed it in ultra gorgeous Hawaii. But that's where it ends. Elementary school plays have better plot lines and scripts than this show. They couldn't even get the T&A scenes correct. The production in its entirety is really a hot mess from beginning to end.

Its sad on two fronts:

1. Even though the cast aren't A-list actors, these are intelligent people. To have intelligent people do stupid plots and recite kindergarten scripts is always a crime.

2. If they actually developed a plot line and good script this could've actually been a really good show. Even with all the muscles and everything else showing, there was a fantastic opportunity for this show to create something never seen on TV.

3088933,1,B0012FA8CC,"I borrowed these DVD sets from a friend.  He thought I might like them since he knows I was a ""Dark Shadows"" fan from a long way back and have a high appreciation for campy and cheesy ""bad"" movies and television.  But even I have my limits.

Even making allowances for low budget, which I happily do, I found this show filled with nothing but the most two-dimensional rotten actors and actresses I have ever seen, not to mention the gratuitous sexuality in the ""Lair"" episodes which I found off-putting, even unconvincingly annoying. I found myself thinking that this was nothing but schlock ""A grade"" pornography.  And the attempt to create a kind of neo-gothic atmosphere is impossible when the furniture is more interesting than the dialogue.  I mean, how on earth can one make magic and vampires dull?  And again, the acting!  Ye gods.  I have been to livlier funerals.  It is pretty plain that the casting call pretty much consisted of taking off shirts, waxing, and raising eyebrows to reflect every emotion.

And then I thought I was perhaps being too harsh, and might be able to enjoy some ""camp"" value if I fast-forwarded through the sex scenes.  And, just no.  It's not funny, its not ""so bad it's funny.""  It's just - bad.

If you like gay porn, beefcake calendars, and Jenna Jameson physiques, ""Dante's Cove"" is for you.  Otherwise, spend some time in ""Dante's Inferno.""  It's less of a torture.

No recommendation.  I mean, good grief.",1261180800,4,1448,4.724

3088937,5,B0012FA8CC,"""Season 1"" I struggled through (and it was the shortest).  Season 2 was an improvement but Season 3 moves everything forward in the right direction.

The characters become more complex this season.  You have good guys dabbling with vengeance betrayal and bad guys making sacrifices for the greater good.

The witches are out of the broom closet this season so the plot has moved from a ""There's something spooky going on around here"" tale to something more interesting.

Tracy Scoggins and Thea Gill are faboo... especially Tracy - I really love her humorous moments and she looks stunning.

The sex scenes are a little shorter.  In season 1 they went on forever and seemed random.  By three they are downright brief (everyone on the island can have an orgasm in under 90 seconds).

If you like spooky campy fun, want an LGBT (ok only LBT) cast of characters, and understand that the show has a limited budget I say go for it!",1246406400,2,926,4.666666666666667

3323392,5,B0012FA8CC,"I finally gave into temptation and bought The Dante's Cove Guilty Pleasure Pack despite already owning and having watched all three seasons.

I really wanted to see The Lost Pilot which as it turns out should have stayed lost.

The only good thing about The Lost Pilot is that it shows the importance of proper casting.

In the pilot Jill Bennett was cast as Grace sadly she could not produce the right level or type of venom needed for the part.

Most of the rest of the pilot was also totally miscast.

The original Toby had all the appeal of cold oatmeal and the other actors were totally wooden it was like a bad production done by a high school drama club.

The saving forces of the pilot were William Gregory Lee and Gregory Michael.

William Gregory Lee had the part of Ambrosius nailed at the audition.

His audition was an extra feature on the pilot and he was instantly believable as the tormented Ambrosius.

In Season One we were introduced to the history of Dante's Cove and we got to know the characters and their individual stories.

We got to watch as Kevin and Toby struggled to build a relationship and leave their individual baggage behind while dealing with doubts and the magical mess that surrounded them.

In Season Two we got to watch as their relationship struggled due to doubts,temptation and manipulation.

In Season Three we watched as Kevin learned magic in an attempt to release himself from Ambrosius while he struggled with the feelings he was developing for him.

We also got to watch Toby dealing with his knowledge of and dislike of Ambrosius while moving on with his life because he believed Kevin was happy.

Returning in season 3 was Jill Bennett.

She was wonderful in the dual role of Michelle confused innocent who was clueless to what was going on around her and the agent of malice for The House of Shadows.

Over the course of 3 seasons it was wonderful to watch several of the characters grow and mature.

I watched as Ambrosius was released from his prison and began stalking Kevin and professing love simply because he believed they were destined to be together.

The irony was that because of his past in which he had to repress his sexuality he had no concept of what love truly is.

He slowly became a man who knew that simply possessing somebody was not love and that if you truly love somebody you must give them the time and freedom to explore their own path and return to you if love is true and shared.

I also enjoyed watching Grace go from being a woman/child who had been mislead, manipulated and emotionally abused to serve the needs and ideas of her mother into a fully matured woman who was finally able to see and except true love.

Both She and Ambrosius were also able to see that their fight was a result of manipulation,half truths,useless grudges and a total waste of both their energies.

The most interesting character change was in Adam.

He went from a sexually confused trust fund kid who was hiding his pain in drugs and alcohol to a man who knew his attraction to and love for his friend Toby was worth giving up his claim to family money.

He learned that nothing could ever make him as happy as sharing his life and love with Toby.",1213574400,22,3208,4.529513888888889

I absolutly loved this season!! I admit i was a bit apprehensive when i discovered Van (Nadine Heiman) wasn't going to be in this season after her crucial role in season 2 and actually the whole series, but with the addition of the newest cast members, this season ranks as the best yet in my opinion. I was extremely pleased that Michelle Wolf (Britt) was a main cast member this season. She is awsome!! I also really enjoyed Jill Bennett taking over the role of Michelle, not that i didn't like Erin Cummings, it was the fact Jill brought a more deeper, even darker dimension to the character. I also was extremely pleased Thea Gill (Diana) returned. She takes on a greater role this season, very very well done. Despite Van not returning, the writers did come up with a clever way to explain her absence while still keeping the season opener continuing from the end of the second season. So i would definatly say that fans won't be disappointed, this season is even more sexier and darker than the two previous seasons with many surprising twists and turns leading up to a stunning finale. I was on the edge of my seat the entire season!!!",1203897600,48,1169,4.5933014354066986

I looked forward to Season 3 , but found it disappointing on many levels. The addition of Jensen Atwood as Griffin is a plus and Grace (Tracy Scoggins) is given a little more depth this season. But newcomers Jenny Shimazu and (especially) Reichen Lemkuhl are awful. Poor Reichen does nothing but parade around shirtless (but never removing his Rolex) and manages to be slimy more than sexy. Jon Fleming's Adam is dumb but smokin' hot and he and Toby (Charlie David) make a better couple than Toby and Kevin (Gregory Michael). Thea Gill is just plain annoying as Diana and her character's part in the ""Shadows"" plot is needless. But the Season is saved by the storyline of Ambrosious (William Gregory Lee) and Kevin. Mr. Lee does a great job in allowing Ambrosious some softness and his unrequited love for Kevin is sweet and affecting. Mr. Michael continues to be the best Actor here - his  soft and sensitive Kevin is the perfect foil for Ambrosious and the more Kevin tries to leave ""Bro,"" the more he is drawn to him.",1385596800,,1138,4.633663366336633

Elementary school plays have better plot lines and scripts than this show. They couldn't even get the T&A scenes correct. The production in its entirety is really a hot mess from beginning to end.

Its sad on two fronts:

1. Even though the cast aren't A-list actors, these are intelligent people. To have intelligent people do stupid plots and recite kindergarten scripts is always a crime.

2. If they actually developed a plot line and good script this could've actually been a really good show.

Even making allowances for low budget, which I happily do, I found this show filled with nothing but the most two-dimensional rotten actors and actresses I have ever seen, not to mention the gratuitous sexuality in the ""Lair"" episodes which I found off-putting, even unconvincingly annoying. I found myself thinking that this was nothing but schlock ""A grade"" pornography.  And the attempt to create a kind of neo-gothic atmosphere is impossible when the furniture is more interesting than the dialogue.  I mean, how on earth can one make magic and vampires dull?  And again, the acting!  Ye gods.  I have been to livlier funerals.  It is pretty plain that the casting call pretty much consisted of taking off shirts, waxing, and raising eyebrows to reflect every emotion.

And then I thought I was perhaps being too harsh, and might be able to enjoy some ""camp"" value if I fast-forwarded through the sex scenes.  And, just no.  It's not funny, its not ""so bad it's funny.""  It's just - bad.

If you like gay porn, beefcake calendars, and Jenna Jameson physiques, ""Dante's Cove"" is for you.  Otherwise, spend some time in ""Dante's Inferno.""  It's less of a torture.

The characters become more complex this season.  You have good guys dabbling with vengeance betrayal and bad guys making sacrifices for the greater good.

The witches are out of the broom closet this season so the plot has moved from a ""There's something spooky going on around here"" tale to something more interesting.

Tracy Scoggins and Thea Gill are faboo... especially Tracy - I really love her humorous moments and she looks stunning.

The sex scenes are a little shorter.  In season 1 they went on forever and seemed random.  By three they are downright brief (everyone on the island can have an orgasm in under 90 seconds).

3323442,1,B0012FA8CC,"I cannot believe that this show has a life. While the bodies are great, the acting is really bad and the plot is too simplistic (even for a fantasy piece).  I guess it was low budget and they got the actors they could afford.",1225324800,2,225,4.113636363636363
3323443,4,B0012FA8CC,"The gang are back for another season of mayhem. As with a lot of series television, they don't come into thier own until the third season and Dante's Cove is no different. Our main characters, Toby, Kevin, Adam Ambrosious, Diana, Grace and Brook are all comfortable with their roles. I am really pleased that Charlie David has lost his woodeness. I always found his acting to be stilted and not really believable, but in this season he is great. I was also pleasantly surprised that Reichen Lehmkuhl can act as well as being just drop dead gorgeous. The new cast additions are as always intriguing. But for me it is our main five characters that I love. I hope they will do another season and even a crossover storyline for Dante's Cove and The Lair where witches do battle with Vampires, and may the best set of pecs win. what a hoot! Congrats to all",1224979200,2,851,4.496774193548387

3323445,5,B0012FA8CC,"I really enjoyed watching it, mostly for the men, but I got involved in the story as well...the men are hot!
The only negative thing I can say is way too many full frontal shots.  This kind of show does not need to go that far...there is enough porn out there. However, the rest of the ""love"" scenes are the best I've ever seen anywhere.",1221696000,3,337,4.184615384615385
3323446,3,B0012FA8CC,"I was looking forward to more action and more extreme sex among the characters, as in the 1st season, but the third season seem more of a wind down, and quite superficial!",1219104000,,171,4.375
3323447,3,B0012FA8CC,"I bought this DVD (and Seasons 1 & 2) as we are not fortunate enough to have gay networks available to screen this type of show in Australia.
Season Three is significantly different to the first two seasons, with new characters, some missing old characters (eg Van) and a number of surprise plot twists that kept me guessing to the end.
Good to see some S-E-R-I-O-U-S actors in the cast as a few of the leads appear to have learnt their craft from watching ""Days of Our Lives""!!!
Any fans of Here! TV will not be disappointed.",1217721600,8,526,4.43298969072165
3323448,5,B0012FA8CC,"Season 3 is the best of the series.  Great fun to watch if you are not put off by a homo-wiccan theme.  The plot line doesn't amount to much, but who cares?  The location and the beautiful people were enough for me!",1217635200,4,215,4.071428571428571
3323449,4,B0012FA8CC,"The sexual chemistry between all those beautiful men is fantastic. Dantes cove is an anywhere anytime, all-the-time kind of program. For any woman who wants to see men at their most beautiful, do yourself a favour and check out Dantes Cove!",1217462400,4,240,4.878048780487805
3323450,5,B0012FA8CC,"Having purchased Dante's Cove Season 1 and 2, I looked forward to Season 3.  The story line is interesting and moves rather quickly.  The acting is good, considering the young cast and levels of experience.  I enjoy the Hawaii setting/locale, too.  Dante's Cove is not for everyone.  As a result, some first-time viewers might be offended due to the language and subject matter---nudity and gay/lesbian themes.",1217376000,4,410,5.151515151515151
3323451,4,B0012FA8CC,It seems this show gets better and better  the only thing I didnot like about this season 3 so far (still watching it)  you donot know about the storm till later on and one person dies (who i thinks should have not)but  it still a great show,1216771200,2,241,4.085106382978723

Can't wait for a Season 4 etc. and hope for more Toby and Adam scenes. Further it would be great to have more episodes included as in Queer as Folk.",1216080000,4,174,4.0
3323454,3,B0012FA8CC,"All the men are beauties, all of the women are hot, the plot lines suck big time, but is that not the point? This show is just fun , fun , fun. But, sexy, I do not think so, it is just too vanilla and safe. And, the leads never turn around when the cloths come off- how hokie is that.",1215993600,,284,3.6721311475409837
3323455,3,B0012FA8CC,"This season was a little surprising in how it followed last season.  It was as if the powers that be did not expect to film Season III.  It was also sad that some characters didn't return and others were gotten rid of pretty early in the season.  I understand that there is to be a season IV.  I hope more thought goes into this.  Perhaps the writer's strike impacted this season's production.  Nevertheless, it was entertaining.",1215820800,,429,4.578947368421052
3323456,5,B0012FA8CC,"What started out as a sleeper series has slowly developed into a great show that equals Buffy and Charmed. Everyone loves witches and vampires and camp. This show has a great cast, great bodies and great story lines  which has given Dante's Cove one very large fan based following.

Accept Dante's Cove as pure fun entertainment with all the right ingredients, you won't be disappointed. It's what makes this show a big hit and will pull you in instantly.

After  Season 3, one can't wait for them to cast the spell for Season 4 and many more Seasons to follow.",1215302400,,561,4.58

3323461,5,B0012FA8CC,"If you have seen and liked the first two seasons, I expect you will like this season as well.  The best actor in this is Reichen (if you can believe it!) but they are all beautiful and seldom are completely clothed. Woo hoo!

This year seems to have more female storyline and nudity, etc, so ladies, buy with confidence!  Also, more storyline from the lame Lair- with gratuitous nudity, which although completely gratuitous, adds to the overall fun of the show.

Hilarious and pretty badly acted, this is HUGE fun for my friends and I.  A guilty pleasure that we look forward to more than just about any other series we are watching!  I hope this series goes on forever.  LOVE IT!",1214956800,13,680,4.524590163934426

3323463,5,B0012FA8CC,"The third season of Dante's Cove is at first sad, because half the island is trashed from the storm (from Season 2)including the Inn and half of it's inhabitants are homeless.  It quickly turns evil and of course that makes everyone horny.

The sex scenes are pretty hot and the evil presense keeps you guessing what's happening and why and who's going to die next(or who's going to pleasure who next).

My only complaint is that these seasons only contain five episodes (way too short) But, you can easily watch the whole season in one afternoon or evening!

This one's worth the small price especially if you own seasons 1 & 2.",1214870400,3,629,4.589285714285714
