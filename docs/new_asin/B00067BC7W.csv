8039663,5,B00067BC7W,"If you are interested in knowing the details behind one of the greatest escapes of WW2, then ""NOVA: The Great Escape"" is a documentary you won't want to miss. Even though a fraction of the POW's actually escaped to freedom, it resulted with a massive manhunt that was ordered by Hitler himself. As a suggestion, Hollywood recreated a movie titled, ""The Great Escape"", based on testimony from POW's that actually lived and took part in the escape that you might also want to watch.",1431820800,,480,4.726190476190476
8039664,5,B00067BC7W,"This choice is not only interesting as far as the subject matter, but it has closed captions for the hearing impaired AND described video for the visually impaired. When the audio descriptions are turned on, a voice inserts verbal descriptions of on-screen action in the natural pauses in the dialog. Both seem to be well done, although I'm no expert on described video.",1221782400,5,370,4.888888888888889
8039665,5,B00067BC7W,"Who could imagine that, 60 years after the event, a home-made escape tunnel would still be recognizable? And in friable, sandy soil at that? Or that the rubber stamp made from a POW's heel, once used to make forged documents for the escapees, would still have the recognizable marking of German Nazi insignia? Or that a chain of Klim cans, once strung together to ventilate the tunnel, would still exist in spite of decades of corrosion?

This DVD shows this and more. Archeologists first determined, from old aerial photos of Stalag Luft III, the site of the onetime hut that contained tunnel Dick. Next, the trap of Dick was located. It had been designed and then cleverly concealed in a concrete draining pit by a POW who had been a Polish engineer in the RAF. The tunnel opening itself was just beyond a vertical slotted slab that had been fitted on the side of the draining pit (not the underside of the pit as erroneously shown in the film on the Great Escape). The corroded hooks once used to lift the slab were also found.  Part of the electric wiring used in Dick was still visible. Most probably, it had been part of that waterproof wiring that a POW had stolen from a German electrician. The fact that Dick had been abandoned for escape purposes and had been converted into a storage chamber explains the fact that the forger's rubber stamp was also found in the upper part of the tunnel.

Because the tunnel had been dug thirty feet deep, a power shovel was used to dig a pit down to that level. One could at once appreciate the challenge to the tunnelers posed by the loose yellow sand. It kept cascading down into the pit. However, even though Dick had long since collapsed and the shoring boards rotted away, the crisp linear outline of the tunnel could still be clearly seen at the bottom of the pit. Further probing revealed the chain of Klim cans once used to ventilate this tunnel. Unfortunately, the increasing danger of the sand collapsing caused further excavation to be called off.

A number of ageing veterans of Stalag Luft III were on hand to observe the excavation. One of them was Jimmy James. The scenes of the excavation of Dick were interspersed with scenes showing old photos of the camp as well as descriptions of the Great Escape itself. It would be interesting if there were a followup dig to the site of Harry. After the Great Escape, the Germans had poured sewage into the tunnel but, unlike Tom, did not blow it up. At very least the concrete plugs poured in by the Germans, into both the exit and entry shafts of Harry, should be readily findable.",1147132800,28,2586,4.566810344827586
