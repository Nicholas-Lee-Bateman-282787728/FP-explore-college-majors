Friends Jimbo (Chainsaw) and Keith run an investigation business for catching cheating spouses. One day, they run into Joey, Keith's gay friend, and meet him at Woody's nightclub later that evening. There, Keith meets Chloe, the owner, and there's an instant attraction. Jim ends up hooking up with Ursula and Helga and has a wild night of S&M.

Keith and Chloe go on a date and hit it off. Margaret, Keith's ex-girlfriend, pops into the picture and makes attempts to win him back. As Keith and Chloe start getting serious, Margaret continues to weasel her way in. To make him jealous, she sleeps with Jimbo, and then catches him at a weak moment and kisses him in front of Chloe.

After making amends with Chloe, Keith pretends to want Margaret back, and they attend relationship counseling. Keith then flees, and leaves Margaret in the hands of bondage queens Helga and Ursula.

This wasn't a bad movie, but nothing really new either. Chloe and Chainsaw's acting was good, but Keith and Joey seemed forced. Plus, Chloe was nice to look at, and Chainsaw's antics were pretty humorous. It's worth a watch, but probably not something you'd revisit soon after. For a better romantic comedy, watch Shanghai Kiss.
