8553168,5,B00AKKH5O4,"This is a fascinating interview with one of the most important pop stars of the 1960s. He took the whole world by storm very quickly and had everybody doing his new dance and singing along with his songs. Chubby Checker looked so great and danced so well on TV back then, that everyone was simply mesmerized. Back then the music was much more uplifting and made you feel so much better when you listened to it.
Chubby tells all about his experiences with record companies, Dick Clark and American Bandstand. Back then almost everyone but Elvis Presley got ripped off by crooked managers and record companies that treated those young and talented people like slaves. Not even the amazingly handsome, smiling, and wealthy Dick Clark did the rock and roll stars any favors apparently. But Chubby Checker still amazingly looks great and sings very well, so by all means go to see and hear him if you have the opportunity.",1447804800,,917,4.7375
