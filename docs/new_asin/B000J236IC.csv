8148745,2,B000J236IC,"We deliberately got this DVD because we live in Australia and so we needed a Region 2/PAL version. However, we were surprised when we got this product and the cover was not in English (Dutch I think) - only the title is in English. Having seen the cover live now this is obvious, but when purchasing on the site it is not obvious as in the thumbnail you can only see the title & the rest of the Dutch print is too small to see.

The full-size version of the image on the site it is possible to see the text, but you have to pay close enough attention to it. My eyes are naturally drawn to the textual description so I didn't notice the Dutch in the image. I think

We have not (as yet) had a chance to watch the DVD so it might turn out to have an English soundtrack available (I hope so because we have season 1 and it's really good). However, even if it does it is still a bit of an inconvenience, and had I known this was in Dutch I may have bought another DVD. I think it would be best if the seller (or whoever is in charge of the product description) explicitly mentions the language in the product description.",1345680000,2,1117,4.095890410958904
