5166173,1,B008I34Z34,Sanctuary was mildly entertaining for the first season but by Season 2 it had gone completely off the rails. Some awfully poor choices regarding the direction of the show/characters. And then they went over the Bollywood cliff and that was it for me.,1350950400,3,250,4.837209302325581
5166174,5,B008I34Z34,"A lot of shows can be described as labors of love, but Sanctuary is one that undeniably earned the title. It was created as a webseries that was filmed between Amanda Tapping's commitments to Stargate and released with no real expectation anything would come from it.

When Sanctuary premiered, the self-dubbed ""terrible trio"" - writer/creator Damian Kindler, director Martin Wood and actress Amanda Tapping - acted as executive producers but didn't receive compensation for the job. They were only there to get the show up and running, and they felt the executive producer fees should go toward making the show since they weren't backed by a studio. The show was filmed with a heavy reliance on virtual sets, which allowed them to give their world a scope and depth unlike anything else on television. The Sanctuary was truly a dark, Gothic place with branching corridors and dark nooks and crannies where anything could (and probably was) lurking.

Sanctuary was the story of Dr. Helen Magnus, a teratologist (a real doctrine: it's the study of abnormalities of physiological development) from Victorian England whose experiments with vampire blood granted her the gift/curse of longevity. When the series begins she is 157 years old and ""hasn't aged a day"" since 1888. She's used her extended lifespan to continue her father's work of seeking out creatures called ""Abnormals."" Her mission is to protect these creatures from humans, and vice versa.

Throughout history, Helen has had a myriad of people assisting her in this goal. At the turn of the last century, she worked with James Watson (the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes), Nikola Tesla (yes, that one), Nigel Griffin (who inspired The Invisible Man by H.G. Wells), and her fianc, Montague John Druitt: Jack the Ripper. She acquired wealth and connections that have made her a very dangerous person to cross.

One of the most intriguing things about Sanctuary was the scope of its history. For each season, the main title was adjusted to show a photograph of Helen standing beside a different historic figure. Albert Einstein, Amelia Earhart, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. were all spotted on Helen's desk, and countless other historic figures were name-dropped through the series. Helen didn't treat these as brushes with greatness; they were just people she once worked alongside. Joe DiMaggio taught her how to play baseball. She was aboard the *Titanic during its doomed voyage. She watched the sun rise with one of the Beatles (George Harrison, as confirmed later by Tapping).

Characters like Nikola Tesla, John Druitt and Adam Worth had their origins in real-life Victorian and Edwardian newsreels. Just like Stargate SG-1 sneakily taught mythology and ancient Egyptian history through alien overlords and epic space battles, Sanctuary inspired its fans to dust off their history books (okay, fine, Wikipedia) and read up on the real people their favorite characters were based on.

With all of that put aside, Sanctuary was an extremely rare show in that it featured as its lead character a woman whose mission in life didn't involve finding Mr. Right, getting married, having a bunch of kids. She effortlessly held her own with the men. In a situation where Helen is being held hostage, her male companion gets the drop on the enemies and uses his advantage to take out the henchmen at the back of the room. Helen handles the guy with the knife to her throat on her own.

The show took risks. When a same-sex kiss was written into an episode, Amanda Tapping asked for the scene to be adjusted to make it clear Helen wanted it. With one moment, the show confirmed their main character was bisexual, territory rarely explored by other mainstream television series. Amanda had long told anyone who would listen that Helen was bisexual, and that she'd romanced women (including a dalliance with Amelia Earhart), but to have it confirmed so completely was an amazing thing to see. Sanctuary for all is not an empty motto.

With conventional thinking, Sanctuary should never have existed. A show with no studio backing, powered by the creative energies of three people who basically pushed their boat out to sea and waited for the winds to pick up, it was an uphill climb. We had four great seasons, with historical scope and amazing characters. At the very, very least we can say that the series ended with an appropriate finale. This DVD set collects one chapter in the long life of Helen Magnus. Whatever the next chapter is I'm sure it will be as epic and amazing. I just hope, one way or another, we get a glimpse of what she's up to.

(Sanctuary is over, but Sanctuary for Kids lives on. Please visit sanctuaryforkids.org and see what you can do to help.)

EDITED to reflect the actual release!
The Complete Series comes in a gorgeous slipcase that, appropriately for the show, is elegant and aged. It makes a very stately addition to the DVD shelf. The discs are specially designed to match the box style rather than just recycling the ones used in the individual season sets.

There are no new special features here if you already own the sets. A lot of effort went into making this set look right, and it reflects the content very well. The artwork - both the shots of the Sanctuary and the aged photographs of the cast - is absolutely perfect. It looks and feels like something that would be at home on the shelf in Helen Magnus' office. The design also incorporates the box art for Seasons 1-4 in a ""family-album"" type frame that I felt was beautifully designed.

If you already own the individual sets, there's nothing that will make this set must-have. It's a collector's item, something for people who want to represent the show in a very special way rather than a money grab to make you pay twice for the same 59 episodes.",1346284800,173,5896,4.867397806580259

5166186,3,B008I34Z34,"This is going to be a rather silly review, but I feel impelled to WARN you.  If you have a problem with someone constantly having his mouth open and often hanging down like a dog, be wary! The actor who plays the pivotal role of Will Zimmerman seems to CONSTANTLY stand there with his mouth open. Does he have clogged sinuses?  Is he a long time mouth breather?  I could see using the mouth open actor ploy to illustrate emotional shock, but this actor does it all the time.  My family started yelling at him ""Close your mouth!"" LOL

If seeing a handsome young guy mouth breathing almost all the time does not bother you, then buy the series and enjoy it. I just couldn't get past this actor's constant hanging jaw. I don't think I've ever seen an actor's bottom row of front teeth as much as this guys.",1495756800,2,803,4.326666666666667

A few good stories pepper the series but most of it is very unimaginative and never really pulls in the steam punk elements it occasionally flirts with.

Fifth season was cut short because they dropped the franchise, and it had a somewhat lame ending, but at least it had an ending (unlike Firefly).

She did well in this and it wasn't terribly inconsistent throughout.

A surprise character was Jonathon Young in the role of Nikola Tesla.  His presentation was superb, usually funny and always over the top.

It was too bad they ended the series on such a quick note, as they had to wrap up the series in a shortened story-arc.",1460851200,2,558,4.485148514851486

Not all of them, but enough to start me on an unsatisfactory relationship with Amazon's support staff.  I've gone through three copies of the set - and three contacts with Amazon. Each Contact was misunderstood and offered empty promises.  I can not recommend that anyone make this purchase as the quality control for the DVD's is completely absent, and the quality of Amazon Support is vacuous.",1425168000,4,561,4.894736842105263

The only negative in the last season (spoiler alert) was that Magnus and her helpers lost the backing of the governments and must proceed on their own.

I thought the series ended too soon. I wanted to see the underground city Magnus had been working on for over 100 years. I liked the concept that some humans had extended lifespans.

You find yourself practically mauling it to free some of the discs, I transferred all discs more or less safely to different case though, so it ended up being just a hassle. I don't know what kind of genius came up with this craptastic thing but they should be killed in a righteous chemical fire. They resemble the normal plastic disc holders the half that holds the discs, but they overlap eachother and lock the second disc in each sleeve in place so it underlaps the first disc. This makes it hard as hell to pry the second disc in each sleeve off, and don't even get me started on trying to put the second one back in. I just said screw it and transferred them all to a cheap but effective holder and used the first slot for storage of misc movies I backed up.

The shipment was timely though, and it arrived in a good package. You can put your faith in this getting to you in a timely and safe manner. I suggest buying a case logic brand, they last and are really cheap.",1418947200,6,991,4.243386243386244

5166313,3,B008I34Z34,"i am into third season of this show.  story line is imaginative and not boring as another poster thought.  what i found odd is that it seemed the writers of the show went out of their way to not have Americans or the US as being significant in the shows.  almost all the characters are either canadian, british or some other foreigners.  but only one or two are Americans and they are not significant characters. likewise the locales, where things take place are all in canada or elsewhere. its like the writers have some canadian inferiority complex to the US and need to write the show to make like canada or uk is the focal point of world importance. that spin, in and of itself, makes the show somewhat less realistic.  but other than that odd quirk, the show seems okay.  with regards to the dvd's,  one thing i really hate that some dvd producers do is put in a lot of commercials or previews to other series they will be releasing in the future.  to me, my feeling is if i pay for these dvd's, they should be free of these commercials.  it takes several minutes to fast forward through all of them to get to the dvd episode menu.  not all the discs in this series have this but a few i have put in do.  for those that are concerned about the packaging or dvd cases, the cases are sturdy and easy to remove the dvds from.  the case this full series comes in is among the best i have encountered.  not too fancy, but simple and sufficiently protective of the dvd's",1372809600,2,1469,4.298181818181818
