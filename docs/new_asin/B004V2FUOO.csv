8442602,4,B004V2FUOO,"Joru Ka Ghulam is an excellent comedy with Rajesh Khanna playing the hilarious hero. The rib tickling comedy has Nanda and Omprakash both also making situations very funny. The music of Kalyanji Anandji was good and the songs are very situational and are remembered still. The movie was a run away hit as it was unique then, still is unique. Rajesh Khanna shows great mastery over comedy and has hilarious scenes with Omprakash. This shows that the SuperStar is good in comic roles also. This movie is recommended for all those viewers who want to laugh and see a clean movie. It is a must for Super Star Rajesh Khanna fans. They must see it.",1305763200,,642,4.591304347826087
