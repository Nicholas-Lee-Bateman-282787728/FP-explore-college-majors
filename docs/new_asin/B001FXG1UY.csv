8302950,2,B001FXG1UY,"History Channel's ""Inside the CIA"" is actually a collection of 5 separate programmes that aired at various times on the network and have been bundled together in this set. Because of this the coverage of the subject is incomplete and extremely fragmented. You get one episode on post WWII recruitment of former Nazis to work for US intel, one episode on Air America, one episode on CIA involvement in Soviet occupied Afghanistan, one episode on MKULTRA (the Agency's misguided attempt to weaponize LSD), and one episode on the interrogation of prisoners. All in all, it is a disappointment. A better choice is the DVD ""CIA The Shocking Stories Behind the Headlines"" by BFS, and if you are interested in espionage against the US, History Channel's ""Spies"" DVD.",1273190400,12,759,4.984251968503937
