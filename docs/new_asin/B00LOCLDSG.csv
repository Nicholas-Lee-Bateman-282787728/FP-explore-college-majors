6495271,3,B00LOCLDSG,"First, there was ""Jaws,"" a film about a very-large shark with a too-small boat that made people want to get out of the water.  Next, we had ""Pirahna 3D"" -- well, there was presumably ""Pirahana"" and ""Pirahna 2"" before that, but whatever -- and that made people REALLY want to get out of the water, especially men.  And then finally there came ""Sharknado 2:  The Second One"" which made people want to get out of the what?  Land?

The two Sharknado films seem to borrow a stupid but oddly funny idea from Saturday Night Live -- the Land Shark -- and turn it completely on it's head.  I suppose if you can't get away from sharks, even by leaving the water, then sharks become really scary.  And that's the premise from the original writers from the SyFy network, I suppose.

After ""Sharknado"" (the original), I wrote a review that said something like, ""'Sharknado' isn't campy ENOUGH.""  It had it's moments, but if you're going to make a film like this, you need to go totally in the camp direction.  Well, the writers seemed to listen, or perhaps read, because that's the direction that they take here.  And it almost works.

The first act is actually pretty funny, as a lot of actors from previous television shows and films are introduced who play similar roles to those that they originally played.  I don't want to throw out too many names as that might ruin it for you.  But I will say that William Shatner is NOT in this film, but a famous scene from his early-60s Twilight Zone episode is:  In the iconic plane scene, Ian Ziering plays the Shatner role, but instead of seeing some ""demon"" on the wing, Mr. Ziering instead sees a shark.  I did get a very good laugh about that obvious reference.

But then by the second and third acts, the writers drift away from the humor and this film devolves into the drivel of the first ""film.""  It's pretty much the same tale -- or is that tail? -- as it becomes a fish-out-of water story for not only the sharks, but Mr. Ziering, as he takes his act to New York this time.  New York, LA?  LA, New York?  Who cares?  Perhaps only the sharks.

Well, just like ""Jaws"" made you afraid to go into the water, the SyFy network might make you afraid to DVR any of their shows.  Especially if you're smarter than some stupid shark.",1407110400,,2266,4.417874396135265
6495272,3,B00LOCLDSG,"Sharknado 2 premiered on the SyFy Channel the other day, and I think it's a notch below the original simply because it seems more like a parody of the original instead of an actual sequel, which would be fine if it were funnier. But the only times I really laughed were during the numerous cameos, which include Andy Dick, Perez Hilton, Billy Ray Cyrus, Matt Lauer, and Kelly Ripa. Ian Ziering is such a cheeseball in this, and Tara Reid's acting gets worse from year to year. I did like the opening and the finale is great. Everything in between is just okay.",1406851200,,560,4.446601941747573
6495303,3,B00LOCLDSG,"I'm not a fan of movies that are made badly or stupidly ON PURPOSE. I like watching bad movies where the filmmakers actually tried to make quality products (but failed miserably). The Sharknado series is meant to be a joke... so when the Rifftrax crew rips Sharknado 2 apart, their efforts feel kind of wasted. Still, they delivered some solid comedy, so I can't fault them for trying. This particular riff session just fell a bit flat for me overall.",1502236800,2,451,4.65

6495343,4,B00LOCLDSG,"When you have a movie as dopey as SHARKNADO, what can you possibly do to top it?  You can move the sequel to New York City, but you can't really improve on it.  SHARKNADO 2 refuses to take itself seriously, which is why the RiffTrax send-up, while fun, is occasionally too much like . . . hold for it . . . shooting sharks in a barrel.  Most of the fun is watching stars and media figures spoof themselves, most notably Al Roker, Matt Lauer and Judd Hirsch.  Amusing, but not a RiffTrax best.",1484611200,,492,4.202127659574468

My kids are learning to appreciate humor, puns, and older films tie-ins. I do wish the cursing was subdued though.

6495447,5,B00LOCLDSG,"I finally re-watched this. I haven't seen it since it originally aired in 2014, and it's still stupidly awesome. I think it's actually better, campier, sillier and more fun than the original. This one is filled with random cameos from people such as Robert Hays, Matt Lauer, Kelly Osbourne, Kelly Ripa, Al Roker, Billy Ray Cyrus, Judd Hirsch, Jared the Subway guy and many others.

This time, the sharknado hits in New York City when Fin Shepard and April Wexler is on tour to promote her new book How to Survive a Sharknado and Other Unnatural Disasters (Which is actually a real book you can buy on Amazon) Fin goes around trying to save his family and friends from this newer and bigger sharknado that can't be stopped by explosives this time.

6495478,4,B00LOCLDSG,"Even campier than the first.  I think they budgeted about ten times the amount of the first movie, plus they had many cameo appearances by media celebrities, making it more fun.  The acting is as horrible as the first movie, but that's what make it so deliciously fun.  The third movie, by the way, is even better (worse?).  So make a fun evening and binge watch all three; you won't be disappointed (unless you lack a sense of humor).  Once you've watched all three, you will have seen the partial or total destruction of Los Angeles, New York City and Washington DC, by sharks which seem to cause more damage than the tornadoes that spawn them.",1467072000,,646,4.5344827586206895

6495496,4,B00LOCLDSG,"An equally entertaining sequel to Sharknado & its ever bit as fun & outrageous as the first, maybe even more so at times. Ian Ziering & Tara Reid return & are joined by a new cast of characters for this horror/comedy sequel. Basic plot is this time the Sharknado comes to NYC where once again Fin Shepard (Ian Ziering) must deal with the sharks being rained down & find a way to save the day. This one had some kills that easily top some of the ones in the first film & its also just as enjoyable if not a bit more so. I think as crazy as this series is its going to be destined to become a cult classic over the years. The disc has some nice extras too like deleted scenes & a scene exclusive to the Canadian edition. If you at all enjoyed the first film then this one is a must watch. Just like with the first film its a blast if you can gather some friends, have some drinks, sit back & turn your brain off for a funny good time.",1464220800,,932,3.9893048128342246

OK, that's overstating it.  It's not a good movie.  So, why the five-star rating?

Because it's a ludicrously entertaining movie.  It doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is, a silly horror/action/sci-fi movie, made purely for the amusement of the viewer.  And on that level, it's a gigantic, spinning, chewing, gory success.

6495632,4,B00LOCLDSG,"The first reaction to this is: Not again???!!!  Then settle down to enjoy. It's more of the same as the first with a few changes. This time, the setting is New York City where enough odd things happen already. Also, the sharks themselves seemed prepared and in actual accord with the weather this time, gathering in the harbor as the storm approaches. People are aware of what is going on because the heroine of the original movie wrote a book about their experiences so everyone believed them, especially after their plane is brought down by a shark being sucked into one of the jets engines and the pilot and copilot being killed.

What's fun about this one are all the cameos lurking (Wil Wheaton as a passenger seen for a full 3 minutes before being mowed down by a shark sailing down the plane's aisle. Robert Hays (star of the original satire of airline disaster movies Airplane!) as the hapless pilot. Judd Hirsch reprising his role as a NY taxi driver.) and many more.

It's so bad it's good and there was no doubt there was going to be a Sharknado 3, as we now know has come to pass.  Will the franchise keep on until the entire world as experienced this weird weather/horror movie phenomenon? Probably. Look for Sharknado 12--the Shark Who Devoured the World?

6495633,4,B00LOCLDSG,"This one is a somewhat superior movie than the first (which I liked) though like the first this is full of scientifically muddled science.  But who really
cares after all they are not watching this for serious reasons.  Being a NYC resident I found it even more interesting watching tornadoes meander
around many of the places where I worked.  Facts about tornadoes did not seem to matter to the producers: note that tornadoes over water are NOT
called ""water spouts"" but in fact called ""tornadoes"", and error even tornado chasers sometimes make.  Tornadoes are generated out of super cell
thunder storms whilst water spouts are caused by temperature irregularities on water.  They are usually harmless (I saw a guy fly a small airplane
through one) though there are exceptions.  Still, I believe this movie is very watchable, laughable and enjoyable for most of us who like sci fi movies,
even though the story here is absurd.  Sharks could not live in a tornado, they would suffocate!  Be sure to watch the impossible ending; it is terrific!
I just watched SHARKNADO 3 and I can not but wait to write a review on that even more remarkably silly, hilarious and very enjoyable sequel!
I give this one FOUR STARS; could have been Five but for the missing scientific factors (intentional I think and OK).  Still worth time to watch. And

So she had a new shark buzz saw attached to her stump, and if a shark bothered her, she'd turn her arm on and saw the shark in half from tail to mouth. Yes. The big dude in the movie carried a 42"" Stihl chainsaw with him everywhere he went, and he enjoyed buzzing sharks in half lengthwise when the sharks were flying through the air. Yes. You gotta have the townsfolk armed with pitchforks and shovels when they go after the flying sharks. Naturally, when you're flying through the air with your chainsaw, you're going to be swallowed by a giant flying shark, and then cut your way out of his gut while losing no flight speed. Yes.

THE SECOND ONE

The first film in this series showed people something that I had known for years [check my reviews], The Asylum makes fun movies no matter how bad they can sometimes be. So when that became a big hit for them and the SyFy channel I had hoped for a sequel. Thankfully they gave it to me, of course any time The Asylum or SyFy has any kind of success with a flick they make more.

Our two heroes from the first are on their way to New York after putting that whole shark thing behind them. That is until a new Sharknado makes its way to the East Coast while they are flying, its not a gremlin on that wing. Now they have to go through this all over again but this time in the Big Apple as they say.

This is a super fun movie full of all kinds of zany moments [yes I used the word zany] and a crazy amount of cameos. Seriously you could play a drinking game based on the guest appearances here. My favorite of course was Kurt Angle but I am a wrestling fan. Of course out returning players and main cast do great jobs here for this type of flick. Of course the CGI sharks are horrible but that is part of the fun, plus I love all the cheesy moments, gore and well everything.

We have the director and writer returning from the first film. Our returning director is Anthony C. Ferrante who not only made the first film for Asylum but also directed one of my favorites from them, Hansel & Gretel. The writer of these two flicks is of course Thunder Levin who has also written a few other flicks for The Asylum. The good news here is that they returned to create a part three, yes a third one is on its way.

For the special features on the Blu-Ray we get trailers for other Asylum flicks and all kinds of making of behind the scenes features along with gag reels and such. For me though is the two commentary tracks which are both excellent. They are both fun and informative and everything I love about commentaries. This is a fun flick that is not to be taken seriously at all.",1431216000,,2004,4.154639175257732

6495710,5,B00LOCLDSG,"While the original ""Sharknado"" was one of SyFy's most patently ridiculous movies, it was largely played straight (or at least as straight as possible) as a disaster film of epic proportions. That it was an unexpected runaway cult hit surprised everyone, and quick to capitalize of the schlock value of the franchise, the sequel is played much more tongue in cheek. I probably don't even need to discuss the plot (there are sharks in tornadoes, this time in New York City,) and the acting is still painful, particularly from leading lady Tara Reid, but the film is a delight for all the deliciously wrong reasons.

The film opens strongly with Fin (Ian Ziering, looking as intense as ever) and April (Reid) on a plane to New York being flown by Captain Bob Wilson (Robert Hays, of ""Airplane!"" fame.) This starts the intense bout of cameos and pop culture references that make the film so fun. Just about everyone is in it: I bet you can't spot them all. My most obscure spot was Biz Markie as a deli owner, but there are many I missed (even after watching the credits!)  Far and away the best part of the film was the cooperation extended from ""The Today Show"" and ""The Weather Channel"" (the weather graphics were especially entertaining.) My favorite cameos are the quarrelling duo from ""The Today Show, Matt Lauer and Al Roker, who give great insight into the Sharknado onslaught, and bring a bit of unexpected action to the set. Truly brilliant, and I am sure everyone involved had a blast making it.

The DVD comes with several extras, all of which are worth checking out, particularly the ""Making of 'Sharknado 2'"" short. For fans of cult cinema, bad movies, Al Roker, Judd Hirsch, Downtown Julie Brown, Billy Ray Cyrus, Jared ""The Subway Guy"" Fogle, Robert Hays, Robert Klein, Kelly Osbourne, Kelly Ripa (No...really!), circular saw limbs (don't ask), or fish-based weather phenomena in general, this movie really does have it all.

6495847,5,B00LOCLDSG,"My hat's off to everyone involved in this film. After the insanely, atrociously, hilarious bad first film I didn't think it was possible to create a more hilarious, cheesier movie. But apparently the sequel's creators kicked common sense to the curb to make the impossible possible.

First of all, obviously I loved the first Sharknado. If you enjoy cheesy movies it is by far a classic in every way. But this...sweet mother of shark! I refrained from seeing this film for a long, long time after it was released because I was frightened, genuinely scared, that is would be a horrible film now that the creators and actors were self-aware of what a phenomenon the first movie was. But...no. It can't be. This film is literally BETTER in every way!!!!

The Only Thing Missing is Bruce Campbell...and maybe a shower scene for Kari Wuhrer

Apparently a LOT of people loved the first Sharknado, to the point where they begged and pleaded to be in the sequel. And apparently someone in production read my review (not seriously, but...maybe?) and said ""Hey! He's right! We need some Return of the Killer Tomatoes product placement jokes and Kari Wuhrer from Beastermaster 2:Through the Portal of Time and Eight Legged Freaks!"" Because...yes! She is in this film! And looking DANG good for being 47 years old! The product placement jokes are absolutely hilarious. The cameos likewise are ridiculously awesome. I'm talking Kelly Osborne, Will Wheaton, Reality TV stars, B-movie stars, morning television stars, commercial stars, and just about every B-list actor you've ever heard of. The only real downside here is that the gorgeous Kari Wuhrer is absolutely wasted in her role, with no double-shotgun wielding/kung fu kicking action that I'm been hoping for (and continue to be disappointed by the absence of) since Eight-Legged Freaks. She's a gorgeous woman with a lot of presence and needs to do more Shark Butt Kicking! But hey, at least she's in the movie...

Wink, wink

Just about everyone in this film plays things incredibly straight faced yet incredibly good-natured. From the weather girl talking about a shark storm to a certain famous taxi driver, just about everyone who isn't a main character makes you smile. The film itself is incredibly self-aware, but it doesn't' come across as groan-worthy from anyone. that's probably helped by the fact that...

Strike a Pose

All the main characters play their parts so incredibly over-actingly seriously that it's absolutely priceless! The protagonist Fin's anguished face and endless camera posing are sure to be the stuff of legend in years to come. His once famous, now down-and-out actress love interest Tara Reid likewise plays the role EXACTLY like in the first film. If anything they are even MORE into their roles than before!

""There's something on the wing!""

You know you are in for a treat from the INTRO to the movie, which an absolutely insanely awesome combination of Snakes on a Plan (Sharks on a plane? Sharks on a plane!) and the classic Twilight Zone episode Terror at 30,000 feet. It's absolutely quite possibly the most hilarious intro to a movie ever made, and worth seeing the entire film for alone. The rest of the film alternates between goofy, forced, and awesome, but seems to lose a bit of steam, until the sharks attack, and then again, until the finale which I simply was not prepared for. I THOUGHT nothing could top the ending of the first Sharknado, but was I ever wrong! It's the most over-the-top ending to any monster movie ever by a long shot.

Forget Lake Placid. Forget Gator and Gator 2. Forget Eight Legged Freaks and Bats. THIS is the greatest monster movie franchise of modern times, and one of the best comedy series of all time to boot! I simply cannot wait for the sequel!",1424044800,,3770,4.885758998435055

It doesn't help that this movie is peppered with so-called celebrities in cameo appearances, each being a joke in themselves, but impossible to cipher if you don't know who they are.  Most are non-actors trying desperately to act, the rest are has-beens or people who never quite reached stardom.  (Referential humor only works when you know what's being referenced.)  Otherwise, just more of the same.  In essence, it is the same joke moved to another city (supposedly, the third film will do likewise).  Sharks fly, people die in cartoonish fashion.  I know the filmmakers thought they were making a satirical disaster flick but at what point do you end up being the very thing you think you're satirizing.  Not clever by half.  Hampered by a heighten sense of stupidity.

One fun fact if you can remember if Robert Hays, if you know this actor you will remember him from the movies ""Airplane"" and Airplane 2"". They wonderfully slipped him into this film as a pilot and made sure that used as many quirky lines knocking his prior Airplane moves as well.. They also managed to include a lot of New York TV stars from ""Good Morning"" and new casts from New York..

You know it's bad for you but you eat it willingly and smile all the way.  Sharknado 2 is like eating two more burgers afterwards.  What was an initial guilty pleasure is now just sickening.

Sharknado 2 is way too over the top and predictable.  The writing and direction is uninspired, the special effects are lame and cheesy, and during the last third of the movie it gets BORING. The slipshod charm of the first installment is replaced by actors posing, preening, and projecting a silly air of invincibility that prohibits any dramatic tension from building. It's like ""I GOT SWALLOWED BY A SHARK ONCE BEFORE- NOW BRING IT ON BABY!  FIRE UP THAT CHAIN SAW!""

There are a few inspired laughs but now it has a bigger budget and more cameos by second rate celebs.  Even the continuity blunders of the first film have been minimized but all that serves to do is focus more attention on the 5th grade script (apologies to 5th graders).

I kept waiting for Tara Reid's hand to poke through the bandages or to spontaneously re-grow.  On second thought, that might have saved the movie.  Lots of cussing, bad attitudes, fake Tara face, and fake shark guts.  I'll wait for the play.",1419292800,,1284,4.708520179372197

This is definitely a date movie if  your date likes sharks and tornadoes.  Regardless, it is pretty funny and I have to give SYFY props for creating this one.

It is nothing serious, and if you have an hour and a half to waste you could do worse then this.  Yes, the acting is bad, the cgi could use a little work but it has sharks and tornadoes so you tend to forgive these little oversites.

O.K. so you can fly a shark through it. At least the graphic blood scenes  can rival 60s Italian sci-fi movies. This movie takes every opportunity at product name recognition.""Eat Fresh.""

For the rest of the world, one would wonder how such a thing can be produced and who these people are that watch it?

Still reeling form the first encounter from our initial movie, the characters are settling down to a comfortable airplane journey home. Here we borrow a few scenes from the William Shatner twilight zone movie.

So it all begins again. This time we are joined by a cameo of Matt Lauer; he might also see a few other people that just could not stay out of the movie.

The importance of watching this movie is what you can take away with you. You may be able to solve some personal issues watching on how it's professionally done. And such an unfathomable information as the inside of the shark innards smells like chicken.

If you suffered or enjoyed or whatever through this movie you are in luck as there will be a shark Sharknado 3; the subtitle should be Fin for yourself.  Hopefully it will take place in Waxahachie Texas.",1416614400,,1295,4.5085470085470085

He proved this to be effective, because both he and his wife survived the sharknado just fine.

6496237,4,B00LOCLDSG,"So when there was the hubbub about the movie SHARKNADO I didn't jump on the bandwagon knowing up front that the movie was probably as bad as it sounded. I mean most of the made for TV movies that I'd seen on SyFy were so bad that I wouldn't want to waste my time with them. So when I heard that a sequel was in the works I felt the same way. Then it arrived on my doorstep and I thought maybe I should watch just to warn people. Instead I found myself laughing out loud a number of times, more than some of the recent comedies I'd watched.

This is not to say that SHARKNADO 2: THE SECOND ONE is a great movie. Rather it falls into that category of films known as ""so bad they're good"". This designation is saved for movies that are either so terribly made (unintentionally so) that you can't help but laugh at them or movies that are the opposite, made this way so you can snicker at them and laugh knowing up front that they were intended to be bad from the start. This film falls into that second category.

Having not seen the first one, something I need to rectify soon, it took me a moment or two to figure out that this film took place some time after the first one ended. Fin (Ian Ziering) and his ex-wife April (Tara Reid) are heading to New York to promote the book she wrote about surviving the first sharknado. If you don't know what it is it's a tornado that pulls up tons of sharks into it and then hurls them around and lets them lose at various individuals causing much CGI spilled blood in the process. The pair finds themselves flying in the midst of a freak storm and Fin begins to see sharks flying beside the plane. He's told to settle down but soon everything changes as one shark slams into an engine blowing it apart while others begin to find their way into the plane. When the pilots are eaten/knocked out of the plane, Fin comes to the rescue and lands it.

With all that's gone on by now you would think people would begin to prepare right? Nope. Instead they go about their business including Fin's sister and her family. The guys head to the ballpark and his sister takes her daughter to see the Statue of Liberty. You guessed it, both are hit by the shark filled tornados that fling more sharks at people and tear apart the city, including Miss Liberty. When this starts happening the family decides it's time to head back to their hotel to be with one another.

Amazingly (yeah right) Fin and his brother in law and nephew meet up in this huge city and make their way to the hotel. Along the way they're helped by Fin's old girlfriend and a cranky NY taxi cab driver. Fin suggests a plan of attack on the sharknados. That's right; there are two of them heading for one another which would turn them both into one huge sharknado spelling disaster for everyone.

If you've gotten this far you have to be wondering if I'm serious or making this up. I'm not. This is indeed the movie being seen. And it's SO over the top that it becomes hilarious. Home made bombs put together using small propane tanks, chainsaws used to slice up sharks and sharks actually leaping from the water filled streets of Manhattan are all found in this movie. And because it's so blatantly bad it becomes even more hilarious. These were the sort of movies we were cheering years ago when we went to midnight movies!

To cap things off there are tons of cameos in the film. I won't spoil the actor playing the plane's pilot (it's that good of a joke) but you'll find more than him here. Included in the film are Wil Wheaton, Judd Hirsch, Downtown Julie Brown, Billy Ray Cyrus, Kurt Angle, Robert Klein, Mark McGrath, Kari Wuhrer, Vivica A. Fox, Sandra ""Pepa"" Denton, Judah Friedlander, Perez Hilton, Richard Kind, Biz Markie, Matt Lauer, Al Roker, Kelly Osborne, Kelly Rippa, Michael Strahan and more all avoiding the flying sharks (in some cases trying to and failing).

No this is not a movie that is destined for the Oscars. But it will be one that you can laugh at and is well worth the rental fee. It might even be worth adding to your shelf for one of those nights when you want to pop some popcorn, sit down and make comments ala MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 2000. There will be plenty to laugh at and comment on. Don't take it seriously but rather sit back and have some fun. This movie offers that with a little bite to boot.",1413763200,,4334,4.3432098765432094

This is their flagship product for their company and it's definitely holding up well. All's I can say is that with all of the cameo appearances and nods to the Airplane movie (1980), this definitely pushes the envelope on this one and I love it!!

Acting is not to be taken seriously and there's no sense in grading this. Hey, it's a comedy ok, lol. Obviously, this isn't going to win an Oscar Award but mostly it will win a Razzie. In the industry and B rated flicks to Asylum, that's a complement and a big achievement!!!

Special effects was better this time around (not great) along the lines of the same quality. I give it a B.

I wouldn't call this a family movie but there's no fowl language or nudity so it's clean enough for your kids to watch. As for some of the gore (low budget gore that is), it's tolerable and laughable so I seriously doubt any kids would get any nightmares from this.

Unfortunately a new bout of freakish weather was about to rain sharks on his vacation . . . .

Beginning Comment:  The movie has a great opening that will get you in the mood for what is about to come.  If you are familiar with the movie Airplane and Twilight Zone's: ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"", you'll recognize the subtle references.

Ending Comment:  At the ending of the long scrolling credits, there is one more very brief final scene for Airplane fans.

Extras:  (1) ""The Making of ..."" (10:40)  Worth a look, but not detailed.  (2) ""Shark Chum: From the Cutting Floor"" (08:32)  Don't miss.  Includes outtakes, alternate scenes, flubs, and one brief scene from the Canadian version.  (3) ""Gag Reel"" (05:38)  Don't miss. Lots of screaming going on here, along with grimaces, flubs, and green screen antics.  (4) ""Cameos: I Can't Believe They Got ..."" (10:56).  (5) ""Director's Commentary With Ian Ziering & Tara Reid""  Generally a gabfest while the movie plays inaudibly.

6496310,5,B00LOCLDSG,"This movie, like the first one, is intended to be very campy, so you should know that going in to this. It is mystifying to me why some people indignantly declare this is all bogus. Wow, really? I had no idea. So, you're telling me tornados don't really selectively suck just sharks out of the ocean, while bypassing other forms of marine life, and transport them to nearby cities, then drop them in said cities? All without ripping the sharks apart? THANKS for pointing out how impossible that is!

For the rest of us who get it, this movie really is better than the first Sharknado. The human deaths are funnier, as are the shark deaths. Building on the success of the first movie, this time around there is a bigger budget, (which still isn't saying much!) and far more celebrity cameos. Michael Strahan, Matt Lauer, Kelly Ripa, and Kurt Angle are just a few of the celebrities that show up. There is a very good bonus section that fills in the blanks if you missed recognizing a celebrity cameo, and the bonus voice-over by Tara Reid and Ian Ziering is actually very informative.

6496314,5,B00LOCLDSG,"Fuggedaboutit? Not at all. Sharknado 2 may be a different kettle of fish from the original Sharknado, but it is an appropriate follow up. Sharknado, the first one, started out as another in the series of shark movies, which included the likes of Sharktopus and Dinoshark. However, the premise of sharks being scooped up by a tornado and being dropped on Los Angeles put Sharknado in a class of its own.

Sharknado 2 is a deliberate exploitation of the success of the original. It references and parodies the first movie, and, in fact, the whole horror-movie theme. 2 borrows from previous TV works in the genre. The first scene, set on a jet plane approaching New York, is a take-off on the classic Twilight Zone episode, Terror at 20,000 Feet, which starred none other than William Shatner. The movie is replete with cameo appearance by well known actors and celebrities. Judd Hirsch plays, what else, a taxi driver. Matt Lauer and Al Roker do a play-by-play narration of events. The only one who does not appear is William Shatner, although Will Wheaton does stand in for him. New Yorkers will enjoy the scenes set in the New York sewers and subway.

The proper way to view Sharknado 2 is to do a double bill, Sharknado and Sharknado 2, viewing with a large bucket of popcorn. The popcorn can be thrown at the screen when appropriate, which is most of the time.",1410912000,5,1363,4.651452282157677
6496315,1,B00LOCLDSG,"If at first you don't succeed, fail fail again.  This time the SyFy Network locates its shark storm in the heart of new York City and Ian Ziering (and his chainsaw) and Tara Reid are again in the middle of it.  It is nothing more than a mashup of cameos and puns, punctuated by mediocre, rapid-fire special effects that zip by too quickly to be appreciated or even distinguish. Somehow the producers managed to get Matt Lauer, Al Roker, Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan to make cameo appearances; they even get in on the kill.

Both Sharknado and its sequel make the mistake of having their main idea carry the film which grew tiresome after a few minutes, especially the scenes involving sharks flying in every direction. The film is burdened by the mediocre special effects that speed along in such a quick, vague manner that it's hard to even distinguish the action and accurately describe what is happening.

On top of that, the characters we're given are nothing but typical one dimensional TV action movie heroes. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and beyond the bounds of silly. The cameos only provide for a few seconds of fun before we realize we're essentially watching the same film as before, just edited in a different manner.

One redeeming quality was the excellent use of well known New York City locations such as Liberty Island, Times Square, Citi Field, the Empire State Building and the NYC subway system.  One memorable scene was the decapitated heads of the Statue of Liberty becomes a giant bowling ball as it  rolls through the streets of Lower Manhattan.  Also two of the characters were named Martin and Ellen Brody, in a nod to the Jaws, a true great cinematic

It references and parodies the first movie, and, in fact, the whole horror-movie theme.  2 borrows from previous TV works in the genre.  The first scene, set on a jet plane approaching New York, is a take-off on the classic Twilight Zone episode, Terror at 20,000 Feet, which starred none other than William Shatner.  The movie is replete with cameo appearance by well known actors and celebrities.  Judd Hirsch plays, what else, a taxi driver. Matt Lauer and Al Roker do a play-by-play narration of events.  The only one who does not appear is William Shatner, although Will Wheaton does stand in for him. New Yorkers will enjoy the scenes set in the New York sewers and subway.

The proper way to view Sharknado 2 is to do a double bill, Sharknado and Sharknado 2, viewing them with a large bucket of popcorn.  The popcorn can be thrown at the screen when appropriate, which is most of the time.",1410220800,,1378,4.648760330578512
6496317,4,B00LOCLDSG,"The utter bonkersness of this movie, by comparison, makes Snakes on a Plane feel like a perfectly reasonable action movie that could totally happenand that's a good thing for the adventurous dumb-movie lover who doesn't mind a zany flick with a low budget and shamefully abundant past-gen CGI.

Now heroes, Tara Reid and Ian Ziering's (Beverly Hills 90210, Sharknado) returning characters are no strangers to the over-exposition that plagues Scy-Fy's movies-of-the-week, including Sharknado (""the first one""). But fret not, it's all in good fun and we don't get five minutes into the movie before paying homage to William Shatner's (or John Lithgow's) Twilight Zone short Terror at 20000 Feet! Even using the famous line ""There's something on the wing!!!!"" Only now..there are sharks on the wings of the plane! This is basically how I knew this would be worth a watch.that, and part one was bonkers amaze-balls fun!

Director Anthony C. Ferrante (Boo, Sharknado, Sharknado 3) lays on the stupid fast and heavyand by stupid I mean stupidly awesome! The utter bonkersness of this movie, by comparison, makes Snakes on a Plane (2006) feel like a perfectly reasonable action movie that could totally happen.

Is this movie fast paced? Well, it has plenty of slow parts where we are forced to watch the cast try to act their way through to the next scene. But when the action is happening all is forgiven, lots of funny dumb stuff happens, and festive CGI gore abounds.
Are the effects good? It's a ScyFy movie-of-the-weekso NO. No they're not. But the movie is still fun and there were some choice gore effects.

Is EVERYONE in this movie? Absolutely! Fantastic cameos include The Today Show's Matt Lauer and Al Roker, Kelly Ripa, ex-Sugar Ray singer Mark McGrath, scream queen Tiffany Shepis (The Hazing), Judah Friedlander, Billy Ray Cyrus, Perez Hilton, Vivica Fox (Kill Bill Vol. 1/Vol. 2, Independence Day), Judd Hirsch (Independence Day), Jared the Subway guy, Kelly Osbourne and Andy Dick.
Much to my surprise I must say this movie taught me a few things

1) Based on more than one scene I can safely say that the best way to fight a shark is with a baseball bat. That, and Ian Ziering has an amazing swing whether wielding a bat, chainsaw, fire axe, sword or that wooden thing they use to get pizzas out of a pizza oven. 2) Sharks hate physics and take every opportunity they can to defy its lame laws. As you watch this movie you'd swear the sharks were ""aiming"" themselves at their victims harnessing the propulsive force of the tornado. 3) Not only is Ian Ziering tougher than a CGI shark, but his butt is so rock hard that he doesn't even feel it when a baby shark is biting it! He probably taught The Rock how to be tough. 4) Judd Hirsch is actually Jason Voorhees! Bare with me for a second. Whenever you don't see him he transports unreasonable distances almost instantaneously and he's always where you least expect him. The only real difference is that there are no drug-using, fornicating teens around to trigger his urge to kill.

This movie is pure, mindless fun. Just watch it and stop being so judgy.",1410048000,,3118,4.786245353159852

Prepare to have your mind blown by even crazier stunts then the first one, like playing 'frogger' to jump across the backs of sharks to get to safety, getting a home run with a bat after smacking a huge shark with a baseball bat, and what can I say about freezing out a tornado full of sharks with a Freon Tank?! That is the greatest, most brilliant, most outrageous plan that I have seen on a Syfy movie yet! I cannot wait for the third one, and find myself wondering, how shall those crazy people at the Asylum top this one?! They make some of the most awesome comedies ever made!

The dialogue was horribly ridiculous. It's exactly what I expected! Five stars! Can't wait for ""Sharknado 3: The Third One""!",1407801600,4,285,5.085106382978723
6496334,4,B00LOCLDSG,"Stepping into Sharknado 2: The Second One, I anticipated an emotional rollercoaster ride flavored with a deep philosophical underpinning... Ha! This Syfy franchise sort of subverts things. Ideally, a great bad movie happens when the filmmakers are actually serious about their craft but proceed to wreck sh-- up, and so the laughs come unintentionally. Sharknado and its sequel are deliberately awful, which I suspect is kind of cheating. Somehow, the first Sharknado became a massively trending topic on Twitter. No flies on them unholy finks at Syfy who eyeballed the overnight cultural phenomenon and put in the order: ""Quick, make another!""

After Los Angeles, it makes sense that the sequel be staged in the city so nice they named it twice. It wasn't ever gonna be set in, say, Peoria, Illinois. Panicked citizens of the Big Apple must take cover when freak twin waterspouts in the Manhattan and East Rivers threaten to merge into one g0ddamn sharknadocalypse. Good thing that Fin Shepard (Ian Ziering) and April Wexler (Tara Reid), heroes of L.A.'s infamous sharknado, are enroute to New York (for a book signing of April's bestseller How to Survive a Sharknado). First, they must survive the deluge of airborne sharks that infests their Boeing 747. Right about now, a Samuel Jackson expletive is called for.

More or less safe on the ground, April and Fin make plans to combat the New York sharknados. Fin's got the added burden of safeguarding his sister (Kari Wuhrer) and his estranged brother-in-law (played by the guy from Sugar Ray) and their wussy son and out-of-shape daughter. And because unnecessary relationship drama goes hand in hand with disaster movies, Fin also runs into his high school flame Skye (Vivica A. Fox). Fin ends up in Skye's company more so than in April's, and this means less Tara Reid and we should be grateful.

I love how these movies embrace the absurdity of the premise. Even if you know nothing about these movies, you know sober reality's done a bunk when there's Kelly Osbourne cast as a flight attendant. There's no coherent plot or a need for one. We just want to see flying sharks munching on people as they run around helter skelter. Sharknado 2 was shot on site so there's the bonus of seeing iconic landmarks get the sharknado treatment. Skyscrapers, subways, sewers, ballparks - they become makeshift abattoirs; those dang sharks can seemingly get to anywhere, son! But because it's New York, we also get the denizens' show of bravado. Peep the mayor who brashly observes: ""This is the Big Apple: when something bites us, we bite back."" Oh, I really wanted that smug suit to bite it.

This isn't Jane Austen's Sharknado 2. But it IS a drive-in theater masterpiece. It's so goofy and campy and awful that it achieves a level of epic entertainment. Another title for this movie would've been Cameonado. Hollywood has-beens and z-listers dog the screen. Some of the cameos are a hoot: Robert Hays reprising his pilot role; Billy Ray Cyrus as a hillbilly doctor; and Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan taking out sharks that invade their studio. I have to laud the bravery and professionalism of Matt Lauer and Al Roker. As sharknageddon goes down, they keep The Today Show running and keep America updated. Roker's PhD in bu11sh-- movie meteorology comes handy as he explains the potency of the EF5 Sharknado; apparently it can do serious damage to steel-reinforced skyscrapers.

The CGI is crap. The acting is- hell, no one even bothers. Except maybe for Jared in his Subway product placement (yes, he's here). Anyway, it's as if the cast took a course at Tara Reid's acting school of stiffs. Trying to poke holes in the plot is like cheating on your blind, ugly wife. It's just too damn easy. The point is, you're not supposed to poke holes. Everyone is in on the joke, that this is purposely a crap film. And that's where the fun is. Sharknado 2 is to dumb excesses what Ash is to chainsaws. Which brings us to several moments in which it's pretty obvious Sharknado 2 is ripping off scenes from the Evil Dead flicks. Or as Sharknado 2's legal counsel would call it, ""paying homage."" Sharknado 2 is best watched in the company of intoxicated homies as you will laugh and laugh and mysteriously crave Subway footlongs.

Sharknado 2 also gives great shopping tips. I had no idea that napalm can be so conveniently purchased at the corner grocery store.

Biz Markie and Pepa have cameos, and I appreciate that this movie is doing its share to help 1980's hip hop artists stay off the streets. You, too, can make a donation at the ""Keep Our Old-Ass Emcees Under a Roof"" website.",1407715200,10,4622,4.81360201511335
6496335,4,B00LOCLDSG,"It's not for the faint of heart (don't know if I spelled that right, but then again, I'm writing a review for a sequel about Sharks being sucked up and flung from tornados), but if you loved the first one, you will love the ridiculousness in the second. This time, the sharks have been flung fromt the Atlantic Ocean (or the tornados have reached the other half of America), and it's up to Fin and April to stop the shock and awe of the Sharknados once again! Part of the plot in this movie (not really a spoiler, they mention it I think less than 3 times) is that Fin and April wrote a book on how to survive sharknados and other unnatural disaters. The book is actually available to buy online, it's cheap to buy (less than 414 I believe), and it's bigger (the length of the book) in real life than the movie. So but that if you want to pull a funny joke on friends, and to read about the other monsters and unnatural disaters that the SYFY channel offered from the past couple of years (includes Sharktapus, Dinoshark etc.). I loved the first movie, but even though I gave that one 5 stars (not on amazon, but I shall write a review on the site soon), there are some parts that were funnier to me from this courageous entry. I mentioned early that the movie takes place in New York, where I live (state wise). I've been in the city many times, and I do wish that I could've helped out with this movie (I'm a film major), it seems like all the actors in the movie are having fun just being ridiculous. But in all do respect, if we took this movie seriously, this is bottom of the barrell crap. The acting is bad, the effects are dreadful, and Sharks being flung from a tornado is just ridiculos...but that's what makes this movie fun. If you do but this movie, get a bunch of friends to come over and watch with you. It's very fun to see how others react to a movie, and this is one of those movies that give people priceless reactions. I am submitting this review as of 8/11/14, in ten days, Sharknado 2 will be screened at some theaters for one night only (fathom events)! If you have the chance to go to a theater and see this, go! Be part of the crowd, be part of the eperience, that is how people should take part in movies. Whether the movie is good or bad, there will always be a part of that movie that will stay with you. Sharknado 2 is a treat for those who are into so bad movies that they are good, and hopefully we can all have at least one good laugh after watching this.",1407715200,,2487,4.183333333333334
6496336,5,B00LOCLDSG,"The film opens with a scene Asylum borrowed from their other near block buster ""Airplane vs. Volcano"" as Tara Reid is dangled outside of a jet. She loses her hand, but don't worry. Despite the lost of blood and coming right out of surgery, she is ready to go looking like she just got out of make-up. The film take place in NYC, the NYC where accents are optional.

In this film the ""silliness"" and impossible scenes are amplified at the expense of any character build up, like the first film. Excuse me, but I liked the guy fighting sharks with his favorite bar stool. The success of the first film has brought out the ""D"" list of stars to play themselves which include: Al Roker, Jarred, Michael Strahan, Stephanie Abrams, Matt Lauer, Raphael Miranda, and Kelly Ripa.

I was wondering if there was some sort of inside joke with Fin (Ian Ziering). When he gets up from his seat in the plane he tells his wife, ""Watch my Place"" as if someone is going to take his chair. Then at the Mets game, people were wondering if he could find the seat even when he had a ticket with the seating number on it.

Robert Hays from ""Airplane"" plays the pilot who has ""seen worse.""When discussing the menu with the co-pilot, they agree to never eat the fish which BTW caused the epidemic in ""Airplane."" Judd Hirsch from Taxi plays a cab driver.

In NY, Fin is to meet up with his sister and her husband Martin and Ellen Brody- the names of 2 characters from ""Jaws.""

This film apparently takes place in some weird time period as the Met's afternoon game is going on at the time there is snow on the ground and the morning ""The Today Show"" is on.

When they go to destroy the tornado with gas cylinders a woman has a bag that reads ""YOLOBUS"" which is a California bus company that uses compressed natural gas.

In the airplane as Fin looks out, he reenacts the scene from the ""Twilight Zone"" where the guy sees the Flying Dutchman on the wing. In this tale, like that one, the pilots names are both Bill Wilson.

Silly enjoyable film.

The story line is so believable that you get sucked into it from the beginning and can't wait till the next twist and turn. The amount of cameo performances by actors or television personalities staggers the imagination...never have so many people done so much to aid a movie. Plus, with the blu ray expanded edition..well,I am on pins and needles waiting to see all the goodies.  I have thrown away such classics as GONE WITH THE WIND and CITIZEN KANE from my video library to place this masterpiece on prominent display when it arrives in October.
