1677341,5,B00005YURG,"This is quite possibly the best set of workout tapes I've tried.  Its difficult at first, but well worth the effort. In weeks I saw a difference in my abs, butt and thighs. My tummy is now toned and my thighs have great shape. Each dvd has 3 workouts that consist of 3 exercises, which are done in 3 sets.  I've found it best to do one workout of one tape, rest a day, one workout on another tape another day, etc. It keeps the variety and challenge to a good pace.  Each set is no more than 20 minutes. I've tried pilates, yoga and nothing has worked as great as this set! FEEL THE BURN!!",1069632000,20,589,4.060344827586207
1677342,5,B00005YURG,"i bought this for the work out not for the grinnig girls...and no they were not smiling and who would be this is not a ""keep on sliming gilrs"" type of work out..you get in there you warm up and then you do you work out...no the girls do not smile..if i was there i would not be smiling either they are there to be serious and get he job done...if you need a video with people fake smiling to get you going you need help...who cares how they look as long as the work out works..and this one does..i swear by it...but to burn fat you are going to have to do  that on your own as he clearly states in the dvd. i suggest a step work out or get a gazelle elite by tony litte to burn off the fat...good luck ladies!!!",1052265600,6,711,3.9034482758620688
1677343,4,B00005YURG,"I like this workout because it gives me the feeling as if I were in the gym. The girls in the video look great and give you something in which to aspire. Most often Brad can be annoying with his comments like ""you want to wear a belly ring"" or ""a great body isn't gonna come through osmosis you gotta work for it""(thanks for telling me Brad I thought it could be done through osmosis!). But if you can get past Brad and the 'so unhappy to be here' looks on the faces of his exercise assistants then you get a good body workout.",1036800000,37,527,4.076923076923077
7957191,5,B00005YURG,"I love the rotation and the fact that the workouts are short.

I do one every morning!
I feel great!",1382918400,,100,4.0
7957192,5,B00005YURG,"Let me get this out of the way.  There has been criticism about the choice of models - SO WHAT!  And I would say that at least 3 of them are definitely women.  One may or may not be, but again, so what!  This isn't a beauty contest.

This workout is TOUGH but it works.  Yes it WORKS.  I have done the ""abs"" part and that is really a killer one.  I am doing another abs one instead, with Meghan White ""Perfect Abs"" as it's only up to 10 mins long and is super intense but not like the Abs part of this one.

This is HARD WORK people.  But if you want SOME improvement in the cellulite areas you need to do these dvds.  I do feel there is improvement in those areas as I think I'm getting more muscular there and less fat.

I've had these dvds for years, and I did buy them from someone at amazon but I don't know if that will show up.  I have been doing this religiously for months now, and I am proudly up to 10 lb ankle weights.

You will definitely FEEL improvements after doing this for a while but you must be dedicated to it.  I've done it enough that now I put the dvds on and listen to the radio (garden shows, etc) and do it.  I like not thinking about it.

Again this will make you sweat BUCKETS, be prepared to work your a** off, and you know you want to do that!",1260662400,,1274,3.9140625
7957193,2,B00005YURG,This DVD set is ok if you already have a workout routine and want to supplement it with some new moves.  There are some new exercises but there are alot of traditional ones as well - this is good as a supplement.  It also isn't very good if you want a workout DVD to motivate you - the man in the video seems a little lecherous and he directs his models on how to do the exercises.  The models look like they are on drugs or they are robots - they don't smile and have this strange vacant expression on their faces.,1214611200,3,515,4.029411764705882
7957194,5,B00005YURG,"A few years ago I purchased these three exercises on VHS.  I decided it was time to update myself and get the DVD's.  I love these exercises because they are only 12 minutes in length and if you do them regularly you can see results.  Each section (Abs, Butt, and Thighs) has three different workouts.  They have demonstrations before the workouts to explain how each exercise should be done correctly.  With the DVD's you can skip these (demonstrations)if you know them.  During the workout they tell you how to make the exercises harder.  There is enough variety so that you don't become bored.  While the exercises are simple and old they are very effective.  You will need some leg weights, dumbbells, and a chair for a couple exercises.  Though most of these exercises are ones we have seen before having the instructor and the workout girls to do them with is helpful.  I tend to do a better job when I follow them than if I did these on my own.",1173916800,,951,4.502923976608187
7957195,4,B00005YURG,"I like the videos enough to use them fairly often.  I agree with other reviews in that the very arrogant instructor is extremely annoying with his constant commentary, but I am now to the point where I just mute the sound and listen to my ipod while doing the workout.  The girls are well toned, but they just look like 4 porn actresses working out with some cocky guy that's full of himself.  The girls look bored and unhappy.  But if you can get past that, the workouts are pretty good.  I do not agree that any one session is more difficult than the others.  I guess it depends on what you need to work on and how much weight you want to use.  You can get results if you  constantly challenge yourself and if you aren't afraid to get a bit creative with these workouts [within reason and still using proper form]. If you buy these videos, you may want to skip Brad's very cheezy introduction.  After watching it, I felt so very embarrassed for him and my stomach churned a bit, but if you can keep a very open mind and you are more interested in achieving results than feeling intimidated by the models' physical appearance, you can benefit from some productive exercises that you can do in your own livingroom without the cost of expensive equipment.  I use these workouts often, but I use many others as well [in all fairness, I get bored with the same workouts pretty easily], and let me just say that Gunnar Peterson in his workouts is so refreshing after listening to and looking at Brad.  And Gunnar doesn't act like some pimp taskmaster.  Brad is annoying, but then again, his videos are still selling and to be honest, they do work.  If you don't want to pick up the weights, you can achieve great results quicker than you realize and at the same time, shed the day's stress with Yoga Zone dvd's.",1145577600,3,1807,4.422960725075528
7957196,5,B00005YURG,"I really like these workout videos even though the workout models don't look happy at all...Not a smile in the house :-(  These series offer a great workout when you're crunched for time.  They're short, done in proper form, and very easy to follow.  On each video, there's three programs to chose from and each are only 12 min. long. Each level a little harder then the first.  Each program starts out with an optional demonstration of proper form.  (The Abs video focus totally on abs, the Thigh video focus totally on thighs, and the Butt focuses on just Butt workouts)  I wish there was a look great naked ""arms"" video, I'd buy it.  On each video, there's three different workouts per level, each done in three sets of 15 reps.  After every complete set (45 total reps), a stretch is done for muscle flexibility before starting the next set.  I almost forgot, there is a short warm up that I fast forward through because I warm up on my own cardio equipment.  Most videos are encouraging, motivational, and some are very inspiring, not this video.  Not once, on this video, does the women or the instructor, for that matter, crack a smile.  I will admit, the models suck, but, other then that, you've got yourself a great, all around, workout video set that's worth the money.",1124150400,9,1280,4.590308370044053
7957197,5,B00005YURG,"I first bought the ""Look Great Naked Abs"" video and since I saw results I decided to buy the DVD for butt and thighs. Although I am in good shape I still find them challenging when I add some resistance. Moreover, the way the workout is structured makes me feel more like I am in a gym. Who cares that the models are not smiling? Most people do not smile when they work out and I do not need cheesy fake smiles. Their great bods are definitely a motivation! I would definitely recommend these workouts!",1110758400,7,502,4.294736842105263
7957198,5,B00005YURG,"These routines are fantastic to do at home. I'm a workout fanatic and you will definitely see results if you follow through with these workouts. Of course, you need to be in some sort of shape as these exercise can be considered to be ""finishing touches"" to tone your physique. Every other day I do 1 workout from each dvd. You can go about 3 months without the ankle weights and the weight bar but incorporating them adds to the results.

Initially, I had borrowed these tapes from my best friend and when she asked for them back, I immediately ordered my own because I like them so much. I also got 2 of Brad Schoenfeld's books ""Sculpting her body perfect"" and ""Look Great Naked"" they are both very informative and helpful.

I was reading the other reviews about this workout routine about how the women are boring and how they look bored. They look like porn stars and looking at their bodies while I do these workouts serve to motivate me. It's the content that counts, who cares if the music is cheesy and the set looks stupid?",1096848000,8,1032,4.455026455026455
7957199,4,B00005YURG,"Yes, the models look like they are just going through the motions and don't want to be there, and Brad is checking them out, but who cares? They have great bodies, and that is why we all bought this video...to try and improve our bodies, look great in short-shorts, bathing suits and naked.  It is a very good and safe workout, emphasizing good form, goes quickly and can be easily adapted with heavier weights (I suggest using ankle weights that you can adjust the weights). I am using this to supplement a gym workout and cardio, and it is hitting the spots that some gym machines just don't hit.  I am in week two, feel like I am seeing results, and see myself keeping up with this workout.",1084924800,9,693,4.40625
7957200,2,B00005YURG,"Much as I would love to look like the girls in these tapes, I can't believe these workouts are going to get me there.  I did these routines pretty faithfully for over a month and see no difference ... probably because you barely feel anything when you do them.  Brad's chatter is awful, all geared to what you're going to look like rather than any kind of health improvement (and I really don't appreciate hearing a man talk about ""monthly bloat"").  Spending a little money on a better set and more than one camera (so that it's not just one angle for the entire routine) might have helped a bit, but still might not have been enough.  I have retired these as way too boring and not effective enough.  Sorry, Brad.",1075161600,17,714,4.419847328244275
