7977534,3,B00007K07W,"Problem is, this film came out six years after Morrison past away off the earthly scene.  It is an extremely bizarre, yet somehow entriguing tale that was quite ahead of its time in some aspects.  I could see any fan of The Doors totally being into this film, and one could swear that they could hear Jim Morrison singing and reciting his poetry in the numerous desert scenes.  What really seems like something directly out of a Morrison peyote trip is the rocks rolling across the desert.  Very, very trippy to say the least.  As I watch that scene, I was thinking that this would have been the perfect place for the film to start playing the Doors song ""The End"".  Would have been absolotely superb in that it would harmonize well the rocks mysteriously rolling across the desert floor.
With how intriquing this film is, there are numerous problems I have with it.  One of them is the above mentioned rocks in the desert scene.  The rocks rolling across the desert in itself was a superbly shot scene.  However, there's one major problem--the elderly couple don't act frightened at all and act as if it is an everyday occurrence!  I'm sorry, but if I were to see rocks tumbling at me in the desert I would be yelling my lungs out and screaming ""What the @&^% is going on?!?!""  You think that the old couple would be a lot more frightened, but weren't.  In fact, the old man simply yaws and says, ""I'll get my binoculars.""  Very poor acting, to say the least.  Also, the plot is just all over the place and completely incoherent.  What really is tragic about this is that this film had quite a bit of potential to be very fascinating and a well told story.  Just needed to be a bit more coherent with plot and dialogue.  Yet, I guess one is not going to get that from a shaman's peyote trip.  So, bottom line is, if you decide to skip this, you won't be missing much.  Although one might find the atmoshpere intriquing enough to keep from falling asleep.",1416528000,,1955,4.441011235955056
7977535,5,B00007K07W,"This is a weird movie about an archaeologist studying the culture of the ancient Hohokam Indians. She takes a (really fake looking) mummy out of a burial cave and brings it home to study it. Well, pretty soon she starts acting weird and talking to this mummy. And shortly thereafter her son becomes possessed by the spirit of the mummy. Even stranger events take place as the spirit then tries to destroy the woman's family.

Ahah! What is the secret of the mummy? Is the mummy's spirit angry that it has been removed from the cave? You may not be able to ascertain what the spirit's motivation is, but if you like spooky shenanigans on a low budget (and 70's hairstyles!) this will have a certain comforting appeal.

The way I have described the story is much clearer than the jumbled, boring way the film lays the story out. Can a boring movie really be fascinating? Well...somehow this one achieves that. Maybe this is a good movie at heart but executed in a rather awkward way. I don't know. What I do know is that I enjoyed it quite a bit.

Fans of ""Spider Baby"" will be interested to know that a couple of music cues from that film are used in this one (including an instrumental version of the theme song).

Featuring one frightening and fairly well-done sequence showing possessed boulders and rocks rolling around by themselves and eventually attacking some people in a camper. Other scenes in the movie are merely spooky or quirky; but this one scene is actually pretty scary.

See this! It's weird and it's worth your time. You might even want one on your shelf.",1267401600,5,1573,4.5836298932384345
