8577613,4,B00C6ATG3E,"Rose of Versailles Box Set 2 is a mixed bag.  There are 4 discs and a small art booklet with colored illustrations, character design model sheets from the original production and small interviews with the director and key animators. On the final disc there is an interview with the director of episodes 19 through 40, Osamu Dezaki.  The funny thing is, this interview is clearly not recent, and was done in France. There are French subtitles underneath the English ones, so it looks a bit odd to read. We even see a few clips from the French broadcast of the show while he talks. Interesting, hearing Oscar and Andre speaking francais!

The set starts with the infamous Necklace scandal and ends with Jeanne becoming a more tragic villainess.  Andre and Oscar deal with unrequited love and sexual frustration, to the point where Oscar says ""I'll go back to the days I believed I was a boy!"" in order to forget her broken heart.  Oscar is even drawn in a more androgynous way to reflect her change in attitude.  And Andre, after making a hideous mistake, decides to follow Oscar wherever she goes, like a shadow.

There are a couple subplots in the beginning here with the Black Knight and Rosalie being written out of the plot(though she has a few cameos later).

The second half of the set is rife with revolutionary politics. The episodes can drag on a big here.  The main thing is Marie Antoinette. She has little screen time, but her personality changes immensely. No longer highly emotional and drawn much older, the queen's pride is what makes Oscar abandon her duty to the Royal Family.  Antoinette's downfall makes one wonder:  was it arrogance brought about by being surrounded by shallow opulence, or just plain naivete that never made her realize how much she made the French citizens suffer so?  Either way, she becomes desperate to hold onto power. At least she finds some comfort in her final moments, remembering her female bodyguard.

As for the fate of Oscar and Andre, I won't spoil it here.  The final episode left me feeling either dissatisfied or depressed. But that's easily remedied by going back to the beginning with the first box set and episode one! (Go buy it now if you don't have it)

To quote Oscar's last words in the original manga:  ""Vive La France!""",1387929600,5,2284,4.701005025125628
