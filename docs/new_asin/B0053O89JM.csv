4534101,4,B0053O89JM,I wasn't sure if I would be watching this season after the torture of watching the last half of last season.  I decided to give this premiere a try and I am glad I did.  It is just House and no one does it better than Hugh Laurie.  Good solid episode to get back in the game.,1317859200,4,275,3.789473684210526

4534138,5,B0053O89JM,"As its hard to separate the seasons, I'll be posting a generic for all. House is a doctor who has more than a few issues, but is brillant so is allowed to get away with his rude, offensive, and at times, dangerous behavior. All this makes it so that the show never has a dull moment as the viewer isn't quite sure what House will do next or if he will be stopped in time. There are a lot of great moments and even for those who aren't fans of medical shows, this is still a show that should be checked out. It is not a family show as there is crude humor, but at least the viewer is never board.",1514160000,,595,3.925619834710744

4534179,5,B0053O89JM,"I am a huge fan of House. Since Netflix dropped the series (along with a bunch of other great ones), I bought the DVD. It's such a great season! It holds some of the most heart-breaking scenes in the entire series. I do miss Cuddy, of course, but Foreman is a decent foil for House's antics. The ending was surprising, but also deeply satisfying. If you liked the other seasons, definitely see this one.",1503532800,,403,4.45945945945946

4534219,3,B0053O89JM,"A lot of people have suggested that Season 8 is such a step down in quality from Seasons 1-7, that we'd be better off without it.  I partly agree; this season is no match for the prior seasons, and especially disappointing after a great Season 7.  However, if you can view these episodes with low expectations, there is still some enjoyment here and closure to the series.

The first 10 episodes of this season are especially bad and virtually worthless in the House canon.  House in prison in the first episode at least has a different setting than usual, but House acts inexplicably (even for him) stupid and childish, something which becomes a feature of this season.  Yes House has been immature and has done foolish things in prior seasons, but it seems to be a primary factor this season, right up through the final episode.  Instead of learning from his past, he seems to have regressed.  Or maybe the writers for Season 8 just don't see him the way he was viewed previously.

The first 10 episodes here are also too dark generally, including numerous affairs among married people, unexpectedly crude comments (from people other than House), extremely unpleasant situations (one diagnosis is that a father molested his own young son, giving him an STD), etc.  They also get very ""preachy"" about certain things such as keeping guns for personal protection.  It's as if the writers didn't know where to go, so they did the ""very special episode"" thing, also without enough of the humor that used to be part of the show.

In fact the writers seem to have lost track of the characters; there's a scene where Wilson is doing clinic duty and makes a crude but somewhat humorous comment about ""gold digging"" - this was obviously a scene written for House, but Hugh Laurie was presumably unavailable so they gave the scene to Robert Sean Leonard as Wilson.  Wilson would never have acted that way, and why would he be doing clinic duty at all?  Just part of the sloppiness of this season, especially the first half.  Then of course there's the character of Dr. Park, monotone and androgynous, the worst regular character in the series.  In the post-season interviews, actress Charlene Yi is a lot more dynamic and appealing than her character, so I'd have to blame the writers and directors for this too.

Thankfully the second half of the season keeps this from being a total waste.  Episode 11 (""Nobody's Fault"") is the first truly interesting one of the season, it's also fairly dark but very well done, and the episodes that follow through the end are mostly at least ""ok"" for House.  For the rest of the season, it's nice to see Foreman, Chase, and Taub mature, even though House does not (except perhaps for the very end of the last episode).  The last episode was a bit of a disappointment to me, until the last few minutes.  But the final two songs and scenes are very well chosen, and are likely to be greatly enjoyed by most House fans as a series conclusion.  Again, watch this season with diminished expectations, and it's somewhat worthwhile, especially the second half.",1496102400,,3082,4.712686567164179

4534418,5,B0053O89JM,"House was the perfect role for Hugh Laurie. While may shows lose their steam by season 8; House was a program I still rushed home to watch after a long day at the office. The faces on his team changed over the years; but Dr. House never did. Laurie's consistent portrayal of the irreverent, narcissistic, genius of a drug addict physician never ceased to amuse me. I particularly loved the push and pull of his relationship with Dr Wilson. The best of friends, who sometimes love and sometimes loathe each other. In the end, they ultimately end up dining on Chinese take out and scotch, quietly acknowledging that their differences are outweighed by their similar social dysfunction.",1461024000,,683,4.846153846153846

I felt the first season was just so so but I fell in love with the show because it was different.  Things improved around the end of Season 2.  Season 8:  I missed a certain character very much and I hated the first few episodes (boring, House seemed so weak, etc). The show became interesting (and entertaining) when another character from the past returned.  There are new cast members (didn't really care for them - I preferred the original cast).  Also, I agree with the reviewer who said wouldn't it be nice if we all had a friend like Wilson.

I love House the character (he's a very funny ass :p - every episode made me laugh out loud). I wish the series had ended differently (why do writers like sad endings??? *shakes fist* lol) but it is still one of my all time favorite shows.",1444608000,,911,4.292397660818714

On to season 8 & 7, i watched on dvd vs real time & did not enjoy it again for the above reasons: medical cases boring but side stories fantastic. Even w/ the new cast, house was enjoyable after the second or third time viewing. The word play was great even though somewhat predictable.

4535204,3,B0053O89JM,I've always been a House fan but I started watching it on TV in the middle of the 3rd season so instead of watching in the middle I just bought each season as it came out. Season 1-3 are the best because I got addicted to the show because of all of the medical mysteries and just a little bit of outside drama. Season 4 all the original doctors in training aren't around much at all and there's a whole new group and not a lot of medical mysteries. Seasons 5-8 are even worse. They're mainly all drama and the last episode of season 8 I was really disappointed. I won't say what drama there is or the ending I just hope it'll be like the X-Files and they're make a movie later.,1408320000,,677,4.097744360902255

May have missed more than that.  Also, the disc was delivered days late.  That is it was to be delivered in a a time frame and it was days later after the latest date to be delivered.  The season was very good, but I give only two stars due to late delivery and especially that disc four was messed up and a decent portion of one of the episodes cannot be viewed.

House has certainly had its lulls and highs as a season and I can't deny that, but I have found I have overall enjoyed each season for what it brought to the table. This season however was unrealistic, the newest addition to the team is horrible and the end is just plain cliche. Though I did appreciate what happens to chase in the end, who, despite my love/hate for him, became one of my favorite characters. Honestly I would have ended the series on 7.

4535638,5,B0053O89JM,"Without a doubt, the best medical drama ever on television, or even on film.  It skillfully combines precision and unusual diagnostic medicine with the Human Equation.  Other medical shows typically neglect the medical aspect, and focus on the soap opera love interests of the hospital staff; but House delivers Medical School level academics, along with the drama seen in only the best of literature - the unexpected, realistic, and non-linear events we all have in our lives, rather than the mundane writing of hacks who are pandering to what the TV executives think will sell the products of their advertisers.  House is tantamount to The Sopranos, in its approach and methodology, and the true swings from the gritty to anguish and from transient humor back to despair, rarely - if ever - seen in the media, yet ever present in the daily reality of life.  House makes the so-called Reality Shows look stupider and more contrived than they actually are.  House hinges somewhere between a documentary and a true masterpiece of the art of film.  This is not a must see, or a summer blockbuster, but a treasure that will reside in the archives of the consciousness of all who embrace it.",1385683200,2,1187,4.851485148514851

Another season of an all time great series and character (actually several) Obviously, Gregory House but also, I put James Wilson in my pantheon of all time TV characters as well. The show just wouldn't have had the impact and Laurie wouldn't have been able to show as many of those glimpses of humanity without Robert Sean Leonard's excellent portrayal of Wilson.

""House"" raised the bar impossibly high, and few shows can ever measure up. It's astonishing how good the show really was, and how often it hit its target. The DVDs make it possible to really analyze every element in detail. From the acting to the sound effects, this was fine American craftsmanship at its very best. (And yes, I know Hugh Laurie is British. All the more impressive.) When it comes to broadcast television, it doesn't get better than this.

I purchased the seasons separately rather than as an entire set, having read that the quality of the bundle left something to be desired. After a monumental ""House"" marathon -- eight glorious seasons viewed commercial free -- I can say that the quality of the DVDs is exceptional. The picture and sound are crystal clear.

4535894,4,B0053O89JM,"With well writing and good plot lines house moves like a train. I did notice a change after the 8th series, the intensity was not there as before. I don't know what changed, directors or writers, but that on the edge of your seat action was gone. This 8th season house did move like a medium train instead of the House series before, which moved fast.",1373760000,,351,4.333333333333333
4535895,4,B0053O89JM,"House is on the books for me as one of the best TV dramas of our time.

David Shore is a master at delving into the psyche of each character, telling stories of interesting patients *and guest stars and crazy illnesses, and trying out different points of view as the seasons' progressed.

Season 8 was the only season that I don't give 5 stars to: Olivia Wilde, Dr. Cuddy, and Dr. Cameron are all off the show.  I feel like Cuddy was one of the characters that really kept the show alive. Olivia Wilde was an excellent addition. And Dr. Cameron although in and out of the later seasons, still was one of the original characters. So in Season 8 we are left with none of the original female characters which gave balance to the leading males of the show.

I think the new Asian doctor is funny at times but the other one is nothing more than eye candy and lacks the intensity that Olivia Wilde brought to the show.

I haven't finished the season yet- so I'm hoping that they bring some of these gals back for the season finale!

Farewell House- What an amazing run!",1373500800,,1063,4.343434343434343

In the last Episode when House is in the burning building trying to decide ""to be or not to be"" Cuddy should have been one of his visitors.

4536460,5,B0053O89JM,"...that hasn't been said by better writers in better reviews?

It was never about the medicine for me. I never cared very much whether the medicine or medical procedures were accurate. I'm not a doctor of any kind so even some glaring mistakes probably flew by me unnoticed. I usually didn't care overly much about the guest patients or their illnesses, either, although there were a few I liked. I also liked only 2 or 3 of the diagnostic team members enough to be interested in their own separate stories, but more often than not I resented the times when a supporting character was featured because more of ""them"" usually meant less of Hugh Laurie. And that's what it was always about for me: watching Hugh Laurie blow my mind week after week, year after year, playing THAT character. The only other actor/character icon I can think of that was as big and impressive was Alan Alda playing Hawkeye Pierce in the '70's. And frankly, I think Hugh is the better actor; Hugh was actually creating a character that was NOT like Hugh Laurie in any respect. Alan Alda as Hawkeye, by about the 3rd or 4th season of M*A*S*H, was basically playing himself under the name ""Hawkeye Pierce.""

I will miss watching Hugh play House. I will certainly look forward to watching Hugh play other characters in other projects, and I will relentlessly hunt down every recording of every piece of music he's ever played, but I will miss watching him create House.",1359072000,8,1442,4.673228346456693

4536660,3,B0053O89JM,"I don't have a racial axe to bear but I did think I might point out that the writers of House Season 8 left Omar Epps/Dr. Eric Foreman in charge. When all was lost and after the series-- the writing and the stories--- had gone into the crapper, then a black man was left in a position of authority. I'm not bothered by this and I don't think it was planned but if I was a black person looking for a chance to gripe then I might have noticed this. By season 8, oh hell, let the black guy be the head honcho. The show was by then scheduled for cancellation. Lisa Edelstein/Dr. Cuddy the old boss of Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey, was gone. In fact Edelstein's character was so far gone to where she wouldn't even make a cameo in season 8. If I was a critic I might think that Edelstein  didn't want to be associated further with a show which had become a joke and if not a joke but a caricature or a shadow of itself. Season 8 had no future, it was all about the exit plan.

Season 8 is marred with so many episodes of some patient spitting up blood. And then there was the paralysis of what seemed like every other patient. Then there were the mindless and pointless head games that House played with himself and with his staff of doctors. Greg House just came off as some sort of crank, some sort of nutjob who was constantly acting like a nutjob because he could, because he was a brilliant doctor. And because Greg House was a brilliant doctor the hospital was going to bend over and give the man everything that he wanted like a wall that lifted up so he could see his buddy Dr. James Wilson/Robert Sean Leonard. And because House was brilliant the hospital tolerated it when he shot at his doctors with a paint gun, a squirt gun, when he tossed soda balloons, when he stole an expensive medical machine. The hospital also tolerated his war with the prosthetics department, and as House interviewed prostitutes. The prostitute idea and theme was in bad taste in other seasons but was over developed and overdone to adnauseum  last season. But once again people who tolerated Greg House had to sit through more of this. But in season 8 House just went nuts as he tried to strangle a patient which became just another behavior that one must tolerate when in the company of a brilliant doctor.

In this last season the writers saw the exit of Dr. Pretty Boy Chase played by Jesse Spencer. I was glad to see Dr. Pretty Boy leave because as a mediocre boy I get my fill of these perfect sexy guys that get all the girls in real life and on tv. Of interest this season was Charlyne Yi, who played the Asian Dr. Park. I at least found her to be entertaining even though she didn't have a future on the show. And finally for Season 8 Dr. James Wilson developed cancer and after failing chemo therapy was left with about 5 months to live. Greg House goes out and takes heroin with a patient. He wakes up in a burning building, which is on fire and he has visits of dead or previous doctors from the hospital. Greg House supposedly dies in the burning building. But, SURPRISE, the burned dead body was not Greg House but it was his patient. Apparently all you have to do is to switch dental charts of a person and you have successfully faked your own death.

So it is in this unbelievable scenario that Greg House takes off and onto the road with James Wilson via motorcycles.

My problem is the ending was a joke and it just couldn't hold up to any scrutiny. And long gone was most any respect that many of us had for the character of Greg House. Greg House showed himself to be a selfish, egocentric JERK. And I think it was sad and rather telling that James Wilson rode off into the sunset with House the idiot. Really, was House any kind of a friend and if so did James Wilson really respect him and if so why?

A lot of us in the real world have problems but we don't start going to prostitutes, drugs, alcohol, etc. Many of us are also smart but we don't ruin the lives of everyone around us just because we are so brilliant. I'm sure a lot of brilliant men and women brought a lot of people into their lives of pain but never perhaps in the history of television was their ever such an indulged and self absorbed character who had so many people bending over and bowing down to his eccentric behavior. Greg House might as well have been King Greg House. I mean this character was allowed to do just about anything that he wanted. Thus the stories just became more and more RIDICULOUS over time.

I used to respect the show but now I'm just glad that it is off of the air. And Season 8 was as others called it, A MISTAKE.

Lisa Edelstein, kudos to you and your character for not coming back in season 8, the worst season of House.",1356912000,,4759,4.29064587973274

I've not seen a side of House quite like that before.  The ending was a little ""cheesy,"" but overall I highly recommend this series.  There will never be a Dr. House on TV again.

4536758,5,B0053O89JM,"So sad to see the series to come to an end. It is hard to believe that they ran 8-seasons. I was going to say this season was very odd, but then again aren't all seasons of House odd. You have your usual pure comedy episodes, more series and some that are little depressing, but then that is what makes House so great. Cuddy is out the picture now and Foreman is in charge of the hospital. We see the return some of our old favorites and introduce a couple new people to the team. Without giving much away, I will say the last few episodes are incredible and debunks the assumption that House is selfish and only cares about himself as you will see with the extreme sacrifices he will make to be able spend time with and help Wilson. Yet, he is still up to his usual antics this time at the expense of Foreman. I have the past 7 seasons on DVD and am glad to be able to have the complete series.

If you liked Housed then you would want to buy the DVD for your collection. Season eight gives you the Swan episode that was the behind the scenes of house and all the work that went into making the show awesome.

All of them take a LONG time to load - so I'm not sure if all of them are a little defective or it's some copy protection thing they put on them that my player doesn't like.

Losing Cuddy and ""13"" seemed to remove distractions that made the show a disappointment in Seasons 6-7, and it is good to have new fellows as doctors with a fresh point of view on diagnostics and dealing with Dr. House who now has some restrictions on his ability to go crazy, and I think will make this season more believable.

House seems to be back to his pill-poping self, but clearer thinking and slightly more aware of the rest of humanity.  I think Dr. Foreman moving to Dean of Medicine was a good move and places that role more in perspective.

Having viewed the entire season 8, I enjoyed all except for the ending where Dr. House seems to ""throw in the towel"" when he usually would have found a way out, avoiding as much pain as possible, and still continue his struggle for truth and something greater than himself and his own interests.  Like all good shows, they never seem to have good endings.",1351900800,2,1160,4.4739336492890995

Like people have mentioned what he did in the finale was the most selfless act a person could do. He loved his job. I think what he loved was the challenge of it. To just drop everything and walk away would be unimaginable for most people.

4537089,4,B0053O89JM,"The main issue I had with season 7 was the same issue I had with the first part of this season. The writers began focusing so much on the stories of the main characters, that they didn't spend time on the cases. Instead, the cases seemed to be an afterthought, just tacked on to keep the long time faithfuls (like myself) on board. Though this season wasn't the train wreck season 4 was, we do get back on track somewhat, as long as you can suspend your belief somewhat.

I'll explain that last statement. A doctor has a nervous breakdown, does to prison, and is out on parole. How is it possible to renew your medical license at that point? While still on parole? I understand that the hospital made a deal with the prison, but the American Medical Association wouldn't have allowed that. Not to mention malpractice insurance nightmares. And when House has the new girl on board, she starts actually assisting and doing procedures while not being officially employed by the hospital (which means legally she would have to be a resident or employee and have malpractice insurance). But the series has never really been authentic in those aspects, though the cases tend to be more realistic, and often based on real life medical facts. The space age lung machine? It's real. Though it's a dome shape, not square. I guess they had to do square to keep from having the film crew reflected in the dome.

The first two episodes are tortuous for a long time House fan. They tend to be off in the more 'mainstream' drama realm. Hugh Laurie even seems to be phoning it in during these first couple. And once House is practicing again, we see the constant threat of 'go back to jail'. It gets kind of off putting. Once he loses the ankle bracelet I wanted to scream with relief. But even then we still get Foreman and others threatening House every 10 minutes or so.

Taub gets more interesting in this season, which is great since I've always kind of liked him. We also get two new doctors, one annoys me nonstop (Adams - not a good replacement for Olivia Wilde - sorry), the other is more realistic as a doctor (Park - aka Bookie Monster - you'll see). There is an incident with Chase about midway through, and I was really kind of put off by that story arc (again going with the more mainstream drama events). It never quite gets melodramatic though. Not Gray's Anatomy area anyway.

It's fitting end to the series, and though it has it's ups and downs, it still resembles the show it started as, which is uncommon nowadays. Though seasons 1 - 3 were rock solid, seasons 5 - 8 have been good, though not without their ups and downs. This series is still more realistic in the medical cases than ER was or Gray's Anatomy.

Understandably shows tend to get more involved with their characters as the series progresses. It is the only reason I find seasons 1 -3 better than the rest. Still great drama, but just a little too much personal 'drama' in later seasons.

Oh, and the constant Ford promos get very irritating. When a character says ""Hey, don't take these corners that fast"" and the other answers ""It's okay with this car's new something something handling system,"" yeah, it's lame. Or the zoom in on the dashboard of Wilson's Ford. And always a big shot of the Ford logo. These scenes are unnecessary and actually serve to put a big brake on the flow. So much that each time I was tempted to turn off the show.

----

There are a few nice special features at the end of the series worth watching. There is a little video montage by Laurie which is quite fun.",1346803200,,3559,4.489953632148377
4537090,5,B0053O89JM,"The final season of House really surprised me in a pleasant way.  The start was so good, as we focused on House.  The last few episodes weren't quite as good, but they at least focused on the two main characters, House and Wilson.  That recognized that in the end, Wilson was right up there with House in importance.  I found the finale to be OK.  I liked the end, but the lead up didn't do much for me.  Still, when a great show ends, I don't have much hope for the last episode, so I can't complain too much.

I felt bad for Adams.  She was an interesting character, until the writers felt the need to turn her into Cameron Jr.

When I see a doctor I want it to be somebody who cares, and who doesn't guilt me for being sick; whatever the choices I have made.

The wife on the other hand loves the cheap drama and the suspense. As a professional person, I don't think this is a realistic story that could happen in the medical community.",1345680000,,458,4.088888888888889

The addition of Dr. Adams(Odette Annable) and Park(Charlyne Yi) as the two new doctors were welcome. I'm gonna come right out and say it:I was OK with Lisa Edelstein leaving the show. A small but vocal  group of fans has made their feelings known about how Edelstein was written out of the show- and about  Annable and Yi. This is Season 8, not Season  7.

There were big changes(the season starts with House  in prison,which is where he meets Dr. Adams. You were never quite sure where they were going to go with plot lines, but..they worked(if anyone was *start spoiler alert* going to get cancer..I thought it would be House. Kinda out of left  field for  Dr. Wilson(Robert Sean Leonard) to be  the one who does *end spoiler*

Other plot lines like  Chase's stabbing in Nobody's Fault are not dropped  suddenly-he didn't have an instant recovery like  how it is in some medical dramas where a doctor gets injured and they're fine the next week(I'm looking at YOU, Chicago Hope).

House  has always been able  to get good guest  stars(especially memorable this season? Battlestar Galactica's Jamie Bamber and  Medium's Jake Weber, as well as Billy Connolly as House's stepfather.

Admittedly I was nervous about how they would end House. I hoped they wouldn't go for the lame, ""blowing up the hospital"" ending. They didn't. That's  how Grey's Anatomy will end, with all likelihood. No,House got it SO right. I mean, if I had been writing the final episode, that is exactly the  ending I would have written. It was perfect. It allowed the audience  to make  up their  own mind about what happened to the characters(though House and Wilson's fates were  far more ambiguous than the rest.)",1345593600,,1858,4.767295597484277

4537180,2,B0053O89JM,"After having watched season eight, I was thoroughly disappointed. The caliber of writing was dumbed down to cheap jokes, hookers and lost the intelligence and brilliance that once made this aging show shine. Storylines were not followed through properly or were just hastily dropped. As much as I love Hugh Laurie, he just wasn't given the material this season to really showcase his acting capabilities as had been the case in previous seasons, even ""Twenty Vicodin"" fell short of that goal. The arc at the end of the season was overplayed and overamplified in a last ditch attempt to add some melodrama. What made it more disappointing was that it focused more on Wilson than House, which was off-putting as the show crawled to a close.

I did make a valiant effort to try and embrace the changes (both the expected and unexpected)but something continued to feel off for me.(The loss of Lisa Edelstein as Cuddy was a presence very much missed and basically served as the giant elephant in the room for the entire season.) The show just lost its overall spark and appeal and fell terribly short for me. The new characters added to this season reduced the show to an unfortunate grade of ""C"" in my opinion, as Charlene Yi's lack of acting abilities were blatantly obvious and Odette Annable's inability to add nothing of substance to her character was just frustrating. There were a few good episodes in the bunch, but overall it was a lackluster season. Even the finale was a bit of a disappointment as it was far from an original concept.(Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be shaking his head.) It was almost a recycling of previous ideas the show displayed to garner interest with the addition of borrowing a page from the writer of Sherlock Holmes himself. Frankly, I found the retrospective ""Swan Song"" to have been far more interesting than the finale. Of course, Hugh Laurie produced the retrospective so there was no surprise that it would be better than the finale.

This will be the first season season set of the series that I don't jump to buy right when it's released. I'll probably wait a year when the price drops drastically to what the season was really worth and even that will still be more than I'm willing to pay. Alas, I have all seasons though and I'll probably complete the set without ever opening it or watching it, because there is nothing worth re-watching in season eight for this avid viewer. It's sad, because I was addicted to this show and loved it so much. Unfortunately, the ""House"" began to crumble mid-season seven and collapsed completely in season eight.

4537219,4,B0053O89JM,"The long-running medical drama's final season picks up with House facing the consequences of Season 7's destructive act against his ex-girlfriend Dr. Lisa Cuddy -- he's in prison, where we learn he's been the better part of the last year.

Although House is no longer a doctor, his basic nature means he's unable to stay away from puzzles, especially when they concern medicine -- meaning, House is a frequent visitor to the prison clinic. In the season premiere, ""Twenty Vicodin,"" Dr. Jessica Adams (Odette Annable) is a bit wary at times, but despite the reasons for House's being there, Adams quickly deduces that this man is a medical genius from whom there's lots to learn.

After much wangling on the part of House's former team member Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) - who is now the Dean of Medicine, taking over for Cuddy - House is able to work at the hospital again. The only problem is, he no longer has a team - during the past year, everyone scattered to other parts of the hospital. Foreman also refuses to give House a departmental budget. But of course, being House, neither is much of an obstacle for him. He lures Adams away from her prison job to come work for him for free (for the time being), and also acquires Dr. Chi Park (Charlyn Yi), a hesitant young Asian woman who seems to have lost favor in her old department due to a surprising act, and now needs to find another position ASAP.

After a time, House also persuades his old team members Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) to return.

Karolina Wydra also returns as House's green card wife Dominika, the two forging something like a real relationship as they get caught by immigration officials and must live together to convince everyone of their sincerity.

After several seasons where Chase was almost part of the background, it was refreshing to see the charismatic Australian land a few meatier stories throughout the season, including a strange but intense relationship with an ailing young nun, and a patient who attacks him with a knife and nearly kills him, causing serious physical damage and some emotional, as the experience forces Chase to really think about his life.

But in the end, House's entire existence always boils down to one thing -- his longtime best friend Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard). Throughout all of House's madness, the long-suffering Wilson has been the voice of reason, and on occasion, his partner in crime. No matter who else comes or goes in House's life, he can always count on Wilson to be the one solid and consistent. Yet a shocking development suddenly rears its ugly head in the final episodes, and House is forced to confront the possibility that he may indeed be alone in the end. Can House possibly survive? Or, the bigger question seems to be, would House even WANT to?

While viewers have voiced all sorts of opinions and speculations about this final season, and largely the very end depicting House's future, one thing is certain -- this show is one that won't be forgotten any time soon.",1339718400,29,3059,4.738721804511278

Likewise I have been a fan of House since the Pilot. I own the first seven seasons on DVD and watch them off and on even still.

Having said that I did not enjoy the slow death of House which is what Season eight seemed to be.
The final shot of Season seven, on the beach (is that a spoiler?) was, to my mind a perfect ending to this show. it is in the way I see the character. How Dr. House would have exited.
From the beginning of Season eight I was personally not entertained much. there were sections here and there but overall the shows seemed more stand alone than any other season.

I felt the writing was poorer, like the writers either were new and didn't understand the core of the characters or just had no direction.
None of the characters seemed to be themselves. The prison shows being the worst, but in general House being a caricature of House rather than the character I had grown to know. I seriously missed Olivia Wilde. Her character had become so three dimensional in the preceding seasons.

However, one caveat to that is the character of Chase. His personal arc thru this season was surprisingly deep. He seemed to mature as a person. And it seriously only just struck me now as i type this.

Of the others; Foreman, Taub, and Wilson seemed wooden, like furniture on the set. Parks and Adams seemed to be mostly as people to play off of rather than develop.",1339632000,4,1540,4.3

It is his one true love who saves him. Wilson must deal with death. House kills himself. I will leave it to you to discover if a pulse remains. An obituary for the character of Greg House would consider his jerkdom having to take him to prison. Society's ultimate sanction. I would say being free brings an inner peace. Solving problems is his reason for living. A place for his wild spirit to anchor its creative talent. Sherlock Holmes indeed.

4537260,5,B0053O89JM,"I am going to write two reviews. One will be spoiler-free. The other will delve into the final season of this amazing series.

Spoiler-free:

How do I sum up a show that has influenced me so greatly without giving anything away about the finale, or the episodes that lead up to it? I think the answer lies in House as a character. I have to assume if you are reading the review for the final season of a show that has had eight, that you are at least somewhat familiar with it. I am going to assume that because there is no way to talk about the character as a whole without going over the past seasons. I will not spoil eight at all, but I will talk about seven in this review, and how it ties into eight beautifully.

So, here we go. House is as damaged as a character comes. He has tried to find love, with Stacy in season two, and Cuddy in season seven. Some can argue there was even something between he and Cameron in the first season. House is capable of love. He loves more than most do, but in a way that is guarded behind cynicism, sarcasm, and avoidance. He sabotages every relationship. Cuddy made his fears come to life in ""Bombshells"", the season seven episode. It ultimately leads to what many call the ""jump the shark moment"". House drives his car through her living room. To me it was brilliant, and completely in character.

What the season seven finale left were a lot of questions. Many felt like the House they had watched over the years would never have done something so destructive. Season eight had to be about redemption. And my fellow fans, the writers hit it out of the park. He paid the price for the crash. Due to a negotiation fall out Lisa Edelstein's final scene in the show was last season, after House gives her the hair brush back. And, in my opinion, it was the perfect exit for her character. But, that doesn't change the fact that the act of last season made many find House's character had gone too far.

Season eight is all about new beginnings, but at the same time falling back into old habits. The first episode is about paying the price for crashing his car into her home. The episodes that follow slowly peel back layers of House we haven't gotten to see before. His redemption comes in paying high prices. The final four episodes of this season are some of the best of the series. The final arc is the one that really challenges House. It makes him show love in a way we knew he was capable, but haven't seen before. To me Wilson has always been the left foot to House's right. So many people talk about Cuddy as House's love. Whatever place she did have, she gave up when she toyed with him. Wilson has always been House's deepest love. They have a friendship that has survived betrayal, (Wilson in season three's, ""Merry Little Christmas"") death, (Amber in the season four finale ""Wilson's Heart"") and House's countless acts of self destruction. For House, his love is not Stacy, Cameron, or Cuddy. His love is Wilson: A friend that has been there through the worst of it all and hasn't abandoned him. It is completely fitting and fantastic that the last four episodes focus on House and Wilson. And the finale is one of ultimate sacrifice. It is House's redemption, and ends this series in the best way possible.

Spoiler review:

This is for those who have watched the whole final season, the finale and all.

Let's begin. The price House pays for the car crash is a year of prison. The episode does a wonderful job of setting the stage for what the final season will be. He has paid his price, and now is released under Foreman's watch on parole. House's office has been shut down, and turned into a whole other ward. Foreman is now dean. Two new doctors join his team. Throughout the season, House slowly earns his office back. His team is Chase, Taub, Park, and Adams. It's about rebuilding. Season eight has a first season feel, and I love it. I feel like we now know what Wilson talks about in the first season: House pining over Stacy for five years; us meeting him as he starts to pick himself back up again. Wilson talks about how he was there when House got really bad. I feel like the seven seasons were us watching him slowly get back to that dark dark place that Wilson talks about in the first season. And so it is very fitting that the final season is about him starting over again. We have come full circle, and season eight is the only place House could have ended. Because, this time, he changes himself.

The final arc was beyond brilliant. It was heartbreaking in its irony and eye opening on so many levels. Wilson has cancer. Not like Cuddy last season where it was a close call. He has a stage 2 thymoma that has invaded the tissue around his thymus. There's a seventy five percent chance of beating it, which also means there's a twenty five percent chance of not. The final four episodes are about House and Wilson. The arc starts with a radical treatment that doesn't work, until it soon becomes about accepting the final five months House has with his best friend. In the penultimate episode ""Holding On"", a small prank from House becomes his downfall. As he has begun to accept that he has five months left with Wilson, the small prank comes back to bite him. He has to go back to jail for six months; Wilson only has five to live. I entered the series finale feeling a sense of dread. After all, its titled ""Everybody Dies"", and there is absolute truth in it. But, the finale was the most fitting one I can dream up. Kutner, Amber, Stacy, and Cameron all came back as different parts of his subconscious, convincing him that there was more to him than the medicine, or his friendship with Wilson. Convincing him that he'll be okay even when his friend is gone. It was incredible. I used to think the only way for House to end would be for him to die. And he did, but not the man, the identity of House. He faked his own death, destroying any chance of practicing medicine again, just so he can spend Wilson's last five months with him.

You wanted redemption. There it is. And in a scene I never thought I would see, House and Wilson ride off on motorcycles, starting their last five months together. It's as happy of an ending that a show like House can have. In his own way, House did get to ride off into the sunset. Amazing. Inspired. Incredible. There will never be another show like House.",1337644800,166,6374,4.407816482582838

I love this show and will always be a fan of the series, but it has continuously been going downhill and I must admit has not been on my favorites list. Although ""HOUSE, M.D."" had a great run, I felt it lost everything that once made it such an outstanding show... a couple seasons ago.

Aside from the previous comments, I will miss this show for three reasons. One being, it was once a spectacular series and it's sad to see it end without returning to its original glory. Two, the interaction between House and Wilson has always been a big highlight of the show, to me. Lastly, I will miss Hugh Laurie. I feel no one could have played a better Dr. Gregory House.

All and all, I recommend season eight if you are a fan and want to follow the show until the end.",1337558400,34,811,4.219354838709678

4537265,3,B0053O89JM,"CAUTION: THIS MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER. TREAD EXTREMELY CAREFULLY IF YOU NEVER SAW A COMMERCIAL, READ AN ARTICLE OR SAW ANY PRESS ABOUT THE FINAL SEASON OF THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. YOU MAY RETURN TO READING.

The formula to this show started to wear extremely thin in the seventh season, but they energized it with the romance between House and Cuddy. The bravura episode when Cuddy was potentially dying (because everyone close to House HAS to be near-death at one point so that he can help them) that Hugh Laurie himself directed was probably the best episode this show's ever had. Sadly, just a few episodes later, he crashed his car through Cuddy's dining room and started this season in prison. Honestly, this whole final season would have been much more daring and interesting if House had to stay in prison.

Alas, Fox didn't think that was too good of an idea because, if time teaches anything in regards to television, you HAVE to stay formulaic and predictable.

Aside from the addition of Odette Annable and Charlene Yi as the beautiful wealthy-but-feels-bad-about-it and quirky-yet-plain-jane doctors respectively, there is literally no new ground to cover. The team gets an unusual case that somehow ends up playing as a metaphorical subplot to the episode; House plays mind games with the team; the cure is magically discovered with 6 minutes left in the episode.

However, the show still remains somewhat interesting because the ensemble plays it well. Hugh Laurie, though, is starting to look tired of this character and that sometimes comes across.

The best but possibly also the worst thing about this final season is the friendship between House and Wilson. Robert Sean Leonard always works, but they might have gone too far this time. Near the end of the season, it's discovered that Wilson has cancer. The next couple of episodes deal with that news and a possible cure. This brings them closer, but will Wilson survive?

This is the kind of hack plotting that I would expect from ER or GREY'S ANATOMY, but the Ratings Gods demand that you CANNOT FOOL WITH FORMULA. It worked for big ratings for those shows. Why not here, especially since this season had its lowest ratings yet?

That should tell Fox something: You can't beat a dead horse (or House... UCWIDT?), so you should start running something with more life. Not that they should have just axed the show, but they could have really played with this season and made it interesting and compelling instead of trite, rote, and dull.

It's also a conundrum when you've got a series finale where the one person in the world who House cares about is perhaps dying or dead. This does NOT feel like something that this entire show has been building up to, especially when it happens so late in the season.

But this entire season has been a miscalculation of potentially epic proportions, and I would only recommend watching to die-hard fans of this show, which I doubt there are many left.",1336435200,10,2978,4.823529411764706
4537286,5,B0053O89JM,"This was fitting for a near to end episode of House.  If anything was going to touch House's heart, it was the prospect of losing Wilson to cancer.  As he sees cancer specialists with Wilson, it fast becomes apparent that they will go it alone together on chemotherapy as Wilson wants the most toxic chemo treatment available.  Fittingly, House decides to hold this at his apartment.  This is so compelling that the remainder of the episode, while interesting, is certainly of lesser interest.  It is about a child with a rare genetic disorder with a doctor mother who has used her as a guinea pig in her experimental drug program, until the child collapses while out with her father. The rest of the team must cope with this as House isn't even taking phone calls as he treats Wilson. This episode returns the series to the caliber of its earlier seasons.

4537347,4,B0053O89JM,"It's still a great show. House is a fantastic character whom is deeply developed through the writing. He is still somewhat unpredictable, so that's pretty impressive!
This season features a bit less drama than last season and some more medical diagnoses.
House actually is less seen in this season, but it's enjoyable. They really have a fully developed team of characters. For example, recent episodes focus more on Chase. He may be a bit one-dimensional often but they really made him quite a bit more interesting in these episodes.

Here are some frustrations of mine:

He uses the same diagnoses a lot. This season, look for tertiary syphilis. It's the new lupus. The symptoms are very wide, so it makes for a great plot development. It's kinda a House diagnosis, because it involves sex and guilt and all that that House would berate the patient for.
Some of the medical diagnoses are also extremely off, even to someone who doesn't know much about medicine. For example, on a 45 year old white man he gave a diagnoses that is only really common among Southern Asian children of the ages 2-5. Of course, it is a drama, not an educational show, but if a college student can spot things wrong with this show, it takes away from it.
Sometimes, they go away from the patient for an extremely long time to follow some dramatic twist. Sometimes, the show has little to do with the patient or anything medical.",1329523200,3,1408,4.696356275303644

Well written with unexpected twists and turns, incredibly well acted and excellent cinematography (although still too dark).  Jesse Spencer, (Dr. Chase) really is showing his acting talent in this episode - in prior seasons he came across as more the ""hunk actor"" with limited range, while in this episode he shows that he truly is a talented and versatile actor and is well suited to be a top star.  Julie Mond was a great selection for the role of Moira and would have made an excellent addition as a recurring character.  Voice recording is still a little weak, but pacing is much, much better - the slower, non-hectic pacing suits this series much better than psychotic pacing.

part of the problem may be that i am watching some wonderful films lately which are up for the Oscars plus some tv shows from other countries.  the originality is so refreshing. however, one thing i know is true about this show.  i now drag myself to watch House every week as some kind of duty rather than the pleasure it once was. i'm hoping i just give it up shortly.  i wish he'd stayed in prison.  at least it would be a fresher take on this show.",1327363200,,1024,4.354497354497354

The diagnosis was quite surprising and interesting.

The interaction among the usual cast of characters is back again.  Taub has child issues as he doesn't want his ex-wife to take his daughter to Oregon. Chase gets to know the young woman doctor better and he tries to pry her background out of her (which House wants to know).

I don't need any more characters.

Otherwise the episode was pretty good though.  The patient first confesses to an affair with another woman, which is true, but keeps confessing to other misdeeds until it is clear that is part of his disease.  These HOUSE MD diseases are so exotic and the explanations so complex that I'm never really sure what they have by the end of the show, just that it's been truly bizarre.

another plus is that House is back on his medical cases, solving one an episode. this episode involves an extremely rich man who is giving away all his money to everyone and everything. it appears that his disease is EXTREME ALTRUISM! if this disease really exists, it is pretty interesting. this case is hand tailored for House: to cure someone he must turn him from Mr. Wonderful into Mr. Horrible medically.
