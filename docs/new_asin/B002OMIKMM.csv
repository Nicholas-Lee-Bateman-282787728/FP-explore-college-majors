3962289,4,B002OMIKMM,"I agree with the previous reviewers, a nice addition to my DVD cardio library.  I did not purchase to lose weight, but use this DVD as part of my maintenance program. So my goals may differ from others. I can see that after awhile of repetitive use, I would need to run the cardio section twice in order to continue to receive the benefits.

Cardio Section: Pros: got my heart rate up, uses interval training method - heart rate up/down, back up/down, nice change from other my other DVD's (Leslie Sansone, Kathy Smith, Chris Freytag, etc),there are times when I only have 20min - 30min for a workout, rather than skip a day, incorporates light weights (3 - 5).  I do have my strength training days where I use heavier weights, so I won't ever go heavy using this DVD, AB section much different from my other DVD's, which includes side planks and the use of a weight.
Cardio Section Cons: I must have missed the warm-up...seems like we started hopping on one foot 2 mins after the DVD started! I do wish the ab section was longer than 6mins.  Horrible music...no beat, but it definitely stays in the background and of course, no pre-queuing of moves from Denise...just change when she changes LOL! :-)",1262044800,26,1201,4.572093023255814
3962290,4,B002OMIKMM,"I like a lot of variety in my activity, from running to strength training to elliptical to hula hooping. I exercise about 5 days a week, and it's not easy for me to get my heart rate up. This DVD kicks my butt. I often get more out breath than even when I run, and I love having the option of getting this good of a workout at home, especially now that it's winter. It's varied enough that I don't get bored, and because the activities are separated into 20-minute sections, one can get some exercise in without spending a lot of time. Hand weights are a must, and make sure the ones you get are easy to handle. There's a lot of passing the weights around, so keep that in mind if you're purchasing some to use specifically with this DVD.

The negatives? I wish there was more stretching in the cool down sections, but one can always add that on themselves. And, of course, Denise is annoyingly chipper and can't count, but the great workout makes up for it.",1261872000,14,958,4.292817679558011
3962291,4,B002OMIKMM,"Even with the eye surgery :( , it is the same Denise as the one in all the previous DVDs she has been churning out. The workout is challenging, but not intimidating. I would say that one has to be a regular exerciser, at least, to do it entirely(20 min. cardio, 20 min. ""athletic training"" and 6 min. abs); this is not for beginners. The cardio includes some weight exercises, and the ""athletic training"" includes some cardio. Basically: lots of cardio in the cardio, with some weight exercises and vice-versa with the athletic / weight training: mostly weight, but some cardio in there as well. Yet because she always incorporates stretching at very regular intervals, I can only see how one would get injured because of not taking the time to first watch the program for familiarity and practice of some moves first.
Denise, as usual, will not stop talking, but there is the option of shutting her off and exercising with the music only (which is not so good but that's not the point of the DVD).
Here, you'll find a combo of  some exercises already seen in previous of her numerous DVDs but there also are some new ones, and the combination of said exercises is definitely original to this program. Her instructions are of the usual quality or maybe overall better, and certainly excellent for the ab section. What else?
It's the first time I have seen her sweat like she does in the cardio section (a good sign in my opinion!);
I like the exercise regimen in this DVD and do not regret buying it. The title may be a little misleading, for this is not like her other ""bootcamp"" DVD. Here you'll be moving from one exercise to another in a far less abrupt way, and Denise does not have an entire team of people behind her back ---instead, there are 4 other female exercisers.",1261094400,9,1777,4.553125
3962292,4,B002OMIKMM,"I work out every morning with a different DVD, ranging from cardio, to sculpting, to kickboxing, but I wanted to add a Denise Austin video and I liked the format of this one - kind of similar to 30 Day Shred. It has 2 full workout that are about 20 minutes each and a 6 minute bonus ab blaster. I have done the entire DVD twice in the past week and will say that it is a quality workout. I don't feel as wore out as I do after say, 40 minutes with Jillian Michaels, but I am sweaty and having fun the entire time with Denise. Some of the arm moves are a bit cheerleader-esque, but it is a good time. I look forward to my next workout with Denise Austin and her crew!",1260576000,72,666,3.9407407407407407

3962305,4,B002OMIKMM,In the cardio video even the extras can't keep up with Denise. She is unfortunately very inconsistent with the amount of reps. I suggest watching the videos at least once so you're not completely lost in the sauce. In the end though these workouts will make you sweat and lose weight.,1483920000,3,284,4.588235294117647

3962308,3,B002OMIKMM,"After reading some reviews on this, I decided to give it a try. Boot camp? This is for beginner-moderate level but not advanced. Boot camp at least implies an advanced level. This isn't even close.  I will still use it on days where I feel ""slow"" and I would recommend it to beginners as Denise is pleasant and easy to follow. For advanced? Chris Freytag or Julian Michaels are still number one with me.",1472342400,,403,4.445945945945946

3962314,4,B002OMIKMM,The actual moves included in this workout are awesome what I have a problem with is Denise's queuing of the moves. Every time I get one of her Dvd's she acts like the customer already knows what she is going to be doing next. I have to always do her Dvd's repeatedly just to become familiar with the steps so I can transition from one move to the next and keep up with what they are doing on the Dvd.,1460419200,,400,4.0125

3962316,5,B002OMIKMM,"This is my all-time favorite workout video! I have had this video for a few years now and I never get tired of it. You can easily modify the routines to your fitness level so I found it pretty simple to start from a beginner level and work my way up to more high energy moves. I love using hand weights with my workouts and the ""Cardio and Strength"" routine here is one of the best I've found for that. Denise Austin is always so motivating and really knows her stuff!",1456012800,,468,4.153846153846154

3962320,5,B002OMIKMM,"Don't do the 2nd work out, Kettle Bell Inspired, until you've got a few work outs under you. I made the mistake, twice, of doing work out 2 a little too soon. I used to be in pretty good shape, but have been derailed for a while. I did work out 2 and my legs where sore for days! Which is good, because it means the routine obviously works! People say Denise isn't ""Tough Enough"" I don't agree, If you watch he videos she generally has 3 levels of difficulty being performed with he companions. Denise is generally the middle difficulty with a more beginner and a more advanced person exercising in the background. Maybe I have a heart condition, but I always find it hard to follow along with out stopping for a little break.
A little back story: I've been exercising with Denise on and off since middle school. In my early twenties I began recording her show and doing them after work, and I saw results. I started adding in her videos, and really was only able to exercise 3 times a week. Eventually I went off on my own with jogging, and biking, and my own weight routine. Slowly the weight came back, even with my better eating habits. After being pregnant and having a baby, I really haven't been able to find anything that worked. I tried jogging, and rollerblading, elliptical followed by a complete weight routine, nothing changed. I decided about a month ago to go back to where I started, doing work outs with Denise. And I could tell right away that it was working. My posture instantly improves, my energy is slowly increasing, and I think that bloat is going away.
Denise was a gymnast who earned a scholarship to ASU, and then studied sports and fitness. She is constantly researching and creating routines that are both fun, and effective, and also efficient. She knows most people are busy or easily bored, so she keeps her routines around 20 minutes. I recently read a study that supports her method of high interval bursts followed by sustained recovery. Basically the group that exercised less, but did more intense bouts loses weight over the group that exercised more/longer but never did any intense burst in the work out. Maybe this is why her videos seem to be working for me, even though I'm only exercising 20 minutes every other day, rather than 45 minutes.
My main goal right now it to get my energy back, I might have an underlying condition, and I might have other issues that are keeping me from losing weight. I'm sure my diet needs refining again too!
If you find these workouts are not enough you can always up the intensity and weights on your end to make it more so.",1451606400,21,2603,4.516949152542373

All of her DVD's are Very Good, Motivating, professional and Denise makes them fun. WHAT I have a problem with is people complaining about an Instructor's voice, or personality. If your getting a good workout that should be what you care about. Denise is A Sweetheart. I feel the review should only be about the workout, whether it's good or not. PLEASE It's not very nice to talk bad about the Instructor's. If an Instructor is not doing a professional job, that is what we are to be commenting on.

3962387,5,B002OMIKMM,"This is a great supplement to the gym.  The first segment is an interval training workout which is fairly challenging.

3962391,4,B002OMIKMM,"I have been working out to exercise videos for over 20 years and have many of Denise's dvds. I agree with everyone, she has no rhythm and her cueing is usually poor, but this video she seems to have gotten it together. It's a well put together dvd. Somewhat different moves and I did work up a sweat and have to admit I was sore for 3 days after! Some people hate her positive ""chatter"" but I don't mind it, it is helpful to work out to someone that is upbeat.",1356652800,6,460,4.065934065934066
3962392,5,B002OMIKMM,"I do this dvd along with some others from Denise as well as other excercise ""gurus""' and I've had some good results.

3962394,4,B002OMIKMM,"I loved Denise Austin's video! Her workouts are short-20 minutes, but damn! Those 20 minutes have my heart pumping and the rest of me in a sweat! The moves are relatively simple, and I love the combo of cardio and weights. Great, short spurts of workouts. I loved it!",1341792000,2,267,4.469387755102041
3962395,5,B002OMIKMM,"Ok, so I've never felt compelled to rate anything on Amazon but this video is just so FANTASTIC. I normally work out to Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred but wanted a change of pace. Denise is like a peppy buddy who gently coaches you along - I really liked that. The workout was super quick and very easy to follow, though some parts did require a little dance-y coordination. Surprisingly, I even got a nice sweat going. SO, 5 stars all the way. I'll definitely be checking out more by Denise.",1340236800,5,491,4.406593406593407
3962396,5,B002OMIKMM,This is a good challenging workout in a short period of time.  The 20 minute sessions make it easy to do the video freqently and you can really feel it when you're finished.  Good job Denise.,1339804800,2,191,4.277777777777778
3962397,4,B002OMIKMM,"Having worked out to Denise's DVD's in the past, this is another one that really works. I do the whole workout including the ab one and really feel the benefits. Denise as always, is encouraging and easy to follow. Thanks!",1334102400,,222,4.575

3962400,4,B002OMIKMM,I decided to do the bootcamp workout wow I needed these exercises to build my endurance.  I would occasionally walk and jog.  I also go to the gym maybe 2 or 3 times a week with my husband.  I really could feel the burn.  I was a little concern about my knees but with each day the pain is going away. I would recommend this workout to get in shape in addition to cardio. This workout is similar to the 30 day shred.,1326153600,3,416,3.9759036144578315
3962401,3,B002OMIKMM,I love Denise and like to do various workouts of hers in addition to other trainers. I don't know why but she lost me in the middle of this one. She has better dvds.,1323907200,2,165,3.8823529411764706
3962402,3,B002OMIKMM,"First, I will admit my bias: Denise Autstin annoys the bageeze out of me. But to her credit, she keeps you moving and these 20 minute workouts are enough to get your heart rate up for a quick burst of cardio. It's impossible to come up with a reason you can't fit this it. I prefer slightly longer, more chalenging workout, but this will stay in the rotation for those morning I press snooze one too many times.",1316995200,8,411,4.282051282051282
3962403,5,B002OMIKMM,"This is a good solid workout, if you stick to it and maximize your efforts you should shed pounds.  It is different than Denise's other boot camp DVD.",1315526400,3,150,4.357142857142857
3962404,5,B002OMIKMM,"I bought this video because I needed to  do some cardio.  I have done lots of Denise's toning videos.  This past winter I used her Blast Away the Fat Indoor Walk, combining the last two workouts to get some cardio.

This video rocks! The music is upbeat and the moves are easy to follow!  I started out with 3 pound weights for four weeks.  Now, I am up to five pound weights.  I do a rotation of MWF cardio/abs and TThSa athletic/abs. At the end of the roughly 26 minutes of working out,  I am sweating like crazy and I feel like I have had an awesome workout.  After six weeks, I've lost 5 pounds and my body is more toned!

Way to go Denise!",1311897600,16,644,4.08
3962405,4,B002OMIKMM,"I really like this DVD because it has three levels of workouts, all relatively short.  They progressively build on each other until by the third week you are doing all of the workouts.  All of the workouts are relatively short and moderate intensity.  I personally am challenged by them but a younger fitter person may not be.  You might have to watch it first; Denise goes from one move to another without cueing the move first, but the moves are not difficult or dancy and are easy to pick up on.  If you have knee problems, there are some lunges and squats, but those can be modified and do not dominate the program.  As always, some people may find Austin's voice and mannerisms annoying as I used to, but she is growing on me.  I recommend this one.",1306022400,3,754,4.420289855072464
3962406,5,B002OMIKMM,"I really like this video - but then I have enjoyed all the Denise Austin video's I have bought over the years.  I was ready for a jump start to my exercise life and this was just the ticket.  I liked that it wasn't so high impact it was hard on my knees (I am over weight!), but it was intense enough that it was working my muscels.  I lost five pounds! over the course of the three weeks, using of course a balanced healthy diet along with the video. - 36 , mother of three",1302134400,7,474,3.9166666666666665
3962407,5,B002OMIKMM,"I really am glad I bought this DVD!  As others have mentioned it has 3 segments; cardio with strength training, athletic training (kettle bell inspired work out) and 6 min abs.  You need hand weights.  I used 8lb weights because that's all I have, but 3-6 lbs would probably be better.  The work outs are quite challenging but doable and very efficient (combining weights  and cardio, working arms and legs and abs at the same time, etc...).  So even if I don't feel like working out, I'm like, well, it's only 20 minutes or so.  Then a lot of times I'll go ahead and do the other 20 minute section after all.  Afterwards I am pretty spent.  I think for the average person this work out takes a bit of effort/will have you breathing hard.  Denise is upbeat and, I think, gives on target reminders and cues throughout the work out.  One of my favorites and most used.  Can tell a difference in my body shape since I started a few weeks ago.",1294185600,13,939,4.364161849710983
3962408,5,B002OMIKMM,Really enjoy this DVD.  When you do the total DVD it gives you an all over workout and I feel great afterwards.  Really works the buns and thighs.  Easy to follow and I love the way Denise keeps you motivated.,1294012800,2,209,4.175
3962409,5,B002OMIKMM,"I exclusively exercise to Denise Austin DVDs.  I still have the ""Hit the Spot"" VHS tapes and I still think they are great!  Up until recently, I stayed mainly with the toning and weight DVDs.  I don't care for ""cardio only"" exercising, because I can't ""see"" the results, but decided I should do more cardio.

The Boot camp DVDs combine cardio with strength training and weights and that's why this DVD is perfect for me. This might seem easy to someone who does a lot of cardio, but for me it is a real workout.",1290988800,14,511,4.347368421052631

3962411,5,B002OMIKMM,"I love Denise Austin, so if you are a fan, this is another great workout from her.  I am not a dance fan and this workout does not have the dance moves.

3962413,5,B002OMIKMM,"This is the best cardio dvd.  It has two different segments.  You start out with doing the first one four times the first week, then you build up to the harder one the next week.  On the third week, you do both, totaling forty minutes a day, four times a week.  I love how you build your endurance.  I like Denise's personality.  She is energetic, but it seems genuine to me.  She has a bubbly personality and she owns it.  This video is not boring and it's easy to do, no complicated steps that require coordination.  I highly recommend this one.",1280188800,49,547,4.336633663366337
3962414,2,B002OMIKMM,This is not the Denise Austin I have known in the past. Not very motivating or long enough.  This is supposed to be a boot camp not a little 20 min. exercise video.  Very boring.,1275177600,2,178,4.057142857142857
3962415,4,B002OMIKMM,"I own a lot of exercise DVDs and Denise Austin is way too geeky for my taste. She generally is not a good cuer and her workouts lack real challenge and skill among other things. However, this one is unusally high impact and challenging for her standards. It's not the greatest, but definitely not as bad as most of her other ones. It is very fast paced with lots of cardio. The second chapter is kettlebell based with mostly swings (she uses a dumbbell). Her introductory segment is the same old, freaky eye-raising, goofy voiced Denise, but luckily she loses this habbit in the workout and it is somewhat pleasant to follow. Most of the time she cues late (no surprise), like in the middle of the first move or rep, but if this workout becomes familiar this might not be an issue later.  The 4 stars are in comparison with HER other DVDs, not other instructors. She is still light years away from someone like Cathe, Amy Bento, or Kelly Coffey.",1272240000,4,945,4.494186046511628

3962418,1,B002OMIKMM,I was so looking forward to a new routine but this DVD went back in the box. I've been doing the Firm DVD's for 18 months and they are fantastic. Denise's cueing is terrible and I never even broke a sweat. The ab segment is over before you ever start to feel the work. I was extremly dissapointed. And this may sound catty but the Denise in the video is not the same person that is pictured on the case (by at least 20 lbs).Don't bother!,1265932800,4,437,4.093023255813954

I feel that it works out your upper body as well as your lower body.  As far as the last workout(the stomach) workout, we don't do that one.  We did and I really didn't like it.  Didn't feel that it really worked my stomach enough, so I just do other workouts that she has done on other dvds. But love the first 2.

Very clean organized well protected packaged.
First,
I like to add that I have other great workout videos from Denise Austin like
Hot Yoga and Quick Burn Cardio.  Although a full-time working busy mom
I'm glad to be learning so much from this professional well known fitness instructor
Like I do not necessarily need to
do 2 hours or more of hard workouts to see good results so going forward with what works best and effective for my daily workout routines......now,
I'm enjoying this awesome workout from Denise Austin Body Boot Camp!
Denise is very easy with directions and extremely friendly
It continues to be a refresher and a nice exercise learning experience for me
Denise Austin delivers an amazing 50 minutes workout!
my heart is pumping and the pounds are dropping!
Last but not least, I'm enjoying the low-impact moves I sweat like if I did a 90 minutes of high intensity hard workout
 this is in my top favorite at home dvds workouts
 the best part of all is in the convenience of
being happy at home....priceless! Thank you Denise!",1502668800,,1103,4.734375

When I ordered this I was hoping it would not be lame, because I don't like some of DA's older workouts, she used to be too sappy. Not at all true in this one! Her voice is still very feminine and soft, but she is encouraging without being dorky.

I was also surprised because I thought it would be super easy after being a JM buff, but it is QUITE challenging and has room to up the intensity, by adding heavier weights.

I am really glad I bought this.",1500854400,,624,4.024193548387097
