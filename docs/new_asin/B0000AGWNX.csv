1905740,5,B0000AGWNX,"4kids you rule!!! I liked seeing the lost unaired season on FOX, and i'm glad i'm about to see how they defeated the shredder!!! I can't wait until the 7th season comes on!!!
P.S. Is there Any 4kids entertainment fans who knows that if they're relasing this summer the complete 3rd season of Yu-Gi-Oh!?!",1208822400,,303,4.62962962962963
1905741,4,B0000AGWNX,"Two years ago, season 4 of TMNT ended on a cliffhanger with our boys in green shipped off to Japan to fight an ancient evil (the original, demon Shredder). Faster than you can say ""toy sales,"" 4Kids pulled a switch and aired ""Fast Forward"" instead, banishing these ""lost episodes"" to brief on demand showings and overseas markets. Now with Fast Forward over and the series being retooled again, North American audiences are getting The Ninja Tribunal saga for the first time. As I write this the final few episodes are airing on TV, but they'll all be collected in this set.

This is solid Ninja Turtles, though it doesn't quite hit the heights of the series' best. As the season was only 13 episodes instead of the usual 26, a lot of ""fat"" has been trimmed from the storytelling and every episode furthers the main plot while also being action-packed. The result is a roller coaster ride that takes the Turtles from New York to Japan and back to New York, has them forming alliances with new allies and old enemies, and gaining mystical medallions that turn them into dragons.

Yes, dragons. Taking a cue from current anime shows, the Turtles need to ""power up"" to the next level with mystical energies, weapons, and transformations. It's actually used to good effect where needed, though you'll still be glad these powers don't last beyond this story arc. Otherwise, the series has always had its problems with pacing, characterizations, and cop-outs; this season is no different, and some intense moments are weakened by what was probably a network decision to play safe; they may be Ninja Turtles, but the show's still for kids.

But overall, this is still a more-than-worthy purchase for fans. These were the last episodes to be produced in the original '2K3' art style, and bring that chapter of TMNT to a fitting close while keeping the doors open to Fast Forward and beyond. It doesn't live up to two years' worth of hype, but what possibly could? The Ninja Tribunal ""lost season"" is a fun time.",1208044800,12,2003,4.75
1905742,5,B0000AGWNX,this season is about the turtles adventures in trying to stop the tangue shredder from being resurrected by the mysticals with the help of the ninja tribunal and the 4 other acolytes. 4 kids tv is currently showing this season and even though its incomplete it is definatly worth the wait,1207353600,2,288,4.666666666666667
1905743,5,B0000AGWNX,"If you enjoyed watching ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" by FoxKids on Cheez TV and Toasted TV (etc.) but was disappointed by the (last) ""Ninja Tribunal"" episode of Season 4 before ""Fast Forward"" played like me, well . . . that season has just about been completed and will be released onto DVD (as you can see above).

This never-before-seen season box set takes place after the Turtles and 4 other human warriors have been taken by 4 Shredder look-a-likes on a ship to Japan for some intense training to, as was briefly explained But Never Fully revealed as Before, combat a ""Great Evil"", as well as resolve the Mystic Foots' (5 mini-Shredders with elemental powers - earth, fire, wind, water & metal) attempt to resurrect the true Shredder.

Any other information related to this season can be found at Wikipedia, as well as info on another episode from this same season.  From the episodes and summaries listed, it sounds a bit darker than before . . .

Naturally, as this season was incomplete and therefore never shown before (except for demand on ""selected"" channels), all detailed information shall be revealed upon its release and purchase by fans.

Despite the fact that I have never seen an episode before nor can tell what really happens, and probably not worthy to review an item pre-release, a NEW TMNT TV Season (almost) fully released on DVD is WORTH a full rating.  The long wait shall be over soon . . .

*Sigh*, If only this sort of treatment (completing an unfinished season of an animated series) was also done with the 2002/Mike Young Productions' ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"".  THAT would be great!

This season has just recently started showing on Toasted TV!  Aside from answering ""What happened to the Turtles next?"", this season also originates (therefore answering a lot of curious things and gives explanations) what would be mentioned or briefly seen in ""Fast-Forward"" (except for the change of animation style, which will happen again in Season 7):
* Why is Michaelangelo's Turtle Titan costume different?
* What is the tension between Master Splinter and the Tribunal?
* Why were there so many people fighting together in the Justice Force?

This DVD answers all these questions and more!  Remember: this is the Turtles' darkest adventure yet . . . .",1207180800,7,2292,4.848717948717948
1905744,5,B0000AGWNX,"The Turtle boys are back, and looking great!  This is the next evolution of the animated TMNT, with many storylines from the Mirage comic book series, and a smattering of the familiar from the original animated series, mixed together with some new ideas.  Brought over from the original animated series are the Turtles different color eye-masks, and Don's techno ability to cobble extremely sophisticated equipment from whatever can be found in the sewers.  New in this series a different style of animation than the original series, a new style that flows very smoothly.  And bad guys that are a lot more villainous, and a lot less humorous.
This tape - with storylines brought from the Mirage comic book series - is about the Mousers, and how the Turtles first meet April, as well as Baxter Stockman.  The Turtles also have their first run in with new villains, the Purple Dragon gang, and (old foes to those familiar with the TMNT; new foes to the Turtles at this point) a number of Foot ninjas.  The three episodes on this tape make for a complete story, while leaving a bit of mystery about what the Turtles will encounter in the future.
This series is an excellent introduction, or re-introduction, to the TMNT.",1089936000,,1217,4.771428571428571
1905745,5,B0000AGWNX,"I picked this up at Walmart last week, I had never saw an episode of the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that is currently on Fox. I was a fan of the origianl cartoon that was on in the early ninties, but any I really enjoyed Attack of the MOusers, which includes three episodes explaining how the turtles came about. Some of the characters are different than they were in the original show and in the movies. April O'Neil in this is works for Baxster Stockman instead of being a news reporter. Baxter Stockman is also much different than he was in the original series. The turtles themselves are right on. They all have the same characteristics that they did on the first movie and they appear more like comic book characters than cartoon characters. If you enjoyed the original series or the first movie, you should enjoy this tape.",1071187200,,835,4.573333333333333
1905746,5,B0000AGWNX,"Donny makes various attempts to contact the Turtle Nebula, a constellation  shaped like a Turtle. After Mikey pulls a prank on him, he does it on top  of Channel Six. He ends up crashing a spaceship on top of the roof. But  when he says ""Talk about great reception!"", the background shows  the streets. Therefore, he is forced to help the pilot, Algernon the space  lizard, get it working again. (BTW, the spaceship will blow Earth into the  next dimension if it gets taken apart.)
Meanwhile, the other Turtles are  watching April's report on Hostile Hyram Grelch, who has taken over all the  TV stations in the city--except C6, of course! Suddenly, Grelch's men come  in and capture her. Don and Algy try to stop them, but they get pasted.  Luckily, they unpaste themselves and we get a car chase. Meantime, the  others try to find April. When Mike says ""Okay, so I put on the wrong  mask"", Don's there when he's not supposed to be. Also, when Don says  ""Try a little of your space magic"", he's drawn as Mike.
Donny  uses footage of [what might have been] an earlier episode to turn the  cathode-ray forcefield against Grelch and make it look like the warlord of  the Turtle Nebula is declaring war. Hey, is that the arcade game's level  one intro music playing when the TMNT get into Grelch's penthouse? Oh yeah,  when Leo unties April, he's colored as Don.
The second episode on the  tape, ""Big Bug Blunder"", begins with a pointless scene where the  Turtles clean up their TV room. Don tries to have Metalhead (from ""The  Making of Metalhead"") do the job, but the robot goes haywire, and Raph  shuts it off.
Meanwhile, Rocksteady and Bebop try to swat a fly (with  Bebop saying a funny line when he accidentally swats Rocksteady), and end  up creating a new mutagen, which Krang uses it to send out the fly (now  gargantuan) to wreck havoc in New York.
Ghengis of the Punk Frogs drops  in to visit, and tries to sink his teeth into the giant fly. The Turtles  manage to get the fly stuck in a puddle of syrup, but then Shredder sends  out more giant insects! In the end, the Turtles manage to herd the  house-sized housepests back to Dimension X, and Shredder and Krang have  until next Saturday to get rid of these insects.",968371200,3,2227,4.508771929824562

1905756,4,B0000AGWNX,"Don't dig the narrative in the opening theme song, but this is a good season. April gets her jumpsuit, the Triceraton stories are a mix of new and old-inspired, and Honeycut is a niftier chatacter. It's a long season, cramming a lot in. The last episode could have probably been two, but it's not too rushed. It was kind of weird to see the turtles using blasters and laser blades, and I'm not a fan of their space suits, but in the main an enjoyable season. Is another season on the way? Will treads left dangling on Earth get wrapped up, or will this incarnation of the turtles continue? Interestingly enough, I feel like all the original comic cannon stuff has been satisfied. We'll see where they go from here!",1469232000,,714,4.5

Also purchased the next dvd release from the new TV show, Beyond the Known Universe. It also has the same issue on the first disk. While it may be that my player is picky, I have no other DVDs that skip in this same manner. It seems to me that the product Nickelodean is using poor quality dvds for there newest releases.

I ordered a replacement copy, which did include both disks, but disk 1 was defective. The disk wouldn't play all of the episodes. Freezing and skipping would occur to the point it would kick me back to the main menu every time. Now, I just received my second replacement copy and it has the exact same issue as the first replacement did. I checked all the disks and they looked perfectly clean and brand new like they should. Upon closer inspection after breathing on the disks it revealed blotchy spots of residue. I properly cleaned the disks which seem to fade the spots, but not completely remove them. Still no luck.

Darker story line is more in line with the original comic book.  This series is for older kids and teenagers the way it should be.

While this is only half the episodes that made up any of the first `4' seasons of this new series that started in 2003, though that I feel that this season doesn't miss a beat whatsoever.  The turtles have to face their most deadliest of enemies but in order to defeat him they have been called upon what is known as the `Ninja Tribunal' to help prepare them along with others to defeat this powerful enemy.  Not long after their training had begun, 4 heralds had resurrected their master and brought him back to the earth unleashing what he can unto the earth and the first choice he makes is to take New York City, home of the turtles.  While the turtles feel that they're alone in fighting this `demon' but in the end they have to call upon former enemies as alliances to help fight him.  I feel that this is one of the best seasons of the new series and overall I give it 4 stars out of 5.",1279756800,,1034,4.228426395939087
1905810,4,B0000AGWNX,"Most people don't like this season, but for what reason?
To me, this was the greatest season of the series. It doesn't skip out on the shell-kicking action, and it's got a storyline which explains most of the series in great detail. Plus, you still get the same Mikey humor(and bad jokes unfortunately, but its worth it), the dark theme that everyone loves, and they finally have new characters that nobody even knew about. This story is brought together very well at the end and doesn't leave you the least bit confused. I've been collecting the ninja turtles dvds starting with the original series and moving on to the newer ones, and from everything that I've seen, this is definitely one you do not want to miss out on",1243641600,2,722,4.604651162790698
1905811,4,B0000AGWNX,This was a very entertaining DVD. I watched the old Ninja Turtles when I was younger but these new TMNTs are much better and the story line is much more interesting.,1216944000,2,165,4.354838709677419
1905812,5,B0000AGWNX,"This is a great DVD!!!  It goes great with the Ninja Turtles Series!!  For all the turtles fans, watch and enjoy for turtlie goodness.",1215475200,2,134,4.541666666666667
1905813,1,B0000AGWNX,"After TMNT had been on the air for four seasons, ratings were dropping. As good as the show was in season four, it's just a natural occurance. Now, Turtles made so much money in the past and Peter Laird seems to be a pretty modest spender, so instead of cancelling the show it was kept on the air due to it's hefty finacial backing. To try to boost ratings, 4kids wanted them to think out side of the TMNT box and come up with some sort of gimmick, first was this season (which wasn't aired until recently) and after the plug was pulled on it, Fast Forward put the TMNT into the future (and eventually turned out to be a good show).

This show is a pound for pound anime knock-off (so if you're an anime fan, eat it up) and it's really ""out there"" even when compared to seasons 1 through 4. The main problem is that there are about 15 new characters and hardly any of them are essential to the plot, but still get alot of screen time. The voice actors that provide the voices of the turtles have even stated that this season was boring to record because of a such an extreme decrease in the TMNT's use, I recall atleast a couple episodes in which Donatello only had about 3 lines.

I don't own the disc yet (which has nice cover art), but I've seen all the episodes twice. I'll pick it up someday just to finish my TMNT DVD collection, but for now I can do without the glowing turtles shooting spirit bombs and lighting beams at flying enemies and turning into gigantic dragons.... it's NINJA Turtles people, not Saiyan Turtles.",1213401600,6,1528,4.320557491289199
1905814,4,B0000AGWNX,"This 2-DVD set of the TMNT ""Ninja Tribunal"" is almost perfect:

PACKAGING:
The packaging is great: good artwork on outside & inside of case and the DVDs. There is only an advertisement as an insert, but the episode info. is listed on the DVD artwork on the inside of the clear DVD case.

STORYLINE:
The whole ""Ninja Tribunal"" storyline is pretty complex and builds on the TMNT mythos. It starts off kind of slow, but becomes very involved and intriguing as you go along. Overall: good writing.

EPISODE TRANSFER:
The video transfer is decent. It is, after all, a Saturday morning cartoon. If you have to have your cartoons in HD, things have gotten out of hand. My only complaint (and it's a doozy) is that about halfway through the last episode (and at a pretty critical point of the story), a TV rating box inexplicably appears on the top left of the screen, reading ""TV Y7 FV"". Obviously, this was mistakenly transferred on the DVD. It was pretty annoying, as it distracted me from the story and I paid to have a personal copy of these episodes, not something reminiscent of a slapped-together pirated copy off the net with all of the TV broadcast bugs on it.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
Ummm... Let's see. They must be here somewhere... Nope! Just ""sneak peeks"". LAME!

OVERALL:
""Ninja Tribunal"" is a good total package that is darn near perfect, especially considering the price and the running time.",1213315200,,1396,4.704918032786885
1905815,4,B0000AGWNX,"Finally the lost episodes in one complete set & for a very fair price too. Again, stellar animation w/ a solid story that pretty much flows like one long film if you exclude the theme song & ending credits. As much as I enjoyed the now classic show, this new series is a lot better for so many reasons. The only true downside to this collection is there are ABSOLUTELY no special features. Some sort of behind the scenes featurette on the making of *the ninja tribunal* season would have been a big plus.",1213056000,2,504,4.372340425531915
1905816,3,B0000AGWNX,"The season series of ""Ninja Tribunal"" is like a turtle mini series. This over 4 1/2 hours (13 episodes)plays out like a great 13 part story

This story arc is a darker TMNT than normal. Over 13 weeks (spisodes), it loses impact and emotional content. The animation is good, but as good as cartoon is..if the story isn't good, the greatest anime cant cover it!

To reveal the storyline would spoil the adventure. I am older than the kids who watch this on fox tv, but this kept me riveted, when watched all at once. Now on DVD, this 13 part storyline can be watched all at once. However, it is  rated 3 stars because the storytelling is weak
