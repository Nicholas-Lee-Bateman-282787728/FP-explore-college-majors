8597971,4,B00DUN2PX4,"The picture-perfect setting through the South & trains, with colorful characters sets the mood for an engaging, entertaining story. Acting Performance of entire cast was Good, and the intriguing story which highlights the true definition of the word selfish, along with experimenting with mixed-emotions, keeps your attention until the end. Dark, engaging, dry humor, and entertaining. Highly recommended!",1422835200,,405,6.0
8597972,1,B00DUN2PX4,"I hate to rate anything with David Morse badly, but I was utterly disappointed with this film.  David did the best he could with what he was given but the acting was horrible, it looked like something made in the 80's.  I just plain didn't like it.",1422835200,,248,4.25531914893617
8597973,5,B00DUN2PX4,Eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end.  A quirky movie with no simple answers about the surprise of selfishness and selfless love and missing emotions in the American family. Uses the familiar thematic construct of the South and trains and is conducted with a somber nostalgia coupled with an oddball humor. I especially love a couple of incredible vignettes one with James Gandolfini and another with David Morse who reminds me of Buster Keaton as he trusts the audience to stay with him. The script is sparely written and is more concerned with exploring emotions than telling a story.  This movie reminds me of the passion and willingness to experiment that was more common twenty years ago than it is now.,1378166400,,718,4.829268292682927
8597974,5,B00DUN2PX4,"I love this movie: was very impressed by a rough cut I saw at the IFP Market, and like the final version even more.  Here's a review I wrote on it for MUBI.com: [...]",1378166400,,166,3.8823529411764706
8597975,4,B00DUN2PX4,"Gritty, dark and weirdly comic, this cinematic first may represent a new genre.  An odd fable peopled by fascinating characters.  On first viewing, came away with more questions than answers, but it kept pricking my thoughts and drawing me back for a second viewing, and I don't normally do that.  Strong performances and great use of local locations and characters.  A terrific first film from this team!",1377993600,,405,5.0
