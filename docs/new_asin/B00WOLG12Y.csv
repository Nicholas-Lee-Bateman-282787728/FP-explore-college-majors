8713864,5,B00WOLG12Y,"As a scholar in animation studies, I couldn't miss the chance to buy this compilation, which includes some of the most interesting, provocative and influential animated short movies ever made. Some of the greatest independent animators in the whole world, including Bill Plympton, openly recognize the strength of these works. All of the movies included in the compilation deserve a place in history of animation; among the highlights, Marv Newland's ""Black Hula"" (a brief history of what happens when consumerist society meets an untainted civilization) and ""Bambi Meets Godzilla"" (an instant classic - and yes, the title is an accurate description of what happens in the movie). As for Danny Antonucci's ""Lupo the Butcher"", it is probably one of the most recognizable icons of the 1990s - the character was revived for a very popular series of bumpers on MTV. Highly recommended!",1463011200,,881,5.211267605633803
8713865,5,B00WOLG12Y,"Most of the classic International Rocketship classics are here all the way back to ""Bambi and Godzilla"" which I first saw late at night at the cinema of my university in 1977. Excellent prints where available were used for this edition. The only thing missing is ""Hooray for Sandbox Land"" due to copyright issues.",1457913600,,313,4.814814814814815
