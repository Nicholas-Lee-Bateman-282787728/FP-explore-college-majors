8525103,5,B0084FPTM2,A good look at a little heard of mission field. A must for anyone interested in missions and a challenge for all Christians,1370131200,,123,4.391304347826087
8525104,5,B0084FPTM2,"Wow! This DVD was remarkably well done. It is not flashy or cutting-edge, but it is raw and exciting in a way that only true Christian pioneer mission can be. I have a friend in Kosovo now so this DVD was even more relevant to me. The special features interview with the missionary was worth the price of the purchase. I would encourage missions committees, youth groups, pastors and Christian schools to get a hold of all the available Dispatches from the Front and watch them ASAP!",1354060800,2,483,4.563218390804598
8525105,1,B0084FPTM2,This the worst missionary series I have watched. There is nothing other than narration. It's bad. Really bad. I wanted these to be great but they're just not. No dialogue and no interaction with locals.,1347926400,,202,4.8
8525106,5,B0084FPTM2,"If you are longing to see that God is powerfully at work all over the world, the ""Dispatches from the Front"" series will not disappoint!  These documentaries tell amazing stories of transforming grace. The oppressed are set free, the broken are made whole, those who hunger and thirst are satisfied, the blind are given new sight, the orphaned are adopted, and the disheartened are given hope.  Believers will walk away encouraged and challenged to live out the Gospel in the world around them.",1339027200,4,494,4.9397590361445785
