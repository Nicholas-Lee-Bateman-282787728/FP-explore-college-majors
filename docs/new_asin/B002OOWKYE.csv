3963096,5,B002OOWKYE,"Arguably, Season 4 is when the women hit their stride. Most of the funny episodes I remember come from Season 4. ""Julia Gets her Head Stuck in a Fence"", ""Foreign Affairs"", ""Payne Grows Up"", ""Berniece's Sanity Hearing""- quite funny episodes!

Designing Women over the years has touched on topics that were slightly (at least) controversial at the times- Season 2 was ""Killing all the right people""- The AIDS episode, Season 3 ""Stand and Fight""- when Mary Jo is mugged and the women talk of the statistics of muggings. Season 4's controversial episode is ""Rowdy Girls""- when Charlene finds out that her cousin Mavis is suffering from domestic abuse- the way the writers and producers handled this episode was classy and poignant. You never saw what happened-but hearing the screams was chilling enough.

Another episode that I believe was Emmy nominated- was the one where Suzanne goes back for her reunion and they make fun of how much weight she had gained ""They shoot Fat Women, don't they?"" It was a good episode (although not one of my favorites) and it shows how society judges women on weight.

This is a must watch season- All of the season's thus far have been good, but this is particularly good. Plus seeing Dolly Parton as Charlene's Guardian Movie Star- priceless!",1285804800,,1275,4.8663594470046085
3963097,5,B002OOWKYE,"OOOOH! This is the season I was waiting for!!!! No doubt the ladies and Anthony (THAT BIG BLACK BEAUTIFUL BUCK :) hit their comedic stride in Season 4.
What I liked and appreciated most about this show was the entire cast was laugh out loud funny, because the writers allowed each character to shine! Julia, Suzanne, Mary Jo, Charlene, and Anthony were all equally funny in their own unique way, which is lost on current sitcoms today.

First of all the writing was perfectly suited for each character and there was plenty of meat and gravy to go around for each and every cast member to sink their teeth into!!!

These episodes made me laugh, cry, and think. AH, classic tv!!! Needless to say I've finished this wonderful set already, so thank you Shout Factory for allowing the fans of Designing Women to enjoy this fantastic series over and over!!!

Bring on Season 5 Pronto!!! (Last season of Delta Burke and Jean Smart :(

3963098,5,B002OOWKYE,"DESIGNING WOMEN (seasons 1-5) had a cast made in heaven. It is truly one of those great casts equal to that of THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW. Too bad EMMY seldom smiled on them. Season Four was the perfect season. The scripts were great! The direction was great! (Not to mention that there were 27 episodes that season - almost unheard of now.) Now getting to that great cast: Everyone was in the peak form during season 4 and should have had multiple acting EMMY nominations.
Who can ever forget DELTA BURKE returning to her high school reunion at a heavier weight - or - DIXIE CARTER having a little too much champaigne at her son's wedding and belting out ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" - or - ANNIE POTTS dating a priest - or - JEAN SMART having DOLLY PARTON as her guardian movie star... and don't forget MESCHACH TAYLOR impersonating Suzanne's maid to get her green card....Unforgettable! And let us not forget ALICE GHOSTLEY wearing a Christmas tree skirt...and the first appearance of RUSTY, the carpenter (with his pants below the equator)...priceless! I can go on and on; in fact, I could not stop watching these episodes. They were wonderful. There is also a special episode with the title: THEIR FINEST HOUR.  Season 4 is truly THEIR FINEST SEASON. See it for yourself!",1285113600,,1268,4.686098654708521
3963099,5,B002OOWKYE,"I have always enjoyed Designing Women, so I purchased seasons 1-4 as soon as availabe and have spent many hours just sitting watching and amazed at how much I had forgotten.  I also enjoyed the shows that dealt with cancer and aids.

A wonderful t.v. show too bad that there are no shows like this anymore.",1283040000,7,306,4.446428571428571
3963100,5,B002OOWKYE,"The great people at Shout! Factory rescued ""Designing Women"" from the Sony vaults in May 2009 when they began releasing long-overdue season sets.

Although I have a special fondness for Seasons 5, 6 and 7 of ""Designing Women"" since those are the years I discovered the series in prime time, I have come to realize that Season 4 is the pinnacle of the series in terms of writing and acting.

Special mention goes to ""The First Day of the Last Decade of the Entire Twentieth Century"", in which Charlene gives birth to baby Olivia on the first day of the new decade.

The writing in this episode is exquisite, and one memorable scene shows that even death can be beautiful as the Sugarbaker ladies watch a 102-year-old lady pass on right after sharing her wisdom with them. Julia and Mary Jo's reactions in the scene are stunning. Completing the circle of life, Charlene brings a new life into the world at the same time as the woman dies.

As if this outstanding episode needed a gimmick, Dolly Parton, then red-hot off her success in ""Steel Magnolias"" makes a delightful cameo appearance. Always a class act, Dolly seems right at home on this show and it's wonderful to have her in this beautiful, poignant installment.

Conversely, ""Foreign Affairs"" is one the series' funniest episodes a little later in the season. Suzanne uses cash to convince Anthony to impersonate her maid Consuela in taking a citizenship test to prevent her from being deported. This entry features some of the snappiest dialogue ever; Charlene is especially sassy in this; Mary Jo makes her usual dry comments while frolicking on a giant waterbed (don't ask); Julia shakes her head, powerless to stop the insanity that surrounds her. If I had been able to attend a live taping of ""Designing Women"", I would have wanted it to be this one. Everything is so perfect, you can feel the electricity crackle.

The well-known episode ""They Shoot Fat Women, Don't They?"" is on this set, in which former beauty-queen Suzanne is forced to confront her weight issues.

The episodes in the last-half of the season are somewhat funnier when Suzanne switches to the shorter bubble-cut hairdo from the modified page-boy she wore when the season began, such as when Suzanne accidentally consumes some of Charlene's breast milk.

We need to support this release so Shout! will continue to release the final three years of the show. Otherwise, they will just rot in the Sony vaults, and this show is just too well-crafted to let that happen.

My only quibble is that Shout! used a Season Two pic for the cover art, but I love this series so much, I'd buy it in a brown paper wrapper!",1278374400,38,2639,4.73202614379085

I wound up watching all the episodes and realized how funny and often poignant Designing Women was.  Designing Women has a way of showing the absurdities of life, and the importance of being kind to one another.  Dixie Carter as Julia Sugarbaker portrays the epitome of the new Southern lady with incredible wisdom and wit.  With so many trashy shows on TV now, Designing Women was a treat.  I never saw it when it was on in the late 1980's because of my work schedule.  This is a program not designed only for a female audience.  It is well done and makes me laugh, plus I have learned a few of life's lessons from some of the episodes.  My adult children have also found Designing Women a good blast from the past.",1468800000,,852,4.522875816993464

3963121,5,B002OOWKYE,"Designing Women has been called ""the poor man's Golden Girls"", and while there is some truth to that nickname, Designing Women was a great quality show that deserves to be judged by its own standards. The fourth season of Designing Women showcases some of the show's best episodes, at a time before the 1991 tabloid-grabbing behind-the-scenes quarrels were more talked about than the show itself. By this point in the series, everyone is completely comfortable playing their roles; Delta Burke as the glamour-clad Suzanne Sugarbaker, Dixie Carter as the ever liberal Julia Sugarbaker, Annie Potts as the spunky Mary Jo Shively, and Jean Smart as the sensitive Charlene ""Frazier"" Stillfield. And, of course, Meshach Taylor and Alice Ghostley are still around and funny as ever portraying Anthony Bouvier and Bernice Clifton, respectively.

The fourth season kicks off with ""The Proxy Pig"", which plots the events surrounding Suzanne's pig running away and Mary Jo trying to impress a ritzy high school buddy by living in the fancy house the design firm is redecorating. ""Nightmare from Hee Haw"" involves the four women and their boyfriends spending a weekend in a log cabin in Georgia. While out at a local bar, an elderly hillbilly man and his three rough hillbilly sons take a liking to the four women and force them to dance with them. The men are terrified, but later Anthony shows up with his prison buddies and takes care of the hillbilly men. ""The Rowdy Girls"" involves the design firm entering a contest with other Atlanta companies. They agree to do a impersonation of the Supremes; which results in Suzanne showing up in black face and doing a hilarious bit with Anthony. The episode is also a ""special"" one, with Charlene learning that her cousin Mavis (guest star Kim Zimmer), who helped them practice, is the victim of spousal abuse. In ""Julia and Suzanne's Big Adventure"", Julia and Suzanne travel to Tokyo to visit their mother with fortunately hilarious outcomes; the leave Mary Jo and Anthony in charge of the store, but these two goofballs run up a huge bill to Sugarbaker's by phoning into a call-in program asking viewers if ""Were They too Hard on Jim Bakker"". In ""The Fur Flies"", Suzanne is attacked verbally by animal rights activists for wearing a fur coat in a fashion show, and Charlene searches for a new nanny for baby Olivia. Other notable episodes include: ""Tornado Watch"", which involves the five principals and some guests being stranded in Sugarbaker's during a tornado; ""Tough Enough"", which sees the four women competing with a male design firm over a bowling alley job; ""Foreign Affairs"", in which Suzanne has Anthony pose as her maid so that her maid won't be deported; ""La Place Sans Souci"", the season finale, in which Suzanne and Charlene square off against Julia and Mary Jo when they all go on diets.

Two of season four's best episodes are ""They Shoot Fat Women, Don't They?"" and ""The First Day of the Last Decade of the Entire Twentieth Century"". In the former, Mary Jo and Julia go on an eating fast to support an project of Anthony's about little children dying of hunger in Africa, but the main story involves Suzanne's class reunion. At her reunion, Suzanne is humiliated because of her weight gain and leaves in tears. In the end, she confronts her former classmates when accepting the award for the person ""most changed"". It is a beautifully written episode and a true showcase of Delta Burke and her talents. In the latter, Charlene goes into labor (to have Olivia). At the hospital, Julia befriends the 103-year-old Minnie (guest star Beah Richards), while Charlene herself is visited, in her dreams, by her ""guardian movie star"", played by guest star Dolly Parton. Also, Bernice gets an ambulance to take her to the hospital and confuses them she's pregnant; when there, she believes Anthony's new girlfriend, Vanessa (Olivia Brown), to be singer Tina Turner.

Season Four of Designing Women showcases the show at its best. There are few flaws here, if any, and while the show still falls a bit short of upstaging The Golden Girls, it certainly gives it a run for its money. The performances, especially by the five principals, are in top form, and the stories are at their peak. Highly Recommended.",1450656000,,4250,4.891816920943135

3963125,4,B002OOWKYE,"It was during the 4th (and 3rd, too) season that this series was really hitting its stride, with the continuing adventures and misadventures of the classy and opinionated Julia, shallow and spoiled Suzanne, Romantic and old-fashioned (but also slightly ditzy) Charlene and sensible but quirky recent divorcee Mary Jo and the long-suffering delivery guy-cum-construction contractor Anthony, the only man working among four women.  Episodes are up to the series' usual standards, including my favorites: ""The Rowdy Girls"" (Charlene discovers her cousin is being abused by her husband, and she and the other Sugarbaker ladies conspire to convince the cousin to leave her husband), ""Julia Gets Her Head Stuck in a Fence"" (after being teased by the others about her reserved and straight-laced personality, Julia picks a job at the Governor's Mansion to cut loose and winds up getting her head stuck between the railings in the not-to-be-altered stairway bannister as they prepare for a ball to be held there later that night), ""They Shoot Fat Women, Don't They?"" (now-noticeably-overweight Suzanne goes to her high school reunion and gets insulted and ostracized--one of several episodes written to address Delta Burke's real-life weight gain during the course of the series), ""the First Day of the Last Decade of the Entire Twentieth Century"" (the birth on New Year's Eve of Charlene's baby--the title is almost longer than the episode) and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (in the midst of post-partum depression, exhausted Charlene, feeling unattractive, decides that husband Bill is having an affair, and the Sugarbaker ladies arrange a romantic night out for them so they can make up).

Once again, highly recommended, IF you don't mind the liberal-leaning tone of some of the plots.",1443830400,,1775,5.313167259786477

Dixie Carter was a classy lady, as were the other ladies on this show. TV shows today just don't cut it, as far as I'm concerned. They just don't measure up to the calibre and humor of Designing Women.",1322697600,2,573,4.153153153153153

  Most telling is the way Delta Burke came into her real niche I think. When she comes in the door at the shop dressed as a dowdy stand-in for her maid, Consuela, I'm on the floor howling. It's just not Suzanne! Then she cons Anthony into taking on the role, dressing him up in a dress,a big bra and a hairdo that he says makes him look like ""Jane Wyman."" Funny stuff.
  Then we see Suzanne dealing with the truth of her weight gain, still gorgeous, but more of her. ""They shoot Fat Women..."" is a peek at the actor Delta Burke, and we forget the weight thing.
  Charlene has the baby and doesn't disappoint us with her ongoing naieve, but adorable ways. Mary Jo goes off the deep end to impress a snooty friend with hysterical results, only one of a few surprises about Mary Jo.
  But the best must come last: Julia. Gets her head stuck in a stair bannister after being accused of no sense of humor. Has she completely lost her mind?
  Agreeing to a dance or two with the last hick in Georgia, while Reese Watson looks on with a smirk? I lost count of how many people melted under one of her looks, but as always from the very first episodes to these, it's all the others going off on some whack-job tangent, while Julia is left sometimes only to react-and it's always funny-hysterical-crazy- but all in good taste. Would she have it any other way? Yeah, I'm a Julia fan, and Dixie Carter lives on through a disaster in Japan with Suzanne, a night spent with a man other than Reese, a tornado with the last hick again, and a tipsy rendition of ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" that you won't forget any time soon.

3963188,5,B002OOWKYE,"This has always been one of my favourite and one of the most memorable seasons of Designing Women. The season itself is 5 stars. But I couldn't believe it when I realised that these episodes were completely uncut - bits that I don't ever remember seeing before (and I remember watching Designing Women before syndication). Plus, I love the purple motif! Once again, however (like the season 3 set), the music of the main menu is the same as seasons 1 and 2...oh well! Nice job on this one, can't wait for season 5!",1288483200,4,514,4.4787234042553195
3963189,5,B002OOWKYE,"This series was a standout when it aired on network tv and it hasn't lost any of its impact.  The ensemble cast was excellent, the premise clever, the dialogue crackling and the clothes were to die for.  And, with the recent passing of Dixie Carter it is even more poignant.  She was one classy lady and left us with a wonderful social and comedic legacy.",1288051200,2,355,4.430769230769231
3963190,5,B002OOWKYE,"I do believe Season 4 is the best and funniest season of the show.  Owning these DVDs is essential for anyone who grew up watching ""Designing Women.""
