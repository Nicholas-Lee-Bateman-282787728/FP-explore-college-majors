8584003,5,B00CONRUHM,"I would say a lot of effort went in to this documentary. gathering old historical photos, interviewing old timers or other folks with a knowledge of the life of Everett Ruess. I was initially attracted to Everett Ruess via the silhouette of him leading his burros, because, since 1992 I have been hiking backcountry with an adopted b.l.m. wild burro.  I suppose Everett was appreciative of the burros ""taking a load off"" in his wilderness travels.  Plus those burros undoubtedly gave him some companionship in his wanderings.  a few years ago it seemed a closure was almost reached, in finding the remains of Everett, in some remote Utah landscape. But that turned out to be a false find for Everett, so the mystery continues full force!  I only wish the documentary had uncovered some photos (if any) and contacts Everett made in Superior, Arizona and northward toward Pleasant Valley, still a very remote part of Arizona......",1445040000,,928,4.92948717948718
8584004,5,B00CONRUHM,This is a highly poetic film about an adventurous and complicated young man.  The artistry of the film represents Everett's own artistic sensibilities and intrepid spirit.  This is an interesting and enjoyable film.,1373846400,2,215,5.484848484848484

It made me think about what it means to be in & truly experience wilderness in the Southwest US.  The Dan Bern soundtrack is great too:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wilderness-Song/dp/B009IKWGQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wilderness Song</a>",1368489600,,406,7.458333333333333
