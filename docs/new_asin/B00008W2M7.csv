1864398,4,B00008W2M7,quality of this DVD is good. I have purchased this to listen to the background score composed by Maestro Ilayaraja. Otherwise not a great movie due to too much sorrow filled subject on women's problems in the society. Ilayaraja made this movie a wonderful to watch. Hats of to this great composer.,1300320000,,297,4.730769230769231
1864399,1,B00008W2M7,"The copy I received has no sub-titles and since most of the film is Indian, I could not watch it at all. The description here on Amazon does not state anything either way about this cover version I have so I thought I would write a review about this version of the film so no one else gets caught out like I did. There are several versions listed here for sale, so look for the product details to see if it states sub-titling or not. If it doesn't, don't buy it unless you speak the language!
It's too bad; the movie looks like a very well done film.",1203897600,4,550,4.101851851851852
1864400,4,B00008W2M7,"The plot was interesting enough to get me to watch the movie - a story that narrates the tale of four different women as seen and experienced by one of them. And despite its melodrama, obvious cliches and a lot hamming, the movie made an impact. The central protagonist, or the sutradhar, is Vaidehi (Manisha Koirala). She is the wife of a NRI tycoon - who feels lost in his materialistic world that she finds debase and unfulfilling.

Vaedehi's attempt to escape from this shallow world and preserve her integrity in the process, takes her on a journey - a journey which brings her face to face with some stark, brutal reality. Through her eyes, we witness lives that remind us of the grim situation that continues to exist in India even today. Lives that are representative of the greatest ironies of Indian society - where the female form is worshipped as goddesses on one hand and defiled through practices of dowry, infanticide and rape on the other hand.

The story weaves in an out of the lives of the four protagonists --

Vaidehi, the wife of a selfish, egotistical man. She's being hunted by him and is on the run. A flight the takes off falteringly, but ends with her soaring to reach out for the purposeful-ness she is searching for.

Mythili, the college-educated demure middle-class girl who displays spunk in revolting against the back-breaking dowry demands and the constant humiliation suffered by her father at the hands of her future in laws.

Janaki, the bold and independent small town stage actress who is unabashed about her pre-marital pregnant status - and rises up against the hypocritical standards of proprietary that society imposes solely upon women.

Ramdulaari, the progressive, backward-caste mid-wife living in a small village somewhere in northern India who challenges the oppressive ways of the upper-caste local politician - plodding relentlessly to uplift the dismal status of the women folk.

As the story progresses, we find ourselves, like Vaidehi, drawn into the plight of these women, and are left stunned, disgusted and shamed. Overly-dramatic they maybe, but the tales being played out are real stories of real women in contemporary India. And not too different from Vaidehi, we are left in awe of the way these women choose to stand up and face their grim situation bravely and courageously.

Amongst the performances, Madhuri Dixit steals the show. She sizzles as the brassy nautanki-actress who lives life on her own terms. The entire 'Ramayan' sequence that conveys what is essentially the crux of the movie, is sterling. It draws an analogy between the life of Sita and these women, questions the double standards that exist in the entire Agni Pariksha episode and goes a step further to state that Ram's victory over Ravana would have been futile had it not been for Sita's will to keep Ravan's overtures at bay. Madhuri competently emotes the myriad emotions of heartbreak, disbelief, agony and rage that the character, Janaki, goes through during the course of the stage play - as backstage, she is confronted with the reality of her own life that is coming apart.

The other female leads are adequate and do justice to the roles they are called to enact. The chilling gang-rape scene is chilling and portrayed sensitively, managing to do what it is meant to do - make one cringe.

The male actors complement the female characters and do not attempt to hog the screen. They are presented to us in varying shades of morality - the self-indulgent,arrogant husband (Jackie Shroff); the good-hearted small time thief played by Anil Kapoor. The larger than life, super-heroic Robin Hood-ish Bulla (Ajay Devgan),a character which feels a tad out of place in this tale that is principally intended to be 'feminist' in tone.

The movie by no means is perfect or brilliant. There are plenty of factors that dilute the movies tone and pace - the comedy track, some hackneyed scenes and a lot of true bollywood style high voltage drama. And it never really achieves to strike the chords of conscience in the manner Rajkumar Santoshi's earlier film 'Damini' did. Neither does it match the morally complex terrain 'Damini' drags us into. The situations and characters are either white or black - lacking the subtlety that blurs the line between right and wrong in real-life situations . The only too human mental conflict that a Rishi Kapoor's character goes through is missing, rendering the situations and the people a little unrealistic - and our own involvement in the movie fleeting, being held only as long as the movie lasts.

Nevertheless, I found it engrossing - absorbing enough to make me write about it. And Madhuri Dixit was definitely worth the watch.",1161648000,11,4705,4.9267676767676765
1864401,5,B00008W2M7,"This was the most moving bollywood film I have seen. Honestly, it left me nearly speechless for a day, then I couldn't stop talking about it to my friends. Great cast, excellent production value and direction. It is apparent that the team putting this controversial and meaningful film together believed that this story needed to be told well. Buy several and give them to your friends as gifts. Great movie!",1156896000,5,408,4.8428571428571425
1864402,4,B00008W2M7,"I'm not sure if it was simply my edition of this DVD, but the subtitles in it were quite sparsely placed.  There were whole sections of the movie in which there were no subtitles at all, which only made me feel excluded from what I thought was a truly wonderful movie.  So many great actors and such a valuable social commentary--from what I could understand, this movie really moved me.  I understood the essentials; I just wish I could have had more subtitles, so that I could have been admitted further into the tragic, but ultimately heroic world of these Indian women.",1107561600,16,573,4.598039215686274
1864403,4,B00008W2M7,"The story is about a typical traditional Indian girl (Manisha Koirala) who marries a wealthy Westernized Indian guy (Jackie Shroff), who takes her to america to start a new life. Her husband begins right away, to show her that their marriage has very little integrity as he flaunts casually with other women and expects her to be just as loose as he.  She is totally displeased with her husband and wants to leave him to go back to India. So, he doesn't care.  ""Go!"", he says.  But then, later, he (Jackie Shroff) has a car accident and is injured below the belt. And, as a result of the accident, he is now totally incapable of having a child, and his father expects him to have a son to be an heir to the family wealth.  Later, he discovers that his wife who has left him, IS pregnant with his baby.  He has no interest in saving his marriage, however, his father encourages him to send some of his hired goons to search for her in India, and kill her after the baby is born, and bring the baby back to him.

The movie really begins to take off from here as his wife is constantly on the run from her husband and his hired goons.  She encounters other people throughout the film. So, basically you will get about three more little sub-stories within this film, all leaning on the subject of women and abuse from the men in their lives.  There is a lesson to be learned from all of this, as you can see the dark side of their warped male-dominate religion, as if women were second-class people or less.

Also, many Bollywood favorites are all over this film.  Manisha Koirala, Jackie Shroff, Mahima Chaudhary, Madhuri Dixit, Anil Kapoor, Ajay Devgan, Rekha, Aarti Chabria (I wish she would do more movies, she's gorgeous), and Johnny Lever just to name a few.  This movie also has three great music videos, which star Urmila Matondkar, Sonali Bendre, and Madhuri Dixit.

This is a beautiful, and yet terrifying film.  I highly recommend it.  If you enjoyed ""The Joy Luck Club"", this movie will move you as well.  And I'm sure you can find this movie alot cheaper if you just go to an Indian goods store and ask them to order it for you.  Or you can order on-line (I like to order Indian DVD's from Nehaflix).  You can go to IndiaFM.com and check them out as well.  I go there to download wallpapers and pix of my favorite Bollywood stars from India.

7987425,4,B00008W2M7,"This was my first Bollywood movie. It was really good. Very focused on women's empowerment and the treatment of women in India. I really enjoyed it... although the ending that wrapped everything up was a little... far-fetched and a let down for me, personally... but until like the last 3 minutes it was magical.",1430697600,,312,4.796296296296297
7987426,5,B00008W2M7,"I was lead to this movie via a tumblr post (beware to anyone who says that that site is garbage because it is a source for great information when you want to find it!). A series of gifs highlighted the scene where Ramdulaari saved the child from being drowned, and that's all the information I needed to look for it.

My main issue was with the, somewhat, terrible transitions -especially when they wanted to cut into a random song and dance (apparently that always needs to be included?)- and with the overtly dramatic fight sequences. I understand that they're meant to facilitate and drive home the greater meaning of the movie, it's just that the melodrama of the fighting would take me out of the movie. And with a well written paper, you need to be able to transition from one point to another without making the reader (view) feel as though they've missed something in-between. I had no problems following the story as the entire movie was subtitled (and it'd better be if I'm paying to either rent or buy this!), especially considering that only on Amazon was I able to find it, cuz Netflix doesn't have it and I certainly wasn't able to find it anywhere else with full subtitles (that made sense).
Though the movie mainly centers on the plight of one woman, the three other women served as a models from which she should learn from, and she did! All of them were experiencing: familial, social, and religious injustices in some way and they all found their voices in standing against those issues. Two of them suffered greatly, one even died, but they didn't back down...and that's what Vaidehli had to learn. In learning that she must speak out and stand up against these atrocities, she connects with her fellow countrymen/women and lets them know that their actions are only serving to perpetuate that they experience.

In a market that usually promotes the same ""love"" stories over, and over, and over again, without ever criticizing them, this was a breath of FRESH AIR!!! This is what a movie should do! It should make you think and question what we've been taught to blindly accept as ""fact"". I hope I get to see more of these movies, with these hard-hitting plotlines, because this NEEDS to be talked about and this NEEDS to be seen!!",1427241600,,2251,4.667506297229219
