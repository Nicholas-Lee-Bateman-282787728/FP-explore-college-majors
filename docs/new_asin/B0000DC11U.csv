I URGE ANYONE WITH ANY INTEREST IN CHEVELLE BUY THIS DVD IT'S WELL WORTH IT!!!",1070236800,6,639,4.0
1924022,5,B0000DC11U,"this is a must have for a chevelle fan!  I was hoping for a few more songs off ""point #1"", which is my favorite album.  But in all very good show, good sound quality.  They mostly play songs from ""Wonder what's next"" and a few from ""Point #1"".  But if you've ever seen chevelle live you know you want this.",1180224000,,306,4.05
1924023,5,B0000DC11U,"This band is very tight in this DVD.  I have over 60 live DVDs and this one of my favorites.  I hope they put out a new one soon with songs like ""Clincher"" and ""Vitamin R (Leading Us Along)"" added to the mix.",1149897600,,208,3.813953488372093
1924024,5,B0000DC11U,THIS CONCERT DVD IS THIS BEST EVER AND A DEFINITE RECOMMENDATION FOR CHEVELLE FANS YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!,1141344000,,112,4.947368421052632
1924025,5,B0000DC11U,"to the guy below ripping them because they're not ""tight"" and the sound isn't good... give them a break.  They're a trio and they're playing in a small venue.  They're going to sound different than their studio albums because they can't over layer the guitar parts and such.  Also, the small venue means they probably didn't bring in tons of gear, etc.  Plus, its an entire concert... not just a collage of cut and paste of the best moments.  Other concert videos that I've seen that have great sound, etc all have larger bands, more equipment, and cuts.  Chevelle is a very good band with a tremendous studio sound that would be almost impossible to recreate live with just the 3 brothers.",1108252800,6,690,4.614754098360656
1924026,1,B0000DC11U,"Ya, there albums may be good, but Chevelle aren't the type to put on a good rock live concert. If you wanna see a awesome rock show, check out Evanescence's new release ""Anywhere But Home,"" which is a live show of them in Paris.",1101427200,,228,4.204545454545454
1924027,2,B0000DC11U,"don't get me wrong, i like Chevelle and ""Wonder What's Next"" is one of the best albums among those thousands of CD i've own.  so when i knew they had a live DVD release, i just went to the shop and bought it.

The thing is, they are not tight playing live, their performance is bad and boring,  songs like ""Family System"", ""Don't Fake This"", ""the Red"", ""Send the Pain Below"", ""Until You're Reformed"" are badly performed, and are ruined by their fallen-apart performance, i love thier album much more than their live, which are much tighter and much more creative.",1100649600,4,563,4.554455445544554
1924028,5,B0000DC11U,"this dvd is awesome, im a huge chevelle fan and got the dvd and the live cd around the same time. The dvd really gives a good idea of what the atmosphere of the concert may be like. The extras i think are cooler then the concert all together mainly ""Pay Your Dues"" overall if you like Chevelle, get this dvd NOW. You won't regret it.",1095984000,2,333,4.0606060606060606
1924029,5,B0000DC11U,"I picked up Chevelle's first DVD release, ""Live From The Norva"" about two weeks after seeing them perform live. Maybe it was the experience of seeing the band live (we don't get many good bands around here...), but to me, this is an excellent representation of the group and brings back the concert to my mind very vividly each time I watch it. Just like their music, Chevelle's live show is stripped down, yet very passionate, emotional and intense. All three brothers work together and compliment each other very nicely on each song. Pete's vocals are strong the whole way through, as he hardly ever misses a note or a lyric while trashing about on his guitar. Sam's drum-work provides a catchy back-ground for the music, while Joe's bass works almost like a second guitar, adding more dimension and crunch to the mere three-person band. The band blazes effortlessly and breezily through the short fourteen song set, pulling out all of their hits (""The Red,"" ""Send The Pain Below""), some old stuff (""Mia,"" ""Point #1"" (my favorite Chevelle song)), some rarely heard songs (""Sma,"" ""Don't Fake This"") and even a b-side (""Until You're Reformed"" from the 'Daredevil' soundtrack). I have watched this DVD many times in the near-year I have owned it and can tell you that if you love the band, it is worth the money. It is somewhat lacking in special features (how about some music videos?), but the concert is strong enough, it's forgiven (add to that a fair price).

Tracklisting:

01. Family System

02. Forfeit

Also included is a pre-show interview with the band (pretty cool) called ""Pay Your Dues"" and some standard photo-gallery and discography features. Overall, an excellent little package, and goes well with the CD ""Live From The Road,"" which, while not as extensive as this, is still worth checking out.",1094342400,6,2040,4.785714285714286
1924030,5,B0000DC11U,"I'm a fan of Chevelle, so when I bought this DVD I was suprised at how good the music is when they are live. They basically play the whole Wonder What's Next album with 3 songs from Point #1 and 1 song from the Daredevil Soundtrack.

They provide a good solid performance, hopefully the next DVD they make will have the same energy  as this one.

BUY THIS DVD NOW!!!!",1092096000,,367,4.214285714285714
1924031,5,B0000DC11U,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS DVD! I am a huge Chevelle fan, but so far have been unable to see them live. The music they create with 2 guitars and drums is EXTRAORDINARY!  I find it intense and addicting. I thought some songs sounded even better live than the cd version (Family Sytem, An Evening with El Diablo, Until you're Reformed, Point#1). After watching this DVD I can't wait to see them live and will be sure to catch them in concert the next time they tour. If you are a chevelle fan this DVD is a MUST HAVE!",1089763200,,511,4.214285714285714

8000657,5,B0000DC11U,"my favorite albums chevelle put out are on this dvd. good sound quality, if you wanna remember concerts, this brings back some pretty good memories.",1325030400,,148,4.96
8000658,5,B0000DC11U,"If you are a Chevelle fan you will love this DVD, this is Pete and the boys back in the day when they didn't care and there sound was right. The extra features section is great filled with some behind the scenes and back stage stuff along with when they go to radio stations for interviews. The concert itself it amazing it's Pete, Sam and Joe before he was replaced by Dean letting it rip on there instruments and is quite evident as you see some of Sam's sticks snap and go flying through out the performance and Pete snaps some strings. All in all 5 out of 5 and I highly recommend getting it and a good match up to this DVD is there CD ""Live from the Road"" from the same time period and if you can believe it they play even harder on the CD.",1323216000,,745,4.04054054054054
8000659,5,B0000DC11U,"i don't understand how you can claim to be a fan of chevelle and then write a review bashing this DVD. ive seen chevelle live several times and i can say that this DVD is a very accurate description of how the band performs live. their shows are very intense and intimate seeing as how they play mostly small venues. they bring an awesome level of intensity that comes out even in the DVD. my only complaint is that these guys haven't released a newer and updated version with songs from ""This type of thinking"" and ""Vena Sera."" this band has only gotten better over time and im anxious to see them again. Chevelle ROCKS!",1214697600,,621,4.408695652173913
