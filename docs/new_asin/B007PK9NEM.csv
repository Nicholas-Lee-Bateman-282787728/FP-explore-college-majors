8520449,1,B007PK9NEM,"William Victor Schotten found some old Super 8 tapes at a yard sale and decided to make a zombie movie without many zombies. After the holocaust and the neighborhood has been run over by bad zombie actors, Dave Dommin and two diverse couples camp out in his basement for 60 minutes of personal conflict. Yawn. Oh yeah, one girl is a stripper in costume. Dave explains what is happening with the TV, ""That is called a test pattern."" In this conflict we discover strippers and their boyfriends use drugs and Christians go to strip joints. A pregnant woman has an injury, not too hard to figure out where this goes even for Scooby-Doo. Very boring stuff.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1441584000,,685,4.614754098360656
8520450,3,B007PK9NEM,"The cover art is misleading. There are no winged demons and nothing catches fire. I suspect the slick artwork leads people to believe the film is of the same sophistication. It is not and never was intended to be. You have to go into this one understanding that it is a low budget indie type project.

It has its' moments. Two extras in zombie ghoul get-up walk down the street carrying body parts. It is so plainly presented as to be half brilliant. There is a highbrow element to this film as well. External demons as a force of nature make people confront their own inner demons. And the soundtrack music is good.

Not a complete film and remember it is threadbare but it does have some high points. Give the director a budget and they might go somewhere.",1420156800,,758,4.446043165467626

So,WWMM let me look at BELOW GROUND and it has alot of neat touches that fascinated this reviewer.

This is from the filmmaker who made the documentary,THE BRASS RING,and its the journey re-taken of all micro-budget rookies in OHIO,Trying to recreate their own little Hollyweird.

So,The wife has me watching THE STRAIN & LAST SHIP tv series and so the plague and virus as a villian is going around currently for fans.

BELOW GROUND is similar to those shows and yet has a micro-budget tinge that includes a found footage angle and zombies,Even some tributes to Night Of The Living Dead spread through out production.",1405987200,,668,5.045454545454546
8520452,4,B007PK9NEM,"I was so impressed with this! The idea of someone documenting a demon invasion on film is just so novel to me. The whole movie is chaos, between the demonic & human, and between all those trying to survive. The suspense is killer. This was a good one!",1374969600,,251,4.25

8520456,1,B007PK9NEM,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS, EVEN FOR FREE OR LIKE ME YOU'LL REGRET IT. WORST PLOTLESS STUPID AND POINTLESS MOVIE IN HISTORY

Okay I was looking for a movie to watch summary sounded decent gave it a try OMG it's more like a cheap knock off of ( Night Of The Living Dead ) it should be called ( NIGHT OF THE LIVING MORONS ) The summary mentions demons, where are they? Here's the so called plot guy with a camera doing documentay, so called demons carrying around body parts are briefly seen here and there, sound familiar? yup zombies. Camera guy takes in 4 people stripper with abusive ex boyfriend, guy with pregnant girlfriend. All they do is argue while the frickin camera records them and that's what about 99% of this nightmare is. It might be amusing after drinking a quart of hard liquor muwhahaha, dear lord what's left of my brain is bleeding",1372809600,,864,4.4
8520457,4,B007PK9NEM,"You know it funny, sometimes I read the other reviews on Amazon and I wonder if they saw the same movie I did. Anyway, whatever the case may be I dug this flick. Creepy indie movie that will get your heart racing.",1362441600,,213,4.095238095238095
8520458,2,B007PK9NEM,"This is a movie that isn't good enough to watch again and was quite forgetable. I watched this movie a week ago and really can't remember a single thing about it. What I do remember is that there wasn't enough action to catch my attention, nor enough drama to make the story memorable. Below average special effects and acting highlight this forgetable fare.",1344211200,,358,4.698412698412699
