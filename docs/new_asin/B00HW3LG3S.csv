6231301,2,B00HW3LG3S,"So, here we arrive at the series finale of Laverne & Shirley, arguably the weakest link in the sitcom's historic 8-yr run.  In summary, there really isn't much to say about this particular season.  Cindy Williams was only present for the first two episodes.  ""Window on Main Street"" is worth a few good laughs, however  the other episodes after her exodus were fairly substandard.  We see Laverne dealing with Shirley's sudden departure, and after getting fired from Bardwell's, see her accepting a job at an aeronautical facility.  We also see her sentenced to death row in a case of mistaken identity? (2 part episode).  I kid you not.  It's in this season where we discover  (sort of) why Edna left Frank, Laverne apparently now has ""ghosts"" in her apartment, we saw how Michael McKean mysteriously vanished from the final episodes for some never-explained reason, Squiggy has no real point or purpose, Rhonda-Lee tries her darndest at singing and playing a trumpet for some big-shot executive hanging out in Cowboy Bill's, Frank decides to run for city council (and of course loses), and Eddie Mekka basically realizes his career in California is on the skids and decides to move off to NYC to try his luck on Broadway instead.  That about sums it all up in a nutshell, folks.

Season 8 is a perfect example of why they should have called it quits after season 7.  Once Cindy Williams made her exit, the series should have been cancelled outright and the time slot filled with re-runs.  The show had become a shadow of its former self, the writing and storylines ridiculous, and everyone looked liked they were just standing around waiting for their final paychecks so they could move on to other endeavors.  In retrospect, the show was way past its prime at this point and the lack of any new material--or characters--was the final straw.  Interestingly enough, Penny Marshall's biography, ""My Mother Was Nuts"", discusses the strange circumstances surrounding seasons 6-8, and why ABC quietly dropped the series from its lineup.  Marshall herself admits the program was a total DISASTER in its final season.  It was almost like the writers/producers simply lost their way.

This show deserved so much more, and a way better grand finale, IMO.  At least we'll have our memories of what was once the most popular sitcom on prime-time TV.  Glad we now have the entire collection on DVD however, even though it took us 10yrs to finally reach the end...

And that's a wrap, folks.  Laverne & Shirley rides off into the sunset of golden comedy classics. I have to admit, the restoration on most of these DVD sets has so far been very well done, however there WAS some obvious editing done here and there, so be aware there might be some missing segments or footage on certain episodes. In any case, the reproduction here is quite impressive.  Pictures are clean and crisp with minimal graininess, colors are bright and vivid.  Look for special guest stars Shecky Greene, James Belushi, Adam West, Jay Leno, Carol Kane,  Joanna Kerns, The Spinners, Louise Lasser, and the late Larry Breeding this season too.

Enjoy the trip down memory lane nonetheless...

*UPDATE*  I have now watched all three discs.  Again, I noticed some minor editing done here and there on certain segments(mostly pertaining to songs and music clearances), while the last two episodes: ""Councilman DeFazio"", and ""Here Today, Hair Tomorrow"", are shown out of sequence.  Why on earth the geniuses at Paramount didn't catch this faux-pas is beyond me.  Other than that, it's OK.  We now have the entire complete collection, seasons 1-8, so I guess I can't complain too much.",1391904000,35,3643,4.892332789559544
6231302,3,B00HW3LG3S,Shirley left after the second eposide (Shirley gets married - 1st eposide to army doc (not long time love Carmine) and 2nd eposide she is pregant). Third eposide she is no longer on. I think this ended the show because it was not the same withour Shirley. They still called it Laverne & Shirley but it was only Laverne and mostly Squiggy. Lenny was not on that much either. I said in the previous season Edna was gone. I enjoyed one eposide with Vicky Lawrence playing Sgt. Plout out of the Army for pregnancy leave and to win a contest - to double her chances to win it - Laverne helps by entering too and fake to be pregnant. I think the show should have ended in season 7 with Carmine marrying Shirley and Laverne should have found some one. Season eight was not strong.,1390867200,31,773,4.337931034482758

6231421,4,B00HW3LG3S,"What can I say, what is Laverne and Shirley w/o Shirley? Not as good, but Penny Marshall did a heck of a job carrying the show almost entirely on her own w/o help from the rest of the cast. We rarely see Carmine or Lenny. The only character we do see a lot of is Squiggy and the ever annoying Rhonda. This a must have to complete your collection and while some episodes were just downright boring or stupid, this season managed to showcase the incredible acting talents of Penny Marshall. Many had me laughing harder than episodes that showcased Laverne & Shirley together! It's a shame she didn't go farther in acting, because she was a brilliant comedian. However, having seen her movies that she directed, I can say she is clearly a multi-talented woman and I would love to meet her someday. The major con was there was no real ending to this series. I believe they had to have some inkling it wasn't going to be renewed and could have found a better way to tidy up the ending. It felt nothing like a a last episode of neither a season, nor a series finale. I was certain there must be me one more episode on the disc, but to my dismay, nothing.",1451606400,6,1148,4.319444444444445

6231423,5,B00HW3LG3S,Laverne and Shirley season 8 is okay. I'm a die hard Laverne and Shirley fan. I even have Laverne and Shirley tattooed on my leg. Penny Marshall gives rave performance as usual.,1448582400,,177,4.5625
6231424,3,B00HW3LG3S,"I guess Shirley had to marry who she did. Her fling with Carmine was only P/T,but the manshe marriedwasa DOCTOR,and throughout theshow she wanted to marry one. Some say Laverne should have marriedLenny. The attraction was all 1 way-Lenny would gladlyhave done that,but,you may remember,Laverne found Lenny a turn-off anda jerk. Besides,Laverne marryinganybody wouldhaveworkedtochangeherpersonality-unlucky at love,but always going for thesingle guys would become a thing of the past.
The show's STYLE is physical humor,so it needs a stooge. But a stooge can be anyone,as long as that person is onthe recieving end. L&S humor depended on that. The problem isn't assimple as some think. It's that the cast is filtering out,making less and less stooges available. Any half-decent writer should have seen that,because it couldhave beeneasily corrected.",1447027200,,848,5.68503937007874

6231462,1,B00HW3LG3S,"I bought this season to complete my collection and was very disappointed.  I read all the bad reviews but bought it anyways because it went down to 8.00 with free shipping. This season was nothing like the other seasons and was clearly thrown together last minute. I like this series because it is wholesome to watch and felt season 8 was quite the opposite. Laverne had a sance in her apartment to get rid of a ghost, this is only one example of the decline of this series.",1434412800,3,474,4.386363636363637
6231463,4,B00HW3LG3S,"I honestly favored season 8 over  seasons  5, 6 and 7.  The worst episode of season 8 was when Shirley got married.  It wasn't funny... it was stupid!  Believe me, Laverne did just fine without her mate.  And as far as the other character are concerned, They were all in enough episodes to where you didn't miss them in a few other episodes.",1434153600,3,341,4.333333333333333

6231505,3,B00HW3LG3S,"i'm the first reviewer? i guess that's not so weird since this is basically a throwaway end to an otherwise great show. sorry for the spoiler, but after two episodes (maybe three- who can remember?) the show should be called, ""laverne."" shirley moves away, and laverne continues her usual schtick on her own. penny marshall's usual highly entertaining energy just isn't the same without cindy williams there to play off. i enjoy the mind-numbing tv of my youth, so this is an okay buy for me, but if you're going to buy just one season of l&s, don't make it this one.",1409875200,6,567,4.568627450980392

6231548,2,B00HW3LG3S,"Although this was not a good season, it did have its moments . I only bought it to complete the set. Cindy Williams did not leave the show only because of her pregnancy, there was a lot of tension between her and Penny Marshall and her husband was also making a lot of demands from the studio. (Notice a few episodes at the end of 7 where Shirley went out of town or only showed up at the beginnings and ends of some episodes.) Several episodes with special guest stars were reworked scripts that originally had Shirley in them.  Edna had actually left the show at the end of Season 6. Michael McKean left the show halfway through season 8 to film ""This Is Spinal Tap"".",1402963200,7,669,4.309523809523809

6231550,3,B00HW3LG3S,"Frankly, I knew what to expect from previous reviews, but just a bit more of delicious wit from this classic duo & cast is worth it. Not being a Hollywood gossip type, I will never understand why the show's cast  was decimated; the old cast goes through the motions, their heart isn' in it't but he loss of Shirley is very sad. too bad",1401580800,6,335,4.234375
6231551,1,B00HW3LG3S,"II only bought this to finish off the set.  Cindy leaving killed the show. If she was pregnant and they already worked that into  the show and she was having trouble,  they should have worked around it.  And who is this Walter guy?  She should have  married Carmine.  Then if she had problems with her real pregnancy, that could have been worked in and given excuses for her to be sitting alot.  Many of the episodes are just not funny.",1401580800,14,436,4.3625

6231554,5,B00HW3LG3S,"In my own opinion i thought the final season of L&S was amazing,even though it was sad to see that Shirley was only in 2 episodes. But still the show went on with Laverne and Squiggy,frank,Carmine,Rhonda. m glad that i own all 8 seasons because to tell you guys the truth this season was pretty sad,to see some people leave,dont wanna ruin it for some people who have not seen it yet. But This season was also very funny,it had me in tears,and it was the best. I thought all of the episodes are funny. This is a MUST watch. I love this show and the series.

6231556,4,B00HW3LG3S,"Yes, the producers handled Cindy Williams' departure poorly (she never should've been fired, anyway) but this season is not as dreadful as some would have you believe! This DVD set is worth getting, if only for the 2-part 'Death Row' episodes, which, in my opinion, are classics. Yes, Laverne falls in with a group (including guest star Laraine Newman!) who rob a bank, ends up in jail, and through a case of mistaken identity ends up on death row. You would think that would be crazy enough, but no--in the second part they threw in a musical number! I seriously believe these episodes inspired the Bjork movie 'Dancer in the Dark' (and are actually better). In addition, there is an episode in which Laverne and guest star Carrie Fisher(!) become Playboy Bunnies. Also, there is the odd back-door pilot episode of the Carmine-moving-to-New-York-to-be-on-Broadway spinoff that never happened...but you get to see Eddie Mekka with his shirt off, and that's nice. (The very handsome Ben Powers appears in this episode, and also part one of the Death Row episode.) Finally, I really enjoy the opening credit sequence (stating simply 'Laverne') with Laverne watching some kids doing the 'Shlemiel Shlemazl' march.",1393718400,5,1210,5.085427135678392
6231557,1,B00HW3LG3S,"Gary Marshall (creator/ producer) said that within his four successful series, this cast was the hardest to rein-in. This season is, ""peculiar"" to say the least.  Leads Cindy Williams and Penny Marshall were feuding, with the former feeling slighted by the Marshall clan production. Williams, then pregnant, leaves the show. This fractured the cast.  Shirley's step-mom Edna is never seen again, with a lame mid-season statement that she left Papa DiFazio. And Lenny does only a few episodes and vanishes too- though they keep shots of him in the intro and closure. This was more like Twilight Zone, as people kept disappearing! So there you are- minus three main characters. One word fits- pitiful. This ranks with the final season of Roseann. Gary Marshall should have brought in another Shirley (a different character), and maybe brought the series back to it's midwest roots in a ""missing season"" (perhaps a time when Shirley Feeney spends 15 months in Cosmotology school and sublets to another Shirley. Since Shirley was a popular name in 1960 due to Shirley Temple). But this season is substandard, despite Penny Marshall's talents.",1392595200,20,1138,5.145945945945946

8636762,5,B00HW3LG3S,"I was never a big fan of Laverne & Shirley, but I thought it was a funny show. I grew up more with Happy Days and remember the times when Laverne & Shirley guest starred on Happy Days. With that said, I had a huge crush on Carrie Fisher in the 80's. I thought she was so pretty and she had a great body! She also was a good actress in the roles she was offered. Carrie guest starred on am episode called ""The Playboy Show"" Laverne decides to tryout to be a bunny for Hugh Hefner. She meets Carrie at the audition and they have a very funny scene with Squiggy. Later on they audition for Hugh Hefner while wearing their bunny outfits. Penny Marshall actually looked pretty good, but Carrie Fisher looked incredible! I could not take mt eyes off of her the whole time she wore the bunny outfit! I thought Penny had some very funny moments. When Carrie knocks over the milk on the table, Penny cleans it up with her bunny tail! I thought she nailed that scene. It was so funny. With that said, Carrie Fisher steals this episode. The bunny suit she wears is more memorable to me than the slave outfit in Jedi, or the bra and slip in Under the Rainbow. The best part with Carrie in the bunny suit is near the end where she chases down Hef before he leaves. Her cute butt is bouncing up and and down for all to see. I am surprised that was allowed to be shown on tv at that time. Great Episode!",1511740800,,1388,4.144444444444445
