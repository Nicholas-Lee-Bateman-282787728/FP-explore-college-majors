2555090,5,B000F8O364,"This is an excellent DVD. Anyone who plays steel guitar can learn something from this DVD. All shots angles and views are clearly captured by the cameras. Tommy does an exceptional job of explaining the course. Personally, I am trying to decide which I liked the best, the instruction or the demonstration. Killer tone in his hands and in that good ole Emmons he was playing !!!",1174953600,3,378,4.656716417910448

8119188,5,B000F8O364,"As some people know. Tommy White is the staff Pedal Steel Guitar player on the Grand Ol Opry. Because he is the best if not
one of the best Pedal Steel Players around. In the video he is playing an Emmons steel but now he plays a Show Pro where he
has his own line of pedal steel guitars. I know because I know the owner. Anyways, this video is wonderfully made and Tommy
does a nice job walking you through some of his hot licks. You don't have to read tableture to learn from this video it is simple
and easy to learn. I would love to meet Tommy some day he seems like a nice gentleman and maybe I could barrow more of
his hot licks. Thank you Tommy and everyone who helped make this video; great job! Amazon thanks again you hit a home
run with this one.

8119191,5,B000F8O364,"Hot Licks and Cool Tips for the E9th Tuning is an instructional video for pedal steel guitar, specifically the E9th neck(sometimes called the 'Kroger neck', 'cause it's the one that buys the groceries!) It is jam packed with exercises, runs, licks and rhythm fills, and Tommy explains how to use your own imagination to expand and build on what he teaches you, which you must know how to do, if you ever want to be close to the caliber player he is. He teaches harmonics, and bar control also. Well worth the price of the DVD are the two tunes he plays at the beginning/introduction of the DVD, and at the end, where he gives you a demonstration of just how beautiful and melodic and soulful an instrument the pedal steel is in the hands of someone who has PRACTICED and is dedicated. If you play pedal steel, or want to, this DVD is a true must-have!!!",1350432000,4,853,4.439490445859873
