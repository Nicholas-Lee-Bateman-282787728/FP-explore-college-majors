In the TV series, Ataru (a normal but VERY unlucky boy) has to save the world from aliens called Unis.
He does save the world, but Lum (the Uni princess) thinks Ataru loves him over a BIG mistake (To save the world he had to touch Lum's horns, and before touching them he shouted ""FOR THE MARRAGE!"" and ""I will marry you!"" but he meant for his girlfriend Shinobu.)
In this movie, Lum gets uni-napped by an alien (forgot his name).
Later in the movie she leaves Ataru for him and tries to force Ataru to say that he loves her.
I won't tell you the ending, you must rent the movie and find out yourself!",1005782400,,689,4.2272727272727275
