8053362,5,B0007XC8W8,"I listened to a DOZEN different music samples for children's praise and worship songs for my 2 year old and 6 month old to listen to, and this is by far the BEST album out there! It has a lot of variety in the songs, and it's even enjoyable for me to listen to! I don't get tired of listening to the songs. Great CD! Children's minds are like sponges at this age, so I take comfort in knowing I'm filling my children's minds with Biblical things.",1337731200,,446,4.137931034482759
