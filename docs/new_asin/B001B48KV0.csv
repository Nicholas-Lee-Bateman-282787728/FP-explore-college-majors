MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY (1993) is an often frenetic Woody Allen whodunit spoof that reunites him with ANNIE HALL co-star Diane Keaton. Although they're great together, Allen scripted this long-time married couple as engaged in an annoying years-long bout of bickering. Also with Alan Alda as Woody's writer pal, who's been lusting after Keaton from afar, and Anjelica Huston as another author who's got her eye on Allen, her editor/mentor at a top NYC publisher.

Woody senses Alda and Diane are too cozy, so he fixes his buddy up with Huston, but this occurs after Keaton becomes obsessed with the sudden death of a next door neighbor, a woman she and Woody just met. Keaton's convinced the husband murdered his wife. Whether events and clues will eventually prove her correct you'll have to see for yourself. For certain the exploration of this mystery involves some pretty unusual and dangerous situations.

Also with Jerry Adler and Lynn Cohen as the neighbors, plus Ron Rifkin, Joy Behar and Marge Redmond, playing a late-arriving character who figures large in the story.",1386201600,,1295,5.127962085308057
