8750366,4,B01BIZRK4Y,"While this DVD does contain some excellent footage, potential buyers should be aware that it is NOT a new production linked to the release of the new Jungle Book.  It is a pair of BBC programs - Wild India and Wild China.  The Wild India chapter of this DVD is the episode of Wild India called The Tiger's Domain, from November 1997.  It is a good program, and mentions Kipling and Kipling country while featuring animals from tigers and a sloth bear to the dhole.  The bonus chapter on the Tibetan brown bear contains much more from a Wild China episode.
The Wild India episode has an older, slightly grainy appearance as opposed to the vivid recent BBC programming.  Both chapters present entertaining material and are probably hard to obtain in any other form.  I was expecting current material on Kipling country and the status of its wildlife.  It is worthwhile, just the same.",1461196800,11,882,4.688311688311688
