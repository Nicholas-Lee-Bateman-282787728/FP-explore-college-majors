7803524,5,6300153843,"I've shown this to many a child, and they just love it!  I agree with other reviewers that it's a bit dated, but it's still worth the purchase.  I find it to be best suited for ages 3 - 7.  Try to introduce children to pop-up books and nursery rhymes before they watch it.  The VHS is the old version, but it can be had in a digitally re-mastered DVD under the title of The Classic Nursery Rhymes Collection.",1411516800,,408,4.1265822784810124

7803529,5,6300153843,"If there is one video that is timeless, it is this! My children, in their teens now, were addicted to this old world charm. My older one, who was a fussy eater, happily gulped his meals while entranced by these rhymes! I have gifted this to several kids. Makes a perfect Birthday gift for toddlers. Distinctly British, the video holds a great appeal to people around the globe.
It's a pity this collection is becoming scarce. This is a must for every generation of kids, present and future.",1043452800,,490,4.579545454545454
7803530,5,6300153843,I have taught for eighteen years and I have a special love for this video as a teacher of children.  This video brings to life the old world nursery rhymes.  The format is that of a pop-up book opening up it's pages for the different rhymes. Super-imposed real children and adult characters sing and act out the poems.  The English accents of the performers give it an authentic feel for where these nursery rhymes come from. I want to find more copies so my adult children can have their own copy for their children!,1016236800,11,517,4.4787234042553195
