2684249,5,B000K7UBUM,"G.K. Chesterton was the first president of the Detection Club. Dorothy L. Sayers, author of the Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries, was the second. As Dale Ahlquist points out in The Apostle of Common Sense, early authors of detective fiction had a problem. They couldn't out do Conan Doyle, then all the rage. Rather than take on Sherlock Holmes, Chesterton did something entirely different with Father Brown.

He drew from his friend, Father John O'Connor, for certain particulars of Father Brown, but he got the idea overhearing an aside from two Oxford undergraduates saying what a shame it was for a man to throw himself away in the priesthood, avoiding, as he must be, the various shocks of the real world. Chesterton found amusing the idea that a priest who did almost nothing but hear grisly confessions should know nothing of the dark side of human nature. Therefore, Father Brown says things like this: ""You see it was I who killed all those people...I mean that I thought and thought about how a man might come to be like that until I realized that I really was like that in everything but actual final consent to the action.""

Father Brown stories began appearing in The Saturday Evening Post in 1910, and found their way onto TV in the states when they aired on PBS' ""Mystery!"" in the mid- '70s. There is one sense in which these shows differ from the books, and that is that they lack the narrator. The surprise is how well they hold up without it, and in the British TV tradition of ""less is more"", evoke the sense of fog surrounding the various cases and which Kenneth More as the unassuming little priest progressively cuts through. These seven episodes from ATV released through Granada run about 365 minutes and include brief bios of Chesterton and the cast. ""I always like to try the local ale,"" says Father Brown. Quaffing that British beverage is a bit like meeting Father Brown, who begins as a stranger and ends as a friend.

The seven episodes of Series One include:

The Hammer of God, The Oracle of the Dog, The Curse of the Golden Cross, The Eye of Apollo, The Three Tools of Death, The Mirror of the Magistrate and The Dagger with Wings.",1169424000,76,2159,4.629242819843342

2684272,4,B000K7UBUM,A funny clever show.  The only reason to rate 4 stars is how old the show is...  70s.  Great for binge watching,1485475200,,111,3.9545454545454546
2684273,4,B000K7UBUM,Great stories. G.K. Chesterton was a good writer and Christian apologist. Decent production of his stories. Suffers from age -- 40+ years old and the production values of the era detract from the casting and the presentation.,1484697600,,225,5.108108108108108

2684276,5,B000K7UBUM,"Much better series than the newer Father Brown.  Father Brown behaves as the character created by Chesterton, that is to say he makes sound moral judgements as well as solving murders without causing the police to hate him.  The series feels a little slow to today's standard, but I like the simplicity of it.  The stories are well thought out and suspenseful.  Very entertaining!",1483401600,,380,4.890625

Initially, the series held promise, with wry Chesterton quotes regarding the lack of historic churches in the U.K. belonging to Catholics, due to Henry VIII. But there are problematic issues regarding poor adaptation overall. In ""The Curse of the Golden Cross"" there are inaccurate, disturbing, and shockingly antisemitic phrases regarding medieval burnings, and rich, smug Jews scoffing.  This narrative is not acceptable, at present or when written in 1974 - only 29 years after the end of WWII.

2684428,5,B000K7UBUM,"These stories are genius when viewed with the knowledge that Chesterton wrote the Father Brown stories in response to Arthur Conon Doyle's Sherlock Holmes mysteries.  Holmes like all modern detectives (think CSI or Bones) was the first to look for minutia to solve crimes without giving much thought to the moral offense itself or the underlying sins of the perpetrator.  Chesterton believed we can make best sense of the world not by isolating its material data but by understanding the people who live in it. One thing in common about all the Father Brown stories is that the logical conclusion of the clues presented in each case point to different outcomes, but the knowledge that a priest is particularly privy to about human nature, especially the sources of evil, point to the true outcome. Someone once remarked that Beethoven composed masterpieces and the result was beautiful music but that Mozart's music seems woven from the very fabric of nature, not composed at all but coaxed. I see Chesterton's stories like Mozart music.",1405036800,6,1037,5.023255813953488

I saw the first episode on a PBS station and it was interesting and had a soundtrack with music background on it.  I was surprised and disappointed to find these episodes have nothing for audio background and are rather dull.  Didn't really have an issue with the video portion although I've certainly seen much better filming with other series.  Just greatly disappointed as I thought this would be a new mystery series I could enjoy.

2684475,4,B000K7UBUM,"Kenneth more plays father Brown in this series based on G. K. Chesterton's books.  I cannot tell you how close this comes to the books themselves as I have not read them yet.

Each episode is a complete story in itself where we meet the characters, build up the mystery, try to second-guess father Brown, and wrap up in the end.  Actually the ending of his stories are not that neatly wrapped as he usually leaves it to the culprit to do the right thing.

Dennis Burgess plays Hercule Flambeau (Father Brown's friend); he is advertised throughout the DVD but does not show up for several episodes.

I have to admit that several times on my first viewing I had the stop and think about where I have seen the actor(s) before.

The quality of each story varies widely so there will be some favorites and some duds depending on what you want to see.  The production itself looks quite inexpensive and locations and production sets.  The quality of the recording leaves something to be desired; I am not sure if it is the original recording or the media.

2684477,5,B000K7UBUM,"This is the first of two DVD box sets of the short-lived ""Father Brown"" British TV series from the 1970s. Like many other Acorn Media DVD releases of old television shows, the packaging consists of a box with two DVD keep cases inside, with three or four hourlong episodes on each of the two discs. Having seen the BBC's slick new ""Father Brown"" series with Mark Williams on PBS, I'm surprised to admit that I much prefer this older series. Unlike the Williams version, these older episodes with Kenneth More stick closely to the original GK Chesterton short stories, and even the divergences from Chesterton's original novel are done more for the sake of visualization than for the sake of creative rewriting. Where the Mark Williams series uses Chesterton's stories more as a general framework for launching wholly original plots and dialogue, this show maintains the elegant wordplay and moral-deductive reasoning of Chesterton's original stories. Kenneth More plays Father Brown closer the style of Chesterton's eccentric priest-detective than Williams, who comes across in the new series as more of a generic amateur sleuth. With his absentminded asides and brilliant facial expressions, More nails the abstracted and seemingly meaningless flights of reasoning that often carry the titular priest to brilliant solutions of murder cases. Where the new ""Father Brown"" reduces characters and plot elements to the most generic possible interpretations, giving us lots of people rifling through desks, this older show takes greater care over the actual mysteries, focusing more on plot than on the slick editing and visuals of the Williams version. While this older program has a cheaper look than the new show, it is more intelligent and more faithful to the literary source material, and it offers a surprising number of distinguished British guest stars like Bernard Lee of James Bond fame. As Chesterton conceived it after meeting a real-life priest who knew more about practical matters than he did, Father Brown is an unassuming parish priest in 1920s Britain who grasps worldly matters better than he lets on and who invariably deduces the solutions of murder mysteries through his brilliant moral insights into the natures of different people. The central paradox of Father Brown, evident in More's subtle interpretation, is that his Catholicism makes him far less superstitious and far more level-headed than many people allegedly freed of religious superstitions. There's very little of this characterization in the bland Mark Williams show, but Kenneth More presents it in spades. In Williams, you rarely hear anything that sounds like Chesterton, but this older show preserves the original dialogue of the stories, and More really makes it sing. If you're a fan of the original stories, this the Father Brown to watch.",1382227200,13,2830,5.249448123620309

The books are better, but the strength of the story remains in the movies. I like reading the books better because it gives me more time to think about Chesterton's insights into human character. Of course, after reading the Father Brown stories, being able to see them as they  might have occurred in history makes them somehow more and less real. More real because of the details of setting and action and less real because of the improbability that a priest could get around that much to experience all those situations in the society of that time.

2684568,4,B000K7UBUM,"For the longest time, I put off watching this series simply because I doubted the sleuthing credibility of a priest - though if anyone could pull it off, I should have known it would be G.K. Chesterton. His character proved to be as much a bastion of rationality and reason as was the author, and while this series was not the most intricately plotted of mysteries, they were clever and engaging nonetheless. Undoubtedly, this amateur detective is one of the most underrated in fiction, and I think most lovers of British mysteries should enjoy this. Especially for the lovely sets that so well portrayed British life during the time period (late 1920s), which were for me a large part of its appeal.

Of course, a series revolving around a Catholic priest is bound to touch on religious issues, though while every episode did contain a message, I felt it was not so overdone save for in the first episode, which tended towards preachiness. Otherwise, the mysteries were satisfying, character driven - and unlike some other reviewers, I found that the acting was generally well done, especially in regards to Kenneth More as Father Brown. I cannot heap enough praise on him, or the way he conveys such a subtle wit and intelligence that lends tremendous credibility to the role, and made me a believer in the priest turned amateur sleuth.",1361836800,3,1338,4.817391304347826

I agree with Mr. Howard that the acting is a bit 'stagey' and uneven, but the quirkiness grows on you.

2684587,4,B000K7UBUM,"If you are a lover of the Peter Wimsey, Tommy and Tuppence, and Brother Cadfael series you should enjoy Father Brown. Originally produced in the 1970s the episodes have held up over time. The books, written by G.K. Chesterton, were adapted for TV. It is the 1920s to1930s and the priest / detective solves crimes as he travels along the byways of England going about his spiritual duties. I gave Father Brown 4 stars instead of 5 because they are rather short. The episode I watched was about 50 minutes in length (although I didn't watch the time marker on my computer). They are about the length of the older David Suchet - Poirot episodes. I watched the first Father Brown episode (Series 1; Ep 1) online as a free reward for being an Amazon Prime member and thoroughly enjoyed it. I will purchase the entire series for my 85 year old dad to watch at his leisure. The period sets and costumes are decently recreated and the English countryside and old towns interestingly presented. The episode have more of a film look about them rather than an in-studio production.  I had very little trouble with the English accents, and although my dad and husband sometimes do have difficulty with English accents, I don't think they will with these episodes. As an avid fan of British TV and films since the 1970s (Upstairs Downstairs was my introduction), I enjoyed seeing many English actors in their earlier years, putting out good-to-excellent performances. Kenneth Moore plays Father Brown with understated aplomb. He is his own character - not a witty, urbane Wimsey or an eccentric, methodical Poirot. I think he is closer to Joan Hickson's interpretation of Ms. Marple (also from the 1970s). I would recommend the series and for Amazon Prime members, watching the online series makes perfect sense.",1353974400,21,1799,4.840909090909091
2684588,4,B000K7UBUM,"Father Brown is a kindly, mild-mannered little priest who seems completely harmless. Certainly he doesn't seem like a master detective.

But ""Father Brown - Set 1"" soon reminds us that appearances are deceptive, and not all wisdom and insight is of the Sherlock Holmes variety. The 1970s TV adaptation is rather slow-moving, but Kenneth More is brilliant as a kindly, eccentric detective who has an uncanny cleverness that nobody guesses.

Father Brown (More) comes to a town ruled over by a despicable aristocrat who womanizes, bullies and abuses the locals... until he's found with his head smashed in by a tiny hammer. There are countless people who could easily have done it, but some of the clues simply don't add up -- and only Father Brown can discover the truth.

Among his other cases: a wealthy man found stabbed to death, whose dog gives the only clue to his murderer's identity; an archaeologist is haunted by a madman and a curse. a sun-worshiping cult and a young woman's fall down an elevator shaft; a devoutly cheerful philanthropist falls headfirst from a window; a magistrate who struck a blow against Nazi Germany is found dead; and occult happenings in a remote country house draw Father Brown into a bizarre case.

This TV show is based on G.K. Chesterton's short stories, and for the most part it's a pretty faithful adaptation -- each has a crime that is either too simple or baffling, with plenty of red herrings and motives. Not only does Father Brown solve the crime, but he also provides some spiritual or moral insights, without being preachy.

The biggest problem with it is that every episode moves rather slowly, like a lot of older British mystery series. But the mysteries are rather clever in that they rely heavily on solutions that are much simpler than they appear, and are full of odd little clues that don't really seem like clues (such as bullets in the floor, or a half-written letter).

Of course, any detective show is made or broken by the lead actor, and Kenneth More is absolutely perfect as Father Brown. He comes across as warm, forgiving, kindly, and a little scatterbrained, but he has a keen insight into human nature and good/evil. He also has a bit of wry humor (""That's the problem with being a priest -- people expect you to believe anything"").

""Father Brown - Set 1"" is a solid collection of murder mysteries, which are slow-moving but full of human insight. And for those who have enjoyed Chesterton's short stories, they're a must-see.",1294272000,5,2494,4.799533799533799
2684589,1,B000K7UBUM,"Chesterton and especially the Father Brown stories are a great favorite of mine. However, this production is horrendous and makes the programs virtually unwatchable. I own both sets, which luckily I purchased used at great discount, and I have watched both sets of DVDs.

The acting is amateurish in the extreme, except for Kenneth More, and he's been better. Everybody else was a caricature. There were plenty of other BBC productions in the '60s and '70s that were excellent, so I don't understand why this one is so bad.

They used video tape for the interior scenes and film for the exterior and the change is very noticeable. The sound is poor, too. (I thought it was me, or my TV, but I see others have commented on the problem as well.)

This was painful to watch. It took me a couple of days and nothing else to watch to get through the first story. Such a disappointment.

I recommend reading the Father Brown stories. They're good. This doesn't do them justice.

One refreshing thing is Fr. Brown's common-sense explanation of the mystery, and his not being fooled by the baloney of the other characters to cover up the mystery. But OMG, read the books, don't buy these series.",1253836800,10,1083,4.422110552763819

Father Brown is not the best-made British series we have ever seen, by any means. Some of the acting is quite poor, and diction can sometimes be almost impossible to understand, what with words garbled, too clipped, and what not.

Furthermore, I'm delighted not to have paid the full $28 price, much less the $19 offer at used rates. No, we picked up our copy for $2 at a public library sale.

I'd recommend this series at a reasonable rate. But don't spring for it at full prices unless you're a true British mystery series fanatic.",1218585600,3,710,4.53125
2684596,4,B000K7UBUM,"This first set of ""Father Brown"" mysteries is generally entertaining and worth watching (if not buying).  I think Kenneth Moore plays the good father very well.  I don't think all the supporting actors are ""amateurs"" as one reviewer here claims ...but not everyone is up to the Moore's level of skill.

I also think that the complaints about production values aren't really fair.  I think people forget that these were produced on British TV in 1974!  I don't imagine any DVD collection of any other TV show from that era is going to look much better, and some probably would look much worse.

My main criticism of this collection is that a couple of the stories end rather abruptly ...to the point where you find yourself wondering, ""What happened?""  One in particular ends where you don't really know what is going to happen to the bad guy.

But there are a couple of gems ...particularly the first one ""the Hammer of"" something.

Bottom line: they aren't as good as the David Suchet Poirot's but they are worth watching.  Maybe they will do an updated series some time and the shows will benefit from today's production values.",1188777600,2,1130,4.719387755102041

2684598,1,B000K7UBUM,"Please be warned -- the quality of these videos are so excruciatingly bad, it makes them almost impossible to sit through.  A couple of the comments on here said exactly this but I bought it anyway, thinking ""How bad can it be?""

I was wrong.  They're terrible.  They're boring.  And I write as a huge Chesterton fan and an avid reader of all the Father Brown stories.  This is a pale imitation of the sparkling wit and vivid descriptions of those classic tales.  Now, Chesterton himself said ""Anything worth doing is worth doing badly,"" so if this stuff works for some people and it introduces them to the Apostle of Common Sense, that's great...but be assured, in this case  it has indeed been done badly.  Very badly.

I was puzzled by the great variance in comments on the Amazon site for this DVD -- such gushing reviews and only one or two dissenters.  Perhaps it's a generational thing?  I'm not sure.  But all I can say is that I suspect that most people who are used to the quality of current television shows, or who have a modicum of understanding and appreciation for the details and decisions that go into contemporary TV or film production will be dumbfounded by how truly bad this is.  The video and sound quality are worse than home movies.  The characterizations are overly exaggerated and the dialogue is often quite dull.  Also, the pacing, editing, camera angles and movement are incredibly amateurish.  It's like someone found a video camera on the street and was using it for the first time.

Don't make the same mistake I did. If you want good televised British mysteries, invest in the excellent Jeremy Brett series of Sherlock Holmes by Granada television.  If you want Chesterton, sit yourself down in an overstuffed Victorian armchair with a bit of brandy, a good cigar, and your favorite pair of spectacles, and settle down with the massive set of Complete Works put out by Ignatius Press.

2684600,5,B000K7UBUM,"The quality of the stories alone make this set worthwhile.  Far from being just another bunch of whodunits, each tale tells of some moral or theological problem. My favorite, ""The Eye of Apollo,"" is full of contrasts between idealist cults and orthodox Christianity. As you might expect from the title, G. K. Chesterton explores the Nietzschean substrate of the cult and their search for power.

8154957,5,B000K7UBUM,"Father Brown Set One, 1974 film

Gilbert Keith Chesterton wrote fifty-one short stories in the early twentieth century. Father Ignatius Brown is a parish priest and also an amateur detective whose observations and psychological insights are used to unravel mysteries. Chesterton was a master of paradox (truth standing on its head to attract attention) with his witty stories. He was inspired by a remark about priests, where auricular confessions can reveal many crimes to a parish priest who learns about the sins of people. Fr. Brown is a most unlikely detective compared to other detectives of fiction (Sherlock Holmes, Philip Marlowe, Hercule Poirot, etc.). These stories are taken from the five volumes of short stories.

Disk 1.
1) The Hammer of God. A Colonel is brutally murdered in a manner where there are no likely suspects. Fr. Brown solves the crime.
2) The Oracle of the Dog. After he decides to change his will a Colonel is killed. The family dog helps Fr. Brown to identify the murderer.
3) The Curse of the Golden Cross. When an archeologist is threatened, who did it? Fr. Brown uses his knowledge of medieval history to solve the mystery.
4) The Eye of Apollo. A woman suffers from following the leader of a pagan cult. Fr. Brown investigates.

Disk 2.
5) The Three Tools of Death. A philanthropist is murdered but not by any of the three weapons found nearby. There is a confession, but Fr. Brown decides if it is true.
6) The Mirror of the Magistrate. A man makes news by exposing German spies in London, then is found shot. Fr. Brown exonerates the prime suspect.
