8074802,5,B000A5N4IA,Leadbetter is on the short list of the world's greatest golf teachers and this DVD demonstrates why.  His explanations are superb.,1356307200,,130,5.190476190476191
8074803,3,B000A5N4IA,"too long, not to the point. kind of old dated including all the cloths. more computer graphic will help. Too much talking and not enough action. don't like his british accent neither. Leadbetter never demonstrated a swing. why we want to see some random people's less than perfect swing.",1188432000,,287,4.877551020408164
8074804,3,B000A5N4IA,"D. Leadbetter is a great golf teacher but one dvd just about swing is to slow and boring. Instead of this, do buy ""From beginner to winner"" (same author), it is more usefull and easy to watch.",1187827200,,192,4.216216216216216
8074805,5,B000A5N4IA,"I am a beginner in golf, and I found this DVD very helpful.  It covers a lot of the basics.",1185840000,,91,3.55
8074806,5,B000A5N4IA,"I have really enjoyed this DVD as well as the other two DVDs I own by David Leadbetter on golf instructions.  In the ""The Swing"" DVD David goes over the whole aspect of the swing from the irons on up through the woods too.  This video was particularly helpful in helping me to better understand how to do one particular part of the golf swing I am having ""a whole heap"" of problems with.  That part is weight shifting and just what needs to happen to do that.  In the DVD David is on a golf course and he not only explains this well but shows how to do it as well!  The DVD covers all aspects of how to swing a golf club.....the correct way silly,  as well as many other things beginning or budding golfers need to know to be able to swing a golf club. I find that sometimes I will have different people give me tips on my swing but most of the people really don't explain what they mean by what they say or show me how to achieve/do what they are telling me.  The Swing DVD explains and shows at the same time what those other people were trying to tell me.  I am heading for Maggie Valley N.C. next month for a week of golf and I am really looking forward to trying and applying what I learned in this video that applies to my problem area of the weight shift.  I am even going to take the DVD with me so I can review it in the evenings!  I have been ""trying"" to play golf since 2001.  I would highly recommend this DVD to all beginning golfers and even the intermediate ones.
  Well, I am back from Maggie Valley after a week of which I played golf 4 of the five days.  The first day, Monday, I hit really well with my driver off the tee.  Not only did I hit all day long with my driver but I used my driver the other 3 days as well because of the confidence I gained from the first day.  This was due mostly to the DVD, The Swing, by David Leadbetter.  I hit a lot of straight shots with very good distance on Monday.  I impressed my brother so much with how straight and the distance  I was getting that he changed his mind from him and his son-in-law would be able to beat my friend and I in a round of golf to they might NOT beat my friend and I come Friday!  I did not do as well on the other three days as I did on Monday, fresh lots of energy, but as you all most likely know, it takes time to work out the bad habits.  I STILL recommend the DVD!  I now have the confidence to use my driver on every hole except the par 3s of course! I use to use only my 3 wood inplace of my 1 wood! Oh, by the way, my friend and I DID beat my brother and his son-in-law on Friday!",1174435200,6,2575,3.9115384615384614
8074807,5,B000A5N4IA,"The DVD looks like a conversion from Leadbetter's VHS production made in 1990.  If you have read Leadbetter's ""The Golf Swing (1990),"" then this DVD (or VHS) will amplify the concepts from the text.  By using a student to illustrate his techniques, Leadbetter guides an intermediate player (15 handicap) through two lessons.

David Leadbetter's ideas on the golf swing are well illustrated here.  Through his clever lessons, one can see why he is one of the best teachers on the golf swing.",1129766400,17,490,4.939024390243903
