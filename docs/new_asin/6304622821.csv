The DVD itself is very lacking in features (as are most in this Jackie Chan Series), but the low cost and way cool kung fu  silliness make it hard to pass up.",912988800,3,258,4.0
910906,1,6304622821,"This looks like it could be a fun movie.  It has Jackie as a rich master  who tricks a warrior with magical powers into fighting his evil wife and  her 4 magical bodyguards.
Unfortunately the presentation totally ruins  the movie.  The opening credits are presented in the correct 2.35 aspect  ratio, but immediately afterwards, the picture reverts to a panned and  scanned image that ruins the fight scenes, which are the only reason to buy  the disc to begin with.
On top of that, unless you're a Chinese speaker,  you have to settle for an English dubbed version with no subtitles or  closed captioning.  Considering the capabilities DVD possess for including  multiple sets of subtitles and languages, this is most disappointing.  END",906249600,,738,4.950819672131147

7875706,4,6304622821,"Ok, you've read the other reviews, no sense rehearsing the story. If you haven't, there are a few very strong reviews below.
Here's my 2 cents on the Columbia Tri-Star DVD.

Region coded: 1 and 4

a) You MUST buy this movie if you want to have a complete Jacky Chan collection.

b) Picture Quality: 1.37:1 Full Screen (credits are in 2.35:1 Letterboxed on Full screen).
if: HD=5 / DVD (superbit)=4.5 / DVD=4 / Laserdisc = 3.50 / VHS = 2.75, then this picture quality:
ranges from 2.0 to max 3.50 out of possible 4 for a fine quality DVD
(If you're like me, you'd be tempted to give it a full bump down because it's pan and scanned...very, very noticeably...and annoying at times.)  (see pictures attached)

c) Audio Quality: receiver confirms: FORMAT: 2/0/0. [Dolby Digital 48kHz / 16bit 192kbps]
Strong hiss can be heard in scenes (noise floor too high), but never a distraction.
The Dialog is Mandarin / The dialog is dubbed from Cantonese (both the Mandarin and English track are dubs)
Neither track has Jackie Chan's voice.  Oh well.

I don't know where you could get a finer version for your collection!  Surely, no artist has all blockbuster projects, heavens look at the stuff Jackie is part of now - very different the his smash hits, and not blockbusters, but nevertheless, CHAN!

go for it collectors - you'll be glad you did",1358121600,,1335,4.646808510638298
7875707,3,6304622821,"Sometimes if an actor has not had a successful run as a lead then it behooves him or her to take a supporting role. After the box office failings of New Fist of Fury and Shaolin Wooden Men, Lo Wei decided to cast Jackie Chan as a villain in a secondary position to the lead of Jimmy Wang Yu (who starred in many popular pictures as a one-arm martial artist and many not-so-popular films as a two-arm martial artist.) Wang Yu's stardom was slowly fading at the time of this picture, but he had a much more recognizable name than Jackie's. Useless tidbit: according to Jackie, he made 12,000 HK dollars to Wang Yu's 50,000. The Killer Meteors was based on a Gu Long novel and it was the first of two films to be shot in Korea (To Kill with Intrigue was the second.)

Jimmy stars as Mi Wei the Killer Meteor, a sarcastic master of Kung Fu who know no equal. He is so feared and admired that criminals will cut off there fingers in repentance rather than to face his possible wrath and master martial artists serve underneath him. I like Wang Yu's performance with his cocky panache (he even keeps track of his enemies all 491 of them) and glib humor though his character is a bit too ""strong"" for there to be any real conflict in this film. Also, his weakness at martial arts is very noticeable because of the direction and his slowness (Master of the Flying Guillotine is a good example of where he is choreographed well.) But who needs adroitness of movement when you carry a cool weapon like the Killer Meteor. Only three people have seen this weapon and two of them are dead. Most of the time he uses it as a club on the criminals who are undeserving to die by it's true form.

Wei is approached by Qing, the famous Blue-Robed Swordsman who must bring him to the Celestial House of Hua the Hearty (Wa Wu Bin in some translations/dubbings) before July 15 (according to subtitles) or he will die. Mi is intrigued by this, for he is always looking for a challenge worthy of him, and goes with Qing. When he meets Hua (Jackie Chan) he finds a sick man who needs the Killer Meteor's help. Hua was poisoned by his wife in his Ginseng soup (otherwise a normally healthy soup) and she gives him a yearly dose of antidote. Hua does not like this arrangement and wants his wife dead and the antidote all for himself. Wei accepts this challenge though he learns of the four feared bodyguards of his wife: Blazing Star whose weapons are the Plum Blossom Needles (always a favorite of mine, though for weapons so small they always seem to be caught), Killer Hands with fierce suction grip (like GI Joe's Kung Fu grip with vacuum power), Black Lama whose good at black magic and Taoist Ghost (Lee Man Tai) who is good at tricks. Now these characters sound good, but there use in the film is less than desirable.

Unfortunately the plot is weak. There are too many twists and turns that negate previous plot points and characters who are not whom they seem to be. Or are they? My notes on this film is huge but explaining even half of them would be tedious. Generally if plots become overburdened then you can fall back on the martial arts in the film. With Jimmy being the lead character and unless he was being doubled for flips the martial arts are too slow and the action too pedantic. Also there is not a lot of fighting. There are two main fight scenes between Jackie and Jimmy. The first fight scene is the best while the finale is a bit disappointing. It takes place on wooden poles with stakes on the ground - resembling an action scene from Jimmy's earlier film Master of the Flying Guillotine and a bit like Yuen Woo Ping's Iron Monkey, though both are much more interesting. Luckily for the viewers Mi Wei shows off his killer weapon.

The Killer Meteors was a failure at the box office and did not help either Jimmy's or Jackie's career. Along with the confusing story and mediocre action scenes there are too many problems with this film ranging from the overuse of the ""lifted"" King Kong score to really cheap costumes. Yet, I cannot say I wholly disliked the film. I liked Jimmy's performance, Jackie's ""bad guy"" performance, some of the story, the beautiful scenery and the titular weapon. Since there is a plethora of better Jimmy Wang Yu and Jackie movies there is no reason to recommend this film unless you are into watching all of Jackie's or Wang Yu's films - like me.

DVD Notes: the two editions of this film I own are the Columbia version and the Simitar Platinum Series version. There is very little difference between the two. Both versions are full-screen (with the credits running letterboxed), both have Mandarin dialogue (though for some reason the Simitar version says Cantonese which is wrong), both have the same dubbed version and both have the same running time (104m). The Columbia version does have English subtitles though.",1173398400,3,4849,4.518223234624146
7875708,1,6304622821,"I never would have believed it,,,but his flick turned out to be my worst kung fu experience,,,,it was painful and embarrassing to watch.  A real waste of talents.  The fights were average,,,but the story was nothing less than garbage.  I feel really bad for Jackie Chan and Wang Yu.  I would not recommend this rubish to my worst enemy!!",1155081600,,337,4.661016949152542
7875709,1,6304622821,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap ""American version"" then~! LOL",1139097600,,924,4.8544303797468356
7875710,5,6304622821,This is a good Kung Fu flick. I enjoyed it. Great fights and the Killer Meteors are awesome. Jackie Chan plays the bad guy which I like because I'm use to seeing him as the good guy. I don't regret buying this movie at all.,1123113600,3,223,3.977777777777778
7875711,5,6304622821,"Quite simply, this is not a Jacky Chan movie.  Don't buy this expecting to see Drunken Master style farce.  Jacky is evil.  Really evil.  In fact, he's a total loser.  Hence the scores of negative reviews from people unwilling to watch any old Hong Kong flicks that do not involve Jacky's whacky acrobatics.  The star of this movie is JIMMY WANG YU.  Wang Yu is more of a Clint Eastwood type.  He rips one liners and literally wrecks people.  There are no fart jokes and no peeing,  just well paced action and likeable heroes.  For the price, it's a capable transfer of an aged movie.",1004918400,5,584,4.466666666666667
7875712,2,6304622821,"""The Killer Meteors"" provides further evidence that producer/director/hack Lo Wei had no clue as to Jackie's real potential.  Lo Wei built several ""Bruce-Lee-alikes"" around Chan in the early  '70s.  Despite the fact that the ""chop-socky"" had ran its course,  Lo Wei blamed the lackluster commercial performance of these movies on  Chan.  One result of this problem was ""The Killer Meteors,"" an  early Chan film, featuring him as the villain!  Chan delivers a spectacular  performance, as always.  Unfortunately, he only appears in the last third  of the movie.  Also, Chan as a villain becomes somewhat difficult to  swallow, considering his lovable, down-to-earth personality depicted in the  vast majority of his films.  Overall, one of Lo Wei's better films, but it  suffers from too little Chan.",926294400,4,799,5.32258064516129
