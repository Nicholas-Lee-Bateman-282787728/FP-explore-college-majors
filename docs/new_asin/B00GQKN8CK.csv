8626234,5,B00GQKN8CK,"Had rented the first movie from Blockbuster years, absolutely LOVED the crap out of it. Probably me and my brother's most favorite movie we had seen. Could never find it in stores, even in ones that carry foreign films. Forgot about it for a while. Long story short, remembered what I loved about this when I saw the second one on Netflix. Watched. Needed both on DVD. Amazon is your friend.

Attack the Gas Station! - Over the top, hilarious, ridiculous, AWESOME movie! It's just so frigging good! I had never seen the dubbed the version, so I was a little worried the dubbing would be lousy when I watched it with my fiancee and her sister, but we were all pleasantly surprised the dubbing is actually pretty good!

Attack the Gas Station! 2 - Absolutely unrelated to the first, outside being the same gas station. Made 10 years after the first, so they set it 10 years after the first movie. New hooligans, same gas station owner. The first time around, that kind of killed it for me a little bit. And I was disappointed that the original hooligans didn't even make a cameo. Don't let any of that ruin it for you! This movie is just as entertaining as the first, and keeps you in that ridiculous Korean action comedy world you came to love from the first movie!

Love that I can have both movies together on one DVD! Only the first offers both subbed and dubbed versions. The overall quality of the DVD is slightly questionable, but it works perfectly on my PS3, zero issues, and looks just fine when watching it.",1387152000,,1516,4.4855072463768115
