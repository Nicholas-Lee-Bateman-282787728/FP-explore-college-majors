8635906,5,B00HUE6CC4,"I'm reviewing this for the English subtitled version. Ok first off it's region free and has subtitles in Portuguese, English, Spanish, and French. This is the best print and transfer of the film in existence. If you enjoy coffin joe films than get this acid trip of a film. This film probably only makes sense if you used LSD its full of feverish scenes that make little sense at all. The whole film seems to focus on the abstract outer cosmos. Ok, what? Yep it's out there- If that sounds like something you would like than get this now it's great; I know I love this film it is different and really entertaining.",1492214400,,614,4.442477876106195
