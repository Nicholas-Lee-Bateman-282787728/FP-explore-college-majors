The shipment was very quick and there were absolutely no problems during my purchase or afterwards.",1295827200,,248,5.073170731707317
2772487,5,B000NO23YE,This is my personal favorite season. The attention and description given to the Pissjugs that litter the park through out this season are hysterical. As usual Mr. Leahey steels the show with his drunken stupor. The stand off at the end of the season bring this season to a climatic peek of the series. Go Ricky!!!,1279929600,,313,4.607142857142857
2772488,5,B000NO23YE,"Nothing more needed to say, its the Trailer Park Boys!
If you like silly humor, and you don't mind a lot of fowl language, then this is your thing.
I love the Trailer Park Boys! Go Bubbles!",1277424000,,189,4.135135135135135
2772489,5,B000NO23YE,"A great comedy series,It's like ""Cheech and Chong"" of my generation,Over all the funniest and most entertaining show I have seen in years.",1265414400,,138,5.043478260869565
2772490,5,B000NO23YE,"Trailer park boys does not cease to entertain its audiences, and this season is no different. In this season we are taken back to what happened to make Jim Lehigh become a drunk trailer park supervisor. The audience will find itself on the wrong side of the fence as they cheer Mr. Lehigh on getting sober and getting reinstated into the police academy..",1234483200,,354,4.634920634920635
2772491,2,B000NO23YE,"Strangely overpriced - As of this posting it is more than double the price that Amazon.ca is charging Canadians: $19.99 CDN (and, as of this posting, CDN and USD are at parity). Considering just how unlikely it is that these products are, in any way, different, this seems more than a little absurd. Also note that Canada and the US share a DVD region code, making imports from Canada playable on any American DVD player.",1220572800,5,421,4.626666666666667
2772492,5,B000NO23YE,"Randy and his bulbous gut busts through in Season #6.

Shirtless and wearing his skin-tight white pants, Randy breaks from Mr. Lahey and takes conrol as the new trailer park supervisor.

""Halloween 1977"" is the highlight of the season. Bubbles as a child, wearing a Star Wars costume. That's worth the cost of the entire DVD set.

The Trailer Park Boys is for you if any of the following comedies have made you laugh:

It does take a particular type of sense of humor to appreciate them, but if you have that type of funny bone these guys will have you laughing for hours and you'll find yourself watching them repeatedly. I own every episode and every movie they've done for exactly that reason, they're awesome dumb humor for those times you just want a dumb laugh with characters you'll get attached too. 5 Stars, two thumbs up!",1342915200,,525,4.655913978494624
