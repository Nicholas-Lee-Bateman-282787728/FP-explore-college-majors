8376423,1,B002OVB9XA,"Upon watching this movie, I found no redeeming value.  The movie was aimless and the title misleading.  All I can say is ""God, help these actors.""",1329264000,3,146,4.576923076923077

8376425,2,B002OVB9XA,"This film was completely off target. You are supposed to feel bad for the wrongfully convicted character, but he is too scruffy to take serious. The supposed underage victim, shes in real life a train wreck and wouldnt pass for an 18 year old. This chick looks like she is pushing 40 and in no way possible, should ever try to portray a teenage girl! Bad casting, very bad acting, very few costume changes, 10 cent wardrobe. My suggestion to you.....stay far away from this bomb",1301529600,5,478,4.569767441860465
8376426,1,B002OVB9XA,"about as exiting as watching grass grow. even more tedious than bronw bunny, and that takes some beating.",1281312000,4,105,4.888888888888889
8376427,5,B002OVB9XA,"Definitely Raw and not kid friendly. To not have any speaking for the first part of the movie, the Actors did a great job at getting the point across. This is the real world, and many people do not want to know the truth, but it happens. This also shows that there is still a chance for true love, regardless of the obstacles. I recommed this, because this is something we can learn from.",1262304000,18,388,4.256756756756757
8376428,5,B002OVB9XA,"there are no other films like this one. that could be good, or it could be bad, depending on how you look at it but you can not deny its originality.

a heavy use of visuals and music with little dialogue show a world which doesn't need words to make its point or show the pain of its characters but not something everybody can appreciate, but if you are, give it a shot, the soundtrack, the visuals, the emotion and kai lanette's performance are worth it even if it's not your taste",1262131200,12,483,4.25
8376429,1,B002OVB9XA,"STUPID, NO TALKING. This was a bad movie. The description of this movie makes it out a great movie. They don't tell you that all it is, is a girl walking around everywhere getting raped and beat up but no sound. There is no talking, well at least the first 20 minutes of it. That was all we could stand of watching it hoping it would get better but never did. Waste of money!!!",1262044800,10,377,4.108108108108108
