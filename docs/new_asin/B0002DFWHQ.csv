2079875,5,B0002DFWHQ,"Hands down, this is the best AT film out.  I own 5 other AT videos (which are all good because they are all on the AT), but TREK gets watched by far the most.  Love the scenery, music and ongoing insights as the 4 horsemen push ever north to Katahdin.  This is not a ""how to"" video (like Lynn Whelden's are), but for giving you ""that feeling"" like you are out there on the trail, this video is the one.",1111968000,4,402,4.0
2079876,5,B0002DFWHQ,"I've been wanting to see Trek for a while now, but had some trepidation since my own movie, 2000 Miles to Maine is also a documentary about the Appalachian Trail. I finally watched it this past week and I really enjoyed this movie. The four Horsemen may seem like typical twenty somethings just out to prove something, but quickly we come to appreciate their camaraderie, humor, and introspective development. These guys really do change physically and emotionally through the course of their journey. As someone pointed out in an AT forum, much of 2000 Miles to Maine is like meeting many people and chewing the fat at a shelter while Trek focuses on four guys as they struggle from state to state. I think it is too bad that some have used these reviews to slam others efforts as both movies are truly heartfelt examinations of the trail. Trek is a excellent documentary and a great purchase for any fan of the Appalachian Trail.",1111363200,18,931,4.682926829268292
2079877,5,B0002DFWHQ,"Even if you are NOT a hiker, this video was a blast to watch! I hadn't been hiking before, and after watching this video I went online and subscribed to all of the AT sites I could to glean more information. I've been out on several week long section hikes, and made it a point to try to visit some of the places in this video - that was the really cool part - I actually could SEE the places that were in the video, and it brought me thoughts about what these guys must have went through to not only HIKE this whole trail - but how they managed to carry the equipment to shoot it! I'm heading out for a month long section hike this summer, no way I would've ever considered it if I hadn't seen these guys in action! I've since watched some of the other titles out there, and was kinda surprised that it looked like just a bunch of partying losers who hiked.....most of the characters I've met up with so far who are thru hikers are some of the best people around - wish I couldv'e hiked with the Four Horsemen....maybe someday if they ever go again, I want to be along for the ride! Maybe I can get  my gnarly mug in TREK II, wouldn't THAT be awesome!",1109635200,2,1152,4.097345132743363
2079878,5,B0002DFWHQ,"What a great video! I have such a craving for videos on the AT, I've gotten my hands on every other availabe title I could find  -  but the quality of TREK put every other attempt at a documentary to shame...... and if you are even considering hiking the trail - you want to check out this DVD. The guys that created it were tons of fun to watch, and really gave a feel for what it's like to be out there hiking...it's definately not all fun and games! I was disappointed to see that another reviewer used their review to cheaply advertise someone else's DVD - cheap shot - TREK by far was the most realistic, day to day story reflecting what it is actually like out there. The camera angles kept my interest, and by the time the movie was done, I felt like I knew these hikers personally. A well developed story took place, and I couldn't wait to see what happened next! Super photography highlighted the adventure, and some very interesting ""challenges"" spiced it up quite a bit! One disappointment was that it was not long enough, I really wanted to see more when it was finished. As a hiker, there are many rough days, and lots of complaining happens - it comes with the territory of hiking a trail over 2,000 miles long, through whatever weather comes your way, this documentary help me to realize that planning a hike this long takes time and perserverance, and is truly rewarding in the end. TREK inspired me to do a long hike last year, and I'm considering a Thru hike in 2006.......I would not even have comtemplated the possiblity if I hadn't seen this first. Thanks to you guys for taking the time to create this! Happy Trails.",1109635200,2,1638,4.438538205980066
2079879,1,B0002DFWHQ,"I just finished a Thru-hike of the AT in October. And was excited to see this DVD for nestalgia. And I was very disapointed with it. This movie captures a very small percent of people that are on the trail. During the video they are constantly bragging about how many miles they hike day to day, and are constantly complaining about the trail. Its almost as if they have something to prove. and this video is an ego boost. I HIGHLY reccomend the other A.T. Documentary called ""2000 Miles To Maine."" it captures trail life and different people and represents the trail in a much more positive aspect. If you are seriously interested in hiking the trail or getting information, or just curious about trail life, save your time and money, don't buy this video. If you want to haul down the trail and brag to all your friends that you walked 2000 miles, then this may be the video for you.",1106524800,11,885,4.469135802469136
2079880,5,B0002DFWHQ,"A friend recently gave me the TREK DVD as a present.  I've watched it three times already and I'm pumped.

I thought it might be just scenery shots of the Appalachian Trail - like some stuff I've seen on the Travel Channel - but it has all kinds of interviews with hikers, and it follows a group of guys as they take a shot at a thru-hike.  There is some great scenery of places I've always wanted to see on the trail, and it has some great stories too.  Watch this (its about 90 minutes) and pack your backpack.

If you don't want to hit the trail after watching this, then you're half dead already.",1101427200,4,600,4.182608695652174
2079881,4,B0002DFWHQ,"The guys did a really nice job on this and I appreciated the fact that it was longer than most AT DVD's that I've seen.  The one thing that I was really disappointed about was that they never even mentioned the (in)famous Maine ""100 Mile Wilderness"", which I thought was a pretty big oversight. I got the feeling that they were trying to wrap it up and abbreviated the NE part of the trail after having addressed the southern part of the trail in greater detail.  They also spend a bit too much time on personal reflections....all very relevant aspects of hiking but got too into themselves at times.  Would rather that some of that time be used to deal with the Whites and Maine. :)  Still, all in all, one of the better AT documentaries and had good photography.",1362182400,2,764,4.435714285714286
2079882,5,B0002DFWHQ,"Of the different films available about the AT I found this to be the best.
- The guys who filmed it knew how to setup a scene and how to hold a camera. It has beautiful nature in it and it is able to capture the mood of the moment.
-It has a plot! It follows 4 friends on their hike. One of them leaves, later comes back, they meet people along the way, etc.
- As opposed to another similar documentary, this is professionally edited.
- I found the insights it provides in the interviews about motivation and other general issues entertaining and enlightening.",1361232000,2,560,4.3428571428571425
2079883,5,B0002DFWHQ,"Without going into a long list of reasons I like this movie, I will simply say that it was an amazing new view of the Appalachian Trail for me after only watching the NatGeo documentary, and it is so real that it is to-date one of the few Appalachian Trail publications that I remember exactly how it was to watch it for the first time and still have no trouble sitting through it over again. To put it in perspective, in the first few sounds of the movie, if I turn up the volume, my kids will hear it from the bedroom and come running out to sit and watch the, ""Bail to the Trail,"" movie and they know it by name. They will also sit through the entire thing and they are only 4 and 7. Get this. Watch it. Watch it again. Repeat.",1360540800,,730,4.041379310344827
2079884,5,B0002DFWHQ,"Bought this for my husband and he loved it!  He enjoys all kinds of books, especially about this kind of topic.  He has alot of books on the same topics written by different authors and has enjoyed them all.",1354838400,,207,4.282051282051282
2079885,5,B0002DFWHQ,This was a very well done documentary on hiking the AT. I'm an armchair hiker so I really appreciate these four guys doing all the hard work and allowing me a peek into their adventure.,1353024000,,185,4.314285714285714
2079886,3,B0002DFWHQ,"The documentary starts out a little slow but once you get used to the style I found it worth watching.  It follows the journey of four young hikers through a variety of emotional and physical terrain as they make their way from Georgia to Maine.  I have read a few books about AT thru hikes but this was my first video.  I can say that after you watch this video you will have a much better feel for what it really takes to hike the trail from an emotional and physiological perspective.  There is very little attention paid to any of the mechanics of hiking the AT including gear, route planning and re-supply.  The video is very informal in nature so expect it to have a little of that home movie feel.",1352764800,,704,4.303030303030303
2079887,4,B0002DFWHQ,"This is definitely not your normal Appalachian Trail video. I bought this video because I am always on a search for more information regarding hiking, backpacking, and especially regarding the Appalachian Trail. Most videos out there area bout the views and the trail itself, but this video was a excellent view from a group of people hiking the trail. It talks about their thoughts, emotions and reactions to trail life and how they deal with certain aspects of the trail. The video is a great source of information not about the trail but about what it takes inside a person to walk for 5-6 months along the AT. There are plenty of other videos and websites devoted to the scenery and nature of the trail but I am very glad to find a video about the experience.",1320883200,,763,4.576642335766423
2079888,5,B0002DFWHQ,This is a very well done insightful dvd on the Appalachian trail thru hike. I would recommend to anyone who is thinking of hiking the trail or is just interested in learning more about the trail.,1319760000,,195,4.444444444444445
2079889,5,B0002DFWHQ,"If you are considering purchasing this DVD then you probably should.  Unlike the other A.T. documentaries I've seen, this one was filmed by the hikers while they hiked.  That alone puts it miles ahead of the other offerings, but when you add an engaging narrative, a likeable crew of hikers and a surprisingly high production value have a real winner.

2079890,4,B0002DFWHQ,"This homemade documentary was a pleasant view into the world of the thru-hiker on the Appalachian Trail. To be honest, I expected it to be more informational, with tips, helpful hints, gear recommendations, details of trail life... but it turned out to be more just a homemade video. A lot of interviews, a lot of quirky, personal moments, a lot of scenes of the four of them just hiking along. It was good; I really enjoyed it; it gave a very realistic, personal view of life on the trail. I definitely recommend.",1302652800,,514,4.5978260869565215
2079891,5,B0002DFWHQ,"I purchased this video for my son, who is planning to hike the AT this summer. It works on so many levels.  If you're planning to do the hike yourself, it presents an overlook of the trail, tips on what to pack, and insight into what it takes (physically and emotionally) to go the distance.  If you want to understand why someone you know would want to do this crazy thing, this movie will help you not only understand that call but will help you worry less about them while they're gone.  They'll meet some pretty cool people along the way.  If you just want to watch some interesting scenarios and get to know some fascinating characters, it works on that level too.",1298592000,,669,4.414634146341464

2079893,4,B0002DFWHQ,"I've only seen a few Appalachian Trail documentaries, but this one is my favorite. Some of the others I had watched before this one skipped entire states, and didn't show much of the scenery, but Trek follows the same group of guys through every state along the AT. If you are looking to hike the Appalachian Trail or just want to reminisce about the time you spent out there, then this is the DVD for you.",1244073600,,406,4.355263157894737
2079894,5,B0002DFWHQ,"Wow, I really enjoyed being along for the experience. That is what made this a 5 star movie for me. I enjoyed seeing what it was like for them to learn and adapt along the way. Every thru hike of the AT will throw something different at you, and the people just a week or two ahead of you, or behind you. This showed the tough days and the beautiful days. The highs and some of the lows of 5 months on the AT, without dwelling on the tough days, the whining or the outright ""What the heck am I doing out here"" times, that 5 months away from family and your ""other life"" can put you through.

A great view into their Journey and accomplishment. I recommend this and the other AT documentaries to get the full view. This is a keeper.",1235088000,,731,4.111888111888112
2079895,4,B0002DFWHQ,"TREK tells the story of 4 young men and their 2001 thru hike of the AT.  TREK delves into the characters, those fellow hikers they meet along the trail, a few choice days in detail, and how their few encounters ""back in the world"" seem different from the perspective of a hiker.  Decent production quality, considering the film was made on-trail and without support.  It's a keeper in my trail library.",1226361600,,402,4.633802816901408
2079896,4,B0002DFWHQ,"A lot of reviews of this DVD seem a bit harsh.  Sure, the film-makers are young, shirtless dudes enjoying their hike with their buds.  But what's wrong with that?  Many AT hikers hike with friends, or at least begin the journey that way, and many AT hikers are just out of college.  That actually made the DVD fun.  Sure you see them having a beer, joking about showers and laundry, even using language such as ""It was balls hot today!""  That's reality, though.  Granted, some of the hikers in this video are more interesting than others, but a couple of them are very likable.  No, this DVD does not provide a lot of information about the trail useful to those who know nothing about the AT; however, how many people planning to watch this DVD don't already know the basic facts about the AT?  No, it's not the one I'd give to someone as their introduction to the Trail, but it's a well-done documentary that highlights a lot of the ""small moments"" encountered during an AT hike.  I enjoyed it.",1213660800,,995,4.477777777777778
2079897,1,B0002DFWHQ,"i definitely do not recommend this movie! it was the first of all my A.T. movies that i purchased, and by far, THE WORST! i agree with the one person at the bottom of this page that gave it a 2 or 3 star. the movie did seem like it was about four 21 year old bar buddies, romping through the woods. well, actually, about three bar buddies,  b/c one of them, somehow, got ran over by a car off-screen; therefore, ending his AT thru-hike. i completed the A.T. in '04 and my experience was close to what you see in this movie, but God, the film could've been a lot better with a lot more scenery and a lot less cheesiness! the interviews are pretty well done, but i just got tired of seeing these guys filming each other most of the film. in a lot of these clips, they're doing silly and stupid things for the camera, which took away from the film. if you're looking for a good A.T. film to buy, i would recommend Appalachian Impressions or Walking With Freedom. Both are far better than this one.",1177027200,21,994,4.204188481675392
2079898,5,B0002DFWHQ,"This is the real deal folks. It may not be a finely acted production using professional actors, but that is what makes it a beautiful film. I was struck hard by the way the thru-hikers were shown in their raw form. You want to know what it is like hiking the Trail? Watch this flick. When I was watching this movie, I felt like my old friend's bird dog. It was too old to hunt anymore, but whenever it turned duck season, it would get anxious for the hunt. That is how I felt. It makes me want to drop everything and go hike the AT!

2079901,2,B0002DFWHQ,"Would appeal to out of work 20 somethings who find hooting out loud a significant expression of inner experience. Could have been subtitled ""Hiking with your bar buddies, are we thirty ,yet?.""

2079902,4,B0002DFWHQ,"Someday I will do an AT thru hike and bought this DVD primarily because of the rave reviews here. It was an enjoyable viewing experience but not quite what I had anticipated.

Don't expect a lot of scenes from the actual AT itself or much scenary. The focus of the movie is on the four young guys making the thru hike. They are interviewed extensively throughout the experience and they comment on food, terrain, trail towns, fatique, thirst and other aspects of the thru hike. All of them were pleasant and reasonably interesting, but I found myself aching to see more of the trail itself. There are tantalizingly brief glimpses of the Balds, the Whites and the rocky sections in Pennsylvania. I would have liked to have seen more of the scenery.

Another small criticism is that there are segments utterly extraneous from the trail. Two examples are a video chapter on drinking a gallon of milk in a short period time and then the boys going off to Manhatten. Most people might enjoy these snippets, but again, I'd rather see and vicariously experience the AT itself.

The last segment when they celebrate on Katahdin was interesting and emotional, as well their musings of having to return to the real world and the dreaded ""work environment."" Ouch!

I recommend this for people who have done the AT or who plan on doing it. The film is well-made, compact and entertaining.",1161993600,28,1376,4.720833333333333
2079903,5,B0002DFWHQ,"Watched this video with my 12 and 14 year old son and daughter who I homeschool as part of our school day and they were riveted to the screen!  Being from the coast of the Carolinas, they especially liked the part where they were in NC, but from the scenery to the heartfelt dialogue to the humor, this is a film everyone should watch.  It makes you realize there is so much out there we forget to notice and experience every day.  The 911 segment is especially interesting, most certainly the part about how the world should get along more like it does on the trail.  How true!  An amazing, inspiring video!  Get it, put it in your video library and watch it over and over.  Thanks guys for doing this one and can't wait to watch more of your work!!",1143676800,4,750,4.276595744680851

The development of the guys and gals featured throughout the movie (and -- yes -- the antics) made the story personal and almost like you were there getting to know everyone. Having done a few AT section hikes, I can identify with a good portion of what the guys go through.

When first watching Trek I though I could get past all the testosterone thinking humility would follow. I never got the feeling that these ""boys"" respected or appreciated this trail.  Too many times I felt like I was watching a frat party developing. That's a shame because I feel these guys are educated and articulate...but it was lost in too often juvenile dialog.

It was in Duncannon, PA, and around a very cool group of people.  I could see the train from my hotel room, and that was sweet!

Anyway, this is an inspirational documentary that will likely touch your heart a little bit.  Really well made.  Get out there and hike!

I'd really buy this movie.  Sometimes specialty flicks like this are hard for me to justify too, as it seems like spending $20 plus is a bit much, but I think this movie is well worth it.  I also hiked the whole AT, so I do have some bias, but everyone I've shown the movie to really loved it too!",1415923200,,723,4.218978102189781
