8297491,5,B001EBMBCE,"SATANIS: THE DEVIL'S MASS is a documentary about the San Francisco Church of Satan from 1969-70. I went into it w/ no expectations, and found it informative, humorous, and quite entertaining. High Priest, Anton ""Tony"" LeVay was an interesting guy. His philosophy is that man, unfettered by fear, should just live naturally for himself. LeVay admits proudly that true Satanism is a ""selfish"" religion, loaded w/ hedonism and self-indulgence. It is also honest, in that it doesn't cover up what it's all about. LeVay views other religions, especially Christianity, as hypocritical, guilt-driven, and devoid of any real enjoyment. Interviews w/ LeVay, his fellow Satanists, as well as their detractors make for intriguing discussions. If nothing else, this film helps to dispel the Hollywood, ""murdering cultist"" portrayal of Satanism. While the actual mass is full of pomp and circumstance, the costumes are only symbolic. It's not as though LeVay runs down the street w/ his devil horns on! Is there sadism? Yes. Masochism? Sure. Sex in a coffin? Of course. Remember, these people aren't Quakers! Watch and judge for yourself...",1407542400,,1127,5.301675977653631
