8400574,2,B003N2JKPI,"DVDs of Cigarette Commercials are today a hoot of laughable bad taste, campy politically incorrect fun, and just plain kitsch. Ironically, the cigarette television commericals (banned since 1971) may have had the worst product, but most entertaining commercials of their time!

But there's a modicum of that in this DVD. A few here are real shockers from Camel, Chesterfield, and Philip Morris where smokers and fake doctors tout the health benefits of their cigarettes. Track legend Jesse Owens is shown promoting Chesterfields as ""Our (black people's) cigarette."" Some obscure and forgotten brands (Robert Morris, Raleigh, Lark, etc.) are mixed in with the better known brands. However, those old enough to remember will not be terribly fond of this collection as most of the entertaining classics of the genre are unexcusably missing. Here, I'm referring to the Flintstones' Winston Commericals, the Marlboro man with the theme from the Magnificent Seven, Virginia Slims' ""You've Come a Long Way baby,"" Viceroy's catchy ""all of the taste all of the time"" jingle, walking a mile for a Camel, Dick Van Dyke's Kent commercials, and only one of the I Love Lucy cartoon ads for Philip Morris is included here. There are better collections of this kind out there, such as the Cigarette section of the 1001 Classic commercials and Something Weird Video's DVD of Cigarette Commercial collection. Go for those, but beginners born after 1971 who have never seen such commericals may find this interesting as a curio, but should be aware that superior DVD collections of this are available.",1288051200,10,1582,5.1796875
