915804,1,630470562X,"This Movie is typical of bad strait to video horror flicks.  A college student, Andy, transfers to a new school, the ""cool"" kids don't like him, his girlfriend doesn't seem to either, and the result is that he falls in with the wrong crowd.  And boy is it the wrong crowd.  A bunch of bad actors playing a voodoo cult posing as a fraternity.  Eventually Andy catches on that there is something unusual with this group of guys, but not before they make him do a seemingly endless string of bizarre antics.
The interesting, or perhaps the intriguing, event of this film is not any one scene in the movie, but the star, Corey Feldman.  Feldman, at least to me, is kind of a cult icon.  He had roles in some of the great coming of age/teen idol films of the 80's.  As far as I can tell this was the last film he was in.  Which I think is just too bad.  I would love to see Corey get back in the movies, and back in roles where he can shine.  I guess it probably won't happen, but hey, he is above this film.",987984000,,1003,4.097435897435897

7876266,3,630470562X,"This is one of Coreys earlier attempts after the Coreys went their way, Has some comedy. This is a hard to find movie with a younger Corey in a staring role. If you follow Corey you will notice that he seems to get a horror movie that is about half comedy. I have followed Corey since his early days in Gremlins and Stand By Me. If you collect his movies this is a great addition to your collection.",1428451200,,399,4.128205128205129

7876269,4,630470562X,"I remember watching this movie shortly after it's direct-to-video release back in 1996. If you're a suburban high school male, like I was in the ancient 1990's,'Voodoo' will be a fun & entertaining excursion into the world of voodoo cults on campus! While this film won't change your life, it will be far more enjoyable than the endless remakes that currently flood the genre.",1380240000,,376,4.890625

7876272,5,630470562X,"This movie takes on a slight ""Tales From the Crypt"" appeal. But as a whole it tells a good tale that gives you a bit of a chill. Not to mention, makes you think twice about joining a Frat!",1347840000,,188,3.8461538461538463
7876273,5,630470562X,"This is by far and away,Corey's greatest cinematic achievement to date. We must dismiss all of Corey's past works,because he was a mere child with overbearing parents with addictions. Corey was extremely convincing as a 27 year old college freshman trying to fit in with a covertly demonic fraternity......O.K.....I admit it,it was lame. But,I was an extra in the movie,so watch it and hope you all enjoy my performance.",996796800,,420,5.101449275362318
7876274,4,630470562X,"If you are fond of vintage Air Force film footage of the F-101 this is the video for you! Broken up into four segments of original 1950's and 60's air force film footage, this video shows you intial development, in the cockpit start-up procedures, speed record operations Sunrun and Firewall, and lastly a really cool defense pitch of its weapons and peace-keeping potential.
I thoroughly enjoyed this video because of its vintage quality and propaganda style narration. By that I mean, the film footage was probably compiled from the original 1950's Air Force movies shown to instruct pilots on how to fly the Voodoo. For example during the 2nd segment on ""starting up the engines"" the video goes step by step through the procedures for all the instrument panels. Doesn't get much better than that if you are a aviation buff!! The following segments are similar in their narration, but are less ""how-to"" and contain great information about specific operations and flight characteristics.
Here's the final scoop. If you a die hard for the days of the century series fighters ( in this case solely the Voodoo ), and appreciate the art of rough and high contrast sepia style aviation filming of the 1950's, you will own a video that will be a permanent collection in your aviation library. You'll also know how to start up the engines on the Voodoo!! : )
If you are looking for a crystal clear, ultra restored, surround sound quality film with pilot interviews and detailed jet walk-arounds, start clicking your heels and grab Todo cause this isn't your neighborhood.",991180800,,1565,4.887218045112782
