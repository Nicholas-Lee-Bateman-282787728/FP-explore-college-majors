This was a great season.  Can't even imagine why Pru left.  You can see that she has found her stride with her charachter.  She even directs the last episode.",1126137600,,328,4.0625
2395370,5,B000AXWHK8,"Coming from a long time fan, season three is one of the best seasons ever. So much happens in this season, both on and off camera. Fan favorite Julian McMahon joins the Charmed cast in this season, and becomes part of one of the most long-running storylines for the series: the love affair between Phoebe and Cole. Initially a demon sent to destroy the Charmed Ones, he eventually goes rogue after falling in love with Phoebe. Off camera, something similar happened. Actor Julian McMahon began dating actress Shannen Doherty.

Speaking of Shannen, this is her final season with the Charmed show. After some creative differences with producers and cast, Shannen left the series but not before going behind the camera to direct it's season finale episode. Also to leave the series in season three is the show's creator Constance M. Burge. Fellow executive producer Brad Kern wanted to bring in a season long relationship storyline for the Phoebe character after seeing fan's reaction to season two's Piper/Leo/Dan storyline. Burge was against it as she wanted the series to go back to it's original concept of sisterly ties and exploring the character's wiccan heritage. Eventually she lost out and left the series around the time season three began taping.

This season contains the following episodes:

1) The Honeymoon's Over, 2) Magic Hour, 3) Once Upon A Time, 4) All Halliwell's Eve, 5) Sight Unseen, 6) Primrose Empath, 7) Power Outage, 8) Sleuthing With The Enemy, 9) Coyote Piper, 10) We All Scream For Ice Cream, 11) Blinded By The Whitelighter, 12) Wrestling With Demons, 13) Bride and Gloom, 14) The Good, The Bad and The Cursed, 15) Just Harried, 16) Death Takes A Halliwell, 17) Pre-Witched, 18) Sin Francisco, 19) The Demon Who Came In From The Cold, 20) Exit Strategy, 21) Look Who's Barking, and 22) All Hell Breaks Loose.

My only complaint is that, as with the previous Charmed DVD releases, Paramount Studios remains to tread the ""cheap"" route by not offering any bonus material what-so-ever. The obvious choice would have been to release the unaired pilot on the first DVD set, which had a completely different actress play the role of Phoebe but alas none here either. If you can overlook this gross negligence, then I strongly encourage you to add this season to your collection.",1125360000,225,2300,4.920103092783505
2395371,5,B000AXWHK8,"The third season of Charmed began in 2000, with the disappearance of Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Leo (Brian Krause), whom have orbed away 'up there' three months ago in the season two finale. Prue (Shannen Doherty) and Phoebe (Alyssa Milano) are left to fight the demons that attack, and eventually Piper and Leo return.

The third season is a struggle for most of our characters: Piper and Leo try to find a way to still be together, to convince the Elders they can be together and not be distracted when it comes to their duties. Phoebe meets and falls in love with a half-demon, Belthazor, aka Cole Turner (Julian McMahon). At first Cole/Belthazor is to kill the Charmed Ones, but his human half takes over as he and Phoebe fall in love. And lastly, Prue struggles with inner turmoil over various situations, such as finding a perfect relationship, dealing with death, dealing with her responsibilities as an adult and a witch, and of course, with the demonic issues.

The third season is very different from the first two seasons of Charmed, by having more of a seasonal arch, as opposed to monster-of-the-week episodes, which is very common in supernatural shows' earlier days. This season, the sisters are faced with the problems from the Triad (a group of evil beings), Belthazor (Cole Turner, the man/demon Phoebe falls in love with), the Brotherhood (the demonic 'cult' Belthazor was a part of), and lastly, the Source of All Evil.

By the time we get to the finale, Piper and Leo have married, Phoebe is trying to rescue Cole from becoming fully evil, and the Triad is vanquished, along with the Brotherhood. The season finale is definitely the best episode of the season, if not the entire series, and will leave you at the edge of your seat. Now, most people know that Shannen Doherty exited at the end of the season, with Rose McGowan (Paige Matthews) replacing her as a sister in the later part of the series.

The episodes from season three include:

- The Honeymoon's Over

- Magic Hour

- Once Upon a Time

- All Halliwell's Eve

- Sight Unseen

- Primrose Empath

- Power Outage

- Sleuthing With the Enemy

- Coyote Piper

- We All Scream For Ice Cream

- Blinded By the Whitelighter

- Wrestling With Demons

- Just Harried

- Death Takes a Halliwell

2395397,5,B000AXWHK8,"Well, this doesn't need much in-depth detail--Shannen's last season on the show, for whatever behind the scenes reasons. Whatever the case, another great year of Charmed. Whether or not the show got better or worse after this may be up for some debate--regardless, the series finale left you with kind of a vague feeling, knowing that for all intents and purposes, Prue was dead and the writers would have to come up with ways to explain it without ever showing her again.

Still, it was a great season finale, where finally, ""The Source"" is revealed in full. Of course, we all know he's the ""Devil,"" but it's still left with some mystery as he wears a hood to conceal his face (more on that in Season 4). A lot of great episodes before that, as the Cole Turner/Belthazor character gets introduced, along with the Triad and a myriad of powerful upper level demons. Along with Piper and Leo finally tying the knot, Victor returns, Piper gets her exploding power later on & a few other great twists I'm forgetting or omitting.

Even at this point, the show is losing none of its punch and probably gets better the following year...",1504656000,,1129,4.64

2395500,5,B000AXWHK8,"Season 3 of Charmed seemed like a never-ending sea of drama and thrill for the Charmed Ones. I mean, you've got Piper and Leo marrying against the Elders' wishes, you've got Phoebe sparking up a new romance with a demon sent by the Triad to kill the Charmed Ones, not to mention both of them get new powers this season: Phoebe gets the power to levitate and Piper gets the power to speed up molecules to the point where they combust. Where does that leave Prue? Well, aside from balancing her photography career with being a witch, she got into some drama of her own when she and her father Victor tried to mend their relationship, when Prue's suspicion of Phoebe's demon boyfriend Cole put a strain on their relationship, when her astral form got a mind of its own and began gallivanting all over town at the most inconvenient times (i.e. Piper's wedding) and when she died at the end of the season. Now Prue has died before in the series and was always revived, but this time, it's for good. The final scene in the season finale shows Piper and Prue lying unconscious after being knocked out cold by a demon assassin, with one or possibly both of them dead, but it wasn't until the season four premiere episode where it was confirmed that Prue was ultimately the unlucky one.

Overall, the third season of Charmed is definitely one that keeps you on your toes. It has triple the magic, triple the plot twists and triple the drama than ever before. There's no reason to get involved though, just sit back and watch the events unfold from the comfort of your own home.",1410825600,,1568,4.5017543859649125

2395607,5,B000AXWHK8,"The 3rd, and last season with Shannen Doherty as Prue, shows Charmed at it's finest. All three sisters through-out the span of the season develop a lot more emotionally and become more powerful and skilled in magic. New evils are revealed for them to face and touching moments occur more often than not. Leo and Piper's relationship finally comes full circle yet still is realistically rocky considering the lives they lead.

The amazing thing about Season 3 though is Julian McMahon as Cole Turner/Balthazar. He falls in love with Phoebe and adds a whole new depth to the concept of the story and also a new perspective of good and evil (and the grey areas that exist in between). Julian McMahon being added as a permanent cast member was the best thing to happen to the show in my opinion because his presence and charisma make the show that much more fun to watch. Whether it's him as Cole being very stoic, mysterious, or vulnerable or being Balthazar and showing rage and pain at the same time.

There are a couple episodes that weren't as good as the others but this season of Charmed is EXTREMELY solid. Towards the end of the season, Shannen Doherty's tension behind the set began to show a little but incredibly enough, she channeled that frustration into Prue and made her even more fierce and determined.

My favorite season of Charmed so far (I'm watching them in order right now).

Highly recommended.",1356134400,,1414,4.712550607287449

2395614,4,B000AXWHK8,"This is my favorite season of this series - the tension was really ramped up as Prue desperately tried to find out more info about The Triad; Piper & Leo's impending marriage plans anger The Elders; and Phoebe falls for the new Assistant D.A. who has secrets of his own. This season really clicks on all levels - the acting, story lines & special effects all work well and I never tire of re-watching this season.

This is also Shannen Doherty's last season on the show (sadly because her character, Pru was my favorite sister) and it's interesting to watch these episodes again knowing that and I wonder if the writers tried to clue the viewers in to the upcoming changes: in DEATH TAKES A HALLIWELL, the Angel of Death tells Pru that she would've died had she kept interfering in his plans & Piper's acquiring a new offensive power to help the sisters protect themselves.

Of the 22 episodes the ones I consider the strongest and which are my favorites are:

THE HONEYMOON'S OVER - 1st episode of the season we find out that Piper & Leo are still ""up there"" leaving Pru & Phoebe to wonder if they'll ever return; we are also introduced to Cole Turner, the new A.D.A

ALL HALLIWELL'S EVE - the Sisters are transported back to the 1600's to save a magical baby

SIGHT UNSEEN - Pru's obsession over stopping The Triad causes drama as a 2nd demon is sent to kill the Sisters

PRIMROSE EMPATH - Cole tricks Pru into uncursing a demon (notable for the Matrix-like fight between Pru & the demon)

SLEUTHING WITH THE ENEMY - Pru & Piper work with a demonic bounty hunter to find Belthazor while Phoebe searches for Cole

COYOTE PIPER - an evil essence takes over Piper

BRIDE & GLOOM - Pru is kidnapped by a demon who wants to wed her, turning her & thus her sisters evil (hysterical scene when Piper & Phoebe being to use their ""evil"" powers)

PRE-WITCHED - Piper & Leo decide to move out as the sisters battle a demon (formerly a cat) with 9 lives to spare; this epi also features flashbacks to when their Grams was alive as each sister decides to move out

SIN FRANCISCO - a demon who possesses a box of The 7 Deadly Sins curses the sisters & Leo with a sin each (Holly Marie Combs - Piper & Brian Krause - Leo are especially hilarious in their portrayals of sin)

LOOK WHO'S BARKING - Pru casts a spell to track a Banshee demon which turns Pru into a dog while Phoebe becomes a Banshee after battling the demon

ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE - one of the best episodes of the series!  The sisters race to save an innocent and while Pru & Piper are exposed practicing magic by a news crew, Phoebe goes to the underworld to save Cole.",1347667200,,2622,4.368312757201646
2395615,5,B000AXWHK8,"I love this season of Charmed and it's one of my favorites. I think the best overall is Season Two but this one is also great.  The show definitely got a lot darker this year especially with the addition of the character Cole Turner, a half human/half demon, who falls in love with Phoebe.  This was also the year when Piper and Leo get married. Yay!
There were lots of fun episodes here but some of the best for me are-The Honeymoon's Over, Once Upon a Time, Sight Unseen, Power Outage, Coyote Piper, We All Scream For Ice Cream, Bride And Gloom,and Exit Strategy.
This was sadly Shannen Doherty's final season so it's a must to own just for sentimental value. Prue will always be my favorite Charmed One. A must buy season!",1345939200,,725,4.443609022556391

2395620,5,B000AXWHK8,"One of many great shows from the late 90s in my opinion. ""Early Edition"" and ""Charmed"" being two of my favourites. Shows combining everyday life and something supernatural, which I think is an awesome and very entertaining combination. That was a very popular trend in TV shows created between 1995 and 2000 (""Buffy"", ""Angel"" and ""Touched by an Angel"" are other examples of that kind of TV series). For those who don't know what this is all about, it follows three witch sisters living in San Fransisco. They have three different powers (bring time to a standstill, see the future and move objects using only the mind), but (almost) no one except them know they have these powers or know they are witches. They have to use these powers to deal with everything from demons to more regular stuff. You can probably imagine how entertaining it is. I also happen to find Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano VERY HOT! Highly recommended. I have always just really liked the atmosphere in this show.",1310256000,,992,4.7398843930635834

I am somewhat disappointed in these supposed 'complete sets', since there appears to be missing episodes. I was finally able to pin it down with this season. The last episode of this set shows the sisters injured, but that was not the final episode for the season, which causes confusion going into the first episode of the following season.

2395661,5,B000AXWHK8,"The third season was the end of the series in one sense, but the beginning in another.  Due to offscreen 'issues' between Alyssa Milano and Shannen Doherty (a running tradition with her and her television series, 90210 anyone?) one or the other would have to go.

The season started off a month after the season two finale, with Piper still 'up there' with Leo (unknowing that she'd been gone this long, time moves differently 'up there').  It explored many things: sibling rivalry (a running theme throughout the series both before and after Prue's death), the wisdom of youth, dangerous relationships (which is more prevalent in the fourth season), father-daughter relationships, difficulties of newly weds, and more.  In one episode they learn about the true ways of natural magic.  Another deals with the inevitablity of death.  There is an episode that shows the relationship of the three sisters before the pilot.

Cole is introduced this season, in the first episode and plays out an eight episode arch where he is a demon working to destroy the charmed ones from within, but falls in love with Phoebe instead and going rogue.  Cole and Phoebe share a doomed love unlike the 'star-crossed lovers' storyline given to Piper and Leo.  Through out the season Prue demonstrates a distrust of Cole (although that seems to subside near the end when she sticks up for him) and never truly accepts him as her sister's love.

The final episode of the season 'ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE' I feel is one of the best episodes of the series.  It truly introduces 'The Source' to the audience, giving us our first actual glimpse of the underworld and its heirarchy (a theme that plays an extremely large part in the fourth season and the four seasons that follow that).  It also shows that the extreme ignorance and fear that the general public, as a whole, have of all things different and unknown.  How the hint of such power can be revered, coveted, feared and hated all at the same time.  The most emotional point in the episode is near the end when Piper is shot in front of Prue and Leo is in the underworld and cannot hear her calls for him.  In order to get her sister to the hospital Prue uses her powers against the people and press because they won't move for her car, immediately showing how truly dangerous she can be.  When they get to the hospital Piper dies and Prue become unconsolable and dangerous in her grief and commands Leo to accept the terms The Source gave for the use of Tempest.  That Phoebe must stay in the underworld with Cole and join the demons and evil.

Time resets to the beginning of the episode and the first demon attack.  But instead of Phoebe coming downstairs to call for Leo to heal her sisters she is not there and the audience is left wondering if one or all of the sisters will die, if the show has been cancelled.

The show was renewed but it was a while before they announced who they had let go.  Phoebe had been kept in the underword, at the mercy of The Source and all the demons with only Cole to protect her.  Prue and Piper were left bleeding to death from wounds sustained during a demon attack.  It was possible to write in a death for every single character on the show, Cole and Leo included.

This season ended the 'Prue seasons' and even though the show was funny at points, it also ended a theme of darkness in the show.  After season three the show got steadily lighter and slightly more comedic without losing its original story of three sisters who happened to be witches with magical powers who fought evil on pretty much a weekly/daily basis.

Charmed was also a show that began in the WB's heyday.  I have always lumped it together with ROSWELL, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, DAWSONS CREEK, FELICITY and a couple others in my mind.  Their entertainment was, somehow, of the same caliber, no matter how different they were.  It was the last of these shows to end and I believe it ended an era of television.

I recommend the third season as a neccessary purchase for any and all fans of the show, and anyone who loved the WB's old shows.",1213401600,2,4085,4.556164383561644

2395676,5,B000AXWHK8,"Well,

Season three is probably my favorite mostly because of Cole and also because Prue Dies(hehe. Also Phoebe begins to be more of a main character instead of a secondary character like she was in the first two seasons. Piper and Leo get married, finally!!
Cole part was very simple he was another Demon plant that went wrong for the Source when he fell in love, Phoebe denied the relation after finding out he was a demon but eventually found out that he was good at heart and they came back together. Near the end he killed a witch and Phoebe turns away only to find out he tricked in to doing it and they come back to together only to be hit with Piper's death which later ends up being Prue's death.",1212105600,,705,4.3007518796992485

2395678,5,B000AXWHK8,"This first second and third seasons were amazing. They created somewhat of a trilogy that ended with Prue's death in the third season. This season is very good, I love every episode.  The only problem I have with this season is the season finale. It's amazing in its sad way, seeing how the pivotal character dies. However, ""All Hell Breaks Loose"" originally had two parts. The second part tells what actually happened after the first part, naturally. Yet, the second part is not shown on tv and not to my knowledge on the dvd. I remember seeing this episode when it originally aired, and I haven't seen it since. I cannot find it anywhere. This season ""ends"" with Prue and Piper both close to death, and the next season begins with the funeral. There's no connection and the viewers have no idea how they got from two sisters being dead, to one sister alive and the other dead.

All in all, it's a terrific season with fantastic plot lines (example: my two favorite characters falling in love, Phoebe and Cole). I would definitely suggest you buy it, but remember that the season does end in a conclusive manner; you'll just never get to see it.",1211068800,,1146,4.585365853658536

2395680,4,B000AXWHK8,"In this the third season of ""Charmed"" was just about the best thus far, it is with a note of sadness that I watched the drama unfold.  Pru's death took more than a character away from the show.  The very essence of the show was lost as well.  Pru was the leader, the eldest, the one who held the three sisters together.  As far as I am concerned removing Pru was a big mistake.  Sure the show lasted 5 more seasons, but just barely.

Pru was replaced with Paige, but too bad the series lost it's original flavor.  At that it seemed the producers did not try to recreate that cohesion, the story line kind of just missed out on any kind of explaination.  Everyone else who had passed away made a reappearence but no Pru.  Big gapping hole in the story line.",1207612800,3,756,4.230769230769231

My favorite episodes are the ones where Prue has a stalker, and when a little girl needs the sisters help to save a fairy, and of course when Piper and Leo get married.

  Sadly, this season is the last time we see PRUE HALLIWELL, for she is killed in the last season, where she will not be returning for the next five seasons.

2395719,3,B000AXWHK8,"I love Charmed, and I watch the DVD's over and over again.  However, I do feel that season 3 was the beginning of the downward spiral.  The show's creator, Constance Burge, left the production around this time because she wanted the storyline to stick with the original concepts of the sisters' relationships and Wicca/witchcraft, with each show addressing a different issue, much like the first season (by far the best in my opinion).  The other producer, Brad Kerns, wanted to concentrate on the love stories of Piper/Leo and Phoebe/Cole, and maintain an essentially single storyline throughout the season.  I'm with Ms. Burge and was disappointed to see the direction the show took, and I began to lose interest.  The season is still good and I enjoy watching it, but not nearly as much as I enjoyed the first and second seasons.  Also, as annoying as Shannen Doherty is, I never got used to her leaving the show.  I often wonder if her reason for leaving was the same as Constance Burge's, rather than the rumored 'rivalry' between her and Alyssa Milano.

2395741,4,B000AXWHK8,"I have really enjoyed the Charmed series (Seasons 1-8) on T.V. so much so I have bought Seasons 1-5 DVD box sets. You almost need to start from the beginning to fully understand the story of these three ladies who are witches, in the modern day world. But if you started the Charmed series in the middle, you can always go back later. This Third season is filled with exciting & sometimes humor filled stories, shows often have famous or well known guests on them too. Each story is very different, but continues with the main characters. Sometimes the focus might be more on one of the three sisters, rather than all three. I look forward to the last three seasons to come out on DVD. Sure hope there will be extras & some deleted scenes, maybe funny clips also, since this show has done its final chapter. If you've never watched this series, please do, it is well worth your time. Even if you do start out with this Third season DVD set. Happy watching!",1151280000,4,956,4.4375

Anyone who says Shannen Doherty leaving made the show go down is crazy. The show got tons better after she left. The only thing I didn't like was how they treated Cole. He gave up everything to save them and became evil to save them. Then they turned on him and never tried to help him. Other than that, the show is awesome.

But after falling in ""Love"" with Pheobe Cole/Belthazor kills the ""Triad whom are later resurected in season 8"".After finding out Cole is a demon Pheobe can't bear to see her sisters ""Vanquish"" him so she fakes his death. However she can't lie to her sisters and tells them that she didn't vanquish Cole as an outraged Prue desperately tries to save Piper. Cole returns just in time for a Prue's demonic Wedding as a dark priestess tries to steal the Book of Shadows. The sisters mother is resurected for Pipers Wedding when

Prue is accused of Murder. Then Cole goes undercover in ""The Brotherhood of Thorn""but can the sistrs trust him. After Reman puts Cole under a spell he kills a witch and Pheobe tells him to get out. In a desperate search to find a Banshee prue is turned into a dog to help find it. But when Pheobe has a breakdown over Cole the Banshee attacks and turns Pheobe into a Banshee!!!and only Cole can both Pheobe and Prue. And when the ""Source"" sends in ""Shax his personal assasin""Prue and Piper

are exposed as witches!!!Then when Pheobe goes to hell""literally""to save Cole Piper gets shot and dies!!!In order to save her Pheobe makes a deal with the Devil to turn back time. The season ends with Shax throwing Prue and Piper threw walls!!!

And when I saw the season finale on TV it showed that part and then some. It showed prue die in the last episode or actually i belive it was a 2 part season finale. and then coming to the 4th season it doesn't even recap on how she died (Even though  most of us know) I just feel it's wrong for them to cut the BEST season finale of the series. and that if we are going to buy the series set then we should be able so see EVERY episode.,1142208000,4,701,3.9645390070921986
2395776,5,B000AXWHK8,"After being asked by Amazon to review this item I suppose I could share a few minutes and tell all that these are one of the best demon-fighting-butt-kicking TV series I have come accross. I saw an episode or two from the Charmed during the late nineties but I never really gave the show a second thought. The same is valid about Angel and Buffy the Vampire slayer. I was wrong! For all of them.

In the beginning of 2000 the Charmed was on TV in Germany. The show was aired fully translated and the three sisters witches spoke German fluently. It was really funny yet the action and suspense did not lose. Although it was fun to watch the first and the second series of the Charmed, they did not have the major plot line that runs throughout the third season. Introducing the character of Coll (J.M.) and developing the relationship between Piper and Leo brought to the Charmed a nice line to follow that made me looking farward to the next episode.

My only remark is if the producers of the DVD could settle for a richer DVD box that includes some features and interviews with cast and creators and not only bare episodes.",1142208000,4,1125,4.456310679611651

Season 2 ended with Piper & Leo going ""up there"" together, so season 3 starts out with Piper still gone after a month without any contact to her other sisters.  Prue and Pheobe are after soul stealing Gaurdians who attack Darrel and the new  DA Cole Turner (The Honeymoon's Over).  Phoebe's first encounter with him is lust at first site.  When Piper comes back with Leo she's got hell to pay for worrying her sisters so much.  In ""Magic Hour"" Piper and Leo attempt to marry while also trying to save the lives of two very in love cursed mortals from a Demon who's punishing one for not returning his love (If he cant have her, no one will - very LadyHawke).

2395812,5,B000AXWHK8,"I really came late to the party of ""Charmed"". Caught a TNT rerun and was hooked.  The first three episodes are definitely the best and really became special when Cole joined the crew. I was sorry to see Shannon leave under such a familiar pattern of hers - not getting along with the cast and being a bit of a prima donna. Heard it was a drinking problem also.  Anyway, the cast was superb, but honestly, some of the clothes these gals wear to work made them look like hookers - then the unfortunate departure of the creator of the show and the doubly, triply unfortunate arrival of rose. Ugly, part written for her made her act like a ninny and it hasn't changed a bit. Those botoxed lips and loose behavior made me just wait for the beginning seasons of the show again when Shannon is back.  Too bad they don't bring Cole back, he made the show and Nip Tuck is icky - he was being considered for the James Bond role, but was tied up with the NT contract.  I think the premise of the show is just so interesting and fun but Phoebe needs Cole back again with his powers.  Get rid of rose and that newbie Bobbi or Billi or something that is now ruining the show - no fourth witch needed.  Hopefully rose will leave - not a popular choice at all.  Just saw the announcement that the third season is out on Amazon and will try to accumulate the first 3 and maybe the fourth if Cole is still on.

I freakin loved her dude.....she was like one of the reasons I even started watching the show anyway.......I love Shannon...she made that show in my opinion....I mean I love the other two especially Piper she made me laugh...a lot.....but PRU was the main and the greatest....I miss her.....She should have never left...I believe Charmed would still be one of the best shows if she was still around....again that is my opinion.....

2395816,5,B000AXWHK8,"This was one of the Best Seasons of Charmed. Nearly ever episode was great. The Honeymoon's Over, Magic Hour, Once Upon a Time, All Halliwell's Eve are just the beginning of the best ones. Charmed introduces one of my favorite charactors: Cole. He was an exciting addition to the show. A powerful demon sent to kill the Charmed Ones. He is a smart and clever. And falls in love with Phoebe. Piper and Leo finally get married with the approval of the Elders. It also marks the end of Prue. Unlike most of the other reviewers I never liked Prue and wasn't sad when she departed. Prue was always bossing her sisters and acting superior to them. Her double standard with Phoebe. It was ok for Prue to save demon because he was Prue's former boyfriend but it wasn't ok for Phoebe not to vanquish Cole because she loved him. And I don't know whether this is part Shannen Dohorty or the problems going on with the cast but Prue always has to upstage her sisters. Like in Just Harried when I sat down to watch Piper and Leo finally wed after three years of waiting I expected it to be beautiful, wonderful wedding and more of Patty and Penny instead it was another epsoide about poor Prue, how she has it so hard. Like we haven't heard that for three years. Even in the last epsoide All Hell Breaks Loose (which Shannen Dohorty direct) in the scene where Piper dies in the hospital all the grieving, crying and attention is on Prue even after Leo, Piper's husband, orbs in and sees his wife dead. Aside from my personal dislike for Prue, her death gives Piper and Phoebe more room to grow and step out of Prue's shadow. Neither I think would have happened had Prue lived. We also get a new sister Paige.",1136073600,4,1695,4.401273885350318

2395818,5,B000AXWHK8,"Season 3 is my favourite series so far.

This is the season when we were introduced to new character Cole Turner (Julian McMahon), who will be Phobe's love interest. This is also the season when Piper and Leo are married. But most important of all - this is also the season that Shannen Doherty's Character Prue Halliwell is killed, in the brilliant episode `All Hell Breaks Loose'. This is after Shannen's best ever performance (my view at least) in `Primrose Empath'. Boy, can that woman act!

Other highlights over S3 include; Our introduction to Fairy's and trolls in `Once apon a Time', a beautifully produced episode. The Halloween episode - `All Halliwell's Eve' where the sisters go back in time to the 1600's. My favouriye guest star has to be the Angel of death (who also appears in season 7) who is introduced in `Death Takes a Halliwell.

And the CHARMED humour is finely tuned in `Westling With Demons' which features Prue and Phoebe in a demonic westling ring squaring up to Booker T, Scott Steiner and Buff Bagwell. And there are digs galore in `Look Who's Barking' when Prue is turned into a dog

2395819,5,B000AXWHK8,"this is the season I started to watch Charmed and got hooked on to it. Unfortunately after this season the insert of Paige and all its sudden inconsistencies written into the show got me out of the show, and into a much more promising show: Angel.

One of the reasons this season is the best is because of Shannen's surperb performance. I guess it's because that it's her last so she wanna go out with a bang. But of course another really big reason is Julian McMahon, and his incredibly ingenius performance of Cole, the demon who turned good by love. Too bad later on the writers totally screwed him up. I really wanna killed the writers for that. I was totally a big fan of Julian for a while.

This season had it all: drama, tragedy, betrayal, forbidden love stories, even cliffhangers to keep you watching. If only all the Charmed seasons were as good as this one *sign*

But yeah, if Charmed is any worth watching, this season is it.",1133568000,5,939,4.4476744186046515

Hopefully this will be the beginning of future extras in the DVD sets for this Entertaining TV Series. Fans would have loved to hear commentaries from Shannen on this her last season with the show... I sometimes wonder if the actors have as much love and expectations for these DVD releases which are going to be the historical record for these TV shows... certainly the fans want more behind the scenes understanding of their favorite series.

Seaon 3 is a great season for Charmed, the last for Pru and the first for Cole(Julian McMahon). His rough and tumble romance with Phoebe highlights the season along with the must-see wedding disaster between Piper and Leo(Brian Krause).

The plots are very well written, entertaining. The clothes are fashion setting, the special effects are cutting edge especially the demons being burned and blown up whenever they attempt to defeat the ""Power of Three""

I really recommend this DVD set for Charmed fans and if you are learning french this will be a fun treat.",1132790400,3,1265,4.952830188679245

But this season is very tempting to buy since it is the best season of the 7 1/2(with the exception of Season 4!!!) What made this the best season was everything, the acting, the action, the characters, the storylines.....All top notch. This season was Prue, Piper, and Phoebe at their magical best as the Charmed Ones. This season introduces one of the best characters ever, Cole Turner aka. Belthazor!!! Cole is such a freshing character, half human/half demon!!! The story between Cole and Phoebe's forbidden love was amazing to watch!!! Piper and Leo continue to fight for their and it leads to the day we've all been waiting for....!!! Prue contines to find herself as she goes in strengh, but of course we all know by the end of the season, Prue will find her down fall!!! Here is Season 3:

Honeymoon's Over-Good episode!!! ""While Prue and Phoebe trackdown demons called the Guardians, they meet interney Cole Turner and Piper and Leo return from their sudden disappearence!!!"" A good premeire. the guardians were interesting demons, Phoebe's becomes a blonde and gets a new power:Levitation!!

Magic Hour-Good Episode!!! ""The Charmed Ones must help a couple who have been curse to become animals by a demon, while Piper and Leo try to get married!!!"" This was a nice episode, and it's sad at the end when Leo goes away and Piper cry for him!!!

So Season 3 really shows what Charmed is all about and the show was at it's pick!!! Shannon Doherty really went all out for her last season on Charmed, she is still missed til' this day!!! So go get the dvd, and re-live the Golden day of Charmed!!!",1132617600,9,8155,4.805139186295503

2395839,5,B000AXWHK8,"Marking Shannen Doherty's last season, the third season of Charmed had critical transitions for the Halliwell sisters. The 22 episode series (2000-2001) continued the WB sci-fi show about three sisters learning about their destiny as all-powerful witches who save innocents.

In preparation for Doherty's departure, many of the storylines begin focusing on Piper's life. Piper and Leo are desperately in love and want to get married regardless of what their religion says, it is supposedly taboo for White Lighters and Witches to marry each other. In ""Once upon a time"" Piper rebels against these very same rules by going on strike and refusing to save innocents until she can marry Leo.  The strike obviously works because subsequent stories have the wedding continue---albeit with dramatic bumps.

Leo finally meets his prospective father in law, Victor Halliwell (James Read) during ""The good, the bad, and the cursed"" but does not yet tell him that he is a White Lighter. Leo is aware the disclosure could dredge up personal memories about the late ex-wife and why their own marriage had failed.  In earlier seasons we learned the Charmed Ones's mother had fallen in love with her own White Lighter, Sam Wilder (Scott Jaeck).  Yet, because Piper is his own daughter and was not already married to another person when she fell in love with Leo, dad ultimately accepts Leo into the family.

Phoebe does not learn Cole's true identity until ""Sleuthing with the enemy"" when she drops in on him uninvited.  Cole is ambivalent about his own secret identity; he wants to be with Phoebe as the mortal Cole, but the demon Balthazar clearly enjoys having his powers AND wants to destroy the Charmed Ones.  Cole uses Balthazar for good in ""The demon who came in from the cold"", going undercover in the demon world to help the sisters solve a case.

Despite this episode, Cole purposefully remains an ambiguous character throughout the season. While Phoebe embarks on a quest to find a cure for Baltzar(""All hell breaks loose""), Cole embarks on a parallel odyssey to reduce the HUMAN side of hi(""Look who's barking"") and also tries to convince the underworld that he is still `one of them' by stealing an amulet from another witch (""Exit strategy"").  This coupled with his awesome looks provides romantic tension throughout the season.

This season also has some interesting stand-alone episodes without anything to do with either of those two story arcs.""We scream for ice cream"" plays upon the enduring `ice cream man-as child molester' urban legend. The sisters investigate why children disappear whenever ice cream truck bells are heard. It appears that the driver of one particular ice-cream truck in the area IS abducting children.

Another good stand-alone is ""Death takes a Halliwell"" because Prue receives a warning she is destined to die in the near future. Audiences knew about the `premonition' because trade magazines were talking up Doherty's impending departure, but the plot development also meant that Prue would not be brought back under a `different actress/same character' arrangement. Prue Haliwell the character was also leaving the series.

Finally, ""All hell breaks loose"" is the episode itself where Prue dies in the line of duty;it also has a newscast inadvertently expose the sister's secret while they are vanquishing a demon. Now the rest of San Francisco-and possibly the world knows about the Halliwell sisters and could exploit their powers for dangerous means. We would have to wait until the next season to see how the Power of Three would be resurrected---and how the surviving Halliwell sisters cope.

Becoming close and also coming to think of themselves as `superheroes', Prue's death especially jars to the surviving Halliwells-they are reminded of their own mortality and also presume that the Power of Three is gone.

Frankly, I consider this the last purchase-worthy season of Charmed, specifically because Doherty still was in the cast.  Series Creator Constance M. Burge also departed (over creative differences). This season confirms that both who is in front of and behind the cameras ultimately makes a VERY BIG difference in the overall series quality. Season three is the last entire season of Charmed which I really love.

I think that this season especially should have had extras. I don't believe the addition would have cost signifigantly extra. Especially given this season's signifigance in the overall series cannon, extras (at least one!) would have been worth it.",1132012800,15,4513,5.14344262295082
2395840,5,B000AXWHK8,"I love this show. When it first came out I thought it would be okay, I had no idea it was going to be so awesome. I am addicted now though. I never saw the episode where Prue dies. I always thought they just kicked her off the show and said she died. I can't wait to see that episode, I hear its good :)",1131926400,7,303,3.6769230769230767
2395841,5,B000AXWHK8,"I like this season. It's the last one with Shannon and I like the new types of powers and creatures they came up with. They went a bit more into folk-lore and mythology. Now, I wouldn't say it's my favorite season. My favorite Charmed season is the fourth one. People might get upset with me saying this ( Why? I don't know.), but what people need to know is, sometimes actors don't get along. It could be money or other things. Although I can't say for sure that's why Shannon left.

 As the saying goes

""On with the Show"". I'm kinda bumbed though that there aren't any extras.

Maybe someone, I won't say who, was asking for alot of royalties.

However, I think it's worth buying it. But see if it's cheaper at a store before you decide to on line.",1131753600,7,751,4.297872340425532
2395862,5,B000AXWHK8,"Well, I have been watching the show since it started. Personally, I like all of the characters. Shannen was a good actress, but if she can't put aside her feelings and get along with people, well, then she shouldn't be acting at all. I think that Rose was a good replacement. The writers of the show still make it new and fresh. There is always something different going on with the sisters, whether with Alyssa, in season 8 she thinks she is pregnant. Or with Rose in season 3 she was turned into a vampire. The story line can keep on going. I think that the show has benefited big time b/c of shannen leaving. It gave more opportunities for story lines.

And I think that Piper's son Finley plays baby Chris on the show! I could be wrong though.",1130803200,9,747,4.335714285714285
2395863,5,B000AXWHK8,I have been watching Charmed since the beginning. I loved all the seasons.  I personally like Rose McGowen. I think she is a better Charmed one than Shannon Doherty. It never ceases to amaze me how the writers can keep the show fresh. I think Charmed is perfect for those who want to be special and want to kick ass. I highly reccommend the entire series.,1129852800,15,355,4.378787878787879

2395866,4,B000AXWHK8,"I will say that this is the last season where CHARMED is at its BEST. You will know why when you watch and compare season 1-3 with 4-7. Charmed ratings continued to drop ever since Shannen Doherty left the show. It only picked up again in the second half of season 7, you know why?

1. Shannen Doherty is a big contribution to the show, it is a big mistake to let her go.

2. Rose Mcgowan's acting is not bad, but its a big difference compared to Shannen Doherty.

3. Story-lines are inconsistent. A lot of times story-lines of season 4-7 contradicts with the earlier season.

4. The stories are not as good as they use to be. Writters leans too much towards mythology. CHARMED is supposed to be 3 Witches living in the moder world, vaquishing demons and at the same time trying to live a normal life.

so if i were you only buy CHARMED seasons 1-3 the rest of the season suck, although season 7 is so-so not that bad.",1128988800,11,918,4.252873563218391
2395867,4,B000AXWHK8,"I've been reading a lot of the Shannen-centric reviews and while I have to agree that Shannen's Prue did add a welcome dimension to the show (she was my favourite from seasons 1-3) - all was far from lost upon her exit.

May I point out that Rose McGowan (her ostensible 'replacement' if you wish to be predictable, however if you care to look closely you'll see that the introduction of Paige re-orientated the entire Charmed One pecking order rather than just inserting another body into it) has now been 'Charmed' for more seasons than Shannen, and the show has remained successful. May I also point out that Shannen's creative difficulties with casts and crews extend beyond this particular television show (90210 anyone?) and into others, so it's a little rich ascribing the blame to everyone from Kern, McGowan and Milano without dealing with the prima diva herself.

Okay, now that's off my chest.

I love season three, it introduces Cole and finally give Phoebe that arc that had been so heavily hinted at during the first two seasons, i.e. her evil past life, and birth on the nexus plus the hints towards the end of season two (Apocalypse Not), as to how good and evil can work together for a common goal only temporarily - and then just barely. Now with Phoebe's potential moral ambivalence underscored, Dan history, and the deeper workings of the demonic underworld further revealed we could go into Season Three with a purpose; and it starts straight away with a bang, a clear statement of intent for the entire season.

Straight off we're introduced to Cole - whom Phoebe immediately lusts (she, like the rest of us, has eyes), and Prue somewhat mistrusts. The Elders show their disapproval of Piper and Leo's developing relationship, causing contention between the pair (Leo proposes, Piper at first refuses, she later comes around only for all manner of obstacles to present themselves).

Prue remains firmly at the head of the wiccan triangle but is forced to deal with several outstanding personal issues - death and a growing sense of isolation being but a few. S3 is also the season that - even more than 1 and 2 foreshadows Prue's death (foreshadowing that is only mildly seconded by the possible death of Piper. If you don't believe me, check the number of episodes that feature Prue's death, or Prue contemplating her issues regarding death. Or even, count the number of episodes where Prue actually dies). I am aware that it maybe wasn't planned that it reach it's apex with Prue's actual demise but it is there - particularly in Death Takes A Halliwell.

Actually, that was the one reason why, as much as I kicked against it early in S4, I recognised why it was important that Prue no longer be there. From S1-3 Prue is always the one that takes charge of the group. You only have to observe the few episodes where Piper and Phoebe have to work together without Prue to show how heavily they depend on her - Piper in particular often hangs back and lets the other two take over. Prue had a very strong personality, which you can observe when she and Phoebe often clash - especially in the episode Wrestling With Demons. She has a strong need to protect the group/family and this need supercedes even her own personal needs and desires - desires which eventually, and literally, leap out at her in episodes like Just Harried. When Prue departs, the power of Three becomes less an eldest sister directed team and more a group on similar footing with each other. It also gives both Phoebe and Piper (especially Piper) the room they need to step out of her shadow and display their own capabilites.

And finally, in Season Three, there's Cole. A half-demon, half-human (with a soul, we're told) and an interestingly repressed conscience. Assigned by the demonic Triad to destroy the Power Of Three through Phoebe (their presumed weakest link), Cole (who's demonic alter ego is Belthazor) falls in love with his mark, ultimately proving traitorous towards his own kind - a defiance that leads his and Phoebe's relationship through almost as many twists and turns as Leo and Piper. Should you care to buy Seasons 4 and 5 you'll see where this ultimately leads them but for now it's clear that the writer's are trying to mirror Phoebe's own potential magical ambivalence, with Cole's actual moral ambivalence - setting the stage for her to deal with her own issues of believing that's she's evil (if you watch S1 and 2 closely you'll not only notice her penchant for bad boys but her need to unobjectively defend anyone viewed as potientially evil, e.g. Aviva, Clay, even her father, or an outsider). In other words, Cole's external demons, reflect Phoebe's inner ones.

Also, this season they show several instances of Cole changing his point of view towards a problem purely because of how Phoebe views it, or how it will affect Phoebe. It's something that leads he and Prue to butt heads more often than not (see The Good, The Bad and The Cursed, also directed by Shannen Doherty). It's a telling trait, that can only lead to tragedy, as it does but that's some way away yet.

Cole's presence also causes a temporary rift between the sisters. This rift is made all the more dangerous by the fact that the sisters are drifting ever closer to their ultimate destiny as the Power of Three (more of which comes in the following season). But when disaster strikes at the end of the season and magic is exposed could the Power of Three be irrevocably pushed beyond it's limits? Buy it and find out.",1128729600,12,5513,4.7284079084287205
2395898,5,B000AXWHK8,"First I would like to address a previous review.....I have a life thank you VERY much, but fans of Prue (myself included here) recognize good acting versus lackluster acting.  I purchased the first season of Charmed with some reservations....you see I had tried SOOOO hard to keep watching the show after Prue left....but Paige well she just couldn't cut it and the writing and chemistry between the characters just wasn't as good.  After watching the first season though, I rememberd what I had SO loved about the show to start with.  Season two just confirmed it and now season three will cement it.  There was a chemistry between Prue, Piper, and Phoebe on screen that made you almost really believe they WERE sisters.....the show was just perfect on SO many levels.....I can hardly wait for this box set to come out.  Unfortunately, it will be the last season of Charmed I buy as for me the show ended this season and became something just not worthy of the name.",1128729600,7,967,4.6982248520710055
2395899,5,B000AXWHK8,"If your are an old or new fan of the soon concluding series Charmed, season 3 is the one to get. It truly does deserve 5 stars out of 5, even though there are some lackluster episodes. Why? Because, the acting is better than ever (Primrose Empath, Pre-Witched) the storylines are catchier, spookier, and more inventive than ever (Once Upon A Time, All Halliwell's Eve, Power Outage, Sin Francisco, Look Who's Barking,Coyote Piper ), and most importantly the writers really show of during this season, creating the best storylines for all of the girls. Arc's such as Phoebe's first real love, the doomed Cole, and Piper's desire to wed the man of her dreams Leo, and their continuous sturggle with it all add to this amazingly written season. Saving the best for the last, Season three also is the final season in which Shannen Doherty's fine portrayl of Prue Halliwell ends, but if you ask me the Season finale does not do her departure any justice. Furthermore, you might want to skip filler episodes such as We All Scream For Ice Cream , Wrestling With Demons,The Good, The Bad and The Cursed, since they are clearly included for reasons unknown to me. The season is still a stellar one, and the my personal favorite out of the three to be released.",1128470400,4,1251,4.665158371040724

Rumors may say she was fired, because she's difficult to work with.  But that's who she is and what makes her so unique.  It probably happened the same way in Beverly Hills 90210, she made that show too.

We would love for the finale of Charmed to have prue,cole, detective trutto, her mom and grandma come back to the show.  If you can make (Barabas ""demon that detects fear"" come back from the death 5 times, why not the other characters.

2395903,4,B000AXWHK8,"Charmed has been one of my all-time favourite series for a long time now.  I was so excited when I got the first two seasons for my birthday in August and immediately got the third season, when it became available here last week.  The show is a lot more tense and dramatic in this season.  Personally I preferred the second season overall I think -

1) Because I've never liked Julian McMahon and Cole's character really annoyed me anyway,

2) I really began to dislike Phoebe a whole lot and her whole relationship with Belthazor/Cole and how that affected her relationship with her sisters, and

3) Because Prue was killed off and she was my favourite character and had the coolest powers too.

Having said that - a few individual episodes throughout season three were really quite spectacular I thought.

Personal faves included: ""All Halliwell's Eve"", ""Sight Unseen"", Primrose Empath (one of Shannen Doherty's best performances I think), ""Just Harried"" and of course ""All Hell Breaks Loose"".

I didn't really mind Paige all that much when she came into the show, it took me ages to get used to her though.  But having seen the first 3 seasons again after all these years, I now know what I miss from the Charmed shows nowadays.  All in all, a fantastic series that all should give a go - I now have my mum hooked on Charmed and hounding me to hurry up with season three, lol.

2395923,5,B000AXWHK8,"Charmed, Third Season Review:

This is one of my all time favorite TV shows.  I loved seasons 1 & 2, but the 3rd season is my favorite.  I am a huge Shannen Doherty fan and connected with her character as Prue Halliwell.  I was extremely disappointed with the season finally, ""All Hell Breaks Loose"" because she dies!!  It was awful, I cried like a baby!  I really felt Prue had come a long way and the show was getting soooo good!

I had heard many different rumors of why she left...but I think the one about Prue, Shannen Doherty and Phoebe, Alyssa Milano not ""getting along"" was definitely true.  This season I saw a drastic change in their personalities towards each other...especially at the end of the season.

I was very intrigued that they brought in Julian McMahon as Cole a.k.a. Belthazor.  He brought a lot of excitement and tension between the sisters'.  He is very handsome and charming and I love the struggle he endures...good versus evil.  I am also glad that Leo, Brian Krause's character remained, I love him and Piper together.  He brings a different aspect to the show as their ""white lighter"" and feel he is part of the Halliwell family.

I would definitely recommend Season 3 to any Charmed fans.  I ""might"" buy season 4, only because they still make references to Prue.",1127606400,9,1293,4.609649122807017

2395925,5,B000AXWHK8,"Inspired by the actual Earth-centered religion of Wicca, many television viewers in 1998 became enchanted with the fictional story of three extraordinary sisters who, after their grandmother's death, discover that they are witches and that each has a unique magical power.  The oldest, Prudence ""Prue"" Halliwell (Shannen Doherty), discovers that she has a magical ""punch"" with which she can physically force anyone (or anything) to be thrown away from her.  The middle sister, Piper Halliwell (Holly Marie Combs), discovers that she can magically freeze anyone or anything.  The youngest sister, Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano), discovers that she has a magical gift of foresight that allows her to see potentially disastrous future events for individuals if she touches an object that has been handled by them.  As it turns out, the sisters' mother, Patty Halliwell (regular guest Finola Hughes), and their grandmother, Penny 'Grams' Halliwell (regular guest Jennifer Rhodes), were also witches.  Hidden within their San Francisco house attic is their famed Book of Shadows (book of spells and information about various paranormal beings, such as demons and white lighters).  The sisters also discover that they are unique among witches in that they possess the very powerful ability to invoke the ""power of three"", which is a very powerful incantation that can be used to destroy demons and other evil beings.  In fact, that is their mission: to protect the world from the evil attacks of various demons, warlocks and other evil beings.  Of course, these newly discovered abilities and frequent attacks from demons wreak havoc for the sisters' lives, especially their careers and attempts at dating.  However, the sisters also discover that they are not alone in their efforts as they are frequently visited by the ghosts of their mother and grandmother, and that the equivalent of a guardian angel known as a ""white lighter"", Leo Watts (Brian Krause), not only provides them with important information and assistance, he can also heal them of their wounds.  The sisters are also visited occasionally by their estranged father, Victor Bennett (regular guest James Read); and because the sisters are so frequently involved with seemingly criminal activities, they become friends with local police officer Darryl Morris (Dorian Gregory).

The third season marked two major changes in the series.  First, a new main character enters the lives of the sisters: the Assistant District Attorney Cole Turner (Julian McMahon).  Being very handsome and sophisticated, it isn't long before one of the sisters, Phoebe, becomes quite attracted to him.  However, Cole is not exactly what he seems: he's actually a powerful demon named Belthazor who was sent by the Source (the leader of the demons) to destroy the Halliwell sisters; but his human side unexpectedly begins to fall for Phoebe.  What will the sisters do when they discover Cole's true identity?  Will Cole destroy the sisters, including the one whom he's falling in love?  Also, how can the sisters find a way for Piper and Leo to get married, which is strictly forbidden because he's a whitelighter?

The answers are contained within the third season's 22 episodes that aired between 2000 and 2001.  They include ""The Honeymoon's Over"", ""Magic Hour"", ""Once Upon a Time"", ""All Halliwell's Eve"", ""Sight Unseen"", ""Primrose Empath"", ""Power Outage"", ""Sleuthing With the Enemy"", ""Coyote Piper"", ""We All Scream for Ice Cream"", ""Blinded by the Whitelighter"", ""Wrestling with Demons"", ""Bride and Gloom"", ""The Good, the Bad and the Cursed"", ""Just Harried"", ""Death Takes a Halliwell"", ""Pre-Witched"", ""Sin Francisco"", ""The Demon Who Came In from the Cold"", ""Exit Strategy"", ""Look Who's Barking"" and ""All Hell Breaks Loose"".

With engaging characters, wonderful scripts, exciting plots and great special effects, I rate the very exciting third season of ""Charmed"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  Though Shannen Doherty left ""Charmed"" after this third season in the season finale ""All Hell Breaks Loose"", all is not lost as is revealed in the fourth season with the discovery of a previously unknown sister named Paige Matthews (Rose McGowan).",1126828800,97,4212,5.2942942942942945
2395926,5,B000AXWHK8,"My favorite season. I completely love season 3. It's when Julian comes on!!!!Yay! The best actor there is. He does drama perfectly from Charmed to Nip/Tuck. I love watching their relationship unfold. It's sad to know that it will soon fall apart but still great to see them so happy. Gotta say, I really didn't care that they killed Prue off, not my fav character. I don't like Rose either though, I'm not sure which I would rather have on the show. Prue was cocky and acted like she knew everything and was in charge of everything and Paige just annoys me. My fav is Pheobe(yes, I know I spelled it like this) Alyssa is just a great actress and she portrays Pheobe perfectly shifting between humor and drama. Not too fond of Piper. She didn't used to bother me but after Prue died, she took charged and really started to get annoying. ""Oh, my poor life. I want to be normal. I have a mortal husband and a successful business and two boys. Poor me!"" while Pheobe just wants to desperately be a mother, which is so sad because you can tell that her character should be a mom since the 2nd season and still no kids. Anyway, I'll stop ranting now. Season 3 is the best. Everyone buy it and I am mad that we won't have any special features

Oh, and since I left a character out, I hate Leo. He's like Piper's little puppy, following her around, obeying her every order and if you see the Knight episode in the 4th season, watch him run and tell me that he does not look wierd.",1126742400,4,1472,4.294964028776978
2395927,5,B000AXWHK8,Charmed is one of my favorite shows. I started watching it later in the seasons. THen I was hooked. I loved Shannon Doherty's Prue. My favorite is Piper first then Prue. I was very sad when Prue was killed off. Paige is ok but not as good as prue. Hopefully someday we will see prue come back even if only for a small part.,1126656000,6,323,4.0625
2395928,5,B000AXWHK8,"Unfortunately, I didn't start watching Charmed until the reruns starting airing on TNT.  I don't know why because I love the supernatural shows but for some reason I got into the show late.  Once, I started watching the reruns then I didn't miss any of the new episodes on the WB.  I have to agree with everyone else in saying that Season 3 is the best, mainly because of the character Cole joining the storyline.  He is just wonderful to watch.  Even though this is the best season, it is sad that Shannon left at the end.  When you watch the first 2 seasons you can see that the actresses really get along well and they definitely have chemistry on the screen but when Season 3 gets rolling you know that something is different even if you didn't read all the gossip headlines.  You can see the rift between Shannon and Alyssa in the show especially towards the end of Season 3 when they hardly appear in scenes together.  It is truly sad that they were once so close that Shannon was a bridesmaid for Alyssa in her wedding and now they don't even speak.  I think all the actresses (including Rose) are extremely talented and they're all an important part of the show. It would be great if Shannon could return at least once in awhile then they could be the ""Power of Four"".  Now, that would be a twist in the show!!  I doubt that would ever happen due to the situation with Shannon and Alyssa along with the other people involved with the show.  I don't think Shannon left on a good note but it would be nice for them to repair the damage and in turn do a great thing for the show.  Anyhow, this was a great season as well as the others and worth the purchase.  I will definitely have the entire Charmed series in my DVD collection!  Can't wait for the other seasons to be released.  Hopefully, the future season collections will have some special bonus material.  Maybe, they can add the unaired pilot to the last season's DVD release since it wasn't included in the first season's collection like it should have been.  As usual, there are rumors that this season (2005-2006) will be the last.  As they say ""all good things must come to an end""!",1126396800,12,2149,4.39493670886076
2395929,5,B000AXWHK8,"Season 3 is fantastic, along with 1,2,4,5,6 and 7. Can't wait to see season 8! They are all great actresses, each with their own unique personalities. No two are the same, but their love for eachother is strong. Nothing could stand in their way to protect the innocent. Charmed is charming! I never get tired of this show. Only downfall, the dvd's take to long to come out! Keep it coming!",1126310400,6,389,4.492957746478873
2395930,5,B000AXWHK8,"To me the chemistry between Prue, Piper and Phoebe was AWESOME! I loved Prue the BEST! She was strong, confident, sexy, beautiful and she can ACT! Itdidn't hurt she has great hair either! Shannen Doherty is the ""Kate Jackson/Sabrina Duncan/Charie's Angels"" of ""Charmed"". I started watching Charmed since day 1 BECAUSE of Shannen Doherty because of her turn in ""Beverly Hills 90210"". The woman can act! I never was that big of fan of Alyssa Milano. If anyone should have left it should have been her! Rose McGowan is the least favorite of the bunch. To me the strongest seasons were the first 3 seasons, season 3 being my favorite. What keeps me watching Charmed 7 years later? Piper played wonderfully by Holly Marie Combs of course! I have the action figures!!",1126310400,9,761,4.7727272727272725
2395931,5,B000AXWHK8,"Charmed is a show i have enjoyed for almost 8 years now, i have grown up with it. And have enjoyed its ups and downs. The 3rd season is deffinantly one of charmeds best, the characters and development are amazing, and keep you hooked.

This is the season the changes charmed. With the depature of Shannen Doherty, you can deffinantly feel the tension that she indded creates towards the end of the season.

I have not yet come accros a show that engages so much as charmed does. Prue deals with her internal demons, piper marrys, pheobe finds her soul mate, Piper discovers a new power. The triad is vanquished, they descover the source, and destroy a whole bunch of evil, all in 22 amazing episodes.

My favorutes include;

- 3.04 ""All Halliwels Eve""

- 3.06 ""Primrose Empath""

- 3.08 ""Sleuthing With The Enemy""

- 3.09 ""Coyote Piper""

- 3.11 ""Blinded By The Whitelighter""

- 3.13 ""Bride And Gloom""

- 3.15 ""Just Harried""

- 3.17 ""PreWitched""

- 3.20 ""Exit Strategy""

- 3.22 ""All Hell Breaks Loose"" - Best episode of the season, if not series

As you can see that is most of the season, this season will take you on a roller coaster ride of emotion, from laugh out loud moments, to the down right sad touching scenes.

The only downside is that paramounts slack asses have not given us any extras, nor a very exciting cover, i truly believe that a 10 year old with ""paint"" could create something more visualy pleasing. The images on the cover are pixelated and the episode guide is poorly set out. The whole package leaves much to be desired. I thought after making us die hard fans wait for years that they would loyaly reward us with some extras, or at least nice menus, with some background music. But they didnt, the worst i have ever seen in fact. But putting that aside...

Charmed is an outragios show that deserves the respect of anything great. Im sure if you buy this DVD you will be satisfied greatly.",1126310400,3,1913,4.501449275362319
