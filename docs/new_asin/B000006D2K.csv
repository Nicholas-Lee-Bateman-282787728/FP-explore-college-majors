1193084,3,B000006D2K,"Director Maurice Pialat's film is more an exercise in star power than any presentation of narrative, with Isabelle Huppert leaving her husband Guy Marchand for the leather-clad ex-con ruffian Loulou played by Depardieu. Even though the tone takes its cue from the character of Loulou as a womanising drifter, the low key seemingly improvised rambling scenes are preferable to the gab-fests of Eric Rohmer, who is responsible for the negative connotations associated with French films by Americans. This film is actually mistitled since although it is Depardieu that is the catalyst for Huppert to change her life, the story is more hers than his. Or perhaps it is that the representation of her crumbling marriage that is more dramatically interesting than Depardieu's ""loafing"". If Loulou's character is sketched thinly that may to keep him as an enigma, the mysterious bad-boy that women always seem to prefer. At one point Huppert says of Depardieu, ""I prefer a loafer who f**ks, to a rich guy who bugs me"". And although we can see how limiting Depardieu's world is to Huppert, we also understand her attraction to him, highlighted by a silent image of the couple stumbling down a street in a drunken embrace. Pialat's best moments involve scenes of violence outbursts - a family get together soured by jealousy, the loud music of a disco drowning out shouting, and a brawl between Depardieu and Marchand in a courtyard with a following drink together as evidence of the French form of civilised behaviour. Huppert also has an early scene with Marchand where the camera follows his pursuit and humiliation of her, and here Huppert's anger invalidates the myth of her as a passive performer. The film also shows us footage of her laughing, which is unusual since her situations are usually so glum, and she is funny when she yells in shocked reaction to being hit, in the famous love scene where the bed collapses, and when she falls in the street by accident. Pialat also gives Marchand a laugh by having him resort to playing the saxophone in depression.",991872000,17,2058,4.933717579250721
1193085,5,B000006D2K,"This movie goes back to the early Eighties and I still remember it, since I went to watch it three times within a few days. It was probably due to the scene where the bed crashes down. It is one of the films of the young  Depardieu in couple with Isabelle Huppert and with an excellent Maurice  Pialat directing it. In reality nothing really important happens, but the  love scenes are nice. Depardieu plays a young guy who is rather happy  without being fixed up in regular work and Isabelle Hupper leaves her  husband to stay with him. She earns their living and also decides to abort,  since Depardieu only wants to work after the birth of the child. This is  also the sad fact about the movie that in reality does not have an end.  There is also a nice scene with an open air dinner, much fun and lots to  eat and to drink.",958176000,16,827,4.25
7904126,3,B000006D2K,Two of the giants of contemporary French cinema in their youth. Sadly it doesn't hold up well and has few gems of either dialog or plot. Aside from the fact that I would Watch Ms. Huppert act in anything I found this film a bit silly and hardly an indicator of what was to come from either actor.,1475280000,,296,4.120689655172414
7904127,4,B000006D2K,"Director as auteur Maurice Pialat and his camera tell the story called Loulou, focusing more on his troubled girlfriend Nelly and her topsy-turvy married life.

Filmed in 1980, Pialat's style of filmmaking was obviously influenced by the Americans, especially Martin Scorsese. As the director, Pialat uses the camera to follow around the two main characters, Loulou,, played by Gerard Depardieu, and Nelly played by Isabelle Huppert, and show their troubled lives. Loulou is an overage JD, Juvenile Delinquent, who hangs around his delinquent friends, always on the lookout for the quick way of making money, crime. Nelly on the other hand is from the other spectrum of life, she's an accountant, who had married a boring, abusive husband, who is a successful businessman.

So how does these two completely different characters, Loulou and Nelly, get together? She goes to a nightclub with her friend and meets him. he's a petty hoodlum, yet he treats her with kindness and respect, just what she was looking for. Her abusive marriage to Andre is on the rocks, and she wants to dump him like a garbage bag to get her live back together. Yet she once again reaches out for someone who spells trouble. Nevertheless, she prefers the hoodlum, Loulou, to her abusive husband with the money. She secretly craves freedom from her humdrum boring middle class bourgeois lifestyle. She is more attracted to Depardieu's leather jacket than her husband's bank account.

Seeing Depardieu and Huppert again, this time in a film made in 1980, was a mind-opening experience. Last week, I watched Valley of Love with Depardieu and Huppert in a move made in 2015, thirty-five years after.  In the 2015 movie, Depardieu had gained about 80 pounds, and Huppert had gracefully aged, yet she had obviously aged.

In Loulou, the two main characters form an odd couple Loulou is jobless with no real hope of a successful future, he's a hoodlum, and Nelly is a desperate housewife wanting to escape her awful, abusive marriage, even though she lives in a fancy, spacious Parisian apartment. Her greatest pleasure is bedding Loulou. Nonetheless, they become careless, and Nelly gets pregnant. Face with the possibility of having a child by a hoodlum, jobless husband, with no future, she gets an abortion. She tells her husband, Andre, played by Guy Marchand, that the child is not his, but belongs to the other guy, is simply a moment in a complicated life.

This movie, however, is a director's signature story. Pialat, like Scorsese, and other brilliant American movie directors, uses the camera as a quilt. Pialat tells the story through the lens. It works. He has an interesting, controversial story to tell. And it's emotionally gripping. I would guess filmmaker as auteur was the thing to do in 1980. Money and finances took a backseat until the bill collector came knocking on the door to repossess the backseat.

When the movie was made in 1980, Depardieu was already a star actor, and Huppert improved her standing in the world of cinema by appearing with Depardieu. And if I'm not mistaken, I think I saw the French actress Emmanuelle Devos as a small walk on part in this film. With all of that acting talent, plus the visionary director Pialat calling the shots about camera angle, this movie was worth watching. It's different from other great French filmmakers like Francois Truffaut, Jean Luc Goddard, Jean Renoir yet Pialat's vision about the nuts and bolts of a movie is quite clear. His moving cameras on roller pads, and close ups of Depardieu and Huppert takes filmmaking to a new level in the evolutionary film making art.",1469923200,,3618,4.940789473684211

7904131,5,B000006D2K,"After watching about 30 minutes of this film I began thinking about turning it off...the characters were really putting me off.  But then I realized that this is only a movie, and on top of it ----a French one.  There was time in my life when I watched a lot of French productions, one might even say I watched exclusively French films produced during the second half of the 20th century.  Loulou (1980) by Maurice Pialat (a French film maker who surely deserves more international recognition) starting the French stars Gerard Depardieu and Isabelle Huppert is one might say a very typical French love story.  Depardieu plays the title role of Loulou (affectionately short for Louis) a young ex-convict just released from prison, most likely for stealing which can be inferred during one scene where he and his pals steal boxes of gramophones from a warehouse.  Loulou is your typical/ordinary low-life who sleeps all day long, drinks all night long with his buddies and picks up women for one night stands.  A man without perspectives nor ambition, a criminal.  He represents the lowest strata of society.  Isabelle Huppert is Nelly, a wife of a well prospering business man.  She lives with her husband in a nice apartment with a maid service, yet she is very unhappy in her marriage, and her husband Andre is very jealous and madly in love with her.  One night Nelly while on a night out with her girlfriend runs into Loulou in a local Parisian disco.  They began an affair, and Andre is having a difficult time accepting his wives' behavior.  This is where the French culture and their concept of sex, loyalty, and ideals comes in.  This film, and there are many other French films just like that, beautifully demonstrates how the French perceive adultery and love.  There are some scenes in this film that will make you shake your head in disbelief, or might even make you question yourself on how would you behave in similar situation.

One scene for instance, has Nelly and Loulou sitting in a diner when Andre comes in.  Nelly and Andre go outside to address the whole situation (separation and finical issues) and she goes inside Andre's car.  They begin arguing and Andre explodes and begins hitting her, as she runs away from him Andre follows her into a courtyard.  Loulou follows them from the diner and stops Andre from pounding on Nelly, the two scuffle and push each other, but the funny thing is that none of them throw any real punches at one another, they fight in unmanly fashion.  Finally, an old woman breaks up the whole scene accusing both men for breaking her mailbox.  As the three exit the courtyard into the street, Andre calls on Loulou to talk to him in private.  The two men exchange some words in secret and all of a sudden they go back inside the diner (all three) and Andre buys a round of beer for all three of them and they begin drinking and talking as if nothing happened.

Something interesting that I noticed while watching this film is that all men in it are dressed in leather jackets, with exception for maybe one hippie guy.  They also sport long and unkempt hair and mustaches (I guess early 1980's fashion).  Women are all dressed in fur coats or pea coats.

The movie shocks and provokes...and what I most like about Pialat's films are his ending scenes.  There is not much to them, they end as they begin.

If you like this one, I recommend seeing his other films, such as: We Won't Grow Old Together (1972), To Our Loves (1983), and Police (1985).",1414886400,4,3497,4.64390243902439
7904132,3,B000006D2K,"That's a better title than the one they went with, which refers to the character played by Depardieu, because the film is about Huppert's character, who is 25 in this film and already an accomplished actress.

This film, like most dramatic films (and even some comedies), is about poor choices and their consequences.  Nelly clearly made a bad decision marrying Andre, a boring, jealous, possessive jerk who overreacts and becomes violent when she so much as looks at other men.  Andre may or may not love Nelly but he clearly has no clue what she needs or how she wants to be loved.

Small wonder that Nelly is fed up and dumps Andre.  But for womanizing bad boy Loulou, just our of prison, with no visible means of support, and still involved in silly heists with his criminal pals?  Hmmmm ...

But wait!  It gets better ... um ... worse: Loulou gets Nelly pregnant.  Apparently, both missed the class in high school where they tell you about safe sex, or just plain don't care.  What happens to the pregnancy is predictable after Nelly visits Loulou's family and realizes this ""package deal"" is not an improvement over life with Andre -- though I would say the film understates the effect of the abortion on Nelly.  There is no happy ending; quite the contrary, we are left with the clear impression Nelly's life will be, as Hobbes says, ""nasty, brutish, and short.""  What is a woman to do?  Yes, indeed.

A brief word about the subtitles: They are bare bones; not wrong, mind you, just leave out subtleties that would have added context to the story.",1254009600,,1554,4.624087591240876

7904134,3,B000006D2K,"This 1980 French film is a fairly dreary, depressing, anti-romantic character study, featuring Isabelle Huppert as a restless young woman who ditches her boring, tempramental boyfriend for a wild, leather-clad bad boy (played by an incandescent, youthful Gerard Depardieu). The films inches forth through one mildly unsettling scenario to another; the cumulative effect of which is something close to spiritual nausea.  It's supposed to be that way, though: this film is very much a precursor to the downcast realism of the 1990s ""dogme"" scene, skillfully made, but definitely a downer.  However, Depardieu is particularly magnetic in this early role... worth it to see him in his prime!",1073433600,7,687,5.411214953271028
