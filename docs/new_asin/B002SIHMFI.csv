I bought this as a Christmas gift and he was overjoyed to watch all the episodes he remembered as a family. To our surprise,  it was only 2-3 episodes!! Total disappointment! Especially for this price! Returning in hopes to get him the real deal.",1515196800,,336,4.419354838709677
8379403,5,B002SIHMFI,"Oh yes, my son is completely sucked into the show once he starts to hear the wicked theme song. He is amazed that the rewind button on his remote actually works if you know what I mean.",1308096000,,185,4.027027027027027
8379404,5,B002SIHMFI,"I am a father of 1 boy who is 2 years of age, he watches this show non stop off of our DVR from the Nick Jr channel, I think these guys are great at what they do and it gives kids an opportunity to let their minds free and play along, My son is in totall LaLaa Land when this show comes on, its great to see him smile and laugh and have fun while he copies these guys, Funny show to me and Im starting to like it myself lol,

I reallly wish and hope they make this DVD Avalible to U.S. Citizens! I been looking high and low for a dvd copy made to play on U.S. Dvd players but no luck yet.",1286496000,4,588,3.6666666666666665
8379405,5,B002SIHMFI,"Hilarious duo, interesting characters.  I love that they make the kids use their imaginations, especially with the ""remote"".  My daughter will be turning 3 soon and this is one of her all-time favorite shows, right up there with Dora!  She giggles at their antics, uses her remote at appropriate times making cute sound effects, and dances.  She also learned about birthday parties and ""Surprise!"" from one of their episodes and loves to pretend she's throwing surprise parties.  She loves being silly and this show is super silly, but educational as well.

When I first saw the show, I found it fairly odd, but it got a few giggles out of me so I let my daughter watch it and now she asks for it all the time...

I wish these were available on DVD here in the USA!  I will be keeping my eye out and hoping for it soon!  Maybe by the time they get a full season on one DVD, they'll have it here in the U.S.",1285804800,4,906,4.313609467455621
8379406,5,B002SIHMFI,"I'm a mom of three active boys. This keeps my sons attention. They use their imagination on this show by making funny noises and characters such as Action-Fingers. I wish that they would create a dvd that US. citizens could enjoy also. I am a teacher and this is for toddlers and up.
blessings,
Mom of 3",1258502400,6,303,4.333333333333333
