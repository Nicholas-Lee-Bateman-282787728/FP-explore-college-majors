7804698,5,6300184781,"I remember seeing this back in 1985 when TV networks still gave a damn and paid money for good scripts and highly intriging plot lines.  The story remains true to the initial novel and is a real surprise.  Telly is Telly with his propensity to overact a little when he is doing Kojak, but Kojak is like Archie Bunker.  You either like him or hate him, no in between. I happen to like his portrayal and Max Von Sydow and the German actor playing the villian is priceless.  Back in the 80s it probably had more of shock effect, realizing the US government could be in on a collaberation scheme, however its pretty mild by today's Washington shenanigans.  If you like good acting, and good story lines this is a good investment, just wish it was on Disc.",1360281600,2,751,4.413043478260869

7804700,5,6300184781,"This was a Kojak come back type of TV movie that was a hit when it came out.  It was replayed for a few years, and I may have watched every time I knew it was on.  There were so many dynamics to the movie, surprising to me that it has not become digitized by someone who is a Kojak fanatic.  I liked Kojak, but this film was very well done, Jewish immigrants and White Russian immigrants finding each other in NYC.  I reminded me a little of the Marathon Man, but with a twist, and this was from the same time period when the movie was actually made.  Suzanne Pleshett is just great getting involved with Theo Kojak and Telly's response was excellent.  For Kojak, this was one very deep investigation and it reminds me of how shows like CSI and others go through the crime solving process yet without the body parts.

Definately worth it if you have a VHS.  I have been looking for this movie all over the place and it is here now posted on Amazon through the above seller.  Get this video and ask someone to digitize it.",1298764800,3,1021,4.221649484536083
7804701,4,6300184781,"A great story!  Kojak investigates a series of recent killings that involve Russian Jews that worked with the Germans 40 years earlier to help imprison Jews in Hitler's concentration camps.  Kojak is tied closely to  the case by friends that are in the middle of the case.  Susan Pleshette  gives a great performance as Kojak's unofficial assistant and possible love  interest. Max Von Sydow is, as always, great.",939945600,10,413,5.0
