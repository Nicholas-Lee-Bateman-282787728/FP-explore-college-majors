There must be alot of room left on this disk that the authors could have presented us with a caucophony of visual delights! (Besides the few videos used for the testing!) This disk does show what our TV systems are capable of, but unfortunately, after viewing the video presentations on this disk, we will now be spoiled, but have to live with the real life garbage that is presented to us in our normal, every day crappy viewing! Disk 3.0 - please reflect on my above suggestion and spoil the heck out of us with at least a half hour of mind numbing, out of this world, blow you away video wonders!
Definitely, don't think of using this DVD for calibration purposes, more like an after supper video teaser showing off what you managed to calibrate using your normal methods. Hopefully, not showing you got a bum deal on your set!
Glad I purchased off Amazon website, because if I'd paid the $90 that HQV wanted to ship this to Canada, I would have written this up as a ripoff for that amount of money!
Please note: for some reason or other, HQV has the disc coming out of the Bottom of it's container.",1296691200,4,1258,4.473913043478261
8389115,4,B0035LGEGK,"All in all a pretty good disk. It may be a five star for someone who is a tech head but I am not and I know most people out here are not either. Some sections of the disk are somewhat easy to understand and easy to evaluate your system but some areas are a bit more complicated with not enough explanation for the lay person as to what to do or why or what exactly are we looking for, a few extra examples would have been nice.  Keep in mind this is not a ""tweeking"" disk for colour and so on, it is an evaluation disk, it does not really help very much in the setup of your system, ok, it helps a bit but thats not the purpose of this disk. This disk is to evaluate the strengths or shortcomings of your TV display system, and the test images seem to do that pretty well.",1293148800,2,772,3.917197452229299
