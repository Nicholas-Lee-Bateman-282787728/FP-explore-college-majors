5153493,5,B008DVJNCY,"These are mostly entertaining holiday movies and the price is right.  You will get a great mix here with kid-centric movie, Rom-Com, Raunchy comedy, etc.  Fred Claus is really good.  Unaccompanied minors and Just friends are definitely decent.  But, the real draw here is to check out the train wreck that is Cousin Eddie's Xmas vacation.  How else can it be described but:  Horrible?  It's so bad that it's fun to watch.  And who doesn't need more Eddie?

One gripe I do have is about video quality.  Fred Claus is the worst and looks like someone converted a 700MB avi file to dvd format.  Not sure if the normal dvd of it is the same.  Maybe they just used single layer dvd or something.  Each movie also does have it's own disc which is much better than double sided ones (like many of these 4 packs).",1450569600,2,805,4.431506849315069

8527057,4,B008DVJNCY,"They were all basically funny movies. ""Just Friends"" is a favorite of mine during the holiday season,  and ""Fred Claus"" is a close second. The other two movies were okay for a chuckle. The price was right , it put people in the holiday spirit and it made for fun family viewing on a cold night.",1519084800,,294,4.25
