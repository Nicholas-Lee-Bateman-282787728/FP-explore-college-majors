1211366,1,B00000F4HC,"I have to be honest, we had to turn off the movie after about 15 minutes and didn't watch the entire movie.  Fifteen minutes was long enough to hear nearly every single profanity, including one that was more offensive than others.  Also, there were some visual images that we as parents did not even want to see, much less letting our teenage daughters see them.  I should have known that an 80's movie which was rated PG would not cut it at our house.  Too bad, it looked like it would have been a cute story, and I like that fact that it was based on a true story.",1366156800,4,566,4.165137614678899
1211367,5,B00000F4HC,"If you don't know the story behind the movie, then suffice it today it's a few enterprising and intelligent kids who strive to start a business using the 'waste' left from their dad's ranch.  It's a terrific story and one that I've loved since I was a kid.  I've looked for it and was thrilled that Amazon had it online since it's not on DVD.  Great movie for kids and adults alike!",1359072000,,382,4.277777777777778
1211368,3,B00000F4HC,"This movie is based on a true story. I was the Location Manager for this film and we shot it in Tucson, Arizona. A fun movie, especially for kids. It shows what kids can do when they set their minds to it. Had a great time working on this picture. You will want to watch it over and over.

1211369,5,B00000F4HC,"This was one of my FAVORITE movies when I was a kid.  My sisters and I would watch it over and over again on our BETA video player :-)  It is a fun story about some kids who get in over their heads with a creative business and become an inspiration to kids all over the country.  I would recommend it to any family... or any ""30-something"" that wants a great 80's movie to sit back and enjoy.",1161820800,6,392,4.0

1211420,4,B00000F4HC,"This is a smart funny true life story of the IRS going after siblings who were selling manure and making a good amount of money.  Scotty Swartz puts in a fun performance as the ring leader.
My mother played a lady golfer in the first five minutes, so you know I HAD to see this. But despite Mom's performance here, I loved the film.",1422057600,,332,4.1875
1211421,5,B00000F4HC,I Love this movie I am so glad I found it on here I have a 9 and 4 year old girls that I want to see this movie .  I also have to say to the people  that won't watch because of the bad language well you don't know what you're missing with this movie I am sure that your children have heard much worse I turned out totally fine I'm a dairy farmer who learned a lot from this movie as a child. Only wish there were more kids that want to work hard and not get EVERYTHING given to them this why our world is turning out to be LAZY kids!!!!,1420675200,,536,3.692982456140351

1211423,4,B00000F4HC,"Kids have fought wars and built nations.....So, there's no reason why they can't compete to sell manure, right?....Of course, BEING kids, they don't know all about the ins and outs of the ever expanding laws. This film takes you on a journey of how kids can go toe to toe with the big guys and try to come up smelling like roses. Kids will definitely like this movie. It has the passion that they daydream about almost daily. Oh! And it's fun for adults, as well.",1392508800,,463,4.395348837209302
1211424,5,B00000F4HC,I've seen this movie before and it would not make it to a generic family distributor movie service (of movie DVD'S) just because of the profanities in this movie. However if you can get past the expletives then you can see a movie about a family and a group of kids who turn animal waste into a profitable business. I like a movie that shows how a group of kids can make money before the ubiquitous internet has become a part of everyone's life. I won't give away too many more of the details except it turned into a fun ending just like Walt Disney's Emil and the Detectives.,1387670400,,576,4.293577981651376
