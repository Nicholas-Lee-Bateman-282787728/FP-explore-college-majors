Fire is a spaceborne disaster epic in miniature - a Cylon death squadron breaks through the  Galactica's fighter squadrons and rams the ship at its bridge and into one  of its flight bays.  The shot of the Cylon raider plunging into the flight  bay and slamming belly-first into its heart before exploding is one of the  finest SFX shots ever put to film.  Commander Adama is badly injured and several dozen warriors on leave - including Boomer (Herb Jefferson Jr.) and  Athena (Maren Jensen) - are trapped in the ship's rejuvination  center.

The story revolves around the effort to fight the fire, save  Adama's life, and keep those trapped in the rejuvination center alive.  Director Christian Nyby extracts excellent performances from the entire cast, notably Jefferson, who was always superb but here gets more to work with in terms of screen time and makes the most of it.

The main flaw with the story is not that it is uninspired - true, it is like The Towering Inferno, but it makes sense that such a disaster  would eventually befall the fleet - but that it violates scientific logic at several points.  A SFX highlight is a run by vipers spraying fire-fighting fluid called Boroton into the flaming flight bay, but for a fire to burn in  the flight bay it would have to be sealed off from space - shown later when  Apollo and Starbuck set solonite charges to the hull to open it to the  vacuum of space - so this Boroton run is pointless; if the interior artificial gravity of the Galactica was what was keeping oxygen within the flight bay and thus feeding the fire, this should have been alluded to to make the scene work better.

Much has also been made of the fact that, though she gets far more screen time than usual, Athena is given almost nothing to do.  It would have been better if she had been given more in the way of responsibility - Maximum Press'  1995-97 Galactica stories and Richard Hatch's novels remade her as a major  character, and did so tremendously well - but I've never thought much of Maren Jensen; in The Hand Of God she came across as dazed throughout the  show.

Nonetheless, this is a very enjoyable episode right down to the final seconds before the finale.",932688000,7,2320,4.6048780487804875
