8528556,5,B008IZLNBE,We saw this on a library DVD and thought it was simply the best.  So we bought it for our grandson/history buff for Christmas -- did not quite arrive in time but came the day after he left on holidays up north.  he has just collected it this morning.  I am a bit worried about the Region 2 thing - we probably need 'all regions' here in Australia.  We are hoping his player will be able to run it.  I can recommend Andrew Marr - her is droll and fascinating and richly researched.  He travels to the history sites - photos are superb - and always leaves you with food for thought..  Hope you sell lots more.,1515715200,,607,4.136752136752137
8528557,5,B008IZLNBE,I think that this is a first rate film . That I just wish that I had in my classroom while teaching World History. Mr. Marr is just outstanding as the presenter who get his point across extremely well with never a boring moment!  Major Kudos to all hands involved!,1471305600,,264,4.28
8528558,5,B008IZLNBE,"You can't stream it here and the YouTube versions are probably not copyright, but watch this series anyway. Societies make the same mistakes over and over, and we're making them again now. Think globalization is progress? Western societies didn't abolish slavery, within fifty years they completely outsourced it. Be brave Amazon, buy the rights and put it out Prime.",1462665600,,367,5.237288135593221
