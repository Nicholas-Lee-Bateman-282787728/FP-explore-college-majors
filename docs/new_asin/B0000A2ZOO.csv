7995787,5,B0000A2ZOO,"Kirika and Mirielle are assassins for hire. They'll rub out anyone for enough money. Kirika has anmesia. All she recalls is the skills she has as an assassin. A mafia organization has sanctioned them and sends hitmen to test their skills. What they don't know yet is that they are candidates to take the title of Noir, an ancient team of killers that is feared by the underworld.

Noir is a very stylish anime. The colors and the soundtrack create a very unique mood. The series has a lot of action and plenty of mystery. It's a very cool series. The characters are compelling and keep you wanting to watch more. I definitely think anyone, anime fan or not, can get a lot of enjoyment out of it.",1353974400,,695,4.4296875

7995789,3,B0000A2ZOO,"The fifth volume of Noir opens as Mireille returns to her homeland of Corsica. Once her parents were the heads of the most powerful crime family on the island and ruled it at their pleasure. That is, until they had a falling out with an organization far more powerful than the Mafia, The Soldats. Mireille had to flee the country with her uncle as a child and became an assassin. While trying to find out who killed her parents from old contacts, she might just learn a secret about her parents she doesn't want to know.

 In Episode 18, Mireille is still emotional after learning that her parents were in the Soldats, and were also killed by others in that organization. She takes it out on Kirika, pulling out a gun and telling her to get out of her sight. Kirika wanders aimlessly around Paris and links up with a Soldat operative from whom she learns that there are many factions within the Soldat organization at opposites about the future. Altena, Chloe's mistress is currently trying to bring about the Great Return, whatever that is.

 The last episode is about Mireille's and and Kirika's efforts to track down the source of an ancient manuscipt having to do with the Soldats. Meanwhile, the Soldats themselves decide to put their best knights to the task of not only killing our two heroines but Chloe as well. Kirika will learn that perhaps Chloe is not lying when she says Kirika is one half of the true Noir.

 The series is still interesting but at points devolves into camp. For example, in one gun battle, Kirika shoots a little pinprick hole in a wall, about the size of a pencil lead and is able to see and shoot two gunmen on the other side of it. The animation is also getting a little too sentimental. Mireille looks at Kirika. Close-up of Kirika. Close-up of Mireille. Repeat 4 times for dramatic tension. Another thing that makes it sorta ludicrous is that after all these episodes, Mireille still intends to keep her promise from the first dvd, namely that after all the mysteries are solved about who and why they have been targeted for death, Mireille will kill Kirika. I mean, let it go already, she's your friend! It just seems so stupid because you can tell they care about each other. Hopefully, Noir will not disentegrate into sentimentality and ""I love you, but I have to kill you"" cliches by the last volume.

 Still worth seeing, but the format is getting a little tired. The adventure for 15 minutes then kill someone the last 5 minutes is getting slightly old.

 Skimpy extras include an interview with the Altena Japanese voice actress, production sketches, and clean open/closes.",1090454400,,2617,4.657266811279826
7995790,5,B0000A2ZOO,"Four the previous four volimes (thru episode 16) the story has revolved around the waif-like Kirika and Mirielle a professional assassin of unquestioned skill and beauty.  Mirielle's story was definitely the real focus, if for no other reason than Kirika's past was a blank slate.  As their adventures progressed, they ran afoul of Les Soldats - an ancient criminal organization.  Apparently this was due to Mirielle's choice of an operating name (Noir) and the links between Les Soldats and her Corsican family.
Episode 17, 'Return to Corsica,' brings and end to this phase as Mirielle returns to her ruined ancestral home and is forced to face the truth about her history.  But the real shock is Chloe's revelation about the reality of Noir and the relationship between her and Kirika.  Mirielle return to France finally understanding that she has become the third wheel in a deadly company.
Unable to deal with this Mirielle rejects Kirika and a new phase begins as we finally are treated to some clues about who and what Kirika is.  Warring factions of Les Soldats are fighting for control of the true Noir or, in the absence of that, the death of these young female killers.  Kirika has always been the deadlier of the pair, despite her lost child appearance, and now she must look into her heart to discover her true nature.  Without that knowledge, she and her friend are lost.
Intensity builds as the story becomes increasingly dark.  In the midst of the interplay between the three women and Les Soldats death is a constant companion.  And deadly traps are a way of life.  In the episode 18, 'The Darkess within Me,' Kirika must make a decision that raises as many questions as it answers.  In the next episode more of the truth surfaces, as Kirika and Mirielle draw closer to a book containing the old texts of Les Soldats.  But this triggers another round of deadly deception.
The artwork for this series, which has always been of an extraordinarily high level deepens in color to match the mood, shifting from bright sunlight to evening tones.  And what started as the story of two killers, has become a major tale of suspense.  In the end, Kirika is terrified at what the return of her memories might bring to her, unsure of what will become of her relationship with Mirielle.",1062028800,10,2289,4.7594936708860756
7995791,5,B0000A2ZOO,"This series just keeps getting better the deeper it goes.  For me, Noir got off to a slow start with an assassination-of-the-week type of feel that was saved by the sheer atmosphere of the work...a blending of music, lush visuals, intriguing characters and mystery.  The power of Noir is its masterful, minimal storytelling, where each spoken word counts for so much, and each of the main characters' reactions is allowed to linger long enough for the viewer to absorb it and truly feel it. There is a tenuous, understated bond between Kirika and Mirielle that's both sweet and sad. In this 5th DVD, we learn more about the ghosts that haunt our heroines.  One driven by an obsessive need for revenge, the other for a desperate need for redemption, in this DVD the chasm between them widens. The final line uttered by Kirika at the end of the last episode on the disk is a heart-breaker.",1060905600,6,887,4.673076923076923
