5924177,5,B00EK52XQK,"This series by Oliver Stone was certainly an eye opener for me. Watch it and you will see why for yourself. I would like to have embedded footnotes/references (which I would imagine would be present in the book), because if this viewpoint of American history is even close to accurate, then we have a lot of self-examination to do as a nation and people (I would say that is a given really even if this film has faulty information). The score, historical footage and sound clips make for edge of your seat entertainment in a history lesson! I agree with the previous reviewer who stated that this should be required viewing (I don't think that would happen for obvious reasons) even if it is to learn a lesson in critical thinking and evaluation of a controversial viewpoint.

If you enjoy this documentary and want more on similar shocking history lessons, I highly recommend Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (to me it is absolutely required reading for all Americans and would be beneficial for all members of humanity).

Enjoy and Peace!",1380412800,37,1049,4.726775956284153
5924178,5,B00EK52XQK,"Ever wondered why history in school was so boring and clich&eacute; with memorization of dates to be regurgitated on tests? Always the who, what, where but a less than honest or incomplete why? It is really no wonder why much of the world cannot understand why much of the American people really don't know the macro picture of what is going on (past and present). Most TV news media coverage, insight and commentary borders on laughable magazine show coverage. If that is how you inform your self, rise above the white noise and get this DVD set. One must know the true realities of the past to connect the dots to the realities of the present. The tiny number of news corporations that control your TV information input will not assist you in this endeavor.

As this information is quite dense, I highly recommended that you purchase the book also. Reading the book and following the DVD series helps with the mental organization and memory reinforcement. However, the book time line starts out in late 1800s and the DVD series starts out in the late 1920s great depression. The book also covers the widespread general American anger towards post WW1 war industry profiteering and Wall Street excesses that took place (surprise!) just before the great depression. The book is also heavily footnoted for further research or fact checking if desired.

As an avid reader from many sources, I attempt to form objective opinion based on facts. Many of the facts presented in this book and DVD series have caused me to largely re evaluate my thoughts on the FDR administration, the real reason for the double atomic bombing of Japan, the Truman Administration and the real root cause of Cold War with the Soviets. If you believe Ronald Regan  should get the majority of the credit for bringing the Cold War to an end - see this and your opinion might change.

Recently released, the book and DVD series continue up to the present administration, times and conflicts. The pace of the DVD series seems almost slow at the beginning...not unlike a roller coaster climbing the tallest point. At the top (IMO),the Kennedy assassination. Then the fast paced roller coaster ride begins....and continues at an ever increasing speed today. In normal life, as events happen, they speed by and are replaced so quickly - resulting in nothing but a numbing blur. News papers are vanishing, daily TV analysis is so poor and internet analysis is so unreliable, that it takes a book and DVD series such as this, some developed critical thinking and reflection to process important events. Many contemporary surprises await viewers and readers - to remember important details that you either never knew, or had forgotten. These important details are the bits of information that connect smaller to larger events and form a more complete overall analysis.

Oliver Stone fans: you will notice bits of musical scores of his other fine works inserted appropriately along with his narration. If you haven't already, visit Oliver Stones Wiki page and you will understand this filmmaker's background and political views much better.

As this series exposes our past and present ever growing Military Industrial Complex, it must be viewed objectively and with a truly open mind. You will find yourself either enlightened and/or  possibly angry after viewing (see 1 star reviews). Much of this information is of a disquieting nature. But if you honestly seek truth, you will view this series more than once. I am now the second time through the book and the DVD series. There are a few points made of which you might disagree. I did and you are free to do the same. In really old western movies, the good guys and the bad guys are easily identified by the color of their hats. The bad guys (black hats) were 100% bad and the good guys (white hats) 100% good - if the real world was only that simple. In reality, the world seldom operates in terms of true absolutes. Its the details that determine the actual shade of grey.

Unfortunately, this is nothing but historical film footage providing the backdrop for a typical leftist fantasy script wherein Stone's voice drones on and on, taking left turns at every event.  Originally purchased as a gift for my grown son, he and his family will not be getting this vid. I'm very upset at having paid $39 for fake history. But I am grateful to God that I decided to open and view a little of it. Giving it to family members would have been the much bigger mistake.

His portrayal of the US as the bad guy in WW2 is beyond absurd. His portrayal of Stalin as a guy who was just looking out for his country's best interest is horrifying and absurd. Luckily I watched this when my Ukrainian spouse was not present. This guy was a strong supporter of Chavez and company and he seems to have a talent for justifying the behavior of murderous leftist tyrants. Difference is now that the country is becoming polarized, people like Oliver Stone, Donald Trump, Sean Spicer, etc are getting larger audiences of people looking to reinforce an extreme world view.  People will always have different interpretation of history and that's fine, what's wrong is when you cherry pick specific events and twist them to portray a preconceived world view.

His concludes that only if Reagan had signed a deal with Gorbachev that we could have eliminated all nuclear weapons.  This is an absurd notion.  Russian and the US are not the only two countries having nuclear weapons.  Even if we didn't need them to deter Russia, we would need them to deter China, Pakistan and a half a dozen other countries.  His criticism of Reagan is way overstated and he never supports that criticism with enough evidence to back it up.

UPDATE:
I have read many of the reviews and there seems to be consensus that the series is without a doubt biased.  So, that begs the question, if someone is determining that the series is biases then why are the same people rating it 4-5 stars?

Sadly, some of this is true and America does need to pull out of the world but this claim of America being a bad guy clearly ignores history.  If America was as Satanic as MIchael Moore, Noam Chomsky and Oliver Stone (and the Hollywood left) wouldn't exist. They would have been silenced.  America could have either stayed out of world war 2 or allied themselves with Hitler to invade Mexico and Canada but the US didn't.  He champions Stalin and the Soviet Union by a.) minimizing Stalin's crime (he does the exact same thing with Pol Pot) and b.) actually says that the USSR won WW2 when in fact, they would have lost to Germany had it not been for the US supplies.  Back to Pol Pot, he blames the US involvement in Vietnam (which I agree with him on that) but then blames that on Pol Pot and the Killing Fields.  There was already a communist revolution happening in Cambodia so Pol Pot would have committed genocide whether the US was involved or not.  The left always damns America.  If we did have war with Cambodia to stop the killing fields, then we would have been warring.  When we didn't in Rwanda, it was because they were black and didn't matter.  The core foundation of the left in America is to always blame America and capitalism while benefitting from America and capitalism.  Is anyone stupid enough to think that Russia, China, Cuba, etc. would ever have had a Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore and Oliver Stone writing books and making films that constantly condemn their own countries?  No way.  Not even Canada does.  Canada also stole land from Natives and destroyed their culture but no leftist will ever mention that let alone the horrible crimes of communism.

  Debs was arrested and jailed for making these statements as acts of Congress suspended Freedom of Speech. And so President Wilson addressed Congress requesting war ""to keep the world safe for democracy.
  Thus World War I, or The War To End All Wars.

Oliver Stone's ""The Untold History of the United States"" is a 12 part in depth documentary of the past 120 years. He reveals details that have never been printed in our text books and backs them up with Newsreels, recorded speeches, and first hand witnesses.
  There is so much here but the most powerful message is that every war since The Spanish American War has been for the benefit of Wall Street. J.P. Morgan, by the end of WWI was owed by Britain , the equivalent of 61 Billion Dollars. He was one of many who benefited financially: John D. Rockefeller, William Randolph Hearst, many.
  The documentary takes us through every year and event of the 20th Century. We are shown a side to Harry Truman and The Manhattan project here-to-fore hidden. We're shown that The United States was the instigator of The Cold War, inspired by a lie filled speech delivered by Winston Churchill from the United States where he coined the term ""Iron Curtain"" long before there was one. The US placement of nuclear missiles along Soviet Borders frightened them to build their own. The Berlin Wall was our fault. Ethel Rosenberg was executed as a means of manipulating her husband. Korea. Vietnam. American War Crimes that make the Nazi's pale in comparison.
  We hear the truth about Nixon. Then Reagan, who was far from the great man we are told. Each subsequent President's truth is shocking, including Obama who allowed the illegal surveillance of millions of Americans while chastising the ""whistleblowers"" but not the criminals.
  This is an important work and one we must all see as it continues: it is not just the citizens of third world countries who have been used; it is most of the Citizens of The United States through the manipulation of our ""free press.""
  Oliver Stone is lauded as one of our greatest feature film creators. He begins this work, produced by Showtime, with a narrative of why he made a documentary and not a feature film: A feature film is entertainment to tell a human story. This is truth not taught in classrooms and largely ignored by history. This must be a documentary because you must not question the difference between art and fact.

I was very happy to find I was incorrect. At the end of episode 7 I'm convinced Mr. Stone is in fact a documentarist. A real one. I give him 5 stars for that.

For once someone, Oliver Stone in this case, is serving the foreign policy highlights of American history without a thick coating of ideology, ""us vs them"", good guys vs bad guys type of kindergarten presentation. Stone lays out the story of America in the 20th century that few Americans are willing to admit: absolutely unscrupulous, ruthless, hypocritical divide-and-conquer policies that have ruined the lives of millions, and while achieving some short term goals inevitably lead to bigger and worse problems down the line. The counterargument, and possibly how the policy-makers justify their actions to themselves, could of course be that the world around America is in bad shape anyhow, so let's profit.. but since the masses need to feel good, let's keep telling them stories of how they are always the ""good guys"" who are saving everybody from Communism, Nazism, poverty, Islamism, etc.",1483142400,6,1196,5.164948453608248

Which makes me suspect that untold is, at best, an exaggeration.

This vision of history has been told and retold, multiple times. It is the prevailing vision espoused by Hollywood, the mainstream media and the academia. Its basically the only thing that is told.

Oliver Stone himself has told it in at least 5 or 6 movies. And he was hardly the only one. He was arguably the most fanatical of the big names in Hollywood ( Michael Moore is not a big shot ), but he was on the side of the majority of the cultural elites, at least since the sixties.

I like Oliver Stone movies. I don't rely on him to do my thinking for me, and I think no one does. Maybe the anti-Trump women studies moron.

This show, at least the first few episodes, were quite entertaining. Well produced, nice footage and edition. The Oliver Stone narration is ok, not particularly inspired. Overall I enjoyed it.

5924293,1,B00EK52XQK,"First let's establish that Oliver Stone is a student of history.  Second, Mr. Stone is a very accomplished storyteller.  And there is the problem.  Mr. Stone is unable to provide a myopic examination of history without adding his own story and opinions into it.

This ""documentary"" is given completely with Oliver Stone narrating.  Ten hours of Oliver Stone narrating with little to absolutely NO supporting evidence to support the opinions Mr. Stone is entering as facts.  Throughout the ten hours of opinionated storytelling Mr. Stone uses the phrase, ""In reality..."", however, Mr. Stone never really states whose reality he is stating.  Fortunately for the discerning viewer this isn't hard to figure out.

I do not know Mr. Stone's political leanings; however, based on his storytelling in these ten hours I would speculate that Mr. Stone leans towards Communism.  At times I was left with the impression that Mr. Stone even had no use for the lighter Socialism.  He champions Soviet Russia throughout the story constantly portraying the USSR has a victim to the United States.  While I am under no illusion that the US has always been ""clean"" in it's dealings neither am I under the illusion that the USSR was a helpless victim.

Further, Mr. Stone seems to be completely obsessed with Vietnam.  In fact throughout over half of the series Vietnam seems to be the primary subject matter.  Mr. Stone goes as far to brand the Presidencies of Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford has failures.  In fact most historians would only label Nixon's presidency a failure from that list; and even then, there is some strong disagreements.

About the only thing I can see as a positive out of this ""documentary"" it is that Mr. Stone is equally critical of Democratic and Republican administrations.  However, this only really reinforces my view that Mr. Stone's biases are outside those of most educated Americans.

In short, this should not be viewed as anything more than a ten hour story by Oliver Stone displaying his own bias and narrow view of U.S. history.  Mr. Stone offers absolutely no supporting evidence for the positions he sets forth in his stories.  Without evidence this should be viewed nothing more than opinion.",1481587200,2,2220,4.980978260869565

5924296,4,B00EK52XQK,"I am most of the way through this series, discovered on Netflix. I welcome historical honesty and am prepared for hard-to-swallow truths about the USA's foreign policy. But about half way through, I was actually getting nauseated at Stone's representation of the USA's behavior around the world. I began to wonder: Is my sense of the history that I learned in my lifetime so embedded in my thinking that the ""truth"" is so upsetting to make me ill? I could not help but perceive more and more bias against the USA in world events. I realized that the authors did have an agenda with this version of history, just as the authors of the textbooks I learned from in school did. I was very disappointed to realize this. Is there no one who can represent what is known of history without adding their own agenda? But I am grateful for this effort by the authors to put it out there that there are many things our country needs to be called to account for.
UPDATE: Dec 16 2016
I finished this series, and there was nothing to change my previous impressions.

5924303,3,B00EK52XQK,"I'm used to reading the depressing books most Americans refuse to read, so I entered this ""project"" with quite a bit of enthusiasm.  Sadly, by the end, I was more worn out than informed.  A lot of folks will look at Europe's long history of war, or the spectacle of Hitler's war crimes, then look back at a decidedly rosy history of America and decide, on a rule of scale, that the US is nothing like Europe and can't even be compared to Hitler.  As I speak, big poo bahs in DC are arguing that Russia hasn't the moral authority to be compared to the US.  Still, while America's history is far darker than most would consider (our genocidal westward expansion alone inspired Hitler, no less) this film is all black and no white;  all sorrow and no cheer;  a summer of rain.  There's a way to convey that our history isn't what we were told, and to do it in a way that energizes one to press forward and learn more;  this is not the way.

Clearly, most of the 'Mericans who need to see this won't, but most people aren't going to have the drive to sit through it all.

And then, the agenda.  Everyone has an agenda, no telling of history is without a skewed perspective.  The original Showtime presentation was chronological, beginning at the turn of the Century, through Wilson and WW1, then onward.  Here, the story begins with WW2, heads towards the current time period, then circles back for the first two episodes beginning at 1901.  Stalin's 1930-1940 murder spree that began with Ukrainian peasants, spread to ethnic Poles, and went on and on, and on;  is not ignored, but for most of the show the USSR is portrayed as a largely peaceful empire befuddled by the raging mania of a crazed USofA.  Of course, the US is acting increasingly bizarre towards the USSR and by the time it overthrows Mossadeq's regime in 1952, has lost sight of the goal and what it is fighting for, but still...  The Kaiser gets his due but no mention is made of the Sealed Train the Kaiser sent into Czarist Russia, loaded with Bolsheviks, printing presses and gold;  WW1's version of the US sending a bunch of jihadi's (including Osama Bin Laden) into Afghanistan---it worked so well on both counts, until it came back to haunt the Berlin,  and then Washington.

This documentary does quite well at illustrating how US foreign policy has never been about Liberty and Democracy.  From the beginning of this series to the end of WW2, the US military goes forth again and again, and again, to, as General Butler observed, make countries ""right"" for US business and industry.  The goal changes somewhat after WW2 when, with eyes bedazzled by the idea of Empire, and a crazed anti-communist world view, Washington's war on communism and the USSR becomes increasingly personal.  It's not very long after VJ Day that Washington seems to leave the bankers and businessmen behind to obsessively go after communism in what devolves into a manic game of whack-a-mole, where anything that jumps up is bad, although even then DC can't seem to tell the difference  .

Clearly, Oliver Stone has his own idea of history, we saw that from his conspiracy laced movies.  This cat isn't going to change his spots, so the viewer has to go in expecting Oliver Stone's idea of the Truth (post election, I wouldn't go so far to say that Stone is presenting ""alternative facts"" however, just a lot of gloom and no hope).

This documentary tells you more than you'll ever want to know, and along the way (if you're still awake) you'll get lots of little details, such as the state of banks in Imperial Britain, in 1914; and how the US loaned money to Berlin, in the twenties, so it could pay reparations to Britain and France, so they could pay their loans to the House of Morgan et al.  Informative isn't this documentary's problem;  the problem is that the story is told so darkly, painting a landscape so bleak and cynical, that the viewer is left overwhelmed and defeated, not energized or seeking more.  The point of these sorts of ventures, to my way of thinking, is to inform and motivate the viewer to dive in and discover even greater depths, and the truths that lie hidden there.  To that end this dismal historical feature does not succeed.",1480809600,,4208,4.600536193029491

Yes, he reveals some of the whitewashed half-truths that have been sold to the American public. But in the end this series is a vehicle for Stone to attempt to lay all the wrongs and atrocities committed by our country at the feet of conservatives alone. Just the opening line of episode 8 was enough to make my stomach turn. Therein he attributes the failure of Vietnam to conservatives when in earlier episodes he clearly explains that the beginning and escalation of the Vietnam conflict happened under JFK and LBJ, both Democrats, long before Nixon took the reigns. The most turbulent and divided our nation had been since the Civil War (the 60's) was while it was led by Democrats, Mr. Stone. Never forget that.

Bully for the idea, as history is regularly shaded by the powers that be, but Oliver Stone is a paranoid and conspiracist, and very left.  His lauding of Stalin, in particular, is a crime.  Yes, the Soviet people deserve praise for their defense and fight against Germany at a terrible cost, but Stone turns him into a hero without showing his evils....nearly as terrible as Hitlers.  Still, interesting so far to watch his perspective, so I can't give it only one star.  Like all of his movies, watch and enjoy, but with a healthy skepticism.",1479859200,3,728,4.569230769230769

5924320,5,B00EK52XQK,"First off:  this is the very definition of ""must see tv"".  Subhead:  this is not easy  tv to watch.  There are many really thoughtful reviews here, so I will stick to my ""top line"" experience.  I consider myself well ""educated"".  I mean I am an all but dissertation PhD in Architectural History!  But:  this is not the history I learned in 6th grade, not in 10th grade, not at Columbia, and not at UC Berkeley.  I've taken to asking very educated friends, who was Henry Wallace?  The most knowledgeable say...wasn't he a communist who ran for president?  Most look blankly.  And that is how this show starts: with footage that shows exactly how Henry Wallace, one of FDR's most trusted advisers, architect of the New Deal, his VP, was removed by party bosses in 1944 because he had made enemies with hard line anti communists, racial segregationists, and big business war machine interests.  And you will see with your own eyes that just seven seconds separated us from a very different present.  That is what makes this must see, gripping tv.  History shown via film and newsreel, stitched together no doubt with a point of view, but very much free from heavy handed pedagogy.  So why 4 stars?  Well, there is the droning monotone narrator voice that is just so much like those tedious films we used to watch in history class.  There is the narrative arc that loops back on itself at times, making chronology confusing.  There are so many things that simply make you go....hmmm.  Need to know more.  Need to check in on that.

No doubt there will be many who only want the story they were told back in high school or college history and will not accept anything different or in addition to what we were always told by our teachers and professors.  Of course I still believe there is so many more stories to our history, but for one reason or another, cannot or will not be allowed to be told to the general public.  Too many secrets that would probably destroy our perception of our country, which is probably why Operation Mockingbird was created by the CIA over 60 years ago.  Our government needed a way to control and manipulate the mass media with propaganda, which continues to this day.  Evidently, freedom of the press also means freedom to deceive us if our government chooses to do so, no matter which party is in control.

5924362,5,B00EK52XQK,"This is a professionally produced documentary about Bush and Obama's war on terror.  The facts do not lie: both are warmongers.

Bush started it on false pretenses. For example, it's interesting to note that the 9-11 hijackers were not Afghanis; they were Saudis. The UN inspectors never found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. By all accounts Bush is a war criminal who is responsible for the deaths of millions of people and the inhumane torture of enemy combatants.

In my opinion, the section on Obama was not as critical as Bush's. Obama continued Bush's war on terror and the spy state policy. Obama bent over backwards for increased troop involvement. The documentary does point out Obama's inexperience, which Obama compensates for by surrounding himself with hawkish hardliners (i.e. Clinton).

I felt like the director should have pointed out Obama's refusal to prosecute the bankers responsible for the 2008 financial crisis. For an administration that ran on the campaign of transparency, this is one of the blemishes that should taint Obama's legacy.

I understand this documentary was made in 2012 and the central theme is the war on terror. However, there were other scandals that surrounded the Obama administration, such as Fast and Furious, the Iran nuclear deal, Benghazi, the Gulf oil spill, etc. If you look at the past 16 years, the US desperately needs to get its act together.",1462665600,,1403,5.0562770562770565

I have great respect for Oliver Stone, He served in Vietnam and as far as I'm concerned he's earned the right to say whatever he wants about his government.

Stone clearly shows how the USA became a super power and has been a driving force in gobal instability and agression. Though I believe that the reasons why are perhaps to some degree deeper than presented and certainly go back at least to the first world war, the case presented is fair and avoids demonizing any individuals motives.

There is not talk about the struggles of thought between the colonial public, who demanded a Bill of Rights, and the bullying of the merchant class. There is a great depth of history ignored there. There is no mention of Gen. Smedley Butler who single-handedly stopped Wall Street's attempted coup d'eta against FDR. It also ignores the history of Wall Street's Economic hitmen financed by the CIA through various businesses as described by John Perkins in his book: ""Memoirs of an Economic Hitman"".
It also ignores the use of propaganda within the U.S. against the American public by Wall Street, advertisers and the CIA.
A more thorough understanding can be found in: ""A Peoples History of the United States"", and Propaganda by Edward Bernays. Noam Chomsky is another good source.
Disjointed and somewhat uneven, though a great starting point for most who only have a traditional whitewashed version of history.",1452297600,2,1097,5.094444444444444
5924387,3,B00EK52XQK,"This film series is very thought provoking and insightful. However, I find some of the glaring omissions to be disingenuous and precisely what Stone claims to be combating which is sanitized history. An example of this is Episode A's depiction leading up to the U.S.'s involvement in World War I. Instead of providing the viewer with all the facts, which are sufficient by themselves to persuade most that getting into World War I was a fools errand, he fails to mention pertinent information about things like the Zimmerman Telegraph. This leaves viewers to conclude that the aims behind getting into WWI were imperialism and market driven, which is only part of the story, Another example is the films treatment of the Soviet Union and Stalin in particular. Yes, the U.S. was in many instances the aggressor in the build up to the Cold War but, the film omits imperialistic and aggressive rhetoric and posturing made by Stalin after the war. This movie seems to indicate that the U.S. opposed the USSR simply because there was something in it for us and we were scared and hyper-reactionary. There is truth to this, but again it fails to recognize the opposition to Stalin being based on the horrific and inhuman treatment of those who were under the control of Stalin (For instance, 20-40 Million were starved to death in Ukraine and elsewhere and Soviet communism was imperialistic). Finally, Stone's love affair with Henry Wallace is another source of half truths. Again, Wallace did get the shaft by the Democrats in the semi-brokered convention of 1944 however, the film makes it out that Wallace was a shue-in and the party bosses conspired against him. While it is true that not loved by the party bosses, as a self-described and outspoken socialist (which ironically he actually wasn't, he was as Social Democrat), he had become a liability to Roosevelt and the party and was not near as popular as the film depicts Again, the film attempts to depict a conspiracy by elites to rig the election and put an incompetent puppet in the (Truman) VP's spot to replace the ailing Roosevelt. Like a lot of things in this book, there is a lot of truth, but it omits a lot of context that would have made the viewer more informed.",1451692800,3,2229,4.77720207253886

Totally left leaning, fraught with incorrect history as in an early episode Stone shows Harry Truman as the one signing the order to inter Japanese Americans as if to say it was Truman's idea. Truman wasn't even VP till 1945 and FDR's own EO 9066 (1942) alone was responsible for the internment of the West Coast Japanese Americans.  This is but one of tons of glaring lies or attempts to mislead.  Stone tends to make a bit of a hero of Stalin and lauds Henry Wallace, who at best, wore every political suit in DC from Dem to Rep to Progressive but was a communist by waddle and quack.

5924404,5,B00EK52XQK,"This film is absolutely outstanding.  Having grownup in the late 1930's  and early 1940's I personally recall many of the events that occurred during the time period  that this film covers. I am astounded by the circumstances and events that were kept from the American public. I am appalled at  the men we once thought as Heroes.  Men, we were taught to believe in and who we thought  always had the best interest of our country at heart.  As a retired Military Man I am aware of the fact that there are many events, situations and circumstances  that go on both in the military and political circles that are just not prudent to put before the public, but this film revealed things and events committed by those whom we were to believe in and in whom we were to put our trust  that were simply criminal.  I found that there were individuals that I once held in high regard turned out to be unworthy of the positions they were permitted to hold and in my opinion were nothing but a disgrace to the positions or stations in life that they were allowed to attain.  It is unfortunate that it took the book and this film to bring out the truth but Thank God it did come to the light of exposure.  It is my opinion that this film and/or the book should be mandatory viewing and/or reading for every high school and college student in this country.
It is sad to learn at this late date of some of the things that were allowed to happen in this great country of ours both politically and militarily but what is even sadder is the fact that there will be those who will choose not to believe it.  It is hard to swallow the old proverb, ""the more things change, the more they stay the same"".  This film is worth viewing again and again, which I have.",1444348800,2,1742,4.32

The DVDs are excellent at codifying the message with constant primary footage, including pop culture references to films and works of literature.  The narrative and analysis largely focuses on US foreign policy in the 20th century, making the Cold War a centerpiece of the series.  In that light, the analysis largely falls into what may be called the 'revisionist' perspective of Cold War.  Thus, this is indeed the 'untold history of the United States,' and I am sure that many US citizens would be shocked to find out that their country has behaved and, in many ways continues to behave, in such a belligerent way.

5924471,2,B00EK52XQK,"Stone definitely flirts with a socialistic perspective in this series.  I love his work on JFK but here he drinks the koolaid of 'a bigger government can do not wrong' flavor and that every president since WWI essentially was a warmonger.  The heroes in his mind are JFK, Gorbachev, Al Gore, and a few others. He blames George W. Bush for not heeding the warning signs of Bin Laden in the months before 9/11 yet forgets that Clinton had nearly 10 chances to kill and/or capture Bin Laden throughout the 1990's. He also demonizes ideas of limited government, not even mentioning the Framers' perspective on government and its' ""enumerated"" powers.  He blindly calls the conservative media an ""empire"" while ignoring blatant media bias in CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, NBC, PBS etc. not to mention the New York Times, NPR. How many Americans can name more than one conservative news network? My guess is probably not too many.

I must say that I like that the series is not status-quo and gives a perspective that many will not be comfortable with.  The documentary is well done and the script is well written.

5924481,5,B00EK52XQK,"If you know me I am one of the biggest history buffs. I love all things history. I read history books continuously. I research history. I love history that deals with historical parts of life that has resulted in an impact that affects the world and American culture. This is a wonderful documentary series that was done for Showtime. Oliver Stone is a pivotal Director that touches on many controversy subjects through some of his greatest films. I am a diehard Oliver Stone fan especially his older work. I love Natural Born Killers, JFK, Nixon, Platoon, and Born on the Fourth of July. Those are brilliant films and he touches upon subjects, historical subjects or present subjects, such as presidents assassination or political ideas or criminal history. Going into this documentary series I was very excited. I was happy specifically because he touches on the history that is not talked about. If you think you know history because of what you are taught in school, trust me you're only taught what they want you to know. This documentary series explores the subjects in a deeper reality, showcasing the cover-ups or the stuff hidden or altered or changed.

Season One Consist of 10 episodes all narrated by Oliver Stone and also co-written by Oliver Stone and directed by Oliver Stone.  If there is one program you ever wish or need to watch, it is this riveting, spectacular, shocking, blunt, piece of cinema that deserves viewing. This should be required viewing in school. This is history. This is real history. This is America's history as it should be taught.

Hamiltonian Democrats protect white collar crooks that disrupted our global economy which was the primary cause of WWII. If Japan had international commerce it would have kept USA out of the war. If the Blue Bloods and pseudo-aristocracy did not let Germany sink so deep in despair then Hitler wouldn't had won over the Germans.

In that worst case scenario, the U.S. will be combating alone the predominant forces of the two extremely strong fighting machines in 1941: Wehrmacht and Imperial Japanese Army (do not compare the mighty German Army in 1941 with the significantly impaired German Army in the middle of 1944 when Allied forces first came to Europe in Normandy).  We do not need to count the Churchills small Britannia  this island will be done in a couple of months after Russians defeat.

5924516,3,B00EK52XQK,"Five stars for the countless film clips that take us back in time and bring those times to life.

One star for the irrational, unyielding bias to the left.

In the first two discs, we are well reminded of the crucial role of the USSR in defeating the Nazis. Also that America had supported too many dictators who declared themselves anti-Communist or were protecting American investments. (Like Batista; as I write this, America has today resumed diplomatic relations with Cuba.) I disagreed with Stone's unabashed adoration of Franklin Roosevelt and his withering scorn for Harry Truman. I think much more of Churchill than Stone does.

But on what I consider the most important issue, Vietnam, I agreed with his view that our involvement was inexplicably misguided, monumentally tragic, and probably racist. (I felt that way when I was drafted in 1967. After a day in reflection, weighing if I should leave for Canada, I concluded that America, even if wrong about Vietnam, was owed my allegiance. It had rescued my parents from the Nazis, it had educated me, it was the bastion of freedom to the rest of the world.)

It was at the start of disc 3 that I finally could not continue watching this series. Stone tells us America has had a long history of right-wing movements. He listed ""the Ku Klux Klan, America First, American Nazi Party ... the Tea Party.""

The Tea Party in the same camp with the KKK, with Nazis?

I've never attended a Tea party meeting. I like some of their ideas, don't like others. But never could I imagine the Tea Party is anything like the KKK or Nazis. How could ANYONE think that? It brings to mind what was said to Joseph McCarthy: ""Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?""

How sad that Stone's political philosophy has so blinded him to reality. (Of course, that's what he, and probably many Amazon readers, are probably saying about me.) His myopia, bordering on obsession, makes this otherwise laudable documentary unreliable and unwatchable.

So 3 stars. Five stars for the marvelous gathering and editing of the film clips, one star for a distorted, biased, unfair interpretation of recent American history.

This could have been a great, required-viewing documentary. Instead it's a mere polemic.",1418774400,3,2279,4.838046272493573

The use of Hollywood movie clips offer an interesting take on how some in Hollywood may have viewed these historical events. The scholarship is also phenomenal.

Every patriotic American should watch this series at least once in his/her lifetime. I would give this five stars if it went into more detail because I believe that there are even more facts that have not been revealed, particularly about three of our most recent Presidents. It is apparent that every Chief Executive since JFK has done what is necessary to keep all the power brokers on Wall Street, at the Pentagon, in Washington, and all across the boardrooms of Big Business in this benighted country happy with the profits that flow from the never-ending war machine. The next President will be no different because she knows how to rook the system already and has never been a friend to ""the people.""",1417478400,6,845,5.042857142857143

5924565,5,B00EK52XQK,"The Untold History of the United States is a 10-episode documentary series that re-examines and investigates important events in American history during the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century. It includes important events such as The Great Depression,World War II,the 50's,JFK assassination,the Vietnam War,Watergate,important events during the terms of from President Carter to the current President Obama.

Oliver Stone and his collaborators did a wonderful job of presenting the documentary series. It was evident that a lot of effort was exerted in it. Added to that,the viewer was definitely given an opportunity to closely examine the under-reported events that have happened especially the conspiracies that have happened during the period it covered. In addition to that,it also tries to examine closely why things happened,how the event after were a result of it and how it could probably affect us later in the future.

Unfortunately,there was also propaganda apart of providing information to the viewers. One could definitely see through Stone with regards to his strong feelings against the United States when it comes to ""policing"" the world and trying to interfere with global affairs. Also,he partly blames the country with regards to the rise of communism and terrorism. Finally,he also feels a lot about the country's complex role in global affairs which resulted into some messy events around the world and how some historical events are somewhat being subtly covered by history books for students not to given careful study about it.

In the end,one has to watch it with an open mind considering that it not only provides information but also opinions on certain events in the country's history.",1410048000,,1734,5.321167883211679

5924573,2,B00EK52XQK,"As a piece of agitprop this 10-part series is first rate.  It looks and feels like something produced by the Soviet Union in the mid-60s.  Ollie and his historical sidekick, Peter Kuznick, have truly gone out of their way to paint the United States as the bad guy, not just in WWII, but everything that followed.

To hear Ollie tell it, we would have been so much better off if Henry Wallace hadn't been purged by FDR in 1940, bringing in the ""haberdasher"" from Independence, Harry S. Truman, who would become president following FDR's death.  Don't feel bad if you don't know who Wallace is.  Most people don't.  Ollie turns the former VP into a martyr for his ideological vision of a progressive America that never was.  By contrast, he paints Truman as a pint-sized thug, little better than Hitler, who would make the Soviet Union into a bitter enemy, something Stone claims Stalin never wanted.

I'm not a big fan of Truman myself, and his NCS-68 did set American foreign policy for the next 60+ years, but he wasn't the pernicious force that Stone claims him to be.  After all, this is the guy who desegregated the military, when FDR wouldn't even sign an anti-lynching bill into law out of fear he would lose the Southern vote.  But, it is American foreign policy that Ollie and Kuz choose to focus on.

Perhaps the most incredible revisionist take is the way Stone presents Stalin.  He is not a tyrant in his mind, but a poorly understood man who was backed into a corner and responded the only way he could given Truman's heinous ""Doctrine,"" which inspired the Cold War.  It doesn't matter that the Red Army had camped itself in Eastern Europe and had no intention of withdrawing.  In Ollie's addled mind, it was the United States that forced Western Europe to denounce Socialism, when it was spreading throughout the continent on its own volition.

Back on the homefront, Wallace tried to stage a comeback in 1948, hoping to bring the same kind of Progressivism Stone imagined was occurring in the Soviet Union, only to garner a paltry 3 per cent of the vote in the national election.  Truman managed to hold onto the White House because (you guessed it) he had cribbed enough of Wallace's progressive agenda to keep wayward Democrats from turning to Wallace or voting Republican.  One thing I have to say is that I was truly surprised Henry Wallace held so much influence in politics.

This forms the groundwork for the shape of things to come.  In Stone's mind it was just one big downer after '48.  Only Kennedy managed to survive his scathing attack somewhat intact.  With so many bad guys, you would think that Obama would have offered at least a glimmer of hope in Stone's mind, but no, Barry is just a more effective military manager as far he is concerned, still pushing the same War on Terror 60 years later.

Every step of the way, Ollie feels that the United States misread events and reacted in all the wrong ways.  Meanwhile, the Soviet Union went through its post-Stalin enlightenment phase (not that it really needed one according to Stone), culminating in Gorbacev's Glasnost and Perestroika, which Ollie sees as another missed opportunity for the United States to make things right in Europe.  According to Stone, Gorby was a victim of events and Eastern Europe is worse off now than it was under the Soviet Union.  I wonder what Eastern Europeans think?  Ollie thinks Gorby was going to make the USSR a kinder, gentler place to live with his new era of Openness and Reconciliation, ignoring the Soviet premier's attempt to quash the Lithuanian uprising in 1991 just as Khrushchev had crushed the Hungarian uprising in 1956.

Granted, Gorbacev was an international celebrity there for awhile until his dream of reconciliation unraveled and all those former Soviet republics had the audacity to seek independence, but the US did everything to prop Gorby up during this troubled time, pumping in massive amounts of aid and refusing to support the breakaway republics as independent countries until well into Clinton's first term.  But, that's not the way Stone and Kuznick want you to read events.  They prefer to hold to their narrative that the US was still fighting Communism, even when it no longer existed.

I really don't get the point of this history lesson.  All this has been presented in one form or another by other revisionist historians, foremost among them Howard Zinn, who made a much more compelling case for his brand of socialist history.  The big bombshell was apparently Truman dropping the Bomb on Japan after it already signaled it would surrender, but what Ollie and Kuz fail to mention is that the emperor still wanted to hold onto his throne, which the Truman administration had said was not part of the deal.  Nevertheless, it was fun to watch as I simply couldn't imagine history told this way except in the old Soviet Union.",1409184000,7,4876,4.759809750297265

Many people want to shut Oliver down or call him names because of his different views.  One thing I think he got right was Stalin.  He was a mean dude but he was the kind of character that was needed to beat Hitler.  Americans fool themselves thinking the USA won the second world war.  The Soviets won the war.  If not for the Russian lives lost (5 times the number of Jews or Polish)  in USSR we would not have USA.  Stalin was all kinds of hard on his people but he was respected by them for saving the world.  The one thing Oliver does not seem to highlight enough is the escalation and magnitude of war's with respect to the relationship to available cheap energy.  I want to see more from Oliver on current world events.  I want to see even more elaborate discussion and exposure of relationships, influence, and current events.  Hell, it would be nice if he had his own documentary channel with onsite reports to discuss the CIA funding of pro EU supporters that are fighting the Russian sponsored pro Russian rebels in Ukraine.

Were it ont for films like this I would not have truly understood the political and socioeconomic reasons which led to world war 2 nor how America was itself drawen into the war. How many of us knew that embargos on resources set by the US in the Pacific were the motive for the alleged surprise attack by the Japanese? How many Americans know that the US supported Afghan mujjahideen fighters in a civil war with the Russians which later contributed to the collaspse of the Soviet Union and the supposedly unexpected attacks on 9/11?

However; Oliver Stone, to me, has been spoiled by the USA and his shock at how the world really works is naive.  I wish Mr. Stone could have grown up in an Eastern European communist country.  He would have readily understood why so many people hate, yes truly hate, the Russians, the Soviet peoples, and communism.  There is no doubt in my mind that if he grew up in such a place, he would temper his series.

Stone makes it seem like the Cold War was America's fault, that the Soviets kept putting out olive branches, and Dulles, the enemy, kept turning them down.  How can you accept an olive branch that murdered, without exaggeration, the flower of the youth in so many Eastern European countries?  Look at the history of Hungary or Romania, Soviet backed governments murdered priests, officers, engineers, lawyers, anyone with a brain.

Murdered people, not a McCarthy style investigation, or Hoover's wire taps; cold murder, with brain washing to boot.

The USA has done a lot of wrong; but a Capitalist dictatorship is never as bad as a Communist one.  There is no dissent allowed in Communism; in a Communist country, the FBI wouldn't infiltrate the ""Capitalist"" Party"", it would murder all of them, and destroy the career prospects of their families.

Ultimately, what Stone never states, what is never said, is that Communism is an economically and morally destructive road to failure.  When you meet folks from Eastern Europe, their thinking is completely different than an American.  Their minds, and those of their parents have been warped by years of living in a society that is orders of magnitude more repressive than the self censorship of America.

When I hear Stone describe Ho Chi Minh and Castro as ""non-aligned"" it makes me upset.  Both men were clearly aligned with the Communist block; give me a break Stone....Nehru, Nasser, ok, they were non-aligned, but Castro and HCM?

I fear that many Americans born here in the States will see this and instead of saying ""thank God we won, and world Communism is dead"", they will think instead of all the negative things Dulles, Eisenhower, and the rest of these men did.

Unfortunately, in my conclusive opinion, we created a machine to fight communism at home and abroad.  Now that the war is won, we can't seem to turn off the machine; and it just needs more enemies (China, Islam...I find the China scare particularly ludicrous these days).  We also cannot seem to pull out of entangling alliances, especially with Israel, even though these alliances are anachronisms, and only serve to perpetuate the entangling conflicts that keep our machine fighting.

Bottom line, watch the video, but take it with a grain of salt and make sure that before you watch this video, that you at least know the conventional understanding of history.  Don't make Stone's series your datum; make it a series that questions and adds information to your foundation of knowledge.",1406851200,2,3018,4.842105263157895

5924590,4,B00EK52XQK,"I borrowed this dvd and am thinking of getting my own copy; however, the dvd I viewed ends pretty much after the illegal-false-flag Vietnam war.  I was VERY disappointed there wasn't enough on the Gulf of Tonkin and the U.S.S. Maddox false-flag-waving excuse for the war machine.  During that time too there was the U.S.S. Liberty that was deliberately targeted and attacked by Israel with the intent to murder Americans.  That attack had the SOME traitorous Americans backing it.  These false-flag-warring excuses seems to the prefer marketing ploy--and we Americans have not learned to stop being lead...like we were led in 9 1 1 which Israel hand their blood hands in.

Like most crimes of Israel, everything is hushed up unless the offense is against Israel or an Israeli!  I am not afraid to speak the FACTs; free thinking people do not bow to known liars!  Israel intended to murder Americans on the U.S.S. Liberty (and later in 9 1 1) to use it as a false flag excuse to start a war--this is Israel's modus operandi: false flag waving BULL!  But of course none of this can happen without the FEW in our own government.  Most of the context are factual but not indept.  This dvd ends after the Vietnam war so I hope Oliver Stone (OS) will pick up from there in his next series dvd.  Just like the false flag U.S.S. Libery, 9 1 1 WAS also DOMESTIC and it had Israel's signature all over it and we can begin with the WTC leasee-thin-skin Silverstein who said he told the ""fire department to 'pull' [Tower 7 to set off the explosives]!""  If 9 1 1 was a surprise attack--why were there explosives in Tower 7 in the first place?!  WTC 7, conveniently, was where all the evidentiary documents/materials against Goldmansacofshit [sic] (get your money out of Goldmansacofshit) and the rest of the housing bubble cartels were kept.  Hence, no prosecution because ALL the evidence were conveniently destroyed.  Also in WTC 7 were the CIA, IRS, DHS, FBI, NYC control headquarters, and a bunch of other very secure minded government offices.  WTC 7 was not hit by any plane--it had a small suspicious fire and yet it too collapsed in seconds like WTC 1,2.  For WTC 1,2, the Israeli operative Silverstein a few months before the false-flag operation bought insurance against air planes attacks on the WTCs; a few week before the false-flag attack, Silverstein, with Bush's other brother, Marivn, shut off the video and all security features to all 3 WTC buildings that are usually running and in operation 24/7.  (They said the complete security shut down was to install upgrades--what fool would totally shut ALL security features to do upgrade in these HIGH sensitive and security conscious areas.)  The few months before 9 1 1, Silverstein shelled out ~$125million to lease the WTCs; then he bought insurance for air plane attacks against the property and got $7billion when he submitted his claim; how the Port Authority wants to loan that skull-skin-bastard $1.2billion dollars so he can use it to pay his rent to his lease because he's having a hard time renting out office space to in the MurderTower!  The Port Authority is in on this too!  TELL ME this isn't deliberately planned, set up, to fuc Americans!  We paid with our lives; we paid with our hard earn money!  I scream facts and truths everywhere I go and I am fearless in defending America-Americans.  But my little voice is a splash in the ocean and people like Oliver Stone and other mega rich who can make waves, must call up a storm to blow the liars and killers back to the hell they were kicked out of.  They are so disgusting that hell didn't want them!  ""How can 3 of the world's strongest buildings all collapse under 11 seconds?""  This is a documented FACT!  The total combined time of the 3 buildings' collapse was under 11 seconds!  Snap you fingers 11 times and tell me 3 of the world's strongest buildings could all totally collapse that fast, due to FIRE!

The religious talk about good vs. evil but that is not the case; their focus isn't on right or wrong but who's doing it--THEREIN IS the problem: It is not the WHO but the WHAT should be focus.  It does not matter ""who"" did the deed, but ""what"" deed was done and the ""what"" principle applies to both sides of the human aisle.  I don't care who you are, I judge you based on what you do.  Not all criminals (the who) perform murder, but those that murder (the what) are criminals.

When you cannot speak freely, you are not free.  Your mind can be your prison or the sky--this choice is yours, not theirs.  If people are afraid to speak the objective truth then the world would a FLAT planet.  I like the dvd; it is a very good starting line for those who do not know much about the REAL history--the crap they are teaching children in schools is vomittingly bad!  To me this is a good vd starter and junor high to high schoolers should see it and read the ""Trillion Dollar Conspiracy"" afterward to educate their minds.  The American people were not told the TRUTH about U.S.S. Liberty and 9 1 1 where Israel and the few so called americans, murdered innocent Americans.",1406592000,,5100,4.611973392461198

5924592,5,B00EK52XQK,"An eye-opening and depressing survey of the big events of the last 115 years, similar to Howard Zinn's ""People's History of the United States."" This is not about ""hating America,"" it's about looking honestly at our history without the myths, legends and approved narratives we've been taught all our lives. Sadly, most Americans probably aren't psychologically prepared to accept the hard facts about their country and the realities of its foreign policy. People may enjoy hearing politicians across the political spectrum competing  to call the United States humanity's shining hope and a ""force for good"" around the world, but that doesn't make it true. Many of the one-star reviewers appear to have only watched the WWII episode. I recommend that they watch the two Prelude episodes (1900-1940).

I fear for our country - an oligarchy masquerading as a democratic republic - when I consider that there is such a thing as cosmic justice. A lot of people around the world know our history, even if we don't. It's sad that so many Americans feel that in order to be ""patriots,"" they must identify with and defend the crimes of our Elites. Empires always collapse, and ours is in its last years.

There is a wealth of priceless vintage film footage, plus clips from important political and historical films. The emphasis is mostly on foreign policy, though there is some discussion of domestic issues like civil rights, social changes and economic hardship. My only criticism is that the series doesn't go far enough at times. The JFK assassination is dealt with briefly, basically saying that unknown powerful forces were probably responsible. There is no mention of the U-2 crisis in 1960 (an important event in destroying Eisenhower's peace summit with Khrushchev), or the USS Liberty attack. Official stories are accepted where they should be questioned more (Pearl Harbor, James Forrestal's death, Watergate). 9/11 is discussed from the favorite Left position of Chalmers Johnson's ""Blowback.""

5924606,3,B00EK52XQK,"I gained a much deeper appreciation for the Soviet contribution and sacrifice during WW2. I think the first half was done really well. The second half overly partisan and failed to convene the whole picture. Many historical figures were painted in an overly black and white fashion. In the last episode, for example, the complicit nature of the borrowers, the banks, and the government was ignored and an overly simplified version of the event was taken at face value.",1402185600,,468,4.936708860759493

5924609,5,B00EK52XQK,"Present day social structures and attitudes (regardless of what age you happen to be living in at any given time) are often viewed under the scope of limited understanding, dangerous exaggerations and labels.  Without knowing the facts that preceded any given historical event, the present either makes no sense or is often used as propaganda on an unsuspecting, uneducated citizenry to fuel harmful social, military, financial or religious agendas.  Knowing your history - all of it - can stop those agendas.  The art of knowing or having the facts will give all reasonable people cause for pause and allow them to make better choices for themselves, their families, their communities and their country.  This is why we need the Oliver Stones, the Howard Zinns, the Noam Chomskys, etc. of the world ... because without them shedding a very bright light on the lies and misinformation that are constantly being fed to us (the American Public) via main stream media, falsely written school history text books and many politicians, we continue to advance our own (and everyone else's worldwide) demise.

Oliver Stone never ceases to amaze me with his insight and his willingness to simply tell the truth.  The only agenda this man has is to make sure that we know the truth or at the very least that we are pushed to corroborate what he tells us (in other words, go find out for ourselves if what he says is true).

Due to a brilliant history teacher I once had in high school, I've always been willing to keep an open mind, read and search for historical truth - because without it, I'd be living a lie and fueling those lies that keep us hurting ourselves and the rest of the globe.

All middle-school students and up should view this series.  It's interesting, it's accurate and I'm sure it will keep their attention (only history told in a 1 dimensional light is boring).

Oliver Stone has an agenda he wants to perpepuate on the American mind and his leftwing sympathies are apparent in this ""untold"" history.  For those of you who are so thrilled about this series, a true historian is suppose to present a factual accoutning of events and refrain from adding his or her own personal prejudices and bigotry to the work or in the case of Mr. Stone, the narration as well.

No no whats anti American is the fact that this country does not want me to have the right to quality health care where the drs must accept all insurance if they don't like it then they have no business holding the M.D. or DO title. It's anti American to make sure people like me go through hell to get a college education to make it almost impossible.  It's anti American to brag about being pro life yet believe the state has the right to lethal injection.  This country's priorites are ass back wards and I pray one day people will wake up and ssay enough is enough its not what you can do for your country but what can your country do for you. God bless Oliver stone and ill trust him over any of these ass bsckwards people whom truly don't care about me or you. But in all fairness to the radical right wing party I do respect the views of bill O'Reilly glenn beck and sean Hannity and thats because they aren't villians and they have a part of them that shows they care about me and you. This country need education and health care for all with no bs behind it. Obama care is not good enough didn't go all the way.

5924630,5,B00EK52XQK,"This series is well researched and presents quite a different view than what was taught to us in school.  All countries alter history to make themselves look better to their citizens.  The U. S. is no exception.  Still certain documents are kept secret from the light under the cloak of national security.  However, other documents are now in the light and the truth about history is becoming better known.  Oliver Stone presents a lot of material that is contrary to the ""mythology"" that is often perpetrated on the public to have a ""feel good"" effect.  Whether you believe all of this or not, you should avail yourself of these stories.  I'm betting that once seen, you will alter your previous views of what we as Americans have been force fed for decades.",1397520000,2,759,4.704545454545454

Like scattered fragments of glass you may have spent a lifetime trying to reassemble, this series brings them together in such a clear, concise, and coherent  manner; as to make history engaging to the uninterested.
If I may make a suggestion:  I would actually recommend beginning with the two unaired episodes found in the Bonus Features.  They will take you back to WWI as the start point (as opposed to WWII) and give you a stronger foundation for the journey that follows.

I was so fascinated by this documentary that I watched it in 2 days.  I've had it for a week and watched it 3 times already.  It has encouraged me to buy the book and other world history books.  I learned that I am in dire need of educating myself on world history.

Human beings have been endowed with great intelligence.  However, we are not smart enough to stop destroying each other.  We are not going to make it as a species without respecting each other and learning to work together (and even then, the odds of us preventing human extinction are stacked against us).

I am by no means a pacifist.  Still, the savagery of war is astounding to me.  I didn't realize that war and mass rape went hand in hand (something I researched after watching this documentary).  The number of people killed as a result of WWII is impossible to truly comprehend.

Everybody should see this.  We should never unleash the forces of war.  Never.  The lack of real education about the horrors of war will help to ensure that the masses will blindly support engaging in warfare forever.

Last year my sister-in-law, aged 25, asked me ""What was the Vietnam War about?"".  I could not believe my ears.  My father, his brother and many family friends served in the military during the Vietnam Era.  Vietnam was the subject of countless documentaries, feature films, television shows, books and print publications for all of my formative years.  Oliver Stone is correct when he said that our children are not being taught about the true horrors of our wars on purpose.  This is not by accident.

I must offer a heartfelt thanks to Oliver Stone and all who worked with him to bring this series to life.  You have my lifelong admiration for this.  To say I am moved is an incredible understatement.  It is nice to know that somebody is passionate about humanity.

 This is what free speech is all about. People in this country forget that.

 also, If the dropping of the atom bomb was delayed (possibly by Wallace) the Soviets surely would have
had time to make a landing on the Japanese mainland. Then the war would have been continued
conventionally. It would have been mandatory that we crush Japan for attack on Pearl Harbor. Not giving the Russians the glory

Mr. Stone reminds us of the mistakes, miscues and otherwise fatal decisions that have put us in a very precarious today. One criticism: I wish Mr. Stone had someone other than himself do the narration.

You could make convincing arguments for any of those theories if you are careful to cherry pick and exclude all contrary evidence, and that is what Stone and Kuznick have done repeatedly in this series.  Like Howard Zinn, they've set out with a purpose, to influence political policy and promote a liberal-left viewpoint by propagandizing.  You might think Americans would be offended by this unrelenting story of American greed and treachery, with only brief mention of the dark side of communism or fascism.  But like a conspiracy theory, these kinds of stories are appealing, because they give a false sense of superior knowledge.  Everyone is a misled and nave, but we've watched a television show and we know the truth!

5924671,5,B00EK52XQK,"Oliver Stone's ""Untold History of the United States"" is a documentary masterpiece and one that should be compulsory in every school in America.

Whooooha! Did I say compulsory?

I guess you can't force people to watch something. But this is the dilemma in trying to get a message across in a society controlled by wealthy self interest and media magnets like Rupert Murdock with his Fox cable television network.

The big ""Catch 22"" in America for those with a social conscience is the need to have a well educated population and public schooling system while at the same time it's not considered in any way a priority by the self interested power moguls in control.

While there are exceptions of philanthropy, generally the rich and powerful that have influence don't have a social conscience or any desire to halt or hinder their march to some kind of pluralist society.

They like having the drones dummied down. Now with cable television, stupid reality shows, along with Fox's pinhead patriot Bill O'Reilly and his like minded cronies they have the perfect vehicle.

Oliver Stone's documentary genuinely seeks to ask Americans to take a look at how it's been led and what truths and untruths they've been told in his well narrated effort.

While Stone doesn't hide his admiration for Roosevelt, Henry Wallace and Martin Luther King he also doesn't hide the shortcomings of Obama and other democrats. Truman in particular. He liked to use the ""N"" word appears to suffer little man syndrome and his tough talk actions kicked off the cold war.

Statistics from war casualties to CEO salaries will enlighten you and more so disgust you.
Those that create or cause these wars, death tolls and the financial suffering by their illegal actions don't pay any price whatsoever and are often being lauded as heroes while the taxpayer pays the price.

So with pinhead patriots like Bill O'Reilly prepared to trumpet misinformation to his huge Murdock created audience what chance is there to have people realise that their blind patriotism has them being used in dirty wars to fill the pockets of those wealthy politicos that want them to remain ignorant?

Why do I say Murdock created?
Well Rupert Murdock realised a long time ago in England how to get a huge lightweight working class to buy his newspapers simply by sensationalising stories with fiction along with page three girls in bikinis.

Just compare a salivating Mr Geraldo and his excited news reports along with the generally bleached blonde females with six inch stilettos, fluttery eyelashes and image conscience personas to other networks.  These people are not employed for their intelligence but sensational journalism (fictional if needed) and sex appeal. Musician Don Henley said it well with the song ""Dirty Laundry""

Roger Stone will be called a lefty, a socialist and a communist no doubt as anyone does that speaks of social justice. Are his views leftist and socialistic? Yes. How can't they be?

But while O'Reilly and the conservative right continually try to label the word socialism as a dirty one their own blind patriotism is not unlike what lead Germans to follow Hitler's rants of patriotism to the fatherland.

Oliver Stone's documentary is a genuine effort to get America to look at itself before some chest beating nut leads the world into a catastrophe.

While I realise much of this review refers to Rupert Murdock's cable media I would argue the relevance of its mention by saying it's one of the major hurdles that a documentary touting this information is faced with.",1390348800,19,3553,4.956228956228956

His ""Untold History..."" series taught me things about history that I never learned in school and provided me with context on events that were simply glossed over. The main theme of the series is American Imperialism and the ill effects associated with it. Oliver Stone utilizes various historical clips, quotes, photos, etc. from WWII up to 2012. As other reviews have stated, Stone mostly does a good job of keep it objective although there are moments in which his views bleed through. Mostly, I believe that he does a great job of challenging the status quo retelling of such crucial moments as WWI, WWII, the Cold War, our invasions of the Middle East, and even Obama's use of drones. Stone does a great job of depicting the flaws of each president's handling of our ""American Empire,"" with a few exceptions. He is too cozy with Roosevelt and Kennedy presupposing that these men were pragmatic idealists. I was happy to see him break away from his Hollywood friends by criticizing Obama's use of Drones, the NSA, and his willingness to choke out whistleblowers, and continue to advance Bush's imperialism. You will also find that he is easier on the Russians and socialism in general, but again this is the untold history. Many in this country feel that socialism is simply evil without ever having fully considered why they have these feelings. Many of these emotions are simply passed down through media and family teaching. At the end of the day, I still choose capitalism, but I do so with hope that reform to our imperialistic ways may one day lead to true change. Change that promised under Obama that was left unfulfilled.",1386892800,6,1838,4.779874213836478

5924698,2,B00EK52XQK,"Caveat Emptor on this series ... I am up to the 4th episode and I have some comments before I go on to the next in the series:

The first two were accurate, though I could have wished that Stone had made it clearer that it was AMERICANS (not the American government) that blocked our early entry into World War II. He did mention the citizen objections, but the emphasis was not on that, and it left the feeling that our government was somehow at fault in this area. In fact, they were obeying the will of the people. This is why television is a dangerous way to get your history education. Time spent on a subject and the degree of detail given can leave false impressions.

I appreciated his discussion of the Russian involvement in the war and I think he HAS cleared up an important misunderstanding: the Russians contributed a significant effort to the defeat of Hitler. As he says: the Russians won the war. American involvement provided distractions, but not the knockout punch. I loved this part. On the other hand, he spent little, if any, time discussing Stalin's early alliance with Hitler. When your ally has backed both sides, how can you ever really trust them?

I learned a great deal about Henry Wallace. Before this series, I didn't even know who he was. Now I want to know more about him. Very interesting.

I don't know enough about Truman to agree or disagree with his character analysis of him or his motives in dropping The Bomb. In hindsight, it's easy to see that it was the Russian invasion that turned the tide of the war. But ... Stone almost makes it seem as if we dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki out of hubris or because the government wanted to see how the atom bomb worked! I doubt that. It is more likely that we simply didn't understand the Japanese culture and motivations in the war.

The fourth part in this series, however, has really gotten me irritated.

Stalin was a tyrant and a monster. Wikipedia says he murdered anywhere between 3 and 60 million of his own people. Those numbers boggle the imagination. And he certainly condemned many millions more to horrible lives in the work camps of Siberia. There was no freedom of any kind in the USSR. Stalin rejected the Marshall Plan -- consigning the Russian people to years of starvation, long bread lines and abject misery. He preferred to stay out of the Marshall Plan because it would have reduced his power to expand Soviet influence into other countries. His daughter Svetlana loathed him. It is well known that she defected to the United States and wrote a scathing expose of ""Papa:"" Twenty Letters To A Friend.

Stone neglects to mention any of this in his discussion of the Cold War. He makes it seem as if the United States didn't deal fairly with Stalin at the end of the war; we shortchanged him and didn't give him all he wanted or all we promised. But by the time the war was over, we'd already had clear signs of Stalin's intentions. We knew he was a power hungry murderer who could not be trusted. There was no reason to give in to his demands for territory. Stone also makes it appear as if the Red Scare was nothing more than a bunch of propaganda trumped up by the CIA and news media. He belittles our fear of Russians getting the bomb and using it on us. His hindsight is great, but Stalin had already shown us that he did not value human life and would go to great lengths to increase the spread of socialism and hence his own power.

Much credit has been denied to the Russian people for their heroic efforts in World War II. It's high time someone pointed this out. However, this does not mean that we should have given in to Stalin's demands. The Cold War wasn't a bunch of phony baloney; our fears were triggered by Stalin's ruthless actions before and during the 1950s. Stone has conveniently twisted the truth to come to a conclusion that anyone who knows just a little history can prove to be false.",1385683200,13,3926,4.488795518207283

I've watched half of it and it was too much for me. First of all, they considered the act of raping women less important if made by Soviets, more if made by Nazis, I'm sorry for them, but, for me, a person is a person no matter what his/her religion, language, etc., so a rape is a crime, there's no justification, nor even revenge as they used in this documentary, period.
I've stopped watching it during the JFK part, when they underlined that he was upset to help the French government in Asia while the US was helping Hungarians and critisizing Soviets.......what? Helping who? Hungarians, during their revolution, were left alone, the Suez channel's issue was more important and all western countries considered Hungarian revolution an ""internal issue"", but unfortunately for Mr Stone and his historian friend it was not, it wasn't a civil war, unless you consider the liberation of Europe from Nazis a civil war too. In Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, there was a part of the popultion collaborating with Soviets (as there was who collaborated with Nazis. Horthy, Petain, etc...Mr Stone have you ever heard of them or were you too busy cherry picking fact?) but it was a revolution against an occupant force (yes, there were armed soldiers throughout the country) and against the duty to give them for free grains, fruit, etc. Hungarians wanted to be free, they wanted ""ruskis"" out of their Country.

8606251,1,B00EK52XQK,"This review pertains only to ""Chapter I.  (I'll comment on subsequent chapters later.)  First, there is *nothing*  'new' or 'untold' here--except, perhaps, Stone's glorification of  Joseph Stalin (whom Stone describes as ""heroic"").  This is the same old 'good guy's vs 'bad guy's story that I was taught  in public school (and I am about the same age as Stone').  The presentation is crude, simplistic, and presents itself very much like a World War II Hollywood propaganda film.  The series's only virtue is that it utilizes at times rare archival footage.  This is 'history' for those who can't be bothered with reading books.  Mr. Stone himself  might consider actually doing some historical research before spewing out tripe like this.",1525824000,2,739,5.177966101694915

Cannot help at the recurring theme from the One Star ""reviews""......as they call it ""biased"". That seems to be the rally cry of The Far Right...as if Fox ""News"" does not have a bias. We ALL have our own Bias/Slant.
As in this video, when they say The Russians ""won' the war in Europe. No SINGLE county or group won the war. But Stone's point is well taken. The Allies NEVER would have landed in Normandy if The Russians had not spent 20-30 Million people to bludgeon The Wehrmacht for 3-1/2 years. The Soviets could not have done THAT without all the trucks and supplies they got from The Allies.  It was a group effort with MANY Stories and Details.
This IS a very good video with A LOT of great information to consider. You will not be sorry if you purcjase this DVD :-)",1520208000,,788,4.324324324324325
