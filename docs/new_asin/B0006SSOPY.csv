8042794,5,B0006SSOPY,"""Ninja Terminator"" is almost beyond ridiculous.  Director Godfrey Ho made probably four movies worth of ninja action starring Richard Harrison and company, then proceeded to cut those four films up, splice them into random Hong Kong action flicks, and came out with about 20 ""ninja"" films ranging from the fairly boring Ninja the Protector to the sublimely ludicrous ""Ninja Terminator"" and ""Ninja Commandments.""

This one is mostly notable for Harrison taking a call from the evil ninja overlord on a Garfield telephone, the bad ninjas using a Transformer to send a message to the heroes, and a recipe for Drunken Crab.",1272412800,,619,5.118811881188119
8042795,3,B0006SSOPY,"Ninja Terminator is not a ""good"" movie. It is not a movie recommendable to serious movie connoisseurs as a quality piece of film, or even to casual viewers that want to be amused. This movie is or people that like bad kung fu films, for the people who love spending nights with friends eating popcorn and laughing their a**es off. People that find humor in bad dubbing, cheesy fight scenes where almost no contact is made, and confusing plots that make you wonder if someone at the dvd company just cut various scenes together from different movie and dubbed it into English to try to pass it off as something new to the home video audience.

With that out of the way, Ninja Terminator is brilliant. It embodies all the wacky elements that will crack you and your friends up. The amazing special effects (Messenger robot?!?!), costumes (look for the man in the blonde wig) and dubbing (which is especially awkward on the Caucasian actors) are funny enough to leave you referencing them for weeks and months. The disjointed story is somewhat confusing, often making you think  you are watching two different films.

The drawbacks are still there, of course. drawn out 'sex' scenes (which don't have that much nudity but a lot of hinting at it) make it not-family-friendly and make even adults uncomfortable after the initial humor from how bad they are. They are rather unnecessary and add little to the film, and are totally skippable (unless you are into 80's asian soft porn, weirdo). The film also loses momentum and starts dragging on about 2/3rds into it. The movie is simply too long for something that is so hard to follow the plot of. No one will judge you if you skip to the more exciting (and ridiculous) final fight scenes after your first viewing.

Conclusion: excellent terrible movie. Totally worth the buy for the old kung fu and ninja film fans and for those with a good sense of humor. If you have your doubts, go to youtube and look for 'ninja warrior'- ignore the fight scenes (most of them are the final fight, spoilers!), go for anything that mentions 'robot' and especially 'steamed crab' or my favorite: how Richard Harrison deals with arguments.",1245628800,3,2169,4.73015873015873
