4449947,5,B004QOB8SO,"Three episodes make up the second series and they build to a sensational climax. I'm quite a fan of this modern take on the Holmes character and stories and would allocate 6 stars if they were available. This is because the scripts, direction, acting, plot and so forth are, in my view, streets ahead of anything in the same genre.
I wasn't keen on episode one which introduces Irene Adler. I think there may be two reasons for this. Some of the story seemed silly and I felt a bit let down by the childishness of it all. Secondly I just didn't feel there was any true chemistry between Holmes and the saucy Ms Adler. I was eager for him to admire her mind but we saw too much of her body and I felt very let down by that. Scenes at Buckingham Palace come across as being for an American audience so I'll forgive the producers the eye to the commercial potential across the pond. Episode 3 is so superb it counterbalances my view of episode one hence the overall 5 stars.
Episodes 2 and 3 are fully back on track and just wonderful. Sheer escapism, witty, fast-paced and with memorable performances. Episode 3 had moments of shock and surprise. I would have prefered to be left on a total cliffhanger rather than a partial one but I won't say more to spoil the denoument.",1326672000,17,1271,4.389830508474576

4449980,1,B004QOB8SO,"At the time of this writing, late December 2017, there are renewed threats that the terrible Sherlock television show might be revived. Im begging that this vile piece of filth  which never should have existed in the first place  not be given yet more time to damage the true Sherlock Holmes! This show is an abomination from first to last, making people think that Sherlock Holmes was a murderous creepy sociopath, Watson had a psychosomatic wound (with all the A to A-0.1 range that Martin Freemans little sputtering double-take Jim/Hobbit skill can generate), that Mary is a ninja and Mrs. Hudson is the widow of a drug dealer and Irene Adler is a dominatrix, and that Mycroft and Moriarty were . . . whatever that was that those terrible terrible actors, Mark Gatiss and Andrew Scott tried to portray.

When I first heard about a new Sherlock Holmes television show several years ago, to be produced by BBC Wales, I was thrilled. Ive been an avid reader and collector of literally thousands of stories about the original true Holmes since I was a boy in the 1970s. (Ive even written some Holmes stories and novels, and edited a lot of other Holmes anthologies.) Soon, in spite of my initial enthusiasm, I was disappointed to see that this new show was going to be set in modern times. This has been done before in several films, so it was not a new or original idea  do these clowns have any original ideas? Additionally, there have been shows such as House that lift many Sherlockian aspects, giving us even more versions of a modern Holmes. The thing these modern versions have in common is that they are not actually about Sherlock Holmes, a character born in the 1850s, and working as a consulting detective in the Victorian and Edwardian ages. These modern takes are instead about a character that has the same name, a few personality quirks, and little else.

Of course, when I first saw Sherlock I was mightily disappointed. Still, Im just one voice, and it went on to be wildly popular, with many people arguing that it didn't matter if it was set in the correct era, as long as the characters had the correct names. I have to disagree with that. As Ive explained before elsewhere: Imagine a new movie re-make featuring a character named Luke Skywalker, who lives in a dusty desert Old West town and meets a crazy old prospector/ex-soldier named Ben Kenobi. They find out about a girl that needs to be rescued, and they hire a roguish wagon driver, Hans, and his big hairy unintelligible tobacco-chewing side-kick (named Chew Bacer) to take them somewhere. Then, there is some big-shot with a pun-like name similar to Darth Vader who has a Death Train  kind of like the one in the Lone Ranger movie  and so on. The character names are the same or very similar, and there are all sorts of winks and nods to the original fans, showing that the creators are very familiar with the original material  as the Bard said, The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose  but if its not actually set in the stars, then it isn't Star Wars anymore.

As the show Sherlock progressed, many people who had initially enjoyed it came to dislike it, as it wandered farther and farther from Sherlock Holmes, becoming a shrine to how clever Gatiss and Moffat think they are. As things stand following their desecration, Holmes is a drug addict murderer and Mary Watson is a global assassin. How does that fit at all with the true Canon?

When it was first teased that there was going to be a stand-alone episode of the show, in what came to be The Abominable Bride, setting Holmes and Watson back in the correct Victorian era, I was cautiously optimistic. Gatiss and Moffat stated in interviews that they had the chance to film Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Holmes and Watson the way they were supposed to be, back to basics. Photos were released throughout the process showing the actors in period costume and on appropriate sets. Over and over, it was indicated that this was going to be a unique episode, wherein Holmes and Watson would be in the correct time period, with no explanation whatsoever. It would be completely separate from the modern-day version, which had concluded Season 3 by sending Sherlock, that modern-day alternate universe simulacrum of the true Holmes, into exile following his cold-blooded murder of a rich criminal.

On the night of the premiere, January 1st, 2016, the episode ran in England five hours before appearing in the U.S. Before the 9pm showing here in the U.S., I had four emails from friends warning me, including one that indicated there were some modern aspects. However, we settled in to watch. The first hour was okay. It was exceptionally well filmed, I didn't mind some of the snappy in-joke dialogue, and I didn't object to the film techniques of reenacting the crimes as seen from the sitting room, or having Holmes grab the floating newspaper articles in his mind. I thought that was the modern part that I had been told/warned about.

And then, at around the one hour mark, that exceptionally terrible actor  and I cant overstate that fact enough, hes simply awful  Andrew Scott, shows up as a Moriarty hallucination. The room starts to shake and rock, and suddenly were back on the airplane in modern times, where Season 3 left off. My blood pressure spiked in anger so much that my head hurt, and  to paraphrase a character in A Study in Scarlet  I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me. Actually, I didn't have a nose bleed, but I probably needed to.

For it turned out that Gatiss and Moffat had  no surprise here  proven to be liars.

The next half hour devolved into a mess in which Holmes was drug-hallucinating the whole 1890s segment in order to figure out how Moriarty in the present had supposedly survived. It then went through a whole round-about of dreams within dreams  a concept blatantly stolen from Inception  and alternate realities wherein the modern version might be a story told by the 1890s Holmes or the 1890s version might be a drug hallucination from the present  a concept blatantly stolen from a Deep Space 9 episode, and probably a number of other things blatantly stolen that I don't even recognize.

In the end, I wasn't surprised, as Gatiss and Moffat just cant help themselves. I don't watch Doctor Who, but I can only imagine the pain felt by some of those true fans as these people ruin their character too. I do know that when Gatiss adapted the Poirot episode The Big Four, he stated that the novel that it was based on was an almost unadaptable mess. He certainly unadapted it, all right. In fact, he ruined it. There were parts of it that should NOT have been changed or eliminated, but of course he did. Theres a reason certain books and characters are beloved across generations, and it constantly amazes me that script writers like Gatiss think that they can do better than the original authors when messing up original material that has millions of loyal followers for a reason.

 The Abominable Bride can only be rewatched if one only views the 1890s segments that relate to the Ricoletti investigation  most of the first hour, and a very few pieces from the last half-hour  ignoring the modern dreck tacked on to it. Ive had to do this kind of thing before. For instance, Ive re-read several times the first two chapters of The Last Sherlock Holmes Story by Michael Dibdin, but I go no further, as the rest of the book is a spurious addition that only damages Holmes. The same is true for Sherlock  To paraphrase Doyle: It takes peoples minds from better things.

No one needs to see Mr. Cumberbatch say something snarky or cute while wearing a cool coat. I could not care less specifically about Benedict Cumberbatch, et al. Ive never in my life watched a film or TV show just because it had a certain actor in it. I watch for characters. It doesnt matter to me if Indiana Jones is played by Harrison Ford or Sean Patrick Flanery or River Phoenix, as long as they get the character of Indiana Jones right. Cumberbatchs Holmes was almost right for 2/3s of The Abominable Bride, as close as some other actors have come, and the whole thing could have been really great  the first time that Cumberbatch had actually played the true Holmes on screen  but then they went off in the weeds. And then they went off a cliff. And the episodes that followed simply became too loathsome for even many crazed fans. This sickening show should die.

Gatiss and Moffat claim to respect The Canon, and that there would be no modern adaptations, as they wanted to direct people back to the originals. But they had no problems putting out their terrible versions as comics, and also defiling the original stories by putting out versions with Cumberbatch and Bilbo Baggins on the cover. Hypocrites to the end.

Tell Gatiss and Moffat I said so. Tell them I hate their stinking show and what they're trying to do to the True Sherlock Holmes. Tell them to go try to ruin something else instead.",1514592000,,9037,4.637445209768315

On rainy or cold winter days, I love to pop some corn and sit back under a warm blanket to watch these.

The acting is great.  I truly believe the neurosis of the lead character played by Cumberbatch, but I think even more interesting is Dr. Watson played by Freeman.  The chemistry is the best I've seen for a while.  I believe it when Dr. Watson feels like smacking Sherlock.  It is dramatic, funny, many layered, and just overall entertaining.

First and foremost I liked the decision to move the series into our times. Jeremy Brett's performances of Holmes in the 19th century are unrivaled. You needed something different. Now I began with the second season and from the start I knew that I had missed something. This was later confirmed after I saw the prior episode from the previous season, The Great Game. It left Holmes, Watson & Moriarty in a standoff by the pool. It left the audience hanging just like the old serial films from cinema. Want to find out what happened? Come back for the next film. The series also made .more use of flashbacks as well as posting texts and thoughts on the screen towards the development of the plot and its characters. Each show may borrow from not one but several stories. They retain their connection to Doyle but are also different. The writing and acting are both quite good but so is the cinematography, the direction and the editing. The entire production of the Sherlock series was well done.

4450103,4,B004QOB8SO,"My 5-star review for season 1 took a hit in this season for what many may think is trite and prudish. But the first 45minutes of season 2, episode 1 is all about sex and nudity. . .showing as much as they can without showing they key parts. Really? Between the two seasons this is the only episode like this.

Yes, this series has some adult jokes, but those are tame compared to a movie like Grease (have you read the lyrics to Grease Lighting?). Otherwise I can watch most of this show with my family, even though it is not specifically geared to a family audience.

Episode 1: A Scandal in Belgravia
As mentioned we get some adult content that pushed the border as much as you could for USA TV standard/rules. I guess what also partially left a bad taste is the actress that does the nude scenes was nominated for acting, in part because she was in the buff. Really? From all the great television, this is what gets a person a nomination over others. Wow.
+ The friendship between Sherlock and Watson progress
+ The last half of the episode was genius writing

Episode 2: The Hounds of Baskerville
+ A very interesting take on the classic Holmes story by the same name

Episode 3: The Reichenbach Fall
+ We see Moriarty for the real threat he is, whereas for me, season 1 was the appetizer and this episode is our first main course. This is a major Moriarty episode.
+ Each time I finish an episode I think that was better than the previous one. That is definitely the case for this one...better than the other 5 episodes (season 1 and 2) that came before it.
+ First real cliff hanger episode...I don't mean to say that to spoil anything, but to say, ""Have season 3 queued up and ready, because you'll want to watch immediately following!!""

Another solid season.
Such great writing and characters that I can forgive British TV for keeping a ""season"" to only 3 episodes, which are in fact mini-movies at 90-minutes each.

4450236,2,B004QOB8SO,"The problem is that the show depends on you believing that Sherlock is a genius yet incredibly stupid and unlikely things apparently happen all the time and he buys them (or does them).  [spoiler alert] The big reveal in The Hounds Of Baskerville is that the young boy falsely remembered that he had seen his father killed by a gigantic hound because he had actually seen his father killed by a man in a gas mask WEARING A T-SHIRT that said ""H.O.U.N.D Liberty IN"" which was the name and place of a super-top-secret chemical weapons program the killer was working on.  I mean -- doesn't everybody in a super top secret program wear the code name of the project and the place it's being conducted on a t-shirt?  I know for sure that all the folks involved in the invasion of Normandy were wearing ""Operation Overload, Normandy FR,  June 6, 1944"" on their shirts for weeks before it happened.  (On a minor note, Sherlock notes that Dr. Frankland referred to his ""cell number"" proving he had spent time in America.  Except that that time in America would have had to have been before he committed the murder, which was 20 years ago.  Nobody had ""cell"" phones in America 20 years ago.)

BTW, in the very first Sherlock they show what a genius/insufferable know-it-all Sherlock is by having him correct, sentence by sentence, the incorrect grammar of a working-class man he's speaking with.  Then in ""A scandal in Belgravia""  Sherlock says somebody (I for get who) ""gave it to John and I.""  Really?  Your average 3rd grader has advanced beyond this grammatical mistake (""gave it to....I ?).",1471132800,,1584,4.699275362318841

4450406,5,B004QOB8SO,I absolutely love this season and didn't think I would - to me Sherlock Holmes was always Basal Rathbone.  Only got onto it because I got season 1 extremely cheap and was immediately hooked.  A novel idea setting this in modern times and Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman to me are tailor-made for Holmes and Watson.

Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are arguably the best Holmes and Watson ever.  Moving the series to the present day was just the jolt needed to prevent it from becoming just another reverential retread of familiar material.

Being a big fan of British TV drama all my life, I knew going in that I was probably going to be pleasantly entertained & I was not disappointed.
It is a very different ""take"" on the English detective and his best friend here, but Benjamin Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman do not disappoint! They are both amazing actors and bring their best to the program ~ making the viewing here most entertaining.
I have kept both series in my watch list and I refuse to delete either one! I know I will go back to enjoy the world's most famous detective again and again ~ and never regret one moment spent!!",1442275200,,754,4.316901408450704

""A Scandal in Belgravia"" is edgy and fun; ""The Hounds of Baskerville"" is an interesting, suspenseful twist on the original story, and ""The Reichenbach Fall"" is truly stunning.

4450638,5,B004QOB8SO,"I think I binge-watched Season 1 and 2 of this show in a weekend and Season 2 was my fav by far (at that point). Though it features my least favorite episode ('The Hounds of Baskerville'), it has my all-time favorite of the series 'A Scandal in Belgravia,' which is...perfection. Worth the price of admission alone. That, coupled with 'The Reichenbach Fall' make this an excellent watch. Even if you don't have the literary knowledge of the character of Sherlock Holmes (which I do not, but there are quite a bit of nods to the audience if you do) you can enjoy this show.

4450762,4,B004QOB8SO,"Fascinating. I am a fan of the original Sherlock Holmes stories and novels and this series updates them while staying (mostly) faithful to the original plots and characters. I did not give it a top rating (five stars)  because I frequently find it difficult to follow what Benedict Cumberbatch is saying - he speaks very fast and has a British accent. I appreciate that this is all part of his portrayal of Holmes but my having to rewind the video (usually more than once) to better understand what he is saying interrupts the flow of the story. I have even tried SAP, but that makes the situation worse for me. So, I definitely recommend this series but be prepared for some audio issues.",1427328000,,689,4.6016260162601625

4450794,2,B004QOB8SO,"A modernized Sherlock Holmes that isn't entirely faithful to the spirit of the original novels.  They try too hard to be politically correct (replacing actual smoking wiht a 3 nicotine patch solution)  and have made this Holmes too narcicistic; Watson isn't much better than the Nigel Bruce version as a somewhat dottering side kick--but the Basil Rathbone's incarantion of the novels had more heart.  I find this Holmes to be to icily aloof, too inhuman.  In the original novels, Hollmes actually cared about people and wanted to help them--this Holmes is all about his own ego and superiority.
I must admit that I liked this version intially, but after thenRobert Downing Junior/Judd Law movies and the American Elementary have really given it up--a shame really because it had so much potential to be something great.

My advise is to check out Elementary first before investing much time in this incarnation.  That Holmes, though egocentric, really cares about people.",1425254400,,972,5.120253164556962
4450795,4,B004QOB8SO,"Sherlock: Season 2 gives us a lot of our old favorites; Irene Adler, The Baskervilles, and Moriarty II. While the reimagining is very inventive, and the pace is, as always, smart, I found some of the plot lines wanting. I would rather see Sherlock probing to find answers to a complex crime rather then constantly questioning himself and progressing by fits and starts. There must be a way to develop the characters and their relationships without it coming to suicides, therapy, self analysis, or worse, crying. That said I'm on to Season 3. Hoping for a reprise of season 1 the series is after all brilliant.",1425254400,,610,4.764150943396227

4450816,5,B004QOB8SO,"This is the second series of Sherlock. It consists of three episodes. Steve Moffat and Mark Gatiss tackle the three classic Sherlock Holmes stories namely ""The Lady"", ""The Hound"", and ""The Professor"". A scandal in Belgravia is a very clever, subtle, and sexy version of a ""Scandal in Bohemia"" and counts as my favourite episode in the two series so far. Irene Adler is played gloriously by Lara Pulver and the intellectual contest between Irene and Sherlock is funny and compelling. The Hound of Baskervilles is a horror story in which we see Sherlock experience a new range of emotions as the strange and twisted conspiracy at a military facility is played out. The final episode is ""The Reichenbach Fall"" which is based loosely on ""The Final Problem"". Moriarty sets out to ruin Sherlock's reputation. Andrew Scott's portrayal of Moriarty shows that Benedict Cumberbatch may be the first equal in terms of acting in this series. The episode ends with the expected cliff hanger. This series is even more enjoyable than the first one. The production values standards of acting are at the highest level and this maintains the reputation of all involved.",1423958400,,1151,4.9689119170984455

4450911,5,B004QOB8SO,"The only bad thing is I can't find any other TV series to equal this one. It excels in every dimension. The characters are all engaging and each one adds to the whole, the dialogue witty, interesting, brilliant. The cinematography is wonderful.. every shot is interesting and gives depth to the emotional experience, there are occasional quirky brilliant creative camera work that adds to the emotional effect of the story without distracting. the overlaid graphics that show you texting, thoughts, etc, also add to the tapestry but don't distract. The music speaks to the heart and is unusual.. you can't quite pin down the flavors. Its moves you both physically through the action, and emotionally from the heart. It is emotional and not mechanical. One of the themes that is quieter is very poignant.. Touching... but never overdone,.. and never so obvious to the emotions that you feel the music is telling you how to feel, or overriding the action.  The Bromance between Sherlock and and Watson has amazing onscreen chemistry and makes the whole thing fly.
When I first saw this series I wasn't that into it until episode 3 and didn't love it till episode 4, but after episode 4 I was hooked... deeply hooked. So my advise is give it to at least episode 4 to decide. I've seen the 3 seasons 4 times through now, and I'm still engrossed! I keep seeing more and more.

""A Scandal in Belgravia"" has one of my favorite lines, with Watson demanding to know why Holmes was prompting a fist fight with him.  ""I was a soldier, I've killed people you know.""  Holmes replied ""But you were a doctor!""  ""I've had bad days!""",1419552000,,422,4.428571428571429

I enjoyed the twist on the Irene Adler character, and the first episode is just pure brilliance. Episode 2 is one of the odder episodes of the series, but I also love it and enjoy watching Sherlock manipulate people. Episode 3 is also brilliant, and I just adore the Moriarty character and the mirth in which the actor portrays him. I just can't get over the writing! I cannot watch all those crime dramas that are on TV now- They're all the same, and I don't care about the characters. This is in a league of its own.",1409529600,,622,4.5625

One thing I really love is how they take you inside the mind of Sherlock and show you his thought processes, rather than having Sherlock always have to explain everything.  The people they are putting into the characters are perfect for the parts!  WELL DONE!",1409184000,,429,4.743243243243243

4451155,3,B004QOB8SO,"I just finished watching all 3 seasons of Sherlock and I must admit that is was... not as good as I have heard. I am going to review the entire series. I am going to be very honest. I am not a hipster, nor do I have some bizarre notion that if the show comes from BBC it is automatically better than those found in the US. I am fair and I believe a show must pass on its own merit, not on how cool I will seem for liking it.
First, the good- and there is quite a lot of it. The show is a good one. True to form, BBC assembles a terrific crew with top notch costuming, set designs, and music. It is beautiful to look at and hear. It offers a modern update to the Victorian world of Sherlock Holmes that possesses to-the-moment technological savvy. It works this well, capitalizing on how the original tales displayed a hero who used any and all methods to solve crime.
The cast, too, is fantastic. Benedict Cumberbatch is far better than I expected. He is funny, sharp, and sells the audience on his crazy intellect. He even, once or twice, manages to make Holmes a fully realized character who is more than his rudeness and brilliance. Though- for the most part he is simply a superhero with no tact. Oh, and the 'mind palace' stuff is dreadful and the creators of the show need to forget about it.
Martin Freeman truly shines. His all-too-human Watson is magnetic and immediately accessible. He elevates the show as the single best performer on it. His performance, more than the writing or Cumberbatch's performance, truly grounds the show and makes it seem plausible.
Also outstanding are Mark Gatiss as Mycroft Holmes, Laura Pulver as Irene Adler (though she is woefully under-used), and Amanda Abbington as Mary Watson (though the plot twist surrounding her at the end of season 3 is so awful that it is painful to watch).
The writing for the show, overall, is deeply at odds with itself. The dialog is great and the characterization of most of the players is enjoyable. However, the mysteries aren't particularly hard to deduce. In some cases, they are telegraphed so blatantly that one wonders how stupid Holmes, et al, must be not to see it. The pacing is uneven as well. Too often, a great deal of time is spent in setting up the problem, which is then solved in the final 10 minutes of the show. That is a problem easily overlooked, however, since most mysteries similarly suffer. What haunts Sherlock is that its character moments are too clever for its own good. They are great moments. Brilliant, as a matter of fact, but the writers know it and they dwell on it. This leads to the plot of the episode almost always getting set aside for long tracts of witty banter. It is as if the show gets distracted by its own cleverness. Fortunately, the clever is very, very clever.
So, the show is excellent. 4 to 5 stars depending upon the episode (well, the pilot is a weak link, 3 for it, but it IS a pilot and they are almost universally weak, so slack should be cut).
BUT
The bad guys in this show are crap. Everything good about the show is in its heroes. As soon as the big bads show up, the but starts to smell up the room.
Laura Pulver is the sole exception. Her Catwoman-ish turn as Irene Adler is excellent and she departs the show far too soon.
Lars Mikkelsen is Magnussen in season 3 and while his performance cannot be faulted, the writing for the character is pathetic. He is described by all parties as brilliant and yet when he actually shows up and begins talking, he comes across as petty, insipid, and idiotic. He literally stupids his way to defeat, obviously handing over to the heroes many great reasons to dispose of him and not one for his keeping. It is blunderingly ridiculous.
The villains from A Study in Pink, The Hounds of Baskerville, and The Sign of Three are adequate to the tale at hand, to be sure, but easily forgotten.
The biggest but, and the show's weakest link, is Andrew Scott as Moriarty. Holmes' most notorious villain is here notorious for all the wrong reasons.
I should first say that the part is disastrously written, lacking any menace or subtlty whatsoever. In fact, the role lacks almost all intelligence, as Moriarty comes across as an idiotic drama queen most of the time (In all fairness, his robbery/prison escape/trial plot in the second season was brilliant). That much is not Scott's fault. An actor can only do so much with a crap role (witness Cumberbatch as Kahn, for example).
However, Scott chews the scenery with a ravenous display of campy overacting that would make the cast of the 1966 Batman blush. His choices as an actor reduce the poorly written lines he is delivering into obnoxiousness so overwhelming that I'd likely give the show 2 stars if it were not for his lack of on-screen time. Barbarian Queen II has finer performances. Somehow he won awards for this mess. Don't let those little statues impress you, though. This one's as ill-deserved as handing out a knighthood to Guy Fawlkes.
So, overall, the show is great, but for its villains. Still, it was entertaining enough to make me watch all 3 seasons and be curious about season 4, though with Moriary's unfortunate return I'm not too curious. I guess it boils down to this:
The hype is more impressive than the show.",1406073600,,5252,4.535300316122234

I am enjoying Cumberbatch's Holmes as much as I enjoyed Jeremy Brett's version. In fact, I have come to believe that this Holmes is better than the Brett version, mostly due to the deeper focus on the Holmes/Watson relationship. What was latent in the earlier shows is explicit and explored here. It doesn't matter which is better, of course, because we can watch both of them for even more pleasure.

When Season Two opens up with Irene Adler as a dominatrix, I knew that I was in for simply Sherlock Season One just sexed up.

After that episode, it improves a little, and the story line is okay. It's just not Season One. Though it ends on a cliff hanger, I've yet to buy Season Three. Surely it has not excited me for wanting more as Season One did.",1397001600,,517,4.068627450980392

*** Spoiler below:

2)  The charm of the first 2 seasons was the cleverness of the writing in taking the original stories and updating them to modern times.  The season finale last season was part of that intricate plotting--using the Richenbach Falls theme to have them jumping off buildings in the middle of London--smashing!

It kicks off with a story that is so full of surprises, it'll knock your socks off. The actors now seem even more comfortable in their roles, there's more humor in the scripts, and the stories are getting more intricate. SHERLOCK is an excellent production, again.

The third episode in Season Two is a masterful cliff-hanger that inspired fans to speculate on the same scale as ""Who shot J.R.?"" many years ago. (I'd give a lot to get 26 episodes per season as we used to get on network TV, but if we did, the quality would surely suffer.)

As in the Season One DVD set, the commentaries by actors, writers and producers is great fun to hear.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Season-2/dp/B004QOB8SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock: Season 2</a>

At first I had serious doubts that I'd like a Sherlock which took place in the modern world, but it works,and it works very, very well.  Cumberbatch manages to be old-fashioned and quirky in the way I'd hope and expect, and Freeman is as perfectly imperfect and human as any Watson you would ever want with dear Sherlock.",1396310400,,431,4.375
4451433,5,B004QOB8SO,"Rule #2...never think that a cliffhanger ending cannot be out done....
First, if my comments on the first season was read I stated that at the end of episode three I laughed my a$$ off...this was mostly because I already had access to season two.  When I watched the beginning of season 2 episode 1 I literally fell to the floor laughing....and it just got better the more I watched!
Again, I would highly recommend watching this when you have access to the next season and this is especially so for season 2.  I do not think that the creators of this series really knew what they would be in for by ending it on such a tremendous cliff hanger.  OMG! Talk about pushing the envelope!
The best recommendation I can give this series is that I have enjoyed seeing how the creators, actors, and so on have really done and made a serious effort to show knowledge of the books.  This is portrayed with a clever modern twist into each season.  Loads of fun!",1396224000,,950,4.405714285714286

If the show was only available free for a limited time that should have been clearly stated.  If Amazon is going to raise prime membership to $99 they had better be more competitive in this area.

4451436,5,B004QOB8SO,The have been more than a few great TV series that require patience to get involved. They have or had complex compelling characters but time was required to get to know them and care about them.  The rarer series is the one that grabs you and has you invested in the characters almost immediately and then the interest grows from there.

4451472,1,B004QOB8SO,"I know the fanbois and fanatics will just neg me to death. Guess what? I really don't give a flying poop.

Season 1 was awesome. There's nothing bad I can say about Season 1.

However...

Season 2 has all the great points about it that Season 1 had: lighting, costuming, camera-work, story, etc. That is, if you can get past that the tellyvision people want to give us less and less and charge us more and more. What next? A ""great"" show with one episode per season?

Here's the deal with Sherlock Season 2 and I know even Christians will neg the s--t out of me for saying it. But in Episode two, Watson and then the ear-guy say the very cliche, overused, and favorite expletive of Hollywood and tellyvision the world over: ""Jesus Christ.""

Every Brit I know cusses using ""Bloody Hell!"" or Bloody F-ing Hell!"" but Watson uses the favorite of fat producers of typical, cliche tellyvision. In episode two he sort of mumbles it. In episode three, he YELLS it. Not very British at all, which means they inserted it to insult what they really hate: Christ. To me, Sherlock descended to GARBAGE.

Lost all interest. Boring. Story had no meaning after that. Done. Shove it and all that. I won't be paying some fat laughing producer for another season of more insulting and cliche message. I don't see Muhammed used as an expletive. And neither do I see Abraham used as an expletive.

I enjoyed Season 1. Highly recommend it. For those of you Christians who do like hearing Jesus used as an expletive, then go ahead and buy Season 2. I will not be buying Season 3.",1395878400,2,1556,4.49645390070922

4451553,5,B004QOB8SO,"This series just keeps drawing you in more and more.  Didn't realize at the beginning if season one how many funny lines would go like zingers back and forth between Sherlock and Watson.  Hilarious at times, but you can't miss a word or you will miss the fun!  Sometimes the accent makes it hard to catch everything but if you're English then you're lucky!  Hard to follow the twists and the turns of the plots, so that's good for our brain challenge!",1395273600,,451,4.463414634146342

The English characteristics and respect still shine through giving you the feel of an era gone by.  The introduction of all the modern amenities (cell phones, internet, et. al) seem to fit in and find a place without becoming a distraction.  I don't know if that's because the world is now desensitized to those items and are now the foremost means of communications or if it's Sherlock's affable arrogance to it all.

Watsons social awkwardness and unrelenting admiration a of Holmes plays against the pomposity Holmes portrays throughout the show.  Freeman does an amazing job portraying Watson as Cumberbatch's straight,an for Sherlock.

Suffice it to say, the holds true to the old world elegance and charm while giving respect to modern world amenities.",1395273600,,852,5.182481751824818

With a sort of disappointment with Sherlock series 3, I keep going back to series 1 and 2,  which include the best of the best episodes:
Series 1:
* A Study in Prink (a fantastic and signature introduction of young Sherlock and Dr. Watson)
* The Great Game (a great display of Sherlock's wit and deductions in solving a pack of mysteries forced onto him)
Series 2:
* A Scandal in Belgravia (the woman, who's equally clever in the game)
* The Reichenbach Fall (the fall, and the tense buildup leading to it)

4451847,5,B004QOB8SO,This is a fantastic show!  The plot thickens with each new episode. Each episode is a bit lengthy which is probably why there are only 3 to 4 episodes per season for the first two seasons.,1394582400,,188,4.222222222222222

4451881,5,B004QOB8SO,Season One was a delight to watch.  Season Two picks up where the previous episode ended - and the joy of watching intelligent TV begins.  There's something about the way a series is made in the UK that doesn't demean the viewer.  The plot is complex and the underlying sub-text is ever present.  This is one of the only shows that makes you pay attention - for fear you will miss something important!  Love the Sherlock series.,1394582400,,428,4.5064935064935066

4451886,5,B004QOB8SO,"This show actually deserves more stars than I can give it.  I was skeptical at first about updating Sherlock Holmes to modern times, but was pleasantly surprised by Season One.  However, I was blown away by Season Two.  There are, again, just three episodes per season, but each one runs about an hour and a half, so its like having three mini-movies per season.  I guess that's okay and it's only my lust for more Sherlock that makes me wish for more in each season.

The plotlines are great--shocking at times, never ever boring and much of the time you find yourself surprised, which so rarely happens in tv shows most of the time.  The acting is absolutely terrific, especially the relationship shown between Sherlock and Watson.  While, Sherlock himself remains the central figure that verges on superhuman, but with all of the strengths he owns also reflecting themselves as his faults.  I adore the idea of his ""mind palace.""  I love how they've chosen to show us, the watcher, how his mind works...using words and arrows, etc to outline for us (poor normal mortals) how this brilliant madman thinks.  While Mycroft...oh my.

We are introduced to ""the woman"" in this season, the famous Adler, who comes the closest to being able to think like the Holmes brothers.  I loved this episode and how it ended, another shocker.  The Hound episode was interestingly updated, but I still think it was the weak point of the season.  In any other show, it would have been terrific, but not with the high standards set up by this.  While, the final episode was...oh dear...well, brilliant.  Yes, just absolutely brilliant.  It also proved that even Sherlock can be wrong as it shows us that he is not, as he stated in the first episode of the series, a ""high functioning sociopath,"" but a brilliant man who can't understand basic social skills--or can't care about them--who yet does care about people.

All I can say about Moriarty...he is one scary guy.  One profoundly scary guy.  One of the best villians in ages.

This show has now readily convinced me that not only does Sherlock work as set in modern times, but it even comes across as through it may, in some ways, fit more handily in modern times.  I mean, I could see how Sherlock's mind works can be compared to an intelligent computer network.  While, updating Watson's books to a blog--yes!  I also deeply enjoy the tongue-in-cheek way they sometimes poke at the Sherlock Myth (such as the cap).  They can get away with it because you also feel the deep respect in this show that they have for the work of Doyle and for the characters of Sherlock and Watson.

4451947,5,B004QOB8SO,"Sherlock Holmes set in modern times? You gotta be kidding me! How can you take Holmes out of the Victorian? Time and place are integral parts of the story.

As a major fan of the original stories and old Basil Rathbone films, the above thoughts and others all went through my mind when I stumbled on this series as an Amazon Prime recommendation. I sneered and was ready to pass it by until I started reading the reviews of others who'd watched it. I started to become really curious when one reviewer challenged skeptics to watch just fifteen minutes of Episode One of Season One and then shut it off. He practically guaranteed they wouldn't be able to.

Okay, I took the fifteen minute challenge and promptly went through the first two seasons on Prime in six consecutive nights. I was totally hooked. The reasons are, of course, the excellent writing and brilliant performances by Benedict Cumberbatch, Martin Freeman and the rest of the cast. I wouldn't have known either Cumberbatch or Freeman if I hadn't immediately recognized them from the last Star Trek film and the Hobbit. The chemistry these two have together is just amazing, Cumberbatch is utterly charismatic as Holmes. I've even begun re-reading some of short stories and novels to remind myself of what Holmes was like in Doyle's vision, and can honestly say that, despite the dislocation in time, Cumberbatch just nails him: brilliant, crazed, witty, even a bit borderline. And, of course, charming as hell.

In the end, I didn't even mind re-imagining Holmes as contemporary. In fact, it's a refreshing take and the way they've used and reworked recognizable material from some of the original stories is quite clever. I can't wait for Season 3.",1394236800,,1714,4.863013698630137

It literally left me swooning and craving more!",1393891200,,355,4.916666666666667
4452024,5,B004QOB8SO,Sherlock is one of my favorite shows!  I am so glad it is on Amazon Prime so I can watch it whenever I want.  Now if we can just convince them to make more than three episodes per season and not wait two years between season.,1393891200,,225,3.869565217391304

love  how they have  adapted to modern  day but still kept the characters true to Conan Doyle's
vision.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman  are a great match as Sherlock and Watson .
The supporting cast of Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, Irene Adler  and Moriarty  make this an exceptional
retelling of this wonderful adaptation of a legendary story that has survived many generations and
has now happily come to this one!!",1393804800,,517,4.895348837209302

4452085,5,B004QOB8SO,If there is one character that the Brits should do better than we Americans it's Sherlock...and in this case they deliver. Top notch casting with performances to match. Each episode feels more like a movie than a TV series.

4452112,5,B004QOB8SO,I just started watching Sherlock a couple weeks ago.  I like it so much I have been rapidly catching up on every episode.

4452114,5,B004QOB8SO,"Witty, entertaining and lots of fun, season two of Sherlock continues to bring this well written classic into our modern day world.
It's a smashing success due to the brilliant writing and the superb acting of Cumberbatch and Freeman. Watching these two verbally spar and interact, is equivalent to an Olympic table tennis gold medal match, between two equally matched, Chinese opponents!
It's my immense pleasure to watch these episodes over and over again; time well spent with old, literary friends come to life.",1393545600,,515,5.142857142857143

The return window expired December 6, obviously well before Christmas.  VERY disappointed that none of the discs will play in any of our Blu-ray players, including the PS3 and that - as the window has long expired - there is nothing we can do about it but suffer the loss.  I have ordered other Blu-ray region free sets and never had the issue I've had with these.

As for the show, which we wound up streaming through Amazon Prime to watch, it is great.",1393545600,,575,4.447619047619048
4452116,5,B004QOB8SO,"I was already hooked in season one, and now that extra plot lines are coming to light, I love it even more. I enjoyed Sherlock and Irene's relationship and seeing how Sherlock changes around her. Jim Moriarty becomes even creepier and I even believed him for a second in episode 3. Very manipulative and well done.",1393545600,,314,4.625
4452117,4,B004QOB8SO,Seemed to have lost its way into incomprehensibility at the end of Season 2 but season 3 has returned to comprehension and sparkling plots with the usual conceits that we find so comforting.,1393545600,,190,4.787878787878788
4452128,5,B004QOB8SO,"Great acting, awesome chemistry between the two leads, and clever writing. The creators pay homage to Arthur Conan Doyle while reinventing Sherlock Holmes for the 21st century. Plus, it's just plain fun.",1393545600,,203,5.375
4452129,5,B004QOB8SO,"I love this kind of intense, psychological action between characters along with fascinating puzzles. Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the most amazing actors I have ever seen and paired with Martin Freeman, the series characters are unbeatable. I own all 3 series presently available and hope there are more (although both stars seem very busy with other projects). They are they type of shows you can watch over and over again and still find new nuances, bits and pieces you had missed before. As I said in my title: Excellent TV for intelligent viewers.",1393545600,,553,4.8936170212765955

4452135,5,B004QOB8SO,We enjoy Sherlock immensely.  It is very clever and thought provoking.  The characters are multi-dimensionally and the interaction between them is quite entertaining.  This is by far my favorite interpretation of the characters from the books.  So much so that previously favored shows pale in comparison.  My one complaint is the long delays between seasons and that each season only had 3 episodes.,1393545600,,400,5.285714285714286
4452136,5,B004QOB8SO,Great show. Great acting. Wish there were more episodes to watch. Benedict makes a wonderful sherlock holmes abd his side kick. Mr watson is a hobbit.  Lol,1393545600,,155,4.7407407407407405

4452148,4,B004QOB8SO,"This is a neat show... it has a few very long episodes so it's one you need to be prepared to sit for a while to watch, but the season is very short. The characters are very quirky which I enjoy. The main characters are consistent and well developed, and all other characters are just minor roles that are there to pop in and out... not well developed and overall fairly unimportant. Sherlock is written in a unique way for an investigative show... as in you see him quickly pick up on all the clues all at once (the way this is shot is different).",1393545600,,548,4.228571428571429
4452149,5,B004QOB8SO,"The classic characters and how they are blended into modern life has been done brilliantly.

The acting in top shelf, the story lines are very excellent.

The key actors are to be commended, who would have thought they could find modern actors to rival Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce.

I also like how they have elevated Mycrofts role in this series, again another starring role done very well.

The only disappointment was when I discovered there was only 3 shows per season...",1393545600,,476,4.7682926829268295

4452177,5,B004QOB8SO,"I finally found an adaptation of these stories that - while it embraces the current technologies that people are using in their daily lives - it isn't overwhelmingly packed with special effects to the point that the story takes a back seat.  Additionally, the chemistry between Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman allows them to recreate that most famous of partnerships in a seemingly effortless manner.  I love it.  I think the best way to decide if you will like the series is to take the plunge and watch an episode.  Once I saw the first one (a Masterpiece Mystery episode on PBS) I caught up in the matter of two days.  I highly recommend a watch.",1393372800,,657,4.629310344827586
4452188,5,B004QOB8SO,"Great show. Well written and acted.
Allot a good chunk of time because each episode is about an hour and a half long (although there are only 3 episodes per seaon).
Season 2 of Sherlock is what any fan of season 1 would expect... and then some! I don't want to give too much away so I'll end this review by saying this: if you liked season 1, you'll love season 2; and if you loved season 2, you'll obsess over season 3; and then you'll wait with bated breath for season 4 (which I've heard we'll have to wait 2 years for!).",1393372800,,524,4.097087378640777

I love how total observation in the moment is depicted....to see things deeply...to pay attention to what is in front of us. It is magic. It is a tool and gift we all possess but we don't use fully because we are living in the past or looking to the future.

4452218,3,B004QOB8SO,"This is not about the series, but Amazon's method of shipping.

I am a recent fan of BBC's Sherlock, so I was incredibly excited about ordering the entire series from Amazon. With tax it cost nearly $100, but I really didn't mind. What I did mind was how I found Amazon had shipped all three series Blu-rays to me, crammed together in a single manilla packaging enevelope when previously they had shipped sizable orders like this to me in boxes with their contents safely secured with air-filled buffering packets. When my package arrived the enevelope had been partially torn open on the side, clearly making it's contents visible to anyone who handled the parcel. Season One's case has a minor chip on it, which I felt that I could overlook, but Season Two's case is another story. The plastic of the case is broken from the edge of the case almost all the way to the interior, and the plastic sleeve on the front is torn to about half it's length.

I am convinced that the poor shipping method used by Amazon is responsible for the condition of the Blu-ray cases. So this offering from amazon receives a mixed review from me. Five star for the series, but it's just great in my opinion, and one star for their negligence in shipping their products in a manner to ensure their all-around quality.

So buyers beware, keep an eye on your orders on how they are shipped to you and in what condition they are when you receive them.",1393372800,,1429,4.5310077519379846
4452219,5,B004QOB8SO,"This Sherlock series is simply stunning.  Brilliant writing, excellently paced and photographed and, at the center, two extraordinary actors -- Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman -- who breathe life and love into these two iconic characters.  What makes this series ( all three seasons to date) so spectacular is the core of a deep, loyal friendship between these two very dissimilar people.  Cumberbatch, as Sherlock, is the cleverest person in the room, although not the most likeable.  But in Benedict's hands, Sherlock is both clever and vulnerable, a deductive genius yet woefully unsure and uncomprehending of the human heart.  Martin Freeman as John Watson is the anchor; slower, perhaps, than the scintillating Sherlock at unraveling mysteries, but a staunch (if often annoyed) friend, the deep heart of the series, and a crack shot when the occasion presents itself.

Mark Gatiss as Mycroft is spot-on, and it is a delight to watch the co-creator of the series step in front of the camera as Sherlock's older, perhaps wiser, and definitely lonelier brother, who wistfully wishes he had a Watson of his own to befriend.  Una Stubbs as Mrs. Hudson is a delight; Rupert Graves is suitably mystified and exasperated as Lestrade.

I STRONGLY recommend that you watch all 3 seasons, but if you're contemplating just Season 2, A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA and  THE REICHENBACH FALL are stellar.  For whatever reason, I wasn't as enchanted with HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, even though it was one of my favorite Doyle stories.

4452377,5,B004QOB8SO,"just as good as the 1st season... love that the Euro TV times are so much longer than USA. Like I satiated in the 1st seasons review they are just short of an hour and a half for each episode, like a movie here in the states, and they are very well acted and written.",1392854400,,267,3.8727272727272726

4452382,5,B004QOB8SO,I loved it! I started watching the end of season 2 with my husband and had to see it from the begining.,1392768000,,103,3.727272727272727
4452383,5,B004QOB8SO,I am not a Downton Abbey fan so this is the tops of the my PBS list.  The writing is excellent and and the characters are never boring.,1392768000,,135,3.8214285714285716
4452384,5,B004QOB8SO,"This season's just as action packed as Season 1 was.  Can't wait to catch up on Season 3!  10/10, would recommend to anyone who's a fan of Sherlock Holmes, Martin Freeman, Benedict Cumberbatch, or all of the above.",1392768000,,214,4.605263157894737

I only wish I could figure out how to turn on subtitles so I could catch every word...",1392768000,,165,3.6857142857142855
4452387,4,B004QOB8SO,A good series.  Sherlock sometimes hard to follow when he analyzes things very fast.  Watson not quite in character--kind of boyish and a bit petulant.  Watson needs to be a bit slower on the draw and to follow more.,1392768000,,216,4.487179487179487
4452398,5,B004QOB8SO,"Brilliant show! The first season was great, but the second season is even better.  Can't wait to watch season 3!",1392768000,,112,4.6

4452400,5,B004QOB8SO,"This is one of the best shows I have ever seen in terms of its structure and substance. It is well-written, and engaging from start to finish. The episodes are like short-films (though some get pretty close to 1.5 hours). I think this show is ideal for anyone tired of the mundane and thoughtless content that has plagued television broadcast for quite some time. If you haven't seen the first season, I'd recommend watching this before you view this one, obviously, as there is a lot to appreciate about the characters that is built on the first season. I nearly knocked out two seasons in one day--if this gives you an indication to how much I enjoyed this :)",1392768000,,661,4.563025210084033
4452401,5,B004QOB8SO,"Seasons 1, 2 and 3 are all beyond excellent!  I am rarely pleased with movies or TV shows that are based upon books but Sherlock is by far an exception to that rule!  Congratulations to Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat and to the actors involved in the show who make it true to the Arthur Conan Doyle books but also make the show contemporary and easy to believe.  Kudos!",1392768000,,368,4.304347826086956
4452402,5,B004QOB8SO,"Sherlock is a smart, lively-paced, and excellent modernization of these Conan-Doyle characters!  So much so it makes CBS' Elementary, seem so elementary!",1392768000,,153,5.954545454545454
4452403,5,B004QOB8SO,"The acting is absolutely superb. Both characters of dr Watson and Sherlock are so vivid, exciting and vulnerable. Love the connection between them. It was heartbreaking to see john in grief at the end of the season. Plots are superb. I really enjoyed watching the season and would love to see it again",1392768000,,301,4.69811320754717
4452404,5,B004QOB8SO,"My reasons are the same as season three. But, THREE EPISODES A SEASON? Yes, I know quality over quantity. Just don't make us wait two years!",1392768000,,140,4.423076923076923
4452405,5,B004QOB8SO,Such a clever show. It's very addictive-- I watched the first two seasons in three days. The  actors are so talented and I just love the modern twists on classic literature.,1392768000,,173,4.580645161290323
4452406,4,B004QOB8SO,"Great show! Little too expensive. If this show hadn't been an hour and a half I wouldn't have bought it. I guess I'm just kind of cheap, but this show had me hooked so I guess that says something. Anyways 4stars because of price.",1392768000,,229,4.2272727272727275

4452421,5,B004QOB8SO,"This is a very well done SH, top class performances by the actors and intriguing plots. You will truly begin to hate the protagonist, Moriarty, who plays his role smug and psychotic. My favorite is John Watson who balances an almost too robotic Holmes. All in all, well done!",1392681600,,275,4.63265306122449
4452422,5,B004QOB8SO,"Sherlock series two is absolute fun, both for fans of the classic Sherlock Holmes stories and those who have yet to read Dr. Watson's narratives. The BBC's updated version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tales keeps the viewer on his or her toes with witty dialogue, plenty of nods to the original stories, and stunning cinematography.

Episodes 1 and 3 are especially good, but their modern take on the famous ""hound"" case is still more than entertaining. Cumberbatch is fantastic.",1392681600,,249,5.097560975609756
4452427,5,B004QOB8SO,"Best version of Sherlock Holmes ever, either Movies or TV.  It's also just a great show period.  Season 2 is even better than season 1 and that was hard to top!

From start to finish, each episode is an absolute pleasure--from the superb acting, to the little in-jokes, to the elegance of the entire production.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are wonderful as they portray the friendship between Holmes and Watson.  It's easy to understand what the two saw and received and gave to each other.  The marvelous acting is not limited to the two principal characters:  Andrew Scott, who plays Moriarty, is perfect:  I disliked his character so much that I loved him--he was splendid.  I admire the performances of every actor in the series--even those who are mean to Holmes, whom I adore.

4452596,5,B004QOB8SO,I find Sherlock to be a great show.  I'm always enjoying the plots and the humor.  I feel they really picked good actors for the roles.  Just realized the other day that the actor for John Watson is the actor for Bilbo Baggins in the Hobbit.  He does a great in both roles.,1392422400,,273,4.09433962264151

4452609,5,B004QOB8SO,"Loving this series, it is brilliantly written and modernized, but still faithful to the original.  I think Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would watch this, if he were alive today.",1392422400,,171,4.896551724137931
4452610,5,B004QOB8SO,This season of Sherlock has one of the top episodes to date. I enjoyed all of them but as with all television shows there are those episodes which stand out. I look forward to watching Sherlock for many more seasons.,1392422400,,216,4.425
4452611,3,B004QOB8SO,This show is absolutely the BEST.  Funny Smart Obsessive!  BUT this Blu-ray that I ordered here WAS NOT playable in an American Blueray player.  So BEWARE.  Yes get this Blu-ray and ALL of the series.  BUT NO not here!  FYI  Ordered a DVD on Amazon of season 1 and it worked fine.....Amazon is taking fake Blu-ray back without a problem thankfully,1392422400,,347,4.590163934426229
4452612,4,B004QOB8SO,"My initial reaction to this series was decidedly mixed, for while I could appreciate the utterly brilliant manner in which the characters have been updated to the 21st Century, I felt that to a large extent the characters themselves had been transformed too much, so they really weren't modern equivalents of the canonical Holmes, Watson, etc., but rather new ones using the old names. As it has continued into a second season, however, Sherlock has to my mind pulled back from that error, though just a tad -- Holmes, to my taste, still comes off as rather too immature and heedless of others. Still, any stretch of, say, ten minutes in this series is usually a delight to witness. The repartee is marvelous, the fit of the ensemble together quite wonderful, and the additional tics and touches applied just right. The huge problem for me, however, is that the stories are altogether horrible: Muddled, disjointed, stretching credulity, and -- fatally for anything involving Sherlock Holmes -- illogical. The best example in this set is ""The Hounds of Baskerville."" I don't want to strew spoilers, so I won't be specific, but this story includes convenient lapses in security, unexplained generosity by the villain, unexplained incongruities, and more. Looking back on it, I find that most of the story simply makes little or no sense. So in the end, for me, it depends on how much I value plot as well as character, and the fact is that I do. I've come round to accepting and even becoming fond of the revamped characters, and I've always appreciated the wit and invention of the series. Judging on those qualities alone, I'd give this five stars, period. The bad storytelling, however, bump it down to 3.5 stars for me. I'm going to record four, out of love for the characters, but if you are a Holmes purist and/or a stickler for a good plot, consider it to really be a three.",1392422400,,1880,4.752293577981652
4452613,2,B004QOB8SO,"I have every Sherlock Holmes episode made, however this last production revealed a inspector gadget mentality applied in the worst way. They should get back to reasonable deduction rather than scientific illusions.",1392422400,,214,5.71875
4452614,5,B004QOB8SO,"Season 2 definitely builds on the foundation Season 1 began.  We see some of the more famous characters and stories in this season with Irene Adler, the hound of the Baskervilles, and Moriarty.  Even having read the original stories, I was still engrossed in each story, seeking to see what they changed and how things would end in a more modern setting.  The season highlight is probably the final episode with a really fun storyline pitting mastermind against mastermind in a battle to see who is the superior intellect.",1392422400,,522,4.842696629213483
4452615,5,B004QOB8SO,This show is a must see. It's absolutely brilliant and wonderfully acted. The chemistry between Benedict and Martin is amazing. I love to watch them. Definitely one of my top favorites shows,1392336000,,190,4.96875

I especially like the guy that plays Moriarty...he scares the bejesus out of me.  He is a credit to the acting guild.  More of this, please.  Also, the actress that plays Irene Adler is just as brilliant.  An exceptional cast.",1392336000,,344,4.633333333333334

4452630,5,B004QOB8SO,If you liked the first season of Sherlock then you will love the second season.  Great stories in all 3 episodes.  Sherlock and Watson's friendship evolves and they feed off each other quite well.,1392336000,,196,4.735294117647059
4452631,5,B004QOB8SO,"The hit BBC series that brilliantly reinvents Arthur Conan Doyle's literary hero for the 21st century is back. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman return as the timeless duo of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson (the best since Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke). While the first season of Sherlock was pretty good, Season Two takes the series to new heights. This time the series goes all the way using the grandest of subjects from the Holmes canon they include Irene Adler, The Hound, and Moriarty as shown in these episodes:

A Scandal in Belgravia - An adult reimaging of ""A Scandal in Bohemia."" In my opinion Laura Polver is by far the best actress to play the dubious Irene Adler. Her Irene is dark, sexy, and three-dimensional. This manages to be an exhilarating romp with twists and turns. Not to mention one of the most touching and character driven episodes in this show so far. It marks a high point making ""Sherlock"" go from being merely interesting to truly stunning.

The Hounds of Baskerville - Many didn't like this reinterpretation of the classic crime tale but I was perfectly fine with it. The atmosphere was very good as was the photography and location work. The plot is more straightforward and less complicated than most episodes but it was still compelling nonetheless. The conclusion to all is clever and satisfying (and if you notice it mirrors that of the original story's). Although, I will state that the CGI for the Dog was poor.

The Reichenbach Fall - Inspired by ""The Final Problem"", this finale is immensely and perversely entertaining, full of audacious plotting with an ending that leaves will leave you with much to talk about. Andrew Scott is dazzling and creepy as Holmes's arch-nemesis, Jim Moriarty. The direction by Toby Haynes is colorful and creative as well (I especially love the use of music).

The 90-minute running time for each one makes them feel like they are movies. It gives it a magnificent sense of scale and scope. If the series followed the usual one hour format for TV shows it would seem like your usual crime procedural. A larger than life character like Holmes is worthy of an epic format. As co-creator Steven Moffat himself said ""Other detectives have cases, Sherlock Holmes has adventures and that's what matters."" Despite being only three episodes long it leaves you both satisfied and wanting more.

With emotion, chills and thrills, controversy, and further character development (as it really shows the friendship between Sherlock and John). Sherlock Season Two is great television. I certainly look forward to what the show's makers have in store in the third season and to see if they are able to top (or at least equal) themselves.",1392336000,,2705,4.897379912663755

4452649,5,B004QOB8SO,"This is the most meaningful portrayal of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson I've ever seen. I love mysteries and I'm a voracious reader,, but I've never quite understood the long term popularity of the Sherlock Holmes stories.  Now I do. This portrayal of Watson, for example, gives some meaning to their relationship. He's not just a buffoon. And Sherlock's brilliance is much clearer to me now. basil Rathbone's brooding, sullen Sherlock was never very engaging to me. He made those razor sharp observation skills seems tedious and depressing--like he was burdened with them. This Sherlock delights in them.

This has been a fun series to watch, patterned very similar to Robt Downey Jrs movie renditions of Sherlock in turns of flow and style.

Great job done by our British counterparts!! I do have one complaint but let me explain. The seasons are only 3 episodes long. Granted that the length of each episode is 1 1/2 hours, commercial free. That would only equate to six regular episodes of normally run seasons. Now that they have a following and  an expectant audience, it's time to up the game so to speak and expand the amount of episodes before going dark into the off season.

The characters are developing more of a connection to each other. Watson seems to be the only fully sane character in this franchise. Of course,being familiar with the Sherlock Holmes stories over the years,I've seen quite a few renditions on film. Previous Sherlock versions,either print or film,were too dry for my taste.

4452717,5,B004QOB8SO,"If you enjoy A.C. Doyle's masterful characterization of Sherlock Holmes, you will absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes.  It is a joy to watch in real time Sherlock's process of deduction where he is put in the scenes of crimes while they happen and watch evidence zoom into focus.  The show is fast paced, amusing, intellectual with just enough of the Doyle original ""script"" to capture the attention of the most die-hard Doyle fan.",1392163200,,442,4.95945945945946

4452729,5,B004QOB8SO,"I was all set to hate this show after having been spoiled by J. Brett so many years ago and more recently by R.Downey Jr. but I really like the new look and take. I also like how they have taken the original stories and recaste them in a modern context. Watson for example writes a BLOG about his adventures with Sherlock and this brings notoriety and unwanted attention. martin freeman is fabulous as Watson and B. Cumberbatch is terrific as Sherlock (Quirky, intense and underhanded). This has become one of my favorites..",1392163200,,524,4.645161290322581

4452731,5,B004QOB8SO,An interesting take on Sherlock Holmes and crew. Watson is smarter and a more likely companion to Sherlock than he is in the books. Modern and yet traditional. I love this show!,1392163200,,177,4.5625

4452763,5,B004QOB8SO,The actors were well-chosen for their roles in the story. Benedict Cumberbatch does a great job portraying a slightly neurotic detective and Martin Freeman is so believeable in his very patient and caring Dr. Watson role.  The cases are fun and the references to modern day things like blogging and cell phone are hilarious. I highly recommend the series!,1392076800,,355,5.016949152542373
4452764,5,B004QOB8SO,"I absolutely love this show. The acting is fantastic, as is the editing. The chemistry between Cumberbatch and Martin continues to light up the screen.

4452781,5,B004QOB8SO,I've recommended Sherlock to anyone I encounter. I only wish there were more seasons and episodes to enjoy. Benedict Cumberbatch is a thrill to watch.,1392076800,,150,5.04

4452804,4,B004QOB8SO,I've always liked the actors and their characters but it took until the second season for the writers and directors to catch up with this program's potential. There is so much to comprehend that it takes me two viewings to get it all. Fun show.,1391990400,,244,4.444444444444445

4452810,5,B004QOB8SO,I think the relationship between Sherlock and Watson is perfection!  The wit of Benedict Cumberbatch and the calm/reservedness of John Freeman makes for a perfect pair.  Although the First Season was the best --- the series continues to entertain and do NOT disappoint.,1391990400,,269,5.232558139534884
4452811,5,B004QOB8SO,"Cumberbatch has this way of making so many different expressions with his face that he hardly needs to speak, but, oh, when he does speak, it is such a joy!  He is so brilliant, hilarious and ever so close to having Asperger's, which makes him only more endearing.  In Season 2, we see ""Sherlock"" evolve emotionally to grasp the finer points of understanding the humans around him that he hasn't always grasped or has easily dismissed.

The writing for this show is spectacular, as is the character-development.  I am completely hooked!  I had tired of the old-fashioned ""Sherlock Holmes"" interpretations, so this show is utterly fresh, captivating and very interesting.  I like the new interaction b/w Dr. Watson (as well as Dr. Watson's back story) and Sherlock, as well.  Much more contemporary and crisp.  I highly recommend checking out this updated tale.  It is outstanding and highly entertaining, while also incorporating the subtle sides of human relationships.  It is one of my new favorite TV shows!",1391990400,,1010,5.030120481927711

I'm not expecting it to go downhill in the future but, who knows. Challenges the intellect.

4452897,5,B004QOB8SO,The writing is superb.  Benedict and Martin continue their sleuthing amidst their quirky friendship.  I've begun to believe that Sherlock just might be in the autism spectrum; he's so dead honest at the detriment of the feelings of others.  And what can we say about dearest Molly; she needs to find a new crush.,1391817600,,312,4.7407407407407405

4452943,5,B004QOB8SO,"In Season 2, it seemed as if the writers, directors, and actors had settled into their parts...almost TOO settled, though.  While it was still an incredible season, the humor wasn't as obvious (but was still obvious enough for the audience to know they were supposed to be having a laugh) and the drama was a bit too dramatic.  They needed to either dump the humorous bits and go for pure drama (a la Jeremy Brett's extraordinary version of Sherlock), or lighten up on the dramatic aspects and work on the humor a bit more.

Still, well worth the watching.",1391817600,,556,4.595959595959596
4452944,5,B004QOB8SO,"Season Two carries on from the suspenseful ending of Season One. Moriarty is a great villain. Love the way the characters, Sherlock and John Watson, continue to grow and once again, the very last show brings me to want even more from them.  A great cliff hanger ending! I'm a huge fan and can't wait for my newest season addition.",1391731200,,330,4.5
4452945,5,B004QOB8SO,"There are very few new TV shows out there that have been able to catch my interest, but SHERLOCK is definitely one that I'm hooked on. After watching a first few episodes from SHERLOCK SEASON 1 for free (because of Prime membership) on my Kindle, I knew this was a show that I could get into and so I bought the first season on Blu-Ray.

SHERLOCK SEASON TWO continues on with the great formula that they started in the first season with the graphic embellishments and updating the original stories to match a modern context. Chemistry between Holmes (Cumberbatch) and Watson (Freeman)-- and consequently their relationship -- continues to evolve and there's a shocking cliff hanger on the last episode ""The Reichenbach Fall,"" but I won't give it away.

Anyway, definitely pick this up if you like well-acted, brilliantly written, and cunningly executed TV shows. Although there are only three episodes in this season, they run about 90-minutes each (about the length of a feature film), so it doesn't feel like you're being short changed.

BONUS CONTENT

""Sherlock Uncovered"" -- Featurette 19:06-minutes
Shows behind-the-scenes footage and has interviews with cast and producers, including Cumberbatch and Freeman, and the show's co-creators and Executive Producers Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss (Mycroft Holmes).

Even if you're a fan of the classic Sherlock Holmes movies -- which I love -- that starred Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, or even the new ones with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law, I believe that you'll enjoy this incarnation with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.

I can't wait to get SHERLOCK SEASON THREE, which I already pre-ordered, and I hope that this show will continue on for many more seasons.",1391731200,,1726,5.081272084805653
4452946,4,B004QOB8SO,"I reluctantly began watching Sherlock. I have seen many interpretations of the book; been there - done that (yawn). However, I now must admit to being hooked! The writing is very good and the characters well drawn. Although Sherlock is occasionally portrayed just a little too odd-but-brilliant. The end of Season 2 left me absolutely wanting more. Definitely recommend.",1391731200,,370,5.288135593220339

4452958,5,B004QOB8SO,"This series is very well written, the writers have tried to infuse their own unique flavor to it while also staying true to Arthur Conan Doyle's works. The dialogues are great and the comedy timing is perfect. Loved Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson; the chemistry between the two on screen is entertaining.

Also the text 'overlays' onscreen (I don't know the correct term) to illustrate SHerlock's thoughts; very well done without being overdone.

4452979,5,B004QOB8SO,"It is extremely rare for me to like a classic that is modernized to a different time period or place. I consider it an insult to the author. There are many changes to what resonates as Sherlock Holmes to me.  However, the acting by Cumberbatch, Freeman, and the rest of the ensemble cast just makes it entertaining to watch. I can overlook the changes in character to such as Moriarty, Irene Adler, LeStrade, et al. It's well worth the viewing time.",1391644800,,449,4.54320987654321

4452981,5,B004QOB8SO,I had missed the first season by clicking on this show but it was still great.  Later I got the first 2 episodes of season 1 but they also were great.  It is a modern take on the deductive master and his sidekick.  Somehow they make a very unlikeable personality someone that others can root for in addtion to Watson.,1391644800,,317,4.25

While keeping the plot serious there's a lot of levity; you will wring yours hands and laugh out loud at the same scene.  The plot twists and turns so often you can get dizzy yet everything ties together in a truly fun and wonderfully way.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would give these new episodes five stars and two thumbs-up at the same time. If you have ever liked Sherlock Holmes you will love this!,1391558400,,601,4.445454545454545

4453021,5,B004QOB8SO,"I'm a first time viewer of this program. But after watching episode 1 of the third season (which just ended on PBS) I was at first confused and delighted by this British versions new adaptations & twists on the Conan Doyle stories.
So after watching the beginning of season 3 I had to get up to speed with the story line.
What better way to do so with my Amazon Prime Video on my smart TV. Being it was my day off and a bitterly cold day here in Lincoln NE, I used this misfortune to spend the day with Holmes and Watson before moving on to the rest of Season 3.
The more I watched it the more I loved it.
I especially liked The Hounds of the Baskervilles. Long been my favorite Holmes story no matter who the actors are and this new adaption is no exception. I did feel however that this story should have been shown in season 1 instead of season 2
.Also loved Irene Adler. In this version she's more like the Irene in the Robert Downey JR. movies.
Although I used my Amazon Prime membership to catch up for free, I do plan to purchase these to add to my collection. :)",1391472000,,1070,4.124401913875598

 for everything. Casting, acting, music, effects, locations, writing.

I read all the Sherlock Holmes mysteries when I was a teenager. I'm impressed at the way this TV series captures the spirit and story lines of the books, but brings it into modern times, with smart phones and computers.

Watching it on amazon is great because you can turn on closed captioning and catch every morsel of dialog.

This modern update, unlike the show Elementary, is set in London still providing some old-world appeal.

4453068,5,B004QOB8SO,"this is a very good update of Dr. Doyle's famous detective. the series has the tone and feel of original Doyle stories in a modern environment. this is truly the best Holmes update i have ever seen. a nice addition are the pop-up clues to give you the same view as Holmes as he is making his deductions. the dialogue is crisp. the writing would make Sir Arthur Conan Dyle very proud. Cumberbatch's is a wonderful combination of intensity and classic Holmes obnoxiousness and impatience. this is a must see for fan of Sherlock Holmes.
even if you are not a big fan of the detective of detectives, the stories move at a good pace and provide entertaining twists consistently.
the more you know about Holmes, the more you will enjoy all the episodes and all the seasons.",1391385600,,767,4.565217391304348

4453070,5,B004QOB8SO,"I am new to this version of Sherlock Holmes. To be honest I didn't get into this series because I thought that Holmes was just being stretched to far what with the Downey/ Law movie versions and the CBS television show. I love Guy Ritchie's take on the detective and love both movies. Looking forward to the third. The CBS television show has grown on me and I now watch it as well. What finally drew me in was the stars. I first saw Cumberbach (Sherlock) on the 2nd installment of J.J. Abrams revision of ""STAR TREK - INTO DARKNESS"" and absolutely was awed at Mr. Cumberbach's performance. And I soon followed that with his performance in ""TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE"". Second was Martin Freeman who I remember from the original British series ""THE OFFICE"" and then I saw his wonderful performance as Bilbo Baggins in ""THE HOBBIT"" films. All of this exposure inevitably forced me to check out episode one of the SHERLOCK series.
I was absolutely freaking blown away by the first season's episodes and then came ""A Scandal In Belgravia"" I haven't been this engrossed in watching a film as this one had me in quite a long time. Absolutely freaking perfect. The story, the acting, the whole package.
I love this show and hope in goes on for many years to come. I have read every Arthur Conan Doyle story so I am not a fly by night fan. I was very satisfied with this version and now I believe that the greatness of these characters can span all timelines and all types of senarios.
Well done to the creators of this series and the writing is inspired.
I will recommend this to everyone that I know.",1391385600,,1589,4.463917525773196

We had thought Elementary was by far one of the best series currently available. However, after watching Sherlock and then watching Elementary, it seemed that though Elementary is very good and we will continue to watch it; Sherlock is actually better! The fast pace and large quantity of content in each episode make it even better than Elementary!",1391385600,,456,5.175675675675675

4453104,5,B004QOB8SO,My granddaughter introduced me Sherlock Season 1 and I was hooked. I went through that season like a starving woman in a soup kitchen. I then went to Season 2 and was caught up again. Sherlock was still Sherlock but they added some comedy to the stories. I am 70 and read all the Sherlock Holmes books when I was young so I'm delighted with this series. I'm now into the 3rd Season and I can't wait for the next episode.,1391299200,,420,4.197530864197531

4453199,5,B004QOB8SO,"This television series is a treat. I am a television director myself and this series is one of the better produced, shot and edited TV shows that I have seen in quite some time.

Season Two continues the ongoing battle between Sherlock Holmes and his arch enemy Moriarty. There is exceptional production value woven into every episode. With only three episodes produced each season, and running 90 minutes each (with no commercials!), this is a visual feast to watch on Amazon Prime. If you like twists and turns, and enjoy the metal challenge of trying to figure out where the writers are leading the viewer, this show will satisfy your own need to be the detective and figure out the clues.

The acting is terrific. Benedict Cumberbatch (aka the villain ""Khan"" in the latest Star Trek movie) and Martin Freeman (aka ""Bilbo"" in the Hobbit movies) are sublime together. The dialogue is fast-paced (be prepared to rewind your DVR!), the lighting superb. The care and crafting of each shot is something you can study and appreciate.  Great thought and care goes into staging every scene in this series.

Special effects are subtle, not overdone, and carefully bring this timeless series into modern day without being intrusive.

All in all, this is a show you can clear your busy schedule for, then sit down and enjoy 90 minutes of uninterrupted viewing pleasure.",1391212800,2,1361,4.874458874458875

The great thing about this series is that you can go back and re-watch an episode without getting bored.  Inevitably I will notice details I missed the first time around and come to appreciate the attention to detail and subtle references to the original stories all the more.  Each episode plays like a short film; there are so many plot twists and details. I highly recommend checking out this series.

Watching him spar with Lara Pulver (Irene Adler) is a feast for the eyes and ears. The writing is very clever and absolutely brilliant, especially in this first episode of Season 2.

We are not crazy about Moriarty but the interaction between Sherlock and John is just great. Season 3 is not offered in Amazon prime so we can't watch that yet without paying per episode but season 1 and 2 we highly reccommend,1390953600,,325,4.344262295081967

It is our hope that they do not ruin the series by placing Sherlock in a relationship with anyone other then Watson or leave him as asexual with occasional innuendos as to his dalliances and preference in partners which was done in several episodes and gave us  hardy belly laughs, thank you. It would ruin the flavor of the series in our opinion.",1390953600,,510,4.483870967741935

4453286,4,B004QOB8SO,"I look to season 2 of Sherlock with high expectations. The use of editing techniques taken from Mr. Downey and Mr. Law's version of ""Sherlocke Holmes"" did not add IMHO to the quality of the show. I did particularly enjoy the character of Molly who came into her own this season. Mrs Hudson was very good also. Moriarty was traveling the edge of over the top. definitely maniacal but almost absurd like something akin to the villains in Batman. A better Moriarty then the one in ""Elementary"", though not as pretty. Still I gave it a four stars because the show is still better than any contemporary offerings.",1390867200,,608,4.638888888888889

4453291,5,B004QOB8SO,"Sherlock Holmes, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways - Jeremy Brett, Robert Downey Jr., Robert Stephens, Nicole Williamson, and so many more. Now, added to this list is Benedict Cumberbatch as the quirky brainiac detective whisking his way through the soft white underbelly of dastardly criminals and their henious deeds.  It is evident the writers did their research; many of the great lines and scenes from other Holmes offerings, as well as Conan Doyle's original portrayal of thr character, are presented in fine updated form. As Holmes is portrayed in real time, his use of modern gagetry is totally applicable. Watson, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, and the supporting hosts are well developed and the choice of supporting cast is replete with chemistry! The scenery is wonderful and the use of CG is tastefully minimal, but not without contextual merit. With great enthusiasm for the series I echo the famous Holmsian line, ""The game is afoot!""",1390867200,,950,5.006329113924051

4453305,5,B004QOB8SO,I'm sad that there are so few episodes in each season.  I love the quirky writing in these shows.  I never know how they're going to end.  The chemistry between Sherlock and Dr. Holmes cracks me up.  They are goofy and serious.  My husband and I both really enjoy these.,1390867200,,270,4.32

So when I started watching the Cumberbatch/Freeman BBC take my bar was set high. And they definitely delivered in spades. The 3 episode season was paced very well, and you get 1hr 30mins of great hijinks and crime solving shenanigans. Cumberbatch and Freeman are such great fits for the roles I wouldn't have minded if the seasons had been 6 episodes long!

I can't recommend this series enough.",1390867200,,622,4.594594594594595

4453310,4,B004QOB8SO,"Sherlock has been an amazing example of good people having a great time writing and producing television to their own satisfaction. When the Executive Producer plays Mycroft, Watson's new wife is his real-life partner, and Sherlock's parent's are Mr. and Mrs. Cumberbatch, you can see how much fun everyone is having.

Season 2 was a step down in many ways: I had the impression that the producers were amazed at the reception to the first season and took a lot bad advice from television ""experts."" They dumbed it down, removed a lot of the visual gimmicry, and generally acted like professional TV Hacks. Luckily, they seemed to have realized their mistakes by Season Three.

Even with that criticism, Season 2 is so good it blows any competition away--certainly the pale imitation that's Elementary on US TV.",1390867200,,811,4.955882352941177

4453313,5,B004QOB8SO,"I've enjoyed every episode. Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock can be unimaginably insensitive, but somehow he comes off as a brilliant but flawed character whose childhood must have been very painful. His foil, Martin Freeman's Dr. Watson whose flaws make him so human and I think very humane. The combination of the two make for an amazingly well balanced production. I've always thought of the original Dr. Watson as a bit of a buffoon and much prefer Freeman's take on the character, but true to Sherlock form Cumberbatch is arrogant and very self involved, with a little bit of juvenile fun thrown in. All in all and exceptionally good team and wonderful show with very inventive story lines!",1390867200,,694,4.991379310344827

4453338,4,B004QOB8SO,Storylines are usually somewhat more complex and Sherlocks deductive skills are usually interestingly woven in well.

Each episode opens the door a bit wider, revealing a little more about the complex psyches of Holmes and Watson. In no other film adaptation of Doyle's mysteries has more been done to illuminate the lead characters. Holmes is no loner a monolithic, humorless sociopath and Dr. Watson finally gets to shed his historic simpleton image.

Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock Holmes) is one of the coolest people on this planet, and he shows it in this series. He and Martin Freeman (Dr. Watson) have great chemistry and they deliver great comedic relief and are able to be serious with each other as well. This show will keep you on the edge of your seat with intense stories and a very artistic directing style. I'm a huge fan of this show and I  highly recommend it.

I'm on the second season and so far there is no on-screen violence or gory scenes that make me so nauseous I have to look away holding my stomach and I appreciate that.

4453416,2,B004QOB8SO,"I loved all the other Sherlock episodes, but why did you do this to Irene Adler?  Can't we have a female protagonist who isn't a twisted, sordid sex object?  On the very off chance that Steven Moffat or Mark Gratiss checks these reviews, I plead that you do insert a female love interest for Sherlock at some point, but that she be someone of substance and character - a brilliant personality with a brilliant mind who can elevate Sherlock into a ""good"" man while keeping him constantly on his toes - without the focus on sex.  That will be a true challenge.  Can these brilliant writers make a real person who is a woman, as opposed to some distorted caricature of a woman to which a shell of a personality is appended?

Besides, children like to watch these shows as well, as this episode is NOT appropriate for kids.

So when this first came out on Master Piece heater I turned the channel to find Doc Martin and ended up watching something so boring I fell asleep.  Same thing happened the following week.  The third week we were snowed in and I wasn't getting any channels except PBS!  ha...ha... So I reluctantly watched this episode and after the first ten minutes I was hooked!  :D

The actor in this movie takes the two dimensional Sherlock Holmes from the novels and makes him a living breathing mystery.  One moment I think he's a typically sterotyped egotistical male expecting everyone including Watson to fall at his feet and then the next moment he's vulnerable and I want to comfort him and tell everyone to back off and let him just have a nervous breakdown in peace.  Then he bounds back in another twist of suspense and you find out he's back to his usual antics.

The music is brilliant - music is a big deal in a show for me and it sets the mood and the tone of what's to come - the characters certainly started to grow on me - Sherlock, Watson, Mycroft and even Moriarti. Love the dry English humor and the problem solving mode Sherlock gets into and you know what? I don't think he's as big a jerk as people make him out to be. Geniuses have to put up with mediocre minds, and unless we know what that's like, we can't judge. He's still a wonderful human being and I'm rating this show a high 5 stars.

I use these programs to help students learn how to construct screenplays: what to consider, how to develop characters, how to construct and view camera angles, etc.

Aside from the academic enjoyment, I truly love the manner by which Cumberbatch and Freeman interact.  It is also fantastic that Mycroft plays such an important role in the series.  Highly recommended.  Will be purchasing third season soon.

4453482,5,B004QOB8SO,"It appears I have been living under a rock.  How on earth this modern day version of Sherlock Holmes managed to get past me is the real mystery.  This is so brilliantly done I honestly don't know where to start.

Surprises abound.  Mycroft Holmes is portrayed very differently from the actual books.  Why the writers decided to make him Sherlocks puppeteer is another mystery.  In fact in Season one when John is abducted my original thought was that it was Moriarty.  Oh so wrong was I.  And the other interesting point is where a brief mention was made regarding Sherlock having Aspergers Syndrome.  I have to admit Im not sure this is in Season Two or One because I watched them back to back.  Still I had never heard or noticed this having been mentioned.

The ending of Season Two was a cliffhanger and I was so glad I only had to wait a short time to find out the fate of Sherlock since I did stream Seasons One and Two on Amazon.  Dont miss this jewel.  The best part of watching this series either on Masterpiece Theater, streaming on your favorite app or watching the DVD is NO COMMERICIALS!  Much more enjoyable experience.  Thank you Amazon Prime.",1390435200,,1158,4.5

While the material and plot lines are familiar, they are treated with twists and turns that make the story seem fresh and hold-on to-your-seat exciting. The actors chosen are superb, and the director has allowed them ample freedom to create the right amount of tension between them. Even arch enemies are intriguing. Whereas in the past I would normally mute or leave the room when an uncomfortable scene is unfolding, I am drawn to simply hide behind my hands and peek through fingers so as not to miss what is surely to be a head scratcher.  Fun fun fun !!",1390348800,,655,4.695652173913044
4453489,5,B004QOB8SO,"SOOOO much better than ""Elementary.""  Best contemporary interpretation, best character & actor dymanics (unlike Lucy Lui who in my opinion seriously lacks any emotional range - poor Jonny Lee Miller he is so good normally - I only watch it for him).

4453495,5,B004QOB8SO,"Benedict Cumberbatch nails the persona of Sherlock.  I've seen a lot of adaptations - both movie and TV.  Benedict does an awesome job.  He and Martin Freeman have a chemistry that make the modern duo very believable.  I've always loved the Jeremy Brett characterization of Sherlock Holmes from the 1980s BBC Masterpiece Theater series as one of the most true to Conan Doyle's original works.  What makes the Sherlock series work, is that while they have kept the essence of the characters, the writers have completely brought the series into the 21st century.  I think Conan Doyle would approve.  My only complaint - there aren't enough episodes!",1390348800,,647,4.990654205607477

I am 70 so have been through several iterations of Sherlock and when I heard that PBS had broadcast another British version, I was in.  I hurried to watch seasons 1 and 2 on Amazon streaming before season 3 started and have just finished.  I have taped the first episode of season 3 off of PBS and can't wait to watch it.  1 and 2 were just excellent and quite a cliff-hanger at the end of 2.

4453512,5,B004QOB8SO,I love Sherlock.  It is an innovative 21st Century approach to a time-honored classic in which Moffat and Gatiss pay particularly close attention to staying true to Doyle's' creation while making it relevant to a modern day TV viewing audience.,1390262400,,244,5.1
4453513,5,B004QOB8SO,"The first episode was definitely my favorite--Irene Adler may just be Sherlock's match. The next episode was a little scary. I would suggest not watching it right before bed.

4453514,5,B004QOB8SO,"This series turns the traditional view of Sherlock Holmes on it's head.  A character who was a calm, logical detective is now a wild-eyed, logical, maniac whose observations and deductions operate in an almost auto-hypnotic mode, out of his control, obeying the siren call of the inevitable conclusion.  You can almost see the adrenalin coursing through Holmes' veins driving him onward to the next head rush of uncovering the truth.

This, of course, wears down the viewer.  Ah, too much excitement.  This guy is no Columbo, inexorably zeroing in on a culprit.  This is about brinksmanship, life and death, madness!  Even the re-imagining of Moriarty is way crazier than the original, shadowy character.  You always knew Moriarty was a madman, but now you can stare into his crazy eyes.

How do they carry this off?  Brilliant, brilliant acting, writing and direction.

Let's watch it again.",1390262400,,892,5.082758620689655

The stories set in current times captures the essence of stories ""written"" by Watson and further develops the relationship between the two.  Cumberbatch and Freeman are both outstanding.  Season 2 concludes with one shock followed by another.  The 3rd Season now being introduced by PBS should resolve some Season 2 issues and establish new challenges.

4453599,5,B004QOB8SO,"Back before there were so many channels, I used to watch British TV on public television. It always seemed odd to me that the US government would extract tax money from free citizens so as to force them to watch television made for people in another country. But no matter, British TV dramas were good.

British TV had a couple advantages then. First of all it seems that all British people are excellent actors in the same way that all Frenchmen are excellent cooks. Whoever called thgem a nation of shopkeepers got it wrong. They are a nation of character actors. The other advantage British TV used to have was that it always seemed to have particularly literate screenplays. For example I was very fond of 'Cadfael' and 'The Sandbaggers'. But these two series both suffered from technical deficiencies.

British television at that time was made with both video and film equipment. So indoor scenes were shot on video tape and outdoor scenes were shot on film.  The gamma of film and the gamma of tape are quite different. So in any one episode of these series there would be very different 'looks' to each separate scene. It was distracting but in those days we watched TV on 20 inch cathode ray tube TVs. The picture was so small and fuzzy it didn't matter that much. But today, like millions of Americans, I watch TV on a nine foot wide projection screen in High Definition with Dolby 5.1 sound. Such a set up is brutal in revealing every technical flaw. I found that I can't watch old episodes of  those beloved British shows. It's just too painful.

But suddenly we have a new and technically competent British TV. The Sherlock series is not only brilliantly written and acted but now looks good too.  The typical Sherlock episode is hardly different in technical competence from a feature film. Wonderful.

I first saw Benedict Cumberbatch  in the mini-series 'To the Ends of the Earth'. The series was like Cumberbatch himself - fascinating abut unlikeable. First of all his name is odd. I always called him Heinrich Cummerbund. It was a long time before I could remember his name - I still can't spell it. Most American stars like Tom Cruise are extraordinarily good looking and work hard at being likeable. Cumberbatch is odd looking and interpersonally nearly detestable. You wouldn't want to spend an evening in the pub with him.

Yet he is an excellent Sherlock Holmes. Maybe that's not so surprising. The very nasty and odd Basil Rathbone played Holmes not the likeable and dashing Errol Flynn.

Martin Freeman is also an excellent Watson. He can't help but be loveable. There have been many excellent Watsons over the years. My favorite was probably James Mason who like Freeman was a warm loveable character who set off the contrast with Holmes. Without a proper foil, Holmes would be unwatchable.",1389830400,,2815,4.761806981519507

4453638,5,B004QOB8SO,The stories and cases continue with the addition of Ms. Irene Adler. This brings a twist to Sherlock's personality. Both Cumberbatch and Martin are excellent in bringing the duo to live with all of the quirks and issues they have.,1389657600,,230,4.775

4453642,5,B004QOB8SO,Sherlock is loosely based on the Doyles stories.  Pretty faithful retelling and very quirky performance by Sherlock holmes and sidekick Watson is spot on,1389657600,,153,5.375

4453644,5,B004QOB8SO,"This series is really good, well-written and witty.  All of the actors are abundantly talented, though I am less enamored of Andrew Scott as Moriarty.  Lara Pulver is incredible as Irene Adler and Mark Gatiss plays a perfect Mycroft Holmes.  Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch are extraordinary and I absolutely love their on-screen chemistry.  I really hope this series continues with this gifted cast for many more years!!!",1389657600,,430,5.279411764705882
4453645,5,B004QOB8SO,I absolutely loved Season 2 of Sherlock. The character of Moriarty truly made the season for me; his evil mastermind provided the perfect counterpoint to Sherlock's abilities.,1389657600,,175,5.518518518518518

4453648,5,B004QOB8SO,"The production value is first rate, the acting superb. The writing is clever and compelling. The stories of two characters from the original Doyle stories, Irene Adler and Moriarty are brilliant.

It's so incredibly witty and sometimes so out right funny that I have to pause it to finish laughing, while at the same time full of mystery and danger in Sherlock Holmes style. If you're not watching this, you're missing the Hallmark of great television!",1389657600,,277,4.673469387755102
4453655,5,B004QOB8SO,"I am so pleased with the adaptation of these characters and stories.  Cumberbatch is excellent as the obtuse and mortifyingly intense Sherlock completely lacking any social skills, and Freeman makes a personable and relatable Holmes.  Together they are indeed a mystery solving duo who complement each other much more that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's pair.  I find Watson more interesting as an intelligent co-investigator capable of insight and more satisfying than his usual mundane role of simple companion and foil.",1389571200,,516,5.425
4453656,5,B004QOB8SO,Fantastic continuation of Season 1 with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman (aka Bilbo Baggins)!

4453660,5,B004QOB8SO,I've read the complete Conan Doyle library of Sherlock Holmes novels and stories and seen the current TV versions of the Homes tales. This is by far the best modernization of Sherlock as a person and the original stories.,1389571200,,221,4.6923076923076925

The writing, acting, scenery, filming - everything about this series is top notch and delightful to watch.

4453673,5,B004QOB8SO,A real THINKER!  Breathes new life into great stories.  Every episode is worth 5 stars.  Robert Downey Jr brought us superhuman muscle but Benedict brings us brains & wit just like Sherlock was meant to be seen.,1389484800,,211,4.648648648648648
4453674,5,B004QOB8SO,"Sherlock Holmes was a complex (fictional) individual.  The nuances of his character are portrayed beautifully in this British series.  His relationship with Watson, Mrs. Hudson, and everyone else makes it impossible to love him, but impossible to hate him, too.  Only his intellect and keen insight saves him from being shunned as someone incapable of a sustained friendship.  Great acting.",1389484800,,390,5.45

4453679,5,B004QOB8SO,"In a nutshell, Sherlock is brilliant. The dialogue is masterfully written and spectacularly delivered especially by the protagonist and his sidekick. They have such a natural chemistry that can't be faked that the view can't help but fall in love with the both of them. Big props to the casting of this whole show. The modern cinematography is very tastefully executed. Just the nature having an hour and a half of time for each episode allows for so much more character development and hilarious situations different characters find themselves in. In short, I highly recommend watching this, but only if you have a good amount of self control and can afford to watch an entire 90min episode.",1389398400,,692,4.923076923076923

4453726,5,B004QOB8SO,"I admit I've grown quite fond of Sherlock Holmes with all the attention the fictional character has received over the last few years.  As a kid I could never get through the books and was bored with any cinematic offerings.  I won't compare Jonny Lee Miller against Cumberbatch, they both get my praise for different reasons.  The American version takes liberties but sticks closer to the actual demons plaguing the mythical detective.  The UK version lets him wear the hat while eschewing the popular pipe (BBC's Holmes is, I guess, managing a prolific cigarette addiction?  It doesn't get much attention).

Sherlock, season two, was an amazing ride.  Narrowing its focus to the equally famous arch nemesis, Moriarty, whom I must confess is a little too weird for me  (I guess I prefer a psychopath with a steadier hand on his emotions and inflections), it reaches an epic climax.  I was completely drawn in.  It left me emotionally drawn out.  Please, a Season 3?!  And to my relief there is.

Another modern day adaptation of a classic detective story.  The most famous of the characters exclamations, quirks, and philosophy are kept intact.  Both Freeman and Cumberbatch have amazing chemistry, which I was doubtful of at first.  Freeman is quite fun to watch, his facial emotions are my absolute favorite.  Freeman has a subtle touch, he excudes more than he speaks.  Love it.

Watch it, I promise you, it's great stuff.",1389139200,,1425,4.887029288702929

4453728,5,B004QOB8SO,"I have read all the Sherlock Holmes stories, seen all the movies and loved the Jeremy Brett TV series.
Sherlock though is a fantastic and fascinating update.  Plenty of inside nods to the classic series of books.
My only complaint is the seasons are too short!  But there is a lot packed into each episode.",1389139200,,306,4.545454545454546
4453729,5,B004QOB8SO,I cannot say enough how great this show is. Season 1 is equally as good. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the best Sherlock character I have ever seen. Martin Freeman is also fantastic. A must watch for all! The BBC puts on fabulous television.,1389139200,,238,4.690476190476191
4453730,5,B004QOB8SO,"This series is NEVER going to let you down. The stories have an extremely clever take on the original stories, but that's where the similarity ends. Set in contemporary London, in today's super-charged times of Twitter and FB, Sherlock is right at the forefront of the crusade against Moriarty in this season. Of course the ending is by now well known, but worth a double or triple watch - easily.

It actually challenges the viewer and proves that the art of deduction is not a dated method that worked in the original stories because of lack of technology. Even in these series - including this season - SH takes deduction to an art level, and does things that technology simply can't do.",1389139200,,690,4.655737704918033

4453732,5,B004QOB8SO,"Great character interpretation.  The maniac wackiness of James Moriary is hella crazy and fun at the same time, he is a rollercoaster ride.  Irene Adler's sultry cunning is priceless.  Mycroft Holmes, the concerned but competitive older brother, so sweet...so disfunctional. The combination of Cumberbatch and Freeman is WOW.  This Sherlocke Holmes series was not only entertaining but it made me feel.  Angsty anyone?",1389139200,,418,5.571428571428571

4453735,5,B004QOB8SO,"Love this show, albeit Season one was a tiny bit better, but I think that was because Holmes and Watson were new to each other and there was more ""funny awkwardness"".  I think Martin Freeman was funnier in the first series, although the humor is so subtle it is easy to miss.  Americans say they don't get ""British humor"", but it is fantastic to me.
Cumberbatch/Sherlock is always entertaining, the ""consulting detective""- a gifted actor and perfect for this role, plus easy on the eyes.  As I have said for Season 1, HOW does he deliver those lines?  Brainy IS the new sexy....
  The stories are complicated and you may have to watch closely or rewind in parts.  This show is definitely not just eye candy, nor a show to watch for falling asleep.  You will need to use your mind on this series.
Other characters: Mycroft is definitely one of my faves as Sherlock's brother- the great Mark Gatiss- the eye rolls are precious!!  He IS the British Government.
Moriarity is such a great ""old fashioned"" villain, he adds much to the show, although it is easy to hate him.  Irene Adler (Scandal in Belgravia)was entertaining too, I was wishing for a kiss from Sherlock to her, but I guess that was not where they were going.
I have seen some of the criticisms, but I have to ask what other TV shows even come close to the entertainment value of Sherlock?
Although I live in the US, I am becoming an honorary citizen of the UK, I think the programming is so much smarter and well done.  Do we really have to show Honey boo boo??

4453746,5,B004QOB8SO,"I love a good mystery but am not generally too impressed with TV shows. This one, however, is exceptional. The cinematography depicts how Sherlock thinks/processes. The modern day slant makes it ""relevant"" and is done without being cheesy. Moriarty is truly frightening without being overly gruesome. It's just top notch through and through. Can't wait for the next season beginning this month!",1389139200,,394,5.370967741935484
4453747,5,B004QOB8SO,"This modern day adaptation of Sherlock Holmes is a marvel. With crisp, sharp writing that is crisply and sharply delivered, intriguing plots that have strong echoes of the original stories, and glorious high-definition video that makes even London's traditionally drab days look much more inviting, these vignettes are a feast for the eyes and mind.

Unlike a classic Christie murder mystery, you don't necessarily have all the facts to solve a case in advance (the plots sometimes use items that are hidden from the viewer), but this is more of a technical criticism than a flaw. Even on re-watching, it is easy to get sucked into the story all over again. Recommended.",1389139200,,670,4.982142857142857
4453748,5,B004QOB8SO,"The four main characters--Holmes, Watson, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson--play the roles to perfection.

4453752,5,B004QOB8SO,I found the second season even better than the first. The actors/characters have really grown into their roles and their on screen chemistry is great. In this season they do make some changes from the orginal stories to fit with the times. There is some nudity in the first episode featuring Irene Adler and while it is tastefully done it may not be everybody's cup of tea. The Hound of the Baskervilles/second episode is much changed again to move with the times but I still enjoyed it. I shall be buying season three.,1389052800,,519,4.591397849462366
4453753,5,B004QOB8SO,"If you haven't seen season one - go back to the page and buy it.  Right now.  Thank me later.  Actually you can just send me money and good karma since I will be making your life complete.  Time is now divided into two new eras: BS (Before Sherlock) and AS (After Sherlock).  So of course, everything before Sherlock is BS.  Like what I did there?

In all seriousness - the series is nearly flawless.  The music is great, the camera work (which could have been a disaster) is actually some of the best I've witnessed from British television, the writing is wonderful, and the acting top notch.  Not only are Cumberbatch and Freeman amazing, but the entire supporting cast is jaw dropping awesome in their roles!

My one little nitpick if any is that they dropped the Moriarty bomb very quickly and it seems he is really behind everything.  It's a nice way to portray it, but it really moved things ahead.  But knowing most British television series (I said 'most') have a 2-4 year run, I guess they wanted to move ahead before Cumberbatch and Freeman get too busy with film!

Each episode is around 90 minutes, so the viewer has plenty of time to get acquainted with the story and the characters in each.  At times serious, at times funny, and always over the top!  Great British suspense series!  And it looks great in 1080p!",1389052800,,1326,4.508403361344538

He embodies the essence of Sherlock Holmes as I envision him.  I recommend this series to anyone interested in the mystery or murder genre and likes unusual characters.  The interaction between Holmes and Watson is sometimes antagonistic and sometimes lighthearted.  Their relationship is intriguing.  The three episodes in the Season 2 series were all excellent.

4453774,5,B004QOB8SO,"This show is just plain fun and season 2 turned everything up to 11! The crime scenarios are more complex, the scope is bigger, things are more suspenseful, the acting is superb, and of course who can get over that last episode's shocking conclusion!
All three episodes of this season brim with titillating excitement. ""Scandal in Belgravia"" ends up being my favorite of the season as it pits Sherlock against his female counterpart, Irene Adler (""The Woman"") who almost steals the show with her swaggering, feminine charisma. With a rousing mystery to propel the action, the whole thing ends up being classically romantic in a satisfying ""old hollywood"" manner where the male and female leads only share a passion but never consummate the attraction (at least to the viewers eyes), which in no way diminishes the love story. It's probably the only type of love story Sherlock should ever be allowed to have. The timeless classic ""The Hounds of Baskerville"" gets a fine update in this season's ""sophomore' episode but, in my opinion, ends up being the weaker of the three but only when compared along the side of the other two episodes. It's a good episode.
And of course, ""The Reichenbach Fall"" is the climatic finale that got everyone's tongues wagging for almost two years. Everything great about the series is contained in this episode and more as we see our heroes pushed to their limits by being made to go through a labyrinth of a plot to finally arrive at the mind shattering conclusion. This season no doubt cements, in my opinion, this show's 5 star status and remains to be quality entertainment that engages and challenges its viewers.",1388880000,,1647,4.864768683274021
4453775,5,B004QOB8SO,This show is great.  Cumberbatch is superb as Mr. Holmes and Martin Freeman is a great John Watson.  Mark Gattis and Steven Moffat should be very proud.,1388880000,,152,4.592592592592593

4453777,5,B004QOB8SO,"Being a 30 year fan of Dr. Who, and a fan of the storylines of Dr's 9-11, I am pre-disposed to enjoying this romp from Moffat. I wasn't dissapointed. The melding of the classic story with modern time is delightful (the Strand being replaced by a blog). The way they translate deductive reasoning visually is very innovative, although, the thoughts of Holmes flying across the screen at rapid fire may be un-nerving. The choice of Cumberbatch and Freeman is great (Laurie- Fry, Atkinson- Laurie come to mind) and showcases the dry wit that is classic Brittish storytelling. I can't wait for season 3, however, I wish the didn't have to postpone the 12th doctor's story to complete it.",1388880000,,683,4.796610169491525

Then he went to work and told a co-worker who also got hooked after the first episode and watched all of them at once just like we did.

4453796,5,B004QOB8SO,"Enjoyed the second season as much as the first.  Great job translating the characters and stories into the present day: (allusions to Asperger's, the running bit about Holmes and Watson being taken for a gay couple).  I enjoyed everything about this series:  actors, writing, setting, pacing.  Although the final episode's basic plot line was wonderful, some of the details were a bit of a stretch -- but one could say the same about Conan Doyle in the original stories.",1388793600,,470,4.9113924050632916
4453797,4,B004QOB8SO,But if you are expecting the familiar classic you can forget it. Enjoyable on the whole. Moriarty was a trip or a joke and hardly what you'd expect.,1388793600,,148,4.321428571428571

4453805,4,B004QOB8SO,"Unfortunately, I couldn't get a rating between 3 stars and 4. However, let me tell you the pros and cons to this series. Let's start with the positive aspects. First of all Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are the only ones who could do this role so perfectly. I can't imagine anyone better for taking on the personas and executing the witty lines. Second of all, and I already briefly touched on this, it is full of wit. Holmes, ever the more superior mind, constantly tells people to shut up because of their lack of intelligence with such lines as ""be quiet because you're lowering the IQ of the whole street.""  Then there's the technology. If anyone has ever seen the version with Jeremy Brett, you'll remember that it was good but obviously set in the proper Sherlock time period according to the books. However, with the modernization contained in this series comes the inevitable technology which makes it really cool. The effects are great, particularly when Sherlock is looking someone over and little words appear next to their eyes or nose or clothing that tell exactly what Sherlock is deducing. Brilliant!
Now, let me tell you about the negative aspects. It is most certainly not a kid-friendly show. This is displayed nowhere better than in the episode titled ""Scandal In Belgravia."" ""The Woman"" as she is referred to by Sherlock, at least in the books, appears several times without any clothes on and there are several inappropriate lines that are scattered throughout the episode. However, the less than appropriate language doesn't stop there. Other episodes contain it too. Lastly, and I know this is just all part of who Sherlock Holmes is in this series, he is so egotistical. He knows he has superior intelligence and relishes the opportunity to rub it in everyone's face. It's not subtle either. He literally calls people stupid in so many words numerous times and it's obvious that he thinks himself better than everyone else. But yes, clearly he is smarter than all of the rest of mankind. If you watch the version with Jeremy Brett, you'll see that Holmes not only never rubs his superior intelligence in people's faces but also quite often lets Lestrade take all the credit for a case he solved himself. He is a much more humble man. But I guess if you did everything according to the books, there would be no point in ever redoing it.",1388707200,,2369,4.778048780487805
4453806,5,B004QOB8SO,Very well done. Had a little trouble understanding Sherlock when he talked really fast but closed captions saved the day. But- Where is the third season? Waiting impatiently!,1388707200,,174,5.25
4453807,5,B004QOB8SO,"One of the best series ever made.  Starting with superlative writing, add the amazing cast, and you have fabulous television.",1388707200,,125,5.25
4453808,5,B004QOB8SO,So very well done.  I like how the show follows the actual cases written by Arthur Conan Doyle and how the show is brought into the current times.  Doctor Watson's blogs are a nice touch to modernize the show.,1388707200,,209,4.333333333333333
4453809,5,B004QOB8SO,This show just keeps getting better and better. I didn't like Andrew Scott as Moriarty at first but he quickly grew on me. The rooftop scene is phenomenal. I'm totally addicted to this show.,1388707200,,190,4.617647058823529
4453810,5,B004QOB8SO,"The buildup with Moriarty, the expanding character depth and relationships, the finale...all fantastic. Let's hope Season Three stays as sharp and nuanced. Of course, if they continue to use the actual A.C. Doyle stories as background, they can't go wrong.",1388707200,,256,5.425
4453811,5,B004QOB8SO,My daughter loved it! I had never seen this show before. It was good! It is three 1-1/2 hour episodes.,1388707200,,102,4.15

4453813,5,B004QOB8SO,"Absolutely hands down the best show I have seen to date. With Sherlock's Benedict Cumberbatch, you can never be entirely sure his character has a fuzzy warm fluttering heart lurking beneath his extraordinary cool exterior.  Cumberbatch pulls off a great nod to Sherlock Holmes - his character continues to make the show so compelling. Of course besides the show and it's intriguing characters - it is impossible to draw one's eyes away from Cumberbatch - his appeal staring directly at all swooning admirers!!

Love the show. Love the series. Draws you in - time well spent :)",1388620800,,576,4.927835051546392

4453816,5,B004QOB8SO,Benedict Cumberbatch plays a wonderful version of Sherlock Holmes that I both love and hate at the same time. I would definitely recommend watching the series.,1388620800,,159,5.153846153846154
4453817,5,B004QOB8SO,each episode is a little long at 1 and a half hours but it lets you get more into the plot of the episode.  it's more of a short movie than a tv show.,1388620800,,150,3.411764705882353
4453818,5,B004QOB8SO,Another great show from Masterpiece.  Cumberbatch and Freeman are a fantastic duo.  These episodes are more like movies.  Definitely worth the time.,1388620800,,148,5.636363636363637

4453820,5,B004QOB8SO,"Much closer to the original stories. Far better than the recent movies. A very different take on ""modernization of Sherlock"" than what Elementary does.

4453822,5,B004QOB8SO,"Its been two years since it was released.  And I have watched it many times, and still watching it and enjoying it.  It is better than Season 1 overall in my opinion (although Study in Pink still holds special place in fans' hearts).  Having watched the first episode of Season 3 now, I feel the season 2 are more serious and heavier episodes and I believe time will approve it will last.",1388620800,,388,4.361111111111111

This is sure to be as great a hit as Downton Abbey, if not even bigger. This is a must see work of art. My new fav.
The best Sherlock Homes ever.
This will help me to fill the emptiness left by the vacancy in my life, Post Breaking Bad and Dexter. Truly something worth living for.

4453827,5,B004QOB8SO,"I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan my whole life, and have seen every version of Sherlock in film or television. Robert Downey's Sherlock is basically a superhero, not a super brain, so that one leaves me flat.

4453828,5,B004QOB8SO,Best version of Sherlock Holmes ever!!!  The dialogue is great; Sherlock shines when he starts spewing out all the details that are so obvious to him. I especially emjoy his  thinly-veiled disdain for those who are not as clever as he is.,1388534400,,238,4.642857142857143

4453832,5,B004QOB8SO,Cumberbatch and Freeman make a terrific pair.  The contemporary twist of three stories are cleverly done.  The only drawback is that the number of episodes are much fewer than what you'll want.  Great television.,1388534400,,212,5.176470588235294
4453833,5,B004QOB8SO,"I really like the interactions between Sherlock and John Watson. Sherlock can be a jerk and insensitive, but he's also funny and fun to watch. The show is well-written and the chemistry between Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch is great. The Hounds of Baskervilles is the only ""blah"" episode in season 2. It's just not very interesting, but the other episodes are so amazingly good I can overlook that.",1388448000,,408,4.927536231884058

Keeps you at the edge of your seat trying to figure out what happens next.  The cliffhanger was killer and I'm lucky I just watched it and only have to wait a few months to see what happens next.  The fans must have had a conniption fit when it was questioned whether or not there would be another season!  Fun, fun, fun!",1388448000,,464,4.3604651162790695

4453837,4,B004QOB8SO,"I'm a recent convert to Sherlock, and it's got me hook, line, and sinker.  It's a fascinating show, and Cumberbatch and Freeman are fantastic in their roles.  The only thing keeping me from giving this five stars is that there's a bit more suspension of disbelief in this season.  Part of the magic of the series has been the logic behind Sherlock's deductions, and this time around a bit too much of the plot hinges on lucky guesses and ""because I said so assertions.""",1388448000,,469,4.559523809523809

4453844,5,B004QOB8SO,"As a longtime Basil Rathbone fan, I felt that no one would ever match his embodiment of Sherlock Holmes.  I ignored this BBC take on Sherlock Holmes when it first appeared and made the mistake of assuming it would be mediocre, even though I generally prize a lot of BBC productions.  Something spurred me to give it a try, and from the moment I began to watch it, I was utterly mesmerized and amazed by the masterful acting and the witty, engaging writing.  Benedict Cumberbatch is simply incredible as Sherlock Holmes, and Martin Freeman plays Watson beautifully.  I've watched all of the episodes multiple times, something I rarely ever do with any film or television show.  Don't let the modern setting for the series dissuade you from watching.  It was one of the factors that discouraged me from watching it in the first place.  All of the episodes have a timeless quality and still possess a tremendous amount of atmosphere.  I now treasure both the Rathbone and Cumberbatch bodies of work.  If you have not yet seen Sherlock, rent or buy the episodes now, and catch up with seasons 1 and 2 before the new 3rd season starts on January 19th.",1388361600,,1146,4.661691542288557

4453875,2,B004QOB8SO,"I really love the series (five stars, over all) - much more enjoyable plots and characterizations
than the American take - Elementary

But, for me at least, The Hounds of Baskerville is the weakest episode of the first two seasons.
Gattis talks about being bedeviled by the difficulties posed by this particular adaptation, and, given the result,
it appears to have remained perplexing all the way through its conception and creation.
Just me, perhaps, but many threads seemed to be confusingly, ""befuddledly"" presented
(and not in the way a clever detective story strives for), with the eventual denouement lacking the complexity and
amazing insight we expect of Sherlocknot so much 'magically revealed', more 'explained' than 'experienced', perhaps?

And please, Mr. Gattis, I can understand how this plays to your own life, but are we really to believe,
episode after episode,
scene after scene,
that every  single introduction, every relationship, every innuendo in England involves the requirement
that any and every two men presented, must be obliquely 'suspected' of being gay?
Here in California, I saw two men talking the other day at Starbucks, and, I'm pretty sure,
nobody even wondered about it!

Watson, as this series correctly interpreted was a courageous ex-soldier, wounded in war, and the 'Seeley Booth Gun Toting' sidekick to Holmes as Booth is to scientist Temperance Brennan, another good interpretation of the singularly brilliant yet somewhat insane amateur scientist Sherlock Holmes always was. Holmes while brilliant was always a bit insane. The best interpretation on film being the Jeremy Brett one that shows better than any so far what Conan Doyle actually created in fiction.

4453933,2,B004QOB8SO,"It's too bad that screenwriters, whether in the US or in the UK, big screen or small, feel they can improve upon a classic by trying to ""update"" it.  This series would have been much better if they stepped away from the original characters in the Sherlock Holmes stories and instead say ""inspired by"" and created new characters.

This is not an update of the original.  It is warped and takes great liberties with characters who were closer to perfection in their original form.  As mentioned in the review for Season 1 of ""Sherlock"", this Holmes is an anachronism in the 21st century.  Suspension of disbelief is essential to watch this - and, even then, it is difficult to watch.

This Holmes is a self-admitted sociopath - while he might have a conscience (of some sort), he has no empathy.  As a person without empathy, but on the quest for always being right and ""the smartest person in the room"", he has no understanding of how satiating his ego does damage to those around him and who actually care about him.

He is a monster.

I don't believe Conan Doyle's original idea of Holmes was anything like this.  Yes,his Sherlock has his demons - and seeks to quell those demons with opiates.  But he had a drive to right wrongs and to stop evil doers from doing evil.  He is an odd, but gifted and talented man, who seeks to use his gifts to do good.

This Holmes is none of those things.  He is selfish, self-absorbed, self-centered and an egotist - likely driven by childhood issues with his parents (whom we know nothing about) and his older brother (whom we know plenty about), who sets about acting out, like a petulant child.  He fumes when, while with this brother, Mycroft, a government agent notes that Mycroft is known as ""The Iceman"" and Sherlock as ""the virgin"".

When ordered to Buckingham Palace for a case regarding national security - he refuses to go.  He is dragged there wearing only his bed sheet - like the brat that he is.

He eschews anything that looks like, sounds like or feels like affection or emotion from others - unless it is to use those feelings and to exploit them for his own purposes.

He has no qualms about using those closest to him.  He uses Watson, his flat mate and erstwhile ""partner"" as a guinea pig for some unknown hallucinogenic (""The Hound of the Baskervilles"").  It's as though since this Holmes was a victim of the same drug by ingesting tainted sugar in his coffee, he feels a fool, and, therefore, has no problem subjecting Watson, who witnesses Holmes loss of control while under the affects of the drug, to the same fate.

What's worse is how Holmes manipulates Watson in ingesting this toxin - by offering to make him a cup of coffee (totally out of this Holmes' character - to give to others without the expectation of getting anything in return) and making a face of disapproval when Watson tries to turn the coffee down - because Watson doesn't take sugar.  So, out of guilt, Watson allows Holmes to manipulate him, and he drinks the coffee out of politeness.  Then he goes through the same nightmarish hallucinations Holmes faced .  Holmes reaction?  ""Well, I knew you were okay, so where's the harm?""  Holmes solves the case.  So, as Machiavelli says, ""the ends justify the means"".

He is this way throughout the series.  If he is exhibiting kindness (or something that looks like kindness) it is because he wants something.  If he senses affection from anyone his immediate reaction is to cut that person with words and embarrass them as thoroughly as possible.  The poor fool most brutally caught in these crosshairs is erstwhile lab technician, Molly, who, for some inexplicable reason, is infatuated with this Holmes.  He cuts her down to the point where she admits to him she knows ""I don't matter"".  Little does she know, at that moment, she does matter in his world because he is about to use her again - so, for the first time, he is somewhat kind to her and reassures her that she does matter.  For the next 48 hours or so.

The writers also abuse the notion of the ""archenemy"" Dr. James Moriarty.  In this series he is a young, over-the-top psychopath who is never completely fleshed out.  It is near impossible to understand why a) he exists and b) he has this vendetta against Holmes.  It's this relationship that leads to the inexplicable ""surprise twist"" at the end of the third mini-movie - where Molly is used again.  (They call this a series - it's three 90-minute movies).  This ""surprise twist"" is as self indulgent and unnecessary as it gets.  It is beyond cruel and I, at the end, found myself hating this Sherlock Holmes.

His ""sacrifice"" is not because he is trying to protect others because he cares about them.  He protects them because he only cares about himself.  He wants them in HIS world for what they can do for HIM.  There is no other reason.

I know Season 3 is now either in production or has just wrapped up.  I doubt that I will watch it because there is no way the writers can sustain what they have started.  Either they abandon the premise that Holmes is a sociopath and he becomes a more caring man - which would just be bad writing because that would be impossible.

Or, he remains as he must - a sociopath - uncaring except for his own feelings and self-indulgent to a fault.  At that point, why bother?  I can watch the news and see horrible people doing awful things to nice people.  I don't have to watch a group of derivative writers destroy one of the best characters in fiction.

I know this has a huge following in the UK and a growing following in the US.  I am sure there will be people who disagree with me and believe the 'attractiveness' of the lead is more than enough to justify the series.  I just don't see it.",1386460800,8,5732,4.522373540856031

The scripts run from very good to great and Benedict Cumberbatch does a good job portraying the great detective. I do hope, however, that the writers will allow a little more emotion and understanding to come thru Cumberbatch's character, if for no other reason, his constant exposure to his friend and colleague, John Watson. There are some other aspects of the series I would ""fine tune"", but, it's a British series, and they have their own way of doing things. The result is a very watchable and entertaining program; highly recommended.",1386460800,,657,5.036697247706422

Series 2 was just as wonderful, including the cliffhanger. (Which, by the way, I can't wait to see how it's resolved in series 3 in January.) Benedict Cumberbatch is a wonderful actor, as is Martin Freeman. I was a bit leery about a new Sherlock Holmes series and even more so when I found out it was going to be set in the modern era. But Cumberbatch and Freeman made me forget all about my doubts with the fun, updated, wonderful take on the crime-solving duo.

It is a much better version of Robert Downing Jr on the screen and a far superior in contrast to the elementary series produce by CBS.In comparison to the classic PBS series with Jeremy Brett is a different flavor.  If you are looking for an ultimate adaptation to the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle version, this will not meet your satisfaction.  However if you are in search for a twist of the original chronicle this will be an ideal for you.  The second season the writer from the current version of Doctor Who had not only modernize the Arthur Conan Doyle version but it place a greater analysis of Sherlock Holmes in the modern day society. Benedict Cumberbatch is just superb as Sherlock Holmes among the many tales the Scandal in Scarlet was an interesting intrigue in the introduction of Irene Adler.  Her strength in deduction equal to Sherlock and the female actress is by far a superior version in comparison to Rachel McAdam's version on the silver screen.  The support cast is just superior in all aspect this should be attribute the production company in delivering a superior script and detail of how Sherlock uses its power of observation and the element within each cases.  This is a most have for any Sherlock Holmes fan.  Season 1 is equally great.  However I had found season two is far more superior..",1385769600,2,1387,4.674897119341564

But I was pleasantly surprised and pleased by the degree of inventiveness and originality of the plots. The acting is fantastic! B. Cumberbatch  presents SH as the genius on the borderline of brilliant insanity. Martin Freeman plays a somewhat introspective Dr. Watson, perhaps because he has experienced the horrors of the Afghanistan war. But they fit like hand and glove and make a handsome pair of sleuths.

A detective I really love to hate but respect.",1384214400,,141,4.64
4454003,5,B004QOB8SO,"A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA: The first episode of SHERLOCK Season 2 also happens to be my all-time favourite. Holmes and Watson go up against the sexy dominatrix Irene Adler, played to slinky perfection by Lara Pulver, to uncover a web of government intrigue and deceit. SCANDAL is the perfect mix of humor, action, personality, sharp writing,  and excellent acting from the incomparable Benedict Cumberbatch and the stupendous Martin Freeman. More than that, the twist ending is actually incredibly powerful and surprisingly moving. A Scandal in Belgravia is the Sherlockian formula at it's highest - Steven Moffat's intelligent writing combined with true style and class to create a riveting episode that ranks among TV's finest. 9/10

THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE: Hounds is the weakest episode of Season 2, but that is not saying much indeed. It's like saying that Return of the Jedi is the worst of the original Star Wars movies - they're ALL great anyways. Hounds is dark and actually quite scary, but ultimately is somewhat disappointing. The suspenseful and excellent buildup leads to a conclusion that is too easy and Deus ex Machina-ish to live up to the first half of the episode. That being said, there are some great scenes, (including one of Sherlock's all-time funniest, which takes place in a Dartmoor pub), and Holmes's ""Mind palace"" sequence - one of the show's best. Russell Tovey is excellent as Henry Knight, Cumberbatch is as difficult as brilliant as we've come to expect, and Martin Freeman has never been Martin Freeman-ier. So while the ending of Hounds was a bit too easy, there's still a great, witty, smart buildup, reminding us that Sherlock is still the greatest detective show on television. 7/10

THE REICHENBACH FALL: When I said that A Scandal in Belgravia was my favourite episode I wasn't lying. But The Reichenbach Fall is far and away the *best* episode of Sherlock ever, and deserves to rank among the finest single episodes in telly HISTORY! From the opening scenes, to Moriarty's (played to *electrifying* perfection by Andrew Scott) awe-inspiring theft of the Crown Jewels to the tune of The Thieving Magpie, to Moriarty and Sherlock's heart-to-heart, to the thundering, power-packing, unforgettable ending...Fall is almost perfect. Everything from the writing to the editing, humor, acting, sets, action, dialogue...I can't fault it. This is an episode that remains in the mind long after it's over; such lines as ""Every fairy tale needs a good ol'fashioned villain"" and Sherlock's cryptic erm...final message (spoiler alert?), and the mind-bogglingly good ending will leave you puzzling long after the show is over. All I can say is that Moffat, Gatiss, and Thompson are some clever gents indeed... 10/10

January 2014 cannot come soon enough! Until then, both Cumberbatch and Freeman can be seen (and heard) in The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug!",1384041600,2,2881,5.14957264957265

This is one of the best written, well-acted TV shows that I have ever seen.  And I love that each episode is an hour and a half long.  A Scandal in Belgravia was such a steamy piece it had me reapplying my roll-on deodorant midway through.
Most TV shows need to reach a five-year mark to avoid cancellation and be considered a success.  All I can say is that, come the end of Season 3, BBC better clear their calendar for Sherlock for the next couple of years -- or they'll be getting some serious hate mail from me.",1383696000,,603,4.172413793103448

4454017,5,B004QOB8SO,I love the update.  I truly believe this is how Holmes would be if age 30 and in the 21st century.  Cumberbatch and Freeman are excellent.,1383523200,,138,4.269230769230769
4454018,5,B004QOB8SO,"Starts off right where season one ended.  A great spin on an old classic, and they did a great job bringing Sherlock Holmes into the 21st century.",1383523200,,146,4.407407407407407

4454037,5,B004QOB8SO,Never read the books but the stories are captivating and the actors are great. Love that each it like a mini-movie.

Then a friend had me sit down and watch an episode of this series with her.  I've been hooked ever since!  It's now an evening family event to sit down and watch and episode together.

Everything flows really well and Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock has style so it makes it worth your while to watch and see where Sherlock takes you. This version is much better than Elementary in my opinion. I lost interest in that show pretty quickly (within the first season) and this one captured my attention.",1382659200,,363,4.777777777777778

When will season 3 be available?  I'll count the days.  I am very choosy about my programing since I don't have a lot of time for it.  Sherlock has made me miss two days of work because I couldn't get enough.  It's smart, fast paced and compelling.  The acting is absolutely fantastic.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are a very believable, emotion provoking and fun to watch pair as Holmes and Watson.  You don't even need to be a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories to be able to latch on this just plain excellent series, but being a fan of the cannon you cannot help but appreciate how artfully it has been done.  I am SHER locked.",1382227200,,795,4.3108108108108105
4454065,1,B004QOB8SO,"This is a review of ""A Scandal in Belgravia"".

For the most part, I really enjoyed the first season of Sherlock and fully expected to have the same response to season 2. After the first 10 minutes of ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" I realized the experience had changed. I was hoping this series would rise above the base cultural moral standards that are lowering each day, but sadly this episode follows the downward trend. Sad that this is acceptable on mainstream tv...

I know there are many who disagree with what I am saying, this isn't written or meant for you. This review is to help someone to know what is in this episode so they can be informed before they are exposed to it. This is meant to be helpful to the small few of us who don't want to watch what we call filth.

SO, If you aren't offended by gratuitous portrayals/insinuations of S&M  behavior and strategically placed camera angles that show everything but full frontals, you'll probably like this episode. IF however you are offended by such, pass on this episode.

A disappointing entry to an intriguing take on a mystery classic",1382227200,11,1097,4.605128205128205
4454066,5,B004QOB8SO,love this version of Sherlock holmes.  you must pay close attention because they talk fast and have the british accent but it is worth it.,1382140800,,138,4.52

4454068,5,B004QOB8SO,"We love the actors, The writers, The plot, The cinematography! Always so clever, I don't know how they consistently make such successful intrigue and creativity - but they do.

4454070,5,B004QOB8SO,"A remarkably new and refreshing take on Sherlock Holmes.  The actors are perfect for those personalities they portray and Sherlock is remarkably well written, well devised and incredibly well developed.  Only downside is that they only do three or four a season.  I couldn't get enough of this.  But then anything of this quality has to be rarer to be cherished that much more.",1381968000,,377,4.84375

4454077,5,B004QOB8SO,Best Sherlock Holmes series yet. Lots of twists and turns. Not the usual predictable writing of most of today's TV shows. Just wish there were about 6 more episodes per season!,1381622400,,176,4.709677419354839

4454082,4,B004QOB8SO,I liked this spin on the Sherlock stories starting with the first season. I was a little disappointed that season one only had a small handful of episodes and then for season two to only have three was a big let down. They are all worth watching but it ends with no closure feeling unfinished.,1381449600,,293,4.345454545454546
4454083,5,B004QOB8SO,"From the acting to the writing to the set design and on, this is one of the best quality shows on television. Reams have been written on how good this show is, so take our word for it. Watch it. If you love Doyle or just quality tv, you'll enjoy it. Of course, it's sexed up, so not appropriate for the under, what? 12? 14? Frankly, I wouldn't have let mine watch this till 16 (dominatrix in the first episode--I'm strict), but the Baskerville is an excellent retelling, as is A Scandal in Belgravia. And the finale (which I think might be disturbing for younger viewers, as well).",1381276800,,581,4.388888888888889

4454086,5,B004QOB8SO,I love this show but wish they would make more of them. I am not sure if this is what you could call a series or not since there do not appear to be more than four episodes. I sure hope they continue to make them. I recommend the show. I ordered what I thought were new DVD's however but I do not think they were. The case was broken in one of them as has been the case with other items I have ordered through Amazon. I never get used because I do not wish to go through the hassle of returning items. These were useable but obviously used.,1381104000,,540,3.918181818181818

4454090,5,B004QOB8SO,Keep in mind that there are only three 90-min-long episodes in a season. The show is very well done though. It's Sherlock Holmes set in modern times. The way technology is integrated is clever.,1380931200,,193,4.705882352941177

4454093,5,B004QOB8SO,"I didn't watch Sherlock when it originally came out.  I found it on Netflix after both seasons were already completed and decided to give it a try.  Boy, was I missing out.  Sherlock is easily one of the top 5 shows I have ever watched.  The first season was amazing and the second season just kept up the good work, possibly even outshining the first.  If you haven't checked this show out, stop what you are doing and watch it immediately.  The only downside is how addicting it is.  Once you watch one episode you won't want to stop until there are none left.  And then when you have finished all of the episodes, you will want to watch them all over again.  I simply cannot wait for season 3 to come out.  Get your addiction started now.  It will be the best thing to ever happen to you.",1380844800,2,791,4.241610738255034

4454095,5,B004QOB8SO,I  have enjoyed seasons one and two and am waiting with excitement for season three !!!! The storylines have been all very interesting and both actors bring uniquely quirky and unusual layers of intrigue and humour to their characters,1380844800,,234,5.0
4454096,5,B004QOB8SO,"I can't say enough about how great this program is. I'm a die-hard Jeremy Brett ""authentic"" Sherlock fan, so I really didn't expect much of this version. But I am blown away by how well it's done. The two main actors are PERFECT in their roles (like Brett--Cumberbatch was BORN to play Sherlock). They have such great chemistry --their banter is completely natural. I love how close the stories stay to Doyle's original stories, but placed in modern day--that's not an easy task. And they do it brilliantly--nothing cheesy here.

If you're in any way a Sherlock Holmes fan--try this out. Of course, I'd suggest starting with the first season and at least watch the pilot episode. It's fab-U-lous--you'll get enough backstory there you'll better appreciate the rest of the episodes.

Watch it, buy it, rent it--any way you can--this is a MUST SEE.",1380758400,3,846,4.868055555555555

4454105,5,B004QOB8SO,"I binged both seasons in practically one sitting--couldn't stop.  It was great.  Cumberbatch is so engaging you can't stop watching him.  My only complaint was the character of Moriarty: the role was written, directed and played just a wee bit too chewy for my taste.  I was distracted by the nearly clownish elements where that character should have been pure menace.  I won't fault the actor for this as he did a great job, but I wish the role had been rendered more villainous and evil in general.

HUGE shout out to the amazing Lara Pulver as 'Irene Adler'.  Her performance alone is worth the price of admission.

Overall, it's genius and I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys great writing, acting and fun, interesting storylines.  You will be engaged and you will fall under Sherlock's spell.  Can't wait to see Season 3!",1380499200,,830,4.741258741258742

The writing is superb.  The acting is wonderful.  I am particularly struck by the authentic on-screen friendship between Cumberbatch and Freeman.  Moriarity is well portrayed as are the ""supporting"" players.  Mycroft is fantastic as is Irene.  If you haven't watched either series, you are in for a treat.",1379808000,,474,5.0

4454149,5,B004QOB8SO,"This is not the review of an obsessed with Benedict Cumberbatch fan. With that being said; Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in this series, as well as Martin Freeman. In this day and age television is inundated with a copious amount of shows to choose from. Even so, we are forced to choose between a great show with mediocre acting or excellent acting with mediocre writing. Every now and then we get the perfect storm, and Sherlock is that perfect storm. The caliber of acting on this show is excellent. The chemistry between the actors is astonishing and poignant. The writing is fantastic! Mark Gatiss' and Steven Moffit's writing is nothing short of impressive. They are always tying scenes, quotes, conditions, etc. from the original stories into a contemporary Sherlock/London. You never feel like your watching a stuffy old Holmes and Watson. Your not stuck in a previous time period with formal unrecognizable speech. It is contemporary in every sense of the word; cars, iphones, modern medicine, subway system, etc. As for the idiosyncrasies well known to Holmes and Watson instead of doing away with them, or sticking to the same boring composition, Gatiss and Moffit have modernized them as well.  For example, Holmes originally smoked a pipe, in modern London he uses nicotine patches. The excellent cinematography, music, props, and on and on I could go. My recommendation: watch it!",1379376000,3,1398,5.078260869565217

The casting is great and the stories are fun to watch unfold.
I can't wait for Season Three.",1379289600,,171,4.212121212121212
4454160,5,B004QOB8SO,"Season 2 of ""Sherlock"" continues the adapted tales of Sherlock Holmes, culminating in ""The Reichenbach Fall"", an homage to the short story where Arthur Conan Doyle tries to kill off his too-popular fictional hero. Where Season 1 dealt with the demons behind the duo (Holmes and Watson), Season 2 has a handful of totally weird and wonderful criminals and Holmes dealing with his new-found fame. Where his website and ""243 kinds of tobacco ash"" failed to grab public attention, John Watson's blog gets thousands of hits a day and has turned Holmes into a tabloid darling, much to his dismay. The unfortunate photo where he's disguised in a theatre prop hat (the Deerstalker, of course) comes back to vex him as well.

The end episode is very Batman-like, but that is ok. Moriarty and Holmes are larger-than-life figures so a bit of cartoonish writing is all right--though I think the silliness in Season 2 sometimes gets out of hand (going trouser-less in Buckingham Palace?) I found the cartoonish quality detracted a bit from the sympathy and attraction we feel for Holmes and Watson, but only a little. If you're like me and like the public who clamored for more Sherlock Holmes, after Conan Doyle dispatched him down a waterfall in the original stories, you're waiting anxiously for Season 3.

This is television writing and acting at its best. And yes, we're all crazy for Benedict Cumberbatch's cheekbones.",1379289600,3,1411,4.949367088607595

I realize the BBC, and the very popular actors, will not likely keep this show running past season 3, but for any Sherlock Holmes fan, this series, and the wonderful writing, is delightful and intelligent and engaging.

I have to admit that I am now completely addicted to it, Benedict Cumberbatch, portrays a modern Sherlock with a tendency to be cold and callus, Benedict is an amazing actor. If you've only seen him in Sherlock you should really watch the movies he has been in, such as War horse, Third Star, and others. Martin Freeman, everyone's favorite hobbit, plays John Watson. I know he played Watson before Bilbo, but he's had a great spike in popularity due to that role.

4454190,4,B004QOB8SO,"This Sherlock Holmes reminds me of the movie The Young Sherlock Holmes in that it features the great detective as a young man.  It is set in this century which is also a different spin and allows us to see how he met Watson and was first introduced to his arch enemy Moriarty.  An entertaining series which requires concentration on the viewers part to understand all of Sherlock's ""deductions"".  Thoroughly enjoyable entertainment.",1378512000,,432,4.972222222222222

Yes there are times where it is a bit predictable and even cheesy(that was the case in the first season too),  but most of the acting is fabulous and so is the script.  Sometimes the Moriarty character is a bit over the top, that would be my only big criticism.  My favorite Holmes and Watson team that I have seen in any movie or television adaptation.",1378252800,,417,4.376623376623376

4454209,5,B004QOB8SO,Thriller. Keeps us on the edge of our seats.  Intellectually stimulating.  Great plot twists and continuity between episodes.  I'm sure the U.S. producers are already working on a crappier version.,1378252800,,197,5.5

4454217,5,B004QOB8SO,"I really love the dynamic between Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch. Since day one, I've loved how absolute Dr.  Watson's and Sherlock's bond is.

4454219,5,B004QOB8SO,Wish the Bbc would make this an actual series it has potential. Cumberbatch rocks as Sherlock however I'm not sure how he survived the fall in the cliff hanger ending in season too but was enjoyable to say the least. Also the guy that played Moriarty played him exceptionitly well. Thank you for such a great series even though 3 episodes are kind of short.,1377993600,,357,4.507692307692308

I was worried I would not understand the accents, I had no problem. I was concerned it was one more remake, but they kept the story true to the books and did a great job modernizing it.  But beware, we watched the entire season 1 in one sitting plus all but the last episode of season 2.  We could not wait for the next episode. I really loved it, I highly recommend it even if you are not a Sherlock Holmes fan, this series is so worth it.",1377907200,,537,3.8727272727272726
4454231,5,B004QOB8SO,I'm in love with Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes. Now add that it's a Steven Moffit production and you've got the best. The whole cast brings I intrigue and humor. Thank you Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson and Mark Gatiss as Mycroft Holmes.,1377820800,,245,4.72093023255814

4454233,5,B004QOB8SO,"The BBC Sherlock series is terrific...smart, funny, and a thoroughly entertaining and authentic update to classic Sherlock Holmes tales. The placement in the contemporary begs the comparison the other recent update ""Elementary"". The similarities end there. Sherlock has very different look, feel and pacing than the American product. I think there are things to enjoy about Elementary, but Sherlock is immeasurably more ""authentic"". The two leads - Cumberbatch as Holmes and Martin Freeman (see Office and Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) are fantastic! It's a must see.",1377820800,,570,5.563218390804598
4454234,5,B004QOB8SO,"By the second season, the phenomenon that is Sherlock really hit its stride; Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman became international stars in their own right, as did Andrew Scott, who portrays Moriarty with gleeful, deadly zest. The entire world waits breathlessly for the next season (sometime in 2014?), Mssrs. Cumberbatch and Freeman have become movie stars along the way (not just for TV, kiddies!), and the show's meticulous attention to detail and use of present-day London for the setting are a total joy to behold. Hopefully, this newfound fame won't deter these gifted actors from continuing their collaboration.",1377820800,,626,5.3979591836734695

4454236,5,B004QOB8SO,"It always feels like lightning in a bottle when a series debuts while firing on all cylinders. The first season of Sherlock was riveting, refreshing must-see TV powered along by superb acting, writing, and directing - heck, even the soundtrack was putting its back into it! The season ended on a suspenseful note that seemed impossible to top. And then they did! Enough said.",1377734400,,375,4.875

4454241,5,B004QOB8SO,"The direction is superior and the suspense is palpable. Acting by Cumberbatch (playing Sherlock) is superb, especially when he rattles of an analysis of a person by their look, clothing, hands, etc. Can't wait to see the 3rd season. Unlike American mystery shows, the language is high-brow, the settings are impeccably thought out, and the violence is muted.
It is a pity that the series has only 3 episodes a season.",1377734400,,417,4.887323943661972
4454242,3,B004QOB8SO,"I think the title of this review says it all.  Not a bad show, the mysteries are interesting for sure but I somehow always feel like I'm watching House be a dick as mysteries get solved.  Either way, enjoyable to an extent but be careful of the 90 minute run-time on each episode.",1377734400,,280,4.264150943396227
4454243,5,B004QOB8SO,Three episodes was not enough.  Episodes 1 and 3 were brilliant and breathtaking.  Episode 2 only seems drab in comparison to the former and later episodes but excellent when compared with the majority of even good shows on television now days.  If you've watched Season 1 this one won't disappoint!,1377734400,,299,4.94

4454260,5,B004QOB8SO,"I was never attracted to the Basil Rathbone movies but the new generation Holmeses are converting me.

One of my teenage sons goes on tears when a new show is recommended by someone whose opinion he values.

Thus he watched all of the Sherlocks in a very short burst of time.

I was pleasantly surprised by it all.

The writing and acting were top notch.",1377561600,,354,4.4

4454262,5,B004QOB8SO,Gather around and you shall enjoy great yarns of Sherlock Holmes. From youth to maturity the yarns spin you in with the endless stories from Watson's view. Only Sir Arthur could write with ability to tell the basic story and let Actors of any age bring you to the game that's afoot.,1377475200,,282,4.4423076923076925

4454266,5,B004QOB8SO,"I love this series, its so witty and such a quality show. I love the chemistry between the characters and the actors do a phenomenal job. I love how John gets to put his military experience to work in the Hounds of Baskerville, he doesn't get much credit from Sherlock, so I appreciate it when it happens. Can't wait for season three!!!",1377388800,,336,4.435483870967742
4454267,5,B004QOB8SO,"Again, what can one say about the incomparable?  Each show gets better and better.  Benedict Cumberbatch continues to display his amazing talent and I thank all the gods for whatever it was that inspired those two genius men, Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat to bring him on as Sherlock.  There has never been a television show to come close to what this show brings to its audience.  Again, I repeat as I did for the Season One review, that I hope and pray there will be at least three more seasons of Sherlock. Every single person I've told to watch the show has become a fan without exception.  At some point I will probably wear out my DVD's of Sherlock, but long before then I will have bought more and have them at hand. Being a chronic insomniac I spend many nights watching the shows.  They NEVER fail to entertain, delight and inspire me.  And once again, repeating myself, I anxiously await Season Three.",1377388800,,911,4.5182926829268295
4454278,5,B004QOB8SO,"Ordinarily if one were to say ""more of the same"" it wouldn't be a good thing; in this case, more of the same is more brilliance and entertainment from Moffat and his team for this Sherlock series.  It isn't uncommon for a second and successive season to feel the pressure of the first's success and get bigger, and all too often that translates to more explosions, car chases, serial killers and unnecessary flash. Here we have simply, if that adjective can be used to describe Sherlock, more of the wit and perfect pacing that we fell in love with in the first series.  In the case of Sherlock, more of the same is a very good thing indeed.",1377388800,,641,4.423728813559322

I was completely blown away. Each episode is easily the equivalent, in terms of directing, acting, & plot, to nearly any mainstream movie release. They're that good. Actually, they're brilliant.

Enjoy them while they keep making them as the actors are both on the brink of super stardom. I fully expect Cumberbatch to be a major character in the new Star Wars movies. How can't he be?",1376784000,,469,4.7073170731707314

4454317,5,B004QOB8SO,"An interesting show for sure. Video and production quality is that of a feature-length film. Each story can be independent, but best viewed in sequence. Well-acted, complex plot that is sol easy to follow. Character motives are easy to surmise. Fast paced and well written to the point where you wouldn't think you're watching a full hour and a half show (no commercials). Enough information is given about each character without blatantly speaking it that you feel immediately attached to each of them as if you've known them for a long time, probably b/c the script doesn't introduce you to characters so much as assumes you already know them already, which lets them reveal more intimate details about the characters than blatantly stating them.
While a serious show, there are some moments of comic relief, particularity the relationship between Sherlock and Watson. (personal note: I don't agree with fans (aka fanatics) that force two characters to be together without their consent.)
The downside to this series is that each season is only 3 episodes long. Even if you broke each show into 45min segments, that's still only 6. But then, as they say, ""quality over quantity,"" and they certainly deliver on quality.",1376697600,,1220,5.044554455445544

Benedict Cumberbatch inhabits Sherlock as if he was born to play the role and Martin Freeman is the perfect foil as John Watson. Stories that fans know and love, such as ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" have new life and relevance breathed into them. As for Moriarty, Sherlock's legendary nemesis, Andrew Scott chews the scenery with unabashed glee and is never more devious and chilling than in ""The Reichenbach Fall,"" which is some of the best television I've ever seen. With an ending that had me gasping and screaming ""WHAT?"" at the screen, I can't say enough good things about the way this series has me in its grip.

This version is the five star successor to the Jeremy Brett series.

Cumberbatch as Holmes continues to win over fans by bringing just enough heart to an otherwise wholly unlikeable human being. He is himself possesed of a rapier sharp intellect, so he brings a believable gravitas to Holmes' rapid fire deductions.

Why four stars, then?

Well, as brilliant as it is, I am not wholly on board with the programme's depiction of Holmes and Moriarty.  I do quite like the character that Cumberbatch portrays, but it is at odds with how I really wanted Holmes to be portrayed.  Moriarty...  Well...  I absolutely loathed Scott's portrayal of the character and... well, the casting of the role.  I understand that the writers/directors/producers/actors may have wanted to separate themselves from the established characters to make them their own, but it's called Sherlock Holmes, not Bones; Castle; The Mentalist; or Numb3rs.

Despite all of that, it is the best crime drama I've ever seen.  Heck it's one of the best television programmes I've ever seen.

I'll also say this:  Cumberbatch's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes puts me in mind of a super-intelligent Bernard Black from the British sitcom ""Black Books"".  His typical wardrobe is incredibly similar, his attitude, his reclusiveness, his annoyance and impatience with mundane people, and even some of his mannerisms.  Watch Black Books, you'll see.

While never showing what transpires, one's mind and imagination catapults you into a cat and mouse game of wit and mystery.  The suspense holds you in a transvex state trying to outguess what the producers have in store for Sherlock and Watson.  I would highly recommend this series for those individuals who seek more than just gory murder mysteries and unsolved phenomenon.",1375488000,,640,4.888888888888889

4454424,5,B004QOB8SO,"The writing is exceptional, the acting is impeccable, the cinematography is excellent. This has the feel of a movie, not a TV series and certainly NOT a made-for-TV American movie. Sherlock Holmes is much more callous and arrogant than his literary counterpart in this series, though this season gives you a glimpse of hope that his arrogance is tempered a bit.  It is not, in my opinion, appropriate for kids under high school age because of some sexual content and innuendo.

The only episode that I didn't like was the one involving Irene Adler even though it had a brilliant beginning and some of the best lines in the series (""I always hear 'hit me in the face' when you're talking but it is usually subtext"").  In the book, she was supposed to be kind as well as brilliant.  However, with one exception, in which she rises to Sherlock's challenge to solve one of his cases, she doesn't appear to be very smart, just manipulative and cruel.  It is also an episode which I will not allow my young teen daughter to watch because of all the overt sexual content with S&M undertones.

My daughter and husband also love this series and we are eagerly anticipating being able to watch Season 3 (hint, hint, BBC).",1375056000,,1211,4.609302325581395
4454425,5,B004QOB8SO,Best shows on TV.  My husband and I loved it.  Can't wait for Season 3.  Benedict Cumberbatch is wonderful.  A must see.,1375056000,,120,4.318181818181818
4454426,5,B004QOB8SO,"I think Season 2 was even better than Season 1. Mainly because I got to see Benedict's nearly nekkid body in episode 1 of Season 2. Yes, this man has a history of not being shy when it comes to getting nekkid for a role. I wonder if it's in his contract that he gets to be nekkid? With a body like that, I don't see why it isn't MANDATORY for him to do so...lol. Martin Freeman should get a nude scene as well. I expect him to hold up his honor in Season 3. I look forward to the ""Battle of the Hairless Chests"" whenever Season 3 arrives. I WILL have fresh batteries in my remote for the happy event.",1375056000,,600,3.9669421487603307

4454432,5,B004QOB8SO,"Pretty much everything I wrote for the Season One blu-ray could apply to this product, the Season Two blu-ray.  Cumberbatch's Sherlock and Freeman's Dr Watson still have great interplay and show gradual growth -with some bumps here and there- in their (platonic) relationship, the production values on each episode and on the disc itself are still solid.  The modern-day updates to both the time-frame and story as applied to the established Doyle characters provide interesting twists to the viewer (or at least to one viewer - for example, I did NOT see THAT coming in regards to Moriarty).  Yeah, I'm still addicted to Sherlock and I'm still sad I have to wait half a year to find out just how he did *that* and what Dr Watson is going to do once he finds out.",1375056000,,763,4.637037037037037

4454437,5,B004QOB8SO,Sherlock Season 2 was given a 5 star rating because it certainly deserves it.  The 2nd season was a continuation of the relationship between Sherlock and Dr. John Watson from a new perspective not seen before.  Previous knowledge of that relationship was from a long term relationship but this series you get to see the beginning and maturation of that maturation.  Benedict Cumberbatch is just perfect in the tile role and has really opened my eyes to how wonderful of an actor he really is.  This is a great series and I cannot wait for the 3rd season to start!,1374796800,,563,4.6

4454442,5,B004QOB8SO,Season 2 is a wonderful wrap up to a very well done reboot of Sherlock Holmes. The rapport between Holmes & Watson is hilarious.

They do a better job of following his deductions and tie in better to the original stories. And I know that this is a minor point but I like the British actor better.

4454457,5,B004QOB8SO,I love Benedict and love the Sherlock Holmes series. Each show is fascinating and Sherlock and Dr. Watson's relationship to each other is always interesting to see play out. I hope a new series is going to come out soon. As  Benedict gets busier with other movies I worry he won't have time for more Sherlock Holmes shows.,1374451200,,322,4.551724137931035
4454458,5,B004QOB8SO,"I enjoyed this season more than the first.  I think having the Adler and Moriarty characters make things more interesting.  It's definitely a series I'll need to watch again, as I probably missed a few things the first time around.

Also, I actually like the fact that each episode is a mini movie in it's own.  Really allows the cast/production to flush out details and develop the plot/characters more.

I don't this type of series is for anyone though.  If you're into some mystery, deep characters, a little bit of intellectual engagement, and don't need there to be gratuitous romance, then this series is for you.

4454481,5,B004QOB8SO,I love the new Sherlock!  The stories are exciting and the actors fit their parts so perfectly.  I hope this series keeps up for years to come.,1374192000,,143,4.2592592592592595

4454484,5,B004QOB8SO,It was a season just as good as the first season. I really hate the way it ended with no closure. I guess it will resume later starting from his plunge.( don't want to give it away to other watchers) I will be monitoring future seasons because I really enjoyed the show..,1374105600,,271,4.230769230769231

4454486,5,B004QOB8SO,"Sherlock comes off as an antisocial individual who acts as if he is smarter and better than everyone around him often insulting others. But I think he may be somewhat autistic and his lack of social graces is his way to hide from a world that he doesn't fit in.

I enjoyed season one and bought season two and will wait for season three to come out and buy it too.  In this season, we see Sherlock learning to trust Dr. Watson, Mrs. Hudson (his landlady) and Molly Hooper (lab tech in local hospital who has a crush on Sherlock).  It isn't easy for Sherlock to allow others to get close to him but it seems he is thinking of these few people as his friends and someone he can trust. Detective Inspector Lestrade may be part of this short list--he certainly seems loyal to Sherlock no matter how insulting Sherlock is to him.

What I found really neat was Dr. Watson starting a Blog about Sherlock Holmes and the cases they both deal with and solve. In this modern-day Sherlock Holmes, Watson's Blog makes the sleuth a global celebrity.

Season Two has three feature films and I bought the DVD's.",1374019200,,1095,4.4278606965174125
4454487,5,B004QOB8SO,"You've got to love this series.  It's so well done.  It's brilliant!  Sherlock, Dr. Watson, Mrs. Hudson and of course, Moriaty.  So looking forward to Season 3.  It is coming!!!!",1373932800,,178,4.8
4454488,4,B004QOB8SO,"I actually watched Season 1 and Season 2 back to back over 2 days' time.  This is probably not the way it was intended to be seen. That being said, I enjoyed season 2 more than Season 1.  The only episode I didn't enjoy at all was the second one, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles, ' which in my opinion, was truly terrible.  They were trying for a completely non-supernatural, modern-science update of the classic Sherlock Holmes story, and it just didn't come off.  Not even watching Sherlock have an emotional freak-out moment could save this episode....it was more disturbing than revealing, a waste of a good Benedict Cumberbatch performance (now that's criminal!) Watson was wasted there also, and that's doubly bad, because the Watson in this update of Sherlock Holmes' adventures is far more interesting, much more of a partner.  I was getting truly tired of having it repeatedly shown that Watson's lovelife is awful, thanks in part to his association with Sherlock, in that episode.  But enough of Episode 2.  In Season 2 we also find out a lot more about Mycroft Holmes, who's more complex and interesting, than I could have imagined Mycroft to be. That was a pleasant surprise.  We meet him again in Episode 1 and in 3.  The third episode was very difficult to watch, very intense, very well done....except for the end, which was completely predictable.  The first episode, 'A Scandal in Belgravia', was really good, except for the end (again!), which was IMHO, just stupid.  I liked the twist on Irene Adler's character (forgive the pun), and I love plot elements that are different/fresh/innovative, so this one was definitely fun to watch.  But I just hate it when the end isn't as interesting as the beginning, because that's what keeps you coming back.  Love Benedict Cumberbatch, love Martin Freeman, love the great partner chemistry, love the whole concept of an updated Sherlock.  I hope Season 3 is a cut above the first 2 because my patience is running out.",1373932800,,1976,4.824925816023739
4454489,5,B004QOB8SO,"I was home with my daughter sitting in the living room and I put this show on.  I was curious if it was any good. I liked both actors work, recently watching the new movies they star in, the Hobbit and Star Trek.  My 20 yr. old daughter had her nose in her laptop, as she usually does, not paying me much attention.  By the end of the show, she was laughing and we were both really into the story.  We went on to watch all of season 1 together and she watched all of season 2 without me.  It will be forever a memory for me, that we sat in a room together on Sherlock's journey.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!",1373932800,,602,3.975
4454490,5,B004QOB8SO,The only thing wrong with Sherlock is that they don't have more episodes. I can't wait until they have more.,1373932800,,108,4.45

4454492,4,B004QOB8SO,"I still like season 1 better,this was a good season overall..only bad thing about it was trying to make Sherlock seem dead at the end to fool the bad guy..which..is realy crazy and someone should bump him off....please let there be a season 3...paul",1373846400,,249,4.681818181818182
4454493,5,B004QOB8SO,"This series is excellent in many ways, but my favorite part of the series is the interaction between Sherlock and John.  Cumberbatch and Freeman portray these two men, who are equals though not in the same areas, and their friendship.  It's this friendship that keeps the show interesting.",1373846400,,289,5.0
4454494,5,B004QOB8SO,"Same thing.  Everything about it is just great.  It is entertaining, filled with suspense.  Arrived in good condition and on time.",1373846400,,130,5.095238095238095

4454498,5,B004QOB8SO,"I have been a staunch Jeremy Brett fan for years and thought that, at his death, I would never see another Sherlock Holmes again.  However, Benedict and Martin have captured every nuance of Arthur Conan Doyle's characters AND then managed to translate this delightful duo into the modern high tech era we know today.  What brilliant acting!  I hope we have the pleasure of these two actors plying their craft for years to come.  Welcome to the top of the heap, gentlemen!  You have truly done it...",1373673600,,498,4.67816091954023

4454500,5,B004QOB8SO,"I have seen and read many Sherlock Holmes stories, including all of the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories, so I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this new modernized version of Sherlock. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are a unique Sherlock and Watson. They both use their considerable acting skills to make the characters believable. The stories engage you from the very beginning and you can't wait to see how it turns out and how Watson will deal with Sherlock's outrageous behavior. Watson's response is surprising. This continues to be a top quality series from BBC. I actually like this series better than the recent Sherlock movies.",1373587200,,656,5.027522935779817

I am giving this 2 stars because I accidentally clicked ""buy the season"" rather than buy the one episode I wanted and now can't return it.  I already own episode 1...so please tell me why I had to pay the entire price for the full season?  I'm disappointed in Amazon for not having a ""complete the season"" option like iTunes has.  I don't understand why they don't.  So I paid $21.64 + $7.57 for Sherlock Season 2.  Come on Amazon...I bought from you because I wanted to support your digital effort.  Now I'm wishing I hadn't.",1373587200,2,592,4.36697247706422

4454505,5,B004QOB8SO,"Every episode of this series leaves me saying, ""Oh my gosh!  That was SO good!""  The Blu-ray is good quality. Having it at home allows me to indulge in my Sherlock obsession as often as I can get the kids out of the house for 90 minutes.  Sometimes I have to rewind to decipher exactly what's been said in the wonderful British accents, so the DVD is perfect.  I recommend this for anyone who is a mystery fan or anyone who likes really creative cinematography.  Fun to watch.",1373500800,,476,4.363636363636363

4454509,5,B004QOB8SO,Season two continues the excellent writing/acting begun with the episodes of Season 1.  The tight story lines set in the present day UK coupled with the developing relationship of all the characters has each Episode build on it's predecessor.

4454512,5,B004QOB8SO,"A more modern take on the classic stories of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  The characters are updated in a way that makes them very believable and the stories keep a solid, quick pace so it is hard to get bored.  The show is quite funny, and will appeal to anyone with a dry and/or dark sense of humor.  Season Two literally picks up at the moment season one left off (like the Karate Kid: Part II).  Just like season one, the sound editing is wacky...the music blares at ridiculous volume compared to the dialogue, which seems to be a trend with new movies/shows.  (The sound issue is a personal pet peeve, but I know it annoyed the hell out of me so I figured I'd save a few people the headache of music blaring at them unexpectedly during intros or action sequences.)

Great show.  Watch it.",1373328000,,797,4.380952380952381

4454520,5,B004QOB8SO,This show gets even more amazing in season 2 in my opinion. though the cliffhanger at the end is cruel and the fact that they still haven't made the next season is disappointing. This show is phenomenal though and I recommend it as a great version of the Sherlock Holmes story!!!,1373241600,,279,4.490196078431373
4454521,5,B004QOB8SO,"I never liked Sherlock Holmes, and only watched this because my daughter insisted it was fantastic. I agree with her. This is Holmes as you've never seem him before - young, in today's world, and possibly even...sexy? The writing is witty, plots van be a little thin but it doesn't spoil the mood, and the actors are great. I really enjoyed watching both seasons and even watched some episodes more than once, which I rarely do (as Holmes speaks very quickly, it's also necessary to understand everything he says).

The stories are well thought out and using modern technology really adds to the character.  A Sherlock Holmes blog hosted by Watson, indeed.  Just brilliant.

4454553,5,B004QOB8SO,"I have watched all six of  this series (Season 1 and 2) several times.  I think it is brilliant how the writers have taken the classic Arthur Conan Doyle classics and made them current without losing their original cleverness.  The actors are perfectly suited to their characters.  There couldn't have been better choices made.  I love these and I am anxiously waiting for the new season.  Grab the popcorn and enjoy.

4454558,5,B004QOB8SO,"Not just an update of Conan-Doyle.  Also, an interpretation.  True to the original source, but an interesting take on it as well.  Cumberbatch and Freeman are outstanding.  Each episode is like a standalone movie.  The
Baskerville episode was the weakest, but more than offset by the others.  Some were ""edge of the seat"" exciting.",1372377600,,331,5.037037037037037

4454562,5,B004QOB8SO,"The acting is great. The Sherlock and Watson characters warm your heart. The plots are exciting. There is a good mix of drama, intrigue, and humor. I love the way the clues are often written on the items being noticed by Sherlock as he looks at them. He often lists the clues he sees to explain how he came to a particular conclusion. It challenges me to try to be more observant.",1372204800,,380,4.291666666666667

4454567,4,B004QOB8SO,"This show rocks, has a great cast and strong plot lines.  It's seemingly much more true, albeit in a modern context, to the way Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writing than many of the other Sherlock iterations and similar to the recent movies with Robert Downey Jr.",1372204800,,259,4.630434782608695

4454572,5,B004QOB8SO,Love it! Surprise modern day setting. Guy Ritchie meets Sir Doyle himself. This series will infect you!  Each season consists of 3 episodes 1.5 hours long. I anxiously await season 3.,1372118400,,183,4.903225806451613
4454573,5,B004QOB8SO,"This series is great. I was already a Sherlock Holmes fan before checking this series out, and I have been thrilled with these updated versions of the stories. If you did not know, these ""episodes"" are really 90-minute movies, not hour or so long shows. It really gives the writers a lot of time to work with, all to the better. I think ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" is my favorite. It is a treat to watch, wonderfully acted, so darn funny! This series is a clever, imaginative homage to Sir AC Doyle's originals, and I can't wait for season 3!",1372118400,,539,4.4

4454580,5,B004QOB8SO,"Love this show. Lots of action, intrigue, and laughs. Can't wait for the next season. This contemporary Sherlock is very funny, says exactly what he thinks. He's  too brilliant to think about things like social etiquette or feelings.  John Watson is his moral compass, sidekick, and friend. He puts up with Sherlocks eccentricity. The combination of the two personalities make the perfect sleuthing team.",1371945600,,404,5.296875

4454583,5,B004QOB8SO,"So what came first? The BBC version of Sherlock or the version on CBS. True they are very different shows with the same Sherlock arrogance and learning sidekick. The BBC version is smart, well written, and not overly clouded with unneeded drama. For true Sherlock fans that have enjoyed the original books, these short miniseries like episodes are perfect. Also, you cannot beat the acting of a talented actor, who landed the role as the most hated villain in the new Star Trek movie. There was a reason why he was chosen. Enjoy!",1371859200,,529,4.698924731182796

4454589,5,B004QOB8SO,Ben Cumberbatch is a hottie and a very believable Sherlock Holmes. The modern take makes it new and with a nice twist to the original stories. The originals are recognizable but different. Gret series. Can not wait for the next.,1371686400,,228,4.725

4454595,5,B004QOB8SO,"I love Sherlock Holmes.  I love mysteries and since this is the father of the modern mystery, I love this incarnation of the most famous detective in all of literature!  Cumberbatch is able to capture that relentlessness that Holmes was known for and Freeman's Watson is perfect.  The updating doesn't detract from the essential characteristics of the main characters, which was my initial fear.  Instead, they give Holmes and Watson a whole new set of tools to use and make it better.  Love it!  Cannot wait for Season Three to air on PBS!!!",1371427200,,542,4.774193548387097

4454602,5,B004QOB8SO,"I love this season! They put a cool twist on some very famous Sherlock Holmes stories: Irene Adler, the Hounds of Baskerville, and the Reichenbach Falls. Irene Adler turns out to be a dominatrix and Mycroft tries to use Sherlock to get some compromising photos back from her. He is unsuccessful, of course, since the story is Adler is the one woman who was able to fool Sherlock. This episode is probably my favorite of the entire series because of how all these little pieces of the puzzle fall into place at the end; the play between Sherlock and Irene gets very complicated (luckily they explain most of it at the end). The very end is really cute, too, when you finally see how much Sherlock really likes her.

The Hounds of Baskerville had some really good John and Sherlock moments. One of my favorite parts is when Sherlock says to John, ""I don't have friends. I just have one."" Adorable! John doesn't have a very good episode, what with Sherlock drugging him and basically using him as a lab rat without telling John, but luckily John is very forgiving. It's also interesting when Sherlock is telling John he's never not been able to rely on his own senses after he sees the gigantic hound which cannot possibly exist.

The Reichenbach fall is a very depressing episode, I'm not going to lie. Moriarty returns and sets his plan into motion to burn Sherlock. Although I hate Moriarty, I do have to admit the way he goes about doing it is brilliant (which Sherlock also appreciates, even when it's ruining him). I love John in this episode because he refuses to believe what the media is saying about Sherlock. This episode is a roller coaster of emotions, and the end is just awful. There are numerous theories of what actually happened, but no one really knows yet; it really sucks the third season STILL isn't out, but it is coming at the end of 2013, so our wait is almost over!",1371254400,,1888,4.55
4454603,5,B004QOB8SO,I think this is the BEST Holmes/Watson pairing ever!  Love the show not only because of the brilliant acting but it's also entertaining as well.  It's stays true to the books even it is set on modern day.  Can't wait for Season 3,1371254400,,229,4.27906976744186

4454632,5,B004QOB8SO,"SPOILER WARNINGS:

Benedict Cumberpatch and Martin Freeman steal the television screen in BBC's ""Sherlock"". Opening from the end of the first season, we find our unlikely heroes in a face-off against Jim Moriarty, a psychopath who's engagement of Sherlock is out of boredom more than anything. When he is distracted and leaves the boys be, it's a surprise. But before too long, we're off on a new adventure, this time with a member of the Royal Family being blackmailed by the intoxicating 'dominatrix', Irene Adler, and Sherlock's brother bringing him in to get the information away from her.

The second episode again brings in a tale we all remember, the Hounds of Baskerville. This updated edition has the hound being the result of a hallucinegenic developed at the Baskerville military base. Interestingly, an assumption many fans of Sherlock had is all but confirmed by Watson and Lestrade, as they imply Sherlock has Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism (which, coincidentally, is no longer recognized in the United States but is still recognized in other parts of the world). Many, including myself, thought this was the case and it was gratifying to see it make it into the show.

Of course, the third episode is one we all wondered how they were going to handle, and I must say, they pulled it off masterfully. Martin Freeman delivers a remarkably emotional performance of a grieving Dr. Watson as he tries to move past his best friend's death (for we know Sherlock is his best friend, despite Sherlock wanting to say otherwise).

Some people say Benedict Cumberpatch doesn't live up to the performance Robert Downey Jr. gave. I disagree. I think Benedict's variation combines not only to the nature of Downey's Sherlock, but the technological prowess of Downey's other big screen persona (though admittedly on a lesser scale).

All in all, I would recommend this season, and the first, and any seasons that follow, to my family and friends, and anyone who loves a good sarcastic remark. One remark that still sends me into laughter is ""I'm not a psychopath, I'm a high-functioning sociopath, Anderson! Do the research!""",1370563200,,2131,4.9915492957746475

4454649,5,B004QOB8SO,"""Sherlock"" impressed me. It has a brilliant cast, and amazing dialogue, plot, and photography.  The creators' ideas put unique spins on the show while still remaining in line with Conan's intent.  If you are a real Holmes fan, the frequent (and sometimes humorous) nods will be fun to see.
The second season is even better than the first, in terms of writing and filming.  The character of Sherlock is fascinating and well-played; the humor is sly and surprising; the scenery and sets are gorgeous.  Certain parts--especially the scene at Buckingham Palace and the cunning sequence between the Irene Adler's living room and the moor--stand out for their amazing photography, while the rooftop/phone call/season ending was so tense and heart-wrenching it held me spellbound.  I had to watch it twice.
As usual, the characters are fun and compelling--I especially enjoy dear Mrs. Hudson and sweet, sweet Molly; while the normal, ""mundane"" but enjoyable characters of John and Lestrade nicely balance Sherlock's quirkiness.  The partnership between Sherlock Holmes and Watson was even more evident this season; each of them had to frequently give up something...time, trust, and more...to keep their friendship going.  Both John and Sherlock make each other angry from time to time, but in the end (literally), John remains unshakably loyal and Sherlock turns from his philosophy (""Alone protects me"") to adopt John's (""Nope: Friends protect people"").
Every second of this series is utterly enjoyable, and is without a doubt my favorite British show ever.  It is smart and addictive, perfect for fans of mystery thrillers and good drama.  Please, don't miss it!",1370044800,,1658,5.273764258555133

4454681,5,B004QOB8SO,"I've always been a Sherlock Holmes fan ever since I saw the first movie of the cinema series in America. I saw it multiple times in theaters and was in absolute awe of the character that is Sherlock Holmes. And then of course I glanced through the books, but these were during my preteens years where I wasn't really into the world of good stories commonly associated with ""nerds"" or ""geeks"" aka smart people. However, right after Sherlock, before I really got into the books, I discovered more classic fandoms like Doctor Who (Huge Doctor Who Fan), Star Trek and instead of reading Sir Arthur Doyle's books, I was reading science books.

So, I mostly forgot about the idea of Sherlock until suddenly I was noticing a this ""Sherlock"" thing popping up over the web in the realm of Doctor Who sites, images, tumblr, etc. I was intrigued... because it looked interesting, but I didn't really think it would be on the edge of most of my series.

Boy, was I wrong. The writing is impeccable. The character chemistry is amazing. You fall in love with the series in seconds and the story flows so well with only 6 episodes! They write Sherlock in a unique way, and my personal perspective on the difference between the American version and this is the writing, simple as that. The American versions seem to put more effort in the cinematography, while these guys making gripping stories.

4454685,3,B004QOB8SO,"I love period Holmes stories, but nearly every attempt to modernize the iconic detective falls flat -- until this series. I absolutely fell in love with Season 1 of ""Sherlock.""  Moffatt does a brilliant job of moving the characters into the 21st century and making them believable.

That said, I expected to love Season 2 with the same relish. ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" was an imaginative update to the original. I greatly prefer McAdams' more nuanced performances as Irene Adler to Pulver's. It's not that Pulver does badly; she just doesn't really have much of a characterization. I couldn't help wondering whether Adler's dominatrix  predilections were created just to allow her to make the bad pun that she ""beat Sherlock Holmes.""

I also enjoyed ""The Hounds of Baskerville,"" in spite of the government facility being so far-fetched.  Maybe it's because I like the the glowing bunny, even though a secure facility could never mix up test subjects with domestic pets. Despite these silly aspects, the updated story is still self-consistent and entertaining.

I really wanted to love the whole of Season 2, but Steve Thompson's ""The Reichenbach Fall"" is an utterly disappointing ending to the season. Not only does the story seem botched, the characters (particularly that of Moriarty) maintain little or no credibility. Only Watson's character remains somewhat true.

4454691,5,B004QOB8SO,"I didn't think it possible, but season 2 elevated my adoration for Sherlock. Picking up exactly where Season 1 left off, we quickly spiral towards another mystery. The first episode is probably my favorite in this season because we get a closer look at Sherlock, and witness something we haven't before. A female advisary for Holmes, who may, or may not be smitten with the detective. Naturally, Holmes won't make it THAT easy for the viewer to guess what he's thinking, but by the end of the episode, we catch a glimmer of something... I will leave it at that because it's always more fun to watch it for yourself. Episode 2 features the infamous Hound of Baskerville. It is probably the weakest episode in terms of character development but again, we get to witness something special when Holmes and Watson are on screen together. Episode 3 is a real nail-biter and leaves you emotionally drained and at the edge of your seat.

What is there left to say about Benedict Cumberbatch that hasn't already been said?  He is even better this season than he was the last, if you can believe that. The dead-pan humour, intense stare (which even Watson remarks on) is magnified here, without ever seeming over-the-top. He even smiles more here! He is still as arrogant and impatient as ever, finding fault with whomever is in his vision and bringing them down to size. Though he is starting to realize he probably shouldn't be so harsh to absolutely everyone he meets, and we see some of the reprocussions that can happen when his mouth runs away with him.

The cinematography is beautiful, the costumes, simple but so nice. I especially love Sherlock's overcoat and blue scarf, which he never seems to forget to wear, even in a dire situation. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well, and I can't wait to see what season three brings. Sherlock Holmes is not only a superb show, but a wonderful character, who now, has easily become one of my favorite characters ever on screen.

It took me awhile to accept Benedict.  I took to Watson right off the Bat!
The production does keep a lot of today's electronic gadgets and advance programming as a contribution to the

4454705,5,B004QOB8SO,This is a really great series.  I ran across this while flying to Asia and accidentally saw an episode in Season 2 first.  I was immediately hooked and purchased season 1 and 2 when I got home.  Our whole family watches this series together.  Our teenage boys love it as well.,1368835200,,276,4.352941176470588

4454707,5,B004QOB8SO,"If you can't find any other reason to watch this show, do yourself a favor and watch it for Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. With the first season under their belts, the two have even more chemistry than before. This is evident from the first episode, A Scandle in Belgravia, when the two are laughing their asses off while sitting on a couch, with Sherlock wrapped in nothing but a white sheet. The stories are great, with good mystery, don't get me wrong. But this show wouldn't work, and probably wouldn't be moving into it's third season, without these two to knock their respective roles out of the park.

While going on about the two main stars, Andrew Scott is no slouch as Moriarty. It took me a little bit to get used to how he speaks, which is kind of over the top, but it fits the role of mad genius perfectly. He is quite the match for Sherlock, especially in the awesome finale, The Reichenbach Fall"". The character and actor are quite brilliant in the episode.

Basically, the short of it is: watch the show! My personal favorites, out of the two seasons, are:

1: A Study in Pink
2. The Great Game
3. The Reichenbach Fall",1368748800,,1144,4.464114832535885

The Stories Are wonderfully Crafted By The Brilliant Steven Moffat (You May Know Him From His Work On Doctor Who) And Will Keep You Guessing And Shocked Until The End...And Then Some. This Show Also Uses Brilliant, Innovative Devices For Maximum Visual Pleasure. For Example, When Someone Recieves A Text Message, instead Of Cutting To A Shot Of their Mobile, It Will Show The Text Onscreen, Allowing The Viewer To Read It, And Watch The Reaction Of The Characters.

Season two starts with a classic good vs evil and ends with our collective hearts in our throats. The stories, once again classic, are modernized. This is no easy thing to do properly. And yet it is done, not only properly, but with a superb view to keeping the Sherlock character intact in a world of trash press, television, cell phones, town cars and villains with vast amounts of money. Baker Street is intact, Mrs. Hudson is long suffering and has much to mutter about, so is perfect. The Season 2 cliff hanger is....shocking, heartbreaking, exciting and makes the wait for Season 3 seem even longer.",1368489600,,756,4.649253731343284

4454723,5,B004QOB8SO,"After watching Season 1, I was a little bit worried that Sherlock could never meet that level again. Luckily, I was very wrong. Sherlock remains a smart, funny, fast-paced mystery show while tackling some of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most iconic stories. 'A Scandal in Belgravia' and 'The Reichenbach Fall' are as good or better than anything in Season 1, but 'The Hounds of Baskerville,' while still incredibly enjoyable, fails to reach the same level of quality.

Enter the very different contemporary seasons. The producers and writers have taken the stories, and re-told them in a 21st century light.

The characters are alive in this series. The stories are very well written, and are full of surprizes for Holmes fans. I suspect that people who see this series, will react much like the original readers of Conan Doyles stories did in their time.",1368144000,,556,4.967741935483871

Enjoyed all of the incarnations over the years (Basil Rathbone, Jeremy Brett, RDJ).

This is hands down my favorite. The writing is intelligent and complex; the actors are perfectly cast and incredibly talented.  The bromance between Holmes and Watson is brilliantly played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman and it is what gives this series its humor, pathos, and humanity.

American television might take a lesson from Sherlock, which is sexy and suspenseful without graphic sex or violence.

Season 3 can't come soon enough.",1368144000,,633,5.227722772277228

4454781,5,B004QOB8SO,"I started watching this after I finished reading all the Sherlock Holmes books and after watching Guy Richie's movies. I was reluctant to watch these because I didn't want to get 'sucked in' to a TV series and I couldn't see how they could possibly put Sherlock Holmes into modern day time period and make it work. But, it was free with Amazon Prime and I needed a show to fall asleep to. Well, let's just say I haven't slept much over the last couple of weeks! I couldn't stop watching, and am really sad to have finished all 6 episodes already. The quality is amazing: I kept thinking, this is NOT a TV show, this is a movie -- no wonder they only do 3 per season. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting/character development is great. Most of all, I am impressed with how well the stories have translated to modern day time. The clever changes (from Watson being a writer to a blogger, for example) work incredibly well.

I was hooked in about 5 minutes into the first episode, and now I can't imagine my life without watching this show. From hilarious anecdotes to tense heart wrenching moments, this show keeps you on edge. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are gods amongst men. Their performances are too great for words, and if I could I would thank them for their brilliant work. The season finales are full of suspense and emotion and it keeps you on edge until the very end. I can't wait for season 3 to start.",1366761600,,639,4.565217391304348

4454785,5,B004QOB8SO,A great twist on a Modern version of Sherlock Holmes.  Sherlock is like Spock from Star Track in this series in that he wants to keep emotion out of the equations.

My wife and I were home on a crappy day and decided to give Season 1 a try and we were hooked after the first episode. The second season started to get a little hokey in terms of the plot lines. Some of the explanations were just too convenient or didn't make any sense at all. Overall, still a great show and I can't wait for the third season.",1366761600,,448,4.1022727272727275

If you pay attention to Sherlock you can actually figure out what he's going to do, but not necessarily the how of what he is going to do.  My favorite episode would have to be A Scandal in Belgravia quickly followed by the season finale which is why I said I can't wait to see Season 3 and see if I'm right.",1366502400,,459,3.872340425531915

4454804,5,B004QOB8SO,"I greeted the announcement of yet another reworking of Sherlock Holmes with dread. As a dyed-in-the-wool Sherlockian traditionalist and lover of Conan Doyle's written works, I detest as a rule any attempt to translate those works to the small or large screen.  I let down my guard for Jeremy Brett's masterful portrayal of Sherlock in the ITV series, especially when remained (largely) true to the original material, but that was the lone exception. Suffice it to say that ""Sherlock"" was a revelation and a shockingly welcome addition to the canon.  This reworking of the stories, transporting them to a different era and re-imagining the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, the creators of ""Sherlock"" have managed to remain true to the spirit of the originals while departing entirely from the original story lines.  What makes this series work is the intelligence of the writing and the truth of the portrayals of the principal characters.  Benedict Cumberbatch manages to capture Sherlock's essence with his Asperger's-inflected portrayal and rapier-sharp wit and his relationship to the police is well-imagined.  Dr. Watson, while not as memorable a figure, is solidly enough portrayed so as not to grate.  And the stories themselves are a treat.  The creators are playful enough to use the original titles as starting points while recreating the stories from whole cloth.  For the Sherlockians amongst us, little details are provided (the cab driver as the villain in A Study in Pink, the cell phone in the hidden safe in A Scandal in Belgravia, etc.) to keep us titillated.  Overall, the second season featured stronger story writing than the impressive first season, offering hope for increasing riches in the future.  Bravo to all involved!",1366243200,,1758,5.180212014134276

4454807,5,B004QOB8SO,"Of the many actors who have played Sherlock Holmes from Basil Rathbone to Jeremy Brett to Robert Downey, none has done a better job of capturing the essential oddness of the man than Benedict Cumberbatch.  By playing Holmes as a quasi-sociopath, he makes his obsessive brilliance seem believable.  He also pulls off what is perhaps the hardest assignment for an actor, namely,  portraying a genius and making us believe in him. He's helped in this regard by the clever device of on-screen phrases that tell us what he's deducing from the things he is seeing.  The writing is crisp and funny with occasional in-jokes (a flight that is going to be bombed is Flight 007, for example) and there are strong actors in the other roles.

4454812,5,B004QOB8SO,"In the past five years, we have seen three different adaptations of Sherlock Holmes, this version, the Robert Downey, Jr. films, and CBS's Elementary.  Of those three, Sherlock is definitely the best because there are no unnecessary scenes, like the Robert Downey, Jr. films, and no major departures from the original stories, like Elementary.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are brilliant as Sherlock and Watson, and the supporting cast member are excellent as well.  The writing is wonderful with episodes directly based off of the original stories, along with winks and nods towards some of Doyle's shorter Holmes stories as well.  It is almost impossible to pick a favorite episode, although I am partial towards The Hounds of Baskerville since I am from Indiana.  Not to be missed.",1365811200,,795,5.1796875

4454819,4,B004QOB8SO,"Sherlock Holmes has always fascinated me since I was a child watching Basil Rathbone do his sleuthing. He was always austere and definitely strange. This new series doesn't stray from that exterior detective. However, there is a peeping through at Holmes as we come to know him through the eyes of Watson. Holmes is definitely brilliant, definitely strange, yet a person who ""secretly"" loves those people who think they know him but don't. Ultimately, I came to love this particular version of Sherlock because I did see his humanity-because he did have a heart for someone other than himself.
I loved this Sherlock so much I hated the fact that the series was over. I wanted to travel with them again and watch Sherlock solve his cases. Unlike most shows, I could not predict the endings or even if I guessed ""who"", I didn't know ""why"".
This version of Holmes is a definite winner. It's a series you won't want to let go of even after you know it's the finale. Finally, a Sherlock to embrace.

Having just reread The Hound of the Baskervilles, I had especial fun with that episode as I watched for all of the little references to the original. Great fun!

If you have not watched Sherlock BBC than you are most certainly missing out.",1364947200,,323,4.785714285714286
4454845,5,B004QOB8SO,Benedict Cumberbatch will be remembered as one of the best Sherlock Holmes ever!  Excellent series set in a modern setting.,1364947200,,123,5.15
4454846,5,B004QOB8SO,Benedict Cumberbatch ( who will never be type casted with a name like his ) is brilliant in his portrayal of a Young Sherlock Holmes. And only an actor as great as Martin Freeman can stand up to Cumberbatch's Holmes. Not only are the stories great to watch but the chemistry between them and the rest of the cast is marvelous !!!!!!,1364860800,,332,4.370967741935484

4454848,5,B004QOB8SO,"The first season was amazing, the second one even more so.  It just keeps getting better, so far.  I love the actors, they're all so amazingly talented and have put a lot of effort into their work, though watching them they make it look easy and seamless.  Great show.  May they keep going for many years to come.",1364860800,,313,4.344827586206897
4454849,3,B004QOB8SO,i am unsure if the dvd works cause the print was so small i did not know it would not play on my dvd player that is why it only gets an ok,1364860800,,138,3.212121212121212
4454850,5,B004QOB8SO,"It is so nice to have the concept of Sherlock Holmes updates to current times.  This presentation has great personalities, chief of which is Benedict Cumberbatch and his protrayal of Sherlock.  The cast interacts flawlessly and there is a delightful blend of suspense and humor in the scripts.  I only wish there were more than 3 episodes per season...it's just not enough of Sherlock.  BTW, catch Cumberbatch as the villain in the new Star Trek movie.  He's really good.",1364860800,,471,4.9113924050632916

4454856,5,B004QOB8SO,I have seen my share of detective dramas on tv but this one is the best! What I find very unique and satisfying is that it runs for one and hour and does justice to sir Arthur's story! Not only the plot but I enjoy rich production value and music and how sherlock's thoughts/deductions are unfolded in the story.,1364601600,,312,4.305084745762712
4454857,5,B004QOB8SO,"Being a Jeremy Brett fan, I didn't think I'd like this. I was wrong. The characters are solid, the special effects are used extremely well to illustrate what Sherlock sees as he processes, and the stories are well done.

4454863,3,B004QOB8SO,"I really like the portrayal of Watson.  And I like the Sherlock very much.  Perfect people for the characters.  The story line was not always clear.  It was an artsy movie, not a story.",1364515200,,185,4.352941176470588
4454864,5,B004QOB8SO,"Mar. 29 2013

This is one of the most intelligently written TV drama series that I've had the pleasure to have viewed.  Every element of every episode was well acted and well paced. The character development was extraordinary.

After watching Season 2 I downloaded the original works and have begun reading them. Perhaps that is the greatest compliment I can bestow on this production.",1364515200,,385,4.984375

4454870,5,B004QOB8SO,"You'd think people would be tired of the Sherlock Holmes concept, but this show is loads of fun.  What makes this show so great is the relationship between Watson and Holmes.  Watson sometimes is the main character, and seen through his eyes, Sherlock is a struggling misanthrope trying to hold on to what little humanity he has.  The Moriarty sub plots have already jumped the shark a bit, but still, lots of interesting and modernized twists on old favorites like the Hound of the Baskerville.  My only regret is the show was only part of two short seasons.",1364256000,,559,4.673469387755102

While I was visiting a co-worker in Calgary, he and his wife had been watching Season 1 and were talking about how good of a show it was.  I sat down and watched the first/second episode.. at that time I was hooked on this series.

I just finished up Season 2 last night -- what a fantastic show!  I really hope they continue with it.",1364256000,,416,4.227848101265823

4454875,5,B004QOB8SO,"Season 2 continues the definitive modernization of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  The characters are more developed and the chemistry between Sherlock and Dr. Watson develops into a working partnership transcending a period of history but not devolving into a ""buddy"" movie.  Sherlock grows as a person as the series continues.  Worth the time to watch.",1364169600,,355,5.303571428571429
4454876,5,B004QOB8SO,My favorite BBC show just got even better! This is one of my top shows. This season is better than the first! Maybe because of the third episode or the fact that it is back and just as good if not better than the first season. Love everything about this show!,1364083200,,259,4.098039215686274
4454877,5,B004QOB8SO,"It took me a while to finally check this series out and now I'm hooked. It's smart and quirky, intelligent and funny, and the chemistry between Sherlock and Watson is off the charts. My favorite episodes of the whole series are: A Scandal in Belgravia and The Reichenbach Fall. Oh, and I can't forget the superb villain, James Moriarty, played with joyful exuberance by Andrew Scott. This was just a perfect storm of talent, writing, production and a whole lot of fun!",1364083200,,468,4.719512195121951
4454878,5,B004QOB8SO,The only downside is now we have to wait for Season 3!! Cumberbatch is perfect as Sherlock and Watson is outstanding.,1364083200,,117,4.619047619047619
4454879,4,B004QOB8SO,"See my review of Season 1.  My feelings remain the same, though I am obviously interested still interested enough to be watching Season 2.  This season adds the additional intrigue of seeing how some of the most famous Holmes stories (A Scandal in Bohemia, Hound of the Baskervilles, The Final Problem) are transformed and interpreted.

For serious Holmes fans, I highly recommend the recent book ""The House of Silk"", purportedly written by Watson but put under seal for 100 years because of the sensitivity of the events.  While the crime has timely modern aspects, the style is wonderfully indistinguishable from the writing of Conan Doyle himself.",1364083200,,650,5.10377358490566

4454882,5,B004QOB8SO,"Sherlock is smart, edgy, and engaging. A long time Arthur Conan Doyle fan, I've thought I had seen it all when it comes to Sherlock remakes and re-toolings. Not. At. All. Benedict Cumberbatch is truly wonderful. I never want to see another Sherlock ever again unless he's part of it.",1364083200,,283,4.68
4454883,5,B004QOB8SO,"In particular, the Reichenbach Fall offers an explanation for ""Chinese hacking"" exploits in late 2012 and 2013 and for the reasons behind this ""hacking"". I think that this episode in particular was so close to reality that the BBC decided to end the series or make certain any followup series would steer clear of ""sensitive political topics"".",1363910400,,343,5.035087719298246

4454885,5,B004QOB8SO,I saw season one and got hooked.  I had to see what happened.  Season two final show was a nail bitter.  Had a scene I did not see coming.  Hope they do a next season.,1363824000,,167,3.6857142857142855

4454895,5,B004QOB8SO,"This is a fantastic season, and I would argue this is better than the first season by far. It has more intrigue, more plot twist and Sherlock Holmes realizing he's not perfect.",1363737600,,176,4.53125

I like the original movies about this story best.  However it was very intriguing.  Another plus to this show is Benedict Cumberbatch is so handsome!  He's a superb actor.  If you're a Sherlock Holmes fan I highly recommend this PBS series.

4454950,5,B004QOB8SO,"The production values and acting are excellent, as we expect from a BBC production. Martin Freeman's good work in the role as Watson makes the characters more approachable. Episodes are a bit long at 90 to 120 minutes, so it may take more then one evening to get through an episode.

This was the first series I've watched using the Amazon video service, and the experience was very good. I have relatively fast DSL (~5 MB/s), and didn't experience any buffer issues or glitches while watching the  videos. While the Video quality wasn't quite Blu-ray, it was quite acceptable on a large screen HDTV.",1362528000,,600,4.759615384615385
4454951,5,B004QOB8SO,"Though the seasons from the BBC are rather short, the episodes are longer and fairly well thought out.  It's a modern adaptation of some of the original stories, so the details have become slightly more ""sciency"" in the same vein as CSI and similar shows.  (And this show gives a nod to them, in fact.)",1362528000,,302,4.472727272727273
4454952,5,B004QOB8SO,"One night, talking with friends, I said that we did not here a no good modern Sherlock Holmes.  They contradicted saying I should watch ""Sherlock"".  Since this person and I have very similar taste in movies, I watched an episode.  We do not have a good modern Sherlock Holmes.  We have a great Sherlock Holmes set in modern London.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman might be the best Holms and Watson of all time.  They are very believable and a perfect fit for the roles.  Excellent casting is one of the series greatest strengths.  Each part is carefully cast to give us the right look and sound for each part.  Modern London is as much a part of the show as the main characters.  The producers use the city, cell phones, social networks, laptops and modern mores to establish a current day story.
Sherlock Holmes is simply the most observant and smartest person in the world.  He uses these skills to solve the unsolvable puzzle.  His skills make him unpopular with many people and Holmes has no problem disliking them too.  He is prone to hurt felling and/or embarrasses people and be oblivious of this.  Study in Pink and A Scandal in Belgravia shows Holmes at his worst.  His ego forces him to demonstrate these unique abilities while hurting people's feelings.
Doctor Watson is both loyal and annoyed often at the same time.  Watson is the human part and the series faithfully reproduces that.  The two actors play off each other to establish a real relationship that looks and sounds right.
Inspector Lestrade is a very smart man and a good cop.  He uses Holmes and has a grudging fondness for him.
Each episode is a 90-minute movie.  The scripts are adapted from Doyle's stories with respect but changed as required.  The producers show both respect and love for the original stories.  This is NOT an exploitation of the name for a quick buck.  This careful telling is true to the original but adapted to our times.
Each season has three episodes and special features.  These are the three classic stories and they are excellent.
A Scandal in Belgravia a surprising adult adaptation of this story.
The Hound of Baskerville might be the best retelling I have seen.  It is the story we know and love but with an entirely new perspective.
The Reichenbach Falls based on Doyle's' short story The Finial Problem"", in which Holmes and Moriarty square off.  This is an excellent story of hate and ego.
The two season run together and you will want both.  Save a second order and the waiting, order the two now.
Everyone involved and the fans want to do a third season.  However, the producers and the cast have not been able to schedule the time to do it.  We can only hope that this changes.",1362441600,2,2701,4.629473684210526

4454963,5,B004QOB8SO,"I've been a rabid Holmes & Co. fan since I first saw Basil Rathbone in ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" when I was ten. It scared the ""Dickens"" out of me and replaced it with ""Doyle."" It wasn't long before I had my own set of Doyle's complete Holmes' stories. That was over forty years ago. That set wore out over the years and has been twice replaced.
So you can imagine how happy I was as an adult to spot Jeremy Brett as Sherlock. YES! I thought he couldn't be topped as the quintessential Holmes. I was wrong, yet I was right.
Brett was perfect portraying the Victorian Holmes, but - bringing Sherlock into the 21st century?! How could they??!! They did. Boy, did they ever! Fifteen minutes into the first episode and I was hooked!
Cumberbatch was magnificent. Watson was perfectly played by Martin Freeman [I'm waiting to see him as a Hobbit]. Mycroft was slickly proper and a bit spooky ... a very good foil for ""Hat Man and Robin"" as the press headlines called them in ""Scandal in Belgravia"" [Season 2 episode].
Hubby liked Brett as Holmes every bit as much as I and was a bit leery of the new concept. The first episode aired on Masterpiece Theatre on PBS. I watched it alone. When episode 2 aired, hubby was right next to me. We never got to see the third episode until the DVD arrived. We watched the whole DVD the first night possible.  When Season Two became available on DVD, I snatched it up right quick.
We hadn't seen a single episode of Season Two, but the titles were teasing.  Irene Adler? Who? How would they possibly update THE WOMAN? WOW! They did. 5 of 5 stars. The Hound? That rated a 4 of 5. Look out for Bluebell and the puns of Watson's re: other cases. Again, we are teased by the case of the aluminum crutch, referred to originally in ""The Musgrave Ritual."" Some day, someone will have to dig up Holmes notes and write about it. [?]
""Reichenbach Fall"" - I cried through the last thirty minutes, even though I knew Holmes would triumph over Moriarty. Can't wait for Season Three to see how Holmes and Molly pulled it off...<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Season-One/dp/B004132HZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock: Season One</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Return-of-Sherlock-Holmes-Vol-5-The-Musgrave-Ritual-The-Man-with-the-Twisted-Lip/dp/B00008YLTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Return of Sherlock Holmes, Vol. 5 - The Musgrave Ritual & The Man with the Twisted Lip</a>",1362182400,2,2491,5.163366336633663

4454983,4,B004QOB8SO,"We still haven't quite figured out why we like this show so much.

Overall, 'Sherlock' is a great detective series, even without the conceit of reinterpreting such a well worn character (the anticipation of seeing the familiar cases adapted to a contemporary context is a bonus; Season 2's 'Baskerville' episode, for example, though a little farfetched, twists the old classic effectively).  But no one individual element really stands out...

The writing is good (but not great), the acting is great (though it gets a bit predictable into Season 2), the direction and dialogue can get annoying.  But it's still a REALLY entertaining program, and better than a lot of other broadcast offerings.  The fast pace, plot twists, and fresh take on this favorite character are addictive.  My wife and I regret that there are only six episodes between the two seasons (a new 2013 season's production has been scheduled).

Truth be told, we have a good idea why the series is a winner: the casting of the principals is perfect (though Rupert Graves' Lestrade doesn't get much good writing in Season 2).  There are only two real missteps: 1) after the first episode of Season 1, we're never really reminded why Martin Freeman's Watson puts up with Holmes' abuse, and 2) Moriarty is badly cast, badly written, or both; he comes off as a childish, temperamental dandy rather than the criminal reflection of Cumberbatch's Holmes.

While some of Holmes' 'deductions' are a little stretched, the concept is a great new twist (Holmes as an emotionally stunted, hyperactive virgin), and the contemporary interpretation is really well executed.  There are other elements that induce eye-rolling--the text overlays that show Holmes' thoughts get aggravating--but are acceptable as a vehicle for illuminating the character's quirks.

The first episode of Season 2 is great.  The [re]introduction of the Irene Adler character (as a manipulative dominatrix to the wealthy and powerful) and the final 10 minutes (except for the final, postscript scene) are tightly written, nicely directed, and just plain unsettling.

Looking forward to new episodes.  Highly recommended.",1361836800,,2149,5.245614035087719

4454993,5,B004QOB8SO,The show manages to keep the feeling of the original stories while setting the characters in modern-day London.

I watch little ""tv"" because I despise the laziness of reality shows. Each of the Sherlock episodes are better than most of the blockbuster crap Hollywood has been churning out.  The series (seasons 1 and 2) is phenomenal. I don't give it 5 stars because I am trying  to not cheapen the rating system. This show was faultless, in my opinion and deserves your attention.

4454997,5,B004QOB8SO,"BBC's Sherlock is one of the best shows of all time. Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock is fresh and entertaining, and he really nails the persona. Much better than just having an egotistical, airy personality. I love the mental disorder take. Martin Freeman does a great job as Watson, providing the perfect match to Cumberbatch's Sherlock. He's able to provide perfect wit and manner, along with the touching trust and loyalty that you would expect.

The episodes are all an hour and a half long, so they are each like their own little movie. But, the tackle some of the best mysteries from the books, and the show, from beginning to end, is so clever. Not to mention the large plot that follows throughout the show. Everything ties together so well, in the end. It's also a great intellectual show, as they give you all the clues and hold out solving until the end, leaving you to put everything together and make your best guess.

I heard season 3 was going to be the last season, so we'll see. Either way, I'm looking forward to it!

Would highly recommend.",1361664000,,1059,4.652406417112299

4454999,5,B004QOB8SO,"The BBC's Sherlock is easily the best retelling in film of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short stories.  Better than the recent movies, better than ""Elementary,"" better than all older attempts (although I'm sure the film nostalgic types would probably disagree).  Season  2 is just as good as Season 1, and if wasn't for the hounds of baskerville episode, which is in my opinion the weakest episode of Sherlock from both seasons, it would stand out as more entertaining.

The show is just melodramatic enough to emulate Doyle's writing.  The criminals are a bit too villainous, the crime scenes a bit too gruesome, the characters a bit too hyperbolic, to be taken as ""true-to-life"" storytelling. This is just in line with the rogues gallery of Holmes books, and of course it makes the episodes that much more entertaining.  Cumberbatch does a fantastic job of playing a flawed genius.  Freeman is just right for Watson.",1361491200,,918,4.922077922077922

4455001,5,B004QOB8SO,"I loathe most American detective dramas. There endings are always telegraphed and simplistic. Sex and violence are not merely added incentives, but rather driving forces in the ""CSIs"" and ""Law and Orders."" I enjoy mysteries where the main protagonist is far smarter than I will ever be. I like to be impressed by the intelligence of the writers and the characters. The American retailing of Sherlock Holmes, ""Elementary,"" is a good show. I particularly like the reinvisioning of the Dr. Watson role to a smarter, more integral role. However, it still falls prey to the pitfalls of other American mystery shows.

""Sherlock"" however, is a sheer delight. It is excellently told with wonderfully caste actors. I have developed a bit of a man-crush on Benedict Cumberbatch. I am looking forward to his role as the villain in the new ""Star Trek."" I cannot recommend this series enough. It is intelligent,  exciting, and well acted. More importantly, this show uses the original Holmes stories as templates for its scripts. Because of this show and ""Elementary"" I have decided it is finally time to read some of the ""Sherlock Holmes"" classics I have always ignored. Watch just the first episode and you will be hooked.

Ward of warning though. Each episode is basically a movie about and hour and a half long. Give yourself the time to watch them the whole way through.",1361404800,,1362,4.887445887445887

4455012,5,B004QOB8SO,"Things get diabolically dicey in this second season of Sherlock, the continuation of the techno-reinventing of Arthur Conan Doyle's classic literary detective.
In this season the three episodes have a new direction of subgenres to explore: high-stakes thriller, psych-thriller infused with bits of sci-fi, and psychological mystery. And in each is there some element that makes Sherlock Holmes uncomfortably human. Especially in ""The Hounds of Baskerville,"" where he deals with doubt and fear, and doesn't like it.
With the clues, he's still adept to the most minute jigsaw pieces. With socializing, he's still quite the bumbler that doesn't get a hint very well.
The sad thing is that, in Hounds of Baskerville, the screenwriters apparently decided to hold back on what is considered Sherlock's most famous non-trademark statement, a comment about dogs not barking. And speaking of famous statements, it took me a while to figure out they don't have him say ""Elementary, my dear Watson,"" but just have say ""Obviously."" Just as snarky as the current generation of youngsters, unfortunately.
Now it's the third episode that goes above and beyond the normal standards of today's detective genre. As well as has the best quote in the season, about how Sherlock works for the side of angels, yet is not one. Dark, provocative, if not evocative.
Now, with the end of that episode comes one last mystery that will not be figured out until the third season comes out, can you wait until then?",1361059200,,1485,5.090163934426229
4455013,5,B004QOB8SO,"Sherlock (BBC) is, by far, my absolute favorite show of all time. Waiting for season 3 is kiiling me. The extras on the DVD, plus the amazing quality of blu-ray, makes this an excellent purchase! Worth every penny and then some!",1361059200,,228,4.585365853658536
4455014,5,B004QOB8SO,"The second season of this project continues the unfinished ending of season one, bringing more excitement and danger all the way through, well, where this season ends.  Saying more would be spoiling it.  BBC has announced filming of season three, so we know it will continue and somehow resolve some unexpected plot events.

I assume that if you're reading this review, you have probably seen season one and know that the show treats Sherlock Holmes as a modern figure; , and Watson is a recovering war vet (that's not spoiling anything).  We learned a lot about their character and personality in the first season, and as expected they remain true to their reimagined selves.

The worst thing you could say is that this season is simply more of the same from last season.  Another way of looking at it is that the characters continue to develop but are consistent to who they were in the first season.  And the first season was terrific, so more of the same is, well, also terrific.  And some of the events are really shocking in this season.

Generally I have been very impressed with the work of the BBC Cardiff (Wales), which has included the reimagined Doctor Who and its spinoff, Torchwood.  The latter two have been a bit uneven, mainly varying between great to merely good, but there is a lot of energy and imagination in all three programs we have watched.

BBC has announced that a third season is planned for TV, I think some time in 2013.",1361059200,,1450,4.625

4455016,4,B004QOB8SO,"We really enjoyed Sherlock season 1. The characters and stories are engaging.

4455017,5,B004QOB8SO,"Very few television series' are able to improve in their second season, especially ones that had such a great debut, but the second season of Sherlock tops the extraordinary work in the first one in every category. The rapport between Sherlock and Watson is strengthened, and the two play off of each other quite well. The humor in the second season has been upped considerably, but it doesn't take away from the drama of the show. Furthermore, the nice twist of replacing the first person narrative by Watson in the books with the idea that Watson has a blog on the show was a great addition. The homage to the deer-stalker cap was also a nice touch.

After the big reveal of Moriarty at the end of the first season, the second season of Sherlock adapts the three most popular stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. We get to meet Irene Adler, we get to undercover the hound from Baskervilles, and we get to see the final confrontation between Sherlock and his nemesis Moriarty.

The story will keep you on the edge and the acting is better than ever.  It may only be three episodes, but each one is of movie length and quality.  The writers pay wonderful homage to the original material as well as creating seamless original content.  The last few minutes will leave any fan breathless and begging for season 3.
The package itself is standard.  It contains two discs, one with the first two episodes and one with the finale and bonus features.  The features are an interesting watch, but not a major selling point on the set. Anyone who loved or enjoyed the first season should buy this set.  It meets and often exceeds the standard set in the first season.",1360713600,,875,4.642857142857143

Well, apparently season 3 is on its way this fall.

It's not what I expected from a rendition of Sherlock Holmes. I never was fond of the original story or the new film with Robert Downey Jr. So this was an unexpected surprise.

4455062,5,B004QOB8SO,"Very entertaining and perhaps better than season one. The producers have succeeded in translating this classic character to the 21st century while retaining his essential ""Britishness"" . The only problem I have is that they made so few episodes.",1360454400,,245,5.3076923076923075

4455065,5,B004QOB8SO,"I love this series! The individual stories are great and the ongoing story line throughout each episode is fantastic. The writers, Wow, job well done. The actors, perfect in and for their roles. The season finale, what a cliff hanger and yet so so fine. The only problem (that absolutely must be endured) is how long we have to wait for the next season. I'll just keep watching over and over what we have until then I guess! Ive become a big Sherlock Holmes fan thanks to this series, the movies, and now the TV show called Elementary too. All great in their own way. Can't get enough. Watch one while waiting for the other!

4455067,5,B004QOB8SO,"When Sherlock goes to see Molly at Bart's hospital and asks for a favour, he already has his fake demise planned in that brilliant head of his.  He takes her into his confidence because she is not a ""target"" and she has the means to provide the ""blood and body"" of Sherlock.  Corpses are readily available to Molly and he has her wrapped around his little finger because she secretly loves him.  As for his ""fall"" from the roof of Bart's Hospital, that was also pre-arrainged.  Sherlock repeatedly warns Watson to ""stay right where you are"" because he knows John will have a limited view of him before he hits the ground and the bus that is sitting there is in place to provide a safe object to fall on/into then be quickly hidden away.  I also believe it is in the realm of possibility that Mycroft was involved in the arraingements and provided all the civilians, hospital employees, etc, even the guy that knocks John down thereby delaying him from reaching the scene and dizzying/confusing him.  The assassins are the problem.  Where was the ring leader who directed the others to call off the assassinations?  If he was up on the roof, or a nearby roof, watching Sherlock and saw him jump, then he may not have had a view of street-level where Sherlock would have hit. He assumed that Sherlock died when he jumped. Thus explaining how the shooters were called off.",1360368000,,1369,4.581967213114754

4455078,5,B004QOB8SO,"I don't have anything negative to say about this television series: it's smartly written with an all-star cast. Benedict Cumberbatch has the brusque, no-nonsense attitude that works for a modern day Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman portrays Watson with a mild-manner fashion that is an enjoyment to watch. Both Cumberbatch and Freeman have great chemistry along with Rupert Graves (Lestrade).

I highly recommend this is you're into fast-pace, interactive, and emotional television show with the feel of full-length adventures! In my opinion, the two last episodes of the second season shined brighter than the previous episodes -- and those were fantastic!",1359936000,,659,5.524752475247524

The second episode - that I saw immediately after the 1st one - was disappointing in comparison. Nothing really new, not really credible and - without revealing too much details - the ending is close to loughable.

The 3rd and last episode is better. We see our hero facing what affects him the most... And a surprising ending.

4455106,4,B004QOB8SO,"Sherlock is one of the most witty, intelligent, and ferociously entertaining series to ever flaunt itself on television, and it's near impossible not to fall in love with due to its fantastically developed characters, breakneck pacing, knockout performances, and its undeniable hilarity. Season 2 is almost every bit as good as Season 1. Out of its three hour and a half episodes, Hound of the Baskervilles is the only one I have a few minor complaints about. As entertaining as the episode is from start to finish, it seems a little ""beside the point."" While all 5 of the 6 episodes throughout the series are building up to a bigger picture, Hound of the Baskervilles seems to veer our direction for a while, sort of as a distraction, while adding a minimal amount to the master plot, which is unveiled with the final (sometimes mind blowing) episode. Even with that note in mind, the series as a whole is too unique, and too brilliant to pass up for any reason.",1359158400,,963,4.670588235294118

4455123,4,B004QOB8SO,"As a dedicated Baker Street Irregular, I have usually hated ""adaptations"" and ""modernizations"" of Conan Doyle's marvelous creation.  I tuned into Season One of this latest effort to bring Holmes & Watson into the 21st century and found myself, for once, utterly charmed.  Each of the episodes in both seasons is ""based upon"" one of the original Holmes stories, and for the most part, the adaptations are sly and plausible; purists will find something to quibble about in each one, as I did, but the overall high enjoyability quotient provides sufficient compensation for a few violations.  Credit for the success here is shared between skilled writing and the very game cast, starting with Benedict Cumberbatch, giving us a slightly more youthful and tempestuous, excitable Sherlock than we are accustomed to seeing on film or imagining from Conan Doyle's stories. This Sherlock is not so much cool as, well, as he puts it himself, ""a high-functioning sociopath"". It is Cumberbatch's task to persuade us to take the journey at all, and he pulls it off through a combination of wit, nerve, sincerity, and effrontery.  He is ably supported by Martin Freeman (Bilbo Baggins in ""The Hobbit"") as Dr. Watson, who manages to maintain a distinct humanity while functioning as the central protagonist's foil.  Mycroft, Sherlock's brother, is cheerfully given a wider role and an opportunity to be somewhat less opaque than he is in Conan Doyle's stories - partly because, as you'll see if you watch the special feature program, he is played by Mark Gatiss, one of the original writers-creators of the show.

Season Two gives us episodes based on ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"", and ""The Reichenbach Falls"" - the latter was the story in which the exhausted Conan Doyle tried to kill off his creation so he could stop writing the stories; in the event, public outcry forced Conan Doyle to find a way to resurrect the Great Detective, and publish a new series of adventures.

I see that some viewers were offended by the treatment of Irene Adler, the heroine of ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" (here, ""A Scandal in Belgravia"").  I found it rather delicious and, of course, it offers us the only glimpse we will ever have of Sherlock responding to a woman in any but an analytical way.

In my opinion, the only real failure over both seasons was the very, very disappointing take on the best-known of all Holmes's adventures, ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"".  The Hound has been filmed on its own quite a few times, sometimes to better and sometimes to worse effect, and always properly located at the end of the Victorian era.  However, none of those attempts, and indeed not this attempt, have been able to capture adequately the thrilling twists and turns of the original story.  In the attempt seen here on Season Two of Sherlock, the writers have this time gone way too far afield, thrown in too many gimmicks, diluted the mysterious qualities of the story.  And as most other films of the story have, the writers here missed their opportunity to replicate the revelatory moment when Holmes puts his arm around the Jacobite trimmings worn by the debauched Sir Hugo Baskerville in his portrait at Baskerville Hall, and the face of Stapleton the naturalist springs out of the canvas - giving us the villain of the piece in a brilliant theatrical stroke. I have never seen a screen transfer of The Hound that was as satisfying as reading the story: perhaps it is just one of those works meant only to be seen in the mind's eye.

The last episode of Season Two is very fraught - the baleful consulting criminal, Jim Moriarty, (Andrew Scott in a quirky yet menacing, and oddly youthful portrayal - this talented actor can also be seen in Season One of ""The Hour"" and in a ""Foyle's War"" episode), is mounting ever more vicious attempts to ruin Holmes, and seems to be pulling off some stunning coups in his persecution.  I was not happy with Moriarty's last action, as it seemed too far out of character for the world's greatest consulting criminal, but there, can't have everything . . .

All in all, unless you are so die-hard a purist that imagining Sherlock using an I-Phone makes you break out in hives, this is a worthwhile modernization of Conan Doyle's fascinating consulting detective, and a worthy follow-up to Season One with the exception of ""The Hound"".

As we all know that Holmes returned to life after his adventure on the edges of the Reichenbach Falls, and we are allowed to see him at the close of Season Two hovering out of sight of his mourners, we may hope that Season 3 is not too far behind. However, word has it that due to commitments to other ventures, including Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" by the two stars (in addition to Freeman starring as Bilbo, Cumberbatch is appearing in the second and third installments as the voice of Smaug and as The Necromancer), Season 3 will not debut until, at least, fall 2013 or early 2014.  Quite a while to wait before we get to see the famous opening scene of ""The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"", as Holmes reappears suddenly before Dr. Watson who, for the first and last time in his life, passes out.",1358294400,4,5173,4.748049052396879

4455128,5,B004QOB8SO,"WARNING: SPOILERS.
How do you improve upon perfection?  Darned if I know, but Moffat, Gatiss & company have done it with season 2.  I know there has been a lot of backlash against the way Irene Adler is written in ""A Scandal in Belgravia,"" but I saw her as an incredibly complex woman, one who is more than capable of taking on Sherlock intellectually, and THAT is the basis of the attraction between the two of them.  It's not about her being half-dressed or naked (which she does to throw him off, and succeeds), it's about 2 like minds meeting.

My favorite overall is ""The Hounds of Baskerville.""  A brilliant re-telling of the original.

But my favorite scenes occur at the end of ""The Reichenbach Fall.""  I teach acting, and I show my students these scenes as examples of the power of simplicity in performing.  They are breathtaking and heartbreaking, so be sure and have a tissue handy, lol!",1358121600,,899,4.610062893081761

""Hounds""  is interestingly different too, with another side to our Sherlock emerging. (The tension created by the outside lights going on and off is wicked).  ""Reichenbach Fall"" provides another cliffhanger -which will leave your nickers in a twist waiting for season 3.  Watch for all of the subtle clues that run throughout this series; and which may, if you're a good PI, provide you with some additional entertainment.",1358121600,,564,4.946808510638298

4455135,5,B004QOB8SO,"Both Season One and Two seem to me to be works of love, as much as Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies were.  The writers know their Conan Doyle inside and out, and you  may need to watch the seasons more than once to catch all the references. Superb acting and dialogue, excellent rapport between the leads, and amazingly clever up-dating of Victorian stories. Cumberbatch's rapid-fire delivery when he's on a roll is incredible.",1357948800,,435,4.786666666666667

4455139,5,B004QOB8SO,I'm a TV Show junkie and I watch almost every scripted show.  This is hands down the best one of 2012.  The first and last episodes of the 3 episode season are both classics.  Each episode is more like a movie than a TV episode as they run about 90 minutes.  It's well written and brilliantly acted.,1357862400,,299,4.192982456140351

4455141,5,B004QOB8SO,"Season 2 of this amazing series is just as good (if not better in some places) as the frist.

I would highly reccomend this for any fan of Sherlock Holmes or of mystery tales in general.",1357689600,,322,4.295081967213115
4455142,5,B004QOB8SO,"This is probably one of the best shows on the TV around the world, period.
The Season 2 has three completely different tales - a very confounding espionage, a horror movie, and a true game of personal destruction. It was so great to see the Werewolf from Being Human as a man obsessed with the Hound. My only wish would be that Martin Freeman's Dr. Watson get more prominent part as he did in the series opener.",1357603200,,411,4.35064935064935

It presents, in a new way, the centuries-old question: ""Can you do terrible things to save innocent people?"" It points out our roots in Machiavelli, and even better, digs them up to question them.",1357603200,,287,5.127659574468085

4455148,5,B004QOB8SO,Benedict Cumberbatch is the best Sherlock ever; a brilliant program worthy of any Holmes fan's attention. Set in modern London this BBC masterpiece incorporates current technology against a more servant Holmes and his worthy associate Dr. Watson. I am a fan of most Sherlock Holmes programs and serials - this is by far the finest depiction to date.,1357516800,,349,5.0344827586206895

4455151,4,B004QOB8SO,"This is a successful television series for many good reasons, and it's a bold and worthwhile updating of the 125-year-old, smarty-pants detective story. If there is a true star of the series, I would ask you to consider Martin Freeman as the nothing-left-to-lose, PTSD-afflicted Dr. Watson as being it.
The writing, production, and photography deserve a serious mention, since the time/effort alone of designing and inserting the graphics that depict Holmes' thought proceseses had to be created in a way that it enhances, rather than intrudes on the scene. A deft touch in that detail alone, and the show has plenty of small choices that really work.

The stories are well-adapted to modern realities. The one quibble I had on the updating was with the casting choice for Jim Moriarty, not in the writing for the character. I found the resulting on-screen appearance wholly un-menacing, which is apparently not a majority opinion since he won a BAFTA for his supporting role. But I voice it so that a differing asthetic is heard, and also to illustrate that I found the show to be entertaining despite this impression on my part.

Oh - and the Behind the Scenes interviews contain series spoilers, so watch it last!",1357430400,3,1216,4.926829268292683

4455158,5,B004QOB8SO,"you MUST watch this series. I was bored on Netflix and decided to give this a shot, and since then I've watched Seasons 1 and 2 about four times in 2 weeks. Its so very great. Cumberbatch and Freeman are excellent as Holmes and Watson, and I'm still trying to wrap my brain around Moffat's and Gatiss' ingeniousness. I'm starting to read Sir Doyle's works, and the twists that the creators of this series put on the original stories to make 'Sherlock' are extremely brilliant. I cannot give them higher praise. The dialogue, the banters, the insults, Mr. Holmes' deductions, etc etc will have you completely enraptured. My personal favorite episode is ""Scandal,"" which appears in this season, as Ms. Adler makes me swoon about as hard as Sherlock does. Seeing them interact was fantastic, and well, who doesn't like a woman in control?

I completely recommend Season 2 (as I completely recommended Season 1) for anyone that is a fan of Sherlock and for those that are not. This is a must-see. It is witty, thrilling, action-filled, and dramatic. I will not give anything away of the stories, but it is surely appealing for viewers of all genres.",1356739200,,515,4.548387096774194

But I don't watch much because most of it is utter garbage, and increasingly so.  I'm looking for something I can re-watch, something that makes me think, but doesn't elate me or depress me.  I don't need visuals to get emotional;  I prefer them to suggest ideas to consider.  That you too?  If so, and if you haven't seen it yet, dive into this series.

They have yet, if I remember right, not done much of anything with Holmes' masterly use of disguises, but the cliffhanger at the end of season two may open the door for us to see how masterly Holmes' disguises can be. We'll see.

These shows are wonderfully imagined, with intelligent scripts, superb acting and a lovely twist incorporating your old favorite stories into modern themes and times.  We couldn't be more pleased, one that Sherlock has truly withstood the test of time and just keeps getting more famous with each passing era, bringing new fans into his world and mind, and two, that this show does not play down to it's audience, but brings you with Sherlock and his clues into deducing all, with a quick wit and a sharp tongue.

The writing is superbly twisty and keeps one guessing, hoping that they can figure out the details before the world's only consulting detective. Not likely. Benedict Cumberbatch IS Sherlock in all his intensity, arrogance and honesty, while his right-hand man John Watson, played by the incomparable Martin Freeman, remains the perfect balance of fierce loyalty, intelligence and understanding nature.

The idea of giving the traditional character of Sherlock Holmes access to the width and breadth of the Internet and instantaneous communication has given birth to a loveable/hateable reincarnation of Holmes that no one can resist.

Benedict Cumberbatch (great name!) is fantastic in the role, and fully inhabits the tortured-abrasive-genius aspects of the Holmes character.  Martin Freeman (Hot Fuzz, Love Actually) makes an engaging and dogged Watson.

The stories tend towards the fantastical, but how could they not?  They are over the top, but not ridiculously so, and the effects and action sequences are not the point of the show.  It's character and plot driven, and while each episode has a self-contained case (or cases, as the case or cases may be), there are also ongoing story-lines that cross the boundaries of episodes (and seasons).

The fun and loyal relationship between Sherlock and John, the banter between Sherlock and Mycroft, the utter creepiness of Moriarty. The Hound of the Baskervilles is a well-known Holmes story and to be frank, quite over done, but necessary to do since this series is a twist on Sherlock Holmes. I think the writers handled it very well and brought some new modern ideas that kept it fresh and exciting. Martin Freeman's acting in the last episode made me feel as though I was right there with him.

4455222,4,B004QOB8SO,"Season 2 of ""Sherlock"" takes 3 of the best and most famous cases of Holmes and updates them to the present day. So starting with really great stories by Doyle is a nice advantage.
""Scandal"" is the story of Irene Adler, one of the most durable of Doyle's characters and certainly his most memorable female character. I think they miss the mark making Adler a dominatrix here. That being said, the story is well done.
""Hound"" is also fairly well done although I'm not sure the modern twists add anything to the original story though.
""Fall"" is the best of the bunch and is very fast paced and exciting. We'll have to wait until Season 3 to see how they resolve the climax though.
There's also a ""Behind the Scenes"" feature that is good although not as good as the First season's one. If you liked Season One and Holmes in general, you'll want this one too as it does some of the most important stories.",1353110400,,900,4.427710843373494

It's vastly superior to the recent feature film version of Holmes, despite the talents of Robert Downey, jr. and Jude Law. Here the writing from Steven Moffat, Mark Gatiss, and especially Steve Thompson is superb, with just the right comedy pitch set amidst all the thrills, mental puzzles, and emotional angst.

Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, as Holmes and Watson, respectively, are even more vibrant than in Season One, and when it comes to Holmes and Watson pairings over the past century, I have to say they're the cat's meow. Even Jeremy Brett from the terrific BBC productions of yesteryear would be proud, I think.

As for the episodes themselves, the first and third shows shine the most brightly, particularly Thompson's Reichenbach, which months later still has people abuzz about the ending, trying to figure out just how it was done. Gatiss's second episode (Hound) isn't as strong as the other two, and seems to break away from the Holmes' canon a bit, but it's still highly enjoyable, just as Gatiss's Mycroft is.",1350777600,2,1133,5.0212765957446805

Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman take Sherlock and Watson to modern levels that still fit the brilliance of the detective Sherlock Holmes. As with anything the British create for television, this series will probably not last much longer. I think it would be very difficult to maintain the intensity of this Sherlock Holmes, who needs so much stimulation to keep his mind working. Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson has been updated perfectly in a way that only people of today can understand.

These episodes are basically movies, but they pull you into what's happening, making you end each episode asking for more. I ended up watching the whole second season in one day... You could say I'm addicted. The actors are perfect for their characters, with Irene Adler's single appearance making Sherlock feel as if he had met his match (not Jim Moriarty). Deduction at its finest, Sherlock pulls you in and shows you how the great detective answers the problems he's faced with.

I have been known to hold family and friends hostage for an hour and a half to see this show.  I love Benedict Cumberbatch's version of this character.  He brings Sherlock  to life and and sneaks in a few moments of humor.
You will ENJOY! Richenback Falls is the original death of Sherlock Holmes.  Fortunately, Conan Doyle saw the wisdom in re in reincarnating Holmes.

Having watched the previous season, this episode is a significant leap from last season, and is really the crown jewel of a really excellent series.  With an excellent story, superior acting, and first rate filmography and editing, this plays less like a miniseries than a mini-movie- and let me add I was much more entertained by this episode than a lot of movies I've seen recently.

To put it succinctly, if you are looking for a smart series, like mysteries, and appreciate great TV, you will love this series.  This is what Sherlock Holmes should- needs to be in the 21st century, and it is perhaps one of the more enjoyable 90 mins you'll spend in front of the TV- spend it with Dr. Watson and Sherlock",1348185600,11,945,4.601190476190476

4455364,5,B004QOB8SO,"The second season of the BBC's new Sherlock Holmes is even better than its first season.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are priceless and wildly entertaining as consulting detective Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson in 21st Century London.  This season's stories are extremely well executed riffs on Conan Doyle's familiar stories.  Supporting cast members Mrs. Hudson, Inspector Lestrade, and even poor Molly the lovesick forensics technician get good parts to play.

The first episode is ""A Scandal in Belgravia"", a superb reimagining of ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", in which Sherlock Holmes faces Irena Adler, ""the woman"", who in this version is a dominatrix.  This redo extends the story, and the relationship, in some interesting directions without sacrificing the delicious duel of wits between the two, including an excellent twist at the end.

""The Hounds of Baskerville"" has the temerity to take on the legendary Sherlock Holmes story ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"", and gets away with it, envisioning an updated and truly menacing threat for Holmes and Watson to face on Dartmoor. Even Sherlock will have his relentlessly rational mind rattled just a bit.

""The Reichenbach Fall"" is a redo of the Final Problem"", placing the fatal duel between Holmes and Moriarty in a modern context with modern weapons, and an ending that will keep the viewer guessing to the credits.

Production values for these episodes are excellent, with fascinating mixtures of venues and visual magic, including the portrayal of Holmes' skill at deduction in near real time.  This set includes a featurette on the making of the show.  There has to be a third season; very highly recommended.",1344988800,12,1687,5.214814814814815

4455370,5,B004QOB8SO,"I gave the first season DVD of ""Sherlock"" only four stars, because of the weak third episode, which was actually filmed first. As the documentary on Disk 2 says, this season takes on the three biggest Holmes stories, involving Irene Adler, the hound of the Baskervilles, and Sherlock's supposed end and the death of James Moriarity. The first two episodes are brilliant, better than anything in the first season. The third episode, the Reichenbach Fall, is positively out of this world, over the top magnificent.

As I was watching it, it occurred to me how much easier it is to write about a character with superhuman, or seemingly superhuman characteristics, such as Jason Bourne, Gandalf the Grey, Jedi knights, and every comic book superhero you can name. You can have them do virtually anything you want, in any given situation. If you need lots of different skills, you create teams like the Fantastic Four or the X-Men or the Avengers. Their roles are one extended deux ex machina. The thing which turns these stories into comic books is that you then must create villains with superhuman powers to make it a fair fight. It also helps if you throw in a secret vulnerability or two such as Kryptonite. The original Sherlock Holmes character is so durable because while his powers appear almost magical, they are never outside the realm of acute human observation and ratiocination, although I think that if a person trained themselves in Holmes' methods, their success rate would be nowhere near Holmes's 96% accuracy. This may also be why Gandalf is such a successful character. You can count on one hand how often he uses overt magic between both ""The Hobbit"" and ""LOTR"".

And, in these three episodes, we get a huge helping of the four most freakishly superhuman characters in the Holmes corpus. Aside from Holmes, we get lots of Mycroft Holmes (far more than in the stories), James Moriarty, the ""consulting criminal"" and Irene Adler, whose persona is built up quite a bit from her appearance in only one original story, ""A Scandal in Bohemia"".

Just as I was marvelling over my observation about superhuman characters, in episode 3, the writers turn it all around on Sherlock (something which never happens in the stories) and he is, as Lestrade's female sargeant describes him, freakish. His success is in coming to correct conclusions from thin evidence is thought to be too good to be true, and he is indicted for perpetrating a crime he just solved.

Here I get into dangerous waters, risking giving too much away. I can only suggest that the richness and cleverness with which these stories are displayed on the screen is far more engaging than anything I, or Arthur Conan Doyle, for that matter, could have put on paper.

Possibly the greatest treat is the interaction between Holmes and Moriarty, which virtually never happens in the stories. One of the most marvelous things about Holmes, Mycroft, and Moriarty is that they defy all the usual trademarks ascribed to them by Doyle, they fit into the 21st century perfectly, with no trace of a mannerism saying ""look how clever I am in transplanting these characters"", and yet they are totally true to the soul of the characters created by Doyle. Mycroft and Moriarity are both youngish and thin. Sherlock literally mocks several of the usual trademarks such as his deerstalker cap. Best of all, Moriarty is depicted as quite literally bordering on a kind of brilliant insanity. Moriarty, in the opening scene, done, I believe, to a track of music from Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (it may be ""The Thieving Magpie Overture) is worth the price of admission.

The other two episodes are similarly brilliantly executed, with a few twists you won't find in Doyle's stories. I am almost inclined to suggest you be sure to get Season 1 before getting Season 2, so the second does not spoil the experience of the first, with is first rate, but a bit messy in the end.",1344297600,9,3935,4.830860534124629

4455390,5,B004QOB8SO,"My Review of BBC's Sherlock: Series 2 (No Spoilers, Sweetie)

YES! Every episode was fantastic! The writing and stories were even stronger than the first series. As someone who has read some of the books and is familiar with Sherlock universe, I can say that I have never seen a better translation of the mysteries into full length stories.

The performances:
  Benedict Cumberbatch was brilliant as Sherlock. They take chances with his character and put him in challenging and unfamiliar territory, which is fascinating and compelling. Martin Freeman was fantastic as John Watson. I used to consider him 'Arthur Dent' from that disappointing 'Hitchhikers Guide' movie, but now Freeman is irrevocably John Watson. He balances out Sherlock perfectly. It is Watson's job to show the appropriate situational reactions and help Sherlock in cases, but he also stands up to Sherlock which is just as important sometimes. John was quick to form loyalty to Sherlock, but his faith in his friend is repeatedly tested in this series.
  The actress playing Irene Adler (Lara Pulver) was provocative and smart. She owned the role so thoroughly and convincingly that I feel a little embarrassed for Rachel McAdams, who is entirely forgettable in comparison. Honestly I wouldn't recognize them as the same character. The chemistry between Irene and Sherlock was palpable yet tantalizing, because Sherlock is Sherlock and he has no idea how to deal with people, let alone, 'The Woman'.
  Last but definitely not least was Andrew Scott as Jim Moriarty. I was impressed with the plans and actions of this maniacal foe in the last series, but when you saw him... well, his voice was a bit goofy. However, when you pick up with Jim in the second series you are more familiar with how he operates and what he is capable of and his detached demeanor becomes downright menacing. In spite of this I found myself excited whenever he was on screen. he is suave and surprising (and dressed to kill). His character is one that is always one step ahead and you are never safe even when he lets you have the upper hand. He is a big picture thinker, a true 'Master-Mind', and honey, you should see him in a crown. (For a laugh look up, 'I Can't Decide' by the Scissor Sisters)
Honorable mentions to Mycroft, Molly, Lestrade and Ms Hudson- they were all well loved members of the team but if I discussed everyone this would be much too long!
  I loved every episode and I have rewatched each of them several times. The wait until series three will likely cause my own personal descent into insanity so hopefully the wait until Series 7 of Doctor Who won't take too long.

4455392,5,B004QOB8SO,"I have no right to consider myself a ""Sherlockian,"" but during a recent illness I started to track down Holmes' various incarnations on film and television. This BBC series is without a doubt one of the most entertaining of any of the Holmes series, ever. Benedict Cumberbatch is awesome, as snippy and cranky as Jeremy Brett at his best on the older 1980s/90s BBC series and films, many of which I also recommend.
The Brits use the word ""clever"" very freely, and this word best sums up the BBC's approach to these episodes; all six so far are equally enthralling. The producers have thoroughly thought through how best to ""modernize"" Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrat, Irene Adler, and of course Moriarity; they utilize various contemporary London settings and a great deal of contemporary technology. The stories are the finest updating of these now classic, revered stories you will ever see, and I include the two Robert Downey movies, which suffer from a redefinition of Holmes as a mere action hero. This series doesn't stint on action, but it is above all extremely, well, clever.
These episodes are packed with a dizzying array of visual and verbal ideas. They are dense, beautiful, and, unfortunately, a bit hard to understand with American ears, which makes the familiar mysteries all the more mysterious at times.
If you are a fan of Holmes in any format, don't miss this series. Watch the episodes in the order they were broadcast if you can. We are all breathlessly awaiting Season 3 in whatever format we are ""allowed"" to watch, and it looks like amazon, bless their hearts, will be there first, well ahead of the digital competition.
(As an aside, be careful to download HD if that's what you want to watch--and you SHOULD want that format. Amazon's download interface is pretty good but the distinction between Standard (yuck) and HD is obscure. The HD version is easy to miss, being at the moment only an add-on to a show's title. As a result I twice downloaded the unwanted Standard versions. Amazon did immediately refund my wrongly downloaded titles (which are cheaper), but I can't stand Standard if HD is available. Why oh why would you NOT watch HD if you have a flatsceen TV purchased after, say, 2005?)",1343865600,2,2230,4.825065274151436

I only wish I could have had the option of renting them however as I don't really think I will re-watch the series, at least for a couple of years.
I had sworn off any remakes of Sherlock Holmes following the superb performance by the late Jeremy Britt. This series is a modern day remake of the series however and completely different from the period piece that Mr. Britt portrayed Holmes in. The actor whose name escapes me that plays the current day Dr. Watson also does a tremendous job and teamed with the actor that portrays Holmes makes for a great team effort and a very enjoyable series.

Make no mistake, I am a huge fan of Conan-Doyle, and still enjoy reading one of the original stories, but in the modern version, Sherlock's genius is even more impressive when played against the current technologies.  Technology, in as far as the making of modern movies, is where these 90-minute gems excell.  As Sherlock observes, titles are briefly provided to help the viewer ""see"" what Sherlock sees.

4455530,4,B004QOB8SO,"Sherlock is an excellent series. The show has a compelling antihero, a likeable sidekick, and an intriguing main villain. The secondary characters are interesting as well, in particular Mrs. Hudson, Molly and Mycroft. Sgt Donovan is wonderfully spiteful and is a character you love to hate. Hopefully there will be more of her in future episodes.

Watson seems like a regular guy, but he's much more than that. He's loyal, courageous and a real hero. Sherlock is a man of mystery who has repressed his emotions to enhance his career, though one gets the feeling he's created this persona as a form of self-protection. He has moments of vulnerability that prevent the character from being a one-dimensional know-it-all.

The updated stories are clever twists on the originals. Though it's clearly modern, certain images and moments stir feelings of the past. From Holmes and Watson's auspicious first meeting in A Study in Pink to the gut-wrenching end of  The Reichenbach Fall, this series is almost always satisfying. The only fault rests in the first episode of season two.

A Scandal in Belgravia is the weakest episode of both seasons and was the deciding factor between a 4 and 5 star rating from this reviewer. The Irene Adler character has never been a favorite of mine, but in this series she sinks to a new low. Sherlock unfortunately relies on the common and disappointing theme that a woman cannot be powerful and cunning without relying on her sexuality. If handled differently, this modern Irene Adler could have been a respectable challenge for a man without equal. Instead their interaction degraded the otherwise remarkable character of Sherlock Holmes. By his infatuation with a glorified prostitute, he turns out to be as ordinary as Moriarty labels him in The Great Game. It will take a great deal of redemption in season three for this particular Holmes to recapture the aura he emanated prior to Irene Adler, but I have high hopes for him and look forward to more in this overall fantastic series.",1341014400,3,2018,4.943952802359882

There are 3 of the most famous stores re-imagined: ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"", & ""The Final Problem"".

4455567,5,B004QOB8SO,"I'm a pretty big fan of Sherlock Holmes and the stories that Conan Doyle wrote. I enjoyed the Jeremy Brett series, generally hated Basil Rathbone, and have enjoyed the 2 Robert Downey movies...so when this series came out, I was curious, to say the least.

It's a completely different take. Rather than attempt to redo the stories authentically (as they did with the Jeremy Brett stuff) or re-imagine them in steampunk London at the turn of the last century (as they did with the Guy Ritchie films that star Robert Downey Jr.) they've essentially translated Sherlock Holmes to modern-day London, complete with an expertise in computers, and rumors that Sherlock and his flat-mate, Dr. Watson, are gay lovers. The whole thing is amusing as hell, and there are constant references to the original Conan Doyle stories. In one memorable sequence a very nerdy guy says a bunch of stuff, and then someone else translates for him--and that's ""The Geek Interpreter"", a reference to a short story titled ""The Greek Interpreter"" which the show's producers have apparently decided isn't suitable for adaptation to the modern world.

My only complaint about this show is that it's way too short. Where else but England could a TV network have a ""series"" that has ""seasons"" that last 3 episodes? In America we call that a ""mini-series"". Seriously, they need to get their act together. The producers apparently weren't quite prepared for how well the show did this year on American TV, because they've already decided (because of scheduling conflicts with the stars, etc.) not to do the next season for another year and a half.

4455571,5,B004QOB8SO,"I discovered this gem of a television series after it had been shown on PBS but before they knew for sure a season 2 would exist. Like thousands of fans I waited, re-watching the three episodes in season 1 until everyone around wanted to kill me or break the discs, and hoping the next three would be worth the wait-hoping I would not be disappointed.

I wasn't.

These are three excellent episodes that stand among the best Sherlock Holmes tv/film adaptations I've seen (and I've seen quite a few). This is not, however, something to buy and buy the first later. This season picks up right at the end of the last season 1 episode and moves full steam ahead. First season was introduction, this is the three best stories in the Holmes canon, all with excellent writing, beautiful acting, and a wonderful modern twist.

A Scandal in Belgravia: A modern retelling of A Scandal in Bohemia, we are once again introduced to Irene Adler-The Woman. She is not an actor however, nor is she a thief-as she is in the Guy Ritchie version. No, now we have a dominatrix who tries to bring everyone around her, Sherlock, Mycroft, etc. to their knees. The script, written by Steven Moffat, is full of the wonderful dialogue between Sherlock and John, as well as hilarious and character developing moments. One of my personal favorite parts is the furthering of the relationship between Sherlock and his landlady. Mrs. Hudson is awesome! The best scene, talked about in other reviews, takes place in Buckingham Palace with John pulled from a crime scene and Sherlock wrapped up only in a sheet. They might not act grown up: as John says, ""We solve crimes together, I blog about it, and he forgets to wear his pants-I wouldn't hold out too much hope."" But it held out a lot of hope for a great series.

The Hounds of Baskerville: Another marvelous modern retelling, this time from Mark Gattis. Many attempts have been unable to catch the mood of the story, which is less of a mystery and more a Gothic horror. This, he did perfectly, transforming a Gothic horror into a near modern equivalent: conspiracy theories. Baskerville is a British military secret lab with all sorts of potential for wild and terrible experiments. Sherlock and John travel together, soon joined by Lestrade-once again played excellently by Rupert Graves. Here, Sherlock faces fear, true terror, for the first time with less the happy results. Wonderful evolutions of the series' groundbreaking use of text on the screen is used perfectly here to allow us access into Sherlock's 'mind palace'. A wonderful retelling that is much better than the previous seasons second episode.

The Reichenbach Fall: The one we all waited for. And it did not disappoint. Both of the previous episodes had contained little teasers of Moriarty, as if he peeked from behind curtains just off-stage. Now, however, Andrew Scott is given free reign to bring his take on the consulting criminal to life, bigger, badder, and more insane than ever. We watch as he slowly unravels his plan, as everything slowly falls apart in front of us. The conclusion of the series left me weeping, as it did many others. A third season has been promised so all we can do is wait...again, though we now have six episodes instead of three to keep us company.

This is one of the best series on television in any country with excellent acting by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman-the best Holmes and Watson duo I've seen since Jeremy Brett and his two co-stars and Rathbone and Bruce. The writing, the cinematography that would be excellent in big budget films, and the wonderful blending of modern day with all that is essentially Holmes makes this a must have for fans of the great detective, British Mystery series, or simply great television.",1340236800,3,3768,4.78923076923077

4455573,5,B004QOB8SO,"How many times have we all mused about the fact that there is nothing good on television?

I remember a time when about 80% of humanity had so disavowed the ""tele"" and the productions that were being shown on it, that all anyone could do was to boast about how they would mysteriously ""only watch the Discovery Channel.""

I don't know what that 80% is saying about TV nowadays, but as for me, I have been pleasantly surprised by the outcropping of shows that have raised the bar of the medium so far as to equal and often surpass the holy grail of visual art, the feature film.  Fx, one of my favorite filmed adventures of all time is ""Lonesome Dove"", a TV mini series that rivals or surpasses anything ever put on film, in my humble opinion.

Comes now, a retelling of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, revisited and refashioned by a group of visual artists who's love of both Conan Doyle's character and, of the of the visual arts, have come together to show us that film has, indeed, become the literature of the age.

I will confess that I have seen just five of the six episodes (the fifth anxiously awaited), but could not help but come to this page to say to anyone who has an ear to hear it, this is one of the best programmes I have ever seen, in any medium, at any venue, at any time in my short life.  I have worked in film, dabbled in writing, watched, admired, and abhorred all manner of attempts to bring story to screen; and, after seeing ""Sherlock"", all I can say is, ""Bravo!"", and my hat goes off to the people who brought this production to life.

So ... what can I offer by way of details, that could justify such effusive praise?

Where to begin?

To start with, I will quickly mention the components that are required of a review, out of respect for tradition and for the people involved.

Our own Mr. Sherlock Holmes has been recreated by Mr. Benedict Timothy Carlton Cumberbatch; a rather pompous and decidedly English name, although I think the four names are more due to marriages and screen name choices, rather than any attempt to claim aegis of the English aristocracy.  The show opens with John Watson, without naming him; and, at first it is hard to tell who this man is supposed to be playing.  But the moment we see Sherlock Holmes, gazing down the lens of a microscope, we are engaged.  Cumberbatch (could YOU pick a better surname for the actor to play Holmes?) is nearly perfect, or better than, because you haven't seen it all until you've seen it all.  I don't know anything about this production specifically, but I can just imagine a frustrated producer asking the director, ""Well, what is it that you are looking for, exactly?""

To which the director invariably replies, ""I don't know, but I'll know it when I see it,"" to which the producer can only roll his eyes.  In Cumberbatch, ""it"" has been found.

And a word about John Watson, played by Martin Freeman: this is no bumbling ol' man; but a thoughtful, courageous, war-ravaged veteran, who craves the intensity of wartime, and needs Sherlock as much as Sherlock needs a friend, who is just bright enough to appreciate his genius.  It is a friendship of loyalty, and mutual need, only hinted at in the writings of Conan Doyle.

The story is modernized to play to today's audience; Sherlock doesn't wear an 19th century hunting cap, nor does he smoke a pipe.  He muses, ""It's impossible to maintain a smoking habit in London these days ..."" so slapping on a few nicotine patches helps him think through some difficult puzzles.

He is no stranger to technology, either.  His cell phone is his best friend and he uses it to its full potential to solve crimes and gather information.  And when it comes time for Doyle's classic line, ""The game is afoot!"", someone rightly updated the remark to read, ""The game is on!""

Even Lestrade has been updated to a more rounded character.  No longer the bumbling idiot, fumbling after Sherlock Holmes and railing irrationally at him even as he solves case after case, OUR NEW Lestrade is an earnest man of average intelligence, who knows full well the value of his ""consulting detective.""  And by way of humanizing Mr. Holmes, whom one suspects may be a ""high-functioning sociopath,"" it may just come to pass that Sherlock has a care for him as well.

I don't think there is any need to give it all away with my blathering.  Watch it.  Love it, like I did, and never again claim that your TV addiction is exposing you to mindless drivel; there's a new sheriff in town; and his name, is Sherlock Holmes! :)

Enjoy!",1340150400,9,4543,4.5318627450980395

Yes, it is Sherlock Holmes but the producers must have been scouring Great Britain to get the raw and visceral feel that these two actors were going to wield.  They have risen to the ocassion and Cumberbatch and Freeman have outdone themselves and again prove that England produces some of the greatest actors in the world.  The link between these two is simply perfect and they do not disappoint in this series.  As a monster fan of Sherlock Holmes I have been watching this series and I am terribly impressed with the way Cumberbatch and Freeman interact.  They work very well together in this series as Freeman plays a much tougher version of Dr. Watson. I know many people who can't wait to see the next episodes to continue with the 21st Century rendition of the most celebrated detective the world has ever known.

4455588,5,B004QOB8SO,"no one else has dared do this before so i give the creators kudos for daring and innovation.  that is, to transport the series into present day and make sherlock present day obnoxious.  he has an impossible personality in his own era but it has been updated to fit in the present.  the lead actor captures this perfectly and it is impossible to picture him in a relationship of any sort other than what he has with watson.  this is, of course, precisely the way conan doyle created him on the page. i've read that the actor playing sherlock has become so popular that he is now besieged with other roles.

in this second series the creators increase their daring by taking on three of the most challenging Holmesian sagas.  There is the meeting of Irene Adler in SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA, Moriarty in RIECHENBAKER FALLS and my personal favorite, being a dog lover, HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES. These are also newly adapted to fit the modern era and some viewersdo not like the radical changes.  However,  why even bother doing this series if you aren't going to take these risks?  after all, is anyone going to equal Jeremy brett's rendition of the original doyle masterpieces set in their rightful era? no, i don't think so.

you will enjoy this is you are willing to alter your perceptions of sherlock holmes and imagine him as a present day detective.  if you find the very idea appalling, this is not for you.

4455590,5,B004QOB8SO,"Reinventing popular culture heroes is always a tricky business-you run the risk of ruining everything that made the original special. Stephen Moffat who currently writes/produces ""Doctor Who"" for the BBC  does a marvelous job of taking the essence of Arthur Conan Doyle's crime solving maverick and reimsgines him as a brilliant, high level functioning sociopath (as Holmes described himself in the very first episode of the fist season). Moffat has updated these stories remarkably well and made them less than predictable even if you've read the original stories.

The show wouldnt be half as impressive without the brilliant casting of Benedict Cumberbatch, Matin Freeman, Lara Pulver, and Andrew Scott

The stories tackled during the second season of the series includes ""A Scandal in Belgravia"", The Hound of the Baskervilles"" (retitled ""The Hound of Baskerville"" here) and ""The Reichenbach Falls"". All three are presented in their original feature length presentations on the BBC.

All three stories are reinvented with modern trappings taking the basic plot and stories from Doyle's stories but liberally introducing new elements to update them for the 21st century. That means that some of them are a bit surprising in terms of the twists and turns although you might know the outcome at the end, it will help to revitalize the stories and make them entertaining yet again. The weakest of the three presented here is ""The Hound of Baskerville"" which does, indeed, receive many updated elements that make it still fun and entertaining but, as it is the most adapted of the Doyle stories, it is also the best known. That said, the script by Mark Gatiss is marvelously inventive with some truly stunning set pieces. Gatiss who plays Mycroft Holmes does double duty in many episodes and as an actor he is truly outstanding as well and might easily be overlooked given the other performers in the show. His work isn't quite as showy but it's every bit the equal of his co-stars.

The Blu-ray presentation is quite nice with rich colors, often stunning detail althought the contrast Is a bit on the weak side but overall this looks pretty impressive.

Audio is crystal clear although you have to pump up the volume a bit if you choose to listen it in stereo. We also get English subtitles.

We get commentary tracks for ""Belgravia"" and ""Baskervilles"" from the writers/producers Moffat, co-creator Mark Gatiss, cast members on each one Cumberbatch and Purvis joining them on the former and Purvis along with guest star Russell Tovey.

We also get a 20 minute featurettes ""Sherlock Uncovered"" about the production of the second season.

""Sherlock"" improves on an already terrific first season as Moffat and Gatiss radically recreate Holmes for the 21st century.

4455595,5,B004QOB8SO,"what can i say? it's the single most outlandish, questionable notion ever to ultimately pay off!!
we Sherlockians tend hear much about what's supposedly essential. we're told, for instance, that it's utterly vital that it take place on the proverbial ""foggy night in Old London Town""...even though the only major fog Conan Doyle wrote, in THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, was way out in the country! we're told how he absolutely must wear that Inverness-and-deerstalker ensemble...even though Doyle had nothing to do with that; it was illustrator Sidney Paget's contribution. (and the focus of a priceless inside-joke, by the way.) we're told how absolutely imperative it is for something somewhere to be ""elementary my dear Watson""...despite the fact that that little catchphrase, on top of being rather onerous, technically sprang from Hollywood. well, looks like the Victorian England setting wasn't exactly mandatory, either.
i don't expect SHERLOCK to put any of that persnicketty snobbishness to rest, but it should more than convince the open mind of the dangers of such snobbery. the truly preposterous notion of updating the Great Consulting Detective works because creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss knew which elements were indeed indispensible. (by the way, i'm sure i'll be accused of being biased toward the series by those who recognize Moffat as the current leader of my all-time favorite tv series, DOCTOR WHO. well, maybe, but i was just as much biased by the fact that Sherlock is my all-time favorite literary character.)
ironically, Benedict Cumberbatch is not only a thoroughly faithfull portrayal of Our Hero, he may be the single most faithfull in years. one of Moffat's goals way to sidestep the cliche' of Sherlock and Dr. Watson being in their 40s or 50s and depict them as Doyle wrote them, young men when they met. this makes room for completely Canonical ideas and nuances that would be cancelled out if they were played by the usual middle-aged actors. we get to see the charactes develop, rather than act on the assumption that they were born into the characters we recognize and remember. THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE, for instance, features a poignant subplot in which Sherlock deals with his very first bout of doubt, confronts (ostensibly for the first time) the possibility that he is fallible. yu won't get that sort of thing from Rathbone and Bruce or Downey and Law. or even Brett and Burke/Hardwicke, really.
the three stories as well are a bit outlandish...and quite compelling largely for that very reason. i'm not sure if it takes more imagination or gumption to turn Irene Adler into a dominatrix, or convert THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES from a haunted house story to a tale of an army base shrouded not in fog but conspiracy theroies. as for No. 3, which i was particulrly looking forward to because it's based on one of my very favorite adventures, ""The Final Problem,"" it's embellishments actually managed to add a degree of dimension (not least of which via Moriarty's convoluted schem to discredit Our Hero). i must admit that i wasn't sure about actor Andrew Scott and his exaggerated ""homo"" take on the Napoleon Of Crime...but i have to admit that he ultimately creeps me out and then some.
(as it happens, the DVD of SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS finally turned up just before i wrote this. check out Jared Harris' more conventional Moriarty as well as Scott's hammed-up version, and tell me if you'd like to meet either down the proverbial dark alley on the proverbial dark night.)
one of my favorite lines from a Sherlock movie is, ironically, from the parody WITHOUT A CLUE. the plot concerns a Watson who is himself a crime-solving wizard, but who, for fear of how it might reflect on his professional standing, created a fictional cipher to take the credit. the ploy backfired, and public interest in this Sherlock Holmes ultimately led him to hire a drunken, out-of-work actor to portray his creation. early in the film, after a spat and subsequent separation, ""Holmes"" chides Watson: ""you might've created me, but now Sherlock Holmes belongs to the world."" that could well be the single most succinct description for art in general that i've ever heard. (well, successful art, anyway.)
SHERLOCK neatly exeplifies what the world can do with the art it owns, provided it's handled by owners who understand it, appreciate it, LOVE it. and so does WITHOUT A CLUE, for that matter.",1339545600,4,4441,4.970430107526882

4455627,5,B004QOB8SO,"The HUGE disappointment with SHERLOCK Season 2 is that there are ONLY 3 90-minute episodes. Fans are left wanting more and knowing they have to wait for more episodes.

Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely amazing as the modern Sherlock Holmes with a twist. This Sherlock is ego-centric and rude yet he possesses amazing detective skills. No one can solve a crime like Sherlock and soon his fame could be his downfall. It looks like the writers, director and stars have taken the international success and tweaked the story of this family literary hero even further. Season 2 is more intense and more dark in its stories. Sherlock is more wrapped in his mind that ever which leads him to be more unstable and unpredictable. Season 2's Sherlock is darker and more self-absorbed than before. His rudeness and impatience with people is stronger. No one can match his superior intellect so they just waste his time.

It's amazing how off-putting yet likeable Sherlock is. He offends everyone yet he solves the mystery every time. His exact extent of relationship with John Watson is questioned even deeper. Is there more than just a deep respect for Sherlock that keeps Watson at his side. It's interesting how the writers play with the story and how the success of last season has made them more self-confident and more daring in the risks they take in their storyline. It's a remarkably compelling and unique show.

It can get tedious following Sherlock's train of thought as he quickly sizes up a person or situation. One look at a person and he can tell their life story. A bit over the top and obsessive, maybe, but fun.

Season 2 ends with a shocking cliffhanger but we soon get our answer which leads to an even bigger question..What just happened? The writers are spot on with the ending. We HAVE to see Season 3 to see how the impossible was possible.

SHERLOCK probably isn't for everyone but it certainly is fresh and exciting. A popular classic hero is remodeled and revisited in the modern era. The writers have done an amazing job and Benedict Cumberbatch has a definitely exciting career ahead of him.",1339027200,5,2110,4.785714285714286
4455628,5,B004QOB8SO,"I love this show & I have seen each episode at least 7 times. I just want to address some issues that I see raised in the 1-star reviews. I would hate for people to pass on watching the 2nd series because of some unwarranted negative posts (to each his own, I guess). The 2nd season has the same Sherlock writers & they are very exacting about details. This 2nd series is well written & does not stray from Conan-Doyle's vision. There is no disparity between seasons. Many of us would say that the last episode of the 2nd season is the best of all.  There is an amazing twist and powerful cliffhanger. I see a complaint that newer methods of testing evidence are not used - and then there is a complaint that computers are used too much (?).  Sherlock is often in the lab at a morgue/hospital where he tests all types of evidence, i.e. poison, chemical traces, etc. There is no evidence that needs to be tested with fingerprints, DNA, ballistics, etc.  Watch the episodes. Most times those kinds of clues aren't at a true crime scene.
  If you like the 1st series then you will no doubt enjoy the 2nd one. I can't say enough wonderful stuff about all 6 episodes. I only regret that we have to wait until late 2013 or early 2014 before the new shows will probably air (in the U.S.).

4455650,1,B004QOB8SO,"I am completely in agreement with the previous reviewers in relation to being charged for this ""special"". In the past, any ancillary ""documentary"" and ""preview"" material has been free of charge to entice viewership, and is generally released BEFORE the actual season.

This product was released after the show was done airing, and, therefore, after consumers would logically think to ""stop payment"" on their season passes. This is a total insult to consumers committing to Amazon's ""season pass"" promotion, as now any discount earned from being a season pass holder is completely mitigated by being automatically charged $1.89 for this NON-EPISODE. Sherlock is a unique show in terms of pricing model due to episode length (each one essentially being its own movie), but a usual (non-HD) show on Amazon costs about $1.89! That is for a 40+ minute full-length episode, and here we are being charged that same price for an almost 9 minute behind the scenes documentary of questionable insight and worth, especially in light of the fact it is a ""preview"" of the 2nd season which we have already, presumably, watched since we have already bought it!

I find this unacceptable and will reevaluate my ""season pass"" buying habits in the future if this is a new ""feature"" on Amazon. Even now, one can save considerable money (sometimes as much as HALF in comparison to even ""discounted"" season passes of shows in real-time) buying seasons of tv a mere month after their season finales. If anything, committing to a season pass should entitle consumers to ancillary material such as this for free if Amazon wants to continue this (rather dubious) pricing model, not punish us for committing to a show and, unlike individual episode buyers, not being given the OPTION of buying this fluff!",1338249600,3,1779,5.006756756756757

I think this version has been the best Sherlock Holmes series to date and nothing else can replace this version by BBC. The reason this series is one of the best because everything about it is pure Sherlock Holmes, the cast, set, crimes, and protagonists. You can always have a crime shows like Law & Order, CSI or something like that which can be really good, but you can only have one Sherlock Holmes. You cannot compare Sherlock to other criminal stories because Sherlock is the grandfather to all of them.

I found only one drawback to this version - it is that the series tend to be short. It is extremely difficult to wait two years for the next three shows to come on. They need to mass produce this series because I think its getting very popular right now. Also, do anyone knows exactly how Sherlock faked his death?

If you are in the US watching the second season via Masterpiece on PBS, you aren't seeing the entire episodes! They cut 8 minutes out of each show to make room for commericals and to thank funding partners. Its just another reason to watch the second season all over again!

And enough about how good it looks on a HDTV screen, did I mention that this version of the modern day sherlock Holmes would probably make Conan Doyle proud? Dont waste your time on that new ABC series of Sherlock Holmes in the fall, the BBC version does it right.",1338076800,2,950,4.21978021978022
4455682,4,B004QOB8SO,"The first season of BBC TV's 'Sherlock' was easily my favorite show of 2010. The updating of the traditional characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was surprisingly effective in a modern-day setting and created some of the most fun and suspenseful episodes of TV I've ever seen.  This second season of 'Sherlock' has a lot of great moments (and one outstanding final episode) but is also a bit uneven and lacks some of the freshness of the starting season.

The first episode of 'Sherlock: Season Two' picks up where the season one cliffhanger left off, with Holmes and Watson in a life-threatening stalemate with arch-villain Moriarty. After ""escaping"" Holmes and Watson are put onto a case involving blackmailing dominatrix Irene Adler (the con-artist from the Arthur Conan Doyle stories) in the fun but wildly inconsistant ""A Scandal in Belgravia"". The second episode, ""The Hounds of Baskerville"" is a more straight-forward mystery as the two detectives take on a modern variation of the famous novel ('Hound of Baskervilles' along with hints of the story 'Devil's Foot'). Then things finally come to a head with a showdown between Holmes and Moriarty in ""The Reichenbach Fall"".

Like the first season of 'Sherlock', each episode has it's merits but not all are equal in quality. I liked Irene Adler at first thanks to Lara Pulver's performance and some clever writing: her being unclothed when meeting Holmes so he couldn't ""read"" or ""deduce"" anything about her was a nice touch and showed just how much smarter than Holmes she could be. Unfortunately the tone of the episode kept changing on the fly (with waaaaaay too many red-herrings) as did Irene's personality and it was hard to get a grasp on how we're supposed to feel about her character. 'Hounds of Baskerville' was much more consistant with some touching character development from Holmes, Watson and guest character Henry Knight (a terrific Russell Tovey) but also felt unconnected from the overall plot and didn't seem to really go anywhere. Much like the first season of 'Sherlock', it's the final episode that makes this season worthwhile and it's exciting seeing a vulnerable Holmes in a fight for his life against the schemes of Moriarty.

As with the first season, 'Sherlock: Season Two' has engaging performances from it's actors. Benedict Cumberbatch is making the character of Holmes his own and is excellent when showing Holmes' more vulnerable side. Series creator Mark Gatiss is given more to do this season as Holmes' brother Mycroft as is Rupert Graves as Lestrade. Andrew Scott creates a creepy and dangerous villain in Moriarty and you feel the tension ratchet up whenever he's on-screen. As usual the best performance in 'Sherlock' comes from Martin Freeman: he was born to play John Watson and the conviction of his performance (and his humanity) keeps you anchored to every episode even as the stories spin out of control.

This second series of 'Sherlock' may be a bit rocky and lacking in the freshness of season one, but it's engaging character development, clever mysteries and outstanding season finale make this a DVD set worth buying.",1337990400,7,3132,5.038610038610039
4455683,5,B004QOB8SO,"The BBC update of the Conan Doyle stories has been cheeky and refreshing. The unsettling aspects of Sherlock's character that Doyle could only hint at are here brought to the fore as a combination autistic savant and schizoid type. It is brilliant and it works. Watson is a far smarter foil than he has ever before been allowed to be and the adaptations of the stories are for the most part inspired.

Irene Adler is working for Moriarty, as in the stories, but here she is much more her own woman and is also a dominatrix. Is she the only woman that can turn Sherlock's head or has he turned hers? It speaks to the quality of the acting that the viewer is never quite sure.

4455694,5,B004QOB8SO,"BluntReview says: Brains are indeed the new sexy...and Sherlock Series Two delivers multiple, err, pleasures...In fact it's a trifecta for the brain endorphin-wise. You get a heaping helping of raw sexy, mystery and intrigue complete with scary bits, and the finale serves up a gut-wrenching thrill. And Sherlock Series Two's three new films dare to step forward into the Doyle Classics; Scandal in Bohemia, Hound of the Baskervilles and The Final Problem.

Oh, yes, they went there, and the reworks work. Hell, they've even neatly managed to work in the infamous deerstalker! It's hard to top the phenom the whole production crew brought us in the first myth-shifting series. I mean they had to approach concisely the bromance, the modernization and of course nod to all us Holmesians - with our self-righteous eyes looking for any flaw; complete with the ""Why I oughttas"" awaiting. But, worldwide we were quietly awed then thunderously applauding.

We are brought back in with, 'A Scandal in Belgravia.' Of course the title is obvious. And the ""plot"" is about royalty and scandalous pictures. Normally a yawn, ah, but not here there Johnny. Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Watson (Martin Freeman) run around in gloriuos subplot land as the real focus is on one woman - The Woman - Irene Adler (Lara Pulver). All the series of films thus far has attempted to knock you upside the head with how not gay Watson is, but, have left Sherlock up to one's imagination. Is this man an Elder Virgin or perhaps...

But as we shall all discover all the lad needed was an equally brilliant brain-force and some good old-fashioned gorgeous-to-boot looks thrown in and he too can be befuddled by the opposite sex. Purr. Snap. (<- if you know what I'm typing here...and I think that you do)

The acting in these sexually-fueled frames is particularly brilliant from the trio; S, J and I. Watch the eyes and tells.

Next up is The Hounds of Baskerville. Now how on Earth are they going to manage this work you may harrumph aloud as the film starts. Fear not, they have and quite (as we are coming to expect) brilliantly. Clever is too mundane a word. Brilliant too used. Let's just go ahead and say it. But, here, the word is neither over used or quaint. The film is genius.

Oh there's something going on out there on the moors alright Joe, and you'll have eyes fixed upon the television wondering just what this hound thing is anyway!

There are some clues: Baskerville is now a military testing area, and strange people do strange things, the townsfolk don't mind having a dog beast for fiscal intake purposes, and one young man has a long history with the hound....which would have to be either on a third generation, or twenty odd years old and still running about tearing poor moor wanderers apart like an old chewie toy. And, thankfully, there's plenty of foggy atmospheric additions to help your psyche go along for the hunt.

Finally they've attempted, and succeeded, in The Reichenbach Fall
re-imagining. This film is so completely thrilling, I forewarn you not to eat prior to viewing or your tummy is sure to burp and bother at you in protest through out.

Moriaty (Andrew Scott) is back and he's even more twisted and riddled up in a conundrum then when we first met him temper-tantruming about at the pool. Moriaty is the Yin to Sherlock's Yang. He almost steals the show - both actor and character. Seething evil and diction the actor is given some of the smarter bits ever caught by a lens. This Scott fellow can act. Yes he can. Have they actually put belladonna drops in his eyes? Or does he actually look like that? Hmm.

The premise, or plot, starts to shape up to be about how once an idea is planted in one's mind there's no uprooting. Kind of like you can not un-hear something. That's really all I can say without slipping the game up.

Be aware R Falls' end is sure to leave you utterly breathless and perhaps stunned with a tear or two rolling down your face....I'm just saying. I can say no more.

Except to say, the characters you've immediately come to know and enjoy are all back and in the crispest of form from Series One; Mycroft (Mark Gatiss), Mrs. Hudson (Una Stubbs), suffering Molly (Loo Brealey) and Lestrade (Rupert Graves).

DVD kit bonuses include a short on behind the scenes where cast and crew share the warmth of reception and show you how they shot a few really swell scenes and audio commentary.

Once again I bow to all in and around the production for a tremendously entertaining few evenings.

Snack recommendations: Pack of cigarettes for Scandal - or a few nicotine patches...frankly, what ever you enjoy post coitus;)

4455695,5,B004QOB8SO,"If you enjoyed the sheer creative quirkiness of Season 1 of SHERLOCK, the originality continues. There is no formula for these shows. The surprise continues to surprise. In Season 2, three classic Sherlock stories are updated and tweaked to fit modern times.

1. A Scandal in Belgravia, 2. The Hounds of Baskerville and 3. The Reichenbach Fall are the three stories brought to life and color. In A Scandal in Belgravia, the dominatrix Irene Adler is introduced. Is she the perfect woman for Sherlock? Will her feminine wiles beguile him and make him lose his senses and mind? Loved the ending in this one. There is an adult theme, with the cracking of Adler's whip, so remove small children and animals from the room.

In The Hounds of the Baskerville, Sherlock's most famous mystery, the plot is really toyed with. This one is the most terrifying of the three stories. It has a sci-fi cast to the plot, if you like that sort of thing. Finally, The Reichenbach Fall, Sherlock meets Moriarty head on in mind-to-mind combat. Who will triumph? The ending will have you brainstorming different hypotheses for what really happened, how did they do that, and what will happen next, making you wistful regarding having to wait a year to find out. I wonder if we'll see Moriarty in Season III...

Really, the writers/producers need to produce more shows each season. Three are not enough. How about five or seven shows, as in DOWNTON ABBEY? You can still have a little quantity without sacrificing quality.

This second series makes you like this enactment of Dr. Watson even more and Sherlock seems to be softening, becoming more vulnerable emotionally and humane, before your very eyes. Or is it an act? Season Three will tell. We can't wait!",1337904000,3,1736,4.815436241610739

Watson was more integral to the story of Sherlock than he's ever been given credit for, (at least in any of the renditions of the Sherlock Holmes movies or shows I've seen)by being Sherlock's doctor not just some randomly thrown in side kick that is used to express Sherlock's mental superiority.

4455699,4,B004QOB8SO,"Writing an update for the classic Hound of the Baskervilles is daunting and I wouldn't have wanted to be the writer who had to take on that task. The original hound involved vengeance for a rape on the moors some years back. This new hound involves government experimentation in genetics and mind-altering substances, hotel owners, Moriarty and everything but the kitchen sink. Set in the far north of England, as was the original, Watson and Holmes have to travel at the request of a young man haunted and traumatized by the death of his father at the jaws of the harrowing hound. Others have seen this hound on the moors as well, though no one has yet caught it.

I love the new Sherlock series as my reviews indicate, but I was disappointed in this update. The plot was convoluted and a bit overwrought and except for the name bore no resemblence to the original. Other Sherlock scripts have kept key elements of the original stories while updating them to the twenty-first century. I would have liked to have seen the update where the hound was vengeance for a rape and believe that this could have been done rather than the secret government installation that we got. I did like the update of Lord Baskerville, who isn't a lord in this iteration but found the overall plot a bit overdone. That said, watching this new version of Sherlock is still worth it and a weaker episode here is better than most other mystery and procedural shows. Recommended with a small caveat.

Now that all episodes of Season 2 have aired I can recommend both seasons of Sherlock without reservation. Five of the six adaptations are thrilling and the one that falls short is so far above other offerings that it can be overlooked.

Instead we get that deliciously nasty little ponce, Moriarty, causing trouble and wreaking the ultimate havoc in the lives of Holmes and Watson. Moriarty isn't out to steal anything, though Mycroft claims that he already has computer code that will grant him access to anything in the world, Moriarty is out to ruin and kill Holmes, the only entertainment left to him.

He does this by discrediting Holmes and the fall is far and dark indeed as it always is when it begins at the pinnacle. Holmes is shown as a narcissistic neurotic who faked all of his cases, at times even commiting the crimes for public adulation. How will Holmes escape the trap and will it be as ingenious as the original? Will Watson forgive him the ruse or will he be so glad to see him that he won't care? Watson's poignancy at Holmes's grave is very moving.

We won't know until next season. The writing in the episode is fluent and fast-paced and the acting is as always superb. I have enjoyed this update of Holmes and will definitely tune in for the Season 3 when PBS airs them.

4455705,4,B004QOB8SO,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

When Season One of Sherlock ended we found Sherlock  (Benedict Cumbebatch) and Dr. John Watson (Martin Freeman) at a seemingly impossible impasse.
John is hostage, wearing an explosive vest. Our villain Moriarty is grabbed by John, as if he'd take on his bluff. Then a sniper zeroes in on Sherlock and John backs off. Both are in the sights of numerous snipers and the season ends.
Season two goes back to that moment but ever so briefly before we're sent into three prominent titles Holmes buffs are sure to recognize -- A Scandal in Bohemia, The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Final Problem.
""There's the question of how to go out on a cliffhanger and then the thematic things of the three stories, where we were trying to get to and what Sherlock and John's relationship is a little further on,"" Mark Gatiss (who plays Sherlock's weird brother Mycroft Holmes) said. ""You can't just go back to: 'You have no emotions.' 'I don't care.' You've got to move on somewhere and make sure the other characters have something of a journey too.""
Sherlock, still a loner, and frustrated with his fellow man in general is evolving. In this second series he acknowledges John as a friend, shows some interest in the opposite sex and even says ""I'm sorry.""
I really like Sherlock and how BBC has taken these old cases and reinvented them for the times we live in. My only complaint would be the rather annoying subtitles which show what Sherlock is thinking instead of letting him sigh and explain, in his own way, what everyone should already know.
It has been rumored that Cumberbatch will play a lead role in the upcoming J. J. Abrams-directed Star Trek sequel.",1337731200,,1712,4.703333333333333

Season 2 is even better. Season 1 was evidently conceived as 60-minute episodes that were expanded to 90 minutes with a lot of useless filler. The characters and situations were great, but the stories were sloppy, to the point of cringe-inducing at times. Writers Stephen Moffat and Mark Gatiss knew what format they were writing for this time, so they gives us enough meat to fill 90 minutes. I didn't feel that these episodes dragged or went off course at any time. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", ""The Final Problem"", and novel ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" have been updated to ""A Scandal in Belgravia"", ""The Hounds of Baskerville"", and ""The Reichenbach Fall.""

""The Hounds of Baskerville"" is the weakest of this trio, but Mark Gatiss has, to his credit, updated a story about a giant, glowing dog so it makes sense to a 21st century audience. And modern concerns about secret military experiments are a nice touch. ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" updates a fan favorite and does not disappoint. Scenes are often framed through windows or doors. ""The Richenbach Fall"" is the cliffhanger that left Holmes fans anxious in 1893. It looks like modern fans may also have a long wait to find out if there will be more. But fame in the modern world is very different than Victorian England. Watson's blog has made Holmes an ""internet phenomenon"". ""The press will turn, Sherlock. They always turn. And they'll turn on you,"" says Watson. Comments on modern journalism and paranoia about computer crimes are some of the updated themes. The episodes are:

Holmes may have met his match in ""A Scandal in Belgravia"". He and Watson are whisked off to Buckingham Palace in the middle of a case by big brother Mycroft (Mark Gatiss). Some illustrious person in the government wants Holmes to locate some compromising photographs in the possession of a dominatrix named Irene Adler (Laura Pulver). Adler anticipates Holmes' involvement in the case and befuddles him at first. But a group of well-armed, ruthless Americans are also after the photos. Or is their interest in something else entirely? Adler's life seems to be in danger, and Holmes is unusually protective. But who is playing whom, and why? This is a clever episode with plenty of twists and turns, but making it hinge on a 4-character password that any computer could crack is beyond ridiculous.

Holmes and Watson take on the seemingly supernatural in ""The Hounds of Baskerville"". Desperate for a case and a cigarette, Holmes listens to the tale of Henry Knight (Russell Tovey), who, as a young boy, witnessed an enormous dog kill his father on the moor near the town of Baskerville. Twenty years later, the giant hound on the moor is something of a legend among local conspiracy theorists, who believe it is related to animal experimentation done at a nearby top secret military base. Holmes sees a possible connection to a seemingly trivial case of a lost rabbit, so he and Watson are off to Baskerville, where big brother Mycroft sends DI Lestrade (Rupert Graves) to keep an eye on them. This story is still eccentric, but the writers have come up with a solution to the mystery of the demonic, glowing hound that is believable to a modern audience.

Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) shows just how dangerous a nemesis he is ""The Riechenbach Fall"". He breaks into the vault containing the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, the vault of the Bank of England, and Pentonville Prison simultaneously, apparently using some very clever lines of computer code. But why? He didn't steal anything. He has the British government, including Mycroft Holmes, terrified of him, and even Sherlock is perplexed and trepidatious. Moriarty says something about ""a final problem"" and promises, ""It's gonna start very soon, Sherlock. The Fall"". Moriarty is obviously insane, but that may mean that Sherlock Holmes won't be able to keep up with his brilliant but irrational mind. Unpredictable, fast-paced, with stabs at modern journalism, ego, and gullibility, this episode keeps the audience guessing and entertained.",1337731200,2,4225,5.005689900426742
4455707,5,B004QOB8SO,"I have but one regret about this set. There is no commentary offered on the extraordinary ""Reichenbach Fall"" episode. I would have loved to have been privy to some background on the creation of this marvelous, shattering episode.

Otherwise, a fantastic addition to the series and a great addition to my collection of Sherlock on film and TV!",1337644800,2,342,4.896551724137931
4455708,5,B004QOB8SO,"I was lucky enough to be in the UK when season 2 aired over the Christmas holiday. Now I'm so pleased I can watch it again in the US. The show was the highlight of Christmas telly for me. I'd watched the first season many times and was certainly was not disappointed with series two. The Blue-Ray is superb qaulity. Not much on offer as extras though. Less than the season One Blue-Ray. The Sherlock docu is quite short. Of course, one of the highlights of season One's Blue-Ray was the unaired pilot. Anyway, the the three episodes in season two are wonderful. This is British TV at it's best. Wonderful stuff. Now Sherlock has been set in the 21st Century, I hope the writers will let Sherlock and John get a civil partnership because it's so obvious they are in love. John Watson makes a good put upon wife!",1337644800,2,810,4.406666666666666
4455709,5,B004QOB8SO,"I loved the idea of putting Sherlock Holmes in modern day London.  I like the fact that Cumberbatch has added a hint of sexiness to his character. I love the fact that Watson is an Army medical doctor who was in Iraq and sufferes from PTSD. I love the relationship between these two men - which is a true, abiding friendship. I love the acting, especially from Cumberbatch and Freeman.

Having said that, I can understand why some people would not like this series. I do find it difficult to follow at times. For example, in 'A Scandal in Belgravia' I completely missed the part where Irene declares she is gay.  The ending in this one had me confused too, I assumed that somehow Sherlock saved Irene from beheading, but I am not sure how.  Sometimes things (like facts) get jumbled up in my head. Scenes run into one another. It can be frustrating. But for me, the series as a whole is still worth viewing.

I am fortunate in that I have never read the original books, so I don't have any other
prejudices getting in the way of enjoying this adaptation.

This series is very cutting-edge. It is not for everyone. But I do think it's worth watching one or two episodes to see if you like it or not. I will continue to enjoy Sherlock.  And it looks like I'll have to get the DVDs too, as I have learned from the reviews that I was cheated out of eight minutes here in the U.S.!",1337644800,2,1376,4.310077519379845
4455710,5,B004QOB8SO,"While Season One of BBC's SHERLOCK was insanely entertaining, incredibly intelligent, and remarkably well-acted, just three episodes wasn't enough. Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss did an extraordinary thing with the iconic tales of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: They MODERNIZED it. While that isn't a particularly remarkable thing in and of itself, what REALLY is extraordinary about this series is that the modernization WORKED flawlessly.

This season (which just ended last night in the U.S. being broadcast on PBS with some rather controversial editing since apparently eight minutes of each episode had to be chopped off to make room for PBS advertising) was not just better than the first season, it was more involving from a character standpoint. We got a much better glimpse into the souls of Sherlock Holmes (the wonderful Benedict Cumberbatch, who is rapidly becoming one of the hardest working men in Hollywood as well) and his faithful companion Dr. John Watson (the equally great Martin Freeman). The wonderful thing that this show has done since its inception has been to not marginalize the friendship between Holmes and Watson, but also not marginalizing Watson himself. While he is in constant awe of Holmes' remarkable deductive skills, he's also his own man and not the plump, blundering buffoonish character of old adaptations, and he makes important contributions to each case.

This season does only give us three more episodes, but each episode is essentially one feature-length film. The first episode is the best of the entire series yet, ""A Scandal In Belgravia"", which introduces this incarnation of Sherlock Holmes to the character of Irene Adler, who casual fans of the detective have seen as portrayed by Rachel McAdams in both of the Downey Jr./Law SHERLOCK HOLMES films. She is originally, as portrayed in Guy Ritchie's entertaining films, an American who moves to Europe and becomes a ""courtesan"" who is something of a foil and love interest for Holmes. In this episode though, Adler (Lara Pulver of MI-5) is a dominatrix who has enough secrets on her mobile phone to practically bring down the entirety of England. She enters into something of a game of obsession with Holmes. This game does bring other players, naturally, and soon Holmes is looking at something much larger. Cumberbatch and Pulver bring a very heightened sense of sexual tension to their scenes together, as Holmes feels something more for this woman than for any other woman in his life. Although, I have to say that arguably my favorite part in this episode is where we see how strong the bonds are between Holmes and his maternal landlady Mrs. Hudson (the wonderful Una Stubbs). The message is clear: Don't mess with the friends of Sherlock Holmes.

Then comes ""The Hounds of Baskerville"", which is the least of this season. A troubled young man comes to Holmes and Watson with the tale of a gigantic hound that killed his father years before in the countryside area of Dartmoor. At first, Holmes is astonishingly bored with the idea of this case, but something the young man says specifically pricks up his ears and the game is afoot. Also in Dartmoor is a government research facility called Baskerville, where apparently many secret experiments are being done, including genetic research. Could there be a military experiment of the creation of a huge dog? Is the explanation more complex even than that? There were many things to love about this episode, with one of my favorite moments being that of Holmes trying to quit smoking and references a ""seven percent solution"", but this was the only episode when I felt like I was ahead of Holmes and exactly what was happening and how it was happening. It still works and it is still very entertaining, particularly Cumberbatch's performance as he first truly feels the effects of fear and panic for perhaps the first time in his life.

Finally, we have ""The Reichenbach Fall"", which is a reference to the final confrontation between Holmes and his arch-nemesis James Moriarty. This episode, like the finale of the first season ""The Great Game"", is extremely dark and foreboding, as well it should be since you can't really have a light-hearted take on the mental combat between Holmes and Moriarty (played with flamboyant and psychotic relish by Andrew Scott). There's nothing I really want to say about this episode that can do it justice, but it's incredibly smart, incredibly tense and incredibly disturbing.

The other thing that the show has been so brilliant at doing is giving a more realistic (and more modern) take on the friendship between Holmes and Watson. It never tries to imply that they are more than friends, but the hordes of readers and critics of the Holmes/Watson partnership over the decades have done enough examinations of their own to come to the illogical conclusion that Holmes and Watson are lovers. These people are repeatedly poked fun at via the voice of Watson as he reads or hears or sees people who see the two of them as lovers, which is a bit of a running gag throughout the season, and Freeman plays it perfectly with just the right mixture of offense and incredulity. The other primary relationship here is that of Sherlock's relationship with his brother Mycroft (played by Mark Gatiss). Their relationship is strained beyond repair, but there's something touching about Mycroft's concern for his younger brother while at the same time, as in ""A Scandal in Belgravia"", where Mycroft knows his brother's incapability to work within the confines of normal society.

It's always a joy to see a program about extremely intelligent people that is created by extremely intelligent people. While I've never been a fan of DOCTOR WHO, I was extremely impressed with Moffat's updating of the Jekyll/Hyde tale in the series JEKYLL with the great James Nesbitt.

SHERLOCK will have ""competition"" soon on U.S. television as the upcoming CBS series ELEMENTARY with Johnny Lee Miller as Holmes and Lucy Liu as Watson (?) in yet another update, but apparently with the added attraction of doing some gender-bending. If this is anything like all the other procedural mysteries on CBS, it will probably be hugely successful from a ratings standpoint, but will be a massive creative failure. But it might well get people interested in this series, and that might just be good enough.",1337558400,11,6353,4.999054820415879
4455711,5,B004QOB8SO,"As I watched the first season of ""Sherlock,"" my fondness for this show increased. From the opening moments in ""A Study in Pink"" to the Moriarty's stunning entrance in ""The Great Game,"" I knew I was witnessing the rebirth of an icon. Yes, Mr. Downing Jr.'s portrayal in Hollywood's version is admirable and entertaining, but to find the true spirit of Sherlock Holmes one need look no further than this series. However, to say that it was ever more than ""darn good television"" would have been pushing it. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman put on a fantastic show, and ever so often the writing and acting gave small glimmers of greatness, but I was never tempted to say that the show had achieved lasting greatness (though to successfully transpose Holmes into the modern age was a feat in and of itself).

However, with ""The Reichenbach Fall,"" I'm pleased to say that Sherlock has left far behind casual crime drama (good drama though it was) and has now entered the realm of true, incredible art. From the writing to the acting, to the gripping, gut-wrenching final moments (I don't know who deserves more credit, Cumberbatch or Freeman for displaying some amazing acting chops), I am pleased to say that this episode delivered some of the finest television I've ever had the privilege of watching. To go any further into how incredible this single episode is would do a dis-service to you, if you have read this review so far. Stop reading and watch. Really.",1337558400,154,1466,4.794466403162056
4455712,5,B004QOB8SO,"I loved the first series, and I was thrilled to discover that Season Two is astonishing!
It is subtler, has more implied violence than the first series, which I appreciate. We do not need to always see the blood spilling!
Benedict Cumberbatch IS Sherlock! I read Conan Doyle and I am a big fan of Basil Rathbone, I really thought nobody can beat the classics! I was disappointed at the choice of Downey Jr. and Law playing in the movies, I think it's a mistake and those movies are a complete mess. Cumberbatch shows what refined acting can do with this material! He is an extremely talented actor, I can't praise him enough! He brings depth, intelligence and enough quirky humor to make it watching him such a delight!!!Same to be said about Martin Freeman, his low keyed fine acting brings dimension to Dr. Watson( BTW thank you writing team for not emasculating Dr. Watson as Nigel Bruce did!) The 2 of them together are priceless!
I do have to add few words about Moriarty! I know things have been said about the Scandal in Belgravia episode for good reasons! But my favorite is The Reichenbach fall, the writing there is terrific and the duel between Sherlock and Moriarty is such a magnificent piece of acting! Andrew Scott is fantastic!!! You cannot imagine a scarier Moriarty, the blank stare and the aloofness,a chilling depiction of a modern terrorist!
The series benefits from a great supporting cast :Rupert Graves, Gatiss himself, Una Stubbs,to name just a few, is fast paced and looks like slick advertising for London!
The team Steven Moffat-Mark Gatiss does an incredible job in reinventing the character, making him modern and sexy, and being reverent to the books at the same time! Can we get more than 3 episodes, please?!",1337558400,7,1741,4.768211920529802
4455713,5,B004QOB8SO,"I love this series. I think Conan Doyle would be astounded at the enduring popularity of this classic character. I have always been a Holmes fan. I enjoyed the victorian setting,and in the past when movie versions tried to put Sherlock in the future I thought it was lame. (Sherlock hunting the Nazi's). This version the writing , acting, and the city of London itself humming with life brings this character full circle. I enjoy the light touch , the humour with the dark drama just under the surface. This is very difficult to do well and all the people involved in this series have done an amazing job at bringing the characters to life. I even love the music. I have a son with Asperger's syndrome which is just beginning to be portrayed much more accurately in the media. Before all we had was ""Rain Man"", which shows a rather pathetic one dimensional character. I see my son in Sherlock so I admit to being a little in love with Benedict Cumberbach's interpretation of this character. I laughed at the Christmas scene at 221b, it was as if I caught a glimpse of my son in his future life.  Watson, is not a bumbling idiot but brings a much needed depth to his personality, he is a kind very competant doctor with a great sense of humor. He finds Holmes when his life is rather adrift,and has the insight to see beyond Holmes antisocial exterior to his humanity. Watson may not have the genius of Holmes, but he fills in the gaps of Holmes personality with his emotional intelligence, which Holmes slowly discovers he needs a bit in order to survive. Alot of people of been discussing Irene Adler who I thought was completely outrageous and fun to watch, albiet a little sexist. I think if Holmes ever decided to have a romance, I would choose Molly. I like her characterization. Like Watson, she is a kind , well educated and can overlook Holmes outrageous behavior. I could definitely identify with her. I am glad the weirdo's are getting some more insightful treatment by the media. As my older neurotypical son would say, he is ""weird"", but in a good way.",1337558400,6,2064,4.548387096774194
4455724,5,B004QOB8SO,"The cliffhanger that this episode ends on couldn't be cliffier if we had actually seen Holmes and Watson going over the falls to their death. Instead we get that nasty little ponce, Moriarty, causing trouble and wreaking the ultimate havoc in the lives of Holmes and Watson. Moriarty isn't out to steal anything, though Mycroft claims that he already has computer code that will grant him access to anything in the world, Moriarty is out to ruin and kill Holmes, the only entertainment left to him.

He does this by discrediting Holmes and the fall is far and dark indeed as it always is when it begins at the pinnacle. Holmes is shown as a narcissistic neurotic who faked all of his cases, at times even commiting the crimes for public adulation. How will Holmes escape the trap and will it be as ingenious as the original? We won't know until next season. The writing in the episode is fluent and fast-paced and the acting is as always superb. I have enjoyed this update of Holmes and will definitely tune in for the Season 3 when PBS airs them. As all episodes stand on their own, there is no need to see Season 1 before viewing Season 2 except for the utter enjoyment of watching all episodes of this update of a classic. Recommended not only to fans of the original Doyle stories and novels but to fans of the PBS Mystery series and mysteries in general.

Interesting take on the hound tale, but it just went on and on and was..dare I say it? Boring?  Also Holmes a bit caracaturish. The whole Mind Palace thing was cheesy and overacted (sorry Benedict - love you otherwise).  It was also just a bit weird to see our favorite London detectives out on the moors.

The actress playing Irene is tremendous.  Cumberbatch and Freeman are as great as ever.  They really try to make Sherlock a little less robotic and more human in this episode which helps in caring for the characters.  I've said it before in another review but I'll say it again - Martin Freeman is going to be absolute perfection as Bilbo Baggins in the Hobbit!",1337472000,15,539,4.680851063829787
4455727,5,B004QOB8SO,"I like this series a lot more than those Robert Downy, Jr. movies.  It does a better job striking a balance between being true to the original novels and yet making it accessible to a modern audience.

For instance, both the RDJ movies and the new TV show are more face-paced and action-oriented than the original novels.  But the action in the movies is over-the-top and cartoonish.  The action in the TV show is more realistic.  (It's by no means entirely realistic and definitely has some fantastical elements.  It's certainly not like you're not watching ""The Wire"".  But relative to the movies, it's nearly not as cartoonish.)

Also, in both the RDJ movies and the TV show the character of Holmes is a super genius who's egotistical and arrogant.  But the cockiness of RDJ's Holmes is somewhat whimsical and tongue-in-cheek.  It's like he's trying to be cool.  He's the class clown who is popular because of, not in spite of, his being an jerk.  The TV show Holmes is more of a straight-up jerk, a bit like the character of Dr. House in the TV show ""House"".

The RDJ Holmes seems to be aware of social conventions, etiquette and courtesies, he just thinks they're stupid. He intentionally breaks them in protest or to get a reaction.  However, the TV show Holmes is mostly oblivious to social norms.  He violates them out of ignorance.  There's an Aspergian quality to him, like the character of Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory.

Overall I'd say that, despite being set in modern London, the tone of the show is more on par with the books.

Finally, the TV version of Moriarty is very original, fiendish, creepy and entertaining.  He reminds me of the Joker from ""The Dark Knight"".",1337385600,5,1685,4.670068027210885

It's easy to write about sex, gore, and blood. Just look at what Hollywood puts out. Give em a thrill, make a buck and, make some more junk like another remake of an old movie that made money. Too bad British TV went the way of Hollywood and put out this trash instead of the quality they were known for all these years.

4455746,4,B004QOB8SO,"Writing an update for the classic Hound of the Baskervilles is a daunting task and I wouldn't have wanted to be the writer who had to take on that task. The original hound involved vengeance for a rape on the moors some years back. This new hound involves government experimentation in genetics and mind-altering substances, hotel owners, Moriarty and everything but the kitchen sink. Set in the far north of England, as was the original, Watson and Holmes have to travel at the request of a young man haunted and traumatized by the death of his father at the jaws of the harrowing hound. Others have seen this hound on the moors as well, though no one has yet caught it.

I love the new Sherlock series as my reviews indicate, but I was disappointed in this update. The plot was convoluted and a bit overwrought and except for the name bore no resemblence to the original. Other Sherlock scripts have kept key elements of the original stories while updating them to the twenty-first century. I would have liked to have seen the update where the hound was vengeance for a rape and believe that this could have been done rather than the secret government installation that we got. I did like the update of Lord Baskerville, who isn't a lord in this iteration but found the overall plot a bit overdone.

4455750,5,B004QOB8SO,"Look, I was skeptical, too.  Not because I was in love with any particular take on Sherlock--it's just there have been too many.  I'm old enough to remember several, and apart from the coziness of a Mrs. Hudson-run flat somewhere on a street I know well enough to say doesn't exist,  I never really GOT what all the fuss was about.  But man-o-man, was I a dope!  It isn't just that Watson's now ex-Army (so don't turn your back on him), or that the chimerical Rupert Graves is Lestrade to a ""T"" (along with subtleties like his accent: working-class softened by twenty years of immersion in City crime).  Or that Holmes' voice is deep enough to narrate the Apocalypse.  Nope.

It's things like this:  Jim Morriarty is TERRIFYING--unstable, off-hand, slight and white as milquetoast,  and utterly mad.  He's actually more frightening--and I say this advisedly---than Heath Ledger's Joker.  Really.  I finally get Conan-Doyle's point, for heaven's sake!

And that dark horse, Mark Gatiss, who's not only Mycroft but one of the series' writers, along with pal Steven Moffat.  This Mycroft is another revelation--slender, careful, deceptively soft-spoken, with redolent hints of his place at table with the Great and Good.  Fans of British tv may remember his well-meaning vet in the magisterial Leage of Gentlemen.

Suffice to say only that he's a miracle.  My daughter has always loved the character of Mycroft.  Now I know why.

It's the love--long-standing, fervent, mature--that writers and actors so obviously feel for the whole Tao of Conan-Doyle's Holmes--their respect--that most shines through the show's intelligence and fun.

Writers with lesser talents shouldn't try to modify these classic stories about the beginnings of criminalistics. Part of the appeal of the original classic stories is their world that is just before modern technology. Horse-drawn transport and steam locomotives, a world lit by fire (candles and gas lamps), no telephone or electricity, etc. make these stories a travelogue into the past. Even fingerprints or ballistics are not in use! These stories seem to have been written by someone with an artificially enhanced imagination.

""A Scandal in Belgravia"" begins by an immense swimming pool. There is a meeting between Sherlock and Moriarity; the latter walks away. [The opening scenes jump around.] Updating these classic stories takes away from the appeal of the originals. Sherlock uses the Internet to inspect a crime scene. [Besides looking silly, is that legally and scientifically sound?] We hear the name of Irene Adler and what she does for a living. Sherlock uses a ruse to get into her house. Irene is not surprised by this. Three armed men enter this room to rob the safe, but find what they don't want. There is action. [Is this confusing?] They communicate with cell phones. Sherlock recognizes a body from the neck down. Watson is lured away and gets a surprise! The story continues with intruders in Sherlock's rooms. They leave. The woman returns to hide in Sherlock's rooms. [Who wrote this confusing story?] Is this story designed to disgust the viewers? ""Nicely played."" Sherlock figures out the combination to that cell phone so he can get its information. Irene no longer has her protection. But she will be safe. Or will she? ""What shall we tell Sherlock?"" A witness protection program? ""Goodbye, Mr. Holmes."" Can there be another ending? Are they playing with their viewers? Or being deliberately stupid? Its like a comic cartoon.

""The Hounds of Baskerville"" begins with a young boy running at night. A nightmare? Sherlock Holmes is nervous and edgy, like from a physical ailment. Then he gets a case, a man's father was killed by a big black dog! A government experiment gone wrong? [No mention of private experiments!] Sherlock observes his client. [His ""bedside manner"" needs improvement.] They go to Dartmoor and learn about local beliefs and the hound. One man made a plaster cast of a dog's paw print. They tour a Top Secret government post. ""Blue Bell""? [Is this padding?] They go out on the moor at night. [Unarmed?] They hear a strange noise. ""A gigantic hound""? Sherlock notices a couple at the inn. Events continue. Will they make sense? Did a local businessman create a stunt with a big dog to attract tourists? Watson explores the laboratory by himself for scary events. Did he see what he expected to see? There are scenes that suggest hallucinations. A secret project? There is a call about Henry. Where is he? Can he remember what really happened twenty years ago? Sherlock explains the effects of fear and stimulus. Shots are fired! The old murder is solved! [Do you find any of this credible?] There are more explanations about the laboratory.
What a horrible pile of scrap! The original ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" was a subtle criticism of a hereditary aristocracy that used a clever attempt at murder. Its background told of life in the late 19th century in a small rural village. What is the value of this movie? Can't the writers create their own drama instead of modifying a classic story to create a counterfeit? Do they need to stop smoking?

""The Reichenbach Falls"" begins with a meeting between Dr. Watson and his psychiatrist. Sherlock is dead! The story begins with the return of a kidnapped banker to his family. Sherlock welcomes publicity! Tourists visit the Tower of London. They are scanned by machines. There is a break-in where the Crown Jewels are kept. The police find an intruder on the throne. ""Get Sherlock!"" Sherlock meets a woman reporter in the men's room and diagnoses her condition. Sherlock corrects a lawyer as to the law. He diagnoses the jury! ""Don't get clever"" advises Watson. Moriarity chews gum. The jury says ""not guilty"". [A comedy?] Moriarity visits Sherlock to talk, uses a riddle to threaten him, then disappears. Mycroft warns about four assassins who moved next door to Sherlock. Sherlock investigates missing school children, one left a clue. Bread crumbs in an envelope? Sherlock locates the children. A man who helps Sherlock is shot dead! There is a shocking surprise for Sherlock. [Can you believe this story?] Another man who helps Sherlock is shot dead! Later they meet a very good actor, Richard Brook. [Believable?] A reporter has a scoop on Sherlock: he is a fake! [Isn't this a crazy story?] Moriarity is the most dangerous criminal because of his key code. We hear news about Mrs. Hudson. Holmes and Moriarity meet on a roof top. There is talk about falling. Can Sherlock stop Moriarity's plans? ""No, you're not."" There is a gun shot. Sherlock talks to Watson. [Can this story get even more confused?] A man falls from the rooftop. The paramedics take the body away. Snipers disassemble their rifles and leave the building. Sherlock's friends are safe now. [I hope this is the end of this series.]",1336348800,21,5230,4.926303854875283

Well-written, Sherlock Season-2 begins with ""Scandal,"" and the introduction of Irene Adler - beautiful, aloof and logical thief, a female version of Holmes, who sees her life's partner in Sherlock. They move through the flirtation dance of one-upmanship with the grace of a ballet, and impress and attract each other with each step of the case. When it comes down to picking one thing that makes a movie great, here, I choose the storyline, the plotting! Someone as notorious as Irene Adler, and James Moriarty, MUST be capable of very complex plots. And this is one for the ages! Just when I thought I had the plot figured out, it took me in a new direction (and I said ""Oh, right!""). I LOVED EVERY MINUTE of it! Also, I think the direction and editing is also flawless.

In fact, the only blatant flaw that I noticed, was in A Scandal in Belgravia the American accent was horrible.

4455799,3,B004QOB8SO,"While I hate lowering my rating of such an otherwise excellent production to 3 stars, Sherlock's sophomore effort was beleagured with fundamental problems too numerous and glaring to be overlooked. There were serious weaknesses pertaining to characterization, plot continuity, and gratuitous amounts of fan service inserted to such an extent as to negatively effect the cleverness, intellectual integrity,character portrayals, and scripting that contributed to making series 1 so outstanding.

The blame, I am sorry to say, lies squarely on the shoulders of Steven Moffat for distorting so thoroughly every element that comprised the first episode, 'A Scandal In Belgravia'. About 60% of the way through ASiB, I honestly had to wonder what on earth was this garbled, puerile nonsense I was watching, and more importantly, what did it have to do with Sherlock Holmes? The episode seemed nothing but a poorly written work of fan fiction and some James Bond/Dr Who-esque conglomeration.

That aside, the travesty that was episode one began with the cliffhanger ""resolution"", which was utterly ridiculous, a complete cop out, and left us with several glaring loose ends and outright plot holes. Disappointing as it was, I was eager to forgive this because, well, series 2 was here (!). But the already weak episode went downhill the moment Irene Adler's character stepped on screen. No, I don't care a whit she was made into a lesbian dominatrix. I was actually excited about the prospect as I thought that was inserted to prevent her from being viewed as some love interest, which she most decidedly was NOT in Canon. But oh, how wrong I was to be proven...

There was not even an attempt made at presenting her as the clever woman of Doyle's stories, the only woman to ever outwit Holmes, who forced the misogynistic detective to rethink his stance on a female's wit. Here, there is no respect and admiration of Adler on Sherlock's part, as Moffat's Adler does not use even one brain cell throughout, and Sherlock is too busy having a sulk. Adler's cleverness is all smoke and mirrors, even going so far as making her into a damsel in distress at the end. The script quickly degrades to the point where nothing in this episode can be looked at as redeemable. It was cheapened into nothing but sexual tension, and was easily the most shallow, superficial take on the story ever achieved. Holmes' character was was so far beyond recognizable (NOT the fault of the estimable Benedict Cumberbatch, but of the script) it was actually painful to watch. I cringed at frequent intervals and was so put off by this episode, I was ready to abandon the series entirely.

'The Hounds of Baskerville' and 'The Reichenbach Fall', however, were a vast improvement over Moffat's failed attempt, and were more than worthy of the series. The latter two writers successfully cleared away the clutter that could not be utilized in updating the original Canon stories, stripping plots down to the bare bones and giving us something engaging, well written and credible. More importantly, we see the characterizations click back into place despite profound liberties being taken with the stories themselves. Mark Gatiss is a phenomenal pastiche and horror writer, and I was excited to see how he drastically changed HOUN without sacrificing an iota of who the characters were, and gave us a genuinely frightening, engaging story in the process.

And as poignantly acted and scripted as the final episode was, I think a vast amount of credit should go to Steve Thompson for two things. First, for taking the criticisms he received for The Blind Banker and using them to improve his craft and giving us what could be the finest episode to date, both characterization and scripting wise. Secondly, for taking Molly, a character created by the disgustingly misogynistic Steven Moffat (who should truly be kept from writing any female characters ever again, god spare us all) and turned her into a phenomenal entity in her brief but instrumental scenes. Well done, sir. In fact, it was the efforts of the latter two writers and the outstanding performances of both Cumberbatch & Freeman who brought Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson to life that entirely redeemed this programme for me. And while ASiB unfortunately did force me to lower my overall rating, it's worth mentioning that the THOB and TRF are well deserving of five stars apiece.",1333756800,28,4412,4.997278911564626
4455800,4,B004QOB8SO,"The three almost-movie-length episodes of the second series are, in some ways, more of the same, but when ""the same"" is one of the best re-interpretive series in the history of television, well... that's a mouthful. The only disappointing aspect of series 2 is that it doesn't quite live up to series 1. The ongoing plot thread involving Moriarty was resolved in a way that I thought didn't really express the sense that the books give: that he's not only a twisted sort of fan of Sherlock, but also his mental peer.

Still love Doctor Watson, and the romantic tension between Sherlock and Watson continues to be a source of humor in the show. Everyone seems to step up their acting game a bit in the 2nd series (if you can believe it), and the music continues to be a joy (I have to go see if it's available as a soundtrack, now).",1333584000,12,831,4.431372549019608

4455802,5,B004QOB8SO,"A brilliant series. I don't know how anyone can dislike this show. Sherlock Season 1 was awesome. Benedict and Freeman performed amazingly, while the supporting cast(especially the woman playing Mrs. Hudson and Andrew Scott's Moriarty)rocked as well. Season Two is even better. The acting is ramped up a notch, the scripts are better for the most part, the overarching story is defined, and Benedict and Freeman really develop with their characters.
Episode One is entitled ""A Scandal in Belgravia."" When I saw this episode, I felt that it was the best and most cinematic episode till date. Sherlock has to crack the code of Irene Adler's camera phone. The case is awesome and the episode has a very espionage feel to it. The sequence in the airport is beautiful. Needless to say, the solution is pretty mind blowing. 10/10
The second episode, ""The Hounds of Baskerville"" isn't as good as the previous episodes, but still better than ""The Blind Banker""(still a good episode). Being the worst episode of the season still means it is a very solid episode. The first and third acts are very good. It's just the middle part that drags a bit, lessening the experience. 8.8/10 i guess
The last episode of this season is absolutely frigging stupendous. I was clapping and near tears at the end of this 90 minute episode. Moriarty attempts to tear apart Sherlock's life in every way. Sherlock isn't a loser though. After an awesome heist scene, trial, and conversation between our hero and villain, the episode is a fantastic sequence of mystery, chases, and character revelations. 10/10
This season as well as the first deserve a standing ovation.",1332892800,6,1640,4.924187725631769
4455813,3,B004QOB8SO,"I love these modern interpretations of the classic character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the 1880's. This is the same Sherlock Holmes that stalked those foggy London streets, albeit a bit ruder, but now he has a cell phone!

Leave it to a madman to give up far too easily. When last we saw Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch), he was a bit tied up with Moriarty waiting for a bomb to go off in his face, but one phone call and his arch-nemesis calls the whole thing off, since he has better things to do. Sherlock returns to his flat with his best friend John Watson (Martin Freeman) and proceeds to be bored... with a lot of things. With his newfound popularity, with the fact that John's blog is a big hit, with the photographers following him around, and the lackluster cases brought to him concerning missing ashes and dead grandfathers and so forth. He wants something better, something to capture his interest... and he's about to get it.

One morning bright and early, Sherlock is plucked from the flat and taken to Buckingham Palace for a little chat with his elder brother Mycroft (Mark Gatiss). It seems that a professional dominatrix named Irene Adler has some photographs of a member of the royal family that they would really rather not got out to the press. One would assume it was for purpose of blackmail, but other than informing them of the incriminating images, Irene has not asked for anything else. This peaks his interest and alleviates his boredom and somewhat reluctantly he agrees to investigate and manipulate her out of the contents of her phone, little realizing that Irene intends to be one step ahead of him the entire way.

Where through subsequent viewings of this episode, I managed to untangle my initial horrified reaction from my ability to be impartial, I must say that my first time through the season premiere was a bit... uncomfortable. Not only has series creator and head writer Steven Moffat taken one of the more remarkable women in Doyle's stories and regressed her feminism and intelligence back a couple of centuries, he has also made that first hour and a half a bit rough going if you plan on having your family in the room. Irene is a bisexual dominatrix that spends an entire scene in the buff (the camera is careful, but we still get an eyefull).

My feelings about this season are varied. It has some truly wonderful moments but I'm a bit torn by the Irene Adler fiasco. Moffat, who is usually known for his tight plots, goes out on a limb with a complicated and confusing episode that is not quite up to par with the second episode, in which Mark Gatiss modernizes the most famous of all Holmes mysteries, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Now that is a brilliant hour and a half of television, with enough references to the original to please fans but an independent conclusion all its own, so do not anticipate things turning out the same way after all.

The third episode is also the most emotional and if you have not read the original stories, you may want to prepare for a horrific twist toward the end. I'm not quite certain where as a fan I stand on their interpretation of Moriarty as a pure madman but I must say that among other things (such as not having Watson be a dolt, as many adaptations fumble in that area) their interpretation of Mycroft Holmes is inspired. He has the right amount of sheer humanity and genius, a touch of arrogance and insult that makes him identifiable as a Holmes but a bit more distance than his brother. Each of the three episodes has its allure in clever writing and memorable moments, throwing in humorous antics as well as more serious and life-threatening situations. I'm a bit sorry that the premiere had so many issues in it because near-nudity aside, it's actually an intriguing installment. Many viewers may find the constant references to homosexuality tiring as I do, but overall Sherlock is still one of the finest things on television and at the end of its short season, leaves us wanting more.",1332892800,70,4011,4.643661971830986

The vivid music, the witty script (e.g. Brainy is the new sexy), the sophisticated yet intriguing plots, the excellent performing actors, the state of the art choreography....are all, IMHO, perfect. In short, don't miss it.

4455816,5,B004QOB8SO,"The first season certainly ended on a terrific note and fans could hardly wait for the next set of episodes in a thrilling, modernized Sherlock Holmes take.  In ""Sherlock, Series II"" we find the world's greatest consulting detective and his good doctor up to even more thrilling escapades.  Season I was so thrilling that I ordered the advance copy of Season II from the UK--it's not yet shown here in the States, but there is great anticipation for it, however.

  Sherlock's ""brilliance"" has never been so cleverly presented.  Benedict Cumberbatch (as Sherlock) and Martin Freeman (Dr. Watson) seem perfectly matched and merely watching their bantering (and loyalty) is refreshing and at the same time touching.  The genius of Sherlock, just because it's been updated in time, is never in doubt--but updating it to modern times, with the latest of technological ""gadgets"" is also a bit mesmerizing.

  In Series II, we find (only) three adventures: ""A Scandal in Belgravia,"" ""The Hounds of Baskerville, "" and  ""The Reichenbach Fall,"" are all based upon the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories, with, of course, clever updating.

  And what Holmes adventures would be complete without at least a mention of Moriarty. We found him at the close of the final episode in Season I and, of course, we pick up where we left off.

  At the end of ""The Reichenbach Fall,"" I was a bit shocked--but the realized that the clever producers have, once again, set us up for another season. It cannot come too soon.

4455817,5,B004QOB8SO,"Such was the ego-stroking the cast & creators received for their first series of SHERLOCK, they couldn't help but gain huge confidence as they try to top themselves in Series 2. Steven Moffat always did have roaring self-esteem, and so he and co-creator Mark Gattis shrugged and decided to take on the three most iconic touchstones in the Sherlock Holmes canon. Series 2 is a (mostly) brilliant reworking of, in Moffat's own words, ""the Hound, the Woman, and the Professor.""

It was a ba11sy move to reimagine Sherlock Holmes in 21st Century England. That it worked tremendously is due to smart writing and the amazing chemistry between the two leads, Cumberbatch and Freeman. The writers inserted clever touches such as the onscreen texts which reveal Holmes' instantaneous deductions and his ready application of contemporary tools (cell phones, the Internet, etc.) to aid his investigations. In this universe, Holmes attains his clients primarily thru Watson's popular online blog in which the good doctor recounts Holmes' cases. The writers and creators are so cocky nowadays that they don't hesitate to inject broader bits of comedy (an act of heresy were this show not as good). As such we witness fleeting play-on-word references to Holmes' more trivial cases such as ""The Geek Interpreter"" and ""The Speckled Blonde."" For whatever reason, I smile whenever the camera pans to Speedy's Sandwich Bar & Cafe, atop of which is where Holmes and Watson share lodgings, very much still 221B Baker Street. At heart, Sherlock Holmes is still very much the cold, calculating machine. But Series 2 aims to poke a hole in that stance.

""A Scandal in Belgravia"" picks up where Series 1 left off, a cliffhanger involving Watson strapped onto an explosives vest and a stand-off between Holmes and weird international consulting criminal James Moriarty. This matter is resolved within moments (or, more likely, put on the shelf), with Moriarty casually sauntering off to torment Holmes on a later day. ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" is this series' compelling adaptation of ""A Scandal in Bohemia,"" the story that introduced the world's most famous femme fatale in literature, the crafty and alluring Irene Adler. In this incarnation, Irene Adler is a dominatrix (someone refers to what she does as ""recreational scolding""; heh). She blackmails her high end clientele with compromising images she stores in her mobile phone. One such victim happens to be closely linked to the royal crown, and so that Internet phenom, Sherlock Holmes, is dragged (clad only in bed sheets) into the affair. I will say that ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" is an utter pleasure to watch. For one thing, it delivers two amusing comments about Holmes' trousers.

This is the most fleshed-out (in more ways than one) that Irene Adler has ever been portrayed on screen. Lara Pulver is classy and mesmerizing as ""The Woman,"" and she creates plenty of sparks with Cumberbatch. Irene Adler certainly gets under Holmes' skin. Holmes eventually takes possession of Irene's all-important cell phone but for most of the episode he's stumped by the access password. The solution, when it finally arrives, drew a big smile from my mug.

I wasn't as enamoured of ""The Hounds of Baskerville,"" which I thought was the weakest episode, and yet still quite watchable. But, then again, I wasn't that fond of the original story, either, so I do claim some bias. Some of the original plot survives: that of a man in the atmospheric moors being stalked by an infernal hound. But then we eye the forbidding British army compound and the conspiracy theorists, and that's the modern spin in play. If ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" introduced Sherlock Holmes to a twisted kind of passion (it's questionable whether it's love he feels for Irene), ""The Hounds of Baskerville"" shoved terror directly in his face. It's a bit jarring to see the aloof detective quivering in fright.

The deadly mind games between Holmes and Moriarty escalate in the riveting third episode, ""The Reichenbach Fall."" The story opens with Moriarty allowing himself to be captured by the constabulary after three daring simultaneous break-ins. I won't say more except that it's all part of Moriarty's devious plan to get Sherlock Holmes, that this pushes Holmes to the very brink of defeat, that this may be the finest bit of acting I've seen from Martin Freeman (one of cinema's finest reactors), and that Andrew Scott (""Moriarty"") redeems himself from his previous what-the-hell-was-that? appearances. Really, no universe should exist in which Moriarty throws a raspberry.

4455818,5,B004QOB8SO,"ADDED IN JULY:  If you watched ""Sherlock"" on PBS, you have not seen all of it.  In order to make room for some of their own material, PBS had something like 8 minutes cut from each episode (including some entire scenes).  The DVDs have the intact episodes.  Near as I can tell, the Region 1 and Region 2 DVDs are identical (except for the PBS or BBC logo that plays when the disc first loads), so if you have a Region 1 player, by all means get the Region 1 DVD (this product!), now that it's actually available.

MY ORIGINAL COMMENTS FROM FEBRUARY:  The British (region 2) DVD is already available on Amazon UK (just scroll to the bottom of this or any page, to the line of countries under the Amazon logo, and click on ""United Kingdom"").  You will need a region 2 or region-free DVD player.  (Hint: The DVD players on many laptops are region-free.)

The writing, the acting, the CINEMATOGRAPHY, the costumes, the portrayal, the twists, the turns, the wit, the suspense: all create a fresh, new, brilliant invention of Sherlock Holmes in the 21 century...it will capture you and never let you go.
So go...watch this. You will not be disappointed.",1326758400,302,484,4.773809523809524
4455822,5,B004QOB8SO,"This is the first series that I've seen from BBC, and let me tell you: it did not disappoint! The superb acting is matched only by the writing and effects, and the chemistry between Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman (as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, respectively) lends the series a realism that sucks you in and makes you root for them from the first minute. Although set in the 21st century, this series stays faithful to the canon, with details that any true Sherlock Holmes fan will appreciate. You will want to watch them again and again. It will definately be worth the money, once it's available.",1326672000,101,616,4.712962962962963
