3043311,5,B000ZOT8FO,"Jackass 2.5 is hilarious 60 minute collection of hilarious and stupid clips of various stunts from the Jackass crew. Up to their usual tricks they do things like: Drinking loogies, piss squirt gun, anal Bead A** Kite, rattlesnake condom popping, rusty nail bed in India with cobras, snapping turtle to the nose and more. A great warm up to Jackass 3 coming sometime in 2008. Worth a look for fans of Jackass!",1198713600,4,408,4.680555555555555
3043312,5,B000ZOT8FO,"I just watched this to see if it was Number 2 with a few added scenes. It is not, they filmed so much material doing the second movie they basically had enough for two movies. This release is over an hour of all new material, no material from Number 2. At least they didn't try and make money off of us by putting this in theaters.

3043313,1,B000ZOT8FO,Its obvious why these skits didn't make the movie.  They are all pretty bad.  Also a good 35% of 2.5 is them talking about the skits and talking about the movie.  This could have easily been made into 20 more minutes of bonus footage on Jackass 2.  At only an hour long its hard to even consider this a DVD.  Save your money and just read what the skits were.,1198195200,4,359,4.071428571428571

This just like every other Jackass release, made me laugh my ASS off the whole way through. I can respect people's opinion's, but sometimes they really make me scratch my head.

I recommend this fun little DVD to any Jackass fan who want's to see some really funny footage that Unfortunately couldn't make it in Number Two :)",1285545600,2,455,4.404761904761905
3043346,5,B000ZOT8FO,"We really enjoyed these extra bits that weren't in Jackass 2, especially the part when Preston farts in Steve-O's face!  It'd been a while since we'd laughed that hard - thanks, Jackass guys!",1261872000,,191,4.787878787878788
3043357,4,B000ZOT8FO,"A lot of people have posted how this is a rip off and they should have included it with the extras on the ""Number Two"" DVD and blah blah blah.  This is really a lot of hit and miss stuff.  A lot of the stunts/skits are great and then there are a few that are just mind-numbingly bad.  The thing is that the good ones so far outshine the bad that it makes it great to pop into the player for a good laugh and really for a fan it is a must have.  A lot of the stuff on here is the stuff that are glimpsed of during the end credits of the movie.  It is essentially what the second disk of ""Number Two"" would have been had they released it as a two disk set.  For that reason the extras on here are pretty sparse.  No commentary as there is pretty much a running commentary through interviews between stunts.  I highly recommend it but I'm a die hard fan who wishes they would make a third movie.",1256169600,2,892,3.9441340782122905
3043358,2,B000ZOT8FO,"Basically, this is anything that was not worth the time or effort to be edited and thrown into Jackass 2, either because it just couldn't be cut shorter, it didn't turn out the way they wanted, or it just wasn't funny. While some scenes could have been edited into shorter clips, they just weren't worth it and that is what it is all presented here. Through post-film and on the set interviews, 2/4 of the ""movie"" is just the whole crew describing the next scenes and while some might seem interesing, they just don't turn out funny at all. This is definately not worthy of a movie or your time unless your a die-hard collector of Jackass stuff.",1210809600,7,645,4.47457627118644
3043359,1,B000ZOT8FO,"I've seen episodes of the TV show and both Jackass 1 and 2.  The guys are at their best, in my opinion, when they are attempting lame-brained stunts.  The show and the first two movies offered a high ratio of good solid laughs to every moment where you turned away from the screen in embarassment.
2.5 is mostly about the guys getting rectally violated in some way. If foreign object insertions, prostate exams, and so on are things you find funny, you'll enjoy 2.5.  There's also a fair amount of on-screen defecating, if that amuses you.
The conceit of the movie is that most of what you'll see didn't work, so it wasn't included in 2.  They were right to leave this material on the editing room floor.  It's just not funny.  It's disgusting, it's embarassing, but it isn't funny.
Wait for 3, or go back and watch the show or 1 and 2 over again.  You'll regret it if you waste your cash on this.",1205712000,3,897,4.367469879518072
3043360,1,B000ZOT8FO,"As many have already said, this is not a new ""film"", but leftover commentaries and stunts from Jackass 2.  I found it hilarious when MTV said they were releasing this straight to DVD, many ""cultural"" critics were aghast, saying this was the end of movies being released to theaters (and other melodramatic and hyperbolic things like that).  Since when are the Jackass movies a measure of the motion picture industry anyway?

MTV really should have released this with the Jackass 2 set.  It would have improved it a bit.  Jackass 2 is not as good as the first one, and it's quite uncomfortable to watch.  I think the series has run its course, but then, some people can't get enough of these guys.",1205020800,2,696,4.617886178861789
3043361,1,B000ZOT8FO,"I love everything Jackass.  I faithfully watched the series and movies.  I eagerly waited for the DVDs.  I didn't hesitate to buy Jackass 2.5.  STUPID!  Why would I not buy it, right?  A bunch of average-looking, yet incredibly loveable guys creating mayhem in every city they haven't been run out of: sounds like a good watch to me.  There wouldn't be any reason to hesitate buying it when the show and two previous movies were such a hit, would there?

Jackass 2.5 was nothing more than a shameless money-making attempt by a bunch of guys who are starting to feel the cash flow pinch.  My friends and I are devoted to Jackass, but we'll pass on the spinoff, Wild Boyz,which is nothing more than a spandex-clad, vomit orgy.  While Viva La Bam! was MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better than Wild Boyz, how may times can we laugh at Bam beating up Phil before our laughter becomes painfully hysterically?  And Knoxville's attempts at acting have sadly left us with Men in Black II, The Ringer, and The Dukes of Hazzard.  The boys of Jackass are best being, well jackasses!  Unfortunatly, there's only so far this franchise can take you.",1201392000,2,1122,4.634517766497462
3043362,2,B000ZOT8FO,"In what really should have been the second disc to ""Jackass Number Two"", Jackass 2.5 features behind-the-scenes, deleted segments, and interviews of the Jackass crew. That's pretty much it. All 64 minutes. Sure, some of the segments are funny, like the ""Beauty and the Beast"" segment and the one with Johnny Knoxville getting a prostate exam, but really, nothing that constitutes paying $20 or more.

Special Features-
*The Making of Jackass 2.5- Seems really redundant at this point, but it's more interviews and deleted stunts
*The Making of Jackass The Game- A look at the Jackass gang doing motion capture for their game. Pretty funny.
*Bonus Segments and Stunts- More stunts and segments from filming Number Two and their MTV premiere of Jackass The Movie.
*A plug for jackassworld.com
*A photo gallery
*Previews for Wildboyz seasons 3 & 4 on DVD, The Heartbreak Kid, and Rob & Big seasons 1 & 2 on DVD.

Overall, I don't think anyone should buy this unless they really need to complete their Jackass video collection. Now, I am a fan (I got both movies, and the box set), and I felt a little ripped off when I actually watched it. Would be a better idea to buy it if it was around $10 or so.",1200441600,,1197,4.6415094339622645
3043363,1,B000ZOT8FO,"This compilation of outtakes from Jackass 2 is strictly for the fanatical Jackass fan. I've always been an avid fan of the Jackass movies nad Wildboyz TV series but this is a waste of time. What you have is nearly two hours of outtakes that were considered too lame for Jackass 2--and they're still so lame and boring that you would think a grammar school kid had video taped the sequences. You're given scene after scene showing the Jackass cast and crew shrieking in uncontrollable laughter and hysteria as they watch themselves on screen. Then you're presented with endless talky interviews that one would expect to have found on the Jackass 2 DVD. What's strange is that the most popular cast member, Chris 'Party Boy' Pontius is giving absolutley nothing to do. You see him hiding behind his guitar, talking, talking. Much of the film emphasizes bare bottoms and which ones do they constantly use? Those of wee man and the 300 pound man.  They're enough to make you truly barf. In one scene, Johnny Knoxville puts the wee man over his lap and powders his bare rear. What was the point, except to watch Knoxville and the cast and crew nearly collapsing on the floor with hysteria. Even worse is the continual showing of the fat man's bare rump and the different things that are done to it. You really want to barf. Why couldn't they have used the rears of some of the better looking guys--like the Party Boy? There's also one sequence where Bam Mangera receives a prostate exam in a sex shop in Russia. Bam screams and hollars and convulses while this is being done--with one finger--until you'd think this guy has a tree trunk being used instead of a doctor's finger. You can only hope that Jackass 3 will be a hell of a lot more interesting than these boring, lame episodes that are all so boring and lame and worthless that I could barely get through to the end.",1200182400,2,1869,4.57910447761194
3043364,4,B000ZOT8FO,"I was a bit sceptical about this DVD when I ordered it. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to find that everything on it is new. Nothing from Jackass 2. It probably should have simply been included as extras on the Jackass 2 DVD, but I'm still okay with paying $20 for it because there is a lot of material here that any true fan is going to love. If I had to make a comparison, I would say that this DVD is a combination between the movie BORAT and the book THE DISTURBED WRITINGS OF ADAM COCHRAN.",1199923200,,500,4.164948453608248
3043365,2,B000ZOT8FO,"For die-hard fans of the Jackass and CKY crews, this provides some great commentary and clips that were left out of Jackass 2 -- however, there is a reason they were left out of the other movie ... they are pretty lame. Many of the clips are failed attempts or stunts gone wrong (not awesome 'wrong', rather didn't work at all).

For those who aren't as familiar with the crew and their antics, the stunts and skits in this video aren't that spectacular. If you haven't seen Jackass 2, I would suggest buying that and just watching the special features and added scenes from that DVD ... because that's pretty much what this entire video is ... sub-par content that should've been buried in the Jackass 2 special features.",1199491200,,722,4.596899224806202
3043366,1,B000ZOT8FO,"As a fan I hate to give a Jackass Dvd such a low rating but this is nothing but a way to make more money off fans that should have been given this material when they bought Jackass 2, and it's quite overpriced on top of that at $20.  This DVD is nothing but scenes that were too bad to be included in Jackass 2 and various people explaining why they were too bad or did not work as planned as an intro to each clip.  The only newly shot material on this DVD is the intro and outro of the movie which is nothing to look at it's just them all standing on stage and saying welcome to Jackass 2.5 basically.  This whole DVD could have been included with Jackass 2 as a couple extra minutes of deleted scenes, instead they chose to try and make another $20 off of us all by making us buy the movie twice.  You have already seen most of these scenes in the ending credits of Jackass 2 such as them on the driving range, wee man in the cooler with the watergun, and riding minibikes in the grocery store.  In all honesty there is nothing here that I will watch more than once since these scenes are all awful, and even for Jackass fans I cannot recommend this DVD unless you have money to burn.",1198800000,34,1187,4.07725321888412

It is essentially what the second disk of ""Number Two"" would have been had they released it as a two disk set.  For that reason the extras on here are pretty sparse.  No commentary as there is pretty much a running commentary through interviews between stunts.  I highly recommend it but I'm a die hard fan who wishes they would make a third movie.",1256169600,2,892,3.9441340782122905
3277855,2,B000ZOT8FO,"Basically, this is anything that was not worth the time or effort to be edited and thrown into Jackass 2, either because it just couldn't be cut shorter, it didn't turn out the way they wanted, or it just wasn't funny. While some scenes could have been edited into shorter clips, they just weren't worth it and that is what it is all presented here. Through post-film and on the set interviews, 2/4 of the ""movie"" is just the whole crew describing the next scenes and while some might seem interesing, they just don't turn out funny at all. This is definately not worthy of a movie or your time unless your a die-hard collector of Jackass stuff.",1210809600,7,645,4.47457627118644
3277856,1,B000ZOT8FO,"I've seen episodes of the TV show and both Jackass 1 and 2.  The guys are at their best, in my opinion, when they are attempting lame-brained stunts.  The show and the first two movies offered a high ratio of good solid laughs to every moment where you turned away from the screen in embarassment.
2.5 is mostly about the guys getting rectally violated in some way. If foreign object insertions, prostate exams, and so on are things you find funny, you'll enjoy 2.5.  There's also a fair amount of on-screen defecating, if that amuses you.
The conceit of the movie is that most of what you'll see didn't work, so it wasn't included in 2.  They were right to leave this material on the editing room floor.  It's just not funny.  It's disgusting, it's embarassing, but it isn't funny.
Wait for 3, or go back and watch the show or 1 and 2 over again.  You'll regret it if you waste your cash on this.",1205712000,3,897,4.367469879518072
3277857,1,B000ZOT8FO,"As many have already said, this is not a new ""film"", but leftover commentaries and stunts from Jackass 2.  I found it hilarious when MTV said they were releasing this straight to DVD, many ""cultural"" critics were aghast, saying this was the end of movies being released to theaters (and other melodramatic and hyperbolic things like that).  Since when are the Jackass movies a measure of the motion picture industry anyway?

MTV really should have released this with the Jackass 2 set.  It would have improved it a bit.  Jackass 2 is not as good as the first one, and it's quite uncomfortable to watch.  I think the series has run its course, but then, some people can't get enough of these guys.",1205020800,2,696,4.617886178861789
3277858,1,B000ZOT8FO,"I love everything Jackass.  I faithfully watched the series and movies.  I eagerly waited for the DVDs.  I didn't hesitate to buy Jackass 2.5.  STUPID!  Why would I not buy it, right?  A bunch of average-looking, yet incredibly loveable guys creating mayhem in every city they haven't been run out of: sounds like a good watch to me.  There wouldn't be any reason to hesitate buying it when the show and two previous movies were such a hit, would there?

Jackass 2.5 was nothing more than a shameless money-making attempt by a bunch of guys who are starting to feel the cash flow pinch.  My friends and I are devoted to Jackass, but we'll pass on the spinoff, Wild Boyz,which is nothing more than a spandex-clad, vomit orgy.  While Viva La Bam! was MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better than Wild Boyz, how may times can we laugh at Bam beating up Phil before our laughter becomes painfully hysterically?  And Knoxville's attempts at acting have sadly left us with Men in Black II, The Ringer, and The Dukes of Hazzard.  The boys of Jackass are best being, well jackasses!  Unfortunatly, there's only so far this franchise can take you.",1201392000,2,1122,4.634517766497462
3277859,2,B000ZOT8FO,"In what really should have been the second disc to ""Jackass Number Two"", Jackass 2.5 features behind-the-scenes, deleted segments, and interviews of the Jackass crew. That's pretty much it. All 64 minutes. Sure, some of the segments are funny, like the ""Beauty and the Beast"" segment and the one with Johnny Knoxville getting a prostate exam, but really, nothing that constitutes paying $20 or more.

Special Features-
*The Making of Jackass 2.5- Seems really redundant at this point, but it's more interviews and deleted stunts
*The Making of Jackass The Game- A look at the Jackass gang doing motion capture for their game. Pretty funny.
*Bonus Segments and Stunts- More stunts and segments from filming Number Two and their MTV premiere of Jackass The Movie.
*A plug for jackassworld.com
*A photo gallery
*Previews for Wildboyz seasons 3 & 4 on DVD, The Heartbreak Kid, and Rob & Big seasons 1 & 2 on DVD.

Overall, I don't think anyone should buy this unless they really need to complete their Jackass video collection. Now, I am a fan (I got both movies, and the box set), and I felt a little ripped off when I actually watched it. Would be a better idea to buy it if it was around $10 or so.",1200441600,,1197,4.6415094339622645
3277860,1,B000ZOT8FO,"This compilation of outtakes from Jackass 2 is strictly for the fanatical Jackass fan. I've always been an avid fan of the Jackass movies nad Wildboyz TV series but this is a waste of time. What you have is nearly two hours of outtakes that were considered too lame for Jackass 2--and they're still so lame and boring that you would think a grammar school kid had video taped the sequences. You're given scene after scene showing the Jackass cast and crew shrieking in uncontrollable laughter and hysteria as they watch themselves on screen. Then you're presented with endless talky interviews that one would expect to have found on the Jackass 2 DVD. What's strange is that the most popular cast member, Chris 'Party Boy' Pontius is giving absolutley nothing to do. You see him hiding behind his guitar, talking, talking. Much of the film emphasizes bare bottoms and which ones do they constantly use? Those of wee man and the 300 pound man.  They're enough to make you truly barf. In one scene, Johnny Knoxville puts the wee man over his lap and powders his bare rear. What was the point, except to watch Knoxville and the cast and crew nearly collapsing on the floor with hysteria. Even worse is the continual showing of the fat man's bare rump and the different things that are done to it. You really want to barf. Why couldn't they have used the rears of some of the better looking guys--like the Party Boy? There's also one sequence where Bam Mangera receives a prostate exam in a sex shop in Russia. Bam screams and hollars and convulses while this is being done--with one finger--until you'd think this guy has a tree trunk being used instead of a doctor's finger. You can only hope that Jackass 3 will be a hell of a lot more interesting than these boring, lame episodes that are all so boring and lame and worthless that I could barely get through to the end.",1200182400,2,1869,4.57910447761194
3277861,4,B000ZOT8FO,"I was a bit sceptical about this DVD when I ordered it. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to find that everything on it is new. Nothing from Jackass 2. It probably should have simply been included as extras on the Jackass 2 DVD, but I'm still okay with paying $20 for it because there is a lot of material here that any true fan is going to love. If I had to make a comparison, I would say that this DVD is a combination between the movie BORAT and the book THE DISTURBED WRITINGS OF ADAM COCHRAN.",1199923200,,500,4.164948453608248
3277862,2,B000ZOT8FO,"For die-hard fans of the Jackass and CKY crews, this provides some great commentary and clips that were left out of Jackass 2 -- however, there is a reason they were left out of the other movie ... they are pretty lame. Many of the clips are failed attempts or stunts gone wrong (not awesome 'wrong', rather didn't work at all).

For those who aren't as familiar with the crew and their antics, the stunts and skits in this video aren't that spectacular. If you haven't seen Jackass 2, I would suggest buying that and just watching the special features and added scenes from that DVD ... because that's pretty much what this entire video is ... sub-par content that should've been buried in the Jackass 2 special features.",1199491200,,722,4.596899224806202
3277863,1,B000ZOT8FO,"As a fan I hate to give a Jackass Dvd such a low rating but this is nothing but a way to make more money off fans that should have been given this material when they bought Jackass 2, and it's quite overpriced on top of that at $20.  This DVD is nothing but scenes that were too bad to be included in Jackass 2 and various people explaining why they were too bad or did not work as planned as an intro to each clip.  The only newly shot material on this DVD is the intro and outro of the movie which is nothing to look at it's just them all standing on stage and saying welcome to Jackass 2.5 basically.  This whole DVD could have been included with Jackass 2 as a couple extra minutes of deleted scenes, instead they chose to try and make another $20 off of us all by making us buy the movie twice.  You have already seen most of these scenes in the ending credits of Jackass 2 such as them on the driving range, wee man in the cooler with the watergun, and riding minibikes in the grocery store.  In all honesty there is nothing here that I will watch more than once since these scenes are all awful, and even for Jackass fans I cannot recommend this DVD unless you have money to burn.",1198800000,34,1187,4.07725321888412
