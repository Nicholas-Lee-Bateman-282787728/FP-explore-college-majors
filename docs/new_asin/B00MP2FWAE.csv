You'll see me singing in the choir with the afro & sparkling head band also playing the tambourine in our dance scene where we're wearing the gold choir robes!

6597546,1,B00MP2FWAE,I tried to watch this video but there was a message across the tv screen saying unauthorized content. Don't know what went wrong but I didn't/couldn't watch the video,1419465600,,166,4.758620689655173
6597574,4,B00MP2FWAE,"I'd give it 3.5 but at the risk of everyone low balling it, I'm giving it a 4. You really have to sit down and listen to the various messages in this movie. If you are a musician, lover of poetry,  or have a faith in God you'll understand what I'm saying when you watch. I rented it and watched it 3 times in that rental period.",1462665600,2,328,3.8955223880597014

6597577,5,B00MP2FWAE,"I saw this originally at the movie theatre, but I got it here so that my family could watch at Christmas. We really liked the URBANIZED version of the biblical story. The entire cast was perfectly chosen for their roles. We didn't include the children in our viewing (all under the age of 10) as there is some language, but the music in this movie is FANTASTIC. I'm not sure what part of this is the Extended version though- it looked and sounded the exact same as the version I saw in the movie. I also purchased the soundtrack.",1452038400,,529,4.353535353535354

6597581,5,B00MP2FWAE,This movie took my breath away! It was the most spiritual heart warming realistic movie ever! I pray the people in the movie have some relationship  with God because to play those roles without it is unbelievable! The world needs more movies like this to wake up society to how important it is to have a relationship with God first and a loving stable family life with both parents being positive spiritual role models for their children! Thanks so much!,1428969600,4,454,4.675
