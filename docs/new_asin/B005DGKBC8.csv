4659765,4,B005DGKBC8,"Man From Atlantis was a show I half-remembered from my childhood. I loved it as a kid but I found it a little difficult to watch as an adult. If nothing else, watching these DVDs showed me how much live video feed has helped the production of television shows and films. I could not help but shake my head when the water tank Patrick Duffy's character was in clearly showed water stains on the outside of the glass when he was supposed to be in the ocean, or the scurrying fin of one of his support divers who was not supposed to be there, or an underwater light showing up on-camera, or the blatant continuity glitches between wet hair/dry hair and so on. In modern filming, many of these problems could have been caught during filming with the help of live video feeds rather than having to wait until the film was processed -- when time and money restrictions caused them to become permanent goofs. As a child, I marvelled at Duffy's amazing (and changing) eye colors because I didn't know f/x lenses existed. As an adult, I see how bloodshoot his eyes are and respect what he endured with those glass contacts. As a child, the silliness of the plots and the sometimes wooden acting never bothered me. As an adult, it makes me chuckle that I could have ever been so naive. Still, there were moments when I was pleasantly surprised by the acting, a humorous line in the dialogue, the hint of an unexpected depth in a message(that may or may not have been deliberate), Mr. Duffy's endurance of eyes and lungs, and, for the era, the quality of the transfer to DVD for both sound and video. Also in the plus column was the ability to wistfully admire the handsome Mr. Duffy's lean, young, authentic swimmer's body forever captured at the height of his prime and the fact that, to this day, in the rare times I go for a swim, I STILL occasionally use the undulating body method of swimming underwater because it captured my imagination as a child and it actually does work as a means of propulsion.

In short, I'd have to call it enjoyable - though flawed - fluff from a bygone era.",1326240000,7,2080,4.459317585301838
4659766,5,B005DGKBC8,"Having the chance to see The Man From Atlantis again let alone own remastered copies of each movie as well as the TV series was everything a fan of the show could hope for. The quality of the programs being remastered is amazing and was even better than watching it on our color tv set we owened in the 70's. When watching the pilot movie I couldn't help but notice how easy it was to become totally sucked into the plot, acting, and concept. The pilot holds up very well compared to anything on tv today. The tv series spin off from the movies was never given the same attention to detail in quality when it came to the writing, but for me there are some moments from the TV series that I still remember fondly and most of the episodes are still fun to watch. A few I will always remember with a smile. A show that could have been so much more IS so much more now that it has been restored for fans like myself who always admired the child like kindness, fairness and sense of wonder that the character of Mark Harris as the Man From Atlantis seemed to live by. A friend from the ocean who simply cared about the environment and other beings whether they were a member of a different species or not. I highly recommend both sets for those who remember the series fondly, but most of all for anyone just looking for a good family fun show. I believe everyone should watch the pilot movie at least once. Yes, it was and is STILL that good....The Man From Atlantis was a hero for kids in the 70's, got as good or better ratings over seas (no pun intended) than Doctor Who, and in my opinion is still a hero worth a look. I challenge any fan of science fiction to watch the pilot episode and not want to see more. Patrick Duffy IS the Man From Atlantis!!!!",1324166400,3,1753,4.220238095238095

4659768,5,B005DGKBC8,"""The Man From Atlantis"" is the kind of ridiculous, yet entertaining, nonsense that Seventies network TV is justifiably famous for! Unlike its equally goofy contemporary, ""Wonder Woman,"" however, MFA is high-camp kitsch played with a totally straight face (especially by Patrick Duffy). In fact no one in the cast lets on that they are aware that they're involved in a show this cheap and dumb. And it's that very lack of awareness that makes up 95% of its charm. Seriously--on the quality scale, MFA is several notches below ""Jonny Quest"" and maybe a notch above ""Sigmund and the Sea Monsters.""

And I have to say that I much prefer the shorter 47 minute series episodes to the three 70 minute TV movies that preceded them (the original pilot movie was actually fairly high quality). The movies were no less ridiculous, but were considerably slower moving. The series episodes moves along at a much faster clip and therefore you aren't left with as much time to say to yourself ""this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen"" as you are when watching the movies.

But I mean that in a good way.",1321401600,3,1091,4.706806282722513
4659769,5,B005DGKBC8,"A trip through a time when fast editing didn't have to grab our attention,Patrick Duffy (DALLAS) gives a sensitive performance as the last survivor of Atlantis, Belinda Montgommery,is VERY WELL SUITED as the Doctor providing moral and emotional support for Mark Harris, perhaps a lesson for some of those in the Real World to emulate. My memories of this TV series are a little vague but non-the-less fond ones, my only critism is that the 13 part TV series has been sold seperatly. I feel this is missleading of Warner Archive to advise us that, it says, ""The complete TV series,"" so be advised when purchacing that item, it would certainly make more sence to release the 4 TV movies & Complete TV sereies as one package as other TV series have done.

The visual quality is a little impaired for the TV Movies, however, I think this adds to the nostalgia, and besides I grew up in the UK and watched it on a Black & White TV, when a teenager.

4659770,4,B005DGKBC8,its been a long time since i saw this show . in fact i was 11 in 1977. i was so glad wend amazon.com had it on dvd.if you like classic retro t.v shows then add this one to your collection. and the six million dollar man.they don't make t.v shows like these now days. money well spent. r.bonner.,1316822400,3,294,4.0
4659771,4,B005DGKBC8,"I have to commend Warner Archives for finally resurrecting this one-season tv-series for DVD release.  (They have also just released a separate DVD-set of the four ""Man From Atlantis"" tv-movies that aired a few months before the tv-series started).

First of all, the presentation of all 13 episodes on this tv-series set is perfect.  (The separate tv-movie set looks just as incredible).  I can't fault Warners for anything here.  All episodes are full-frame as originally filmed and aired.  There are four separate discs.  No extras, just the show, and that's totally fine.  Beautiful job all around.

Unfortunately, the 13 episodes of the tv-show are pretty standard generic action stuff from that era.  The earlier 4 tv-movies were much more interesting, but this is a rare show, and I love the 70's, so I'll even cut the tv-show version some slack even though it's pretty bland overall.  You know a tv-series is desperate when in its first short season it's already reverting to horrible oddball out-of-water stories including a western episode and a Romeo and Juliet take-off.  (I'm not kidding).  Seriously, who wants to watch a man from Atlantis garbed all out in Shakespeare attire?  Clearly, the writers were ALREADY scrambling to come up with new adventures every week and the show had just started!  You do get the great Victor Buono back as a recurring villain (he was in the first tv-movie) and that's always a plus.  There are also some other cool guest stars including Dee Wallace Stone (The Howling, Cujo, E.T.), Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Ted Neeley (Jesus Christ Superstar), Pernell Roberts, John Shea, Lisa Eilbacher, Rene Auberjonois, Ted Cassidy, Pat Morita, Richard Gautier, etc.  It's funny that the most fun episode (for me) is the last one, where Duffy ends up as a freak attraction at a carnival - and it features legendary liitle person Billy Barty, as well as the always terrific Sharon Farrell, so there are definitely lots of good character actors of the time in the series.  And, of course, Patrick Duffy strutting around in his tight yellow trunks.  Who's going to complain about that?!?!  I do have to mention, though, that his yellow trunks in the original 4 tv-movies were much briefer.  For the tv-series, they lengthened his trunks a bit, higher above the waist, and 5-6 inches at least further down the legs.  Still skintight, though, if that's what you're interested in.  :)

Overall, an excellent presentation of a rarely shown tv-series from the 70's.  Even though the prior 4 tv-movies did well in the ratings, the tv-series was a ratings bomb in the US and was canceled quickly with only these 13 episodes produced.  If you go in knowing what to expect, you can still have a good time with these, though.  It's sort of like the also one-season PLANET OF THE APES and LOGAN'S RUN tv-series - all were bad, but if you grew up in that era, they are SO WORTH watching today regardless.  Yes, the show isn't very good (and I'm being nice), but I'll still give it 4-stars for the retro-vibe and the excellent presentation.  If you're reading this, you most likely already remember the show from back then and will buy it regardless, just like I did.  So dive in!",1312848000,80,3194,4.828729281767956

4659774,5,B005DGKBC8,"Boy I am excited to finally see they may be coming out with good copies of this cult series with Dallas star Patrick Duffy a year before he became famous on Dallas. Young ,handsome, sexy and innocent made Duffy a hit in this sci fi series where he plays an amphibian possibly from Atlantis but he does not remember where he came from. Furnished with a fancy submarine the Cetation it kind be came a voyage to the bottom of the sea with Alan Fudge and Belinda Montgomery as the leads who deal with Mark every week and his missions. The four movies are great but when it became a series some of the episodes are just plain terrible but you must have them in your dvd collection like mine. There are some exception and a few episodes are nicely done. Duffy and his dolphin like humping the water swimming became his trademark. Please sign up for these movies so then the series will come out too. I can't wait. Just for trivia a similar character was invented on Irwin Allens City Beneath the Sea. His character had eye contacts, breathed underwater and even wore yellow shorts just like Duffy does in his series. They called in Agila in that movie.",1311724800,12,1146,4.436018957345971

Man From Atlantis: The Complete TV Movies Collection - The reason for the low review is that my first set I received had a bad 1st disc.  I am returning it and hope my second set will be good.

Man From Atlantis: Complete Television Series - I was very surprised to receive what seem to be properly manufactured pressed DVDs instead of DVD-R media for the Series Collection.  I had no issues with it in my players at all.

Both sets seem to have transfers that are really good, and the shows are still enjoyable when taken in the context set in the show.

4659789,3,B005DGKBC8,"Man From Atlantis: The Complete Television Series stars Patrick Duffy as a man who may be the last survivor of the lost continent of Atlantis. Dr. Elizabeth Merrill (Belinda Montgomery), a scientist working with the Navy, is called in to examine a mystery man who was found in the ocean. This man, who they name Mark Harris,  possesses webbed hands and feet and gill tissue which let him survive underwater indefinitely, and give him strength, speed, and stamina when submerged. Mark must remain in constant contact with water or weaken and eventually die. In other words, air is his Kryptonite. Mark has no memory of his life before being discovered, but decides to work with the Navy helping them with underwater research and rescue operations and confronting bad guys, such as the mysterious Mr. Schubert (Victor Buono), who tries to use the oceans resources to take over the world.

This show was produced during an era in which NBC was in ratings limbo. None of its shows clicked and the network began to take chances on anything that it thought would have a shot at success. Patrick Duffy was a charismatic lead, and the show treated the characters unusual powers seriously, unlike the cartoonish Batman of a few seasons earlier. The show had an interesting premise and a solid pilot but, largely because of a restrictive budget, tended to resort to tired stories with less-than-eye-popping special effects. Victor Buono was fun as the nutty Mr. Schubert, who turned up in several episodes, serving more as comic figure than serious threat to Mark. Other guest stars included Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Pernell Roberts, Rene Auberjonois, and Pat Morita.

Four made-for-TV movies about this character were shown during the 1976-1977 season, garnering very good ratings, which prompted NBC to put the show on its schedule for 1977-1978. It premiered on September 22, 197, but the rigors of producing weekly episodes became too daunting a task, and the series was canceled. Its last telecast was July 25, 1978.

Now, I have many shows from my youth that I fondly recall with nostalgia and this is one. I was 9 when this show was on and loved it. I didn't catch all the episodes so of course when I saw it on here I had to have it. Patrick Duffy is very likeable in this as he is in everything and so is Belinda Montgomery (I had and still have a crush on her). I know this was Patrick Duffy's ""big break"" and he went immediately into Dallas when this show was cancelled, so for him it worked out great. As for the episodes individually I will say that Shoot-Out At Land's End and Deadly Carnival are my favorites. Shoot Out for its use of a western/time travel aspect with absolutely no explanation of how it happened (plus it has the always great Pernell Roberts) and Deadly Carnival just because it is the most cohesive and well acted episode of the bunch (plus again it has Billy Barty doing a wonderful job as the bad guy). The other episodes range from weird to awful (but in a good way, you know). It has Victor Buono as an over-the-top villain in a few episodes, the guy who played Jesus Christ in Jesus Christ Superstar in a couple and in the absolutely worst episode of the series it has Pat Morita playing an Imp.

Patrick Duffy has an EXTRAORDINARY build & slim body as we see right off the bat in the Pilot TV MOVIE with admirable underwater scenes swimming ... and very handsome.

4659847,4,B005DGKBC8,"This is the entire television series as it aired from September 22, 1977 until their last episode on June 6, 1978.  It does NOT include the first 100-minute pilot (""The Man from Atlantis""), nor the second 60-minute pilot (""The Death Scouts""), nor the two subsequent features (""The Killer Spores"" and ""The Disappearances"").  Those have been released on a separate DVD set.

The first episode provides a short multi-scene flashback montage meant to orient the viewer, but it will likely just confuse most people unless they have seen the first three (which aren't included here). The episode continues the theme of the pilot, with Victor Buono playing the role of ""Mr. Schubert,"" a man living under the sea and determined to flood the world by melting the polar ice caps with microwaves.

In this 4-disc set, you'll receive all 13 series episodes, each of which is 60 minutes long. The quality is generally what you would expect from such an old show, but the technical aspects and special effects were excellent for their time, concurrent with ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" and ""The Bionic Woman,"" and predating ""Battlestar Gallactica"" by a full year.

Be sure and watch for actress Dee Wallace (from E.T. and Cujo) in a small cameo as ""Hot Dog Stand Owner""!",1407801600,5,1256,4.877934272300469

4659866,5,B005DGKBC8,"I saw several episodes of this when I was kid when the show was new and loved it. Suffice it to say; it got me excited about swimming and I had to hit the local public pool right after each episode and working on my dolphn-kick. AHAHAHAH!. It's great to finally see the whole series too. Yes! It's corny and no where near as violent as most T.V. shows are now. I think it's appropriate for kids to watch. I think a re-make should be done and DONE RIGHT! Just like the original show; paying attention to the problems of the sea and how much were connected/dependent on it is more than enough fuel for great scripts to be written.

I watched this series back to back with the greatest American Hero and Buck Rogers 1984 and loved seeing the same character actors throughout all 3 shows get face time for me re-recognize them. It's like a fun T.V time-machine. Good times. Anyways, for anyone who likes these older Sci-Fi programs; I recommend this DVD set. It's awesome!

4659885,5,B005DGKBC8,"This 2 disc set contains the very best of The Man From Atlantis - the quartet of TV movies.  Sadly, when it went to standard 50 minute episodes, the quality dropped and most of the episodes were - frankly - awful.

The opening pilot tells the story of a mysterious man, green eyed and with gills and webbed fingers, washed ashore and found by Navy doctor Elizabeth Merrill.  She realises he needs to immerse himself in water at regular intervals and may be the last survivor of Atlantis.  He learns to speak English and she gives him the name Mark Harris.  Mark agrees to undertake a mission for the Navy and this leads to his first encounter with the villainous Mr Schubert.

The pilot is well made and handles the concept with considerable skill, though I think some acknowledgement should have been made to Marvel Comics - the character isn't a million miles away from Prince Namor, the Submariner.  In the second movie, Elizabeth has left the Navy and has joined the Foundation For Oceanic Research, taking Mark with her.  This introduces CW Crawford, their boss, and Elizabeth's partner Miller Simon.  This latter character would be written out after the four movies.  We also encounter the submarine Cetacean and it's crew - though after the movies the crew would be replaced by a new one.

The 4 movies are all of a high standard and treat the concept seriously and intelligently.  This set is highly recommended, but venture into The Complete Television Series at your peril!",1344297600,2,1483,4.75

I was 9 & 10yo when the show aired so for me the DVD set is mainly just for nostalgia purposes... and it definitely is one of the good memories of childhood... For those who aren't buying it for the memories you must realize that it's a 1970's TV show; pre digital age special affects, simple plots where the good guy always beats the corny bad guy, family oriented television with minimal violence, pretty girls keeping their clothes on, basic morals...

8466793,3,B005DGKBC8,"There are only 13 episodes, which we originally watched with our kids. The show had a lot of promise and we were disappointed when it did not return for a full season. I believe it was a summer replacement, but I am not sure that was the case. Anyway, the shows explored some of the mythology surrounding an Atlantis and Greek culture and from that aspect, I really wish the show would have continued. I would classify this show as sort of science-fiction with a dash of mythology. A word about this set -- the image and sound quality of the shows are fine, but this is one of those ""on-demand"" sets, meaning that these are not pressed discs, but recorded on write-once media. The transfer quality is fine. Three stars for the media, but the shows themselves run closer to four stars.",1521763200,2,784,4.489510489510489

8466797,2,B005DGKBC8,"I remembered the series but not the stories. It's didn't bring back any felling of nostalgia. The set was cheesy. The scripts not that good, sometimes the pacing too slow. And, Duffy's character came across as way too naive. You'd think the guy had picked up a book or two and read up on life in the then 20th Century. I know this was before Google. The series was supposed to be about Harris and his crew investigating occurrences with the oceans. Hardly any of the scripts followed the premise. I mean parallel worlds that took place in the Old West, with aliens in white tights, and Romeo and Juliet. Come on! Plus the creatures were laughable. The Man O War was a man in a cheap costume, as was the two headed 'deadly seahorse.' Lastly, Victor Bruno's character was too laughable to be evil. If they had made him both evil and sarcastic, I would've liked him more. If they ever decide to reboot this series, hopefully they're have the money to create more realistic sets, use CGI and tell Mark Harris when he doesn't understand something, to Google.",1516233600,,1053,4.5473684210526315
8466798,1,B005DGKBC8,"The DVD case says ""complete television series"" but it's missing the pilot episode and the 3 episodes that follow.  Disk 1 starts with the episode ""Meltdown"", which is episode #5.  The picture quality feels like a transfer from video tape.  The disks themselves look like the DVD R/W you buy at the stores -- got that reddish tint to it.  There is something fishy about how it is made, and it is definitely not the same product that some of the good reviews are talking about.",1511827200,,475,4.488372093023256
