7890288,5,6305500576,"This is a funny golf movie.  The quality is not great, but it's old and cheap.  The kids are funny and some of really good golfers.",1379116800,,131,4.0
7890289,1,6305500576,"Don't waste your money, this movie is awful, not nearly the caliber of ""Caddyshack"" very childish and stupid. Don't buy this movie-you will regret it!",1314576000,2,150,5.04
7890290,5,6305500576,"This is a good family movie,one you can watch even if you don't like golf,(and I don't) its funny, with the right message to young people.",1261526400,,138,4.346153846153846
7890291,1,6305500576,"Firstly, the color quality was atrocious. I don't know if its a bad disc, or if somthings wrong with my PAL machine? Might not have read the NTSC format its in propperlly? But its the only DVD that has ever done it on my player. (its an all regioun DVD player, so yes, it does play regioun 1 DVD's fine) But even if the movie was presented in propper color.....
I was expecting it to be great, Tom Arnold, and National Lampoons....sounds great right? Too bad it wasn't :(
The movie has written on it ""its the mighty ducks meets caddyshack"" or somthing like that? But man, I think i chuckled once during the whole movie! it was completly predictable, not funny, useless things thrown in here and there, and just a plain awfull movie. Maybe a kid under the age of 10 might get somthing out of it? but I don't even know how this came to beeing bothered with to be put on DVD?",1085788800,2,872,4.259036144578313
7890292,3,6305500576,"I'm collecting any movie with National Lampoon in the title.  And really most of them are really stupid!  But this movie I would however rate average.  It's definately not one of my favorites, but it is funny, has a few drama moments and Tom Arnold is a pretty fair actor.  It's a family movie and you don't have to worry about your kids watching a horrible movie.  It teaches fairness, sportsmanship, and feeling good about yourself (even if you lose).  I just got done watching this film with my kids and they are watching it AGAIN!  I'm also not one to watch movies over and over, but I can say that I would watch this one at least twice a year.  GREAT FAMILY SHOW.",1078099200,4,668,4.330645161290323
7890293,2,6305500576,"This film is no more than a preachy after-school special in lowest vein of family fluff as ""Mighty  Ducks,"" ""Heavyweights,"" and countless others.  While those at least pretend to be real movies, GP  somehow manages to be worse in every aspect.  Scene changes seem crafted  for commercial breaks, the titular ""punks"" are a motley crew of  misfits who (as tradition dictates) couldn't act their way out of a citcom  parent trap, Arnold is dumbed down to play his ""Stupids""  character in earnest, and misguided attempts at slapstick would fail even  if the film had any credibility.  The soundtrack is the icing on the cake  (left out in the rain).  Basically, it consists of an alternation between a  Casio keyboard demonstration and a slackjawed old guy repeating ""we  all end up in a hole,"" forcing an especially bad pun down the viewer's  throat for the entire film.  The self-respecting viewer will not last  through the end.",961372800,2,927,4.877419354838709
