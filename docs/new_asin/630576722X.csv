7894003,5,630576722X,The Last Duel is the movie where he goes to death villa.  I have never seen dark skinned assassin but the one with the human meat pot is surely The Last Duel.,1338854400,2,158,3.9375

7894005,5,630576722X,I own dozens of martial arts films and The Last Duel is my very favorite.  I admit it is not a very good movie but there are just some things about it that make it tight.  The movie starts out with a desparate man in the desert who has been stalked and followed to the edges of nowhere by the relentless and invincible Si Man Qiao Si...,1201219200,3,336,4.0
7894006,2,630576722X,"the editing of the movie is very poor, jumping from scene to scene leaves the viewer lost.  The movie waste alot of time with corny scenes like the midget chasing around the fat guy for a long timea and there are alot scenes of flying around.  I could not bare watching the entire film.  i wasted 7.99 plus tax on this film.  skip it and get something better.",1168992000,,359,4.235294117647059
7894007,5,630576722X,"A dramatic masterpiece of staggering proportions, ""Dark Skin Assassin"" is a tour-de-force of the absurd, fueled by the fact that neither a dark-skinned person nor an assassin ever appears in the film.
Our hero, Seaman Chelsea, must travel to the mysterious Death Villa to escape his arch-rival, Liu Shao Fung.  Whilst there, he meets a fanciful array of characters, including a kindly spirit, a beautiful housekeeper, and a mysterious hooded host.
After a confrontation with the Villa's General, Chelsea becomes inveigled in a plot to destroy the Wudang School, spearheaded by Lao Dao Barge, his host at Death Villa.
Excitement ensues as ""Operation Thunder"" finds Chelsea and his allies facing off against a horde of foes.  Twists and turns aplenty ensure the action keeps a breakneck pace.
Also, there are noodles and meat.",1041033600,7,824,5.18796992481203
