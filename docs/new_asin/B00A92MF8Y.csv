5401289,4,B00A92MF8Y,"""Stitches"" is an Irish Comedy/Horror that I found to be more dark than funny. I actually didn't laugh one time now that I think about it but none the less I enjoyed ""Stitches"" for what it was. Ross Noble a real life comedian plays Stitches the clown a sloppy bad act that hosts kids birthday parties. This low budget but well put together under the radar gem of sorts had just the right amount of blood, gore and vengeance to satisfy this horror fan.

Stitches is running late to his next gig a birthday party full of bratty kids with bad intentions. He soon finds out every party isn't sunshine an rainbows as the kids prank him and by accident kill him. Many years later the kids (in their teens now) are at a late night high school party unaware that Stitches has risen from the grave to exact his revenge for their misdeeds.

Ross Noble does a pretty good job as Stitches but never once came off as funny, I'm sure some will find him amusing enough for a laugh or two but I didn't. I loved the creativity of the kill scenes and the whole clown mythos was pretty cool as well. Overall I enjoyed everything about ""Stitches"" and can say I will be adding this to my ever growing collection of horror films once released on dvd. As always I recommend you rent first, you never know you just might hate it!",1361491200,5,1304,4.318367346938776
5401320,3,B00A92MF8Y,"Pretty good movie with lots of gore and magic tricks but the whole clown scene was predictable. I already knew exactly what was gunna happen, it wasn't hard to figure out. I guess that is the only thing i didn't like about this movie.",1473206400,,234,4.340909090909091

5401322,5,B00A92MF8Y,"I saw this movie on Netflix ages ago, initially thought I would hate it.....Then I watched it and thought ""this is like the English version of IT by Stephen King"" except it's extremely sarcastic and obviously not trying to impress you or scare you, and I love that.....I really love campy horror movies that know they are campy and just want to entertain you one way or the other.",1471996800,,380,4.521739130434782

5401326,4,B00A92MF8Y,"The first 45 minutes or so was a bit slow but when Stitches starts dispatching the kids it really kicks in.

 Having been familiar with Ross Noble from his numerous appearances on Australian TV I was really interested to see how he would go as this killer clown with supernatural abilities and he does it pretty well.

 Watching it I couldn't help be reminded of Braindead with the OTT cartoonish gore and the director did say movies like that and Bad Taste were big influences for him. Some of the kills are quite inventive, gory but pretty silly none the less. It's quite a good looking film too very colourful and cool crystal clear slow motion shots reminiscent of Dredd 3D. Love the Irish accents too takes me back to The Commitments.

 I knew Stitches would be a good movie but probably didn't expect it to be as enjoyable as it was.",1463702400,,839,4.4868421052631575

There was nothing in this movie SCARY. The only thing scary about this movie is the DVD cover. All of the actors must have been picked up on a street corner. If they went to an acting school they should get a refund. This is not a HORROR movie, don't let the cover fool you. This movie is a comedy with gore that is not gory.

I only remember a couple funny scenes here & there especially the tricycle/bicycle chase scene. That was funny! The main thing that sticks in my mind are the kill scenes. They were just way too gory & over the top for me. I wished I would've skipped over the ice cream scoop/brain scene.

The fact that there were survivors was a letdown especially considering the ones left standing were no innocents and were just as responsible for the killers death as the other ACTUAL victims were.

I rooted for the killer and think the writers failed majority in regards to the fact that the body count should have been a LOT higher then it actually was.

The characters were also very annoying and unlikeable including the 2 main characters.

It started out with satisfying and twisted potential and ended as a massive fail.

Pathetic.",1426291200,,627,4.877358490566038

He's coming back to enact revenge on those now grown kids at a reunion party. It's suppose to be funny gore but was just cheap. Prosthetics and blood, all put you to sleep from boredom.

5401414,5,B00A92MF8Y,"Honestly, I went into it not expecting much. But that notion was quickly dispelled by the opening scene. Hahahaha! That was one of the best opening scenes! I just loved Stitches! Great one liners! I gotta remember one for future use: Anal time nazi tells me: ""You're late."" Me: ""Yeah...and You're (effin') ugly.""  Thanks from the very bottom of my 'always late' heart! His look was just perfect. The story is definitely a horror comedy. I am a horror fanatic, not so much comedy. The only other one I can think of that I loved is ""Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil"". And I went and bought that, after streaming it, just like I did with this one.

Besides Stitches morbid wit, the kill scenes were so creative (and definitely not interested in any kind of realism, duh) and hilarious. My only beef was with the meow. She was innocent! When will they (horror movie makers) get the hint that these scenes are not 1) scary or 2) funny! But still, it was obviously fake so....I won't hold it against them.

I wasn't familiar with Ross Noble so I googled him. He's a very successful standup comic. His comedy is very unique, so it's worth checking out (owl boobs, anyone? lol). Stitches was Ross' first movie. Great job! Thanks for the laughs. Its rare nowadays.",1390176000,,1247,4.558035714285714

If they did away with the gore and added more scares to the plotline they did have. it may have been worth watching.  But for now im sticking with the classic it.",1385337600,,458,4.170454545454546

Stitches (2012) **
D: Conor McMahon
C: Ross Noble, Tommy Knight, Shane Murray-Corcoran, Gemma-Leah Devereux, Thommas Kane Byrnes, Eoghan McQuinn
P: A clown (Noble) raises from the grave to seek revenge on a group of kids who were responsible for his death ten years earlier.

Creating a revenge based horror film is a tricky thing. On one hand, you have to be able to root for the person seeking out revenge against those that did them wrong. On the other hand, you have to at least be entertained by those that the character is seeking out revenge against, but you can't sympathize with those characters too much, otherwise the revenge is unsatisfying.

The problem with Stitches is that it's hard to root for this clown character seeking out revenge, because Noble's character comes across as too mean spirited. And it's hard to root against those that Noble's character is seeking revenge against, because the accident that resulted in the character's death was committed by a group of kids who were just messing around and didn't fully realize what they were doing.

Stitches is one of those films that must have seemed like a good idea as there are some clever ideas and the clown references are ingeniously integrated into the film. The film's flawed approach to the material results in a contemptible tone that bogs down the proceedings and takes away from what could have been a fun and entertaining film, a film that could have perhaps even been cult worthy companion to Killer Klowns from Outer Space. [R] 87 mins.",1384560000,,1609,4.882783882783883
5401423,5,B00A92MF8Y,"This movie is great. It is a combination of horror and comedy. If you are a die hard horror fan, then this movie may not be for you. But if you like the Child's Play genre, then this is right up your alley. It combines wit and humor with some horrific scenes. The violence in this movie is of the cartoon-ish nature. But when you look at the cover, how could it not be.

From the opening scene of the main character, Stitches, in full clown-attire, being with his lady, you know what type of movie it is going to be. She even says one of the most hilarious lines of the movie, but it cannot be repeated here. It involves what they are doing. Stitches then has to get ready to perform at a child's birthday party. When he arrives, he cannot do anything to impress the unruly kids. The kids are pretty monstrous at this party and eventually, not really a spoiler alert, they accidentally kill Stitches. The birthday boy is mortified as he sticks around for some more gruesome stuff. The boy, traumatized by the event, eventually goes to visit Stitches grave, when he comes across a ritual taking place amongst some other clowns. It is both creepy and funny at the same time. Who doesn't think clowns are creepy?

Fast forward some years, and now the kids from the party are now all in high school. There is the core 4, which includes the birthday boy, then there are 2 bullying punks, and the birthday boy's crush, who is now dating a musician. The birthday boy has an open house and decides to have a birthday party. At first it was supposed to be the main gang, but eventually, like any of teen movie, it ends up a raging house party. The birthday boy is still traumatized by the events he saw and now thinks he sees clowns everywhere.

The ritual that took place in the cemetery, now seems to have awoken Stitches, who is now bent on revenge. What takes place next, is a series of gruesome, yet comical revenge kills. Stitches wants to exact his revenge on the brats that got him killed. There is wit and humor with each kill and I am not going to give them all away, but at the party, the 80's song by Cutting Crew plays - ""I, almost died in your arms tonight""... and the movie cuts to Stitches holding a recent murder victim in his arms. Classic! Eventually the main character gets his crush and his best friend to believe him that Stitches has returned, but not before a few more humorous and sick deaths occur. I will just mention balloon animals and an umbrella. The umbrella scene was also very witty because it cuts between a scene where a couple are about to have sex and he throws the girl on his bed, and cuts to a scene of Stitches chasing a girl, and she ends up on a bed.

The main characters, figure out that the ritual done years ago, has something to do with Stitches resurrection. They set out to the cemetery to hopefully end Stitches' rebirth before its too late.

Most horror movies that involve comedy, don't pull over either. This movie is witty and dark at the same time. Like I said at the beginning, if you are a big fan of horror alone, then this might not be for you. If you like some comedy mixed with your horror, and done right, then you will enjoy this movie. I saw the preview of this movie on another horror movie I have and immediately thought of getting it. I was not disappointed.

Stitches is everything you could ask for in a Horror/Comedy It's entertaining, funny, gory and for the most just a great well made movie, it really delivers everything a Horror/Comedy stands for and is up there with the best of them if not on the top! It has Strong Bloody Violence And Gore, Sexual Content, Language, Drug And Alcohol Use-All Involving Teens and thats just what the MPAA R rating read's that right there should make you want to see it. The acting is great I've never seen a better Clown played so perfectly by anyone, Ross Noble aka Stitches is now up there near the top of the Clown ranks, Funnier then Krusty, More Dangerous than The Joker, Pennywise, ICP, and Pogo(Gacy) combined, and with a little help from viewers he'll be more famous than the Big Clown himself Ronald McDonald in no time.

I hope to see a sequel or two in the future, there's not many Teen Slasher Clown Horror Comedy's out there that are worth watching I'm glad to say I've seen this movie.",1372896000,,1102,4.477611940298507

I thought the direction in this movie was outstanding. One of the best I have seen. The lighting used and camera angles were top notch. The cinematography was beautiful. For the budget, it definitely worked.",1371772800,,508,4.414893617021277
5401451,5,B00A92MF8Y,"-Minor Spoilers- The film starts off campy with the clown ""Stitches"" going to the birthday party of 10 year old Tom. The kids at the party are bullies to the clown and a simple prank from the kids ends with the gory death of ""Stitches"". 6 years later Tom and the group of friends get back together for Toms 16 year old birthday party. Little do they know that ""Stitches"" has risen from the grave to get revenge.

I randomly stumbled across this gem one day at Best Buy and impulsively purchased it.  I had no idea what I was in for but I didn't have high expectations.  Little did I know this was one of the best modern indie horror movies!  Many are going to disagree strongly, but I feel this movie is in the league of cult horror classics such as ""Evil Dead"" , ""Brain Dead/Dead Alive"" , and slasher movies of the 1980s. The budget for this movie is low, and they still managed to make a horror movie better than most big budget movies released nationwide in the US.  The special effects are so indie and realistic at the same time. The jokes and humor of the movie made me laugh multiple times. The music is creepy and the soundtrack is awesome.  There is even a popular song from the 1980s used perfectly in a certain scene that is just fantastic! The gore effects were perfect and realistic. The acting was very believable.

Honestly during the opening scene I thought I was going to hate this movie. Then things got serious, while still maintaining the humor. Ross Noble, the British Comedian, plays ""Stitches"" the evil clown. His performance is what makes this movie work the most. I cannot get over how perfect and eerie his portrayal of the living dead clown was. It was iconic. It is in the league of Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger and Doug Bradley as Pinhead. I will even go as far as to say that it was the best clown performance since Stephen Kings ""It"". This movie will make you laugh and cringe. It will creep you out. The visuals are gorgeous for a film with this low of a budget. They need to make more horror movies like this. This movie could be the start of a modern horror icon franchise! ""Stitches"" can be added to the iconic villains list of Horror movies! I am disappointed at the low rating this movie has on IMDB. Hopefully through the years if word-of-mouth helps, this movie will become the Horror cult classic that it is meant to become!

Turn off the lights and watch this movie with friends or alone. You will have a good time.  Well worth a purchase or redbox rental if you like good campy horror movies in the vain of ""Evil Dead"" and the original ""Nightmare on Elmstreet"" movies.",1367625600,,2614,4.406639004149378
5401452,5,B00A92MF8Y,"This blew me away. Inventive kills, hilarious and very gory. This is old school horror. Ross noble was awesome. Heavily inspired from evil dead and 80`s slashers and crazy dialogue this film just works because its a labor of love to horror fans. Its genius. The pump air death is going down in history as the craziest death ever. Can't wait for the sequel.",1367539200,,356,4.578125
5401453,5,B00A92MF8Y,"Stitches is a fun little horror-comedy about a clown who comes back from the grave to get revenge on the kids responsible for his death several years back. Like most killer clown movies, it is colorful and upbeat. There's a whole lot of gore and many of the death scenes are imaginative and original. There are also some creepy moments with the killer clown prowling around a house where a party is taking place. I highly recommend this one to slasher fans, and fans of horror-comedies and clowns!",1367280000,2,497,4.659090909090909
5401454,5,B00A92MF8Y,"Stitches (Ross Noble) is a child's party clown. It doesn't take long for a group of sugar high rambunctious ten year old kids to kill him in a freak dishwasher accident. From ancient Druid/Egyptian clown ritual we know that a clown's spirit doesn't rest if he doesn't finish the party. Six years later, another birthday is held for Tommy (Tommy Knight) and our clown is back for revenge.

This was a fun film, reminding me of many of the 80's cult classics. The killer has personality. The slasher aspect is done in a diverse and enjoyable fashion. While the killing is going on, the film cuts to another scene that ""mirrors"" the situation. I love slasher film that have a little ""artistic"" value.

The special effects were cheap, Troma style by design to exemplify the clown aspect.

5401456,3,B00A92MF8Y,"Stitches is one of those movies where almost all of the funny scenes are in the preview.  The first ten minutes aren't bad.  The next 40-50 minutes drraaagggg by telling the depressing background story of the depressing life of the main non-clown character of the movie.  He's a picked on ,shy guy, virgin who has a secret love for a childhood friend whose with somebody else etc...

When Stitches the killer Clown finally appears its right around the one hour mark of the 90 minute film.  Stitches kills a bunch of children in various party clown themed ways.  Lots of blood.

There are some funny parts.  Most are in the preview, but there are one or two small or short scenes that are funny. Overall, I was a little disappointed and wouldnt buy the DVD or watch the movie again.",1366675200,3,781,4.5285714285714285

5401459,5,B00A92MF8Y,"STITCHES is the best horror/comedy in years.  Colin Mcmahon delivers an outrageously over the top movie that kept me entertained and chuckling, anxiously awaiting the next visual artistry and ridiculous but hilarious pun.  In addition to the shamefully grotesque murders, there are several scenes of creative genius.  For example, the hero Tommy pops a zit which becomes a sunny side-up egg and minutes later, his plate of breakfast food merges into the clown's face; the 80s pop hit I JUST DIED IN YOUR ARMS TONIGHT accompanies a brutal death scene and I laughed out loud when Stitches' bouncing nose faces a frisky housecat.  Everything about this movie is superbly crafted:  the 60s sounding music; a teen cast that actually look like teenagers;  its creative reworking of killer clowns movies and comic Russ Noble's gleefully demented Stitches.
In a genre overcome by found footage fiascos and pointless reboots, STITCHES is a welcome and entertaining change of pace.  Highly recommended.",1365897600,,992,5.2405063291139244
5401460,3,B00A92MF8Y,"SO for starters three and a half stars and not just three.
Three stars is what the average half competent low budget horror would typically rate at and this is marginally better then that so that's where the invisible half comes in.
When I first began watching this, and I mean like the first two minutes of run time, I was already kicking myself for picking out this low-budget POS.
But I gave it a chance knowing full well that a horrible, gory tragedy was about to occur and waited to see how that looked before giving up.
This isn't really a spoiler as it happens in the first five minutes of the movie but skip this if you like.
This bummy wretched clown goes to a birthday party where he was hired to entertain the kids, but before he gets there the mother at said party was placing dishes in the dishwasher and had just placed a large butcher knife handle first so the blade is pointed straight up.
After the movie plays for a few more moments you can already guess at what's gonna happen with that knife.
And that's when my overall opinion of this movie went up significantly.
The gore is the ridiculous type but done with lots of love. (I don't care how stupid that statement comes out because it's true)
The movie is mostly for showcasing teens getting killed in a few over the top methods that actually don't look half as bad as one would think.
It's campy, cheesy but it's one of those movies that knows what it is and doesn't try to be something else at any point.
Maybe not be for everyone but horror movie fanatics may want to check it out as it is better then one would think.",1365638400,2,1592,4.31

5401462,2,B00A92MF8Y,"""Stitches""  stars British standup comedian Ross Noble as a murderous kids' birthday party clown.  Years after a cruel kids' prank during a birthday party for 8-year-old Tommy (Tommy Knight) left third-rate clown Richard ""Stitches"" Grindle (Noble) dead on the kitchen floor, the childhood friends gather to plan a birthday bash to end all bashes.  But they haven't counted on the degenerate jester's rising from the grave to seek vengeance.  Now Tommy and his teenage friends are on the run from the undead jokester.

""Stitches"" follows a strict 80's slasher-flick formula with a houseful of attractive teens heading unwittingly into horrific violence and gruesome deaths.  Director Conor McMahon attempts to blend comedy and horror, a tough task in the best films.  But the laughs are few and far between, with the finale erupting into a chaotic hodgepodge of gore.

Bonus extras on this Blu-ray release include commentary with actor Ross Noble and director Conor McMahon, a making-of featurette, and bloopers.",1365379200,3,1010,5.3081761006289305

5401464,5,B00A92MF8Y,"Stitches is a near flawless Slasher /Comedy. An offering from Ireland All I can do is thank them.
Ross Noble as Stitches was joy to watch as was most of the cast, it was a great ensemble. If you like hard core gore and off the wall humor and ""did that really just happen"" moments you will love this film.
Stitches gets violently killed during a prank at a kids party. The kids were mean bratty and caused his death. Enter 6 years later when the kids that did this are in high school and Stitches rises from the dead to wreak havoc and make it rain blood at the party. What ensues next is one of the most enjoyable, hilarious and goriest slasher/Comedies I have seen in a very long time. The deaths are so fun and creative and the one liners are enough to make you lol,I say do yourself a favor and buy the blu ray or DVD,you will want to watch it again and again..",1364860800,3,864,4.118343195266272
5401465,4,B00A92MF8Y,"Comedian Ross Noble stars as Stitches the Clown. It begins with what will become Stitches last show as a child's birthday entertainer at a party for a bunch of children who are not thrilled with having a lame clown. When the children pull a prank on Stitches, Stictches meets his maker and dies at the birthday boys house. This traumatizes the birthday boy, and does further physiological damage to him when he see's a bunch of clowns preform a ritual for Stitches at the grave yard in a monastery. The clowns discover the boy is watching and warn him that when a clown dies during his performance, he will never rest, and return to finish the job, only the second time will not be so funny.

6 years later the kids have grown up into high school students and things have changed and they have moved on since the death of Stitches. All but the birthday boy who still see's day-mares of Stitches coming back to get them. The boys mother has gone away for the weekend, and it's his birthday again, so he plans to have a couple of close friends over for some drinks, only it spills out into an all out party where everyone shows up. Everyone, including Stitches who returns from the grave to seek revenge on those who played part in his death.

So, how does a movie about a clown returning from the dead play out when he comes back to kill kids? HILARIOUS! Even tho this is a sort of gory horror flick, the gore is fun, and so is the comedy that is inserted by Ross Noble as a back from the dead clown. The acting is decent on most of parts of the actors in this, the plot is OK, and the effects are pretty good. However it's the comedy that stands out the most in this horror comedy. It combines all elements and genre pretty good and tho this movie will probably never win any wards on a professional level, it is still a great film that I think anyone interested so far, or have seen the trailer and think that it may be worthy of seeing, you should love the film. I just wish I could get my wife to watch it, but she is scared poopieless of clowns. Which is a shame, cause otherwise I know she would have loved this.

This is definitely one of the best movies I have seen in a while, even tho it is shot in a way where it almost seems like they where shooting in the style of a typical made for teeny boppers viewing, but I have the feeling they did that on purpose so you wouldn't expect it to be a great film where a clown comes back and dismembers teenagers in a blood thirst for revenge and smart a$$ one liners.

Noble plays the part great. The birthday boy could have used a better haircut then the dorky look he has. He looks like the kid from E.T. Probably the only thing I would have changed in this film would be changing the character of the gay best friend. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against homosexuality... I just find it hard to beleive that a kid in highschool who looked like him, would act like him. I saw a kid acting, instead of believing this character would really exist. Also, their is a couple of bullies who I didn't quite beleive their roles either, but I suppose, you needed them as you expect they will be the first to meet Stitches return.

Give this movie at least a rental, and I'm sure you will not be disappointed if it sounds like your kind of movie so far.",1362700800,6,3294,4.222222222222222
