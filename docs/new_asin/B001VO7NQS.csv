8346640,5,B001VO7NQS,"Two young women, Shiyori and Aiko, drive out to an isolated Japanese village for what they think will be a relaxing time together. Little do they realize, however, that they have stumbled onto a village that has a long, ritualistic history of cutting the legs off young women. The two friends are separated from each other and suddenly find themselves in a terrifying struggle for survival. The story becomes incredibly unpredictable. The movie repeatedly jumps back and shows the same events and points in time from different perspectives. You will think that you know something only to have your knowledge crumble when the same event is shown from the perspective of a different character. The scenes of terror are mixed with periods of intense action and with off-beat moments of humor. The highlight of ""X-Cross"" is a crazy girl who runs around with a ginormous pair of scissors. I won't say anything more about this except that there is a scene in which Aiko fights this crazy girl using a chainsaw as her weapon of choice--the scene is so wild that it has to be seen to be believed! Two final comments: (1) While there is some blood (especially toward the end), this is NOT a blood splatter or slasher film. If you are looking for that kind of movie, then look elsewhere. (2) The story gets increasingly fantastical and crazy as it progresses, adding to its originality and unpredictability. Some may not like this. I, however, found ""X-Cross"" to be an insanely enjoyable movie!",1355788800,,1484,4.823529411764706

8346642,5,B001VO7NQS,"I recently saw this on an online Asian horror site and it was so much fun that I had to have my own copy.  It kind of sets itself up as a typical slasher film, but it has some neat twists and turns and tricks to keep you guessing, and by the time you realize what kind of movie it really is, you're hooked!  I can't really get into it without giving too much away, but if you like horror movies, if you're looking for something not too hard on the brains yet with enough hooks to keep you watching, this might be for you.  It's got some predictible spots, but I found them kind of a relief frankly, after some of the whacky stuff that goes on.  No nudity, though cute Japanese chicks as well as hot springs are involved, but there is a fair bit of gore, and a rather surprising amount of suspense.  You're gonna be played with until the very end, but I think you'll enjoy the ride, I sure did.  Thumbs & big toes, all up!",1261785600,10,921,4.060773480662983
