5392096,3,B00A7E8PA6,"Expectations are funny things.

Only a fool would have any about a rom-com which sees Hannah Montana playing an FBI agent under deep cover in a sorority house. Even a fool would set them lower when the title is as witless as ""So Undercover"", but he might adjust them marginally back upwards because the film also boasts&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Entourage/dp/B006GQM0UU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Entourage</a>'s Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven) and Ozzy Osbourne's daughter Kelly.

And, on these terms, So Undercover doesn't disappoint: it can't, really. It does, despite itself, surprise.

Rest assured there are plenty of forgettable jokes at the expense of stupid rich girls, and those one or two which find their mark raise chuckles rather than guffaws.

There were guffaws, though - I don't mind admitting I had a couple - and they came almost, but not quite, in spite of the script.

Sometimes plot developments were too absurd not to laugh, but director Tom Vaughan is knowing enough to realise this - the entire picture presents itself with a cheeky wink - so he deserves credit for them.

But mostly, So Undercover gets away through sheer bravura and energetic performances from likeable stars. Miley Cyrus, with whose oeuvre I'm not intimately familiar, has a whale of a time with the lead, as does Jeremy Piven, who seems not to act in any noticeable way at all: Arman, his character might as well be Ari Gold, who, I imagine, might as well be Jeremy Piven.

Elsewhere Joshua Bowman and Mike O'Malley lend such admirable support it's hard not to be badgered into liking this film.

One chap in the cinema even applauded, though I think that was a step too far.

5392097,5,B00A7E8PA6,"Miley Cyrus stars as Molly, a private investigator who chose to leave high school to work with her father (Mike O'Malley), a former police officer. Together their days are filled with busting cheating spouses and taking down petty thieves. However, her life unexpectedly changes when she is approached by an FBI agent (Jeremy Piven) to go undercover in the one place they're unable to infiltrate, and a world she knows nothing about... A university sorority. During a major makeover, Molly physically transforms herself from the tough, streetwise investigator, to a very affluent sorority girl Brooke Stonebridge. However, Molly also has to learn how to walk the walk and talk the talk to keep her cover for her mission: protect the life of sorority sister Alex Patrone (Lauren McKnight) whose father plans to testify against some very dangerous people. Surveillance proves nearly impossible for outsider Molly, who struggles to adjust to university culture, her new friends, and her new assignment, which includes Nicholas (Josh Bowman), a strong, self confident guy who may have taken a piece of Molly's heart, if only he weren't possibly the hit man in disguise. With multiple suspects on her list and the trial fast approaching, Molly must navigate a minefield of double crosses as well as the pageantry and chaos of a sorority sister's social life. Through her journey, Molly must protect Alex while discovering that not everyone is who he or she appears to be, including herself.

5392104,2,B00A7E8PA6,"The synopsis should have read ""Tough, streetwise detective proves totally inept at passing herself off as sorority girl, makes series of blunders in first two days on assignment that would have blown her cover in any sorority house not inhabited by utter simpletons.""

This film is actually a thinly disguised remake of the much more successful ""Miss Congeniality"" films, with a dash of ""Veronica Mars"" added.  The premise is workable, but the writers made a hash of it.  Miley Cyrus fans will ignore the movie's numerous deficiencies, and young men will generally ignore everything further off the floor than the female cast's lofty hemlines, so if you're in one of those categories, go ahead and watch.",1507075200,,704,5.051724137931035

5392140,4,B00A7E8PA6,"I unexpectedly came across the So Undercover movie and was glad to have done so. The character of  Molly Morris/Brook Stonebridge (Miley Cyrus) greatly enjoys her job as a private investigator. Molly Morris professionally works alongside her father Sam Morris (Mike O Malley) and the movie shows how evident it is that they have a healthy and strong father and daughter connection. However, even Morriss close connection with her father does not prepare her for an accidental meeting with Armon Ranford (Jeremy Priven).  Armon Ranford is aware of Molly Morriss talent and intends to recruit her for an important project involving a sorority consisting of multiple wealthy sorority females at a popular college somewhere in the American south.  In order to conduct her mission discreetly, Molly Morris is encouraged to pose as an undercover student transferring from the University of Hawaii. I admit that I would be receptive to the idea of seeing Miley Cyrus in future films.",1426291200,,976,5.1645569620253164

5392147,1,B00A7E8PA6,I do not see what anyone finds appealing about Miley Cyrus! I am under the impression that she is a vile person and she is not an actress.

5392183,2,B00A7E8PA6,"This movie appears to be an attempt to copy the Miss Congeniality movie that Sandra Bullock acted so well in, but it falls so short, it almost falls flat on its face.  The parts with originality, such as the twist near the end, are the redeeming aspects that give the movie a little something to enjoy.  I barely kept watching this movie, and only because I bought it and felt obligated to watch the entire thing, and also because I was bored and had some time.  I don't recommend this movie, even if you like Miley Cyrus.  She's not very convincing as a tough girl who's used to doing undercover jobs, and maybe this is because I've seen her as Hanna Montana in the past.  If you want to watch it, I'd say rent it, don't buy it.  Maybe you'll feel differently than me, but I felt like it was a bunch of slapstick scenes that have been used again and again tied together with an already used plot.",1373932800,,897,4.27810650887574

She was ""practically raised by the Dallas police force"" which gives her the superhuman skills and savvy of a woman far older. With her dad in a fix, Molly accepts a job from the FBI (Jeremy Piven) to protect a crime figure's daughter, Alex (Lauren McKnight) who may be a target.

Molly goes undercover aka ""Miss Congeniality"" and enters a sorority to get next to Alex. She doesn't quite fit in with this crowd of ""plastics"" which makes for the fun of the film. And of course Molly develops a love interest. The story has a nice twist too.

This is a fun film. The acting was a little cheesy by design. There is humor in the film, poking fun at the younger generation's language and mannerisms. Weak outtakes during the end credits. This is Miley Cyrus who is no Jennifer Lawrence and thankfully no Kristen Stewart. A film you can watch with your teen daughter and enjoy without feeling embarrassed during any scene.

5392234,2,B00A7E8PA6,"I just like seeing Miley. I think she cute and pretty. That's it. Everything else about this movie I hated. So, 2 stars.

This movie has a okay story line, but they really did't execute it well. There are many things they could had done to make this movie better than this. I did feel the script was good, but the direction wasn't there. Miley can act, but she is no martial artist. In this movie she supposed to be great at it, but she doesn't do anything! She never had a single fight and she only was in one conflict, where the guy was tied up already? BS!

What they needed to do, if they wanted to say how great a martial artist Miley was actually show it. To do that she would really had to train in it and made scenes where they can show some of it off...not a crazy amount, just a bit for someone not to say BS!!! But, NO! You get nothing! They could had even used stunt doubles and with good editing she would look like a Master or something, but NOOOO. Again, nothing was shown. All there was one punch and that's not really martial arts, it's one punch that any body can do and the guy was already tied up to a chair??? So, they shouldn't had even said that she was an amazing fighter.

Another thing is the whole love story of the movie. I didn't really feel the chemistry between the two actors. They needed to add in more scenes to make the two looked like they even liked each other.  That whole, I see him/her I'm in love moment, didn't even spark any chemistry and looked more like confusion. Then, scene after scene was just more of the same. It seemed like they rush everything and they just felt they show just throw in some goofy random encounters and that's just spell love. WRONG!!! Throw that fake/dumb stuff out of here.

This movie is basically made for teenagers and young kids. You won't like it very much, if you're some what educated and think little dumb blonde jokes are NOT really funny. You see it way too much in this movie.

And for all you people that write reviews that gave this movie 5 stars. I see your reviews. I think it's great. Add 1 or 2 sentences more and that's a review. BIG WHOA. No wonder you thought the movie was so worth 5 stars. BTW, I'm being sarcastic. I didn't like them at all. hahaha

I don't recommend this movie for anyone that has a brain...........but if you just like seeing Miley, she on the screen the whole time. So, I guess that makes it worth wild - 2 stars!",1362614400,2,2428,4.219827586206897

8547834,4,B00A7E8PA6,"RELEASED IN 2012 and directed by Tom Vaughan, ""So Undercover"" stars Miley Cyrus as a teen private investigator whos hired by an FBI agent (Jeremy Piven) to go undercover at a sorority. Mike O'Malley plays her dad, Josh Bowman her potential beau and Matthew Settle her professor.

This was my first exposure to Miley as an actress (Ive never seen Hanna Montana, for instance) and shes effective for this kind of role, a formidable no-nonsense detective with wit and feminine charisma. Im not a fan of hers in any sense, but shes easily the most all-around attractive female in the cast, which is saying a lot since the events take place at a sorority. Or perhaps its saying that the rest of the female cast is subpar as far as sex appeal goes. Other than that, they're all just fine. Bottom Line: This is a fun detective drama/adventure at a university highlighted by Cyrus as the protagonist; nothing more, but nothing less.

The movie runs 94 minutes and was shot entirely in Louisiana. Writers: Allan Loeb & Steven Pearl. ADDITIONAL CAST: Eloise Mumford (Sasha), Megan Park (Cotton), Lauren McKnight (Alex), Kelly Osbourne (Becky), Alexis Knapp (Taylor) and Morgan Calhoun (Hunter).

8547835,4,B00A7E8PA6,When I first figured out it was Cyrus in the role I was unsure but this turned out entertaining.  Not high class in story or acting but worth a non-expectation bit of time.,1513900800,,172,4.212121212121212
8547836,5,B00A7E8PA6,"I enjoy this movie for Jeremy Piven and having family ties to New Orleans/Tulane University. This movie stars Miley Cyrus who goes undercover as a student joining a sorority. It's a similar premise to Miss Congeniality. It's predictable and geared towards teens/college age IMO. Well cast and worth checking out for Miley or Jeremy or New Orleans. The third male lead, I forget his name, he was in the TV show Revenge.",1513555200,,418,4.819444444444445

8547839,4,B00A7E8PA6,"Despite the reputation of Miley Cyrus as an idiot ""twerker"", her acting in this film was actually entertaining.  Interesting script, competent casting, adequate photography and production called for a four star rating",1510963200,,217,5.78125
8547840,5,B00A7E8PA6,really good movie but probably only for teenagers,1510876800,,49,5.25
8547841,3,B00A7E8PA6,"For Cyrus fans & tween girls except for some reason they have Cyrus keep saying  ""balls"" & there is implied sex between college girls & much older men. O.K. movie but most adults will find it uninteresting.",1510790400,,206,4.5675675675675675
8547842,3,B00A7E8PA6,Not bad of a movie. Had good turns of events and good actors but storyline was ok.,1510444800,,82,3.8823529411764706
