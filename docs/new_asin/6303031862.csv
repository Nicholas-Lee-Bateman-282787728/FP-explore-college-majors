538624,4,6303031862,"CRYING FREEMAN: PORTRAIT OF A KILLER (1988) is the first of six Japanese anime volumes based on the manga (comic book) by Kazuo Koike and Ryoichi Ikegami about a handsome young sculptor who is forcibly recruited by the 108 Dragons, an ancient organization of Chinese assassins. We see him trained as an assassin and programmed to kill on their orders. His uncontrolled stream of tears after each killing and his yearning to be free give him the name, Crying Freeman.
Things get complicated when Freeman is forced to undertake the elimination of a witness to one of his killings. She is a beautiful, lonely, single Japanese woman and, like Freeman, an accomplished artist. They recognize each other as soul mates and he risks his lifeand hersto convince the organization of her value to him.
This 52-minute animated production is almost a perfect adaptation of the manga story and stands out as the best of the CRYING FREEMAN animated series. The dramatic mood and visual elegance of the black-and-white drawings are surprisingly well-captured by the anime, despite the bright colors and lighting. Daisuke Nishio, the anime director, knows how to pace a scene and establish the proper sense of time and place. It helps that Ikegamis drawings and his sense of cutting and composition are so astutely cinematic in the first place.
The Crying Freeman manga is notable for its high doses of nudity, near-pornographic sex and extremely bloody violence. The anime doesnt stint on these elements either, although it takes great pains to stay within R-rated limits. However, the sheer beauty of their presentation here may win over otherwise hesitant viewers, while fully satisfying the already jaded fans of more hard-edged anime.
The ""Crying Freeman"" manga has also been adapted, considerably less faithfully, into two live-action films, CRYING FREEMAN (France, 1995), directed by Christophe Gans (BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF) and starring Mark Dacascos, and KILLERS ROMANCE (Hong Kong, 1990), starring Simon Yam and Joey Wang.",1029888000,12,2016,5.206153846153846

538742,4,6303031862,When I was younger I used to watch the the Crying Freeman anime which I enjoyed very much. When I discovered that this movie existed I had to have it. The movie is suprisingly good but does not quite stack up to the anime. It was very entertaining to watch.,1257724800,,257,4.16
538743,3,6303031862,"(About the DVD: This all-region release will play on North American DVD players, but with questionable picture quality. There is only one audio track - English with portions of Japanese - but both Cantonese and (bad) English subtitles are included. The Japanese bits do not feature automatic subtitles, so these must be turned on manually. There are no special features.)

The story: when a lethal assassin known as the Freeman (Mark Dacascos,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brotherhood-of-the-Wolf/dp/B00006ADEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brotherhood of the Wolf</a>) is seen killing members of the Yakuza by a beautiful artist named Emu (Julie Condra,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eerie-Indiana/dp/B00062WUQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eerie, Indiana</a>), her survival depends on their mutual affections for each other, amidst a Yakuza clan war instigated by a power-hungry rogue (Masaya Kato,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drive/dp/B0000ZG040/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drive</a>).

Knowing the genre of ""Crying Freeman"" is a necessity before watching, lest you end up potentially disappointed. Basically, it's an action-drama with about three or four times more emphasis on drama than action. In the span of 102 minutes, there are only two shootouts and one martial arts/swordfight scene of any consistency. There are a few assassination scenes placed throughout the rest of the movie, but these are generally quick and can't really count towards the overall. No matter how good the rest of the film may be, I personally was unable to get over how underutilized the talents of martial arts champion Dacascos were: what's there is good, but it's not nearly enough for my taste and not very innovative.

Luckily, the rest of the movie is pretty good nonetheless, even though it struggles to find its pace. Director Christoph Gans may have coined a completely new genre here with his melding of drama, action, crime-thriller, and arthouse elements. Both he and cinematographer Thomas Burstyn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-4400/dp/B001CQONMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 4400</a>) deserve acclaim for how nice they made the movie to look at, with next to no aid from CGI. The dialogue gets a bit silly, although this may only seem the case because I am unfamiliar with the original manga. Disappointingly, the romance between Condra's and Dacascos' characters is 100% forced and unaccounted for: audiences are expected to assume that love can blossom from seeing a complete stranger put bullets through the heads of three other strangers and that this turns into sex mere hours later. Sure.

Dramatically, however, the film is in good hands: Dacascos fumbles a bit with his part, but he's successfully rescued by Condra. Byron Mann (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Street-Fighter/dp/B001L2ZSJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Street Fighter</a>) co-stars as the Freeman's guide, and Rae Dawn Chong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Commando/dp/B000GUJYI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Commando</a>) and Tcheky Karyo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiss-of-the-Dragon/dp/B00003CY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiss of the Dragon</a>) do well as police detectives of the opposite sides of the coin. Though his character's a bit boring, Masaya Kato is effectively cold-blooded, and Yoko Shimada (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Clavell-s-Shogun/dp/B0000A2ZNX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Clavell's Shogun</a>) makes an eventual strong showing as his ambitious wife. The amazing Mako (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Barbarian/dp/0783225768/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Barbarian</a>) has a small but important role, and performs as strongly as always even though he's a bit out of his element.

Despite having developed into a small-time cult favorite, I found next to nothing besides the film's art direction particularly remarkable. Even the absurd amount of slow motion is no longer the movie's own, thanks to the Wachoski Bros. I suppose I set my standards too high and expected more of an action movie along the lines of Dacascos' other films, but it simply doesn't hold up too impressively as anything other than an aesthetic exercise.",1241481600,,4530,6.844020797227037
538744,5,6303031862,i've been looking for this movie a long time and i love the live action one .just like the anime version . is there a sequel?.......buy it !~,1238716800,,141,4.071428571428571
538804,5,6303031862,"I preffer this version than the short anime serie because I saw the animated serie and it wasn't THAT good. :(
The animation was so-so, the graphics were not so inspiring, some of the characters looked stupid, the action was NOTHING great and the storyline was a little slow.

NOW THIS ONE! is the ""worth buying it"". There is SLOW-MO ACTION like in the John Woo films, FAST gun-fights, BIG explotions, good acting, GREAT martial arts movements and COOL one man army swordman scene!!! ;D
If you think that the story is more important then I recomend the anime version, but if you are looking for COOL FAST action then I recomend this one.

This movie have basically the same story as the animated serie but a little summarized.

About the dvd: The picture quality is very good but when the camera goes to ""close-up"" there are some brieff purple lights in the picture but is not THAT annoying, besides, it's only at the begining of the movie, the last best action scenes doesn't have that. The sound hears good but is low volume, so you have to turn up your tv volume to hear the sound much clearer.

Adios.",1226707200,2,1105,4.51
538805,3,6303031862,"I enjoyed the 5 graphic novels of Crying Freeman by Dark Horse. The animated movies were good but not as good as the graphic novels. This movie compared to the animated version and graphic novels is a disappointment.  It is disjointed and the actors left much to be desired. This movie is in English with Chinese subtitles. But there are portions of the movie were Chinese (Cantonese dialect) or Japanese is spoken only that was not background chatter, but dialogue that I think was important to the storyline and flow of the movie. These conversations leaves the movie viewer clueless unless he/she can understand or read Chinese or Japanese. The important scene where Freeman falls in love with Emu is weak and not convincing. The dialogue strayed from the graphic novel at that scene and it was disappointing because the script replacing it was poor. The acting in that scene was also disappointing.  As a stand alone movie, I rate this movie no more than three stars. As the first Crying Freeman movie, it is a disappointment.",1213228800,,1030,4.813559322033898
538806,5,6303031862,"My first exposure to Anime was VAMPIRE HUNTER D and then I saw the live action Guyver with Mark Hamill and I thought it was great, then I discovered The Animated Guyver and was blown away (In a good way I mean, not in the way that where they shoot somebody in the head and brains fly all over the wall). Then i saw Crying Freeman in the VHS and thought ""Hey, if I liked Vampire Hunter D and The Guyver I might as well check this out and was not disappointed. I love the whole flawed hero aspect as well as the fight scenes. A lot of people say it is important that in Hero sagas we need to see more of the Hero, I think ""Less is more"", if the hero is tragic they would be reclusive. That's what makes me feel for them. They are not going to pour their heart out to their friends and loved ones and no one wants to see someone p@#sing and moaning throughout the movie. You don't emathize with them, you want the villain to put them out of their misery so it doesn't want to make the audience commit Harry-Kari. This is why I ""Hated"" BATMAN BEGINS and loved Tim Burton's BATMAN.",1205971200,,1076,4.080188679245283
538807,3,6303031862,"I bought a French copy of this movie and was excited to view the scenes on the back cover showing beautiful cinematography and Matrix-like martial arts moves. There was none of this in the movie. Mind you, I went into this movie not knowing a thing of the Crying Freeman anime series. However as a movie, for its own worth, Crying Freeman is not particularly good. While the story is concrete, and follows through, it somehow feels disjointed and uneventful. To note, there is also a definite mid-90's feel of this movie, which makes it feel dated.  As for the actors, while the characters have the potential for great development (that is to say the whole Crying Freeman story is no doubt intriguing), I believe they are never fully realized.  The only thing of particular interest for me was a great title credit scene with a tattoo on the Crying Freeman coming alive. I was also happy to see a movie take place in the bright and airy San Fransisco.  For those language buffs, English and Japanese are spoken. And I do recall a Chinese language being spoken, though I may be mistaken.",1204502400,,1086,4.616580310880829
538808,1,6303031862,"I was VERY disappointed after watching this version of Crying Freeman!  I own the entire anime series and love that version very much, so was very eager to finally get to watch this one.  I was more than disappointed after viewing it.  For those of you who have seen and love the anime version you will understand what I mean if you ever decide to watch this one.  The only good parts about this version are the actor/actress that play Freeman and Emu.  I was told before watching that this was supposed to follow the anime version almost ver batum, and was sorely disappointed when I realized that was not the case.  Too many scenes in this version did not even follow the storyline of the anime version.  For those who do like this version, I appologize for my slamming, but I feel this version is total disrespect for the original anime.",1190419200,2,840,4.4868421052631575

538810,5,6303031862,"I am a fan of the jap-animation of crying freeman and I have to say that the live action film did not disappoint me.  the martial arts and gun fighting was awesome.  It followed the animation and i thought the people playing the characters did a very good job - - especially Mark Dacascos who protrayed Yoh/Freeman.  In case your wondering he played the bad guy in Cradle 2 the Grave with Jet Li - - and they have a really cool face off at the end of the movie.

I recommend Crying Freeman to people who are hardcore fans of the series.  If you're just looking to see some kung fu - - and you will see it in this movie, but then you'd have to put up with the few in between  slow parts as well - - for example, when Yoh does a flashback to explain how he became Crying Freeman.

I know that this film is not availbe in the U.S. but i think it's worth looking for.  I tried to find it in video stores but couldn't.  Therefore i turned to ebay to buy a copy.  You can get a copy relatively cheap - - but make sure that it's in english audio and/or have english subtitles.

I hope this review was helpful and enjoy the movie!!",1174953600,3,1123,4.013513513513513

7835133,5,6303031862,"If you're a fan of the source material this is an absolute treat! Watching interviews with director Christophe Ganz, he read the manga, watched the anime and pitched the idea of a live action film, and this was his first theatrical debut. It's extremely faithful to the source material with a lot of little differences that help it stand out. Decent performances, with Dicascos being the Freeman to Connery's Bond- the look and personality captured wonderfully by him even if it isn't the best performance. It's shot beautifully and has incredible action throughout the entire picture, plus one of the most classic 80s manga plots.

My only problem with the film is the portrayal of Emu. In the manga and anime she's very driven despite her self loathing, and after forming a bond with Freeman, her life changes around and she becomes more confident. The relationship between her and Freeman is as big a part of the original story as the action, and here it's handled poorly. You don't believe the characters are in love, and the two have no chemistry (strange as they married in real life after production).

All in all, a great movie for anyone to watch, but fans will also be very pleased! Don't expect A grade performances, but expect a faithful adaptation thats shot beautifully and full of great action!",1514160000,,1309,4.8133333333333335
