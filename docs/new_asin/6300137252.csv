8171633,3,6300137252,Unfortunately the copy that I received was fairly well beaten up and does not even remotely look as pristine as what was advertised.  VHS tape itself was clearly a video store copy w/ quite a few stickers & labels all over it.  Beginning of tape starts out a bit rough until auto-tracking kicks in.  Felt a bit like a bait and switch but it's on me that I didn't request more info before I purchased.  If I had seen real-time pictures of what it looked like I may have gone a different direction.  It does play all the way through w/out any dropouts and is just as I remember it from my childhood.,1459382400,,597,4.247787610619469
8171634,4,6300137252,As a child I used to watch this video over and over...I loved it.  ( I think mine might have been the old Beta-max if that tells you my age ) .  I have looked high and low for this video for my kids and finally found it on Amazon.  The sellers price was considerably cheeper than anyone else and even included a DVD copy with the VHS.  I am more than happy with it and cant thank him enough.  now my kids can enjoy it as well. GREAT PURCHASE!,1278979200,5,442,3.8666666666666667
8171635,4,6300137252,"Winds of change is a wonderful cartoon!  I do love the 5 mini stories in here, starting with the ""Wondermaker"" the main character of the five stories.  He starts as Perseus against Medusa, then Actaeon being turned into a deer, then Mercury in the tale of envy, Orpheus decending into Hades and Phaeton wreaking havoc with the sun gods chariot.  Definitily a entertaining, if not a bit dark, cartoon(Mind you this was made in 1979 and the music reflects that). Being only 82 minutes long it covers the basic myths very well.  I do recommend.",1155513600,,541,4.663157894736842
8171636,5,6300137252,"Winds of Change, AKA Metamorphosis, is a Sanrio film. Here's what bcdb.com says about it: Five Greek myths are integrated into one storyline, set to music, unified by a small character named Wondermaker. First, he is Perseus cutting off the head of Medusa, then Actaeon being turned into a deer for spying on the Goddess Diana as she bathes; the god Mercury in a tale of envy; Orpheus descending into Hades for his love, Eurydice; and finally Phaeton wreaking havoc with the sun god's chariot.",1106092800,11,493,4.811764705882353
