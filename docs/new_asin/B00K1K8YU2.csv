6398503,2,B00K1K8YU2,"Pretty terrible. Some of the worst acting ever recorded. There are creatures, guys infected by a virus and a ninja. Kind of confusing. Their objective was to open an equestrian camp. That probably won't happen for a while.",1440547200,,222,4.868421052631579

6398505,1,B00K1K8YU2,"Now I know why they waited until the end of the movie to show these ""creatures"".  I don't know why the main character was explaining to the police chief that they looked like people but more creature.  They looked like people who needed a major haircut and bath and who all wore these stupid black hoodies with these masks covering their face and squealing like pigs.  I don't know about everyone else but there is nothing scary about that.  It barely had a story line, most of it or if all of it was not explained until the end and even that was poor.  I think the movie would have been scarier if they just used killer pigs!",1440115200,,626,4.271186440677966

6398507,3,B00K1K8YU2,"Pretty slow boring movie. you think it's going to get good, but then it just flounders. Some nice tittie scenes that surprise you, but again cheesy as ever. Just a B movie, but I've seen way worse. The girls were pretty cute, so that helps.

6398509,3,B00K1K8YU2,"Well done. Acting was good. Cinematography was very good. Good director. Overall, a very well done movie. Not a lot of gore but had some very good holy crap's. I like this film and will probably watch it again to pick up anything I missed the first watch. If you enjoy a movie that is not overly done with a good sense of tension you should like it.",1438387200,,349,4.147058823529412

6398513,2,B00K1K8YU2,Definitely a B movie.  Very reminiscent of a campy 80s horror flick.  The acting is poor.  The characters are so unlikable I was rooting for the monsters.,1435363200,,154,4.62962962962963

6398516,3,B00K1K8YU2,"Imagine if the people from infomercials were real, they would be the characters in this movie.  This movie is done so hilariously bad that I couldn't look away.  Almost every scene was full of inconsistencies and mistakes and the ones that weren't made little to no sense.

6398521,4,B00K1K8YU2,"Think the other reviewrs expect gore and guts galore.  My gen appreciates the tension of the unknown presence, the thing you can't quite make out!  To me that makes for a much improved story and this one played on the inner fears within those of us who aren't hooked on drugs like meth and don't like cheap thrills like in your face bloody scenes.",1420502400,,347,4.40625

6398536,2,B00K1K8YU2,"This is also known as ""Serenity Farm"". I understand the 3 Tunnels but the ""2 Hell"" doesn't make any sense.

Jack (Richard Gabai from ""Assault of the Party Nerds) has a big ""L"" on his forehead as his girlfriend (Samantha Cutaran  of ""Seven Psychopaths) walks out to get them both acting lessons. Jack gets a letter inviting him to something in Washington State. On a whim, he flies from California to Washington with money he doesn't have and discovers he has inherited Serenity Island, from a rich uncle he didn't know existed.

The will stipulates Jack must run a child's equestrian camp in order to inherit  the island worth millions to property developers. Needless to say there is a building on the island no one has ever known about housing creatures which may look like the ones on the cover.

This is another version of the cabin in the woods scenario. It wasn't half bad, but then again, I wouldn't call it half good either. Makes for an okay free rental with low expectations.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Ronee Collins, Andrea Jordan, and Kasandra Bandfield)",1406332800,4,1077,4.763440860215054
6398537,1,B00K1K8YU2,This was a great storyline but very poor acting. The reality of the story line was great- but the zombie part was a loss for me. I like the classic zombie style and it is a constant consideration with the development of super bugs and possible germ and biological warfare. I will wait for the next film- and hopefully is will be better than this one.,1406246400,,350,4.318181818181818
6398538,1,B00K1K8YU2,Wow. Terrible movie. Very poor. I could do better with literally no training. Entire scenes happen with no lead up to what is going on. People get their arm bitten off and don't even scream. They just look at it like a can of beans they are considering buying. Weird. Just pathetic. I have nothing else to say.,1405209600,8,310,4.362068965517241
8655186,5,B00K1K8YU2,"This is the most interesting movie ever made. I was left with so many unanswered questions. Did a human being make this? A functional human being? With eyes? And Ears? Were they able to speak? What happened to them? Why are they like this? What is a normal day like for the creator of this film? I seriously want to know.

New fields of science should be created and devoted to the study of this movie, to prevent this from happening again. How could all of it possibly go so wrong? Will any of the people involved ever live functional lives again after this?

If you enjoy being traumatized by confusing camera work, bad effects, blue filter night, terrible writing, and even worse acting, then you, like us, will enjoy this movie. If you're looking for anything other than cinematic cancer, run far, far away.",1530835200,,811,4.586206896551724
8655187,1,B00K1K8YU2,"In the beginning a musician named Jack argues with his wife in their apartment.  She thinks Jack's the immature type who will be out on the streets if he doesn't grow up and look beyond his musician dreams.  The next scene shows two prisoners handcuffed together running through the woods until they see a door.  When they walk through the first prisoner enters just fine, but the second apparently isn't allowed in since his arm get ripped off by something monstrous.  We find out Jack inherits the Victor Borough's estate from his uncle, which is a serenity farm and idol on an island covered in woods.  There's conditions to living here however.  He has to run a camp for kids and adults (and horses too apparently, even though horses weren't mentioned and yet Jack somehow knew about them).

A young man comes by and takes Jack to the location.  Turns out these islands are worth millions to developers.  He recommends Jack not sign anything since he's getting a bad deal.  The lawyer asks for $15,000 but the farm is actually worth millions.  When Jack arrives to a convenience store the employee walks back inside the store after Jack leaves, makes a phone call and says ""Yeah he arrived"" in reference to Jack.

We see a hunter shooting black bears, then entering the same door where that prisoner had his arm ripped off earlier.  Back home Jack looks through items in the house and checks out the horse farm outside.  He meets a couple women and a guitar player.  The second guy looks like Paul from those ""Can you hear me now?"" commercials.  While Jack is meeting tons of people a guy dressed in leaves and vines runs out of the wood and fails miserably in his attempt at scaring them.  At night a guy approaches a woman changing her clothes.  She catches him in the act and punches his face.  A rich woman appears to Jack and his friend outside the next day.  She says her father is a reserve developer and recommends a golf course to compliment the horse track.  After she leaves Jack hilariously says her favorite event is the high horse, lol.

So far there's WAY too many characters and everything's a big mess.  As *another* woman tries to get all her belongings out of her bags the car drives away before she's finished unloading.  That's how it appears at first, but it turns out she used to be Jack's girlfriend so she groans when she looks up and sees him.  Meanwhile the two female horse riders trade hateful remarks as they unload their horses.  The group sits around the campfire and argues.  A man and his girlfriend walk away from the group and find the place where the prisoner had his arm ripped off.  It was once a bomb shelter in case the Japanese attacked.

You can feel the love a man and his girlfriend have for each other!  When they go their separate ways inside the bomb shelter the girlfriend asks where her boyfriend went and calls him an a-ho (wow amazon won't even let me shorten it!) whereas the boyfriend asks where the girl went and calls her the wh word.  Meanwhile they roam around seeing dead bodies.  The woman is chased by wolves but the guy hears bats and gets attacked or eaten in the darkness.  When the woman is free outside she hears her boyfriend screaming but she's too occupied with a bottle of liquor she finds in the doorway and walks away saying ""Whatever"".

The snotty woman from earlier calls the kids brats and says she disciplines kids in her own way.  We see a horse riding through the woods and this is funny because we see it from the perspective of the horse.  The horse runs up to the people as they sit around a camp fire with blood on his side.  The people discuss what's going on here when someone in the group is missing.  They think crooked money hungry business men are playing games.  Jack goes at it with the one woman.  They wake up the next day in the horse barn.  Turns out this woman is Jack's ex-girlfriend.  She insists there's nothing between them... right after they slept with each other.  I guess she's right- while going at it there was nothing between them, lol.  The nearby horse poops and Jack says ""You got that right!""

The old guy Jack had a conversation with about owning this property appears in the woods.  He's now being a total jerk calling Jack an idiot.  He says Jack hasn't lived up to the conditions in the will so he's invading the property and woods.  Jack and his friend question if he's being set up.  Meanwhile two people behind Jack and his friend quickly run into their cars to hurry up and leave from something chasing them in the woods.  The old guy is now lost in the woods as Jack finds the leader of the camper mauled to death on the ground.  It's unresolved that we never see this old man again, so we don't know what happens to him.  Oh and LOL!  Jack's friend says someone needs proof of the pack leader's death, and cuts off a piece of the guys skin.  They run back to camp and tell the others to head back to the cabin, but the one girl is covered in blood and dies after throwing up.  Jack runs to the police station for help and says that the victims have been eaten.  He proves it by handing the cop a hand.  This gets the cops attention!

Meanwhile the campers find the bomb shelter.  They hear and smell something weird when they enter.  One guys says he's claustrophobic and turns cowardly.  A woman fights with a monster but all we see are their shadows dancing on the walls as she apparently stabs him.  Something then grabs her and takes her away.  Another man and woman fall in love and gaze into each other's eyes after they hear something.  Not an ideal romantic spot if you ask me!  They go at it while we see nudity and hear horrific hard rock music.  Another man and woman get lost and joke around about it.  This movie is clearly a light comedy now.  Not funny, but it tries to be.

We soon see a monster.  When Jack gets in a car a woman jumps in and says ""In the city it might be normal to go into a police station, talk of 3 murders, see creatures and pull out a human severed hand but around here that's unusual"".  She talks Jack into going with her to the woods since there's an arrest out for his arrest.  This is when the story doesn't make sense to me.  Victor's wife committed suicide after a mission before someone went AWOL.  There's no record of what they did or what happened to them.  Meanwhile the two people making out in the bomb shelter step on a woman's decapitated head and freak out.  The guy shoots a deformed looking monster in the bomb shelter to protect the others.  Jack meets an old man in a log cabin.  Jack and this woman show the old man the picture of the two Navy men in a photo that Jack found while searching the house on his first day of being there.

Back in the bomb shelter we hear growls and see body parts lying everywhere.  A monster is spotted by a guy chewing a woman apart, and this man is soon attacked by another man.  The old man shares his story.  There was a virus that affected either his or the man in his story's troops while being sent on a top secret mission, but before they found a way to use the virus on the enemy and find immunity the Civil War broke out and the virus was air raided.  The old man goes over the symptoms- the itching and coughing up blood, liquefying one's blood, ripping the flesh down to the bone/ripping one's self apart while laughing.  There's quite the mouthful of information after this courtesy of the old man.  It's too much to follow.  It comes out of left field and most of the information doesn't play a role in the movie's story so it all seems unnecessary.  Basically Victor and his men were starving so they went to hunt for meat, and many of them were affected by the virus.  Some of them lived, some didn't.

Back in the bomb shelter the men and women continue tripping over body parts.  Meanwhile Jack and the woman take a boat ride.  In the bomb shelter the characters run from the deformed monsters.  They find a water area and jump in, but one man suffocates on something and drowns.  He probably swallowed one of those pesky water spiders.  Jack and the woman enter the bomb shelter.  They slowly walk the hallways holding a gun forward preparing for anything.  The woman shoots one monster and he releases a sound similar to an angry pig.  It's really silly.  They find a man with a broken leg.  When they leave the shelter they're greeted by a man holding a shotgun.  You can tell he's affected by the virus.  He says ""Kill me"" but Jack won't do it so he shoots himself.  There's still a woman trapped in the bomb shelter.  We see a shadow and afterwards the monster eats her.

Boy I flat out hated this movie.  It's not even bad in a way I can make fun of.  It has angry and unlikable characters.  In fact it has WAY too many characters overall.  Everyone just hates on each other for no logical reason (well besides the ex-girlfriend and Jack).  No time was devoted to make these characters stand out in any way.  The movie's completely messy with very little direction to speak of in both the characters and the way the writers try to do too much at once.  Why did that horse have blood on his side again?  What happened to that old man who was lost in the woods?  What happened to Jack's friend?

The movie turns really corny when showing the deformed monsters in the bomb shelter and the way the characters are attacked.  Almost makes me think this is a horror movie intended for a younger crowd given how mediocre it is.  There's hardly any suspense as a result.  Even when the characters run through the woods or the bomb shelter... no suspense.  This doesn't make sense since monsters are roaming around here and making noises all over.  The writing just makes the monsters feel like they're a big joke since the characters hardly show any fear.  The worst part is that the story tries to turn complex with the virus information but it's too much for such a poorly written small story.  The movie tries to be funny at times but it doesn't work.  The soundtrack's complete hard rock rubbish.  Horrible in every way.",1500249600,,10053,4.3914223669923995
