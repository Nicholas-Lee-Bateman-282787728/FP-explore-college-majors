But my copy did not have G string Vampire it did however have another film called Vampire Queen which was fine in all as it has the hot Suzi Lorraine more than Ive ever seen but I see some reviews of G string vampire on some purchases was I the only one to not get this film?",1492214400,,357,3.8767123287671232
8264834,4,B00175GAGK,"Given that I bought this for the nudity and sex rather than anything related to horror, I was pretty pleased with the purchase. It's about as cheaply produced at is possibly could be (like on an early '90s Handicam), but it doesn't take a big budget to show the goods. Oh BTW, this might be a ""triple feature,"" but you aren't getting three feature-length films. Stitch all three together and you might have one feature-length film, but each of these runs from about 30 minutes to an hour.",1461888000,,488,4.556818181818182
8264835,2,B00175GAGK,The picture quality on the first movie was bad. I really expected more of this DVD.I do not recommend this DVD.,1272585600,3,111,4.333333333333333
8264836,4,B00175GAGK,"From the the 3 movies included, 'Muffy'  is the best. 'Hot vampire' is an viewable movie, good but too short. Finally, 'G-String' is bloody (may be that if you shake the DVD some blood may go to your face).

Anyway the triple feaure has your value, and you will not be desapointed if you like erotic horror movies.",1232755200,6,314,4.396551724137931
