8265154,5,B001776M98,"Be clear about what this is before you purchase it:  this is a Pilates trap table video designed for use with Ellen Croft's Supreme Pilates home-use trap table manufactured by PYC Ltd in Shanghai.  (It's a little, Chinese-made trap table of black painted steel.  If you have a real trap table and California--meaning much more flexible--leg springs, you could also use this video.)

That said, this is a fairly basic, fairly standard Pilates trap table workout.  It says, ""Dynamic Sequencing"", but I didn't see any evidence of anything other than a good, basic Pilates trap table workout.  It goes through stretches with the push-through bar (Spine Stretch, Saw, and some variations), exercises with the leg springs used to do abdominal exercises like Coordination and the Criss-Cross, arm exercises like Rowing I and II, a ballet side-lying leg series done with springs attached to the legs, and work with the bar that attaches to the arm springs to do Chest Expansion and Knee stretch, with Rolldowns to finish. (More arm and abdominal exercises.)

Which is not to say there is anything wrong with it:  I really like this workout and Mari's teaching because she is a good teacher and has a good stage presence.  Pick this up if you like Pilates trap table Reformer workouts--I'm fairly sure it's no longer being manufactured.",1226361600,6,1327,4.968325791855204
