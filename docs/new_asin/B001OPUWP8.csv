8331188,3,B001OPUWP8,"This is a documentary about aspects of Paul Robeson's life.  Its focus on his fight for racial justice and his conflicts with the United States establishment.  The general video quality is watchable -- there are significant segments of old footage but even the newer material is grainy.  There are extended excerpts of Mr. Robeson singing.  Despite the technical flaws I found this to be a moving documentary -- however, though unintended, I came away from this documentary with a better understanding of why the United States would react as it did to Mr. Robeson's political involvement",1447200000,,587,5.083333333333333

8331190,5,B001OPUWP8,"I was expecting a recent documentary but this is apparently a re-release from the 80's/early 90's. Some grainy footage but then this mostly footage unavailable anywhere else and well worth seeing. And Robeson is tied in with MLK and Malcolm X footage and commentary as well as a critique from the always succinct Paul Robeson, Jr. on the then current civil rights leadership. All Robeson fans should see this. It is an important link in the restoration of his history and as it was released shortly after Duberman's seminal biography it is the first collegiate look at Robeson's political philosophy.  GREAT DVD!",1297900800,7,612,5.0
