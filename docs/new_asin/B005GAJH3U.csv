8471433,5,B005GAJH3U,"Had a Western Party and decided to give square dancing a try. Great DVD - we got a small group together to practice before the big event. It was so easy to follow and learn the basic moves. Once participant really got into it, took the DVD and put together his own music and calls for the party. It was a blast! We are planning another party just to finish off the steps in the DVD that we did not get around to doing!

Highly recommend this on if you are beginners like we were and know nothing at the start.",1383350400,,509,4.03960396039604

The colorful outfits make it simple to follow each couple in the demonstrations and the explanations of the calls are clear. Lots of fun for family and friends to have a great time at a reunion or birthday party, while getting exercise.",1322092800,3,390,4.835820895522388
