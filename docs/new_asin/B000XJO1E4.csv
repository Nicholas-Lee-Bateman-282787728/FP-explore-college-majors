8228636,1,B000XJO1E4,"I purchased this DVD to show Rabat to my family, as I will be going to study there for several months.  The production quality of this DVD was very poor.  The video quality is nearly unacceptable and the music is awful ""elevator"" style - just bland, generic music.  The DVD is only 25 minutes long and hardly covers the city at all.

It poorly describes a few of the historic sites, and does not discuss daily life, the modern city, or Moroccan people at all.  All of these things are necessary to illustrate what Morocco is really like for someone visiting.  I would strongly recommend you do not buy this video as it would be overpriced at half the cost.",1231545600,,656,4.425
