3011257,5,B000Y1FV2M,Mind boggling information on manipulation of The Word by those who didn't/don't really believe it anyway! ...beware - it may make you want to braid a whip to take to these men!,1313280000,,176,4.53125
3011258,5,B000Y1FV2M,"This book was purchased as a study guide for a co-op class.  I was amazed to see that the students, ages 11 - 16, were all very drawn in by the subject matter.  They even seemed to enjoy learning new words like relativism and sycretism and many more.  Although the book was written in the 70's the information is still very useful for today.  Our culture has been shaped by those that preceeded us so one must ask and answer the question, ""How should we then live"" within that culture?  Must read for anyone who seeks to be a doer and not just an observer in society.  Love this book!",1297555200,2,584,4.263636363636364

3011260,5,B000Y1FV2M,"Francis Schaeffer (1912-1984) was one of the great Christian thinkers of the 20th century. In 1977 he made this five hour documentary observing the history of Christianity and its influence on society as well as the impact of non-Christian values on society.  This two DVD set is divided up into 10 parts.  The first part starts  2000 years ago with the Roman Empire and moves forward to other influential periods such The Middle Ages, The Renaissance, The Reformation, The Scientific Age and the series finally works up to the era of The Age of Personal Peace and Affluence of the 1960s and The Age of Final Choices of the 1970s and beyond.

Schaeffer observes that Christianity recognizes that mankind was created in the image of a personal God and therefore mankind has meaning and as a result Christians worldwide live by a consistent and universal set of moral values.  When Christian consensus is removed from the laws and policy of  a given society, typically humanism fills that vacuum.

He defines humanism as man being autonomous - not answering to any higher authority.  The consequences of humanism is that within the society one person or a small group who will come forth as an authoritative elite and place arbitrary absolutes upon this society.  Humanism leads to arbitrary, variable sociological laws that are defined by what is perceived as good for society at a given moment.

Schaeffer makes some predictions that are chilling such as the future governments will not be led by a Hitler or a Stalin but by something much more subtle: a manipulative authoritative elite.  He warns that the media will manipulate how we view news events on TV and can be used by the government or the authoritative elite to convey their message.  He also expressed concern with the growing belief that government has the responsibility to solve every problem and also warned of the abuse of the judicial branch of the government by creating arbitrary laws through loose interpretations of the existing laws and Constitution.

In short, it's a must-see presentation to understand the Christian worldview and how that conflicts with relativistic views that are prevalent in today's and tomorrow's societies.  Schaeffer astutely points out that the ultimate solution for freedom, meaning and peace is for people to place their faith and trust in the finished work of Christ for their salvation and follow Christ as the supreme authority over every aspect of their lives just as was the case with the Christians of the first century.",1227139200,19,2529,4.9904761904761905

8230737,5,B000Y1FV2M,"A classic and a must see by every person who wants to understand the thread of Western history from the Roman Empire until the 1970's.  Thoughts produce words and actions which are recorded in history.  This work is the culmination of over 40 years of study.  I have not found any other review of history be so thorough and so accurate.  The conclusions which Schaeffer draws and states in the end are prophetic now that we have 35 years of history as a record to prove that his ascertations of our current dilemma in the USA were correct.  The unthinkable has now become thinkable due to the propogation of non-reason among the intellectual elite.  This is manifested most clearly in the continual dailiy use of contradictory terms, ideas proceeding from our leaders (regardless of party affiliations), it is seen in the apathy of the students and young people in the workforce, in the devaluation of life (babies and elderly), Common Core education, the devaluation of marraige and the familiy unit; and in the the struggles our White House has in defining simple terms such as ""terrorism"" as it relates to ISIL and the beheadings of americans on american soil after the first Satanic black mass in Oklahoma City.  Have words lost their meaning?  Francis Schaeffer correctly and accurately diagnosis the problem and points to the solution.  The pulse of a nation is revealed in its art, literature, music and ...now TV and Internet.  I would have to say the ""Trisome 18"" heart of western civilization, in general, and specifically the USA, is manifesting the arrythmias of its failing condition.",1427328000,,1597,4.903345724907063
8230738,5,B000Y1FV2M,"This wonderful video and book was remarkably insightful many years ago, but even more so today, as current news stories proclaim the open use of deception to manipulate the unthinking masses.  This is one of the most important books and videos of the past 50 years, and it should be required viewing and reading for everyone.  Even the music is illuminating!  I recommend it enthusiastically! As a man thinks, he is; his worldview will be his salvation or destruction.  Get the book and video!",1423612800,,493,4.833333333333333
