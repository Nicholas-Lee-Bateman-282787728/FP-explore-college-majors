Barry is very well versed in a lot of stuff...I loved his HVX Boot Camp as it worked great for me but this felt like he made a video just to make money. I found some books I am reading right now that are great and I am just doing what I can do.",1364688000,,474,3.787878787878788
8271854,5,B00194G1KY,"Even though I've been in the video production business for 20 years, I found this DVD to be very informative. Even some of the very basic information shared was eye-opening because they approach the subject matter from a different angle than I'm used to.
The content delivery is energetic and fun. Viewing this made me excited about experimenting with some of the new ideas presented in the lessons. Very cool.",1314921600,,410,4.871428571428571
8271855,5,B00194G1KY,"Excellent, pro ...and you learn with fun with Barry...I highly recommand this DVD for beginners in sound like me or independant filmmaker...there is nowhere you can find such a quality information",1293580800,,196,5.354838709677419

Film may be a visual medium, but since the invention of talkies Audio has become one of, if not, the most critical element in expert film making. And if audio is not one of your strong skills, then definitely pick up this video and you will take your films to the next level in terms of overall quality and professional believability.

I came into these videos with a fairly good grasp on the science of audio, but my practical knowledge especially as it relates to film was lacking. So I watched, and LISTENED, with great excitement to learn that I could expect to achieve above average results with gear that is more within my personal budget. And, of course, making these techniques a regular part of my process means that quality goes up that much more when my budget allows for even more professional and high-quality equipment.

I was ver pleased to see that this instructional DVD used various methods to demonstrate the information that was being delivered. And the thing that I probably liked the most was using the same scene to illustrate the problems and solutions and how they affected the overall sound. A scene was played out, and the sound was discussed, then played again with the described modifications put into place so you could HEAR the difference.

There are elements of audio and sound, particularly the science of it, that can get dull at times. By using a variety of demonstration techniques it kept my attention throughout the entire video. Also, having 3 distinct hosts, for specific portions of the video helped keep me drawn in as well.

The DVD is very well organized into categories that build on each other and also make it easy to find a specific topic for review in the future. It works fine to watch this from start to finish, as I just did, but it also works well as a reference material which allows you to look up an individual topic for review or to find a piece of needed technical information.

Barry Green is clear, well spoken and his content is well thought out and organized. He does a great job of delivering and keeping me drawn into the material. And, he threw in a few surprises as I didn't realize he was an actor on top of all his other skills. Was fun to watch him engaged in the ""skits"" that demonstrated the information.

Matt Gettemeir does an excellent job of explaining technical information in a clear, simple way without making it too simple. At times I felt he repeated some information unnecessarily, but then realized it was in another chapter and was important information in both, so when I go back later to review a particular chapter to get one piece of information I'll have all the information I need.

David Jimerson always does a great job of explaining the specific details involved in a post production environment. Being a Vegas editor myself I liked seeing the familiar editor in the examples, but liked that all the post information (including the screen grabs) were kept generic enough that they can be employed by any NLE out there now or in the future.

This is a fantastic product and if you intend to do any film making you need to get this and watch it. Even if you intend to bring on a sound recordist to do the on set audio portions for you, it would be a good idea to watch this so you know their job well enough that you can work together to make each other's lives much easier.

Shipping time was unbelievable. I actually received my copy 47 hours after I placed my order.

But the real kudos goes to the content. I learned so much in this video! Great job of delivering the information. Not just the delivery (which was awesome), but to the organization of it and content of the information. A well conceived dvd from start to finish, executed without flaw!

From the opening, my attention was grabbed and it never let go. Even during some of the ""drier"" moments, my attention was held. It was just so great to visually see the explanations. I even turned to my wife (who got wrapped up into this video while correcting papers) and said, if I had to read this, I'd be bored. Not so with the presentation.

And I learned so much... I finally understand the different cardioid patterns. I've seen them drawn out (those little heart-shaped figures) but I didn't really grasp them. In this video, the patterns are made clear and understandable as they are put into real-life examples with clever vfx. And I've heard the term Signal to Noise ratio but again... didn't quite grasp it. And the list goes on. (Obviously, I am not a sound guy! But, after this, I feel that I have such a better understanding.)

Hats off to Matt Gettemeier. That guy gave some great information that was explained in simple and easy to follow terms. I never felt confused or lost in his explanations and instruction. I thoroughly enjoyed his segments.

And I just have to say that Barry Green is one funny dude! I had no idea!!! I was cracking up out loud at his stuff. Funny, funny dude! And that Polar Pattern bit... I was just like, ""this guy is doing everything for this video!"" (Barry, I have always been a fan of yours but you now have another... my wife. She just loved you!) Seriously, Barry conducted this DVD with a sense of humor while delivering the goods. He, like Matt, provided information that was clear and understandable.

This is a MUST HAVE for any independent filmmaker making their way into this business. Even if you have no desire to ever be a sound engineer or boom op, you'll appreciate what duties and responsibilities lie in their departments. And even if you know everything there is to know about sound, you'll enjoy this dvd. Barry Green is a riot! The skits are awesome!

Lastly, this dvd is going to be watched by my next boom op. Obviously, I would love a ""real"" boom op but since I don't have one, my ""PA"" who ends up holding the big stick with the mic thingy on the end is going to watch a few selected chapters.

Really well done. David and Barry and Matt did an outstanding job putting this together. Worth every penny!

Thanks guys!",1210377600,5,2694,4.536082474226804
