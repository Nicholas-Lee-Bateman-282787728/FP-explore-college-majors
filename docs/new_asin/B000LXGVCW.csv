8164950,2,B000LXGVCW,"I came across this film by chance. Although made in 1999 its the same story line followed by Partition and Gadar. A Sikh rescues a Muslim younf woman during partition, fall in love, have a child. She is forced to return to Pakistan, he follows. Of the 3 films this is the most authentic in terms of being a punjabi film. Although this is supposed to be based on a true story unfortunately it doesn't represent the trauma that people went thru in partition. In terms of a fairly positive story its ok.",1234483200,,500,4.387096774193548
