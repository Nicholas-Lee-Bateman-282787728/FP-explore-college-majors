2060326,4,B00023P4F6,"As an avid fan I already own the entire NG series on DVD and this seems to be just a ploy to draw more money from Trek fans. However, since Paramount is doing this, and no doubt it will sell, why not also make a collection of the Borg episodes and include or offer alongside, the First Contact Movie.  So when the Voyager series is completed we can expect the Voyager-Borg collection as well.  The Borg, the aliens you love to hate!

If your don't own the series this is a good way to get a 'piece of the action' cheap.  The Inner Light is by far the best episode in this collection.",1097884800,2,583,4.132743362831858
2060327,4,B00023P4F6,"The Next Generation was a great series; and Patrick Stewart was the central person that brought such a quality to it. If he wasn't there for the first attempt at an offshoot series from the original series from the 60s .. who knows if Deep Space or Voyager would have ever been made; let alone the long run of The Next Generation.  Also the quality of stories was superior and one wonders if having access to Stewart allowed the writers the confidence to put quality material out there.
In any case; there are a number of great episodes packaged together at a REASONABLE price.  One hopes this will be the tip of the iceberg for these collections.  My FAVORITE Episode is The Drumhead; very timely given the time of its release around the ""Whitewater"" investigations.  The final 5 minutes of the episode is absolutely outstanding with a moral so strongly and convincingly explained.  I only have to look to my office or church to see this same danger is always ""waiting"" for the ""right atomosphere to florish"".  That episode alone is worth the price of the disc.
I watch the other episodes and they are also terrific.  The episode where the Captain feels his past was nothing to be proud of ... and he get to see the effects of not taking risks and playing it safe would have had on his life.  Really hard to watch episode, perhaps because it hits home to close.  Like so many, life has beaten me into not drawing attention.
Star Trek fans a wonder value, and great choice of episodes (they did not mix in any bad ones along side the good ones).",1093651200,9,1545,4.489285714285714
2060328,4,B00023P4F6,"For a Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) junkie like me, this sort of DVD collection is a rare and beautiful find indeed. For those who have appreciated TNG or even those who've found themselves curious about the follow up to the groundbreaking Star Trek of the sixties, this is a good buy as well. Containing seven episodes from the various seasons, the collection does a good job of showcasing the talents of the Shakespearean trained Patrick Stuart. Several of the episodes are among the best of the series: ""Sarek,"" where we witness Picard struggling against the effects of his mind-meld with the Vulcan Ambassador and father to Spock; ""The Drumhead,"" in which Picard must risk his career and reputation to derail an investigation turned witch-hunt on his own ship; ""Darmok,"" another superb episode, during which Picard must communicate with a race whose language is based on cultural metaphors and mythology; ""The Inner Light,"" one of the best TNG episodes according to TV Guide, follows Picard as he lives out an entire lifetime on a doomed planet, after coming under the control of a mysterious probe. Other less impressive but still enjoyable episodes include ""Family,"" ""The Big Goodbye,"" and ""Tapestry."" I would like to have seen ""Chain of Command Parts 1 & 2"" included instead of some of these less remarkable episodes, but all in all, this is a very good TNG collection. If you're a fan, don't let it pass you by!",1093392000,16,1426,4.872427983539095
2060329,4,B00023P4F6,": Repackaging ""Star Trek, The Next Generation"" around certain characters seems like a sharp marketing move on Paramount's part. There are certain episodes that appeal to more casual fans. The first in this set focuses on the central character Captain Jean -Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) with seven episodes culled from the show's seven seasons. Although it might have made better sense to go with a season highlights release or putting out a third disc with three or four additional episodes, we get this repackaging experiment with seven episodes and a documentary entitled ""From Here to Infinity"".

***

The episodes selected are a curious lot. I certainly would have gone for some very different episodes than some of the ones included here. ""The Big Goodbye"" has Picard and his crew trapped in a detective holonovel that goes very, very wrong. ""Sarek"" focuses on the father of Spock. He's suffering from a form of dementia which manifests itself as strong emotions deflected into others. Picard must help him gain control. ""Family"" focuses on the aftermath of the two part episode ""Best of Both Worlds"" where the Borg attack the Enterprise. Picard decides to spent some time with his brother at the family vineyard in France. He and his brother rekindle a feud that has been going on for some time. The inclusion of this episode, while great, becomes meaningless without ""Best of Both Worlds"" parts 1 & 2.

In ""The Drumhead"" Picard serves with a well known Star Fleet admiral on a committee looking for disloyal members of his crew. This powerful episode reflects the McCarthy era witch hunt for communists. Picard is transported by an alien that uses  metaphors to communicate of the Enterprise. They rematerialize on a world where the two must face an invisible foe. The Enterprise, meanwhile, must face off with the alien ship with Riker unsure if the aliens are testing Picard or trying to provoke war. Picard gets to investigate the road not taken in ""The Inner Light"". The Enterprise encounters a space probe that makes contact and knocks the Captain unconscious. When Picard awakens, he's living on a planet and is married with a son. It's not Earth and he's not sure what he's doing there. To the Enterprise crew Picard appears in a coma of some sort. In the powerful ""Tapestry"" Picard is wounded by terrorists while on a diplomatic mission. He awakens in what appears, at first to be the afterlife. It quickly turns out that he's been whisked away by his nemesis Q (John de Lancie). Q tells the Captain his artificial heart has failed. Q announces that he, Q, is God. To prove it he whisks the captain back through time to the turning points in his life including the fight that cost him his own heart. Q gives the Captain a chance to change history and, thus, survive but at a cost.

The four best by far are ""Darmok"" with the late great Paul Winfield in a guest role, ""Tapestry"" with John de Lancie, ""The Inner Light"" and ""Family"" which focuses as much on the psychological state of the captain as it does on the relationship he has with his brother. All are great choices. I would have gone with ""Best of Both Worlds"" parts 1 & 2 and ""Chain of Command"" parts 1 & 2 instead of ""The Drumhead"" and ""The Big Goodbye"".

I'm sure that if this sells well Paramount will release ""The Data Collection"", ""The Borg Collection"", ""The Q Collection""etc. although there's a limited amount of characters interesting enough to justify having more episodes. Certainly Worf's character would be of interest particularly with all the episodes of intrigue set on the Klingon homeworld written by Ronald D. Moore.

Picture quality is comparable to the boxed sets. In fact, some look as if they are from the same masters. The single extra is the documentary which is actually pretty good and almost worth the price of the this set by itself. The packaging is certainly less cumbersome than the season by season boxed sets. Personally, I think it would have made slightly better sense to have a ""Season Highlights"" focusing on the 10 or 12 best episodes per season or centered around story arcs. Perhaps we'll see that down the road as well.

A good marketing idea as there are lots of fans of the series that don't want to pony up (or can't afford $700) to own the episodes they want. There are certain seasons (1 & 2 for example) where a fan might want just a couple of key episodes for each. Packaging is pretty good. The digipak appears pretty sturdy. Regardless of your feelings about which episodes were best, this is a pretty good investment for fans although, again, I would have probably gone for a three disc set with more episodes (for example where is the marvelous action episode ""Starship Mine""?).",1092182400,35,4702,4.746634026927785
2060330,5,B00023P4F6,"Why would anyone complain that Paramount is releasing this set in addition the complete season sets. I love Star Trek! But like a lot of other people I find it hard to justify paying the prices Paramount charges for those sets, as great as those sets maybe (and I do hope to own all of them some day).  This sort of set is perfect for someone who wants to revisit Picard and company, but can't at the moment justify shelling out $600+ for the entire series. If you already own all the season sets for STNG and don't want to buy this set too that's fine.  But for me, and I suspect a lot of other Trekkies, this sort of set is an unexpected joy.  If another set is forthcoming, I'm betting it's Data, but I'm putting in my vote for Worf.",1091577600,,736,4.169014084507042
2060331,5,B00023P4F6,"I remember when ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" first premiered and ""TV Guide"" dismissed it as a show ""that baldly goes"" where one show, the original ""Star Trek,"" had gone before. They even cracked a joke about the show needing ""Spock plugs."" Several years later ""TV Guide"" named Patrick Stewart as its television actor of the decade of the 1990s. So it is not surprising that there would be a ""Star Trek: The New Generation - Jean-Luc Picard Collection."" The question is whether they picked the right seven episodes for this DVD set. Clearly the only caveat is that two-part episodes are not in the running, which eliminates the two parts of ""The Best of Both Worlds,"" ""Chain of Command,"" and ""All Good Things."" The answer to the question is, yes, they did an excellent job of selecting these seven episodes:

 ""The Big Goodbye"" (Written by Tracy Torme, Season 1: Episode 11) is the comic relief episode of the set, albeit by default. Captain Picard takes a break from the difficult preparations to give a proper greeting to the Jarada by doing a Dixon Hill holodeck adventure. Picard is joined by Data, Dr. Crusher, and the ship's historian, Whalen in the scenario set in 1941 San Francisco when the holodeck malfunctions trapping the quartet with the safety parameters off. Whalen is killed and Picard has to play the Dixon Hill role for real.

 ""Sarek"" (Story by Marc Cushman and Jake Jacobs, Teleplay by Peter S. Beagle, Season 3: Episode 23) has the Vulcan ambassador on a mission to establish relations between the Federation and the Legaran. However, Spock's father is suffering from Bendii Syndrome, a rare condition among Vulcans that is characterized by a loss of emotional control. To allow Sarek to fulfill his mission, Picard agrees to a mind-meld that will link their minds. While Sarek is able to use the captain's strength to successfully complete the negotiations, Picard endures a storm of emotions from Sarek as Stewart turns in a memorable performance.

 ""Family"" (Written by Ronald D. Moore, Season 4: Episode 2) is the coda to ""Best of Both Worlds, Part 2."" All of the plot lines have to do with the title, with Worf's adoptive human parents visiting the ""Enterprise"" and Beverly Crusher finding a message from her dead husband for Wesley. But the key storyline is Picard visiting the family vineyard in France and encountering his older brother, Robert. Seriously considering a job offer on Earth, the brothers end up fighting and Picard finally breaks down over the guilt he feels for not being able to stop the Borg from controlling him.

 ""The Drumhead"" (Written by Jeri Taylor, Season 4: Episode 21) is the weakest of the episodes selected although it does offer Stewart going up against guest star Jean Simmons as Admiral Satie, who is engaging in a witch hunt looking for a traitor. This is essentially a courtroom drama where Satie finally crosses the line and accuses Picard of being the traitor. A solid episode, but nothing special, especially compared to the next two episodes in the collection.

 ""Darmok"" (Story by Philip Lazebnik and Joe Menosky, Teleplay by Menosky, Season 5: Episode 2) is a personal favorite. The ""Enterprise"" encounters the Children of Tama, a race whose language is considered incomprehensible. Dathon (Paul Winfield), the captain of the Tamarians beams down himself and Picard to the planet below. There the two learn to communicate and fight a monster together. It turns out the Tamarian language is based on metaphor, communicating by example, and the final two scenes of the episode provide emotional examples of how well Picard has learned this language.

 ""The Inner Light"" (Story by Morgan Gendel, Teleplay by Gendel and Peter Allan Fields, Season 5: Episode 25) is the center square on this bingo card, considered by most fans to be Stewart's finest episode. An alien probe knocks Picard unconscious and he awakens on a strange world named Kataan where a beautiful woman tells him his name is Kamin, her husband of three years, and that he is suffering from memory problems. In what is only 25 minutes aboard the ""Enterprise"" Picard lives an entire lifetime on the planet Kataan, eventually accepting the life he has no choice but to lead. A powerful episode that gives Picard the chance to live the life he will never have as a Starfleet captain.

 ""Tapestry"" (Written by Ronald D. Moore, Season 6: Episode 15) is a Q episode. Picard is critically wounded in an attack and wakes up in a white light where Q tells him he is dead. Picard's artifical heart has cost him his life and the captain gets the chance to see what would have happened if he had not had that fight with the Nausicaan when he was at Starfleet Academy. The result was that everything that made him a great leader would have been lost and he ends up on the ""Enterprise"" as a lowly astrophysics officer. This is certainly a nice final episode for this set since it puts Picard's life in perspective.

 For me, this scores six out of seven. I would have ditched ""The Drumhead"" and substituted ""Lessons"" (Season 6: Episode 19), where Picard shares his music on the Kataan flute with Lieutenant Commander Nella Daren, and receives another lesson in the loneliness of command. It is interesting to note that the UK version of this set has a different lineup consisting of ""Allegiance,"" ""Captain's Holiday,"" ""Darmok,"" ""The Inner Light,"" ""Starship Mine,"" ""Lessons"" and ""Bloodlines."" Intersting choices, but clearly on balance the US version has a better lineup.

 This colletion certainly does well enought to justify rounding up, especially once you throw in ""From Here to Infinity,"" a documentary of space exploration hosted by Stewart. I was not interested in picking up all season by season ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" sets and I cannot imagine a set focusing on any of the other characters being as strong as this collection (Data and Worf will vie for second, obviously, unless they do a Lwaxana Troi set), so the ""Jean-Luc Picard Collection"" suits me just fine.",1091404800,271,6004,4.881139489194499
2060332,5,B00023P4F6,"This is a great collection for fans of Captain Picard who like the show but lack either the money or the desire to buy the complete series. I hope to see more ""best of"" collections of this sort in the future. I love Star Trek, but I don't necessarily need to have every single episode sitting on my desk for the indefinite future. This particular collection includes some of my favorite individual episodes and I couldn't be happier with it. If you don't want to buy it, or if you already own the complete series on DVD, then nobody's holding a phaser to your head. Does being a ""collector"" mean you have to buy every single thing even if you don't want it or need it?

2060344,4,B00023P4F6,"It would be hard-pressed for anyone to pick just six episodes from a series that ran seven years and 176 installments, especially if those six episodes were centered around the lead character.  Thus, ""Star Trek: The Jean-Luc Picard Collection"" has a tough job on its hands and whatever episodes the producers decided upon would be met with praise by those that agreed with the selection or condemnation by those that felt their favorite(s) had been omitted.

Whichever side one finds himself on is - in the words of the Borg - ""futile.""  The selection here is well-balanced, featuring exemplary acting by all concerned and the chance to know the mind and the personality of one Jean-Luc Picard, well-played by Patrick Stewart.

Fan favorites ""The Inner Light,"" ""Sarek,"" and ""Darmok"" are included, along with the superbly acted/told ""Family"" and ""The Drumhead.""

Only does ""Tapestry"" fall a little short, as a stand alone installment or even one featuring recurring character ""Q"" (John de Lancie).

The extra, a rather lackluster documentary (""From Here to Infinity: The Ultimate Voyage"")with Stewart as host could have been jettisoned in favor of another episode centered around the captain of the Enterprise NCC 1701-D.",1245542400,,1220,5.198979591836735

2060346,5,B00023P4F6,This collection of episodes from Star Trek: TNG that focus on the 2nd best Captain in Starfleet history ( Kirk casts a long shadow not even Picard can escape) is nice a nice collection that showcases the best of Jean Luc Picard. Every Trek fan should have it in thier collection.,1188259200,,279,4.490196078431373
2060347,4,B00023P4F6,"Clearly a Picard-focused retrospective should include some Borg action. Given that a special collection of Borg episodes was envisioned, I understand the decision to stick with no Borg content on this DVD. Even so, a switch of some content for the masterful ""Best of Both Worlds"" would have made this a five-star collection for me. At least Q made an appearance.

Not all of the episodes resonate with me. It's a diverse set, from straight bottle shows (""Drumhead"") to alien worlds (""Darmok"") to the holodeck (""Big Goodbye"") and even Earth (""Family"").

""The Inner Light"" easily stands above the rest as one of the finest shows of any Star Trek series.

As a Q fan, I enjoyed ""Tapestry"", with Q as guardian angel Clarence to Picard's George Bailey. Not exactly, of course, since it was the alternate path not taken vs. never been born.

Jimmy Stewart appeared again in ""Drumhead"", where Picard sounded like ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" with his passionate remarks and standing up for rights. This show is decent, if a bit heavy-handed.

Count me in the minority for not praising ""Darmok"" as highly as others. This one could have been expanded into a fine two-part episode that developed the interesting core idea more. As it was, the story seemed rushed and a bit derivative, even though the two never came to blows ""Arena""-style.

""The Big Goodbye"" was TNG's ""Piece of the Action"". What a difference between Kirk and Picard in those two shows! I also liked the inkling of a potential relationship between Picard and Beverly here, from early in the series. Very stylish costumes, too.

""Sarek"" nicely brings Spock's father around for another turn, with a good take on what might happen to an aging Vulcan's mind, particularly when it involves the loss of control.

""Family"" doesn't stand that well out of context and was rather predictable. I may have trimmed the Worf thread and spent more minutes on Picard and his brother.

I would gladly have traded the bonus documentary, which has nothing really to do with Picard or TNG other than Stewart narrates, for another episode.

Kudos to Paramount for making a solid collection at an affordable price.",1167609600,2,2151,4.884615384615385
2060348,5,B00023P4F6,"I think Jean Luc Picard is one of the best characters ever developed for television.

My Ratings (out of 5 - if anyone cares in the first place)

The Big Goodbye - 4/5, Sarek - 4.5/5, Family - 5/5, The Inner Light - 5/5, Tapestry - 5/5, Darmok - 4.5/5, The Drumhead - 4.5/5

The only downside to this is that there are a few more episodes that could be included here, like ""Best of Both Worlds pts. 1&2"". Hopefully there will be similar collections released in the near future that will deal with the other characters & perhaps some of the villains as well. The extra-documentary ""From Here to Infinity"" (narrated by Patrick Stewart) is a littel klanky, but if you think you might like a documentary on space exploration, then you'll probably enjoy it.

I purchased this, frankly, solely for the inclusion of ""The Inner Light"", in my mind one of the finest hours of science fiction television ever produced. It alone was well worth the price of the DVD.

However, I must also agree that the absence of ""The Best of Both Worlds"", ""Chain of Command"" and even ""All Good Things..."" is puzzling. This first two, in particular, are the definitive Picard episodes, and the collection seems odd without them.",1127779200,3,859,4.682119205298013

8021565,4,B00023P4F6,"There will always be disagreement as to which episodes should have been amoungst those selected, whilst suggestions are made that perhaps a larger collection would have been the wiser choice.

That debate aside, this is a first-rate collection that does indeed showcase Patrick Stewart's dramatic abilities.  ""The Inner Light"" has Patrick Stewart portraying Picard's inner tormoil as he becomes convinced that the Enterprise was a fever-induced delerium, whilst his ""present reality"" is his true existence ... only to find out, seemingly decades later, that an entirely different reality, contrary to either, is in fact the ""real"" one.  Stewart never displays any forceful emotions here; rather, his acceptance of his ""present reality"" is at once somber and joyful.  He has lost the Enterprise, but has gained a family whom he loves, and loves him.

Contrast that performance to that in ""Sarek"", and you're talking about a horse of a different color.  There's nothing subtle here.  Due to Sarek's Ben-Dy syndrome, Picard must mind-meld with Sarek.  This entails enduring the full force of Sarek's repressed emotions.  This is vitally necessary in order to share his own strength with Sarek, thusly enabling Sarek to find enough emotional control to perform one last, critical negotiation Sarek has devoted his diplomatic career to facilitate.

Well, be prepared for the full force of Patrick Stewart's method acting and Shakespearean training, because this is, hands down, his most arresting performance.  It's simply not to be missed.

The other episodes are good too; perhaps the idea here is to enable the viewer to know Picard's character more fully, capturing an exposition of that character in these episodes.  Fans may point to other episodes they liked better, but it would be hard to argue that these episodes presented here don't display Patrick Stewart's dramatic abilities in abundance.  Further, after having watched these episodes, you'd have a hard time pretending you don't know Picard.

I strongly recommend this collection, even if you disagree with the episode selection.  If you want to better know Picard without having to purcahse all seven seasons of ""ST:TNG"", this is an excellent place to start.",1321833600,,2220,5.3
