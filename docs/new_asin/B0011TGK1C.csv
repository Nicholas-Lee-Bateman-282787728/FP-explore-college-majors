8298372,5,B0011TGK1C,"I am guessing the only people interested in this DVD would be Maryland fans looking to relive that magical run to the NCAA championship in 2002 as I was!

First off, this is not just final four highlights.  It actually is more of a summary of the entire 2002 NCAA tournament.  I enjoyed this as it helped me to remember which underdogs got through and which teams got knocked off and how.  It had many short clips from the first,second, sweet 16, and elite 8 rounds showcasing the shockers(shows duke losing in the sweet sixteen!).

In addition, it truly highlights each team to get to the final four along with shorts clips to show how they got there.  Then, both final four games and the championship game are shown more like a play by play showcasing all of the game's key plays, highlights, streaks, droughts, foul situation, etc.  Much more in depth than your average espn highlights.  Very well done and through.

It ends with interviews of some of the Maryland players during the credits describing what it meant to win it all!

PROS:
- shows much more than just final four highlights
- showcases the road each final four team too took to get there
- final four games and championship game were given due attention
- play by play for all key plays in the last two rounds was great

CONS:
- overall quality of the film is 4 out of 5.  No HD back then...looks a tad aged.

Overall a great product to help any Maryland fan relive that magical run in the tournament!  Exceeded expectations.",1268611200,,1493,4.5018587360594795
