8116603,4,B000F2CA7E,"Moonlight in Tokyo is a very odd film. A man in debt to Japanese gangsters comes across an old childhood classmate of his, a retarded-yet-earnest and good-looking fellow searching for his brother. When the man discovers his friend has a certain way of hugging people that puts them completely at ease, he transforms him into a gigolo in an effort to earn the money back.

There are bound to be comparisons to Deuce Bigalow, and perhaps films that feature mentally retarded characters in dramatic, narrative turns. This film mixes elements of both. It jumps between moments of laugh-out-loud comedy, Asian cinema slapstick, tearjerker moments, character development, and a roller coaster of plot twists and unexpected developments. For western audiences it might come off as very uneven, but Asian cinema has a way of confidently straddling multiple genres and tones, often abruptly switching from scene to scene. The buddy bonding scenes are also very touching, in that close-knit way that the culturally ignorant might equate with homosexuality (lots of hugs between guys, a bizzare swan dance sequence).

Chemistry between the leads is good, everyone else is pretty much along for the ride with some exaggerated acting here and there. Definitely recommended as a rental, and don't be surprised to find yourself tearing up at the end of this comedy-drama about gigolos.",1150070400,2,1370,5.222727272727273
