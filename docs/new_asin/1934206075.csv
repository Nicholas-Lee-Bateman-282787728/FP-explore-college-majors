7801857,5,1934206075,"The early church fathers, those who's study and writings had the greatest impact upon the faith, were students of theological and mystical concepts.  These men and women of the faith knew it was their responsibility to dive deeply into the study of the Divine and how we are related to those Forces.  It is even more so our responsibility as practitioners of any Faith, to deeply consider all possibilities, and allow the Divine Wisdom to manifest in us, an Understanding superior to a blind fallowing of dogmatic law.

This documentary is one of the single most important sources of Religious wisdom we have today, and I'm certain that if those Apostles of old were alive today.  Surely, they would give praise to God for the opportunity to meditate upon such things.  It was the bread and Life of the true and faithful to consider these mysteries with their whole Heart.",1432425600,2,872,4.786666666666667

7801859,5,1934206075,"Glorian Publishing is always releasing VERY interesting lectures via books, compact discs and dvds.  This one is no different...except, it is.  It makes connections between teachings and ideas from different spiritual traditions which, on the surface, seem to have absolutely nothing in common.  Yet this video lecture clearly shows evidence that the opposite is true.  A fascinating subject from one of the most open Esoteric Schools I have come across.",1398556800,3,454,5.442857142857143
7801860,5,1934206075,"This movie is great. It's more like a lecture - without the talking heads - that covers the basic teaching of Gnosis. Sexual Magic or White Tantra. This movie does try to simplify something that is extremely complex, but does do a good job of covering the foundation of the teachings. If you find this video interesting I highly recommend you find a Gnostic school near you. If you are an instructor this may be a good tool to use as an introduction to sexual magic.",1356220800,3,466,4.430232558139535
7801861,5,1934206075,"This movie explains everything that I have ever been searching for! There was a time when I was studying Kabbalah, and separately I was studying Tantra Yoga. This was the biggest AH-HA moment that I have ever experienced in my life! I was watching this and was blown away when they started correlating the two traditions. It was like I've known it all my life, but this video just kinda smacked me in the forehead with it. When you watch this movie, you will know what I am talking about. It is knowledge that you have known through the eternities, it will awaken in you a deep memory that has been locked and stored away for lifetimes. When you read the Bible literally like most of us Christians growing up do, it never really made sense. This video explains beautifully the Bible's allegorical meanings. Examples from numerous spiritual traditions are given to help connect the dots to this sacred knowledge. It helped me to reflect on my past actions and how I have caused myself and others so much harm and suffering by abusing this sacred energy. The abuse of sex destroys lives, I know from my own personal experience, and this video shows how and why. I love how it was done in a documentary style with enjoyable and professional narration, very well done. This video is deep and can be a bit overwhelming, but says everything that is needed. God bless all those who went to great lengths to make this video! Thank you, the knowledge herein has changed the whole course of my life, for the better. May all who view this receive the same light. God bless you all!",1355788800,7,1570,4.551236749116608
