3748584,5,B001PMR2KS,"Since the times of Roberto Rosellini's ""Germany year zero"" and Rene Clement's ""Forbidden games"" the vision of WW2 under the childish perspective, had not achieved such level of profound candidness, innocence about the hellish landscape in which grew up.

A sensitive boy - Bruno -  who stems in superior grade the value of the friendship, is the son of a German officer, who is promoted to a new destiny in 1942. That superior decision makes they have to leave their home in Berlin to a rural house.

The smells, livings and memories of these ages will slowly be blurring, when this little man meets another Jewish child, dressed with pijama and numbered  prisoner. He is not informed at all what's going on behind that fence and ingenuously thinks they are farmers.

That weird friendship will be the cornerstone of a tragic fatality when a set of random circumstances lead that German father to taste the bitterness of that final solution.

Well acted and supported by an agile camera handle. Recommended without reserves.",1228780800,,1024,4.924418604651163
3748585,5,B001PMR2KS,"All I can say about this movie is that it's sad, very emotional, some beautifu shots, and a very good sound track. The last 15 minutes everyone's hearts were pounding.",1228694400,,167,4.6
3748586,5,B001PMR2KS,"Certainly, there are some professional critics who will show-off clever epithets when they review this film.  Their smart-aleck comments might be something like ""See what happens to naughty little boys who disobey their parents?"" or, ""Curiosity killed the cat.""  There are some critics who opine that this film disserves the Holocaust.  Look, just avoid them, and see the film.

Such comments like those are unfair to the film, which hits the right note in its simplicity.  There are many directors who would've blown it way out of proportion.  Some commentators have criticized the actors' British dialects.  The use of dialects is part of the actor's craft.  However, I find the director's decision not to use German dialect appropriate.

I saw the movie in limited release without foreknowledge of the plot or the storyline.  I found it a haunting story that lingers in the mind.  The audience, with whom I saw it, did not cheer, did not applaud, and did not cry; we were just numbed into silence by the power of the story.  We exited in silence.  That doesn't happen in movies too often.  I can see the faith the studio has in it.  But having seen it once, do I want to see it again?

If viewed as a fable, and the book has won many awards, the story may be too simplistic.  The book was written for children, as if a child was to read the story, but it's marketed to young adults in high school, I think because of the story's power.  Using a fable to tell the story allows the author to take a step from reality.  Some have correctly commented upon the implausibility of the plot and events in the film.  Whether it was correct for the director to follow the book so closely, that is, telling an allegory or fairy tale (which cinema does poorly, as in the case of Spielberg's wonderful film, ""AI: Artificial Intelligence"" (2001)), is uncertain.  If the director had chosen to infect the film with some hard doses of reality, the film would have a different feel.

Consider, Bruno, the major character.  In the book and film, he's an eight-year old boy who is innocent of all the storm and stress of Nazi Era Germany.  In reality, Bruno would've been in the Hitler Youth since he was six.  He would've been educated in the Nazi catechism of the time and not been such an innocent in search of a playmate.  If, for the sake of the movie, Bruno was in the Hitler Youth and been shown in uniform for a moment, let's say at the party in Berlin, it might have meant a stronger character arc for him, reminiscent of the film, ""Tomorrow the World"" (1944) that starred Skippy Homeier, who won an award for his portrayal of a Hitler Youth.  The storyline would not need to change; the plot would proceed like Teutonic clockwork toward the powerful coda.  But, perhaps that might've changed it too much, for the film relies on its simplicity.

Consider, Shmeul, Bruno's acquaintance.  Shmeul's survival in the camp was very uncertain, but we know that children did survive.  We have recollections of those who were there.  At the end of the war, Allies had a terrific problem relocating the surviving children, as told in the film, ""The Search"" (1948).

But, that's the difference between telling a fable intended for children (who've been shooed away by the rating) and a fable for adults who see the childishly simple metaphors at play.

So, would I want to see this movie again?  Yes, I want to see it again, if I can afford it, and if I can get myself in the frame of mind again.  Do I recommend owning a copy of the video?  Yes.  I will, but not on Blu-ray.

I think this is a story that tells the affect of the Holocaust and its lingering Hell on everyone connected with it then and ever since, and I think it will affect you, too.",1228521600,4,3732,4.529940119760479
3748587,4,B001PMR2KS,"I just returned from taking 3 young boys(ages 9-11) to see this film.  They are all pretty mature and know a lot about the Holocaust already, but I think that this film made them realize the actual horror of the Holocaust in a way that books can't.  That the story is told through the eyes of a very precocious 8-year-old kept their interest, even though virtually all the film's violence is implied or happens off-screen. I had no idea the film ended as it did, and we all walked out in silence.  Yet, the more we discussed it on the way home, the more we saw the irony--well, perhaps poetic justice, in a sense-- of the film's message of evil and the way it takes root, and how you can't participate in it and still keep yourself and your family separate from it.  The message is transferable to so many modern situations that this alone makes the film worthwhile.  Yes, the boys' conversations would have been spotted very quickly--yes, the ending requires you to take a leap of logic...but the performances and the moral of the movie render it worthy of a viewing.  By the way, Vera Farmiga as Bruno's mother is superb.",1227657600,3,1123,4.5073891625615765
3748588,4,B001PMR2KS,"You'd think it would be easy to determine how to feel about ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,"" but no, it isn't. Despite the heavy subject matter, it tells such a simple, direct story, and there are virtually no gray areas in terms of character development. Everyone is defined so thoroughly at the start of the film that they never really have the chance to become something else, which is to say that there's no sense of maturation. I believe this also applies to the main character, an eight-year-old German boy named Bruno (Asa Butterfield), who at the height of Hitler's regime moves with his family from Berlin into the countryside. Their new home is directly next to a concentration camp, where an eight-year-old Jewish boy named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) spends his time sitting at the electrified border. When Bruno goes exploring one day, he meets Shmuel, and even though they're separated, the two become friends. Despite the fact that Bruno learns a great deal over the course of the film, I'm hard pressed to say that he transitions from ignorance to knowledge. Quite simply, there's just so much he doesn't understand.

In all fairness, that's probably a much more realistic approach to the material. We've seen so many films that adhere to the ""Amazing Grace"" principle, in which characters are lost then found, blind then able to see. We get nothing like that from ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas."" Bruno is incredibly ignorant, mostly because he grew up in a world that wanted to keep him that way. He hears and sees anti-Semitic propaganda all around him, and yet we're never really sure if he believes any of it. I say this because he's the kind of child that asks a lot of questions, most of which aren't answered satisfactorily; those that are answered inevitably lead to even more questions, which is a good thing because it proves he's actually thinking. His only problem is that he's never able to come to a conclusion. All he can do is keep wondering why certain things are the way they are. That may explain why he would much rather read an adventure story than a history textbook--daring explorers in fantasy worlds are much easier to understand.

Bruno is essentially the film's strongest element. Not so strong are most of the other characters, which are all so rigidly constructed. Bruno's father, Ralf (David Thewlis), is a strict Nazi soldier who oversees the neighboring concentration camp. Bruno's mother, Elsa (Vera Farmiga), spends much of the film is a blissful state of ignorance, aware that Jews are the enemy but blind to the fact that many are tortured and killed; even when she discovers why the smoke emanating from the camp's chimneys is so foul-smelling, she can do nothing but cry uncontrollably. Bruno's twelve-year-old sister, Gretel (Amber Beattie), is strong-headed and hopelessly brainwashed.

The rest of the supporting characters were never given the chance to fully develop, which is a shame considering the potential they all had. One is Bruno's grandmother (Sheila Hancock), who doesn't get along with her son because, apparently, she doesn't quite buy into Hitler's vision for a glorious future. Another is Lieutenant Kotler (Rupert Friend), a young Nazi soldier that Gretel has a crush on. The dramatic possibilities for this character were mostly overlooked, reducing him to little more than a passing reference. There are, in fact, only two supporting characters that work well. One is Shmuel, who, because of his age, is just as ignorant as Bruno; he knows that life is hard for him in the camp, but he has no real idea how things work under a Nazi regime. Another is Pavel (David Hayman), an imprisoned Jew who's often sent to work in Bruno's family's kitchen. When Bruno cuts his leg after falling off a handmade tire swing, Pavel tends to his wounds; when he tells Bruno that he used to practice as a doctor, Bruno fails to understand why a doctor would give that up to be a potato peeler.

His ignorance plays a vital role in the film's emotionally draining ending, which will no doubt divide audiences. There's no resolution--there's only a slow, agonizing fade to black. There's also the sickening feeling that, as far as the characters are concerned, absolutely nothing has been learned. There was an audible reaction amongst the people I saw this film with. As we all walked out of the theater, one woman behind me said, ""What a disappointing ending."" I was compelled to turn around and calmly ask her, ""What more needed to be said?"" The way I see it, the final scene of ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is perfectly acceptable; given the course of events, which I obviously can't describe, there would be no way to prolong the ending without it seeming forced.

As I said at the beginning, it isn't easy determining how to feel about this film. It's an above average story of friendship, and I was certainly moved a great deal by it. But it's not without its flaws, especially when it comes to character development. On the whole, I think it's fair to say that it's an unforgettable film, highly emotional and deeply thought provoking. ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" will not give everyone what they want, but that doesn't mean it doesn't say everything it needs to say. In other words, it tells a complete story. It doesn't, however, give us complete characters, which is clearly a disappointment given the powerful nature of the subject matter. And while only a minor thing, some may also be bothered by the fact that an entirely British cast portrays German characters. If seeing this movie depends on a single reason, let it be Asa Butterfield, who does a wonderful job as Bruno, a curious, nave young boy. Of all the characters, his was the most compelling.",1227571200,3,5729,4.818089430894309
3748589,5,B001PMR2KS,"What did the Holocaust look like through the eyes of Jewish children consigned to the concentration camps? Or through the eyes of an entirely normal Nazi family whose father was ""promoted"" from Berlin to Commandant of a death camp in the countryside? Bruno is only eight years old, so he's naturally curious about the ""farm"" only a few hundred yards from his family mansion, where people wear striped pajamas with numbers on them. Where black smoke billows from chimneys, and where horrid smells fill the air. And if Pavel was a doctor, why is he now wearing those pajamas and peeling potatoes for his family? Bruno forms an unlikely friendship through the electric barbed wire with another eight-year-old, Shmuel. The innocence that they share puts into bold relief the horrendous consequences of the Holocaust -- for the Jews, of course, but in unlikely and catastrophic ways for every member of this prim, proper, and patriotic family whose father was responsible for ""making the world better."" The film explores a horrible paradox of the Holocaust -- that an evil of unimaginable magnitude was carried out by everyday people just like us.",1227139200,17,1142,5.015789473684211
3748590,3,B001PMR2KS,"I have real mixed feelings about ""The Boy In The Striped Pajamas"", a new British film about a German boy and his family during World War II.

As I watched the film, directed by David Herman (""Brassed Off"", ""Little Voice"") and co-produced by the BBC, I was carried along by the story, which is impossibly idealized. But the filmmakers do a clever thing and mask the idealization through the eyes of an 8-year-old boy, who doesn't, and probably couldn't, know the truth. But the more I think about it, is this a good thing? And who is the audience for this film?

Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is a pretty typical 8-year-old boy. He enjoys playing with his friends and finds the family's huge Berlin house to be fertile for his imagination; Bruno and his friends run through the hallways and up and down the staircase with abandon. Bruno's mom (Vera Farmiga, ""The Departed"", ""Breaking and Entering"") and dad (David Thewlis, the ""Harry Potter"" films) sit their children down and tell them about Father's new promotion, a promotion which means they must move to a new house in the country. Father is a German officer and his promotion has been to run a Concentration Camp. But Bruno and his older sister don't know this and they cautiously roam through the new house. Bruno spots a ""farm"" from his bedroom window and inquires about the ""funny people"" wearing striped pajamas. Mama is confused, but soon realizes what he has seen and quickly boards up his bedroom window. Desperate for some adventure, Bruno eventually sneaks into the back garden and further, moving through the lush plants and overgrown grass until he comes to the electrified fence surrounding the ""farm"". There, he spots a boy, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) sitting on the other side of the fence, staring into his hands, and they talk. A friendship quickly blooms leading Bruno to try to get away everyday and sneak food to his new friend.

As Bruno runs through the fields, the director seems to have placed a filter on the lens to capture as much dappled sunlight as possible. This stretches the believability of the story quite a bit. But just as I felt myself about to switch off, I realized, or remembered that Bruno is only eight. His parents have kept him sheltered from the truth and he doesn't have any idea of what is going on.

But does this make it OK to watch such an idealized view of such a horrific event? Even such a small part of such a horrific event?

Obviously, this story isn't going to have a happy ending. But the extent of this ending shocked me and made the film more powerful erasing many doubts.

On the one hand, ""Striped Pajamas"" almost wants to be a bedtime story. On the other hand, it tries to tell a moving story that will tug at your heart, trying to get you to cry. But both efforts are just slightly off. When I researched the director, David Herman, and found that he had directed both ""Brassed Off"", starring Ewan McGregor and Pete Posthelwaite and ""Little Voice"" starring Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine, some things clicked into place. Each of these films has various elements that work, but they are all slightly off. Like something isn't clicking into place. Like the director doesn't have enough skill to recognize there is a problem, or the skill to correct the problem and connect all of the dots. Each film is missing something to connect the dots.

There is an attempt to bring home the horrors of the situation. Mama (Farmiga) knows they are moving to a house on the outskirts of a concentration camp, she knows what her husband is about to undertake, but she doesn't realize the extent of the job. The moment of realization is powerful, but it comes early and is followed by a lot of erratic behavior. Mama also spends a lot of time frowning or looking worried as she realizes Bruno might eventually learn the truth or as she watches her daughter begin to embrace the Third Reich, joining the youth movement.

The behavior seems to have no effect on Bruno, because he doesn't know or understand what is going on.

Because the children are living in the country, Papa hires a tutor for them. We watch as the tutor attempts to teach the two kids the party line, instilling in them the propaganda leading to the horrors perpetrated by the Third Reich. At one point, Bruno spies on a secret meeting and watches a propaganda film about how great life in the camps is. These are very interesting moments, but they don't really seem to open up little Bruno's eyes. Since we are following Bruno through this journey, it is difficult for us to watch, as he doesn't seem to come to any realizations.

The main problem seems to be the choice of an 8 year old as our guide through this story. ""The Boy In The Striped Pajamas"" is aimed at adults who go to foreign films, adults who like Merchant Ivory films, adults who like historical period pieces. So why an 8 year old? Are the filmmakers trying to attract children? To make the film seem more like a bedtime story? I really don't think so, but you have to wonder. If any children of this age actually watch this film, I think they might have nightmares. When the story finally shifts and the events begin to become more horrific, the children will have questions. Questions that you will have to answer and the answers will most likely scare the children.

But the film doesn't exactly work as a story strictly for adults. Because Bruno never sees any of the consequences of what his father is doing, what his country is doing, he remains oblivious. It is almost as though the filmmakers want us to fill in the blanks, leaving the horror to our imagination. And this works to a certain extent, but because Bruno is our guide into this world, he needs to see some of this as well. When a friendly old Jew, a former doctor, who works in the house suddenly disappears, Bruno asks about him and his sister responds ""He's not coming back"" with an attitude indicating he should know better. We know better. But Bruno wouldn't.

But the filmmakers temper this lack of awareness in two ways. Bruno is very young. And his lack of realization leads him to a very problematic end.

Vera Farmiga is good as Mama. As soon as she realizes what is going on in the camp, she becomes emotionally troubled and can't accept what her husband is doing. Unfortunately, this leads her to sit around with red eyes, swing on a tire swing for hours, and to act like a crazy person, causing her husband a lot of problems. The role is a bit over the top and theatrical, but as she is the only person who seems to realize the horror, it works.

David Thewlis is also good as Papa, an officer in the German army who accepts his new promotion with pride. He shows a believable lack of emotion and a credible amount of stern authority. Thankfully, he plays the character pretty even keel, staying away from histrionics.

Even though the performances are good, this is yet another film set during World War II in which the majority of the characters speak with British accents. Yes, the film is directed by a Brit, and co-produced by the BBC. But try to go for some authenticity and make the characters at least sound like they are German. In the upcoming ""Valkyrie"", it appears that Tom Cruise doesn't attempt any accent along with all of his British co-stars.

3748652,3,B001PMR2KS,"Historically speaking, the premise of this movie involves a good dose of suspension of belief as most small children who were victims of the holocaust would probably have been killed by the Nazis and their collaborators right away given the fact that they would not have been strong enough to do the hard labor that was required of most concentration camp prisoners. Add to that, the unlikelihood that a German boy (and the son of an SS officer) would have been able to come into such close contact with a concentration camp, let alone be able to repeatedly wander from home without his very protective mother being aware of it.

Even so, I think that if a movie is done well enough, if the characters and the plot are engrossing enough, and if the acting is exemplar, then sometimes the suspension of belief is warranted, and on some level, ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas""  seems to do so. Indeed, ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" at least is a good vehicle to engage young people into a conversation on the psychological aspects of genocide, the process of dehumanization, blaming the victim, and the mob mentality that might lead otherwise normal people into carrying out and supporting the horrific treatment of others. On the other hand, I would also advise the viewer who is new to the subject of the holocaust (as well as any teacher who plans on using ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" as a supplement to a study on the holocaust, Nazi Germany or World War II) that a classroom showing of this movie should be accompanied by a clarification that the REAL holocaust was about 100 times worse than what is shown of the holocaust in this movie (as bad as that seems).

In this sense, ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is not as much about the victims of the holocaust as it is an exploration of the minds of the perpetrators.

While ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" did not seem to captivate me on a level that would live up to what friends of mine built it up to be, the movie did manage to hold my attention throughout. I just wish that there was a little more to the movie as conflicting feelings in the characters could have been explored on a deeper level.

As a teacher, I do not have DVD/Blu-ray players in my classroom. I needed to use two specific scenes from this movie in our holocaust unit (not even the entire movie). It's not available digitally from Amazon, so I purchased the combo. It is completely useless. The digital copy requires you to create an account with a third party, Vudu, which I wasn't crazy about, but did it anyway. The playback was pathetically slow (most likely attribute to our district's internet, but after this experience I won't rule our it being an issue on Vudu's side - especially since I stream video clips All. The. Time with absolutely no issues). At this point, I attempted to download the movie, but guess what? I would need to download Vudu's program to my laptop to do this. Not gonna happen. I purchased the movie for the sole purpose of being able to watch it digitally and this product does not allow me to do this without programs they force you to use and, of course, release your personal information to.

Now from a filmmaking standpoint, it is no Schindler's List. It's more on par with Jacob the Liar (also a pretty good film)

Here is the issue I take with this film. It was created as if the family had 21st century sensibilities. The kids were not made aware of what was going on because dad wanted to, what? Protect them from his flagrant racism? To understand that this is kind of BS, you have to understand the time and place. These kids were not shielded from all this racism. They were told to embrace it and disciplined most severely if they didn't. So it's kind of hard to take this ""protect my kid from what i know is wrong"" nonsense seriously since this dude should have been knee high in the Hitler Youth by this age anyway.

Here was a case of someone who appeared to have lost his moral integrity and by the end of the movie he realizes to some extent what this has cost him. Asa Butterfield as his son is very good, considering how young he was when he made this picture. Asa has gone on to do many other pictures and I have enjoyed watching his career grow as he develops into a young adult. I won't give away the ending, except to say it is shocking even though you sense something like it is coming.

3748709,3,B001PMR2KS,"The 2008 holocaust period film The Boy in the Striped Pajamas had a tall order to fill. In a cinematic landscape deluged with films centered around the horrors of the holocaust, this film had to stand outto say something unique or else say the same old thing in a unique way. Using this criterion, it was only a partial success. Its speculation on what the dynamic of a family in the Third Reich divided over Nazi death camps might look like was intriguing. Not only that, but its focal point of two boys who just want to be friends despite the racial politics being thrust upon them gave a clear and simple gut level refutation of racism and violence. These positives are weakened more superficially by its heavy-handedness (the film's use of irony to hint to the mass killing of innocent Jewish people comes off almost like a series of badly conceived jokes) and more fatally by its unwillingness to grapple with issues of meaning and hope in light of humanity's inhumanity to man. The result is a film with great potential that ends up feeling gratuitous and nihilistic.

 While the metaphysical implications of the holocaust could be approached from a number of angles, this film's refusal to deal with the God question perhaps stands out as the most salient evidence of its need to be grounded in some kind of meta-narrative. The weight of the film's silence on this issue is felt when one considers the philosophical difficulty that inevitably arises in any serious reflection upon the holocaustwhere was God? Woody Allen's character in Anything Else, a paranoid Jewish school teacher named Dobel, points to this problem somewhat circuitously when he reasons, The crimes of the Nazis were so enormous . . . it would be justified if the entire human race were to vanish as a penalty. If the holocaust is such an indictment upon the human race, what does this tell us of God's responsibility? Does God care? If so, why not intervene? Was he trying to punish the Jewish people? As psychologist and holocaust survivor Victor Frankl mused, ""If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life"" (Frankl). It would be useful to examine how other media have dealt with this problem before returning to how The Boy in the Striped Pajamas deals (or doesn't deal) with it.

 One approach to this issue is the pessimistic one: perhaps God doesn't exist or else doesn't care about the suffering of Jews in the holocaust. The atheistic explication is given in another Allen filmCrime and Misdemeanors. At the scene of a Jewish dinner table, an atheist family member gets impatient with the customary Jewish blessing for food which quickly turns into an argument. The patriarch of the family, the atheist's brother, brings up the idea that God punishes the wicked. Like Hitler? his sister retorts. [The Nazis] got off with nothing because might makes right (Crimes and Misdemeanors).

 The perhaps more unsettling answer, that God exists but didn't care about the holocaust, is given voice in the film God on Trial wherein Jews in a concentration camp hold a trial to determine if God has broken His covenant with Israel. In the end, one man stands up and claims that since God supported the Jewish people in slaying their enemies, and their enemies are now slaying them, perhaps God has chosen the side of their enemies and established a new covenant with them.

 Rabbi Harold Kushner's popular book, When Bad Things Happen to Good People, makes a very different argument. Sure, God is loving. Of course He cared about the suffering of Jews at the hands of the Nazis. This being so, God would do what He could to help the Jewish people, but must not have been able to prevent it.

 Elie Wiesel's book Night, a memoir of his experience in a Nazi concentration camp, famously dealt with this question and gave the most creative answer to this difficulty:
Then came the march past the victims. The two men were no longer alive. Their tongues were hanging out, swollen and bluish. But the third rope was still moving: the child, too light, was still breathing... And so he remained for more than half an hour, lingering between life and death, writhing before our eyes. And we were forced to look at him at close range. He was still alive when I passed him. His tongue was still red, his eyes not yet extinguished.
Behind me, I heard the same man asking:
'For God's sake, where is God?'
And from within me, I heard a voice answer:
'Where He is? This is where--hanging here from this gallows...' (Wiesel).

 For Wiesel, God was identifying with the suffering of the Jewish people and it was His holy image being destroyed in the death camps. This answer perhaps found even greater depth in its explication by Jurgen Moltmann, a Christian theologian who pointed to God's taking on flesh in Christ to suffer alongside us as the epitome of the chosen passibility of a God who chooses to empathize with His image bearers. In The Crucified God, Moltmann argues for the supreme relevance of such a view:
Shattered and broken, the survivors of my generation were then returning from camps and hospitals to the lecture room. A theology which did not speak of God in the sight of the one who was abandoned and crucified would have had nothing to say to us then (Moltmann).

 In The Trinity and the Kingdom, he summarizes it: In their hearts all true men worship one God - the naked, wounded, bloody, but unconquered and unconquerable Christ (Moltmann). For Moltmann, suffering love is simply who God is. He cannot be absent in suffering, but is most present there. Such a view finds literary expression in Shusaku Endo's Silence, which tells the story of two Catholic priests investigating the alleged apostasy of a missionary to Japan. When they arrive in Japan and are taken by the Japanese government, they learn that the oppressor's tactic is to force the missionaries to apostatize at the threat of the lives of Japanese Christians. One of the priests, having struggled with the perceived silence of God in the face of human suffering, suddenly hears Christ speaking to him through an icon the priest is forced to trample on in order to save Japanese Christians from death: Trample! Trample! . . . It was to be trampled on by men that I came into the world. It was to share in men's suffering that I carried my cross (Endo).

 With all of these options to give a metaphysical framework to the holocaust, the Boy in the Striped Pajamas chooses none of them. In a post-modern age where the big questions are viewed as unanswerable since meaning is thought of as subjective, this isn't a surprise. If there is a moral appeal here it is based on the phenomenon of empathy, but why should empathy motivate my actions? There is suffering, sure, but what of it? The arbitrariness of a Nazi father putting Jewish children in gas chambers while trying to save his gentile son from one comes across quite strongly, but why should this stir viewers to act on behalf of humanity with love? Is our love as arbitrary as the Nazi father's hatred? If God doesn't exist or care, why should we care? If true art is meant to clarify values, which set of values is this film intending to impart? It seems to serve as a kind of fable or parable, but what precisely is its lesson and what undergirds its moral? In an age where the big questions are of little esteem, it is no surprise that The Boy in the Striped Pajamas feels shallow when its subject matter deserves the greatest depth of reflection which its creators can muster.

With a disturbing President-Elect, Donald Trump, and his rhetoric of making America Great again by dehumanizing Muslims and Immigrants with illegal raids and with Muslim registries. It reminds us that when we brew misery and evil in our own soil it is misery and evil that we get back. And this movie portrayed it very well.",1479513600,,597,4.486238532110092

And then I remembered this movie (and the book).  I'd previously read the book and watched the movie too, so I knew what to expect in terms of the ending.  I did have students who were visably upset at the ending (no spoilers) but they all understood what had happened and why.  Most had grown attached to the characters of Bruno and Schmuel and were hoping for a happy ending, like in most of our in-class readings.

3748763,2,B001PMR2KS,Just seemed very contrived.  Trying to push emotional  buttons in a formulaic and  predictable plot.  Do we have to pretend like it was something thought provoking just because it's about the Holocaust? It just wasn't...

3748826,4,B001PMR2KS,This movie is well done. I would recommend this movie for middle school/high school with parental supervision and only if they are or have studied the Holocaust. I would caution that the parents prewatch the last 10 minutes seperately to determine if it is appropriate for their children. The rest of the movie can be used for educational purposes. Please also note that the child disobeys throuout the movie and will cost him his life in the last ten minutes.,1468886400,,460,4.7625

3748887,4,B001PMR2KS,"I could only give this movie 4 stars because I didn't like the ending. I don't like sad endings for one, and I also don't like being left hanging. It just ended. I hate it when movies do that.
Other than that I thought it was a really cool story, relative to the content of course. I liked the view from a child's perspective of what that time may have been like. It humanizes Germans. When horrible things like that occur it's easy to sit back and think that all Germans are terrible, but this movie brings to light that some of them were just children. Some of them were brainwashed (by that I don't mean tortured). Some of them were impressionable and young and they were taught crazy things like Jews were bad and they should all be killed. If everyone in your life is telling you that (parents, teachers, media, etc.) then it's kind of hard not to believe it.
Since I didn't see anything in the movie about how it was based on a true story (which it is not as far as I can tell) I don't think it's fair to judge this movie on the historical inaccuracies. It's called Historical Fiction for a reason. So, if you're looking for a movie about what really happened during the holocaust, go watch a historical documentary. This is a movie, based on a book that a guy a wrote. And while it is fiction, it does portray real, human emotions.

The way it depicts how the vortex of evil that surrounds bad political ideology and demagogue dictators consumes ALL innocence in it's path, as it works its way through a nation that is blind to their own reduction to pure savagery against their neighbors; and even their own kin.

One can only imagine such friendships between children occurring today between Jews and Palestinians, North and South Korean children, children of different castes in India, and children of different races and socioeconomic backgrounds here in the United States. This film will show how the almost natural, God-given sense of justice that children see the world with....cannot and should not give ground to the often tainted adult world in an  era of power and racial hatred run amok.

The perspective of every character is quite moving, how the father views the Jews, which is one of anger and a job.  The mother, even though she is passive and does nothing, is affected, reminding us all that if we do nothing of injustice, we will be perpetrated on one day. The daughter, who is accepting the views without critically thinking through what is being taught. The soldier, who is so angry that he views the world in such madness and cannot reconcile with a father. Bruno and Schmuel: the innocent who just want to be friends and are hurt.

Also, sad but true - the majority of children too small to work were killed. It's a horrific fact and only shows the brutality of the Nazi regime. So, why was there an English accented boy in the Nazi concentration camp?
Be authentic or don't make the movie at all. You do the story an injustice by making it the Nazi's British, Scottish and Irish. It's an insult to the senses.",1466985600,,825,4.261146496815287

My wife being Filipino didn't know a whole lot of what happened during WWII.  It's good that films like these are continuing to be made so we never forget the evil that men do.

Apparently based on a novel by author John Boyne, the story itself is based off of an elderly jewish couple that used this ""tale"" to get publicity and money. Investigate yourselves to find out more. I found it difficult to watch knowing that the ""basis"" of this story was completely made up. The man who plays the little boy later came out apologizing for lying to the media and people for the publicity. His wife only went along because she loved him so much apparently... Once they were caught lying about it because the story didn't add up, she wouldn't make any more appearances with him. Not to mention that all of the ""Death Camps"" were discovered by the USSR.

Or, rather, you can if you tick off your list of ""this would never happen, that would never happen, etc."" I've watched this film three times over the years. I always have to steel my self. I'm always devastated and somehow renewed. Illumination does that to a person. I couldn't go away from this film, not once in three viewings, without looking inward at myself and outward at the world entire that allowed the Holocaust to happen and claimed to be ""innocent"" of all knowledge of it's existence. History continues to repeat itself all over the planet. This film depicts the devolution and destruction of innocence--as metaphor, as historical ""fact"" re-imagined, as mythology, as story told by a master director, and screen writer who captured the heart of the original novel.

3749058,5,B001PMR2KS,"As to be expected, this was an incredibly painful movie to watch. How could it not be? Anyhow, it was well-acted, and if you can stomach this kind of film, it is worth watching. There are multiple meta-themes and in the end, I was just left in a daze. I do recommend it, as it is a very good movie with incredible actors and an uncommon theme. But man, what we do as a species. I am surprised by the PG-13 rating; kids and teens should not be watching this, unless it is part of a broader discussion about the topic at hand.",1463788800,,524,4.097087378640777

3749063,5,B001PMR2KS,What an incredible and heart wrenching movie. The few who knew that what was happening was wrong were helpless to do anything to prevent it.

3749068,3,B001PMR2KS,"Not bad. It's perhaps geared more toward school aged children.  The message is good, and the film reminds us of the different mentalities of those in Nazi Germany. The pacing of the film was moderate, but I couldn't help but feel the storyline was sort of 'lumped' in between the intro and the outro, so to speak.

3749081,5,B001PMR2KS,A moving story of innocence against a backdrop of racism and bigotry- concepts that have to be taught.

Hard to believe that Germans living near the camps said they didn't know what was going on with all the smells and the transports.,1463443200,,331,4.824561403508772

But - I believe it would have been much more powerful if there was an aftermath to the disaster.  Ending at that point truncated the movie.  We needed to see how it affected the dad and the sister, who had fallen into the Nazis' thinking so easily.  Interesting that half of that family fell into it, and half didn't.  What a horrible page in history. Beautiful movie.  The 2 young boys were outstanding.",1462147200,,568,4.724489795918367

It's a sad reminder of the history, and ugliness of humans, and the beauty and innocence of children.  The movie is a teaching tool to show that children are taught to hate, and to be bigots. It's learned behavior not something that is built into humans.

Is the story devastating?  Yes.  In this case, considering the mission and necessary seriousness of the book, that is very good.  There are various changes from the book's story line but they add to the possibilities of the scenario, rather than damaging it.  Read the book first and then add this to the experience.

Young adult viewers who encounter the film seem to be stunned and appropriately overcome by the end of this film, even after reading the novel and knowing a great deal of what would happen ahead of time.  That will probably and most likely include adult viewers as well.",1461456000,4,751,4.858267716535433

This movie told a story of how a young 8 years old German filled with curiosity to explore the so called the ""farm"" and befriended a 8 years old Jewish boy prisoner. After some secret meetings with the Jewish boy with out the knowledge of German boy's parents of his whereabouts during his absence. In progress of time as shown in the film that German boy began to question about his father's job as Nazi official and understanding the difference of good and evil.

3749313,5,B001PMR2KS,"Innocent, compassionate, evocative.  Other reviewers complain about the ending.  ***Spoiler*** I guess they would rather one boy die alone and apart from his friend?  The beauty in this is you're aware of the crematory half-way through the film, but you're probably not as emotionally engaged at that point.  This speaks to our human nature.  We can be aware of a great evil, but so long as we're not directly connected to affected by it it may not move us to feel much.  When something or someone connects us, as does our young protagonist here, it suddenly becomes heart wrentching and an awful spectacle.  ***End Spoiler***

3749318,5,B001PMR2KS,"While at times this movie might seem to be a bit slow or simple, it's beautifully presented because it's almost entirely from the perspective of the small German boy. He doesn't know about all the war stuff going on, he's been kept relatively isolated from all of it by his father and mother, and when he is exposed to some of the horrors of the war and of how the Jewish people are being treated and murdered, it is presented by his father and sister as acceptable and normal. A Jewish man that he knows personally can be beaten to death and he accepts it with only a passing amount of fear and upset. This is how his world works, which is horrifying to contemplate.
In the end, I have seen many reviewers who say things like ""The father will now realize he's been wrong... "" and such but I feel that in real life, the father would simply have blamed the Jews for everything, instead of seeing his victims in a different light, relating to his own tragedy. I did not feel any hope for the father's soul at all.
In the end, it is one of the more powerful movies presented in a slightly unusual way and it's entirely successful in doing it and affecting the viewers emotionally and mentally. While sad and upsetting, it brings the Holocaust into your living room and makes it personal, forcing you to remember that each and every murdered victim of the Nazis was someone's child, someone's father or mother... and that is always a good thing. If we forget, it could happen all over again and the world does not need that lesson again.",1451088000,,1533,4.420494699646643

The symbolism, foreshadowing, and imagery are well worth exploring.  The filmmakers showcase the rise and fall of WWII from the Nazi perspective through the characters.  Their movements, dress, and facial expressions tell the tale of a confident Nazi Germany on the rise to a broken and desperate sociopathic group scrambling to finish their horrifying ""final solution"" with the Allies breathing down their neck.  In this film, two young boys, victims of a society spun out of control naturally navigate their own worlds coming together without prejudice in an attempt to salvage a fractured childhood.  Their instincts and inner conflict are well documented by the filmmakers who explore the confusing world in which they live.  In the end, boys will be boys and in the world created for them by an evil society, they find a way to do exactly what kids do; play, explore, and pretend.  Their playful exploration has consequences for them and the architects of the final solution.

I have watched many stories about the camps over the years, but this one gets into your heart in a very different way, probably because of it's innocence.  Until the ending, the story plays out on the very edge of the camp, and you understand what is going on, but the movie and the boys play their roles outside of the horrors.

It is only at the end that you are pulled into the camp, but then, again, the worst is hidden from your view and only implied.

3749477,2,B001PMR2KS,"Have you ever seen a person auditioning for some singing show on tv and they weren't bad? Like they did an ok job but there wasn't anything remarkable about them? The Boy in Striped Pajamas is like that. It hits all the usual notes that World War 2 movies hit, and doesnt have anything really special going for it up until the very end. This was a movie that I was looking forward to watching, and just 10 minutes into it, I felt something was wrong. Halfway through, I started thinking up better World War 2 movie ideas, like one where I have Anne Frank being played by Serena Williams, and when the Nazis come in to take her family away, she takes out a few of them with some reverse kicks and elbows, then does a handstand and grabs the lead SS officers head with her legs, throwing him out the window and saving the day. I thought of a lot more and ended up entertaining myself from beginning to end here because this is such an average movie that I was predicting everything that was going to happen for the most part, and was right 3/4 of the time.

Bruno is an 8 year old German boy who moves with his family into a new home after his father is promoted to a higher position in the military. He notices a strange looking farm from his window, noting that all the people wear pajamas while working, and that there are some kids working there too. His mom tries to make him forget about it, but Bruno is curious and makes his way for the farm one day while exploring. There, he meets Shmuel, a Jewish boy behind the electric fence as he performs his duties at the concentration camp. Bruno doesnt know what to make of all of this, and starts to ask Shmuel questions about what hes doing, and assumes that the young boy can leave to come over to his home like any other kid would be able to. Days go by and the two bond a little bit (stress on the little) as Bruno brings the boy food and even toys. Meanwhile, Brunos dad and sister have been brainwashed by the Nazi propaganda, and nothing but their country matters to them, while his mom is stuck holding in her emotions, for fear of being reported a traitor for criticizing anything regarding the Master Plan.

The whole movie is very basic, and for the most part, uninteresting. You have the innocent young boys who don't understand the situation they're in (on either side), a one-dimensional super Nazi father who never shows emotion for anyone or any situation unless it involves his work, the mom who never actually does anything, and the slightly older sister who follows her dads ways, mainly because she develops a crush on one of the soldiers at their house. Bruno is just a young boy, but legitimately has no interest in the war. He wants to be an explorer, and even when his tutor comes by and makes him read a new kind of book, the boy sticks to his guns. He manages to stay pretty normal through the whole movie, never gaining any insight to the war, or having any character development EXCEPT this weird part where he completely cowers down and lies about someone important to him. There are servants in the familys home that are Jewish, and were supposed to feel for them, but they don't get much screen time to do anything other than serve and get yelled at by others. And thats my main problem with the movie- none of the characters are given enough time for me to get attached to, no matter how bad their situation is. Of course I feel bad for Shmuel, but even Brunos sister gets more screen time than he does. You feel bad for him by default, and rarely because you see anything happening to him.

There were other things I didn't like, such as the Nazis being so lenient. When one of the servants is caught eating food from the dinner table, despite it being offered to them, he just gets a verbal slap on the wrist and is told theyll talk more about it later. It turns out that the prisoner didn't really get much of a punishment, all things considered. This same Nazi that yells at the prisoner is yet another character that doesnt have much going for them, and what does come up, is so vague that they may as well have not even included the scene at all. I will say that the ending came out of nowhere, and you're better off just watching the last 25-30 minutes of the movie. It feels like, if the movie is accurate to the book, the author wrote the ending first, then had to piece together the events that lead up to it because its such a shocker. At the same time, by that point, the movie lost me and I didn't feel as bad as I probably should have, or would have, if it were a better movie. Ill give them points for being one of the few WW2 movies Ive seen to show a little more than others Ive seen, and thats all ill say about it.

The Boy in the Striped Pajamas feels like it was made for high school classrooms to watch instead of something better for the Holocaust. The only people I can imagine caring much for this are people who are easily attached to characters based on whats happening to them and not who they are, or anyone thats never seen a World War 2 movie before. Watching it is a lot like doing one of those paint by the numbers pictures, with a repetitive soundtrack thats seemingly comprised of 5 tracks. In the end, this isn't a horrible movie by any stretch of the definition, just very lackluster.",1439856000,,5303,4.315947843530592

And the numbers given to the Jews in the Camp weren't on the prison uniform, they were tattooed on the arm. I know, it IS fiction and should be regarded as such.

3749631,1,B001PMR2KS,"This film is narratively nonsensical (if it were that easy to cross the fence...), historically implausible (a child that age would not be considered suitable by the SS for camp labor and likely would have been gassed immediately), and a gross trivialization of a heretofore unprecedented crime which tries to pull sympathy for both sides of the fence (one side of which was largely responsible for said crime). Setting aside even the basic ethical question of the Holocaust's cinematic representation to begin with, this film is arguably the worst offenders I've ever seen which goes so far as to show the inside of an gas chamber in full effect sans any of the blood, vomit, feces or screams that resulted within 20 horrible minutes of entering it.

I trust that those responsible for this story and film were well-intentioned, but the film remains no less deplorable for going about a subject of this magnitude without the necessary detail, gravity, or perspective necessary in understanding the events that happened in the systematic extermination of the European Jews. If you want to give children an appropriate glimpse, stick with Anne Frank.",1434499200,11,1149,5.079365079365079

3749676,5,B001PMR2KS,"As a former military officer in the U.S. Armed Forces, it was my privilege to be involved with studies in Air Command and Staff College (ACSC) and the Air War College.  In addition I received premiere education about the Nuremberg Code of 1947 and the Nuremberg Trials as conducted by Allies as the International War Crimes Trials.  That background is not meant to impress the reader of this review.  Rather I have looked for films that are based on historical novels and take a complicated subject so that the person with an average high school education can be enlightened.  This is accomplished in the DVD, ""The Boy In Stripped Pajamas.""  Two young actors, Asa Butterfield as Bruno, and Jack Scanlon as Schmuel are magnificent to the point of Genius, who portrayed what could have happened - and did happen - in Work Camps that were in an annex network with a main concentration camp.  The producers in conjunction with Hungarian, British, German and Budapest expertise recreated the tragic atmosphere
of what happened to individuals both directly and indirectly involved with Hitler's final solution.  The Genius of this DVD, is any member of a family
- no matter how young or old - can grasp what happened in the Holocaust - and must not take place again.  I purchased this DVD and it is an essential part of my DVD collection. It is often overlooked that the innocent were exterminated in the WW II camps whether a work place or concentration center.  It is important the young as well as the adults in the world comprehend what the Holocaust was.  Here is an excellent movie
to help gain that understanding in contemporary terms.  Mankind did not cross over into Jordan during the 20th Century - and neither have we in the
21st Century.  This DVD is an superb example to view and learn.",1433635200,26,1793,4.711538461538462

3749768,1,B001PMR2KS,"I agree with the reviews that we can't forget the horror the Jews and other prisoners of Germany suffered.  However, this is most depressing movie I've ever watched.

I would recommend instead that you read the Zion Chronicles by Bodie Thoene. These fictional books capture the pain and sufferings of the Jewish people during WWII.  They also tell the story of how the world did not help those that escaped....ships of refuges were turned away from ports in other countries.

3749769,2,B001PMR2KS,"I have been reading and studying WWII and the Holocaust so this movie caught my eye; however, I was sadly disappointed. There were too many inaccuracies and odd activities by characters like why was the mother always going into town? Did she have a job? I found it hard to believe the mother was so naive about her husbands job and what went on in concentration camps. She did tell her kids to stay away from the place but pretends she doesn't know anything. Then after the funeral of her mother-in-law she abandons all senses and takes to drinking heavily.

Hard to believe the 'Boy in the Striped Pajamas' had enough free time to befriend anyone outside the camp. My understanding of the Concentration camps is that inmates, even children, were watched quite closely. There were guard towers and electrified fences.  The scenes  when the Boy was 'looking for his father' seemed unreal. Men were typically sent to all-male camps, whereas children were sent to camps with there mothers.

I tried to convince myself that the ending really could have happened but it was too unrealistic.",1430438400,2,1085,4.817204301075269

3749788,4,B001PMR2KS,This is a good little film. I watched it with my boys and they were very moved by it. That's saying a lot. The story confronts the reasons and excuses the Nazi's used to justify their atrocities through the innocence and questioning mind of a young boy.

There is a twist in the story that causes one to question the mindset of ordinary people drawn into an ideology of hate and the consequences of evil.

I believe this movie goes into a very touchy subject and also gives a good lesson on why you shouldn't have hate in your heart.  I'm not sure what else to write.  The movie leaves me partly speechless.  Most of it paled in comparison to the meetings the boys had and then at a certain point I figured out what was going to happen and dreaded it (at about 16 minutes left).

It plays out all sides of emotions of people who were there who ignored what was going on either by choice or by naivet or tender age, or as we all saw it (through of us in America) that the non-Jewish Germans were all hard core sadists committing acts of atrocity as though they loved it and had inherent evil, or were afraid of reprisals and followed it anyway. We all ask ourselves what would we have done? Would we do whatever it took on either side to survive? Would we have committed atrocities to survive? What would we have done? How far would we go? From both sides of the coin? We would like to believe we would have helped the Jews and brave the German reprisals despite the consequences. In France would we have been part of the resistance? Would we have moved to a neutral country? I would like to believe we would do something courageous. We could look at Afghanistan and the continued practice of genocide for years and the Taliban's continued terrorism and how much have we helped? I know my son has been there & in Iraq in the Marines, and I still can't say if we are helping enough. Or we could ask ourselves why this has gone on and on. What is the saying about 'all it takes for evil to grow is that good men do nothing'? I know that is not the quote but something like that. Hugely sad ending, but if were true, I bet the father would take a second look at his actions and observation of atrocities going on around him with a less that blind eye from that point on......................",1425427200,,1606,4.321192052980132

Your drawn into the film through two boys. Two boys with very different lives. One completely naive filled with innocence. The other, his innocence has been stripped away from him. Opening his eyes to a cold hard reality. Watching the relationship between the boys is what makes this movie tick. I won't go any more details as not to give anything away.

3750042,5,B001PMR2KS,"I borrowed this movie, and the book by the same title, from the library, and I knew I wanted to own both of them. I liked that two young boys became good friends; particularly two young boys who, by virtue of their respective ancestries, were not only supposed to NOT be friends, but were supposed to hate each other. Bruno wasn't very attentive during his lessons from the Herr Liszt, and that, coupled with his only being eight years old, resulted in his retaining a certain degree of innocence, and in making (according to the book) a best friend for life. Bruno and his dad are polar opposites with regard to their personalities. Bruno's dad is a sadist toward the Jews, as evidenced in at least two movie scenes; whereas Bruno is compassionate and sensitive toward his friend, Shmuel, and also toward an older man by the name of Pavel, who also helps him at one point.

Very few stories have angered me as much as this one; though the anger I feel is more along the lines of righteous indignation over what was done to the Jewish people. I'm part German, though, for a time after watching this movie, and reading the book, I was disgusted to have any German ancestry. However, it would be wrong for me to continue to have that attitude; because not every German citizen agrees with what the Nazis did; just like not every Muslim agrees with what the terrorists did; and neither does every citizen of Japan agree with the bombing of Pearl Harbor.",1421107200,,1450,4.555555555555555

The son of the concentration camps commandant befriends a Jewish intern and it develops into quit a friendship. His parents never know what the child is doing until the very end of the movie when the mother wants no more of her husbands life and wants to take the kids back to Berlin. The young boy tells the Jewish boy to bring him some of what he thinks are the Striped Pajamas and tells him that he will help him find his father. Not knowing what is inside the wire or that the Jewish boys family has already been put to death, he enters the camp with the other boy and soon finds himself being led to the gas cambers.

For one thing, there is no way a boy would be sitting by the edge of a concentration camp with little German patrolling of the perimeter. Aside from that factoid, the fact that most of the actors are English detracts from the reality of the acting. While English actors and actresses would work in the 1950's, not so today.

That is the beauty of this movie. The main character is a young boy from a wealthy family. He does not understand that his father is in charge of a concentration camp. We learn all about his family and what happens when people disagree with them. (Note: The sudden elimination of the grandmother.) Young children do not understand prejudice. That is a central theme here. The young boy in the camp also feels the same way. The complete innocence of the young boys is what makes this film so remarkable.

You could apply this same scenario and replace the Germans then hatred for the Jews with any other, whether it be race, religion, political party, sexual orientation, or just about any other reason we can conjure up to hate each other.

The innocence of children who haven't yet been taught to hate, or even see that someone else is ""different"" is refreshing.  The ending of the movie is horrendous, yet somehow I took the slightest bit of satisfaction from the gravity of the situation towards the perpetrators.

The premise reminds me of the words from a song in South Pacific:  ""You've got to be taught before it's too late, before you are six, or seven, or eight, to hate all the people your relatives hate, you've got to be carefully taught"".",1419379200,,844,4.7534246575342465

3750215,1,B001PMR2KS,"There are so many incredible true stories from the Holocaust, making this fictional one filled with inaccuracies too hard for me to swallow. It is unfathomable that a child of Bruno's age who was the son of a high-ranking Nazi officer did not know about Jews; he would have been precisely the target of Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda, which would have surrounded him for his entire life. Furthermore, his mother's portrait as an innocent who had no idea of what was going on in the concentration camp where they lived is completely unbelievable. Nazi women were typically co-perpetrators of Holocaust crimes, and she most certainly would have shared in her husband's hatred of Jews.

If you are looking for a film about the Holocaust that has historical integrity, watch ""The Piano"", ""Schindler's List"", or ""Life is Beautiful"". Or, better yet, watch any of the fantastic documentaries available - truth is much more important than fiction when it comes to this important topic.",1417564800,11,975,5.055900621118012
3750216,5,B001PMR2KS,"This movie takes you inside the household of a high ranking SS officer, who has moved his family into a house near a concentration camp.  The officer's little boy is intrigued by what he thinks is some kind of farm nearby, and he goes there to see it.  He meets a little Jewish boy his own age, and thru the fence they become friends.  The officer's son doesn't really know what they do in the camp, and he keeps returning to see the little boy and play checkers or whatever they can.  The movie shows how the wife of the officer reacts when she realizes what the camp is, and how the teenaged daughter reacts.  The officer follows his orders.  Until one day their little boy can't be found, and they realize he has gone to the camp.  They all race there, trying to find him.  He thought it great fun to put on a pair of 'striped pajamas' like his friend wears, and he gets swallowed up in a crowd of Jews being hurried into a big building ...",1417564800,,943,4.2

It is a gripping drama with the young actor (Asa Butterfield) who portrays the main character (Bruno) giving a master performance.

It was an interesting take on the Nazi German family to have them well-dressed, colorful, speaking British English, praying to a Christian God, and seeming very much like an average White family.  For the most part, the film seemed a little too ""pretty"" for the content, but the twist was the payoff.  This would be a good conversation starter for young ones.

Other reviewers here have said that this is not historically accurate and some have said that it should not be shown in the classroom because of this. I would encourage you to look past the historical inaccuracies and realize that the movie and the book are showing the psychological and emotional atrocities that human nature can produce. For teachers reluctant to show this in a classroom because of it's historical inaccuracies, I would explain it just as I have here before showing the film.
It is correct that families of soldiers did not live next to concentration camps. However, they are there to help tell the story in the innocent eyes of a child. It is a literary technique that works very well here and I believe the story was well written and the actors did an amazing job.",1412467200,,960,4.587209302325581

Also don't miss the exquisite talent of the incredible Vera Farmiga who played his mother.  Her performance in the last scene at the very end of the movie took my breath away.

3750497,4,B001PMR2KS,"If you want more intellectual understanding of the culture of fear, propaganda ,misdirection, fanaticism and acceptance of terrorizing acts beneath a slimed veneer of success in this period of history of Nazi Germany, I'm sure there are many venues, but this little story has everything in it if you are alert and observant.
  I was charmed by the title; ""pajamas"" as comforting euphemism for the horror of dehumanizing camps; the meeting of two young  boys in the midst of chaos gives it a sheen of redemption; and the synopsis "" whose friendship has unintended consequences.."" a big breath of hope.  I don't usually write reviews unless very moved, especially if others have well written analyses and shared their feelings.  In this case, the brief reviews still made it seem mild, to me.
  But I must warn you, despite the protagonist being an 8 year old boy,this is in no way for children.  Perhaps  if your family is interested and informed about the rise of Naziism in a very despondent German economy, and how Hitler carefully picked innocent ""enemies of the state"" and how people  managed to avoid information about the exterminations, then it could be understood.  It is extremely well acted; beautifully filmed, and written so that it seems  every viewpoint and awareness level is represented. The timeframe of the story in film format seems condensed at the finality; but it really shapes nicely.
  It opens with the German officer father of the family being promoted as supervisor of a countryside Crematorium, although this information is carefully withheld.  There is a very revealing frisson between this officer and his mother at the celebratory party.
His father and he, however, seem of a similar emotional mold.  The family must move from  a beautiful home in beautiful and culturally appealing Berlin to miles away in the country into a house that really yells of the inhumanity and precise coldness of the job the father  must supervise and improve.  The pre-adolescent daughter copes by putting away her dolls, embracing the party line, developing a crush,and moving toward becoming a Hitler Youth; the 8 year old boy, at first bored, follows his natural bent, and begins exploring, eventually finding his way to the ""farm"" - the camp (and crematorium), where he meets ""Schmuel"" another 8 year old boy. who, in many of his actions and observations seems more mature and brave than he.
  Their interactions, which must stay hidden from mum and dad, are so heartfully innocent, you feel a big breath of air.  In a moment of fear, the German boy brings harm to Schmuel, and feeling ashamed, wants to help make up for it.  The end of the story is nigh; he conceives of a way to help Schmuel, by getting IN to the camp to help find the latter's father who has disappeared.  The ruse of
another pair of ""pajamas"" makes a costume, and they are successfully seeking, when the warning horn goes off, rounding everyone up.  They are told they must undress and will be cleaned and showered.  By now, the mother, frantic to find her son, has interrupted
""an important meeting"" to get the father's help.  You are on the edge of your chair, tapping your foot; wondering can they, will they, make it in time?

Despite the father's ascendency, expertise and quick action, the very efficient actions he programmed have gone into action.  No, they can not make it in  time.

You are left with such an overwhelming sense of pathos for every single character, because violence harms the perpetrator as much as the victim, though in different ways.  I wondered, if I  were this boy's mother, what would I do?  Would it change me if I were the father; would I become harder, more angry, or perhaps commit suicide?  And  with what unbearable confusion must the daughter deal ?  The story ended when it should have ended, but it didn't end inside me.",1410998400,,3848,4.810975609756097

Just by knowing that the jewish people had no mother for comfort, no food to eat, and no hope for living, it just made me teary eyed the entire film.

He was VERY interested the ENTIRE time and sat there and watched the whole movie with out getting up once to do anything.  he had a couple of questions, of course, but he really liked it and said it was a good movie but a little sad....  if you have a child, grandchild etc.... that is intelligent enough to comprehend what is going on in this movie, it would be a great history lesson, with you explaining a few things at the end....",1409097600,,720,4.303703703703704

3750608,5,B001PMR2KS,"I'm still thinking about this movie days after I watched it. After his father, an SS officer, is reassigned, the family settles into the new house but Bruno struggles to adjust to having no friends, a tutor who ""brings schools to them"" and the ""strange farm workers"" he can see through the woods. Against his mother's wishes he sneaks out of the front yard (where he cannot catch glimpses of the concentration camp) and eventually finds a ""friend"" he can only talk through through the fence. He visits most days, bringing food with him, but since he's only 8, Bruno struggles to understand what the camp really is and why Shmuel doesn't want to play catch or anything, becoming more confused when he sees a film (propaganda) about such camps. Meanwhile, his older sister quickly embraces the new ideas their tutor and some of their fathers soldiers promote as their mother grows increasingly suspicious of what exactly is happening at the camp and wants to take the children away. The story is gripping with the different ""levels"" of knowing -- from the father who is an officer to the mother who doesn't want to see to Bruno who questions it all as he tries to understand how his friend can be ""the enemy."" More importantly the choices the adults have made, accepting, pretending to accept, or remaining in denial, play out toward a gripping final scene when a child finds the strength to keep a vow to his friend. Haunting, beautiful, and heart-wrenching all at once. Highly recommend.",1409011200,,1487,4.767441860465116

I feel robbed. It's like an artsy short film. Maybe something like this should remain in the isolation of film festivals and not be falsely advertised as an emotionally moving film.
British accents + unlikable characters + lack of character development + unrealistic scenario in Nazi concentration camp + tons of other problems = maybe I should've just watched Schindler's List or watched bad reality TV.

Afterwards, I looked at some photos as we were discussing the history with our pretty-young children, at which point I had to close the browser following maybe 3 or 4 photos. I fell apart when I saw a couple photos of the atrocities, which usually happens with a well done film. Point of the story: this film did not move me. My wife said, ""the ending was pretty cheesy.""

Since I play an active role as a volunteer with a homeless shelter - I have come to realize that some of the most intelligent individuals can fall to their knees in spite of the fact that they look down on another race.

My personal takeaway in watching this movie is to look at beliefs and choices through the eyes of a child.

With this view in mind, individuals are given the opportunity to lift another human being who has fallen to their knees based upon our commonalities vs. race based ideology which in this movie poignantly devalues the life of another human being.",1408406400,,821,4.609589041095891

The ironies at the conclusion of the film are almost overwhelming. It is not for the faint of heart nor for those shadowed in innocence.  It is a reverberating message of the true savagery  of all those who persecute the Jews today in the name of religion or state sponsored terror.

3750778,4,B001PMR2KS,"This is an Irish-English production of 2007, beautifully filmed in Hungary.  It is the story of an officer in the new Nazi regime in 1940's Berlin and surrounding countryside.  The book of the same name is meant to be a fable so any lack of resemblance to real German history is therefore to be excused.  It has sold over 3 million copies, meant to be a ""young adult"" book, and is clearly fiction.  Yet its Irish author Boyne has written it convincingly.

Our head officer, recently promoted to a labor camp commandant, has to leave a lovely villa in Berlin and decides to take his wife and family with him.  His newly assigned house is ridiculously close to the camp so the younger son Bruno, age 8, is slipping out the back garden to see what he can see.  He thinks he is an explorer.  He finds what he thinks is a strange farm where the farmers and the children wear striped pajamas.

Little does he realize that it is the labor camp his father runs nor does his quick mind ever seem to grasp that it is evil.  He is the son of a very important man of the party yet does not know what a Jew is, we are led to believe.

He and his older sister are not attending any school but just have an old male tutor come twice a week to teach Nazi history.  Very odd for a family of this standing!  They have no playmates; the older sister's role is that of a preteen falling for a young Nazi assistant officer's charms and the spell of the Nazi movement and BDM for girls.

Nonetheless let us not quibble. Bruno makes friends with a Jewish boy, also 8,named Schmuel, who is hiding behind a pile of lumber at this labor camp.  They begin to talk and know each other.  Neither has ever heard the other's name before and finds the other's name absurd.  Yet Schmuel speaks German and probably had a very German life before 1940.  HE was probably called Samuel or some such equivalent.  Both boys are excellent in their parts, especially Asa Butterfield as the Nazis' son, with his intensity of emotions and big blue eyes.

The Kommandant's wife is outraged when she realizes the extent to which her nation's new regime is intent on eliminating Jews.  She had mentally accepted labor camps, but not death camps, until the stench of the ovens' smoke reached her in her new home.  She makes a strange remark about another boy's mother not having any say about the political affiliation of the family.

For those who have studied Nazi ideology, the women were clearly not considered in any way serious members of the party, only to be married to them and support them with housework and home comforts and so on.  To discuss and know what their government was doing to them, to their children, to their neighbors and friends, to Jews and Gypsies and homosexuals - that was not the province of women.

The boys meet often and things evolve then escalate to tragedy.  For those details, read the book or see the film.

What is a viewer to think of the shocking ending?  I am not sure at all even knowing a lot about those times.  That the death of a German, inadvertantly killed amongst Jews, is more shocking and penetrating to the heart, than the murder of millions?  Some would say that is the basic storyline.

I was not so surprised as others seemed to be at the ending.

It is a fable after all.

I think the power of these WWII stories are diminishing as time moves forward.  So much else has happened in USSR and in China, North Korea,Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, and now all the Middle Eastern nations in chaos, etc etc.

Other stories of other nations should be told, perhaps even compared, so that ""young adults"" can learn to analyze.",1407456000,,3622,4.4363636363636365

He kept from his family what the assignment was all about, even his wife doesn't seem to know they are moving so he can command a concentration camp, until they are there and the boy asks some pointed questions about the ""farm"".

As a history fan, it's always interesting to see things from a different point of view, in this case from the eyes of the commandant's son and his innocent relationship with a Jewish boy who is a prisoner.  You get some insight into the commandant's life and his wife, their different beliefs, but the ironic twist at the end was satisfying.

The courage of these children to violate the rules while just being boys tugs at your heartstrings, and their innocence in the face of such terror leaves you wondering if it is possible in such circumstances for kids to reach across the fence that separates them and see each other as friends and in that excitement that only children can have be oblivious to what is really going on around them. The casting of the actors is superb. The sets so compelling they make you believe it is real. It is astonishingly well done.

Anyway, I came to this film knowing nothing about the book, nor the plot. That's certainly the best way to approach it, and I will offer no spoilers to ruin that.

I do not think this film does the book any justice. It would have been nice of they actually went to a concentration camp and made their film more like actual events. The size of the camp in the field seems very small compared to what they were. And what happened to blonde hair and blue eyes? The history and true facts of the world war during the rise of Hitler are not correctly represented in this movie.

I would say this movie is a spin off of some very small factual data than an accurate representation of the book. I was highly disappointed and wanted to stop watching it after 15 minutes but promised myself to finish it to the end. If you are looking for an accurate or even close to accurate rendition, this is not the movie. If you are vaguely familiar with true historical events, you will be disappointed by this film.

A good friend had been on me to watch this movie for some time.  I resisted, probably because of the title of the movie: it didn't sound all that interesting.  But, after a recent visit with him. where we tried to view the movie on Netflix but had an audio problem, I ordered the DVD.  As soon as it arrived, I popped it into my Blu-ray player.  I won't divulge anything about the plot, other than to say the movie is set in World War II German occupied lands, touches on one of the darkest times in human history, and concerns an unlikely friendship between two young boys.

All the actors speak with a British accent, which might seem a bit odd, since it's not what a person might expect from these characters.  But it was a very minor distraction, since the story grabbed me right from the start.  The acting is top-notch and the quality of the DVD was excellent. 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' proves you don't need special effects to make an amazing movie. I always enjoy viewing a 'Making Of' special feature, to gain insight into the creation of the movie, and was happy one was included with this DVD.  All of the major players contributed to it.

I don't know this movie's rating, but I truly believe that it ought to be required viewing for every Middle or High School student before they are allowed to graduate.  History had a tendency to repeat itself, if we don't stop it.",1405036800,,1404,4.403100775193798

I wish everyone would watch it with open hearts. I have watched it four times, and I know it will never leave my film library.

The worst kind.

I would highly recommend this movie for those who like a wonderful, touching story about this time.  Another similar film is ""Lore"" which looks at the children of German officers of the Third Reich.",1402444800,,562,4.802083333333333

  This movie was a very sad movie, because it brought to view what took place in the war in Germany!!!!!
 Although the movie does not claim to be a true story!!!!! But still it still tells truths that had happened to the Jewish people!!!!! It is all history now and what Germany did was so very sinful, disgraceful, cruel, and down right evil!!!!
 But we human beings all over this planet earth are cruel and evil to each other when we begin to think we are better than another race!!!!
 We have no respect for each other, nor do we have respect for the Animals that GOD MADE!!!! such CRUELITY!!!!
 But when people want to say there is no GOD-THE CREATOR and put satan's ideals and lie into everything THEN TRUE GODLY LOVE IS shoved to the back ground!!!!!
 A movie like this shows not every German felt that hatred towards their fellow mankind!!!!!
 There is GOOD, LOVE, KINDNESS, RESPECT  IN EVERY RACE!!!!!
 JUST as there is Hatred, Evil, Lack of Love and Lack of Respect in EVERY RACE!!!!
  In This Movie It Showed how hatred runs down thur families that will not put themselves in the same positions as those they hated!!!! Just as the husband hated the Jews because his dad did! But his own mother did not feel the same way as her husband! And even in her death he disrespected her!!!!!  And then when his wife actually saw how cruel they were being treated in her own home, she started thinking and how hard her husband was becoming!!!! It was the remark[about them stinking even worst-when he looked up at the smoke in the air from the Jews being burnt] of the German man that was there taking care of things for them, how he talked about the Jews and how he acted towards them! And  how her own daughter was talking and  acting when homeschooled by a German teacher, her daughter was changing, and not for the better!!!! Oh this was a very sad movie!!!!
 It makes you think about yourself in how you would treat a different race other than your own?
 If we do not believe GOD MADE MANKIND, nor there is not devil[satan] then he keeps our eyes and heart believing in his evil hateful ways as well!!!!!! MANKIND CAME FROM THE CREATOR GOD and then Adam chose to disobey GOD for the love of his wife and ate of the forbidden fruit, then we human beings develoved a sinful nature!!!!
 If people can not believe we can be so cruel and hateful as this picture shows, then somebody needs to check out history from BIBLE Times to Now and see how wicked and evil and unloving  mankind has been and is still!
 Well in this movie it gives the true point of it all!!!!!  FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE END!!!!
A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!  I PRAY Hearts  are changed because of it for the better!!!!  Polar 2

3751213,5,B001PMR2KS,"""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is atypical of a holocaust film in that it is told primarily through the eyes of Bruno, the eight-year-old son of a German soldier. When we first meet Bruno and his family, they are living a seemingly happy life in Berlin. However, when Bruno's father receives a promotion, they move to a farm in the countryside, next to what we soon discover is a concentration camp. His father has been chosen as commandant of that camp.

Unlike in Berlin, where Bruno had multiple playmates and was free to run around with them, in the country he is alone (except for his family) and confined to their yard. However, a born adventurer, he finds a way to escape his yard and is soon at the perimeter of the concentration camp, where he meets a youth of his age, a boy who (as Bruno sees it) wears striped pajamas.

The film does an extremely effective job of showing us this segment of the world through the eyes and thought-patterns of an eight-year-old child, a child who wants to believe that his father is a good man, even a hero, but who can't quite square this with what he sees, as he witnesses the ""farmers"" on the other side of the fence working in their ""pajamas,"" as he watches the smoke from the chimneys inside the camp and smells the putrid odor they give off, and as he learns from his ""playmate"" about the people in the camp who have mysteriously disappeared.

Even in his home he receives conflicting messages. His father and mother both show love and affection to him; yet, his father and the solider boyfriend of his older sister treat with contempt the Jewish concentration-camp inmate who must work long hours for them while having almost nothing to eat, and who is severely beaten for the smallest infraction.

To the end, Bruno seemingly ignores the obvious, or, perhaps better put, tries to square the discordant data with a positive assessment of the life of the people on the other side of the fence, including the boy in the striped pajamas. Even though Bruno is just eight years old, one might wonder how he could continue to turn a blind eye toward the unmistakable horror of what is going on. In a sense, Bruno becomes a metaphor for the German people of the Nazi era, many of whom ignored as best they could what was happening and reinterpreted the data in a way that permitted them to claim ignorance.",1384819200,3,2352,4.540094339622642

3751226,2,B001PMR2KS,"This review will contain potential spoilers throughout. That's fair warning for anyone who hasn't seen it because this movie is impossible to discuss without referring to the events.

It is my opinion that Viktor Frankl would be displeased. An eminent psychologist who survived three concentration camps, he hypothesized the ""meaning-drive"" and an existential approach to therapy that would deal with it. He wrote frequently about the human need and capacity to create meaning in any situation, no matter how horrid. Of course he wrote extensively on Holocaust experiences to defend his views.

From that standpoint, I think this movie is a complete failure. What are we ultimately to learn? Frankl himself believed the task of great fiction was to help us interpret the meanings of the unique conditions of each individual. So let us take each individual in the movie.

We have ""Kurt,"" the soldier who's sent to the front lines for not reporting his father, yet he learns nothing in the movie. He's horrid straight up until his disappearance, lest we're to interpret his tousling of Bruno's hair as a transformation. There's Bruno's sister who falls victim to propaganda and has nothing more than minor emotional reactions to any event of the film aside from the ending.

There are Bruno's parents. The father who acts as if he's been completely brainwashed. He has one line about ""sometimes you have to do things you don't want to,"" and there's no evidence he's referring to the atrocities he's committing. Other than that, he's emotionless throughout. We see him as a true fundamentalist authoritarian without a thought in his head or a conscience anywhere in sight. His final look of the film is simply one of surprise, and I'm still not sure he learned anything. The mother is utterly useless. She's caught between not seeming disloyal so that her horror show of a husband won't report her to the authorities, and the eventual revelations she suffers which cause her to snipe at him from across the table. There's no growth here either.

This brings us to the heart of the film: Bruno and Schmuel. They're both innocent. Neither of them ever learns anything about their situation. Bruno at best questions the wisdom of his tutor or the ethics of his father once or twice, but neither of those are pursued as even side-stories. Then they both die.

Ultimately this brings us to the question of what have we gained from this experience? None of the characters have gained anything. If they ever do, it occurs after the movie which doesn't count in terms of the story. Write about the change of the character(s) is storytelling 101. As a viewer, it could be a revenge plot. Does the father deserve the suffering inflicted upon him, and does Bruno deserve to die to enact it? That's awfully fatalistic and cynical though, and Frankl's point was that we can find meaning in any individual experience no matter how horrible. Friendship prevails to the end? Children are naive? There is simply no depth to be applied here.

We don't need to know that the Holocaust was horrible. Anyone who needs to be informed of that won't learn it from this movie. So at the end of the day the film is emotional, jarring, shocking, and any number of the numerous adjectives used to describe it, but it fails as the meaningful interpretation of an individual life. In that sense it lets down both the viewer, and someone who I think is one of the greatest minds to survive the Holocaust.",1381017600,4,3470,4.831649831649831

3751233,5,B001PMR2KS,"This film gave insight to the innocents of children, whether Jew or (in the case of this film) Catholic.

Even if the German/European non-Jew citizen had known, what could they have done to stop Hitler's Final Solution?  The father's intensified hatred toward the Jews moved forward with such chaotic speed, he could never have known its impactful devastation, unless, of course, it was to jackknife into his own family.",1378425600,,509,4.9186046511627906
3751234,3,B001PMR2KS,"As a movie and work of fiction, I think this movie was a good movie if you don't take history into account.  It was a little slow in parts, but overall the movie was engaging.  If I was only judging the movie based on its merit as a movie, I would rate it 4 stars.  However when a story regards a very important part of history, I don't think you can look at them separately.  You have to look at how closely to history the movie comes to representing the era about which it is written.  Sadly this movie is all fiction.

Because of Bruno's naivety as well as Shmuel's, I don't find the story plausible.  I also find it offensive that it could convey the message that it would be easy for a German to form a friendship with a Jew in a concentration camp.  Historically German males were indoctrinated through Hitler Youth at very young ages, and they would not be ignorant on the subject of the Jew especially at Bruno's age.  I'm also pretty sure that Jews knew that death surrounded them and a 8-year-old Jewish boy in a concentration camp would be wise beyond his years.  He would know that his father was gassed or burned.  He would not be able to sneak off by himself to strike up a friendship with a German boy.  Officers would have been overseeing all of the population at the concentration camp, so I don't think anyone would be able to go off by themselves. I would imagine that SS officers patrolled the entire fenceline to ensure it was protected, so Bruno digging under the fenceline would never happen.  There are just too many holes in the story to make it believable.

I think it's a nice try by the author to create an alternate reality so to speak.  A what if ___ happened?  But no matter what fairy tale story you want to make, there is just no way this could have happened.  In some ways it is like the author is desperately trying to make an atrocity have a human element to it.  An innocence that has never been substantiated by history.  No matter how much you want to believe that one human group could never do something this inhumane to another human group, sadly it does happen.  It has happened.  We must learn from history, so history does not repeat itself.  But trying to rewrite history by changing the Nazi mindset to include innocence of the German youth is not only untrue but offensive to the millions of Jews who died by Nazi hands.",1378425600,4,2368,4.37070938215103

3751287,5,B001PMR2KS,"my grandmother saw her parents and many others lined up and shot by a Nazi death squad. of course I thought about her the whole time I watched this, she was only a little girl around the same age as Shmuel. I honestly don't think she would be able to stomach watching this film as it would be more traumatic than most of the footage from the Holocaust and other films we have seen. because she lost her childhood and innocence and lived through the war as one so young, I believe this would simply be too much for her. but not for the rest of us. I'd never even heard of this story, the book or the movie. it came up randomly on my list of recommendations and my cat accidentally pressed the play button with his paw as I was about to watch something else (I often find WWII movies completely cliche and poorly portrayed) I'm pretty sure I was *meant* to watch this beautiful movie. ALL of the cast and supporting actors were superb. Vera Farmiga as the mom was just a joy to watch. clearly Bruno was his mother's son while Gretel was her father's daughter, down to their physical characteristics I felt that was made quite clear from the start.

this movie is wonderful on so many levels, aside from the eloquent story it is quite amazing down to the last detail. having grown up in Eastern Europe I can say that I felt quite 'at home' with the chosen location and small details. I was very happy to see the story juxtaposed against every day life of the German family who lived comfortably, ate and dressed well and the like while mere miles away people were undergoing unspeakable horrors. as to the criticism of the boys naivete, I can understand but feel that people are dwelling on this in a manner that shows their own lack of understanding and cynicism. how can an 8 year old possibly comprehend such things? I was younger than that when my family had to sit me down and explain that I was a jew. what they said made absolutely no sense (even though I knew I was different) kids were of course propagandized and taught every form of anti-semitism from a young age, but this varied from place to place, family to family. some kids played together with no real strife or tension until the war escalated. kids were not walking around with iPads and smart phones, tweeting to their friends or playing with their Xbox. those kids were beautifully naive and innocent compared to many of our children who take the stance of a young adult before they understand anything whatsoever.

lastly, everyone who sees this film needs to picture millions of Shmuels (that child actor's face was so painfully honest and real) these were people from every corner of europe, with extended families. think of all the mothers and fathers of all the Shmuels who were tortured and sacrificed...for nothing. think of the Polish, german, hungarian and other citizens going about their daily lives while jews lived in filth, beaten and murdered daily. this movie encapsulates all of that and so much more.",1368316800,,2986,4.558659217877095
3751288,2,B001PMR2KS,"This film was really pretty good, but it has some problems I couldn't get past. The first thing I found only slightly irritating is that it took a bit of time to get used to american and British actors playing Germans who spoke with a British accent. Not a major problem of course but none the less it was a little bit of an annoyance. Secondly, I am having a very hard time believing that such an event could have actually happened. Not knowing if this film is based on a true story or not had me wondering that if it did happen, how? There was some things that didn't make sense. For instance a German boy befriends a Jewish boy by secretly sneaking off from his home near a concentration camp where the Jewish boy was imprisoned. He goes to the site to see what it was really like there out of an adventurous spirit. Anyway the friendship that develops between these two boys happens in broad daylight, through a fence that is in plain view of risen guard shacks around the camp. The two play games like checkers, and the German boy brings food and often passes it through the fence to the Jewish boy. So it's very hard to swallow that no Nazi guard saw any of this at all and attempted to put a stop to it. The story as a whole only works if the situation is believable. But based on the very small concrete pile that was meant to hide the goings on between the two boys, it simply is not plausable that within the visual representation that this friendship could have ever happened. If it did and the story is true then the film fails to make the scenario believable. I also found it difficult to believe that this very intelligent German boy could remain so clueless about this camp and not at least know something very bad was going on in there. Basically though this film tells a much different story than other films about the Holocaust and it was very well acted and well made, and I was happy to see that there was nearly no violence in the entire film.",1367884800,2,1964,4.3108108108108105

3751291,5,B001PMR2KS,"I'm really SHOCKED right now.  Talk about a moving film.  More like soul-crushingly moving.  You know for years, ever since grade school in fact, I've often wondered if any such communication between the German and Jewish children actually took place in secret.  I think about these kind of things all the time.  Even during important history lessons- when I was supposed to be taking notes for an upcoming test, instead I spent my time daydreaming over scenarios nearly identical to the one portrayed in the Boy In the Striped Pajamas.

The greatest thing about being a child is that, they don't automatically hate what they don't understand.  Instead, children are, more times than not, curious and confused.  When a German kid takes a walk through the forest and finds a concentration camp victim around his age sitting alone and depressed, the two of them immediately hit off a wonderful friendship.  Curiosity gets the best of both children- the German boy doesn't understand why the Jewish boy on the other side of the electric fence can't come out to play, so initially he assumes the boy must be locked inside a playground and thinks he's lucky.  This is exactly what any child his age would think.  At least, I know *I* would have.  Children really do have more sense than adults whether intentional or not, and this movie shows a perfectly fine example.

As a 30-year old man myself, and I honestly don't want to turn this into a debate by any means, I have a difficult time believing grown men would actually think it's right to kill a group of others based on their religion.  I realize I'm too locked into the modern world to even comprehend what really occurred back in the early 40's other than what I've seen in movies and read in history books, but... grown men (German soldiers) that believe killing other human beings is actually right, and to not even give it a second thought?  I don't get it at all.

I will NOT spoil the ending and I really hope nobody else does either.  I don't even want to say whether it's a happy or sad ending.  Let's just say, it's totally shocking.  However, you can probably guess judging by the melodic and downbeat soundtrack that tends to focus around light orchestration and piano.

The one thing that confused me and perhaps I missed a crucial storyline element somewhere along the way (I admit, I often have a hard time focusing on the fine details) is why the entire German family has a British accent.  I imagine the British wouldn't care for this at all (especially the elderly) since it might paint a false view of the events that really happened during World War II.  In other words, the British accents might lead the more uninformed movie watchers out there to believe it was the British responsible for the war.  They should have focused the movie on actual Germans and their accents so there's no misunderstandings whatsoever.

Overall, a war movie focusing on a child's viewpoint.  Expect more emotions and less fighting.  That makes the Boy in the Striped Pajamas highly recommendable.",1367280000,,3050,4.729166666666667

Based on the moving and dramatic novel by John Boyne (most recommended you'll read the book first, equally excellent, before you get to the movie), this is the extraordinary tale of a small German eight-year old kid named Bruno, a kid full of curiosity and motivation that happens to live during one of the most horrible periods of time - that of the Second War World. One fateful day, Bruno moves to live with his family to a far away place, at least far away from his beloved Berlin, where he's leaving behind him his close friends and his former lifestyle. Now, desolated from any urban place known to Bruno, his new house is located near what he's mistaken to assume is a farm, a farm filled with strange inhabitants, all dressed in some kind of striped black and white pajamas, and all with a gloomy and rather sad look in their eyes. Bored with his new house which seem to be isolated from the real world, and having no new friends that he can visit nearby, Bruno decides to explore the vast 'farm' territory he can see in the distance from his bedroom window. One day, during one of his wanderings near the huge peculiar fence that separates his world from 'the other world' he sees a small boy, his age, sitting on the ground on the other side of the fence. This boy, Bruno guesses, is one of those 'farmers' dressed in the striped pajamas. From this point on in the story the two kids develop a most unusual and deep friendship, whose tragic consequences will be revealed just towards the end of the story.
The things here are more complicated than what they seem, considering the fact Bruno's father is no less than the threatening commander of the 'farm' - which is actually a death camp, one of those who sealed the miserable fate of the Jews victims during that horrible war... Bruno represents the childhood innocence still not destroyed, while his father - which Bruno adores, by the way - represents cruelty and terror, although of-course between the four walls of his home he's a most loyal, kind and loving husband and father to his two children, a girl and a boy. While Bruno's sister, Gretel, becomes a fan of the Nazis ideas, Bruno is not aware of the horrifying events that occur outside his world - and so, he brings some hope, ray of sunshine and laughter to the short life of poor Shmuel, who's one and only 'sin' is being born a Jew. For almost a year Bruno keeps on meeting with his new friend, until one day they both disappear... Leaving us only to imagine what were their last thoughts during their last minutes among the living.
This is one film that seems too tragic to be true, but as they say, the truth is sometimes crueler than imagination, and it's terrible to think this story could really happen in reality... What I liked especially here is the fact you get to hear the story of the Jewish biggest tragedy of all times from the perspective of an Ari boy, and that serves as a reminder to us that not all the people related to Nazis where vicious or  cruel; Sometimes they just happen to be relatives of the monsters called Nazis by chance, not really on their own will. As a proof to that, I found the scenes in which Bruno's mother fights with her husband about his controversial decision of moving to live near a death camp, really reliable and emotional, as I'm sure a lot of wives of these devils didn't reconcile with the fact their husbands are heartless murderers who are able of doing all the horrors in the world once they get an order. In my opinion, this movie gives you the lesson of what might happen when the two worlds - of healthy childhood and the other, of pure insanity and blood-spilling - are colliding. Indeed, more tragic results than what's happening here you won't get to find anywhere else.
I was more than impressed with the crew of wonderful actors, each one devoted to his/her role in the most convincing way. You'll be amazed at how people who lived among us not even one-hundred years ago yet, could lack humanity and compassion, like the Nazis were. A tearjerker all the way and extremely moving, this is a film not to be missed, always to remember and not forget. Grab a hold of it as fast as you can, and share the unbelievable love and harmony between two little boys, not so surprisingly very much alike despite the huge gap supposed to exist between them. Which goes to show the spirit can win all situations.",1366416000,2,4451,4.474784747847479

I suppose as others have said that it is true to form for those times, but I didn't like the ending.  They shouldn't have killed Jews but mroe than that they definitely should not have killed children.  If it wasn't for the acting I would have wanted to give it ""0"" stars.  I would have been angry had I gone to the theater and paid $18 to see this movie.  We saw it on tv and unfortunately stayed to the end.

What made it so powerful is its ability to successfully portray the Jews as ""other"" while making us all feel strongly for Bruno. The angst and stress the viewer feels is because it was ""our"" boy in that situation, not any of the others.

3751318,4,B001PMR2KS,"This is a film adaptation of a book of the same name by John Boyne.  Although completely fictional and highly improbable, the movie has a visceral punch that will literally knock the wind out of you.  Briefly, the movie is about a German family in which the father become the commandant of a Jewish concentration camp (in the book, the camp is identified as Auschwitz).  The story-line unfolds as though we are seeing the events happen through the wide-eyed naive eyes of Bruno, the eight-year-old son of the commandant.  Bruno quite accidentally forms an unknowing friendship with another 8 year old boy, but this boy, the boy in the striped pajamas on the other side of the fence, is a Jew. Bruno is completely ignorant of what is happening in the camp, which he believes to be a farm. When the commandant's wife realizes that the camp is a death camp, (apparently she too is blissfully unaware of the purpose of the camp), she has a falling out with her husband and demands to take the children away.  On the very day they are set to leave, events occur that lead to the climactic and sobering ending.

While thoroughly improbable in terms of the plot, in my opinion, this film still packs a powerful punch.  Critics, many of them Jewish critics, assailed this film for its improbability and for the naivete of the characters, in effect implying that the typical German citizens of the day did not know the meaning or intent of the death camps.  This is a valid criticism, but in the film's defence, this again is NAZI Germany seen through the eyes of a boy.  It is not meant to be a film that exposes all the evils of the Jewish Final Solution.  The film's ending is quite a bit different from the book's ending, but the effect is just as powerfully moving and sobering.

This film is definitely not suitable for children up to age 13.

I didn't benefit at all from this film. It was needlessly horrifying at the end. I gained nothing from this film. I already have lots of compassion for the suffering of others. I already know enough about the Holocaust. I already have seen enough kids die, working in medicine. I've seen enough pain, angst, suffering...

3751366,4,B001PMR2KS,"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a movie that starts out with an 8 year boy named Bruno. Bruno's family was living in Berlin during WWII. While Bruno and his 13 year old sister go to school, their father is a high ranking soldier in the Nazi army. As time goes on, Bruno's father gets a promotion and is forced to move to German countryside. As the family moves into their new house, Bruno is informed that he is to be confined in the small fenced area surrounding their house. As life calms down, from his window, Bruno sees what he believes to be a farm with a chimney which occasionally flares black smoke into the air. Bruno confronts his parent asking why everyone is wearing striped pajamas on the farm he can see from his window. Covering the truth, his parents say they don't know. Eventually curiosity overpowers Bruno as he heads out into the back yard to explore the farm. Bruno approaches the fence and we learn the so called farm is actually a concentration camp. Behind the fence Bruno meets an eight year old boy Jewish boy named Shmuel. As the story progresses, these two become friends and Bruno sneaks out every spare chance he has to meet his friend.

The positive
This was an interesting movie because of a few factors. Rather than being another story of a Jewish family undergoing WWII; this movie demonstrates the difficulties of a German family during the same period. The story was well planned out and made you think. The acting was good and made you want to see what was going to happen next.

The Negative
What I didn't like were some segments in the movie. The beginning was slow and only got to the point in the middle of the movie. A lot of scenes where dragged out too long. By this I mean that there were a lot of parts where you sat down and told yourself ""well"". Scenes lasted for minutes when the boys just sat down and looked at each other saying only a few words.

Overall this was a good movie to watch. It not only shows the perspective of the Jews but also the perspective of the Germans. In this story, Bruno is acting as humanity ignoring the evil right before his eyes. Many non - Jews during the Holocaust acted like Bruno ignoring the wicked truth that was displayed in front of them.",1353283200,,2230,4.407766990291262

3751368,4,B001PMR2KS,"Just echoing the sentiments of everyone else: it's a thought-provoking and emotional film, but not in the slightest historically accurate. Critics say that its fairytale plot over-simplifies/trivializes/commercially exploits the Holocaust; and that by allowing impossible events to take place or glossing over critical facts, less informed audiences might assume concentration camps weren't nearly as bad as they are.

Although I think the latter is an especially dangerous line to cross, I defend the film for what it is--the narrative of a sheltered boy. His innocence isn't meant to symbolize/defend people who pretend they didn't know what was happening at the time--his misinformation is just that of a child whose mother attempts to conceal the truth. After all, the movie is MEANT to exist through the naivete of a child's world.

If you want accuracy, go read a memoir instead of a fantastical distortion written in a few days by an author with no connection to the Holocaust--if you think the subject is too grim for fairytales, this might upset you. If you want tweens to understand that time period, I would rather recommend ""I Have Lived A Thousand Years""; this isn't the type of movie to learn from. Otherwise, ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"" is a must-watch emotional 'what-if' historical fiction with superb acting and character development.",1351728000,,1357,5.220183486238532

Bored with the lack of playmates, Bruno goes exploring and finds a boy in striped pyjamas on the other side of a high fence, and makes friends, with tragic consequences. The movie follows the basic tenet of the book, but differs on some minor points, (certainly, Shmuel looked less like a starved Jew than Bruno did).

3751384,5,B001PMR2KS,"""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is a superb, deeply moving film.  It tells the story of two boys who become friends, despite tremendous social and physical barriers.  The story is told from the point of view of Bruno, the eight-year-old son of an SS Officer.  When the family must move due to Father's work, Bruno meets Schmuel, a boy like him, who is also eight.  But why does Schmuel live on such a strange farm?  And why do the farmers all wear pyjamas?

The acting is superb.  Asa Butterfield's performance as Bruno is particularly memorable; his portrayal of an eight-year-old boy contains just the right amount of innocence.  David Thewlis is excellent as Father; he comes across as a gentle man, while simultaneously making us hate him.  And Vera Farmiga is very believable in her role as Mother, who always knows more than she lets on to Bruno, and probably more than she admits to herself.

The story is mainly told from Bruno's point of view.  Thus, most of the atrocities take place off-screen.  Still, the movie manages not to downplay the horror of the Holocaust.  The audience always knows what is really going on, at least if they have any familiarity with the history at all.  Somehow, the film manages to be deeply disturbing without being graphic at all.

As others have noted, the film is unrealistic.  The fence around camp, for instance, seems to be strangely unguarded.  However, unlike other Holocaust films such as Schindler's List, this movie does not aim for realism.  Instead, it is highly symbolic.  Symbols of the holocaust permeate the film.  In one scene, a pile of naked dolls invokes the images of the Holocaust that we have all seen (piles of hair, shoes, eyeglasses, corpses).  And the electric fence reminds us that, whatever barriers are created between different peoples, the innocence of children will always surmount them.  It feels almost like a parable or fable (it's short length is appropriate in this regard).  As such, the realism is sometimes sacrificed for the sake of the plot.  But if we can suspend our disbelief, the true horror of the Holocaust will become even more apparent.  The symbolism says everything; the whole message of the film is contained in one shot in which two characters hold hands.

Finally, I will offer my take on the age-appropriateness of the film.  Some people believe that this film is a good way to introduce kids to the Holocaust.  I disagree.  I think kids should first see real images of the Holocaust and learn the real history before viewing a work of fiction (especially one that does not aim for historical accuracy).  Since the atrocities normally take place off camera, and much of the plot is implied rather than overtly stated, I think it would only confuse kids who haven't already been introduced to the subject-matter.  That said, if kids do have a good understanding of the Holocaust already, I think they should view this film.  They will be disturbed by it, but that's exactly what any film about the Holocaust should do.

Overall, I highly recommend this film.  I think anyone old enough to have learned the history of the Holocaust should see it.  Literally, it's a story about two boys who become friends despite tremendous social and physical barriers.  But the image at the end reminds us that it stands for something much bigger, and of the millions of innocents who suffered a terrible fate.",1346630400,3,3394,4.801381692573402

3751390,5,B001PMR2KS,"This film is a prodigy of horror wrapped up in love and that horror destroys this love forever by making it eternal in death.

Two eight year old boys meet, one on the free side of the fence, the other one on the camp side of the fence of a ""work camp"" (a nice name indeed for a Konzentration Kamp) for Jews just when the final solution is introduced. In Germany

I will neglect the side of the Commandant of the camp who is a SS and yet also has a personal life, a wife, two children, parents, a father who is on the good side and a mother who is clearly critical. A promotion for a SS officer is to become a camp Commandant and do, under strict secrecy, what is expected from him: to build a better German nation without any Jews, and if possible a world in the image of that German nation.

The film shows very well how the whole ideology is built on propaganda, which is a pack of lies, or ,if you prefer a pack of lying wolves that are after you to get your souls down into hell, in the name of the Greater future of the German nation. There is not much to say about the details of that machine. The details are there, clear and obvious. No comment, just cry with rage at such dumb inhumanity, really for both sides, the German nation itself and their victims.

The film is a lot more interesting with the eight year old son of that SS Commandant who escapes from the home of Herr Kommandant to  explore the forest behind the mansion and come to the fence where he discovers an eight year old Jewish boy who is hungry and sad, Shmuel. Shmuel has nothing to learn about the life outside the camp, but the other boy, Bruno, has to discover what the camp is and that it is no YMCA simmer camp. That takes time and a treason in the middle, but boys will be boys and they will invent a project to come together. Since Shmuel cannot come to the outside why not Bruno going into the camp.

And that will be the drama. No survivors please with the final solution, and frankly it's better like that. Which of the two boys could have survived without being damaged for life, or till death ensues.

And the film can end on the tears of the mother and sister and on the despair of the SS Commandant of a father. We will not be given the logical end for him after such a tragedy. Death at times can be sweet and desirable.

This is a masterpiece of poignancy even if suspense (who cares about suspense in a subject we all know by heart and regret with all our hearts) is rather light because boys will be boys and boys have always been boys. And love, or call it friendship if you prefer being a prude, has no limits, no divides, no abyss in the middle. Love is unified by definition and love comes no matter what and is for life and death. Happy are those who can share a life full of discoveries and then a death full of satisfaction. I am afraid the two boys met in death with apprehension and fear but a lot of courage in their acceptance of that fate as being a fate in which they can hold hands, and they did, naked under the fumes of the death-inflicting shower.

3751399,4,B001PMR2KS,"It is quite possible that more has been written and filmed about The Holocaust than any other historical event. Not just in regard to hard research, but many of the world's finest novelists have fictionalized the story, film makers have touched upon the subject, playwrights, composers, painters and poets. If there has been a way to express the shock- and shock is an understatement in this case- it has been attempted.
 John Boyne, a gifted and now internationally known Irish author, wrote the book ""The Boy In The Striped Pajamas"" in about two weeks time. As he said, in order to maintain ""the voice,"" once he began he was afraid to stop. The same is true when reading it- we are compelled to continue and it is evident from early in the book that Boyne has disguised the terminal words so that it can apply to any and all of the other holocausts' that occurred prior to and after this one. In fact, only once does Boyne choose to use a ""telling"" word; on page 54 one of the officers says, ""Heil Hitler"" but then we are told that the boy assumed that this was like saying, ""Well, goodbye for now and have a pleasant afternoon.""
  Mark Herman, under the umbrella of both Miramax and BBC Films set forth to create this book effectively for film- a difficult task given that so much of the emotional swtruggle is internal and difficult to show on film, but he managed it and did so beautifully. Becauswe this film is in the smae catagoiry (in regard to quality) as ""Sophie's Choice"" I couldn't give it five stars- that doesn't mean that everyone shouldn't see this film. The small issues with the film are strongly outweighed by the genuis behind it- most of that genuis comes from the premise which leads us back to John Boyne.
 The boy, his name Bruno; his age eight and is able to say things with just his eyes that make the fiolm entiurely possible. Without Bruno (expeertly plkayed by Asa Butterfield) the filmn wouldnp;t work. His co -star, the nine yea old Schmuel on the other side of the fenvce ius played by Jack Scanlon who manages to exude sadnewss. The confussion that Bruno has regarding their situation is simply too complicated for Schmuel to explain. The finest performance in the film belongs to Vera Famiga, who plays Bruno's mother and wife to the Commandant at this camp. Like ""Sophies Choice"" and Meryl Streep's classic performance in that film, Farmiga builds and devlops over a period of ninety-three minutes until, at the apogee of the film we see her undderstanding reach fruition, just as the rain begins to fall. Her emotional breakdown at this point is raw, honest and something to which every parent can connect.
  The film score, composed and performed by James horner (""Titanic"") is a character unto itselfl
The entire score is based upon a simple piece he composed that sounds like a gentle folks song. It is diatonic and in three quarter time. He utilizes synthesiers as well as wind instruments to add omonious irony to his music (the synthesisisers were expertly prograqmmed by Ian Underwood and Aaron Martin; the music editor was Dick Bernstein. The score builds momentum and continues, often at battle with itself, disploaying conflict between the characters as well as the situation itself. The music reaches it end with the film on a perfect ubnison which echos, just as the movie does.
 The innocence and ignorance of this young boy is as critical to the brilliance of this work as the story of the Titanic. (I speak not just of Cameron's film, but Maury Yeston's musical, ""a Night to Remember"" and the three other films made between 1938 and 1984) Herin is a tool where the audience not only knows so much more than Bruno, but that we are anticipating the sadness that ends the film. So we are prepared to cry but when the end does come, it is so shockiung that we aren;t ablke to cry; it';s not possiblke, this ending, though we've taken every step with these two boys and, of courwe (nbecause of our knowledge of what really happened) we know all too well that the ending is quite feasible.
 This film is by no means a ""Sophie's Choice"" though the horror is just as shocking, but few situations in cinematic history have been able to achieve what ""Sophie's Choice"" did. Still, the two films use a similar foundation but are about very different things. Where the ending is horrifyingly shocking and, like  ""Sophie's Choice,"" completely unexpected (who in fact could have imagined an ending such as this one) the poignancy of ""The Boy In Striped Pajamas"" makes it impossible for this film- and the fame it will generate - to be satirized in any way. Because the innocence and ignorance, as a result of the way his parents have shielded Bruno, is a metaphor for the way in which the population who was aware of the death camps were inactive; complacent and how the same continues to occur day after day from the beginning of recorded time to the continued genocide in Darfur- the world's largest death camp- to which the UN has placed sanctions against while The full force of the American military tore apart Iraq in search of Weapons of Mass Destruction.
 The current political winds in the United States suggest that Gay Americans and Female Americans are just as vulnerable. All of these circumstances suggest that you could very well be next. John Boyne's book manages to suggest all of this is his two hundred page fable using a modicum of brilliantly chosen words. His ending:
 John Boyle has sub-titled his book, A Fable"" and it is. His final words are like a double edged sword:
 ""And that's the end of the story of Bruno and his family. Of course all of this
 happened a long time ago and nothing like that could ever happen again.
  Not in this day and age.""

The irony of this ending reminds us that this is a fable, but more so, it makes us stop and think of the responsibility that we all owe to anyone who has been maltreated, either in the form of Bruno, Anne Frank, Sophie Zawotoski or Carol Stewart, Amy Fitzpatrick, Dave Pelzer and the millions of others.
  As a parent I would have watched this film with both of my daughters as early as sixth grade. Perhaps earlier. Those things that they d0o not understand will gloss over them; they will ask the right questions at the right times and it would be very wise to prepare a parental lesson plan for this because our children must learn of the Hollocaust and by far, this is the best way to introduce it to them I've seem to date. After this, they can read Anne Frank's diary and collefctively with the schools curriculum, they can see. but as we all learneed from Jonathan Demme's ""silence of the Lambs"" what the film doesn;t show and is left for our minds to create is often more horrific than a John Carpenter slaher film.
  The filmn is not able to end with the same impact as the book, but the ending is still remarkably powerful, filled with painful irony and one image that we watch for a few moments longer than we wish to as we see that there really was no other way this story could end.",1339891200,,7009,4.578611332801277

3751404,3,B001PMR2KS,"I have read the book and now watched the movie and I felt the same way about both. It's okay. The story itself is really good, I think. The execution in both the book and movie is good overall, but flawed. I'll try to focus on the movie here. My main problem with the movie involves acting.

The boy who plays Shmuel is not great. Plus, they chose a boy with a chubby face to play a Jew in a concentration camp. Kind of odd. There was zero chemistry between Bruno and Shmuel. They're supposed to be best friends, but they seemed fairly indifferent to each other for the most part.

Bruno's mother and father, played by Vera Farmiga and David Thewlis, were by far the best part of this movie. I love Vera in just about everything and this was no exception. Perhaps if the young actors in this movie learn from these two, they'll become great actors someday.",1336953600,,856,4.34375
3751405,4,B001PMR2KS,"I'm very conflicted about this movie. For one thing, it's hard to see Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) playing an SS officer. Sure, he's cute little Bruno's father, and that voice is clearly the same one with which Lupin addressed Harry Potter. But he develops a rather hard edge as a necessary part of his job as Commander of a death camp. And his very handsome young driver (Henry Kingsmill, whom I KNOW I have seen somewhere before, but don't know where) also gets a pretty sharp edge, in part to compensate for an ""unpatriotic"" father who went to Switzerland at the time of the rise of the Nazis.

Bruno and his family lived in a perfectly marvelous old house in Berlin, where his family was obviously important. His parents tried to make ""moving to the country"" sound great when they went to put Father in charge of the ""work camp,"" which Bruno at first took to be a farm. It's strange, though, because all the farmers wear striped pajamas. The house is starkly modern, and I suspect brand new. But it's large and they have several servants, so what's the kid's problem? He's bored. He's even more bored when he finds that he and his older sister are to have a tutor instead of going out to school.

Bruno is terribly bored because he's not allowed to go beyond the front courtyard of their home, which is surrounded by a steel fence. Guarded by soldiers, presumably because his father is so important. He's not even supposed to be in the back yard, but he's a natural explorer, and so he explores, and discovers a window in a storage shed that gives him access to the wooded area behind the house. This in turn leads him to a tall fence strung with barbed wire, where near the fence sits a boy just his age who is named Shmuel. He'd never heard of anyone named Shmuel before, but then Shmuel had never heard of anyone named Bruno before, so they are even on that. Both being lonely, they make friends.

We who know what the camp was all about are aware that this friendship can be dangerous for both boys, but we're into the last 10 or 15 minutes of the film before we find out just how dangerous. Of course I'm not going to give it away. I'm just going to give it four stars.",1336867200,,2181,4.393564356435643

3751410,5,B001PMR2KS,"An SS Officer in Berlin receives a promotion and heads for the country to command a death camp. While the name of the death camp is not mentioned, the only death camp with four crematoriums was Auschwitz. His wife, daughter, and son come with him. The house chosen for the Commandant's family is a far stretch from the high society living in Berlin and the  ""help"" are Jews imprisoned in a close by camp. At first glance, Bruno, the 8-yr old son calls the camp a farm and proceeds to befriend an 8 yr old Jew named Smule while exploring. Through the electical fence they begin to communicate, both talking about their present environments. Gretl, the daughter, befriends a young SS soldier who brings her Nazi magazines which eventually cover the walls of her bedroom. Both Bruno and Gretl are tutored by an elder teacher who educates them on select German history. It is clear the Commandants wife, Else, just wants a good home for her family. One day the young SS soldier vaguely comments that the smell coming from the nearby Chimneys are Jews burning. Else is sickened by this admission and confronts her husband. Else represents the German polis that had no clue to the final solution and finds herself in a nation and a place she detests. She has ample compassion however to genuinely thank a prisoner who used to be a physician who took care of her son in a fall.

The Commandants mother, who vocally did not support the Hitler regime dies in a bombing campaign. The Fuhrer has sent a card of regret which lays on her corpse before being placed in the ground. Else motions to remove the card but her husband moves her hand away swiftly. Meanwhile, Bruno continues to bring food to Smule. One day to Bruno's surprise Smule is in his house cleaning glassware. They greet each other as friends and Smule is offered pastry. The young SS soldier comes in demanding where Smule got the pastry. Bruno did not back up his friend out of fear and Smule pays the price. The next time Bruno saw Smule he had an injury to his eye. To make up for the betrayal Bruno agrees to search for Smule's father who is missing. This event would have to happen quickly as Else persuaded her husband to let her take the children away from the camp. Bruno took a sandwich and headed for the camp. Smule gave Bruno a set of ""striped pajamas"" and Bruno came through the fence by digging a hole. The young boys go running thru the camp looking for Smule's father. In the midst of this it starts to rain and a group of men and boys are rounded up and taken to the fake shower room. Bruno and Smule are in this group. They are made to undress and are herded into the gas chamber. The gas chamber door is bolted shut. After about five minutes the verbal quakes are silenced. Meanwhile, Bruno's family searches vociferously in fear and eventually finds Bruno's clothes. Else is inconsolable. The Commandant runs through the camp but comes to the reality that Bruno, his son, was gassed. The Commandant's expression is trance-like as the rain pours down on his clean pressed SS uniform.",1336176000,,3058,4.548094373865699

But this is a part of history and it's unfortunate that the Germans of that era weren't all subjected to what this one man was.  The war against the Jews would have stopped overnight.  Actually the German boy gave his life to help his friend not understanding what it was all about.

3751413,5,B001PMR2KS,"This really was a very well-done film. However, it was extraordinarily depressing. That is how it should be, though; we are talking about the Holocaust. You really can't pretty it up, and you ought not to try. I read all the reviews before watching the film, which made the film less suspenseful, and not as dramatic. To get the full effect of the film (which I greatly advise), DO NOT continue reading. Spoilers, well, spoil the film a bit.
-------------------
SPOILER ALERT
----------------------------------
I'm not sure that the film is entirely possible. I doubt this ever actually happened, though I suppose it might have. But the story has a big impact. It touches on divisions between members of the family, and conflicts between German soldiers. It reminds the viewer that not all of Germany thought that what happened during the Holocaust was good, or even right. Then again, it also shows the viewer that the opposition did not have much of a voice. The government would quickly squash down any discontent. It also focuses a small amount on propoganda that was being fed to the German population, reminding them that the Jews were evil and responsible for the state of the nation (making the patriots happy), and cast a happy life on the 'work camps', painting them as lovely places with nice food, and sports (keeping the bleeding-heart critics happy). I think it was nice to include the real picture, as it gave credibility to the film. The German population really did have a real clue as to the horrors that went on in the camps right away. Once they realized, there was little anyone could do. The government control had grown too strong, and the people bowed beneath that control.",1334361600,,1697,4.835051546391752

3751417,2,B001PMR2KS,"I believe that there are plenty of true stories about the Holocaust that are riveting enough for the big screen. Why make one about a story that is so unrealistic? I don't often review movies so I hope the reader can forgive me for an incomplete and sub-par review but I just watched this movie and felt moved enough to share my thoughts.

First of all at the party with all the pomp and circumstance for the German commander when he gets promoted, would they be playing American Jazz? Were Nazi's big fans of the Jazz movement? I'm not even sure how music that 'jazzy' would have been recieved in the States for the time period, maybe I'm nit-picking there. Here is a quote from Wikipedia, took me 3 seconds to look up: ""The Nazi regime pursued and banned the broadcasting of jazz on German radio, partly because of its African roots and because many of the active jazz musicians were of Jewish origin; and partly due to the music's certain themes of individuality and freedom. For the Nazis, jazz was an especially threatening form of expression. An anti-jazz radio broadcast From the Cake Walk to Hot sought a deterrent effect with ""particularly insisting musical examples."" It's hard for me to believe at such an official and elegant party they would be playing jazz/swing music anywhere in the world, let alone Nazi Germany.

Secondly did children in concentration camps have time to lounge about? Were there large area of fence that were not under watch from some sort of guard on foot or tower? If someone were caught stealing they would just get hit in the face and told not to do it again?

Thirdly didn't the Nazi's tell relatives that they were gaurding over a prisoner camp, that the people in the camp were prisoners? It seems very unrealistic that the Grandparents would have the details that it was an extermination camp for Jews, from what I understand very few people knew beforehand exactaly what was going on and it was naturally someting that the Nazi's wanted to keep secret. I suppose a spouse of a commanding officer could have found out, but the whole way it came about in the movie seemed fake. Would the wife really have been shaken by the fact that there was a crematorium on the grounds and it was used on occasion? I would have liked to see someting a little more realistic; the husband arguing that they are prisoners and that a lot of people die in war time, maybe the wife buying that for a while and then confronting him when the creamatorium operates day and night and having her say how many criminals are there in Europe?

I know the film had an important message and a powerful ending, but I'm not happy that such liberties with reality were taken with this story.",1333238400,11,2701,4.58592132505176
3751418,3,B001PMR2KS,"I would not presume to give this movie a very thought provoking and long review, as it was this story was based on fiction.

I personally enjoyed this film, it warmed my heart in many many ways, including forcing me to think what if I were the one on either side of the fence. You have to put yourself outside the realm of reality when watching this film though and realize that what is going on is the author trying to emphasize the holocaust in a fictional manner as these personal events happening in the midst of a tragedy never occurred.

My criticism stems from the fact that there were so many family's, so many loved ones and so many lives involved in this human tragedy that the author could have easily written something of a true nature.. The author could have found many stories from true accounts or lets just say, for the sake of thought.. What if the film makers emphasized more that this was based on fiction and not almost sold this as real, I myself had to look this up to find the truth. I would have liked to see money put into a film telling one of the many many true to life stories that were and not a heartwarming story that yanks your heart at the end..

 Please do not get me wrong as this is a wonderful story that shows you the what if's of human tragedy but their is no evidence to support that something like this even remotely happened and I for one would like to be told if this were true from the beginning.. It seems that the film makers and author really want to sell you on this story to the point of neglecting to tell you that it is fiction with the only fact being what it is based around. I see nothing astounding in this work, just another film to make you cry so you may say ""BRAVO"" in the end

I would rather, make a suggestion... Watch ""The Island on Bird Street"", it is just as heartwarming (Maybe more) and based on a true story",1333238400,,1874,4.20891364902507

This revelation by Bruno drives the plot. His friendship with Shmuel grows into a strong bond, much closer than his relationship with his father, mother, or sister. Bruno sneaks out to see his friend, risks being caught - all the while he listens to his father's deceitful, self-righteous, dogmatic words about people in the camp. He draws his own conclusions. Bruno begins to see his own 'noble obligation' through the humble perspective of his close friend, a Jewish boy. He becomes our hero in the truest sense, because he does not accept the lies, deceit, hypocrisy, murderous intent, or tyranny of the Nazis and their judgement upon Jews. He makes up his own mind. He rises above the civilized evil presented to him - to go into the oven of death with his close friend. Bruno's sacrifice with Shmuel of life itself becomes a testament of will power and grace, apart from the horrors of the camp and its method of execution. As an audience, we grow in stature by witnessing this epic tragedy through the eyes of innocent children.

In this film we sense doom, dread, agony, hopelessness, and suffering beyond human comprehension. We know from ""Schindler's List"" and other concentration camp films - what awaits these inmates.

We are allowed to empathize with them, even as their friendship is separated by barbed wires and guard dogs; even as they await the executioner's death knoll together - which is a numbing thought in and of itself. Depth of character and plot are evenly pervasive. Dramatic irony is present as tyranny wears the mask of a somewhat civilized military officer with a somewhat normal family who ultimately must realize that he has unintentionally given the order to exterminate his own son.

3751427,5,B001PMR2KS,"I rented this through netflix and will be getting my own copy.  I didn't know anything about it.  It just seemed interesting.  As it's DVD only I'll urge them to move it to streaming so others might happen on it.

I grew deeply interested in the Holocaust maybe fifteen years ago while doing an edit on a friends novel, set in the time.  She wrote one chapter of the charaters ride in a boxcar to Auschwitz that I was reminded of each time one of the frequent freight trains passed by our house.  I knew of course what had happened before, but it personalized it, as one human beigns point of view, (especially since he knew what awaited them and many of the other didn't}  I started seeking out books written by survivors and the liberators and the ghastly black and white (later color) pictures took on a new life, about people.

This movie does the same.  I knew nothing about it but the short summary and wasn't sure what to expect, and was drawn in immedidatly.  Sure, there are inaccuracies.  The children would have been indoctrinated to a degree, the daughter most of all.  The boy is very much a child of war, witness the way his friends pretended a realistic view of how war is carried out.  And the husband, knowing his wife was uncertain and not completely patriotic, would have hid it better or been called and sent to the front himself.  But it isn't about that, its about the viseral experience.  When they arrive at the new house, with armed guards and a gate, when they see the stark almost prisonlike interior, you know what sort of a place they are.

Bruno is a dreamer, and dreamers tend to shut out certain perceptions.  And he's lonely.  His new friend knows what the place is, and spends time sitting alone.  Maybe in a different world they'd be very much alike.  And he still has his father.  You can see the panic starting to surface when his father dissapears.  The two boys make a connection through childhood with this magical spark.  Dreamers, in a harsh, terrible world, often pay the price of dreaming.

Not knowing anything about the end, I absolutely didn't expect it.  I was sure there would be *some* sort of reprieve.  It absolutely stunned me.  I would absolutely reccoment this film, but not for children.  But the end scene brings the body counts and the detains (portrayed VERY accurately) to a personal level.  They aren't statistics but real.

I have to wonder what happens to the family afterwards.  A commandant who allows that to happen would not be tolerated.  It would be too easy to figure out the mother was not a happy camper with the politics.  If your father leaving the counry gets you sent to the front, then what does this bring? That is the thing that works so well.  It makes me wonder, but its outside Bruno's knowing.  A mark of a good film is to keep you thinking after the end, but not going too far.

Absolutely deserves five stars.  I look forward to seeing it again, knowing, and see wht I pick up I didn't before.",1327104000,,2978,4.4888059701492535
3751428,5,B001PMR2KS,"I've watched many great film adaptations of books written about the Holocaust and how it affected all involved.  Yet, THE BOY IN THE STRIPPED PAJAMAS, was probably the most heart-breaking movie I've seen because it showed in chilling details how two young boys - one Jewish, one German, became innocent victims of Hitler's Nazis madness to exterminate Europe of non-Aryans.  The movie was all the more powerful and heart-wrenching in its portrayal of the hedonist perpetration of human extermination because the two main child characters [eight-year-old Shmuel, 'the boy in the stripped pajamas', and eight-year-old, Bruno 'the son of the Commandant responsible for the extermination camp were Shumel is held captive'] are exemplary in their roles of capturing children's naivety and inability to comprehend the unthinkable.

Other reviewers have written in great detail about the specifics of the plot.  It is multi-layered and complex, examining the the characters who portrayed participants and victims of a an evil event in recent history, and the effects it had on each.  Instead, I prefer to focus my comments on why I believe this movie is so important.

In my opinion, we underestimate the innocence of young children and their gullibility, their 'magical thinking' to believe in an idealistic world, and the pureness of their hearts to believe the best in their parents; failing to see, imagine, or comprehend any flaws. Even when young children are exposed to the 'worse' of abusive conditions, most don't grasp the depth of their circumstances.  For this reason [among others] children are easily manipulated to do what they are told by predators; coerced to believe in angels and gifts when they obey, or condemned to be tormented by monstrous demons if they don't comply.

Because of the subtleties in the manner the scenes are directed, rather than the 'overtness' obvious to us as adults, the dialogue between Bruno and Shumel made this movie all the more chilling to watch.  As viewers, we watch their friendship blossom knowing they have already become unsuspecting victims.  Through the innocent and loyal camaraderie that we witness between Bruno and Shumel - two 'sacrificial lambs' - we discover the unimaginable horror, power, magnitude, and atrocity of the Holocaust.

THE BOY IN THE STRIPPED PAJAMAS is a movie to be watched by families who have teenagers.  It is a film I'll long remember.

3751429,4,B001PMR2KS,"I've read the book upon which this movie is based, and also reviewed it. The book makes for a thoughtful discussion on the Holocaust, though it did have some problems having to do with plot implausibilities. Yet despite all of that, I did think the book added some value to novels dealing with the Holocaust, especially in portraying the story from the 8-year-old German Aryan boy's point of view.

Now on to the movie - the story follows the book closely with some adaptations. Set during WW II, 8-year-old German Aryan, Bruno finds his carefree life in Berlin is about to come to an end as his father [David Thelis] has been promoted to the position of Kommandant thus necessitating the family's move to a rural outpost which is nameless. So, Bruno [Asa Butterfield], his 12-year-old sister Gretel [Amber Beattie], mother [Vera Farmiga] and dad make the move. Bruno is initially not impressed with his new surroundings - there are no other houses nearby and the children are not able to attend school, taught instead by a bigoted old tutor who subscribes to Nazi ideology. Bruno in the meantime has discovered a 'farm' close by and to his immense delight, meets another 8-year-old boy with the curious name of Schmuel [Jack Scanlon] who seems to have tons of 'friends' and has the luxury of wearing 'pajamas' all day. Though he is forbidden to explore the back of the house, Bruno makes clandestine visits to his friend, who sadly cannot play with him as they are separated by a barbed wire fence, which Bruno thinks is to keep the animals out. The pair's friendship grows every day, and Bruno begins to learn some disturbing things, such as the ill-treatment of Jews. In the meantime, Bruno's mother Ilse [Vera Farmiga] begins to fall apart as she makes some horrific discoveries of her own. The rest of the story deals with what happens to Bruno and Schmuel.

There are some plot implausibilities - the fact that Bruno is so incredibly naive about Jews and the ideology of hatred against them is hard to accept if only because most German Aryan boys of Bruno's age would have been in the Hitler Youth and thus exposed to such teachings. Bruno being a high-ranking Nazi officer's son would most certainly have been in the Hitler Youth as would his sister. Also, Ilse's naivete seems implausible. As for Schmuel, most young children were immediately selected for the gas chambers upon arrival, and it seems almost miraculous that Schmuel survived for as long as he did, and was able to meet Bruno so often without detection.

But, implausibilities aside, I still liked this movie - it manages to portray the innocence of children in a depraved world so very credibly, and this is largely due to Asa Butterfield's amazing performance as the naive Bruno whose eyes are slowly 'opened' to the cruelty evident around him. Jack Scanlon's Schmuel is also credible -the chemistry between the two boys is very real, and their friendship is altogether believable. Vera Farmiga's performance as the tormented Ilse is the most powerful adult performance in this movie - she delivers a finely-nuanced performance that makes us believe Ilse was truly horrified by what was being done to the Jews. The other adult male characters delivered rather weak performances - David Thewlis as the Kommandant was stiff in his role and seemed ill at ease for the most part, the sadistic Nazi driver seemed very much a one-dimensional character, and even the Jewish houseworker was not given much character development.

All in all, ""Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" succeeds in getting under one's skin and doesn't cop out with a happily ever after ending, for the climax is brutal and mind-numbing. The child actors' powerful performances enables the movie to address questions about humanity and man's capacity for evil.",1326412800,4,3794,4.877519379844961

In part of the story the mother has to choose what she knows is right against her husband who runs the camp where they gas the jews.

The son innocent and slightly  confused about the camp and barbed wire and seeking adventure, strikes up a friendship with a little boy on the other side of the fence. Ultimately the son and the little boy die together in the gas chambers built by the father, when the Commandant's son tries to help the other boy find his father by sneaking under the barbed wire posing as an inmate.

3751438,1,B001PMR2KS,"Sorry, I am a military history fanatic and I watched this movie recently with my daughter.  It is an interesting story, but it's about as historically accurate as Peter Pan or The Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.  This movie is decently made, but, the story is complete fantasy and absolutely ludicrous.  This movie is so poor, it's an insult to the intelligence of anyone who's studied German concentration camps at all.  There are far too many historical errors in this movie to list here, but all I can say is this is a work of complete fantasy and fiction - the events portrayed in this film COULD NOT have occurred at ANY German concentration camp at any time.

If the point of this movie is to make children identify with the holocaust, which is what it would seem to be, the film makers have done an injustice to everyone concerned.  This goal could have been easily obtained, but instead, they just made up an absolutely ridiculous story with an equally ridiculous ending.

Sorry to all of those who loved this film, but I didn't find it moving or touching, I couldn't get past the absurdity of the entire film to connect with the ""moving"" story it was supposed to be conveying.

3751442,5,B001PMR2KS,"By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com

This emotionally wrenching film deserves 10 Stars. Changed my life forever and a major part of my life was spent in motion pictures. The movie will change your life everlastingly too if you open your heart to a simple fictional story of a little German boy who befriends a Jewish boy through the barbed wire fence of a concentration camp.

My heart was ripped out, but I will be a more loving, gracious, forgiving person for having seen this sensitive and also horrifying motion picture. YES, as the reviewers have said: It is ""historically inaccurate to the extreme."" ""It is total fiction."" It is ""ridiculously contrived."" It is ""all too absurd."" It is ""hard to swallow."" It is ""forced and artificial,"" and ""The actors have British accents instead of German.""

One critic posed the question, ""Did Bruno's father in the end get what he deserved?"" Such moralizing and such criticisms of the film make me wonder if those viewers of the film missed the unanswered questions of the Holocaust. How could it happen? How could so many good people allow it to happen?

The most insightful reviewer said, ""What is appalling to me is reading all of the one-star reviews. I now see how the holocaust (shoah) could have taken place. All that is necessary is for a nation to be composed of and ruled by people with no feelings, bereft of human compassion and sensitivity, just like several of the reviewers here.""

Great Art (even fiction) reveals to us ""things as they really are"". Through Bruno and his mother, we see through the eyes of Germans who were totally innocent until they came face to face with with the horrors of the ""final solution."" Most Europeans accepted the deportation of Jews, some not knowing what would be their fate and others even accepting the fate of Jews because it was so easy to blame Jewish Merchants and Jewish Bankers for World War 1 and for the collapse of the German economy. Savings were totally wiped out. It took 22 million German Marks to buy a loaf of bread. Though not the same, we can understand today how easy it would be to blame all Muslims for 9/11.

Through Bruno's sister we see how easy it was to indoctrinate an entire nation of German youth. A notable exception was the 17 year old Mormon boy, Helmuth Hubener, that resisted the 3rd Reich and was sentenced by a German Court for treason and beheaded by guillotine on October 27, 1942 at Pltzensee Prison in Berlin. (See his true story on Wikipedia!)

In this motion picture we see and learn how good men, good fathers, and good soldiers, putting military obedience ahead of even their mothers, wives and children, directed and became the executioners of millions of Jews. Even still photos of all the corpses, and eye witness accounts of the Holocaust do not give us that understanding.

Last, by identifying and seeing through the eyes of an innocent child, we learn from the film what it was like to be ordered into the gas chambers. No other motion picture, book, or document has ever, or ever will, capture that experience or the depth of those feelings like the film ""Boy in the Stripped Pajamas.""

Would that each viewer could become as a little child (Matthew 18:3), like Bruno, not judgmental, and not critical.  The Holocaust (like the film) is hard to believe but the gas chambers to kill and the ovens to burn bodies were real. I've seen them with my own eyes. I've been in the house made sacred by Anne Frank. My next door neighbor was one of the first U.S. soldiers into the Dachau Prison Camp, and my neighbor across the street served in the Danish Underground.

Let us resolve, NEVER AGAIN, not just in five languages, but in all the languages of the world. There were those in Germany that truly did not know what was happening to the Jews, but no other film answers for me how an entire nation could be led by one man to kill, or accept the killing, of so many. I will be forever haunted by the words, ""If he had been your Fuehrer, you would have followed him too.""  Although it is fiction, ""Boy In the Striped Pajamas"" reveals not the historical truth, but the TRUTH of Nazi Germany as it was.

FOOTNOTE: What follows regarding man's inhumanity to man is presented because HISTORY WILL REPEAT ITSELF IF WE DO NOT KNOW AND UNDERSTAND IT!

People today need to know that Hitler did not invent anti-semitism. It began with the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and has never ceased. It is mind boggling to learn that throughout history there have been innumerable and hundreds of attempts in many countries to kill all of the Jews. (See ""Pogroms"" on Google, then read the Wikipedia account.)

I was shocked beyond belief to read Martin Luther's anti Jewish sentiments published in 1543 (See ""On the Jews and Their Lies - Wikipedia""  Luther's feelings about the Jews and what should be done to them were as vile and reprehensible, as any words spoken in Nazi Germany. Indeed, Luther's document may have been the blueprint for the Nazi Holocaust.

Seeing history repeat itself so many times makes us wonder if there is hope to save the Jews and the world from so much hate and killing. Pope John VI in 1965 issued his historic ""Nostra Aetate"" that expresses understanding, forgiveness and love for the Jews and for all religions.  Pope John Paul VI states in this history changing document that the death of Christ, ""cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today."" The age old doctrine behind all of the Pogroms which stated that ""all Jews, past, present, and future were collectively guilty of the Crucifixion of Jesus,"" was officially revoked by a Catholic Pope! EVERYONE should read entirely the ""Nostra Aetate"" which is one of the most important documents in the history of mankind (It takes just a few minutes to read and can be found on Google)! The current Pope Benedict XVI who was forced to join the Hitler Youth as a child in Nazi Germany (in two books) has made a sweeping exoneration of the Jewish people for the death of Jesus Christ. There is hope for the world! These are history changing actions by two Catholic Popes. It would be well for everyone who wants the world to be a better place to thank Catholics for Pope John VI and Pope Benedict XVI.

We must be ever vigilant against condemning another. ""Therefore thou art inexcusable, Oh man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself: for thou that judgest doest the same things."" (Romans 2:1). Jews who migrated to Israel after World War 11, themselves committed a Holocaust of the Palestinian people. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed and nearly one million were forced into refugee camps. ""This is my Land. God gave this Land to me,"" was not justification for killing the Palestinians!

There is one notable voice in the Middle East that documents the atrocities by all three sides and seeks to reconcile Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Elias Chacour, a Palestinian Melkite Christian Priest has established a school in Ibillon near Galilee where Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Druze study side by side. More important than their secular studies, students learn to love their enemies. To bring peace to the Holy Land, Elias Chacour's book ""BLOOD BROTHERS"" SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR EVERYONE.

Two unsung and less known heroes of the Holocaust are Irena Sendler and Raoul Wallenberg. Their stories should be told along with the stories of Oskar Schindler, Corrie Ten Boom, and Anne Frank. Irena Sendler was a Polish Catholic Social worker who saved more than 2500 Jewish Children from the Warsaw Ghetto. If you have any interest in the Holocaust, YOU MUST READ the inspiring story ""Life in A Jar - The Irena Sendler Story"" on Google. In 2007 when Sendler was still alive, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Al Gore received the prize that year instead.

Raoul Wallenberg is credited with saving near 100,000 Hungarian Jews. At the peril of his life he defied the Nazis innumerable times. Read a summary of Wallenberg's unbelievable courage to save Hungarian Jews on Google: ""Profile of a Leader: The Wallenberg Effect."" See Wallenberg's complete story in the book ""Righteous Gentile"" available used from amazon.com from a number of book dealers for one cent plus $3.99 for shipping and handling.  EVERY reviewer gave the book 5 stars! Unlike Schindler, Wallenberg had only his humanity and no ulterior motive in saving Jews; and he probably saved more Jews than Schindler.

Few Motion pictures can compare to the book. The motion picture ""Wallenberg A Hero's Story"" is even equal to the book ""Righteous Gentile""! Both the book and the movie will lift your very being to heaven. Man at his best is so good, so noble, so Christlike, that we would fain throw a cover over men and women when they are less. Mankind needs Hero's like Wallenberg to lift and redeem us. It will make anyone a better person to make the book or the motion picture a part of their life.

See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.

It did a fantastic job of expressing Bruno's initial state of unawareness, and his journey to opening his young eyes and seeing that something is not right.

Bored with the lack of playmates, Bruno goes exploring and finds a boy in striped pyjamas on the other side of a high fence, and makes friends, with tragic consequences. The movie follows the basic tenet of the book, but differs on some minor points, (certainly, Shmuel looked less like a starved Jew than Bruno did) and I found the plummy English accent a little off-putting.

What was so interesting though was how each character in the film evolved.  Every character's story was told in detail, and the depth of their knowledge of the camp or their naive misconceptions growing to enlightenment was powerful. That evolution was beautifully portrayed by the actors.  The acting was incredible throughout, though I did find the accents of Brits playing German characters a bit distracting. As others have said the ending will leave you completely floored but it drives a stake into your heart of the insanity of the holocaust.

Yet despite all of that, I did think the book added some value to novels dealing with the Holocaust, especially in portraying the story from the 8-year-old German Aryan boy's point of view.

Now on to the movie - the story follows the book closely with some adaptations. Set during WW II, 8-year-old German Aryan, Bruno finds his carefree life in Berlin is about to come to an end as his father [David Thelis] has been promoted to the position of Kommandant thus necessitating the family's move to a rural outpost which is nameless. So, Bruno [Asa Butterfield], his 12-year-old sister Gretel [Amber Beattie], mother [Vera Farmiga] and dad make the move. Bruno is initially not impressed with his new surroundings - there are no other houses nearby and the children are not able to attend school, having to be taught by an old tutor who very much subscribes to Nazi ideology, pummeling the children with his ideology of hatred every chance he gets. Young Bruno in the meantime has discovered a 'farm' close by and to his immense delight, meets another 8-year-old boy with the curious name of Schmuel [Jack Scanlon] who seems to have tons of 'friends' and has the luxury of wearing 'pajamas' all day. Though he is forbidden to explore the back of the house, Bruno makes clandestine visits to his friend, who sadly cannot play with him as they are separated by a barbed wire fence, which Bruno thinks is to keep the animals out. The pairs friendship grows every day, and Bruno begins to discover certain things - that Jews are not treated well [he doesn't really buy the ""Jews are evil"" idea], and begins to see his father in a different light [the Kommandant keeps silent when a Jewish houseworker is pummeled by a sadistic Nazi underling]. In the meantime, Bruno's mother Ilse [Vera Farmiga] begins to fall apart as she comes to discover what really goes on in the camps [extermination of Jews] and suffers an emotional breakdown. The rest of the story deals with what happens to Bruno and Schmuel and the others.

There are some plot implausibilities - the fact that Bruno is so incredibly naive about Jews and the ideology of hatred against them is hard to accept if only because most German Aryan boys of Bruno's age would have been in the Hitler Youth and thus exposed to such teachings. Bruno being a high-ranking Nazi officer's son would most certainly have been in the Hitler Youth as would his sister. Also, Ilse not knowing of what was going on in the camp [extermination] also seems implausible. As for Schmuel, most young children were immediately selected for the gas chambers upon arrival, and it seems almost miraculous that Schmuel survived for as long as he did, and was able to meet Bruno so often without detection.

But, implausibilities aside, I still liked this movie - it manages to portray the innocence of children in a depraved world so very credibly, and this is largely due to Asa Butterfield's amazing performance as the naive Bruno whose eyes are slowly 'opened' to the cruelty evident around him. Jack Scanlon's Schmuel is also credible -the chemistry between the two boys is very real, and their friendship is altogether believable, even the part when Bruno 'betrays' his friend and Schmuel's reaction to this. Vera Farmiga's performance as the tormented Ilse is the most powerful adult performance in this movie - she delivers a finely-nuanced performance that makes us believe Ilse was truly horrified by what was being done to the Jews. The other adult male characters delivered rather weak performances - David Thewlis as the Kommandant was stiff in his role and seemed ill at ease for the most part, the sadistic Nazi driver seemed very much a one-dimensional character, and even the Jewish houseworker was not given much character development.

All in all, ""Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" succeeds in getting under one's skin and doesn't cop out with a happily ever after ending, for the climax is brutal and mind-numbing. The child actors' powerful performances enables the movie to address questions about humanity and man's capacity for evil.",1313712000,,4286,4.843110504774898

I served in the military, and spent almost 5 years in Germany, and have gone and visited camps.  And even all the years after the fact, you can still almost feel the horror and despair.  Simply visiting was a horrific experience, because the whole time you are there, you can't help but try to imagine what it was like.  Anyone with the sensitivity of a caterpillar ends up overwhelmed with compassion and loss, numbed and unable to encompass the magnitude of the reality.

In all the things I've seen regarding the camps, I've never seen, or even imagined, a story about it portrayed through the eyes of an 8 year old child.  And not just an 8 year old child inside the camp, but an 8 year old child who is outside of it, innocent of what is going on while his father is the German running the camp.  An 8 year old who befriends a Jewish boy interred in the camp his father runs, neither really understanding the full reality.  And watching as the little German boy starts to wonder, to question, to learn that the lies he was fed were just that, lies.

Watching the story unfold, drawing you along with it, starting out so innocently, and seeing as the people who were unaware start to become aware...  It was masterfully done.  I have to get the book now.

Such a simple premise for a story, but such a powerful one.  It's one of those movies that will be with you for a long time...",1312502400,6,1518,4.302816901408451

3751455,4,B001PMR2KS,"This movie (and the book to a greater extent)is a much-watch. Yeah, I know that there's some serious inaccuracies (in real life there were more prisoners, the kid would have been murdered at his arrival at the camp, and German citizens weren't clueless about the Final Solution) but the overall point is still pertinent. It's not too often that we see the Holocaust from the perspective of a child, and that point of view illustrates that the way racists categorize human beings is wrong. Since Bruno is so innocent, the irrationality of the Nazis is striking. Personally, I liked the book better because it emphasized his innocence which made the end much more shocking.

The best part is that when they're dressed the same, it's impossible to tell the boys apart even though one is from the 'master race' and the other is an 'eeeevil' Jew.

3751456,5,B001PMR2KS,"A Poem I wrote after seeing this film. I was substitute teaching in
a sixth grade classroom for a few days and the students asked me
to watch the movie.

I watched a movie early last night,
a movie sixth graders had asked me to view.
Should I or could I or would I
have watched a movie such as this anytime sooner than now?
Well, I've seen Schlinder's List
and I applauded his try.
Then tonight I again viewed a movie with a tear in my eye
because I remember when I was 17
and on a European study trip into Germany we went.
I guess to view a living history
that only 19 years earlier was still alive and ill.
The showers with no water I walked through.
The brick buildings with all the ovens
for 1 or 2 or maybe a few.
The open ditches for men, women, and children.
Yes, those holy burial grounds I found.
I remember my pain, my shock, my disbelief.
I had read The Diary of Anne Frank,
but nothing makes an impression quite like the real thing.
I feel kind of sick right now and so to my words and piano I must go.
Dear, dear hearts:  my precious little friends who asked me to watch this film,
I hope and pray you will always choose somewhere good to go
and something good to do because reality can be very, very hard to see.

I think this film is actually an adult film and by having it seen through the eyes of an 8 year old boy helps to remind adults, and anyone over the age of 8, what such events might look like from his point of view. I was a little reluctant to see this, actually, and was a bit conflicted about the ""idealization"" aspect of it, but having watched the whole film now, it seems that that ""lead-up"" was necessary. Yes, Bruno was ignorant, but he was only 8! The ending shocked and horrified me, as it should. Of course I wanted his father to rush in and save everyone at the last minute. But for the film that this is, the ending was appropriate. This is not an adult, sweeping, complex, saga. But i do think it was an effective film -- not quite sure what the whole point of Rupert Friend's character was, except to very effectively be the very very ""scary soldier"" who is the closest in proximity to Bruno.

3751469,5,B001PMR2KS,"This is an amazing movie. Although it didn't get much recognition, it definitely deserves it. Bruno, the 9-year-old son of an SS officer, who was moved to the countryside, next to a concentration camp, is completely oblivious to everything that is going around him. He seems somewhat naive - almost a little too naive, when everything around him is against Jews and for the Nazis. He makes friends with one Shmuel, a boy in the concentration camp, wearing 'striped pajamas,' who lives in the 'farm.' Bruno thinks Shmuel is lucky, being able to 'play' with so many friends and to wear 'pajamas' all day. He sneaks food and games for Shmuel, and eventually begins to learn about the differences between him and the people behind the fence.

If you are planning to read the book as well, the book is more seen through the eyes of a young child. The movie is definitely for an older audience, and show Bruno's family more as a unit than the book does.

Although the it's rated PG-13, it might not seem like it at the beginning. The subject that this movie is dealing with is very delicate, but I think that the director did a great job of handling it. Although the movie never explicitly shows what happens to Bruno and Shmuel - you can find that out for yourself - you get the gist of it, and I think that is the worst part - not in a bad way! The movie really makes you think and gives a lot of food for thought. Be forewarned, tears will come! The book and movie are slightly different, but they are both worth taking a look at. There is a great message to be learned in the movie, like the subtitle says: innocence lost, humanity found.

3751473,5,B001PMR2KS,"Outstanding film. 10/10.

What a heartbreaking, brutal example of an important point that unfortunately needs to be reiterated often.

The Holocaust is a testament to what happens when a person dehumanizes someone who they perceive as worthless, a lesser being and/or some kind of threat.

Propaganda is a powerful tool that can fuel the smallest battle - between a few individuals or even the majority of a nation - by convincing them that they need to conquer someone else.

To strip someone of their most basic human rights by enslaving them under the threat of death is the epitome of evil. It's terrifying to know that it has been a reality so many times throughout history. It can happen to anyone.

Racism and narcissism are alive and well. Who are we to decide that someone is less valuable and important than we are based on their appearance, life circumstances, religion or ancestry?",1296259200,3,893,4.848684210526316

3751475,5,B001PMR2KS,"Little Bruno, the son of a Nazi officer, does not understand why the people in his world think Jews are bad. He doesn't understand why a man who's really a doctor is working as a potato peeler in his kitchen. And, he doesn't get why a boy about his age has to stay on the other side of a barbed wire fence and go around in his pajamas all day. But that boy, Shmuel, is the only friend he can find near his new house. Almost every day, Bruno throws his ball out too far ""by accident"" and runs to get it, as an excuse to run to the barbed wire fence where he spends time with his friend.

Throughout this film, you can get a sense of how much or how little Germans knew about the Holocaust when it was happening. Some had a general idea of what was going on, while others were blind to what their country was doing. On the one extreme, Bruno was almost completely ignorant about what was happening to Jewish people. On the other, his dad and his dad's coworkers were the ones exterminating. Bruno's sister grew to be more nationalistic and pro-Nazi as the story continues, and his mom wasn't a fan of Jews but also couldn't live with the grief that her husband was murdering them in cruel and unusual ways. Because of his mom's sentiments, Bruno, his mom, and sister were going to go live with relatives in Heidelberg. But something happens that gets in the way of a peaceful transit to the city.

This movie is NOT based on a true story; however, it is still just as dark and tragic as many of the other popular films about the Holocaust, maybe even more so. Anyone who has liked watching movies like The Pianist and Schindler's List should see this one! I saw the commentaries and deleted scenes too. The actors and crew who were interviewed explained their roles and related it to the way people like their character in 1940s Germany must have felt. The deleted scenes include Bruno seeing the concentration camp from his window, and his maid looking for him. They are very minor parts and not really amazing, but I guess that's why they're deleted scenes.

I have two small complaints against the movie. One is that all the characters have a British accent! Yes, most of the actors were of British descent, but it didn't make any sense in the context of the movie! Also, it is a bit unrealistic that a German and Jewish boy are able to meet at the fence all the time, without a soldier punishing at least the Jewish one.

3751478,5,B001PMR2KS,"What was most memorable about this movie is that even when people understood what was happening, and were adamantly opposed to it, they still did nothing about it. The grandmother in the movie was obviously aware and opposed from the beginning, but said almost nothing. There is some question about what really happened to her in the movie, but she was such a peripheral character I can't write much about it.

 The mother in the film was such a coward when she understood the horror of the camp, yet still allowed her children to be indoctrinated by their tutor. When she saw her daughter with a crush on an especially cold and cruel young officer, she never tried to dissuade her daughter from forming an attachment. When a prisoner showed her son kindness and took care of him when he was hurt, all she could manage was a perfunctory, unemotional word of thanks. And when that same prisoner lost his life for a simple mishap, she said not one word as he was killed. She did fight with her husband about it, but she could have done so much more.

 I think, as a mother myself, the character of the mother in this story was a tragic figure because of her lack of words and action to do anything to even make the life of the prisoners (two were in the house during the movie) even a little bit better. A kind word, an offering of food--but no, she did not do one single thing. Then, at the end of the movie, she suffered what no mother should suffer and partially because of her apathy of evil.

 The acting in this movie is excellent (although it is odd that every person seems to have a British/Irish accent--definitely not German or Polish--which is distracting to the authenticity of the story) from the children (how do young people become so talented at such young ages?) to the adults. Every character is important to the movie, but the character of the mother is most memorable to me.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in history (just try to ignore the accents) and would like an unusual story of that time from a different perspective, as seen from a children's eyes, from both sides of the barbed wire.",1289692800,,2137,4.492268041237113

3751488,3,B001PMR2KS,"The Boy In The Striped Pajamas is yet another take on the horrors of the holocaust. So many horrors, I'd venture to say, that a hundred more books and movies could be made about it. Although I was born in America and was never  personally touched by the Holocaust, in a way I actually was. As a child I saw the horrific photos of piles of emaciated bodies lying in heaps and it colored my world. I think at that moment I knew how the world was and I became an Athiest on the spot and gratefully stayed one. I never want to believe in a God that would or could let that happen for any reason. It still bothers me when people (usually Christians or other religious people} think that God personally caters to them when there are people laying in the dirt somewhere starving to death. Same with the Holocaust. Why would God do this or that, but let the Holocaust happen? The ability to live your life with blinders on must be nice, but that is what happened on a monumental scale in Germany. And this film, as flawed as it is, is yet another chilling example of what happens when you do. The movie is well made. Great music, acting, attention to detail, except for one very glaring fact. Yes, it was set in Germany, but everyone has a distinct English accent. Even the strawberry blond evil Nazi youth has a distinct English accent, as do the Jews in the concentration camp. There isn't a German accent to be found anywhere. Maybe someone on the movie set had one, but no one in the movie does, which I think has a detrimental effect on the whole thing. I couldn't help but think about England during this period. They were being terrorized by Hitler too, yet the movie has the good guys and the bad guys all speaking with English accents. It was hard to get past and a little unsettling. English accents are, for lack of a better word, usually pretty. The actors accents gave the whole movie a genteel feel, which a Holocaust movie should never have. Funny no one who has reviewed this film mentioned the English accents because I kept waiting for the Nazis to have a tea party. It drained the movie of true menace and made it seem unrealistic. If it weren't for the performances of the two boys and the mother, the movie really could have sunk in my opinion... that is until the ending, which is absolutely chilling. I was stunned and had to recover from it. But afterwards it made me realize how badly I wanted what preceded it, to have even half the impact the ending does.

3751490,5,B001PMR2KS,"Gut the film of a few clich&eacute;s and the unintentional humor (some of their more obvious attempts at subtle statements come across slightly amusing) and you'd have a near perfect example of the gritty realities of human weakness.  Yes, the Holocaust, one of the most brutal and overall disgusting `black spots' in human history is given a fresh take in this spellbinding and heartbreaking tale about a young boy oblivious to the horrors his specious is capable of.

Makes you sick just thinking about it.

The film follows a young boy named Bruno who moves with his family to the countryside.  His father, a high ranking official in the SS troops, has been promoted and so the move is necessary.  Bruno is less than enthused about leaving his friends, but upon arriving at his new home (which is beautiful) he notices a farm out in the distance, and there are children working in the farm.  From the looks of them, they are strange to him, but he is curious.  Despite his parents concern with his venturing `out back', Bruno (who is obsessed with adventure books) decides to sneak away and find the farm.  When he gets there he meets a young boy named Shmuel (pronounced almost like `small').  Young Bruno (and to a degree Shmuel) are oblivious to the truth about the farm.  Bruno is taught that Jews are disgusting people who are less than human and that they are responsible for the fall of German society.  He is also misguided into thinking that the Jews are being properly cared for.  Shmuel is kept in the dark about the eventualities about his stay at the farm.  The two boys strike a friendship and a bond that transcends society's boundaries.

If only we could all be as innocent as children.

That was one of the main things I gathered from this movie.  I loved the way that it brilliantly captured the forgiving and understanding quality that children possess.  They can see through to the heart of a person.  Even after young Bruno betrays his friend, causing him serious harm, Shmuel forgives him almost instantly, understanding that Bruno was not malicious or hurtful but merely frightened and acted without thinking.  If they had been adults, it would have most likely resulted in a longstanding grudge and retaliation.

Another point I gathered from this film, a point I think is remarkably strong, is that not every German completely understood or even agreed with what was taking place.  The character of Elsa, the mother, in particular is a strong one.  She was a woman who was brainwashed by a nation to believe in a `cause' that was horrific in itself, but when she discovered what was being done to the Jews at that farm she was mortified.  It destroyed her.  She was raised to hate them and to believe that they were the enemy, but she was not evil enough to forget that they were human beings.

I'm shocked at the poor reception this film garnered, but then again I think many people viewed this as a children's film, which it is not.  In fact, unless you want to answer a lot of uncomfortable and difficult questions, I'd keep the kids FAR away from this movie.

That said, the film is borderline genius to be honest.  I mean, I can see the films few flaws and there are some areas I wish were cleaned up a tad, but overall this film simply has everything it needs.  From the brilliant performances (Vera Farmiga is a goddess and young Asa Butterfield probably should have been nominated for an Oscar) to the beautiful sets and stunning camera work to the chilling screenplay that uses a fresh perspective to twist the knife a tad deeper, `The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' is a stunning film that truly deserves to be seen and discussed.",1280102400,,3665,4.63875968992248

Have you not often wondered what the good people of Germany were thinking as Hitler codified anti-Semitism and six million Jews were murdered?  This film shows that not everyone was in lock-step with the mindless prejudices that would allow otherwise ""good"" people who looked the other way while unspeakable evil walked the earth, but the evil viewpoint was the one that prevailed.

Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is much like other eight year old boys.  He is curious and loves his family.  His family provides a comfortable home and a loving environment.  Bruno's father is a soldier, and Bruno takes some pride seeing his father in his uniform.  Bruno's father is receiving a promotion and an assignment to an important new post.

At the new assignment Bruno sees workers at the farm where his father is the overseer.  Curious - all the workers wear dull black and white striped pajamas.

If we know even a little about the holocaust, it is curious to see if through the eyes of eight-year-old Bruno.  Bruno is lonely in his new home - there are no other young children.  On the other side of the barbed wire his new friend, Shmuel, has the opportunity to play with the other workers.

We see the horror as Bruno's mother (played by Vera Farmiga) realizes that dear old Dad is the kommandant of a Death Camp rather than a work camp.  She is horrified, and like the Kommandant's mother, not in agreement with the ""final solution"".  But their voices are in the minority, and drowned out by the prevailing opinion of the inherent ""evilness"" of the Jews.

This film does not break new story-telling ground.  But by telling the story from a point of view that we rightly expect to be innocent, and shielded from horror - we feel the horror more nearly than from an history book.

In scope and tone and story and setting and cinematography inferior to Speilberg's masterpiece, ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is nonetheless a worthwhile film.",1280102400,3,2247,5.211699164345404
3751492,1,B001PMR2KS,"This truly, from a historical standpoint, is one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen.  From this movie I learned the following ""facts.""
1.  Auschwitz is apparently in Germany.
2.  Auschwitz except for one barrack, didn't have very many prisoners.  It also wasn't very crowded.
3.  Apparently, except for one fly buzzing in the background, sanitation wasn't that bad.
4.  Prisoners were of a healthy weight.
5.  Except for in the barrack, there were literally no guards.
6.  Auschwitz had no guard towers.
7.  If you wanted, you could chat with prisoners of Auschwitz anytime you wanted just be walking up to the barbed wire.
8.  Full grown men were gassed and young children were gassed only when they accidentally got mixed in with the full grown men.  Otherwise, young children were okay.
9.  If you wanted in to Auschwitz, simply dig a hole under the fence and nobody will mind.
10.  There were only men in Auschwitz and no women.

I could go on and on with the ridiculous historical inaccuracies, but those are my top 10 problems.  If you are looking for a movie that romanticizes history, then you are fine.  It is a movie that can make you think about the ending.  However, since most people don't know enough about the Holocaust already, I worry that they are going to take this movie to be fact, when it is nowhere close.",1279411200,57,1340,4.610169491525424

3751495,5,B001PMR2KS,"This movie deserves way more credit than it has been given! Unfortunate events surrounding the time of World War II are portrayed in both blatant and subtle ways from the 8 year-old Bruno's perspective. He remains oblivious to the turbulence of the politics and war. He can see signs of violence (treatment of Pavel by the soldier, treatment of the soldier by Bruno's own father, the 'horrible smell' etc) but he is too young to guess or understand exactly what is going on. He makes friends with a Jewish boy Shmuel in the 'farm' and joins him to find Schmuel's missing father. He meets his death along with untold number of people in the 'shower room'.

It is for the movie watcher to decide if Bruno's father, the administrator of the 'farm' learned his lesson as a human being. Many such scenes in the movie provoke the audience to think and rethink. The 'soft' side of Bruno's father comes to light when he, upon insistence of his wife, decides to send his children away from the 'camp' area. But it is too late-the movie ends with the tough but grief-stricken father standing still at the shock of his son's murder. As tragic as it is, it is a very powerful presentation.",1276387200,3,1177,4.578199052132701
3751496,5,B001PMR2KS,"I also have seen many movies about the Holocaust, and this one stands out immensely, by quietly showing the apathy and deceit required of supposedly civilized people, shown in different ways by Bruno's parents. I have read a number of comments that think Bruno was more than a little dim for not getting it, while supposedly Bruno's mother knew nothing about what was really going on at the camps, and I read no comments on that. It would be interesting to me to read an account, an honest account, of what it was like for a Nazi family and how they lived, knowing what was going on. A child knows only what they have been taught, they believe their parents more than anyone in the world, and since all Bruno was told was lies, of course he is going to believe them and want to believe them. He struggled with wanting to love and honor his father and starting to doubt him. The child was only eight! Even though he was seeing the camp with his own eyes, he didn't really know what was going on, no child who had been sheltered and deceived would. The same with Gretel, who also only knew what they wanted her to know, and had not the experience to know better. The Hitler Youth was immensely successful in indoctrination of the children because they are so vulnerable and impressionable.

 I was sickened when the elderly man was beaten to death in front of the children and no one moved a muscle, and I seriously suspected the actual cause of the grandmother's death, bombing or not, since she was vocally opposed to the Reich. I feared for the life and health of Bruno's mother as well, and don't think the father, brutal and committed to the Reich, would just let her walk away with his children.

The ending was immensely powerful, yet I wanted it to have impact on the father other than just personally, otherwise, I didn't see the point. The worst monster can love his child.

I don't think it was Auschwitz, which held thousands of people. This one seemed very small, more like a work camp, and not all of them were killing camps, other than by starvation and disease, etc.

3751498,5,B001PMR2KS,"So far, I've only viewed this riveting film twice. But it doesn't take too many viewings to evoke much commentary on this memorable historical drama.
  Based on the book of the same name by John Boyne, it deals with the story of young Bruno (whose wide-blue-eyed innocence is played outstandingly by young Asa Butterfield), the eight-year-old son of a member of the German High Command (David Thewlis)in World War II Berlin.
 We meet Bruno and his family as they learn they are to move to Poland due to the promotion of Bruno's father. The young boy frolics with his friends in the streets, oblivious to people being rounded up and herded into cattle cars around them. His beautiful, amiable mother(Vera Farmiga) arrives home from an outing, while his sister, Gretl(Amber Beattie) plays with dolls in her room.
 The children of priviledge soon present themselves downstairs at a party celebrating their father's promotion. In contrast to their grandfather's (Richard Johnson) support of the Third Reich, their grandmother's (Sheila Hancock) apprehension about its policies is noted on this occasion.
 Once in Poland, Bruno finds himself without any friends, and forbidden to explore certain parts of the new residence.
  Soon, he sneaks out anyway, and encounters the mysterious ""farm"" he was able to see from his bedroom window before it was boarded up.
  He encounters a young boy in striped pajamas named Schmuel(Jack Scanlon)and begins to converse with him, gradually beginning to empathize with his plight.
  At home, he sees the Nazi Lieutenant Kotler(Rupert Friend), amusing his sister, and brutalizing a Jewish servant named Pavel (David Hayman, who was previously in another WWII flick, ""Hope and Glory""), and is curious as to why no one objects to this behavior.
  Over time, as they receive the standard indoctrination from their tutor, Herr  Liszt (Jim Norton), and Gretel becomes a hard-core little Bundist, forsaking her dolls and assuming what she considers to be more appropriate duties in the wake of the Fatherland's plight, while her brother, who seems to have his mother's gentler nature, is more reluctant to accept indoctrination.
  He still visits Schmuel at the edge of the fence whenever possible, occasionally taking him food, passing him his soccer ball, or indulging in a game of checkers, allowing the incarcerated lad to call the moves from his side of the fence. The joy and innocence of these two boys shines amid the horror.
  A bombing claims the life of Bruno's ailing grandmother, and Bruno discusses her funeral with his friend.
  There is an unfortunate moment of betrayal when the sadistic Lieutenant Kotler, perhaps striving to prove his loyalty to the Reich, especially when it becomes known that his father does not support it, catches the two boys together, as Schmuel(who has replaced the murdered Pavel) was cleaning glassware in Bruno's house, and Bruno denies having given Schmuel the sweets he was caught with.
 But Bruno will find a way to reconcile with his friend, in a devastatingly heroic  way that reveals his parents' ultimate failure to shield him from the goings-on, and reveals how terrible poetic justice can be. The last scene of two boys together is one of them clinging to each other among a forest of emaciated adults, looking upward with still-wide-eyed innocence, still believing in the best...
 While there have been complaints about historical accuracy, this is a tale of painful sweetness with a tug at the heartstrings that has the strength of a child's pull, and a reminder of how we may condemn those we love the best with our own hatreds.",1275350400,4,3610,5.0608108108108105
3751499,5,B001PMR2KS,"Much has been about this film here, mostly pro, some con.  I can only add my opinion that it was a marvelous and riveting film that every kid in the world should watch.  Yes, at times it seemed hard to believe that these two boys, so marvelously acted by Asa Butterfield and Jack Scanlon, could have been so naive.  But they were just eight years old living through something that the rest of the world had not imagined until after they discovered the truth.  If the film is not totally true to history (and I am not commenting on its historical accuracy one way or the other), it nonetheless makes a marvelous story. The ending is a stunner and completely unexpected.  This is a film that, with some preparation, you can show to your pre-teen:  no foul language, no sex, and no in-your-face violence even though the story is set in the most violent era in world history.

As to those critics who heap vituperation on this film because they deny the holocaust occurred, I can only say things to them that would get this review deleted.  I will only say that my father helped liberate a concentration camp, and he did not imagine what he saw.  He did, however, have difficulty discussing it even years later.

My one criticism is why the producers did not include the deleted scenes they present on the DVD.  The movie is barely 1:30 long.  These scenes, all short, would have added little length to the film and would have clarified some issues.  When, for example, I saw the pile of dolls in the basement, I did conclude they were Gretel's, a fact one of the deleted scenes would have explained.  One of them also explains why Bruno, once denied permission to go into the back garden at all, was able to do so with impunity.

3751503,5,B001PMR2KS,"""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is an unusual story of the Holocaust.  Bruno (Butterfield) is an eight-year-old boy living in Nazi Germany.  In fact, Bruno's life is great:  he lives in a big house, playing with friends, and enjoying life to the fullest.  His father (Thewlis) is a German officer, and the entire family is proud of him.  That pride grows even larger when the father, an SS officer, gets promoted; a move that requires the entire family to move east to the ""countryside"".

The first signs that there might be something wrong emerge as Bruno peeks through the window of his room, looking at the strange farmers who all wear pajamas.  Bruno doesn't understand why, upon his inquiry of the strangely dressed people, his window is boarded up, and Bruno is not allowed to play in the back yard.  It is even more strange that one of these farmers works in Bruno's family's kitchen, peeling potatoes and never speaking or even looking up.  Bruno does not understand why this man is peeling the potatoes after he finds out that the man is doctor by training, after Bruno fell and hurt himself.

In fact, Bruno does not know that he is living immediately next to Auschwitz and that his father is the Camp commander.  With the typical curiosity of a child, Bruno goes into the thin strip of forest behind his house, and goes all the way to the barbed wire, behind which he encounters a boy his own age; this boy also wore striped pajamas.  The two boys, unaware of the politics, religion, or ancient hatreds, strike up a friendship, each boy lonely and starving for companionship.  And although separated by the barbed wire, the boys look forward to Bruno's sneaking out of the back yard, and to having simple conversations every day.  But Bruno must be careful lest his parents, or one of their mean uniformed soldier friends find out about Bruno's activities.

I didn't know what to think about this film.  Heaven knows I have seen many films about the Holocaust, and while each offers something new, there are only so many ways a story could be told.  However, I had to take into account that the story of Bruno is fictional.  The film blew me away.  No, there were no great special effects or super tragic scenes sparkled throughout the movie.  No, the film is made in a very simple manner, which only adds charm to it.  What got me is the irony of the film, especially in the very end.  The screenwriting is simple, photography good, and editing well done.  Acting is a bit stiff, but Butterfield did a good job in his role.  In the end, the movie left me perplexed and deep in thought, a result that I often yearn for.

All in all, ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is a well-done movie with a controversial ending.  One either loves it or hates it, but it doesn't leave the viewer non-chalant.  Highly recommended.

3751515,5,B001PMR2KS,"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is extremely intense, even painful, but so beautifully done that one becomes pulled in.  In this film, we see the holocaust through the eyes of innocence - and the eyes are German.  We experience the story in the heart of a loving family - and the family is German.  Because of that viewpoint, we can understand a little better how people remained morally unchallenged during the holocaust, even when the ghastly truth was literally just outside their gates.  We can see, achingly, that we, as good people, are not immune to allowing that which we now condemn in hindsight.  The film draws parallels between the world of the camp, with the striped clothing those interred there must wear behind electrified fences, and the stark, fortress-like house in which the German commandant's family lives, with it's barred stair rail and locked, guarded fence.  We come to see that both groups are, in very different ways, imprisoned.  The fact that the main characters, Bruno and Schmuel, are each eight years old, allows us to feel tenderly toward them in their different innocent circumstances, and levels our sympathies.  Bruno's mother is a sensitive and nurturing woman, and the daughter dabbles with the Reich teachings  and the Reich heroes in the manner that we'd recognize in a twelve-year-old girl of today idolizing media stars.  We are even shown the loving father inside the proud, severe military commandant.  This makes experiencing the film very difficult, as the viewer becomes emotionally engaged in the friendship between Schmuel inside the camp, and Bruno with his warm German family in their compound.

 As a retired teacher I recall the difficulties of encouraging young people to understand this time in history.  To them, the holocaust is something that happened long ago, done buy a known monster, and something that they, as modern people, simply wouldn't do.  I wish I'd had this film to help them open their eyes to the commonality of people.  It shows us that Germans of the holocaust were ordinary people, too.  The film is fiction, but somehow it is truer than a documentary because it lets us into the hearts of those who lived in that time, and leads us to recognize that  the kind of thinking that lead to the holocaust is not, most unfortunately, banished to the distant past.  The seeds of the holocaust flowered into horrible fruit then, and the same seeds are within each of us now.  The film shows us through the commandant's innocent family that expressions of hate can devastate the hater as well.  We have an obligation to pass on the story of the holocaust to the current generation, so the mindset which lead to the atrocities can be recognized and avoided. Though it is difficult viewing, parents should watch it with children whom they judge capable, so that the priceless understanding that comes through the film will not be lost to the future.",1265932800,2,2915,4.884146341463414
3751516,5,B001PMR2KS,"Set during the World War II holocaust, The Boy In The Striped Pajamas follows the development of the unlikliest friendship between two little boys - one, a Jewish prisoner at one of the Nazis's extermination camps; the other, the son of the commanding officer of that very camp, who in his childhood innocence knows nothing about what his father really does for a living or the real situation of the war around them (which German children were taught had Germany as the 'good guy' and the Allies as aggressors).

  Shortly after the boy's father is assigned the new commanding officer of the camp and he and his family relocate there (to an expansive manor - the contrast between the comfortable, supposedly civilized lifestyle of the German officers living right next to a death camp is striking), the boy, Bruno, who spends much of his time alone, comes to a wire fence and meets up with the little boy on the other side of it.  The little boy, Shmuel, is very relucant to say anything of his situation, likely knowing that contact with any non-prisoner is forbidden and would have severe consequences.  Bruno, for his part, is puzzled by the fence and why the other boy wears 'striped pajamas' (the prison garb) all the time, but decides, using innocent eight year-old logic, that all the people on the other side of the fence must be farmers who live there and just dress strangely.  Despite their differences, the two become friends, and Shmuel begins to tell Bruno more of his circumstances.  Bruno brings food to the fence for the under-fed Shmuel, and the two play games through the fence.

  As Bruno is starting to have doubts about why is his father is running such a place, the rest of the family begins to learn more of the true nature of the camp.  Some seem undisturbed and others horrified, and the question of just when did the German people start to realize what was really going on in a major plot thread.  It's appalling to see the Nazi rationale for their actions, the explanations they give that the people on the other side of the fence ""aren't really people"", the warped propaganda that Bruno and other children are taught during lessons by their tutors.  Eventually, the friendship between Bruno and Shmuel is discovered, although Bruno remains determined to stay loyal to his little friend, leading up to a calamitous and heart-rending end phase of the movie.

  Briliantly acted and produced, The Boy In The Striped Pajamas is meant to be accessible to younger viewers, so not all of the Nazi brutalities are shown as graphically as they might otherwise be, but it's still a harrowing watch in many places, and the clearly implied incidents are as effective as anything shown outright.  Upsetting and with a large focus on humanity's worst side, it also focuses often on far brighter or more positive aspects, including Bruno and Shmuel's friendship and also the reactions of certain other characters.  In the days when the commander's wife thinks the camp is merely a labour camp (as if that wouldn't be bad enough) with reasonably decent living conditions (at one point we see several characters viewing a Nazi propaganda film about the camps, depicting the workers happily going about basic chores during the day and gathering at night for socialization, entertainment, and dining - a ridiculously far cry from the reality, but very similiar to what the Nazi government actually put in its real-life propaganda) she gets to know some of the prisoners who are forced to work around the family estate, and starts to question what life is really like for these people on the other side of the fence.  Bruno's mother is one of the characters who's more sympathetic toward the Jewish people from the beginning, and even as Bruno starts to realize what's really going on, his mother is beginning to figure out the same conclusions on her own.

  All in all, it's a dark and uncomfortable watch, but one in which certain moments of beauty and power continue to shine through.  One of the most powerful World War II films ever made, and an extremely moving tale.",1265932800,,4084,4.786324786324786

3751525,5,B001PMR2KS,"What to say about this film?  It was engaging.  It was moving.  It was powerfully emotional.  Jack Scanlan as Schmuel was an excellent choice for the 'boy in the striped pajamas' and I had read somewhere that that young boy was able to pull at your emotions with just his facial expressions and he pulls even stronger when he does speak.  Whoever wrote that was completely right.  As does the innocence of the friendship that builds between the son of a German Nazi Commander, and a boy that lives in 'the farm' on the other side of an electrified barbed wire fence.  I found myself rooting for their friendship, even though I knew that it would be short lived.  I expected it to end when Bruno betrays his friendship to Schmuel when he lies about Schmuel taking food.  But it didn't.  The boys continue their friendship through the fence and in an attempt to apologize to Schmuel for lying, Bruno sneeks across (or under) the fence to help Schmuel find his father who has gone missing within 'the farm'.  The Nazi Commander and his wife discover their son is missing and start a frantic search to find their son.  The movie then takes an unexpected turn (although, somewhat expected if you know any history about concentration camps) and it's at that moment when your emotions are truly put to the test.  For me, I had my emotions in check up until the two boys meet and from that point on, there was no holding them back.  The tears flowed to the very end.
It's a powerful movie and I highly recommend it!",1257638400,2,1507,4.492647058823529
3751526,4,B001PMR2KS,"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a movie that left me conflicted, to say the least. It involves a friendship that comes from the most unlikely of places, and ends with a tragedy that involves droves of Jews and one German boy. While I will not say exactly what happens, I will say that feeling bad for this one boy seems to be a bad thing in some ways because I felt sorry for him only because of the way he was presented. His father was the director of a camp that kills Jews, his family a beast filled with blind followers, and one boy looking into the Jewish camps and wondering why he wasn't allowed to play the game the Jews were allowed to play.

As far as movies go, the movie was done well and shows something about the youth of a country that killed at leisure. There is the confusion, the wonder, the want to help, and all of the ignorance that youth can breed. It accomplishes everything it sets out to do, too, making you feel sorrow when the curtain comes down. I hope that the movie was also meant to make a person examine this sorrow they felt, knowing that the word genocide is associated with the thing they just watched. The other people in the striped pajamas were not props but were instead reminders of people that were going to die a horrid death, and yet one boy on the wrong side of the fence was the thing that we were watching. His life, his actions, his family's sorrow; these things were the things we saw. What we did not see were the pieces that were missing from the puzzle; the families that could not cry because they were no longer anything save ash mistaken for snow on the breeze.

Do I recommend the movie? I'm not sure. I do know that I liked the movie, that it moved me, but I'm not sure it moved me in the way it was supposed to. It has a complexity to it, one that I hope people do not miss, but that several newspaper reviews seemed to lose in their interpretation of the movie.

3751529,5,B001PMR2KS,"I did not read the book that inspired this movie--but I had heard about it and figured it was just another weepy story about the holocaust. Not to criticize that awful time, but there seems to be an overabundance of films and books on this subject as of late, and I just about wrote this one off. (I saw last year's THE READER and while I loved the book, I really soured at the movie. I thought it was proselytizing and unbearably pontificating on the obvious).  So it was with much incredulity that I viewed this film.

  First of all--the boys were so amazingly good--the acting and the true to life portrayals of boys at that age. I was also moved by the heft of the story--that the wife of the commander in charge was so powerfully moral. But what I was not expecting was this amazing story, and particularly, its summation--let me just put it that way. It had such a powerful effect on me that it resonated with me for days afterward.

Why did this movie not received the attention that THE READER (a lesser movie, for sure) did? (of course, there was the starring role of Kate Winslet, but still...it really was not that good of a film.) But THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS blew me away. And I totally recommend.

What got me very disturbed and bummed out about the movie was that the commander's son had been accidentally gassed to death in the showers at the end of the movie (along with several prison inmates).

3751533,2,B001PMR2KS,"There are two good things about this film. One is the marvellous performances of its two young leads. The other is the reminder that the top Nazis were often loving and devoted parents, yet they committed some of the vilest atrocities in history. We tend to demonise the Nazis, but the fact is that these monstrous deeds were not committed by aliens from another planet but by people from one of Europe's most civilised countries. Fanaticism of any kind, religious, political, racial, is a terrible thing.

However, for me, these are not enough to save the film, which, even to my inexpert eyes, seems ridiculously contrived.

Kids in Nazi Germany were indoctrinated from an early age. A kid such as Bruno, son of a senior officer in the Totenkopf SS, would have received an especially big dose of teaching against the evils of pernicious Jewry. Such a child would have run a mile rather than come anywhere near a Jew, never mind actually befriend one. On the other hand, Jewish kids in what appears to be a ""Vernichtungslager"" (extermination camp) had a minute life expectancy - as useless mouths incapable of working usefully in the work camps associated with the Vernichtungslager, they usually went straight from the train into THAT queue. To find a feeble bit of non-electrified fence with no guard towers just out the back of the commandant's house and for a Jewish kid to find a job that apparently consists of pushing around an empty wheelbarrow, well, it's all too absurd. Not to mention that Shmuel is apparently a German Jew, so Bruno and he have a common language. All the Vernichtungslager were in Poland, and took Jews from all over occupied Europe. How lucky can you be?

The only thing missing from this fairy tale is a happily-ever-after ending.",1253404800,11,1762,4.808580858085809
3751534,3,B001PMR2KS,"""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas,"" set during WWII, begins with a 9-year-old boy Bruno playing with his friends in the street of Berlin. Bruno's father is a German military officer and one day because of his father's ""job,"" Bruno and his family move from the city to a home in a countryside, where Bruno finds a ""farm"" behind the forest. There, behind the fences of the ""farm,"" Bruno meets a boy named Shmuel and befriends this ""boy in the striped pyjamas.""

We know this ""farm"" is really a Nazi Germany's concentration camp, but Bruno doesn't. You can say ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas,"" based on a 2006 bestselling novel by John Boyne, is about Holocaust seen from a German boy. And he is not just a boy; he is a son of the officer who is in charge of the concentration camp. For Bruno, a Nazi's propaganda film showing the inside of the concentration camp IS the truth.

No one can deny the impact of the film's devastating climax, but the story up to the point, especially the part about the two boys, look forced and artificial. To their credits the young actors did a very good job, but to believe their friendship and its tragic consequences, we also have to believe that a prisoner like Shmuel is allowed to roam in the concentration camp (with no guards around the fences). I know the film is based on a novel, but even so, I find some of the premises of the film (besides the English-speaking cast playing Germans) hard to swallow.

David Thewlis and Vera Farmiga are fine as Bruno's parents and Benot Delhomme's photography with muted colors is a plus for the film, which is emotionally stunning, but not perfectly convincing.",1252972800,,1638,4.5646258503401365
3751535,5,B001PMR2KS,"A story of innocence against a diabolical truth. It is set in WW11, but really it could happen anytime, anywhere. For in reality, it is a story of mankind's struggle within Himself.
 Seeing the cover of DVD with two innocent children, one in pajamas, next to a barbed wire fence; I knew in my gut that this was Tombstone Territory Hardcore. Experience weathers the face of innocence, laugh lines troubled by worry lines next door to evil. Some live in evil's mist never knowing; many Germans have claimed suprise over the Holocaust, some even denying it. In 2000 there were a suspected 5,000 to 7,000 camps. Today we know there were over 20,000 such camps. Six known extermination camps, 12,000 ghettos of starvation, 10+ million slave laborers, 10+ million POWs, and thats not counting other types of camps. Each camp was an island unto itself with many independent bureaucracies, giving free reign to their many independent commandants, to have absolute power over thier prisoners. Even today the truth is still slowly coming to light.
 In this fabled/allegorical movie the fence represents a fact. The fence is seperating the two innocent children and they both wonder at its purpose. On one side, hunger & abuse. The other, an abundance of food/toys. Both wonder what the truth is. The irony, of course, is that both are being protected from it (sound familiar?). This brings to my mind an observation by the screenwriter Robert McKee, ""What happens is fact. Truth is what we think about what happens."".
 Shumel, the boy inside the fence, is close to death's door and not aware of it. Bruno, son of the SS officier running the camp, is just as unaware of the fact that this where the ovens of hell on earth are burning. A holocaust of inhumanity so diabolically evil that it cloaks itself in plain sight/shadowed by its very own unbelievable reality.
 By keeping the truth from the boys, they know not what they do. When they dig a hole. Are they digging their way out/in/ or their own graves? The truth is killing them, not protecting them. The only ones protected by the truth are those that keep it from us, keepers of the darkness that fears the light of day.
 The Founding Fathers knew that a secret government is a bad government. That power corrupted. The Germany of the 1930's had passed from the light into the darkness quickly/quietly, as quick the rest of the world followed...into hell.
 The two inocent children here should have been told the FACTS. This week was the week of 9/11. More than one third of Americans do not believe the government's official findings. There are secrets. There are truths. What we must demand are the FACTS. History may not repeat itself but it Damn sure rhymes.
 So this movie is very prescience in its meaning and message. Fences are still being built. Don't depend on the Goebbels of today. You just have to dig out the Damn truth yourself.

3751538,5,B001PMR2KS,"We have all heard of the horrors of concentration camps and seen some documentaries and feature films. But none of them could have the same impact as this film. That is because this movie looks at the Holocaust from the perspective of two children, one within the camp and one outside. Both are caught up in a chain of events dictated by circumstances beyond their control.
Even wars cannot stop children from becoming friends. Children have no enemies. Even as the Nazi propaganda machine denigrates Jews, Bruno, the eight-year-old son of a senior SS Officer forms a friendship with an eight-year-old boy in the concentration camp located just beyond their house. Both of them have little idea of what is going on. Genocide is a concept they know nothing about.
This movie evokes memories of the Italian movie Life is Beautiful, because they both focus on children caught up in war. But the message that emanates from The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is even more powerful. Life is not only beautiful, it is precious. How could a man with a family send so many innocents to their deaths? That is a pivotal point in the film. When Bruno's father realizes the futility of his actions, it is too late.
This is one of the best movies centered on World War II. There's not a gunshot in sight, but the smoke from the chimneys is all that is needed to show the depths to which man could sink in times of war. It will appeal to children and adults alike - this movie is a good teaching aid as well if you want to tell your children about the Holocaust.

Somehow you don't want to remember these things that must never be forgotten!

At the end of THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS, I did not speak and could not think.  It took perhaps 48 hours before I could ""begin"" to think clearly.  I cannot tell you the end - it would be wrong - but you must see it.

Reviewers can sit around and talk about its flaws (like how on earth could a nine year old boy living in Germany during that time period not know what a concentration camp was?!), but one thing we can all agree on: The story proves a valuable point. Adults should see this film because it forces us to look outside of ourselves, and children should see it because it is a positive message that will follow them the rest of their lives. The fact is that the horrible things that the movie portrays really did happen. Innocent men, women and children suffered like few of us could ever relate to. I would recommend this film to anyone.

3751543,5,B001PMR2KS,"I don't usually liked war themed films but ""the Boy in The Striped Pajamas"" looked like such a sweet yet brutal story when I saw the previews.

When I watched it I was surprised at the range of emotions that it evoked. It was a story about taboo friendships and the common threads that bind us as humans no matter what the circumstance.
There were some very strong characters in the movie and the acting top notch. It showed how hate is taught and cultivated not inborn.

It shows how the innocence of a child can be his salvation and it can also be his destruction. Watching the friendship between the little german boy and the ""little jewish boy in the concentration camp"" was so touching and heart tugging, watching their confusion as to why they were supposed to hate each other was in itself a message,and the fact that they didn't hate each other should be the answer..  .The fence that kept them apart was not very constricting but at the same time it was as vast as an ocean between them.

This is such a powerful movie that I was in awe and shock at the boldness of the last act.
I won't give too much away as not to spoil but I will say that during the last act I was saying to myself ""they couldn't allow this to happen could they?""but then I thought again and said ""why not?""what makes the person in question any less deserving of such cruelty than the others involved.

The story centers on the boy and how his parents try to keep the horror of reality of what is going on there from him. He slowly discovers the ugly truth a little too late!

While the story is engrossing, I felt there was something missing in this heartbreaking film. I would have liked to have seen more detail and contrast between the father's point of view and his families'.

The acting is superb, particularly, Farmiga, Thewlis, and Butterfield, and the cinematography is lovely.  My issues with the film were technical, in that I found it bothersome that everyone in the film had British accents, which did sensually detract from the authenticity of the subject matter.  Though it did drag in a few places and could have been shorter as a result, the film manages to bring a new approach to material that is already emotionally charged. The film's perspective actually did break the wall in a manner of speaking, as at one point in the film it switched from what had been Bruno's perspective to a split second of Shmuel's observation, a distraction more than a disruption.

Take the friendship angle and place it in any other setting, for example, boys from different social classes; or different races, etc and maybe it could work. But not here. This is simply holocaust revisionist writing.

While little or nothing is directly shown (making it an excellent means of introducing younger viewers to the history of the Holocaust), you have no trouble knowing what is happening. I loved the shooting style used in this film, as it successfully captures the innocent view of a child during one of the darkest periods in world history. This also serves to make it even more disturbing, though also more real, as you see Bruno attempt to make sense of what is going on in his world.

3751564,4,B001PMR2KS,"This movie is a vivid, meticulously observed and detailed attempt to imagine the unthinkable, to see the unimaginable - through the eyes of a child, a lively and outgoing little boy named Bruno. Bruno is the youngest member of a loving and affectionate family; he has an older sister who is at that age of being on the cusp between playing with her vast collection of dolls and her first teenage crush. Their father is a professional soldier, rising up in the ranks, who has a prestigious new assignment which will take them far from the city, and their mother, a beautiful socialite - who obviously cherishes her children, nonetheless.  It is a small world, the world of a child - delineated by the streets between a home and school, playmates and parents, the grandparents - a gruff and bluff Grandfather, and the queenly grandmother with sharp eyes and an even sharper tongue. Within the space of the first ten minutes, Bruno and his family are wrenched away from everything familiar and dear, when his father is sent off to a new assignment - away from a comfortable and stately old house in the city to a new and uncomfortably modern one, away out in the country.

Of course, it is instantly plain to everyone above the awareness of a mollusk that Bruno's father is an SS officer in Nazi Germany, and that the new assignment is at a concentration camp ... and that the uncomfortably modern villa - so far away from everyone and everywhere, and staffed by slave labor - is on the periphery of the camp, where Bruno's father is in charge. The viewer knows this, simultaneously seeing and knowing, and yet seeing it filtered through Bruno's awareness, that bright and lonely small boy looking for someone to play with. In spite of his parents' efforts to keep him out of the back garden and woods which lead down to the periphery fence around the camp, Bruno does find a friend, another bright and lonely small boy, a Jewish prisoner named Shemuel. They play checkers through the fence, strike up an unlikely friendship. Bruno brings him food - and childlike, never gets around to wondering why Shemuel is constantly hungry.

Other reviewers have noted that both Bruno, and especially Shemuel seem to be quite terribly - even fatally nave about a great many matters, not finding it quite credible that both of them would be so clueless about the camp, about Nazi aims for the Jews, about the purpose of the camp itself, especially after the brutality that Shemuel experiences during this movie, and that he would have experienced in being brought to the camp. It might be stretching the bounds of believability, but I recall that I, as  child among other children, lived in our very own world. Nothing bad could ever happen to children, and yet at the same time, we were most amazingly accepting of the most startling circumstances, as long as our parents were present, and calm. Of course we were safe, Mummy and Dad were there and they said so. Remembering this, I can accept that Bruno would go to Shemuel's aid within the camp - Shemuel was his friend, and Bruno felt guilty for having let him down, once.  And so this movie ends, on an abrupt and brutal note. Although it is about children, it is not a movie for children of the age that the protagonists are.
Of the extras, there is the usual ""Making of"" feature, and a selection of deleted scenes - about half of which, in my opinion, would have been very well included in the feature itself.",1243900800,3,3451,4.632352941176471

Maybe in the original book (which I have not read) this works as a fable, but I'm not exaggerating by saying that there is not a single moment in this film that is believable. For starters: If it was so easy to enter the camp, with just a shovel, how come the inmates didn't escape?.

3751569,5,B001PMR2KS,"First, let's start off by saying that the subject matter is not the easiest and some will find this a difficult film to watch.  But I urge you to do so.  It is a haunting film, one that will make you think and also understand the emotional scope of the horrors that happened in Nazi Germany.

The script (adapted from the novel by John Boyne) is tight, the dialog and characters defined as much by what the characters do not say as they are by their words, deed and actions.  The casting is spot on as well, with Jack Scanlon as Shmuel turning in a heartbreaking performance, full off the innocence of youth tamped down by the horror around him.  Likewise, David Hayman as Pavel turns in an understated performance to serve as counterbalance to Shmuel.  Pavel has seen it all, plunged from the heights to the lowest of lows.  He is a broken man and yet he has not lost his humanity.  Asa Butterfield turns in a nice performance as Bruno, the son of the Nazi Commandant, and Vera Farmiga as Bruno's mother gives a nuanced performance as the woman who has her head in the sand but her eyes wide open.  And stunningly frightening is Henry Kingsmill as the explosive Nazi officer, Karl.  And David Thewlis as the steady and determined Commandant is equally effective.

The direction combined with the writing is what makes this film really sail.  The contrast between the innocence of the two boys and the action going on about them is powerful, creating a view of racism that seems all the more horrible when seen through the eyes of children who don't understand what is happening, what it all means.

Difficult and challenging, this film is an important look at racism and the massive sins of the Nazi regime.  It takes an event which seems both far away and achingly near to us in the time line and creates a truly horrifying and moving portrait of what can happen when madmen go unchecked.

3751571,3,B001PMR2KS,"As big fans of ""Life is Beautiful"" and some other fine WWII movies, my family and I watched this film with high expectations. We've visited a concentration camp in Austria and still get chills remembering the gas chambers and quarry.

The story is simple on the surface, yet full of ethical and emotional complexity. When a Nazi family moves from the big city so that the promoted father can help oversee a prison camp, his young son, Bruno, is unaware of the harsh realities involved. From sheer boredom, Bruno leaves the home's confines and discovers an electric barbed-wire fence at which he forms a friendship with the boy in the striped pajamas. This leads to some nice explorations of race and prejudice, as well as a harrowing example of innocence lost in hopes of strengthening a friendship.

The story's ending is cause for discussion and controversy, but I was already struggling to appreciate the movie before this. Not only do the Nazis all have strong British accents, they also speak with British slang at points, even saying ""by miles"" when kilometers are the continental standard. I was willing to get past this due to the strong acting, but the physical landscape was also not German in appearance. I've spent months in Germany, and this looked nothing like the regions I visited--lacked pine trees, cliffs, mountains--and even the city at the beginning looks nothing like Berlin.

With accents and scenery already breaking some of the magic for me, I was further distracted by the seeming freedom the boys had to chat at will along the fence. Despite one guard tower visible in the distance, no one seems to notice the intruder or the absent prisoner. In ""Life is Beautiful,"" a distinct fable-like quality allowed such things to work, but here I felt only duped and emotionally manipulated.

The photography and acting were well done, the script had some nice moments of dialogue, but I was on the fence throughout, wanting to like it while finding too many sources of distraction.",1242518400,3,1999,4.887905604719764
3751572,2,B001PMR2KS,"I think this movie was made in the UK because the very first thing I noticed was that all the characters had English ascents. I've never read the book but I did know it was meant to be a children's story and so I assumed that the movie would be much gentler. At the beginning I felt you didn't get a very good sense of the German culture at the time, subtract the Nazi flags and it could just as easily have been London or New York 1943 than Berlin. But I excused all of this because, again I assumed it was meant to be a children's story and more of a family movie.
 When Bruno first meats the little Jewish boy, my first thought was that this isn't at all historically correct. The grandparents didn't make it through the selection process and were sent to the showers but the eight-year-old little  boy did? But then I told myself, this isn't Auschwitz, in some of the smaller concentration camps they didn't always kill so many of the children.
 When Bruno decides he's going to dig under the fence and get into the camp, my mom screamed beside me ""Oh my God! I don't want to watch this anymore! Their going to think he's a Jew and he'll die in the camp!"" The thought had never occurred to me because I thought this was a children's story, I had no idea how I expected to it to end but that didn't seem right.
 I am Jewish myself and have been, let's say desensitized at a young age. I remember sitting in religious school when I was nine watching my teacher draw a detailed map of Germany on the board and placing a dot to represent a camp. But I found myself asking after I watched this movie, did they mean for it to be a Schindler's List?
 Throughout the movie you feel this conflict, perhaps it was in the book as well, I don't know, but it was as though the writers or the director weren't sure what feeling they wanted to give you. I truly believe this movie could have gone two ways and either would be equally good, but the movie tried to go both ways.
 Option 1: It could have been a feel good children's story. Bruno could have dug under the fence and the other boy could have come out. Bruno's mother could have found them in the forest and smuggled them away, leaving her husband, and the boy could have passed as one of the family, slipping seamlessly into the rest of society.
 Option 2: It could have been an all out, hard core, R rated, Holocaust movie. I didn't like the casting of the father, he was too soft, (for those of you who have read The Book Thief, he would have made the perfect Hans Hubermann, the man on the wrong side of the war) he acted too much like ""I'm doing this because I have to to be respected and protect my family, not because I truly believe that this is right."" The story would need to have focused more on how awful dad's views were and the little boys and the fence would have needn't to be a side story. When the boy dies, you would need to feel terrible because you cared about him, but you would have had to really believe that the father deserved it and that would be the doninating feeling. I think the key with this would have been better casting of the father.
 I would have had a hard time deciding which way it should have gone, especially because it seems to be being used as a teaching tool but I don't believe it was very well done and I would not recommend it. It could have been a Schindler's List or it could have been a Life is Beautiful but not both.",1242432000,4,3418,4.191780821917808

3751574,3,B001PMR2KS,"I really had a hard time figuring out a rating for this film.  It is also tough to rate this movie without giving away the ending but I have to try.  Overall the movie was very interesting.  You never get to see the other side of the ""Nazi's"".  The movie portrays a Nazi military family who doesn't exactly know what their father does.  The movie is the journey of the family from big city life out to a concentration camp in the country side.

The mother is kept in the dark about the actual goings on.  The main story is about a curious boy who can't stand to be stuck in his house.  He is an adventurer who ends up finding out that there is a ""camp"" near his house.  Though he is only 8 and doesn't understand what is going on, it is his journey of understanding that we follow in the movie.  Overall I would say it was a 4 star movie until the ending.  The ending is tough to deal with and for me it dropped the rating quite a bit.

I would not necessarily recommend this movie to anybody.  It is a light but dark drama and if I had known what I was getting myself into I probably wouldn't have watched.  Just trying to being honest without giving everything away.",1242432000,,1168,4.133333333333334
3751575,5,B001PMR2KS,"Alot of people comment on the 'sheltered' nature of the protagonist Bruno, and the childlike naievity he displays, and yes, I would say that the movie has its flaws...but in a larger sense, the movie is important in raising the issue of culpability in German society at large in regards to the Holocaust. It really makes one stop and think about how much, and what, the populance at large really knew about what was going on, and to what degree the wives and children of the men who were perpetrating this knew and how they dealt with it.. The Nazi propaganda machine was a very powerful force, anyone who has seen the films they produced as justification would agree that they are both evil and effective. SPOILERS-(The video made about the camps in the movie definitely made me think about those other propaganda films I had seen. One of the most haunting moments is when Bruno recognizes the stones from the propaganda film near the end.)While some parts of the movie are not incredibly believable... the overall issues they bring up are what is important. I have taken a lot of psychology courses that have dealt with cognitive dissonance and specifically with genocide and the Holocaust, and this movie is definitely a powerful force in bringing those issues to bear.

3751577,5,B001PMR2KS,"Eight year-old Bruno, (Asa Butterfield), is an innocent, carefree boy growing up in Berlin during WWII. As the film opens, we see him running through the city's streets with his three best friends, their arms outstretched, pretending to be airplane pilots and feigning battles. Seemingly oblivious, they race past scenes of Jews being rounded up to be taken to concentration camps. Bruno, with his wonderful sense of adventure, wants to be an explorer when he grows up.

He lives in a beautiful mansion, complete with gardens and servants, along with his twelve year-old sister Gretel, (Amber Beattie), their beautiful mother, (Vera Farmiga), and their father, a high ranking SS officer, (David Thewlis). After Bruno's and Gretel's father receives a promotion, a brand new title, ""Commandant,"" along with a fancier uniform, the family moves to a deserted house in the countryside. The house, a cold and somber place, with SS Stormtroopers everywhere, is actually SS Headquarters. The father's new job is to administer a concentration camp - a death camp - Auschwitz. Bruno is miserable in his new home. He misses his friends and school. There is no one to play with and he is very bored. His father tells him that, ""Home is where the family is."" And, ""Being a soldier is about duty instead of choice."" They cannot move back to Berlin.

Because there is no school for the children to attend, a tutor is hired to educate them...and he does so from books filled with Nazi propaganda. When the little boy asks him about ""nice Jews,"" the teacher responds, ""I think, Bruno, if you ever found a nice Jew, you would be the greatest explorer in the world."" Gretel soon begins to model herself after the ""ideal"" Nazi youth, plastering the walls of her room with photographs of Hitler and children from the Nazi Youth Group, a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party. Bruno is not buying any of it. His tutor's teachings make no sense to him, given his budding sense of reason, and his earlier, relatively propaganda free, background. His paternal grandmother is anti-Nazi, and his mother is apolitical, but dutifully supportive of her husband.

From his bedroom window, the boy notices a town of people dressed in striped pajamas separated from him by a wire fence. He thinks that the people are farmers. He wants to go and play with some of the children he sees, but is forbidden to leave the grounds. When he asks his father who those people are, Dad responds that they aren't really people. Bruno also asks questions about the smoke he sees rising from the ""farm"" and the terrible smell that accompanies it. When his mother discovers the reality of the camp, all the terrible details, she deteriorates mentally and emotionally into a shallow shell...no longer the vibrant woman we met in the opening scenes.

With his avid curiosity and adventurous spirit, the boy finds a way out of the compound and eventually comes to the barbed wire fences surrounding the camp. He is totally bewildered by what he sees. On the other side of the fence is another eight year-old boy, Shmuel, (Jack Scanlon), a broken waif of a child wearing a numbered uniform. Shmuel lives a very different life than Bruno. He is a Jew, and along with the rest of his family, a prisoner in the camp. He sometimes hides by the fence, during work detail, where he meets Bruno and the two form a friendship. Bruno brings food for Shmuel and the two play checkers, with the board on Bruno's side of the fence. But Bruno still doesn't ""get it.""  The enormity of the evil confronting him is beyond his comprehension. He believes that the numbered striped pajamas are part of a game played inside the barbed wire enclosure. He asks his friend what is burned in the chimneys.

Their friendship is an allegory of sorts. Producer David Heyman explained in the press notes that, ""Children have the potential and the ability to overcome differences in culture and identity; that people ultimately can get along if they're not encouraged to hate; that governments, institutions and the media can and do cultivate conflict and distrust-- these are timely ideas with universal relevance and I think this story makes them accessible to anyone."" At the beginning of the film, a quotation by poet John Betjeman appears on the screen, ""Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows.

Obviously nothing good can come from this Holocaust story...how can it? The final scenes had a visceral impact on me, and I sat stunned,  in pain, for some time after the movie ended.

""Striped Pajamas"" is based on Irish author John Boyne's critically acclaimed,  award-winning young adult novel of the same title. The book is meant to educate young adults about the Holocaust. Having read the book, I think the film version is much more explicit. I believe that the manner in which the content is depicted, although done with great sensitivity and compassion, is too harsh for a young person to view. I am Jewish, and a mother, and I feel that it is so important to educate all people, especially our youth, about this most heinous event. But I prefer to do so by introducing books, like ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" before exposing children and ""tweens"" to such a disturbing drama.

Ultimately ""The Boy In The Striped Pajamas"" is about the beauty of the human spirit. The acting is exceptional, especially the performances by the three talented children, Asa Butterfield, Jack Scanlon and Amber Beattie. I do recommend this film highly. I just want the prospective viewer to be forewarned as to the strength and impact of the narrative.

3751578,5,B001PMR2KS,"This movie is not a ""feel-good"" movie that you walk away happy.  It is a movie that you see real evolution of characters.  The movie takes place in very dark times of world history, being World War II; and is tied to the catastrophic events of the extermination of the Jews by the Nazis.

The story follows a family that covers the innocence of children, the misguided ideology of Nazi leadership, and the changing view of the civilian population.  The ending is dark and depressing.

Overall this is an excellent film creating awareness of a historical event that everyone needs to learn about and understand.  We can't deny such events and this is a great movie that also brings awareness of the history.

Aside from the historical aspect of this film, the writers and directors did a great job in telling a story.  Character development is strong and thorough, the story is well developed, and overall it is a high quality story.  The development of the story and characters for this movie is the best I have seen for many years.  Since it is not a heavy special effects and action movie, it was able to have a quality story.

3751581,3,B001PMR2KS,"""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is a Holocaust movie from an intriguing point of view: that of an eight year-old boy. Bruno witnesses acts that must seem bizarre to a child who is struggling to comprehend that adults--even one's own father--can be evil. The proximity of innocence makes the acts of cruelty even more nauseating, even if they aren't of the same epic scope of ""Schindler's List"" or ""The Pianist"". Bruno is the very embodiment of curiosity, and luckily he questions the judgment of those who should know better.
  He moves into the country near a concentration camp and befriends a young boy who is supposedly the ""enemy"". But instead of pandering to racist rhetoric and being influenced by brainwashed Nazis, he comes to his own conclusions. Is the Jewish boy evil? Has he done anything mean to Bruno? Gradually Bruno realizes that his world is surrounded by lies--the internment camp is not a happy place, the shaved-head boy is not a grubby rodent, and perhaps his father's weaselly smile is hiding something sinister. In fact, Bruno proves to be less of a loyal friend than his imprisoned counterpart, denying knowledge of their friendship, which ultimately torments him and perhaps takes the first painful step toward building his conscience. If the movie had adhered to this formula, it would have been miraculous. But it takes a strange twist at the end...
  WARNING SPOILERS HEAD! ACHTUNG! CUIDADO!!! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY WATCHED THE MOVIE! YOU THERE!! THE ONE DROOLING ALL OVER HIS KEYBOARD AFTER MY REVIEW SENT HIM INTO A STATE OF CATATONIA...OR IS IT NARCOLEPSY? AT LEAST THEN THERE WOULD BE A MEDICAL EXCUSE FOR SOMEONE FALLING ASLEEP WHEN READING THIS...ANYWAY...
...that seems out of synch with the rest of the movie. The movie builds quietly, with subtle skill, then becomes overwhelmingly tragic. The slow-burning tone erupts into a cataclysm. I am at a loss to understand the director's intent. Or, since this movie is based on a children's book, I am confused as to the author's motivation. Is it that the sins of the father are eventually paid upon his son? Bruno sneaking into the camp certainly reveals his character's sense of adventure, and trying to find his friend's father reveals a desire to seek atonement for his recent betrayal, but the ending still seems murky. Is Bruno's father going to renounce the horrors of anti-Semitism after stumbling upon the body of his son, who has choked on Zyklon-B? Is it an accusation against the mother, who knows that her husband is presiding over hell, yet refuses to steal his children away from him? Is Bruno the sacrificial lamb, suffocating on toxic vapor so his sister will learn a lesson? Am I reading too far into this? Does every movie need to have a profound message? Am I too dumb to fathom it?
  The very fact that I have so many questions makes me suspect the ending was emotionally powerful but logically muddled. The heavy-handedness of it actually took away some of its emotional impact. I was more moved by Bruno's guilt over betraying his friend than I was when he huddled in the shower stall, waiting for a cascade of water that became lung-drowning cyanide. Bruno didn't have to die for the movie to be heartbreaking. His death only makes me scratch my head and wonder why a generous, kind-hearted boy has to strangle to give the film validity.",1240704000,7,3359,4.83304347826087
3751582,5,B001PMR2KS,"""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"" is a thoroughly compelling film of the highest quality.  It concerns the life of an eight year old German whose father is a high ranking officer in the SS.  The boy doesn't understand his father's task beyond him being a ""soldier"".  His naivety, however, slowly comes face to face with reality and, ultimately, tragic consequences.

The story is seen through the eyes of Bruno (Asa Butterfield) who leads a normal although privileged life in war time Berlin.  His life, however, changes when his father is transferred to the country as the commandant of a concentration camp.  The family's new home is, to the shock of Asa's mother, very close to the camp.

Asa is an adventurous youngster and he quickly finds the camp where, through the barbed wire, he befriends a boy in striped pyjamas.  He keeps this friendship from his family.  Indeed, he has trouble understanding what is exactly happening.  It is this naivety that will produce tragedy.

""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"" is one of the best films of the past year.  The only criticism that I could have is that it is hard to believe that a child would be kept in a concentration camp.  His work effort would have been minimal.  The Nazis would have promptly liquidated him.  Yet, this criticism aside, the film is utterly engrossing.  It would be churlish to downgrade the film on this point alone.  Overall, the film is magnificent and I recommend it to all.",1240704000,,1450,4.713147410358566
3751583,5,B001PMR2KS,"""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is a devastating film, powerful and moving, with a startling and completely unexpected, unforgiving ending that sears the viewer and makes the whole movie incredibly significant. At the beginning we see a privileged Nazi family living in Berlin amid street scenes in which almost robotic people go about their business while in the background Jews are being rounded up for the concentration camps.
 The protagonist, an eight year old boy, Bruno, played superbly by Asa Butterfield is oblivious to what is going on around him. In his play world he is probably a fighter airplane soaring through the skies. Ironically he may be playing war games in his mind. He's a gentle, likable lad who has a loving family.
The father, a loyal Nazi, though gentle, kindly as well, is assigned to a post in the country as the commandant of a concentration camp. In their walled compound the boy and his mother see the smoke rising from the nearby high chimney. Their servant is an older man who under his work clothes wears striped pajamas. We are aware of these details through the eyes of the mother and her son.
 The boy wanders out of the yard and comes upon the barbed wire fence of the camp. He meets an eight year old, Shmuel, also in striped pajamas, who is sad and hungry. They grow to be friends. Bruno is unaware of Shmuel's plight. There is a crucial denial scene in ""Striped"" just as there was between the two boys in ""The Kite Runner.""
The movie concerns the onset of loss of innocence, and makes real the horrors of the Holocaust. The cinematography is outstanding; the acting is peerless.
Can it be that the familial tunnel vision of human beings toward the plight of all humanity will be the downfall of the human species?
It's a very significant work, a human drama that should move viewers. There is no phony manipulative sentimentality in this work. Very highly recommended.",1240617600,,1911,4.701492537313433

Having given them some of the horrific background surrounding those in the movie enabled them to understand better what was going on.

It was a great movie and my kids agreed. They watched it a second time. The thing I liked about the movie was the fact that the film used the Holocaust as a backdrop, not as some politcal statement. It was there, just not in your face.

The story was captivating, the ending completely unexpected. The three of us who watched it had a completely different ending envisioned. But I think as it unfolded, it made the movie much more powerful.

3751587,3,B001PMR2KS,"Of all the Holocaust dramatizations I've ever seen, this one was easily the most contrived. Though I really wanted to like it, I quickly realized it wasn't going to be able to live up to the expectations I had for it.

Not knowing a great deal about the plot beforehand, the idea of a movie about the Holocaust approached from the perspective of a young German boy seemed a really intriguing idea. But in translating that idea to film, something was lost.

Though it might seem an inconsequential and trivial point to some, as an English film with English actors, for me, a good deal of credibility was lost up front. And there were other problems here. The notion of a camp inmate being able to slip away unnoticed, presumably about the same time each day, to talk, play, and share food with his young German companion - who would ultimately be able to dig under the electric fence that divided them, also unnoticed, seemed particularly far-fetched. What's more, the wife of the Nazi commander who is responsible for operations at Auschwitz has no clue that Jews were being sent there to die, or that her husband is there to make sure this happens according to plan. At times she even seems sympathetic to the plight of the Jews, thanking the prisoner who worked in her house for bandaging her son's knee, wincing when he is beaten, and looking on with an obvious sense of disapproval in finding her daughter's bedroom plastered with Nazi images, even questioning what the new tutor was teaching her children. The notion of an unsuspecting, compassionate woman as the wife of a high-ranking Nazi official was perhaps the hardest idea of all to swallow. Was the intention here to soften a much harsher reality because that reality - that she knew exactly what was going on and agreed fully with her husband that Jews could not be considered people - was too much to ask viewers to digest?

Other things were ""off"" here as well. The way in which the two boys communicate with each other, particularly in the beginning, seems more befitting men many years older than a couple of eight year olds. And young Bruno's perception of the concentration camp as a farm, its inmates as pajama-clad strangers, and the prisoner in his house as a man who willingly ""gave it all up"" (meaning his career as a doctor) to peel potatoes - which should have been able to come off as genuine enough as an eight year old's observation - somehow didn't.

The young boys were really quite good actors, so kudos to them. I can't say the same for the actresses who portrayed the mother and sister - their performances were a bit on the bland side. And David Thewliss, an actor I've admired for some time, was simply miscast here.

All this aside, the last twenty minutes build in intensity to deliver a final unexpected wallop - powerful enough to almost overlook the problems unraveled in the first hour.

Though it could have been a lot better, the film makes a point about the utter senselessness of man's inhumanity to man, and if it makes young people interested in learning more about the Holocaust, then in the final analysis, it was an important film.",1240099200,3,3133,4.646209386281589

3751591,5,B001PMR2KS,"How wonderful it must be to see the world through the eyes of an oblivious child.  There are no jobs, no wars, no famine, no taxes, no real thought of danger.  For a young boy named Bruno (Asa Butterfield), the naivety and innocence could prove to be potentially dangerous.

An up-and-coming SS officer (David Thewlis) is given a promotion; and as a result of his new assignment, his family is forced to move.  Traveling from the relative safety of Berlin to a very large, remote house was not what anyone other than the father expected.  Simultaneously supportive and reluctant, his family - especially the mother (played with heart-breaking emotion by Vera Farmiga) - soon realizes their new home is adjacent to an active concentration camp.

With more than a passing resemblance to a mini-Hitler, Bruno is a typically adventurous boy.  Having a soldier for a father is a source of pride and admiration for him; he'd love nothing better than to emulate his father.  He initially notices the local ""gardeners"" in ""pajamas"" and becomes intrigued.  While exploring the woods in his backyard, something strictly forbidden from by his mother, he comes across the nearby camp and meets Shmuel (Scanlon), an emaciated, filthy eight-year old Jewish prisoner.  The two form a tenuous and dangerous friendship, discussing their childish similarities, but also uncovering at least one significant difference: their feeling towards soldiers.  Neither understands the precariousness of their surroundings, nor do they understand the hideous smells coming from a burning smokestack very nearby.

Eventually their shared innocence disintegrates under the pressure of their real world surroundings as Bruno attempts to comprehend why everyone seems to hate the Jews even though his friend Shmuel is such a nice guy.  The final jaw-dropping moment shines light on the possibility of tragedy when one is ignorant, oblivious, or purposefully turning a blind eye to the surrounding dangers.

The performances from all are incredibly moving.  Witnessing not only the loss of Jewish childhood via the stolen dignity, humanity, and life itself, but also that of the German childhood manipulated via the indoctrination of Nazi propaganda, truly delivers an incredibly heave message that resonates long after the movie is complete.

3751594,5,B001PMR2KS,"There are a good number of well-written reviews posted here, mostly from folks who think this is a very good to excellent film. I count myself amongst them.

I will start out by acknowledging some of the criticism of the film in regards to the age of the young German boy and that by that age, he would have been intuitive enough to know what was going on behind the electrified fence. For those of us who make films (I'm an indy guy myself), try and find a young child who is 5 or 6 who can pull off the depth of the performances these young boys did in this film. Ain't easy, is it? So, while I agree-- to a point-- I understand the necessity of their age and I do feel the story transcends that.

I also disagree with some of the reviewers who think this is brave filmmaking. It's not. It's good filmmaking and an excellent story but I see no bravery in this effort.

Okay, now that I've been honest in the flaws I see, I must again applaud the performances of these two young men. I knew nothing of them before I saw this film but I am looking forward to any opportunity to watch either of them again. I also thought the film was well-made and that the slight twist, post tunneling under the fence, was excellent.

This was one of the best new films I have seen in several years and it's a shame it was panned.

3751604,5,B001PMR2KS,"I never read this book, but it's one that after watching this movie, I wish I had.  The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a nice slow paced film that has sort of a ""day in the life of"" feel to it.  Young Bruno is 8 years old and pretending to be an airplane flying through the streets of Berlin playing with his friends.  When he arrives home, he discovers that he has to move away and leave his friends.  His father, a German Commander, has to go away because he has a new job and he's taking his family with him.

At first, Bruno's new home seems very office-like and cold, until a distant farm he can see from his bedroom window catches his interest.  But the farm seems odd.  All the farmers are wearing striped pajamas.  A tutor comes to teach Bruno and his sister.  His sister soon loses all interest in her dolls and turns to the current events - the war and the extermination of the Jews.  But Bruno doesn't understand.  He wants to get outside the garden walls and away from the house to go exploring.  When he finally escapes, he approaches the barbed wire fence surrounding the ""farm"" and he finds another 8 year old boy like himself on the other side of the wire.

For me, Bruno's niavity of the situation is a lot like the way America was during the Holocaust.  Bruno is proud of his father, but he has no idea that his father is in charge of an extermination camp.  He has no idea what takes place in the camp.  He even sees a propaganda film which makes the camp appear like a vacation and Bruno thinks his father is a good man.  But unfortunately, commanders in such positions had to swear on their life.  They couldn't even tell their wives what was happening.  We see this in the movie as the relationship between husband and wife begins to fall apart when Bruno's mother discovers what is happening after she asks the commander's assistant about the foul smell in the air coming from the chimneys.

In the meantime, Bruno steals food to take to his friend, but he doesn't know why his new friend doesn't like to play ball over the fence. Why is it dangerous?  And why must his friend always run away when the horn sounds?  When his new friend gets a chance to come to Bruno's house to clean the drinking glasses, Bruno gives him a snack but a guard catches him.  Bruno lies and says he doesn't know the boy and that he stole the food.  Bruno returns to the barbed wire fence for several days, eager to apologize, but his friend is not there.  Of course, you fear the worst thinking the boy has been killed due to Bruno's actions, but the young prisoner soon returns.  To make up for what he did, Bruno wants to help the boy find his father, but he soon discovers his friendship with the boy in the striped pajamas could have dangerous consequences.

Most of us have been touched by the story of Anne Frank or some other Holocaust story that we read in our history books or saw in the movie theater.  This movie will be no different for you.  The innocence you see on the screen just in the two boys' eyes alone will pierce your heart and haunt you.  Like me, you'll probably hold your breath through most of it as if you were walking on egg shells.  Holocaust movies rarely have a happy ending, but I'm not going to spoil this ending for you.  I'll just say that you will indeed come away a better person after seeing this film!",1238198400,3,3343,4.2992
3751605,4,B001PMR2KS,"It seems a bit odd to describe this movie as good....but it really is.  I suspected what happened in the movie.  It was interesting to watch war from a childs innocent view.

3751606,4,B001PMR2KS,"I've read the book upon which this movie is based, and also reviewed it. The book makes for a thoughtful discussion on the Holocaust, though it did have some problems having to do with plot implausibilities. Yet despite all of that, I did think the book added some value to novels dealing with the Holocaust, especially in portraying the story from the 8-year-old German Aryan boy's point of view.

Now on to the movie - the story follows the book closely with some adaptations. Set during WW II, 8-year-old German Aryan, Bruno finds his carefree life in Berlin is about to come to an end as his father [David Thelis] has been promoted to the position of Kommandant thus necessitating the family's move to a rural outpost which is nameless. So, Bruno [Asa Butterfield], his 12-year-old sister Gretel [Amber Beattie], mother [Vera Farmiga] and dad make the move. Bruno is initially not impressed with his new surroundings - there are no other houses nearby and the children are not able to attend school, having to be taught by an old tutor who very much subscribes to Nazi ideology, pummeling the children with his ideology of hatred every chance he gets. Young Bruno in the meantime has discovered a 'farm' close by and to his immense delight, meets another 8-year-old boy with the curious name of Schmuel [Jack Scanlon] who seems to have tons of 'friends' and has the luxury of wearing 'pajamas' all day. Though he is forbidden to explore the back of the house, Bruno makes clandestine visits to his friend, who sadly cannot play with him as they are separated by a barbed wire fence, which Bruno thinks is to keep the animals out. The pairs friendship grows every day, and Bruno begins to discover certain things - that Jews are not treated well [he doesn't really buy the ""Jews are evil"" idea], and begins to see his father in a different light [the Kommandant keeps silent when a Jewish houseworker is pummeled by a sadistic Nazi underling]. In the meantime, Bruno's mother Ilse [Vera Farmiga] begins to fall apart as she comes to discover what really goes on in the camps [extermination of Jews] and suffers an emotional breakdown. The rest of the story deals with what happens to Bruno and Schmuel and the others.

There are some plot implausibilities - the fact that Bruno is so incredibly naive about Jews and the ideology of hatred against them is hard to accept if only because most German Aryan boys of Bruno's age would have been in the Hitler Youth and thus exposed to such teachings. Bruno being a high-ranking Nazi officer's son would most certainly have been in the Hitler Youth as would his sister. Also, Ilse not knowing of what was going on in the camp [extermination] also seems implausible. As for Schmuel, most young children were immediately selected for the gas chambers upon arrival, and it seems almost miraculous that Schmuel survived for as long as he did, and was able to meet Bruno so often without detection.

But, implausibilities aside, I still liked this movie - it manages to portray the innocence of children in a depraved world so very credibly, and this is largely due to Asa Butterfield's amazing performance as the naive Bruno whose eyes are slowly 'opened' to the cruelty evident around him. Jack Scanlon's Schmuel is also credible -the chemistry between the two boys is very real, and their friendship is altogether believable, even the part when Bruno 'betrays' his friend and Schmuel's reaction to this. Vera Farmiga's performance as the tormented Ilse is the most powerful adult performance in this movie - she delivers a finely-nuanced performance that makes us believe Ilse was truly horrified by what was being done to the Jews. The other adult male characters delivered rather weak performances - David Thewlis as the Kommandant was stiff in his role and seemed ill at ease for the most part, the sadistic Nazi driver seemed very much a one-dimensional character, and even the Jewish houseworker was not given much character development.

All in all, ""Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" succeeds in getting under one's skin and doesn't cop out with a happily ever after ending, for the climax is brutal and mind-numbing. The child actors' powerful performances enables the movie to address questions about humanity and man's capacity for evil.",1238025600,3,4286,4.843110504774898

3751608,4,B001PMR2KS,"I found the film The Boy in the Striped Pajamas a very good and moving film.  It is every bit as good as the novella and it really puts faces on the characters, especially the particularly brutal ones.  The heavy British accents of the actors, however, hinder the portrayals of the performers as being not only Nazis, but also as Germans.  Perhaps actual German dialog with English subtitles would have been more effective as has been provided in many other powerful films involving the war.  It is, however, a powerful example of how hate is taught and learned, and that a righteous might can be assumed for virtually any cause or philosophy regardless of how many have to die to justify it.  It is still well worth watching, and the ending is totally numbing.  The ending was not foreshadowed throughout the film.  I would highly recommend this film as an educational tool, especially for middle-school age children and as an introduction to the Holocaust.  In this age of neo-nazism and holocaust denial it can really define hate movements and intolerance for what they can become and are, and the unexpected consequences of such choices.",1238025600,3,1141,4.845360824742268

3751614,5,B001PMR2KS,"This is the saddest movie you're likely to see ever, not so much for the wrenching intimate tragedy it portrays but for the historical reality that it epitomizes. Could you possibly make sense of this film if you knew nothing at all about the mass murder of Jews in Hitler's Germany and the lands that Germany occupied? I don't think so! Fortunately, there are few people that ignorant of history alive right now, although there are a vicious few who deny it. Clearly, this is a film not just about two boys but also about the species that labels itself scientifically as Homo sapiens -- ""Human knowing"".

Having survived 60% of the Twentieth Century, I can testify that it was the most tragic on record. Yeah, yeah, we were born with higher life expectancies and we had shinier toys. But it was the century of mass murder, conducted by the polity that we had supposedly evolved to manage our savagery. The most extensive mass murders were generated by ideologies wrapped in racism and nationalism, and sometimes sheathed with phony science. Do I need to indict the murderers here? Nearly all of Europe, even including France, had temporary governments that helped Hitler murder Jews. Stalin's USSR murdered uncountable millions. Cambodia. Uganda. Rwanda. Chile. Argentina, El Salvador and more ... murderous governments. Those rabid denouncers of the national/federal government of the USA should take note: though racism and xenophobia and fanaticism thrived in the USA also in the 20th C, the federal government never fell into the paws of the mass murderers. In fact, though the feds were guilty of segregationist behavior and repression of some forms of thought, much more obviously the federal government took effective measures to moderate the racist behaviors of state governments and of ""us the People.""

What does this have to do with a movie review? Everything! Because this movie made me think of history at every frame. It also made my wife cry on my shoulder disconsolately, and it made my teenage son turn off his laptop and stop wise-cracking for the rest of the evening. If you haven't already been informed of the scenario, here it is: Bruno's father, an ambitious and convinced Nazi military officer, is appointed to command a ""work camp"" -- really a death camp -- in a remote rural area. He takes his family there. His 8-year-old son, Bruno, finds a way to sneak out of the safe but boring home compound. Bruno finds the fence that surrounds the imprisoned Jews and makes contact with a boy his age, in a striped uniform that Bruno takes for pajamas. Sitting on opposite sides of the barbwire, the two naive boys form a bond....

Some reviewers have objected that the boy Bruno, the central character, was implausibly naive, even for a pampered and protected eight-year-old. But the boy is something bigger than a single child; he's a synecdoche of the Germans (and Americans!) who ""didn't know"" and couldn't believe and perhaps couldn't care enough until it was too late. I suppose I'm taking the film as an allegory.

Bruno's father and grandfather, seemingly decent men committed to duty and patriotism, are in fact ""whited sepulchers"" of ideology gone mad. They are surely Goldhagen's ""willing executioners."" The mother and grandmother are shown to be conscience-stricken, but they too are executioners, unwilling if you want to defend them, but guilty of passivity.  Once again thinking allegorically, I'm tempted to see all of Germany's postwar agony on the faces of the horrified parents.

If this movie seems more to you than an evening's vicarious 'entertainment,' I suggest that you get acquainted with the books of W. G. Sebald, especially ""Austerlitz"" and ""The Emigrants."" Sebald is postwar Germany's greatest writer and most profound analyst of guilt.",1237248000,8,3784,5.007949125596184
3751615,5,B001PMR2KS,"Prepare yourself: you will need tissues for this one.  This is a Holocaust movie with sufficient realism to remind the viewer that this horror did in fact happen.  Definitely NOT a movie for the younger kids.

This film took the various views of the Holocaust during that time. It is through an eight-year-old boy, Bruno, that we see events unfold. Bruno's father, Ralf, is a Nazi soldier, a highly ranked one at that.  Bruno's grandfather is proud of his son's position in the German military, convinced that his son is ""making history.""  Bruno's grandmother is a German citizen who opposes Hitler's views, much to the chagrin of her own son.  And Bruno's mother is a society wife, who at the beginning of the film is concerned only with her own family and their secular German life.  At the beginning, you see these four points of view and how sheltered Bruno has been -- politics isn't discussed in front of the children, so Bruno and his older sister Gretel have a cheerfully ignorant childhood.

When Ralf is promoted, he brings his wife and children away from Berlin  to a ""house in the country."" Bruno hates this move until he peeks out of the window and discovers a ""farm"" a ways away.  He wonders aloud why the farmers wear their pajamas all day long.  Bruno's questions are ignored.  He asks his father what the funny smell is coming from the chimneys far away ... and his father dismisses it gruffly, saying, ""They burn rubbish over there.""  Bruno wonders how the nice man -- Pavel -- who peels potatoes knew how to treat his wound after a bad fall.  Pavel tells him that he ""used to practice as a doctor before ... coming here.""  Pavel doesn't tell the young boy what is going on, that he's Jewish ... or that the ""farm"" is really a concentration camp.

An exploring Bruno discovers a boy named Shmuel (pronounced ""Shmall"") who's his exact age, sitting on the ""farm""/camp side of a barbed wire fence in striped pajamas. When Bruno asks his new friend why he's wearing pajamas with numbers, if it's part of a game, he is quickly informed that soldiers took his other clothes away and that it is not a game.  ""I don't much care for soldiers, do you?"" Shmuel asks.  Bruno tells him, ""I do.  My father's a soldier -- but not the kind that takes people's clothes away.""  Bruno asks why there is barbed wire, wondering aloud if it's to keep animals from getting out.  Shmuel explains that it's to keep people from getting out.  When Bruno presses the matter, his friend explains just why -- Shmuel is a Jew.

Bruno and Shmuel become good friends, despite their different backgrounds and situations.  In one critical moment, he makes a mistake he immediately regrets and seeks to correct it somehow for his friend.  For Shmuel, he will right the wrong ... no matter what.  Without hesitation, the boys make a pact ... one made in innocence and friendship. The two young actors that played Bruno and Shmuel were great, both with expressive eyes and good delivery on every line.  David Thewlis (Lupin from the ""Harry Potter"" films) is excellent as Bruno's father in this movie, especially in the movie's poignant final scenes ... a great job in a very complicated role.

At the end, my jaw dropped and I had tears in my eyes.  I doubt I would add this to my own collection (I borrowed this), but I can say that I do not regret seeing it.  The ending is both staggering and chilling, the final shot of the film is poignant in its realism.  If you appreciated Schindler's List for its historical relevance, then you would also appreciate this movie.",1237075200,3,3550,4.596184419713832
3751616,5,B001PMR2KS,"THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS is a 'compleat' motion picture: even the title states the vision of the film in a subtly powerful way. Based on the excellent novel by John Boyne and adapted for the screen by director Mark Herman, this film has the courage to re-visit the Holocaust from the child's perspective.  Not that it covers up the atrocities of that horrid event and time - quite the opposite: in electing to examine that period in history the stance is that of two children, one German son of an officer in Hitler's armed forces and one son of a Jewish captive living with his father in a concentration camp.  The juxtaposition of these two eight year old boys separated not only by a fence but by an ideology neither of them can fathom the other's side makes for not only a brilliant film but also an unforgettable emotional experience.

 Bruno (Asa Butterfield in an extraordinary performance) is eight, his sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) is twelve and the two live with their parents in 1940 Berlin - father (David Thewlis) is a Komandant in  Hitler's army and mother (Vera Farminga) is a popular socialite and loving mother.  Father is 'promoted' and will be in charge of a new 'position' that means moving from their beautiful Berlin home to a 'home in the country'. Though Bruno doesn't want to leave his friends the family does indeed move - to a cold house next to what Bruno perceives is a farm. The father is forbidden to share his role and the meaning of it with his family, but it soon becomes obvious by the smoke stacks spewing hideously smelling odors into the atmosphere that the 'farm' is a concentration camp. The house servant Pavel (David Hayman), though abused by the father, becomes Bruno's friend when Bruno sustains an injury: Pavel quietly admits to Bruno that despite his 'pajama' uniform from the 'farm' that he practiced medicine in the past.  Bored, Bruno explores the forbidden area outside his home confines and finds a barbed wire electrified fence behind which sits Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) who becomes Bruno's friend.  Neither lad understands the differences between them until Shmuel is sent into Bruno's household to polish glasses for a party: the armed forces chauffeur Lieutenant Kotler (Rupert Friend) beats the 'little filthy Jew' for eating pastries Bruno has shared with him - a fact that the terrified Bruno denies.

The mother discovers the truth about the 'farm' and the smoke stacks and sinks into a depression, loathing that her husband is in charge of such atrocities.  Gretel becomes transformed as a Hitler youth under the influence of the children's tutor (Jim Norton) and there are obvious philosophical schisms in the family.  Bruno, regretting his treatment of Shmuel, continues to sneak food to him and plans to help his young friend save Shmuel's father: Bruno digs into the 'farm' and the results bring the film to a terrifying and abrupt end.

Both young actors give enormously moving performances and the manner in which Herman directs the action underlines the blur of perception many German's had about the reality of the Final Solution.  But for what this viewer perceives as the reason the film sustains the powerful message it does is the manner in which it ends. There are no attempts to 'sanitize' this film: it simply ends with a lightning bolt jolt that is one of the most powerful statements in all of the many films about the Holocaust.  It is simply a brilliant masterpiece of a movie from every aspect of judging it - acting, direction, music, cinematography, editing - and why this film failed to make an impression on the critics and public (and the Oscar folks!) when it was released in the theaters remains a conundrum.  Highly recommended for all audiences. Grady Harp, March 09",1237075200,16,3760,4.825816485225506

Great character development was a strenght but also a weakness. Since I grew to care about the characters, the ending was too much for me to handle. I hated that last scene!!!

3751621,4,B001PMR2KS,"2008 was a very big year for films adapted from books, with several reaching the high acclaim of Academy Award nominations.  One adapted film that didn't get much recognition, however, is The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, based on the novel by John Boyne.

The film opens with the following quote emblazoned on the screen:  ""Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows.""  As the quote suggests, this is a sort of coming of age film, and over the course of 94 minutes,those in the audience slowly watch the innocence of children unravel before their eyes as the reality of what is taking place becomes more and more illuminated.

The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is the story of a family living in Berlin during World War II. The main character, an eight-year-old boy named Bruno (Asa Butterfield), spends his time in Berlin playing with his friends and reading adventure novels.  His father, brilliantly played by David Thewlis (most will recognize him as Professor Lupin from the Harry Potter franchise), soon gets a promotion, however, and Bruno, his parents, and his sister move to the German countryside where his father will take up his new position.  Unlike their time in Berlin, Bruno's parents are careful to keep their son close to home, and Bruno, an explorer and adventurer at heart, is confined to the small fenced area surrounding their house.

From his bedroom window, Bruno can see what he thinks is a strange farm off in the distance.  He notices that the ""farmers"" act strangely and wear strange ""pajamas"" while they work.  Later, he notices that the smokestacks on the farm give off an absolutely wretched stench when they are burning.  By now, of course, the audience knows that what Bruno has seen is not a farm at all, and that his father's new position is Commandant of the nearby concentration camp.

The naive Bruno manages to escape from the grounds of his home and is finally free to explore the woods behind the house.  Not paying much attention to where he is going, he happens upon a remote part of the camp where he meets another eight-year-old boy, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), confined by a different kind of fence. The two become friends, and Bruno sneaks away every chance he gets to go and visit the only playmate he has found since moving away from Berlin.

This is an interesting film on many accounts, the most fascinating being the changes that each member of Bruno's family undergoes.  His father, a seemingly reluctant, ""political only"" Nazi at the beginning, devolves into a hardened, harsh man.  Bruno's sister Gretel (Amber Beattie), encouraged by a handsome lieutenant working with her father, falls victim to the Aryan propaganda so much that her room is soon filled with posters of the Fuhrer, much like young girls today would adorn their walls with images of the Jonas Brothers. Finally, there's Bruno's mother (Vera Farmiga), who is the antithesis to the growing Nazism in her family.  At first she is happy for her husband and the success he has as a soldier in the German army.  However, as she learns more about her husband's new charge, and the truth is revealed about the camp, she becomes bitter and angry.

And then there's Bruno.  All the signs are there.  Bruno comes across every hint he possibly could as to the truth behind the ""farm"" where his friend Shmuel lives and works.  Yet he remains utterly oblivious.  Caught between the two stages of ""sounds and smells and sights"" and ""the dark hour of reason,"" the filmmakers show the great price of failing to deal with the world around us.

Much of the criticism that I've read regarding this film deals with the supposed overextension of innocence to both child characters.  Many critics cannot grasp the idea of an eight-year-old child not understanding that the ""farm"" is really a horrible work camp, that the ""pajamas"" are prison clothes, that the mysterious disappearances that Shmuel tells of and the smoke from the chimneys are the results of the systematic slaughter of the camp's inhabitants.  That may be a fair criticism, but I think it misses the greater point that the filmmakers seem to be making.

Bigger than a child's loss of innocence, Bruno seems to be a representation of Germany, perhaps even humanity, itself, and the failure to deal with the evil right before one's very eyes.  So many Germans claimed the innocence that we see in Bruno, saying they had no knowledge of the Final Solution to the Jewish Problem that Hitler and his SS were carrying out across the European continent.  Even today, despite all the existing evidence, there are still those that deny the Holocaust happened, not wanting to acknowledge the great evil of which humanity, perhaps even their neighbors and family members, is capable.  More than anything else, this film shows the great price humanity pays for such utter naivete.

All in all, this is a very well done film.  The story, though slow in the beginning, is engaging, thought-provoking, and, in the end, heart-wrenching.  It is well-acted, especially in the performances of the young boys, and the bright colors and airy score provide a sort of bizarre juxtaposition to what is happening on screen.

The DVD includes the typical bonus features of deleted scenes and a feature-length commentary, as well as a featurette entitled ""Friendship Beyond the Fence.""",1236729600,400,5369,4.857299670691548

3751623,5,B001PMR2KS,"Powerful, innocent and absolutely tragic!  `THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS' is simply an amazing film.

The film focuses on a family of four focusing on the youngest, Bruno (Asa Butterfield), a naive young eight-year-old who loves playing ""airplanes"" with his friends.  But he learns that his father, a high ranking Nazi officer is being moved to a new area (to oversee a Jewish concentration camp) and thus it will be a start of a new life for Bruno and his family.

For Bruno's father (played by David Thewlis), the man does his job for their thinking of a better world and thus massacring the Jews.  Bruno's grandfather (Richard Johnson) is supportive and proud of his dad but his grandmother (Sheila Hacock) feels shame for his son.  Of course, that is the first major secret the family has kept (any German who objects to the Nazi way of thinking would be incarcerated or would be branded a traitor).

But the family begins their new life in their new home.  With armed guards and a Jewish slave/helper named Pavel, the family tries to get accustomed to their new surroundings.  Of course, Bruno is not to thrilled because he has no friends around him but outside his bedroom window, he sees a farm (actually, the concentration camp) and wonders why everyone is wearing striped pajamas.

His mother (Vera Farmiga) is shocked that they have moved not far from a concentration camp.  She thought they would be many miles away not right near it.  Meanwhile, Bruno's sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) who was a young daughter at 12-years-old fascinated with dolls, suddenly becomes fascinated with the young Nazi soldier who is a driver for the family.

But as much as his parents have told him to not look towards the ""farm"", Bruno runs off towards what he thinks is a farm and he sees a young boy sitting near the electric wired fence.  The boy is named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon).  Bruno is just happy to find someone young that he can play with but doesn't understand why he wears pajamas or can't play.  Shmuel is also naive himself.  He knows that he must follow the rules in the concentration camp but he sits in the corner behind a rock to be alone.

The two become friends and Bruno eventually comes to visit him everyday with food and so he can play games or talk with him.

Throughout the course of the film, we see Bruno, who doesn't fully understand the war and when he wants to read adventure books, his instructor teaches him about being proud to be Nazi and why he should despite the Jewish people.

This is where Bruno is confused because the servant named Pavel seems like a nice guy, Shmuel seems like a nice guy but his teacher tells him that there are no good Jewish people and if he ever found one, he would be a great explorer.

In the air outside the home, there is a putrid stench and sure enough Bruno's mother finds out from one of the soldiers that the smell is the cremation of Jewish people.  She is just in awe of how terrible they are being treated and thus leads to problems between her and her husband.  Her husband is doing his job but for Bruno's mother, she can't believe they are living near a concentration camp.

In one scene, the family witnesses during dinner time, Pavel accidentally spills wine on the table and literally taken to another room and kicked to death.

This pushes Bruno's mother even more to the edge now because  she has to witness the brutalization of Jewish people in her home.  Of course, Bruno is naive and not knowing what happened to Pavel.

Next thing you know, Pavel is replaced by Shmuel.  Bruno is so happy to have his friend now at his home and his friend looks so hungry, Bruno gives him some food.  But unfortunately, a Nazi soldier catches them and when Bruno is yelled at and asked how the Jewish boy got the food, in fear, Bruno tells the soldier that Shmuel stole it and thus Shmuel is taken in for punishment.

Because of his lie, Bruno knows he did something very bad and now his friend has gotten hurt.  But being a friend, Bruno wants to make it up to Shmuel.

""THE BOY IN STRIPED PAJAMAS"" deals with Bruno's naiveness but yet his friendship with Shmuel, his sister's transformation to a girl who liked to play with dolls to a loyal believer in Hitler and the Nazis but also seeing how his mother's conscience starts to eat her up and knowing what her husband is in charge of and that they are living near a death camp and seeing how the Jewish people are treated.

""THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMES"" is powerful and moving film but very tragic.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is presented in Widescreen (1:85:1), enhanced for 169 televisions.  Video quality on this DVD is pretty good as you do get a sense of color during the outdoor scenes and good lighting and set design as well.

Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound with the film being primarily a dialogue film that comes clear on your front channel speakers.  Music is used to show emotion of a scene and is utilized quite well.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are three special features included on the DVD for ""THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS"". Included are:

  * Deleted Scenes (With Optional Commentary by Writer/Director Mark Herman and Author John Boyne) - About five deleted scenes with commentary.  Most of the cuts were made early in the film.
  * Friendship Beyond the Fence Featurette - A featurette featuring  interviews with the director and the cast of the film.  Comments on how talented Asa Butterfield was as a young actor and playing Bruno.  Each talked about their character and working with each other, asking Asa Butterfield (Bruno) and Jack Scanlon (Shmuel) about their knowledge of the Holocaust and even having to remake one of the Nazi propaganda films of Jewish enjoying the concentration camps which was used in the film.
  * Feature Commentary by Writer/Director Mark Herman and Author John Boyne - Both discuss the film and talk about the talent, the characters and differences between the film and the book.  Certain shots and the emotions that the director wanted to capture on screen.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to admit that with a Holocaust film involving children, I wasn't sure where this story was going.  But by the film's end and the final wide shot, I was just amazed by the film and yet saddened by how tragic the film ended.

I was really moved by the film and the various performances. I was very amazed by Asa Butterfield's performance as Bruno and because he was naive and really didn't care about how the Nazi's felt about the Jews, he was able to have this friendship with Shmuel.  Jack Scanlon's Shmuel was also another performance that was well done and you had this sense of sadness in the child's eyes.

Vera Farmiga's performance as his mother was well-done and seeing how she started out as this strong woman, good mother and proud wife of a high ranking Nazi officer but then seeing her evolve when she discovers the atrocities and having to live nearby and having to bare with death near her home and having to lie to her children of what is happening.

But what was innocent for the most part of the film really shocks you at what happens at the end of the film.  I was shocked of how it ended and I'll just leave it at that.

Very good costume and set design and really good cinematography by Benoit Delhomme.  The screenplay was well-written, emotions well captured on film and each talent did a great job in portraying their character.

Everything was well done in this film.

A powerful and moving film, ""THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS"" is a film that deserves to watched.  It's not a film about the Holocaust with guns ablazing, it's a film that shows the cruelty of that time but focusing on an eight-year-old boy who knows not of what is going on around him, not knowing why the Nazi's hate the Jewish people but being optimistic that once the war is over, he and Shmuel can finally play together.  Naive to know that the ""farm"" where he thinks Shmuel and others are having fun in is actually a concentration camp where many people are being massacred. And it's the naivety of both children, not knowing how dangerous things are but knowing that their friendship is real that sets up the final part of the film.

""THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS"" is highly recommended!",1236470400,11,8263,4.567934782608695
3751624,4,B001PMR2KS,"This film probably didn't do as well at the box office because most moviegoers go for fun, not to get depressed. It's films like this that are best experienced at home. And it's a film that is an excellent jumping-off point for discussion with young (10 and above, though the two boys whom the film revolves around are only 9) children about the holocaust - which, all too often, seems to be losing its place in history.

I won't go into the detail of the plot as that is covered elsewhere on the Amazon site - and in other reviews. It is also important NOT to know how THIS story ends. (We all know how the holocaust ended.) It gives the film its impact.

In the standard ""Making of"" documentary (20 minutes) in the Special Features, we learn from both the Writer/Director, and the author of the book on which the film is based, that they want the film to be watched by families together and used as a discussion tool. The film is rated PG-13 ""for Thematic Material involving the Holocaust"". There is violence in the images of injured people (and the makeup is very graphic) but much is implied. We learn what is going on in the ""work camp"" by seeing fleeting images or hearing sounds.

At 94 minutes, the film is brief enough so that children will not get bored. It is NOT a film that, in my opinion, should be watched by children under 16 without a parent or other adult to answer questions they might have, or better yet, ask questions of the children to see that they understand.

Miramax made the production in partnership with BBC Films and nearly all the cast are British. (We learn in the documentary that that the woman playing the mother seems to be the sole American among the lead actors.) I did have a small problem at the beginning getting used to the British accents of all these characters who are supposed to be in Germany. (I guess I'm used to actors having German accents in films about the Holocaust.) But, after a while, I accepted it and moved on.

I have not listened to the director's commentary. And the deleted scenes included in the bonus features don't add much, but it's good they are included.

This is not a perfect film but well worth using as a teaching tool. The more that the younger generation knows about the Holocaust the better the chance that it will never be repeated.

3751625,5,B001PMR2KS,"I was blown away by this film.  I found it to be deeply moving, thought-provoking and even a little terrifying.

The film begins with the family of the commander of a concentration camp during WWII.  The mood is idyllic and innocent - until Bruno, the 8-year old in the family, notices a farm through his window.  Of course, we know this is no farm.  As viewers, we are taken on a journey with Bruno as he tries to grasp not only what this farm is and who is in it, but also the role his father plays.

Bored, with little to do, Bruno sneaks away from his home and comes across one of the barbed fences of the camp where he meets another 8-year old to play with - except that he is stuck on the other side of the fence.  As he becomes friends with this little boy, Bruno finds his own world become confusing.  Can his friend really be without human emotions?  How can he not be human?

Another aspect I found fascinating was the portrayal of Bruno's family.  At first, his mother just reluctantly accepts who her closest neighbors are.  Yet, as the film continues, her own eyes are opened to what is occurring just a mile away yet she is absolutely helpless to do anything about it.

At first, I actually thought that this could be a film that children could watch.  It is not.  While it is a fascinating movie, if you don't like sad films I would suggest avoiding this one.  It isn't graphic or explicit.  The violence is implied, urged on primarily by your own knowledge of the Holocaust.  However, this doesn't make the film any less frightening.  I utterly recommend this film, I found it to be well written, well acted and well filmed along with having an excellent soundtrack.  Watch!",1235692800,7,1690,4.407766990291262

But I think she didn't understand the relevance, the beauty, the heart-sink. I don't really think I can make her see it but then this film is for people like me and no, I'm not going to go into myself.

What is absolutely remarkable about THE BOY IN STRIPED PAJAMAS is how there's no parallel monalogue of sorts. There is no sense of a common opinion being preached to you. The film very subtly gets its point across, the dialogue is apt and witty, the accent is English, the sets are wonderful, the characters all seem to leave an impression and towards the end of the film when you finally realize why the film is titled so, you will learn to appreciate it.

On some message boards, I read some backlash towards this film but I think naysayers can say what they can yet you must not ignore the particular character, central character. By the time the credits roll, you'll be too stunned to move. I hope this gets its due by the time it's out.",1235433600,12,1085,4.3399014778325125

But, as it happened, my school went on a field trip to see the movie a few weeks after I finished the book, and I ended up having to watch the whole movie through and write a report comparing and contrasting it from the novel. And guess what?- I sobbed like a baby in front of all my friends.

3751630,2,B001PMR2KS,"Over the course of film history, both in the United States and abroad, numerous films have been made which relate, in some way, directly or indirectly, to some aspect of the Holocaust, among the darkest periods of any century and of human existence. They include those that have a popularity that transcend the subgenre and rise to become classics in a general sense: ""Exodus,"" ""Sophie's Choice,"" ""Schindler's List."" Many of them involve the young in some way but there's a body of work that focus chiefly on young victims who find themselves caught in some aspect of the genocide. This decade alone has seen more than a few such films, whether they are Jewish children who are forced to endure unspeakable barbarism (""Fateless"") or young-adult Germans with the courage to take a stand against the atrocities of their leaders (""Sophie Scholl: the Final Days"").

""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is the latest such movie to premiere. From the United Kingdom, it is directed by Mark Herman from a screenplay Herman wrote, basing it on a novel by John Boyne. The story, experienced mostly from the perspective of children, concerns a lonely eight-year-old boy, Bruno (Asa Butterfield) newly relocated to the German countryside from Berlin, who befriends another boy his same age, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon). They like each other, find they have much in common, and want to play with each other every day. But they're separated by a tall barbed wire fence that courses with electricity. After all, despite their similarities, there is one irreconcilable difference: Shmuel is a Jew and that fence hems him into the grim concentration camp to which he and his family have been sent. Bruno, meanwhile, maintains his freedom with a family headed by his father, a captain who moved them to the country when he was promoted. His new job: run the concentration camp. Visible on a distant horizon from Bruno's new room, the ""farm,"" as the child initially mistakes it for, is tended to by numerous ""farmers"" who wear the titular ""striped pajamas"" (really, uniforms with numbers); Shmuel is but one of hundreds of them.

A large part of the story, generally filmed by cinematographer Benoit Delhomme in muted tones, with especially drab grays for the camp and its workers, concerns Bruno's gradual discovery of the senseless hatred people can harbor against one another for no good reason. Unlike his older sister, Gretel (Amber Beattie), he is relatively slow to absorb the lessons of the tutor his father hired, lessons that purport to justify why his father's work is for the benefit of their country. Bruno, by his own admission an ""explorer,"" much prefers to read his fantasy and adventure books over the anti-Semitic tomb of a book his teacher assigns him to read. Another concern of the movie is the infuriating class differences inherent in such systems, as, for example, the monstrous treatment imposed on the Jewish Pavel (David Hayman), formerly a doctor, now a worker in the camp and servant in Bruno's well-to-do household.

But perhaps the most important concern of the story is naivet. Not simply childhood naivet but the childlike version in adults. It is this that is not only one of the most interesting aspects of the picture, but its most problematic. It manifests itself here in Bruno's initial perception of the ""farm"" and the workers in their striped PJs, which is one thing. More sadly, but less believably, it also is reflected in the fact that the depth of the systemic hatred and lack of humanity in Bruno's father (David Thewlis), not to mention the dark details of his new job, barely register at first with Bruno's mother (Vera Farmiga), an innocent, then concerned, then indignant woman with some shreds of humanity that she fails to act upon until she sees her children become too exposed to the cruel philosophies and actions of their father and his henchmen.

As the story progresses, the level of ignorance of the two boys at its center regarding the circumstances that envelop them becomes less and less plausible, especially considering that they each witness and experience some of the abuse of the soldiers first-hand. Late into the film, Bruno has seen some of the rougher side of his father, yet, when asked by Shmuel if he is proud of his father, Bruno responds in the affirmative with seemingly a minimum of hesitation. Further, Bruno seems to have little if any doubts about his family, even in the face of his sister's rapidly increasing phobia, militancy, and hatred. Most profoundly, despite the fact that Shmuel himself toils in the camp, he does not even come close to suspecting that the explanations he is given about his and his parents' predicament, why he was transported there, and why people in the compound keep mysteriously disappearing may be weak attempts to mask something that is wrong. It's nearly impossible to accept that, when he realizes his own father is missing, he starts searching the camp for him, oblivious to the notion, despite where he is, that he may have been murdered. It isn't until the final, waning minutes in the film, when the boys--Bruno especially, but to an extent even Shmuel--begin to better comprehend the wickedness of the camp. These may be kids, but I doubt real children in similar circumstances would be as clueless as the film assumes they would be, no matter at which side of the fence the sit.

The basic conceit of the film is certainly engaging and there are many scenes that are memorable for their drama, tension, and horror, but, in its realization, the filmmakers attribute so much permanence to childhood innocence that much of the story's credibility is undermined. They assume that such innocence can continue to survive, will not erode, even under circumstances as difficult and raw as these.",1233187200,33,5782,4.93223819301848
3751631,4,B001PMR2KS,"The movie's subject matter, first and foremost is very HEAVY.

The story follows a boy in a particular German military family.  He is your average adventurous and innocent/ nave eight-year-old boy.  His family is a very ordinary German family, for that time, except his father had just been promoted to a high position within the military, causing the family, much to the children's chagrin, to move out to the country (discovered in the first five minutes of the film).

In this movie, you will see a wide range of acceptance and emotion for the German political agenda.  You'll see the happenings of this family from the boy's perspective, including his introduction to the Jewish people.

In my opinion, this movie is very well made, intelligent, and powerful.  The messages that are being conveyed are wonderful conversation pieces.  It's time to expand horizons and stimulate the brain with this very strong film.

3751632,4,B001PMR2KS,"Let me start by saying that I will probably never again be trusted with choosing the family after-Christmas movie again.  I knew there would be sad tones and sad themes given that it was a Holocaust movie.  But I thought that since it was from a child's point of view it would be more palatable.  And for the most part it was, and probably because it was from a child's point of view.  But the ending was anything but palatable.  It was dark and terrible even by Holocaust movie standards.

The story of a young son of a concentration camp commandant who befriends a Jewish boy his age on the other side of the wire may sound a bit implausible to die-hard history buffs, but it definitely makes for a fascinating premise.  And so the viewer (or reader, as it was based on a novel) is very interested in seeing how it all plays out.

What surprised me most about THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS was the light-hearted and sometimes even downright humorous moments.  The great paradox is to find oneself chuckling during a light scene only to be suddenly jolted out of one's humor a mere second or two later and brought back to the reality of what the film is about.

The acting by all cast members is superb, but especially by the two principal boy actors portraying Bruno, the 8-year-old son of the Nazi commandant and Shmuel (pronounced SHMOLL), the Jewish boy who is prisoner in Bruno's father's concentration camp.  Their on-screen chemistry far surpasses that of most adult movie stars in the industry today.

The primary problem I have with STRIPED PAJAMAS is I have no idea who this film's target audience is meant to be.  Perhaps adults, but most adults would be able to handle a more realistic (by ""realistic"" I simply mean in terms of graphic content) portrayal of the Holocaust.  This film is certainly violent, but virtually all of the violence occurs off-screen and is implied.  (The filmmakers did an excellent job of shocking the audience more by what is not seen than what is seen.  Especially at the end.)  The target audience may also be children, but I would not let a child of mine watch this unless they were at least 11 or 12 years of age and were able to handle this kind of subject matter.

Overall, STRIPED PAJAMAS is one of the best films I saw in 2008.  I don't recall hearing any profanity, and surprisingly there was no gratuitous violence.  If a Holocaust movie could possibly be a family movie as well, then this was one.

3751633,5,B001PMR2KS,"I saw this in the theatre yesterday. It is very well made and the casting was excellent.

Having read the book I felt they left out some key elements that add to the story development. I guess that is always the case with book then movie. I have a very vivid imagination and the movie in my head had so many more details that left a lasting impression than the movie did.

I had pictured Bruno the Nazi officers son just about as he is but not so skinny. There is a reference in the book about him being bigger than the POW Jewish boy. actually it was the other way around in the movie.

It was made very excellent and the outcome of the story is the same. How it all happens is just a bit different. If possible I'd suggest see the movie first then read the book..that way it will add details and you will not be frustrated that key points are left out that really matter in the development of the Bruno character.

Bruno is so very innocent of what is going on in the camps. It does make you think that the childen of these Nazi officers are not to blame. Some where forced to be Hitler Youth but not the case for Bruno. He was a typical 8 year old boy who was just innocent and had been protected.

What really helps in the movie is to see the reactions of the Officers wife. Her expressions and reactions to learning what was really going on in the camps her husband was in charge of. She was so horrified.

So if you have the chance this story is a must either by film or book. If you do both again I suggest the movie then the book. It is very SAD and Tragic which ever one you choose.",1230508800,,1591,4.067092651757188
