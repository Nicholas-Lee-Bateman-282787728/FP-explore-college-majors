This is one of the volumes in the History Channel's series ""The Great Ships.""  It covers the development and use of the frigate in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  The most interesting parts are the exploits of the Americans against the British (the USS Constitution) and Stephan Decatur's cutting out expedition against the Barbary Pirates.  New to me was the problem of `hogging' and how an American shipwright, Joshua Humphries, solved it (you'll have to watch the video to find out what hogging is and what Humphries did about about.) The stories are told mainly with pictures, but there are some reenactors.  However, they really don't add much to the video.  I learned a lot and enjoyed the video.  I recommend it.",1130976000,,738,4.856
