Sante and Kenny Kimes were two of the most notorius mother and son grifters (so they've been called) since Ma Barker and her boys.  They've stolen from many, hurt even more, maimed several and murdered at least one person during their reign of crime.  Sante even went to jail for involuntary servitude for imprisoning Latin-speaking workers within her very home; tragic.  This is a story that will leave your mouth open from the absolute nerve and audacity of these two career criminals.  Several movies have been made on the subject w/both the likes of Mary Tyler Moore and Judy Davis playing the congenial yet corrupt Sante Kimes w/seemingly no remorse.  It's a story that's dying to be heard.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-a-Grifter-The-Twisted-Tale-of-Sante-and-Kenny-Kimes-the-Most-Notorious-Con-Artists-in-America/dp/0061031690/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of a Grifter: The Twisted Tale of Sante and Kenny Kimes, the Most Notorious Con Artists in America</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mother-The-Son-And-The-Socialite-The-True-Story-Of-A-Mother-Son-Crime-Spree-St-Martin-s-True-Crime-Library/dp/0312970692/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mother, The Son, And The Socialite: The True Story Of A Mother-Son Crime Spree (St. Martin's True Crime Library)</a>",1264550400,,1543,7.094736842105263
