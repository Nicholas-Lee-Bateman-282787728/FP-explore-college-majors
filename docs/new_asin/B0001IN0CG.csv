2004819,5,B0001IN0CG,"Jane Olivor has finally done it!  Releasing a concert dvd.  This has to be a stroke of genius on her part.  Olivor's live shows are a true event!  I've seen Ms. Olivor at least 20 times from 1979 to 2003.  Each show is unique, and better than the last.  When she disappeared in 1983, she left behind a legion of bewildered and saddened fans, myself included.  Over the years I've managed to acquire several bootleg video concerts of the vintage Ms. Olivor.  I've played them so much, they're almost worn out. But now, us fans have a permanent record of  ""the voice"" that will last forever.
I managed to receive an advance copy of this dvd.  Well, it has never left my dvd player.  I remember choosing the on-camera interview first.  Jane tells of her humble beginnings, her family's influence, how she started singing, and what made her leave the music scene so abruptly.  The interview is frank and insightful.  I found it very informative.  For most of us fans, we know how rare it is for Jane to talk about herself.  So, this portion of the dvd is a real treat.  She is articulate, at ease, and very funny, as she shares anecdotes about her career.
So, after the interview, I'm ready to see the concert portion.  I'm really psyched for Jane, she's come so far since her comeback.  The concert starts with ""You"" from the Chasing Rainbows cd. She comes out with a big smile, and looks fantastic.  Jane still has the same effect on me she had in 1979. The little hairs on the back of my neck stand when I hear her sing.  She then eases into ""Warm""  ""Let's Make Some Memories"" which now has an updated spin ""Let's Make New Memories,""  a clever lyric change, which now seems fitting.  Jane then moves into ""Annie's Song""  She makes you forget that John Denver wrote it, and she steals it right away from him.  Jane then goes into banter about her and Johnny Mathis, and then sings ""The Last Time I Felt Like This"" from the film ""Same Time, Next Year"".
Jane Olivor has included most of her signature songs, and a few new ones, which are destined to become classics in her catalog.  For instance, she does a version of  ""How are Things in Glocca Mora"" from Finian's Rainbow, and cleverly incorporates the song from the film Rob Roy, ""Ailein Duinn"" with it. WOW!! what a great combination! it will give you goosebumps.  The song ""Safe Return"" is another new one, with a beautiful melody and touching lyrics, Jane's trademark!!  ""I Believe"" is another classic suited to her unique vocal style.
The official release of this dvd is April 27th. I highly recommend it!!  It's a definite keeper.  With her voice sounding better than ever, I'm confident that this dvd will give Jane Olivor the acclaim that has unfairly eluded her.",1081900800,27,2719,4.542268041237113
2004850,5,B0001IN0CG,"JANE IS AN ORIGINAL AND HER EMBODIMENT OF WORK IS A HALLMARK, WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY EASY TO DEFINE, THOUGH I WILL ATTEMPT IT.  SHE COULD BE DESCRIBED AS EARTHY, PASIONATE, ELECTRIC, SPONTANEOUS AND HER ARTISTIC RENAISSANCE AND CREATIVITY ARE A FORM OF PURITY THAT CERTAINLY IS BEYOND REPROACH.

THE NAME ""JANE OLIVER"" SAYS IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!",1289520000,,342,5.089285714285714
2004851,4,B0001IN0CG,"What can I say?  I just wish I had discovered her earlier in her life and career.  Her voice is spectacular and the emotions she puts into her songs cannot be equaled, even from Streisand.  Jane Olivor is the greatest singer I have ever heard.  I particularly love how she interacts with her audience in Carousel of Love, her sadness and longing in Pretty Girl, and her deep feeling in Daydream.  My only regret is that I have not had the chance to see and hear her sing live.",1246233600,3,476,4.303370786516854
2004852,5,B0001IN0CG,"To watch Jane is to see how easy she can make singing look (the sign of a real pro!).  I find her captivating and love the selection of songs she chose for this delightful DVD.  To hear her is to be captivated by sound, in a crowd or when no one's around.",1203033600,,255,3.8846153846153846
2004853,4,B0001IN0CG,"It's amazing that all the songs she sang sounded exactly like the originals she made 30 years ago...her voice is still incredibly clear and light and powerful at times.

When playing the DVD, lower the volume of the rear speakers...the piano accompaniment is too loud and annoying.

One last big disappointment...she had a nose job and lost her unique look...imagine Barbra with a pert turned up nose!!

This DVD is definitely a keeper!",1200700800,,436,4.945205479452055

I have only discovered Jane just recently thanks to YouTube but I had heard the voice first thrity years ago. Great phrasing and interpretation of lyrics. The voice has lost some of its power but she makes up for it in other ways. It makes you wish you were there. My favourites on this DVD, apart from the obvious hits, were ""Daydreams"" and ""L'Important C'est la Rose"".
As others have said, my only criticism is the audience and the way they were dressed. To do a good live DVD you need to get in amongst the audience with the camera to get their reaction. Andre Rieu DVDs are good at this. However, the ones at the front let Jane down. The most enthusiastic ones were towards the back of the auditorium and may be up in the circle. So get a camera up there looking back at the stage. Find a close up of some faces with tears on them - and I could see a few. If I was there I would have been one of them for sure.",1200182400,,1079,4.74468085106383
2004855,5,B0001IN0CG,"I was about just a teenager when ""first night"" came out. I am not even sure WHY I bought it..I think because she sang ""better days"" and I loved Melissa Manchester. In any event, I brought home ""First Night"" and fell in love with Jane Olivor's voice and style. Jane brings to her fans ""crowded Island"" for the time as well as ""Safe Return"", a beautiful cover of ""Brooklyn Roads"" as well as ""Sipping wine"" a song she often performed in the 70's but never shared with us on record. For any fan of Jane Olivor's Music, they will totally love this dvd.",1127088000,9,547,4.320388349514563
2004856,4,B0001IN0CG,"I have heard of Jane Olivor for years, but she is one of those ""70s Vocalists"" that I never checked out before. Frankly, I thought she was a folk singer and that genre is not my favorite.

Well, a friend lent me this DVD and I must admit I am still thinking about it, even several days later.

First of all, I'm a sucker for ""come backs"".  I sincerely recommend playing the interview (included in the DVD's ""bonus"" material) before watching the concert. Hearing about Olivor's personal story and why she left the stage for so long before seeing her perform may help ""color"" the concert for you.

Also, Olivor's persona as an interview subject is very different than her on-stage persona.  In the interview, she is warm, funny, bright-eyed and a little ethnic! On stage, she seems very serious. Interesting dichotomy.

For the first time hearing/seeing Olivor perform, I was very pleased. She has a great voice, with a solid middle-range.  Some of her falsettos and higher notes are beautiful.  She has bright, shiny eyes when she performs.

I must admit that I am not a fan of the majority of her song selections. I do not know who writes the songs she sings (does she use a variety of songwriters in her repertoire?), but most of the ones I've never heard didn't appeal to me.  For the most part  those songs had treacley lyrics that really turned me off. Also, after one song she said, ""Rock and Roll!"" --- um, it didn't sound a thing like rock and roll to me.

However, I was stunned by her rendition/arrangement of ""Some Enchanted Evening.""  Simply amazing.  Like hearing the song for the first time. I also enjoyed her medley of ""How Are Things in Glocca Mora"" and the Celtic song. Also, ""I Got the Sun in the Morning"".

Olivor has a way of making standards sound entirely different. I like that.",1120176000,11,1801,4.566978193146418
2004857,5,B0001IN0CG,"Of course, this DVD is essential for anyone who is a Jane Olivor fan. More importantly, it belongs in the library of someone who is not yet a fan. Once they see her, they will be totally entranced by her range of material, her interpretations and her delivery. She is without a doubt, one of the most beautiful and gifted singers of our time.

The musicians who accompany her are also talented. They listen to one another and work together flawlessly.

If this DVD were a piece of clothing in my closet, it would be a tattered, worn-out mess. I have had this disc only a few days, but have played it over and over. Each time I see it, something new appears, a vocal takes on new meaning, or another delicious nuance of her performance comes through.

Jane looks comfortable and confident, and she seems to be thoroughly enjoying herself. This is wonderful. I sincerely hope she has overcome her stage fright. It sure looks as if she has, for her performance on this disc is positively breathtaking.

There is only one thing that bothers me, and it has nothing to do with the production, the performance or the venue. I would not have been able to pinpoint it without the help of one of the other online reviewers. When Jane goes into the audience on Carousel of Love, you will see it. Don't Bostonians know how to dress? One would think these people were going bowling instead of to a fabulous concert. Their insensitive attire of blue jeans, sneakers and farm suspenders is an embarrassment to Boston society.",1104278400,7,1510,4.5814814814814815
2004858,5,B0001IN0CG,"As a loving fan of this truly gifted artist, I was amazed and enthralled upon seeing this fantastic DVD.  She's Back, she's Fantastic, she's older and filled with Confidence, Wisdom and Elegance. She is also Beautiful!!!! Every track is an absolute treasure.  My  favorites are ""Stay the Night, Daydreams, Brooklyn Roads, Run For The Roses, Annie's Song, L'Important C'est la Rose""--- in actuality
every single track is flawless, beautiful Jane Olivor in all her brillance.  I cannot imagine anyone finding fault with this amazing  concert.  One of the great aspects of Jane Olivor is that she is, mysteriously, not well known by all. Those of us who have loved her for so, so many years have yet another wonderful veichle to appreciate her emense talent and legendary career.",1101600000,14,776,5.0234375
2004859,5,B0001IN0CG,"I was a little apprehensive about this dvd, having not heard much of Jane Olivor's music before.  But I'm soooo glad I bought it, because it is truly wonderful.  Another reviewer called it magical, and that is the perfect word for it.  She has so much passion in her music, and is so endearing to watch, I'm hooked forever, and I think you will be, too.",1101081600,10,353,4.318181818181818
2004870,5,B0001IN0CG,"I've purchased several copies of this DVD for holiday gifts because I'm convinced that anyone who experiences Jane Olivor's voice will claim to be her number one fan.  Never has a singer so beautifully wrapped a voice around every single word of a song.  Streisand and Midler should only sing backup for this extraordinary artist.  The song ""Safe Return"" alone is worth more than the price of the DVD or CD.",1100131200,13,407,4.704225352112676
2004871,5,B0001IN0CG,"I attended this fabulous performance and felt so moved by Jane's heartfelt sharing of love and warmth- that is what she and her music are all about. From the early 70's to now, Jane has only become more beautiful, more moving and such an uplifting spirit in this troubled world. She is the woman we all would love to be and the friend we would all die for. This DVD captures the magic of that evening beautifully. I play it on my computer and it is an incredibly great sound. I have been a fan of her's since the beginning and her recent performance is better than the perfection of the past. BUY IT- YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!1",1086134400,3,628,4.3760683760683765
2004872,5,B0001IN0CG,"First off, I have to agree with one of the other reviews that
criticizes the sound mix.  I don't have a multi-speaker setup,
or DTS capability, just a great sounding SONY TV.  Watching the
DVD on just the TV, the sound is strange.  The keyboards are up
way too high in the mix, sometimes almost drowning Jane out in
the uptempo songs if you use the 5.1 mix.  If you switch to
""Dolby Stereo"", it's much better and clearer.  But on the song
""You Don't Know How Beautiful You Are"", her voice is completely
obscured by her keyboard player's vocals on the chorus. This is
the first DVD I've had this problem on.
HOWEVER, and this is a BIG however, if you are a fan, this DVD
is absolutely essential.  On most of the songs, where the voice
is front and center, Jane is absolutely spellbinding.  I was a
big fan back in her early years, but kind of lost interest due
to some of the shall we say ""corny"" choice of material.  To tell
you the truth, I hadn't really paid a lot of attention after her
third album until the last year or so.  I must say that Jane's
singing is warmer and more amazing than ever.  You can tell that
her range is slightly lower, but that's natural with the passing
of time.  It is more than made up for by her still-gorgeous tone,
her wise phrasing and her surprisingly welcoming stage presence.
I saw her Carnegie Hall debut in 1977 (78?) and she kind of left
me cold.  The Jane Olivor on this DVD is full of warmth and good
humor, and you can tell she is loving every minute of the show.
My favorite performances are ""Pretty Girl"", ""Some Enchanted
Evening"", ""How Are Things In Glocca Morra"", ""Stay The Night""
and a (for her) jazzy version of ""I Got The Sun In The Morning"".
It's a wonderful show, and her voice sounds as beautiful and
delicate at the end of the show as it did at the beginning.
Welcome Back, Jane!
One quibble:  Don't people get dressed up to go ANYWHERE these
days?  Jane is dressed to the nines in a very flattering outfit,
and half the audience is in T-shirts and sneakers!  Whatever.....",1085616000,8,2028,4.313984168865435
2004873,5,B0001IN0CG,"I'VE BEEN A FAN OF JANE SINCE THE 70'S. I MUST HAVE PLAYER HER ORIGINAL 5 CD'S A MILLION TIMES AND SAW HER IN CONCERT MANY TINES AND NEVER GOT TIRED OF LISTENING TO THIS MAGICAL VOICE. I WAS THRILLED WHEN AFTER SO MANY YEARS LOVE DECIDES WAS RELEASED AND NOW I CAN SEE HER IN CONCERT ON A DVD, AND WHAT A CONCERT. SHE IS BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE. HER VOICE IS PURE AND BEAUTIFUL. WHEN SHE SINGS, SHE CREAPS INTO YOUR SOUL. I WAS HAPPY THAT SHE SANG A LOT OF NEW SONGS, AND OF COURSE HER STANDARDS. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THERE WASN'T A BAND PLAYING INSTEAD OF JUST THE KEYBOARDS AND THE BASS. HER BALLADS WERE WONDERFUL, BUT THE UPTEMPO SONGS DIDN'T WORK WELL. SONGS LIKE LET'S MAKE THE MEMORIES AND THE BIG PARADE NEEDED A BAND. WHEN SHE SINGS PRETTY GIRL OR SOME ENCHANTED EVENING, YOU MELT.
SO, IF YOU NEVER HEARD JANE OLIVOR SING OR  NEVER SAW HER IN CONCERT, NOWS YOUR BIG CHANCE. GET OUT THERE AND BUY THIS WONDERFUL DVD AND OR THE CD AND YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.",1084838400,9,972,4.170212765957447
2004874,5,B0001IN0CG,"If you are not yet a fan of Jane Olivor,  borrow this DVD or the CD from someone who owns it.....and you will be.  I have been a fan since the 70s and although Jane Olivor dosen't crank out a new cd every 5 weeks,  what she does crank out is memorable works of art that dare you not to feel.  Bravo Jane!  Welcome back.  You have been missed.",1084233600,4,342,3.8840579710144927
2004875,5,B0001IN0CG,"That's what will happen if you watch and/or listen to this DVD. Jane Olivor has the most pure voice I have ever heard. But that's just the instrument. What separates Jane Olivor from all the rest is her ability to reach deep into her soul and share her raw emotion through her music--both the lyrics and the music.
If you do not experience an emotional awakening from this DVD, then you should see a counselor! Open your heart, be honest, and expose your own soul to the universe!
The fact that I have not even mentioned any individual songs or her performances in them should show you that Jane Olivor's performance transcends the music. The music is the canvas, and Jane Olivor's soul is the message.
I'd give it 10 stars if I could. 5 will suffice.",1084233600,4,751,4.489051094890511
2004876,5,B0001IN0CG,"Jane Olivor has changed.  And that change reveals a mature, confident, totally in touch with her being performer and STAR, that we have missed for way to long.  With this DVD, she reclaims our hearts with her incomparable vocal magic.  And her personality is FABULOUS.  Jane, along with Diana Ross and Barbara Streisand, have been my greatest musical influences, and seeing Miss Olivor here in this wonderful performance is enough to make me want to get on stage and perform again.  This outing is perfection, and her touching, heartfelt rendition of ""Stay The Night"" receives the standing ovation that she so well deserves.  This performance truly showcases a very special night, and I am thankful that the cameras were rolling.  Jane has made a ""Safe Return"".  Please never go away again!",1083542400,3,790,4.977099236641221
2004877,5,B0001IN0CG,"All other reviews I read are right on, so I'll merely say that I have been a Jane Olivor fan for many years, have all her albums, and have seen her in concert many times (usually with good seats).  This DVD is superb, better than being in the front row of her concerts.  It's a ""must have"" for Jane Olivor fans.  It will also make anyone else viewing it an instant fan.  Buy the CD if you want, but don't skip the DVD.",1083369600,3,418,4.0
2004878,5,B0001IN0CG,"I remember listening to Jane's ""First Night"" album for the first time, years ago when I was a teenager. The New York Times had given it a SPECTACULAR review, and I rushed out to buy it. Once home, out of my speakers came a glimmering, totally unique voice, issuing from a singer whose acting and interpretive talents were beyond comparison. Surely as great as Streisand, but really nothing like her, except for their exquisite attention to melody. Jane's song choices were often obscure, but arrestingly dramatic gems. Everyone who heard her playing in my house stopped dead in their tracks and asked ""Who IS THAT???"". I stimulated so many new fans to purchase her recordings, I could have been her press agent! Jane's four follow-up albums were all just as magnificent as ""First Night"" and all just as unique, each in their own right. Her music formed a backdrop for my life, highs and lows, for many years.
Then, for anyone who's unfamiliar with the story, Jane suddenly and mysteriously disappeared. She says it was for ten years, but it sure seemed longer, more like a century! There were more bizarre rumors about the reasons for her sudden absence from the music scene than there were conspiricy theories about the death of JFK and Area 51!! Not knowing what had really happened to her left a gigantic hole in my heart. Corny, but true. When a new CD, ""Love Decides"", suddenly appeared in 2000, I almost wept with relief, and from the flood of memories that her voice, still a treasure, released in me.
Whew! Now for ""Safe Return"" and the accompanying CD of her live performance at Berklee College of Music. To tell the truth, I did not expect that she could be, after all these years, as good as she had been, and she isn't. She is better, light years better, and that is not an exaggeration. Most notably, Ms. Olivor seems to be totally at ease and full of joy in front of her audience (I remember shaking hands with Jane during a sweltering outdoor performance in July years ago when her hand was ICE-cold from nerves). A lot of her new material is quite playful, and her audience patter is charming and fascinating. Most importantly, although she humbly excuses the loss of a few high notes in the DVD interview, those notes are DEFINITELY still there, floating and gorgeous as ever. And it's a L-O-N-G set of songs that would exhaust anybody else, but Jane navigates through to the very last song as buoyantly as if it were the first. Remarkable.
As good as the CD is, the DVD IS awesome: amazing sound quality in 5.1 or dts options; a revealing, funny, bittersweet interview with Jane; and she looks mah-velous. I will say that Jane appears to have a different nose than she did years ago, and I much prefer the regal, original one that God gave her. Whatever she may have had altered, I'd like to think was a physical neccessity as opposed to a question of appearance, but either way, the change has not affected her vocal quality at all.
If you've never heard or heard of Jane Olivor before, and you're thinking of delving into an extraordinary new musical experience, you'll love ""Safe Return"", or any of Jane's recordings. I give you my 100% guarantee.
And Janie, if you're reading this, a million thank-you's for all the respect and utter pleasure you've given your fans over the years. You have been as loyal to us as we've been to you, and a million years would not be too long to wait to see and hear you again.",1083196800,6,3431,4.58957654723127
2004879,5,B0001IN0CG,"Fulfilling what was merely hinted at in her earlier 1982 IN CONCERT recording (also at Boston's Berklee -- who knew it was such a tiny, little hall?), Jane Olivor's concert recording SAFE RETURN is simply masterful, never less than wonderful and many times outright genius.
Olivor's emotive, heartfelt style here is never manufactured, but, gratefully, genuine throughout.  And your heart will never remain unchanged after seeing this DVD and, in particular, those tracks of absolute genius:  a transcendent ""Brooklyn Roads"", an impassioned ""Run For The Roses"" (the earlier recording pales by comparison), a heavenly ""Some Enchanted Evening"", a heartrending ""Pretty Girl"", a kickass ""One More Ride on the Merry Go Round"", and, above all, the achingly gorgeous ""Daydreams"" by the incomparable Georges Delerue and Jason Darrow.  And, by gum, that Eartha Kitt bite we heard from Olivor way back on FIRST NIGHT is back.  If someone would write a musical (about sisters, perhaps?) for Olivor and Betty Buckley to star in together, that would indeed be a sight and sound to behold.
Production values are stellar, and the DVD 5.1/dts sound is gorgeous.
Okay, a very minor couple of caveats.  Olivor skillfully but far too often refers to her Linus blanket (i.e., the teleprompter), but hey, with one night only riding on your back and bank account and with some 27 plus songs (especially when there've been concerts when scarcely 12 songs could be eked out of her in a night) and the famous stage fright issues, well, let the teleprompter roll.  And for a city (Boston) whose citizens pride themselves on their sense of style and fashion, where did this audience come from?  Does anyone know how to dress for an event anymore?  Or put down their forks?  Generally speaking, aside from Eric Conway (the pianist) and one shaved head guy, where are all of the hotties?  Is Olivor's audience really this old?  In that case, someone should drag in an audience of under 40s to learn about Olivor, who here takes her place forever in the pantheon of Piaf, Garland, and Midler.

song is uplifting and positive. No other artist will ever sing""Some Enchanted Evening"" more elegantly and gracefully as Jane does. Hate to
think along ""favorite song(s)""  with her ballads but this ranks as one of my favorites. To feel her emotion expelled from her voice makes you
want to cry. This concert video just adds to a collection that never grows old. Only wish Jane made more concert video's. So when life is
