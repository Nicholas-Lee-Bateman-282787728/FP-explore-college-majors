6281606,4,B00IMHSXDE,"Very well done story of Joan of Arc.  Due to some of the language and graphic violence I would not recommend for children.  But all in all, was very realistic as to what I believe could have been what really happened.  I would recommend to any adults interested in historical type films.",1418428800,,287,4.480769230769231
8643339,1,B00IMHSXDE,"The late Hank Reinhardt, co-founder of Atlanta Cutlery and medieval sword enthusiast,  wrote he walked out of this movie because it was so utterly bad in departing from the verifiable historical facts of its primary subject--and then Hank heard  after he left, hecklers kept shouting out ""BURN THE WITCH!"" at the screen--apparently other viewers knew they were held in contempt by the screenwriters, directors, etc..., even though these hecklers might have had some problems naming the specifics of what annoyed them.

Fiction, whether written or dramatic based upon  or around historical events and people is always a touchy subject. For example, most people in Japan really disliked _Shogun_. because in their minds it  willfully ignored actual Japanese history. Often with period drama you have to adopt a ""this is its own thing"" mentality, like I did with the classic John Ford movie _My Darling Clementine_, where Henry Fonda played Wyatt Earp and the events of the ""Gunfight at the O-K Corral""--I ended up saying to myself, ""this is  good story but in another universe with utterly different people, events and places sharing the same names as what happened in Tombstone of our universe""

I saw THIS movie, of all places, at Christ the Kings (Mesa, AZ) parish movie night (circa 2004) and when asked about the historical details by one of the viewers, Fr. Christopher Carpenter said something to the effect of ""well this is fiction, but really so little is known about Joan that we can't fault the movie makers for getting some details wrong--and really, what do we know what happened to Joan in her last days and what struggles of conscience she experienced?""

Father Chris happened to be the guy who welcomed me back to the Catholic Church via the Sacrament of Reconciliation February 2002--but my jaw dropped when he said that. So,  I was NOT surprised a few years later when I heard Fr. Chris talking on NPR to Terry Gross about his departure from the Church to join the ""Reformed Catholic Church"", an ultra-liberal schismatic sect (were the Episcopalians not liberal enough???) because Phoenix's new bishop, Thomas Olmstead, had the audacity to demand his priests actually support  and promote Catholic teaching in faith and morals.

Sorry for digressing but _The Messenger_ so consistently departs from the detailed historical record of St. Joan of Arc, the Maid of Orleans, so blatantly portrays her as a barely contained lunatic with a major revenge jones against the English one cannot escape the conclusion that the filmmakers  knew the facts and departed from them every possible chance they could. From beginning to end, this movie wants to portray Joan as unlikable, even hateful, a symbol for extreme fanaticism saying in effect, ""this is Western Christianity's jihadist"". (yes I know this movie predates 9/11/01). Essentially _The Messenger's_ premise is the old Enlightenment canard of the Middle Ages being part of the Dark Ages of Faith, everyone was credulous if God was involved, so some loony girl claims she hears voices and everyone falls into line for slaughter and atrocity, etc..., etc..., yada, yada, yada...

Just one of SO MANY lying departures from history expressed in this film: Joan's village NEVER experienced an attack by marauding English--so Joan's sister was never killed and then raped right in front of Joan so NO revenge motive. Capice, everybody????

Never mind Jovovich was way too old for the role, so was Ingrid Bergman and she did a fantastic job even with a stilted script. I'm not going to risk boring you with all the details how this movie seems like a Soviet-era black propaganda piece; I merely refer you to a 19th century ""freethinker"", cultural anti-Catholic who reflexively despised the French and ending up writing THE best fictional treatment of Joan yet composed--would you be surprised that I'm talking about Samuel ""Mark Twain"" Clemens?

Twain spent the better part of two decades researching Joan of Arc--the French national archives had been opened on her for the revived case of her canonization and Twain spent considerable scratch getting them translated into English. Joan had experienced THREE major investigations into her life and actions,not the least being three months of blatant judicial farce under the collaborationist Bishop Pierre Cauchon who held the Maid in captivity and oversaw her execution. In all cases, any suspicions that Joan was insane were quickly dispelled. In the Middle Ages they actually knew what mental illness was, even without Freud and CT scans, but unlike the snake-pit asylums of the Enlightenment to 20th centuries, the Medievals were almost  always kind, generous, and gentle with the mentally ill or challenged. They took care of them, they did NOT place them in charge of Royal armies. While utterly determined in her mission, the Maid was always lucid, always aware of the consequences of her actions and orders.

Even quite secular biographies of Joan will shoot down the awful slanders of _The Messenger_.

Still, the movie has one hilarious howler, the gravity propelled ""cannon ball"" coming out of that spiral chute--me thinks the director was playing to many video games when coming up with that concept (like, why not do what castle defenders have always done, DROP ROCKS!""",1512950400,2,5290,5.1030092592592595

8643341,5,B00IMHSXDE,"I am a big history fan, so watching this film was a great thrill. Milla Jovovich  does a wonderful job portraying the maiden of France who saves her country from the English invaders.",1485388800,,183,4.545454545454546
8643342,4,B00IMHSXDE,"I liked how this story (THE MESSENGER) unspokenly linked the Israel tribe of the evil Benjamites (Judges chp. 19-21) to the Burgundians, who rape/murdered the Lord of Glory i.e. the unnamed Levite's concubine-Melchizedek, who seemly demanded a 10% tithe of Judah warriors 40,000 of 400,000 fighting men, as some kind of heavenly: sanctuary tax?, ransom?, or tithe? - during this apparent ""Changing of the Guard"" from Levite priests to Judah priests - to serve in the heavenly sanctuary of Melchizedek.  I know I was as clear as mud, sorry.

Both the Benjamites and Burgundians were evidently Sons of Belial, and they may even be one in the same?  Or at least both controlled by one in the same evil spirit (Belial).  Even Eli's 2 sons were Sons of Belial, and they paid with their lives.  Joan's sister was rape/murdered in this story just as the unnamed Levite's concubine was rape/murdered.

The Benjamites were the wolf tribe. The Burgundians were called wolves too.  In this story, we see a pack of black wolves lead the charge by the Burgundians into Joan's home village of Domremy, France (region of Lorraine) - which the Burgundians burned.  It appears to me that Israel (in some respects) moved WEST/NW to France with Mary Magdalene when Mary arrived there (providentially) in a rudderless boat (set adrift) to live out her life some years after the Resurrection of Christ.

Joan of Arc, I believe, was the return of Mary Magdalene, just as John the Baptist was EliJAH returned. That is how I see it.  Both Mary and Joan saved France.  Mary with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and Joan with the Sword of the Lord and by her own martyrdom. [John was martyred too].  Mary provided a sign to the King and Queen of France in her day by interceding for them to have a male child heir (dolphin/dauphin) to the throne - which they had. We don't exactly know what the sign Joan showed to King Charles VII?  My feeling is that she showed him her small bright red birth mark behind her right ear which she had in common with her father Jacques d'Arc and which also Charles VII(7th) had too.  Joan, I think, showed Charles that his ""true father"" was the same father as Joan herself.  There was no DNA (Dauphin Nucleic Acid) tests in Joan's day.  Royal birthmarks may have played a part in proving royal bloodline?  Jacques and Joan supposedly descended from the kings of Jerusalem and were hereditary Knights Templar nobility.  Thus Charles VII was too. Charles quickly ennobled the entire Jacques d'Arc family and their descendants as soon as he was crowned King of France.

CONS:
We could have done without the graphic sexual violence in this film where Joan's sister is rape/murdered (or more accurately, murdered/raped).  I liked this film exceedingly nonetheless, and watch it often.
PROS:
How else could Luc Besson (Director/Writer) have shown the link between Benjamites and Burgundians other than by the graphic sexual rape/murder violence, and with the addition of the fictitious character, Joan's sister Catherine?  Probably no other good way.

Joan is played by an actress well fitting to the part.",1485302400,,3103,4.848197343453511
