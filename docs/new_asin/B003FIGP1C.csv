4118548,5,B003FIGP1C,"What a treasure! Stan Rogers died at 33 in 1983, before videos became common. So many of his brilliant songs will be enjoyed now only on audio. There was supposed to be so much time. Then the airplane on which he was returning from the Kerrville Folk Festival went on fire.

If you don't know this quintessential Canadian singer/songwriter, you are in for a treat which will send you scrambling for CDs. He sings of the sea (and so much more). If you like pirate (well, privateer) sea shanty harmonies, you'll find one here. His song, ""Northwest Passage,"" was voted the alternative Canadian National Anthem by.listeners who responded to a radio contest.

This DVD features family reminiscences and evocative scenery. But best of all, it has a well-filmed performance of ""The Mary Ellen Carter,"" A song which, as you will see, saved at least one life. It's about a grieving crew's decision to raise and claim salvage on a ship the owners wrote off for the insurance.

And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow,
With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go,
Turn to and put out all you have of heart and mind and brain,
And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!

Rise again! Rise again!
Though your heart it be broken and life about to end;
No matter what you've lost -- be it a home, a love, a friend --
Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!",1409097600,11,1362,4.546938775510204
4118549,5,B003FIGP1C,"The DVD is available for 20 bucks from the Canadian company that made the documentary. I'm not permitted to provide a link, but do a search for it with the title of the documentary and you'll find it easily online.

Stan Rogers was a brilliant songwriter. I originally learned about him after hearing the incredible song, The Mary Ellen Carter. It's the story about a ship that went down and was resurrected. But it's not just a tale about a ship. It's about the ability of the human spirit to rise from ashes. Just as Stan Rogers did, through his songs that have been enjoyed by many after his passing.",1372982400,5,603,4.4818181818181815
4118550,2,B003FIGP1C,"$100 for a 45-minute VHS? Or, if money is really burning a hole in your pocket, you can pay $475 for an ""acceptable"" copy... Well, friends, Stan Rogers was - and remains - a fantastic singer/songwriter. He was also a pragmatist. Most of the performances on this Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) production can be seen for free on YouTube. You could buy CDs of all of Stan's recordings and still have some money leftover to put where it'll do some good.",1357171200,4,459,4.679012345679013
