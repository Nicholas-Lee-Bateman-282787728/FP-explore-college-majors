8070397,4,B0009YAKK2,"The Boy Nobody Wanted with Johnny Crawford and The Major of St. Lo with Peter Graves are two excellent little teleplays.  Both films are from the 1956 season of the Cavalcade of America program.  The picture quality is quite good and the films move along at a good pace.  As far as the plays are concerned, they are complete.  However, the only problem is that the Cavalcade of America openings are missing and the end credits fade out a couple of seconds too soon.  Otherwise, I would love to see more of these teleplays.",1247961600,5,522,4.51063829787234
