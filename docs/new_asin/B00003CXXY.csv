1309450,5,B00003CXXY,"Listen all the guys of Amazon.com!!! Yes, this movie is one of the best and most inspiring I've seen in awhile. Although, I do tend to think anything Italian is the BEST! BUT once Monica Bellucci walks across your screen as Malena for the first time, you will not be able to look at anything else. She looks like heaven!!! If heaven looks anything like her, I sure hope I'm going there! And this considering she barely speaks in the film. When you look at her walking through this town, you know exactly what this obsessed with her boy is going through. If for no other reason, watch this one to see my imaginary wife MONICA BELLUCCI as ""Malena""  !!!",995760000,2,650,4.416666666666667

Obviously this ain't Amazon's fault but the silly censorship that think can control what other people see.

1309452,4,B00003CXXY,"Another brilliant film by Tornatore. Its characters, set again in a small town in Sicily bring in the similar tone it did from his previous masterpiece Cinema Paradiso. With the beautiful cinematography, beautiful musical score, and the beautiful Bellucci lighting up the screen, what more can we ask from one of the best Italian directors today?",994550400,,346,5.196428571428571
1309453,4,B00003CXXY,"""Malena,"" written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, is a visually beautiful story set in Sicily during World War II. The film tells the story of Renato Amoroso, a young adolescent boy whose heart and hormones are both racing out of control. The object of his attention is Malena (well played by Monica Bellucci), a stunningly beautiful young woman whose husband is off fighting in the war.
Giuseppe Sulfaro is very touching in the role of young Renato; his soulful eyes communicate more than pages full of dialogue ever could. The film has some uproarious comic interludes as Renato's father tries to deal with his horny son. Also amusing are the parodies of genre films that take place in Renato's imagination. The film is beautifully enhanced by the exquisite, Oscar-nominated cinematography by Lajos Koltai. And the sweet, melancholy score by the legendary Ennio Morricone (another Oscar nomination) helps tie the film together.
Overall, ""Malena"" is a well-made story of sexual awakening, social ostracism, and inner strength. Although at times the film seems a bit lightweight, I found it to be entertaining and touching. Fans of Italian cinema won't want to miss it.",989280000,24,1173,5.146596858638744
1309454,5,B00003CXXY,"MAL&Egrave;NA is a feast for the eyes - at least male eyes - and I'm not referring to just the Italian location of the film shoot.
The extraordinarily beautiful Monica Bellucci plays MAL&Egrave;NA , a young woman living alone in an Italian coastal city in 1940. She's married to a local fellow, but he's off serving in Mussolini's army of conquest. Every day, as she languorously strolls through town, she attracts the admiring stare of every male, young or old, within eyesight radius. Among them is Renato, played by Giuseppe Sulfaro, who has only recently entered that hormonally tumultuous condition that we call Teenager. At first sight of MAL&Egrave;NA, Renato is in Love. Well, let's not put too fine a point on it ... Lust, actually. (Of course, all the local womenfolk look daggers at the young lady. And, aren't all our menfolk Pigs?)
Early on in the film, it's reported that Mal&egrave;na's husband has perished. From then on, Renato's interest in the girl becomes obsessive, but, at the same time, sweetly protective, as she struggles to live among the community. Rendered newly single by the circumstances of war, the men now wink and think her easily available, and the womenfolk think Tramp. Of course, Renato never actually talks to the object of his desire - he hasn't the nerve. The closest he comes to any sort of contact - outside of his feverishly erotic dreams, naturally - is the day she tells him to get out of her way as he blocks some steps she's descending. The storyline, and Mal&egrave;na's fate, culminates in the German occupation of the town, and its subsequent liberation by the Allies. By that time, Mal&egrave;na's position among the citizenry has been drastically transformed.
Male members of the viewing audience can only gawk at Monica's phenomenal charms with glazed eyes, and wonder where such a Siren was in their formative years. Female members are likely to inch away from their enraptured partners, and later exclaim vociferously that Mal&egrave;na was the victim of her own beauty in the face of society's blatant sexism and moral double standard. (Oh, and ask off-handedly, ""Is she prettier than I am?"" Don't go there, guys.) Both points of view have considerable merit, though the latter is more substantive, surely.
The performances of the entire cast are all wonderful, especially those of Sulfaro, and Luciano Federico and Matilde Piana as Renato's long-suffering parents. Admittedly, Bellucci's speaking parts are minimal, but all she has to do is simply stroll along, stand still, sit down, walk upstairs, or smoke a cigarette, to get the point of her role across. Moreover, the cinematography and soundtrack are both impressive.
I might argue that this wasn't meant to be a comedy at all, but a drama with humorous elements - though I'd have to admit that this position is probably a stretch. Certainly, at the end, a certain truth is manifest through Renato. A man will eventually get over his first sexual enthrallment, but it will always remain in his memory as a small jewel to be fondly remembered as he matures into the ways of the world and the opposite sex. In this, it has similarity to a charming movie of 1991, RAMBLING ROSE.
I really liked this film, and only wish it had won some Academy Awards.",988502400,18,3261,4.89873417721519

1309624,5,B00003CXXY,"This is one of the best movies I ever watched. This movie explores the theme of love, beauty, and sexuality. The whole life of Malena is presented through the eyes of the young boy. Every time I watch this movie I cry because I understand what this boy feels. I think that this was his only love that he will never forget. Malena's beauty is her punishment. Our society is such that people like to create stereotypes. Malena was forced to become a prostitute; she had no choice. This is definitely a philosophical movie that reminds me of works of Fedor Dostoevsky . In one of his books Dostoevsky also described girls who had to work as prostitutes. Dostoevsky describes these girls as angels with bright feathers. Malena's fate is to suffer. The crowd in the city where Malena grew up could not swallow the fact that Malena is a gorgeous woman. Both men and women are mesmerized by her beauty. Women and men jealous and gossip, and as a result, Malena's reputation is damaged and she could not find a job to survive. The community is heartless. The boy is the only one who seems to understand Malena's situation and bravely helps Malena. This movie is about the true love.",1509926400,2,1174,4.568720379146919
1309625,4,B00003CXXY,"This movie is like eating candy only to find it has a bitter center. Understand first for fans of Monica Bellucci that the version shown here is redacted as if it held some horrible dark secret about the assassination of JFK. Censored by 17 minutes; we are all adults so I don't know why it was so viciously cut. If you want the uncut version wou will need to purchase from Korea or China. I got this version only because it was available for $5.50. Yet it is a lovely story of a boys coming of age, masterfully done. I suspect Malenas beauty was symbolically maimed by the pettiness of the backward towns-people amidst Italian fascism during WWII; these are mean-spirited people, but so was Mussolini. Perhaps that is precisely why fascism flourishes. Her triumphant return to the crappy town which was the source of her abuse is puzzling and never explained in the short making of Malena bonus feature.",1509753600,,904,4.65625

1309698,5,B00003CXXY,"Malena is mostly a coming of age story, mixed with a period piece.  It is set in Italy during World War II, and is centered on a local teenager's lusting (kind of creepily) after the daughter of a local teacher and wife to a soldier off fighting in the war named Malena.  She is played by Monica Belluci, who most Americans likely know from the second and third Matrix movies.  She is the subject of town gossip from both the men and the women, and the only one who knows the truth about her life is the teenager who is watching her every move (when he is not fantasizing about her).  The story ends up taking a few turns, some rather dark, but it is very well told, well acted and has a satisfying ending.

I have the single disc blu ray Korean import of the film, which shows the uncut version not released in the US.  I have not seen the edited version of the movie so I am not sure what scenes were cut, although it is not hard to guess which ones.  There is a lot of nudity in the film, but it did not seem like it was just done for the sake of showing nudity.  The Korean disc is region free so it will play in US blu-ray players.  The movie has English and Korean subtitles (the film itself is in Italian).  The bonus material though (a making of feature as well as some interviews) only have Korean subtitles, so unless you can read Korean or understand Italian, those probably will not be worth going through.",1499126400,,1418,4.199261992619927

1309819,5,B00003CXXY,"*** In Italian with English subtitles ***

The breath-taking and alluring beauty of Monica Bellucci just stops my heart.  Here, her appeal has been captured as dreamy perfection through the eyes of a young pubescent village boy (Renato) in Sicily who tells the story.  It's the 1940s and the world is at war.  Malena is suddenly deemed a war widow, loses what family she has left... and is ultimately abandoned to make ends meet on her own.  And just how does a stunningly beautiful woman survive in such harsh and impoverished times when all women feel threatened by her and all men want to exploit her?!  What is a woman without a man and her family in such times?

This is quite the emotional ride.  We watch a woman brutally victimized by her environment and the times simply for being too beautiful... and perhaps for having some degree of pride.  She becomes a slave to perception and expectation.  Malena does what she has to in order to survive.  And we watch an innocent fall into shady hands, immoral roles, and cruel punishments because... she's a woman.  A beautiful, available woman during the worst of times.  It is mostly a heartbreaking portrait of such a woman.  But don't let that stop you from watching this.  It does leave you with an uplifting (albeit bittersweet) tone. And it's impossible not be be seduced and mesmerized by Malena's beauty all through the film.

This is such an interesting study of beauty.  Unforgettable, really.  I've seen it several times over the years and it never fails to move me with each viewing.  Highly recommended.",1478995200,,1568,4.7407407407407405

1309910,3,B00003CXXY,"The problems with this movie, for me, have nothing to do with the fact that I bought the ""cut"" version -- they have to do with the stereotyping of the representation of adolescent awakening and with the neo-Fellini-esque broadness of the representations of Italian manhood in the persons of the men of the town who lust after Malena and whose lusting seems connected to the fact that the women of the town turn against Malena when economic circumstances force her to sell herself to the Germans late in the movie.  The big shocking scene, of course, is the public assault and shaming of Malena by the women, and one could argue that it would be less shocking if the earlier scenes hadn't been so cartoonish, but the contrast is a crude device.  Tornatore -- whose ""Cinema Paradiso"" I enjoyed -- here seems to lack Fellini's feeling for the emotional rhythms necessary for the story to have its full impact and he goes for broad contrasts instead.  Even as a moral fable, though, it seems to me too broad and that the connection that we might be invited to consider between problems of masculinity and fascism are less well-handled than they are in, say, ""A Special Day,"" a movie I found much more engaging and troubling, even though it lacks overt violence.  What Tornatore, to his credit, IS willing to engage, however, is the idea of Italian women's complicity with their men's immaturity -- something that, in ""A Special Day,"" for example, is represented with maybe too much understatement in the final scene of that movie.  (I would just add, in passing, that Bertolucci's ""The Conformist,"" which also engages these issues, is a much more interesting and rich and disturbing movie.)

Monica Bellucci is an extraordinarily beautiful woman, but in this movie her character is less interesting than her situation, and she isn't given much to do as an actress except look sad and dignified.  She's striking not just because of her beauty but because of the contrast with the ugliness of everybody else.  The young boy who is obsessed with her and impressed with her is not interesting at all, and there's the problem that, as the narrator of the story from a later date, he doesn't seem to have learned anything that he can articulate about Malena's courage in the face of her moral dilemma and her vulnerability. ""I have loved many women . . . but I will always remember Malena"" doesn't cut it as a final word.  It sounds as if he has become just a slightly more sensitive chauvinist.",1467244800,,2485,4.720554272517321

Now I had a different take on that :I did not see this as being the case. The scene where they 'nearly' meet in the street suggested that She was well aware and was drawn toward the warmth she sensed emanating from the Boy: She moves toward him rather like a moth toward a light.....then walks right past him as though her actual eyes are blind.
Of course it looks like everyone saw different versions due to various edits. The one i saw was in Italian so i had to just interpret by watching closely.
This actress often says that it is the way she approaches a role, rather than her 'Beauty' that is important to her, and I have to agree that must be true.....another person mentioned her 'hauteur', and perhaps it is that sense of Dignity that sets her performance as the adored but maligned 'Malena' apart.

1310070,4,B00003CXXY,"I think Malena is an amazing movie both visually and in content.  First off, I must say that I am a big fan of Giuseppe Tornatore (especially Cinema Paradiso) so it was not very hard for me to love this movie.  But, aside from that, let me mention some of the aspects that made me like this so much.

First, Monica Bellucci's acting and Giuseppe Sulfaro's acting are superb.  With very little dialogue Bellucci uses gestures, postures and expressions to transmit the message.  Sulfaro's acting, at such young age, is also magnificent and sometimes can be truly hilarious!  Second, the movie is absolutely beautiful from a visual perspective, it will make you feel as if you are in Sicily back when the WWII started.  Third, the story is very powerful in so many levels.  It depicts, the reality of a small Sicilian town when the war started; the story of a little boy who falls in love with a woman who is completely out of his reach - who cannot feel identified by this!?; the destructive nature of envy and gossip between women in a small town like Castelcuto; the egregious grief that some of the Italian women had to overcome when their loved ones died during the war; how this little boy is so in love that he ends up doing the right thing even when it meant letting Malena go for good; among other things that I will let you discover for yourselves.

This is basically a romantic drama that can be very funny at times.  For instance, there is a scene in which Malena is sent to court for presumably sleeping with a married man from town.  Her lawyer delivers an absolutely hysterical defence which ends up succeeding.  Many critics have criticised this film alleging that Tornatore has sinned of falling into an overly voyeuristic film.  In fact, the film depicts Bellucci basically as the town's ""sex symbol"" from beginning to end.  Nevertheless, unlike what some critics have said, I believe that this serves the purpose of the movie.  It helps us understand the power of Malena's beauty, among other things.  Of course, the director could have made us come closer to the ""real"" Malena by showing other things than the banal sexual encounters with Centorbi (the lawyer), the police officer who brings sugar, etc., but then this would be a completely different film.

Lastly, I'll say that Morricone's music in this film does not come close to the absolutely amazing scores of movies such as the Mission, Cinema Paradiso or the Good the Bad and the Ugly.  Nevertheless, I believe that it is very good and fits this movie very well. I am sure you will enjoy it very much.  I believe everyone should watch this movie.  It is very entertaining yet powerful.

The ""edited"" version just seems to flow better and the sentimental quality that typifies Tornatore's work really shines through in this cut.  Somehow, the graphic sex and nudity of the original felt like more a distraction and not really necessary.  I can understand why film fans would want the ""uncut"" version of this film, and I don't usually agree with censorship, but in this film's case I don't find myself that offended.  Tornatore was allowed to edit his own film and create a version palatable to U.S. audiences and I feel like he does a fine job preserving the ideas contained his film.

A powerful ""love"" (in a TRULY, ""look, but don't touch"" sense); this movie is one reason why I love Euopean love stories and dramas: to thoroughly examine and explore through cinema the true boundaries of the human spirit, without all the CGI. The score by master composer Ennio Morricone is pleasureably haunting and of course what man would NOT want Monica Belluci (who plays the Title role, and from ""The Matrix Franchise"" fame), to explore one's libido. I believe she delivers a memorable, broad-ranged, dramatic performance, unveiling vulnerability, powerful sensuality, and at a time, a ""vampish"" character as a wife, in 1940s, who is lonely and yearning for her husband who went to war to support their country during WW II.",1386288000,5,805,5.014925373134329

There is a huge problem with the English subtitles. Tons of subtitles are missing from the dialogue..

There are plenty of times when towns people are talking and there are no subtitles showing at all. The townspeople talking is very important in this movie, it is essential to understanding and getting the feel for what this film is really about..

1310407,5,B00003CXXY,"I first saw this film via Netflix streaming last year and loved it.  I often suggest it to others, and came to the conclusion I should own it.  After searching online, I discovered some issues.  One being that there are two separate versions, cut (for American audiences) and uncut / special edition (apparently for the rest of the world...who have eyes and minds that can tolerate a visual portrayal of the nude human form).  Of course I wanted the latter, not only because Monica Bellucci is easily one of the most beautiful women in the history of forever and ever...but also because I despise an artist's creation being hacked and slashed due to a vocal minority of insecure 'potential' viewers.  Censorship of artistic expression is shameful, unless it breaks the law in some way.  The second issue I found was that as an American the only Blu-ray option I had was the cut / censored version.  Because of this I opted to search for the uncensored 2-Disc DVD set from Korea, which I'd found through research was supposedly Region zero and would play on Region 1 (United States, Canada, Bermuda, U.S. territories) players.  I contacted the Amazon merchant ""Import CD's"" out of California concerning the region issue and they provided me with all they had, which was not much more than Amazon had.

I went ahead with the order through Import CD's as I've dealt with them in the past.  Shipping was very prompt and the merchandise was in fine quality when received.  The back of the case stated region 3, so I used Wikipedia to find any more information and noticed that region 3 should NOT play in region 1 players.  I took a chance anyway, noting both the information from Import CD's and Amazon's website, as well as user reviews acknowledging the Korean version as the one to buy.  I was pleased to find that it indeed does work on a US Playstation 3, however the 2nd disc (special features) would not load.  Just a continuous clicking as the system continued the attempt.  I tried the disc in my PC.  GOM Player would not load it, but VLC did load the menu and managed to play through roughly 5 minutes of the first ""making of"" before stalling and not allowing any more playback, even after multiple attempts at different menu selections.  This is not a huge deal for me as I got the movie at a reasonable price and the actual movie was all I really wanted anyway.  I'll check YouTube, etc. to see if I can find special feature items at some later time.

Overall the movie quality is great (other than the first minute or two, in which video quality does suffer from lack of clarity a bit) for a DVD being up-converted on a PS3. The picture is 2.35:1 Anamorphic widescreen and the disc is single layer, NTSC. Audio was fine (the movie includes a great soundtrack!), with both Dolby Digital 2.0/DTS  and Dolby 5.1 surround as options.  If you're new to this movie, do understand that it is a foreign film (Italian) without English dialogue, so you'll have to opt for English or Korean subtitles with the Italian spoken dialogue.  I found that the subtitles did not really detract from my enjoyment of the film at all...and once you've seen the film you'll be watching it again anyway, so you'll have plenty of time to see it all.  The packaging reads mainly in English on the cover and binding, however the film description on the back is only Korean.

In summary, if you love this film buy this Korean 2-Disc version (Barcode # 8 809154 130234)...unless a Blu-ray uncut special edition for your region is announced, in which case that is a must buy over this!.  If you're on the fence and a Netflix subscriber, I suggest streaming it now, or rent it wherever you can find it...either version.  You won't regret it.  This is a fantastic coming of age film with wonderful acting and great atmosphere.  Highly recommended!",1354320000,4,3825,4.626666666666667

1310409,5,B00003CXXY,"It's been said that beauty is a curse. This saying is easy to understand, but how many people really get to witness how bad it can be unless it happens to them? Here's your chance to get a glimpse of said curse. Malena is a wonderful movie that, more or less, is about a young boy going through puberty, and happens to fall in love with a much older woman. You can't blame him- Monica Bellucci is gorgeous, a true head-turner. And when you have a flawless woman in a small town full of older women whose husbands ignore them the second she comes walking by, you've got a disaster waiting to happen.

12 year old Renato has just bought his first bike on the day Italy enters the second World War. Upon taking it to show his friends, he gets a glimpse of her: Malena. Time practically comes to a standstill whenever she's around. Some men stop what they're doing as soon as they see her, others desperately try to win her over with freebies or flattery. She's the daughter of the school's Latin teacher and her husband has went off to war. All alone at home, countless men will stop at nothing to have her. Though he wants Malena just as badly as they do, Renato's passion for the woman is more pure than the others. He can see right through everyone else and wants to protect Malena from anyone taking advantage of her. How can he do it though? He's a small, thin boy who's trying to be a man. The kid tries his best though! For example, he wants to wear long pants like adult men instead of the shorts all the boys have to wear. What grown man didn't try that at some point when he was younger? When her husband is reported dead, the competition for Malena grows more fierce. Some men make up stories about being engaged to her, some offer her desirable goods (like sugar and bread) which are hard to come by with the country at war. While Malena's troubles grow, so do Renato's. He's driving his parents crazy whenever he's *ahem* alone in his room doing something that a squeaky bed gives away. School isn't going any better either. He's head over heels for a woman that doesn't even know his name, always spying on her in his free time. Unfortunately, what he's about to see is something he's not going to be able to help with.

I don't know how he did it, but director Giuseppe Tornatore managed to make a movie, where puberty is a big part of the story, not over the top. There's never a moment where Renato's fantasies make you roll your eyes- all of what he says and does is very easy to relate with or understand. Even more impressive is taking a woman who is absolutely perfect in the looks department, and making her unaware of this. Malena keeps to herself for most of the first half of the movie, never using her looks to get anything. When she's accused of breaking up a marriage when a man is caught sneaking over to her home late at night, she doesn't have to give her lawyer Bambi eyes to get his help. Constantly gossiped about by the other women, Malena never actually does anything to get the bad reputation she has in the beginning of the movie. They just seem to hate her by default. The poor woman doesn't go out with other men or anything ""wild"". In fact, she spends a lot of her time taking care of her deaf father. As the movie goes on I felt more and more sorry for Malena. She's innocent, but when things get tough, a change needs to happen, whether you want it to or not.

The war isn't glossed over either. There are a handful of scenes involving planes and military personnel that serve their own purposes. Malena is full of beautiful cinematography, and the shot of planes flying over the city is breathtaking. I haven't seen many movies where Italy is the main setting, yet Malena really puts you right there in Sicily. There are plenty of sequences where you can truly appreciate the city and landscape. The rocky area where Renato and his friends do a little ""measuring"" looks like a great place to relax. As for the film's soundtrack, the main theme is very catchy, and I find myself humming it all the time. The legendary Ennio Morricone handled it, and it's perfect just like most of his work.

It's hard to talk about some of the funnier moments in the movie without completely ruining them, but there seems to be one major scene that upsets some people. Skip this paragraph if you want to avoid it, though it's not ruining any key plot points. There's one scene where Renato's father takes him to a brothel, realizing that his son needs to let out some of his feelings. After all, his mother thought he was possessed, and tried to get him exorcised! The boy's just 12 years old, and his dad takes him to a brothel?! Yes, it's a bad decision and we probably shouldn't be laughing when this scene happens (even the boss brings up that they'll either die in the bombing or get arrested after that visit), but how can you get so uppity over this?

The one flaw with Malena that I'll point out is the US dvd/blu-ray release- it's still heavily edited. By now, if you haven't heard about the Korean dvd, see if you can find that instead to get the full movie. You can do a quick search for what they took out and see if it's worth the extra money or not. Personally, I think the movie's still great with the edits. It's not like they took out the scene I mentioned in the above paragraph, or anything -that- important. It's still silly of them to do it though. If you want a relatively warm movie about growing up, Malena is a great choice. This is one of those movies I like to watch every couple of months to perk me up when I'm not feeling that great.",1352332800,2,5587,4.352828379674017

1310499,3,B00003CXXY,"73us Malna by Giuseppe Tornatore' (2000, 109')

An Italian romantic drama, richly prized, playing in a coastal town near Palermo, during and around World War II. Everyday fascism and everyday war, the latter relatively far away, but eventually closing in. German takeover, increasing bombardments and refugees, then American liberation of all of Sicily. At stages a situation not unlike Fellini's Amarcord (1973), especially as events are seen by adolescents.

Key ""objet du dsir"" (Buuel is never far) is a beautiful young woman of the local bourgeoisie, Malna Scordia (Monica Bellucci), who loses her husband early in the war, and for a long time resists all offers by locals and military males keen on her services. Her group of adolescent admirers, above all Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro), idolise her as an unapproachable beauty, and follow her daily moves on their bicycles.

Giuseppe Tornatore's best known screen work - Nuovo Cinema Paradiso - was released in 1988, a film narrating the life of a successful film director who has returned to his native town in Sicily for the funeral of his mentor. This obtained worldwide success and won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Subsequently, Tornatore released several other films cementing his place in film history. His main musical aide regularly has been Ennio Morricone,

After an earlier unsubstantiated accusation is rejected by the judge, towards the end of the war, poverty eventually forces Malna to become a prostitute. When their army comes to town, Malna serves Germans as well. As the war ends, the women gather and publicly beat and humiliate Malna, who leaves for Messina. A few days later, Malna's husband returns, to the shock of all the residents. He goes to Messina to find her; a year later, they return.

The villagers, especially the women, are astonished at her courage, and begin to respect ""Signora Scordia"". Though still beautiful, they think of her as no threat, claiming that she has wrinkles near her eyes and has put on some weight. The last scene, near the beach, is very Fellini-esque: Renato helps Malna pick up some oranges that had dropped from her shopping bag. Afterwards he wishes her ""Buona fortuna, Signora Malna "" and rides off on his bicycle.

1310501,5,B00003CXXY,"This Korean Special Edition of Malena is the version you've been looking for! The original film, uncut, uncensored - as it was meant to be... and as it was originally released in Italy. This is a two-disc edition.

Disc #1 contains the film in Italian - with three options for subtitles: ""English""... ""Korean""... or ""None"".

Disc #2 contains special features.

I have not tried to watch the film with Korean subtitles... so I don't know if that setting results in a blurred/censored movie - but I can confirm that when watched with the English subtitles the film presented is indeed FULL and UNCUT. All of the ""controversial"" scenes which were omitted from the American releases are there, and the film runs at just under 104-minutes (the ""cut"" American versions run at around 90-minutes). The scenes are presented without any form of censorship - no blurring or black boxes.

Personally, having seen both the ""Cut"" and ""Uncut"" versions of the film, I cannot understand why the scenes were cut for American audiences. There really isn't anything ""bad"" or ""more perverse"" about the scenes that were cut... especially when you take into account what was shown in the cut version.

1310503,5,B00003CXXY,"NTSC/Region 0. Includes the Uncut version, not issued on the US pressing. The latest triumph from Giuseppe Tornatore, the writer and director of the Academy Award-winning Cinema Paradiso, Malena is an utterly unforgettable story of a boy's journey into manhood amid the chaos and intolerance of World War II. In a sleepy Italian village, the most beautiful woman in town, Malena (Monica Bellucci), becomes the subject of increasingly malicious gossip among the lustful townsmen and their jealous wives. But only her most ardent admirer, young Renato Amoroso (Giuseppe Sulfaro), will learn the untold true story of the mysterious and elusive Malena! In a captivating motion picture nominated for two Academy Awards, the eventual struggles and hardships that Malena must bravely endure serve to inspire Renato to new heights of compassion, courage, and independence!

The cut version of the film offered on the US DVD is heavily edited, with virtually all of the cuts affecting the first story, and specifically Renato's dreams and fantasies (most of which show Malena seducing or making love to Renato). This shorter version of the film runs at approximately 92 minutes.

This Uncut Korean version of the film runs at approximately 104 minutes. Initially, it was available on DVD only in Italy, courtesy of local distributors Medusa. Later on, Korean distributors Spectrum also released the uncut version of the film on DVD (their release is essentially an NTSC-encoded replica of the Italian PAL-encoded release). Unlike the Italian DVD release, the Korean DVD release is English-friendly. However, interestingly enough, the uncut version of the film can only be seen as intended by director Tornatore if one turns on the English subtitles on the disc. If one turns on the Korean subtitles, plenty of the footage that is missing from the Miramax cut release is optically censored.

Note: In 2001, Malena won Best Cinematography Award (Lajos Koltai) at the David di Donatello Awards as well as Silver Ribbon Award for Best Score (Ennio Morricone) granted by the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists.",1333670400,4,2108,5.286567164179105

1310506,5,B00003CXXY,"This DVD works like a video tape or VCD. It has no menu, so just press play!

Narrated by a boy whose manhood had just started to sprout, the film revolves around the central figure Malena, who is a great beauty. Her asset turns out to be a curse as it only invites unwanted attention from men and jealousy from women.

The thing is, Malena did not encourage male attention by dressing provocatively or flirting with them. She keeps to herself. Due to circumstances created by the town gossips, she is shunned by her father and had to work as a prostitute.

What angers me most is the hypocrisy of this town and the sheer injustice of Malena's situation. The men have no self control,  some articulate their fantasies as if it was real, giving people the impression that Malena is eager to get it on. The women are just as bad. Instead of blaming their husbands for their lust, they drag Malena out and beat her savagely in full public view. She is forced to flee her village. Years later, she comes back with her husband (he supposedly died in the war). Since, Malena has put on weight and has a husband, the women do not see her as a threat any more. Hence, they treat Malena with respect and great courtesy. In my opinion, Malena should just spit on them.

Malena makes an incisive social commentary. It's about people who become misfits/outcasts not by their own design but society's. In Malena's case, she can disfigure herself to solve the problem - a ridiculous option but leaving town is better. The film is beautifully shot, the director had a great flair for great scenes and scenery.

This DVD is confirmed butchered as it had a 18 years rating. If you live in my country, you'll have to accept that films with lots of sex are often rated 21 years. You can watch it at the cinema but home videos will be banned. The cuts may have been done so that the film could be exported to countries with a conservative outlook.",1326758400,,1927,4.4602272727272725
1310507,4,B00003CXXY,"I saw this movie in the movie theater when it originally came out and then again recently on DVD.  The movie was not what I had expected when I first saw it (I guess I was expecting another romantic story like the director's previous ""Cinema Paradiso"").

It was however an interesting movie that attempted to portray a time and era (War-time small-town Sicily).  It seemed to me to primarily be a reflection on small town gossip and groupthink and how someone can be excluded because of petty jealousy. A young boy's coming of age is the secondary story I suppose.

Obviously, I have no way of judging the movie's ability to portray the time and era. I thought it was a very good movie however: sometimes sad, sometimes funny. Again, I wouldn't call it a romantic movie, so look elsewhere if you are searching for a romantic movie like ""Cinema Paradiso"". Similarly, while Monica Bellucci is obviously not hard to look at, this story is fairly harsh (unfortunately I would suggest it may only be realistic!) and not at all a sexual fantasy.",1325376000,,1039,4.66120218579235

1310576,5,B00003CXXY,"At the outset this seems to be a classic ""coming of age"" movie in which the young male protagonist is center-stage. Some of the early scenes are genuinely funny, and some of the ""Italian family on steroids"" moments almost seem to be played for laughs. But then, suddenly, much as a cold gust of wind might blow over an Autumn picnic, the mood changes. Malena is the beautiful young wife of a soldier and then, suddenly, a widow. The most attractive woman in the village she is immediately prey to all the exploiters, the vainglorious, the pompous - the fat and ugly men who stayed at home in safety while cheering on younger and braver men to go and die for the glory of the absurd dictator Mussolini. Left with no alternative except starvation, Malena becomes a whore. In time she sleeps with pretty much anyone who can provide her with some temporary measure of security, whether it be a bag of food or a respite from her dreary life. When the war comes to an end, the same crowds who cheered Il Duce so enthusiastically cheer the American soldiers - and in the background the women of the town seize their chance to beat and disfigure Malena. And the crowd watches it happen, as though it were a Roman circus. This is the most powerful and disturbing moment in the film because it is so depressingly true to life. At the moment of her greatest suffering and her greatest need of aid, no one comes to Malena's side - not even the young boy who adores her. Everyone just stands and watches.

So this is really a movie about lost innocence, but a loss of innocence quite different from that which we initially expected. Here the loss is of faith in the ultimate benevolence of human nature. The townspeople are shallow, spiteful, viscious, and without moral compass. In the end, when Malena and her not-dead-after-all husband return to the town, they make great show of being nice to Malena now that she's got a few wrinkes and has gained a few pounds. But no one has learned anything. They people are still what they were, and could turn again at a moment's notice into the rabid mob of old, or the applauding crowd always ready to worship a powerful leader. Malena's husband is a shadow of the virile young man who set out to war years earlier and Malena herself is only a fraction of what she was. And the young boy, now a young man, remains haunted - but now he's haunted by a dream of something infinitely precious that was broken and spoiled for no good reason except the spitefulness of humanity.

In short, this is not a ""happy ever after"" movie. But it is worth every moment. And the music is almost unbearably poignant. And, this review refers to the Italian version - apparently the US version is cut beyond redemption and not worth the price of a postage stamp.",1309132800,2,2773,4.5
1310577,4,B00003CXXY,"Malena is a troubling, yet unforgettable movie.  Malena (Monica Bellucci) is a recent, young widow whose obvious attractiveness brings her the attention of all men (and boys) in town, as well as the savage glares of the women.  Twelve year old Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro) is no exception, except that he practically stalks her for the next 2+ years.  Part guardian angel, part peeping Tom, Renato chronicles Malena's transformation from a loving wife to a person who does what she needs to do to survive in WWII Italy.  You will cringe at the gossip, the crude references, and the unwanted advances.

Were men all that bad at that time?  And think... things might not be as obvious today, but how is the current situation the same, and how is it different?

At times, the film becomes preoccupied with his obsession with her, but that is very entertaining, if the viewer is willing to accept that what he is doing is something every boy/young man of his age does, whether they admit it or not. Hint-he has to oil his bedsprings to not wake the family up at night. Monica Belucci has been chosen many times as one of the most beautiful women in the world, and has even been picked as #1 on a list or two. Nothing in this film will change anyone's mind about that. This film is intended for adults, and there is a bit of disturbing footage in it. Malena is driven into a life she never wanted, for which she is condemned, but there is a point of relief later. This is a film which can make you think about a lot of things- war, survival, obsession, forgiveness. Note that it is in Italian with English subtitles.",1296518400,,976,4.252688172043011

1310581,4,B00003CXXY,"I have not seen the uncut version of this that film buffs seem so adamant about here, so this is a review of the shortened version.

I did not like the way that the film started.  It seemed, like so many contemporary Italian films, to have a kind of reflexive felliniesque tone, with cheap surrealistic flourishes, absurdly grotesque images, and melodramatic exaggeration.  Unfortunately, though this works perfectly well for Fellini because it flows organically from his own imagination, when someone else uses it, it comes off as contrived, even silly.  So, this is the absurdist tone of the film in the beginning, when the boy is infatuated with a woman of phenomenal beauty.  It is more caricature than anything I could relate to, but perhaps that is personal.  (I have lived in Italy.  It is a lively, vibrant place, but it never appeared to be a living burlesque like it does in these stylized films.)

At this point, as the boy is discovering his sexuality and idealized love, the film abruptly shifts in tone.  With her husband gone to war, Malena is left to fend for herself; the older women are jealous of her youth and cruelly seek to undermine her.  Believing that she is widowed, Malena is forced into prostitution and humiliation at her powerlessness.  The boy witnesses this with acute sensitivity, horrified yet unable to do much of anything to help.  This part of the film works better, exposing the boy to the natural cruelty and hypocrisy of the town's people as they mock her while contributing to her downfall.  It is brutal and ugly and entirely believable as she becomes an embodiment of the fallen woman.  Forced to trade sex for food, she falls in with the Nazis and upon liberation is brutally beaten.  Bellucci delivers an extremely sympathetic performance.  In the end, the boy provides crucial help to the redemption of this woman, in a way signaling that he has become a man.  It is beautiful and moving in my view and overcomes the shortcomings of the first part of the film.

1310582,5,B00003CXXY,"If you've made your way to this rather obscure listing, there are several things you need to be aware of:

1) This review pertains *ONLY* to the ""medusavideo""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/malena-Dvd-Italian-Import/dp/B000YEDM98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">malena (Dvd) Italian Import</a>&nbsp;(ASIN:B000YEDM98) version of Malena. Amazon has an unfortunate policy of transferring reviews from one edition to another, even when they are not at all relevant.

2) This MedusaVideo release is the real thing, with no cuts at all. Medusa was the film's original production company, and its original distributor. This is not an Asian knock-off, and it is not the hatchet job put out by Miramax/Disney which chopped out roughly 17 minutes from the film. Apparently most Asian versions claiming to be ""uncut"" in fact have brief shots omitted, due to local laws and taboos.

3) This DVD is a PAL Region 2. Some US players will play PAL encoding just as easily as the US standard NTSC encoding, but not all will. However, you will definitely need an all-region player to accept a Region 2 disc; otherwise your player will simply give you an error message, and won't even attempt to play the movie. The US standard is Region 1.

4) The soundtrack on this edition is in Italian only, with NO option for English. The movie does have subtitles, but again the subtitles are in Italian only, with NO option for English or any other language. So you will need to be able to make out either spoken or written Italian in order to follow the movie.

5) Medusa has released three different editions of Malena:
--a single disc of the movie alone;
--a two-disc package including the movie by itself, and a second disc filled with interesting extras or supplements, again in Italian only; and
--a three-disc package of these same two DVDs, plus an audio CD of Ennio Morricone's soundtrack, which is also available separately as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malena/dp/B00005AV1Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malena</a>&nbsp;(ASIN:B00005AV1Z).
All three of these releases are priced differently, whether or not they are shown as such in this listing. If you order this original uncut MedusaVideo version from an Amazon Marketplace seller, be certain you understand which of these three editions is being offered, and at what price. You will need to contact the seller to verify this information before ordering.

6) You may notice an apparent discrepancy in the movie's runtime - IMDb gives the NTSC runtime as 109 minutes, whereas the PAL runtime on this disc is 105 minutes. Be assured that nothing has been cut; PAL simply runs imperceptibly faster than NTSC.

7) At the time of this writing, Amazon's listing contains a couple of confusing errors which may have been corrected by the time you see this review. The movie is actually Unrated (UR), for mature audiences only; and the director is, of course, Giuseppe Tornatore.

1310584,5,B00003CXXY,"A city as though under the spell of Circe, every man grunting and hoggish, every woman a shrieking harridan, the boys a pack of feral dogs, their victim a young woman apparently entirely virtuous, whom her soldier husband has had to leave behind in a place not her own,and who is treated as foul because unbearably fair--this is the darkest movie I have ever seen, possibly excepting The Lord of the Flies.  The atmosphere is one of impending human sacrifice, the near-ending is in fact torture, short of the very flawed boy hero there is no trace of decency, or courage, or even honest ardor among the men toward this lovely, tragic creature.  That all this happens in a city of considerable elegance (it is most certainly not a village) and in a landscape with the austere magnificence of the Italian south only tightens the screw.
It is a movie of genius, impeccably acted, superbly cast, beautifully shot, perfectly paced (and, yes, of course this, not the maimed American studio version, is the only version to buy).  Is it flawed genius?  Does Malena represent a loathing of humanity too deep to be sustained?  Or, even worse, the kind of thinking that here comes out of Yale that all small town people are necessarily crass brutes?  There is similarly comprehensive scorching in the stories and novels of Flannery O'Connor, but O'Connor is holding us up to God, and this does not seem to be the game here--the young hero would seem (it is done in gestures and glances)at the very end to learn high secular virtues of courage and thoughtfulness, but not, I think, Faith.  I know Italy very well (I do not know the south at all well) and such comprehensive vileness does not seem part of the landscape that I have ever known.  In this whole city, is there not one intelligent and gracious woman, one man of delicacy, even one young man of courageous gallantry?  They are usually around.  Does not one father reprimand his son for behaving as obscene lout to an unprotected woman?  It is all yet stranger given that Malena is no wretched serving girl.  By her clothes, bearing, and her husband's house, she is a lady.  In the wedding photograph she once dances with by herself, her husband appears to be a gentleman, and is likely serving as an officer.  All this seems to do nothing to protect her.
This is, of course, a war movie.  There is a suggestion at the very end that the hysterical wickedness, or wicked hysteria, of the people is a part of the condition of war, or, more precisely, of war under Fascism (the city is so locked into hatred that even a returning, wounded, Italian officer is casually knocked down in the street by one of the porcine city fathers).  This may be.  A sort of storm does seem to pass with ending of the war, and gleams of light do creep out.

There is an early scene of a group of boy's hovering over an ant with a magnifying glass trying to fry the insect. This scene portends to the underlying cruelty of the townspeople that will eventually coalesce into the horrible treatment of Malena once she is left on her own.

1310673,5,B00003CXXY,"I enjoyed this movie, but it is distressing because it happened too many times at the end of WW2.  It shows both the strengths and weaknesses of human character.  It also shows how easy it is for a society to ravage and ruin someone's life, especially a woman or stranger.  Monica does a good and perhaps great job playing her character, and if you like the ""grown up"" narration of the narrator's past, i.e. The Wonder Years or Sandlot, then you should like this movie as well.  The only aspect that I did not find totally credible, is when Monica surrenders to the town's expectations of her in order to get food, she seemingly disliked sleeping with an Italian leader but later in the movie, seemingly enjoys sleeping with multiple Germans.  Given that she continues to love her husband throughout the movie, I find it hard to believe that she would give herself totally over to the Germans even when it was the only choice to get food.  I am not saying that she may not have had a good time, but given the theme of the movie being the tragedy of what happens to her and her love for her husband, it would seem contradictary to then have her enjoy being a prostitute given that the town forced her into it.

Not that Miramax understood this, but the nudity was never meant to be exploitational or superfluous: it was very much intrinsically tied to the story.  Cutting out the nudity actually ruined the story that this film was telling and when you edit out the story you ruin the film - which is what Miramax did with the American release.

It has, after all, all the required ingredients : the setting of Fascist Italy, Monica Belucci, a boy entering puberty, lust, voyeurism, small-town gossip, jealousy, rape - and to top it all, the failsafe foreign-film label complete with subtitles. How could it fail?

But make no mistake; this is a poor, poor film. It has to be, if even the considerable charms of signora Belluci eventually not only fail to hold the interest, but, unbelievably, start to irritate. It is so overstated, espescially in the cartoonish, stereotypical overreaction of the men of the town (when she passes by) that it repelled me. One can still make allowance for the clich of the macho Italian man, but not for the course, offensive chauvinism which we are expected to believe all the townsmen wallow in without reservation. It eventually amounts to little more than an insult to Italian men in general and, more pertinently, the viewer's intelligence.

Add to this the fact that the film borrows heavily, and poorly from the standards of the foreign-film diet (Cinema Paradiso, from the same director, immediately comes to mind) and you have, in a nutshell, all the reasons to avoid this flop.

1310719,4,B00003CXXY,"Giuseppe Tornatore's ""Malena"" (2000)is a moving, nicely put together portrait of small-town narrowmindedness. Set in Sicily during World War II, it follows the misfortunes faced by a beautiful young woman whose soldier husband is presumed dead. The lovely Monica Bellucci plays the silent, voluptuous Malena whose face and figure raise havoc in the minds (and bodies) of virtually every man in town. Among her ardent admirers is 12 year old Renato (well portrayed by Giuseppe Sulfaro), who spies on her by day and enthusiastically fantasizes about her by night. The lust of the local men and envy of the townswomen eventually lead to Malena's ostracism, and when her penniless situation forces her into prostitution the women take violent action against her. When Malena's husband unexpectedly surfaces, it is young Renato who helps put an end to her pitiful plight.

Although the action takes place in a Sicilian coastal town, one can imagine similar circumstances occuring in many a small, insular community, in nearly every part of the world. Skillful actors (La Bellucci says little, but her performance is soulful) and effective cinematography create a realistic depiction of life in a southern Italian town of the 1940s. One gripe on the part of this viewer: the version of ""Malena"" released in the United States was cut to remove scenes of nudity, most notably a scene in which Renato has a ""vision"" of a (fully frontal) nude Malena. What stupidity on the part of American censors! Are we really so puritanical that we cannot face the succinctly sexual nature of most young boys' fantasies?",1216684800,,1597,5.095419847328245
1310720,5,B00003CXXY,"My review is directed towards those of you who have already seen the EDITED version of this film because I am more interested in informing you about this particular version rather than summarizing this wonderful story itself. If have not seen ""Malena"", the only review you need is ""SEE IT"".

First off, ""Malena"" is my favorite monica Bellucci film (and I have many of them as far back as ""La Riffa"", ""The ""Apartment"" and ""How Much Do You Love Me?"". Admittedly, I got a late start on Monica Bellucci as ""Malena"" was the first film I saw of hers, although a pretty good jump start to the rest of America considering her films were unheard of in America before this film. But it's also a wonderful, wonderful film that is funny, sweet, touching, hurtful, heartwarming and just enjoyable to watch.

Now with the newly released uncut version, there are pros and cons. For those of you who have seen the film and love it, you MUST get the uncut version. There are many extended scenes and LOTS and LOTS of added scenes - 16 minutes worth! Many of these scenes enhance the storytelling in the desires and dream sequences that Renato has for Malena, thus most of these are of Monica Bellucci nude including many scenes of her topless, Renato rescuing her, fantasizing about her, Malena washing her breasts and even an extension on an existing scene where Renato imagines Malena coming into his room (the theatrical release has her walking up to him and the scene ends). In the uncut version, the scene continues beginning with what I thought was great detail as Renato slides up her skirt to reveal her garter strap (you remember when the boys were follwinng her around the village and there's a camera shot of her garter clasp through her silk skirt...that is a very sexy scene). Renato proceeds to undress her until Malena is totally nude from the front and side. Renato kneels down so he is eye level with her vagina, which you do not see as it is a side view, but it is a close-up of her pubic hair.

All of these scenes are tasteful and in context and consistent with the film. They NEVER should have been taken out. This is a beautiful film and a beautiful story and all these 16 MINUTES of deleted and extended scenes were actually the original version of the film and were later HEAVILY edited for American release. Again, these scenes are very tasteful scenes. I think the only reason they were cut for America is because of the young age of the Renato character being in direct contact with a nude, adult woman (especially one like Monica Bellucci...lucky, little bastard).

The ONLY problem I have with this film are he subtitles (what's with these Korean only releases of Monica Bellucci films anyway?). Make sure you press your ""subtitle"" button on your remote to access English subtitles. The problem with the subtitles, and it's only a few instances, is that a few scenes (that were in the theatrical release) are missing the subtitles (ex: when Renato is first masturbating in his bed and the squeaking of the bed springs wakes up his father and his father screams, ""you're going to go blind!"" - the subtitles are absent.). This is the case in a few scenes. Also, some of the subtitles come in too early or are not complete. For example, when Malena's father gets the note from the school headmaster in the middle of class regarding what's been going on with Malena and the student next to him reads it out loud to the class over his shoulder (Malena's father is mostly deaf), not all of the letter is in the subtitles as it is in the theatrical release. Also, at the funeral scene when people are offering their condolences to Malena, the man who sells her food reminds her that his ""offer still stands"", but if you hadn't seen the theatrical release and knew that, you wouldn't because the subtitle comes in several seconds before with a different character. If I was seeing this film for the first time, I would miss a few things here and there because of the subtitles, so if you are showing it to someone for the first time, you may want to fill them in on a few scenes. Otherwise, I'll never watch the theatrical release again as there is SO MUCH missing from it.

Lovers of this film will be quite pleasantly pleased with the added material that should never have been deleted in the first place.

VIVA MALENA!

The story of a boy fascinated with her, peeping on her whenever he can, is very believable, and he plays it well.  The whole picture is reminiscent of 'The bicycle thief' and Sophia Loren era of Italian movies, but much better.

The men lust for her.  The women despise her beauty.  The plot follows the boy's obsession with her - he watches her grieve over the loss of her husband - he listens to the malicious rumors of her philandering - he  grimaces when he sees the unwelcome advances - and he learns how she copes with poverty and hunger.  Renato's family is hilarious as they deal with his coming of sexual age.  Movie is enhanced with beautiful music and spectacular cinematography.",1202515200,4,630,4.621621621621622
1310723,5,B00003CXXY,"Note: Italian with English subtitles.

This is an incredibly sad and poignant film about the despicable treatment levied by an insensitive community on a World War II wife (Monica Bellucci) left alone to fend for herself while her husband is away serving in the Italian Army. It's rumored that he has died in battle but no one knows for sure, not even Malena. It soon becomes assumed by all that she is now a widow and available.

By far the most beautiful and sexually desirable woman in town, the entire community virtually comes to a standstill whenever Malena walks by. The men make little to no attempt to hide their lust as they undress her with their eyes, while the women of the community stare at her just as fiercely for being what they could never be.

Men of influence and wealth are ready and willing to take advantage of the situation. Under the pretense of kindness and generosity they offer their services all the while seeking only to satisfy their carnal desires with her feminine charms. Refusing their sexual advances only makes matters worse for no matter what the truth may be she is unfairly branded a whore and a husband stealer.

While she continues on with her daily routines she silently suffers through all the slander and abuse heaped on by the town. Only one young teenage boy seems to see the sad truth of the situation but he can only watch and quietly deal with his own lustful desires for Malena.

Just as Malena is about to reach her breaking point the German Army occupies the town. Having been rejected for so long by her community she turns to the enemy for acceptance and comfort. This of course only serves to fan the flames of hatred towards her. When the soldiers are finally forced to retreat a final confrontation between Malena and the townspeople is inevitable.

Monica Bellucci is stunning in the role of Malena. Her silent, long-suffering portrayal is heartbreaking. This is pure speculation on my part, but I wouldn't be at all surprised to discover she was picked for the part of Mary Magdalene in Mel Gibson's ""The Passion"" based on this performance.

Don't buy the - Region 1 - release which has been horribly truncated into 92 minutes. This 2 disc - All Region - ""Director's Cut"" - release from Korea is the one you want to purchase. It's 108 minutes in length, giving you an additional 16 minutes to enjoy the beautiful Monica Bellucci! ""Viva Le Difference!""",1196726400,9,2412,4.6745283018867925

1310725,4,B00003CXXY,"""Malena"" is a good film.  I watched the American DVD; and might have enjoyed the uncut version even more.  Director and writer Giuseppe Tornatore won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 1988 for ""Nuovo Cinema Paradiso.""  This film follows a young boy Renato through the war.  While wars and rumors of wars swirl around the story, Renato is firmly focused on what most boys of his age would be: girls.  Giuseppe Sulfaro in his first and only film (to date) plays the boy with puppy dog eyes and a racing bicycle.

As an actress, she's not asked to do much other than look beautiful.  Renato's father Luciano Federico is hysterically funny as his interface with the boy gives the family relationship reality that seems juxtaposed to the horrors of war about to be unleashed.  The brutal scene where the women of the village assault Malena is chilling.  Malena's husband Nino returns home from the war after having been reported dead and tries to track down his wife.  When they return to the village, Malena shops in the market and tries to mend fences with the same women who were so incredibly mean to her.  Lajos Koltai was nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography.  Ennio Morricone was nominated for an Oscar for Best Score.

The star is a horny 13-year-old who fantasizes about a relationship with this grown woman, ""Malena,"" a sexy lady who gets all the mens' attention in the town, and all the wrath of the jealous town women.

This is a strange film at times but beautifully filmed and almost always interesting. Monica Bellucci is indeed a feast for any male's eyes. She is almost beyond description, looks-wise. What happens to her, unfairly, near the end is not pleasant. Otherwise, it's a pretty humorous film in segments, especially with dialog between the young kid and his dad.

There is a such a mixture of genres in here that is makes the movie fresh almost every time I see it, which has been three times so far.",1189900800,4,815,4.575342465753424

It might be too artsy fartsy for my taste, but waiting for the next scene with Ms Bellucci made up for all the scenes that were too ""cinematic"".

I also got a sense that this story has many levels. One of them was about how experience teaches and sometime how people are aware of other sides of a story simply because they were lucky enough to notice more than others. I also think at some level, the writer wanted to convey his feelings about mass psycology and Italian ""nationalism""",1189209600,,763,4.373239436619718

The movie is richly narrated, not only visually (through the strong performance of Monica Bellucci, among others), but also through the beautiful music of Enio Morricone.

While the movie will be interesting to those looking for a purely historic picture of Italy during WWII, people looking for an emotionally moving artistic experience.

If companies think that veiwers are too stupid to make up their own minds on what they want to watch then they realy shouldnt bother producing films.  Sad to say, when Americans complain about their films being cut they need to take a look at the idiots who clasify films in the UK (Average age 80) Must be great them sitting through hours of 'explicit scenes' only to cut them for us the masses.  I can only assume they think we don't have the ability to watch a film and make up our own minds we need others to do that for us.

Anyway on with the film.  Monica Bellucci is an exellent actress and in this film she plays a woman who pursued by almsot every man in her small town while her husband is away fighting in the war finaly gives up when she believes that her husband has died.  First falling for the well to do in the town then sleeping with what it would seem half the German army based in the town.

Well I haven't seen the cut version, but I don't think the 13 minutes that was cut from the film will be missed by most individuals.  The story is about a 12 year old boy's infatuation and sexual fantasies of Malena.  The scenes that were cut I would probably guess were scenes where he was fantasizing about her.  Where he and she are in (at times) intimate positions.  Its not like a Misses Robinson where the young boy is of age, this is a 12 year old.  So I can see where Americans could find this objectionable or not really something they need to see to get a complete picture of the story.  The only thing really censored in this movie is when the camera pans down to the ""southern"" regions of women, and a tinted blob covers the ""offensive"" area.  Well personally I found it more disturbing when the whore was licking Renalto's chest.  Overall I enjoyed the movie, but just wanted to point out the differences so someone else could make an informed decision on which version they want to buy.",1176422400,6,1176,4.530805687203792

To my dismay the american version  was highly edited and terrible. They took out much of the ""questionable"" content, which resulted in a film with no flow and ultimately lacking in sense. It's ridiculous how our country has gone to such such extreme censorship procedures.

1310912,5,B00003CXXY,"This movie was at times very painful to watch for me. It's a movie that hits close to home. I know how people can be unjustly cruel. I actually cried both times that I've seen the film. My husband was a little surprised that it affected me so much.

The actress that plays Malena is indeed the epitome of what I would think a beautiful Italian woman would be and what the rest of the world romanticizes about. Actually, the actress that portrays her is almost a tad bit too mature, sophisticated, and pretty for the role. It's hard to believe that she comes from a village and has no friends. Well, then again, maybe she is perfect for the role. Malena looks do indeed spark lust in the men and envy, jealousy, and rage in the women of the town. Because she's an outsider (not from the town) and has no friends or family ties there, the people don't know her and are not kind to her. Her exceptional good looks don't help her at all.

It seems that Malena is shy. I noticed that while watching the movie, that she never says much and that when she walks out in public, she seems to be aware that people get quiet and stare at her as she is walking by. I think she is aware of the attention that she generates and of the unkind comments, but she does not know how to deal with it. She does not seem to enjoy the attention from the men. Some women revel in it but I get the feeling that she doesn't at all. So Malena is shy and modest and I think that the character is really just wishing that someone would give her a break. Some women in the world know that they are attractive to men and use that as a way to get what they want. Not Malena...at least not in the beginning. The ironic thing here is that Malena actually becomes a prostitute (the very thing that she wasn't but was accused of being by nearly everyone in town). Let's face it; the girl needs to eat to live.

The women of the town are jealous of Malena because of her looks and because they know their men desire her. If Malena had been the town tramp to begin with, all of the men would have had their fill of her and lost interest eventually. Because no one in town really seems to know her at all, that adds to her mystic and appeal. Malena was thought to be a widow early on in the film because her husband was thought to have died in the war. He later reappears in the film. I think that during the time that she was thought to be a widow, the townspeople could not believe that such a beautiful woman didn't have some lovers on the side. Of course Malena was virtually all alone and had no one to protect her.

Malena sees that her circumstances will not improve and she decides to profit from the one thing she has left: her beauty.",1162339200,7,2704,4.154580152671755
1310913,5,B00003CXXY,"""Malna"" is a wonderful film: a cross between the ""Summer of '42,"" about a star-crossed young man who is coming of age and in love with a ""widow""; a whimsical Roberto Benigni movie; and a Greek tragedy.  It is exquisitely filmed against the backdrop of Mussolini's crumbling, Nazi and then Allied-occupied, and finally free World War II-era Sicily.

Monica Bellucci is lovely, graceful and tantalizing as Malna, even when she morphs into a Mary Magdalene-like character.  Giuseppe Sulfaro is superb as her young, intrepid and unrequited admirer, Renato; and hopefully we will see more of him in future films.  And the musical score by Ennio Morricone is exceptional.

It is truly an artistic tour de force that should be viewed by film school students around the world, for its colors, cutting, and simply its sheer visual beauty.  It is as touching as it is sad . . . and both uplifting and hopeful.  It might have been an American classic if it had been filmed in English; however, perhaps its charm would have been lost.

1310914,4,B00003CXXY,"I first watched this movie in a class dedicated to film music. While the music is haunting and wonderful (Ennio Morricone, you can't go wrong). This movie is more than simply a tale about a boy lusting after a beautiful woman.

While watching this movie, I has the strangest feeling that I was watching something more than a foreign film about sex, war, death and coming of age. The entire movie is actually a metaphor about Italy in World War II.

Malena, the title character, is actually the personification of Italy. She is Italy. Watch her transcendence throughout the movie. How she is treated by the people, while it be bad or good, is a reflection of what Italian citizens felt about Italy at the time.

I have to agree with most of the reveiwers that the uncut version is vastly superior in every way. Without the complete scenes in which Renato is seen slwoly falling completely for Malena, the film is merely a beautifully shot film, with a lovely actress and a great soundtrack. Uncut, it becomes an insightful look into the passions that drive us, both as young adolescents and adults, for better(Renato)or for worse (Malena). Lastly, I don't know what version the one reviewer had who commented about the pelvic region being blocked out. My copy had no such censoring.

1310917,5,B00003CXXY,"This movie is intimate and special. Some reviews say it is the story of obsession, of fetishism, of trivial things. However, this movie is the story of something special in a young teenage boy's life: his fantasy woman.

  The character Malena rarely speaks throughout the movie, but we see her exactly how we are supposed to see her- through the eyes of an old man telling the story of himself in young ""love"". This perspective makes her ideal and special, with few flaws,as a fantasy woman is to a young man. Malena is instantly a likeable character, not awful and disgusting like those using her.

  We cannot forget that our narrator, Renato, is not actually a teenage boy but an older man telling his own story. Therefore, he is unreliable as a narrator. Malena's sins are washed clean through his judgement, and we believe him when we see her victimized by the other women. However, Renato has had years to think about everything, to contemplate what really happened to her. So, in the end, the people who use her are completely despicable, unable to garner any liking.

  Of course, she is a victim, but she eventually falls into the gossip that others believe she is guilty of with the men. The movie does offer a hint that she could have escaped all of the problems: she is from another city and her husband, for most of the movie, is dead. Yet, she chooses to not escape but to stay, and her fate is sealed.

  The music in the movie was nominated for Best Score in 2000,and it is beautiful, emotional. It truly adds to the feeling of the movie.

  I would recommend this movie to anyone for the compelling story, emotion, and characters. You will never forget this movie.",1140825600,6,1682,4.578595317725752

And  a performance from an Italian model that should make most American ""actresses"" reconsider their career choice.  Granted that Cinema Paradiso is  really tough act to follow, but this film holds its own in entrirely different ways.

A quick note to the reviewer who described this film as ""lacking in depth and emotion"":  try cutting back on the prozac!  Or perhaps you'd be happier watching Julia Roberts ""films"" where you won't be bothered with subtitles.  (what were you thinking?)",1136160000,7,582,5.239130434782608
1310919,1,B00003CXXY,"After watching Cinema Paradiso, I was ecstatic to watch another film by this wonderful director. I thought that the same emotion, engaging storytelling, and convincing, real characters that I saw from Cinema Paradiso will also come along with this film. But at the end, I was very disappointed. These are the things that annoyed me about this movie:

1) Malena. I watched this whole film thinking that there would be more to this character than her beauty and sex appeal. And I also hoped that somehow we would see the real Malena based upon a realistic and honest perspective from the young boy, or somebody. But instead, all the director gives us is an unrealistic and shallow image of Malena based upon all the wet dreams that the young boys have, and the blasphemous rumors from every woman in the town! Malena barely speaks in this movie. She's nothing more than just a sex symbol and a pretty face, that's all. We never get a chance to hear if she has something important to say, let alone do we actually see a personality or character in general. I never understood why, other than her beauty and the fact that most of the men and boys lust after her, does this whole town focus so much on her while they're at war! This overdone fantasy image of Malena overshadowed the film so much that it leaves the viewer sometimes wondering what's real and what's not, and at the end doesn't leave no sense of emotion on anything that's going on.

2) As I said before, I never understood why nearly every single person in town cared so much about this one woman. It made the whole movie seem very unrealistic. Nobody even made an attempt to know Malena. At the end I didn't really understand why all of a sudden she's liked by everyone after nearly being torn up to the bone from being battered and beaten by the women on the street.

3) As a whole, this movie never really seemed to make a real point. It takes place during WWII. There's a woman who's so beautiful that the whole town lusts after her and hates her at the same time. A boy is going through adolescence. This story is retold by the boy when he's a grown man. Why out of all the women that he went out with in his life is Malena the most important? What has she ever said or done to affect his life? How has she affected him to be the man he is today? We never see why. They never had a conversation with each other. He saw nothing more in her than just a fantasy, a wet dream, and then a woman who's wrongfully misunderstood. She never revealed her true character to him, and vice versa. So at the end, are we supposed to feel sorry for Malena? Is the movie supposed to make a statement about how to not judge a book by its cover? Were we supposed to get some newfound insight about the main character? I don't know about some other viewers, but I just didn't get it. I thought this story told by the young boy as a man was supposed to have some in depth purpose to reveal something important about his life or about Malena herself. But at the end, esp. since the fact that he had more of a visual than a vocal voice, and never really explains exactly WHY or WHAT he sees in Malena other than her beauty, it leaves a very disappointing ending. I think if this movie had put more depth and reality to the story in general, it would have made it a more emotional, moving, as well as entertaining experience. I think it's a shame that in 1 hour and 30 mins, I didn't get anything out of this. At the end I believe that this movie tried to do nothing more but showcase how so damn sexy and gorgeous the title character is when she's repeatedly walking down the street with a tight and sexy yet elegent dress on like some runway model.  And i think that's such a shame, because this movie could have had so much more depth and emotion beyond that. I expected something much better from the director who nearly changed my life and made me cry in his last film Cinema Paradiso.",1130457600,10,3932,4.316644113667118

Large, black blotches are used to block out pelvic anatomy without clothing, which now seems typical censorship for all these (Korean?) imports.

1311029,5,B00003CXXY,"For anyone interested in watching Monica Bellucci's ""Malena"", you should by this ""Uncut Special Edition"". As other reviewers have said, the version that is available in North America is one that has been censored by Miramax. I saw that version first and then bought this one. This version, imported from Korea, is the full film---the way it was meant to be seen. And it is ofcourse much much better.

They censored such truly beautiful scenes that once you see them, you wonder why in the world would Miramax cut them out of the film. I'll just give one example. In one scene, Malena is lying on a chair outside her house on the porch, relaxing in the sun and drying her wet hair. She is wearing a light summer dress and has her hair hanging behind the chair. Drops of water are falling on the ground. The young boy Renato hids behind a tree and looks at her. It is such a beautiful image of Malena that you just want to keep watching it. And apparently the Miramax censor board found this scene too erotic and removed it from the film. I won't tell you the other scenes, I don't want to ruin the movie. So watch the Uncut Edition, and you'll see what you're missing and what a great film this is.

The most striking thing about this movie is that the two central characters of the film, Malena and Renato, do not talk to each other in the whole film. They don't even have a brief conversation. There is only one line---the last line of the film that Renato directly says to Malena, but Malena's reply is a nod. She doesn't say anything in words. But still the whole story revolves around the two. It is truly remarkable that Tornatore, the director, was able to convey such a unique story, mostly through images and not words, showing the true magic of cinema.",1128384000,30,1761,4.432098765432099

One is the town's inability to accept someone so Hot. The women hate her, and call her a slut. The men trick her, bribe her, and force her into bed.

The second story is about a 12 year old boy who is starting to notice women, and of course, he notices Monica Bellucci (Matrix Reloaded). His constant fantasies about her are driving his friends, and family mad, and are all the nude scenes that are added back into this UNCUT version.

If you are looking just for a story, then see ether version. If you are looking for Monica Bellucci naked, then see this.

The reason that is was cut, is because it is illegal in the US to show  underage children in sexual situations. The 12 year old boy in constant fantasies with her naked, is just that. And those are the only real nude scenes of her.

There is none... its so many things put together into one whole great movie motion picture. Monica Bellucci was amazing, and beautiful as always, and I don't think anybody else could have played a better Malena. The story was so sad, yet utterly beautiful at the same time, especialy the end when Malena returns to the village, despite all the terrible things they did to her, with her husband. I was so moved by this movie, I'm going to show it to all my freinds and everybody I know. The only thing I was a bit upset with was this DVD version. I watched the trailer before the movie, and on the trailer it shows the famous scene where Malena is lying down on the chair outside on the porch, lightly glazing a paper towel over her face and neck. That scene wasn't even in the movie!!! Geez, I really should get the FULL version, but whatever... it was still great, and since this DVD is cut to more appropriate srandards (despite its still unjustly rated R, and you can get it in Canada with a 14A rating) more people who are offended by nudity or whatever (thats really stupid but some people are) can see this version and appreciate it just as much.

1311034,5,B00003CXXY,"I saw Tornatore's, Paridisio and was impressed as were all the other critics.  The incredible recreation of the Italian World War Two era was astounding. The sites of old Europe make the trick a little easier for European directors - they only have to move the cars and TV dishes from the roofs, and in some places, Sicily, they may not have to do that.  Try making a picture about the 1940's in New York City.  It's studio simulation time which just isn't the same thing.

Monica Bellucci may have been just another model, but Tornatore saw something in her, and what a fascinating performance she gave him.  The beating and haircut scene is unforgettable, a magnificent work of art by the beautiful woman.  Where were the Academy Awards for this portrayal of the lonely Sicilian woman betrayed by her people?  The fools!  This is why Hollywood is in the dumps.  At least Harvey Weinstein was smart enough to front some dough for this flick.

How do Italian directors get so much splash out of every scene,  The people jabbering away with their arms in the air expressing every emotion, love, disgust, anger, spite, and jealousy all in a speedy moment.  I noticed this with the Italian neo-Realists of the post war years, and of course with the great, great, Enrico Fellini and his marvelous films.  Now we have a new master.

I found the film surprisingly unmoving on a second viewing; yes she had hard times, yes she was forced and raped and squeezed, yes she had few options. But I was desensitized and appalled all over by then. The barbarity and depravity of the culture she lived in made me wince from the beginning. These leering boys are creepy. The men-only talk is ugly. And the famous scene in which she is brutalized by the women of the town....well, if I had been there I hope I would have had the courage to offer her a jacket and an arm to lead her back to her house. This is a grotesque world, a world of double-standards, lies, deceit and an unrelenting coarseness that made me weary.

But I write this for one reason only. My second DVD, the one with the bonus offerings, provides no English subtitles to the films. Korean only. Though the menu of the DVD is in English, nothing else is. Not too useful to this speaker of neither Italian nor Korean. Others may be different.

1311036,5,B00003CXXY,"Note: Italian with English subtitles.

This is an incredibly sad and poignant film about the despicable treatment levied by an insensitive community on a World War II wife (Monica Bellucci) left alone to fend for herself while her husband is away serving in the Italian Army. It's rumored that he has died in battle but no one knows for sure, not even Malena. It soon becomes assumed by all that she is now a widow and available.

By far the most beautiful and sexually desirable woman in town, the entire community virtually comes to a standstill whenever Malena walks by. The men make little to no attempt to hide their lust as they undress her with their eyes, while the women of the community stare at her just as fiercely for being what they could never be.

Men of influence and wealth are ready and willing to take advantage of the situation. Under the pretense of kindness and generosity they offer their services all the while seeking only to satisfy their carnal desires with her feminine charms. Refusing their sexual advances only makes matters worse for no matter what the truth may be she is unfairly branded a whore and a husband stealer.

While she continues on with her daily routines she silently suffers through all the slander and abuse heaped on by the town. Only one young teenage boy seems to see the sad truth of the situation but he can only watch and quietly deal with his own lustful desires for Malena.

Just as Malena is about to reach her breaking point the German Army occupies the town. Having been rejected for so long by her community she turns to the enemy for acceptance and comfort. This of course only serves to fan the flames of hatred towards her. When the soldiers are finally forced to retreat a final confrontation between Malena and the townspeople is inevitable.

Monica Bellucci is stunning in the role of Malena. Her silent, long-suffering portrayal is heartbreaking. This is pure speculation on my part, but I wouldn't be at all surprised to discover she was picked for the part of Mary Magdalene in Mel Gibson's ""The Passion"" based on this performance.

Don't buy the - Region 1 - release which has been horribly truncated into 92 minutes. This 2 disc - All Region - ""Director's Cut"" - release from Korea is the one you want to purchase. It's 108 minutes in length, giving you an additional 16 minutes to enjoy the beautiful Monica Bellucci! ""Viva Le Difference!""",1120608000,101,2412,4.6745283018867925
1311037,5,B00003CXXY,"This wonderful film from Italy by ""Cinema Paradiso"" writer and director Gieseppe Tornatore is both hilarious and heartbreaking. What starts out as a coming of age obsession turns into a meditation on human cruelty, and poses many questions: Is it what people expect of us that makes us what we are? And if we change to be this, where do we belong then, and can we be accepted again in the life we choose to live?

Giueseppe Sulfaro is terrific as Renato, a young boy in an Italian town during WWII who has just gotten a new bicycle. His biggest goal in life is to get a pair of long pants so he can dress like a man. But once he sees the lovely Malena, his life changes forever. His adolescent fantasies about the most beautiful girl in the town are hysterical. He puts himself into the American films he has seen in these moments. We can't stop laughing at his John Wayne inspired ""Stagecoach"" western fantasy; ""My, you have the biggest guns in the west, Renato!"" His raging hormones are treated in a funny and yet tasteful manner.

His adolescent longing for the town beauty turns to something more as this film slowly shows Renato how this small Italian town feels about the lovely Malena. Men gawk and want to have her for themselves and the women hate her because of her dark beauty. They gossip to cheapen her. But Renato has been spying on her through a peephole and knows the truth. She is pure. She dances alone in her house with her husband's picture, faithful and waiting for his return from war.

Renato loves the beautiful Malena and defends her virtue by playing nasty tricks on the ones who talk about her. When she apparently becomes a widow her life becomes much harder and the gossip turns more vicious as the entire town pushes her towards the loose woman they want her to be; the men so they can sleep with her, and the women so they can feel superior. Once a ""payment"" is forced upon her by the town attorney her path is sealed and the young Renato watches the girl he worships from afar become a prostitute, knowing she is still pure, and has no choices.

Monica Bellucci is magnificent as Malena. She is ravishingly beautiful and quietly displays emotions underneath we can not see, an elegant dignity carried all through the film. Even as she is dragged into the streets and beaten by the women after American liberation from the Germans Bellucci's Malena maintains a rare dignity which separates her from the other women in the town. It is a raw emotional scene of a kind rarely if ever seen in American cinema.

Don't let this truly wonderful film pass by just because you don't like subtitles. Monica Bellucci is very memorable as the breathtakingly beautiful Malena. Renato knows he will never forget Malena. Neither will you.",1119484800,7,2754,4.578093306288032
1311038,4,B00003CXXY,"I just finished watching what I would describe as one of the most well told story a film could ever unfold. Malena is about war,beauty,hypocrasy,society and youth. From the cover the dvd shows one could easily mistake this is as a film with questionable amount of flesh. However, it's much more than you or I can think of. The first hour of the movie is funny and unbelievably exciting. The last half hour is gripping,panic stricken and jolting.

I don't know Italian but it seems like quite an expressive language. From Malena I learn Italy is just a very beautiful places. The direction is absolutely brilliant and the last 20 or so minutes leave you tongue tied and rather distorted. It almost bought me to tears. There is certain Italian music that plays in the film. I'd like to know what it means but not as much as I would like to just listen to it. The emotions deal with each other. There may be many remakes of this movie in many lands but none might quite hold the same gravity.

Recanto's character wins many hearts for sure but it's the silent lucidity in Malena's eyes that bowled me over.

Buy this for the love of impossible movies being made possible.

1311086,5,B00003CXXY,"Definitely a wonderful movie, Malena, brings to the screen the story of a GORGEOUS Italian young woman whose husband is pronounced KIA in Eastern Africa during WWII.  Subsequently, Malena falls victim to the gossip and prejudice of the wartime Sicilian town, resulting in the establishment of a vicious circle/self fulfilling prophecy where all that she if falsely accused of being and doing, slowly, steadily and gradually, becomes reality.
Malena is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about how trust, love, and inner strength, can lead out of situations, which might seem bleak or desperate at first glance.
In addition, the movie deals with such concepts as Envy, Jealousy, Prejudice, Intrigue, Lust, Greed and Hypocrisy, which are very unpleasant and yet are an integral part of human nature.
Needless to say, Monica Bellucci and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!

The score and the cinematography are a superb blend.  Some of the shots, particularly one series of Malena's home by the seaside, and another of the youths on the rock formation overlooking the sea, are simply breathtaking.

The story is a masterpiece and achieves a full peripety and final expiation.

You forget after a few minutes that the language spoken (Italian) is a total foreign language (because of the subtitles of course), it didn't take me long to live myself into their little town in ""Malena"".

The story is sad, and while watching it you'd like to step into Malenas' world to help her, and the movie works this way to be so realistic.

The boys' father himself stands for the humour. And though it's not always just funny what goes on in this boys' life, his ""a little mad"" father does put a smile on the audiences' faces.

[...]  I found the Special Edition version easily enough just by searching the Internet.  The one I have appears to be a Korean make with options for Korean and English subtitles (and original Italian soundtrack).  It's NTSC widescreen and 103 minutes long.

What a bummer this movie turned out to be!  It's basically about how evil the men (and women) of this little Italian village are to this poor woman left alone during WWII after her father is killed in an Allied bombing raid and her husband-soldier is declared to have been killed in action.  Left penniless and sexually abused by the men of the town, she turns to prostitution, and fraternizes with the German soldiers.  When the Allies win and run the Germans out, Malena is dragged out of the whorehouse into the street by the women of the town, who savagely beat her in public, strip her naked and cut her hair off.  This is a very hard to watch sequence that's not art or anything else, it's just very abusive stuff.  The beating just seems to go on forever, way too long, and this is most certainly one of the scenes that got cut short, deservedly so.

I guess Monica Belluci made another movie along similar lines (""Irrevesible"") where there's this savage hard-to-watch rape scene.  Wow, to think that those oh-so-liberal and artsy European filmmakers persist in shooting such scenes and putting them into movies in the name of .... art?  NOT!

Monica Belluci strangely enough looks very much like a mannequin in this movie, with her face constantly frozen into a forbidding mask.  She doesn't look good at all.  The movie is supposed to be done from the viewpoint of this young boy who is in his pubertal years.  Yes, it's true that boys of this age can be oversexed, but this boy and his pals are positively a bunch of creepy perverts, the way they stalk Malena and peek like voyeurs into her bedroom.

Overall, there's not much that's enjoyable about this movie.  And it's a two disc set.... I was so depressed after watching the movie that I haven't gone through the second disc of bonus materials.

1311090,4,B00003CXXY,"An interesting little film from Italy with an absolutely beautiful international actress Monica Bellucci (Brotherhood Of The Wolf, Under Suspicion). The story is narrated by Renato, a young boy torn between adolescence and adulthood. We see Malena's life through his eyes and the eyes of the other men in the small village that lust over Malena who just so happens to be a a gorgeous, stunning girl that all men lust all over. Her husband is off on the battlefield fighting a war and she is left by herself. No money, no job. Nothing. She is surrounded by horny men who would do anything to get with her, this also includes the narrator Renato who is just now exploring sexuality and all he sees day and night is the breathtaking Malena.

The gossip around the small village circles around Malena but Renato is blinded by love. (This reminds me of Last Exit To Brooklyn a bit too much). Renato defends Melena in any way he can, he also fantasizes about Malena quite often which shortly after turns into an obsession. He follows her day and night, he knows her probably better than she knows herself. He ditches school and his family only to watch her walk by, seeing her is an absolute heaven to Renato. Shortly after the story turns sour and we learn how jealous the women in the village really are, rumors start flying left and right about various lovers which some of them are unfortunately true but there is much more to it. Malena is an exotic beauty that turns the local village upside down and also the life of Renato.

I guess this movie is one of the light-hearted dramas that is strikingly original and it will most likely be appreciated more by the European crowd than the American. I am simply saying this because certain people tend not to watch movies simply because they are subtitled. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of dramatic movies.

Tornatore is one of the best directors out there with out a doubt, and I think all of his films are about nostalgia, Malena is by far his best, even better then Cinema Paradiso, Malena has a special visual look, I guess to make Bellucci's beauty even more astonishing, the story is told in perfect rhythm and the production value is first rate, you can't afford to miss this one, Malena what a film!",1105056000,4,1193,4.283185840707965

Despite being an artsy movie, the filmmakers have successfully managed to build up the climax of the film with a great deal of realistic details yet vivid picture.

The story revolves around Malena (Monica Bellucci), a gorgeous woman who lives in a town in Italy during the war. She was left by her husband, who joined the army, to deal with the war's complicated circumstances all by her self.

My interpretation of the movie is that the story of Malena represents the historical events that took place in Italy during the war, which was abused by the foreign invading powers and cruelly mistreated by her own people.

This is one of the rare movies that tackle the implications of the nazi movement on a European nation as opposed to the usual holocaust stories.

He expresses, out of all the characters in the film, the willingness to step outside his natural, cultural boundaries and grow past his traditional philosophy.  This film is not only about the life of Malena, but also about Renato's growth into an adult.  What events force Renato to grow into this new kind of thinking?
2. Implications: The film shows the evolution of Europe, and the break from traditional values, not only through Renato but through the insanity of the war.  In what ways does the movie show a critical eye to the old world?
3. Evolution: In what ways is the movie distinctly European, and yet more in detail, distinctly Italian?  Do you think the film is trying to make a general statement on the madness of war, or is it trying to make a visceral attack on the rigidity of Italian traditionalism?

Realism: The story premise is interesting: imagine if you had a guardian angel in the form of a young boy, but you never knew he existed... do you think the set-up of the story was meant to describe an actual sequence of events with the boy, or is the movie playing a more important role with symbolism?
5. Stageplay: The script provides for a seedier look at the foundations of Fascist Italy.  Do you think what was included was sufficient, do you think it was lacking in raw material, or do you think it contained too much teenage sensuality?",1089936000,3,1424,4.564705882352941
1311095,2,B00003CXXY,"This is a story of an Italian boy who grows a adolescent infatuation with a married woman who is so beautiful that she is horribly gossiped about.  Here are the reasons this is a bad film. 1)The film often drifts into the fantasies of the main character(all of them are about Malena). At one point, this is so prevalent you wonder sometimes what's real and not. You also start to wonder why the filmaker did this and I have no real answer except that he couldn't come up with anything else.  These dream sequences pull the film away from a grounding reality that the film fails to establish. 2)The title character is almost non-existant as a real character.  We see her in real life and in fantasy, but she hardly says anything, or reveals anything about her inner character.  This makes her a hollow basis for the film because she is in fact hollow and the character who is infatuated is vacuous as well. 3) The combination of these characteristics makes this film get to its conclusion heavyhandedly and it never feels real even if the results at the time were close to what we see.  Dramatically, it's just dumb and vacuous.  You wish it were more because you feel that Malena would have something interesting to say, but the filmaker chose not to.  These things only approach my biggest gripes with the film.  The gossip sequences, which are many, seem flippant and careless, and not the razor-sharped judgement that they would have to be in order to be a real factor in her life, which they are in the film. Sloppy, just sloppy storytelling.  How the film ends is also very telling of just how bad this film truly is.  He speaks about how he's loved many women, but the one he remembers best is Malena, the ideal that never came to grips with.  An ending like this would be good if the film developed a relationship beyond what is in this film.  This would be compelling if the protagonist was someone with more of a vocal perspective rather than a visual one.  As is, it would have been far more effective to use yet another fantasy to illustrate her historic importance to him, but by then I'm sure that the film would seem incredibly redundant because of the rest of it.  If this film had established the strong importance of the difference between fantasy and reality and how the protagonist felt about that it would be better.  The film doesn't take this road, however, by putting in the scenes of harsh realism which aren't earned from the deadpan, flippant tone of the rest of the film.",1083801600,6,2498,4.544642857142857
1311164,5,B00003CXXY,"Titillating, tantalizing, and tragic are just a few adjectives that come to mind...It takes no genius to realize Monica Bellucci is one of the most drop dead gorgeous international beauties of the current cinema. She is the Italian version bonafide beauty of Catherine Zeta Jones ! If that isn't saying much...
 Belucci seems to play recurring roles of women in great distress and abuse. She does this so convincingly and makes it look so effortless that she is a rare actress who can say much with her facial expressions and actions without really saying much; It's all in the eyes, baby. Malena is the telling of a 27 year old widow left to fend for herself in a small Italian village after the downfall of her husband during WW2. No one will employ her and the women sell her rotten food;it's cruelty in severe doses for Malena. Her father has disowned her due to false allegations of being the town temptress. Men and boys alike fantasize and want her. The women hate her. In comes a young 12 year old boy named Renato Amoroso who develops an obsessive crush over Malena but guards her and holds vigil from afar. This ""crush"" is what propels Renato into becoming and maturing into a young man who begins to understand that there is much more to romance and life than just lustful sex. He watches and follows Malena secretly and witnesses the many transformations she goes through to survive in a town that has turned hostile against her simply because of her striking beauty ! All of this will culminate towards an unexpected ending which will leave a strong impression to stay with Renato for the rest of his life!
Cinematography is...well, it's filmed in Italy, what more can I say except stunning panoramic views of the Italian coastline. Plenty of comedic and colorful characters in the beginning. The film starts off with much humor when the viewer is permitted to see into Renato's mind concerning fantasies of farce and romance. But things turn sinister as a town bent on hate begins to enclose on Malena... The film score by Ennio Morricone is extrememly effective, captures the time period and also is very likeable and memorable ! The best surround effects take place during a German air raid over the town. You can also hear great detail in the surrounds of the ocean waves crashing and wind rustling through trees;this transports the viewer to an Italian vacation. The only gripe is that this Miramax dvd version of Malena is missing about 12 to 17 minutes of scenes that were included in the Italian or European release. This was  due to more nudity involving Belluci's character and some scenes that raised eyebrows between more explicit sexual fantasies of Renato's.",1083542400,,2685,4.7720430107526886
1311165,5,B00003CXXY,"Malena is a moving coming of age story set in WWII Italy. It's the tale of a young boy who becomes infatuated with Malena, the town beauty. The women of the town are jealous and the men are cowardly, especially when Malena is beaten by the women when the town is liberated by the Americans. Malena was forced to turn to prostitution because nobody would give her a job. I found the scene very sad, but, unfortunately, also true to life. Malena is a movie I'll remember for a long, long time. I fully understand the young boy's feelings for Malena. The movie made it easy for the viewer to put himself/herself in his shoes. And it showed how difficult life was for a woman alone, a woman fighting for survival in WWWII. Malena is a universal story. That's why it was so popular.",1083196800,,777,4.402777777777778
1311166,5,B00003CXXY,"this movie has a lot of range.  for one, it's one of the funniest films i've scene (the scene with Renato going blind is classic).  nevertheless, it's also a rather depressing tale. thank goodness for the movie's quasi happy ending!  finally,... monica :o  Even if you have absolutely no interest in period movies and couldn't care less about drawing parallels between the experiences of the characters and italy's political upheaval... there's always monica :)",1078358400,,461,5.1891891891891895
1311167,1,B00003CXXY,"Malena is rich and beautiful film, starring the very fine Monica Bellucci in the title role. It is essentially three films in one, it contains the story of a woman who lost her husband to war, the coming of age of a young boy and also how Facism and war affected the Italian people.
Alot of other reviewers have summed up the plot and made valid comments, so I will only speak of the horrid DVD presentation. Being a huge fan of both the film and Bellucci, I wanted the single best DVD version and I'm afraid to say that this one is far from it! Miramax claim to be an independant and artistly geared studio, yeah right, they have dramaticly censored MANY great scenes from this film. Anyone not as repressed as the suits down at Miramax HQ should look into purchasing the NTSC Korean 2-Disc release. It is the ONLY completely uncut (a few minutes short than the Italian DVD due to PAL to NTSC conversion) DVD with English subtitles. The Italian disc is uncut but doesn't contain English subtitles, so it would only be good for Italian Speakers. Believe me once you see just how much this DVD is missing (over 13 min shorter than Korean NTSC, 16 min shorter than Italian PAL) you will be glad you put in the extra effort to get a real Malena DVD.
PS to the reviewer who thought that the beating of Malena scene was unrealistic or over exagerated for the film's sake, read a histroy book some time! Women who ""went with Germans"" were beaten, had their heads shaved and sometimes even killed in towns all over Italy and France the second the town was liberated.",1078272000,351,1559,4.435540069686411
1311168,5,B00003CXXY,"This is such an impressive movie. I saw Cinema Paradiso (by the same director as this movie) and I thought it was good, but this really seemed even better than that. I think the director Giuseppe, the crew and the person who wrote all the musical scores to the movie really deserve the success this movie made of them. The director for his ingenious storyline and very evocative technique of shooting a film in conjunction with the development of the musical highs and lows of the orchestral score. The music is oh so crucial, IMHO, for this movie to be executed in such wondrous, moving emotional quality. Without the music, I think half of the magical effect of this movie would have been lost. I can think of another movie which is directed with great reliance on the musical score - Three Colours Blue. But that one was much more reserved compared to this - that one was more about controlled emotions that were allowed to flow subtly. That was a French movie. Contrast it with Malena, an Italian movie, full of Italian emotionality and passion. For me, the Italian movie Malena deserved half a star more than Three Colours Blue because of this :)
The story has great force and although doesn't seem very realistic (what sort of horrible Italian town is that? surely there must be 1 in a 1000 who would at least step up to Malena's aid, especially when she was trampled openly by womenfolk in the townsquare! I mean, its not as if this is like olden day Arab states where women convicted of adultery were publicly shamed to death and everybody would think its okay right?) Still, like I said, the music has a lot to do with it whenever you feel like you're gonna drop a tear or whenever your heart goes out to the poor woman (and her husband's) suffering. Imagine watching the whole movie without music. How boring would that be?
Okay, the scenery was shot in such a way that captured the beauty (or rather, the exoticism to those of you who never grew up there) of a rather typical southern Italian town. I can think of a few more movies that shot and emphasised more beautiful views of other Italian countryside scenes... so that wouldn't be something that would figure largely in the impact of this movie on you, the viewer (unless you've never in your life seen any other footage of beautiful Italian countrysides on film or in real-life).
The main actress is very gorgeous (and I think if anyone used her as an example of their idea of a ""perfect girlfriend/wife"", they'd probably never get very far in their search for their perfect girl!) but that's not surprising considering she also used to be a Dolce and Gabbana model and is already a huge star back home. (Fame always makes someone even more glowingly beautiful than before.) Its easy to see why people would treat her like the real star of the movie - the whole movie was crafted around her; for her; the movie was made to make her get all the focus and picture her in her most beautiful shots possible. She never had to say a word, never had to display much emotion. In fact the main part of her job in the movie is to walk. Yes, like doing the catwalk, wearing clothes which look gorgeous on her gorgeous figure, in immaculate makeup and hair, and just... walk... walk ... walk all the time whenever the camera's on her. If she's not walking, she's doing some pretty posing (of course, the posing would be made to be like part of the script to mean something else, like dancing with her husband's picture, etc.) Even the director said in the ""Making of"" that when he first met Monica, he immediately thought she'd be perfect for such a movie he wanted to make. Its like seeing the most beautiful girl for the first time and wanting to make the most gorgeous sculpture out of her in rock and stone. I'm sorry but I have to say, Monica was only his muse. And nothing else... I can hardly see the talent in her. All I saw were great shots of her doing what she's been trained to do best (in her modelling career) -- making poses (sometimes in the nude, which I think is put there strategically to pull in the male population to go to the cinemas to watch this), and catwalking. I'd have to see her in another movie with more talking and emoting in a wider range of style. And I will look out for it. My mind can be changed, you know :)",1077235200,2,4302,4.4399494310998735
1311169,3,B00003CXXY,"If it wasn't for Ms Belluci this movie wouldn't even deserve one star.
In the end, after watching this disappointing movie, what remains in the memory, is the girl, beautiful to the max. If I waited to the end it was only to see the lady walk by one more time.
What a waste of extras and money, I guess. This film had too high expectations, but the director needs to go back to school and do his homework.
By the way, what is the point of showing so vulgar scenes and language?
This is a vulgar video clip with a gorgeous woman in it.",1074816000,2,534,4.095238095238095
1311170,4,B00003CXXY,"A little rawer edge to this movie than other Tornatore's movies.  In it he explores the fascinations of a young boy, Renato, as he tries to find the secret to the mysterious life of the town beauty.  Tornatore draws the viewer into Fascist Italy, and what some persons had to do to get by under totalitarian rule.  Malena moves from being an object of beauty to an object of derision in the aftermath of the war, as the townspeople maliciously turn on her.  Not sure what point Tornatore was trying to make, as the movie is told almost completely from the viewpoint of the youthful narrator.  Monica Belluci exudes a lustful eroticism that could have easily devolved into soft porn, but Tornatore deftly handles such scenes, making her all the more compelling, as we witness her vulnerability. It is quite a step from ""Cinema Paradiso.""",1071187200,3,836,4.7379310344827585
1311171,3,B00003CXXY,"It begins with a stunning walk along and proud as she moves, morbid vision, Que culo! And suddenly, Renato's blood changes tide towards his low head, and Bang, the very first reaction of sexual excitement, now a teen who begins his coming of age quite desperately for sex, the more he sees and learns about Malena, the more the sexual appetite for her becomes a tender and true love never to be forgotten. It continues as he spies her beauty at night trough a window dressed only with a black underwear, she cleans the floor in dancing into remembrance, and suddenly, her blouse falls down and Wow, the most beautiful and voluptuous breast ever seen is hang loose, the poor boy can't control his agitated breeding and heart pounding, Amoroso is caught. From now on, the teen will center his world around this haunting woman, untouchable and enchanting, a Goddess, (Pobre Amoroso, desarrollara un compulsivo masturbatorio; pero quien le puede culpar?). Lusted by every man and hated by every woman in this Hell Town, Malena is alone, but behind her is little Renato, unseen yet close, this is a love story between a woman and a man who will never get to know each other, Buena fortuna Miss Malena, she glimpses back to the teen, an smile shows and fates away quickly, this are all the words Renato will ever say to her, then she goes away.
Set in World War II in a small Italian town by the sea, Malena is a dear telling of adolescence blossoming into manhood with all the bitter sweet memories, both funny and dramatic, ending in a live time idealistic canvas. Giuseppe Tornatore narrates this piece with a very evident closeness to his own experiences and heart, and this is what saves the film from being a corny story of coming of age. Delicate and tender, with a kinky humor, Malena begins as a sexual comedy and changes in the most naturally way into a drama of miss judgment and envy of internal and external beauty, leaving a nostalgic taste of past ghosts. Very much criticized in its native Italy, (for whatever reason), the film is not about social exposure, this happens to be the setting, the movie is about young love in a Small Town Big Hell, and those rotten minds that forced this honorable woman to turn into a what the envious wanted to be. So, when her husband surprisingly comes back from War where he was presumed dead, he finds himself as Malena, alone and attacked by those disposable town characters, only Renato helped and told the truth, as he was silently saying good bye to Malena when she was living the town by that cruel social expulsion. The main problem is that the scrip turns weak at some moments, and doesn't let the story develops in a much sharp and complete way, fortunately Tornatore directs the film in a personal approach, utilizing his characters to charm effortlessly, maintaining the narration fresh and moving with a pace that allows the events to be exposed elegantly, Malena is a good film, but not as good as Tornatore's best pictures (like Cinema Paradiso or The legend of 1900). The main actors are perfect in their roles (excellent casting), Giuseppe Sulfaro as Renato, conveys his characters with grace and tenderness, Malena, portrayed by the always amazing Monica Bellucci, gives a simple accurate and beautiful performance, her talent and beauty was exactly what the character needed, only an Italian actress could have fit that role (Italian Woman are unique) and Monica covers all the angles adding voluptuous turns of fragile state of woman. The great Ennio Morricone delivers another fine soundtrack, making more emotional the key moments and the not so emotional ones, and Lajos Koltai photography magnifies those Italian landscapes with a deep understanding of the story colors. Like with The Legend of 1900 and Cinema Paradiso, Malena was cut for American theaters, only because of a faster pacing and censorship of the delicate nude scenes, (again repressed minds takes on stupid decisions), the European un-mutilated version is superior, with bigger and better extras on it's DVD, but region 1 and region 2 versions (PAL 2) have both the advantage of great visual and optimal sound transferring. Finally, the greatest quality of this film is something that has become more and more rare in worldwide films, it has unforgettable characters, they will stay with you for a very long time.

1311172,4,B00003CXXY,"I really liked this film, and still do. The plot is well depicted from the other reviews here, so there's no point in going on. I'll just say that this is a film that stands out from the rest of the tripe being made today thanks to it's high level of filmmaking.
A lot is explored in this film, and all is explored with feeling. Set in a small Sicilian Village during WW2, this film goes into social opinion, sexual awakening, and poverty. There is much heart warming humor, as there is down right heart wrenching moments that can bring one to tears. The first few times I watched this movie, I definetly succumbed to the kleenex box.
The musical score is beautiful. It has an authentic Italian feel to it, and works very effectively with the film. It also can't hurt that the film is exceptionally shot. The cinematography is great.
The acting is also good. Giuseppe Sulfaro (playing the young teenage boy Renato in the film) is awesome. His soulful expressions and senstive performance does nothing but upscale the movie. The drop everything and watch beautiful Monica Bellucci (Malena) is wonderful. She barely utters a sound throughout the coarse of the film, and yet her expressions speak volumes that a thousand words never could.
Unfortunately, the film isn't absolutely perfect. It's great, but there are a few misses. The script lacks originality, and I felt the director could've delved a bit bellow the surface of the film's themes.
But, don't let that stop you,what this film may lack in depth of meaning, it more than makes up for in it's emotional content. I mean how many movie are perfect?Not very many, but this is one of those movies that I guarantee you will like. Anyone who appreciates great cinema will find a spot in their hearts for this gem from the heart of Italy.",1067644800,4,1790,4.667721518987341
1311173,3,B00003CXXY,"""Malena"" is a film, to me, that has all the right parts but still falls short of greatness. ""Cinema Paradiso"" (also written and directed by Tornatore) is one of my favorite films, ""Malena"" does not capture the audience nearly as beautifully as ""Cinema"" did. Monica Bellucci is without question the perfect actress for this role and her beauty is by itself a character in the film. But her performance seems a bit off. I would place the blame, so to speak, on Tornatore though not Bellucci. Her character seems too distant and that failed to really grab me. The cinematography, score and beautiful Sicilian scenery make this an absolutely breathtaking film, similar to ""Cinema."" So all in all this is certainly a film worth viewing and definitely has the potential to really move you, however it did not move me.",1067299200,,811,4.8

1311246,4,B00003CXXY,"Malena is much like the director's heralded Cinema Paridiso.  They are both Italian period films seen through the eyes of a kid who comes of age.  In Malena, our hero, the kid, falls in love with a beautiful married woman during World War II.  He never talks to her, but watches her intensely.  The kid is so fascinated by the woman that he becomes a peeping tom, but in doing so becomes her apologist when she gets a bad reputation.
There are some funny political comments in that his father has no trouble comically beating him around a little, but his father is also an ardent anti-fascist.  An equivalent American film would have the beating father a nazi sympathizer.  The movie changes gears from comedy to drama and it does so as the war gets nearer to Italy, but it never seems false. The overall feel of the feel of the film combines the rare quality of being gently erotic and sweet.  If you like Cinema Paridiso, this is also worth seeing.",1061164800,,950,4.488372093023256
1311247,5,B00003CXXY,"This movie is simply fascinating.  I was introduced to Monica Bellucci upon seeing this movie and from then on, I've been looking after her next movie projects.  I think she could never acted her character more perfectly than she did.  She was resonating, appealing, and most of all very natural.  She does not really exert effort in acting her character.  It's like she has lived the life of Malena.
  One thing I can commend to this film is the way the storytelling was presented.  Although everything was told on the point of view of the boy, Renato, the story revolves around the troubles and mishaps of Malena.  I got really mad with the people who were envied and tried to destroy her.  Yet I was touched to what Renato did because in the end, he was the only person who helped Malena redeem herself, by reuniting the couple.
  Overall, the movie is more than five stars.  Even if you're not a foreign film enthusiast, this film is very much enjoyable.  I recommend it to everyone.  It's fun, melodramatic and sexy combined in one movie.",1057708800,2,1043,4.592391304347826
1311248,5,B00003CXXY,"Although in reality, this is a 4 star movie, when you tear it apart-the script is average, and there are too many scenes with the title character (Malena) walking through the town, getting looked over by men and boys of all ages. But I still can't give this film four stars. Why?It's such a deeply affecting and touching story-for me. I mean, this movie really struck a chord with me. The acting is subtle, and superb. The cinematography is very pleasing to the eyes, and it combines comedic elements with events so harsh they drove me to tears. No really, I was just hysterical, I literally could not watch, it hurt so much(I'm not gonna tell you at what parts though).So, here's a quick layout of the plot-It's set in small Italian village in 1940's Italy. And all around, all the talk is of the beautiful Malena(Monica Bellucci).Women do nothing but gloss her over with nasty gossip, because, duh they're jealous-She's young,beautiful beyond all comprehension, and all their husbands worship her. And men see her as nothing more than a mere sex object. The whole town talks about how she has all these lovers and is a complete whore with zero moral conscience. In actuality, she's actually a faithful, down to earth woman who does nothing more than  take care of her elderly father, and sit at home, awaiting her husband's(who's off at war)return. A scene which shows Malena dancing to a record with her husbands picture in the privacy of her own home works very effectively, not to mention offers a glimpse into her private life, one which you seldom get to see. It's all about what Malena is on the surface. You get to tell for yourself what Malena is really like. Anyway, so the short and short of it, is that what every one says about Malena is total bull, and depite her awe-inspiring appearance, leads a very lonely life. Women let their jealousy eat them alive, and don't want anything to do with Malena, and men do want something to do with Malena, but that only something is sex. Throughout what appears to be a few years, Malena experiences tradgedy of all sorts-her father is killed in a local bombing,she gets word that her husband died too, women at the market refuse to sell her food at the market, resulting Malena become the very thing she was once so unjustly accused of. And not to give away too much,but this results in that very scene, which is both haunting, shocking, and heartbraking. I swear, it tore the s&%t out of me.if that scene doesn't do something to you,stop reading this review right now, and go get a check up at the doctor's to see if you have a heart. This results in Malena leaving the town, and, soon you have the ending, which is both heartbraking,fragile, and true to life. It wasn't something blown out of proportion, or sugary sweet, it was just perfect. Fresh from a sobfest, I cried once more , but this time because I was so touched. But,let it be said, that Malena is not the main character in the movie, she is rather the base of the movie, what holds everything together, she's the theme, not the character. The main character is Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro).A young adolescent boy who falls in young lust with Malena, her mystery+beauty. Malena soon becomes the object of his every desire-She's in every daydream, every single minute of his day, and he follows her everywhere she goes, including her own home. He is the only one who actually knows the truth about Malena, all that happened to her, and is the only one who is able to see through the web of lies created by the town folks. Giuseppe turned in his role with poignancy,innocence, and maturity. May it also be said, that Malena(Monica Bellucci) barely speaks throughout the whole film, maybe in what seems to be 1 or 2 short scenes, and even then she only says a few words. And must I say, Bellucci played her role off her perfectly. Her face and eyes, expressions,actions spoke volumes and emotions, that I don't think words would've been able to convey. Just by showing a quick shot of her eyes, I was able to see, and almost feel all the pain,lonliness, and fear inside her. She's a gem, at least in this film. She's subtle,powerful, and fearless. One thing I also loved about this movie, was how little things were so close to life. For example,most townspeople aren't very attractive, and that's because they're not meant to be. I hate it when there's a movie full of beautiful people, you know it's not like that in real life. I loved it how Renato's (Giuseppe Sulfaro's) light acne wasn't covered up. Most every boy I can think of his age has some pimples! I loved it how Malena, despite her awe inspiring beauty, looked like a real woman, and not a cookie-cutter barbie!!She had curves, you know what I mean??I just loved it how the director kept all of life's imperfections in full view and didn't gloss them over with Hollywood sheen. It makes for a more effective and realistic film. In conclusion, I'd like to say, that I don't know if my review was helpful or not, but that it's been a long time since I've seen a movie with such depth and poignancy, one that touched me so deeply.

1311251,2,B00003CXXY,"I rented this movie mainly because I loved the director's previous film, ""Cinema Paradiso.""  Unfortunately ""Malena"" is, despite the gorgeous Monica Belluci and all that beautiful cinematography (the only department in which it surpasses ""Cinema Paradiso""), disappointing.
This film's main problem is its repetitiveness: we are treated to, over and over, shots of Belucci walking through the city in some stunningly tight, sexy-yet-elegant dress and men of all ages salivating at her, understandably.  Then all the fantasy scenes of what goes on inside a pubescent boy's imagination when confronted with a woman of Belluci's sexual majesty.  Then all the lustful gossip of the men, and the envious bile of the women.  Then more shots of the 13 (?) year old protagonist tailing Belucci, spying on her at home, defending her by playing nasty little tricks on townspeople who are badmouthing her...  Cute stuff once or twice, but after about the eighth time you just want to hit the fast forward button!
This film simply doesn't build smoothly, but rather just piles on more and more of the same; plotwise, the few turning points in the film come much too late, too slowly, few and far in between, and are more anti-climactic than anything.
One nice thing about this film, though, is that the director at least avoids the more typical Hollywood-style outcomes in favor of the less expected, probably less enjoyable, but definitely more realistic/authentic ones.  The love- and lust-struck protagonist never gets anywhere near his object of desire, and nobody rides off into the happily ever after.
All in all, this one's a bit of a dud.  Nice film for a slow day if you want to take in some beautiful scenery, female and otherwise, but not much more.",1041724800,10,1746,5.0
1311252,5,B00003CXXY,"This movie isn't one that should be taken for granted. These kinds of movies don't come along so often. The performances are subtle, but nevertheless powerful. Infact, the main characters barely speak, and yet they are able to leave a profound effect on you. Monica Bellucci, is a wonderful,talented actress, and her performance as Malena, a stunningly beautiful woman in a small Italian village during the second World War. Women are fiercly jealous of Malena, and men look upon her as nothing more than a sex object. Malena overcomes much sadness and lonliness, but in the end,is able to find solid ground once again. Giuseppe Sulfaro plays Renato, a young teen boy whose lust for Malena proves to be much more than a childish crush throughout the movie. This is a movie which is heartbraking and hilarious at the same time, making you laugh through your tears. It's sad that this movie didn't get as much acclaim as it deserved, because everyone should see this movie, there's something wondeful here for everyone. It's also nice to see a movie where there isn't any of the ""Hollywood"" presense. The people look like real people, not barbie and ken cutouts,and the story is real, it's no fairy tale,and it's not a predictable movie.

This movie walks away with you,and lives on in you, evoking a million different emotions, whether they be love,hatred,sadness,rage-this movie leaves you inside out. Ignore the fact that this is a forign movie, or that it did not really recieve much acclaim in america. The fact is, is that we have been brainwashed into watching films which sell good, which recieve millions of awards, and that feature the world's leading stars. But ignore what you feel, all for this movie, because trust me, it is up there with foreign films like ""Life Is Beautiful"".There is no gloss, no hype, and no essence of sugar which seems to cover up all movies which possibly could be great. This movie is ll real. If an adolescent boy has some acne, it doesn't get covered up. The village people are not made to look like studs, they are meant to look like primative villagers in world war two, in sicily. Malena, around whom the story revolves, is an absolutely breathtaking woman. Beautiful,voluptious,stunning in every single way. And even Malena with all her grace,and outer-worldly beauty manages to look like a real woman, and not a cookie-cutter hollywood actress, one who has been primped,covered up, and bleached into a barbie doll. Monica Bellucci, as Malena, gives an amazing performance. With practically no words,no tears, just by looking into her deep eyes, you are able to feel all the pain,the hurt, and the love this woman has. The story starts out with a young boy, Renato, and his adolescent lust for Malena. Malena, with all her beauty, stirs up nasty rumors, and gossip among the villagers. The women feel a dark jealousy towards Malena,and the men look upon her as nothing more than a sex object. In truth, Malena is a faithful wife, awaiting her husband's return, and a loving daughter, who takes care of her sick,elderly father. Soon, Malena's husband is killed at war, and villagers are no kinder. Instead, she is accused of adultery,forced into sex,and not even sold food in their local marketplace. In the end, Malena has no choice but to become what she was once accused of. I will not give away the end, all I will say is that it is a beautiful ending, not perfect, but that is part of the beauty. When you see the movie, you will know what I mean. And throughout Malena's trials and tribulations, Renato sees it all. Spying on Malena, following her. In a town, where no one seems to have a heart, and no one wants to understand, Renato, stands above all. He has his own heart, his own sense of understanding, he is not at all affected by the evil village people, he is a mature boy, with a soul bigger and warmer than any grown-up could ever have. And even with all the drama in the movie, sharp, warm humor is constantly present. The performances are amazing, Renato was BORN for this role, he was BORN to act. Monica Bellucci is a wonderful actress. In acting, just like in singing, sometimes, less is much more. She pulled this difficult role off with ease, and I could not imagine anyone who would be able to BE Malena.
See this movie,if you like good movies, then this movie is not for you. If you like great movies, hard to say. But if you love movies that are real,raw, made with passion,dedication, and feeling, than perhaps ,just perhaps this is for you.",1039305600,4,3330,4.617200674536257

This movie has everything that is important in a Greek Tragedy. How nice to learn from a movie. Additionally, the cinematography, casting, and understanding of the Sicilian culture are spot on as well.",1030838400,4,346,5.087719298245614
1311311,4,B00003CXXY,"This beautiful film by Tornatore of ""Cinema Paradiso"" tells about Malena, an extremely beautiful woman whose husband went to war just after two weeks of their marriage, and Renato, a young boy, who appoints himself as protector of Malena without her knowing.  Everything is described from the viewpoint of Renato, who keeps on watching over her and the men coming around her, but the film's point is not what you might call ""guilty pleasure.""  It is a coming-of-age story of an Italian boy living at the time of WW2, and you can say that the film, though it belongs to definitely Monoca Bellucci, is about him and his growing pain as a youth.
The story, based on a short, nostalgic story by Luciano Vincenzoni, is very simple, and director made it his own by casting Monica Bellucci, whose beauty is understandably compared to jewels, as Malena, who has to do what she had to do to survive as a widow in a local town in Sicily.  She gradually 'falls"" into a status of prostitute, in a brothel for Nati officers, and after the war, she is chased away from the town by womenfolks there by the most relentless way (this painful part, I am sure, can never be played by Hollywood counterparts except, perhaps, Ms Streep or Ms Lang).
However, Renato, who passionately loves her, but feels his weak position as a mere boy without power, has been watching over her.  He loves her favorite music too, (a romantic song ""Ma L'Amore No""),; he even steals her underwear (which his father finds, oh no); but he knows all he can do is watch until the last moment he helps her redemption by giving up his dream of making her his own, by ... well, you must see this melodramatic development for yourself.
There are three virtures in Malena, all of which are extremely beautiful and breathtaking.  One is, without doubt, Monica Bellucci with perfect costumes that stand up from 100 miles away.  Another is mesmerizing music of veteran composer Ennio Morricone, whose score here reminds us of the fact that he created may times such fantastic melodies in his long career.  The last one is its cinematography by Hungarian Lajos Koltai (""Conficence"" or ""Mephisto"") whose magical photography nicely captures the beauty of the Sicilan Island and, of course, Malena, unforgettable heroine of the film.
Probably for non-Italian audience like me, the film looks uneven, like a rollercoaster of (too much) pathos and laughter, but without laughs and tears, what is the point of watching Italian movies?  And the last moments of the film, when Malena is reduced to ordinariness so that she is finally accepted by townspeople, looks unconvincing to me simply because even in plain clothes Bellucci is too beautiful.  But you will forget about these things before the beauty of the whole film.
Finally, I end this review by quoting the message the director gave in the booklet sold in Japan.  This may help understand the film more, I hope:  ""I would like for people to walk away from the film and wonder -- is it possible that someone could have loved me that much, and I never knew it?""  Giuseppe Tornatore.",1025308800,7,3079,4.745318352059925
1311312,3,B00003CXXY,"The only beautiful part of this film is Monica Bellucci.  She is absolutely stunning and her face and body spoke volumes.  Not much of a story as the focus was on what an impact Malena (Monica Bellucci) had on Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro).  Such prevalent circumstances (where a young boy of 12 or 13 years of age infatuated with a married women whose curves and moves are ""talk of the town"") dwell in most villages. What really disappointed me was that Ennio Morricone's musical score did not make a mark.  There were so many beautiful scenes where I am sure he could have flaunted his brilliance in composition as he did in Cinema Paradiso (still one of my all time favourite).",1023667200,,676,4.608333333333333
1311313,2,B00003CXXY,"Yet another middlebrow cookie-cutter pseudo-art film from Miramax taking on the usual easy targets like Italian fascism. Lush production values are wasted on a practically non-existent plot, a repulsive male main character, and a female lead who remains a cipher throughout the entire film. The male lead's masturbatory obession with Malena is simply embarassing rather than amusing. Male viewers who rent this merely to satisfy their own obsession with Monica Belluci will be equally disappointed in the small number of ""good parts"" worth fast forwarding to (what few there are is the only reason this film gets two stars).",1022457600,4,624,5.313131313131313
1311314,5,B00003CXXY,"I suspect this film will bring back memories of every male's first lustful crush.  This film, if anything, exhibits how boys are plowed down by burgeoning sexual desire at the beginning of their teen years and the onset of puberty.  Renato, a 12-year-old Italian villager spies Malena one day and is instantly smitten with an infatuation that carries him through some of Italy's darkest days--World War II.
The setting of this film against the war is clever on the part of the writers because it gave them a point of comoparison:  though the Facist party is very active in Renato's seaside village, he scarcely seems to notice the military parades, decreasing food supplies, and Nazi flags that wave after the German occupation.  All of that rich detail is secondary to his feelings for the older, elusive Malena.  If that doesn't demonstrate the strength of a young man's desire, I don't know what will.
Upon first seeing Malena, Renato begins masturbating and never stops.  But this movie doesn't fall into ""that"" category--it's better, more literary, more expertly written and directed.  There's a strong message about the dangers of gossip and rumors, and prejudices against single, beautiful women.  The exquisitely beautiful Malena is hated instantly by local women because of the passion she inflames in the men.  When news arrives that Malena's husband, Nino, has died in Mussolini's war, the viciousness only intensifies.  They refuse to sell her edible food, scandalize her name and ruin her chances to support herself in any respectable way.  She's forced to become what everyone pegged her for all along:  a prostititute.  Through it all, Renato admires her from afar (and through the windows). while he grows up in the midst of war and chaos, all the while maintaining a beautiful innocence not easy to come by in a time of war.",1019865600,4,1841,4.99672131147541
1311315,5,B00003CXXY,"A beautiful portrayal of not only the coming-of-age of a young boy, but also an interesting look into the period in which the film represents.  It was one of those movies that was so interesting, yet hurt so much to watch as the story just kept getting more intense and heartbreaking.  Much in the same way that ""the Talented Mr. Ripley"" was both fascinating and devastating, Malena definitely makes you sit very still until the credits roll.",1018828800,3,442,4.7272727272727275
1311316,3,B00003CXXY,"If I could give 3 and a half stars I would, as although this movie is pretty good, it's not quite worthy of a 4. I won't bore you with the story, as you can read that in numerous other reviews. It's an impressive film debut by Giuseppe Sulfaro, who gives a mature performance as the boy who is secretly in love with Malena. Monica Bellucci is also good although for a lot of the film she doesn't actually say that much, the part often requiring her to simply walk past lots of leering boys/men. The expression on her face alone often speaks volumes though. There is one scene which was no doubt demanding for Monica, and is quite hard to watch, and if you haven't yet seen Malena, you'll know exactly what scene I mean when you get to it. There are also several comedy moments in the film, one of my favourites being when Renato (the boy) is found asleep by his dad wearing a pair of knickers on his head!. Another is when Renato's mum thinks her son is possessed by the devil, and the dad points out ... Also worth mentioning is the cinematography, which is absolutely brilliant. Something I would of liked to have seen in the film (and I'm not necessarily saying it would of made it better), is Malena and the boy developing some kind of friendship and repsect for each other. Though the boy clearly looks out for her, she never knows this, and they don't even speak to each other until the very end of the movie.
Overall then, a reasonably enjoyable movie with 2 good lead performances (particularly the boy), a good music score (Morricone), some often funny moments, and stunning cinematography. Just don't expect it to match the likes of Cinema Paradiso or Life is beautiful.",1014681600,3,1680,4.47557003257329

The movie entraped me to the point I found myself along the Renato's clan,dreaming while staring at Malena, providing me with strong sensations of Youth drunkness; this kind of sensations I didn't have since my teenage.

I gathered from the conversations that they didn't like it due to the unfair prejudices that Malena suffered throughout and the fact that the victimizers (the townspeople) didn't get their ""comeuppance"". Although I do agree that (by American standards of filmaking)it would have been nice to see those nasty townspeople ""get theirs"", that did not ruin my appreciation for the film. Having suffered unfair prejudisms/gossips in my own life (haven't we all at one point?)I experienced that sometimes the culprits really don't get their comeuppance (unfair--yes, but it's a reality). Maintaining/regaining your dignity is the only way to combat that. Vengence only sours things more and Malena did not fall into that pit. Through the eyes of the boy, we saw that she truly is beautiful in more ways than the physical.",1010793600,3,932,5.098039215686274

The acting was great; Monica Bellucci is perfectly cast in it for obvious reasons, but also shows good acting skills during the most tragic scenes of the film. Music and photography are excellent.
The reason I could barely make through this movie is that it does a very good job at showing the worst characteristics of Italian people (unlike ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin,"" which shows the best aspects of my fellow countrymen). Should anyone think that things are different now in Southern Italy, let me warn them that the situation is only slightly better.

1311408,5,B00003CXXY,"I've watched this movie twice already and think that it's simply brilliant. The acting is first-rate and the story just draws you in right from the start.
The movie is set during WWII in Sicily and is basically about the cruelty and social prejudice brought on by feelings of jealously and lust among mankind. In this case, the victim is the beautiful Malena who's the envy of the women in her town, the lust of the men, and the subject of cruel gossip by everyone. Her only ""fault"" is being born beautiful. When her husband is believed to have been killed in the war, she tries to look for a decent job to support herself but nobody would offer her one out of sheer prejudice. Even her father believes in the rumours and disowns her. The women, jealous of her, and the men, who couldn't obtain her, continue to spread malicious gossips all over town about her having an affair with so-and-so. Finally, driven by hunger and sheer destitute, she succumbs to using her body in exchange for food and money. All this while, a young boy (Renata) who thinks himself in love with Malena, tries to protect her from the malicious gossips. He does them secretly, so Malena never knows. Scenes involving Renata are usually very funny and provide plenty of laughs. After the war, the women get their revenge on Malena in the most horrible way, and that scene is painful to watch. How Malena picks up her life after that, you must watch the movie to find out. The last 5 minutes of the movie provides a wonderful closure and is worth the price of the ticket alone, so to speak.
Great storyline apart, the beautiful and exquisite-looking Malena (played by Monica Bellucci) provides plenty of eye-candy (for the guys). For the girls, watch out for the appearance of the very handsome and dashing Lieutenant Cadel (played by Marcello Catalano) in his smart uniform, who alas, only appears in 3 scenes.
In my opinion, this movie would have won (and deservedly so) the Oscar for Best Foreign Picture it was nominated for, had it not been for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", another great movie.",1009324800,,2078,4.664850136239782
1311409,4,B00003CXXY,"Finally, a really good Italian film of modern times.  I would not rave about Monica Belucci's beauty; at first it did not even ocured to me that she was supposed to be beautiful. She resembles Isabelle Adjani a lot.  What knocked me out were the looks of the dilapidated Sicilian town of Siracusa where the film was shot.  It's not really a remote village but rather quite a decent size town; it would be considered a big city if it were here, in America.  But this is beside the point.
I come to realize that it is a long-standing tradition of Italian intellectuals to mock Sicily for its backward attitudes, and probably deceivingly so.  Things must have changed since then, as it is unimaginable now, at least at the surface, such a barbarian, ancient and brutal attitude toward a woman.  It is heartbreaking to watch how the sanctimonious townfolks push the poor widow into prostitution and then outcasting her in the most horrendous way.  Somehow I am disappointed, though, that only a reappearance of her husband redeems her as a woman of dignity and admits her back into society.  I find it an utterly humiliating idea - did she not despise her torturers?  Was she really seeking their admitting her among themselves?  What it her husband would have indeed been killed?  I also wonder how someone could come back to a place that once treated her so brutally.  Perhaps it's an Italian syndrome called campanilismo, which means that a person has an inborn bond with a place of his birth.
Overall, I would rate it as a success of the Italian cinema, although it's not as sophisticated as works of masters of the past and is rather simplistic in a presentation of the story, i.e. through the impression of an adolescent boy.  In some respect, the movie is secondary to Amarcord and others in the methods it employs.",1008633600,4,1818,4.679245283018868
1311410,4,B00003CXXY,"I had few hours to kill at my friends place as he was eating dinner so I decided to give Malena my full attention.  The movie was gripping, as it was one of those stories where you want to know the ending. In addition, you want something to happen and you sit there wondering if it will, I'll let you figure out what I'm talking about.
Was it good, was it worth our time?  That all depends on what you are looking for.  If you want a comedy, Malena could pass as one as long as you have a broad sense of humor.  If you want a drama Malena can be that too, it can even make you cry if you are too sensitive.  Want a simple good story, it is there, unpredictability, yes, Italian culture, all the way.

All in all, I think that this movie is all about how cruel, superficial and misguided people can be sometimes.  Perception is everything and most characters of this film could not see past Malena's exterior, which you can judge by the box cover.
To sum up, see this movie if you want to see a good story, but don't expect it to impress you... unless you can relate to the story or you feel like viewing a bit of stimulating erotica.",1008288000,2,1133,4.122727272727273

1311412,5,B00003CXXY,"After an unsuccessful foray into Hollywood, Tornatore goes back to his roots and does what he knows best: a coming of age movie.  With 'Cinema Paradiso', Tornatore helped build the kingdom of the Weinstein Brothers also known as Miramax and it is only proper that he received from them the financial support to make this film in his homeland.  Many years have passed since the masterpiece, however with Malena, he shows that he hasn't skipped a beat.
Tornatore definitely has an acute sense for beauty.  The casting is top notch.  The beauty of Monica Bellucci definitely complements the sweeping cinematography.  Every frame is breathtaking, the Italian seaside will never look any better.  Even if the movie fails to deliver anything else, the cinematography is worth your money.  I am not sure that it did not deserve the Academy Award it was nominated for in 2000.
As in Cinema Paradiso, this film deals with a boy's coming of age.  His infatuation with the new village beauty, Malena, becomes the fuel of his libido.  He painfully observes how the widow is chastised by the whole village after she loses her husband in the war.  Powerless, he witnesses her agony and suffers along with her.
As in Tornatore's previous cinematic efforts (Cinema Paradiso, the Starmaker), the social commentary is very apparent.  He contrasts the ugliness of a close-minded town that passes judgments a little too quickly with Malena's passive beauty.  He would even goes as far as associating it with the loser mentality.  This is no more evident than in three different but similar scenes: when the fascists , the Germans and subsequently the Americans come to town.  Each is greeted with so much fanfare that you have to wonder if this is anything but mockery.
This is no Cinema Paradiso, and in a way I am glad it isn't.  With Malena, Tornatore proves that he still has a few good movies left in him.  One wonders how does a director come back after Cinema Paradiso, however, this should be enough to cast your doubts away.",1005609600,3,2013,4.825072886297376

The movie tells the platonic love between 12 years old Renato that falls for beautiful Malena - the town most attractive woman. The one who men admire and women envy and hate. It is told from his point of view and with the background of the last years of Mussolini rule and the first years of WW2.
The story is beautiful tale that mixes up the sad reality with the boy's imaginary dreams.
It runs between cruel gossip and people lies and the true that lies underneath and is seen only to the eyes of the innocent boy.
I felt so involved in the film that I wanted to stop it sometimes and rewrite the scenes as it was so painful. The balance between the innocent boy point of view, the painful beauty of Malena and the evil and vicious of the village people is treated by the director (Giuseppe Tornatore) very gently so after all you left over with bitter-sweat taste but with the powerful emotional experience.
Monica Bellucci  is amazing as sensual Malena and Giuseppe Sulfaro is unforgettable as Renato, the 12 years old boy. Giuseppe Tornatore is a great fairy tales weaver and he follow the same great story of Cinema Paradiso with this great new love story.

1311415,4,B00003CXXY,"The thing that makes this film work is the range of moods/emotions that are covered.  Comedy, nostalgia, eroticism and drama all have their turn, and have been blended into a shocking but suprisingly cohesive, whole.
Monica Bellucci, while not presented any real acting challenges, plays her role well, and is appropriately cast as the target of a young boys fantasies.  I've heard (and it's obvious in viewing the film) that several minutes have been deleted from the original version.  It is plain to see that the censorship is the result of concerns over the American market.  I can assume that the missing footage shows the erotic dreams of the boy, something that could have hurt the commercial success of the movie stateside.  How sad that art has to be mangled in order to placate a small percentage of backwards thinkers.  As good as this film is, I'm certain that the full version would be more cohesive.",1001980800,2,913,4.82051282051282
1311494,5,B00003CXXY,"I have to confess that I'm a fan of Tornatore...Nuovo Cinema Paradiso...La leggenda del pianista sull'oceano (The legend of 1900)...Stanno tutti bene...and now, Malna...
Not only do his films portray great human stories, with greatly developed characters, but he also uses the talent of people like cinematographer Lajos Koltai (Sunshine, Guernica, Mephisto), composer Ennio Morricone (too many great film scores to list here!). And now...now he adds this collaboration with Mnica Bellucci...
A great story about a boy, Renato, coming of age in a little Italian town during WWII. All the men go head over heels for Malna, the gorgeous, melancholic widow, but only Renato sees her for more than just a sexual godess. He fantasizes about romatic interludes with her and goes out of his way to follow her, spy on her...just to be close to her...
This is a great film...you don't want to miss it...!",1001548800,,895,5.054054054054054
1311495,4,B00003CXXY,"WARNING: this dvd version of MALENA is CENSURED!.....
10 or 15 mins have been deleted. and it's a shame! STORY: Malena (portrayed by monica bellucci),is the facination of a small town...she becomes the subject of increasingly malicious gossip among the lustful townsmen & their jealous wives...
her secret admirer renato amoroso (giuseppe sulfaro),dreams & spies on her.

THE CINEMATOGRAPHY:
hungaryan cinematographer LAJOS KOLTAI (previously worked for tornatore's ""la leggenda del pianista sull'oceano"" aka ""legend of 1900""),& does here again, a fantastic job.""Malena"" might even be the best work he's done in his career.every shots are memorable.
THE MUSIC:
the exellent Italian composer ENNIO Morricone (who recently composed the score of ""VATEL"" & ""RIPLEY'S GAME""),does not disapoint!...the principal theme of ""Malena"" is a reminisence of tornatore's ""L'uomo delle stelle"" (the star maker)mixed with the melodies morricone wrote for ADRIAN LYNE's ""LOLITA""..in other words..a pure musical pleasure!!!...
THE ACTING:
- MONICA BELLUCCI...this italian actress has an incredible presence, her beauty and grace are the equivalant of the french actress ISABELLE ADJANI ( who btw is finaly making her come back with ""La Repentie""...)...not many actresses have the guts to play in such powerful & disturbing scenes such as the last 15 mins of ""MALENA"", & demonstrates monica's undeniable acting talent.....
-GIUSEPPE SULFARO...""Malena"" marks his acting debut,and so far he is a promissing actor. his character, Renato amoroso, is a vicious version of cinema paradiso's Salvatore.
DIRECTING:
-Italian director GIUSEPPE TORNATORE is a genius,pure and simple,all of his films are a work of art, and MALENA is no exeption,he is without a doubt the most talented italian director of the moment.

-an exellent transfer, crystal clear image and 2:35:1 format.
-the features:tv spots,theatrical trailer & a making of Malena are available..the making of, shows some behind the scenes footages and interviews of giuseppe & bellucci.
SUGGESTIONS: buy or rent, but be sure not to miss a film called ""UNA PURA FORMALITA"" (""a pure formality"") also directed by giuseppe tornatore & staring Gerard depardieu & roman polanski,This french-italian film is one of the most impressive thriller ever made (along with MEMENTO & GARDE A VUE).
also,the french film L'APPARTEMENT (staring monica bellucci & her husband vincent cassel) directed by gilles mimouni is a MUST!!(if you liked memento, run lola run, Rashomon..etc.or none linear films) than L'appartement is for you!.
finally, monica bellucci & vincent cassel are also playing in gaspar noe's latest film ""irreversible"" (gaspar noe aka the genius behind ""I STAND ALONE"")..and are also apearing in ""BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF""...",1001203200,3,2956,5.600446428571429
1311496,5,B00003CXXY,"Malena is truly a great film.  It works on so many levels.  I have a relative who doesn't usually like foreign films but had to admit this is a great one.  Its funny, its sad and it has a message.  The story of the beautiful Malena is one that is heart-breaking.  Malena is a beautiful woman whose husband is fighting in World War II and is left alone in this town.  She is subjected to constant rumours and harassment by the men and women in their village.
Renato is the young boy obsessed with her.  He is also the only person who knows the truth about her and knows she doesn't do the things people say she does.  Malena wasn't dating everyone, she was sewing for people into the night, carrying her husband's picture and dancing to their favorite music.  The sad thing is that Malena has to become what everyone had labeled her once word got back that her husband was killed.  Women refused to sell her food and she had to sleep with men to survive.  There is a scene towards the end that really upset me.  This movie shows how rotten both the men and the women were to her.  Malena shows how dangerous lies and assumptions are to a person's standing in their community and their own self-respect.
Malena is a very funny movie at times.  There are scenes with Renato that made me laugh out loud.  However, its a film that goes deeper than many out there.  I would have to say this has become one of my all-time favorites.  A beautiful, thought-provoking film.",998265600,39,1463,4.379182156133829
1311497,4,B00003CXXY,"Tornatore, director of ""Cinema Paradiso,"" combines the best of the best in this, his seventh feature:
 -The beauty and sensuality of italian model, turned actress, Monica Bellucci (Malena), who demonstrates that models can be good actresses.
 -The ingenuity of young Giuseppe Sulfaro, who was in charge of the very likeable character of Renato Amoroso, the boy that falls in love with Malena's beauty, which takes him through a trip that ends up as he's turning into a man, and perhaps one of the most ethical ones in his town.
 -An incredible cinematography that exploits the natural beauty of Siracusa, Italy, which combined with the beauty of the music put together by master (and long-time musical partner of Tornatore), Ennio Morricone, makes the movie the most delightful trip for the senses.
 In general, if you loved ""Cinema Paradiso"" and/or ""Life is Beautiful"" you'll deeply enjoy this movie and its story.",998092800,14,915,5.120805369127517
1311498,4,B00003CXXY,"When Giuseppe Tornatore, the director, was shooting a commercial for Dolce and Gabana he met Monica Belluci while shooting it and when he saw her he decided that she was perfect for the part of Malena and thank god he met her. The story is about a young man (Giuseppe Sulfaro) who is only 12 and is starting to go through the usual changes a boy goes trough at that age and this is all happening while WW2 is going on. While he is going through this stage in his life he one day sees the town beauty, Malena Scordia, who's husband is from the town they live in and she is new in it. From the moment he sees her he becomes romantically obsessed with Malena, following her around town without her knowing it and spying on her. He witnesses the townspeople when they badmouth Malena behind her back and he retaliates by doing all sorts of things which i won't spoil because it takes some of the fun out of them though they are at times a little gross. He is sort of like a guardian. When news of Malena's husband's death arrives in town the gossip about her being a whore just grows and eventually circumstances make her become the town whore. The direction is very beautiful and nostalgic. It evokes memories of old italian movies and of the beautiful italian female stars of those times like Sophia Loren and Gina Lobriggida. The cinematography here just makes Monica Belluci even more beautiful than she already is and it has a dreamy feel to it and it was nominated for the Academy Award. The music here is one of Ennio Morricone's best scores. It was nominated for the Academy Award also. It is funny at times and also very bittersweet. It helps enhance the romantic, comic, and melancholy tone of the movie. And the acting is also very good. Giuseppe Sulfaro is very easy to identify with and for many guys who went through the changes this will have extra resonance. He does not have a chunk full of dialogue so he communicates his feelings through his actions and his facial expressions. Monica Belluci has even less dialogue but she manages to communicate so much emotion through those sad eyes of hers. She expresses sadness and sexiness all at once. Though it would have helped if the audience got more involved with Malena's internal conflict. The writing is flawed, mostly because the characters could have been a little more involving and this does leave some unsatisfaction. But other than that this is a beautiful movie and i strongly recommend it. You will become a fan of Miss Belluci if you see this. One more note: the resolution of the story might be a little hard for some to take becasue of the cruelty that is involved. It was hard for me to see it.",998006400,8,2670,4.495884773662551
1311499,5,B00003CXXY,"In ""Malena"", Tornatore has managed to seamlessly weave three themes together into a powerful story.
- The first theme is the coming-of-age of a boy just reaching his teen-age years. We watch him grow from a boy - experiencing the first stirrings of sexual desire - to a young man with compassion and the courage to do what's right. The film does an effective, imaginative job of depicting his struggles as he goes through this transition.
- The second theme involves the base behavior of the villagers - the dehumanizing acts driven by desire and jealousy.  They feel justified in their behavior, all the while bringing pain to everyone involved and damaging the lives of upright people.
- The third theme revolves around the effects of WWII on the village. The movie invokes a thorough period feel, and is enjoyable to watch just to see the time and place.
The development of the story is near-perfect. And just when it seems that there is no good way to end the movie, a final twist allows them to wrap everything up beautifully.
While I've seen this movie called ""erotic"", it's more accurate to describe it as ""smoldering."" There's nothing overt here - the focus is on the power of sexual desire to drive people's behavior.",997920000,3,1226,4.728971962616822
1311500,5,B00003CXXY,"'Malena' is indeed a gripping Italian cinema with English subtitles. A teenager Renato, alienated from his peers by his inadequacy of stature and indignity of wearing short pants, is filled with infatuation for Malena, a gorgeous young married woman whose beauty makes her the envy of the townspeople and the subject matter of every gossip. Malena's husband dies in the War and the gossip against her intensifies leading to her ostracism in the town. Met with isolation and starvation she falls a prey to prostitution, which almost seals her fate. Renato burning with desire for her, sees through her miseries and mistakes but only from a distance and in silence. Finally there is redemption when her husband, presumed dead, appears in town with a single arm to rescue her from indignity and misery.  This powerful story of Malena's woes is beautifully portrayed by Monica Bellucci and Giuseppe Sulfaro, in the background of Sicily during the World War II. Giuseppe Tornatore seems to be very good at weaving a tragic tale of beauty, desire and public envy. This movie provides a thought-provoking entertainment for those who like foreign films.",997401600,,1145,5.090425531914893
1311501,4,B00003CXXY,"The movie wakes up nostalgy for a died off morality, for a radical beauty -- impossible today, for less dynamic times, when one could focus more and get obsessed. But it also conveys the soothing thought of the universality of times and places. An Italian teenager, living during the Second World War, is not much different in emotional terms than any boy in any place at any time. The format may differ, but the content stays the same. ""Malena""'s teenager fights and adapts himself to his sprouting painful sexuality. His parents, although aware of the fact he is growing up in the usual way, refuse to accept it easily. Beauty is envied for, discussed, contemplated, and denied. Brutality waits for the proper moment to erupt and bury alive civilizational intents and hypocritical behaviors. The ordinary hates the extraordinary. One may easily degrade in unusual circumstances. Love is blind and lasts.
If you want to hear unthinkable truths and unbelievable conclusions, ""Malena"" is not the perfect choice. In case you want to observe human nature in action, to grasp the extent of possible extremes, and to watch beauty suffering, degradind, and triumphing, do not miss the atmosphere of this middle-century small Italian town.",997056000,,1232,5.103960396039604
1311502,5,B00003CXXY,"This is a great movie, It has a good story and really amazing characters.
Giuseppe Sulfaro played the little boy ni the movie so well, at times he was hella funny and at other times I just felt so bad for his character.
And Monica Bellucci was great, I don't think anyone else could havereally pulled off her roll.  Even through everything, she made Malena was very dignified and made you want everything to turn out for the best.",996192000,2,430,4.443037974683544
1311503,4,B00003CXXY,"This lovely and heart-wrenching movie was made even more special by the fact that the two main characters barely speak (well, one of them IS the narrator). I had never heard of the beautiful actress Monica Belluci (Malena) but now look forward to seeing her perform again. She was exquisite and spoke volumes with just her facial expressions.
Giuseppe Sulfaro played Renato, a young boy feeling the first stirring of his sexual awakening who falls in love/lust  with the beautiful Malena. His acting was very touching, especially when he goes to the church and lights a candle every day to try to ensure that Malena will come to no harm.
This coming of age film about love, jealousy, ostracism, and hate during four tumultuous years of World War II was filmed on the coast of Sicily - and what beautiful cinematography it was. The score was also magnificent, befitting the gorgeous setting.",996105600,17,890,4.855263157894737
