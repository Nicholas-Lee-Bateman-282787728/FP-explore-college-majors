6112975,5,B00GTZWXYQ,I love Psych!!! It's a great show I feel they could have stretched it out Juliet finding out truth but still love it wonder how it will end,1389657600,,139,4.0
6112976,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"Let the hilarity ensue. After a not so great season 7, season 8 is off to a great start. This episode was so good, I had to buy it.",1389657600,13,131,3.5517241379310347

6112978,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"I have loved this series since the beginning, but like many series that last over half a season, it has it's up and downs.  This is a great example of the Psych homage episodes, but with that absolutely delightful Psych flair.  Without a doubt the best buddy-(not-really)-cop series on TV, ever!",1389312000,,295,4.764705882352941
6112979,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"Shawn and Gus are back and better than ever. This episode is one of the best in a while. With season 7 ending on kind of a down note, this episode really showcases how funny this show really is. It's also great to see Carey Ewes back as a guest star. So glad it is back on and can't wait for the rest of the season.",1389225600,3,315,3.787878787878788
6112980,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"This is the longest running show on the USA network EVER!!!
There is a good reason for that.
  This show has it all, humor, crime, romance, and Shawn and Gus.
I am a little worried with having heard rumors that Season 8 MAY be the last. The worst part is there may only be 8 episodes of this season, hence the late start.
Hopefully I am not the only one who is outraged at such a possibly short final season, especially with the way Season 7 ended.
Watch this show, you will not be disappointed. If this is your first time then start from the beginning.
PEACE!!",1389225600,6,561,4.233644859813084

6113066,3,B00GTZWXYQ,"Glad this was a Prime benefit - after watching this show, not sure why I liked the episodic version. Fun, in one-episode doses, and a good introduction to how Prime episodes display.  There is a brief pause, dark screen, where the commercials would have run. Another feature is the cast and trivia display, which overlays the episode, while pausing the action. There is a brief professional bio of each actor with a speaking role, along with a display of other TV shows, movies, or documentaries the actor has been in.  Some are also part of the Prime vault and there's a way to click and save what else you'd like to watch. Cuidate, CL",1528502400,,636,4.5701754385964914

6113095,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"This was always a clever and entertaining series, and it's fun to replay the episodes without commercials.  For other ""old timers"" like me, it's a bit like the old Bowery Boys, Martin and Lewis, or Abbot and Costello, but updated for more sophisticated audiences.  Kudos to the writers and creator for the specialty episodes (Spanish soap opera, Twin Peaks, B&W, etc.), where even the opening theme music was tailored to the episode.

Highly recommended.",1527292800,,454,5.108108108108108

6113162,1,B00GTZWXYQ,"I just binge-watched all eight seasons over the past few weeks via Amazon streaming. Seasons 1-6 were amazing and hilarious.  Season 7 was good.  Season 8 was incredibly painful to watch. I was literally having to leave the room once or twice per episode because the acting and the writing was just embarrassing. Everything that worked in earlier seasons was just taken so far over the top that it became cringeworthy.

Psych was a great premise and a great show... but if you haven't already watched season 8, please just pretend the series ended at 7.",1524355200,,553,4.739583333333333

6113181,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"10 stars for a job well done in a last season. Love this show so much that I always go back and binge-watch it every now and then. Even for the last season - when a lot of shows just go downhill -, this was still good. It was nice to see the characters stretching out a bit and expanding on their usual personalities. Really liked that ""Jules"" got to vamp it up a bit. The chemistry between all the characters is what makes this show so good. The comedy can be a bit over-the-top but it works for this particular cast. I haven't seen the movie yet, but can't wait. This was one of those shows that I hated to see end but was glad that they did go out so well. By the way, I watched the after show and when you see how different the actors are from their characters, you realize how good they are at their jobs.",1523404800,,810,4.006172839506172
6113182,4,B00GTZWXYQ,"it took a while but I binged watched the whole series. I didn't like S6-8 as much as the rest but it was still a very good show. To be honest, I felt a lack of ""psychic"" detective work and they just added more of Shawn playing around. I also really wanted a Psych/Monk cross over but I think the little nod they gave on the last episode is the best I can get. Good show, I am going to miss it.",1523318400,,393,3.8048780487804876

6113206,4,B00GTZWXYQ,"I was tempted to give it 5 stars for just the ending alone, which had something desirable mixed with the unexpected. Psyche has always been awesome for its cameos from guest stars but there continue to be some priceless ones this season.

I dropped it a star because some of the episodes were just too random with the Psych Odyssey putting the actors back in time to recreate what happened with different unrelated characters had a few funny moments but was too cooky. The same with the Trial episode remake from Season 1. Some funny & cool moments but overall it was like what the hell are they doing? Last but not least the Gus Horror Nightmares episode was just way too outthere. Luckily, they are all such good and funny actors I enjoyed each and every episode, just not as much as the 1st 7 seasons. Worth watching just for the beginning of the season & the ending.",1522281600,,870,4.471698113207547

Even being mainly murder mysteries I got laughs from every episode. One of the few theme songs I still love listening to even after 8 seasons! Shout out to the writers for adding WoW pop culture Leeeeerrrrrrooooyyyyy Jeeennnkkkiinns!!!!!! Sean and Gus felt like Abbott and Costello to me, I could watch them for another 20 years easily.

When the first few seasons aired I never watched because many outdoor scenes are shot in overcast weather (Vancouver I think) and it just didn't seem visually appealing to me. I know that's silly, but colors set the mood of many shows. Anyway, I got turned on to it from a friend a gave it a try anyway and have watched the entire series several times over now. 98% of people will find enough entertainment in this show to make it worthwhile while the majority will find it absolutely delightful.

Telegraphed insipid infantile humor, I haven't watched all the episodes but wouldn't be surprised if these two resorted to toilet humor to try to stay on the air.
The premise of a psychic detective agency is dumb enough but two wizards who have to resort to FAKE PSYCHIC work is even worse.  Every year I'm astounded at the dribble that networks put out and that they have these shows based on utter idiocy go on past 2 episodes, sad that the American public is so stupid so as to be entertained by such simplistic shows.  For that matter, the fact that every channel has some sort of cop show just shows how simply people of simple minds can be amused.

6113470,3,B00GTZWXYQ,"After the past 2 to 3 lackluster seasons Psych finally closes up shop in an abbreviated Season 8.  The writing had fallen off by this time and any pretenses about Spencer's being a psychic had all but been abandoned.  Silliness replaced cleverness in recent plots and that's no exception this final season.  Quickly written out of the show (except for the last episode) are Chief Vick and Juliet who move to San Francisco to take new jobs.  Henry decides to sell the old house and ""move on"" too and Gus even takes a new corporate job and finally gets a cool company car to replace the poor ""Blueberry"".  Juliet's replacement detective (played by Mira Sorvino) has acute powers of observation which rival Shawn's quickly making ""Psych"" unnecessary to the SBPD to crack the tough cases.  The whole thing wraps up with a nice last episode that should satisfy long time fans.  Really though, it was well past time to shut this thing down.  The DVD set includes some bonus features including the horrible ""Psych: The Musical"" 90 minute episode.  It's apparent that a lot of time and energy went into making this musical show but personally I loathe musicals (OK, except ""The Sound of Music"") but it's really bad so I can't recommend watching it.",1466640000,2,1240,4.730232558139535

6113486,4,B00GTZWXYQ,"The 8th season of the show felt off from the prior seasons.  Part of this is because the spoof/specialty episodes that were mixed in here and there in prior seasons were basically every other episode of season 8, up until the series finale.  For those who listen to the commentary tracks that was because the writers knew it would be the last season and basically did all the episodes they wanted to do up to that point, but had not.  So there is a remake episode, telling the same story as the weatherman murder from an earlier season with most of the parts recast with actors who had appeared on the show throughout the series.  There was an episode based in London, with Gus decked out in Harry Potter attire (and seeing the return of Cary Elewes) and en episode that pays homage to just about every horror film aside from Friday the 13th.

Another thing that hurt this season was the lack of all the main cast in each episode.  Part of it was done for story line reasons, but there were just too large a chunk of time throughout the 10 episodes where Chief Vick, Juliette or Henry would not appear.  There were some great guest star spots in the season including Mira Sorvino, Tom Arnold (and a ghost), Anthony Michael Hall, and even (finally) Billy Zane and Val Kilmer.  Even with the faults of the season overall, the series finale was wonderful.  It told the story that I think needed to be told, was funny, heartwarming and even tear jerking toward the end.

For those who get the DVDs, like the other seasons there are commentary tracks on some episodes, deleted scenes for most episodes and a gag reel.  The musical (which was actually filmed during season 7, but not aired until season 8) is also included.  There are commentary tracks for both the musical episode and the series finale.  There are also a couple short behind the scenes features, one for the musical, and one for the ending/wrapping up of the series.  All in all a lot there.

Overall Psych was a great show.  It definitely ran out of steam during season 7, and season 8 kind of bore the brunt of that.  By the end however the series is tied up nicely, and the characters are in a good place as show show goes off into the sunset.  Even though season 8 is not as good as the prior seasons overall, it is still worth getting if you have the other seasons on DVD.",1458086400,34,2339,4.4125874125874125

There are at least 4 episodes that remind me why I have loved this show from the beginning, but there are at least 3 that were a total waste of time, especially the remake episode. If you are going to give a season with a reduced episode count (and seasons of Psych were already shortened enough normally), than a gimmick episode like ""Remake A.K.A.

6113558,3,B00GTZWXYQ,"I've been a Psych-o since the very first episode and have enjoyed all the seasons but this final season was a disappointment.  I believe that the real problem was the absence of Juliet and Chief Vick.  Although  Kirsten Nelson makes a couple of cameos, her character is essentially written out and the exit of Maggie Lawson after the fourth episode really left a big hole.  The main attraction of this show was it's characters and their relationships with each other.  I also felt that the storylines weren't as strong in addition to several HUGE errors which for me, were very distracting.  Example:  In the remake of ""Cloudy with a chance of murder..."", the episode was set in 1981.  It opens with Henry and Shawn in the courtroom with Shawn in an infant car seat however Shawn was supposed to have been born in 1977 so a four year old wouldn't be in an infant car seat!  There were several of these errors throughout the season.  Also, Anthony Michael Hall's character was just obnoxious and totally inappropriate for this show and Mira sorvino was way too goofy.  It seems that it would have been better if the writers had ended the series with season seven instead of dragging the show through an eighth season.  However I will miss this show...it was lighthearted and interesting and as someone who was in my 20's during the 1980's, I really enjoyed the pop cultural references.  Throughout the first seven seasons, there were a host of big name guest stars such as William Shatner, Louis Gossett Jr, Malcolm MacDowell, George Takei, Cheech Marin, Cybil Shepard, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, John Cena, Lou Diamond Phillips and Wade Boggs in addition to several ""theme"" episodes such as an homage to Twin Peaks, The Shining, teen vampire movies and the movie Clue.  Violence is minimal, there is no foul language and mild sexual innuendo so it is appropriate for teens and adults.  If you haven't seen this show and are interested in giving it a try, DON'T start with THIS season or you may end up missing a really good show.",1438128000,3,2031,4.713881019830028

6113569,4,B00GTZWXYQ,"All good things must come to an end.  The trick for a TV series if figuring out when that end should be.  For psych, that end came with the shortened eighth season.  And while some of us fans definitely think the show went on a little too long, it went out on a high note.

When last we saw our heroes, life in Santa Barbara was changing, and not for the better.  Chief Vick (Kirsten Nelson) had been replaced as chief of police and head detective Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) had been demoted to beat cop.  The only person the changes had helped was Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) who was now head detective.  And our heroes?  There was no place for consultants and especially psychics, so fake psychic Shawn Spencer (James Roday) and his best friend Gus (Dule Hill) were definitely out on their own.

But don't count them out so fast.  Shawn and Gus manage to worm their way into a case when Lassiter gets great news that turns him into a coward.  And when coroner Woody (Kurt Fuller) gets taken hostage, Shawn and Gus are again in the thick of things.  Before the season is out, a new chief of police is named, we meet up with a recurring character in England, Shawn's dad Henry (Corbin Bernsen) sells the house where Shawn grew up, and everyone flashes back to the 1960's to solve the murder of the mayor's uncle.  In one of the best episodes of the season, Shawn and Gus go undercover to find out who killed their favorite food truck owner.  Trust me, this one was hilarious.

The season was mostly enjoyable, but was a bit over the top.  Looking back on the show, the writers have been letting Shawn and Gus's antics get crazier and crazier as the series has progressed.  They are certainly funny, and I enjoy watching them, however, they need to be reigned in at times.  Many of these episodes would improve if they just didn't let the characters get quite so out of hand.

In an interesting choice, one of the first season episodes is remade.  Yes, it is even set back in 2006.  I watched both episodes back to back, and frankly, I'm not sure what the point was.  Again, there were more antics (not necessarily a good thing, although some were amusing), and it was interesting to watch them spin things with a different killer.  A few of the in jokes and stabs at remakes were certainly fun, however.

Another issue the season had was the cast.  I'm not talking about the acting, which was always good.  But Maggie Lawson was just some of the episodes because she had taken a job on Back in the Game on ABC.  Frankly, that hurt because her character often provides some of the much needed grounding of the show.  Likewise, Kristen Nelson's Chief Vick wasn't in enough episodes.

But honestly, to get a good glimpse at this season, you need to take a look at the final two episodes.  The penultimate episode was ""A Nightmare on State Street.""  I was expecting one of their horror movie spoofs with Bruce Campbell as a guest star.  This episode involved zombies and a mystery that made no sense at all.  Between the dreams and the reality, it was almost impossible to follow any semblance of a story.

Then there's ""The Breakup.""  The series ender was perfect.  There was a good mystery to solve as everything was brought to a close.  There were some great shout outs to the fans and plenty of good moments between the characters.  The final scene was possibly one of the funniest of the series.  I couldn't have been happier with how it ended.

And honestly, with how this season was structured, I'm surprised it took everyone so long to officially announce this as the final season of the show.  With fewer episodes than normal and an actual story arc to the season, I saw this coming months ago and felt certain of it as the season progressed.  It would have been very hard to keep the series running even if they had cut out the final episode and saved it for another time.  I do think they made the right call.  While I enjoyed most of the season, it is time to say goodbye, and as I said, the finale was perfect.

The season includes all 10 episodes on 3 discs in their native wide screen and surround sound.  Extras include some deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a podcast with various members of the cast and crew on almost every episode.  The biggest surprise to me was the inclusion of the wonderful musical episode that aired back in December.  It was filmed as part of season seven but held until December and then released on DVD by itself.  I'm glad I waited so I can get it as part of this set.  Finally, there's a behind the scenes on the musical and a goodbye featurette.

The over the top antics of Shawn and Gus were a bit too much during the final season of psych.  Still, the loyal fans will be happy with these episodes and happy with how the show ends.  I will definitely be rewatching several of them over the years and will gladly welcome season eight to my DVD collection.",1434499200,,4908,4.431767337807607

Since Season 6 was the last, I do need to mention that I felt they wrapped everything up in a satisfying way. Characters had their story lines dealt with in pleasing and realistic ways. The very end of the last show gives a nod to something else I adore--I don't want to give anything away--so that helped soften the blow of the series ending.",1434326400,,521,4.473684210526316

I don't think I've ever seen a show try to provide a send off to so many of the characters.  Everyone, practically, has their moment.  Very happy for Buzz.  But the poor Blueberry...

Psych has always about parody, but it jumps off the diveboard into complete self-parody.  The remake episode - well, it's like most remakes.

6113997,5,B00GTZWXYQ,I was skeptical as to whether or not this season would satisfy the series as a whole. I didn't enjoy the beginning of season 7 because it didn't feel like the original psych but thankful season 7 panned out well. Going into the final season I had hopes for what I wanted to see and also wanted to be surprised and I was not disappointed. Definitely worth watching and a delightful crazy fun ending to a fantastically wonderful show. So thankful for all the fun and laughs!,1403827200,,472,4.436781609195402

Annoying, and truly upsetting because the show is now over.  Regardless, still one of the best shows and quite possibly one of the best acting duos (Roday/Hill) in the past 15 years.",1402963200,8,451,4.8311688311688314

I purchased the last couple episodes hoping that they would go out with a bang, but it really just fizzled for me.  Quite a let down.  I'd say wait for this to come to Netflix.  it's not worth paying for outside that already purchased membership if you can have the patience to wait.

6114037,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"Enjoyed the season.  Some of the ending episodes a bit unusual.  However, kept my attention because of that.  Funny and entertaining, as usual.  Felt sadness on the last episode.  However, was uplifted by the ending.  Very good and solid.",1401494400,3,238,4.9743589743589745

6114051,2,B00GTZWXYQ,"Viewers should have been warned that the show more or less ended last season... The first episode and the last episode of this season actually advance the overall plot of the entire show.  The rest is fluff.  I wish I had known that this was going to be such a thrown together season of grab-bag episodes.  I would not have bought it, I would have just waited for it to come out on Netflix.  One of the episodes is actually a do-over of an old episode, and then most of the season just seems like bonus episodes that didn't really add anything to the overall plot, but they had so much fun making them  or they were so funny that they just had to fit them in somewhere.  Yes, it's classic Psych, yes, it's funny, but as the absolute last season EVER, this is really disappointing.

My husband and I absolutely loved the show as a whole.  I'd give the show overall five stars, but this season just does not do what it should for the end of everything.",1401235200,2,950,4.268156424581005

It was rushed and like the writers were all out of material so they came up with whatever they could.  But, since I have collected all seasons of Psych, which, btw, were excellent (up until the last season) I still would have bought season eight because I would want to own the entire set.

6114056,5,B00GTZWXYQ,I've been watching this show since the beginning. I have laughed more with their immature chicanery than any other tv program...until I started watching Top Gear.

I'm pretty sure the writers of Psych just figured since it was the last season they could do whatever they wanted and instead of going forward with the character development they worked for 7 years to achieve, they decided to forget all of that and put whatever stupid and irrelevant plot lines they could think of into these last episodes.

6114060,2,B00GTZWXYQ,"I own all of the season of Psych along with Psych: The Musical, and season 8 has fallen short of the typical humor.  The last episode of the season is the best.  The lack of all of the characters really affected the overall enjoyability of the episodes. Gus's character became a bit more ""silly"" in a not so positive way.  Due to this, Shawn's character also appeared even more ridiculous.  Again, I found this to be due in large part to the lack of the regular characters on the show.  I missed Juliet, Karen, and Henry.  I understand that the actors were all busy with other endeavors, but, in that case, it would have been nice to end the show sooner so that the show would have ended on a positive note.  Those that say this last season was just as good as the pervious seasons is simply not watching the same show as I was watching.  It went from ten funny, memorable lines an episode to about one to two per episode.  Still, I am a huge Psych-O and will continue re-watching all of the seasons.",1400025600,23,1000,4.304812834224599

This show is similar to CSI, in the way that it has a plodding story that is hardly ever inspired.  However, unlike CSI, Psych is packed full of comedic moments that alleviates the mediocre plot.  I would have given this show 3/5 stars if they ever slacked on the humor, but the cast and writers have allowed me to laugh for eight seasons straight, which is no easy feat.  I rate it a 5/5 and recommend you watch this show from the start if you want a good dramedy.",1399248000,10,562,4.375

(Although, I would never put it past Shawn.)  This show brought a ton of mystery, humor, and hijinks, which made it SO much fun.  I'm pretty sure that I'll live a little longer based on how much I've belly laughed because of them.  However, I think I'm going to miss the dynamics between Shawn and Gus the most.

We all really enjoyed following the Psych team through the 8 seasons.  This final season was a good but not as great as the past few.  In this brief season, there some well written and acted episodes where the Psych cast, brought to the small screen their best like in the final episode. However, as all series experience, there were some ""duds"".  I don't have to pick them out for you; will inevitably have your own.  I knew going into this season that this was most likely the last season and that the cast was getting tired.  Unfortunately it showed in about half of the episodes.  Characters became clichs and were way too predictable.  I still rate this season of Psych over any show on network television.",1398643200,,837,4.4605263157894735

6114141,5,B00GTZWXYQ,An amazing end to an amazing show. This season has everything you could want. More Pierre Despereaux and closure for all the amazing relationships. I only wish it wasn't over.,1398038400,,175,4.866666666666666
6114142,5,B00GTZWXYQ,I think we fear if we watch the last episode there will be no more.  That is true.  Great packaging and the disks work.,1397952000,,119,3.9166666666666665
6114143,5,B00GTZWXYQ,Psych is my and my grandson's favorite program. So disappointed that this is the last season. I have all the DVDs and watch them frequently.,1397865600,,140,4.64

6114146,4,B00GTZWXYQ,"The DVD is fine (technically speaking) but I could only give it 4 stars because I'm so distressed that the series has ended. Episodes were maybe not quite as innovative as other seasons, but it was winding down and probably had to give the feeling of that.  Very, very pleased that Shawn and Gus will be together in the ""bay area"", that Shawn and Juliettte are still a couple, and that Lassiter has a happy ending.  Did i miss it, or was Henry's situation left unclear.  Grateful for every episode of every season!",1397520000,,514,4.505376344086022

6114161,2,B00GTZWXYQ,"I've really enjoyed this series in the past, but this new episode was really lacking.  Shawn was just too much of an idiot and the jokes were just too drawn out to retain their humor.  It felt like the writers were grasping at anything possible to make a funny episode and totally missed the mark.  I'm really hoping that the next episodes in this season are better, otherwise they're going to lose me--so sad!",1397260800,,410,4.513513513513513

6114169,4,B00GTZWXYQ,"The crowd I roll with is more into ""reality TV"".  They are fully aware just how ""real"" it isn't. Then we have Psych. Yes, he deceived, but Shawn did try to help out. The last season wasn't my favorite, but it had to end somehow. Chuck, Leverage, Psych...all gone now.  I'd like to see a spin off of Leverage, but the other two, I can let go. My two cents, watch it from the very beginning Psycathon style.",1396742400,,405,4.17948717948718
6114170,2,B00GTZWXYQ,"Well, with great sadness I write this review.  First off, my TV is only hooked up to a DVD player so at the end of each season I buy the DVDs when they come out and I do a Psych marathon.  I LOVED every season of Psych, except this one. It's as if they hired writers that had never seen the show.  What happened to Shawn's finger to temple bit and his visions? What happened to a thousand 80's references? What happened to the banter?  What happened to Juliet and the chief, and Mcnab andShawn's dad? I guess they all found other acting jobs and could only do a couple of shows? People have commented on James and Dule not caring and the quality of their acting declining but that's not true.  They were still being them.  It was the scripts that were totally lacking, along with directing?  The actors can only do so much if the lines they are supposed to say suck.  I thought the first episode wasn't bad and the last episode felt like it had the ""Psych"" feeling back, but that is it.  I just don't know what happened.  This WAS the best written show on TV.  Boy will I miss it.  At least I can watch the first 7 seasons and try to forget my serious disappointment, not only with the show ending but also with the quality of it's send off.  R. I. P. Psych.",1396742400,7,1258,4.170124481327801
6114171,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"Wrapping up the series in the right way. Each episode drives home the fact that Shawn never grew up and will drive everyone away until he learns to be a man. The only downside to that angle is that I wonder how they can bring everyone back together for a movie or special event without Shawn's personal growth and if he's not a child, would we still Love the show?",1396742400,,364,4.214285714285714
6114172,3,B00GTZWXYQ,"A little too much over the top, a little too forced humor ... i think this might be the last season. And although I really liked the previous seasons, this one left me a bit unsatisfied. I still think this is one of the better shows that are out there today, but I was looking forward to a monumental season - but this one was uninspiring and not as refreshingly funny and endearing as the show themes and story lines usually are.

A whole lot of effort to bring an end to a quintessential comedy/mystery which has no comparative peers.",1396656000,3,536,4.36
6114173,3,B00GTZWXYQ,"Psych has always been one of my favorite shows, but this season felt incredibly uneven. Juliette's presence as the balancing ""normal"" character was sorely missed for most of the season, and the replacement chief or the first half of the season was a big misstep. I feel like this season amplified the complaint I've had about Psych for the past couple of seasons, making the cases even more about wacky situations to put Shawn and Gus in and less about the mystery. There were a couple of episodes where I'm not even sure if there was a case. I think it was time to end the show, but I still think this season was fun and watchable.",1396656000,3,632,4.410256410256411

6114190,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"This season started out with a bang with the first episode, one of my favorites of the series, and while some of the middle episodes didn't seem to have quite the same verve as other seasons, I love how things were both changing and being wrapped up from all the storylines that had been going throughout. ""S.E.I.Z.E. the Day"" was one of my favorites of this season, and ""A Touch of Sweevil"" was a wonderful throwback to the first season all-out wackiness.

But the real strength here was that the writers took care to wrap everything up. Not just cobble it together, but really take these storylines that we've invested in throughout these eight seasons and bring them to full, sometimes startling, and ultimately satisfying conclusions. I laughed and cried and laughed and cried and laughed some more throughout ""The Break-Up,"" which had so many goosebump-inducing moments. It was one of the most satisfying concluding episodes of any show I've seen, and just makes me love Psych all the more.

And now...rewatch!",1396396800,6,1015,4.895348837209302

6114193,1,B00GTZWXYQ,"Psych has been an interesting, creative, funny show. It sadly fell apart in this last season.  It is a little too obvious that they were working around actor availability. James Roday and Dule Hill seemed like they had given up, and were not putting much into their performances. The episodes were filled with gimmicks, and the tone felt wrong.

6114249,3,B00GTZWXYQ,"I've been a Psych fan since season 1 and have thoroughly enjoyed watching the show. Full of laughs and comedy, mystery, and lighthearted fun, this is one of my favorite tv shows of all time.

Except, this season. I've been so disappointed at each episode this season. The episodes are just too weird and a little far-fetched and not as much laughs. I also miss having more of the other characters on, like Juliet and Chief and even Henry Spencer. I also felt there wasn't much focus on the mystery/detective work, but rather other ""fillers"" to the show.

I do miss the flashbacks for Shawn as a little boy with his dad. That gave a more intimate and developed quality about the show.

Update 4/1/14: The last episode, series finale was great! The best episode of the season, full of what Psych was all about. Will definitely miss!",1395792000,5,830,4.594594594594595

6114251,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"One of the most impressive aspects of Psych, in my opinion, is the incredible manner in which they theme most of the episodes. I recently watched their episode that is themed on ""The Nightmare on Elm Street"" and they did an absolutely phenomenal job of theming the cinematography, the editing, the music, the acting (mainly extras and actors that appear in a couple of episodes), etc...The show, throughout all of the seasons, does an outstanding job of this, which really keeps the show entertaining and adds an element of unpredictability.

But, that said, I don't know any other show as funny or silly as ""Psych"".  It has occasional seriousness that adds to its enjoyment but the really big appeal of ""Psych"" is that you don't really have to think about it much, just laugh. Not a very complex or stimulating TV show but great for the end of a long day when you just want to relax. I am so sad that this is the last season.

The final season is up us and I will one of those people that will be happy that I won't have to see commercials of a series that should have gone away a long time ago.  While the two main stars do have good chemistry they show itself isn't funny.  It is difficult to believe that people believe that this man has any type of psychic powers other than to BS people.  I admire his talent to be observant and his ability to observe things better than most but that got old in the very first season.  Do yourself a favor; if you're looking for goofiness with little humor than watch this series or do yourself a bigger favor and skip it all together.,1395187200,,746,4.26241134751773

6114276,1,B00GTZWXYQ,"WHAT HAPPENED to the writers of psych??!!  What started as such a fun, creative, interactive detective series (....complex plots and characters with depth and understatement), morphed into this sleazy, stupid, boring line-up and show.  Throwing bologna??  Really.  This is pathetic.  Gus was the brains, the compass, the re-focus, and Shawn was the zany but brilliant observer, the ""psychic"" detective.  Now, Gus is just a fat, stale stereotype--- the ""old"" Gus had such a good character--- a dirty shame the fame went to his head and he resorts to just clicking his tongue, wagging his jaw, and dancing that ridiculous dance-- ho hum.  Now, Shawn just lacks everything that he use to have: wit, cuteness, a serious side, Juliette....
Give it up or change it back to the talented writing and the talented actors.  If there were a lower rating possible, like a  star, that SHOULD be assigned.",1395014400,14,891,5.006802721088436

The way television seems to be heading, I doubt if there will be anything worth watching in the future.  (Let's hope CBS doesn't cancel NCIS)",1394841600,5,487,4.366666666666666

Season 8 has been a mix of old psych with more drama then case solving but the more recent episodes have put an end to that.

6114292,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"I believe this season ""feels"" the way it does is because the writers were;t planning on the cancellation. However, now that I think about it, I find this to be the fitting ending; spontaneous, erratic, and ultimately entertaining. Just like Psych. I am going to miss you.",1394236800,,271,4.787234042553192

6114294,1,B00GTZWXYQ,"I own all of the dvd's, but it will be hard to purchase this season. Only first episode has been up to Psych standards. Juliet is phoning it in, it's not about Shawn anymore, the writing and very poor. They should have at least owned up to it being the last season. Props to Timothy and Dule. Maybe James is too busy with his new movie to care. I watch every episode hoping to laugh. The drama is predictable and the comedy is cheesy. There's maybe one good line in each episode. There are three episodes left. I will be surprised if we even see Juliet anymore. It will probably end with Shawn driving off into the sunset to be with his girl. What the heck happened Steve Franks!?!",1394064000,13,681,4.286821705426356

6114296,2,B00GTZWXYQ,I think the writers of this show are running out of ideas to keep it fun to watch.  It appears now that it is being written to entertain the actors and not the audience.,1393977600,5,169,3.9705882352941178
6114297,5,B00GTZWXYQ,This show has gray wit and humor. The quips that Shawn and Gus toss at each other make the show much more than a typical comedy. I also enjoy the references to various pop culture fandoms such as the nostalgic 70s and 80s time periods and classic movies. This is a great time and it will be sad when the show ends.,1393891200,,314,4.080645161290323

I admit it ;~]  Everyone involved has made sure that each episode of first half of season is fun and unique.  Nothing can top 'Lassie Jerky', but Season 8, just like Seasons 1-7 is well worth watching again and again.

6114308,2,B00GTZWXYQ,"I am so disappointed the time frame in which they took for this season along with the story line was aweful. Making the new chief Trout eccentric did not fit well will Shawns, they did not pick up with where they left all from season 7 and now with it being the last season are making Shawn being incompetent in life is rediculous, It does not follow the true story line of his growth as a human being and allow him to be proud of himself, what do you mean he can't figure out a line of employment, how can he not continue to earn a living as a detective (which is what I thought and hoped the direction was going) Come on Son!; along with Jewels they had to of lost their writers, By the length of this review you can tell how thoroughly disappointed I am, they took a great show and have ruined it's. I have loved and own all the seasons and though each week I have said I'm not buying the next episode, I do hoping they turn it around, they haven't yet and if they don't, no I can't say they will kill a great show because they just did",1393459200,2,1039,4.048543689320389

James Roday and Dule Hill have a great comedic chemistry and to be honest I think it has gotten better. I wasn't too thrilled when Lassie was demoted, I yearned for the Lassie-Shawn fighting, but it was nice to see more of Woody. I think the writers have done a good job and will be sad to see it go. This was the only comedy worth watching next to The Goldberg's. The eighties really was a funny time!

6114327,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"This is a great show to watch with your kids.  There is no vulgar humor and often the adult humor is so subtle that you would have to be somewhat worldly or just be old enough to understand the reference from the 80's.  Although there is often a homocide, there is no onscreen violence.  Psych is not meant to be a crime drama but just out and out fun with crime as a background.  I dream of taking a tour of the Psych filming locations in British Columbia.  Favorite sequence of this season,

Gus: ""Since Wilson was murdered, he's due some good luck now, at least that's what math says.""
Shawn: ""Would you please stop quoting math like it is a person? Next you're going to tell me that math is black.""

Don't know why they did that, and haven't gone back to compare.

Up to this point a lot of the character dynamic is just missing, they have a replacement chief / sheriff in town and while I like the actor, I don't care at all for the role he's playing, nor how that's screwing up the character interactions.

The creator, Steve Franks, is an unadulterated pure comedic genius. His storylines are unique, fascinating, disturbingly disturbing at times, and, most of all, excruciatingly funny. There should have been a warning before watching this episode to wear your sunglasses because the acting is SO brightly and brilliantly executed, it could damage your eyes without them.

Gus & Shawn make THE perfect duo - dynamic, charming, sexy, awkward, eccentric - all these elements and more.",1391299200,4,591,5.276595744680851

6114347,5,B00GTZWXYQ,I was a little disappointed in season 7 I absolutely love seasons 1-6 so we will see how season 8 turns out.  I love these guys they are hilarious and a fun show for everyone to watch and enjoy.,1391126400,12,194,3.9743589743589745

6114349,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"Best show ever! Even the remake of an old episode was very well done!  This show is original, clean, funny, clever... I wish it could go on forever, and that there were many more shows like it!",1390953600,,193,4.216216216216216

6114352,4,B00GTZWXYQ,"I have friends who find this show juvenile... but, I love silly and I love this show, I think I've watched every episode season 1 - 6 about 4 times... and I catch something new everytime.  I highly recommend this show!!  If you want some humor with your mystery... and you're a fan of 80's references... you will likely love this show... !!",1390867200,,340,4.380952380952381
6114353,4,B00GTZWXYQ,Psych is not as good as it was originally but it is still better than most t.v. shows. I'll keep watching and hoping they continue into another season.,1390867200,,151,4.428571428571429

6114356,2,B00GTZWXYQ,"I agree w/ the commenter who said season 8 was a step down in the writing quality. I feel the show is getting really stupid. It was always cheeky, quirky and very slapstick, but very funny.  Now it's getting really silly, boring and not very clever.  The new interim chief is a very formulaic and base character who is completely predictable. They turned Lassiter into a coward. His misguided bravery was a hallmark of the character. WTF?.... I'm starting to move on to other shows...I hope they don't f this one up like so many initially smart shows.",1390694400,4,551,4.612244897959184
6114357,3,B00GTZWXYQ,"Fav show EVER!!! However, I do not believe they went in the right direction for the remake of this episode from season one. I love psych, but I am deff disappointed with this remake.",1390521600,3,182,4.382352941176471
6114358,5,B00GTZWXYQ,"I don't watch much if any TV, but when I do, I'm attracted to  ""Comedy"", and James Roday and Dule` Hill are one of the best comedy teams EVER.. The entire cast is spot on perfect for the roles given them. The Creator Steve Franks and his team of writers are ""Brilliant"". Thank you for sharing your talents with us.

6114366,5,B00GTZWXYQ,One of the best comedies on television.  The chemistry these two have together is one of the best on television.  It is such an amazing show and the constant pop culture references make it even better.,1389830400,,201,4.555555555555555
6114367,4,B00GTZWXYQ,"I liked last season's first few episodes as well, before it turned into a show spoofing itself and attempting an ensemble cast scenario based on boyfriend/girlfriend boringness.

I hope this season is not just an homage to their previous shows, characters, and one-liners. This first episode was that, but it was good, although Gus seems too clowny now. Lots of caricature going on with both of them. Why do shows settle in and rely on rehashing and recurring characters? This show was going nothing but forward and then it's like something weird happened.

Hope they keep it together for this last season.",1389744000,3,606,4.931372549019608
