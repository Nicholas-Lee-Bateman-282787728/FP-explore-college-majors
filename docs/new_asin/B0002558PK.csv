8022328,5,B0002558PK,"Don't ask me why, but somehow the title of the video album was changed to ""Visions,"" whereas the LP, cassette, and CD was called ""The Fox.""  This was Elton's first album for Geffen Records after parting company with MCA after several years.  The tunes are linked by a handsome, well-built bare-chested teen boy finding colored parts to a circular puzzle.  It includes the singles ""Chloe"" and ""Nobody Wins,"" but the video's highlights are the daring ""Elton's Song"" (penned by Tom Robinson of ""2-4-6-8 Motorway"" and ""Glad to Be Gay"" fame) and ""Carla/Etude & Fanfare"" (the album's obligatory instrumental concert piece).""  These videos were unlikely to have been added to MTV's playlist back when the album was new, partly because some of the subject matter was considered too risque for broadcast, and many of the other tracks didn't rock enough for MTV's then-format.  Still, the videos are creative, the songs are excellent (one of my favorite EJ albums), and the segues are filled with eye-candy!",1319414400,4,997,5.054878048780488
