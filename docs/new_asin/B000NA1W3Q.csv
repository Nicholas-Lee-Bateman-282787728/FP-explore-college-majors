I am especially begging for you not to ignore Jerry Stiller for performing the high-wire acting role of Arthur to comic perfection!",1178582400,4,404,4.45945945945946

2761888,2,B000NA1W3Q,"This started out as a funny, good natured comedy with Doug and Cary a sometimes quarrelsome but ultimately loving couple, a la The Honeymooners.

Somewhere in the middle of the run, they started turning nasty and hateful towards each other, with hardly a hint of the affection that made it funny in the beginning. I'm sorry, but I don't particularly care to watch two people yell and scream at each other for a half hour.

And did they really think they were being ""cutting edge"" by having the character spout the word ""frigging"" or ""frickin"" ten times an episode? How sophomoric can you get?  Makes me realize how really great Frasier was!

This one jumped the shark back in the third of fourth episode and I made it this far only because I made the mistake of buying the Complete Series and hated to waste my money. But I've decided I'd rather waste my money than my time.",1217030400,7,874,4.512658227848101

2761891,5,B000NA1W3Q,"I've left a couple of comments for other KofQ compilations.  However, one of the BEST things about all of the boxed sets is they are on only three disks.  If you are a diehard KofQ fan as I am, you can have marathon viewings without getting off the couch to change disks.  That's the way Doug would do it: sit on the couch for the long ride--snacks within reach.  I love Raymond, but 5 discs are too much.  They take up a lot of room and you have to get off the sofa to change disks too often.  Go for the King--its much funnier than Raymond and more user friendly.",1192406400,,565,4.090909090909091
2761892,5,B000NA1W3Q,"No need to add to what others here have said.  This show was fantastic from Day 1, and was so at least through the end of this last full season.  It's my favorite main-stream comedy, ever!  (Arrested Development wasn't really mainstream.)

However, Discs 2 and 3 fade to black after the intro Anti-Piracy screen and the Warning (Interpol) screen, and never come back.  This is on a Philips player that plays every other of my hundreds of DVD's just fine.

The only real complaint I had was there were no extras being that it was the last season.  I was hoping for some sort of look back type of thing or something that talked to the cast.  Besides that, it's the last season and being a fan I HAD TO BUY IT.  If your a fan, GET IT!",1191974400,,415,3.880952380952381
2761894,5,B000NA1W3Q,"Kevin James is a master of physical comedy as displayed here in the stripper pole episode which is one of the funniest routines on a sitcom in years.  This was the year he was finally nominated for an emmy but sadly lost.

The King of Queens never got tired even into its eighth and ninth seasons.  The cast was still into it and the writing still funny week after week.  Unlike many newer shows this show will be a timeless classic right up there with I Love Lucy, All in the Family, and Seinfeld.  It never got the respect or attention it deserved but Kevin James and gang will be entertaining us for years.",1186358400,2,609,4.307017543859649
2761895,5,B000NA1W3Q,"I just began getting into The King of Queens, and I must say that this show is definitely ""The King of Sitcoms"".  Kevin James & Leah Remini as The Heffernans are simply amazing and the chemistry between them is unprecedented - they act and react so much like a real couple, that at times I can't help but feel that they are actually married in real life. (Although of course they aren't.)  They play off of one another so well that the laughs and the day-to-day trials and tribulations in every episode just keep you coming back for more.

I am now starting to watch the 3rd season and can't believe how great and addictive this show is...it only took me 2 days to watch the entire 2nd season!!  This show Rocks!!  If you want a terrific sitcom to watch, then don't hesitate, go buy ""The King of Queens"" - The King of Sitcoms - a rarity in our society today...Thanks Doug & Carrie for letting me escape from reality just when I need to the most.  A rare gem and real treat.  ENJOY!!! :)",1183507200,,986,4.297297297297297

Very rarely does a television program make me laugh out loud but I can always count on The King of Queens to do just that (even though I've seen every episode at least 10 times if not more)  I was sad to see the series end but they'll live on in syndication.
