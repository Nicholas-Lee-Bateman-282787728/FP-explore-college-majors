8276991,1,B001AD6UK0,"This is the cut by 2/3rds American version. It is so chopped that Abel Gance is not listed at director. I was hoping that it was the French version only cut by 1/3rd which retains 100 minutes of Gance's 3-hour director's cut with readable subtitles. I have a DVD version which has 2 subtitle lines which would have made LA FIN DU MONDE easier to follow. Unfortunately it was framed so only the top [when not just half the top] line was visible. I know the film is a peace polemic, but I would have enjoyed the French version with readable subtitles to fill in Gance's cinematic vision. What this is a grade Z ""Mondo Cane"" version with only disaster scenes and title cards remaining. Don't bother.",1425427200,,696,4.488188976377953
8276992,3,B001AD6UK0,It only gets 3 stars because of its great age and portrayal of people in the 1930's. Its a silent movie and the science even for that era wasn't well researched. It was given almost zero budget.,1412640000,,194,4.27027027027027
8276993,5,B001AD6UK0,I enjoyed this. Great early film! It was a bit scratchy and the sound was not the best but if those things don't bother you then it is a good film.,1360108800,,147,3.774193548387097
8276994,2,B001AD6UK0,"This film, titled La Fin Du Monde, has an original running time of 105 minutes, and there have been DVD releases in Europe that run around 90 minutes, but this travesty we have here on demand is the chopped up version that was imported into the United States back in the '40s.  The distributors originally titled it PARIS AFTER DARK, but Sinister Cinema was clever enough to find a END OF THE WORLD title, in order to mislead the buyer into thinking that are getting the longer version, although they do correctly state the running time, but I think they probably would rather not have had to do that, since their catalog never states running times.  I took a chance, based on the synopsis, which described the original movie, with the extended orgies, Abel Gance playing his brother, and the controversial crucifixion scene.  But all of those scenes are CUT OUT of this version, so we are mislead again by Sinister Cinema.  This synopsis has been in their catalog for years, so they obviously aren't interested in giving the buyer an accurate description of the movie.  Based on the other rather shallow review of this film, I felt it important to set the record straight.  Anyone interested in the long version might try Express Files.",1337212800,3,1237,4.730232558139535
8276995,3,B001AD6UK0,"1930, France. This French speaking film is the grandfather of all disasterfilms. It also showes a mixing of silent film and 'talkie' acting and directing. If you can get into the 'why they did it this way' of the script and direction you might enjoy it, otherwise its just a footnote in film history.",1300665600,,300,4.574074074074074
8276996,1,B001AD6UK0,"Review of Abel Gance's ""End of the World"" is really quite unfair.  The version offered by Sinister Cinema is the 55 minute version released in the United States way  back in 1934.  In fact the movie poster, as seen on the DVD cover, does not name Gance as the director, but rather shows it as being presented by Harold Auten, the American Distributor and directed by someone named Dr. V. Invanoff.  Gance's name doesn't even appear in the credits though he not only directed the movie, he stared in it and played a major role (which was cut out).

The 55 minute DVD is the shaved down version of a film that Gance originally envisioned as a three hour epic.  It appears the film's backers were discouraged  by its length so they opted to shorten it by more than two thirds.  I have only seen two of Abel Gance's movies besides this one: Napoleon and J'Accuse.  I can only say that those movies were visually and emotionally stimulating and proof, at least to me, that Abel Gance is a giant among filmmakers, past and present.  I feel certain that if ""End of the World"" had been left to Gance's devices it would have reigned highly among his other masterpieces.

Wikipedia mentions this about ""End of the World"":
""Abel Gance himself referred to the film as ""an abortive work"" ruined by the producer taking the film away from him so he could edit it himself.""

So unfortunate.  The 55 minute film lacks much. It is obviously fragmented and disjointed.  It is a ruined film, really not worth watching.  However, there is still that style, the invasive imagery, that hand that reaches out and grabs you, shakes you, makes you feel uncomfortable and lays permanent impressions on your mind.  It may be like watching through a steam clouded window, but its still Abel Gance.  You can feel it.",1239148800,7,1786,4.60126582278481
