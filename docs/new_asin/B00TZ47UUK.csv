8703384,4,B00TZ47UUK,"I have never seen or heard a Reimann opera, though I know who he is, as a modern opera composer.  So, I came to this DVD with no illusions or pre-conceptions, other than that I knew he was quite progressive with his harmonics and musical style.

I thoroughly enjoyed this piece- both musically and as a stage work.  It pushed boundaries, introduced interesting concepts, while remaining true to the essence of Shakespeares master play for the most part.  And the staging was terrific.

Let me start musically.  Reimann is certainly modernist with his harmonics, tonal disruption, and orchestration. To me, it had strong roots in Stravinsky (which is certainly NOT a deficit).  There are no hummable tunes, but, then, that is not the musical milieu in which he is working.  The dramatic chords, orchestral strokes, dis-harmonization, shouts out at a world of disorder- which is precisely the world that King Lear inhabits.  The musical disruption, perfectly echoes the internal dislocations within the abdicating king as he is betrayed by his oldest two daughters, and, essentially failed by his youngest.

To match the harshness of the music, the staging (especially the sets) are equally disruptive.  A revolving stage keeps the background moving and changing, from one bleak minimalist set to another.  And very little color- most of it is washed out greys and blues.

Through this storms Bo Skovhus as Lear (note- not King Lear, except in the background sets).  He is strong and powerful, yet helpless against the forces against hin, especially the elements.  Blow winds indeed- he is helpless against Nature, and against his own failings.  Skovhus is excellent- chilling, compelling, frightening.  (One interesting element here, is that Lear is, of course, meant to be elderly and frail- physical and mental.  But Skovhus is anything but- red hair (despite the lyrics referring to white hair) and physically imposing.)  This duality underlies much of the power of this staging, and Skovhus is excellent.

The others, with whom I am unfamiliar, were equally good.  No issue here at all.

As for its Shakespeare aspects, for most of the opera, it follows the stripped down text quite closely.  In the first act, it appeared that much of the libretto was a straight German translation of Shakespeares text- at least as far as the sub-titles tell me (I don't speak German at all).  Later in the second Act, the text varies much from the classic play, especially how Cordelia is dealt with, and Lears own fate.  But this movement away from the play is not A problem for me.  This is NOT Shakespeares play with music!  This is a very different story, with it essence and characters from the play. And I am OK with that.

A few quick words about the DVD.  The filming was excellent, as was the sound.  A few issues with the sub-titles (not uncommon).

Overall, I thought this was a fascinating work- both as a stand alone opera, AND as an illumination of the classic play in a very different form.  (And, one always wonders what Verdi would have done, if he had ever completed his Lear opera!)  Overall, a very satisfying, though jarring opera!",1445126400,,3141,4.899430740037951
8703385,1,B00TZ47UUK,"First: the good news.  The libretto respects the original.  The singers are more than adequate to handle their difficult (and at times, impossible) vocal lines.  The bad news: this kind of tragedy is simply not appropriate for atonal music (see my review of Brokeback Mountain) .  At times, it was more like a disconnected screeching (the daughters, of course).  NO costumes, practically no staging.  I feel that 12 tone music has ruined opera, but worse: stage directors are doing everythiing possible to bury ithe remains as fast as possible.  Yet, I'm glad to have suffered through it--now I now what to avoid like the plague. Kudos to the singers, who have to do whatever they can with this kind of production.",1439942400,2,714,4.851239669421488
8703386,5,B00TZ47UUK,"This is a reprint of my review in the WholeNote Magazine of Toronto, ON, Canada, June-August 2015 issue under their Copyright.

Shakespeares King Lear was an obsession with Berlioz and even more so with Verdi who, as the legend goes, threw his half written score into the fire in a fit of self-disgust. It took 100 years and two world war disasters before German composer Aribert Reimann actually succeeded in writing an opera suggested by Dietrich Fischer Dieskau who sang the title role in Munich, in 1978.  Since then it enjoyed a moderate success around the world, but in 2012 the Hamburg Opera, now under the leadership of Simone Young, very much devoted to the avant-garde revived it with this inspired, completely original staging by Karoline Gruber.
Apart from being brutal and gruesome Lear is the hardest hitting tragedy of the Bard because it hits so close to home. Everyone will sooner or later become old and will sympathize with Lears predicament.  The tragic fault that causes his downfall is self-deception and over-inflated ego that makes him subject to flattery and easy victim to his avaricious daughters. Reimann uses the entire play as his libretto, a play that moves on many

different levels i.e personal, familial, political, psychological and philosophical (one of the most often quoted of all Shakespeare!) and must have been horrendously difficult to come to grips with it. Reimanns expressionist, atonal music, however is so well suited to his subject and so well integrated with it that the power of the play reverberates even stronger than the prose version.
At the head of the young, energetic and dedicated cast Danish baritone Bo Shovkus is one of todays most exciting and original artists who simply towers over this production, but Andrew Watts heartrending portrayal of poor boy Tom  Edgar cannot easily be forgotten. With Conductor Ms. Simone Youngs supreme command over the score (especially in the haunting Intermezzo with its bass flute solo)  this awesome set is much recommended.",1435104000,4,2021,5.090634441087613
8703387,4,B00TZ47UUK,"This opera is dramatically powerful as it is well acted, well sung, and well set.  Needless to say, though, it is in no ways melodic or tuneful. If you can understand German, a pirated DVD of the first performance with Fischer-Deiskau is available. The picture is a bit fuzzy.  The costumes are weird, the sound is inferior, and there are no subtitles but the drama is presented extremely well.",1434412800,,394,4.695652173913044
8703388,5,B00TZ47UUK,"Aside from Macbeth, King Lear is one Shakespeare work that doesn't really need any darkening of the themes or emphasis on the madness, but this is exactly what Aribert Reimann's 1978 opera Lear does. It doesn't so much strive to faithfully represent the dramatic progression of Shakespeare original or attempt to build on its themes and apply them to another context (although it does do both to a certain extent), as much find a musical equivalent for the drama and condense it down into abstract musical structures and intense vocal expression. The result, when filtered through Aribert Reimann's own experience and musical language, is close to terrifying. Which is really just the impression you ought to get from King Lear.

The impression is one thing - and there's little doubt that Reimann's atonal noise can make a huge nerve-shattering and ear-splitting cacophony - but Lear also must engage the audience with its characters, its language and its drama.  And hopefully, as an opera, it can bring something new to the table. The first thing you notice that is going to be characteristic of Reimann's treatment - aside from the difficult discordant music - is the layering in the first scene, with several characters simultaneously expressing their misgivings about the king's actions. That technique is nothing new in opera, but applying it to the density of Shakespeare's characterisation is a challenge. Reimann daringly and successfully layers those contrasting personalities and emotions and allows their musical voices to interweave and clash. The effect is extraordinary.

As thrilling and as astonishing as it is to see such expression in an opera based on a noted work of incredible power, it does however inevitably become more and more difficult to sustain as the drama develops. Reimann is at his strongest in the first half - or at least he's operating at a level that is semi-endurable to an audience who are really put through a dark and deeply disturbing situation. It climaxes at the end of part one with 'Blow winds, blow!"", a scene that according to the composer was inspired by his own experience in Berlin at the end of the war. Here Reimann's music descends into its most cacophonic, the sound of a world collapsing entirely. Thereafter events are less related to the real-world and -in this production certainly - have more of a post-apocalyptic feel, where the world has changed unrecognisably, the characters descending into a monstrous state. Reimann's musical language, or perhaps merely the challenge of listening to it at length, becomes accordingly more difficult.

If the music wavers between unsettling and punishing, it's also a challenge for the singers to work within it and, at its most intense, rise above it. The casting here is superb for the variety of voices and for the sheer force of expression that they are capable of. Lear is not an older man in this production, and it's doubtful that an older man could have the force and stamina necessary to battle with the instrumental madness the way Bo Skovhus does. Yet he never bellows, always showing the underlying humanity in this Lear. It's no surprise that his three daughters all have formidable voices. There's volume and venom aplenty in Katja Pieweck's Goneril and an even more piercing pitch in Hellen Kwon's magnificently scary Regan. Cordelia might be initially reticent in Lear, but by the time she revisits the mad king, Siobhan Stagg shows the full strength of her underlying character. Simone Young's conducting of the Hamburg orchestra through this score is, to say the least, impressive.

The recording certainly benefits from the High Definition presentation on the Blu-ray release. The image is clear and detailed (although a few scenes take place behind a mesh curtain), and the audio tracks (PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1) are well balanced, handling the extreme sounds of the percussion and the high voices very well. The recording can be a little echoing in both mixes, but although the 5.1 mix gives a better separation of the orchestral playing, the focus is better when listened to on headphones. There is a 20 minute Making Of that consists mainly of interviews with Simone Young and Aribert Reimann discussing the history of the work, its composition, and the approach to producing it in Hamburg. The booklet contains a tracklist, a synopsis and an informative essay on the work. Subtitles are in German and English. These can only be selected and changed while the programme is playing, not from the menu. The Blu-ray is region-free.",1432166400,4,4568,5.037037037037037
