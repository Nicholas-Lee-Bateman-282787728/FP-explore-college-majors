Valkyrie being trapped inside a child's body and mind makes us sympathize with her and her situation. The transformation from a child to an adult, including the nudity, is almost a necessity I think considering it's a big deal for her to be able to transform and become an adult again, eventhough it's temporary.
Each episode is full of laughs and heartwarming moments. The cat girls, the UFO girls, the bath house and all the other characters bring this anime together. I highly recommend this anime to a range of anime fans!",1198713600,,640,4.672566371681416
8129160,3,B000G6BM5U,"Pretty average anime. Though the characters are fun and colorful. Also the over all character design is delightful.

I mean the characters are adorable! The UFO girls all have these really cute little wings on their heads... very fun! There is a scene where they are demonstrating flight with these little wings that is laugh out loud fun.

There is one thing I thought was pretty silly. In every episode they show, at least once, a transformation with unneeded nudity.

The transformation is always a repeat or filler type of stuff...

It reminds me of the Voltron formula... in Voltron the formation of the ""Blazing sword"" was always two things... a repeated animation that we had seen in every episode and a sign that the bad guys were gonna get smoked...

The child to adult transformation with unnecessary nudity is exactly that formula... repeated clip of the same transformation and the targeted problem is about to be eliminated. Same thing over and over.

The story is about a bath house so I'm ok with that level of nudity. But the transformation of characters from children to adult is truly unneeded, non story driving, fan service that to be honest isn't done very well.

Over all a fun box set. But lacking ""maturity"" for my tastes. By maturity I mean the target audience was teenaged boys for sure.

I own the complete collection on this. I'm not unhappy I bought it, but I know it will just collect dust on the shelf.",1195344000,,1433,4.681274900398407
