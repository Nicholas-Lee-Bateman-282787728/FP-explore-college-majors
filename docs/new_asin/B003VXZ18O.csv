8407178,4,B003VXZ18O,"I admit it, I watched this for Joanne Kelly (Julia), however I enjoyed it with it's quirky sci-fi/fantasy feel to it. I kept expecting Phil's problems to be an elaborate hoax fabricated by his ex, Julia. I don't think people are supposed to take this as a serious film. I mean really, how could one take seeing a vulture on the remains of a car, seriously? If you're looking for a nice, escapist movie, this is worth it. Don't take it too seriously and hopefully you'll enjoy it as I did.",1492300800,,488,4.373626373626373
8407179,2,B003VXZ18O,"Curious to find out what the heck was going on in this film. Plot, acting, script all seemed low budget. Ending didn't make sense either.

Overall, movie good for background sound but not worth trying to actually watch.",1450396800,,219,4.7631578947368425
8407180,4,B003VXZ18O,"The editorial description nicely summarizes the premise of this thought-provoking film, so there's no need to rehash it.

""Remembering Phil"" begins with a Twilight Zone vibe, a story we *think* we've seen before. But it takes a sharp left-turn after he meets Debbie, who guides him on a journey of self-evaluation and self-discovery. His journey has many head-scratching moments, but everything becomes clear in the film's closing moments, as Phil is confronted with an inescapable truth about himself.

And, ultimately, Phil's situation may make you wonder: ""Will anyone remember ME?""

Highly recommended.",1376438400,,606,5.565217391304348
