8018971,4,B0001ZMXKY,"Sherlock Holmes Volume 3 TV Classics, 1954 film

These four episodes are part of the thirty-nine episodes produced in France for television. They are in English, but you can hear some actors speaking with a very slight accent. These lower budget productions have humor not found in earlier stories. This DVD from Alpha Video has only four episodes, as if it was copied from a videotape. These mostly original stories are serious, not a parody. Their quality varies, but all are worth viewing. They are not in the original order, a number in brackets identifies their sequence. The actors are Ronald Howard as Sherlock Holmes, Howard Marion Crawford as Dr. Watson, and Archie Duncan as Inspector Lestrade (and others).

8018972,4,B0001ZMXKY,"This Volume 3 is a surprisingly sharp & clear presentation of the 1954-55 SHERLOCK HOLMES TV series, much better that the presentation on the Madacy 20 episode DVD set.
This is also an improvement on Alpha/Gotham's first two volumes, which were mixed from acceptable to passable.  These seem to be direct Film to DVD transfers, the first two volumes look like 3/4 video tape was used as the master source.

HOWEVER, be aware that the first episode on this disc, ""RELUCTANT CARPENTER"" is mastered from a splicy print. The other three episodes are quite clean.

The program line-up:
RELUCTANT CARPENTER
PERFECT HUSBAND
ROYAL MURDER
SHY BALLERINA

Highly recommended over the Madacy release. I would choose these less-compressed 4 title DVDs over Madacy's crammed DVD set.",1108684800,6,769,5.128
