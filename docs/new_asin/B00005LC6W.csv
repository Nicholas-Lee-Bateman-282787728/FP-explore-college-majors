1621279,1,B00005LC6W,"Ignore what everyone is saying--I think they are ads placed here by workers for Boogeyman.  They even have that ad push.  I saw an example of this at the Fangoria convention and received a sampler.  It seems like a cheap way to make money.  Why would I want to see the murders without the film?  The context is gone and it is not very scary.  I found the clips rather short and silly.  I am a gorehound, but only with the story attached.  Not very entertaining.  SOme of the facts?  Jason uses a machette.  Freddy Kruger has a glove with knives.  Wow, that is insightful.  Don't buy it because that means more will come out of movie clips and not movies.",1001462400,,654,4.305785123966942
1621280,2,B00005LC6W,I don't know what thes eother people are talking about. This dvd is just commercials strung together and some of the pop up videos aren't right. I got a free copy from my brother and it's not all that great. Just rent the real movies. I am surprised to see it for sale on amazon. I'm glad this was for free.,1001116800,2,307,4.049180327868853
1621281,5,B00005LC6W,"Boogeymen slashes cheesy moments, slices boring dialogue, hacks dull pacing, and yanks out the bloody guts of each classic slasher film.  It contains scenes forever etched into our minds from the best horror icons.  It's a new innovative concept that's clearly its own phenomenon.  It horrifies, petrifies, tears your soul apart, and keeps you on edge every second.  Its well-crafted and just the right length.  Horror lingers in your mind long after youve watched it - PERFECT for a Halloween party.  I cant hide my enthusiasm for this DVD!!!  Nothing shocks like the experience itself  so GET IT NOW!!!!",1001030400,10,605,5.040404040404041
1621282,5,B00005LC6W,"Wow, this is the most amazing DVD I have bought to this date. Not only was I stunned by seeing all of my favorite boogeymen, but they also included one's that I had never heard of but was morethan happy to have seen and been introduced to. The bonus materials were absolutely terrific. Hearing Robert Englund's voice still makes me quiver as I think of him as Freddy. This is a must have for any horror fan or movie fan alike. I just can't wait to see what these people come out with next, I'm sure I will be the first to order it!!",1000857600,11,532,4.125
1621283,5,B00005LC6W,"What can be said about the upcoming dvd entitled ""Boogeymen?"" I'm real happy to see something like this come out, the horror genre needed something like this.
Some of the scariest scenes in horror history, what a great collector's item for horror freaks everywhere. It has some of the most well known/terrifying horror icons ever to grace the screen.
Packed on to a bloody dvd, with so many extra's it scares me. I for one am really excited about October, 2nd. The official release date of ""Boogeymen.""
The only question is fright fans, can you handle the horror? I know i can, just be sure to turn off all the light's, lock the door and don't look under the bed!!!",1000166400,8,665,4.55
1621284,5,B00005LC6W,"This is very cool! I was at the Fangoria convention in Pasadena and saw a sneak of this DVD. It's basically the ""greatest hits"" from the greatest horror movies from recent years, as well as a few classics. As I watched it with other conventioneers, it struck me what a great party DVD this was. People were cheering as each great boogeyman came on screen - Pinhead, then Freddy, then Chucky, then Leatherface - a regular parade. So I'm excited to get this for my own Halloween party - just throw it on and let it play.
What's REALLY cool though is all the extra stuff. There's an audio commentary from Robert Englund, and he's really quite good. There's also movie facts about each scene you can turn on or off, and a trivia game and cool name-that-frame game. Since I can't always watch DVDs in my dorm if someone else is watching the TV, I can pop this into my DVD-ROM and access the DVD-ROM features, which are pretty cool. All in all I was pretty impressed by what I saw, and am excited about getting my own copy. It would have been easy to just throw on some ... scenes and make a long horror commercial, but they really put a lot of thought and effort into making this very cool. I'm a real horror fan, so I am happy to say it delivered the goods. I definitely recommend.",999648000,47,1277,4.3029045643153525
1621285,5,B00005LC6W,"THis DVD was so good. I enjoy all the scary scenes. It was a wonderful creation of how they (producers) pulled from the best horror clicks ever made. The best part is mid-way of the movie. I don't want to give it away, but you MUST SEE if for yourself. Definitely ***** stars. I recommend this movie to all of the viewers, get it for you DVD library, call up the crew and get SCARED!!!!!!!!!

I LIKED THE SCENES, AND MOST OF THOSE SCENES WERE FROM MOVIES I REALLY SEEN AND ENJOYED IN THE PAST. EVENTHOUGH I'AM NOT A DIE HARD HORROR FAN I THINK BOOGEYMEN IS A GREAT COMPILATION FOR THOSE NEUTRAL WATCHERS. I REALLY THINK BOOGEY WILL BE USED FOR MANY HOLLOWEEN PARTY'S, OR FOR THOSE FRIENDLY GET-TOGETHERS. SOME SCENES IN THIS COMPILATION I'VE NEVER SCENE BEFORE AND WERE PROBABLY THE FEATURES I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT IT. OVERALL, I LIKED IT AND WOULDN'T MIND WATCHING IT AGAIN.",998265600,5,557,4.752577319587629

Imagine taking the most frightening scenes from your favorite horror movies and having them all together - Jason, Freddy, Michael Myers, Leatherface, Pinhead, Chucky etc. - in one DVD.Boogeymen has 18 scenes in all and they really did pick the best ones.  In addition to the classics like Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street , there were some really freaky scenes from movies I have never heard of. It also has some pretty cool extras like pop-up trivia for each scene, audio commentary by Robert Englund, interactive horror trivia games, and a very cool ""Legends of the Boogeymen"" which is basically histories of the characters themselves. Boogeymen is also a great way to introduce someone to horror; it's like horror 101.  And it's a total Halloween party DVD. It's fun to re-live some of these famous scenes and to discover some new movies you've never heard of. I definitely recommend this.",995500800,42,944,4.820987654320987

1621317,1,B00005LC6W,"Why 1 Star? Pulling this out of a bargain bin is OK but there isn't much meat to this compilation. Seventeen horror villains are included here in brief scenes showing them killing or torturing their teenage victims. A few favorites: Norman Bates, Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, and Jason Voorhees. There are some strange choices too (The Ugly, Wishmaster, The Guardian, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Dentist, The Puppetmaster). The ""Over 3 Hours of Entertainment"" advertised is really a 57-minute compilation of horror clips, name that frame trivia game, trailers and an audio commentary for each clip by Robert Englund. It hurts me to rank this 1 star because I love horror movies but freaks can give this one a pass because you have seen it all by now. I've put this on during Halloween and it still cleared the room.

This DVD does have some excitement to it but doesn't hold up like it did when it was released in 2001. Back then there wasn't much available for horror freaks so it was a welcome addition (but 3-stars at best). YouTube and other services have replaced clip and trailer promo pieces like this. It doesn't have much to it other than select scenes, biographies, trivia and most of the trailers for each movie. The clips selected are fairly good but not all are impressive. It's hard to call this the ""Killer Compilation"" because the meat isn't there, there is no overall narrative, and the choice of clips is questionable. One of the bonus features is a trivia game which was fun but it's not something you would play more than a few times.",1351123200,,1565,4.670289855072464

1621320,5,B00005LC6W,Great if you're a horror movie buff. This DVD gives you a little preview of the best horror villians. I highly recommend this DVD (not a movie). It'll make you want to go out and buy the horror flicks you haven't seen. Thumbs up!,1326758400,,229,4.2272727272727275

1621322,5,B00005LC6W,"I was 10 years old when I originally bought this DVD 9 years ago at Suncoast for 20 bucks. I was always interested in horror films but was much too scared to ever sit down and watch one. This collection of 20 short scenes was exactly what I needed. I could take small doses of the horror at my own speed, which eventually built myself a tolerance up to where I can now watch any horror film and not even flinch. The Boogeymen DVD got me into the horror game. Will it get you in as well?",1285718400,,486,4.020618556701031

Great DVD that should be in every true horror fans collection.,1277596800,,355,4.235294117647059
1621324,5,B00005LC6W,"Boogeymen: The Killer Compilation is a great DVD for horror fans. It has everything you would ever want in a horror compilation. All it takes is 58 minutes to see clips featuring your favorite Boogeymen including Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, Leatherface, Pinhead, Chucky, and more. You will also find a hidden clip from Jack Frost 2. Go to the trailer section in the bonus features (the one that features trailers from Jurassic Park 3, American Pie 2, and The Mummy Returns). Highlight ""Upcoming Flixmix Titles"" and then press the right button on your remote. Then, Jack Frost 2 will be highlighted and press Enter.

This is a must in any horror dvd collection!!!!!",1126396800,3,464,5.283783783783784
1621326,4,B00005LC6W,"First off I will say that this DVD is only for Horror movie fans. It is not a documentry, what it is a 50 minute long main presentation of the best horror movie icons. and it shows a quick intro of that charactor, then an actual scene of one of the films they where in, and then moves onto the next... there's ALMOST all the fav's of the horror genre....

- Jason Voorhees  (Friday The 13th)
- Freddy Krueger  (Nightmare on Elm St)
- Michael Myers  (Halloween)
- Chucky  (Childs Play)
- Blade  (Puppet Master)
- Leprochaun  (Leprachaun)
- Leather Face  (Texas Chainsaw Masacre)
- Fisherman  (I know what you did last summer)
- Ghost  (Scream)
- Candyman  (Candy man)
- Norman Bates  (Phycho)
- Simon Cartright (The Ugly)
- Pin Head  (Hellraiser)
more...

But they have forgotten about a few that I thought should have been included...

- Skeleton Zombie  (Return Of The Living Dead 1 + 2)
- Ghoulies  (Ghoulies)
- Carrie White  (Carrie)
- Evil Dead  (Evil Dead Trilogy Villians ect..)
- Critters  (Critters)
- Wicked Witch  (Wizard Of Oz)
- Crypt Keeper  (Tales from the crypt)
- Michael Jackson  (Moonwalker)

The extra features are an Audio Commentary by Robert England (Freddy Krueger) which isn't something you'll listen to again I don't think, and you get an on screen trivia option which disaplys bits of information about the movie as it's playing the clip, i'd recomend you turn the trivia on and listen to the commentary at the same time to kill 2 birds with one stone.

There is a trivia game that is not worth looking at, you press start and it shows a picture and you just have to select what movie it's from, but there is no point, you can anser as many as ya want, it doesnt lead you to anything!

There is a biography of each of the people from the feature presnatation.

and Trailers to a couple of the movies on the feature, but not all of them.

There's also a link for anyone with a DVD on there computer, and your usual subtitles, 5.1 surround ect....

Overall: like I said, if you like horror movies, then you might like this if you care to know a bit of information on the films that you probably already knew, other wise it's not worth much, just seeing scenes from films together on one DVD is ok, but not lastingly thrilling, the scenes they chose couldve been better, they have picked some lame scenes to show in some areas. It would be great to see all of these horror icons meet on the big screen in an ultimate horror icon battle royal, but with all the copyright hassel to do something like that, this is most likely the closet we will get to see all of them together on the one show. I would recomend you rent it before you decide if you want to buy it.",1103155200,5,2684,4.376518218623482
1621327,4,B00005LC6W,"This past Halloween I found myself in a query.  I wanted to watch a horror movie but I didn't know what I was in the mood for, and since I had to answer the door every so often I really didn't want a complex plot.  I found ""Boogeymen"" in my collection and said PERFECT!  And I was right.  Little doses of Freddy, Jason, Chucky, Pinhead, Micheal Myers, Wishmaster, Leprechaun and many more, go a long way.  The Trick or Treaters enjoyed seeing clips of these horror greats and I think I have found the perfect thing to play each Halloween.

A little weak in the department of leaving out some forgotten killers Angela Baker (Sleepaway Camp) or Ricky (Silent Night, Deadly Night), maybe even throw in Pumpkinhead.  Putting Ghostface in this film was not that great of an idea, hint: ghostface was played by numerous different characters, not just one killer, not like Leprechaun or Leatherface.  Why throw in the Dentist and not Dr. Giggles.  This movie missed out some other popular characters (Carrie, Cujo, Rev. Kane (Poltergeist)), but I suppose that if they threw everyone into one film there would be no sequel. All in all, it was well put together for what they did. Buy it?

There are alot of treats on the DVD,like an animated trivia that shows up on the bottom of the screen,detailed character backstories,a name that frame game,original trailers and audio commentary by Robert Englund who we all know as Freddy Krueger,the commentary makes the DVD so much fun to watch because Robert Englund is also talking about how much fun he had watching these movies or making them. Out of all the Boogeymen on the list,the one that surprised me the most was the fact the Norman Bates was on the list,which pleased me alot because he's my favourite horror film character.

It claims to a sort of ""Best Of"" horror compilation, but nothing could be further from the truth. While it does have some pretty impressive villains -- Jason Vorhees, Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, etc. -- it also has some characters I'd never heard of before -- Simon from ""The Ugly,"" for example. Unfortunately, all the ""special scenes"" they've picked for the Giants of Horror lack any real terror to them at all. I was particularly disappointed by the scene taken from ""Nightmare On Elm Street."" They could've done much better! It also includes original horror movie trailers (nice), a biography of each Boogeyman (nice), and an special game you can play on the DVD (lame).

1621345,3,B00005LC6W,"Everybody knows what this video is about so I won't get into the explanation of it all.  For starters we have the super killers: Pinhead, Freddy, Leatherface, Tall Man, Norman Bates, Jason, Candyman and Michael Myers.  With the exception of Jason, they all have great scenes (was it really necesary to show the beginning of Friday IX?  I mean theres much better stuff in the sequels). Then we get the ones I consider ""middleweights"".  This consists of Chucky, Simon, Wishmaster, Camilla and Blade.  Their scenes are all great, and I'm especially glad to see such a great film as The Ugly covered in this video.  Then there's my complain of the video: the addition of Ghostface, Leprechaun, the Fisherman and The Dentist.  These guys are the losers of the bunch.  I would have rather seen some zombies (there's many to choose from), the Evil Dead, and the REAL boogeyman of horror films, Pumpkinhead.  It shocks me he wasn't added.  How bout Henry?  Can't get realer than that.  And for the European flavor, why not put the many gloved killers of Dario Argento?  Or how bout the owl-masked butcher in Stagefright?  Oh well, I guess they added the Scream element to sell the tape.  Thank god they didn't put the one from Urban Legend.

Jason Vorhees, Michael Myers, Leatherface) with some relatively unknown film slashers like Simon (from The Ugly) and Camilla (from Guardian), the latter which I don't think deseveres to be in this DVD at all as she wasn't that much of a killer. However, the DVD does deliver the goods as far as blood and gore are concerned. In fact, the ""Puppetmaster"" scene in particular made my stomach flip a good number of times. Not for the squeamish.

While the DVD features such legends as Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees, the scenes picked for them were awful, weak, and BORING. I couldn't believe how little attention was given to these guys. Overall, I was disgusted -- the real stomach turners are the Hellraiser/Puppetmaster scenes which prompted me to trash the Taco Bell I brought home for lunch. Some unknowns and ""unimportants"" (as I'll refer to them) are also featured, but as their scenes [stink] and I haven't seen the films they star in, they matter little to this [poor] compilation.

It has seventeen different movie scenes from some of the greatest horror movies ever made. This DVD actually prompted me to put together a huge horror collection. This was the start of it.
Imagine having Jason, Michael Myers, Pinhead, Chucky, Freddy, etc. all together on one DVD. The DVD has limited extras but who needs extras when you have the most legendary names in horror. There is no boring in between scenes. It's just the good stuff. You know, the stuff horror movies are made of. THE BLOOD AND GORE.
This DVD actually contained some horror movies that I hadn't seen like Wishmaster(Which was awesome) and The Ugly which I still have yet to see. I am hoping they make another DVD like this. I thought maybe we could see scenes from movies like The Exorcist, From Beyond, Carrie, Jeepers Creepers and Jaws to name a few. Until then, make sure you see this compilation.

1621352,4,B00005LC6W,"This is a very enjoyable and entertaining project. As you probably know by now, it contains various scenes from a whole bunch of horror films. All of your favorites are there. Classic baddies like Freddy, Jason, Michael, Chucky, and a slew of others are there for your horiffic pleasure. The negative things about this film is that there are some questionable choices for clips from some of the films. A typical horror fan could've done a better job picking some of the clips. There's also a few films in here that make you wonder why they were included. Does the sight of Corbin Bernsen as the Dentist scare you?. I didn't think so. But, that brings us to a different issue. What really is horror?. Is it just one thing?. Is it supposed to be just one type of horror?. Can it be anything?. Horror is whatever you want it to be. Doesn't mean your gonna be right. Go out and ask a bunch of people what horror is and your likely to get a number of different answers. Is it straight forward bloody, violent, savage type films like ""The Last On The House"", ""I Spit On Your Grave"", or others?. Is it suspense horror like ""Jaws"" or ""The Silence Of The Lambs""?. Is it relatively goreless suspensers like ""Psycho"" or ""Halloween""?. Is the ""Scream"" series horror?. The answer to all above is a resounding ""Yes"". It's all those things. It's not one thing. Never has. It can be more of a psychological character study, or it can be a maniac sawing people's faces off, using their eyeballs for earrings, and stapling them to trees. There's no right or wrong here. Some diehard gorehounds refuse to acknowledge anything that doesn't feature human bowels falling out or nutcases eating people's innards. They say that's 'proper' horror. Please. That's no more 'proper' horror than saying polka is 'proper' music. Horror is different things to all different people for different reasons. This collection of horror is a testament to all of the different and varying levels of horror that the genre has. There is something here for all types of horror fans. As I get older, I don't care about gore anymore. I could care less about how high the body count is. It just has to be fun. Entertaining. If it's actually good and smart and well done, hey, even better. I care more about the set up. The build up. The suspense. It all serves a purpose to someone. I know some fans are very hard nosed when it comes to what's horror and what's not, and that's fine. They just need to know that there's more to it. There's more going on. It shouldn't necessarily be mocked or dismissed. The most laughable thing is when someone calls themself a ""True Horror Fan"" and goes on to boast their certain taste and bash others. People, there is no such thing as a ""True Horror Fan"". Such a person does not exist. Nor does ""True Horror"". They are only entertaining and satisfying themselves. Just realize that horror is all kinds of things. If you can't, then you really don't know all the things the genre can bring. You are totally missing out!. It's your loss. From ""Dracula"" to ""Halloween"" to ""Psycho"" to ""Friday The 13th"" to ""Scream"" to ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", it's all horror. The walls that some buffs/gorehounds put up to seperate certain styles of horror only damages the genre. It hurts it. The horrible segregation they create is like poison. So, in the end, this is a pleasant companion piece. Horror legend Robert Englund provides commentary. Who better?. The guy has the perfect voice for it.

Boogeymen was a good idea. Gather together some of the best clips from classic horror movies and put them all together for the first time. Some of the clips are classic, and the best from their series (Halloween, Hellraiser, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Nightmare on Elm Street) but there are far too many un-scary clips from good series. Most noteably, the clip from Jason Goes To Hell. I'm sorry, but you could pick a better Jason moment than the opening to Jason Goes To Hell (The sleeping bag scene from Pt. 7 would suffice). Plus there are far too many UN-scary moments from UN-scary movies such as Scream, Wishmaster and the godawful antichrist of horror, I Know What You Did Last Summer. There were a few interesting clips from movies I have never seen before -- The Ugly and The Guardian, but overall, this video lacks anything exciting. I found myself very bored with it by the second viewing. The trailers at the end are pointless, and not all of the movies' trailers are even there! I plan on selling this tape and re-buying it when I get a DVD player, because I am sure it is much better.

The selected scenes generally lack any scares and come from some of the poorer movies in their respective series (Childs Play 2?  Jason Goes to Hell??).  The video quality for some of the excerpts is substandard, considering the fact that most of the movies' prints have been cleaned and transfered to DVD before ""Boogeymen's"" production--Texas Chainsaw is one example.

Also, beware of the 5-star reviews here.  I find it odd that they all have virtually the same length, written style, and end with a glowing snippet for the DVD.

1621390,3,B00005LC6W,"I found this feature to be a very enjoyable usage of my time on the two occasions I watched it. Boogeyman is a collection of video/audio cuts from a variety of the most influential and popular recent horror movies to splatter across the screen in the last two decades. Many ""cult"" classic as well as some commercially successful features make up the ""Boogeymen"". It is broken up into one section per character and these characters are viewable separately or one after the other as a continuous movie.

Ok now that I have explained some of the content or at least the basis of this feature...onto the goodies!

There is running audio (that can be turned on or off) commentary by Wes Craven (better known to some as Freddy Krueger) offering his insight and personal opinions on the movie scenes as well as the people involved in the making/starring of scenes. He does a great job and keeps the movie flowing with his great insight and overall enthusiasm for these scenes.

Something else as a goodie I found enjoyable is the ""pop-up"" tidbit information accompanying the scenes. All kinds of useful little facts and trivia for Horror buffs to digest makes the viewer aware of things they might not have known otherwise. This adds to the fun of the feature.

There are character Bios for all the ""boogeymen"" present here and a little name that scene trivia game that can be play separately from the feature.

All in all I give this movie 3 stars and think other fans of this genre will find it informative and fun. If anything play it on screen during a halloween party for something to run in the background.",1003968000,,1605,4.637323943661972
1621391,2,B00005LC6W,"I have been a big fan of the horror genre for nearly a decade. When I heard about this DVD, I was thrilled to hear that some company would be putting out a compilation of great horror moments. Unfortunately, this DVD, while well-meaning, is a weak. ""Boogeymen"" features essential horror icons like Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Michael Myers doing what they're expected to do (kill people). Aside from the canon, the makers of the DVD decided to include the ridiculous bottom feeders at the butt of horror nerd in-jokes like the husky-voiced cousin of Jambi from ""The Wishmaster,"" the adorable midget from ""The Leprechaun,"" and the Gordon's fisherman from ""I Know What You Did Last Summer."" Add in some obscure indie horror clip (""The Ugly,"" which does look interesting) and some straight-to-video shocks (""The Dentist"") and one is led to ask if this truly is a collection of ""the greatest hits of horror"" it so prominently touts on the back in all caps. Where ""Boogeymen"" fails is in its lack of quality film clips. With only a single brief scene for each of the 17 frightmeisters crammed into just under an hour the discriminating horror buff is definitely not getting enough blood for his buck. With the storage capacity of a DVD, is it too much to ask for multiple clips for each character? The clips themselves range from being great (the first slashing from ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and the last scene in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") to being just plain goofy (The Leprechaun's laugh-inspiring pogostick murder comes instantly to mind). Still, the extra features do add some life to this bloated corpse of a DVD. Along with optional in-feature trivia and DVD-ROM extras, the shining gem of the special features is Robert Englund's colorful audio commentary. With corny jokes and interesting annecdotes, Englund makes even the worst parts of the main feature seem watchable. You don't, however, judge a DVD solely on its special features. Apparently the first volume in a possible series of DVDs, perhaps the makers of this edition can learn from their mistakes when crafting their next killer compilation, ""Boogeymen Vol. 2: Electric Boogaloo."" Until then, rent the originals.",1003968000,,2193,4.994535519125683
1621392,3,B00005LC6W,"I must say, I enjoyed this ""Boogeymen"" disk.  It was a lot of fun watching as a different killer popped up on the screen.  The first one is Pinhead (from Clive Barker's Hellraiser) and the last one is Michael Myers (from Halloween).  Some of the killers are very cool, well known horror icons that are actually my very favorite (such as Leatherface, from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or Freddy Krueger from A Nightmare On Elm Street), but others are really stupid and boring- try hard ""Boogeymen"" (The Guardian, Leprecaun, Candyman).  It's still really great fun watching theses clips.  If you get bored, or have seen one clip to many times, simply skip to the next clip.  However, there weren't nearly as many features as I thought there would be.  There's a cool commentary by Mr. Robert Englund (if you're a true horror fan, then you know who he is!), where he comments about certain movies, and why he likes them.  Occasinily he's very funny, and I felt reasured when he said Freddy vs. Jason WILL happen!  Other extras include a few theatrical trailers (NO theatrical trailer for Jason Goes To Hell The Final Friday, however!  I makes me mad!).  Also are ""Flixmix Recommends"" where you can watch trailers for The Mummy Returns, American pie 2, and Jurrasic Park 3.  BY THE WAY.....  THERE'S A HIDDEN SCENE FOR ""JACK FROST 2"".  Here's how you get to it.  At the top of the Flixmix Recommends menu, there's a little thing that says 'Upcoming Flixmix Titles"".  Highlight this (so that it's green) and press the right arrow on your remote.  Then, it'll say ""Jack Frost 2"".  You may have noticed in the movie itself, on the end credits it has cast for ""Jack Frost 2"".  If you were wondering why that's there, it's because the scene's hidden.  I hope that helped.  Other extras include a ""Legends Of The Boogeymen"", which features breif descriptions of their histories.  You can also watch the movie with ""Flixfacts"" on.  Flixfacts pop up every scene or so and say things like ""It took 500 gallons of fake blood to make Nightmare On Elm Street"".  Nothing to exciting.  For DVD Rom, you get a trivia game, and some cool sound effects.  But, it really nothing so exciting that it's something you must buy.  I don't think so.  There are not THAT many features.  The movie IS only 58 minutes. After you've watched all the scenes and all the trailers, it's kind of silly.  You'll say ""Why did I buy that?""  It's a TERRIFIC movie to rent or for a party.  But, why but it?

The DVD has lots of extras, and I'm terribly impressed. The unknown (to America) film THE UGLY looked most interesting, and was impressed to know that the lead actor won awards for the portrayal. Jason & Michael Myers are only slashing madmen; F. Kruger had sophistication; Chucky & Puppetmaster involved possessed inanimate objects...etc. Somewhat out of place was Norman Bates, Tony Perkins' brilliant and complex performance in the only truly Grade A film of the bunch.

Let's have more, but let's also keep it diverse and interesting. More of the same (slasher) would be perhaps a bit redundant. I'm glad for the inclusion of ""Phantasm"", one of the true originals!",1003190400,,1674,4.795847750865052
1621396,3,B00005LC6W,"I bought this VHS the other day, and I must admit, I was a little disappointed.  I was hoping that more in-depth commentary would be available on the movies that these Boogeymen were in.  Also, they left out some of my personal faves(Nicholson, Lugosi, Karloff, Cheney)and there was only one entry by Hitchcock.  While they did get virtually most of the heavy hitters (Jason, Freddy, Michael-my fave!), they also put in the guy from Scream and I know what you did last summer(come on, were those two REALLY that scary?).  If you want to see a classic on horror movies with some great commentary, rent or buy a copy of ""Terror in the Aisles"" circa 1981 with Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen.  It's a little dated, but it also hits all the old school legends.  Happy Halloween!",1003190400,,775,4.62043795620438
1621397,5,B00005LC6W,"As a horror fan, I really enjoyed this collection. I disagree with some of the detractors that say the scenes are too short or aren't bloody enough. All the scenes are about 3 or 4 minutes long, and there is PLENTY of blood. (Did they SEE Hellraiser and Chainsaw Masaacre?) What I like about this collection is that the scenes are representative of the best horror movies, and there is variety between them. So you get the KILL shot in Hellraiser, but maybe in the Friday the 13th scene you get the iconic Girl-Chased-Through-the-Woods scene. I like the fact that not only do you get Freddy, Jason, Michael, Pinhead, etc., but also Grandaddy Norman Bates and older school-but-still-scary-as-hell Tall Man and Leatherface. It really is a fun, well imagined collection of scenes and horror villains, and the extras make it worth the price of admission (or purchase).
I also like the idea below of throwing this on at a Halloween Party, and I plan to do just that at my own party. It is fun, well done, and honors the horror genre.",1003104000,,1028,4.653846153846154

So I rented it to gather my own opinion.  This dvd is very incomplete in my opinion.  It shows 16 rather short clips from various horror films that left me feeling empty and void from any kind of entertainment.  The concept was good but executed poorly.  Maybe they'll get it rite next time.  There should have been more than one clip from each movie, and having said that, let them be the complete clip.  Many of them just kind of stop in the middle of a scene leaving you saying, ""What the hell was the point of that.""  There are some interesting extra tidbits but not worth the money of purchase.  I consider myself a pretty big fan of the genre starting from a very young age but this dvd in my opinion was just another way of cashing in on some horror icon faces that doesn't hit it's mark.",1002844800,,968,4.333333333333333

Not merely an appetizer for the included films, this DVD strings together the best (and almost best) moments from the iconic horror films from the past 25 years. That by itself is fantastic, but the EXTRAS are what make this such a must-have, especially for the price.
Despite what a reviewer below says, the audio commentary by Robert Englund is wonderful. Between his comments and the flix facts, i got a nice dose of horror info on my favorite horror films. I even learned a few things. The trivia game was fun, Name that Frame was cool, and I especially liked the Legends of the Bogeymen, which is basically a bio of each of the nightstalkers in the collection.
This is pure entertainment, containing the best scenes with lots great extra features, and it's just plain a lot of fun. Anyone wanting more than that at a price like this is missing the point.

1621410,5,B00005LC6W,"Ah, finally some kind of redemption for the studios pushing back both the new ""friday the 13th"" & ""Halloween"" movies until next spring.  This little DVD may not have EVERYTHING, but it has enough.  Anyone who says this DVD is too short, too brief, cannot possibly be a true horror fan.  You have to appreciate this for what it is, a GREAT collectors party disc, and basically a review of WHY we love horror films! Its not meant to contain every scene of our favorite flicks, just the realllly good gory parts of them! :o)
The triva section is good as well, although I will admit the screen test is pretty easy since all the stills are from the clips on the DVD.
The quality of the menu and selections are outstanding.  I think that its a very well researched disk.  The ""legends"" sections are fun to read, and the bonus original trailers of seleted films are cool as well.
All in all, if you really like horror movies, you'll really like this disc.  I really can't see how anyone could be really disapointed with this, its alot of fun to watch and something to keep us busy till they release ""Jason X"" and ""Halloween: The Homecoming""",1002672000,,1133,4.449275362318841

Not only do they show the scariest scenes these ""boogeymen"" have to offer, but the special features will have you pinned as much as the scenes themselves. Audio comentary by robert englund, unknown facts that make you better appreciate the movie, and the best part - the complete legend behind each ""boogeyman,"" which definately clears up a lot of misunderstandings. Flix Mix has a good thing going, and i look forward to see what else they have to offer.

1621412,1,B00005LC6W,"I orderd the DVD the day it went on sale, and got it over nighted to me. To say I looked forward to this was a understatement. I am a huge horror fan! HUGE! And my favorite films are Halloween and Friday the 13th. When I saw the trailer for the video/dvd on E!, I was so excited about it. I couldn't wait until it went on sale the 1st. So I get it, and I take it home and turn it on. Now let me say this first, I knew it wasn't the full movies, however, I thought it would be clips from the movie...more than 1 clip, or atleast more than 45-60's of clips for each movie. So I turn it on, and I start it up and it starts. First character is Pinhead, they show a 60-80 second clip and move onto Freddy. They show a 45-55 second clip. It goes on and on like this for the whole movie. Short meaningless clips, I think the body count through the whole movie was 5. Including 1 death of a quote-unquote monster, Carmilla. Who honestly, I never heard of. And some clips are just straight stupid, ""I know what you did last summer"", ""Scream"", ""The Dentist"", ""Guardian"", GIVE ME A BREAK! So we get to the last 2 clips of Jason and Halloween. Jason's clip is 45 seconds, and is the opening screen from Jason goes to Hell: The Final Friday, nice pick of a sceen for Jason...NOT. It picks up as he throw's the chick over the rail, and she runs through the woods, turns and stops, and just as he raises his knife and the lights of the swat team members zoom on, and as they are about to shoot Jason into pieces, the clip ends. I was so disappointed, I couldn't see straight. Then Halloween's clip comes on, it starts right after Jamie Lee tells the 2 little kids shes killed Micheal and to go next store and get help, and then he comes up the stairs, she runs in the closet, he punches it open, and she stabs him and climbs out. Anyway, the clip stays on until Loomis runs in and shoots Micheal and he falls out the window and he looks out and see's hes gone. Longest clip of the DVD was the Halloween clip. All 2:23 seconds of it. They say 3 hours of entertainment, its 58 minutes of clips, then you have to go to features, and turn on Commentary from Robert England(Freddy), and then you can go back to features and turn on a info. box , that gives you tidbits on the movies production and etc. etc. while you watch it. The best past of the movie was when Robert England's commentary was turned on, and he commented on the Jason Clip, saying, "" Freddy .vs. Jason will happen"" The most excited I got all movie, hearing that this will take place. Also, the name the frame game, is stupid..it doesnt keep score, you click scramble, and it puts a new frame up, and you have 7 options. Same 7 options everytime. Also, Trailors do not include Jason Goes To Hell, Nightmare on Elm Street or Texas Chainsaw Massacure. It does contain Halloween's newest trailor, not the original, the newest one which is totally stupid and short. Trailors are ok, movie clip portion is horrible, and basically DVD is a waste. If not for Robert Englund's commentary, which includes jokes and sometimes he actually acts like Freddy which is very amusing, without that this DVD would be the worst thing Ive ever seen. Hopefully, they make another one, because although Im sure this one sold many of copies, they know mistakes were made and I am sure the next one will be great and longer. Hope my review may change your mind on buying a new copy, because ...it is a horrible horrible movie, Id suggest renting it if you want to..but even $(...) may be to much to spend on this piece of junk. It gave a true Horror experience though, the horror of disappointment and bordom.",1002672000,,3633,4.266666666666667
1621413,2,B00005LC6W,"""For the first time ever, the most terrifying scenes from the scariest movies have been brought together in one incredible collection.""
Close, but no cigar here. This collection if for ONLY the most avid and crazy horror movie fans who must have everything. I recommend that, as I did, you rent this interesting collection of horror scenes. The Freddy (upside-down room), Scream (""Ghostface"" chase), and Texas Chainsaw Massacre (final scene) scenes are excellent and classic, while Leprechaun, Jason, and several others are quite sub par. There is some good gore with The Puppetmaster, and there was an introduction to The Ugly's murderous Simon. Overall, disappointing.
The greatest part on this DVD set is Robert Englung's audio commentary. His behind-the-scenes look at several of these pictures, his knowledge of the cast and crew, and his own experiences, bring the scenes to life.
The original theatrical trailers are also very interesting.  (It is a hobby of mine to track down a trailer and see what scenes they chose to put into the trailer.)
Overall, the scene collection is disappointing, with only a few good choices. The audio commentary and extra, though, pick up some of the slack and keep it interesting.
RECOMMEND? Yes--but to rent. It will give a selections of movies to rent if you haven't seen all the movies on this package.",1002672000,,1345,5.058558558558558

The commercial showed clips of some of my favourite Horror movies and so when it was finally released I decided to pick it up. I read on the box that it features 17 movies and over 3 hours of excitment... but I later found out that, that is with everything put together. I liked how they had almost every trailor, the legends and the ""Trivia"" thing. The ""Name That Frame"" was pretty cool too... but the worst part of this DVD is pretty much the whole focus of it. They only show about 3-4 minutes of each movie (Halloween gets about 5-6).. and they show some movies that are really [bad] and I have never heard of like The Ugly, and The Guardian... and some scenes arn't very intresting like The Candyman scene, and I don't know why they put Scream and I know what you did last summer on there, everyone and thier mom has seen those parts over and over again.

1621415,4,B00005LC6W,"What I mean by the title is if your with your buddies watching it, you'll have a riot.  If your watching it yourself, it will be just okay.  So it's more of a party type film for a group of people.  It's not a whole movie at all, but just clips of the more gross, and scary parts of different horror films.
For everyone it seems different on which part is best.  The silver ball in Phantasim made the mocho guys at work cringe and look away.  For me 'The Dentist' made me grind my teeth and growl.  So it has a little something for everyone. There is a feature that you can turn on the subtitles facts about the clip your watching.
And it's actually very interesting to read these quick facts.  Like in Nightmare on Elm Street, 500 gallons of fake blood were used.  Did you know Freddy was actually based on a homeless guy that had a burned face and wore a hat and sweater?  The dude in Wish Master speaks six different languages.  It also has other features on the DVD.
There's some interactive pc games on it I haven't looked at yet.  It does have the standard comentaries.  I didn't see any special audio setup though.  Overall, it's a fun movie worth getting.  I give it four stars for fun alone.",1002672000,,1200,4.252212389380531

All it is are scenes from out favorite horror movie put together in no specific order.  Instead of using imagination and having fun with the idea, all we have are scenes we've seen 300 times already played out once again.  Why not have a collection of the best death scenes?  The best moments? The goriest moments? The best sequels? The best chase scene?  Instead, we get 58 minutes of pure boredom.  Even the extras are kinda weak.  The ""name that fram"" game is kinda cool, but what's with the trailers?  They don't even have trailers for all the movies or the sequels.  And who cares what Robert Englund has to say in a commentary?  If you ask me, this was just a cheap, quickly thrown together piece of crap that was meant to rob us of our money.  And a side note to all Jason fans;  Jason gets the worst treatment when they show a scene from Jason Goes To Hell and then don't even bother to show the full scene, but rather cut away when its getting good.

1621417,2,B00005LC6W,"I got this DVD yesterday and all I can say is I was disappointed. Like many, I thought the DVD would have a collage of kills from each serial killer, instead it only has one kill per ""boogeyman""! And sometimes they're not kills at all i.e. the Scream scene where ""Ghostface"" chases Sidney through her house and no one dies. I think maybe another scene would have served better (maybe Dru Barrymore being gutted and hung from a tree?).
The good thing (and there aren't many) about this DVD is the trailers for each movie. I thought that was a great touch. Even the commentery from Robert ""Freddy"" Englund was a nice touch (although some of the stuff he said sounded like it had been written out for him and he was trying to fit all those words into the scene, being how each scene is about 40-60 seconds long!).
I'll hand it to the people who made this compilation though, they advertised it well, and being that Halloween is right around the corner, they knew there would be a demand for this type of video.
Bottom line, this is best for teens into that ""new wave horror"" like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer fiending for the old stuff they hear their parents talk about. And it's a good way to start their collection!",1002585600,,1229,4.394736842105263

One movie that I did not know about and that was in this dvd was a new zealand movie called the ugly. It looks really good. This dvd had a name the frame game, DVD-rom contents, trailers for some of the movies, Bios of the movies killers. One classic horror movie missing in this collection is Evil Dead. How bout taking The Guardian out and replacing it with Evil Dead. The audio commentary in this DVD was great and there was also a way where while watching the DVD you could see facts from the movie on the bottom of the screen.

 The compilation seems like an hour long trailer. There isn't any kind of continuity to make it a film, its simply a random succession of scary scenes. And if thats what you are looking for, a ""horror sampler,"" then this is a good DVD to watch. But for the average horror buff, to whom it targets, it is basically paying ...to buy scenes you already own.
 The line-up is a little suprising: there are the big-shots (i.e. Jason, Freddy, Michael Myers, etc.), but then there are some goofy choices (Wishmaster, Leprechaun, The Dentist). But the biggest suprise is the New Zeland film ""The Ugly"" which, although is probably a better horror film than most of the others, has very little American followers.
 The best special feature offered is the audio commentary by Robert Englund. If you've seen most of the movies, just watch it with the commentary the first time. Also a trivia game is offered on the DVD-Rom with some good questions for horror buffs.
 If you are just in the mood for some sensless violence, ""Boogeymen"" should quench your bloodlust, but if you are looking for an interesting horror compilation check out ""Terror In The Aisles"" which is much longer and has a much better flow to it.",1002153600,3,1388,4.699588477366255

1621436,5,B00005LC6W,"This DVD has all the best qualities of a great special edition. It has hours and hours of footage, things to do, games, commentary, and things that seperate it from every other DVD I've seen. Pick it up!",1002067200,2,203,4.368421052631579
1621437,4,B00005LC6W,"Overall a good collection of some of the best Boogeymen in horror films, yet one beef I had is that some of the clips give the ending away and may ruin the film for those who have yet to see the film. The DVD also includes a good commentary, slide game and a number of trailers to some of the films it showcases. All your favorites are in there as well as a few you might have overlooked. Makes a great addition to any horror library",1002067200,,433,4.046511627906977
1621438,4,B00005LC6W,"Well I just bought ""Boogeymen"" today.  I just finished watching the movie about 12 minutes ago.  So you are probably wondering how was it?  Well it was pretty good but not the best that I thought it could be.  The thing is... It only shows you ONE yes only ONE scene from each film. On the VHS copy that I bought it has little FlixMix box's pop up about 4 times per scene that showed some facts about a movie... for a example........ THE MAKEUP ON HIS FACE TOOK OVER FOUR HOURS TO DO.  Here are all the scenes from the movies..... HELLRAISER, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, SCREAM, CHILD'S PLAY 2, CANDYMAN, LEPRECHAUN, THE UGLY, WISHMASTER, THE GUARDIAN, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, THE DENTIST, PHANTASM 2, THE PUPPETMASTER, PSYCHO, JASON GOES TO HELL:THE FINAL FRIDAY, HALLOWEEN.  -NOTE- thoses are all of the films.  You will see 1 scene from each of thoses films.
plus theres about 10 minutes of trailers of the films you saw clips from on the VHS tape.  I was thinking if you got the DVD its cool because some of your FAVORITE horror movies never were released on DVD...this way you can see most of them in clear picture.  DONT PASS THIS MOVIE UP.....it's a real SCREAM baby!!",1001980800,9,1212,4.472727272727273
1621439,5,B00005LC6W,"I had this playing on my TV when a bunch of people came over to my house the other night.  Everyone loved watching these scenes - some, they watched over and over again.  Most of the scenes everyone knew (they still got scared) and some (like The Dentist) they hadn't seen and loved.  By the end of the night, everyone was into playing the trivia game - which was surprisingly tough (even for the horror aficionados in the crowd).  Overall, this is definitely worth the price.  It'll be perfect for Halloween!",1001894400,6,509,4.549450549450549
1621440,5,B00005LC6W,"Just received my copy of Boogeymen and I have to say, this is a pretty cool idea. Every scary moment and bad guy is in this thing - from Leatherface to Chucky, Jason to Freddie, Candyman to Ghostface (Scream)! I threw a huge party last weekend here at the college and played this in the background, sound off as I do with other cool ""background"" videos. However, 5 minutes into the video, people were moving from the keg to the couch getting into the trivia game that's a part of it. I now have a video to play at our Halloween party and to give as gifts at Christmas. I also heard this is the first in a series and soon there will be a Best of Fight Scenes DVD coming. Cannot wait!",1001894400,7,682,4.135338345864661
1621441,4,B00005LC6W,"Horror films have been a very taboo film genre ever since their mainstream acceptance in the late 70s and 80s. Unfortunately horror films, moreso than other film types, suffer from ""sophomore death"", where follow-ups seem to write the epitath on an original great film's tombstone. The question now is ""How can I sift through all the garbage to find the gold?"" The answer is on Boogeymen.

This ""greatest hits"" of horror films collection has it all. No longer do you have to watch 10 films to get to one remotely decent movie. You can get Boogeymen and find the cream of the crop all on one disc. Horror figureheads such as Pinhead (Hellraiser), Leatherface (The Texas Chainsaw Masssacre), Jason Voorhees (Friday the 13th), Michael Myers (Halloween), and just about every other Godfather of the genre are explained in gruesome detail along with clips of their handiwork.

For those of you who already have their foot in the door when it comes to horror films, Boogeymen didn't forget about you. Interactive games such as ""Name This Frame"" and animated trivia keep your interest and keep you guessing. And for those of you 'Nightmare on Elm Street' zealots, audio commentary by Freddy himself (Robert Englund) will keep you on the edge of your seat while he offers his perspectives and facts about everything that catches your eye.

Whether you're new to the genre of horror films or an old hand, Boogeymen will keep you entertained with hours of interactivity and entertainment. If this can't satisfy your hunger for the gruesome and horrific, nothing will.",1001721600,15,1557,4.935114503816794
1621442,4,B00005LC6W,"An interesting view of some of the major (and some very minor) characters of modern horror.  Each ""Boogeyman"" is given an intro with some basic information and one of their better scenes.  The disc features a 'fact track' which goes along the bottom of the screen and has some fun information.  Robert Englund provides a very enthusiastic commentary, giving his insight into the different movies.  The only shortcomings are the use of some very minor or obscure characters that slow down the pace (I would have preferred Hannibal Lecter to 'The Guardian') and not enough screen time for my favorite Boogeyman, Jason Voorhees.
All in all, a nice treat with some cool extras.",1001635200,3,673,4.929203539823009
1621443,4,B00005LC6W,"It is a treat to finally cut to the kill in your favorite horror film without having to touch the remote.  Just pop this DVD in your player and sit back with the lights off.  It's almost like Cliff notes for horror.  I enjoyed seeing my favorite killers fed to me a slice at a time.  It brought back memories of all the old films, and some of the new, that I loved so much.  In the next installment, I look forward to seeing a few more scenes from a few less movies, so you can truly get the best of your favorite killer.",1001548800,5,521,3.9711538461538463
1621444,5,B00005LC6W,"I just got my copy and I'm stoked. I disagree with the reviewer who thought Boogeymen was a commercial. Sure, after I watched Boogeymen, there were a few movies I'd never seen before that I now definitely want to check out. But that's not the point. This is the greatest scenes from the greatest horror movies starring the greatest horror villains! If you're a true horror fan, that's the bomb.
But what I REALLY love is all the extras. Robert Englund ROCKS on his commentary. And the Name that Frame Game is like a perfect drinking game (my roommates will vouch for that). And the Flix Facts are very cool - I didn't see any innacuracies, and I learned a few things. And I am a horror afficianado!
Also, kudos to flix mix for the trivia game, and a cool website that's tied into boogeymen. I cannot WAIT for ULTIMATE FIGHTS!",1001548800,6,825,4.470198675496689
1621445,3,B00005LC6W,"Sure - some of the boogeymen choices might have you scratching your heads but you can't resist this slickly produced DVD that's perfect for your ghoulish Halloween bash.  It's got animated menus that burn and crackle with hellfire, some great clips that'll wet any gorehound's appetite (rest assured - this disc is filled with the red stuff!), and it's just packed with ghastly facts and ferocious fun.  In classic Pop-Up Video fashion you have the choice of turning on and off special ""Flix Facts"" that run at the bottom of the screen during the clips.  And, if you're tired of watching the clips over and over, you can flip on the Robert Englund commentary.  Cackling like his crispy alter-ego, Englund provides running commentary THROUGH EVERY SINGLE CLIP.  A good thing and a bad thing.  He drove me a bit batty with his bad puns and Freddy-isms but if you're an Englund fan you're in for a Halloween treat that's spiked with razors.  For years we've been making horror compilation videos at home...now someone's doing it professionally.  Like our ""home cut"" videos, 'Boogeymen' could have used a little more work to make it just right.  But as it stands its got good intentions and a great presentation.  This disc is literally wearing its heart on its sleeve.",1001548800,2,1265,4.814814814814815

I love this and always had since i first bought it on vhs when it came out in 2001 and still have the video with the box intact all in good condition...this is one of the movies i've held on to and didn't lose growing up, now its 17 years later.
I used to have the dvd and also liked the special features on it so i decided to buy it again. for the price i couldn't go wrong.
I just got it in today on my day off and had time to kill so i watched it immediately when i opened it. ( this will always be
