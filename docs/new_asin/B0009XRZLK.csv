8069844,5,B0009XRZLK,"This movie rocks! Don't get me wrong- its badly made and stupid, but so was Shindlers List. Show this movie to your friends, and if they don't find it funny get new friends and try huffing glue. In short 5 stars doestn't do it justice. Somebody give these people money to make more films!",1126742400,7,288,4.351851851851852
8069845,5,B0009XRZLK,"You want swearing? You want violence? You want a monster playing drums? YOU WANT IT ALL? Well you got it. This movie has the most creative use of cuss words I have ever seen. It also boasts some of the worst (read: best) rock music in recorded history. I mean really, can you top the lyrical wizardry of ""I am not a stupid girl, I don't drive a vehicle, I don't want to go to work, you are just a stupid jerk!""?!?! No, not even Bernie Taupin can match that.  Not only is this movie a top notch foray into the much ignored genre of monster punk, but the disc also boasts a crap load of extras. Before the movie, these goofballs had a public access show in Seattle, and there is over an hour of clips from that show and it's almost more funny than the movie!

ps - yes I am writing my own review.",1120780800,10,794,4.050955414012739
