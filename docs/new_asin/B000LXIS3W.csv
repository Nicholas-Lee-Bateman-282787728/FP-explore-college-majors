8165285,1,B000LXIS3W,"Seems like this DVD was made in less than a day with no planning.  Rambling, lethargic, ill-prepared collection of opinions with little content or energy.  If I could give it a zero I would.  Setzer and Reverend Horton Heat style examples don't sound close, surprisingly poor DVD from a professional player.  No meaningful coverage of Travis picking or western swing aspects of rockabilly.  Fred Sokolow and Jason Loughlin rockabilly materials are far better; lots to learn and the authors' love of the style show through.",1420761600,,522,5.094117647058823
8165286,3,B000LXIS3W,Fred explains things very well but I'm afraid didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. This is very basic stuff and apart from the songs chosen could just as well be a primer on basic blues. We didn't stray far from the basic E pentatonic scale,1320710400,5,250,4.340425531914893
8165287,5,B000LXIS3W,"Fred Sokolov  is clear and concise. Shares what you need to know but doesn't leave anything out. I am a beginner, but was still able to follow.",1266105600,8,143,4.296296296296297
8165288,1,B000LXIS3W,"This is absolute garbage, Troy begins by talking about getting the Rockabilly sound and although he uses the right equipment still manages to miss by a mile.
The title claims to recreate the techniques of some great Rockabilly players,one of which being the Reverend Horton Heat which i was very interested in. But again Troy fails miserably (oh how i wish the Reverend would publish a book or DVD).
For anybody wanting to buy a good quality DVD of this style, my recommendations would be after grabbing almost everything i can find on the subject of Rockabilly guitar. Titles by Paul Pigat and Jim Weider, next take a look at Arlen Roth. I know Brian Setzer would seem an obvious place to start, but his technique is rather unusual and hard to pick up.",1221696000,2,753,4.626865671641791
8165289,5,B000LXIS3W,An excellent instructional video.  All the right and left hand techniques were clearly demonstrated and explained for each song.  The music chosen was truly representative of the best of the Rockabilly era.,1210723200,9,206,5.40625
8165290,1,B000LXIS3W,"Hi All,

I got nothing at all from this DVD. To mee Troy Dexter is just showing off in about 45 mins , thats it. There is no usefull breakdown of licks he plays etc. So I guess this isn't really for the beginner into rockabilly. I later bought the DVD with Steve Trovato and he's a much better teacher, and is really breaking down the styles and lick so you understand them. I would definetely recomend that on instead and save $15 for this one.",1186272000,5,445,4.174418604651163
8165291,2,B000LXIS3W,This instructional lacks coaching and floats aimlessly to its end. Rockabilly has a lot of travis picking involved and the instructor ignores this important part only to offer up one of the lamest scotty moore lessons i have ever seen. I may have been spoiled by the Paul Pigat dvd's but this one was clearly a waste of money for me.,1185148800,,333,4.475409836065574
8165292,5,B000LXIS3W,This DVD showed several styles of rockahilly playing. The teacher slowed it down and included a section on jazz or horn chording. A booklet is included to help. I recommend buying a comprehensive book on chord forms to supplement this booklet. Practice the chords until you know them cold. I keep replaying the DVD and discover new things to practice. Very well done instruction by Troy Dexter.,1175904000,4,394,4.895522388059701
