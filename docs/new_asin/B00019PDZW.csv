8555268,4,B00019PDZW,I ordered this video to gain information about the 1960's for a program that we are hosting. It was great learning tool. It put things in chronological order of how they happened and included highlights about some of the most memorable events from that decade. I wish I'd had it a couple years ago when we did a 50's program.,1382313600,,325,4.433333333333334
