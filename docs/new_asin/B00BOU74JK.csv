5662539,5,B00BOU74JK,"This is another character highlight DVD's. This one highlights Pinkie Pie. There are five episodes:

Feeling Pinkie Keen  (the episode where she can predict things with her Pinkie sense and Twilight goes nuts trying to prove it's fake. This has a Derpy scene in it when she accidentally lets a bunch of things fall on her from Cloudsdale)

Party of One  (the one where she thinks all her friends don't want to be friends with her anymore so she, uh... completely loses her mind. This episode was where all the pictures on my little brony with crazy, flat hair Pinkie came from! You know the ones I'm talking about)

Baby Cakes  (the one where she babysits the Cakes new babies, Pumpkin Cake and Pound Cake. She learns how to be responsible)

A Friend in Deed  (the one where she tries to befriend Cranky but finds its not as easy as she thought it would be. Has the song ""Smile, Smile, Smile"" in it)

Too Many Pinkie Pies  (A season 3 episode. The one where she makes a bunch of clones of herself so she won't miss any fun with her friends but too many get created and get out of control)

For special features, there's a sing-along to ""Smile, Smile, Smile""

Then there's one called ""Party Activity Kit"" You put the disc in your computer to access it. There are three printable coloring sheets. One each of Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy and Twilight. Then there's a printable game. It's just like pin the tail on the donkey but instead it's ""Pin the cutie mark on Pinkie Pie"" There's an already colored picture of Pinkie Pie without her cutie mark, along with four copies of her cutie mark. You're supposed to clip them out and attach tape to the back and close your eyes and try to attach them to where they should be on her body.

So yeah, I'd definitely recommend this. Especially if you're a Pinkie Pie fan (obviously).",1368057600,19,1816,4.4832826747720365

8571955,5,B00BOU74JK,"Whilst I'm not a MLP fan my daughter loves them.  She's very happy whilst watching this, and I get a short amount of peace and quiet to do some chores so I guess we both love this DVD.",1409270400,,184,3.8421052631578947

8571957,3,B00BOU74JK,"The episodes contained in this DVD are:

Feeling Pinkie Keen (very funny, but the moral needs work)
Party of One (Absolutely Hilarious, probably in my top five)
Baby Cakes (Meh... Didn't really care about this one)
A Friend in Deed (This one was okay, and it had an amazing song)
Too Many Pinkie Pies (And the list ends with a BANG)

It's good stuff for little girls, but Bronies would be better off with Seasons 1, 2, and 3... and 4 if it finally came out on DVD",1404086400,,463,4.25
8571958,5,B00BOU74JK,"I shouldn't even write this review, I'm an adult :).  When I'm down and out I really enjoy watching a goofy cartoon.  Scooby is my favorite but MLP is so cute.  I'm a sucker for the moral message at the end.  I love Pinkie.  She's so goofy and funny.  So when I feel down I either pop in one of my favorite old movies or a cartoon to make me laugh.  These are great episodes of Pinkie.  I love feeling Pinkie Keen.  I actually DVRed these to keep for when I was in a down mood, but then I needed the space for my horror movies (2 extremes I know).  When I'm upset even my Mom tells me to pop in Pinkie.",1376524800,7,602,3.860655737704918
