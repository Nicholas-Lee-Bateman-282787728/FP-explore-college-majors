8350053,5,B0023S49ZO,"I've always loved this series, so being able to grab it on DVD for such a cheap price was awesome. I'd highly recommend it for any and all Jing fans. Sure, it's only three episodes, but it's an OVA, so that's to be expected. Either way, I think it was worth the purchase.",1377302400,,271,4.132075471698113
8350054,4,B0023S49ZO,"Jing, the King of Bandits, and his feathered partner Kir, are enjoying a stay at Seventh Heaven, the most notorious prison complex in the world. But they aren't there to relax and play around, they have work to do! Jing has come to Seventh Heaven to steal the Dream Orb from their fellow inmate, Campari. But Campari is prepared to meet them and trapped them in a dream world created by the orb. When dreams are as solid as reality, how do you tell the difference?

Before watching this OVA, I had watched the original King of Bandit Jing anime and read the first manga series and part of the second. So I was already familiar with Jing and the story of Seventh Heaven. But the thing that makes this story cool is the dream world, which really comes alive in this OVA. The story is much like any story in the original series, Jing steals stuff and kicks butt. It doesn't reveal anything new about Jing's past and has no lasting impact on the overall story line. But it is a fun adventure, and at 3 episodes, probably the longest story arc in the series.
I recommend watching this in Japanese, as the voice actor for Jing in the English sounds a little too old to be a kid. As for the value of the DVD... it doesn't have much on it other than the OVA. But if you think of it as a movie - it is 90 minutes - then the price seems very reasonable. You don't need to have watched the original series to understand and enjoy this OVA, so if you want a fun jaunt through a dream world prison, this is the show for you. If you enjoy it, then go get the original series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jing-King-of-the-Bandits-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B000AP31HY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jing - King of the Bandits - The Complete Collection</a>, which is more of the same bandit fun.",1288742400,2,1821,4.672897196261682
8350055,5,B0023S49ZO,"This is kinda like aladin but different n much better seris starts out about a young boy who is a thief and works his charm and street smarts to acomplhis his goals on what he is after. In the story our hero helps others along the way as he steaks what he is after alot of comendy and action the story comes together well. The hero This ova explains more then the seris about jing and how him and his bird friend came to be more then the seris these ova fills in the holes of his past and why If anyone read this is worth buying the story line is strong everything falls in its place for the price you cant beat it. This anime is alot different then others its scifi or westerner its more midle east setting it offers everything you could want in a anime the story gets to the point about who jing is I do recomend you buy both to get the full complete picture because the ova and seris go together one will fill in the questions about jings past. Id buy this again I thought the preview of it was interesting and nice enough for me to buy it,worth buying",1286064000,,1055,4.076923076923077
8350056,3,B0023S49ZO,"Having never seen any other King of Bandit Jing, this was a good introduction.  it gave me a taste and a story with out having to get invested in the whole series.",1282608000,,163,4.09375
8350057,5,B0023S49ZO,I felt like this had a lot of Hayao Miyazaki feel to it. I'm sure they got a couple ideas from him and mixed it with their original film (2005) to make this. This seems way better than the original. This has such an interesting story line. The animation is up to date and awesome. Great characters. Not too confusing ( a little but far less than the average Anime). Very enjoyable.,1267920000,,381,4.305555555555555
8350058,3,B0023S49ZO,"Next up on our tour of the world of anime takes us into prison- literally.  Only unlike your usual gray walls, steel bars, and orange jumpsuits, here in Seventh Heaven we have a prison setting that looks like what you might expect were you to take a look into the recesses of the Joker's cerebellum.  And while I typically fancy myself a fan of anime that could very well have been born over a late night with a pot of coffee within the NASA space center, it is a bit interesting to take on titles that appear as though they were the product of a continuous two-day frat party complete with acid trip.

Released across a single disc (packaged with in a standard-sized dvd case), Jing King of Bandits Seventh Heaven consists of three episodes (OVAs) at a total runtime of 90 minutes.

Extras come in the form of production art galleries and Funimation title trailers.  The show wears a conservative TV PG rating that likely has more to do with the craziness contained within than it does nudity, violence and so on (since there really is none here).  There is a little innocent suggestive dialog thanks to Jing's bird sidekick but hey, it's a talking bird people- there's only so much ""Polly want a cracker"" that modern audiences can handle.

Language options are typical sub and dub meaning the choice between running the original Japanese dialog or an English dubbed version and the option to show English subtitles over either track.

Alas we come to the story- yes if only I could have spent this whole review discussing the technical facts and stats... The story has moments of genius that can become lost to the complete random insanity in the foreground.  Before we go there, however, there is a plot here worth mentioning:

Jing, crafty criminal kid known widely as the Bandit King, allows himself to be captured and sent to the isolated prison Seventh Heaven in order to get the drop on the newest target for acquisition (the Dream Orb).  Why go to prison to get this item you wonder? Well that's because it's currently in the possession of the magician convict Campari, who uses it to tap into a person's dreams to allow others to share in the experience.

With Kir, Jing's slightly perverted parrot companion, our hero lands himself in the slammer where he gets caught up in Campari's dream sequences and hence that brings us back to those insane sequences I mentioned above.  Expect such things as a cigarette smoking winged baby toting a shotgun, a man with a skull filled with toys, a vampire for a warden and so on.

Ultimately though, there is linear progression within the madness and believe it or not, it's a fairly solid prose.

Pacing is quick and furious as you might expect for a set that spans only 90 minutes to tell its whole tale.  The visuals are a unique blend of CGI sequences and colorful stills with special attention presented to the backgrounds.

Music work is quite well done as well with upbeat jazz tunes working perfectly with the onscreen mayhem.  The dub is solid but clearly an ADV work as it isn't quite as impressive as the usual Funimation efforts.

In all this is a fun exercise in the fact that anime isn't limited to any singular segment of the entertainment spectrum.  Recommended to anyone looking to experience a wild party worthy of any frat house without suffering the hangover.",1245110400,2,3329,4.667808219178082
