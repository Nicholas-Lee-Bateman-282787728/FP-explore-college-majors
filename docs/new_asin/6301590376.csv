334366,2,6301590376,This is an edited shorter version that the original seen on HBO. They cut out completely the part where the mistress has a son that comes back and writes his name on the family tree at Bagatelle. I was very disapointed.,1032134400,8,219,4.365853658536586

7812733,4,6301590376,"I bought this to replace the original tape which was worn and hard to hear but playable. The original was about 5 hours long, and this is 2 hours and 10 minutes, so there is a lot missing, which is my only complaint. Otherwise, this ""readers digest"" version shows a good story line. If someone wasn't aware of the original, they may wonder about certain parts.",1373414400,,360,4.46969696969697

7812735,5,6301590376,"I love this series made for TV. It is the great tradition of ""Gone With The Wind""..Margot Kidder is absolutely wonderful. Only flaw I can see is that it is not in caption. They really should release it like that for your hard of hearing customers.",1336694400,4,247,4.391304347826087
7812736,2,6301590376,"product was late in getting here, (due to bad weather though) was very very faded-almost black & white with crayons on it.  I got my charge out of it though, I had to look at it as though I rented it, however I was hoping it would have been great so I could have kept it for othr to see.  Oh well, it was an old video. Supplier was ok though, no problem with seller.",1299110400,,366,3.8666666666666667
7812737,3,6301590376,"This 1984 made for TV movie is an epic saga love story. Set in 1800's Louisiana. Starring Margot Kidder ( superman) and Ian Charleson ( chariots of fire) The movie was based on the novel by Maurice Denuziere. The video length is  130mins. The high quality VHS release is by Orion home video.
The film have never been released on DVD. Which is a shame.

Louisiana is an epic tale of life in the old south during the mid 1800's. It depicts the prewar period of wealthy landowner, lucrative cotton plantations, and extravagant southern ladies. However the life enjoyued by the rich southern families is soon destroyed following the devastation and hardship brought on by the Civil War. Virginia Tregan ( margot kidder) is a beautiful yet willful and almost ruthless woman who struggles to maintain her position and possessions during this time of crisis. There are obvious similarities to this films lead character and the famous film ""Gone with the Wind"". Fans of Gone with the Wind will still enjoy this film. IT is a well produced movie with lavish costumes and set designs.",1210204800,7,1074,4.8
7812738,4,6301590376,"I first viewed this film shortly after it's release in the eighties and found it refreshingly different from most love stories. After viewing it again as a mature adult, my feelings haven't changed.  The difference between true love and lust is very plain as the main characters understand that caring for someone doesn't always involve sleeping with them in order to find deep fulfillment in their relationship and in life.  The pitiable character of Ian Charleson is ably portrayed and Margot Kidder does a great job of fighting her attachment to a man she can never physically have but in all other manners, is life committed.  A moving film!",1070064000,6,645,4.89908256880734
