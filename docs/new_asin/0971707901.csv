7802180,2,0971707901,"I have a PhD in Clinical Psychology. I purchased this to use in the classroom. I just watched it in it's entirely. I must say, I was hugely dissappointed. I enjoyed Dr. Lipton's presentation, except where he indicates that the autistic child has not had enough love. Hogwash. In my professional experience, I've not found that to be the case at all and this is placing a huge guilt trip, unwarranted, I might add, on the hard working and loving parents, if which I have witnessed many. But the real fly in the ointment is Rob Williams. He sounds like so many snake oil sellers that I have come across. That Lipton would choose to associate himself with Williams has me questioning his judgement. Had I have been aware of this, I'd never have purchased this DVD.",1522800000,,761,4.562043795620438

Dr Lipton was a researcher and scientifically has proven what the neurons, etc do when we experience different emotions and how that changes the chemicals produced by our body.

I have the book and the this DVD -- there is allot of rhetoric and the only one with much to share is Bruce Lipton he is an excellent teacher.  However, forget anything regarding Psych-K for self-help purposes... they are out for your BUCKS!!!  They give no details - no teaching how to ... so I contacted one of their ""Facilitators"" [that is what the like to call them] and they want you to pay several hundred or more... for sessions with a lay-person who most likely attended one of his weekend courses for a few thousand.

I did contact one of these Facilitators who is actively advertising on YouTube for Psych-K sessions...  and before any sessions could begin this person did not follow through on promises and commitments...  and when I questioned same... this facilitator verbally attacked me in an e-mail which I have kept for proof.

I am currently researching how to contact Mr. Robert Williams and let him know that he has some ""Wild-Card Facilitators"" out there attacking/abusing his clientele!

Boy... do I have a bad taste ... after this one!  I just consider myself blessed and that God caused this person to tip her hand as to the Wolf in Sheep's clothing that this facilitator is... before I sent her the big $$$ she wants!

I think I am going to give the Healing Codes a try... Alex Loyd seems to be upfront and an open-book which usually is an indication of good intentions.  And with the Healing Codes You do not have to pay high-prices for workshops with lay-people who already paid for a weekend and now get to charge you a couple hundred per session... like you do with PSYCH-K.  It appears that PSYCH-K works but unfortunately it also appears that for the person who created it... it is all about money... and not all about helping others... as it should be.

Overall... I think it is so sad that people have to get rich off of the sick and needy...  wonder what their Judgment Day will be like... you reap what you sew... and it is easier for a Camel to walk through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.",1376956800,11,2094,4.4619422572178475
7802185,5,0971707901,"Dr. Bruce Lipton is a leading professor regarding cell biology. If we want to understand us better this is the book you are looking for. Ample information on perceptions , the way we think, where these perceptions come from, what to do with these perceptions, how to change them in case they are of negative nature. Very valuable contribution for our evolution.",1371859200,,361,4.838709677419355
