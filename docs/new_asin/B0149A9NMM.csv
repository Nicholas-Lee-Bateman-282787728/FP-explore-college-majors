8730098,5,B0149A9NMM,"Occupied is a Norwegian made TV series, that is obviously mostly spoken in the Norwegian language (there is a bit of English since it is a common second language when communicating with Russians and other European countries), but you'll mostly be reading English subtitles. Based on an idea by popular novel author Jo Nesbo, and made by the people who made the original movies based on The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo books, this is also according to the back of the DVD cover, the most expensive Norwegian TV show ever made. I'm pretty doubtful the last claim is true since this is a character based tension series rather than a huge special effects show, but this shows, you don't need special effects to make a great TV series.

With Occupied, basically in the near future Norway elects a Greens type of political party to govern, on their promise to take action against Climate Change which is having a huge detrimental impact on Norway.  They decide to stop producing oil and tell the world short term pain from no oil will be better in the long run as it is forcing alternative energy research to be fast tracked and implemented, they even have their own discovery which they are exporting to the world. Civil wars in the Middle East have meant oil can no longer be sourced from there either.  The European Union demands Norway put their oil rigs back online and imposes strict economic sanctions.  Norway ignores these demands, so Russia with Sweden by its side does the world a favour by invading Norway and taking over the oil industry.  It is not stated if the Russian oil fields are not viable anymore of if they just don't want to lose out on continuing to sell a now obsolete product and are really more concerned with stopping the alternative to oil from being produced. But the result is the Norway government publicly backflips on their policy and denies their country is being occupied, stating they are accepting Russian expertise to get their oil industry running again.  The Norwegian citizens do not believe a word of it. Chechen and other refugees who fled Russian occupation in their own lands no longer feel safe in the streets of Oslo, and even Russian citizens themselves in Oslo are feeling the hate.

It's a simple concept for a TV show, but it just works.  It obviously raises a lot of questions that can be applied to real world tensions in the world as well as politics and even Russia's current occupations of countries that don't want them there like the Ukraine, especially the Crimea region.  One question raised would be what is the point of a small population country spending a lot of money having an army, airforce and navy, if you're not going to use them when invaded because you don't have a chance of winning against a much larger enemy?  This TV is told from Norway's point of view, we don't really touch on the European Union side of things, where you would think there would be much opposition from Baltic countries, which were formerly occupied by Russia for years such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.  Whereas this TV show it's pretty much just painted as the EU as a whole backs what the Russians are doing.

Unfortunately there aren't any extras on the region 4 DVDs, the episodes are divided over three discs, all up they go for 447 minutes (so just under seven and half hours).  Obviously a bit less when you fast forward the opening and end credits of each episode, they also have the British TV show summing up what happened previously before the episode storyline starts as well.",1471046400,,3536,4.665594855305466
8730099,2,B0149A9NMM,"This show started out with such promise but ended up boring us to tears with talk, talk, talk, and then, more talk. Fine acting and a script without
any swearing (oh what a relief!) or unnecessary sex scenes just isn't enough - you've got to have somebody you like, somebody to root for. Neither
of us gave a hoot any one of the characters.",1465862400,,340,4.328125
8730100,5,B0149A9NMM,"Wonderfully complex and layered story with terrific production values and terrific performances.  For those who want to see a clear cut ""right and wrong, black and white"" story, look elsewhere.  For those who are intrigued by an intricate, intelligent story and equally intrigued by characters displaying every shade of grey imaginable, this is a series for you.  Who will end up on ""the right side of history""?  Can't wait for season 2 to find out for myself.  If your tastes align with mine, you are in for a great ride-along.  Start watching now.",1458345600,,549,4.849462365591398
8730101,5,B0149A9NMM,"Jo Nesb, the Norwegian author, who is so very popular all over the world, has created a new TV series that is ground breaking. I was immediately drawn into this ten part series. The writing, the acting are so well done that it will soon find much acclaim. For those of us familiar with Jo Nesbo, this series more than lives up to his books.

In Norway, a new Prime Minister has been elected, he is a member of the Green movement and has declared all oil and gas reserves will be removed.  The US has become independent and resigned from NATO, the EU is very unhappy with Norway's stance and has invited the Russians into Norway to smooth the regain of oil supplies from the North Sea. The reality of Russia in the Scandanavian countries is too real, and this series has caused much controversy. As time moves on a movement called Fritt Norg or 'Free Norway' is instituted,and now an unclaimed war has begun. The prime Minister tries to lead, his body guard turns out to be a perfect foil to meet with the Russians because they trust him. We meet a journalist who is looking for stories, and he and the Prime Minister lock horns at each turn. The journalists family plays a big part in this series, as does the family of the  body guard. Intricate sideline stories with the Russian Minister who is a beautiful, intelligent blonde, the people of Norway, Fritt Norge, and the Russian military all play large in this series. This is an intelligent, exciting and nerve wracking series. I am encouraged enough to hope that Series 2 is in the works.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-24-16",1453593600,5,1580,4.552816901408451
