The Video finishes with the very complicated and intriguing ballet. Truly amazing dancing by the whole company.
Filmed in 1983 with very good visual and audio quality.",1213315200,9,425,5.071428571428571
7803781,5,6300174921,"This is such an exceptional video.  Sadly, no information is given about the video on this page. I'm taking the liberty of citing below the information on the back of the video box in the hope others might discover just what a treasure this film is!  Unlike many documentaries, this one has a felt intimacy as one watches the dancers rehearse.  Interview segments with Baryshnikov are also characterized by a lack of ""celebrity self-consciousness"" and simply focus on dance.  The insider-look at Choo San Goh's choreographical work with the dancers is fascinating -- and quite moving as well.  For anyone who loves the dance, this video is an absolute must! Marianna Tcherkassky is a sparkling presence who, like Baryshnikov with his unique style of dance, stays with you long after the tape is over.
From the back of the box: ""Filmed in 1983 by London Weekend Television, the tape opens with Baryshnikov performing a virtuoso solo from his commissioned ballet ""Configurations"" choreographed by Choo San Goh to the music of Samuel Barber.  We see that same solo two more times -- in rehearsal with the choreographer and again within the context of the ballet filmed at its premiere at Brooklyn Academy of Music.  ... ""It's a dense tape, not only revealing the many sides of Baryshnikov, but also the secrets of success for any artist.  There are moments of reflection on his early training in Russia and stunning excerpts are shown from ""Corsaire"" and other Baryshnikov performances. ... At the peak of his form, Baryshnikov, as Antoinette Sibley from the Royal Ballet says, ""uses the air the way most of us use the ground.  ... Includes the complete ballet ""Configurations,"" featuring the American Ballet Theatre with Marianna Tcherkassky.""",1046563200,58,1741,5.017361111111111
