8117339,3,B000F4RHV6,"Courtroom antics surround the jury involved in hearing an embezzlement case. A shy accountant (Bronson Pinchot) in one of his 4 roles in the movie is charged with the crime, but during testimony by a very sexual secretary (Tracy Scoggins), he is painted to be an extravagant lothario which gains him press coverage and sudden adoration of women in the street.

This prompts the judge to sequester the jury, setting up conflict and shenanigans with the jurors. A feminist (Lynne Redgrave) battles a developer (Alan Thicke), a waiter (Stephen Baldwin) chases a hooker (Heather Locklear), and a bellhop (Pinchot) pursues a housewife (Graff).",1392681600,,638,5.194174757281553
8117340,3,B000F4RHV6,"What we have here is a mostly successful TV movie casted with people from then current ABC series. The charm here is the number of good performances. William G. Schilling (""Head of the Class"") is marvelous as a lonely widower who becomes a voice of wisdom for several of the younger jurors. Bronson Pinchot (""Perfect Strangers"") shines in four different roles including a dead on parody of Geraldo Rivera in his self-absorbed media period (he's much more palatable on Fox News these days). Reginald VelJohnson (""Family Matters"") who plays the judge is always a delight - remember him as Gus the limo driver in ""Crocodile Dundee?"" And whatever happened to the drop dead gorgeous Tracy Scoggins (""Dynasty: The Colbys"")? This movie is predictable in spots but overall a fun ride.",1318377600,,776,4.976923076923077
