8393576,5,B003BFUS8K,"Of the productions of ""Parsifal"" that I've seen on disc (including both the earlier and later Bayreuth issues and the NY production with Kaufmann) this is by far the best (I'm not counting Syberberg's film, which, though more than worthwhile, is a different kettle of fish). Meier delivers an extraordinary Kundry and Salminen's Gurnemanz is also a standout. As for the orchestra, it is true that the timpani are too loud, but otherwise Nagano and the orchestra give an admirable performance and the technical quality of the audio recording is far superior to the other editions, as is the videography. Lenhoff's staging is coherent, free of gratuitous absurdities, and often very beautiful.",1527638400,,691,5.178571428571429
8393577,3,B003BFUS8K,"it's contemporarily staged. the sound is good. Actually though I like the ""film"" version by Syberbourg, also available on Amazon (only available used last I saw).",1459209600,,162,5.269230769230769
8393578,1,B003BFUS8K,"I just saw the incredibly wonderful Met production of Parsifal live in HD yesterday (March 2, 2013).  I played this blu-ray afterwards and could not believe my ears.  The conducting is shockingly bad.  The timpani are WAY TOO LOUD, and certain instruments are put to deaf, so to speak.  I don't mind the costumes in this blu-ray production at all.  The stage direction was pretty insipid, however.  Amfortas is portrayed as a sniveling coward in Act III after he first appears on stage.  The Bayreuth 2012 production ARTE broadcast is available on youtube and, even with its ridiculous staging, is far superior to this production.",1362268800,10,630,4.942857142857143
