The director does a fantastic job of allowing the audience to bask in the glow of the innocence of childhood. Kids who see this completely understand it, and adults are mystified by the dreamlike quality of the storyline. The heartbreaking, sweet & surreal ending is a tear-jerker...so be prepared.

5469154,3,B00AQ6BCGO,"This is a Korean import. (See item description). The image quality is crappy! It looks like it was mastered from a blurred video tape of an extremely dirty, dusty print. Too bad. It was a childhood favorite.

Don't get me wrong. It is watchable. It's just that in this age of digital film restoration this DVD is clearly sub-standard. And I appreciate a clean, sharp image!

As I recall, the original soundtrack was a solo piano. Am I mistaken? I just associate this film with a definite piano theme... This version features an orchestral score.

It also features a couple of awkward/film-break edits. Overall a dissapointment. I'm going to return my copy.",1139529600,40,656,4.839285714285714

5469179,3,B00AQ6BCGO,"Like one of the other reviewers, I ran into problems with the two special features, but while they didn't play at all on his system, I got audio but not video. That said, the two main features-- The Red Balloon and White Mane-- played. True, the main menu does not permit selecting chapters, but the chapter advance controls do work. The picture quality for this Blu-ray is a real improvement over the Janus (Criterion sponsored) issued standard definition versions. The issuer of this Blu-ray edition, Network Releasing, responded to my complaint that it is licensed only for Region 2. However, that info appears nowhere on the packaging, although with a magnifying glass, I could see ""SD 4:3 PAL"" listed for those special features. I guess that means that the main features are All-Region encoded.",1285545600,9,799,4.970149253731344

I have tried the play button many times and it just won't start. Is just goes back to the menu - Please feel free to leave your comments here and I will notify the Manufacturer.

I have a new SONY bluray played DBP-S550 with the latest firmware installed. I have around 200 bluray discs and they ALL work on the special features section. Except this one.

Anybody else have this problem?

If anyone is expecting new millinium, clear as day picture, they will be dissapointed.  But if you're like me and absolutly need to seek out your old favorites to take a trip down memory lane this is a joy and a bargain.

5469195,5,B00AQ6BCGO,"I recently bought this edition of The Red Balloon DVD as a gift for an 8yr old, and placed it in the DVD player for a few seconds, just to make sure the DVD was good.

I was captivated right away and ended up watching the whole movie. The shiny red balloon took me through THE most charming streets of Old Monmartre (what a treat that was to see the old Paris),and the little boy who found the balloon was absolutely adorable and so very talented.

This is a story of love and friendship,and of the ultimate sacrifice for love and its joyful rewards-I found so many allegories wrapped inside this superb film.  Lovely story, mesmerizing cinematography, lovely music, and I didn't mind at all the tiny nicks on the screen from the tranfer of the original onto DVD-it actually added to the mystique of the film, and made me even more aware of the fact that someone created a thing of beauty 40 years ago,",1165449600,2,902,4.421686746987952
5469196,5,B00AQ6BCGO,"Ever watch a VHS to DVD copy? only to find fuzzy/grainy picture quality?

MANY of our favorite movies are in this condition and some will continue to be like this for many years to come, for legal or neglect issues. I have found a way to vastly improve the picture quality with an easy fix/adjustment. This fix is NOT ment for everyone, rather more for collectors that have the budget and passion. You must have a front screen projector and DVD player that has a (+) or (-) Zoom. This investment was well worth it even without this trick.

Here's How:

1. On your DVD Player remote, Zoom out (-) to make the picture SMALLER. As it does so the PICTURE becomes VERY clear. But the picture is smaller.

2. Now using your Front screen projector remote, Zoom in (+) and make the picture BIGGER. As it does so the CLARITY STAYS THE SAME AS THE SMALLER PICTURE ! ! ! Except that now the picture is bigger and really clear.

I have never seen the fix/adjustment discussed anywhere, and I'd like to get other's feedback on this neat trick.

I can't tell you the shock - - - of seeing ""Come Back to the Five & Dime Jimmy Dean, Mandingo, and The Red Balloon so perfectly CLEAR!!! I had them for two years and suffered with the bad transfer from VHS to DVD. Sometimes our favorite movies take years to get the full DVD treatment, and meanwhile we suffer with poor grade foreign and bad VHS to DVD transfers.

THIS IS AT LEAST LASER DISK QUALITY AND WAY BETTER THAN ANY VHS COPY.

Please give it a try and tell other's . . . . Mike

5469197,4,B00AQ6BCGO,"My grandson loves the book Red Balloon by Albert Lamorisse, as would any child. I remembered seeing the short movie years ago and loved it. I wondered if it might still be available in some alternate format, and of course Amazon.com was one way to find it. Although a bit grainy (it is an old film), it still has the same magic as the original and is wonderful to view with the book in hand to point out scenes that match the film. I would have rated it 5 stars had the film quality been a little crisper, so don't let the 4 star rating dissuade you from a purchase.",1163030400,4,566,4.154545454545454
5469198,5,B00AQ6BCGO,"The last time I saw this film, it was on a projector in 3rd grade. Now I am a 3rd grade teacher and bought it to show my class on DVD.  Such a good story without using words.

5469200,1,B00AQ6BCGO,"...when applied to this DVD.  It would appear to have been transferred from a VHS copy.  It's so soft as to be impossible to watch.  I hope the director's family (he died in 1970) is simply holding back the original masters in hopes of making a deal for an authorized DVD version.  ""The Red Balloon"" is such a wonderful little movie -- perhaps the best introduction to the cinema for any child -- but it is almost destroyed by the condition of the source used for this transfer.  Can't we have a version that matches the film's vision for its 50th anniversary?",1157155200,23,560,4.450980392156863
5469201,2,B00AQ6BCGO,"I bought this because the reviews for another, earlier version, the Korean import DVD, bemoaned that one's poor picture quality.  When this one became available, I hoped it was a legitimate and faithful DVD.  But this one looks terrible too.  I see I am not the only person still waiting for a clean restored print on DVD, one worthy of both the original and of today's technological capacity to render it in all its beauty and glory.",1156377600,24,434,4.6103896103896105
5469202,5,B00AQ6BCGO,"I went to see this wonderful film at the cinema on Easter Monday, April 22nd, 1957, four days before my tenth birthday and it certainly looked a hundred per cent better than the transfer on this DVD.

In fact, for those of you who have seen both the American and Korean DVD's of this wonderful film and are very disappointed, as I am, by the deplorably bad condition of the very worn print used for the transfer (filthy condition; full of splices and heavy rope scratches, with the end of the film cutting off abruptly due to print damage) please be advised to try and find the UK VHS video version, issued on Braveworld in 1992 and now deleted. It sometimes turns up on eBay and was transferred from an excellent condition print that looks a whole lot better than the one on the currently available DVD's. So a better print DOES exist somewhere. Perhaps Braveworld, if they are still going as a company, could reissue the video on DVD. The catalogue number of the video is STV 2098.",1151193600,14,983,4.4916201117318435
5469203,5,B00AQ6BCGO,"This film is an absolute work of art! It tells the beautiful story of a young boy and his only friend: a big red balloon. Their friendship is true and the living balloon follows the little boy wherever he goes. They play with each other, trust each other... they are together for good!

A very simple and beautiful story... one that makes you remember how good it is to be a kid. ...all the possibilities... all the imagination and the innocence we lose when we grow up. This film will touch everyone who sees it.

The only problem is the print they used for this DVD. Absolutely horrible! Full of scratches and marks... (there are silent films in better shape!) it seems someone dragged the film stock on a street to make it look bad. I cannot believe such an important film had such a lack of caring. The soundtrack is also bad and the rich Technicolor is gone. I was lucky enough to see this film on the big screen during the seventies and... believe me... it was beautiful. Nothing like this.

I knew this print was bad because I read the other reviews, and yet, I bought it because I felt I must have it (for I love this film). But it was still shocking to see how bad a bad print can be.

I think this film is a masterpiece and I will buy it again if this is ever restored and released again... but this is an european film and I do not see that (restoration... or a new print) coming soon. So I bought it anyway - think like this: not even in France this film is available... go figure why!

A beautiful film that is worth every scratch... but it is a shame... Films like this one should be seen over and over and I am sure if it was to be rereleased it would be a success. Perhaps one day someone like Criterion (who for once released it in Laserdisc a looong time ago) will take this film and give the treatment it deserves.

By the way, the american edition of this DVD (no longer on print) came with an american animated cartoon : ""The Pincushion Man"". It is about a ballon-like city with ballon-like characters. The print was equally bad. It is an early thirties ""silly symphonies-like"" color cartoon produced by Castle Films. The film is nice and it leaves you wondering about how many great films are there left to rot. ...",1146700800,17,2237,4.30166270783848

8556100,5,B00AQ6BCGO,"Note: this is a review of the Network Releasing Blu-ray that contains Red Balloon and White Mane and some great extras. This is a superb transfer on both titles, the best I have ever seen on disc or TV (looks restored/remastered). There are other reviews that say it is bad, but they refer to a DVD released by a different company and should not be considered a review for this product. It is an import but is REGION-FREE and the main titles should play on any US Blu-ray player. Some of the extras are PAL and may not play on some TVs but should play on any PC. Red Balloon has little dialogue but what there is has forced English subtitles. White Mane has no speech or subtitles.

8556102,5,B00AQ6BCGO,"I have seen this movie many times and never fail to enjoy it.  In  addition to the charming story it gives a very good picture of what life was like in the Paris suburbs of the 50's, children going to school, buying a pastry in a shop, etc.  I have only one quibble: I have read many reviews and not one of them is even curious as to the technical aspects of the movie, that is, how did the director get the balloon to do his bidding? Certainly he did not use digital graphics. That was too soon for that.  Did he use double imaging of some sort? Was the balloon in reality a cartoon? I don't think so.",1423958400,,602,4.033613445378151

8556105,5,B00AQ6BCGO,While the Criterion DVD of THE RED BALLOON and WHITE MANE is very nice I would haft to say this Blu-ray import is even better! THE RED BALLOON is simple one of the most beautifully photographed Technicolor films in motion picture history and it shows on this Blu-ray edition. WHITE MANE also looks every nice. The two featured films play fine on Blu-ray players. The two included documentaries are in the Pal format and won't play. However my mother was able to make a digital copy of these. The one about THE RED BALLOON child as a man showing his daughter where and how the film was made is a joy to watch. Shot with a video camera it is simple a beautiful record of a father sharing his love for film with his own beautiful child. The extra on WHITE MANE is not so enjoyable as the man who as a young lad who had the lead in that film is no fun to be around. He doesn't want to be photographed and he isn't very helpful to giving information about his early experience.,1409961600,,972,4.2594594594594595
