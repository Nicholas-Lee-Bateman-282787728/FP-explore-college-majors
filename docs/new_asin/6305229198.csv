He had a nice match with Shamrock and a very quick match with bossman.
Most of the matches on this ppv are raw type matches.
It was an avserage tournament and it was one that could have been better, if you love The Rock i would purchase this as he and Mankind have a very good match at the end.
Rock does win but not the way you would hope. They re-enacted Bret's 97 screw job.

It's a shame  that people have access to the records of the next coulpe of WWF  pay-per-views because it ruins the surprise. But watching this one LIVE was  amazing. Going in to this event Vince McMahon has helped Mankind qualify  for the WWF Title tournament being held at this event. The main  participants in the tournament to crown a new Champion are: Austin, Taker,  Kane and Mankind. With the Corporation more powerful now then ever before  it looks like Mankind could become the new Champion, then a new, more  cunning, more shocking plans unfolds in a brilliant event that is a  must-see for all fans.

7886059,5,6305229198,"This PPV was based heavily around the circumstances of the WWF Championship and it going becoming vacant; due to Stone Cold Steve Austin's firing and there being no clear winner on who was champion at the conclusion of the previous month's Judgment Day PPV. Because of this, Vince McMahon decided that there'd be a 16 man tournament known as the Deadly Games tournament at Survivor Series to determine who would become the new WWF Champion.

1.) Deadly Game Tournament First Round Match: Mankind vs Duane Gill

Vince McMahon introduced both Mankind and Gill; giving Gill a rather ludicrous introduction for someone like Gill. Clearly a squash match as Mankind attacks Gill as he enters the ring. One DDT later and Mankind advances to the Quarter Finals of the Deadly Games Tournament.

We get a video shown of Jacqueline attacking Sable earlier on Sunday Night Heat. Kevin Kelly interviews a livid Sable who states that all Jacqueline did was piss her off and guarantees that she'll become the next Women's Champion

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Deadly Game Tournament First Round Match: Jeff Jarrett w/Debra vs Al Snow

A short match here between Snow and Jarrett, so they didn't have very much time to mix it up. Snow and Jarrett each get a few shots in on each other but it's Snow who advances after hitting Jarrett with Head behind the referee's back.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Deadly Games Tournament First Round Match: Big Boss Man vs Stone Cold Steve Austin

Boss Man and Austin fight on Austin's way to the ring with the Rattlesnake getting the upper hand. Stone Cold takes the match in the ring and continues to stay in control until a quick low blow kills Austin's momentum. Boss Man works over Austin for a few minutes and as soon as Austin begins to gain momentum; Boss Man nails him with his nightstick for the DQ. Boss Man continues beating the stuffing out of Austin with the nightstick on the outside as McMahon is shown in the back with a smile on his face, loving every minute of the beating Austin is taking.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Deadly Game Tournament First Round Match: X-Pac vs Steven Regal

Decent bout that starts off at a good pace in the opening minutes but loses some of its steam after a few minutes. In the end, both X-Pac and Regal are counted out. McMahon orders Commissioner Slaughter to go down to the ring and continue the match in a 5 minute sudden death overtime. However, X-Pac is unable to continue the match so the match result remains a double countout, meaning Austin gets a BYE in the Quarter Finals, which McMahon is not too happy about

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Deadly Games Tournament First Round Match: Ken Shamrock vs Goldust

Highly competitive and physical bout in this next match-up but yet again, another short one. Shamrock and Goldust made good use of their time, putting as much into the match as they could. Goldust ends up attempting his Shattered Dreams finisher on Shamrock in the corner but the referee tells the Bizzare One he'll be DQ'd if he does the finisher. Goldust's altercation with the referee gives Shamrock time to recover and execute a hurricanrana off the top rope. Shamrock follows this up with a belly to belly suplex and an Ankle Lock on Goldust. Goldust taps to the Ankle Lock and Shamrock advances

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Deadly Games Tournament First Round Match: The Rock vs Big Boss Man

Triple H was originally supposed to be Rock's opponent (was out recovering from the injury he sustained back at SummerSlam) but Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson come out and announce that Triple H isn't there and that because he didn't show, he'll be fined. Patterson announces to The Rock that there will be no forfeit and that Vince McMahon found a last minute replacement opponent in Big Boss Man. The match lasts but a mere 5 seconds as the moment Boss Man enters the ring, Rocky catches Boss Man with an inside cradle pin for the win

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) Deadly Games Tournament Quarter-Finals Match: The Undertaker w/Paul Bearer vs Kane

Round 2 of the Deadly Games tournament begins with a match between Kane and The Undertaker who were fighting for about the 5th time that year. Sorry to say, but this wasn't exactly a great match from the 2. A bit weird saying that after they had classic bouts earlier that year in 1998 at Wrestlemania and Unforgiven. As were all the others, this match was quick and to the point. I can't quite put my finger on why this match wasn't fantastic, but it just wasn't. Something was off about them this time around. Either way, Undertaker puts Kane down with a Tombstone Piledriver, following a distraction from Paul Bearer for the win to advance to the Semi-Finals in the tournament

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

8.) Deadly Game Tournament Quater-Finals Match: Mankind vs Al Snow

Meh match here. Seemed like more of a comical match than anything. We go backstage where Vince McMahon, Brisco, and Patterson are laughing about how they took Mick's sock and wrapped it around Head and McMahon says Mick will go ballistic when he sees it. Not too long following this, Snow grabs Head and once Mankind sees Mr. Socko around Head, he goes crazy. Mankind ends up hooking Snow with a double arm DDT and finishes Snow off with the Mandible Claw for the win

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

9.) Deadly Games Tournament Quarter-Finals Match: Ken Shamrock vs The Rock

Shamrock and Rock renew their feud from earlier in the year with this terrific bout in the Quarter-Finals. Just like all their other matches they had in 1998, this match really delivered and made for some excellent in-ring psychology. As the end nears, Boss Man distracts the referee and tries to toss his nightstick to Shamrock, but The Rock grabs it instead and nails Shamrock in between the eyes with it. As the referee turns his attention back to the match, Rock pins Shamrock for the easy win and will be advancing to the semi-finals

10.) WWF Women's Championship Match: Sable vs Jacqueline (c) w/Marc Mero

Very basic match here. The diva's division established in 1998 wasn't as good as it'd become to be in the next 2-3 years. But compared to how bad the division got in 1999, I'd take a match like this any day. Sable was popular with fans back in the 90s but her in-ring skills were still questionable. Jacqueline wasn't all that great her first year either. The highlight of the match was Sable powerbombing Marc Mero, which always got a nice pop from the fans. Sable counters a Tornado DDT and plants Jacqueline with a Sablebomb for the win

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

11.) Deadly Game Tournament Semi-Final Match: Mankind vs Stone Cold Steve Austin

Stone Cold walks into the match, beat up and injured after the attack at the hands of Boss Man earlier in the night. Within the first minute of the match, Vince McMahon makes his way down to ringside in his wheelchair with Commissioner Slaughter and the Stooges. This was a fun match to watch as the action spilled to the outside of the ring often with McMahon and his cronies watching from ringside. Mankind ends up bringing a steel chair in the ring to use on Austin but it backfires and Austin ends up Stunning Mankind on the steel chair. Just as the referee gets ready to count the 3 count, McMahon is suddenly healed from his injury by jumping in the ring, dragging the referee out and knocking him out. Austin hits another Stunner and this time Shane McMahon runs to the ring to make the count. Just as he counts to three, he stops and gives Stone Cold the double bird! A pissed off Austin mouths off to Shane before getting hit with the chair by Brisco. Mankind pins the Rattlesnake and Shane makes a fast 3 count. The Corporation run for the hills and make their getaway in a limo, leading to Austin carjacking someone and going after them

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

12.) Deadly Game Tournament Semi-Final Match: The Undertaker w/Paul Bearer vs The Rock

In the final semi-final match; The Rock and Undertaker waste no time in starting the match off. Undertaker stays in control over Rock for most of the beginning with Paul Bearer getting in his shots on the People's Champion behind the referee's back. Just as Rock begins to regain momentum, Big Boss Man interferes once again and distracts The Rock. This distraction puts Taker back in control, leading to Kane interfering. Kane takes out Rock with a Chokeslam, causing Undertaker to get DQ'd, taking him out of the tournament. The Brothers of Destruction fight through the crowd to bring an end to the segment

Michael Cole gets Mankind's thoughts on fighting The Rock in the main event for the vacant WWF Championship. Mankind says there's one more ""rock"" to climb and goes on to cleverly say if you smell what the sock is cooking

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

13.) WWF Triple Threat Tag Team Championship Match: The New Age Outlaws (c) vs The Headbangers vs D'Lo Brown and Mark Henry

Not really a good Tag Team match to say the least. Since it was Triple Threat rules, 3 men started out in the ring, while their partners stood out on the apron. Road Dogg spent most of the match getting beat up, while the other teams managed to make successful tags; but most of all, the match was just confusing to keep up with. No one really bothered to break up most of the pin attempts made in the match, so I guess no one really wanted the Tag Team Championships. Brawls would periodically break out, mixing up who was the legal man and who wasn't. This poorly executed match ends with Billy Gunn hitting a piledriver on Mosh to retain the championships

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

14.) Deadly Game Tournament Final Match: Mankind vs The Rock

After a hectic night, this match was for all the marbles with the winner of thie match being awarded the vacant WWF Championship. Based off the tremendous story-telling the matches and storyline overall had been told throughout the course of the night, this was match was destined to be a great one. There was a nice display of in-ring psychology shown between these 2 which would serve as a preview at what to expect in their matches for the remainder of 1998 and their 1999 matches. After a few minutes, Vince and Shane make their way to ringside to observe the action a bit closer. After an over 15 minute classic bout, The Rock raises the eyebrow at the McMahons and locks Mankind in the Sharpshooter. In an episode of deja vu, Vince calls for the timekeeper to ring the bell, shades of the previous year's Survivor Series with Bret Hart. And just like that, The Rock is the new WWF Champion. In a post-match segment, Vince cuts a heel promo, calling the fans and Mankind pathetic and gullible, revealing that The Rock and the McMahon were working together all along. Mankind confused as to what happened gets attacked by The Rock who goes on cuts a heel promo on the fans and attacks Mankind. The post-match celebration is cut short by Stone Cold Steve Austin who returns to the arena and lays out both Mankind and Rock with Stunners, while Vince and Shane make a run for it to take Survivor Series off the air

Overall: What an amazing Survivor Series PPV this was! This is probably my favorite Survivor Series PPV of all time. In a way, this kind of felt like a WCW PPV, in terms of the match card. WCW in the late 90s was known for overbooking their PPVs with way too many matches for a 3 hour PPV. 14 matches on a WWF PPV was unusual but on this night, it was for good reason. The Deadly Games Tournament was an ingenious idea that really made the WWF Championship look credible and gave many superstars a chance to shine in the limelight. This Survivor Series showed many things. First it showed that Vince McMahon was an amazing heel, one of the best from the Attitude Era, who knew how to pull the strings to make fans hate him. It showed that they could also book a loaded PPV with matches that had incredible meaning behind it without fans seeming overwhelmed by it. The 1998 Survivor Series was a new beginning for the WWF. It officially marked the beginning of The Rock's run as a main eventer, where he'd remain for the rest of his full-time career, and would definitely shine as one heading into 1999. Overall, classic Survivor Series PPV!",1416096000,,13943,5.341396622546783

7886061,4,6305229198,"For the second time in history (first being WrestleMania IV), a tournament would determine who would be the new WWF Champion.  There were a bunch of issues between going into this tournament between not only the participants themselves but also with Mr. McMahon himself (who was in a wheelchair at the time) as Big Boss Man had returned to be Mr. McMahon's personal bodyguard, his son Shane had turned against his father only to be downgraded to being a referee, Mankind had aligned himself with Mr. McMahon to the point where he received a corporate makeover, Steve Austin was still out for revenge after being screwed out of his championship, and The Rock also had something to prove due to Vince taking his aggression for the people out on ""The People's Champion.""

Dwayne Gill vs. Mankind - Mankind was set to have a mystery opponent in the first round only for it to be revealed as former 1980's ""jobber"" in Dwayne Gill (who we currently know as Gillberg).  This was nothing more than a squash match but it was entertaining to see how Dwayne reacted to not only having his own TitanTron but pyro too.

Al Snow vs. Jeff Jarrett - This match marked the WWF PPV debut of Jarrett's former manager in WCW, Debra McMichael while it should also be noted that Al Snow's ""Head"" for some reason was wearing Mankind's ""Mr. Socko"" as a headband.  Past those two notes, this was an average match but nothing noteworthy.

Steve Austin vs. Big Boss Man - Both men started brawling before the match began with Austin dominating throughout the match with Boss Man resorting to dirty tactics in order to get himself some leverage.  As the match went on, Boss Man's true intentions were revealed as it wasn't about winning a match more than injuring Austin & taking him out of the tournament.

X-Pac vs. Steven (William) Regal - Before we would know him as the current William Regal, he had a short run in the WWF this time as a ""Real Man's Man"" & had an issue with X-Pac for being the European Champion despite not being from Europe.  X-Pac showcased his superior quickness early while Regal responded to that by grounding Pac.  It was a nice back & forth match with the only thing bad I can say about it was that the ending got very confusing for a moment.  As a funny side note, pay attention to Jim Ross on commentary as he kept having referring to Regal as Steve Blackman by accident.

Goldust vs. Ken Shamrock - As pointed out in the pre-match interview, Shamrock had won two previous tournaments this year alone (King Of The Ring & for the vacant Intercontinental Title) so he was a heavy favorite going into this tournament.  Both men started out with an aggressive start & traded momentum throughout the match in what was an average encounter.

The Rock vs. Big Boss Man - The Rock's original opponent was announced to be Triple H however he hadn't recovered from his knee surgery months earlier allowing Mr. McMahon to announce Boss Man as a last minute replacement.  All I can say here is don't blink.

Undertaker vs. Kane - Undertaker & Kane both received a bye in the first round so they would meet each other here in the quarter finals (just like Hogan vs. Andre in the first championship tournament) while it should also be noted that Kane was looking for revenge for not only Undertaker turning his back on him a month earlier but also on Paul Bearer for rejoining Undertaker's side.  This was a very slow paced brawl with both men using impactful power moves & evenly matched throughout the bout with Taker targeting Kane's knee.

Al Snow vs. Mankind - Jim Ross made a statement during this match that described both of these men perfectly, ""Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fyne, Dr. Howard"" as both men weren't mentally stable to say the least.  It went back & forth between both men with even a chair getting involved but this was more about Mankind finally finding ""Mr. Socko"" and that being enough motivation for him to turn it up & take it out on not only Snow but ""Head"" as well.

The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock - For those trivia fans, this was the seventh time these two have faced each other in some type of match on a PPV within a year.  Just like their previous encounters, it was a match that went back & forth between both men with the bigger issue being once again Mr. McMahon trying to influence the outcome against The Rock only for it to backfire.  They had better encounters throughout the year but still a nice match.

Womens Champion Jacqueline vs. Sable - For the record, this was Shane McMahon's first match as a referee for the night. This match wasn't much as it was Jacqueline dominating (and carrying) Sable only for her to make her comeback & victory as this was all about Sable getting her revenge & finally ending the long feud against not only Jacqueline but also Marc Mero on the outside.

Steve Austin vs. Mankind - Mr. McMahon & his ""stooges"" were at ringside for this match as Austin came out aggressive & literally beat the clothes off Mankind before taking the brawl to the outside.  A chair got involved with Mankind using it for a DDT while Austin used it to kick Mankind in the face & make a backdrop more painful.  Things got out of control when Vince came out of his seat to make sure Austin didn't get a victory followed by Shane who came into count the fall only to stop at two & give Austin a ""two count"" of his own.  Just like a year earlier, Mr. McMahon just screwed someone out of the WWF Championship.

Undertaker vs. The Rock - They traded momentum here & even took the match into the crowd briefly.  Undertaker kept trying to intimidate the referee at times while both men resorted to cheating behind the referee's back just to get an advantage before the involvement from some of their previous opponents from earlier in the night made the deciding factor here in who was going to the finals of the tournament.

WWF Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Headbangers vs. D'Lo Brown & Mark Henry - Before the match got started, we saw possibly the biggest & longest sign ever seen in wrestling history dedicated to the Outlaws.  This was your typical average triple threat rules match with both teams using double teaming tactics & trying to steal pins from the other team.  Average encounter but nothing special past the fan sign.

WWF Championship Match: The Rock vs. Mankind - Jim Ross described it best during the match when saying ""The Rock turned it up!"" because this was one of the times you saw The Rock get real aggressive in the ring against Mankind along with taking it outside the ring including various moments such as both men using chairs including Rock repeating slamming the chair onto the steel steps which were on top of Mankind & fighting on the announce tables. In the end, The Rock becomes the Corporate Champion using a finish that was complete ""deja vu.""
[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment]

In the end, this event had some good in-ring action & didn't have a bad match on it but there really wasn't anything that stood out or was really memorable past the tournament final but as the tournament itself was more about setting up & pushing storylines but I'm a big fan of 1998 (my favorite year of the Attitude Era) and thought this was one of the top shows that year so this is a tape that I would get.",1333843200,,7292,4.528560548362528
7886062,4,6305229198,"My past memories of previous wrestling cards that I still own to this day continues here with the 1998 Survivor Series. This was a unique event for the Survivor Series as this event didn't center on the usual elimination style matches but instead hosted a 14 man tournament to crown a new WWF Champion. For those that don't remember, back at BreakDown in September, Vince McMahon set up a ""master plan"" to remove the WWF Championship from Stone Cold Steve Austin which was successful. However, there was no champion crowned on that night since the other two opponents (Undertaker & Kane) pinned Austin at the same time. That lead to match at Judgment Day between the brothers with Austin being the guest referee with the stipulation on Austin being that if he didn't crown a champion, he would be fired. Well Austin didn't raise the hand of a champion & was fired on the spot only to be rehired by Shane McMahon who a few weeks prior to the event decided to step up to his dad. The result lead to McMahon setting up a 14-man tournament to crown a new WWF Champion & guaranteed to crwon a new champion. Austin wasn't the only one Vince had a problem with as McMahon also had issues against The Rock but once again thanks to Shane McMahon, found himself back in the championship tournament. Along with those problems, Vince finally opened up & seemed to accept Mankind to the point that he gave him a corporate make-over to fit the look of a new corporate champion. The rules were simple to this tournament in which the first round matches would have a 10 minute time limit, the second round having a 15 minute time limit, the semi-finals having a 30-minute time limit & the finals having an hour time limit. Also due to the issues over the past few months, The Undertaker & Kane received ""byes"" into the second round but with the stipulations, the night promised some fast paced action.

Mankind vs Duane Gill. The first match of the opening round of the tournament as Mankind was given a mystery opponent hand-picked by Vince McMahon. Jerry Lawler described this best at the end ""was that a match?"" as Mankind made short work of Gill to the point that Gill's intro was longer than the match with the only thing worth mentioning that I found comical was Gill being scared of his own pyro.

Al Snow vs Jeff Jarrett. After having minor interactions over the past few weeks, these two battled here. This went back & forth with Snow even doing a bit of high spots with Debra (looking hot at ringside BTW) getting involved in the finish when both men attempted using ""Head"" but only one was successful with their attempt.

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Big Bossman. Bossman wasted no time as he went after Austin while Austin was making his way to the ring only to be introduced to steel steps. This was a high impact brawl from there but the bigger story was the job that Bossman did with his night stick on Austin that may have caused Austin to win the battle & advance but lose the war as he took a great deal of punishment.

X-Pac vs Steven Regal. This was Regal's WWF PPV debut as he was wrestling under his ""Man's Man"" gimmick that really went nowhere as Regal quickly went back to WCW after this match. This was another match that went back & forth as Regal focused on X-Pac's neck with neck cranks, wear down holds & suplexes including a double underhook suplex from the top while X-Pac tried to keep the match at a fast pace where he was gaining some offense. The ending was disappointing as it resulted in a double countout just when the match was starting to get better, although I should mention that with this happening, Steve Austin would receive a ""bye"" into the semi-finals which McMahon tried to over rule but couldn't.

Ken Shamrock vs Goldust. This match was more of a showcase for Ken Shamrock as he was in control for the most part of the match with Goldust only getting some offense whenever Shamrock started to lose momentum but it wasn't enough as Shamrock got the win here.

The Rock vs Big Bossman. Triple H was originally advertised to be in this match but due to his knee injury (that he suffered at SummerSlam for those keeping track), Patterson & Brisco issued a replacement which turned out to be the Big Bossman. My sentence behind this match was longer as this match has gone down as the fastest match in WWF history even to this day, so don't blink.

The Undertaker vs Kane. The first match of the second round (or the quarter-finals) of the tournament. This was a unique setting as it was the first time that these two battled on PPV with both men switching roles here as Kane was a face while Taker was the heel along with having Paul Bearer in his corner. This match is actually better than their future encounters such as SummerSlam 2000, WrestleMania XX or even their 2010 feud as both men exchanged power moves in the ring, brawled on the outside area & even Taker doing moves that you haven't seen from him before such as Booker T's reverse axe kick at one point.

Mankind vs Al Snow. This match had a funny backstory as Vince McMahon had stolen ""Mr. Socko"" & wrapped it around ""Head"" to motivate Mankind for this match. These two had a better match than their first round matches here as they had brawl around the outside area & even bringing in a chair to use for impactful moves inside the ring. There was also a comedic moment where Mankind found ""Socko"" around the ""Head"" & even decided to beat up ""Head"" in the process.

The Rock vs Ken Shamrock. This didn't top their previous KOTR encounter but this was good match as it went back & forth with Shamrock attacking Rock's ankle at times to set up the ankle lock while Rock refused to quit & even landed his famous DDT at one point. However, the bigger story here was the appearance of the Big Bossman who played a factor in this match with his night stick but in a way that he wasn't intending to.

WWF Women's Champion Jacqueline vs Sable. Earlier in the night on HEAT, Jacqueline layed out another attack on Sable that you saw her selling in the early going. It should be noted that Shane McMahon was the referee for this match. Everyone that seen a Sable match knows that a Sable is only good when the match is kept short & her opponent heavily sells. That was the case here as Sable was dominate throughout the match with Jacqueline getting a shot here & there but again, Sable was dominant to the point where she even gave Marc Mero a powerbomb on the floor in this short match.

Mankind vs Stone Cold Steve Austin. The first of two semi-final matches of the tournament & before the match got underway, Vince McMahon made his way to the ring with Patterson, Brisco & Commissioner Slaughter. This was a wild match between these two as Austin attacked Mankind quickly in the early stages to the point that Austin ripped up Mankind's tuxedo & even nailed him in the head with his own shoes. However, the highlight of this match was Vince McMahon delivering his promise in that Austin would be screwed (doesn't that sound familiar at Survivor Series?) in a huge swerve that nobody, even Austin, saw coming.

The Rock vs The Undertaker. Around 7 months before they would go on to their most memorable encounter at the King Of The Ring '99, they battled here in what was a good match that again, went back & forth between the two with Rock again adding some entertainment by mocking Taker & Paul Bearer after delivering a DDT at one point during the match. Just like Rock's previous match, Big Bossman did make an appearance here but it was someone else that had problems not with Rock but with Taker that made a bigger impact on the outcome of this match that even lead to a huge brawl into the crowd.

WWF Tag Team Champions The New Age Outlaws vs The Headbangers vs D'Lo Brown & Mark Henry. The story here was that the team of the Headbangers, Brown & Henry had made a pact to work together to take out the Outlaws & settle the action among themselves which was shown in the opening video from their attack on the Outlaws earlier in the night on HEAT. This was different than the common triple threat team matches that we see as one person from each team was allowed to be in the ring instead of the usual one-on-one action. This was a good average match between these three teams with the action getting out of control at times that the referee couldn't control the action.

WWF Championship Finals Match: The Rock vs Mankind. The finals of the tournament to crown a new WWF Champion. Both men started off a bit cautious in trying to feel each other out with both men going through tough matches in the previous round & as an added fact, Vince & Shane McMahon made their way to the ringside area at one point during the match. This match certainly picked up from there as both men were no longer patient & as Jim Ross said at one point ""turned it up"". They battled in the crowd with Rock hitting Mankind in the head with a trash can, fighting all over the announce tables with Mankind taking a sick fall through the Spanish announce table, both men using chairs & steel steps with a sick moment of Rock slamming the chair into the steps about six times with Mankind being under them. However, the surprise at the end was the conclusion where it was revealed that The Rock was working with the McMahons the whole time with a ""screwjob finish"" similar to last years Survivor Series resulting in The Rock not only becoming the WWF Champion for the first time but also the Corporate Champion.

In the end, this is event was very similar to events such as the King Of The Ring, WrestleMania IV & The Wrestling Classic '85 in which due to the structure of the tournament, many matches on the card were kept short including some that looked like was going to get good (X-Pac/Regal) but cut short along with two DUDs (although Rock/Bossman was hilarious & a record-setting match). There were some standout matches throughout the tournament such as Taker/Kane, Rock/Shamrock, Mankind/Austin, Rock/Taker & Rock/Mankind but past that, there was nothing horrible or boring on this card so I enjoyed it overall & would give this a 3.5 star event but again since it can't be done, I would give it a 4 & I would recommend at least taking a look at this one.",1301788800,2,10233,4.4793565683646115
7886063,3,6305229198,"Survivor Series '98 brought back the 16 man WWE championship tournament to crown a new WWE champion. The tournament had it highs and it definitely had it lows. McMahon would start off the show to announce there will be a new WWE champion and he also introduces Mankind's mystery opponent which many of the fans where chanting HBK before hand.

First Round Matches
1. Mankind vs. Dwayne Gill (Gillberg)
If this match had any good to it, then it would be where Gill got scared by his pyro which was some/what funny. Match ends under a minute. 0.5/5

2. Jeff Jarrett w/ Debra vs. Al Snow
Much better than the first match. The King was all for Tennessee in this one. The match had some good reversals and some nice moves. Debra would try to interfere but it would only back fire on Jarrett's part. It had a nice shot with ""head"" towards the end. Pretty average match. 2.5/5

3. Big Bossman vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin
The match started out with a brawl on the outside before it would move into the ring. Bossman would hit a low blow on Austin but the ref ignored it. There was some good shots but it would end in a dq so Austin would sell his injury throughout the night. 3/5

4. William Regal vs. X-Pac
A pretty refreshing match to say the least. The match was very good especially after the poor matches that was placed infront of them. Regal & X-Pac took some hard bumps in this one. Regal would soon apply some holds on X-Pac to wear him down. X-Pac took a lot of punishment on his neck and even takes a hard suplex from the top rope. It was a disappointment when it became a double count-out but this could have been the match of the first round. Pretty good match. 4/5

5. Ken Shamrock vs. Goldust
This was a pretty good match up as well. Some nice moveneuvers and some reversals. Some nice slams. Shamrock pulled off a nice hurricanrana off the top rope onto Goldust. Good match. 3.5/5

6. The Rock vs. Bossman
It was originally suppose to be Triple H but he was still out from his knee injury, so Bossman would be the replacement. It ended in about 6 or 7 seconds after the Rock got a quick roll up on Bossman after he entered the ring. Very short match to say the least but I liked it though, I felt it was a good move. 1/5

Quarter Finals
7. Undertaker w/ Paul Bearer vs. Kane
It was cool to see Kane being the face and Taker being the heel this time around. Some good brawling and some nice shots were taken in the beginning of the match. It had some good action to take place on the outside. Taker would work on Kane's leg to try and beat him down. It had some nice power moves and some nice brawling throughout the match. Not as good as their wrestlemania meeting but you can't help that with this being a tournament match. Nice way to start off the quarter finals. 4/5

8. Al Snow vs. Mankind
I don't have no idea how Foley can wrestle a pretty decent match up while wearing a tux but he did it. The match had some good action on the outside and a chair would even get introduced. It had some nice hard shots. One funny stupid part of the match was when Foley found socko around ""head"" and then he would stomp on the head. Pretty nice contest with a good amount of time. 3.5/5

9. Ken Shamrock vs. The Rock
I felt this was the best match these two had that year. They had a nice brawl on the outside and some good wrestling in the ring. They pull off some nice counters and some good moves. Bossman would interfere but once again it would only backfire. Good match, much better than their other encounters. 4/5

10. Women's Championship
Sable vs. Jacqueline w/ Marc Mero
Jackie would get a cheap shot on Sable in the early going. Sable would get the advantage and hit the TKO on Jackie. Mero would interefere but would get powerbombed on the outside by Sable. It had some good counters. Sable hit her sablebomb on Jackie to regain the title. Impressive women's title match. 3.5/5

Semi-Finals
11. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Mankind
Stone Cold would just come to the ring and just beat on Foley and then just rip his clothes off. He would even hit Foley with his very own shoe. It was a little funny to see foley wrestle in his socks. McMahon and the stooges would come to ringside. Another funny part was when Foley countered the stunner and then ran from the ring. Austin took a hard slam onto the concrete floor. It got physical on the outside for a while. It became a better of a match once it got back into the ring.  A chair would also come into play in this match as well. It had a shocking ending but it all worked well in the end. 3.5/5

12. The Rock vs. Undertaker w/ Paul Bearer
The match started out with a pretty good brawl and soon went to the outside where some more brawling took place. They had a pretty good wrestling match and a nice slugfest as well. Kane would come out and get Taker dqed after chokeslamming the rock. Taker and Kane would then just go and fight all out into the crowd. 4/5

13. WWE Tag Team Championship
New Age Outlaws vs. Headbangers vs. D Lo Brown & Mark Henry
This match was interesting, cause one member from each team was in the match at the same time. The headbangers seem liked the odd man team where they would try to get the quick pin after the other teams did their dirty work. There was a lot of double team moves apllyed to the outlaws. The match had a few high risk and some nice shots. The Road dogg really gets isolated in this one. It had a pretty good ending. Good match to set up the finals. 3.5/5

14. Finals for the WWE Championship
The Rock vs. Mankind
Foley and Rock always had some pretty good matches together and this was no exception. This match also had its share of having some good action to take place on the outside. Foley uses some nice wrestling holds to wear down the Rock. The McMahons would soon come out and stand ringside. Foley & Rock took some hard slams and hard shots on the outside. Foley even crashes through the announce table at one point in the match. This match was defiantly the match of the night, but of course this match is known as the second Survivor Series screw job. Nice way to end the show. 4.5/5

After the match, McMahon would address the fans and tell them how the people screwed the people. McMahon would also make reference to Foley and Austin. Austin would soon return and get revenge on Foley and the Rock for what happened earlier in the show.

This wasn't the best Survivor Series but if yall like tournaments and if yall can find this somewhere for like 5 bucks or under then I recommend on getting it but it aint really all that special. You can get the final match on the Rock's 3 disc dvd as well.",1218326400,,6618,4.264752791068581
7886064,5,6305229198,"I love tournaments but I didn't like the fact that it was a 14-men insted of a 16-men toury. I also didn't like the draw in the Steven Regal vs. X-Pac match and I really didn't like the match between The Rock & The Big Bossman(subbing for Triple H)which was the shortest match in the tournament. Other then that, I like it overall. The Best match in the show was The Rock vs Mankind which was a hardcore,smash-mouth brawl. The worst match was Mankind vs Duane Gill which was a short,dumb & one-sided filler. The rest was ok. I give this PPV a 9 out of 10.",1189641600,,555,4.196261682242991

7886066,3,6305229198,"This was the first time since WrestleMania 4 back in 1988 that a ppv had a touranment to determine who should capture the vacant wwf title.  It was set up just like WM 4 where 14 individuals competed and two automatically were in the second round (those being kane and undertaker).  The majority of the matches in this tourament were average or poor.  The only matches that really shined in the tourament was Ken Shamrock vs Rock, Rock vs Mankind, and Austin vs Foley.  Of course, there was a very shocking development and that was the McMahons master plan and not only screwing Austin both also Mic Foley.  If you've seen this show you know what I'm talking about.  The undercard which only featured two matches, the women's title match and tag team triple threat title matches were average.  Overall, not bad but there are better 1998 ppvs such as King Of the Ring and Summerslam.",1064707200,2,882,4.615384615384615
7886067,2,6305229198,"Following the previous year's controversial but highly-entertaining Series, this one was a huge dissapointment. Rather than the usual eight or ten man elimination tag matches, they decided to have a tournament for the World Title.
We had Vince McMahon making an angle that mocked the ""real"" incident from the 1997 Survivor Series as The Rock became the ""Corporate Champion"". The event itself was just all the tournament matches leading up to a battle between The Rock and Mick ""Mankind"" Foley. We also got to see a pretty average tag team title match featuring New Age Outlaws, The Headbangers, and the Mark Henry/D-Lo Brown team.",1063238400,,630,5.0673076923076925
