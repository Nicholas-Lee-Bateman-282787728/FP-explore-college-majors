4428595,5,B004M53P74,"Ok, this show is not super high professional quality, but it seems like a labor of love and it's really pretty entertaining. It's edited together really well and the songs are fun, and my three year old who adores trains just loves this show. And that's the point.",1401321600,,264,4.520833333333333
4428596,5,B004M53P74,"My boys love toy trains and are absolutely fascinated by this DVD.  I admit I don't get the fascination but seeing real trains and cool toy trains in action on tv for them just amazes them.  The day we first watched this we watched the DVD three times in a row!  There are many cool trains and the DVD really does try to show different themes and such.  It starts out with Halloween Train which is a spooky train set that zips around, there is an alien cargo chapter, candy mountain and more!  My favorite is a guy who designed a whole huge train set out of Lego's!  It was amazing how everything was made of Lego's!  There is some narration which describes real trains (some of which is above my sons head but I am sure older train fans would appreciate the knowledge) and there is some catchy music too!  Like I said we have seen this DVD a whole bunch of times and everytime we watch it I do see something new, as there really is so much going on.  This DVD is not animated but shows real trains and model trains, perfect for any train fan!  We have never seen any other train DVDs like this but this one makes my 2 and 4 year old happy, which makes me happy - it is also a nice change from cartoons!

Mom and More Disclosure: I was sent this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.",1305072000,2,1294,4.136
4428597,4,B004M53P74,My 4 year old loves this movie. He watched it a few times a day for a few days. Though hasn't asked for it again but still talks about the movie to people he meets. It's super cheesy but apparently that's okay for kid train lovers.,1304812800,,231,4.043478260869565
4428598,1,B004M53P74,"My grandson loves the I love Toy Trains videos.  He wants to see them over and over again.  However, this one isn't worth the money, it is poorly done and rather stupid.  I wish I could return it.  Even he, at 3 years of age, said it was stupid.",1304208000,,245,3.938775510204082
4428599,5,B004M53P74,"Another excellent video in this collection.  Jeff sure has grown up.  To me the I Love Toy train videos are ingenious.  Just like Baby Einstein videos are basically spinning/moving toys set to classical music, these are model train sets set to folk music.  And it holds the child's attention in the same fashion.  And the child learns interesting trains fact to boot.  I was amazed when my child pointed to the train at the B&O museum and told me that was a 4-2-4 engine (based on the number of wheel set it has).  As inane as it sounds that someone would watch a video of trains running while music plays, you will find yourself entertained for hours.  Brilliant!",1302825600,,664,4.567796610169491
4428600,4,B004M53P74,"My boys requested to watch this video daily for a month after we got it, and it is still a favorite.  I could have done without the Halloween and Alien themes, but it is a fun video. Our favorite is still Oh, No!  But this one is a close second.",1301875200,,245,3.88

8435498,2,B004M53P74,"Not a fan of this one.  The Ghost Train segment is creepy and kids don't like it at all.  Later in the DVD, they UFO
segment was weird and very boring!  Stopped the dvd and wish I could trade it in.  I also purchased the All About Trains and
it is great!  Wished I had bought two of those and passed on the All Aboard!",1485475200,,318,3.830769230769231
