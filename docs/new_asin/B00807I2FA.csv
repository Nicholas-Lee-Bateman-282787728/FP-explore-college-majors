8523571,5,B00807I2FA,"I found this film so compelling because of the very personal portraits it showed of women's lives, particularly as they interacted with the very limited health care system.  Sas Carey, a Registered Nurse and Doctor of Traditional Mongolian Medicine, has been working in Mongolia for close to 20 years now. Her beautifully presented documentary footage captures a nomadic culture that may be quickly disappearing from the world. I highly recommend this film.",1383264000,2,457,5.347222222222222
