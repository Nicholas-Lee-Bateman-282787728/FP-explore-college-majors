6356973,5,B00JH1E28Y,"Bought this instead of the overpriced PBS 'gift'.
Fascinating chronicle of one of America's Finest Personalities.
RIP Johnny. And thanks for giving us such cool memories. There will NEVER be anyone like you.

6356974,5,B00JH1E28Y,I love Johnny Carson. There will never be another like him and these sets are priceless. Television history. I can't get enough. Please release more!,1411344000,,149,5.0
6356975,5,B00JH1E28Y,Reasonably nice collection of Tonight Show episodes.  It's Carson -- nobody's else has ever done late night half as well.  I wish there were a few hundred more episodes.  :),1409961600,,173,4.7
6356976,5,B00JH1E28Y,"While it's a 30 minute episode of each show, it is still fun to watch--and you get opening monologues with the first shows that I've watched.  Unless you're purchasing the vault series, this is the best yet(if you want more than just clips of shows).  Heeere's Johnny!",1406246400,14,268,4.680851063829787
6356977,3,B00JH1E28Y,Not as interesting as I thought. But I'm still happy that I purchased this series,1406246400,2,81,4.466666666666667

6356979,5,B00JH1E28Y,It was a excellent collection of former shows. It was the whole show and not just a bit or piece of it . Hope to find more collections like that one !,1402358400,21,150,3.71875

6356983,5,B00JH1E28Y,The collection has given us many laughs.  You won't be disappointed if you make purchase.,1452038400,,89,4.933333333333334
6356984,5,B00JH1E28Y,This is for a  Christmas gifts. I know my boyfriend will love it.,1450310400,,65,4.0
6356985,1,B00JH1E28Y,"This description is misleading as it sounds like the entire seasons of the show.  However, the episodes included on this dvd series must be the ones left over from all the other sets that no one wanted.  They are boring.  I love JC but there is not much to laugh at here.",1449100800,2,271,4.173076923076923
6356986,1,B00JH1E28Y,"This set has serious sound problems.  Dialog completely disappears at random with occasional distortion of the video.  The selection of episodes is good, but you need to hear what is being said.  (I'm using PowerDVD 10 for playback.  Don't know if a different player would be better, but I don't think so.)",1448323200,,306,4.826923076923077

6356989,5,B00JH1E28Y,Excellent DVD. Johnny Carson at his best.,1445299200,,41,5.0
6356990,4,B00JH1E28Y,"I wanted to do a fair review of this boxed set of DVD's and glad I waited.  First off...Johnny Carson show is butchered into half hour segments for each episode.  I began to get annoyed as I watch these episodes and they are talking to a star or personality and then it abruptly ends!!  I can remember when some shows ran long and yes they would come back after commercial and say, ""That's all the time we have for!"" But it's quite obvious that someone wanted to trim the episodes down to half-hour segments and did a pretty BAD job of it!!

They do keep the monologue in each show which in a way is neat to remember what was going on say in May of 1976!  Johnny Carson was always topical and discussed things in the newspaper or on the mind of the country.  I'm also glad there were some episodes showing the Mighty Carson players or whatever their name was and of course, Carnac (sic) the soothsayer.  Some of the shows they featured were of first-time out comics on the Tonight Show like: Gary Shandling, Jerry Seinfeld, David Brenner, and even the first time Robin Williams appeared on the Tonight Show while his Mork and Mindy were very popular.  Robin Williams was obviously nervous and didn't do TV spots as he explained. He did do comedy stand-up still, but was fearful of appearing on like the Tonight Show.  He obviously gets over his shyness and basically took over the Tonight show as Johnny Carson sat back and let Robin Williams do his improv thing!

I wished those DVD's had the full episode without it being edited, and maybe it would be a better quality endeavor for nostalgia.  Just be warned about all of this before you purchase it!",1442707200,27,1652,4.473333333333334

6356992,2,B00JH1E28Y,There's a reason this set is lower in price. I haven't watched the full set yet but what we've seen aren't the best highlights of the Johnnie Carson show.,1436400000,,154,4.344827586206897

Of course this is just a sampler of his hundreds of shows and I'm now enjoying my second viewing and I will continue to view these periodically.  A great plus for this collection is that all of the commercials  have been edited out!",1427587200,6,374,4.391304347826087

6357013,3,B00JH1E28Y,"I've only seen one other Tonight Show compilation, but, based on that, this set is definitely not a ""best of"" Carson. In fact, many of the segments were downright unfunny, if not blatantly offensive, particularly the David Brenner  portions. There were only 2 or 3 of the Carson Art players sketches in 7 of the disks (1/2 the set) and just 1 or 2 of the ""mystic seer"" bits(forget his name).  Can't recommend this set at this price.",1418860800,12,432,4.5256410256410255
6357014,3,B00JH1E28Y,thought we would love watching these  . But you cant go home anymore . Some of it was real funny but the rest is just filler . Cool to see how people dressed back when .What a hoot,1418860800,,180,3.736842105263158

6357019,3,B00JH1E28Y,This material consists mostly monologs and guest interviews.  I was hoping for more skits from the mighty Carson art players.,1412985600,21,125,5.25

8650767,4,B00JH1E28Y,My wife and I love watching the old Carson shows. These have been cut to 1/2 hour segments and I found the choice of shows on the first DVD to be somewhat less that I had hoped for but the balance of the remaining DVD's had much better choices. Johnny Carson was the best late night host ever.,1492041600,,293,4.068965517241379

8650773,4,B00JH1E28Y,"Good quality, great to see it again, wish it was complete episodes.  The episodes that are on there are about 30-40 minutes in length.  You can tell they have been edited, as there might be a weird shot to the audience that doesn't flow with the setup.  Or Johnny might mention a guest that never makes it out.  The beginning is always the same with the same 4 snippets before Doc's theme starts up, and that gets annoying to hear Billy Crystal at the start of EVERY EPISODE.  But the quality of most of the shows are very good, and it's great to re-watch them again.",1457222400,,567,4.311320754716981
