I had correspondence with the business owner who was extremely informative, helpful and polite. To say that I am pleased with this purchase is an understatement. I would buy from this person again in a heartbeat!! I give the entire purchase a AAA+++++++ rating Thank you for such a pleasant experience!!",1380672000,,460,4.621951219512195
7907709,5,B00000F9QG,"Dan Curtis made this TV movie back in 1969 as a pilot for a series. Well,the pilot didn't catch on,so this is it. What it is is a cool little ghost story. A woman has inherited a spooky old house she can't sell due to the rumors circulating about it being haunted. She enlists two ghosthunters to check it out and...of course it's haunted! It has more than a slight DS resemblance,but non-DS fans who like scary stories that are a little campy will dig it too!",984960000,9,460,4.2988505747126435
