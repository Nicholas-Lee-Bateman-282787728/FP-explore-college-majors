8587933,5,B00CZNS9GC,"Our family of cat lovers found this DVD to be fun and entertaining. - Great for young kids.

It's still good to have control of what you put in front of your kids. There are a lot of short cat videos on YouTube, but inappropriate videos for children are only a click away: which can be bad news. With a disc like this, you can put it on the TV and know that your children aren't going to click somewhere they aren't supposed to or be exposed to commercials for who-knows-what. Plus: this video is 30 minutes, so you don't need to worry about finding a new video every time a 2 minute clip ends.

Pros:
- Kittens! What else?
- There are a number of different colorful scenes (kittens playing in baskets, with balloons and mirrors, and in a garden among others), so it doesn't get boring.
- There are about seven kittens that are introduced with personalities, so they don't feel like just some generic cats.
- The video features 'kat facts': little pop-ups that teach interesting tidbits about cats.
- The music is fresh and original. Some of the music is upbeat, some of it relaxing. Your kids can rewatch it without the music getting on the nerves.

Con:
- An older TV aspect ratio (square vs the modern rectangle), but we in less than a minute we basically didn't even notice.",1516665600,,1278,4.4297872340425535
8587934,4,B00CZNS9GC,What a wonderfully warm presentation.  It was a real joy to watch and I know others will find the kittens and their antics enjoyable.  It is truly a worthwhile addition to the viewing library of animal lovers.  It is a special note to know that the kittens filmed in this were all rescued from an animal shelter and found their way into loving forever homes.  The camera work and editing are the work of professionals who wanted to show this as a labor of love.  They succeeded beyond words.,1384128000,3,491,4.47191011235955
8587935,5,B00CZNS9GC,Kitten Kommotion is great fun and my kids LOVE it! We purchased the original VHS several years ago and it is great to see the DVD version now available. My brother has young children and I plan to purchase a copy for them for the holidays. Kitten Kommotion was fun way before lolcats even was conceived!,1383782400,4,303,4.428571428571429
8587936,1,B00CZNS9GC,"I purchased eleven VHS copies of ""Kitten Kommotion"" from my local second hand shop. Being a big fan of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Non-Stop-Kittens-VHS/dp/B00000JL2P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Non-Stop Kittens [VHS</a>]"" (known to some as ""Kitty Love"") from the studio Superior Promotions, I had hunch that ""Kitten Kommotion"" would be an equally-as-delightful feline romp. However, producers Bart Christner, Ron Edwards, and Glen Green have done nothing but disappoint.

Where ""Non-Stop Kittens"" prevails, ""Kitten Kommotion"" fails. NSK features 30 minutes of kittens playing, through several locations on a farm. There are over 20 kittens, clever editing, original music, etc. KK, on the other hand, features one location: a studio. ""Kitten Kommotion"" is manufactured fun, a deceptive studio attempt at being a copycat to the original splendor of NSK. You know what ""Kitten Kommotion"" has? Long transitions, that exist only to add time. Not to mention the music is terrible -- it sounds like it came from a Casio keyboard.

I watched ""Kitten Kommotion"" with two dogs and my friend Rachel... and we collectively give it four thumbs and eight paws down. Don't waste your money on this corporate-sponsored attempt to recreate the magic of kittens at play on a studio set. Buy ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Non-Stop-Kittens-VHS/dp/B00000JL2P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Non-Stop Kittens [VHS</a>]"" instead -- it may cost a bit more, but this time the kittens are the real thing.",1382054400,7,1557,6.137614678899083
