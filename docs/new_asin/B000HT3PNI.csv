8141240,4,B000HT3PNI,"Its an interesting collection of disaster themed movies.

The quality of all DVD's was excellent, packaging was good.

The acting in all films was what I consider to be above average, none fell into the ""B"" movie category.

Special effects scenes were very well done for the most part, best here was Independence Day [excluding one particular scene], then Day After, Chain Reaction and Volcano.

Volcano had the best / most believable story line but was the poorest of the films in most other respects, though still above average.

Casts were good to excellent in all the films in the set.

Sets and locations / backdrops were not discerably ""fake"" and through their detail added to the enjoyment.

There was not a single move here I'd say wasn't worth watching, none leave the impression ""there went a few hours I'll never get back"".

If you enjoy these types of movies that are certainly in a family frame [no overt sex and no substantial profanity] I'd have no issues about adding this set to the collection.",1315440000,,1011,4.7371428571428575
8141241,5,B000HT3PNI,"All 4 of this movies are great and watchable over and over again, Independence Day is one of my favorite movies of all time.",1201046400,,124,4.208333333333333
8141242,4,B000HT3PNI,"All the films except Volcano are enhanced for 16 X 9 TV's.

Very annoying that you don't find this out unless you buy it and open the box.",1173139200,6,138,3.9285714285714284
