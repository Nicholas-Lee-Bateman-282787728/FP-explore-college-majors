8203464,5,B000S00LRO,There is something special about watching a DVD of a concert that you attended 16 years ago. What is even more special is not only the performances of some stellar bands and musicians but the other content too. This is not merely a music video but a documentary depicting the harsh realities that have befallen Tibet in the past and continue to occur even now. I have watched the DVD numerous times since I got it and continue to watch my favourite performances over and over again.,1357344000,,482,4.551724137931035
