8108461,5,B000EDRGSC,"I suffered through all the basic high school Shakespeare lessons... It wasn't until I was invited to see the English Shakespeare Company's marvelous presentation of the Wars of the Roses (stretching from Richard II to Richard III) that I truly understood the beauty and humor of Shakespeare. Unshackled from the traditional approach, with sly references to contemporary events, the ESC was a life-changer -- or at least culture-changer -- for me.

ESC's version is my favorite Henry V, above Olivier and waaaayy above Branaugh. Michael Pennington is a great Henry, but the supporting cast truly carry the day. Philip Bowen's Montjoy and Sean Probert's Fluellen are wonderful characters. And nobody has done the Dauphin better than Andrew Jarvis.

From Act I, Scene I, when the Bishop Ely glances at his watch to answer the Archbishop's question, ""Is it four o'clock?"" you know you're in for a treat.

This is definitely not a traditional performance, as director Michael Bogdanov used costumes, scenery and music to help novices like myself understand the players without the playbook. I believe that William S would have reveled in this creative approach.",1238630400,,1156,5.204301075268817
