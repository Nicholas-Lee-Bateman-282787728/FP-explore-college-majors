5616458,5,B00BGGITV4,This little gem has another very nice performance by Edmond Gwenn as a likable old fellow who makes ends meet by occasionally printing his own dollar bills. Burt Lancaster is a Treasury Dept. agent who takes on the case that has  stumped the Secret Service for over ten years. This would make a great double-feature evening at the movies along with 'Miracle On 34th Street.',1368921600,6,374,4.753846153846154
5616459,5,B00BGGITV4,"This is the story of an old man (Edmund Gwenn) living alone and feeding himself by ""collecting antiques""..mainly other peoples junk....and selling it. He finds an old printing press and starts to print money  but ONLY when he is running short of cash at the end of the month. The Treasury Dept case file is ""#880"" and the agents start calling him ""Mr 880"" because they cannot find him. Years go by and still he remains anonymous .....that is until a ""hot shot"" special agent is sent from Washington (Burt Lancaster).....the agent tracks him down..........very good story...with some humor....some viewers will need a Kleenex box handy....overall a good story.....",1363564800,22,663,5.08256880733945

Unfortunately, his uncle has cornered the market on one dollar bills with the serial number 880. Enter Burt Lancaster as a treasury agent trying to find the source of these elusive bills which occur in what seems like unrelated locations throughout the city of New York. This story of cat-and-mouse between the two while befriending each other is a delight. It is a sweet tale and one that any age could appreciate and enjoy.",1387152000,,622,4.822429906542056
5616483,4,B00BGGITV4,"Oh, Edmund Gwenn, that incorrigible old charmer. This is an English gent who gained a sort of immortality and who's stamped himself onto each child's memory as ""Kris Kringle"" in Miracle on 34th Street (1947), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. You'd be hard pressed to come up with another picture as memorable in his body of film work. That's not to say that his other pictures were laying eggs. Here's Mister 880 (1950), a comic caper for which he got a second nod at an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and a Golden Globes Award get. Were someone to tell you the premise of Mister 880, you may, at first blush, presume it to be one of them crime noir stories. No, man, comic caper, and a good one.

It's like this: For the past ten years, in New York, the United States Secret Service had been stymied and mortified by one miscreant. In these past ten years, a span in which Mr. 880 has made a habit of eluding the law, the Secret Service's New York office has arrested and convicted 1385 counterfeiters. I guess it pays to be skimpy. Mr. 880 - so named after the number assigned to the case - is very stingy in passing out his phony money, and he only ever doles out these amateurish fake $1 bills (on which ""Washington"" is spelled ""Wahsington"").

Treasury Agent Steve Buchanan (Burt Lancaster) is a rising star in the Secret Service. He's been tapped to lift this embarrassing albatross off the agency's back. But even someone with Buchanan's doggedness can't solve this overnight. In pursuit of his investigation he strikes up the acquaintance of United Nations French interpreter Anne Winslow (Dorothy McGuire), and this is when the romantic element surfaces.

Anne is one link in Agent Buchanan's chain of clues, and she soon enough susses out that she's a person of interest in his investigation. It's refreshing for me to observe her conduct as she reacts to this, and maybe I should've thrown in a minor plot spoiler alert somewhere here (still not to late to skip this paragraph, yo). Back in the day when women were expected to behave in demure fashion, Anne is upfront about her interest in the square-jawed Buchanan. As she confesses to him, she herself isn't averse to making wolf whistles (in her own lady-like way, of course). To string along his interest, she digs into books about counterfeiting (""Counterfeiting for Dummies 101?""). And she's soon dropping phrases such as ""boodles of queer."" But does she fool Agent Buchanan at all?

Where was I? Oh, yeah. ""Oh, Edmund Gwenn, that incorrigible old charmer."" Anne's upstairs neighbor is this amiable old gent everyone fondly calls ""Skipper."" Skipper - real name William Miller - is a 73-year-old junk dealer, and he's Anne's friend and so he registers as such on Buchanan's radar. It's no last moment twist, no big reveal that the Skipper is the elusive Mister 880. The film alerts us to this from jump. Skipper - once a Machinist 1st Class in the U.S. Navy - refers to his notorious printing press as his rich relative ""Cousin Henry."" Edmund Gwenn does a really interesting thing here. His Skipper is a fella who is kind as the day is long but who nurses s specific amoral bump. He harbors a disconnect. He doesn't see why it's wrong to pass out funny money, especially since it's only $1 bills. He's a crook whom you can't help but like. It's this dichotomy that makes him fascinating.

Mister 880 is an affectionate charmer of a film. It not only showcases Gwenn's immense likability but also Lancaster's virile, commanding presence and McGuire's effortless elegance (colored with just a whiff of mischief). This was a TCM premiere some days ago, and I pounced on it like a fat man pounces on butter. Naturally, you know that Mister 880 was based on a true story penned as a three-parter by some person named St. Clair McKelway and published in the August 27, 1949 issue (page 30) of the New Yorker magazine. Emerich Juettner was the real-life old counterfeiter who counterfeited just enough money to get by, and who exercised great care in where and when he passed out them fake dollars. He counfounded the Secret Service for ten years and, when finally caught, only served four months behind bars. Juettner ended up raking in more money off this film than he ever did off his printing press. Yeah, tell him crime doesn't pay.",1385337600,13,4345,4.696850393700787

5616489,3,B00BGGITV4,"Mister 880, 1950 film

Counterfeiting has been known since money was invented. This is one case that was long outstanding, unlike most counterfeiters. An agent is brought in from Los Angeles, someone with a fresh look. You see the city streets of that time. ""Skipper"" deals in antiques (junk to some people). He has a bill to pay so he gets money from ""Henry"", a rich relative. ""Skipper"" has a map of New York city. One taxi driver knows who gave him a phony dollar. The agents follow her to her workplace and continue to watch her. Watch how they arrange to get close to her! Ann is a French interpreter at the United Nations. Steve Buchanan cultivates her. Carlos tells Ann that Steve was there earlier! Ann learns more about that incident and does research. [Why operatives should use a cover name.]

Steve visits Ann. [Note the unlocked doors in New York city.] Ann types a trick letter, it interests Steve. [Could this backfire?] Did his partner search her apartment without a search warrant? Will Ann be held in custody? She doesn't remember where she got those dollar bills. Steve found a pattern to where the bills were passed. They visit an ""Automat"". [Remember them? The original fast food place.] Who is ""shoving queer""? Not a little old man? In those days dime and quarters were made of silver. [They ""rang true"" when bounced on the marble slab kept on cash registers.] ""Skipper"" eludes a cashier. Steve is offered a job in Marseilles France. ""Skipper"" can get a job as a handyman next door. [Can you tell the difference between Dutch and German?] Ann suspects where she that counterfeit money in change.

Another bill was found, the young boy tells where he got it. Buchanan follows the trail. ""That's the house."" It was buried in the ground. Steve goes to the top floor and sees a shaggy dog. There is a map of New York city inside a closet door. ""Skipper"" returns with his groceries. He answers Steve's questions, and must go to the office to answer more questions. Ann will look after his dog. ""This is 880?"" Miller explains his actions, and why he didn't enter a Veteran's Home. ""You've been very kind to me."" The Chief will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law! William Miller shows his age or senility. He contradicts his lawyer! Steve Buchanan speaks about ""Skipper"". He served in the Navy in 1918 and was commended. He quotes from a book written by a judge. He is given a sentence and a fine. Is his money good?

This movie was taken from an article in the ""New Yorker"" magazine. It is something of a farce that minimizes the damage from counterfeit currency. It effect, it means robbery with a fountain pen rather than a six gun. It is a humorous story about a serious problem. The privately owned Federal Reserve Bank also prints paper money that steals from your wages and your savings, but nothing is done about it. Why? Would returning to silver and gold coinage prevent this? Yes, but they too can be devalued (and had been done since ancient times). There are no guarantees in this world (except death and taxes). The term ""Secret Service"" refers to counter-intelligence agencies around the world. The US Secret Service was formed in the 1860s to catch Confederate spies, then other foreign spies afterwards. You can find references in old novels and movies made before the 1940s. After the Secret Service obtained evidence that convicted a Senator and Congressmen in the Teapot Dome scandal, Congress cut their budget and turned their work over to the FBI.",1377648000,7,3491,4.690048939641109

8568110,4,B00BGGITV4,"An enjoyable B&W comedy from the late Forties.  Burt Lancaster is the New York City agent for the Secret Service deputed to find and arrest a particularly sloppy counterfeiter (Edmund Gwenn) who steadily, but singly, passes off fake one-dollar bills so crudely done that the President's name is spelled ""Wahsington.""  Dorothy McGuire is the United Nations interpreter who meets Burt cute and also happens to live in the same building as the low-key bad guy.  Comic complications ensue, more romantic than farcical, but we the audience have the fun of watching Gwenn unwittingly eluding Lancaster's grasp because the G-Man's ""profiling"" techniques just don't hold water against such a singular character.  Well done; not a blockbuster but with this cast certainly worth a viewing or two.  Based on a real case; there really was a file no. 880 for the elusive passer of the dead President.",1499385600,,887,5.089655172413793

The Secret Service, which investigates all counterfeiting crimes, assigned #880 as his case number.  And, he was often referred to as ""Mister 880"" - the title of the film.  Interestingly, the film company paid Mr. Juettner for basing the film on his life - and he made more money from it than he did in his entire counterfeiting career.

Burt Lancaster, Dorothy McGuire, and Edmund Gwenn turned in stellar performances in their roles.  I'm glad it's available on DVD video.",1463270400,,729,4.846774193548387
