7993864,1,B00009WHT4,"just like what the other reviews say, this is not the full film.  this is only about 45 minutes long and appears to be fight scenes from the full movie. I should not have spent $16 for this DVD.  I watched the full movie on you tube.",1418256000,,233,3.9361702127659575
7993865,5,B00009WHT4,THIS IS A MUST HAVE IF YOUR INTO GREAT SWORDSMANSHIP. THE ACTION IS GREAT AS WELL AS THE STORY AND THE FIGHT SCENES ARE ONE TO REMEMBER,1352937600,,135,4.037037037037037
7993866,1,B00009WHT4,"I don't know where the last guy got his DVD from, but I would love a copy since I liked this movie when I saw in on VHS many years ago. I got the same DVD everyone else did, the one that skips from scene to scene, and seems like its scratched or something. I returned this movie 2 times to the store I bought it from because I thought it was defective. Now I see that that is just the way the movie was made. It's a shame really, because it is a decent film. If anyone out there can find this movie released by a different company please contact me, because I would like a copy.",1108857600,3,578,3.906779661016949
7993867,1,B00009WHT4,"This will be hard to explain!! I got this dvd and what it does is that in 12 minutes or so into the film the movie will cut to the instant action thing! You see, this DVD played all 1 hour and 50 minutes of the feature film on my dvd player for my computer! But it will do that 12 minutes then skip to instant action thing on regular DVD players or PS2 and I assume XBOX! But still I wouldn't recommend this product! Video Asia is just another piece of garbage DVD kung fu company who are uneducated monogloids who can't pay attention to what they do! I really like this movie despite bad picture but I'd trust bootlegs over

this crap!",1106524800,5,636,4.129032258064516
7993868,1,B00009WHT4,"I should have seen these reviews first, I usually do. this DVD is totally unwatchable. Each scene cuts to the next and you trhink something is wrong with the disc or player. Theire is also no apparent time line here, maybe 20 years ago we could have called this non-linearity ""brilliant"" but something is wrong with this disc, as the one reviwer stated, they should have QC'd this DVD before selling it.",1090195200,8,403,4.611111111111111
7993869,1,B00009WHT4,"Word of warning about this DVD - it's not the complete film.
It seems to be a collection of action scenes from the film, mixed together in a slapdash fashion, it is certainly NOT the full film.
For example during one fight scene there is a dead woman who you have no idea how/why she's there. The movie skips and then in the next scene she's alive and running around while the two who were fighting in the previous scene are now together and fighting a different character altogether.
Very disappointing.
Maybe the video is the complete film, but avoid this one.",1081728000,5,562,4.519607843137255
7993870,1,B00009WHT4,"...Two problems I had with this DVD:
(1) The movie kept jumping (skipping) scenes.  The DVD itself has no scratch and looks clean.  I tried with different players and had the same problem.  I believe it was not authored correctly, perhaps with the Insta Action stuffs.  They should have tested their products first (d*mn it).
(2) My mistake.  I mistook this for One-Armed SwordsmAn, the original movie, starring the same Jimmy Wang Yu.  The title of this DVD uses the plural form, ""SwordmEn"".",1071100800,4,492,4.867469879518072
7993871,5,B00009WHT4,"Whoever thought to put the two one armed swordsmen together was a genius!
David and Wang Yu(plus other Shaw Studio statrs) give the One Armed series a last hoorah.
The plot could use some work,but certain segments are classics unto themselves. Look for the scene in a restaurant where Wang Yu shouts:`Who wants to die!'.Only he can pull off such a line convincingly.
The DVD is hosted by Shaw Star Philip Ko Fei who demonstrates and give a terrific interview with plenty of behind the scenes stories.
Highlight of the DVD is a great interview with Wang Yu himself,and a great documentary on the Shaw Bros.,hosted by David Chiang.
You can't go wrong with this one!!",1063411200,,664,4.732758620689655
