2839072,4,B000QJFISY,"Alastair Sim surrounded by a group of established and upcoming pros in a story about spying during  World War Two...what could be better? Very little, as it turns out. A joy to watch. Picture quality is a step (alright, a step and a half) below what I've become accustomed to in the British product, but you will be so entertained you won't care. Time well spent.",1323734400,2,363,4.5
2839073,5,B000QJFISY,"COTTAGE TO LET takes place in Britain during the early days of WWII, when rationing was a problem people grumbled at, when Cockney twerps were bused out to the country and put up wherever there was an extra bed.  George Cole, who has one of those faces only a mother could love, is the leading character here, evacuated from his home and his ""mum"" and brought to live in an incredibly eccentric family estate in Scotland populated by servants and ""quality.""  Cole's cynical attitude melts when he comes across another temporary guest, a Spitfire pilot (John Mills) who has turned up in a nearby loch apparently shot down and his arm broken.  Lucky to be alive, Mills is given some plushy quarters at Barrington Manor, and a doctor and a nurse brought in to see to his healing.  In addition, the lovely young ingenue takes an interest in his case and the two of them quickly strike up a close friendship based on similar senses of humor and a thoroughly modern sense of fun.

However nothing is what it appears to be!  This movie will forcibly remind you of some of Hitchcock's films of the 30s and 40s, perhaps The 39 STEPS, SABOTEUR, THE LADY VANISHES most immediately.  Director Anthony Asquith keeps a chatty script going with all sorts in in-the-camera editing.  Watch them around a breakfast table, how his camera pans to the one doing the listening who will then swerve and grab the attention of a third guest, while the fluid camerawork continues in a pleasing, if somewhat dizzying, 360 degree pan.  Asquith really brings out the best in his stars, including making Alistair Sim seem almost human, while Leslie Banks, as the brilliant inventor John Barrington, is simply put, astonishing just in his being himself.  Was there ever an American star with so much of the ordinary person to him as Banks?  Maybe Spencer Tracy, but Tracy always seems so showy and fake-sincere next to Leslie Bank's eternal get-on-with-it.  Okay, so he doesn't seem like he's in the same movie as Jeanne de Cazalis, giving an over the top performance as his scatterbrained wife that would make Beatrice Lillie seem sober as Anna Akhmatova, but as though in recognition of this factor, they don't seem to have any scenes together, as though to say, it's a double feature--it's a witty surreal social comedy starring De Cazalis, and it's a slice of life story about the development of an innovative bombsight that stars Banks and the rest.  So the bizarre interplay of tones make not be to everyone's liking, but the story and the direction really give a lot of pleasure to an audience, especially the audience that always wished Hitchcock had squeezed in just one more movie during his Selznick period!",1208822400,8,2687,4.765086206896552
2839074,5,B000QJFISY,"Set in Britain during the period of WWII called ""The Phoney War"" which lasted from 1939 to around 1942, this movie really displays the deep fears,anxietys and loyalty issues present in the British people and their government during this time. It should be remembered that the Anglo-Saxons were a Germanic tribe just as the Tuetons were. The present British royal family came frome Germany. Good acting, good story--",1207267200,,415,5.117647058823529
2839075,4,B000QJFISY,"Thoroughly amusing and entertaining, with a plot and dialogue only the English know how to construct.  Alastair Sim is a delight.",1469491200,2,129,5.142857142857143
2839076,3,B000QJFISY,"Anything with Alastair Sim is worth seeing and this film has the added talents of a young John Mills, also always worth watching.  The film is clearly a bit dated, but I love war-era British films and this is a decent one.  Predictable spy-intrigue mystery with a few surprises.  Particularly delightful is a very young George Cole, Sim's protege, in one of is first films.  He would go on to a great career and do several films with Sim, including his greatest film ""A Christmas Carol"" (aka ""Scrooge"").",1467244800,3,503,4.681818181818182

The casting, directing, acting of this movie is top notch. You won't be disappointed. It has just the right touches of comedy mixed with thrilling suspense. Alastair Sims shines as always and John Mills plays a part unlike any of his others.
A winner.",1438819200,4,378,4.492753623188406

2839086,3,B000QJFISY,"No question the Nazi advances on Europe and England during the late 1930s and onward provoked many dreams of far off sunnier days as again the men, mainly, went off to war again for the second time in a generation, and the womenfolk were left behind to fret and help do war preparation work wishing to high heaven that they would indeed meet again some sunnier day as the old Vera Lynn standard had it. And those sunnier days, as this years commemoration ceremonies of the Allied victories over the Nazis and their followers, including trained spies and fifth columnists, did come. But it was a near thing as the Nazis tried to move might and main to even up the score in areas where they were deficient. Those attempts to short-cut their way to victory by espionage and fifth columnist work is the subject of the somewhat tongue in cheek and stiff upper lip film under review Cottage To Let.

Here is how the thing played out. Barrington (played by an eccentric Leslie Bank) a great inventor of militarily useful gadgets who insisted on working at home on his Scottish estate some of his inventions copied, copied quickly by the Nazis. That raised a red flag in English military intelligence circles, especially when they got wind that the Germans had sent a spy in to do some nefarious work. That spy (played by John Mills) posing as a wounded English fly boy Lieutenant Perry had a mission to grab Barrington and scoot him out to Berlin or some such cozy place.

But of course a British war film in released in 1941 is not going to let any nasty Nazis take away one of Englands own and so military intelligence sends in a counter-spy Dimble (played simpleton smart by Alastair Sims) to foil their plans. Perry does grab Barrington but by Dimbles nifty infiltration work they find out where Barrington is being hidden and the gig was up. Impostor Perry in the end went to his just rewards. And that was one little step to those sunnier days Ms. Lynn sang about. The plot line has been done before, and since, and the antics were a little over the top for such a serious subject so it is hard to recommend anybody seeing this one except to see how the British made such films work for the war efforts in those  benighted days.",1434067200,,2227,4.507425742574258

2839092,5,B000QJFISY,"Fans of Foyle's war might want to take a look at a WWII home-front story made during tne war in 1941 in England. A mix of a child refugee, a shot down pilot, a home-front bazaar and a mad inventor of war machinery, agents and spies, Scotland yard and the military all combine in a very English sort of story with humor, romance and mystery all rolled into one. This edition is remastered, an added plus. Actors are a roll call of the best of the English 30's and 40's: Alistair Sim, John MIlls (Haley MIlls father), a young Michael Wilding, and Leslie Banks of the original Hitchcock MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH fame.",1386806400,2,611,4.368421052631579
