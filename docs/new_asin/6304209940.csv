810876,4,6304209940,"However, the redeeming feature of this film was that it portrays contemporary Pakistan in a way that is sympathetic. As with ""East is East..."" there is plenty of humour but unlike the former, there is more of a story to be told. The son, coming to terms with a foot in two significantly different cultures and struggling to know his own identity in this. The father having to take responsibility for decisions made long ago and which threaten to unravel around him as his two wives always kept separate; one in England, one in Pakistan meet. Some of the story line is predictable, some so farfetched as to annoy. But the feel good quality is so warm you forgive the flaws which are minor. Uplifting, funny and reflective. Not a bad combination.",1366848000,,744,4.643939393939394
810877,5,6304209940,"Great performances, writing, direction, and cinematography. I wish that they'd mentioned what happened to Sajjid's other siblings: Nazir, Abdul, Saleem, and Meenah. All we know is they never visit their parents. Otherwise, this is a very worthwhile dramedy.",1366156800,2,257,5.7894736842105265
810878,5,6304209940,"Absolutely great sequel to East is East and now I want more.  2 movies is not enough of the Kahn family, I want to know what continues to happen with this family.  I am hooked on both movies, own both and can't stop watching them.  You have to remember it is the mid-1970's and Pakistan is different now, so you have to let your mind go back 35 years to a different time.  Acting is great, a different story from East is East and I miss some of the characters, but the story has a plot and comes up with a satisfying end.  Now I am waitng for the 3rd movie, PLEASE.  Make sure you watch East is East first, it too is 5 star.",1359504000,,624,3.952
810879,4,6304209940,"'The West' boasts all the virtues and vices of senior producer Ken Burns.  It is an epic, nine-hour documentary narrating the history of the American West, that vast cauldron of national mythologies, hopes, dreams and delusions.  Part of its  project is to demythologise the West, correct the Hollywood lies, where comforting legend was preferred to prickly truth.  When we think of the West, we probably think of John Wayne and Monument Valley, the White Man's Manifest Destiny, 'Go West, young man' and all that; so it is deliberately provacative of the film-makers to foreground the Native American experience, making their history central, the norm, with the white man's story something (catastrophic) that happened to them, rather than something the white man achieved.  This, though, seems little more than a gesture - later episodes deal with the usual, canonical white-centred stories, the Pioneers, the railways, the Civil War etc., albeit from an impeccably liberal perspective.
'The West' is a history, and features contributions from leading historians.  Unlike their British counterparts, who are obsessed with prosaic detail and unglamorous methodology, gathering information and than cautiously constructing narratives, US historians are poets, with a striking vocabulary full of expansive, Faulkner-like phrases, good at expressing the 'idea' and the 'myth' of the West, but not so persuasive on the fine print, the actual, unmythic daily realities.  There is a need to create and connect stories, to tame the unfathomable West, that can only fail.
This is a documentary aimed at the senses - the rich soundtrack is full of Indian chants, period recreations and glorious American folk; visually, the film offers eye-popping vistas of endless plains, deep sunsets, raging rivers and lofty mountains.  The vast photographic evidence is a continual marvel, lending these myths some kind of reality, and reminding us that the American West was probably the first history systematically caught on camera.  This edition takes us back to the pre-white period, the lives of the Indians, the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors and other European colonisers, right up to the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson's purchase of French land, and the discovery of the Northwest Passage.
The series is indispensable for anyone who cares about history and truth.  For all its good intentions, however, there is something wearily humourless and solemnly p.c. about the whole enterprise, as if the very excitement about the American West that probably attracted you to the programme in the first place, is somehow in bad taste.",1001980800,,2629,5.421568627450981

7865110,4,6304209940,"I loved East is East and finally bought a copy of the sequel. While West is West is enjoyable, it isn't really a comedy, more of a drama with comedic moments. George becomes a somewhat pathetic character, an outsider in England and now an outsider at home in Pakistan rejected by his wife and old friends. The ending is upbeat, but not very plausible.

Like another reviewer I also thought the sound was muddy and hard to understand at times and suffered from a lack of subtitles.",1399420800,,480,4.517241379310345
7865111,3,6304209940,"A sequel to EAST IS EAST (1999), WEST IS WEST follows the passage of George/ Jahangir (Om Puri) as he travels with son Sajd (Aqib Khan) to Pakistan so as to 'educate' his son.  However the process of adapting to the new culture after a life spent in Salford, Greater Manchester, proves more difficult for George than it does for his son.  Andy De Emmony's film makes some trenchant points about the difficulties of cultural adaptation, and how it is impossible to 'go back' to one's home culture and expect to live life as one did before emigrating.  There are some very funny moments in this film, especially Sajd as he gradually adjusts himself to alternative ways of life.  However the ending represents a bit of a cop-out, as George/Jahangir returns to Britain to resume his life as a chip-shop owner with his second wife Ella (Linda Bassett), leaving his first wife Raushana (Dhanalaxmi Padmakumar) to fend for herself - just as he has done for most of the previous three decades.  The fact that he can re-open the chip shop - despite having no money - seems a little hard to believe; and we wonder how he will be able to take care of his Pakistani family in the future, even if it means only sending them money.",1390694400,,1217,4.538812785388128

7865113,5,6304209940,"This is a wonderful movie that can be enjoyed by those who want to be entertained; it's hilarious, and those who wish to learn what difficulties immigrants from South Asia face when migrating to the West.  Some of these are funny, some sad, and some very poignant. The intergeneration and inter-cultural conflicts are touching, sometimes sad, and heartbreaking. Om Puri, the star give an outstanding performance.

If there was a sixth star, I would have chosen that.",1382745600,,466,5.038961038961039
7865114,2,6304209940,"Subtitles are needed or we got a bad copy of the dvd as we could not understand most of it. We kept trying to put the subtitles on.
I'd like to know if others had this problem with their copy. I am returning this one but want to be sure they are not all the same.
I have East is East and it is not this way.
Thanks.",1380067200,,315,3.6470588235294117
