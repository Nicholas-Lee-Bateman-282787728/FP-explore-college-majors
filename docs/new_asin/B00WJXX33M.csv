7132727,4,B00WJXX33M,"I enjoyed this movie.  It's a great, positive movie with a positive message.  We need more movies like this.  It was produced on a much lower budget than a lot of movies out there, but aside from some of the occasional acting, being by non A-list actors and actresses, it comes across on par with bigger budget films.  If you liked RAD, you'll enjoy Heroes of Dirt.",1463356800,,365,4.402985074626866

7132730,4,B00WJXX33M,"I grew up in the late 80s and was one of the many people whose lives completely changed after watching the movie RAD. I started riding BMX when i was 14 and never stopped - driven entirely by the feeling of riding BMX that was branded into me by RAD. Now I'm 30, still ride, and when i saw guys from one of my state trail scenes was making a REAL movie inspired by RAD, i freaked. Watching the previews, seeing so many people i knew, pros and godfathers of the sport i grew up with - i got that feeling again that i had when I first saw RAD. So, i finally watched Heroes of Dirt. I expected they would ""dumb it down"" as they say in the film industry, in order to make it more comprehensive to viewers who are not to familiar with the sport. However, i think they went a bit too far with that. Some of the scenes and situations are a bit ridiculous, but hey that's not what this movie is really about. It's about BMX today and how something as simple as riding your bike can change lives. Its about the community BMXers live in. Joel Moody is a badass rider, but i think his character was way off topic. 80% of the time, he was a good dude... the other 20%, he acted like a spoiled brat. When you watch RAD, you want to grow up to be Cru Jones (Bill Allen). When you watch Heroes of Dirt, you do not get that feeling, at all. SO, i took a Star off just because i didn't get that feeling from the main character. Sorry Joel, not saying your a bad actor - i just think they could have wrote you in as more of an idol. Other than that - i loved it.",1458086400,,1544,3.967845659163987
7132731,5,B00WJXX33M,"Awesome movie that you should all buy an own especially if you loved the movie RAD. Starring Bill Allen making his cameo as a actor in the Heroes of Dirt film who was the legendary Cru Jones in RAD. A great movie with a refreshing storyline about a troubled kid with a passion for bmx who turns himself around with a new love interest. A fresh idea that beats the hit an miss Hollywood films being put out. So worth the time ,money, an smiles this movie will bring you an those who enjoy it with you.",1457568000,,500,4.164948453608248

8713640,5,B00WJXX33M,"Thoroughly enjoyed the film.  I've never seen a locally produced movie so well done as Heroes of Dirt.  Totally surprised by the excellent video graphics, the amazingly well done acting, and an enthralling story line.  I did not loose interest at any point.  The plot continued to unfold at a quick  pace and did not bog down at points where it very well could have.  Thank you Eric Bugbee and all for such an enjoyable film.",1510099200,,425,4.526315789473684
8713641,5,B00WJXX33M,"This movie is just about sick.  If you're into BMX in any shape form or fashion, you probably loved Rad! and have been waiting for something just as good made today.  Little heavy on the drama to be honest, but I'm not really an emotions type of guy anyway.  Either way, a good flick that's professionally made showing off modern - meaning way more technically difficult - stunts.  Combine that with modern shooting and a decent resolution and you have a pretty sick movie.  Definitely a keeper anyway, and this seller has a great deal and ships fast.  Obvious no-brainer if you're into BMX at all.",1508284800,,598,4.59433962264151
8713642,5,B00WJXX33M,"Yes, I really love this movie. Iam a little bias since I played officer Grey in this movie. That being said, director Eric Bugbee did a fantastic job and is very professional. I was surprised when I first viewed the movie at the premiere. I walked away thinking, "" This movie is really good."" If you're into biking, or any sports, or your looking for a movie that will entertain ages from 13 to 30's this will be the movie. Note, older people loved it as well.

Sincerely, Brett Young",1497830400,,484,4.377777777777778
8713643,5,B00WJXX33M,Great family movie. It took a long time for it get finished and I'm glad its done. It isn't a high budget movie but the acting for the most part is excellent and the filming was better that many at this budget range. The story is appealing and relevant.,1496102400,,253,4.183673469387755
