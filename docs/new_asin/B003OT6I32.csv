8401688,5,B003OT6I32,"The market for this DVD is undoubtedly a small one--a pity-- and the music choices are excellent and the performance is as good as you are likely to get in this age where the French singer (or French trained singer)has virtually vanished from the scene.

Ms. Graham announced her credentials for this genre with her first CD--a French recital on Sony, a Berlioz recital including Nuit d'ete as well as arias from Les Troyens and Beatrice and Benedict. Later, on Erato she recorded a CD of French operetta arias that was almost as good as the one Crespin recorded a number of years ago. We are lucky that she was chosen for Didon in Elliot Gardiner's Troyens, a superb performance and for those who hunt out items not available through ""legitimate"" markets there is a Damnation of Faust with Jonas Kaufmann and Jose Van Dam taped in Brussels. This latter item should have been picked up for commercial release as it is a stunning performance for all three soloists.

Fortunately Graham has chosen titles that may not be known to many who would enjoy this DVD. Thre is no ""Si mes vers"", no ""Plaisir d'Amour"". I wish that she had opted for more of Hahn, but that is a personal idiosyncracy. And what she has chosen she sings beautifully for she is in sovereign voice. She has an affinity for the language that few have today and the only other singer who could match her is Felicity Lott. I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.",1330819200,8,1428,4.596078431372549
