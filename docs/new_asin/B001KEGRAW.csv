3664571,4,B001KEGRAW,"Very few artists come close to KD's immersive voice and music. She's a true legend and a born performer.  Every instrument is visible to the ear. The orchestra blends in well and lighting creates a great ambience to her tones.

The Blu-Ray visual quality and sound is superb. I would give it 92%, played on a PS3. Soundwise, it's a little softer than Roy Orbison's Black & White Night.",1240617600,,385,4.565217391304348
3664572,5,B001KEGRAW,"If you're a KD Lang fan don't hesitate to buy this disc. She is possibly the best singer I have ever heard. Every song is filled with feeling and her performance appears almost effortless. KD gets into character for each song, whether it's a sad song like ""wash me clean"" or a upbeat song like ""constant craving."" She's just amazing.  Her band is top notch and they use real instruments (with the exception of a keyboard that's used sparingly). And the orchestra accompanies every song (it's nice to hear real strings).

I wasn't a big fan of KD's Watershed album, but she plays a few songs from that album in this concert and I got to see them in a new light. There's one track that they could have left out, ""Paydirt,"" since it doesn't really match the feel of the rest of the concert. All of the other songs are great- and there's a lot of them!

The DTS Master Audio is outstanding. The 16 bit/48khz 5.1 mix is almost perfect (I don't know why they didn't take full advantage of the DTS MA at 24bit/192khz). I think the volume level on KD's voice slightly overpowers the instruments (yes, I know she's the main event!), but the band, orchestra, and backup singers are mixed extremely well. Overall, the video quality is excellent. There are some shots where the video shakes a little, but it's infrequent and lasts for only a few seconds.

To sum up, this concert is spectacular. I highly recommend it.",1239148800,34,1406,4.5236220472440944
3664573,4,B001KEGRAW,"I've been listening to k.d. lang for many years, but never seen her in concert.  What a fantastic concert!!  A consummate performer, she is all about the music.  Audio is excellent as is video.  Lighting is superb.  I agree with the reviewer who said: 'demo disc quality'.  It is evident that some guiding hand controlled a whole lot in this concert to this smallest detail from the small subdued audience to the outdoor lighting behind the strings. I think it could have benefitted from more audience spontaneity, or are Brits just that much more reserved than we?

Why only 4 stars?  Not possible to give 4.5.  I take .5 point off for what has been missing in many concert BDs.  Nowhere in the case is there a listing of songs!  One has to click the 'pop up menu' and scan the list up a menu line or two.  Also, nowhere on the disc that I can find is there information about the song (e.g the writer, or which CD it appeared on).  I'd think that songwriters would protest!",1238371200,4,974,4.404494382022472

Vocal recording is dry with incredible nuance.  You could literally hear her whisper above the full band & orchestra.  Demo disc quality.  Video is a little soft compared to, say, a nature documentary, but is basically crystal clear.  Performance features stunning vocals & a very talented band.  You probably either hate or love KD Lang but even home theater enthusiasts who are not into her music should consider owning this disc.

3664588,5,B001KEGRAW,"We have been bowled over by the performance on this program and we do not get tired of watching it. Not infrequently, we find friends and relatives who like kd lang. If they are at our home, we tell them: Have we got a treat for you!

We pop this in our BluRay player and within seconds we are showing off our surround sound system. Then kd's performance takes the cake. We've seen this disc at least a dozen times and never get tired of it. My personal favorites are Western Stars and Hallelujah.  But there isn't one track that I don't enjoy watching and hearing ... over and over.

Ms. Lang's voice, as others have noted, is spectacular. Her performance is a lesson in how to simply ""own"" an audience with total self-confidence. Her relationship with her band is a joy to observe. And the BBC Concert Orchestra gives her a great backup. The venue where this performance took place is interesting in itself, a former church.

In short, this is one of the best discs we own.",1403740800,,975,4.430167597765363

3664597,5,B001KEGRAW,"This remarkable concert film is the best I have ever seen.  I purchased the Blu-ray disc to add to my collection. Even if you are not a big k. d. lang fan, you will appreciate the exquisite editing and pacing.  Many films of this genre suffer from too-quick editing and lack of facial close-ups.  This production flows along in rhythmic waves, thus you are able to enjoy the singer as the truly talented artist she is.  Highly recommended.",1329523200,,439,4.589743589743589
3664598,4,B001KEGRAW,"The only thing I could wish for in this concert has to be some of my favorite songs instead of a few in the program.
The singer and musicians are doing a top performance, as are the production team. As a result, you will see a lot of details while happening, which is not taken for granted when recording events like this.
The sound is very well produced. K D Lang has her own way of telling stories.
It strikes me you could do a lot of practice to become rather splendid on you instrument. You will be able to copy a lot of good musicians.
But you will probably never be able to copy K D Lang`s instrument.",1320451200,,607,4.109243697478991
3664599,5,B001KEGRAW,"k.d. lang has an amazingly strong voice.  Until now, I never knew what ""Constant Craving"" meant or referred to.  The song has a very nice religious theme.  This has totally changed my perspective on who she is and what she sings about.  This is a pleasant concert in front of a relatively small audience, giving you a close-up on Ms. lang and her band.",1314576000,,352,4.453125
3664600,5,B001KEGRAW,"The performance is incredible and just further proof that kd is among the top vocalists of this or any generation. The phrasing, choice of material and pure magic of her singing make this ""concert"" a truly special event.

Beautifully set before an intimate audience and backed by a full orchestra, Lang does many of her standards as well as new material.

3664604,5,B001KEGRAW,"k.d. Lang's performance is just perfect and the orchestration beautifully compliments her voice and the band. There isn't a more expressive,clear,pitch perfect voice in pop music today. She effortlessly eases through songs from all stages of her career but her Canadian compatriots' compositions are some the concert highlights. Helpless by N. Young and L. Cohen's - Hallelujah are so moving her performance will bring tears to your eyes. Whatever type of music you listen to you would be hard pressed to find a more wonderful way to spend 90 minutes. There are not enough stars to adequately rate this performance.",1278288000,7,615,5.16

You can only put k.d. lang on the same line and in the realms and higher planes of Heaven - utterly immeasurable in mere human perspectives. ;)

Hallelujah are majestic. It is a perfect union
of song and performer.  She is backed by the BBC Concert
