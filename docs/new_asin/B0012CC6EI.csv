3086360,5,B0012CC6EI,"This is another great video from Tamilee.  This video consists of 15 minute segments that will make you sweat.  Tamilee has done it again.  The video also includes a bonus segment of yoga.  You can do a quick 15 minute segment every day or combine the segments every other day for a full workout.  I alternate the videos with Tamilee's Tight on Time. Tamilee is ""no hands down"" the best instructor.",1227571200,7,398,4.549295774647887
3086361,4,B0012CC6EI,"After purchasing Tammy Lee Webb's dvd Stretching for Beginners, I purchased two of her other dvds, including Buns, Abs, and Arms.  I find Tammy Lee Webb and excellent instructor/trainer...I prefer her to any of ther other dvds on the market.  The only downside, is that if one is new to exercising, the workout may move too fast to learn the moves, or to keep up.  It is not impossible, just keep with it and don't get discouraged.  You may want to get her beginner's workout to first learn the moves if are new only to keep from getting discouraged. Otherwise, if you are committed, or familiar with workouts, TAMMY LEE WEBB is the best for home works!  She is calm, encouraging, not at all cheesy or condescending.  Tammy Lee Webb offers a good workout with a down-to-earth, direct approach.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALL TAMMY LEE WEBB dvds.",1226361600,3,838,4.659863945578231

I felt as if Tamilee  was right there in my living room with me as we worked out together. I loved the new workout I can do at home, I even felt sore the next day as she worked me good!!!! I recommend this video and look forward to trying more of her new workout dvd's!!!! I highly recommend this workout if thighs or abs of steel was your favorite video in the 90's.",1217894400,4,459,3.831578947368421

3086364,1,B0012CC6EI,As someone who works out regularly I was looking for something I could do at home if I couldn't make it to the gym - I like working up a good sweat and feeling sore the next day.  This dvd did neither.  The routines were so fast that you could barely keep up with the sets let alone feel any benefit in your muscle.  I wish I hadn't gotten it.,1215475200,3,343,3.8714285714285714

8245052,5,B0012CC6EI,Do the cardio workout twice in a row and you will be shocked how much you are sweating in 30 minutes! Then add 1 lb weights!,1425600000,,124,3.8076923076923075

8245054,5,B0012CC6EI,This is the 3rd Tamilee Webb dvd I have bought - they are great work outs as they overwork outs for both beginners and intermediate users. It took a few practice sessions but I am truly enjoying this tape. My 4 year grandsons also finds it hysterical to watch me do the work out - if it keeps him happy and out of harms way it must be OK.,1403568000,,338,3.9130434782608696
8245055,1,B0012CC6EI,"I love the Best of Tamilee Buns, Abs, & Arms Workout however, I didn't care for this one. I will be honest and say that I only tried the thigh workout because that I wanted it for. I didn't feel the burn. She moved too quickly into various workouts and I just felt like I was wasting my time.",1401494400,,292,3.9661016949152543
8245056,5,B0012CC6EI,"Received this DVD workout in good shape and have been enjoying doing the workouts.  I have not got to all of them yet but the thigh, abs and cardio are all good 15 min workouts when I don't have much time to get something accomplished. Or I do two of them and definitely can feel you've worked out. So glad that Tamilee put the workouts on DVD.  I wish a few others would do the same. Can't beat some basic workout routines.",1387584000,,424,4.158536585365853
8245057,2,B0012CC6EI,"First, I really loved this DVD - when it worked!!  I bought this DVD twice and both would freeze or skip.  I could never get through a complete workout!  With the first DVD, I thought it was my due to my DVD player.  So, since I missed the refund deadline to return the first DVD, I bought another DVD to test my theory.  I was correct!  The DVD was defective, not my DVD player. I hope this information is helpful",1373241600,,414,4.1125
8245058,5,B0012CC6EI,"Having received this video a day ago, I worked out to this video last night and can't even explain just how much this video will work you out!

I am use to working out to TamiLee Webb's workouts, first the VHS videos (who remembers those after all of this time? Raise your hand if you do lol) and now the DVDs. I'm not in the least suprised by how hard her workouts are, but with this video, you will TRUELY be worked out! I was drenched in sweat after finishing her ABS workout, but yet, I know it will be all worth it in the end. I lost alot of weight with her other VHS and DVD workouts, but know that with this one, I'm bound to loose more. My weight loss goal was shed 50 pounds in 6 months, and I lost 45 pounds and 5 inches off of my waist from her ABS and BUNS of Steel DVD in under 3 months so imagine just how much more will be dropped off by the time this video wears on me. :)

If you're looking for something to help you loose weight effectively, quickly, and under an hour, you've got to buy this DVD! There are other DVDs out there that may offer the same amount of help in loosing weight, but no one knows how to firm, tone, and shape you like TamiLee Webb. :) I trust her products and have never had any reason not to. :)

Try it, you'll love it. :)",1348617600,5,1266,3.9375
8245059,5,B0012CC6EI,"I've had Tamilee's Buns of Steel on VHS since the late 1980's and have continued to purchase VHS players (along with my dvd players) simply because I cannot live without her Bun's of Steel workout... it was the absolute best lower body (doable) workout until I had to purchase this DVD as a replacement for my dead VHS tape :-(... this is my abosult new favorite. I just love it. I have many many workout videos, but as someone who doesn't like to workout that much this is the easiest, most inspirational and effective one out there, in my opinion.",1300752000,3,549,4.5
8245060,5,B0012CC6EI,"Its a very comprehensive workout video. She teaches the correct posture and method for the exercise. Its complete and very effective and you don't have to be there all day. The only downside are the stretches and cooldown, I think it should have more than what it offers. But other than that I love it and recommend it.",1267660800,3,319,4.517241379310345
