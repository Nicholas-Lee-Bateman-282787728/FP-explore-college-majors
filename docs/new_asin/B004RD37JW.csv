The actors and dialogue are maybe the worst to ever be seen on screen.  The special effects are horrid but that's not what killed this one. Low budget films can still be entertaining.  But this had nothing.  How did it get made?  The script had to be written by a third grader.  Some effects were funny, though, like the way the car and vans they use slide around like ""Herbie"" from Love Bug or they lift off in an airplane with no run way.  One reason to watch this movie.... can't think of one.  I know this last comment is tacky but come on, this is supposed to be Hollywood.  The sole female actress, the wife..they give her bangs to look younger but she's got to be 20 years older the character she's playing..got that Helen Hunt.. yuk.. face.  Sorry girls.

ICE AGE

I cant help it I love The Asylum and all their crazy flicks, add in the end of the world style story and I have to see it. I honestly don't understand all the hate that this film has received. I know it is a low budget Asylum flick but not everything came can have a huge budget for effects. With that said I did enjoy the craziness of this film, some things didn't even make sense. I love it.

Bill Hart is dropping his daughter off at the airport with his son when he is informed by a colleague that some volcanic eruptions in Iceland have caused a glacier to break off and head towards America. His daughter is already out of the car and gone by the time he hears this so he has no choice, he has to take his family to New York. It is a race against time as the two hundred mile long glacier is moving at an insane speed freezing everything along the way.

Writers Paul Sinor and Victoria Dadi who wrote Airline Disaster together in my opinion wrote a cool little B flick. Of course there are things that don't make sense [I will leave that to you to find out] but that is the beauty of these kinds of films. Directed by first time [and one time it seems right now] director Travis Fort the film moves along at a great pace as I was never bored I stayed entertained the entire time. Acting wise it is just what you would expect but I liked Patrick Labyorteaux in this. This was a cool little disaster flick that had a behind the scenes as a special feature on the DVD. I would have liked a commentary but still it was good.",1397692800,,1540,4.0927152317880795
4460493,1,B004RD37JW,The movie was bad...the acting was worse than a B movie...more like an F movie.  I would not recommend this to anyone!,1396656000,,118,4.363636363636363
4460494,5,B004RD37JW,I Love this movie kind of like ice age just with different people. it shows what mother nature and do. when she get's mad,1392940800,,121,4.083333333333333
4460495,1,B004RD37JW,"I've seen some awful movies in my time, but this one just takes the cake.  Worst acting.  Ever.  Worst direction, worst cinematography, worst special effects.  In fact, worst everything.  Some reviewers have said it's so bad it's hilarious, and they are pretty right.  On, and the science (or lack thereof) behind the iceberg moving at 200 miles an hour - seriously?!  Patrick Labyorteaux was great in JAG, but a leading man he's not.  Did a great impression of Clark Griswald though;  even when the world is in the middle of a major disaster, there he is, driving nonchalently along, reassuring his airhead wife in a completely unconcerned tone that ""Everything will be ok, honey"".  And this is while giant shards of exploded ice shelf are slamming into the ground all around them.  Lots of rip-offs of Day After Tomorrow, especially the last scene.  That just annoyed me even more than the rest of it.  One of the bad guys...seriously, why did he have a thing for their van?  There were heaps of cars all around him, but he wanted theirs, and he wanted to go to California.  Alrighty then.  And btw, that guy?  Worst Actor I've Ever Seen.  Ever.  But yes, there was so much badness to behold, that at times, I was just laughing out loud.  I'm glad I got to watch it for free.",1387756800,,1277,4.566371681415929
4460496,4,B004RD37JW,"Sure, it's not a big budget disaster thriller, but they did just fine telling the story. The acting isn't the best and the effects were sloppy at times, but it kept me entertained.
Best laughable parts:
-Snow falling on only 3/4 of the screen as family finds an abandoned house (and a gentle snow at that)
-condensation on camera lens as the 2 kids are coming out it the Lincoln tunnel
-sunny sky above helicopter.
-pitch black at 3pm but not 30 minutes later when they take off in a plane.
-all the Top Gun like fighter pilot scenes- and their really hokey lingo
I could go on and on. It's a good movie though and worth a watch is you don't take it seriously and with a grain of salt.",1384646400,,685,4.236641221374046
4460497,1,B004RD37JW,"I have watched movies made in 1940 with better special effects than this movie. I don't think I have ever seen a movie with as bad action as was in this movie. The script consisted of people doing a Verizon commercial.
Can you hear me? Hello, hello, can you hear me now??

Where on earth did they get those actors? Maybe if they had bothered to find actors who were appropriate for the parts and actors who could actually act, the inane script might have been salvaged a bit.

This movie should be pulled off the shelves, given the top Rotten Tomato award of all times, and never ever viewed again.

Horrible and I wish I had my 3.99 back and the time that I wasted in watching the train wreck called a movie.",1377993600,,709,4.276119402985074
4460498,1,B004RD37JW,"This movie is crap, but to be far it is made by an indie movie company but that doesn't make the movie any better. The plot is a giant glacier stars destroying parts of the world and family who just sent their daughter to new York has to go their themselves to get her back.  Now some easily stuff to say is bad is the effects a lot of special effects look like there not there. But the acting and dialog is just as bad. So in the end this movie is really crappy but if you want a movie to make fun of then this is a good pick.

4460507,1,B004RD37JW,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Horrible special effects, horrible acting! Really, a glacier breaks off a tiny island in the Atlantic, and they mentioned ""the whole ice shelf broke off and is headed this way!!"" Pfft. Terrible. What, a tiny piece of ice breaks off and now suddenly it accelerates to like 200mph and now everyone must hurry to Florida?? Why not move 10 blocks inland? And now the weather is changing? Really? One minute everyone is wearing shorts and the next, snow on the ground and the river they cross over is frozen solid in summer? How does a glacier change climate? Especially one bigger than the island it broke off of in the middle of the Atlantic far away from the North pole? I've never seen a block of ice change climate everywhere. Especially the one that broke off in the south pole that was bigger than Texas. This sucked so bad. One of the worse movies Ive ever seen. The first 10 minutes was so painful. I couldn't make it past 15 min. The acting super horrible. The acting so bad that a bunch of kindergartners would've done better. Don't waste your time please. Worst movie ever!!!

4460514,2,B004RD37JW,"Quite possibly the funniest end of the world movie i've ever seen.  If you can make it past the first 10 minutes of annoying radio chatter before the volcano blows, you will see some of the craziest renditions of disaster I've ever seen.  From a glacier that is traveling from iceland all the way to NY at 200 miles an hour to a constant barrage of 100 foot long ice shards falling for no apparent reason.

There's a scene where people are walking around outside and suddenly freeze up and turn blue instantaneously - then just a minute later, the van they stole is stopped and there are people standing outside without coats like it's warm.  The driver wants to pick them up and while they are debating this, another massive ice block drops out of the sky on them..

Even the snow scene when the driver gets out of the van (around the scene with the homeless guy) is super fake looking with the snow coming from multiple directions..  I agree with the other raters that the homeless dudes performance is THE best acting in the whole movie.  He just wants to go someplace warm..

Then there's the scene where they rescue a guy that is inexplicably trapped beneath a 20 pound wire shelf that his 7 year old son should have been able to lift off him.  You have to look past some of the lameness like this if you have any hope of watching the entire movie.

The footage used throughout the movie seems to be mostly stock footage.  Random traffic footage with no snow is spliced in between the blizzard scenes.  Their jeep becomes a caravan, then a jeep again.  Their plane changes from a tail dragger to a Cessna. There is even a clip of the blue angels flying in formation (with smoke trails no less) that is used to represent a supposed ""strike"" force that is going to launch missiles at the glacier.

Is it a waste of time? Yes - Is it the worst movie I've seen - No, not by far.  Just keep in mind that it should have been classified as a comedy and you'll get it.

I laughed many times during this movie.

My favorite lines from the movie - ""so you've declared war on a glacier.."" and ""This visibility sucks b*lls""",1352505600,,2116,4.357142857142857

Now my newest candidate for The Worst Movie Ever Made.

The entertainment equivalent of having a bone marrow biopsy. In fact, if a choice could be made between the two - I strongly suggest taking the big needle into your hip bone. At least you'd be accomplishing something positive with your time.

Because if you choose this crapfest of a movie: Be prepared for one of the most moronic, blatantly stupid screenplays ever produced in the history of film. Combined with the very definitions of ham-fisted, wooden, pathetic overacting ever put on screen. The sheer ineptitude displayed is almost beyond words to describe. Quite honestly and without a bit of sarcasm: I've seen elementary kids in their school plays execute better - and they were performing in construction paper and tape!

The only face of note would be Patrick Labyorteaux, a veteran of television's JAG. A reasonably decent character actor completely wasted in this atrocity.

Is there a movie crime against humanity category of The Razzies? No? Then let me suggest this horrid stinking pile as the first nominee.

There is no stable storyline. Five minutes in, OH NO! PERIL! DISASTER! WE'RE IN MAINE! Also, the jobs of the parents are never freakin' revealed! Like, ""Oh, I'm the father and I have a job where I get to have a radio and I can also fly a plane into a tornado with my wife and son and not worry at all because we'll come out safe."" The mom's like, ""Oh, I have some government job where I get to tend to a Morgan Freeman-esque senator in a fabricated office that's clearly all walls and no legit hallway ceiling."" (You see the black warehouse ceiling 12 minutes in.)

Patrick Labyorteaux is worthy only as a B-movie extra that gets disemboweled by zombies, and that's a stretch!

If Asylum attempted to produce a good movie with an original script, the world might come to end as depicted in this mess of a film.

Interesting how when the family first arrives at New York and get stuck in a traffic jam, you can see the endless line of cars waiting, with their tail and headlights on, then Dad gets into a confrontation with the crazy guy going to California.  At this point, we are under the impression that their vehicle is the only one running, all other vehicles have no lights, plus no other people visible.

Then as we flash back and forth during the confrontation, the cars alternate between long line of tail/headlights on and off.

I especially love how earlier, jets engage the glacier with rockets, and several other times, and each time they blow bits of it to smithereens gigantic chunks fly dozens of miles in all directions, crushing everything they land on.

Then near the end they set off explosive packs all along the glacier, again chunks of ice the size of buildings fly for miles.

Umm, not sure how to break this to the Asylum but air-to-air missiles used by some of the aircraft do not have especially large warheads, they destroy other aircraft mainly by exploding a stream of shrapnel into them, not mainly from the explosion of the warhead.

And, a glacier that size has trillions of tons of ice in it, the sheer momentum of a (LOL 200 mph) moving glacier doesn't just go away from some explosions on top.

4460521,1,B004RD37JW,"This is hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. The basis of the movie is utterly ridiculous to start with. A runway glacier coming down from Greenland and wiping out all the states up in New England? And the so called special effects look like something some second grade kids did by cut and paste photos on each other. Definitely a low budget movie, VERY low budget. Besides the lame ""special effects"" a lot of the ""sets"" used look like they were used by the same second grader's for stage sets for the schools no-talent show.
  One part of it just really bugs me. The main family, mom dad & boy, are trying to get to New York to get daughter. They have a car wreck and role their car. They find an abandoned van and decide to barrow it. Who ever left the van also left a big note taped over the steering wheel. It has great big ""!"" on it and says something about turning the key to,,, something. I never did get to read all of it. These people are in this Van several hours, drive for several miles, and nobody sees the note on the steering wheel!
  From the lame acting to the cheesy not so special special effects to the point of the movie, getting away from a runaway glacier, a giant wall of ice twice as high as the New York skyline moving at something like a 100 miles an hour, with the occasional giant chunks of ice as big as semi trailers falling out of the sky! Come on people! A ""Science Fiction"" movie, key word there ""Science"" is supposed to have something at least close to scientific principals. Something at least next door to the realm of reality &/or plausibility. You know, like for a glacier to move it has to be ""down hill"". It cant just take off cross country, going up and over mountains, travel a couple thousand miles at a 100 miles an hour!

4460523,1,B004RD37JW,"No one loves The Asylum and their ever-growing crop of cheap B-movies more than I do, but there's really no defense that I or anyone else could possibly offer for 2012: Ice Age.  Not only is this the worst film The Asylum has ever released, it's easily the worst disaster movie I've ever seen.  The storyline is laughably absurd, the acting is embarrassingly bad, and the special effects may as well have been done by a class of fifth-graders.  This movie is so bad that you can't even enjoy its mediocrity - rather than laugh at it, you just want to put it out of its misery.

Remember how air traffic in Europe was brought to a standstill by the atmospheric effects of volcanic explosions in Iceland a while back?  Well, imagine what would happen if every volcano in Iceland erupted all at once.  Now stop imagining because you've already created a better movie in your head than what you're going to see in 2012: Ice Age.  Here, all those volcanic explosions send the mother of all glaciers hurtling down the eastern seaboard of North America.  Canada apparently offers no opposition because the glacier is bearing down on New England within about ten minutes (which is strange since we later learn the glacier is moving at a speed of 200 mph).  Patrick Labyorteaux plays (badly) Bill Hart, a big, doughy scientist of some sort who grabs his wife and incredibly wussy son and embarks on a desperate race to get out of Maine and get to his daughter in New York before the glacier destroys the Big Apple.  Most of the ""action"" takes place inside the vehicles the Harts employ on their journey to New York.  On many occasions, all kinds of CGI hell is taking place outside, sending their vehicle hurtling and sliding around dropping glacier chunks in a hurricane of snow and wind - but you wouldn't know it from the constantly steady interior shots.  Even more strangely, a number of exterior shots then show the vehicle traveling down a completely clear street, with the only signs of winter weather being some scraped-off snow on the sides of the road.  Of course, America isn't taking this new Ice Age lying down.  Basically declaring war on the glacier, the Air Force tries to bomb the hell out of the ice floe with jets - and, apparently in an effort to confuse the glacier, these jets are specially designed to magically morph between F-15s, F-16s, F/A-18 Hornets, and F-22 Raptors; some of them even become invisible, as the number of visible jets in formation constantly changes from one shot to the next.

2012: Ice Age seemingly completes The Asylum's disastrous 2012 trilogy, following in the footsteps of 2012: Doomsday and 2012: Supernova, two movies almost as unwatchable and incompetently made as this one.  We can only hope that The Asylum will now get back to the business of giving us what we want: pop icons of the 1980s fighting giant reptiles and aquatic monsters.",1331942400,2,2885,4.694444444444445

There was only one time in my life that I felt sicker to my stomach then I do right now and that was on 9/11.  I love the scene when they talked to another place clear across the globe on a CB Radio, in there rusted out old POS Tercel. The son was a puss the entire movie, just like his dad. Crying in fear the entire time and acting confused, man up you little pip squeek. Your dad should have pulled out.

And just for the record if I would have caught that little pillow biting son hoarding those Lays potato chips in the back seat from the rest of my group. I would have straight up murdered him, which would be doing what was left of the world a favor.  And that stupid older sister running around in the subway with that lispy heroin addict Hanson reject was just painful.  The scence when the sister got to New York and the Hanson reject said ""comes on baby letsss go back to my room and fool around"" made me feel dirty and creepy inside.

I am ashamed to say I watched it twice, once by myself and once with my girlfriend, I knew she wouldn't believe it. My condolences go out to the investors, I guess there is a sucker born everyday . I was most impressed by the abundance of snow, one minute it is there and the next it's gone! I was also particularly fond of the directors' ability to use shots over and over again, ""roger over and out!"" It is difficult to imagine anyone would really buy this work of art! It is amazing that someone was able to dream up such a lame excuse for a plot. Especially when Senator Hopper is on his way to the summit with the white house involved. There wasn't one aspect that was realistic or maybe it was meant to be a goof on everyone that watches it. Oh, I almost forgot, Nelson was quite a star, especially when he runs after the stolen van which is traveling at great speed over the frozen river until it hits something and sinks. I wonder if there was a script or did they ad lib the entire movie? I think I will pass on the book!

I don't write many reviews, but I couldn't pass up the chance to help someone avoid this stinker. I am an avid fan of apocalyptic fiction and haven't seen one of these genre movies that I didn't like in some way, until now.

Let's start with the acting:
It was painful to watch these supposed actors portray these weak parts. They were not believable in the remotest sense.

CGI:
1960 films did a better job in this area. The explosions were terrible as well as all other aspect of CG.

Plot:
A rip off of The Day After Tomorrow in most respects, with a far weaker story.

Feasibility:
In one scene you see several people frozen where they stand. Then directly afterward you see people roaming the streets in fairly light weight jackets and the dad constantly getting out of his vehicle to do something and he was only wearing a light jacket with a stocking cap as added warmth. None of these other people even seemed to be overly cold. There are so many other areas of nonsense that it boggles the brain. For instance, the glacier is moving at 200 miles an hour according to the kid and it was going to take them about eight hours to get from Maine to New York. General math tells us that, 8 x 200 = 1600 miles that the glacier would have traveled, not to mention how long it took them to find the wife and have the car accidents and so on.

The dad constantly keeps asking ""Are you alright"" after some kind of major crash they were all involved in. He must have said it twenty times within twenty minutes.

It was terrible in ever sense of the word. If you enjoy bad movies then this is right up your alley, but I wouldn't spend any money on this one if I were you.",1310515200,2,1690,4.2625

Pushing the limits of bad acting, grammar school CGI, clichs and atrocious dialogue, the movie almost freezes time as it plods along interminably to the hackneyed climax.

If the following lines were omitted, the movie would have been about 30 minutes shorter:

1. Bill/Dad! Get us out of here!!!!
2. There's no signal - I can't get through
3. Are you all right?
4. Where's the glacier?
5. We're going to New York/Manhattan - our daughter's there.
6. We need to find another route.

In a nutshell:

1. Lots of volcanoes start erupting up north, releasing the Godzilla of all glaciers which travels at 200mph and starts wiping out the eastern seaboard, one state at a time.
2. The military reacts by alternately trying to shoot it down or blow it up.
3. One family starts driving/flying, facing insurmountable obstacles to rescue their daughter in New York while outrunning the said 200mph glacier.
4. Need I say more?

Don't watch this even if it was the only movie available and the world was going to end tomorrow.

The movie uses the 2012 in its title to merely cash in on its blockbuster namesake.  Thankfully, there's little technological babbling probably because the writers didn't want to do any deep research.  Scenes fall upon each other with reckless abandon.  Cessna plane flies just as fast as jet bombers.  In Boston human beings freeze, but not anywhere else.  Teens seek shelter in a help unit and then flee the shelter to seek refuge in an abandoned building a few doors down.  Characters come and go.  Snow-covered roads suddenly clear and cars appear out of nowhere.  FX are really really bad.  I have never seen snow so blatantly fake--and obtrusive.
But worst of all is Patrick Laboryteux's dismal and dyspeptic acting.  Our hero father's expression never changes.  No change in emotion at any time.  His fear looks like his happy.  His aloof demeanor may have worked on JAG, but his presence in ICE AGE sinks any chance of heroism.  Probably the worst actor in any disaster film ever!  Sheilah McCullough's mother is equally abysmal.  Even Lady Liberty's assault can't save this true disaster.",1310256000,4,1360,4.973333333333334
4460566,1,B004RD37JW,"The acting, the script, the cartoon like special effects....just bad.  It was like it was written for a high school play or something.  If you look for technical accuracy in a movie, this one will drive you crazy! This movie should have been billed as a comedy.  Wait and see this free sometime if you must.....",1309824000,17,311,4.517857142857143
4460567,1,B004RD37JW,"This has got to be the worst film of the past 30 years, I thought I was watching an episode of Barney and Friends.

Can't think of one positive thing to say about this film.",1309824000,3,173,3.942857142857143
4460568,1,B004RD37JW,"Wow, what a load of crap. One of the worst movies Ive ever seen. The idea is great. The acting, script, and ""special effects"" leave a lot to be desired. What a waste of 4 bucks. Both WB and Amazon should be ashamed for offering this movie.",1309824000,2,239,4.1063829787234045

The worst acting ever.
The worst storyline ever.

4460571,1,B004RD37JW,"I'm fairly tolerant when it comes to movies. I'm no critique. But, even with my untrained eye, this movie sucked! The single only redeming factor is the potential which lays unrealized yet suggested by the title and description. After you've watched it, please come back here and tell me I'm right!",1309564800,10,298,4.862745098039215

I did try and get a replacement but was told that when the others were checked they were messing up to, so my money was just returned.  Don't know if I'll try later to get a good copy of the movie or not.",1517097600,,329,3.6714285714285713

I would have liked more special effects or at least a few 'wow' type effects...but it was fun anyway.",1475107200,,316,4.851851851851852

8438982,4,B004RD37JW,Not going to lie. I bought it because I am a fan of Katie Wilson the girl who plays the daughter in this movie's YouTube page. But I also love disaster movies and these cheesy Syfy network type movies. So I will enjoy it,1452124800,,220,4.0227272727272725
8438983,1,B004RD37JW,"This movie surpasses the title ""bad movie"". It's so bad it's funny. And like a train wreck, you can't stop watching. There are even scenes wher an airplane is flying, they cut away, and when they go back to the plane it's a different shape and color. If you watch this, approach it from an angle of making fun of it. Otherwise, you will be disappointed.",1446422400,,353,4.363636363636363
