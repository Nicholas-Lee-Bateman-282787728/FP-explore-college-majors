8389581,5,B00366BBM6,"This is a very informative documentary from the History Channel about comets, asteroids, and meteorites. The film initially covers where these phenomena come from and how they affect life on planet earth.  There are numerous interviews with scientists and also many high-quality graphics.

The program also discussed the fact that a catastrophic asteroid or comet struck the Earth at the end of the Cretaceous Period, which wiped out the dinosaurs and much of life on the planet. It's not entirely clear from the documentary exactly how that occurred, but perhaps that's best left for a separate film.

Halley's Comet and the Shoemaker-Levy Comet (which struck Jupiter) are also examined, as are programs to study asteroids and comets. There are many scientists interviewed throughout the documentary, and many theories presented concerning how asteroids and comets are formed. It's a little scary to think that a comet could hit Earth with very little warning, and there would be virtually nothing we could do to prepare for it. Hence the film's somewhat alarming title.  I heartily recommend Comets Prophets of Doom for ages 12 and up.",1368144000,,1137,5.19672131147541
