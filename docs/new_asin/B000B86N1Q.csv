8083252,4,B000B86N1Q,"I just watched this movie on TBN and I was at first a little bit hesitant. It's a movie about a family were the mother is sick and they spend their Christmas at their summer home. It looks like she is dying and it's hopeless. But then ( spoiler alert) a friend asks them to watch that old man, what they after some hesitation, agree to do. But this man turns out to be a blessing in disguise. I was touched by this movie. it also deals w/ some other issues the couple is dealing w/.It's a nice family movie.",1324339200,2,507,4.08
