1807147,5,B00007E1WX,"I vaguely remember watching Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey when this episode first aired in the 1970s. Nearly 20 years ago I first discovered the joys of reading the Dorothy Sayers Wimsey stories and have read nearly all of them.

I just finished reading ""Murder Must Advertise"" when I purchased this DVD set. The only disappointment--I was well into the book before I realized that Peter Wimsey and Death Bredon are the same person--something that's obvious from the get-go when watching the DVD.

I also own the Peter Wimsey-Harriet Vane set starring Edward Petherbridge--but Ian Carmichael, for me, makes a far better Wimsey.",1224028800,,633,5.076923076923077
1807148,3,B00007E1WX,"I ordered this because I loved the Harriet Walter and Edward Petherbridge versions of the Harriet Vane stories and because this is the best of Dorothy Sayers' Wimsey stories. It lacked the pathos of Edward Petherbridge's version of Wimsey and somehow the wit got lost in the rather plodding re-telling of the plot. Some of this is due to the production values of the period it was made: you realise just how more imaginative and expressive the best direction and scripting has become since the seventies. Ian Carmichael does a good job, all things considered, although he is too old for the role, especially when he refers to his older sister who looks young enough to be his daughter. It fails to engage your imagination and the Pierrot identity that Wimsey assumes does require that the story have an ironic tone if it is to be carried off.",1185494400,2,842,4.695945945945946
1807149,5,B00007E1WX,"I'm probably biased, as it was the first Peter Wimsey adaptation I saw. Very true to the book, which is also my favorite Wimsey novel, and all the actors fit their roles well. Of note: Paul Darrow from BLAKE'S 7, Christopher Timothy from ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL (a very different character here as opposed to his laid-back James Herriott role!), Peter Bowles from THE IRISH RM and TO THE MANOR BORN. The advertising agency sequences are wonderful--things in the advertising business haven't changed much! Some reviewers say Ian Carmichael was too old for the role and enjoy the Edward Petherbridge stories more, but I particularly liked Carmichael's portrayal of Lord Peter and can forget his age in his skill in playing the part.",1160611200,,736,4.943548387096774
1807150,5,B00007E1WX,"I strongly recommend this DVD to all those amored of a cracking good yarn.  The plot is well written and the players deliver their parts exquisitely.  I had listened to BBC cassettes of this mystery for over 12 years before finally getting to see the TV version and I was thrilled with Ian Carmichael's portayal of Lord Peter Wimsey.  There are some familiar faces in the cast, including Christopher Timothy, Peter Bowles, Bridget Armstrong, and Paul Darrow.  The dialogue is so smart and effective throughout the show.  The plot revolves primarily around who (if anyone) killed Victor Dean, a copywriter at Pym's Advertising and secondarily about the drug ring Chief Inspector Parker is pursuing.  To see how they are related, you will have to watch the mystery unfold.  If you really appreciate good English mysteries, you'll watch this show more than once, I have!",1071705600,4,867,4.979166666666667
1807151,5,B00007E1WX,"This DVD, along with The Nine Tailors, is one of my two favorite of the Lord Peter Wimsey series starring Ian Carmichael that were first produced in the mid 1970s.  In Murder Must Advertise Lord Peter works incognito, using his two middle names Death Bredon as an alias, at an advertising agency in London.  His purpose is to solve a puzzling mystery surrounding the death of an employee at the agency, shortly before that employee was to reveal some shocking information about criminal activities at work.  The story is classical Sayers, with plenty of red herrings to mislead and beguile you.  It has an additional charm in that it gives a good view of what life must have been like in an advertising agency in Britain in the 1930s (Dorothy L. Sayers worked in such an agency before creating Lord Peter, so the give and take of office life rings true.  You also get a glimpse of the sordid world of drug dealers and the unhappy frivolity of the Bright Young Things. I also enjoyed Peter's sparkling sister Lady Mary and his snobby sister in law the Duchess of Denver The mystery itself is well told and comes to a satisfying conclusion. The DVD also has a nice interview with Ian Carmichael and some Wimsey/Sayers trivia",1044921600,5,1222,4.638888888888889
1807152,5,B00007E1WX,"Murder Must Advertise is, perhaps, the most entertaining of the five Lord Peter Wimsey videos now available to the public.  Lord Peter goes undercover as Death Breedon to take a job as a copywriter for Pym's Advertising Agency to help Mr. Pym discover if foul play caused the death of Victor Dean, an employee of the agency.  As Death Breedon Lord Peter shows his comic side as he obviously enjoys having fun with the various employees at Pym's.  But more often than not there is purpose behind the humor as Lord Peter carefully sifts through a variety of clues and determines that Victor Dean was, indeed, murdered.  Catching the killer is not so easy and draws Lord Peter into the world of the drug dealing de Momerie crowd.  His various encounters with Dian de Momerie are highlights of the video.
Ian Carmichael was born to play Lord Peter.  Add to that statement the obvious care with which Carmichael prepares for each scene and you have always in each video of the series a carefully orchestrated and meticulously delivered performance.
I now own two DVD versions of this series and wish I had been able to purchase the entire series in that format.  As a bonus in the two DVDs that I do own, Ian Carmichael is interviewed and talks about his career and his work portraying Lord Peter.  I would have liked for the interview to be longer, but it appears as if the producers cut the interview into parts to put into the various titles of the series.
In any format, I can highly recommend Murder Must Advertise along with each of the remaining titles in this series which is now complete.",997747200,13,1592,4.6007067137809186
1807153,5,B00007E1WX,"It took only a quarter century to catch up with <Lord Peter Wimsey: Murder Must Advertise> and I am eternally grateful to Acorn Media for  making it available, along with ""Clouds of Witness"" and ""The  Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club.""
Yes, ""Five Red  Herrings"" and ""The Nine Tailors"" are due soon.  Having  read the book several times, I can say that the dramatization is not only  faithful to the plot but also to the comic tone of the original. Sayers  herself did work in an advertising agency and she perfectly catches the  chaos, the frustrations, and the high spirits that pervade such an  establishment.
  Even more on video than in the novel is each character  fully realized. When Wimsey (working under an alias) first enters the  secretaries' room, the more flamboyant of the women (played by Fiona  Walker) is found coffee cup high in the air and sheet of advertising copy  low in hand, thereby establishing her character perfectly. She can also  quote Latin tags and Shakespeare with colloquial ease.  The stuffy head of  the firm, Mr. Pym, is played by Peter Pratt, well known to Gilbert &  Sullivan buffs as the comic lead at the D'Oyly Carte several generations  ago.  The ubiquitous Peter Bowles plays the villainous Major Milligan as  a dope dealer to the ""bright young things"" who still knows when  to apologize for rudeness. Mark Eden continues his role as Chief Inspector  Parker, now Wimsey's brother-in-law since marrying into the family after  the ""Clouds of Witness"" case. If I cannot warm up to Lady Mary  (Rachel Herbert), it is perhaps because of her smugness that tries to be  charming but (for me) just misses.
  Possibly the best realized  character is Bridget Armstrong's Dian de Momerie, the fading sexpot who  knows she is doomed by her associates, her drug taking, and the ravages of  time. Armstrong turns what could have been an utterly cliched role into a  sympathetic and believable one.
  And of course, Ian Carmichael is the  same bubbling amateur sleuth of the first two mysteries, always ready to  apologize for forgetting he has advantages over most of the others.  The  plot combines a simple whodunit with a complex howsitdun; and if you pay  close attention to the most seemingly inconsequential lines in the first  reels, you will appreciate all the more the solution in the last one. I  will reveal none of the plot here, except to say it is a lot of fun.
  The production budget is below that of the Poriot series, but the period  feel is just as good. By the way, when Wimsey (in disguise) is compared  with Bertie Wooster, the script writer might be indulging in an inside  joke: Ian Carmichael did play Wooster in a series on British TV and that  association nearly cost him getting Wimsey after he himself suggested it to  the powers that be!",965088000,46,2798,4.765199161425577

7975311,4,B00007E1WX,"Ian Carmichael was perfectly cast as Lord Peter Wimsey, the British Lord and detective. He is again with Scotland Yard detective, Chief Inspector Parker, played wonderfully by Mark Eden. This four part series could have been put on two tapes rather than four tapes. The murder mystery is complex with a wonderful cast like Rachel Herbert, Robin Bailey, Gwen Taylor, Peter Bowles, Christopher Timothy, and others in this four part cast.

The mystery is set about Pym's Advertising Agency in London, England. I loved the location shots at the Museum of Natural History and the London Underground stop at South Kensington. It is one of my favorite spots in London to spend time in even now. I love the Museum of Natural History which has changed since the 1970s. Ian Carmichael's Lord Peter Wimsey is truly a memorable character along the side of Sherlock Holmes.",1471824000,,860,4.931034482758621

7975315,3,B00007E1WX,"Dorothy L. Sayers (1893-1957) wrote comparatively few mystery novels, but they were more than sufficient to make her as widely admired as the more prolific Agatha Christie and Ngaio Marsh.  MURDER MUST ADVERTISE was published in 1933; fifty years later it at last reached the television screen with a 1973 BBC production.  The series starred Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter Wimsey, Sayer's titled sleuth, which he played in several BBC adaptations of Sayers novels.

Now, there will no doubt be the pulling of hair and gnashing of teeth when I say this, but Sayers was what you might call a very literary writer, by which I mean that her way of telling a story was more important than the details of the story itself, and her sharp humor, her clever plots, and her intriguing characters have never translated to the screen very well.  This is as true of this series and these actors as they are the other attempts to put the novels on screen.  It doesn't work well because what usually emerges on film is a lot of people sitting around drinking tea and chatting, and few things can be more dull than that.

MURDER MUST ADVERTISE isn't quite that bad, but the simple fact of it is that you probably won't be able to follow it unless you've read the novel first.  And make no mistake: although she herself was a little ify about it, this is one of Sayers' best works, the tale of a young man working for an advertising agency who suddenly falls to his death down a spiral staircase.  Was it accident?  The office would like to think so.  Was it murder?  Well, there is a suggestive letter he was writing not long before his death.  The agency soon calls in Lord Peter Wimsey, who disguises himself as working man Death Bredon, takes a job as a copywriter, and soon finds himself up to his monocle in a drug trafficing scheme that is somehow worked out the ad agency's office.  But how?  And by who?  And what does all this have to do with the murdered man any way?

The whole thing is very, very BBC series of the period, if you know what I mean: everything is quickly done, and it is easy to spot where they really should have done a re-take or two; everything is very inexpensive, and the costumes and sets are never entirely convincing.  But we must give the show its due.  Director Rodney Bennett keeps it moving at a fast clip, and writer Rodney Bennett has done as good a job possible adapting the story for the screen--fans of the novel will recognize large chunks of the dialogue and many of Sayers most memorable zingers lifted directly from book to script.  Although he lacks Wimsey's icy quality, Ian Carmichael isn't bad as Lord Peter, but on the whole I would describe the actors as expert instead of gifted.  The DVD has little in the way of extras, but it does offer an interview with Carmichael that is rather fun.

When all is said and done, this really is probably as good as a film adaptation of a Sayers novel can be--and although the 1987 series starring Edward Petherbridge had its own charms and failings, this series comes out slightly ahead on the cast, writing, and direction.  Recommended, yes, but only for those who are already fans of Sayers novels.

7975316,5,B00007E1WX,"If you enjoyed the book, you will probably love this.  The period atmosphere feels spot on - a relaxed approach that barely conceals the fiendish machinations beneath.
For us,  Ian Carmichael is a perfect reincarnation of Sayers' sleuth and the screenplay remains substantially faithful to the book.  The rest of the cast is excellent, and the difficult role of Diane de Momerie is particularly well played by Bridget Armstrong.  Sayers would have loved this performance, we feel certain!

Recommended to all who enjoy the 'Lord Peter Wimsey' detective tales, and for those who would like to give one a try.  It's a cracker!",1299974400,,624,5.009708737864078
7975317,5,B00007E1WX,"It is, indeed, difficult to believe that we have lost both Bertie Wooster and Lord Peter Wimsey. Of course, by that I mean that Ian Carmichael, versatile British actor, died this year, 2010. While frequently playing serious roles after his discharge from military service following WW 2, his greatest contribution to PUBLIC WELL-BEING was in recreating for television two classic literary characters, P.C. Wodehouse's, Bertie Wooster, and Dorothy Sayers, Lord Peter Wimsey. Wodehouse is generally considered the foremost literary humorist of the 20th Century and Sayers is securely situated as one of the founding mothers of the modern British detective novel. Carmichael recreated both in such manner on television as to continue their lives far beyond what reissues of the books, were there to have been any without his characterizations, would have accomplished.
Murder Must Advertise requires Wimsey to appear as an amiable, but rather silly, substitute copy writer in an advertising agency. As Carmichael says in an interview, included on one of the two discs, he plays Wimsey as a fundamentally serious person with the surface of Wooster, which masks his detectival activities. There are a number of interesting characters in the agency, a bit of witty badinage, and a deadly crime, leavening the interaction. Lovers of the Sayers book should find this rendering to their taste, while newcomers may develop an itch for the further adventures to be found recounted in other DVD's. The picture and color are fine for 1973, and the sound as good as British accents can be made to appear to American ears.
Certainly, I had a jolly good time. What Ho!",1270771200,,1652,5.167910447761194
