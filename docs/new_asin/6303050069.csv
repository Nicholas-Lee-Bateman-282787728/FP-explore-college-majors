Iturbi, plays, conducts......even a harmonica concerto.....and duets with sister Amparan

Some very funny moments, like when Iturbi tracks Elinor Donahue.

Marvelous just for the music!!",1249171200,3,341,5.607843137254902

542049,5,6303050069,"If you didn't get it, watch it again!  They all have it.  Even the housekeeper has it. Oh, and get this; urban, divorced, career mom, dresses well, has three cute kids, and gets a nice man! And wait!  There's more!  The DOCTOR says to the kids (of single mom), ""It's difficult to raise children right, and your mother had done it right."" This is 1948!  Also, get this, for an immediately post-war movie -- they don't finish by moving OUT of the city -- they stay in it!  A family! How great is that?  There is even the odd little twist that the nice man, though sexy, I guess, for his time, is SHORTER than the lovely Irene Dunne, but it's not a big deal! And what about that cute song mom and kids sing?  Speaking of which, the music is great.  Jane Powell sings beautifully.  Later, believe it or not, there's a harmonica concerto.  This movie is odd but wonderful.  At first I thought it was the stupidist thing I'd ever seen.  Then I watched it again. Now I love it.",1182384000,10,970,4.263736263736264
542050,5,6303050069,"The shades of night were falling fast for Jeanette MacDonald when she opened the script for ""THREE DARING DAUGHTERS,"" originally titled ""THE BIRDS AND THE BEES"" till Joe Pasternak got his mitts on it.  One quick look convinced her that she was now no longer MGM's golden girl, and in fact the studio planned to pair her with the balding, glinty-eyed Cuban born pianist Jose Iturbi, who could barely be understood through his native accent.  He had a charming voice actually, somewhat reminiscent of Charles Boyer's, but everyone knew he was no Clark Gable or even a Nelson Eddy.  His talent was all in his hands, not his face.  As Jeannette MacDonald rang for another pot of tea, she continued to peruse the script, with growing dismay.  Not only was she to be playing a mother, but she had two grown daughters and a third, younger, but even horribler one!

Grown daughters--the aging star's nightmare!

Especially when one of them was going to be played by Jane Powell, then trumpeted by Louis B. Mayer as the ""new Jeannette MacDonald""!  Jane Powell is actually a talented actress and singer, but she lacks something of MacDonald's sparkle, sophistication and sexuality.  ""Something""?  Make that ""all""!

Many have noted the end of the picture, when Powell and MacDonald make up their differences by singing ""Springtide"" together.  You can see the sadness of MacDonald's eyes.  There's a bit of sadness, too, in Jane Powell's hairdo, which looks as though two glazed danishes had been placed directly over her eyebrows and left to hang there, like fruit, until the tree dies.  Jose Iturbi plays the new man in the life of the mother of the three sisters, who despise him because they are living in denial, hoping their dad, Charlie, might come home from the hinterlands after all.  Iturbi says, ""You girls wouldn't approve of me if I were Hercules--Apollo--and General Douglas MacArthur all rolled into one!""

He's no Apollo that's for sure.

Meanwhile millionaire Edward Arnold is hanging around to make sure all turns out okay for Jeanette.  It might be that he, too, was once in love with her, but lost out to the absent ""Charlie,"" one of those men who hates relationships and is afraid of intimacy.

The movie is a sad winding down of one of the great careers in show business, however all is not lost for those of us who love Jeanette MacDonald, especially if you can fast forward through the other scenes of the three girls interfering and scheming and pulling tricks.  Not that they aren't cute girls, they are, they just are misguided and obnoxious.  Obviously Shirley Temple and Margaret O'Brien were busy so they hired the other two non-Jane Powell daughters.",1143504000,6,2669,4.834801762114537
542051,5,6303050069,"This film has poignant interaction, on screen and off.  Jane Powell was at  the beginning of her joyful musical career and Jeanette MacDonald, a highly  revered musical sweetheart, was at the end of hers.  The two play a mother  and daughter and a tender highlight of the film was when they sang  SPRINGTIDE, blending their beautiful voices together.
Jeanette, estranged  from her husband for many years, falls for a pianist and orchestra leader,  Jose Iturbi.  Jane and her two sisters are determind to break up this  relationship and bring  their father back for a reunion.  Jeanette goes on  a cruise to clear her head and her daring daughters continue their  shenanigans.  Weaving in and out of one obstacle after another, all finally  ends well.  After all, this is a musical.
The film overflows with really  beautiful music.  Jeanette gives us WHERE THERE'S LOVE and SWEETHEARTS.  Jose adds RUMANIAN RHAPSODY IN A, with his sister, Impala, followed by  LIEBESTRAUM, HUNGARIAN FANTASY and THE RITUAL FIRE DANCE.  Jane opens with  ALMA MATER and continues with Leo Delibes PASSEPIED, Victor Herbert's  FLEURETTE and a vibrant JE VEUX VIVRE from Gounod's ""Romeo and  Juliet"".  You'll also hear a honky-tonk ROUTE SIXTY-SIX by Powell and  the sparkling DICKEY BIRD SONG sung by all the ladies.
A splendid musical  venture!",968457600,56,1324,5.0607476635514015

542165,1,6303050069,"This movie is so bad you can't stop watching.  The acting is beyond horrible.  Did actors understand the concept of acting in the late 1940s?  The passionate love story between the main characters is so milktoast, the viewer is absolutely shocked that anyone had marriage on his or her mind -- there certainly isn't any ""sex appeal"" between the bride and groom.  Were we supposed to fall in love with the girls' new daddy because he had an Italian accent?  The storyline is ridiculous, involving a real person who has a movie marriage to an actress who has a stage name; he, however, uses his real name and his real occupation (wonder what his real wife thought about finding out he was marrying somebody else). I really wonder how that worked...in real life.  The actors are all virtually the same age, except for Donahue who probably, to this day, looks back on this film as an embarrassment...no wonder she changed her name when she reached the age of majority.  Even the music is obscure.  I love classical music, but it seems like this venue was to show of the prowess of the pianist and the range of the singers.....but that's it; I will never purchase a copy of a single musical score in this film.  Seriously, I could NOT stop watching this disaster as it unfolded.  I kept thinking I was watching a spoof.",1406160000,,1314,4.576923076923077

The story line was was light ,but the entertainment value made up for this. I think this print is need of remastering as you will  see  the print is a little faded,even so its better print  better than Smilin through.

I am  happy i still have a copy just the same.

542238,4,6303050069,"After a five year hiatus Jeanette MacDonald returned to the silver screen in 1948 in the very agreeable musical comedy THREE DARING DAUGHTERS. If you'd already seen Deanna Durbin's THREE SMART GIRLS or Hayley Mills' THE PARENT TRAP, then this'll be a familiar plot. MacDonald plays divorced single parent and New York City editor Louise Rayton Morgan who, as the story begins, collapses from stress. Her physician and her three young daughters coax her into taking a solo holiday cruise to Cuba to convalesce. Furthermore, the three lively girls - Tess (Jane Powell), Ilka (Ann E. Todd), and Alix (Elinor Donahue) - are convinced that their mother is suffering from terrible loneliness and they determine to reunite her with their estranged father, a foreign correspondent gallivanting somewhere in Africa. And one of the unwritten rules in cinema is that it's not at all startling how far sheer pluck and musical talent can take a young girl. This is probably Shirley Temple's fault. Tess, Ilka, and Alix storm the household of a benevolent publishing magnate (Edward Arnold) who happens to be their dad's boss. They work their magic on him and he pulls certain strings to get their dad home soonest.

Here's where this movie veers off from THREE SMART GIRLS and THE PARENT TRAP. The Morgan girls don't know that their mother had taken the high road concerning their father. She's led them to believe that he is a great man, instead of the shiftless git he actually is. But, right now, the girls are giddy over the wonderful surprise in store for their mother.

Meanwhile, on the ocean liner S.S. Cubana, Louise Morgan is enjoying her own little adventure, having captivated renowned concert pianist and conductor Jos Iturbi (who plays himself in a nice bit of meta-casting). It's clear that Louise, though cautious, quietly basks in Iturbi's attention. So you can anticipate where the story conflict is coming from. The plot really kicks off when Louise returns to New York.

THREE DARING DAUGHTERS is old-fashioned and hokey and predictable and I don't care. I really like this movie. Jeanette MacDonald, Jane Powell, and the rest of the cast are massively likable. Jeanette looks beautiful and vibrant in her stunning gowns, and she can still bring it with her glorious classical singing. Egads, the music! If you're a snooty piano-playing snoot, you'll swoon each time Jos Iturbi tickles the ivories, whether it's Liszt's ""Liebestraum"" or Mozart's ""Piano Sonato No. 11,"" or letting his hair down with his swinging rendition of ""Route 66"" (which he plays after the girls have done their own charming boogie-woogie version of the song). I love the lush ""Springtide"" as sung in harmonious duet by MacDonald and Powell, two of the soaringest sopranos in Hollywood's history. It's not often that you see a harmonica being so featured in a symphony orchestra, but harmonicist Larry Adler struts his stuff in ""Roumanian Rhapsody."" Being a simple kind of cat, my favorite tune is the utterly delightful and catchy ""Dickey-Bird Song,"" sung warmly by Jeanette and the girls (although, okay, the two younger sisters' singing voices were dubbed). All in all, THREE DARING DAUGHTERS is a fun and nostalgic time at the movies. My only bone of contention is that ***and I guess I'll SPOILERIZE it now*** we never do cast eyeballs on that ex-husband and so we're left speculating on who he was. You think it was Nelson Eddy?",1346025600,5,3413,4.973730297723293
