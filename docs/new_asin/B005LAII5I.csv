4747031,4,B005LAII5I,"Throw Van Damme and Chuck Norris into the mix and give Arnold and Bruce more to do and you have a sequel that is as dumb, but more enjoyable than the first. The action is better and it has way more one liners from our favorite action stars. Any movie where Dolph Lundgren steals the show is something you have to see to believe.",1345507200,29,328,4.140625
4747032,3,B005LAII5I,"Guys

When I watched the EXPENDABLES 2 I found it so over the top you can't help but like it.  The actors toughest roll is to keep their bellies sucked in, their hair neat ( see Arnie's) their voice deep (see Stallone's,) somehow he makes his dry bass, an octave lower.  They play aging jocks, with a bit of joy and a hint of mischief, not quite taking themselves serious.  The movie is written with the help of Stallone, whose memory still recalls  many famous ""one liners"" from other testosterone  flicks.
Yep, there is a plot, and tons of guys.  This is another chapter of the ""good guys"" saving folks from the bad guys.  There are cool stunts, sharp flying, neat devices, guns galore, muscles oiled and bulging, cool dudes so cool they can smoke their cigars on screen and get away with it, did I mention guns.  And, let the record show there is a token girl, played by Yu Nan,.  Not only a token girl, but to hit a couple of more bases on the how-liberal and accepting-of-others these guys are, an there is an Oriental girl, who holds her own against the good ole boys.

So it is actually a ""clean"" R-rated killer show.  There is no bad language, no sex, no drugs, no bodice revealing costumes on the chick, all the reason for the R rating is the splatter, spill, spots, spigots of blood and gore occurring during the action scenes.

The current 2nd sequel leads the door open for other Expendables, and if the audience keeps paying I'm sure our sensitive dudes will comply.  After all, they are all about paying back old scores, both good and bad.  In this movie they repay Church 13 million, so next time they'll up the anti, preform more stunts, and keep us coming back for more.

Enjoy

4747033,4,B005LAII5I,"""The Expendables 2"" resurrects every surviving action star from the 1980's and dumps them into a formula action movie with a tissue paper thin plot and bucketloads of one-liners, and guess what?  It's not bad.  ""The Expendables 2"" is entertaining, rolls with its own punches, and stacks one outrageous action scene after another on the audience, helped along by an unending parade of cameos by Jet Li, Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenagger, Bruce, Willis, and Jean-Claude Vandamme, among others.

The exotic opening sequence has a group of aging mercenaries known as the Expendables rescuing a Chinese millionaire from a rebel camp in Nepal.  Afterwards, they celebrate, led by crew boss Barney Ross (Slyvester Stallone).  Their next mission is a CIA tasking to retrieve a mysterious package, accompanied by a female minder named Maggie.  The retrieval goes badly, a member of Barney's crew gets killed, and the crew decides to seek revenge.  The final confrontation with a group of nasty mercenaries in a remote airport is part action thriller and part a collection of sight gags, as stars and former stars wander in and out of frame.

The violence is practically continuous but fortunately manages to be mostly over the top, along with most of the acting.  ""The Expendables 2"" is a fun way to spend a couple of hours, and recommended for that.  It helps if you are a fan of older action movies; more of the jokes will make sense.",1345334400,,1429,4.916666666666667
4747034,5,B005LAII5I,"""The Expendables 2"" is great! This is how the story goes: The Expendables are back and this time it's personal... Barney Ross, Lee Christmas, Yin Yang, Gunnar Jensen, Toll Road and Hale Caesar -- with newest members Billy the Kid and Maggie aboard -- are reunited when Mr. Church enlists the Expendables to take on a seemingly simple job. The task looks like an easy paycheck for Barney and his band of old-school mercenaries. But when things go wrong and one of their own is viciously killed, the Expendables are compelled to seek revenge in hostile territory where the odds are stacked against them. Hell-bent on payback, the crew cuts a swath of destruction through opposing forces, wreaking havoc and shutting down an unexpected threat in the nick of time -- six pounds of weapons-grade plutonium; enough to change the balance of power in the world. But that's nothing compared to the justice they serve against the villainous adversary who savagely murdered their brother. That is done the Expendables way....

The cast led by Sylvester Stallone (who also co-wrote the screenplay) (as Barney Ross), Jason Statham (as Lee Christmas), Jet Li (as Yin Yang), Dolph Lundgren (as Gunner Jensen), Chuck Norris (as Booker), Terry Crews (as Hale Caesar), Randy Couture (as Toll Road), Liam Hemsworth (as Billy the Kid), Jean-Claude Van Damme (as Vilain), Bruce Willis (as Church), Arnold Schwarzenegger (as Trench), Nan Yu (as Maggie) & Scott Adkins (as Hector) is great. The directing by Simon West is great. The story by Ken Kaufman, David Agosto & Richard Wenk & the screenplay by Stallone & Wenk is great.

The music by Brian Tyler is great. The cinematography by Shelly Johnson is great. The film editing by Todd E. Miller is great. The casting by Marianne Stanicheva is great. The production design by Paul Cross is great. The art direction by Adam A. Makin, Ivailo Nikolov, Ivan Ranghelov & Sonya Savova is great. The costume design by Lizz Wolf is great. The stunts coordinated by Dian Hristov, Noon Orsatti, Chad Stahelski, Stanimir Stamatov & Teodor Tsolov, fights coordinated by Don Thai Theerathada is great. The set dressings by Jaime Fernandez, assistant set decoration by Nikolai Nikolov & set dressings coordinated by Vasilena Boneva is great. The special effects supervised by Alexander Gunn & Ivo Jivkov is great. The visual effects supervised by Danail Hadzhiyski, Ajoy Mani, Stalin Saravanan & Stefan Tchakarov, coordinated by Kiril Georgiev, Vladimir Nikolov, Milena Peneva, Iavor Radev & Plamen Statev is great.

This is a fun and entertaining action film that does keep you entertained and is at times, funny as well. This is also a great sequel that is better than its original. Stallone and his crew is solidly great in this one, with a solid villain in Van Damme's Vilain. This is also a great action film that is perfectly positioned in the dog days of the summer season.",1345334400,,2894,4.9628865979381445
4747035,5,B005LAII5I,"Movie snobs should run away from this flick because Oscar is never coming calling for this entertaining, explosive, action romp starring the 1980s' who's who of action stars.  Sly Stallone (looking like Barry Bonds' lumpier steroid cousin) is the star of stars in this non-stop thrill ride.  He's joined by Arnold, Bruce, Chuck, Van Damme, Li, and Lundgren from the Hall of Fame, and Jason Statham is on-hand representing the new breed of action heroes.  The story is immaterial, but it's revenge-based, and provides enough excuses for our stars to blow the snot out of numerous bad guys, and take us from point a to point b without too many plot holes.

Have I said yet how much fun it was to watch this?  There are so many inside jokes about 1980's action movies that this will actually bear watching two, or maybe even, three times.

Yippee-Kai-Yay!  I'll Be Back!",1345248000,,867,4.74
4747036,4,B005LAII5I,"Let's get one thing straight.  You don't go into a movie like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Expendables/dp/B002ZG99A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Expendables </a>&nbsp;without knowing what you are getting yourself into.  If you've seen the first film and enjoyed its larger-than-life salute to big 80's action stars then you know exactly what you should expect from the sequel.  It's more of the same formula: Big on star power machismo, ammunition, and one-liners and simple on plot, exposition and intelligence.  The bottom line is; you don't watch The Expendables expecting any Academy Award winning performances.  If this doesn't sound like kind of movie that you would normally enjoy watching then you came to the wrong party.

The Boys are BACK: Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen, Terry Crews as Hale Caesar, Randy Couture as Toll Road and Jet Li as Yin Yang while Mickey Rourke is out as Tool but the testosterone meter is still off the charts.  Liam Hemsworth joins the team as the youngest ""expendable"" Bill the Kid.  The Expendables have been recruited by Church to stop weapons-grade plutonium hidden in a Albanian mine during the Cold War from falling into the wrong hands and it's time to bring in the Dirtier Dozen.

The muscle and all-star power are man-uped the second time around.  There's much more Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis this time who only appeared in smaller cameo roles as Trench and Church in the first film and there's more iconic 80's action stars that the fans have been begging to see like Chuck Norris as Booker a.k.a. the ""Lone Wolf"" and Jean Claude Van Damme as Vilain, and what an apropos ""villain"" he makes.  It seems Steven Seagal is still the odd man out due to a publicized disagreement with the producer Avi Lerner, although when asked if he would be in Expendables 3 his response was ""We'll see.""  Rumor has it that Clint Eastwood and Harrison Ford have already been approached for the third one as well with plans to acquire Nicholas Cage and Wesley Snipes to the Expendables 3 dossier.

Expendables 2 is a blast if you can appreciate it for what it is; it's the guiltiest kind of guilty pleasure and it makes no apologies for being what it is.  The first one feels almost like a dress rehearsal but the sequel is bigger and a lot more fun.  There are hilarious one-liners and bad puns aplenty and the chemistry between these legendary screen icons takes badassery to a whole new cinematic level.  The epic showdown between ""The Italian Stallion"" Stallone and the ""Muscles From Brussels"" Van Damme makes it worth the price of admission alone.

Bring on Expendables 3!  Yippee ki yay!",1345248000,226,2753,5.053097345132743
4747037,4,B005LAII5I,"In the follow up to The Expendables Sylvester Stallone and company carry on their fun conceit of gathering several recognizable and big star actors mostly from shoot 'em up action fare and return the majority of them to the screen and add a couple of faces to this outing.  Major players in this movie are again Stallone and Statham.  Also getting an ample amount of screen time are returners Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, and Randy Couture, while the (unbelievable) love interest/ sex appeal this time around is Nan Yu, someone who will be new to the majority of moviegoers.  Round 2 avoids cameos, giving a bit more screen time to some of the past film's cameo stars, such as Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzeneggar, and gives the funnest portions to Chuck Norris.  But it also greatly diminishes Jet Li's screen time though he is given one good physically active sequence.  Rounding out the players who get a decent amount of screen time are Liam Hemsworth (who plays the young and alive heart of the team of the Expendables), and villains played by Jean Claude Van Damme and Scott Adkins.

So anyone who doesn't automatically know what type of movie this is obviously isn't familiar with the typical fare of most of these movie stars.  If any of those persons are reading this review know that this movie is a hyper violent shoot, blow up, knife, and bludgeon people to death movie.  If you can't get past that description then know this movie isn't for you.  For everyone else just know that there is more blood, more spatter, more flying limbs and severed heads than you can shake a stick at.  It's really quite ridiculous and often times laugh-out-loud funny.  Fans will absolutely love the introduction to Chuck Norris' character.  I'll leave it at that.  The movie is paper thin on plot: in order to re-introduce us to the characters we are treated to the group of mercs known as the Expendables as they rescue a couple of guys.  After this rescue mission goes off without a hitch they celebrate but are soon given an assignment that they have no choice of passing up.  You know the type: get the secret information before it falls into the wrong hands.  Well, surprise! surprise!  It falls into the wrong hands.  Someone gets killed and they get stumped.  So they spend the rest of the movie, in the words of Sly's leader Barney Ross toward the bad guys, ""We're gonna hunt 'em, find 'em, and kill 'em.""  You can probably guess the ending.

For fans interested in the hand-to-hand side of combat and who fights who there isn't much by way of star-on-star action.  There are several scenes where our bad boys physically beat down any number of unrecognizable bad guys but the main character on character fights are: Statham's Lee Christmas vs. Scott Adkins' Hector and Sly's Barney Ross vs. Van Damage's aptly named Vilain.

This movie is far funnier, both intentionally and unintentionally, than the first outing.  There are one-liners being fired off practically as fast as the guns in this film.  Some of the better lines that I remember are: when Arnold wants a big gun he goes for the one that super-buff Terry Crews is holding and Crews tells Arnie, ""If I don't get this back your a** is terminated.""  Dolph Lundgren quips to Randy Couture before setting off an explosion, ""Better cover your ear.""  (Minor spoiler ahead)  When Li is about to exit the group Lundgren, who viciously fought Li in the first movie and constantly harped on his diminutive stature, says, ""Who am I supposed to pick on now?""  Li retorts, ""You'll find another minority.""  In the climactic fight scene Van Damme tells Sly, ""I'm outta bullets.""  Sly scuffs, ""That's your problem.""  And my personal favorite is when Sly tells Norris, ""I heard that you got bit by a king cobra.""  Norris nods his head affirmatively, ""Yes, but after five days of agonizing pain...the cobra died.""  If any of these little scenarios made you smile or laugh then you should have a few more smiles and laughs as you watch the movie.  It might not be worth full fare at the theaters but you'll want to check it out in some way.

My final thought is this: there probably won't be an Expendables 3 unless they tap some new blood and make a more serious, and smarter, action flick.  These older stars are fun to watch but the conceit of this film does start to fall flat.  I hate to say this but Arnold looks practically arthritic!  But maybe fans can petition Stallone with some fresh (or at least fun) ideas.  It's worth a try!  Put your ideas in the comment's section below.  Let's see if we can't stir something up.",1345248000,3,4576,4.647571606475716

I love the throwbacks to the old films they feed off of but this series is right on the edge of parody and serious and it works for the film it is trying to be; but it also shows you that even with their age the over the top action it could still work with a serious tone if they wanted it to.",1485475200,,568,3.991228070175439

This film's especially great for those who grew upon the old Hollywood action stars of the 80s and 90s.

If <<The Avengers>> is a homecoming party of American super-heroes like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk, <<The Expendables 2>> is like a homecoming party for all the old American action stars from the 80s and 90s, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, which brings some fond memories back to the generation, well, my own generation with good laughter lol",1484352000,,616,4.970873786407767

4747766,4,B005LAII5I,"Sylvester Stallone had a brilliant idea that came to fruition in 2010, with an action movie that brought together all the big names in the action movie genre, but there was a problem. You just can't fit every big name into one movie and give them all significant screen time, so you had to have a sequel. The more things change, the more they stay the same, however, as this time, the story was a bit better, at least for an action movie, and the cast was a bit younger, but the basic genre was still the same. Barney Ross's (Sylvester Stallone) team is once again brought together to do a job, this time there are some new younger faces, to complete what seems like what should be an easy job, what they weren't expecting was to stumble right into the middle of a madman's master-plan. As I said, the story wasn't as basic this time, things were a little more complex, but on a basic level this is still you're typical shoot em up action film, with bodies and explosions constantly coming at you. What I did like was how they change things up a bit and didn't just feature the same actors, even though many members of the team were the same. The one thing the first film was severely lacking was youth, and I don't know about you, but I'd much rather see Liam Hemsworth fighting with his shirt off than Sylvester Stallone. All in all, the sequel doesn't differ that much from the original, but where it does, only helps the series. The cast is younger, the story is better, and the action hits harder. If you're an action junkie, it doesn't get more exciting than the Expendables and the sequel will have you craving a trilogy.",1480291200,,1628,4.411960132890365

For a movie that used maybe 27 total lines (exaggerating), it was disappointing to see how rarely those few lines landed. Some were just delivered late - all of Arnhold's, others were just too quiet to even discern - Jet Li. Next time, do the action and then have the dudes voice over post production.

I did appreciate jibs within the film by the characters of their own Larger than Life Action Character status.

The lines are either irrelevant, poorly delivered, or anticlimactic.  There are many would-be classic one liners that are just plain dumb.  I know I'm using the word dumb a lot but this movie is really dumb.  Next, the action sucks except for Jason Statham's two fights.  Stallone is too old to fight.  Jet Li has a brief action scene which is pretty cool but too short.  The rest of the action scenes are disjointed with too many edits.  The movie is supposed to be epic, but it is just epically bad.

Stallone rules the movie with a great performance, and Arnold and Bruce Willis have more to do in the story than the first one, and the addition of Chuck Norris was great. But the real revelation here is Jean Claude Van-Damme. I have never been a big JCVD fan until I saw him play a fictionalized version of himself in ""JCVD"" and now The Expendables 2. These two movies prove that he can really act. In The Expendables 2, he plays a great bad guy properly named Vilian. He is so nasty and mean that he is scary. It is a great side of him to see, and the showdown at the end of him vs Stallone just one on one is a battle that action movie fans have waited for forever.

4748814,4,B005LAII5I,"Released in 2012, The Expendables 2 stars Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, the leader of a group of mercenary veterans who are hired by the CIA to do their dirty work. In this case their mission is to go to Albania to retrieve something that was on a plane that crashed; they're accompanied by technical expert Maggie Chan (Nan Yu) to make sure they get it. When one of their younger members is murdered by a villain so villainous his name is Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme), their quest for revenge brings them to Bulgaria, an abandoned Russian military base, a friendly village and a mine of enslaved workers.  Chuck Norris has a glorified cameo while Charisma Carpenter reappears in a small role.

The Expendables franchise is a great way to get all those action stars from the 80s & 90s together for a fun action flick that balances quasi-seriousness with amusing moments and over-the-top action scenes. This ones even better than the first IMHO. Maggie works well with the team and they shouldve kept her for the third one; Nan Yus a cutie whos intelligent and formidable to boot, plus she has good chemistry with Stallone. The Bulgarian sequences are top-rate.

The film runs 103 minutes and was shot in Louisiana, Bulgaria and China.

4749300,5,B005LAII5I,"To start with, I've read other reviews that said that there were a lot of one-liners and the acting was stiff. I loved the one-liners and I found the acting quite believable. What this movie was billed as was a testosterone-loaded, action-filled man movie. It delivered exactly what it promised. Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas, Dolph Lundgren as Gunter Jensen, Terry Crews as Hale Caesar, Randy Couture as Toll Road and Jet Li as Yin Yang  and return with cameos from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. I missed Mickey Rourke as ""The Tool"" as he sat this one out, but a short scene with Chuck Norris and jean Claude Van Damme's performance as Vilian made up for it.

The Expendables have been recruited by the CIA to stop weapons-grade plutonium hidden in a Albanian mine during the Cold War from falling into the wrong hands. This is a job for the boys, but let's add one lady-Nan Yu playing Maggie, a beautiful, Asian martial artist.

I'm going to speak about all three films, here.  As long as you don't take it too seriously, these movies are SERIOUSLY a lot of fun.  It's great to see some of my favorite action stars having fun.  The dialogue is witty, and the banter between Stallone and Statham is priceless.  I like the fact that the actors acknowledge their age, and aging in general - good move.  The choreography of the fight scenes is the best I've seen since the ""Transporter"" movies.  The rest of the action scenes are just as crazy, over the top, and fun as you'd expect.

4749541,2,B005LAII5I,"The Expendables 2
 I referred to the first in this two movie series as The Explodeables.  If we call this one The Explodeables 2 our readers would get the right idea.  If your idea of good entertainment fun is watching most of the movie action heroes of the last 30 years all together in a single film cracking jokes and shooting people, this is the one for you.
 Right at the beginning of the film Arnold Scharzenegger says to Sylvester Stallone This is embarrassing. Stallone replies You got that right. There is a more or less constant referral to other movies the actors have starred in.  The actors clearly have no problem with tongue in cheek mayhem.  Also appearing in short scenes are Jet Li, Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme.  Van Damme if from Belgium, the land that has given us Smurfs, waffles and a B grade action hero but not much else.  Still, it is a small country.  Van Damme is the evil mastermind in this one.
 Stallone, Terry Crews, Jason Statham and Dolf Lundgren make up the core of the Expendables with the other actors coming in and out at more or less random intervals.  Young Liam Hemsworth, late of The Hunger Games, has a brief appearance as a team mate and the courageous victim of evil doer Van Damme.  When the script writer, Stallone, writes himself into a predicament, Norris or Scharzenegger magically appear, slay a bushel or two of bad guys and then vanish again.  It is very convenient.  My movie buddy doesnt go to see flicks which have less than seven pages of dialog.  I saw this one solo.
 In terms of movie goodness, there is almost nothing here to attract the interest of the movie buff.  The story is largely incoherent (I once saw a Portuguese zombie movie that make less sense but I put that down to bad translation).  The actors recite their lines and most of them show up only long enough to make a pay day.  But the directing is competent as we should expect form Simon West.  West directed Con Air and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.  He at least did a professional job.  This kind of film is almost to movies what mime is to acting.  It is something that people in any culture and any language can appreciate.  Good guys shoot bad guys.  But it is not subtle and not very interesting.
 In spite of many splosions and a huge body count this blood soaked comedy/action flick rates a sub-par two saw blades.  The R rating is deserved for death dealing on a Biblical scale but no naked people.  This $100 million extravagance has already brought in over $132 worldwide and may well creep into the profit zone eventually.  It runs a tiresome one hour and 42 minutes.",1435881600,2,2625,4.502118644067797

This from Gen. Patton, the genius of maneuver warfare and the winner, with his draftees, of WW II. There is an ineffable calculus to war deaths. The worst are the civilian juveniles. In our culture, even now, outside Chicago and similar, we must assume they are innocents. In the jihadi world, not so much. (If you dispute this, you do not speak Arabic. If you speak Arabic, go ahead and dispute this. Then try to escape the drones.)

4749896,4,B005LAII5I,"In all honesty, you already know if you want to see this film no matter the reviews. Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger together, punching people in the face and shooting everything that moves is an action fantasy fans wet dream. As such, a bad critical reception won't dissuade attendance (not forgetting, of course, that the film boasts a ton of other action stars doing shooty/explody things and yelling stuff).

Expendables 2 is not Oscar material, nor is it ever pretending to be; however the it is very self-aware and plays that card fast and often (on some occasions a tad too hard). Norris, despite his cultural cache, is essentially irrelevant to anything going on in the film and his screen time fails to add to the film. Arnie and Willis share probably the easiest and most engaging action banter, whilst Lundgren continues to impress in the interesting (for an action film) role of Gunnar. Statham is perhaps a little lost amongst the pile of muscled torsos all vying for screen time, but whenever hes kicking people in the face hes doing it as hard as he can just for you. Jet Li is in the first five minutesmaybe. Van Damme feels a bit underwritten, but his showdown with Stallone is really all you want to see and its pretty damn cool.

Ultimately E2 isn't quite up to the consistency of the first outing, but its super fun nonetheless.",1431734400,,1361,4.714285714285714

Fans of the first movie will be pleased filled with testosterone, muscles & a virtual who's who of Hollywood Bad A$$es ""The Expendables 2""  picks up where the first left off .  A bit darker than the 1st movie it still manages to keep the successful formula of humor , action &  little surprise cameo's.  Jean Claude Van Damme excels at being a bad guy which is a real plus when your larger than life hero's are well...larger than life! You have to find some pretty imposing characters to make the adventure a challenge when you have a cast like this!!!  I can see this franchise climbing to James Bond status because its all about the action & fun.

4750711,1,B005LAII5I,"Here Stallone tries to recapture old glory days on his second attempt with this testosterone injected action movie. And he fails!

I get it that he wants to show an adrenaline filled - guns a-blaze'n - bad-ass dialogue - cigar toking - kickass tattoo sporting rough necks. The s*** doesn't work here. If the script is absolutely horrible to begin with then this whole movie is doomed to go down like a bomber in flames over Berlin during WWII. And surely enough within the first five minutes we see just how bad the ride is going to be. With that said the acting is stale as cardboard. And the characters ooze out moronic lines while performing action scequences that are reminiscent of 80's TV action shows.

Like it's predecessor this movie lacks any semblance of originality - it is hallow in script and character development. Nothing good comes out of this film except the anticipation that there is actually an ending to this piece of rubbish.",1424131200,,948,4.704819277108434

The film basically follows the formula of the screenplay of the first Expendables movie. But this time around,they movie is a lot better as it has more talented action stars involved. They maybe old but they still can deliver the goods in an action flick. It remains excessive and over-the-top in its action scenes as well as the dialogues but apparently that is what this is the identity the movie franchise intends to be.

The best one in this movie was Jean Claude Van Damme; he was excellent in his role and really didn't come off as a caricature. I sure wish Arnold would get a new hairstyle; he looks ridiculous with his hair standing on end. The worst one was Chuck Norris; he came off looking totally weird and almost effeminate. Stallone just plays himself, although the movie could do without any romance at all, particularly involving him. Statham is just about my favorite actor and he doesn't disappoint here, Just a great escapist movie good for some laughs.",1418947200,,649,4.6521739130434785

Both were grainier than watching a 20 year old VHS tape on an ancient machine with dirty heads. Went to Netflix and enjoyed a beautiful picture.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Sylvester Stallone admits that he didn't quite nail the tone of THE EXPENDABLES. That love letter to 1980s action flicks and the stars that kicked ass in them felt a bit slipshod despite some enthusiastic directing by Stallone and eager help from recent star Jason Statham. Stallone hands the directing reins over to Simon West this go-round, but is still heavily involved in THE EXPENDABLES 2, which is a superior film in almost every way. Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Randy Couture and Jet Li return, as do Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger in expanded roles. THE EXPENDABLES 2 adds a dash of Jean-Claude Van Damme, as the villainous Jean Vilain, and two pinches of Liam Hemsworth and Chuck Norris to create a cinematic museum of immortal action legends. THE EXPENDABLES 2 hasn't suddenly gained Oscar aspirations, but bigger action sequences and more believable character interaction results in the film viewers wanted from the start.

Barney Ross [Sylvester Stallone] and fellow Expendables Lee Christmas [Jason Statham], Yin Yang [Jet Li], Gunner Jensen [Dolph Lundgren], Hale Caesar [Terry Crews], and Toll Road [Randy Couture] travel to Albania with new recruit Billy the Kid [Liam Hemsworth] and CIA agent Maggie Chan [Yu Nan] to recover a computer hidden in a downed airplane. The group runs into Villain and his henchman, who want the computer so they can locate a giant stash of abandoned plutonium. Vilain plans to sell the plutonium to the highest bidder, and CIA handler Mr. Church [Bruce Willis] strong-arms Barney Ross into tracking Villain after he steals the computer and leaves the Expendables in shambles.

In the weeks before THE EXPENDABLES 2 hit the cinemas, the Internet was abuzz about the possibility of it landing a PG rating. Something about Chuck Norris demanding it. What Norris wants, Norris gets, right? Whoever started that rumour was wrong  either that or the filmmakers backtracked at the last minute, because the film has plenty blood and gore. Most of the carnage is the CGI-splatter Sylvester Stallone used in Rambo, but an exploding head is an exploding head. The film kicks off with an extended action sequence in Nepal, where the Expendables unknowingly rescue Trench [Arnold Schwarzenegger], Barney Ross' arch enemy, and things don't stop going boom until the end credits.

The whole concept just works better in part two. The film retains its hard-hitting action beats, and inserts an appropriate amount of self-depreciating humour and nifty ""see what we did there"" references to remain buoyant. At its core, THE EXPENDABLES 2 is a generic, ripped-from-the-1980s tale of a standard-issue terrorist and the patriotic ass-kickers who fight him for country and cause, but that's the beauty of it. Jean-Claude Van Damme appears in the best shape of all the veteran actors, and his Villain serves up a mean roundhouse kick to the chest. Jean-Claude Van Damme provides just enough menace to be taken seriously, but the seasoned actor is clearly in on the joke.

The film also has THE EXPENDABLES 2 putting the key actors in many scenes together. In the first film, it was obvious that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Willis and Stallone were not often in the same room, resulting in more than a few continuity errors and a general aura of half-assedness. THE EXPENDABLES 2 solves that problem by lining up the talent for display. To avoid the ""are they/aren't they"" scepticism Michael Mann ran into with HEAT, Simon West lets his  big guns interact in tight spaces and during action sequences too complex to cheat. That's not to say all the actors were together in every sequence; early shots aboard a China-bound airplane were shot in different soundstages.

Fans of the material know this series is about celebrating action stars, and, while Sylvester Stallone and Simon West let the core Expendables carry the film, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris all get their close up. Bruce Willis is written into an action sequence this time, as is Arnold Schwarzenegger, who speaks only in lines recycled from his biggest blockbusters. Sylvester Stallone apparently allowed the former governor to write his character's dialogue, which was a questionable decision, but I laughed out loud when the Terminator ripped the door completely off of a Smart Car. Director Simon West of CON AIR fame keeps the action coming. West is not as articulate a director as Stallone, but he has a keen eye for carnage and explosions.

Things wrap up nicely after an extended final showdown, and I left THE EXPENDABLES 2 much more excited about the prospect of future films than I did in 2010. Sylvester Stallone has friends in high places, and of course we see all the original actors, plus a few new band of recruits for a whole new action packed legends for the next outing of THE EXPENDABLES 3. But of this film, it definitely loud, violent and over-the-top, THE EXPENDABLES 2 is served exactly as ordered and something I really enjoyed, as this franchise is totally magic and has all the actors I have loved in action packed films of this genre.

Blu-ray Video Quality  THE EXPENDABLES 2 arrives on Blu-ray with a solid aspect ratio of 2.40:1 in a stunning 1080p encoded transfer. Shot with Panavision Panaflex Millennium XL2 cameras, the film has a bold, gritty appearance throughout. I want to first hypothesise a bit about the final look of the film, as it appears some visual tweaks were done in post. I think the filmmakers did a bit of smoothing, perhaps to soften the worn mugs of the veteran actors, before upping the grain digitally. This results in some mismatched grain patterns that overlay slightly waxy faces, but all signs point to this being intentional and not some transfer-specific flaw. Otherwise, detail is frequently exceptional. Close-up shots reveal intimate facial features, and wide shots are deep and textured. West shoots with a softer focus in some scenes, but this doesn't diminish the clarity of the image. Black levels are solid, and the browns, greens and reds of the colour scheme are bold and well saturated. The film retains a pleasing layer of grain, and action sequences retain clarity. I noticed only minor aliasing, and compression artefacts are not an issue. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Audiophiles rejoice, THE EXPENDABLES 2 is the first ever Blu-ray to offer a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix that is optimised for 11.1 DTS Neo:X playback! Your humble reviewer has not yet upgraded to such impressive technology, but I can appreciate the awesome power of the 7.1 mix. Those of you with 11.1 setups will surely enjoy the added clarity and separation of the extended mix. The main mix is consistently impressive. This is an immersive, aggressive surround mix that makes you realize the value of a home-theatre surround-sound setup. Dialogue is absolutely clear throughout, and there is a fair amount of directional dialogue that pans the sound field. Viewers are placed amid the action, as ambient and action effects make great use of the surround speakers. The hum of airplane propellers buzzes in the rear speakers, the pop-pop of gunfire explodes from the left side of the room, and giant explosions kidnap the subwoofer and force it to shake the floor. Clarity is exceptional, and quieter scenes of dialogue are as pleasing as louder action scenes, which test the mix's excellent range. This is one of the best mixes I've had the pleasure to experience at home, and Lionsgate really delivers on this Blu-ray, which also includes an 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo optimised for late night listening and 2.0 Dolby Stereo Audio Description. Plus English and English SDH subtitles.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Simon West: Simon West is the commentator here. Even though I was grateful to be done with Stallone's shaky-cam ways, I missed his presence on the director's commentary. The commentary on the first movie was extremely insightful. Full of Sylvester Stallone's vision as a director, his methods for doing things, and his true love for making movies. Here Simon West provides a rather anecdotal commentary that is neither as engaging nor perceptive as Sylvester Stallone's commentary was.

Special Feature: GODS OF WAR: Assembling Earth's Mightiest Antiheroes [1080p] [21:00] A behind-the-scenes commentary with cast and crew that addressed the writing process with franchise potential in mind, the transition from THE EXPENDABLES to the sequel, expanding the cast and creative team, giving the audience their moneys worth and giving each character sufficient screen time. They also talk briefly about THE EXPENDABLES 3 and tease that they're bringing in a new wave of action hero apprentices to train. The most interesting part here was learning how Sylvester Stallone and Simon West divided their workload.

Special Feature: ON THE ASSAULT: The Real-Life Weaponry of THE EXPENDABLES 2 [1080] [14:00] A look at the real-life weaponry that is used in the film. Definitely a feature for any gun enthusiasts out there. But for me it was a very excruciating uncomfortable experience viewing this feature, where people seem to be so laid back in their approach to such dangerous weapons in how they were looking at all the horrendous horrible weapons for sale and a good advert to see why guns should be banned, which America does not seem to understand or learn from their mistakes.

DELETED SCENES [1080p] [5:00] A selection of five deleted scenes that were mostly just alternate or extended takes on conversational scenes in the film. One of the deleted scenes was a cool bit of fighting on Nan Yus part in which she beats on baddies with a hockey stick; another fight scene featuring Terry Crews and Randy Couture was also unfortunately cut. More Bruce Willis is always appreciated!

Special Feature: GAG REEL [1080p [5:00] A few minutes of the stars laughing and messing up their lines. This better-than-average gag reel shows the stars cutting up on set. I suspect thick accents had a lot to do with the flubs. There is even a random fight scene with Novak Djokovic wielding his tennis racket. The best part might be the zany alternative performances turned in by Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Finally, Sylvester Stallone again leads a troupe of veteran and current action stars into war in THE EXPENDABLES 2. Sylvester Stallone passes directing duties to Simon West, who crafts a leaner, more exciting film that strikes a good balance between serious action and self-referential humour. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis get beefed-up roles, and Liam Hemsworth and Jean-Claude Van Damme join returning stars Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Randy Couture and Jet Li. THE EXPENDABLES 2 is a rip roaring rollercoaster fun film and greatly improves on the mediocre first film. LIONSGATE's Blu-ray places solid picture and 10 out of 10 optimized 11.1 audio alongside a slew of interesting extra features. Highly Recommended!

4756792,5,B005LAII5I,"I saw the first two Expendable movies at the movie theater and I also purchased them on DVD. Even though I liked both films, I found this Expendable #2 even more exciting than the first one.  If you are seeking an intellectual experience this is not the movie for you; however, if you like action packed movies with lots of unarmed and armed combat and wise cracking heroes you should check out this DVD.

The movie has a whole list of old top action stars such as Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Norris, Crews, Couture, Hemsworth, Van Damme, Willis and Schwarzenegger. This band of mercenaries get together again for another action packed adventure.  Lots of fist fighting, knife fighting and a whole lot of gun play in this action DVD.

If you are into action movies with a whole bunch of old guys who are still very tough guys, you should check out this DVD.  This is a fun movie to watch and I loved it.

And had improved their aim, too, I suppose, as the only thing I liked was that each and every star dispatched bad guys with starling accuracy for nearly two hours. Heads blown off, heads chopped of with tail rotor blades... What's not to like? With the awesome number of bad guys in the world today it was  nice to  see some get their come uppance.
But the script was bad, the rhythm was bad, the plot was  contrived, there were only a few moments of Jet Li...

I have personally been an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan for many years and was pleased to see him return to movies after he got done playing the role of politician for a while.  The only real complaint I have about this movie is that he didn't get a lot of face time in it. At best it was like an extended cameo.

West's directing is outstanding though. He has a great sense of timing, which helps in many ways, particularly when major stars show up.
The Expendables 2 is better than the first film is practically every way, from character development to writing to better action scenes to directing to increased emotional depth to humor(that's a big one) to just being a lot more fun.
Returning from the first film is Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen, Terry Crews as Hale Caesar and Randy Couture as Toll Road. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger return as Mr. Church and Trench respectively. Having just had cameos in the first film, in this film you finally get to see then in action. Their still not main characters, but their respective fans should be satisfied. Charisma Carpenter reprises her role as Lacy, Lee's girlfriend, from the first film in a cameo. Also returning from the first film is Jet Li as Yin Yang, although strangely, he leaves 15 minutes into the film and is never mentioned again.
The rest of the film's cast consists of newcomers, such as Chuck Norris as Booker, Liam Hemsworth as Billy The Kid, Scott Adkins as Hector, Yu Nan as Maggie, Amanda Ooms as Pilar and finally, Jean-Claude Van Damme as Vilain.

4759790,1,B005LAII5I,"The fast-paced action idiocy that made the first Expendables a fun, if mindless, romp is completely lost here in a film that suffers from two rather egregious, and interrelated, problems:  a poorly written script that resulted in a series of shots that had to be strung together by the film's editor.  David Callaham (best known, unfortunately, for the horrible Doom (2005) movie) only had his characters recycled, necessitating Ken Kaufman, David Agosto, and Richard Wenk to come up with a story, and then Wenk was joined by Stallone in cranking out the script.  When you see that many writers attached to a film, you know you are usually in for trouble.  Director Simon West (no stranger to big budget action flicks, both as a director and producer) probably did the best he could, and then handed over the mess to Todd E. Miller (a competent enough fellow in his own right), who tried to stitch some semblance of a plot together.  What a mess.  While it is great to see this group of older action-hero actors together - Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Norris, Lundgren, and Van Damme - together with talented guys (and this is a bro-heavy movie, despite the addition of an under-utilized Nan Yu) like Statham, Li, and Hemsworth, they all deserve a better script.  Will Expendables 3 deliver?  With Stallone taking over story duty (and then bringing in two more people to help with the screenplay), I am not optimistic.",1407888000,,1423,4.851239669421488

4760003,1,B005LAII5I,"This film is so pathetically bad it stands out as a perfect template of everything that can go wrong in a huge budget film.  Forget the plot holes, the atrocious dialogue, the non story, you have to wonder how anyone could take a bunch of guys who are, in as of themselves, action heroes and give them so little to work with.  For those who like the genre, we like those guys, we get the Terminator jokes, how could each and every opportunity to save this film  get ruined so perfectly, borders on evil genius on the part of the filmmakers, no single human could be this bad, it must have taken and entire team.
Clearly a huge part of the budget went for very cheap hair dyes. leaving little for dialogue, continuity or anything that resembles a cohesive thread.  That some genius in Hollywood decided to give this franchise another go is a testament to wishful thinking and or desperation of finding anything live action that is not totally rooted in spandex wearing comic book heroes, but perhaps the third one's the charm, God knows, if this franchise were to go out of business personal trainers in LA would go out of business.  We would not want to create a job shortage.
Seriously this thing sucks and film students should watch and learn.  This budget and cast could have yielded something fun so easily, its a perfect guide as to what to avoid.",1407715200,,1352,4.520491803278689

Definitely not for all audiences, both the young and the intelligent, but for those looking for a mindless non-stop action film with plenty of cheeky references to 80's action films this works. The story had to do with an evil mastermind, in a giant cavern base with lots of henchmen, and nukes, and of course, the evil boss follows the predictable cliche movie steps to bring about the revenge of Stallone and friends.  That's the plot as best I can figure it out, and the rest of the film is just padded with cheesy action/violence.

4760996,4,B005LAII5I,"Expendable 2 is more of the Expendables film I wanted out of the first movie.  You have all these action stars in one movie just going all-out and kicking ass.  In the first movie it was more the Stallone and Statham show except for the opening and ending fight.  Here everyone has their moment.

You even have Arnold and Willis, who only had brief cameos in the first film get more screen time and more action time at the end which is great.  I like their banter as well and the nods to their old films like Rambo.  Chuck Norris also appears in this movie which is always a plus.  He gets some badass moment and they even work in some Chuck Norris jokes which I found funny.

Van Damm plays the villain in this time around.  I think he does as a good job in the role and it makes the villain more memorable.  The main villain in the last film was pretty weak, but this one works well enough.  He is intimidating, imposing, and poses a good enough threat for the heroes.  He does kill off a member of the team which is a plus over the previous villain.  One of the problems with the film however, is the fight between him and Stallone, which could have been better.  It was too short and Van Damm goes down too easily.

There is no point in talking about the story since we really don't care for the story in this type of film.  The action is fun like the last film, but I like the fights better here.  There is more action in this film and almost everyone has their moment, especially at the end fight.  The fight at the beginning was also very fun and it was better than the opening fight in the first one.

Another issue with the film is that, while it is majorly improved from the first movie, some characters still get some insufficient time.  Jet Li, after the opening fight, disappears for the remainder of the film.  While they get there moments in the ending and I am thankful, I still wish Chuck Norris, Arnold, and Bruce Willis had more time.  Sadly, it looks like we won't see them at all in the third installment.

Overall, this film is The Expendables film I wanted to see.  I did have fun with the first film, but this one delivered more of what I expected from that one.  If you are a fan of action movies then definitely give this a look.  It is a good throwback to the old days of action movies.  I look forward to the third film when it comes out.",1406332800,,2366,4.2

I think that there was only 1 or 2 legends that were missing.
The last part of the movie was more light hearted - though guys having a go at each other.

I loved seeing Jean Claude Van Damme again after so many years. This movie had older and younger stars in it and it came out great. Plus, the comedy is throughout the movie. Looks like there is going to be an Expendables 3, so if you like these types of movies, start collecting them, they are fun to watch over and over again. These movies are not just for guys, but for ladies too.

4761640,3,B005LAII5I,"Let's face it.  The reason this movie gets peoples' attention is the stunt casting.  Who can resist a movie that includes Stallone, Schwartenegger, Willis, JCVD and Chuck Norris, for starters?

This is definitely an updated Cannon movie from the 80s, with a bit more blood.  Sense and logic are gleefully missing from this movie in the exact same way that they were missing from the Cannon films.  While this movie has a bit of a sense of humor about itself, for example, naming the villain Villaine, it's still not quite as fun as the first one was.  And, some of the dialogue is a bit too self-referential and takes you out of the movie more than it should (for example, when a character tells Schwarzenegger that he's terminated, or words to that effect).

Maybe you may think that Stallone could only be seen as Rocky, Arnold as the Terminator, wrestlers turned movie actors, Bruce Willis from Die Hard and Mickey Rourke would be a foolish combination.  Anyone who thought this would find themselves as totally wrong.  The Expendables 2 like Expendables 1 is a fantastic all for one/one for all story.  There is action galore and there are no Camp Performances.  Every actor holds their own and no actor is a cartoon stereotype of their peak performances.  All are believable.

4762381,3,B005LAII5I,"The Expendables 2 is film that shares a lot of characteristics of a shot gun blast.  It's all over the map but it sure packs a punch and mostly hits the target at close range.
The good:
Explosions
Gratuitous body count and single-handedly keeping the the FX squib market in business.
Fun banter.
Lots of ham from your favorite action stars of yester-decade.
Tons of call backs to 80s and 90s movies from all of the actors past films.

The bad:
Plot:  Three reasons for the Expendables doing what they do as the story progresses all mutually exclusive
Jet Li literally stays around until his paycheck cleared
Terry Crews is not able to use his comedic chops and ends up being lost in the film
Jason Statham is literally lost and/or delayed from a lot of action sequences in the film

It's a fun film and is entertaining but overall RED and RED 2 do it better.",1401408000,,858,4.445859872611465

Jet Li appeared all about 3 seconds before he exited stage right. Trying to decipher what Stallone was saying without thinking back to 'Rocky' grew tiresome. I don't know how other people got through the first movie and I don't understand how this came about. I'd really give it a 'meh, it's not my cup of tea' so whatever.

Lol! But the reason I took one star away is because the story line is the same old same old. Nothing new. They go after a bully who made them give up their weapons then killed their hostage anyway. Same old tired stuff. It seems like they concentrated more on putting all of the oldies together and making us laugh than actually kicking out a fine piece of movie material.

Stallone, Norris, Swartzenegger, Van Damme, Statham, Lundgren, Willis, and Li. Wow! The only thing I really didn't like was the gore of bodies getting sliced in half by 50mm plus ammo rounds but the rest was great.

The time-reduced stars were not assisted by awful direction and script that made the film seem like a series of tenuously related clips hastily slapped together in an attempt to flog a dead horse yet further. Still, as it is the raison d'tre for the film, I knew it before I pressed play, and you will know it too before you do, I can't bring myself to give it a single star. It's an awful film with dire acting and delivery, but you still watch it like the boxer, not for what they are now, but for the memories of them in their prime that it reminds you of, and for that it justifies the second star.",1399507200,,802,4.114649681528663
