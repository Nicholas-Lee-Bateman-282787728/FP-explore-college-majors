profane sequel, Future Zone, which, sorry

to say, sucks! Robert Tessier is great in

here (and surprisingly in Matuszak's One

Man Force as well) and the lovely Dawn

Wildsmith is a fox! She's also very good

w/ Dave in Armed Response and especially

in Warlords! Martial Law is better though.

For the price for VHS copies of this now,

it's well worth it! Pick Up On It! - R.A.S",1153872000,,422,4.3076923076923075
8218909,4,B000VIPXMQ,"You'll know if the movie is for you in the first 5 minutes, David Carradine waddles his way on screen with his beer belly hanging over his belt and the the sleeves to his shirt missing exposing arms that'd you'd see on a person who hadn't exercised in decades. He then proceeds to get into one of the most ridiculous fights you can watch while affecting a really terrible country accent. For a guy who made his name playing trans-racial as an all purpose Asian man, it's amazing to think he can't pull off a semi-believable country accent. Oh and then he puts on a 1980s era Nintendo power glove for the NES. Seriously, it's a mildly re-purposed children's toy that he proceeds to treat as the coolest thing he's ever had. It leads to more ridiculous moments and that's just the first 5 minutes.

The rest of the film is equally laughable. They somehow manage to make people who are already ugly look uglier. Ever tough cop that's ever existed including Carradine look like they are headed to a camp themed gay bar to cruise. They even toss in some nudity that would kind of make you rethink ever wanting to see anyone naked for how sad and lonely it looks here. The movie is clearly a train wreck but that's of course what makes it fun.

Finally, you can count the number of times Carradine drunkenly throws up in his mouth and chokes it back down. It's a sign of a solid so bad it's good film.",1521590400,,1395,4.382239382239383
8218910,5,B000VIPXMQ,"In the crime-ridden future of 1991, FUTURE FORCE (1989) begins. There is no justice, and a corporation runs law enforcement. Sound familiar? Indeed, this is ROBOCOP without a budget or any real script. Wearing an awesome vest, Tucker (David Carradine) is a cop, using his big gun, along w/ kung fu to keep the streets safe. He also has a secret weapon, in the form of a robotic glove, that allows him to fight crime as a death-defying, super-dooper hero! The glove also shoots blue lasers! Be still my heart! Meanwhile, eeevil gangster types, led by the nefarious Adams (William Zipp), and his henchman, Becker (Robert Tessier- BILLY JACK AND THE BORN LOSERS, THE DEEP), are causing murderous mayhem, chuckling it up to beat the band. >SIDE NOTE: Check out the police station and strip club, where Tucker's cohorts lounge around, looking like bikers that have really good hygiene, and know a great dry cleaner!< Enter TV reporter, Marion (Anna Rapagna), who is just looking for her big break. She's trying to expose the corruption in the corporation, especially Adams, who starts yelling a lot, gesticulating like a runaway cartoon character w/ a cactus in his pants. >SIDE NOTE 2: The soundtrack for this movie was certainly conceived by, performed by, and can only be enjoyed by robots.< Anyway, the corporation decides to have Marion arrested / terminated, dispatching Tucker to do the dirty work. Not so shockingly, things get complicated, leading to Tucker's having to go on the run, w/ Marion along for the ride, giving Tucker ample reason to don the glove! Endless chase scenes, gun battles, and explosions erupt. >SIDE NOTE 3: Tucker's beer gut enhances his martial arts, and gun-play, especially when taking on those ultra-clean, be-vested, tree-armed, poodle-haired, biker type cops!< Oh dear me! Tucker's now wanted for murder! Is this a put up job? Is he a victim of the very corporation he worked for? Is there no end to the bitter irony of futuristic movies from the ancient past? Can Tucker evade capture / death, long enough to dole out some vengeance on Adams and Becker? Oh, by god, yes! >SIDE NOTE 4: Nothing says classic, like a scene where a preacher blows a helicopter out of the air w/ a rocket launcher!< The junk yard showdown features the Tucker / Becker face off, w/ punches that sound like someone beating a log w/ a a sack of tomatoes. It also has the sublime ""remote control, flying robo-arm sequence""! Do not miss it! By comparison, the finale is anticlimactic, in spite of the overuse of firearms! Yes, praise the heavenly host, there is a sequel: FUTURE ZONE...  P.S.- The limp, lackluster end credits song shall haunt my dreams forever!...",1509840000,2,2673,4.8618421052631575
8218911,5,B000VIPXMQ,"First, this is a bad movie.  It was purchased because it was a bad movie, for a bad movie night.  Do not take the 5 star review as an endorsement of this movie.  You will be sorely disappointed.  However, the movie was shipped promptly and played perfectly on my buddy's DVD player.",1388793600,,282,4.365384615384615
8218912,2,B000VIPXMQ,"These are two cheaply made and poorly directed movies with nothing original about them. David Carradine is an actor whom I usually enjoy watching. Unfortunately, he is at his worst here. Nevertheless, he is so much better than everyone and everything around him that he carries the production enough to bring it up to my two star rating.",1370995200,,337,4.827586206896552
8218913,3,B000VIPXMQ,"Future Force features David Carradine as a high-achieving bounty-hunter policemen who becomes unknowingly involved in a police corruption plan to eliminate a newswoman who supposedly has information against the new police commander Jason Adams.  The sexiness of Anna Rapagna and Dawn Wildsmith is displayed well, and there is energetic and effective vocal rock music as well as some pulsing techno sounds.  The barren industrial streets are perfect and attractive for the action-driving scenes.  Carradine deviates from the formula hero by avoiding the killing of the pursuing policemen (who don't know they're being wrongly used by commander Adams) when he can and by stepping out of the way so the policemen can blast Adams at the end.  Because of budget limitations, Future Force cannot be more than what it is, which is a good David Carradine movie, but I would much rather watch this movie than typical television police shows.",1259539200,,932,5.23489932885906
8218914,3,B000VIPXMQ,"I enjoyed this movie.
It's far from a classic,
but it had a lot of action,
a pretty good plot,
stereotypical characters
acted just about right,
and, importantly,
did not take itself too
seriously, but just seriously
enough.
David Carradine realized his
character just about perfectly.

The story in a nutshell:
Police function has been
privatized and there is a
motley crew ""association""
of bounty hunters,
C.O.P.S., that compete with
each other for the payoff.
The association is rather odd
as it's pretty much every man
for himself,
but probably necessary as a
front for legitimacy.

Tucker (Carradine) is the best
of them, partly due to his
secret computer genius partner
who is also his adopted child
due to an unfortunate accident
that left him paralyzed as a
result of being mistakenly
shot by Tucker when he was six.
Tucker is a gun-slinging urban
cowboy guy who cruises around
in a Jeep Cherokee apprehending
fugitives from justice who
have been sentenced by the courts.
Surrender or die(usually) is
the choice the fugitives have as their
Miranda rights have been reduced
to ""You have the right to die
if you choose"".

C.O.P.S. is one rowdy bunch
of guys and gals.
They spend their leisure time
at the DMZ, a stripper bar
so named because they don't
kill each other there.

There are lots of chases that
cover the underbelly of the city
(appears to be L.A.);
underneath the freeway, alleys,
junkyards, etc.
There are lots of western style
shoot-outs.
Tucker has a high-tech clamp-on
hand weapon that is so ridiculous
it provides great camp.

There are badder than bad guys
who kill gleefully for personal
wealth and power,
shifting alliances and betrayals,
a rocket-propelled-grenade wielding
clergyman, and a 70's/80's West Coast
pop-culture sensibility.

Enjoy this one. I did.
Enough to desire
to check out the sequel.",1254873600,,1829,4.980327868852459

8218916,1,B000VIPXMQ,"I knew Carradine was having trouble getting parts, but after watching this mess I think he really needs to give it up. The only future thing in this movie is a robotic glove that is a lot more trouble than it's worth, Carradine puts it on a few times throughout the movie to shot a lazar at the bad guys, oh so thrilling, snore...
The funniest thing was the emblem he wore on his jacket from his kung fu series, the man is living in a dream world if he thinks fans of that show will over look the crappy acting, fighting, script, and story line he needs help.
Final note; this is one of two movies he made, (Future Zone and Future Force) both are basically the same movie and he plays the same character. Run away from this film as fast as you can...",1242172800,,750,4.1438356164383565
8218917,1,B000VIPXMQ,"""Future Force"" qualifies as a cheesy, predictable, low-budget action crime saga that delivers no surprises and looks more like a modern-day, urban western rather than a futuristic tale about justice in Los Angeles.  ""Kill Bill"" star David Carradine served as the associate producer so there is mystery as to why he appears in this tongue-in-cheek thriller, but the wonderful Robert Tessier of ""The Longest Yard"" provides the film with a few moments of fun.  ""Future Force"" contains a modicum of nudity, and strippers chiefly furnish those fleeting moments in a bar named the DMZ where unsavory gun-totting civilian cops hang out between jobs.  The special effects are really awful, with superimposed blue lines that spread like a spider web over whatever and laser beams that are straight blue lights.  The biggest thing in his thriller occurs when a guy fires a LAWS rocket at a police helicopter and it vanishes in an explosion.  The dialogue is forgettable, but ""Jungle Assault"" director David A. Prior keeps the mindless mayhem moving fast enough and shows a few interesting camera movements so ""Future Force"" doesn't stall out.

The action unfolds with some lengthy exposition that sets up the world of ""Future Force.""  According to the narrator: ""In the year 1991, crime in America was out of control.  Prisons were overloaded.  Police forces were understaffed.  Gun battles in city streets became common place.  No one was safe.  The cities had become the battlefields of the future and the criminals were winning the war.  The public demanded change and the government responded.  Police departments across the country were shut down, and law enforcement was handed over to private enterprise.  Civilian Operated Police Systems, Incorporated., took over.  Within two years crime was under control.  The price, however, was a heavy one.  For justice as we once knew it had ceased to exist.""

Former L.A.P.D. officer John Tucker (a paunchy David Carradine) is one of the best in the business.  He has acquired a bad reputation for not bringing in any prisoners alive.  The Miranda-style statement that he utters to each lawbreaker is amusing.  ""You've committed a crime.  You're presumed guilty until proven innocent.  You have the right to die.  You choose to relinquish that right you'll be placed under arrest and put in prison.""  In his first encounter of many with a suspect, Tucker guns him down old West style in a fast draw showdown.  The two other creeps that were with the suspect attack Tucker.  He punches one in the balls and uses the club that they attacked him with to smash the other guy's face.  When these two try to escape, Tucker wields a huge bionic glove that he wears over his hand and forearm to stop them from fleeing the scene in their car.  The power of the bionic glove is so enormous that Tucker can plant it onto the roof of the car and hold the car in place when the driver floors the accelerator and the tires spin.  When Tucker releases the car to check his computer in his Cherokee Chief truck, the felons try to run him down and Tucker uses the laser built into his bionic glove to flip the car.  When he learns from his computer whiz go-between that the two guys in the wrecked car were guilty only of parking tickets, Tucker shrugs and observes that they are going to be charged probably with another parking violation.

Tucker has an onboard computer in his truck and the computer nerd who keeps him posted with updates about new criminals sits in a wheelchair.  Tucker accidentally shot him when Billy (D.C. Douglas) was a six-year old and Tucker and his partner responded to a crime call at the kid's residence. Meanwhile, Jason Adams (William Zipp of ""Operation Warzone"") is the Chief Executive Officer in Charge and he doesn't have a qualm about killing people.  The first time that we see him he has a rival tied up in a junk car.  The rival begs Adams to let him go, but Adams sends him off to a car crushing machine to do a ""Goldfinger"" number on the guy.  Becker (Robert Tessier of ""The Longest Yard"") serves as Adams' chief of security and he accompanies Adams anywhere.  Adams is as corrupt as they come.  He tries to get fifty percent of a mobster's action, but the mobster, Grimes (Patrick Culliton of ""Armed Response""), refuses to pay him.  Eventually, the greedy Adams finds himself in a predicament when the Channel 3 News anchor girl, Marion Sims (Anna Rapagna of ""The A-Team""), promises her viewers that she will feature an expose on Adams that concerns his illegal activities.  An angry Adams has Becker put out an arrest warrant on Sims, but Billy intercepts it and channels it to Tucker and Tucker picks her up and tries to bring her in.  Adams sends out other men to get the anchorwoman and Tucker guns down them.  Adams has a warrant issued for Tucker and our hero finds himself on the run, too.

The best scene in ""Future Force"" involves Tucker's use of the bionic glove.  Just as Becker is about to polish him off with a bullet, Tucker produces the remote control unit for the glove that he has refused to use and activates it.  The hatch of his Cherokee Chief flies up, the mechanical snap locks on the case snap open, and the glove flies through the air and clamps onto Becker's neck.

The far-fetched screenplay by creator Thomas Baldwin and co-scenarist Prior is not without holes.  After Adams calls criminal boss Grimes in for a conference and demands a 50 percent cut, we don't see Grimes again until he shoots down a helicopter menacing our heroes.  The irony about Sims is that she only reads the news copy. Everything about this thriller is strictly routine, though Prior does handle some scenes with a minimum of flair. Mind you, it isn't good enough to be bad, just bad enough to be pathetic.  A far better sequel ""Future Zone"" ensued in 1990 with Carradine and Culliton reprising their respective roles, but Gail Jenson replaced Anna Rapagna as Tucker's love interest.",1236988800,,5949,4.7560975609756095
