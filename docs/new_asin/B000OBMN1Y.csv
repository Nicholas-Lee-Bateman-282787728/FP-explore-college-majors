2793096,5,B000OBMN1Y,"I have enjoyed having my children participate in Angel Bear Yoga!  My children participated in the video and classes before it.  They had a wonderful time and learned a lot!

The video is well done!  I think other parents, especially those with small children, will enjoy the chance to share physical fitness and values in the Angel Bear adventures!

As an Early Childhood Specialist, I see obvious benefits of the program, which include the opportunity to be physically active, gain balance and self control, improve communication skills and  social skills and to provide an opportunity to discuss values, beliefs and attitudes.",1183939200,11,629,5.178217821782178
8184184,1,B000OBMN1Y,There's nothing in this product that is useful for kids to learn yoga. The poses are too easy. Not worth the money.,1370649600,,115,4.2727272727272725
8184185,1,B000OBMN1Y,"LISTEN WELL:
It is difficult enough to motivate children to speak properly;  I will NEVER show my child a video that includes such poor grammar as ""Do you listen GOOD, like Sweet Pea?""",1261785600,3,184,4.575757575757576
8184186,5,B000OBMN1Y,"My sons likes this video however it is a bit slow going for him. He is very active and he sometimes loses interest. He prefers the Giam Yoga dvd, Silly to Calm. We do like this one though.",1255305600,,188,3.973684210526316
8184187,5,B000OBMN1Y,"When I first started watching this DVD, I was immediately disappointed. We have some Yoga Kids DVDs, and the Angel Bear Yoga DVD just didn't seem to compare. My biggest complaint was the treacle-sweet way that Christi Eley was speaking to the children in the class- I can't stand baby talk to preschoolers. I continued watching and participating, though.

And then.

I noticed that my boys (3 and 5) seemed entranced. They actually participated in all the poses, followed directions and answered questions that Christi Eley directed at the children. I was a bit astounded- it's usually VERY difficult to get them to participate in directed physical activities, whether it be a video, a game, or group class. It took many viewings of the Yoga Kids DVDs before I could coax them off the couch, and even now (despite the fact that they like the DVDs and request them by name) they aren't that interested in DOING the Yoga Kids yoga. But with Angel Bear Yoga, they were completely immersed and active with only my example to go by. I am SO pleased. The themes of listening and courage are a nice bonus in my book.

So, I recommend this DVD highly. It might not appeal to my adult sensibilities as much as a well-produced, fun and active Yoga Kids DVD. But I'm not looking for a DVD that impresses me- I am looking for a DVD that engages my children and gets them to enjoy practicing yoga. Angel Bear Yoga fits the bill for us.",1224201600,4,1422,4.546875
8184188,2,B000OBMN1Y,"First, I'd like to say that the Angel Bear and Sweet Pea characters are adorable and brilliant. But they are the cover art and flashed on a couple cards during the dvd, otherwise they are completely unrelated to this dvd.

If it had been an animated yoga adventure with Angel Bear and Sweet Pea, this would have been a home run. Its just Christi Eley in a plain classroom which seems to serve to feature their Angel Bear products yoga mats and eye pillows more than anything else. It is Christi Eley yoga, not Angel Bear.

The Companion Book that you can buy separately is better than the dvd because it is actually Angel Bear, but it is an over priced hard copy version of a coloring book and contains no instruction.

If you're looking for children's yoga, Gaiam's Yoga Kids series is much better. Excellent actually. I highly recommend it.

As for this dvd, I probably wouldn't have been so disappointed if they had marketed this as being what it is (a cheap production of a well intended,  amateur instructor in a classroom) instead of the image of Angel Bear which is imagined and implied, but non-existent.

To the makers: ANIMATED Angel Bear Yoga would be a home run and make this worth the money.",1210204800,25,1204,4.550925925925926
8184189,2,B000OBMN1Y,"Based on others' reviews, & the whole build up of the program?- I was expecting something more.  Maybe the problem was that- expectations.  Very sweet, perhaps just felt a bit too contrived?  Maybe your little one will enjoy, the messages are positive, just didn't click for us & my expectations.",1203206400,3,296,4.88
8184190,5,B000OBMN1Y,This is  agreat video if you have any interest in  making raw foods a part or the total food of your diet.  It give a lot to information about the benefits of eating raw and has links for further info.  It is a great all around info for raw foods.,1203033600,,247,3.88
8184191,3,B000OBMN1Y,This moves a little slow for my daughter.  The Yogakids videos seem to hold her attention better.,1202428800,2,97,4.705882352941177
8184192,5,B000OBMN1Y,"I'm please to see that this product is truly designed to the way children learn.  This is a delightful way to introduce young children to basic yoga.  For Moms and Dads that study yoga, this is a great way to help introduce yoga to your children in a age appropriate way that is designed specifically to the way your child learns.  Too often, especially when we have studied something for a very long time, and it has been many years since we were a child ourselves, we forget the best way to learn (and teach) the basics.  Thanks to the author for reminding us of how to think like a child.",1194393600,6,591,4.297297297297297
8184193,5,B000OBMN1Y,"What a wonderful way to present basic yoga principles to children.  My kids were engaged, entertained and captivated by Christi.  It's been so much fun watching them learn the poses, and it really allows us to have some great time together.  I can see that Christi has spent a lot of time developing the concept.",1193875200,6,312,4.636363636363637
