6141175,5,B00H8KC1N4,"So glad this top-notch series has made it to DVD (at last!). This is a great cast with most of the 1967 Andy Griffith Show performers returning (Aunt Bee, Clara, Goober, Howard, Emmett and Millie- the latter was a late entry on TAGS),  The muti-talented, dancer/ actor Ken Berry is at the helm as Town Councilman/ farmer Sam Jones. I honestly don't think any other actor could have done so well stepping into this beloved series; Berry is warm, humorous and affectionate with his son, Mike (Buddy Foster), Aunt Bee (Francis Bavier), & love interest Millie (Arlene Golonka). I love the character Howard Sprague, as he continues in his TAGS role as the socially repressed county clerk. And of course, there is Goober and Emmett. Good-hearted Goober has the mentality of a 12 year old, and fix-it man Emmett repairs everything by slaming or jarring it. Episode one has Andy's wedding. Griffith himself said he had trouble ""keeping it together"", when guest star Don Knotts plays fumbling best man Barney Fife.  All in all-four to five stars!!!",1392595200,26,1039,4.864406779661017
6141176,5,B00H8KC1N4,"I remember Mayberry RFD when it first came out.  It was a great show back then but was cancelled when CBS executives decided to cancel all of their countrified TV shows.  These were wiped clean off the CBS airwaves pretty much all at once.  They were the Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, Green Acres, and Mayberry RFD.  Even though these shows were high in the ratings, CBS wanted a more modern variety of shows.

Mayberry RFD has an easy down home theme where everybody is helpful in this small town, and everyone usually works in harmony with everyone else.  In this show, controversy is kept very low key, if any at all.  With the offerings of the Hollywood today, and the TV industry, Mayberry RFD is a welcome look into the past of a gentle, quality TV show of days gone by.  This is a very easy to watch show that would not be offensive to any group.  Your grandmother, children and or grandchildren, and your pastor could easily watch it without wondering if the next line is going to be regretful.

Its a quality family show in every respect and well worth buying.",1388275200,39,1080,4.549222797927461
6141177,5,B00H8KC1N4,"The last time I saw this aired was 2001 on a TVLand weekend marathon. Before that it was 1988, and of course before
that was 1971 in prime time. For those of us too young to remember Andy Griffith in prime time, this spin off was my
first visit to mayberry back in '68 when I was 6. I love this show! Especally Arlene Golonka who appeared as Howards
girlfriend in the last sesaon of Andy Griffith. They had originally tried to use an unfamiliar cast for this series, but the
folks at CBS said we want the same cast as the Griffith show, only Andy will serve as producer. I think the shows are
great, it's almost like 3 more years of The Andy Griffith Show.",1386979200,69,656,4.173228346456693

6141180,5,B00H8KC1N4,"I have always been very fond of this series and I'm so glad it's coming to DVD. After watching episodes that I recorded off of TV LAND (that had about 6 minutes edited out for extra commercials) I'll finally be able to watch the full episodes. This series stated in the top 20 all three years but was canceled when CBS decided to do away with all rural programming. I especially liked Paul Hartmans as Emmitt Clark and Jack Dodsons as Hoeard Sprague. I always felt that the writers didn't know what to do with George Lindsey though, In many episodes, Goobers dialog is minimal and is mainly phrases like ""yeah, that's a good idea"" and other meaningless lines.",1386720000,53,659,4.546218487394958

I probably saw it as a child but didn't remember so I was anxious to watch it here. Episode centers more around Aunt Bee and her new digs than the wedding. Barney is Best Man and winds up on honeymoon (?) and several things stand out as weird, like when Opie asks who is walking Helen down the aisle. Of course it's her father, you would think the families would have met before the actual ceremony. Overall though it's not a terrible series for those who want more Mayberry.",1419638400,4,637,4.5

The show wasn't as hilarious as The Andy Griffith Show, but that wasn't nearly as hilarious after Don Knotts (and Jack Burns) left either. TAGS was still very funny though, and unfortunately I can't say that Mayberry RFD was even as funny as that. It was ""pleasant"", amusing, and wholesome, so I enjoyed watching it.

6141258,4,B00H8KC1N4,"When ""The Andy Griffith Show"" went off the air, most of us weren't ready to accept a world without Mayberry.  Fortunately the network at that time recognized that fact and provided a replacement.  It wasn't the same, but it was nice to say goodbye to an institution at our own pace.

In truth Andy Griffith hadn't been the same since Barney left and the show went to color.  When I compare the last episodes of Andy to the first episodes of Mayberry RFD, I was surprised to find that the Mayberry episodes were better.  The characters were fresher, the story lines were more believable, and the show acquired new energy.

This isn't the glory days of Mayberry.  But for the die hard Mayberry fan, this series is a nice addition.  The production level is good on this set.  Most importantly, it's nice to see Mayberry stories that haven't been re-run so often you can recite every line.  No, it's not ""The Andy Griffith Show"", but it sure is nice to travel the streets of Mayberry as a newcomer one last time.",1414713600,4,1008,4.519337016574585

I would have liked it more with most of the character of Aunt Bee left out.  Her acting, character and high squeaky voice got on my nerves something awful.  But after I saw the first Mayberry R.F.D. program I just couldn't stand her.  First of all, her voice was even squeaker, and 2nd, the characters and story lines were silly and ridiculous. Aunt B  comes to work for a family (father and son) just as she did on the Andy show, except the Mayberry son was terrible.  Nothing like the son, Opie, on Andy's show.  Opie was a darn good little actor.  The son on Mayberry was awful.  He had no acting ability at all, and had a squeaky voice just like Aunt Bee.  The stories on Mayberry were silly and boring,  and held no interest for me.  First of all Aunt B comes to work for this family and the next thing you know she's running the whole house and the people in it.  Well, that's all I have to say.

He and Emmett, Howard, and Goober are the core of the show, a close-knit circle of friends.  Millie, who once thought she would marry Howard, is now Sam's girl.

6141265,5,B00H8KC1N4,"First, let me say that I love ""The Andy Griffith Show.""  Although I'm a fan of the B&W episodes, the final three, color seasons resonate stronger with me.  The introduction of color (as well as the themes - i.e. Opie's rock group) firmly places these episodes in the mid-60s.  When the show ""became"" Mayberry RFD, the same feeling continued (i.e. when Howard gets ""hip"" during his trip to New York with Emmett) and seeing characters sporting sideburns reinforces it even moreso.

The transfers of these episodes look as good as, if not better, than they ever did on TNT or TV Land.  Please add this set to your TAGS collection and please, Warners, issue the remaining seasons quickly.",1408752000,12,684,4.762711864406779

I'm probably in the minority here, but I actually enjoyed Mayberry RFD Season 1 every bit as much as the original Andy Griffith Show, and I totally loved that series.  I hadn't seen Mayberry RFD for years, and forgot how heart-warming and funny this ""sequel"" series was.  The video quality is very good, as is the sound (for the era).  The only thing I didn't like was that lack of availability for Seasons 2 and 3 - now that this whet my appetite!

Simply to boost the ratings for RFD. It's a OK series but not worth buying unless really cheap. The 2 mins of so just to see Opie who isn't even at the wedding!! What the...!!?? Barney is made to look so stupid at the end it really is sad & not funny. He's on Andy's & Helen's honeymoon with them!! GROAN! It's OK if you love Ken Berry!,1404432000,3,482,3.9285714285714284

CBS was right to cancel this mess in 1971. I cant even believe that they would even release it on DVD as well.",1403568000,,487,4.362637362637362

Sheldon Leonard is no longer with the show and I think this has a lot to do with what seems to be less attention to the subtle details. But, it still is a nice show to watch and I enjoyed watching the episodes even if I did not quite get the laughs I did with Andy Griffith. This was an escape of sorts in its time - America was falling apart at the seams but this show latched on to family, honesty, church, and all-around good things. And in this day and age it is a throwback-escape even more so!  I will probably get Season 2 when it is available.",1403481600,5,629,4.032

Great collection of Mayberry television.",1397520000,8,308,4.735849056603773
6141294,5,B00H8KC1N4,"Even though I grew up watching ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" my local stations didn't carry ""Mayberry R.F.D.,"" so I really didn't know much about it until this DVD set.  I read some reviews, and even though not all were positive, I still knew it was something I needed to have as a dedicated fan of Andy Griffith.  Now that I've watched it, I couldn't be happier with it.  For one, Andy shows up far more than I expected from what I'd read about the show.  While he's not the focus of the episodes he's in, he turns up in just about every other show, often in several scenes.  His frequent presence makes for a very easy transition into this spin-off.  Along with Andy, all of the characters from the final season of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" appear, most as regulars, including Aunt Bee, Goober, Clara Edwards, Howard Sprague, Emmett, Millie Swanson, and of course Sam Jones and his son Mike, who are now the main characters.  Helen Crump, Opie, and even Barney Fife show up in the first episode, ""Andy and Helen Get Married.""  For this occasion alone, most longime fans will want to have this set.  Besides all these characters, many other familiar faces are here, from occasional characters like Reverend Tucker, Arnold, and Cyrus to many extras who appeared repeatedly on ""The Andy Griffith Show.""  I also like what this show does with several other child actors, who make the show fun in the way some of the early ""Andy"" episodes were when Ron Howard was a little boy.

I think a lot of these episodes are funnier than many color episodes of ""Andy,"" while others have a less comedic tone.  ""Mayberry R.F.D."" sometimes has a lighthearted family drama sort of tone rather than being a silly comedy all of the time.  That seems to cause some to criticize the show for its lack of punchlines, but I like the charm of presenting simple, downhome stories that don't always need to portray some goofball situation, like Aunt Bee wearing a wig to impress a visiting reverend, or Andy eating three spaghetti dinners in one evening.  I don't know if this show went downhill in the next seasons, but I've been watching ""Season 1"" nonstop since I got it.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes ""The Andy Griffith Show"" enough to appreciate even the color episodes.  ""Mayberry R.F.D."" has a very familiar feel.",1397174400,64,2301,4.630541871921182
6141295,5,B00H8KC1N4,"If you are a fan of The Andy Griffith Show, especially the last 3 seasons that were in color then you will love Mayberry RFD. The show is just like Andy Griffith but instead of Sheriff Taylor and Opie you get Sam Jones and his son Mike along with Aunt Bee, Goober, Howard, and Emmett. Now don't get me wrong as I am a big fan of The Andy Griffith Show but right now I seem to be favoring Mayberry RFD better - it's like getting to see all new shows instead of the same old Andy Griffith episodes over and over and over again, year after year. It's very refreshing to see new adventures in Mayberry - try this show out I don't think you will be disappointed. Hopefully we will get seasons 2 and 3 if enough people support this set.",1397174400,5,730,4.111888111888112

This show is low key for the most part. I hope they release the other two seasons.

Ok Buddy foster is no Ronny Howard-and he doesn't try to be. He is completely different and that's OK. Ken Berry is no Andy Griffith either-and doesn't try to be. Aunt Bee is still you know well-Aunt Bee. Goober, Emmett & Howard are hold overs from TAGS. I miss Don Knotts and Howard McNear-who played the town barber during the early seasons of TAGS and had to leave the show due to poor health. He eventually passed on shortly after wards.

6141298,3,B00H8KC1N4,"Mayberry RFD is essentially a watered down version of the Andy Griffith Show, created as a direct result of the sponsor's desire to continue that program when their star decided to call it quits.  The multi-talented Ken Berry is miscast here as Sam Jones - another widower with a young son and a housekeeper.  I remember wanting to like this show when it first came out, but I quickly realized I was only watching it to get my Mayberry ""fix"".  None of the episodes are especially memorable and in fact the show was mostly disregarded when the Mayberry reunion movie came out years later.  It's not that it is a bad show (it isn't) but honestly the only reason it exists is because it came with a built in audience.
