I will say the violence was injected into the movie with as much taste as manageable when dealing with rape scenes, etc. Inspired by true events, women are being murdered in Juarez after they leave the factory where they work. A fearful community is suddenly given some hope when one of the young victims not only lives, but experiences 'stigmata' after seeing the Virgin Mary.  I was shocked to learn that murders in Juarez are still happening and many are unsolved. I believe this director brought a very important story to the surface. Though it's never pleasant to think about young women being murdered, this movie depicts a harsh reality of the high cost of exploited-cheap labor.

8138981,2,B000HDZJWO,"The Virgin of Jurez (Kevin James Dobson, 2006)

It kind of seems like a can't-miss proposition, doesn't it? Put together a big Hollywood movie about a journalist traveling to Jurez, Mexico, to cover a story about a possible serial killer there who's racking up more bodies than Henry Lee Lucas. (This is, by the way, a true story; between 1993 and 2012, the body count is up to 370, per Wikipedia, and ...female homicides per capita in Jurez is significantly higher than any other major city in Mexico or the United States.) Throw in an apathetic government, cops who may be covering for the killer(s), and some random drug and gang activity.  (This is still a true story, by the way, we haven't started with the Hollywood embellishment yet.) Now throw in a roster of Hollywood B-listers and Mexican stars who have never gotten their due in America, seize on an unconfirmed rumor regarding one of the killer's (killers'?) survivors and kind of do a double-backflip-reverse on it in the name of drama, and you have The Virgin of Jureza movie that could have, and likely should have, been far, far better than it is.

The journalist in question is Karina Danes (Return to Me's Minnie Driver). She gets ahold of the story that there seems to be a serial killer down Mexico way, and goes down to see what she can dig up. What she finds is Mariela (El Crimen del Padre Amaro's Ana Claudia Talancn), one of the very few women to escape, and who claims to have had a vision of the Virgin Mary. Some of the locals are now considering Mariela an incarnation of the Virgin, and have set up a shrine to her. Mariela's brother Felix (Scandal's Guillermo Daz), a local gangster, has his boys running security at the shrine, but are their motivations purely religious? And is it possible the local constabulary actually know the person (or people) committing the murders, but covering it up?

It's a complex enough story in real life that it might have been a good idea to focus on one or two aspects of it and make everything else background color. Scriptwriter Michael Fallon (The Mask) decided to try going the opposite way, making it more complex without stripping out any of the underpinnings. A laudable goal to set for yourself...if you have the time to make an eight- or nine-hour film that can tackle all this complexity and add in the odd magical-realist spiritual angle. (For the record, from what I can discern from reading about three dozen articles about all this on the internet, one of the survivors did have visions of the Virgin Mary and considers the Virgin to have personally intervened in her fate, but I have seen no indication that said survivor is now worshipped as an icon in Jurez.) As it stands, though, Fallon tried to do too much in too little time. Dobson (Outriders), normally a TV director, might not have noticed anything amiss; after all, he's used to directing series, which have a much greater span of time to work these things out, and I've often commented on the difficulty of the transition between TV and feature directing. I'm not going to pin any (or much) of the blame on Dobson here, who had a pretty light touch with the camera, and I'm certainly not going to pin any of it on the cast; Driver didn't have quite the sparkle here of her best roles, but she brought at least her A- game. Talancn works as well as she can given that her role is more archetype than actual human being. Esai Morales? Who even knew he still had that kind of role in him? They all deserved a better script to work with. **",1399075200,,3530,4.563091482649842

8138984,3,B000HDZJWO,"Informationally, this SHOWTIME original is essential viewing for enlightening audiences on the dangerous plight of women migrant workers from Los Angeles who are routinely and mysteriously murdered on the border between Juarez, Mexico and El Paso, Texas. Since 1993, hundreds of woman have turned up dead and mutilated and no one seems to either care or have an answer. The fear and death continue.

Director Kevin Dobson has brought us Michael Fallon's screenplay THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ to the screen as a fanciful/possible solution to what may be happening down in Juarez. Though this is but a film, the information about the unsolved murders and the religious fanaticism in the area is crucial.

Suggested companion film would be AGNES OF GOD.",1188345600,2,744,5.140495867768595
8138985,3,B000HDZJWO,"Synopsis: On the daily trek from Juarez, Mexico to El Paso, Texas an ever increasing number of female workers are found raped and murdered in the surrounding desert. Investigative reporter Karina Danes (Minnie Driver) arrives from Los Angeles to pursue the story and angers both the local police and the factory owners who employee the undocumented aliens with her pointed questions and relentless quest for the truth.

Her story goes nationwide when a young girl named Mariela (Ana Claudia Talancon) survives a vicious attack and walks out of the desert crediting the Blessed Virgin for her rescue. Her story is further enhanced when the ""Wounds of Christ"" (stigmata) appear in her palms. She also claims to have received a message of hope for the Virgin Mary and soon a fanatical movement forms around her to fight against the evil that holds such a stranglehold on the area.

Critique: Possessing a lifelong fascination with such esoteric matters as Catholic mysticism, miracles and the mysterious appearance of the stigmata, I was immediately attracted to the '05 DVD release `Virgin of Juarez'. The film offers a rather unique storyline blending current socio-political concerns, the constant flow of Mexican migrant workers back and forth across the U.S./Mexican border and the traditional Catholic beliefs of the Hispanic population. I must say I was quite surprised by the unexpected route taken by the plot and the means and methods by which the heavenly message unfolds.

`Virgin of Juarez' is not a film that you would care to watch over and over again, but it was interesting enough to merit at least one viewing. Minnie Driver delivers a solid performance and Ana Claudia Talancon is perfect as the fragile and innocent visionary Mariela. Also starring Esai Morales and Angus Macfadyen (Braveheart).",1182729600,7,1812,5.156462585034014
8138986,3,B000HDZJWO,"THE VIRGIN OF JUAREZ is based on true events surrounding the crime problems of Juarez, Mexico reflected in the gringo exploitation of businesses in neighboring El Paso, Texas.  The story contains many important facts that desperately need to be brought into the light, but the impact of the film falters because of the choices made by the writer and director.

Karina Danes (Minnie Driver) is a journalist for a Los Angeles newspaper who has flown to Juarez to investigate the multiple (in the hundreds) killings of young women. The targets for these murders seem to be young women working in the US sponsored sweatshops in Juarez who are picked up at night after work, raped, beaten and killed.  Danes is convinced the Juarez police force is doing nothing and takes on the mission of exposing the tragedies, in part due to her own past issues of being too idle with similar crimes in the US.  She meets Father Herrera (Esai Morales) and a community activist Patrick (Angus MacFadyen) and together they probe the police files and follow the most recent murder, discovering along the way a survivor named Mariela (Ana Claudia Talancn), a frightened young girl whose memory of her rape and beating is erased by her apparent vision of the Virgin Mary.  A father of one of the victims, Isidro (Jorge Cervera, Jr.) nurtures Mariela and helps her to escape the hospital, placing her in a 'church' where she becomes a 'saint' to the people of Juarez who long for the crimes to end.  Mariela appears to the public with the stigmata of bleeding hands and offers hope to the victims' families.  Danes works hard to discover evidence that will expose the perpetrators, taking a sheet of photos of 'most wanted men' from the police office of Detective Lauro (Jacob Vargas), and works with the police and Father Herrera to resolve the tragic chain of events that continue in Juarez. Fearing for Mariela's life, they transport her to Los Angeles where mysterious events end the story.

The squeaky, mawkish script was written by Michael Fallon and directed by Kevin James Dobson.  Had their vision been more directed toward defining the line between realism and fanaticism, the story would possibly have been better related.  There are some good performances by Driver, Talancn, Morales, and Vargas but the minor roles vary in quality.  Reporting atrocities such as the one this film addresses is a valid and valuable contribution of contemporary cinema.  It is sad when script and the production dull the impact.
