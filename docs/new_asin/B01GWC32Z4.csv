8764181,4,B01GWC32Z4,"Very dated slapstick comedy, with touching scenes and remarks about wartime (1943, WWII) restrictions.  Definitely a blast-from-the-past, nostalgia for us old folks and a history lesson for those born after 1940.  Some genuinely funny scenes, plus actors very popular at the time.  I do need help answering this question, however: who sings for Pola Negri?  IMdb lists Negri herself doing the singing, but Wagnerites will notice that there is no scooping in the Hoy-ya-to-hos!  IMdb biographies say nothing about her vocal training.",1512777600,,532,5.439024390243903
