5103436,4,B007PMTDU4,"This was a really great, fun workout!  I wasn't dying as much as the Booty Barre videos which I absolutely love, so I think this is a perfect video for the slightly lighter days.  Even though it's a tad lighter, I will definitely be feeling it tomorrow.  I LOVE Tracey Mallett",1364169600,,276,4.372549019607843
5103437,5,B007PMTDU4,"This DVD is so much fun! You will definitely feel the burn the next day. You will do what SEEMS like easy small muscle work and ballet type moves...but those little moves will have you sore the next day! The instructor is simply the best! She is always on cue, telling you what to do, and her energy is just so positive. I'd buy any DVD that she makes.",1363737600,4,352,4.115942028985507
5103438,5,B007PMTDU4,"While Tracey's ""Booty Barre"" series are my favorites of her collection, this  DVD has  been a regular in my weekly workout routine, on days in between the Booty Barre workouts. Tracey is a tremendous  instructor, she is by far my favorite instructor out of all my workout DVD's (and I have dozens!). The workouts are short (35 minutes), fun, and effective. This is a great DVD as you get workout 1, a  dance inspired cardio routine, and workout 2, a floor barre/mat routine. You can do them separately or together for a higher intensity workout.  I highly recommend this product!",1362096000,3,579,4.75
5103439,5,B007PMTDU4,"Tracey's high energy workout is so much fun and really gets your heart rate up. I was sore for days after! If you have problems with squatting and lunges without your knees hurting, make sure you do the modifications. You will still get a great workout. There are two different workouts, so if you don't have time to do both, don't feel guilty as it's still a challenge. The second workout for Pilates and flexibility is a really intense ab workout. It's hard!!! Enjoy!",1356220800,,469,4.595238095238095
5103440,3,B007PMTDU4,"I liked this dvd, but I don't think it will end up in regular rotation for me.  I liked that the dvd is broken up into two parts so you can do a shorter workout or the whole video, however, there is no stretch after the first part or warm up before the second part, so you have to do that on your own if you plan to split it.  I worked up a little sweat doing the cardio portion, but I would say it was much more toning than cardio.

There were a few things I didn't like.  First, a few of the exercise sequences didn't flow well, they just felt a little awkward.  Maybe I will get used to them after doing the dvd a few times, but I didn't feel very graceful doing some of the moves.  Second, it was too quad/hip flexor focused for me.  Too much quad work seems to bulk up my legs, so I at least like a balance between quad and hamstring/glute work, but this felt very quad focused to me.  I think I personally would bulk up a little in the quads if I did this workout too regularly.  I had a little sorenss in my hip flexors and obliques the next day, but not in my bum.",1346025600,12,1072,3.903225806451613
5103441,5,B007PMTDU4,Love this workout...love love love...I have all the Booty Barres and this is a nice addition. No barre or chair needed. I do this inbetween my regular Booty Barre workouts. Easy to follow and fun. Highly recommend.,1338508800,6,214,4.8108108108108105

I just got done doing this one for the first time, and really enjoyed it! The entire workout is done barefoot, and you don't need any weights, just need a yoga mat for the second section.

Part 1 is 25 minutes long, and it is a low-impact cardio workout that really fries the legs.  It's a nice low-intermediate-level workout.  I know that a lot of folks found the cardio portion of BB Total Body to be too intense for them, and the cardio in this section is much easier than it is in BB Total Body.  For this first section, I wished that the cueing was a bit better; there were several series of exercises where you were working from a downdog-type position, and so I couldn't see my TV.  The lack of in-depth cueing made it hard to figure out what to do, and I had to keep looking up to watch.

Part 2 is 35 minutes long, and is a floor barre workout that focuses on the abs, booty, and legs.  The earlier part of this portion was really unique!  It wasn't traditional barre floorwork, but rather moves that replicated some of what you do at the barre.  (I'm having a hard time describing it, but, to give you a sample exercise, she had you do leg lifts in first position while stretching your legs forward.)  After that initial section, Tracey moved into some work on all fours, which I've always found to be really effective for my rear end and legs.  She doesn't endlessly rep you here (if you're familiar with Tracey Anderson's workouts or the Tonique On the Mat workout, it's not like those, but rather more like Brazil Butt Lift's High and Tight workout), but includes enough reps to make you feel the burn.

Overall, this is a solid workout; I didn't find it to be as fun as the two other Booty Barre workouts I have, but it was still enjoyable and I know I'll reach for it quite often. Tracey is always a delight to work out with; her positive energy makes for a good workout that leaves you pleasantly tired afterwards.

Since I wasn't sure how to combine these two new workouts, I asked Tracey on her Facebook page, and she said that it would be good to alternate them every other day with her other Booty Barre workouts.

If you're looking for other barefoot workouts, Ellen Barrett also makes some really good ones, and she, like Tracey, is a super sweet, encouraging instructor.",1338336000,17,3185,5.404040404040404
5103443,5,B007PMTDU4,"Fantastic stuff...I teach Pilates & barre, including Booty Barre.  This dvd has perfect sequencing, perfect balance, and perfect strength.  The variations surprise the muscles.  So excited to use some of this with my clients.  Oh and one more thing...easy to stay focused. Tracey keeps you moving throughout!",1338163200,5,308,5.48936170212766
5103444,5,B007PMTDU4,"What a fun, energizing workout!  I love Tracey and I do her BOOTY BARRE DVDs (Total Body and BB Plus) a couple of times a week.  I think this is a great workout to prepare you for Barre workouts.  The time flies by and before you know it, the hour is up.  The first half is a dance based workout.  She explains things clearly and goes over the steps with you so no worries if you have no dance experience.  The second workout is a floor barre routine.  So, basically moves that you would do at a ballet barre, but instead, on the floor.  This adds a different type of challenge vs if you were standing up.  So, think Pilates on the floor.  The second workout encompasses the whole body while the first workout is mostly cardio and legs/abs.  Give this DVD a shot, you won't regret it!",1337558400,23,784,4.22972972972973
5103445,5,B007PMTDU4,"Tracey Mallett never ceases to amaze me. Again, her FuseDance Cardio Lean gives us busy moms another great way to get in shape AND have fun. Let's face it, we love to dance (especially when no one's watching), so what better way to trim down, too? Thanks to Tracey, we have 2 more great ways to do just that!",1337126400,5,308,4.237288135593221

8520551,5,B007PMTDU4,I own all of Tracey Booty DVDs & love them all. This is a nice addition and different than the others. The standing cardio is not high impact but good and love to be bare footed.

( etc...like lifting bodyweight into bridges or planks) no nothing like that just great fun and it gives you an advanced model so you can build up and grow with this dvd...so if you love to dance/pilates/yoga like workouts this is for you...,1393200000,,766,4.557971014492754
