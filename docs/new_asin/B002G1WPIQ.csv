3924498,5,B002G1WPIQ,"Our two year old daughter recently discovered The Wiggles (Going Bananas and You Make Me Feel Like Dancing being her favorites), so when I saw this was being released I pre-ordered without even knowing what it was.  Well, here's what it is: a concert taping of The Wiggles performing in Sydney.  Needless to say, our daughter loved it.  The songs, the dancing, and she also got quite a kick out of watching the kids dancing in the audience.

I think the performance goes on a little long, and I think the camerawork could have been improved.  But heck, I enjoyed it too.  The songs from The Wiggles are simple, catchy, and easy to remember.  That means I can sing and dance along with my little girl, and a good time is had by all.  It was fun to see the parents in the audience singing along as well.  Well done, Wiggles...well done!",1254528000,15,834,4.434210526315789
3924509,4,B002G1WPIQ,"Or he has a different sense of fun than the other Wiggles. The more I watch him the more I sense he was treating it as a job and deep down inside there's a part of him that was perhaps bored with it all. He was originally hired to be a dancer/pirate/what ever, stood out with his lovely operatic voice he doesn't use enough, and became Greg's understudy about the time his health problems got worse. He might have got the permanent roll because he knew the songs and could fit the shirt. Sam's chemistry never fully gelled with the others. (and to prove it's Sam watch later tours with Ringo the Ringmaster and how quickly he fits in) The other Wiggles, Captain Feathersword, and some of the dancers look like no matter how many times they sing Rock A Bye Your Bear this is still the best job ever.

The bulk of the songs come from Getting Strong/Pop Goes/Sing A Song/You Make Me Feel Like Dancing with a few classics. Sam gives a good if not uneven performance, he could have done the Shimmy Shake which Ive always felt as his song as well as he does Six Months In A Leaky Boat. It's nice to see him do some trumpet playing too. Yes this is a big big show, there are a heck of a lot of people on stage at times and you can only find the Wiggles by the color of their skivvies. Old Dan Tucker is fun to watch and looks like fun to do. There are lots of costume changes for Wiggles and dancers, nursery rhymes are mixed with songs, and all in all this show holds up to rewatching a bit more than some of the others.",1365033600,,1514,4.149659863945578
3924510,5,B002G1WPIQ,"My little Wiggles fan loves this video.  We attended a live Wiggles concert several months ago, so this video is especially fun for him now.",1351036800,,140,4.6
3924511,5,B002G1WPIQ,"As befits the circus theme, there's a heavy emphasis on acrobatics and dancing at this live show. The pace rarely slacks, with hardly a pause between numbers--you could get tired just watching them! You get to see how far Anthony has progressed in his fitness regime, holding his own with the acrobats and wiggly dancers.

The songs are a thoughtful mix of Greg-era favorites and Wiggle&Learn-era songs. The Wiggles are usually up front dancing and singing to pre-recorded tracks, occasionally adding live guitar, keyboard, or drums. The only time the whole band plays live onstage is during Dorothy's ballet solo (with Sam on trumpet and Murray on bass guitar).

I wondered if the lack of variety in settings or the interspersed distant shots would lose our toddler's interest, but she doesn't seem to mind at all.

Overall, an engaging, well-produced recent live show.",1329091200,,870,5.06993006993007
3924512,5,B002G1WPIQ,My 1.5 year old nephew loves The Wiggles.  He dances to all the songs. I knew this would be a good holiday gift.,1327017600,2,112,3.869565217391304
3924513,5,B002G1WPIQ,"This live concert DVD is longer than most and really holds his attention.  He sings and dances along to these 25 songs.  Their stage is pretty elaborate and colorful, the acrobats and dancers do a good job. It's cute to see some of the children in the audience dance to the songs too.  The Wiggles all come to the stage in the big red car that makes an appearance on stage which is cool.  It's nice to see them on stage instead of just a studio setting.  They do many of their classics - big red car, quack, quack, rock a bye your bear, getting strong, shimmie shake, hot potato, monkey man and Dr. Knickerbocker.  We get so much enjoyment out of watching our son sing and dance.",1322179200,,679,4.265625
3924514,4,B002G1WPIQ,"My daughter is a Wiggle junkie.  This is a good DVD, but she seems to enjoy watching the early Wiggles videos more than the Live performance DVD.",1296518400,,145,4.37037037037037
3924515,5,B002G1WPIQ,"A new concert movie that has Greg's replacement in it, but I love it for Murray's sake.  I had to choose Murray as the next favorite wiggle in line since Greg left.

One of my favorite parts in this movie is seeing Jeff and Anthony taking turns pretending to be 4 different animals.  I also like learning a few new songs that I've never heard of, before.

One of them is called ""Monkey Man"", I think it's from The Wiggles Go Bananas.",1296518400,,433,4.2439024390243905
3924516,5,B002G1WPIQ,"We got this for my son for Christmas.  We actually first borrowed it from our local library.  After seeing how much he loved it (and watching him learn to do a somersault!), we had to go out and buy it.  It's entertaining for adults too!",1291075200,,237,4.222222222222222
3924517,5,B002G1WPIQ,"Having a two year old, this DVD was my introduction to the Wiggles.  I was a bit apprehensive in buying a concert DVD of the Wiggles at first, thinking that my son would be more interested in one of their other DVDs that are based on their show, but I am thrilled with the purchase as he loves this DVD.  The great thing this DVD is that it is not the mind-numbing shows where adults just zone out.  The songs are catchy, and many of them will be known to adults, either because they are traditional songs (Old Dan Tucker) or older pop song (Six Months In A Leaky Boat).  I give this DVD the highest recommendation possible.",1272672000,2,624,4.262711864406779
3924518,4,B002G1WPIQ,"I have two children, a 7 and almost 2 year-old and it is amazing the affection they both hold for the Wiggles in their respective toddlerhoods. It's like ""baby crack"" as my husband calls them.  My baby's earliest phrase was, ""watch Wiggles"".  With my oldest, friends gave us vintage Wiggles videos and although the Big Red car was made of cardboard, they had absolutely no sets just a couple of props, and had to rely on their respective schticks to fill segments, they still had a captivating appeal on my daughter, then a toddler.  Now we're watching the Big Big show and other new videos and their production values have come a looong way.

What I have noticed since Greg's departure from the group is Anthony's increasing role as front man.  My kids would never notice it, but he's a bit of a limelight hog and his incessant chatter gets grating, at least after many, many viewings.  I even noticed on one bonus track (maybe not this video's?) that all of Anthony's bloopers were full sound on the reel, but the rest of the casts bloopers were done in montage with a soundtrack over the dialogue even though some of them looked funnier than Anthony's bloopers.  I hope he mellows out.  The other guys still seem to be as sweet-spirited as ever.

But that's the worst I can say about them.  The show is entertaining for adults and the songs are pretty contemporary and appealing to kids and parents.  They stand up to multiple viewings before Anthony's behaviour becomes apparent and starts to wear.  And the rest of the cast is charming and fun.  And of course, they're baby crack.",1272585600,7,1585,4.617857142857143
3924529,5,B002G1WPIQ,My 2 year old LOVES this video.  He would watch it all day if I let him.  He loves wiggles and this one is fun.  It's a video of a live concert.  Lots of dancing and of course singing.  If you want to go to a live concert and can't then this is the video for you.,1271635200,2,263,3.543859649122807
3924530,5,B002G1WPIQ,"When we first got this DVD, my 3-yr-old watched it everyday. She loved it...and so did I. It's a recording of one of their performances in Sydney. I had purchased an older performance DVD that my daughter didn't like, so I was pleased that she likes this one so much.

There are lots of the Wiggles tunes we are all familiar with. The stage is set up like a human circus. There is a lot of dancing, tumbling, and acrobatics, by both the Wiggles and the Wiggly Dancers. It's nice to see the group as they are interacting with an audience.

This is the same performance given as the one during their last U.S. tour, ""Wiggles Go Bananas!""",1270944000,,635,4.372881355932203
3924531,5,B002G1WPIQ,"We are wiggles fans and own many of their dvd's and have attended the live show(It's great BTW). This dvd is great, my three boys and I all enjoyed it. My hubby says I love the wiggles as much as my kids:) It's full of old favorites and some of the newer songs as well. Lots of wiggle dancers and captain feather sword, along with all the others. Only thing I did not like was the camera that seemed miles away from the stage. There were to many scenes with that camera to me. Anthony is still in terrific shape and does a great job, Sams singing is as good as ever and of course Jeff is still falling asleep, and Murry is still playing his guitar. If you like the wiggles this will be a wonderful addition, if this is your first dvd of the wiggles then it's a good place to start:}",1268092800,,782,4.084415584415584
3924532,4,B002G1WPIQ,"Nice show with acrobats and some of the regular dancers.  It is nice to see an entire ""concert"" video with Sam.  Fun circus theme.",1266105600,7,130,4.375
3924533,5,B002G1WPIQ,My 5 year old loves this. She has watched it many times. It reminds her of the concert she went to and now she keeps asking when she can go again.,1265846400,2,146,3.7419354838709675
3924534,5,B002G1WPIQ,I just bought this for my 16 month old son and he has requested it numerous times all ready.  It's a fun show with catchy tunes.  I'm sure this will be one of his favorites.,1265068800,3,173,3.914285714285714
3924535,5,B002G1WPIQ,"If we're in the van and our two-year old gets a little road weary, we can pop this in and his mood greatly improves. We use it sparingly to keep the fun from wearing off, so this should last us for 6 months or so.",1264809600,2,213,3.7555555555555555
3924536,4,B002G1WPIQ,"If you have never seen the Wiggles before, this is a great show. Nice songs, cool acrobatics, fun.

If you have seen a lot of them, skip this. Murray looks tired. Sam seems to have squabbled with Anthony backstage and keeps as far away as he can. And, worse, Anthony takes every opportunity to do a split or handstand, even when there's really no call for it in the music. It's OK, we get it, you are in good shape even though you are in your late 40s.

It's a good show, though, just not my favorite.

Sam's voice is amazing. And Jeff seems to have blossomed since Greg's departure. His singing is better than ever and he appears relaxed and happy performing.",1262390400,4,660,4.349593495934959
3924537,5,B002G1WPIQ,When I purchased this DVD I did not know that it was a live show. My husband and I were pleasantly suprise when we started to watch. My son knew all the songs and sang along with the Wiggles. We all watch this DVD over and over for weeks after we received it. This is a must have DVD for your little one who is a Wiggles fan.,1257897600,3,325,3.7941176470588234
3924538,5,B002G1WPIQ,"Another hit with our 3-year old (almost 4) daughter. It reminds me of the concert they did here in the US, only with a MUCH bigger stage and longer show. A real must-have for Wiggles Fans!",1255651200,9,188,4.25

8369615,2,B002G1WPIQ,"Synopsis:When Murray, a shy young Australian, is left alone for a few days in the Sydney flat he shares with Greg, Anthony, and Sam Wiggles, he begins to withdraw into a reclusive existence where innocuous everyday realitiesare distorted by deep-seated anxieties. On screen throughout the film, Murray gives a wondrously subtle performance as the increasingly catatonic Wiggle but equally expressive of his terrifying inner torment are the sometimes surreal but never over-emphatic visual and aural effects created by director Roman Polanski to accompany his wanderings around the empty apartment or the bustling streets of Sydney.",1424822400,,631,5.652631578947369
8369616,5,B002G1WPIQ,"My 2 and 1 year old kids love this! They've learned a lot, including songs, new words, dances, numbers, and have become interested in acrobatics (lucky me!). It's enjoyable for my husband and me too. We sing along and enjoy this kids' DVD the best out of everything we have. We've become Wiggles fans!! Next, we plan to get a CD for car rides.",1419379200,,343,4.375

8369618,5,B002G1WPIQ,"These Wiggles guys are just too corny for words, but I can see why kids love them. They NEVER stop smiling, and their tunes end up dancing in my head, too. I wondered what the big deal was with the Wiggles, but now I actually enjoy watching this video over and over again with my grandkids.",1388188800,,290,4.196428571428571
8369619,5,B002G1WPIQ,This is by far the best thing the Wiggles have put out yet.  This is the third copy of this DVD we've purchased...my kids literally wore out the first two discs.  But beware-you'll be humming the addictive little tunes to yourself in no time.  So entertaining for the entire family!!!,1386979200,,284,4.64
8369620,5,B002G1WPIQ,Live Wiggles shows are very entertaining! And sadly this original cast have retired. The earlier shows are the absolute BEST!,1382572800,,125,5.3
8369621,5,B002G1WPIQ,"Originally simulcast in theaters all over Australia, the Wiggles' Big Big Show is really fun.  This is one of the most energetic live performances I've ever seen.  The Wiggles and the Wiggly dancers go through dozens of costume changes, sing and dance their hearts out and never stop moving.  As the camera pans the live audience, it's obvious that the children aren't the only ones having a great time.  At our house, we've watched it again and again.  Our little guy gets up and dances all through it.  You and your family will find yourselves bursting out singing ""Here Comes the Bear"", ""Old Dan Tucker"", and ""Follow the Leader"" even when it's not playing.",1381536000,,659,4.7368421052631575
