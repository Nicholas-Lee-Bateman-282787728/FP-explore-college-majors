8362727,4,B002C0SIKU,"""Salem Witch Trials"" is the more interesting of the two, a TV Mini-Series with surprisingly fine performances from Kirstie Allie, Shirley MacLaine and others. A gritty account of an ugly smudge of American History. At over 3 hours, it was interesting at all times, thanks to sensible direction from Joseph Sergeant.

""The Final Patient"" is an interesting low-budget mystery that holds your attention. Directed and co-written by Jerry Minardi, it tells a story that is interesting, often compelling.

At a good price, I'm glad to have these in my collection.",1400976000,,557,5.177777777777778
