8541817,5,B009IF121O,"Another awful production by Davide Livermore--tthe less it is said of the staging and costumes the better --is saved by four of the most beautiful Rossini voices I've heard in a long time, and the masterful conducting by Corrado Dovaris.  If you cannot bear to watch, just listen to it.  It is glorious!",1439683200,,303,4.69811320754717
8541818,5,B009IF121O,"This is a simple plot, composed by Rossini in his early teens, and I agree with the lead reviewer that the music smacks of late Mozart in abundance.
The plot about paternal love and filial piety may sound a bit `old-fashioned', so the director Livermore devised some gimmicks, that almost tripped the performance over but for the outstanding conductor Rovaris and four superb young soloists who deserves the highest accolade.
The sets have nothing to do with Syria or Persia, though the two title roles were meant to be the rulers of those two kingdoms according to the plot.  The staging is in Rossini's period, and if the audience concentrate on the period-costumed figures on stage, you would not go wrong, even though there are `foils' of the four singers and lots of mirrors that sometimes work, and sometimes don't.
As the Persian ruler, the young Italian basso Mirco Palazzi has a beautiful voice, and performs outstandingly despite his very youthful look.  Another very young singer Victoria Zaytseva sang the trousered role of Siveno, the `son' of both kings. The vocal demands are not really great, but what amazes is her beauty of tone and fully alive performance. Soprano Maria Jos Moreno as Publio's daughter Lisinga had to tackle the fiendishly demanding vocal role, and by and large, especially in the outer Act, her singing is simply spectacular. It is in the final Act and Scene that there are a couple of tight top notes, but still pitch perfect.
The tenor role of Demetrio is the focal point of the entire opera. Here, young Chinese tenor Shi Yijie (or Yijie Shi) tackles the role with full vocal assurance and dramatic conviction. While Shi's voice may not suit the full lyrical repertoire such as Verdi, Puccini et al, in Rossini and Mozart he has already proved himself to be a very competent interpretor.
It is heartening to see such wonderful young talents emerging in the operatic scene as the `quartet' in this early Rossinian opera revival.",1382832000,,1967,4.86865671641791
8541819,5,B009IF121O,"... but if I'd heard this opera in Roma in May of 1812, I'd have gone home raving about the miraculous birth of the fully-formed Gioachino Rossini from the head of Mozart. And if I'd heard bits of it in the home of the librettist Vincenzina Mombelli and her family, for whom Rossini tailor-composed the four roles of Demetrio, Polibio, Siveno, and Lisinga, I'd have sold my palazzo and invested my scudi in the future career of the teenage genius. Domenico Mombelli, the pater familias and a well-established operatic tenor, certainly recognized the precocious genius of the 13-year-old Gioachino; he must have sung the role of Demetrio in the preliminary performances of the opera in various small theaters before its successful premier in Roma. That juicy role is sung in this production by Yijie Shi, another youthful prodigy, born in China, trained in Japan and Europe, a skyrocketing star in Rossini productions. I had always supposed that such a ""squillo"" was genetically restricted to Italian tenors - :-) - but Yijie Shi has it all. Mombelli's older of two daughters must have had fine Bel Canto technique; the role of Lisinga, composed for her, is extremely demanding. In this production, seasoned coloratura Maria Jos Moreno pulls it off beautifully but not without some strain on her highest passages. The younger daughter could not yet have been so well developed as an alto; consequently the role of Siveno is far less demanding, a ""piece of torta"" for Victoria Yaytseva. Mombelli went so far as to adopt a basso, to enable the family to sing quartets. The basso role - Polibio, King of Parthia and adoptive father of Siveno - is sung artfully in this staging by Mirco Palazzi. Thus the libretto and the opera must have resonated personally, hermeneutically, for the Mombellis and their proteg.

True, the libretto is lame. It might not have seemed quite so lame to opera-goers at the end of the Baroque era; after all, it's not much lamer than the libretti of the great Metastasio. Everyone but the librettists must have understood that the plot and the words were only a scaffolding for the music, for Bel Canto. The boy Gioachino transcended his libretto as gloriously as any Baroque composer from Vivaldi to Mozart. If Rossini had died at age 19, the rediscovery of this opera would have astounded the musical world. The music is very good! Rich in musical invention! Already 100% Rossini!

This production, from the 2010 Rossini Festival in Pesaro, redeems the flimsy libretto both by its musical excellence and by its effectively whimsical staging. The four principals are costumed in baroque finery but the ""set"" is the backstage, behind the curtain, of an opera house. One can suppose that the singers are the ghostly avatars of opera sung in the past. Stage hands and fire marshals wander through the action without perceiving the singers. This is ""Regietheater"" -- Director's Theater -- that succeeds in enlivening a weak narrative without disrespecting the themes of the opera or the affect of the music.

Here I've given Demetrio e Polibio FIVE big fat stars while other insightful reviewers have given only four, but Bel Canto so generously composed and so wittily performed cannot fail to entertain.",1358380800,6,3226,4.959334565619224
8541820,2,B009IF121O,PRODUCTION IS VERY STRANGE.  DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH THE CHARACTERS.  COSTUMES ARE NOT IN THE PERIOD PORTRAYED IN THE STORY.  SINGING IS VERY GOOD HOWEVER.  THUS ONLY 2 STARS,1357603200,2,175,5.142857142857143
8541821,4,B009IF121O,"I was surprised that I liked this obscure, early Rossini. The entire cast and support throws itself into the work. Certainly, in spite of few familiar names, the singing is superb.
Most often we read complaints when the ""set"" design seems truncated, too simple. This one is curious, for it seems to begin
only after a 'regular opera', and everything is packed up and ...lights off..turned off by a ""fire marshall, who smokes cigarettes""...which gives us a clue that there is going to be a lot of fire hazard. Indeed... the players all seem to have soem kind of device in the palm of their hand and with a flick of the thumb, blazes up quite frightfully. Later, as part of the script, the palace is invaded by the enemy bent on recapturing this lost son. There are lots of guys with torches, the red lights waver, and the red curtain wavers to produce the imagery of a great fire...with ""first responders coming out in their
usual gear with refelctive tape on their firemen gear, and hose it all down, and ""extinguish the fire"".
I think you get it...an empty stage taken over by ghosts of 'opera pasts', with lots of backstage boxes, back sides of flats, long rows of garments on racks (for other operas) as scene dividers. You wonder how it all works, but it does. The production doesn't take itself too seriously, in spite of the all out performances, and playing with fire, and back stage people all over the place! It actually helps ease the over the top intense love, fear, anguish, threat,murderous outrage,..pretty melodramatic stuff.
It is explained that Rosssini, very early in life, wrote this for a family of opera singers, most notably a famous tenor at the time, wife, daughters, and adopted son all taking the roles; and Rossini explaining he did this for a few ""Piastres"".
The Mombelli family, the father a celebrated tenor at the time both amused themselves , and too, Signor Mombelli provided his young daughters some real good experience...hence a kind of home movie aspect of the thing. The singers chosen do very well, especially the soprano Maria Jose Moreno and her romantic counterpart, the breeches role sung by mezzo Victoria Zaytseva. We all have our favorite tenors, mine happen to be a tenor getting up there in years, like Domingo, or even Alagna, both with a deeper resonance all the way to their top notes-a more mellow, and melifluous G and A. This is just personal, of course, and not meant to offend anyone..I think a tenor that probably reflected the elder Mombelli might have pleased me a bit more - albeit Yije Shi pulled off a flawless performance.
The ""time"" is about a King of Parthia, and a King of Syria...so Rossini's era costumery just added to my bewilderment a bit. The libretto is itself a bit convoluted...but in the end, we are mainly enjoying the music, aren't we? I'll keep this one. I also join the other reviewers, who noticed the superb job everyone did to make this happen. Congratulations to everyone involved. So...let's see some more obscure operas! I like it.",1357603200,7,3017,4.726755218216319
