For those not familiar with the series, its about historic farming.  If you don't get excited about the prospect of watching 30 hours worth of historians and archaeologists doing manual labor in various rural UK locations, look elsewhere.

The quality of the videos can be a bit uneven.  I've only watched the series off torrents and youtube so I'm not sure if this is a matter of the BBC dispatching three interns with an ancient VHS camcorder and a flask of tepid coffee to film some of the segments or if its the transfer.  Given that the setting is in particularly lovely parts of the countryside the switch between quality can be somewhat annoying.  The sound quality seems fairly even though.",1525046400,,971,4.451977401129944
