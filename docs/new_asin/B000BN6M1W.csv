8089210,5,B000BN6M1W,I took dance lessons for several years and along the way have bought several dance instruction dvds. This is the best yet.,1435968000,,122,4.590909090909091
8089211,4,B000BN6M1W,"Let me first say that we have LOTS of instructional dance DVD's in our library, including several of the Librero's.  These are some of the best.  Each DVD has fifteen different steps.  You will learn the basic steps, as well as some intermediate ones.  After pacticing with these DVD's you can definitely go out on the town and feel reasonably confident.

One thing I would recommend is that you buy the DVD for individual dances.  Like anything else, anything that attempts to serve too many functions (i.e. a DVD that attempts to teach you several different dances) will not be as good as something that specializes in just one function.  As someone mentioned on another review, if you buy the ""latin Dance"" DVD, you will get 3 steps from each dance.  Not very satisfying, as opposed to buying a DVD that is dedicated to one dance, where you get fifteen patterns.

The DVD is set up so that you can very easily go back and review without watching the whole DVD, or even chapter.  It will start with Emilio and Blanche dancing the step together to music.  Then Emilio will explain the men's part, followed by Blanche explaining the women's part.  Finally, they will dance it together with Emilio explaining speciall nuances.  Lastly, they will dance the pice together with music.  Production is very professional, although the set is quite dated.

My only complaint, and the reason I didn't give them five stars is that I believe they are more about teaching pattern than they are at teaching technique.  Some people may like that, but I think it is important to teach technique and musicality in addition to how to merely replicate a step.

Overall, this is a fine product, although they are a little pricey.  If you are a visual learner like me, DVD's are a better investment, as I can go back and review them, whereas I have probably forgotten most of what I have learned in most classes I have taken.  Overall I'd say they're worth it.",1285977600,2,1940,4.652941176470589
8089212,5,B000BN6M1W,"My husband and I had taken swing dance lessons many years ago but could not remember some of the steps other than the basics.  We purchased the How To Become a Good Dancer: East Coast Swing DVD to review basic steps and to add more advance steps.  We found the instructions clear, simple and easy to follow.  We are enjoying dancing together using the steps learned from this DVD.",1267920000,2,380,4.478260869565218
