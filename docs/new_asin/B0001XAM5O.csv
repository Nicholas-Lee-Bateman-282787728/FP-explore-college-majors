2041615,5,B0001XAM5O,It is a great partner with The Benny Goodman Story. Each highlights the other. I wasn't aware the Gene was responsible for making the drums a solo instrument.,1361145600,,158,4.678571428571429
2041616,5,B0001XAM5O,"For Krupa fans and collectors, this is a must have. Good quality video, and part of history of Jazz and music.",1359936000,,110,4.285714285714286
2041617,4,B0001XAM5O,"I found this DVD quite disappointing. Many of the clips featuring Gene with the Goodman Quartet and trio I have on other DVDs, but i guess there is only so much old footage to make up a one hour programme. That too I found disappointing, having just purchased what I thought was a Buddy Rich DVD from the same series which ran for 2 hours. But if you don't have any other material of Gene then this as good as any other. Unlike Buddy Rich however, Gene Krupa Did not improve as he got older and his age certainly is reflected in his playing in the later clips as illustrated in this DVD. Still one of the greatest however.",1311292800,,622,4.235294117647059
2041618,5,B0001XAM5O,We ordered this DVD to give to my son who is a drummer to show him one of the greatest drummers of all time.  The picture quality is good even though the material was recorded decades ago before the digital age.  My son enjoyed it very much.,1294099200,,241,4.1063829787234045
2041619,5,B0001XAM5O,"Gene Krupa was the first, I believe, to be a featured drummer in a big band arrangement.  He led the way for an enormous amount of talented  drummers to become famous. He was an extraordinary performer and was a pleasure to watch.",1228348800,9,230,4.4523809523809526
2041620,5,B0001XAM5O,"A person is usually recognized as an innovator if they dramatically change how something is done, or perceived.  Gene Krupa no doubt changed the role of the drummer, and how drums were played in the world of music in general and more specifically, the world of jazz.  Krupa's unique style, showmanship and dedication to his art transformed the role of the drummer from one of insignificance to solo status, the equal of any other instrumentalist in a band.  Gene Krupa, Jazz Legend, is an absolute must have for anyone interested in drumming, great music, or a well done biography of a true jazz giant.

The DVD contains many taped and filmed Krupa performances including a killer version of Sing, Sing, Sing from the 1937 movie, Hollywood Hotel.  Krupa's own big band is featured and highlights performances by Krupa, Roy Eldridge and Anita O'Day. Of particular interest were several taped reunion performances from the early 1970s featuring Krupa, Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton, Teddy Wilson and Buddy Rich.  These performances marked a period in Krupa's life when illness was taking a toll on his body, but was unable to conquer the man's heart, spirit, and love of his music.  Gene Krupa, Jazz Legend also offers additional performances, and a number of audio tracks.

Louis Bellson, a fine drummer in his own right, injects his own personal thoughts on Krupa, as friend, colleague and fellow artist.  Adding to the commentary is a fine interview with Krupa himself.  Gene noted his own thoughts on drumming, and the influences on his own style which included the contributions of Baby Dodds, and the incredible Chick Webb.

If I had to offer one criticism, it would be that the scope of Krupa's career and contributions probably warranted a slightly longer biographical examination; however this does not significantly detract from this overall fine presentation.

Gene Krupa was a true innovator, but more simply put, he was a man that loved music and performing.  He was a rare talent who transcended musical generations, and still has much to offer any lover of music.  Have a listen and a look.  You won't be disappointed.",1152921600,48,2131,4.980225988700565
8017619,3,B0001XAM5O,"Overall a nice tribute to Gene Krupa, but very poor sound quality.  Not enough drumming by him as a young man.",1490745600,,110,4.238095238095238

8017621,5,B0001XAM5O,Wonderful person and drummer.  I learned everything about drumming from Gene.,1463356800,,77,6.0
8017622,4,B0001XAM5O,"It is good, but like so many other DVDs, it reuses footage that has been used by other recent DVDs on the market. But that marketing ploy still cannot take away from how good Krupa really was. So it's still worthwhile to watch.",1434672000,,227,4.3023255813953485

8017624,4,B0001XAM5O,A legend indeed. Incredible video of the master.,1421884800,,48,5.125
8017625,4,B0001XAM5O,"This is an interesting book.  It doesn't have the weight of Peter Levinson or Ross Firestone, but gives a good accounting of Krupa's place in the pantheon jazz greats.  I would have liked to have had a little more on his personal life and his use of strings in the orchestra in late 1944-45.  That was a great sounding orchestra and that may have come along a little too late for the swing era.  It showed the brilliance of his drumming but his tremendous musicianship and class.",1408060800,,479,4.471264367816092
8017626,5,B0001XAM5O,"Wonderful look at a legend of the Big Band  era.  Filled with video clips which haven't been seen in years.  With personal interviews and historical clips, you really get the sense of the musician himself, what drove him, and his musical abilities.  Gene Krupa was a true legend of that musical era so many years ago...",1390003200,2,319,4.642857142857143
