It may be a bit dated know, since it was made 15 years ago, but that movie is still the Louisiana I grew up in - and believe me, that is how politics still works there.",1129507200,4,347,4.043478260869565
489192,2,6302637597,"James Spader (Tv's Boston Legal and The Practice, Stargate) stars as a lawyer running for congress. His father just died, he's divorced and he's being beat by his opponent in the campaign race. Spader has a steamy fling with Vietnamese chick Charlotte Lewis and he doesnt know that her blackmailing father videotaped them doing the deed but she comes to his house and so Spader with the girl go try to get the tapes back but Spader ends up getting knocked out and when he wakes up the girl is gone and the only thing is the dead father with a knife by his side. So, he scrams it fleeing the scene of the crime and the next thing you know the girl is put on trial and he takes the case. Spader keeps this to a 2 star rating with his performance. The supporting cast don't add up to their potential. The result is a mystery drama with little life and breath. You can see the end coming a mile away...well I did anyway. Also starring Jason Robards (Enemy Of The State, Magnolia), Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, Jeff Perry (Tv's Nash Bridges), Piper Laurie and Michael Parks (From Dusk Till Dawn, Kill Bill 1 and 2).",1110067200,5,1104,4.390243902439025
489193,3,6302637597,"I'm a huge fan of Spader but this was not one of his best.  Some parts of the plot was difficult to follow because it was boring and could not hold my attention despite Spader's hotness (haha).  The problem I have with this film is the use of the ""Vietnamese"" woman to carry out the plot.  Not only was it bad for the film, it gave Vietnamese viewers like me a bad taste in my mouth once the movie was over.  The woman did not look like she was Vietnamese and she was just a medium to add sex and violence into the film.  Plus, her fate was left untold after the trial.  There's nothing realistic about this movie and Spader's character is not very likable though he's suppose to play the good guy.  If you would like to see a good movie with Spader and the Vietnam situation, watch The Pentagon Papers.  He plays a real hero in that one and it's based on a true story.",1087948800,9,869,4.130952380952381
7828631,4,6302637597,"I remember them filming this in New Orleans and even met Spader who was really friendly. I haven't seen this in years. I just found it and
watching it again. I always thought the beginning was kinda slow but once the murder happens it really gets good and moves quickly.
I love the scenes of the city back then it was so much better and safer than now. I love the cutlass convertible he drives in the movie.
It has a great cast and all do a great job! I see Fats from the tv series Baretta is in the movie! and the great actor Steve Forrester plays
the judge but has very few lines in the movie which he should have had more. Jason Robards a great actor is always good too. This is
one of the many great sleeper movies from the 90's when Hollywood not Hollyweird could still make great movies. They don't anymore!",1489881600,,813,4.1847133757961785
7828632,5,6302637597,"This is a great movie!! Timeless and true depiction of the complexity of New Orleans and South Louisiana in terms of religion, race, and politics!! The characters are well drawn and the Past is never past!! James Spader is subtle and awesome!!",1425600000,2,243,4.809523809523809
7828633,4,6302637597,"This was one of my favorite James Spader movies of that period.  My two favorites were ""Storyville"" and ""Jack's Back"".  In this one Spader plays a young lawyer with a family of dubious background that is running as a heavy underdog for a Senator office.  With a pending divorce he gets pulled into a steamy one night stand that is secretly recorded and leads to murder.  Now he must solve the murder, defend the girl in court, do court battle with the former love of his life, run the election and solve the mystery of his family's fortune and the suicide of his father.  An even paced drama with a strong cast.  Enjoyable mystery.",1417478400,,631,4.491228070175438

7828635,5,6302637597,"I had this in video since the 1990's, but wore it out watching it, and that is why I ordered the DVD. I love James Spader in anything he plays in.  I mostly already have everything I order on line, but want to make sure I keep it.  I am not just guessing and hoping it will be good, I already know it is.",1399766400,3,304,3.734375
7828636,4,6302637597,"Great James Spader movie! He makes any movie more interesting and entertaining.  The mystery to it was very well done and of course, New Orleans is always it's own great character!",1395360000,,180,4.806451612903226
7828637,4,6302637597,"No. It is not Chinatown. Not even close, But this is a very entertaining movie that I have watched time and again. The cast is excellent, top to bottom and in my mind, it is James Spader's best performance.

It has its flaws. But I've already said, it does not approach the perfection of Chinatown. But, if you are in the mood for some intrigue with fine acting and wonderful music all woven together, watch this movie.",1359158400,,419,4.441558441558442
7828638,2,6302637597,"A feckless, charmless, and morally vacuous man, haunted by the suicide of his father, runs for congress in Louisiana. His opponent, far ahead in the polls, nonetheless arranges an erotic encounter (in an abandoned aikido studio!) to get our hero's adulterous moves on video. Yawn. Everything--lines, camera angles, plot points--proceeds in the most predictable and utterly uninteresting fashion. Who gives a damn about this dissipated and rather fatuous pretty boy? Frost and Spader fail to bring any life to this yarn. Even Robards, a real pro, is off his game. Skip this one.",1236902400,,577,5.21505376344086

7828640,3,6302637597,"It goes like this; James spader is a former lawyer running for political office. While at the same time looks into the suicide of his father years earlier. Has a dalliance with a vietnamese prostitute which is taped by her father, The prostitute ( Charlette Lewis ) arrives apparently beaten by her father tells Spader ( Cray Fowler ) that her father has secretly taped them. Spader seeks confrontation with father,they fight and father is killed. this is when discrepancies seem to mount up,first of all the father dies seemingly by a slit throat by a knife that Spader never brandishes during the fight. murder weapon left at scene of crime,which Spader takes possession of which is rather stupid considering he's a former lawyer. Trial follows with daughter as main suspect even through theirs no forensic evidence to link her to the crime just her running from the building. Implausible courtroom shootout as well as reactions by everyone involved. Your left with not knowing who actually killed the father. Why Spader is so stupid,and why is their no relationship building with any of the female cast. The movie is portrayed in the deep south Louisiana where you would think intamacy would be no problem. And the movie doesn't even get interesting until 40 minutes into the film. In short the movie tries to make up for its lack of substance with style,which it fails to do, you""ll barely entertained, Spaders done better this is just an average film.",1196899200,2,1456,4.875
