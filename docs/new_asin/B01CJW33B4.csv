7684322,4,B01CJW33B4,"To put it bluntly, ""Dazed and Confused"" isn't my thing. Never has been. Others may consider it a classic coming of age movie, but it doesn't ""speak"" to me and probably never will. Richard Linklater's other films have, however, with the director's single-minded focus on characters rather than plot, and his ability to bring us into whatever era he's waxing nostalgic about at the moment. Linklater loves to just chill with his characters, and he makes us want to chill with them, too. It's this strength that makes his '80s frat house comedy ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" so enjoyable in capturing the freedom and promise that comes with being young, athletic, and male.

As 'Dazed' was set at the tail end of high school, with future possibilities wide open, ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is set in the fall of 1980 days before the new school year begins. And yet the future is still wide open for Jake (Blake Jenner), a clean-cut star freshman pitcher arrived on campus at a fictional Texas university. Consider Jake like the Jason London of this particular story; he's our eyes and ears, the character who is to guide us through a flurry of frat boy hijinks and shenanigans. Jake lives in a frat alongside the other players on his baseball team, all on the constant quest for sex, the next party, and more sex. Not only are these guys preoccupied totally with getting laid, but so is the movie. Linklater is essentially making an '80s-style sex comedy, and romanticizing every last bit of it in the process.

While Jake is pretty much a blank slate, his crew is anything but. There's Finn (Glen Powell, Jr.), a mercurial lothario who doesn't mean tailoring his personality to score with hot chicks; the reliably cool Dale (Quinton Johnson), fiery team captain and Billy Crudup lookalike, McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), epic stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), and the team weirdo Jay Niles (Juston Street). These are just a few of the outsized personalities that populate Jake's insular world, and Linklater is content to just follow these guys around as they rag on one another about their baseball talent or lack thereof, their prowess with women or lack thereof, and not much else. There's very little examination of whom these guys are beyond their simplest, immediate desires for pleasure, indicative of the film's Van Halen-inspired title, and that actually works in its favor. The only time it doesn't quite feel authentic is the few occasions when Linklater tries to provide a glimpse of the wider world around them. That begins with Jake's casual courtship with Beverly (the always great Zoey Deutch), a performing arts major who provides a semblance of balance to his life. They bond over the mutual competitiveness of their chosen fields, but not much else. Fortunately, her arrival also sends the uncouth dudes into one heck of a party full of theater geeks.

Of course the period details are on point, and if you're a child of the '80s the soundtrack is going to be a must-purchase. Everything from the aforementioned Van Halen to Blondie to The Sugar Hill Gang is used to pinpoint perfection, along with a smattering of punk and disco. There are enough tight jeans and bad haircuts to remind audiences of all the bad choices they made years ago.

Does ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" stand up as an equal to ""Dazed and Confused""? It'll take some time for that to be properly assessed, but it's a film that lives up to its wildly emphatic title, so jump in and join the party!!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everybody-Wants-Some-Blu-ray/dp/B01CJW33B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everybody Wants Some [Blu-ray</a>]",1463788800,12,3653,5.083333333333333

7684325,3,B01CJW33B4,"This is a movie that had a lot of potential. But the next animal house or old school it is not. There were a few funny parts that made me slightly laugh and reminded me of my own college days. But it just wasn't riotously funny. And the love story just didn't get there because the two characters involved only had two days to fall in love and there scenes together lacked passion.

A part of this movie that I did really like was a conversation between a freshman and a more seasoned senior pitcher about how position players in baseball don't understand them. Yep, it's lonely out on that mound, and a lot of pitchers are quirky.

But still that said, this is just an o.k. flick.",1461801600,7,681,4.3125
7684326,4,B01CJW33B4,"""Everybody Wants Some!!"" (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of a group of baseball players on a Texas college team. As the movie opens, The Knack's ""My Sherona"" is blasting away in a guy's car. That turns out to be Jake, an incoming Freshman and pitcher. The big screen reminds us that it is ""August 28, 1980, Classes start in 3 days"". Jake is getting to know the rest of the Baseball House that he is sharing with seven other guys. When they decide to take a drive and try to pick up girls, one mystery girl informs them she likes the quiet guy in the back (pointing to Jake). At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from Texas writer-director Richard Linlater, who most recently brought us the brilliant ""Boyhood"" (which I had as my No. 1 movie of 2014) , and much earlier ""Dazed and Confused"" (set in high school in 1976). It is an easy case to make that ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is a spiritual sequel to that movie. The movie's trailer gave the impression that this is an all-out funny, possibly rowdy college-age coming-of-age, and there certainly is plenty of that. But there is so much more to this movie. I love how Linklater lets the scenes develop with uninterrupted shots that at times go on for minutes. Pay careful attention to what life was like in 1980 (no cell of smart phones, no craft beer, etc.). Linklater was 20 at that time (as was I), and he captures it perfectly. As was the case in ""Dazed and Confused"", this movie features an ensemble cast that surely contains future stars. I'm pretty sure those will include Brian Jenner (playing the Jake character, and previously best known for his recurring role on the TV show Glee) as well as Zoey Deutsch, in the role of Beverly, the mystery girl I referred to. Deutsch is the daughter of Lea Thompson and the physical resemblance is uncanny (and very easy on the eyes). Last but certainly not least, the film features dozens and dozens of killer tunes from that era, from ""My Sherona"" in the beginning to the Cars' ""Let the Good Times Roll"" over the end credits. The scenes in the Sound Machine disco tent are among the many highlights of the movie. Bottom line: I felt like this movie was literally made FOR ME, as I was those guys (setting aside the baseball aspects). ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" shows a group of people in their late teens/early twenties, optimistic as to what lies ahead in their lives. What a wonderful movie. (If you wonder where the line ""Frontiers are where you find them"" comes from, just watch the movie....)

The movie opened on a couple of screens in Greater Cincinnati, and having seen the trailer, I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at turned out t be a private screening, as in: I literally was the only person in the theater. Say what?? I couldn't believe it. I will go see any movie by Richard Linklater simply on the strength of his name and the blind faith in his talent. If you are in the mood for a nostalgic yet very realistic look  back at what life was like in late August of 1980, you cannot go wrong with this movie. ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1461283200,16,3305,4.48671096345515

There's the Waking Life obligatory pseudo-philosophy.  The first time I hated this picture and wanted to walk out (I love baseball).  The second time I was right there with the characters.  What to think of this hot mess of a picture.  A minor league effort and he'll never ever top Dazed.  Still, a puzzle you don't mothball.  Curious.  5 or 1 star, depending on the day.  I like it.

It wouldn't have mattered if the movie had been any good. I don't get all these reviews that just rave about it.

7684381,4,B01CJW33B4,"The cusp days of the lingering 70's & budding 80's, the year 1980. A lot of reviewers seemed under the impression this was either in the 70's or in the mid 80's, it's neither, but I like that & knew it going in.

When comparing it to Dazed & Confused, the primary difference is that this film focuses on one group, whereas Dazed followed multiple groups of friends that all converged at various points & culminated in a big group party at the end. So, if you don't like the guys in this movie, who are incidentally kindred to Ben Affleck's cronies in Dazed, you're stuck, no one else to fall back on & wait for. They do visit clubs/parties of different subgenres of that time, but no one from those environments are focused on, except the main freshman's/Jake's main romantic interest. Jake is kinda like Pink from Dazed.

A major failing for this movie was the P.R. by the cast, who did a terrible disservice to the films ""cool factor"". In featurettes & t.v./internet interviews the cast just goofs on the ""costumes"" hair, etc... They don't get behind it & act too cool, like their own era won't go out of style. Instead of it being hyped & promoted as retro/revival they killed it dead in the water as simply outdated/irrelevant. Only Linklater himself seemed to believe in the film. (Side note: Jay Leno once tried to embarass Tom Selick on the tonight show by showing a picture of him in his magnum outfit, an old promo shot. Tom didn't laugh, he said something like, ""what's wrong with it, that's what people wore."" Now, that's how it's done!

The actors gave invested performances in the film itself though. I did wonder though if I was just distracted by the nostalgia of the era depicted or if I'd still ant to watch these same dudes personalities hang out if it took place in the late 90's. The equivalent of disco being edm/house & instead of cotton eye Joe, some Shania Twain remixes & Korn instead of Van Halen while wearing baggy clothes devoid of color with short spikey hair. This is where I ask myself is it the script or the wardrobe, sets & soundtrack that I'm watching EWS for? I don't need an ""EPIC"" story arc, chilling is cool, but behind the fashion if the times, who am I hanging out with?",1494979200,6,2212,4.483870967741935

I love how Dazed & Confused had great characters with varied personalities, supremely quotable dialog, and a cast that genuinely seemed to gel and enjoy working together. Unfortunately, this movie is pretty much the opposite of that. The characters are flat and uninteresting. The dialog is forgettable, or downright cringe-worthy to listen to. None of the characters are even really likeable in any way. And although I love '80s music, even the soundtrack is terrible compared with D&C. I'm going to pretend this movie never happened, like Star Wars Episode I. Although even Jar Jar Binks is a better character than these clowns.",1494028800,2,724,4.991735537190083
7684387,2,B01CJW33B4,"A character-driven, period piece set in post-Vietnam, pre-Reagan youth-culture- so much room for past, present, and future. This should be ripe ground for Richard Linklater, one of the best American film-makers going. The whole film is prescribed as a sequel for 1993's ""Dazed and Confused"", and whether that is a description from within the Linklater camp, or some wistful outsiders is immaterial. As viewers we must accept this is a take specific to a time and place, a culture to which the film doesn't seem overly concerned with addressing. More than anything, ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is a film begging for details, yet is totally untroubled in providing.
What drives these guys? Other than a shallow scene involving knuckle-flicking we don't know because the film shows us very little in the way of back-story to establish these dudes. Our protagonist just rolls up in his muscle-car, without any backstory on the overarching desire to overcome and succeed, fresh to a house full of similarly bland overachievers. And when I refer to them as ""dudes"" and ""guys"", their interplay feels like a sausage-party in the worst way: female characters are so devoid of presence, both on the screen as well as internally, that they might as well be Asian cutaways in a Rambo flick: they are there, you see them, sometimes they say stuff, but ultimately, they don't matter.
An hour into the film we still have no reason as for why the dudes really even exist. Where does their shallow bravado extend from? Sure, sex is probably the primeval motivator. But besides getting drunk and smoking the occasional joint, what did the youth of that era gorge themselves upon? Anyone who lived through that time or has read anything on the ear knows that it starts with ""c"" and ends ""ocaine"". Was this referenced in dialogue or shown in the kinds of photography we would expect from Linklater- a filmmaker usually (and not without merit) ranked amongst the best going? No. The overindulgence of that time (circa 1980) is completely glossed over and our protagonists are largely portrayed as a little off-kilter, but only because they're overly competitive and kind of drunk most of the film. Cocaine on a big college campus circa 1980, the era of big white bell-bottom slacks and the like? According to ""Everybody Wants Some!!"", it's not worth a brief shot or mention or even a snip of dialogue.
Now, if nothing else, we should get some weighty photography; after all, ""Dazed and Confused"" was full of scenes written in bold, full-fledged 35 fluidity that commanded your attention to the costumes and scenes it capture. Not ""Everybody Wants Some!!""; this film, made in a time wherein the studios are increasingly prohibitive to anything other than franchises and squeals, seems to shrug its shoulders at the big-screen and instead, embrace lazy, flat lighting and shot-composition, qualities to which the Linklater of the early-90s were essential. Instead, now we get a ""feature"" film which would easily pass for Lifetime Channel-produced fair. Specifically, there are almost no shadows (literally or figuratively) to make these people interesting, there are few close-ups or slow-motion takes from which a filmmaker underlines what is crucial to the story: these are hallmarks of Linklater which, in their absence, make this whole thing feel like a rough draft, or worse yet, something his offspring would have presented.
Okay, some positives: a decent soundtrack; I say ""decent"" because after all the titular song is a (blistering) early Van Halen track- featured, but only in passing; the occasional funny line or scene (cool-whip licked from the thumb or the prank face-sitting); a few vintage cars, and mostly honest costuming, in the form of short denim shorts and loosely-buttoned shirts, being the film's only consistent strong-points.
Overall, this is hugely disappointing, not just from Linklater fans, but from pretty any viewer hoping or expecting this film to capture a specific experience in a particular era. The singular scene at which a ""Reagan 1980"" sign in passing completely overlook the oil-crises of the 1970s, to say nothing of the concurrent and unrattling Iran Hostage Crises which spawned ""Nightline"", as well 24 hour cable news in the form of CNN. None of this has any impact on our characters. Those things matter as much to them as what the school cafeteria had to offer on any given day. This is not something which lends dimension to them; rather it leaves them as 2D as a computer-generated logo of that day. Don't misconstrue this as a compliment.
Perhaps Linklater (born 1960)- a ""Generation Jones"" (the tale end of the Baby Boom) member himself- is simply overwhelmed with the prospect of confronting the milieu in which he came of age. Reflecting, and coming to terms with oneself, is one of the overarching challenges of the filmmaker. It certainly doesn't seem, upon viewing this feature, that he's ever read a book on the brief generation known as ""Generation Jones""  who were (besides including such luminaries as than Barack Obama) the tail end of the ""Baby Boom"" (and all of its realizations and expectations). Who knows, maybe this attempt hit the director at a point in his life where he wasn't willing or able to confront those ruminations concerning that epoch and left us with this empty lump of a film. Or, maybe (partially) in his defense, the movie-industry is so truly obsessed with profits and franchise productions that it won't take a chance on stories featuring protagonists that were so bewitched by the drug culture and otherwise debased to the root that they show us how we got to be this self-centered, and (quite possibly), irredeemable.
Or maybe this is just under-done by most counts, and should leave any observant film-viewer wanting more.",1494028800,,5785,5.032325338894682
7684388,5,B01CJW33B4,"The one star reviews are nearly all from people that have no clue what they are watching. ""Where's the story?"" The characters are the story. If you want a story, you won't like this movie. For all the people whose memory seems questionable, Dazed and Confused was also about the characters, and not the story. There was no deep meaning to Dazed, and there is no deep meaning here; it's just a few days in the life of a group of guys who happen to be baseball players, creating the bonds that most college kids make. It's entertaining, the actors are mainly very good, and the writing is pretty much spot on for the time frame.

If you go in with that understanding, you will be more than treated to insights of  what is was like to be one of the guys back in the day.
Rather than idealize everything- it shows the good the bad, the jealousy, in fighting  and the and bonding together of an imperfect group of guys ( who also happen to be a baseball team.)
Much quicker in pace then Dazed and Confused, and a good bit more realistic ""adult reality"", but no way gratuitous or over the top like American Pie or ""teen"" flicks.  The soundtrack like the dialogue was amazing, and on point, and surprisingly the highlights were not the obvious suspects you would suspect.  ....and therein lies the magic.
PS. To avoid sonic dissapointment, know that the movie is not set in  the mid 1980's as in Pretty in Pink, DEPECHE MODE, NEW WAVE etc...its more like very early 80's and these kids are musically non-denominational...wide genre of deeper cuts.",1491523200,,1201,4.610328638497653

And, like the other two, takes that feel and compliments it with a soundtrack that takes you the rest of the way.  Be you in an undefined psychedelic future, a nostalgic past or a meandering through mind and time, he does it.

1980 seems to distant and so innnocent now, and to those who may not have experienced it, it seems like a world unreal.  Those of us who did, we remember it through a pleasant haze of nostalgia brought on by time's forcible distancing us from our youth.  But we do remember it.

You could work for a year or two (or three or four) and give it a try.  Florida State had a 28 year old qb in 2000.

The wild parties weren't very wild as in Animal House, and repeat trips to the same nightclub didn't serve much purpose except to make an excuse to laugh at two music genres other than disco. Probably the biggest disappointment was thinking this was going to be Dazed & Confused: 1980. The girls were a lot better looking, but the acting couldn't match D&C.

In some ways this feels like a beginning or sophomoric effort of a cinephile filmmaker having similarities to Swingers or Chasing Amy more than it's most obvious comparison to Dazed and Confused (shout out to the Gillegan's Island reference scene with the punk band and mosh pit).

The characters in THIS (with the exception of the lead) are nothing but a bunch of obnoxious buffoons. Not only that, the facial hair and clothes are beyond dated; almost all of them have mustaches and sideburns.

The lead actor Blake Jenner, on the other hand, isn't half-bad. The same thing can be said for Zoey Deutch who plays his love-interest; both actors work off each other quite well.

Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0

Richard Linklater, who gave us the most ambitious Boyhood, years in the making, now has thrown together his latest, a slapdash concoction known as Everyone Wants Some!! While one may initially believe the title is about sex, it's actually based on a Van Halen song.

Everyone Wants Some!! is an ensemble piece focusing on a fictional 1980 college baseball team known as the Southeast Texas Cherokees. The protagonist is a freshman pitcher Jake (Blake Jenner), who moves in with most of his teammates in a rickety old house near the college campus.

Three quarters into the film, one is still waiting for the break into Act II. There is virtually no movement in the plot until Jake finally hooks up with a pretty performing arts sophomore, Beverly, and consummates a brief romance.

Sandwiched in between Jake's entrance and eventual fling, we follow the machinations of his teammatesthey're a bunch of foul-mouthed, beer- swilling cut ups who are supposed to be amusing but decidedly evoke no laughs. When not insulting one another, they're off attending one campus party after another, aggressively hitting on girls, usually with some success.

Since there are so many characters, it's hard to keep track of who's who. Of the ones I can recall, Willoughby is the philosopher-stoner who is eventually exposed as a thirty year old and expelled from campus. Finnegan boasts of his average penis size to various co-eds in the belief that his frankness will win him some points; and Jay, the ""star"" pitcher, is a loose cannon who provokes a fight at a bar with arrogant and racist remarks.

When Jake runs into his old high school pal, Justin, a punk aficionado, this gives Linklater an opportunity to showcase a punk music concert. But it's actually 80s pop-rock that fills up the majority of the tracks on the soundtrack.

Before the anemic climax, the baseball team shows up for a pre-spring practice (the players apparently are directed to get acquainted in the fall) and Jay, pitching aggressively, is finally shown up when McReynolds, the team captain, smacks a homer off of him.

If the unexciting proceedings on the baseball field don't interest you enough, there's a final party scene, a ""Wizard of Oz"" themed costume affair, where the boys warm up to their artsy female counterparts. This is where the romance between Jake and Beverly blossoms and is the only aspect of the film where a modicum of interest may pop up for the now disinterested viewer.

Throughout the film Linklater notes the time when classes begin. The denouement is completely anti-climactic and in keeping with Liniklater's desire to serve up another slice of lifeindeed, Jake (and one of his teammates) arrive at class and promptly fall asleep!

Everyone Wants Some!! proves to be lugubrious and virtually plot less. What's more its characters are for the most part, indistinguishable. Naturally the critics lapped this one up and prove once again that the critical establishment usually runs to those directors who would rather rest on their laurels then proffer up new and exciting material.",1482624000,,3137,4.990421455938697

7684497,1,B01CJW33B4,Terrible movie. So many critics stated this was basically the 1980s version of Dazed and Confused - don't believe the hype! Dazed and Confused is an excellent movie. This one is just a mess.,1482624000,3,190,4.617647058823529
7684498,5,B01CJW33B4,"I'll begin this review with a confession: I'm not a big fan of Dazed and Confused. It's not that I dislike the film, I'm just not that crazy about it. I've watched it three times, and no matter how much I try to like it, the movie just doesn't resonate with me. I point that out because it seems to me from a lot of the reviews I've read that if you're a Dazed and Confused fan, this movie may be a disappointment to you. So be it. As far as I am concerned, this is now my favorite Richard Linklater film, and I far prefer it to Dazed. The plot of the movie is pretty straightforward- it's the start of a new school year at a Texas university, and the players on the school's baseball team have returned to campus a few days before classes begin. There are a few new players as well, and all of them have some serious time to kill before they are expected to be responsible in any way. Co-ed comic mayhem ensues, with occasional verbal forays into the supposedly absurd nature of our existence.

What makes this movie so good? First off, it doesn't take itself too seriously. And let's be honest folks, sometimes Linklater fillms take themselves too seriously. I remember watching Before Sunrise and thinking, ""geez, these two are taking themselves way too seriously."" In fact, if Ethan Hawke is starring in a Linklater project, you can bet his character will be Taking Himself Very Seriously, and there will be some Very Deep Dialogue extrapolated from some philosophy textbook Linklater probably really liked when he got into existentialism and cannabis in college. Ethan Hawke is notably absent from this project, and perhaps as a result, the forced philosophy textbook dialogue is kept to a minimum (but don't get me wrong- it's there. When it's spoken by Finn, it usually works, when its spoken by Beverly and Jake...not so much), and for the most part, the dialogue captures the kind of too-clever-for-their-own-good snark you'd expect from a bunch of college athletes who think they rule the universe, but somehow still manage to be likeable.

Which brings me to the second thing I liked about this movie- the characters are incredibly well realized, and the actors are just about perfect for their roles. It's remarkable that Linklater is able to so fully flesh out the uniqueness of each player on the team, so that each actor is given a chance to really shine in his role. I say ""his"" because, with the exception of Beverly, the females in this movie largely exist as objects of pleasure for the players on the team. And the scenes involving Beverly and Jake that occur late in the film...well, just think of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy from the Before Trilogy, only younger and brighter-eyed than they are in the first film because they're naive little college freshmen, and you'll get the idea. Sometimes I get the feeling that Linklater is trying really really hard to convince himself through his own movies that his philosophic outlook is a wisely chosen one, and not just the one that worked best at getting him dates in college. I wish him the best. Whatever the case, Glenn Powell is excellent as Finn, the team's wise guru and mentor; and Juston Street is hilarious as Jay, the cocky senior tranfer pitcher. But again, every actor rises to the challenge of making his role on the team memorable and unique.

And then there's the music. The soundtrack is just outstanding. Better than Dazed. Better than Fast Times. Better than Adventureland. There are over 40 songs, some only heard very briefly, but you can tell they were carefully chosen. Listen closely and see if you can catch them all. The film's version of Rapper's Delight is just about perfect, and kudos for having John Stewart's Gold on the soundtrack. More importantly, music and the way people express their own identity through the music they prefer to listen to is an integral theme in the film. Pay particular attention to the conversations about music involving Willoughby and Jake or Jake and Finn (and yes, even Jake and Beverly) and you'll see what I mean.

Look, if you want another Linklater movie to talk about with all your existentialist friends next time you're at the coffeehouse, this is probably not going to satisfy your angst, or your ennui, or your weltschmerz, whatever the heck that is. But if you want a heartfelt, sentimental homage to a different time with a little more depth to it than, say, Wet Hot American Summer, then this is great choice. In the end, it just seems better than it deserves to be. Set your assumptions about what you think it ought to be aside, and give it a chance. Please. I implore you. This thing flopped at the box office, and it is a far cry from recouping the studio's investment. I would way rather see another movie about these guys in a few years than something with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy called Before Menopause or Before Incontinence, where two old people chatter on about the absurdity of life and the inevitability of death and the importance of love and...uhg. Doesn't Everybody Wants Some More sound like a way more interesting movie?",1482019200,3,5084,4.6834451901566

7684508,5,B01CJW33B4,"The negative reviews are laughable They complain about the story line and plot, claiming ""Dazed and Confused"" is a far better film. However, they have the same plot. ""Dazed and Confused"" follows high school students on the last day of class in 1979. Similarly, ""Everybody Wants Some"" follows college jocks the few days before classes start in the early 80's, so it takes place over several days not one. Both films follow a group over a short period of time with naturalistic acting. However, ""Dazed and Confused"" has under age drinking and driving and vandalism. Plus, the McConaughey character in ""Dazed and Confused"" is basically a pedophile. ""Everybody Wants Some"" is not a stoner film, it has a smaller standout testosterone driven cast with better dialogue. Thus, ""Everybody Wants Some"" is a more articulate, adult version of ""Dazed and Confused"" with a better soundtrack and better moves. The singing to ""Rapper's Delight"" in the car is a standout!",1481155200,,955,5.050632911392405

This is basically your usual teens/university students drinking, partying and trying to get laid film.  It's set in 1980 is the only difference to most made today, but there were obviously plenty that were made back in those days too.  It's as good as most past and present films in the genre, basically the characters we follow are players on a university baseball team who all live in two houses the town (who love their winning team) pays for so they don't have to live in the dorms.  Some of the players are new students fresh out of high school, others are in their final year and the rest are in between.  None of these characters are really interested in their academic qualifications the university will give them, they just want to party and hope they get picked up by a talent scout.  There greatest hurdles are each other.

Sure there's not really a storyline or much of a plot, the film isn't going to win any awards or anything like that, but that doesn't matter.  We're just a fly on the wall in the days before the first classes begin, but it's a pretty fun and entertaining film.",1478217600,,1278,4.408510638297872

I kept waiting for something to happen, but alas, it never did and there wasn't even any witty Linklater dialogue to make the uninteresting, entertaining.  I'm really shocked that Linklater allowed this movie to hit theaters without the edits it desperately needs.  Even the acting was weak.

It all takes place in about three days before the first day at class at an unidentifiable Texas college following the baseball team who are living in an Animal House type residence because the Athletic Dorms were full. They wonder around, drink and visit a disco, country western bar and punk rock bar. In between there is some insightful conversation and some baseball. There are no spoilers because there isn't much plot.

But the early-80's, when this was set, was during my early years in college, and is centered upon kids beginning their college experience, so this movie was equally salient for me, and the depictions of the people, atmosphere, clothes, etc., were equally salient.  The soundtrack is also excellent, with almost all of the different kinds of great music from various genres that were popular during that period, and played on college campuses, well-represented.

I'd rate it 3 stars. People into baseball, college life or younger folks might like it more. The film is quite similar to a lot of the old early-1980s teen sex comedy films.

7684585,5,B01CJW33B4,"College is an extension of high school only on a larger scale.  All the cliques and fringe groups are omnipresent suspicious of people who aren't like them.  One thing they share is disdain for the athletes, golden boys skating by on privilege and scholarships and steered to easy classes that won't interfere with practice.  The ballplayers portrayed in Richard Linklater's film aren't just looking for parties and chicks but they also want some understanding.  They circle the wagons because frankly they themselves are the only ones that empathize with them.  They may have been the best in high school but in college the stakes are raised and few if any can parlay their success into a professional contract, major or minor leagues.  The things that I like about Linklater's script is that he has fashioned dialogue that's believable for these characters, not too smart but definitely not dumb.  Another thing is these are likable characters that anyone would want to spend time with.  This is probably the most sensitive treatment of jocks since John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"".  Set during the advent of the Fall Semester of 1980 Linklater has an impeccable eye for period detail.  The soundtrack from this film encompasses all musical genres that college kids would have been listening to at that time.  I know because I was a senior in high school at the time the film is set.  If they put out a soundtrack it would be worth investing in.",1472947200,,1448,4.865306122448979

7684599,3,B01CJW33B4,"The film starts out promising with decent attention paid to specific material culture of the time (music, clothing, cars), but generally errs on not providing much of a narrative and is also unusually remarkable for static character development. The film waxes nostalgic for an era, the early 1980s,  and by extension, we assume, the director's own youthful days, but otherwise says nothing. The same cannot be said for Richard Linklater's earlier work, ""Dazed and Confused"" which covers similar, familiar, ground, but whose subtext speaks eloquently of the '60s hangover during the 1970s.  The main cast, all of the-hetero-normative male variety (with the single exception of a truly one-dimensionaland gratingfemale theater major character), aimlessly drift from party to party until an anti-climax of a Sunday baseball practice. (And that's it for plot.) The biggest problem is that there are far too many characters to follow so that they blur together, eventually. There's a beefcake power hitter; the 'token' African American; the Linklater ""South Texan weekend character"" type, played so beautifully by Matthew McConaughey in 'Dazed';  as well as a wide-eyed innocent;  there's a wackylikelyclosetedthereforeself-loathingneurotic; and a California stoner, whose arc amounts to a shaggy dog storyamong too many others. The use of these multiple athlete characters could have been pitched as 'Bad News Bears go to college,' however, because they fail at being archetypes, are uniformly underdeveloped, and are also weirdly allowed to share equal screen time with the winsome but forgettable straight-man protagonist, the audience is never allowed to fully invest or believe in any of their arcs.  Even the South Texas college town setting, which could have been a character on its own, is constrained by tight framing and isn't allowed to shine; rather, the limited budget compels a recycling of interiors in order to effect period correctness, without the high costs of making locations period-correct, and so, just like the characters, setting also fails to engage interest or advance dramatic tension. In sum, the movie just does not work as coming-of-age tale, a comedy, or a period piece.",1472256000,2,2198,5.452941176470588

Soon, however, the familiar rhythm of a Linklater film kicked in and I could just forget about where this plot was taking me and enjoy movie for what it is. There's no plot here, no backstories, it's just about a couple of guys who play ball and are obsessed with getting laid - and that, it turns out, is enough to make a fine movie.

Big shoutout to the soundtrack! The music was fantastic, I was looking up songs on Spotify every 10 minutes or so.",1471996800,2,541,4.356435643564357
7684610,4,B01CJW33B4,"The hijinks of teenage boys trying to make the jump to manhood has been documented in film forever.  It usually involves booze, drugs, sex and pranks in various quantities.  Most of the films repeat a common theme and to some degree, so does Richard Linklater here.  But there is something about his narrative that feels authentic and constructed with a proper mix.  Linklater grew up in Texas, specifically in the middle of the state (Austin, San Antonio, San Marcos) where this film was made.  Texas State University subs for fictitious Southeast Texas State.  He also played some baseball in college, so like some of his previous films (Dazed and Confused and Boyhood in particular) one would assume there is a biographical element to this one.

The movie opens a few days before school officially begins and ends on the first day of class.  The baseball team, including incoming freshmen, live in one of 2 houses next to each other.  No girls allowed upstairs and no alcohol of course.  Its 1980, so we know the boys will adhere to the rules.  Right.  The new student/athletes are treated with the usual hazing although what we see here is fairly mild.  There are about a dozen players who get attention and maybe 6 or 7 get the focus of their characters.

Certainly these early days before class begins are all about getting laid.  And it would seem the guys are pretty good with their charm offensive.  Blake Jenner plays Jake a new pitcher and early on he has his eyes on a girl he calls the brown hair girl, whose real name is Beverly (Zoey Deutch).  Shes a theater major, so theres some real diversity there.  As it turns out the baseball players and the art majors have more in common than you might think.  There is only one of the guys who is unlikable.  Jay from Detroit (Juston Street) has a good fastball and thinks hes the next Nolen Ryan.  But even he has his moments.

There are no bullies, no police altercations (close), fights, mistreatment of women or hard narcotics which would also seem to differentiate the film from others.  What the film is about is just a group of guys trying to figure out what is important and where they're headed.  Those priorities change by the day or the hour and will probably continue.  Right now baseball and girls head the list.  This is a highly enjoyable trip and for some, one down memory lane solidified with a great musical soundtrack.

7684612,5,B01CJW33B4,"Most of the negative reviews I've read are from people comparing this film to Dazed and Confused. While I understand the frustration, I'd have to disagree. If you're looking for a replacement or something you already view so nostalgically, you're not going to appreciate the character of this film.

The characters are outright jerks that you can't help but love. Though the film takes place over the course of three days, the viewer gains insight into the lives of these competitive jocks. Superficially, the team seems to be made up of the stereotypical 80's male with only two desires, partying and pussy. At the end of the movie, you're left with a reminder of why it's important not to judge someone based on first impressions.

Don't get me wrong. This film doesn't pass a Bechdel test and some of the characters would benefit from a bit more development. But something about Everybody Wants Some sticks with you. If you give it a chance you'll find yourself reaching the ending credits strangely inspired and with a desire to break out your old records.",1471910400,,1060,4.818681318681318

7684629,4,B01CJW33B4,"3.5 Stars. Linklater again does what he does best and shows us a piece of wandering life, where the plot takes second stage to the characters who are living this life. This time its 1980 and a young man, Jake (Blake Jenner) moves into the baseball house for freshmen year. They have three days before classes start. He learns about his teammates, goes to four parties (disco bar, western bar, punk basement party, and a theater party), hits up baseball practice, and hooks up with a theater major. Linklater coined it as the spiritual sequel to Dazed and Confused (1993), which followed a group of high schoolers through a night of partying at the end of the year. He has also called it a sequel of sorts to Boyhood (2014), his twelve year opus that follows the same actor from childhood to arriving at college. EWS! picks up right where Boyhood left us off but has different main characters.

Like the majority of his movies, the characters are always in motion. In Dazed and Confused they moved from party to party, and there even was a brief softball game. In the Before Trilogy [Before Sunrise (1995), Before Sunset (2004), and Before Midnight (2013)] Jesse and Celine were always on the move, walking, talking, and wandering. The trilogy even started with them on a train. In his original slice of life, Slacker (1991), it was the viewer that was moving through the town getting a glimpse of Austin, and its people.

Linklater has always taken a page from the books of French New Wave (1960s - 1970s) and Robert Altman [M.A.S.H (1969), McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971), The Long Goodbye (1973), Nashville (1975), The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993)]. The plot is secondary the characters and their philosophical ponderings of life. In EWS! Finnegan (Glen Powell) stands out the most, as he smokes his pipe always questioning. Theres a fun quip when Finnegan tell Jake that, yes they do dress up to fit into the parties. They don't really know who they are and part of life is finding that out. At the last party, none of the baseball players dressed up. They came as themselves.

Linklater hits another home run. While the movie isn't as meaningful as Dazed and Confused, the Before Trilogy, or Boyhood, its lighthearted and fun. The nostalgia makes you warm inside as you might relive something things from your youth. The only thing I would have to question is how these people could possibly be so cheery-eyed after days of pounding beer and smoking pot. Its like the alcohol and drugs didn't even affect them. That said, its movie worth checking out, especially if you're a Linklater fan.",1471392000,,2593,4.732300884955753

7684672,3,B01CJW33B4,"I started college in 1980, so I would have been a contemporary of the freshman in this film, but the similarities ended there.  Bringing us along for the ride with a group of baseball players in the weekend before school starts, ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" doesn't have a plot, per se; like other Linklater films, it relies on character and milieu to hold our interest.  And boy, do we get to know these characters, such as they are - young, full of themselves, and completely clueless, we watch as they get drunk, try to maneuver girls into bed, and engage in good-natured ribbing that often crosses the line into pointless cruelty.  It's partially redeemed by the main character, played by the unknown Blake Jenner (all of the actors are unknowns, but with an uncanny, inexplicable familiarity), who by the end demonstrates that he's capable of connecting with a female student on a more human level.

Linklater allows us to sympathize with these boys, who unlike most of us, have gotten where they are through their outstanding skill at playing baseball, yet like the rest of us, are just as bewildered at finding their place in a large, confusing world.  The music of the period is front and center, and every contemporary genre - rock, dance, punk, new wave, and country, unless I've missed a few - is represented almost as a token gesture of inclusiveness, like the sole black team member, and the boys seem to have an astonishing ability to immediately summon whatever wardrobe and dance moves are appropriate at the moment.

7684673,5,B01CJW33B4,"""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is just a wonderful 2016 film where writer/director Richard Linklater, as usual, is on target with recollections of his youth. I went to Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas (where much of this movie was filmed) just a few years after the movie's setting of 1980 and can say it's essentially accurate.

In town, there was the New Wave bar and the Country & Western bar, and we would drive to Austin on the weekends for the punk shows at Liberty Lunch (we saw The Replacements on a night the city was covered in ice). When the theater/dance majors made appearances at the clubs, they were almost always adorned in similar attire as shown in this film. And while watching these scenes, I recalled a dance major I fell in love with and am at this very moment wondering how her life turned out.

""Everybody Wants Some!!"" (not sure I like that title) is not as structured as Linklater's classic 1993 work&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dazed-Confused-Widescreen-Flashback-Edition/dp/B00029RTAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dazed & Confused (Widescreen Flashback Edition)</a>, which is not to say it's not a five-star film. It is a ""day"" in the life of a college freshman, ingeniously told during the hectic three days counting down to the start of class. I remember those days, the awkward first-time meeting of classmates, the uncomfortably weathered decor of the living quarters, roommates in various states of sobriety strolling by. And the vinyl records. In the early 1980's, no one could go anywhere without their milk crate of records.

Akin to ""Dazed and Confused,"" which served as a springboard to a number of major acting careers, ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" has several excellent performances including Ryan Guzman and Glen Powell. Powell especially almost steals the film as the talkative and gregarious Finnegan, usually chomping a pipe while showing young Jake (Blake Jenner) the campus ropes.

I lived these days, incidents both terrifying and wonderful, believing I would remember each moment for the rest of my life. Such inspirations inspire the kind of art Linklater creates.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slacker-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00DHN8G1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slacker (Criterion Collection)</a>, ""Dazed and Confused,""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-Sunrise/dp/B00002E224/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before Sunrise</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boyhood-Blu-ray/dp/B00MEQUNIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boyhood [Blu-ray</a>] -- Linklater's roll call reveals an unlikely but truly great director, so subtle and observant.

If you're expecting some huge plot with tormented but overall lovable characters and a clearly defined villain...you'll be sorely disappointed. The biggest conflict in this film is who's *actually* gonna get some. The baseball scene (yes, ONE scene of their practice...in the fall....not even during baseball season...) is relatively short, but fairly entertaining. It does end with the ""freshie's"" being hazed a bit, but its still fairly good natured and no real injuries are shown. Some of the male, college-aged characters are annoyingly ridiculous (accurate, from what I remember of my college years), but a couple still manage to be endearing with a surprising depth despite all their macho posturing. It would have been great to explore more of that, but we don't really even get to the crux of it until towards the end of the film. The rest of the scenes are mostly parties at bars or frat houses, although anyone who is watching this movie for the eye candy that is Tyler Hoechlin will be extremely delighted at the axe scene....

Well that teaches me, don't wait a year for a movie in anticipation.  Just keep truckin.  rent don't buy.

7684827,3,B01CJW33B4,"Even though Everybody Wants Some!! has the worst title of any movie this year, it has a charm that one wouldnt expect from a story about a group of jocks preparing for the new college semester.

The film opens with Jake Bradford (Blake Jenner, TVs Glee) driving his Olds 442 into the parking lot of Southeast Texas State University, ready to begin his freshman year on a baseball scholarship. The movie takes place over the next three days before his first class. In episodic fashion, we see Jake getting to know his teammates, visiting the off-campus hot spots, suffering hazing indignities, putting up with the guys idiosyncrasies, and falling for a theatre major who expands his social circle.

There are touches that effectively suggest the 80s  vintage video game machines, waterbeds, discos, tight jeans, mosh pits, vinyl LPs, and pre-AIDS casual hook-ups. The soundtrack, in particular, really transports the viewer to that period with songs from Devo, Blondie, Cheap Trick, Frank Zappa, Queen, Pat Benatar, and The Cars, among others.

Director Richard Linklater (Boyhood, Dazed and Confused) is best at depicting the bonding among Jake and his teammates and their endless, often humorous competitiveness. Female characters, with the exception of Beverly (Zoey Deutch)  the girl Jake is attracted to  are literally  background atmosphere. There is no major plot running throughout the picture. Instead, a series of vignettes highlights each player for a while and nothing ever ties these moments together into a cohesive whole. Its pleasant enough spending time with these guys but afterwards theres a sense of, Why did I invest two hours with this film?

If Everybody Wants Some!! were a TV series, such an approach would be fine, since there is time to stretch story lines and deepen characterization. In a feature film, however, there should be some payoff for the viewer who becomes invested in these characters. It never comes.

Jenner plays Jake not as a naive kid from the sticks, which might have been the easier approach. Hes pretty hip, self-assured, and certainly good looking, but hes also a down-to-earth regular guy without the arrogance of a Big Man on Campus type. Its mentioned that the baseball team is the only athletic team at the school that consistently makes it to state championship competition, so the unstated reality is that Jake is a catch for the co-eds. But this would be the ultimate cliche, and Jenner manages to come across as both a fun-loving guy and a gentleman.

Conflict drives narrative, whether in drama or comedy. Its the hook that gets us involved and holds our attention as we anticipate how the conflict will be resolved. Though Everybody Wants Some!! has some minor conflicts along the way, there is no central one. If you were graphing the conflict level, there would be no major peak, just little bumps.

Rated R, Everybody Wants Some! is at its most endearing in the smaller moments a first phone call between Jake and Beverly in which each is clearly interested in the other, a moment when jock bravado gives way to insecurity, teammates sharing hopes that top performance will attract scouts from the Major Leagues. Not many directors would risk making a film that is entirely character-driven and depends on the viewers getting on board the journey of a group of guys navigating the responsibilities of team membership without sacrificing a good time.

7684844,5,B01CJW33B4,"I'm generally not a fan of 3D conversions, I always find a terrible couple of scenes that clearly weren't properly budgeted or maybe they ran out of time to do. Not the case with Everybody Wants Some at all. There were times watching this that I actually thought it was filmed in 3D.

Linklater did a masterful job selecting an eclectic range of parallaxes that make the 3D version in my humble opinion, far superior to the original 2D format. Specifically there's a truly cinematic sliding punch out of a baseball in the batting practice scene that totally hits the viewer with the feels. It's difficult to describe how 3D can make the music and mis-en-scene enhanced sometimes, but now I think I can just articulate it by showing my good friends this segment in 3D.

There's also plenty of unique onscreen foreshadowing through subtle metaphor. Pulling out spherical objects gradually, purposefully in front of the main characters was an intrepid move by the director in post. It's a powerful subtle nod to the metaphor of Sisyphus and if your observant, touches on Genesis and Campbell's Mono-myth. It added a level of proficiency to the cinematography that renders it meaningful rather the just plain. The film slugged through it's shot selection before the conversion. Now it shines. I cannot recommend this enough to fans of cinema who are wary of putting on the glasses. The canvas is larger now, and this film has the courage to take advantage. 5/5",1468368000,,1456,4.843373493975903

7684847,5,B01CJW33B4,"I love how people do absolutely no research before investing time and money into a movie and then go and crap all over it because they didn't know what they were getting into!
 If you've ever seen a Linklater film, you'll know that many of them are realistic character studies.  They deal with interpersonal relationships and existentialism.  They famously have very little ""story"" elements that characterize modern cinema and that is why many people are drawn to his films.  Slacker, Dazed and Confused, Waking Life, even all his Ethan Hawke movies are based solely in providing the experience of real life reflected back at the viewer.  He makes you forget who you are for a while and let's you wholly experience someone else's ego, id, fears, hopes, and triumphs.
Everybody Wants Some!! does everything good Linklater films do.  It engrosses, it engages, it has a deep love and respect for it's characters while not praising their actions or condemning them.  It exists as a snapshot of these people at this time in this location doing what they do.
Now here's where the backlash from most reviewers comes from; this film is about a college baseball team in Texas in 1980, and the ultra competitive, beer swilling, girl chasing, partying that accompanies said team.  If you dislike machismo, or competition, or sports, or partying, or think anything relating to being dude-bro-jock-frat types is a horrific societal crime, then DON'T WATCH THIS FILM!!!  I think people have targeted this movie and are using it as a platform to make their stand against competitive male behavior.  If that bothers you, you need to think about why confident good looking men who get laid make you uncomfortable.  It says much more about you than them or the filmmaker.
I found the film to be completely enjoyable, totally relatable (my uncle literally met my aunt in 1980 by cruising around in his car talking to girls), the characters realistic (with some slight touches of fantasy: most college freshman aren't nearly as put together as the male and female lead roles) and their interactions and experiences fun, empathetic, and life-affirming.  The year 1980 was awesomely represented through the bars, dress, and music (fantastic use of Pink Floyd's deep cut ""Fearless"").  The acting was excellent and many times through the movie I found myself saying, ""That guy needs to get more work!""  There are some existential conversations that speak to Linklater's love of the topic but then with nary a second thought he brilliantly concedes to the meat-headedness of a college ballplayer by giving the dumbest member of the crew these lines; ""Who ARE all these people?...Like I know what we're doing here.  We're playing baseball.  But what are all these other guys doing here?...They'll just be some dude with some job...""  Linklater also does a good job of giving individual personalities to each member of the team beyond the normal, ""he's the funny guy, he's the sweet guy, he's the ladies man, he's the narcissist"".  They all humble each other daily which makes them a team with no overt pretentions or animosity (except in the case of the new pitcher who swears he can throw 95 mph!) just a desperation to win and really gives a realistic sense of team and living dynamics.
In closing, if you enjoy Linklater's earlier works you'll have no problems with Everybody Wants Some!!.  If you need a traditional three act Hollywood comedy full of ridiculously over the top antics look elsewhere.  If you hate any semblance of competitive male-ness, stay far away!  If you want to experience three days in the lives of this college baseball team from Texas in 1980 check this out!  I was thoroughly entertained and not at all disappointed!  Highly recommended to anyone who knows what they're getting into!",1468368000,151,3787,4.947867298578199
7684848,5,B01CJW33B4,"I love how people do absolutely no research before investing time and money into a movie and then go and crap all over it because they didn't know what they were getting into!
 If you've ever seen a Linklater film, you'll know that many of them are realistic character studies.  They deal with interpersonal relationships and existentialism.  They famously have very little ""story"" elements that characterize modern cinema and that is why many people are drawn to his films.  Slacker, Dazed and Confused, Waking Life, even all his Ethan Hawke movies are based solely in providing the experience of real life reflected back at the viewer.  He makes you forget who you are for a while and let's you wholly experience someone else's ego, id, fears, hopes, and triumphs.
Everybody Wants Some!! does everything good Linklater films do.  It engrosses, it engages, it has a deep love and respect for it's characters while not praising their actions or condemning them.  It exists as a snapshot of these people at this time in this location doing what they do.
Now here's where the backlash from most reviewers comes from; this film is about a college baseball team in Texas in 1980, and the ultra competitive, beer swilling, girl chasing, partying that accompanies said team.  If you dislike machismo, or competition, or sports, or partying, or think anything relating to being dude-bro-jock-frat types is a horrific societal crime, then DON'T WATCH THIS FILM!!!

7684849,2,B01CJW33B4,"Although I could only watch about an hour and ten minutes of the movie before I had to stop from the sheer lack of plot or character development, it seemed like a good movie to watch if nothing else was on or you were on a plane for a few hours. I can appreciate the costume design; it was really accurate and it was really cool to see that in a modern movie. Some of the acting was like something out of a Hallmark TV movie, and the whole movie seemed to revolve around, ""HUH HUH I HAVE A PENIS AND IT'S FUNNY AND RELATEABLE TO WATCH ME HIT ON GIRLS AND HAVE FREAKING AWESOME SEX, AM I RIGHT BOYS HUH HUH"". I mean, sex is great and all, and I'm sure that the early 80s weren't exactly the cleanest, but I mean, come on. Every single character is obsessed with freaking poontang and where to find it. Like, we get it, can you tell a joke now? The writing wasn't that creative either, and pretty much every other word was eff this or eff that. I REALLY wanted this movie to be awesome, I really did, but it just isn't that special. The fact that I paid money for this kind of makes me sad, but I highly doubt that this movie will even make TV. Looking at the trailer had me excited -- Stylistically it looked so super cool -- but trust me when I say that this movie has zero storyline whatsoever. It's just a bunch of baseball dude-bros with the stereotypically nice handsome main character guy mixed in, but even he can be kind of hateable sometimes. My favorite character in all honesty was the stereotypically laid back stoner guy from California (because you know, stoners only live in California) because he wasn't a complete jerk and actually had some dialogue. Of course, what was meant to be funny wasn't, but he was cool so I went with it. Honestly, if you're thinking of renting this, don't, unless you're rich and looking for a 4/10 movie to watch with no regrets. If you enjoy hypermasculinity to its fullest, please watch this film because you will probably love it. If you are a middle aged man who graduated from college between the years 1978-1982 and were on a sports team and swear a lot, please watch this film because you will probably enjoy it from sheer relatability. If you are a person who likes boobs and daisy dukes, please watch this film because there is mostly just that and nothing else. OTHERWISE, just don't do it man. It's not worth it. Just go watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off or Animal House for like, the 20th time. Hey, no shame here! Atleast Animal House has a plot!",1468281600,7,2501,4.334754797441365

I particularly noted a star turn by young Michael Monsour, playing the protagonist's high school buddy, Jason, turned crazed punk rocker. Literally leaping into the scene like a manic superhero, his energy and drive captivate. You can't take your eyes off him. Oh, the disclosure? He's my nephew, and I couldn't be prouder.

Some compare it to ""Dazed And Confused"" or ""Animal House"" but it's nowhere near as good. At least in those films the dialogue was good, as was the acting and the movies were funny. I just didn't find ""Everybody Wants Some"" to be all that entertaining. Many of the characters in the movie I found annoying, especially the dorky guy who gets mad at the bartender in the club. Some of the actors looked way older than college kids and what's with the guy with the thick beard? Don't ever remember seeing those on twenty year olds in 1980. Today you see young guys with thick beards (mostly dyed black) usually with shaved heads but not back then. That just wasn't the trend. All around bad casting and just a complete flop. Get it from Redbox or wait till it's on cable. It's worth watching once, that is, if you can sit thru the entire movie to the end.",1468281600,3,989,4.380434782608695

This is exactly what the tag line says it is...a spiritual sequel to Dazed and Confused. The movie really isn't about anything but a group of college kids and what they do before school starts. Baseball, parties, girls, drinking and everything else they can get their hands on. I did like this and enjoyed it quite a bit, but it's no where near the classic that Dazed and Confused is. This is a good one time watch but nothing that I could see over and over. Overall, if you saw Dazed and Confused than you will know what to expect from this movie. Just don't expect it to be as good.

7684859,5,B01CJW33B4,"Richard Linklater has a knack for creating films that break from the normative and give you something that almost feels like a recap of days past. Not everyone will like this movie, and not everyone should - ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is a film for a very specific audience. Those who grew up in the 1980s, or listening to their parent's classic rock, or partied with a group of misfits in college all the while striving to be more than something other than just ""any Average Joe"" is the crowd who this movie speaks too. If you've done a few things you couldn't believe (or repeat) in the name of having a good time, and surprised yourself going outside the barriers that make up your day-to-day life, then this film will speak to you, guaranteed. If you can't let loose, grab a beer, and watch a movie with a bunch of solid (if not yet established) young actors doing nothing of particular consequence, all the while understand that this film will never win an Oscar, then don't waste your time. Great successor to 1993's ""Dazed and Confused"" -- you don't want to miss it!",1467763200,2,1071,4.55440414507772
7684860,4,B01CJW33B4,"Everybody Wants Some is part 3 of an unofficial ""growing up in Texas"" trilogy, preceded by both Dazed and Confused and Boyhood respectively. As someone who was born and raised in the Houston area just like director Richard Linklater (albeit not in the 70's or 80's) I can relate with much of what is shown in all of these films. Just watching Dazed and Confused is a rite of passage where I'm from (the movie takes place just about an hour from here).

However, with Everybody Wants Some, Linklater chose to make the film much more realistic, almost invoking a documentary feel, thus taking some of the magic out of a nostalgic film like this. Part of the reason other coming of age movies work so well is because of the romanticized view of a certain time period (Diner for example, 1959 Baltimore).

Something probably to be expected by this filmmaker at this point, but there wasn't a particular focus on mood in this movie. Instead the focus merely seemed to be on plainly (and not very interestingly) pointing and shooting the camera to capture very simple scenes. Even the music, which was used much more effectively in Dazed and Confused, almost just seemed incidental.

For a film that is simply trying to portray a realistic sense of what it was to be a Freshman at a Texas college, playing baseball, floating the river, chasing girls and all out partying in 1980, it has accomplished it's job. As a movie that is trying to be artful, it could have been better, specifically around building up particular scenes.

As someone who has experienced many of these things in real life, I may just be jaded, and maybe this film will speak to you on a different level than it did me. But, overall it was an enjoyable experience, while not nearly as many quotable lines (""I get older, they stay the same age""), noteworthy scenes (bring out the paddles!), or recognizable names (McConaughey, Affleck, Jovovich) as Dazed, it does serve as what will likely be the final film in this set.",1467763200,7,1984,4.66

As far as the people complaining that the film has no plot, well....they are little brains and ignore them. What is really disturbing are the social justice warriors that have commented negatively about this film.(would have it made you paper thin pansies feel better if the director put a trigger warning at the beginning: Warning: Young men being young men!

This movie just didn't capture the '70s as well.  Although, I must say that the '70s was not only about drugs, booze and parties.  I respected my Dad too much to be carrying on like they did in these two movies.  But to each his own.  Although the cool cars of the late '60s were built a decade earlier, you would still see many of them roaming the streets during this period as they portray..

It's somewhat of a clich tale of college boys who like to drink,get high and get layed ! The emphasis being on Jenner's character (Jake) the newbie freshman who, due to being on the baseball team ends up living in the ""baseball house"".

He quickly .makes friends with a group of the guys on the baseball team and it's pretty routine from there. There's a little bit of romance in the film but it's basically a vehicle to showcase the era and it does that well. The styling ,art direction and set design are perfect.

It's pretty much Plotless, but it's fun, has a great soundtrack and full of witty dialogue. All of the actors do a great job because it's a most definatley a character driven film!",1466467200,,1033,4.532258064516129

8753338,3,B01CJW33B4,"A fun, not-too-deep film from Linklater about that interesting time in history when the late 70s became the early 80s, set in Austin, Texas. Linklater mines familiar territory, such as the older dude who's still in the scene (the wonderful character Willoughby from California) and the last scene being a satisfied partier's smile (just like Dazed and Confused). It reminded me a lot of Dazed and Confused, with a little bit of romantic comedy thrown in and a slight sprinkle of philosophic musing (mainly in the character of Willoughby), but it's no Scanner Darkly or Waking Life. It does, however, hit the nail on the head capturing those first few days before classes start when you go to college and are exposed to the romance and partying on a college campus. The ensemble cast works well, and the actor who plays Nesbitt is a standout. There are a lot of natural, quirky, funny moments. I liked the inclusion of the jocks merging with the emergent punk scene. The film looks great, with a lot of detail paid to that time period (cars, music, fashion, technology, etc). It just doesn't add up to much, but is worth seeing once. Think Bad News Bears grow up and go to college.",1532476800,,1180,4.677884615384615

Remember, you're not watching a novel and you're not watching a documentary. It's about experiencing a moment in time.
