8113962,4,B000ESX0U0,"I'm a pretty big TMBG fanatic and own most of their discs. I've seen them in concert several times and have heard a couple of these venue songs live before. If you are a huge fan then this should probably be in your collection. However, if you don't have most of their other material, there are better starting points. Its fun to see homestar runner again but the best part of this dvd was the bonus video for ""Damn Good Times"".",1351123200,,428,4.296296296296297
8113963,4,B000ESX0U0,"Venue Songs is an amazing collection of videos, and nothing short of what every TMBG fan should come to expect from the group.

The entire collection is binded together like a Twlight Zone episode with a guy who sort of me reminded me of Rod Serlingh.  Videos like ""garage"" (which I think is for their trip to Glasgowe) and the Homestar Runner one are hilarious.  Other good videos are the ones they did for the House of Blues, which are really sarcastic (I guess they don't like playing there?), and the Charlottesville video that has a ridiculous hitch-hikin cowboy that has super powers.

I not only recommend this DVD to hardcore fans, but also to people who appreciat music video as an artform.",1144281600,3,699,4.658536585365853
