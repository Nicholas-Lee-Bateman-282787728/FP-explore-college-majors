778246,5,6304044593,A great movie about the McGuire Sisters and the Mobsters. Fabulous music and singing for those who like the 40's and 50's ear.,1169078400,3,126,4.521739130434782
778247,5,6304044593,"What a great movie.  I loved everything about it.  Mary Louise Parker has never been more radiant.  In this movie, she has it all: talent, attitude,  romance, and a little humor on the side.  And speaking of wornderful  performances, John Turturro gives, in my opinion, one of his best.  We love  to hate him and he makes being a gangster seem glamorous and suprisingly  ethical.  The added ""gansta"" crimes only add to the plot of this  movie, as does the story of the stunning McGuire sisters.  By the end you  with laugh and cry and flat out have a good time.  It is a nice change from  all of the other garbage around.  Excellent!",966816000,25,633,4.421052631578948
778248,4,6304044593,"Sugartime is an interesting and entertaining movie.  It is most  interesting when Mary-Louise Parker is on screen. She is prim and beautiful  and is a perfect offset to Turturro's portrayal of Sam Giancana.  The movie  tries its best to place historical references to Kennedy, Hoover, et al.  Sugartime is an excellent choice for a fun, enjoyable evening.",961027200,13,355,5.140350877192983

778320,2,6304044593,"I recently saw a special on PBS that contained clips of the McGuire Sisters, and i was reminded how great they really were. I remember that when I was about ten years old, my favorite record was ""Sincerely"" by the McGuire Sisters. This film picks up on them in 1960, when their hit streak was coing to an end. In fact, the only hit recreated in this movie is ""Sugartime"" and it is sung badly and lip-syched badly as well. The girls on screen look nothing like the McGuires. The movie primarily concerns itself with the troubles of Sam Giancana. I found it tedious and boring. Don't bother.",1436745600,,589,4.462962962962963
778321,3,6304044593,Any motion picture with John Turturro (sp) in it gets my positive vote.  Otherwise I feel it was just another run of the mill bad guys movie.  The actress who portrayed one of the McGuire sisters favored by the Turturro character was good.  Final verdict - decent motion picture with competent acting by the main performers.  Good production values and technically well done.,1432684800,2,375,4.904761904761905

778375,4,6304044593,"Whether you're into the mobster genre or love that period in America where entertainers and gangsters crossed paths, you'll dig the hell out of this.  The story of Sam Giancanna is always interesting to watch, but John Turturo plays Giancanna as the perfect loose cannon in the mob he was.  Mary Louis-Parker is every bit as beautiful and sexy as Marilyn Monroe.  Definitely needs to be right there on your shelf next to Goodfella's and Casino!",1388448000,,444,4.815789473684211

778378,4,6304044593,Not much distortion to this story. Well acted and played. Music and sound very good. Retells the mob obsession of Sam G's with Phylis McGuire with much intensity and abandon. I think you will enjoy it if you like to review these type of relationships.,1349395200,3,251,4.6
778379,5,6304044593,"Received the movie so quickly it was amazing - like in just 2 days from order! Movie was very suspenseful and entertaining. Enjoyed movie immensely. Only one violent basebal bat scene we prefer not to see again which is reason we cannot recommend this movie due to heavy violence on one sequence. If this baseball bat scence can be edited, this movie is great entertainment and really love the music too. Mcguire sisters really sing beautiful and very entertaining as well!",1322870400,3,473,4.851851851851852

778443,4,6304044593,"John Turturro and Mary-Louise Parker bring out the ""what's it like to date a gangster but try to keep a good reputation"" in this film.  John plays Sam Giancana a Chicago mobster trying to show his best side to the gal of his dreams Phyllis Maguire.  Stay open minded though, because they try to stay true to history but some facts are a bit scrambled.  Phillis was in reality The All American Girl.  It's just the kind of rainy Friday or Saturday night to cuddle up with your significant other and a bowl of popcorn and be drawn in to a good story.

My wife and I liked it a lot.",1288137600,,579,4.18018018018018
778444,5,6304044593,Very simply I love this flick! It's off the wall but I personally love watching this movie. I'm a gangster flick junkie to begin with. I'm sure liberties were taken as to the filming but you won't be disappointed. John Turturro is outstanding in the role of Sam Giancana.,1282953600,,271,4.551020408163265
778445,4,6304044593,"Sam Giancana was a famed mob boss from Chicago.  Phyllis McGuire was the lead singer of the popular 1950's vocal group The McGuire Sisters, and sang in her church regularly.  How did these two distinctly different people come to fall in love with one another?

The film ""Sugartime"" answered this question for me, as their love was portrayed as being very passionate, caring and loyal.  It became very believable to me that these two people could have fallen in love despite their divergent backgrounds and lifestyles.  Mary-Louise Parker was absolutely radiant in her portrayal of Phyllis, and John Turturro did an excellent job portraying Sam, the tough mobster with a soft side.

If you are interested in mob history, or in the McGuire Sisters, I highly recommend this film to you.  I hope that Phyllis McGuire writes a book one day, because she has led quite an interesting life!",1262390400,2,882,4.879194630872483
778446,3,6304044593,"It's an excellently done film with a strong script, outstanding actors and acting, great cinematography and obviously a hefty budget.  But though ""based on a true story"" it misses the mark on the McGuire Sisters by several country miles. Phyllis was never the sultry, conniving, sexpot portrayed here.  She was, and is, very much in the All American mode.  She happened to fall in love with a gangster.  It's that simple.  He wasn't handsome, he wasn't a great mind but had a charm and sincere love for her that captured her.  To her credit she never denied knowing him or his being her friend even when it would have been easy to do just that.  The film also portrays Christine and Dorothy as two dumbos when in real life the McGuires were smart, disciplined and extremely talented.  They still are!  They also were and are devoted to their families. In the film they are portrayed as if they hardly could hold a conversation.  In real life they are warm, classy, charistmatic ladies.  Just to set it all straight.",1226275200,10,1015,4.646067415730337
778447,4,6304044593,A very entertaining film with fine acting by Mary-Louise Parker and John Turturro.  The widescreen DVD has very good picture and sound.,1220313600,,135,5.136363636363637
778448,3,6304044593,"SUGARTIME (1995) will attract Mafia-phile DVD viewers, who get a kick  out of stories
touching upon what goes on behind the scenes, in the underworld, for example.

The script is well written, and the filming is fine, professional, almost in wide-screen
format;  the strength of this picture is the timepiece it constitutes, in terms of
music, club acts, restaurants, cars from the 50's and 60's shown and the clothes people wore
back then, and some home decorations.

It puts into place some light Scorcese elements, namely the juxtaposition of calm and violence,
murder and gambling- taking bets on the rubout victim, the  mixing of the joy of sports and baseball, with
using abat as a weapon to tkae  out solidiers who were skimming on the side, out of line, unleashing their
own pet projects of theft without the caporegime's - pesonovante's authorization, causing
disruption in the deals made earlier with  the bought  authorities, bringing bad press in the mass media, and
a public outcry for a crackdown on anarchy.

The musical act of the McGuire sisters, apparently 2 identical twins and another sister, is
intriguing in its simplicity and mysterious as to who in a night club might be the intended
audience for those jingles.

The challenge of this work, was to make a 90 minute motion picture out of trivial life events
that happen millions of times every month ( romance between a man and a woman) with the only
difference that, the age-old allegations and rumors of Frank Sinatra being implicated in fronting
gambling operations in Nevada resurfaces and  as well as those of JFK having been elected
with the assistance of the mob, namely, through Giancana, with various COngressmen
on the take in gratitude, as well as  the secret service hiring the mob to take out Castro in Cuba, etc.

The unanswered questions, revolve around the accuracy of the story told, and how well rooted
it is in reality, since most of what is shown concerns the private - intimate and personal lives
of a showgirl with the mobster.

The acting seems optimal considering the story told, and the relaxed acting carried out by
Mary Louise Parker, playing the showgirl, and JOhn Turturro, playing the wiseguy.

The sizing up of that showgirl, is probably not far-fetched,  when it has the girl rejecting
the proposal from Turturro, until the latter does some name dropping, making clear he could
advance the girl's career by bringing her talents to the attention of Sinatra (a long shot.) Other aspects,
such as extravagant building of hotels, the gifting of a Cadillac, jewelery and more, also seems realistic
considering the wealth of the gifter.

Perhaps the comical aspects of this work  will fail to hit the mark among many in the audience,
but there are quirky moments such as ""My husband was a louse. I  miss the bast-rd"", after admitting
she was a gold digger, much as the showgirl here seems to be, or a quip about the girl not being
appreciative of the millions spent in hotel developments with ""I made a major investment in some
romantic sh-t here!"" or  a congressman is told to  ""Just find out who needs to be fed !""
so he can buy that person's testimony or favors, etc.

Obviously, some in the audience will frown with dismay at Turturro pushing a crew member out of a moving
car, on the passenger side, or the coarse language, etc, but it's all for authenticity's sake.

Overall, taken for what it's worth, this movie packs the sensual energy of Parker, with some
comedy and violence, and  easy, imaginary, light entertainment.",1215302400,,3528,4.831946755407654
778449,4,6304044593,A well done movie with good acting by ML Parker.  I enjoyed it and found it interesting in its coverage of a period and a culture that I was not very familiar with.

778451,5,6304044593,"I love this movie! It's fun, piquant, thoughtful, provocative. This movie was my introduction to John Turturro, a delightful actor with a thoughtful presence. In spite of the character of the mobster Sam Giancana, I could see the soft, lovable side of him that Phyllis Maguire simply could not walk away from. I could even see his integrity: in spite of being offered complete immunity, he refused to talk once he was arrested.

Maguire's denial about Giancana's ""work"" was palpable - as was his own. I could not believe I could find them an adorable couple - and yet I did. I've been a Mary-Louise Parker fan since Fried Green Tomatoes, Boys on the Side, Angels in America and Weeds. This is a side of her I had not ever seen. She's delicious. A great, historical love story.

Yes, they're moments in this film dedicated to such ruthlessness, however I would like to see something a little more wholesale on the topic.
