722036,5,6303683568,"In 1958, photographer Art Kane (on his first photographic assignment) assembled a group of legendary Jazz musicians on the steps of a brownstone on 124th Street and Madison Avenue in Harlem for a group photograph.  The photo was to appear in a special edition of Esquire magazine.  The result is one of the most famous photographs taken in the 20th century.  This film tells the story of the photo, the photographer and many of the musicians who took part in the project.

Getting that many jazz musicians together at eleven o'clock in the morning was trickier than you might think - most of the participants were usually sleeping at that hour, as many by trade were working in nightclubs until the wee hours of the morning.  Indeed, some of the musicians who were invited failed to show up, either unable to commit themselves to awakening at such unaccustomed hours or misunderstanding the depth of the project completely.

There are wonderful interviews with some of the original musicians, notably Art Blakey and Dizzie Gillespie, but a number of other musicians are heard from as well, including trumpeter Buck Clayton, singer Marian McPartland and the great saxophone player, Gerry Mulligan.  The participants in the photo are a veritable who's who of Jazz; some of the musicians include Red Allen, Buster Bailey, Count Basie, Lester Young, Maxine Sullivan, Stuff Smith, Pee Wee Russell, Jimmy Rushing, Sonny Rollins, Theolonious Monk, Charles Mingus, Gene Krupa, Max Kaminsky, Jo Jones, Milt Hinton, Art Farmer, Vic Dickenson, Lawrence Brown, Coleman Hawkins, J. C. Heard and Oscar Pettiford.  The surviving musicians interviewed for the film offer fascinating comments on their peers.

The film notes sadly that many of the musicians in the photo are no longer with us.  In fact, a new photo was created for the occasion using the survivors from the original shoot, and the number of musicians who have since passed away is shocking.  The ""new"" photo is one of the most touching aspects of the special features; the survivors are each posed in the same spot that they occupied in the original photo, and the number of ""blank"" spaces (compared with the original photo) is somber, touching and somewhat eerie.

The DVD has a number of other wonderful extras.  One menu presents a copy of the original photo; you can navigate to any image in the photo to see any musicians name, and clicking on the name will bring up a collage of all points in the documentary (including outtakes) where that musician is discussed by his or her peers.

To have a record of the story of this historical photograph is truly a blessing.  It was a great day for my DVD collection when I acquired this wonderful film.",1136332800,111,2700,4.890350877192983
722037,5,6303683568,"In preparation for the onslaught of Ken Burns' 19-hour PBS juggernaut I looked at a few enjoyable, well-made, BRIEF jazz documentaries recently.  A Great Day In Harlem is perhaps the most entertaining.  You wouldn't think that such a fine film could be made about such a seemingly slight subject----a 1958 Esquire photo of as many jazz musicians as they could scare up at the ungodly hour of ten in the morning.  But at least two factors help make the film good, even great: First, it's no longer than it needs to be; only an hour.  Second, they got in touch with as many of the surviving subjects of the photo as possible, letting the jazz musicians themselves talk about the occasion.  Simple things, but they work.  Several of the musicians who talk in this film have since passed away, Dizzy Gillespie for one, making it all the more treasurable.  It also reminds one of what a time the 50's were in jazz---modernists of several stripes were already working, many of the original boppers were still around, and major figures of the 30's and even the 20's were still on the scene.  I'll stop short of calling it a rich tapestry, but to see it exemplified in this amazing photo (and home movies too!) is kind of breath-taking.",983232000,39,1228,4.626728110599078

722039,5,6303683568,"The brainchild of an Esquire magazine art director led to this wonderful  moment in our cultural and national history -- almost 60 jazz musicians  gathered on 120th Street in Harlem in 1958 for a photograph. This video  draws on the memories of some of those who were there: Dizzy Gillespie,  Sonny Rollins, Marian McPartland, Art Blakey, Gerry Mulligan, Milt Hinton,  Bud Freeman among them -- to recreate the moment. Lots of film footage of  the gathering and many touching moments are included, from Count Basie  sitting on the curb with the neighborhood youngsters to Thelonious Monk's  surprise showing -- late as usual. This was a monumental task, getting 60  jazz musicians to gather at 10 a.m., the equivalent of 4 a.m. in our world,  and they did it!

While the film is too short (just under and hour) to go into any great detail, and maybe a little too much time is spent on various greats 25 years later saying how great everyone else was, there's a sweetness and infectious enthusiasm that director Bach (no spring chicken herself) brings to this collection of memories of a time and place.

722192,5,6303683568,"As a jazz aficionado, I have always been fascinated by Art Kane's 1958 photograph... so many outstanding jazz artists in one place!  I was amazed to find that someone had actually used it as the subject for a motion picture and pleased to learn it was still available.  Jean Bach knew many of those in the photo and was able to track down many who were still alive to get their stories.  Fortunately for her (and us) bassist Milt Hinton had videoed the shoot so there was film footage available. The package was well executed and is a treasure for any jazz fan, young or old.  It gives us the roots fifties jazz and should be seen by today's students of the genre so that they have a better understanding of what went before. Some of the stories are surprising and all of them are interesting.  Video clips of some of the musicians performing are a bonus. Writer Whitney Balliet summed it up perfectly when he said ""A brilliant, funny, moving, altogether miraculous documentary.""  Only three of those pictured in Art Kane's photograph are still living today.  Jean Bach
managed to speak with nearly 30 of the original fifty seven and captured their comments for posterity.  Five stars may not be enough for this tremendous contribution to jazz history!

Of the two discs the first is the story behind the photo, with personal recollections of musicians who are in it (I will provide a full list of the ones who contributed to the documentary in a comment to this review). It also has Art Kane himself discussing how he came to shoot it, with comments by those who assisted or were affiliated with Esquire Magazine for which the photo was shot: Steve Frankfurt, Robert Benton and Robert Altshuler. Jazz critic and writer Nat Hentoff also adds insights from his peripheral involvement. Quincy Jones does most of the narration, but Jean Bach is like an anchor who ties it all together.

There is additional footage from bassist Milt Hinton (who is in the photo) and his wife Mona. They were armature video photographers whose live clips of the event - from gathering of the musicians (herding is a better word) to side scenes - are not only valuable, but serendipitous.

The second disc contains more biographical information about the musicians as well as more anecdotes from the musicians themselves, as well as folks who were involved in putting the documentary thereto.

If you own the photo this film will make it literally come to life. I know that I do not look at my print of the photo the same way after watching this film and some of my own musical idols loom even larger because of the insights of their human sides that were brought out by their peers. This is truly an oral history more than a single day in 1958.

A few final notes: the photo itself was an integral part of the plot in the movie titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminal/dp/B00005JMYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminal</a>. Also, at the time of this review the only surviving musicians who were captured that magic day of August 12, 1958 are Benny Golson, Marian McPartland, Sonny Rollins and Horace Silver. One other movie that I recommend - and it's also a documentary from 1958 - is Bert Stern's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jazz-on-a-Summer-s-Day/dp/B00003OSU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jazz on a Summer's Day</a>. That was a film of the 1958 Newport Jazz festival featuring some of the same musicians in the photo, but the value is it also shows another facet of 1958 in both musical and cultural contexts.

722243,4,6303683568,"One August day in 1958, young photographer Art Kane invited all the jazz musicians then working the night clubs in New York City to meet on 124th Street for a group photo to grace the cover of `Esquire' magazine. Some 50 different musicians showed up for the photo, and this film by Jean Bach is the story of that occasion.

The problem Kane had was getting so many jazz musicians to show up at 11 O'clock in the morning, as jazz musicians work all night and often do not get to bed until sunrise. One jazz musician remarked at his astonishment on discovering that there were ""two ten O'clocks in the day"".

But with a handful of exceptions, show up they did. The film contains short face-to-camera interviews by many of the surviving musicians in the photo, who included Dizzie Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Marian McPartland, Count Basie, Sonny Rollins (an excellent & deeply thoughtful contribution), Gerry Mulligan, Charles Mingus, Maxine Sullivan, Lester Young and Coleman Hawkins. They talk about the occasion, about jazz, life in general and each other.

This is a 2-DVD set. DVD-1 is Bach's original and highly entertaining film; DVD-2 contains 3 hours of bonus material, a meticulously assembled montage of quotes about each musician participant which you can access via clicking on each musician's name. You have to work through each one individually, as there's no `play all' option.

Kane's original photo contained a front-row of street kids sitting on the sidewalk with the musicians. Many of these (obviously in their mature years) have been tracked down and interviewed for the film too.

It's not really a `music DVD' as such, but overall it's a great piece of history.",1358380800,2,1684,4.936395759717315

722300,2,6303683568,"The best documentaries use small events to tell much larger stories -- the story of one crime used as a tool to raise questions about the nature of justice, or the story of one sports season as a parable about human endeavor and the ability to overcome hardship. As such, I think there are two documentaries hiding behind Art Kane's famous jazz photograph -- there is the story of the photo itself, how it was arranged and shot and how it changed the lives of those responsible for it and portrayed in it and how one morning's work can produce an image that is remembered for generations. Secondly, there is the story of jazz.  Jean Bach, in making this movie, tried to do both and failed.

The subject of the photo itself is treated very briefly. We get a few sentences on the setup, some comments on how hard it was to corral everybody onto the steps, and brief references to the later careers of people involved. All together, this amounts to perhaps ten minutes of the running time. As for the other, the subject of jazz is too massive for this little documentary.

Mostly this documentary shows us surviving jazz men (and a few women) looking at copies of the Art Kane photo and saying some combination of ""this guy was a great <trumpet/saxophone/piano> player"", ""this guy was really nice,"" and ""this guy is a lot fatter now,"" followed by a brief film clip of the performer in question back in the 1950s.

Count Basie, Oscar Peterson, Dizzy Gillespie, Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk in the street, simply togheter in a simple day of august of 1958. This the essence of jazz. No other music could create this situation. Not the rock with too much money (... how put togheter the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Led Zeppelin, Ten Years After and others without the product managers). Not the classical neither for the convergence of talents neither for the difference of age (... Mozart, Bach, Schoemberg, Strauss, Beethoven). Jazz made it possible ! The essence in the city of jazz.

The red Flag on the Reichstag, Te Iwo Jima soldiers, The Twin Towers crush, The Berlin Wall are historical photos of the past century.

722383,4,6303683568,"A Great Day in Harlem (Jean Bach, 1994)

Art Kane was a photographer. Not a big name in the field, just a guy who knew how to put a picture together. But one day during the Jazz Age, Art Kane became one of the most memorable photographers in history; he gathered together fifty-seven of the biggest names in jazz for a single photograph. Bach puts that photograph into perspective, using interviews with some of the surviving members, archive footage of some of them performing, and analysis of the time. It's a small project, and it feels like a small project, but it resonates in a very big way with music fans of all types; A Great Day in Harlem was nominated for a Best Documentary Oscar in 1994 (losing to the more topical Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision), and deservedly so.

722386,3,6303683568,"I recall first seeing the lauded and multiply awarded jazz documentary A Great Day In Harlem a dozen or so years ago on PBS, and while not a jazz fan nor aficionado, it was a short film (only an hour) that seemed to compress much of jazz history into a convenient package. Later on, when PBS historian Ken Burns turned his formulaic eye on the art form, with a monstrous nineteen hour documentary series, I felt he could have learned alot from this film. Yes, like too many documentaries, especially on subjects like jazz, there is far too much hagiography of mediocrities going on, but the key difference as to why this slight film is considered a `success', filmically, while Burns' far more professional and well-financed series is considered a `failure', is due to one reason: concision.
  Thus, when I came upon a new two disk DVD version of the old documentary, I decided to revisit it, especially since it had a second disk that would probably have quite a bit more information than the actual film did. Where Burns was ponderous and pontificating in his simply named film Jazz, A Great Day In Harlem has a few of the then still living participants in first time photographer Art Kane's famous 1958 Esquire magazine photograph merely reminiscing about the day the shot was taken. Some, like drummer Art Blakey, seem to have gone senile, while others, like Marian McPartland, seem to be as sharp as ever. While certainly not insightful into the subject of jazz itself, the film does serve as a time capsule, and it does convey a more human side to the intellectually masturbated over art of jazz. Yes, there is far too much personal reminiscence and far too little insight into why the music is good and relevant- the lack of which may actually explain why jazz is in such steep decline in the country of its birth, but A Great Day In Harlem tackles almost all of its subjects- 58 in all, in just about a minute apiece, making it an MTV style documentary about pre-MTV music. What little narration is required is provided by Quincy Jones, and the film was directed by a New York City radio show host named Jean Bach- an aging white Upper West Side diva who seems to be the walking embodiment of the term dilettante. That said, she is an engaging old bird, especially in the bonus features, where she goes into great detail about how she went about conceiving of and making the film, which was co-produced and written with Matthew Seig and Susan Peehl.
  The story of the film is not about jazz, but the photograph, and the music takes a backseat to the personalities, even as it rambles on in the background, spiced with bits from films and tv specials from that era. The tv clips are especially revealing, and watching them give more insight into the art form's mid-Twentieth Century appeal than hours of egghead philosophizing by Burns cronies could. However, folks from the photo, such as Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins, Bud Freeman, Art Farmer, Marian McPartland, Art Blakey, Gerry Mulligan, and others go on and on, and the suspicion the film leves- that they really did spend hours rambling, is confirmed with humorous punctuation in the bonus features. There are also many other photographs taken that day by the participants- and used in the film, as well as color 8mm film taken by bassist Milt Hinton and his wife Mona, which illustrates just how difficult it was to get the often egoistic participants to group together as needed, especially with jazz superstars like Count Basie, Thelonius Monk, Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Mingus, Lester Young, and Gene Krupa all present. Also, many of the musicians spent far too long reminiscing, as the whole photo shoot took over an hour when it could have been done in five minutes.
  There are funny little stories, such as why Count Basie is sitting on the sidewalk with some children, and why certain musicians are standing next to others, or turned away from the camera. But, the film itself is not particularly deep. What makes this new release on DVD a treat is a wealth of extra features on both disks. There is an insert with an essay, and on the first disk, with the film itself, are featurettes on photographer Art Kane, latter day hagiographers Bill Charlap and Kenny Washington- who seemingly drool over the photo, a segment on `Copycat Photos' which try to get great people from different arts and cities in similar poses, as well as the filmmakers reminiscing on the making of the documentary, with a wealth of humorous outtakes. But, the real treat is on disk two, where nearly three hours of comments on certain musicians can be accessed by scrolling over to the person in the photo and pressing the play button for their segment.
  In sum, no one who is not acquainted with jazz will learn much of why to like the art form by watching A Great Day In Harlem, but they will still be entertained by the comments of those involved, and the manifest love and care, if not skill, that went into the photo and this documentary about it.
