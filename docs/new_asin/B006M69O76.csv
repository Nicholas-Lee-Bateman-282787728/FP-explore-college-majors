8500601,2,B006M69O76,"I bought this DVD with the DVDs made by Quay brothers because of the amazon recommendation.
Then, I found I wasted money for it.
This is too cheap compared to Quay brothers' artworks.",1346889600,,183,4.575757575757576
8500602,1,B006M69O76,"Avant Garde Animation is definitely a wrong title for this piece of work. The shorts on this dvd were for the most part live action with random crappy stop motion (That I could do better back in grade school) put in for no real reason besides its own pointless existence. The ""animation"" they do have looks crummy and cheap and in no way has any Avant-Garde elements. Honestly this film (if you can even call it that) feels like something a few guys made in 1 day then tried to pass off trash as treasure. This dvd is a total waste of money. I have to note 2 shorts on this film won a empixx award ,never heard of them? me ether and now I know why.",1331164800,3,648,4.110236220472441
8500603,5,B006M69O76,"The animated shorts on this collection are very surreal, absurdist, and bizarre. If you're a fan of David Lynch, the Brothers Quay, or Jan Svankmajer, then you'll like this compilation.",1329350400,,185,5.2
