8195280,5,B000QA7ORG,"Tommy Groszman Sp?) wasn't the Director. It was Dan Curtis who was the Executive Producer, co-writer, and Director of BOTH War and Remembrance and the Winds of War. Curtis allowed Wouk to write the entire screenplay for the Winds of War (1983) but became rather arrogant in wanting the writers' credit for Wouk's novel, including Wouk as LAST on the credits of writers in War and Remembrance (1988). There were three writers for War and Remembrance and only the original author for Winds of War. Whether you invest in the VHS version or the DVD version, you will not be disappointed in either selection. This 10.00 version is probably the better deal to later transfer onto your own blank DVD-RW if you truly want to save the 25.00. Either format will do, but the DVD is probably the best to invest in to keep this treasury of History and talent in its newest format with its sharpness and sound. The VHS version should be purchased if you do not want to invest in what the individual sellers' are asking for (however, with as many hours of programming provided, it isn't a bad deal to invest in the DVD format). I am only providing options for your own pocketbook if you would truly like to watch this mini-series as if to you it is so worth the watch, then I would say go ahead and purchase THIS format until you are able to find a better price. But as for the content, this is well worth the purchase in either format. There may be some disappointments in casting selections as the entire cast from The Winds of War are not included in War and Remembrance and for the first earlier episodes, it may be a bit hard to take. On the other hand, the remaining episodes are very powerful simply because the history structured around the Henry family is so very accurate (personally, I have my own strong position on the final days of Hitler that will not agree with the film's version--but even that would not be a strong enough reason to pass this up. The mini-series (if there are any today) just do not match even with a flick of a Bic, to the work and the outstanding detail featured in both mini-series. You will not find a better mini-series to invest in because it is an education, it will make you think and take seriously NOT to make the mistakes that were made during this era, and it is also worth the excellent talent to watch David Dukes who returns as ""Leslie Slote"" (who was also featured in ""The Winds of War""). Robert Mitchum as 'Victor ""Pug"" Henry' and Polly Bergen who plays ""Rhoda Henry"" (in such her perfect annoyingly selfish military wife) whose lives take such an interesting detour, indeed, are the perfect changes from the ""Winds of War"". A young Sharon Stone as Warren Henry's young wife is featured in this one, pre- ""Basic Instinct"", as attractive as ever. They've substituted many of the KEY characters like Jan-Michael Vincent's ""Byron Henry"" for Hart Bochner (why??? I do not understand). They exchanged Ali McGraw's ""Natalie"" for Jane Seymour (again, not a very wise choice as McGraw added spice and realism to her role. They exchanged John Houston's role as ""Aaron Jastrow"" for Sir John Gielgud (either one was fine actually, but Sir Gielgud's ""Aaron"" will eventually break your heart as he masters Aaron in the finer detailing).

As for Warren and Bryon's younger sister was changed out from the vibrant Lisa Eibacher (who was in high demand in the late 80s) was missed for an unknown actress who is so easily forgettable that I literally do not remember her stage name. Even the Hitler from the original Winds of War is changed in W&R (however, the actor, Berkoff, does a better job than the previous Hitler in which the actor was overstating Hitler almost as a caricature than Berkoff's interpretation of Hitler. I am sure that as wicked and as depraved as Hitler was, that he certainly wasn't spitting EVERY time that he spoke.

 Peter Graves as ""Palmer"" isn't as seen as much as he was in ""Winds"" but director Dan Curtis gave him some air time. It seemed that Curtis really got into a ""James Cameron"" role in this one, but as the story progresses, you will begin to appreciate the passage of time and the fevered pitch which progresses in a manner that if you are not human, WILL, touch you and frighten you as most of these events DID happen (and doesn't hurt to do a little digging of your own of the events which took place heard by the actual victims--this can be found on You Tube--regarding the ""ghetto paradise"" which is a humiliating and very real event. Herman Wouk is actually (I am not certain whether this writer and historian passed away or not) but his strong suit for writing actually comes from his profession as a well-rounded historian of the type that is very rare to find in these days.

 Wouk has a very careful and highly skilled story telling talent that will make you interested in WWII history and all of the events which surround and could very well threaten this era if we are not careful to consider and to even use these two sagas as teaching content for it's 90% accuracy (as no one is perfect, however, Wouk, cuts it close and is very careful in how these events unfolded). It leaves plenty of room for discussion for the next month or few.

Get the VHS version for the bargain--transfer it to DVD-RW, if you are not too spoiled by now--- if the cost is too steep for the DVD price or for your Debit/credit card charges. In either format, this saga is well worth the price.",1425081600,,5440,4.551583248212462
