8316766,5,B001KZVQBG,"I just saw this by accident on the Military Channel and it was one of the most well made, if not the most well made, documentaries of any type produced through the History Channel. All I can say is that I am very proud of the black men who served our country during WW2 When the most they could expect was racism for their self sacrifice. I had NO idea that there did in fact exist black combat units in the war, but this documentary opened my eyes. The stories of bravery are stunning, some of the most stunning stories of heroism and self sacrifice that came out of the war were in fact attributable to black soldiers. I was unaware that the MOA was awarded to seven black soldiers in the 90's, only one of which is still alive. It's worth watching just for his personal account alone.",1399161600,,787,4.2885906040268456
8316767,5,B001KZVQBG,"This DVD rewards the viewer an untold story of the African-American soldiers who fought racism in America, the armed services and the world and proved once and for all that courage knows no color even though they were not wanted by Eisenhower, Patton or Bradley.  The army's non-recognition policy of negro soldiers, though unwritten, was thoroughly evident throughout world war two and only was rectified with President Truman's executive order integrating the armed services.

ENJOY THIS VIDEO!  IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!
