8342321,4,B001TRUGIE,"This 1987-88 Season of this awesome sitcom that ran on CBS from 1984-89 introduced a new type of nuclear family to the 1980s: a pair of divorced women living with their children together in a somewhat cramped New York brownstone.

The mid-season debut of KATE & ALLIE'S replacement in the Spring of 1984 starring Susan Saint James as Kate McArdle and Jane Curtain as Allie Lowell was both a critical and commercial success. The shoulder pads, clunky answering machine, and hairdon'ts give away the decade, but the storylines of grown-up best friends supporting and, at times, sparring with each other during personal and professional crises are timeless.

Curtain and Saint James share a wonderful chemistry that makes them easy to watch. At the start of this 6-year sitcom, viewers are introduced to Allie's first post-divorce date, played by a dashing young Kelsey Grammar from CHEERS & FRASIER.

Almost 2 decades before the gals on SEX & THE CITY began tackling relationships, Kate summed it up best: ""Dating's about finding someone so you never have to date again."" By the time CBS cancelled KATE & ALLIE in the Spring of 1989, Kate and Allie's relationship had gotten a little hackneyed & stale and it was time for the ladies to move on. But those first few seasons were fast, funny, and full of possibilities since the show was still in its honeymoon phase, but perhaps the whole cast & crew of the show was getting tired & the show was running out of steam.",1400630400,,1464,4.778656126482214
