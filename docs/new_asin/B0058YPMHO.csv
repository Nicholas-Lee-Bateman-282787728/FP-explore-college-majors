4603604,4,B0058YPMHO,"This was another great season yet in my perspective. While the series has its' racier moments, most of the series (and this season) has such great writing within it, that you will spend so much of your time laughing you will not realize how much time has gone by in the end. On top of all of this, the DVD itself has some amazing bonus features that any Family Guy fan will simply love! My favorite thus far has to be the deleted scenes as well as the audio commentary on the Big Bang Theory, but there were so many other great add-ons too.

I will say that there were a couple of the episodes that I felt were not as good as the others, but that is to be expected from an entire season. All-in-all though I enjoyed this DVD and all of the extras that it provides to the viewer and if you are a fan of the show, you will too!",1348617600,,825,4.030487804878049
4603605,3,B0058YPMHO,"I have been a huge fan of family guy since it came on. I make sure to buy next volume whenever its released on DVD so I can have all the episodes available to me. It's always great to have episodes nobody has seen before so you can watch them together.
Every year it seems like they put less episodes on the DVD release, and now are behind putting volumes out. (We all know that they are)
They do it on purpose. instead of putting episodes on the volume, they pack it full of unnecessary bonus features nobody (Even die hard fans) care to watch, put 3 episodes on each disc to make the box bigger, and they jack up the price and expect you to pay more for it.
They stopped caring about making people laugh, and decided to get greedy.
I'm getting tired of spending the extra money for old episodes left over from 2 seasons ago. Dont waste your money, wait for the price to drop, or buy it used.
I'm not a very big Family guy fan anymore. It's not even anywhere near as funny as it used to be. You can tell they are running out of ideas. I'm surprised the show hasn't been cancelled again.
I have turned my attention to American Dad and the Cleveland Show. Don't buy these unless you're OCD like me and can't stand an unfinished collection.",1345593600,31,1238,4.227848101265823
4603606,5,B0058YPMHO,ok one thing i don't understand about all this is that the UK has volume 10 and 11 already but we barely made it to volume 9? why is it US the place where the show is made gets it after UK?,1342224000,8,189,3.5238095238095237
4603607,1,B0058YPMHO,"I loved the earlier seasons of Family Guy...but something about this Volume left me disappointed.

The Writers are obviously running out of ideas, so they are re-using previous storylines. In earlier seasons, Lois becomes a Karate Champion. In this season, she becomes a Boxing Champion. In earlier seasons, Meg becomes romantically-obsessed with Brian. In this season, she becomes romantically-obsessed with Joe. Why didn't the Writers try something different and make Peter do boxing or get Chris to become obsessed with Bonnie? At least that wouldn't be similar to what they have already done. They played it too safe.

Also, the original joke of Peter injuring his knee and lying on the ground in pain sighing for an uncomfortably long time was funny in the first few seasons...but similar gags just seem like the Writers were low on material, so they put in a long, awkward gag to fill-out time. The ""fight"" between Herbert and the Nazi is excruciating...not funny.

Plus, I found the Christmas Special Episode bizarre. The gory way in which Brian and Stewie hack up a husband on Xmas Eve and orphan his child would be funny if it was a brief gag. I am no prude, but they drag it out to a five minute realistic torture-spree that drags on too long and isn't funny anymore...but depressing! And I know most Family Guy episodes don't make sense, but this episode's final moral is ""Christmas would be better if everyone only got one Gift each""? Huh? And another episode has a horrible moral that ""Paraplegics should try and learn to walk, and then their wife won't cheat on them""!!

Something about this season was definately off-putting. I actually prefer American Dad now, because the Writers make stories that are fun and carefree...not bloody and trying to ""gross-out"" the audience like Family Guy.",1336348800,20,1804,4.9243421052631575
4603608,5,B0058YPMHO,"This Family Guy DVD is great!  My family has every Season and watch them all the time.  I have purchased most of them from Amazon every Holiday Season.  They always arrive as described, and right on time!",1334966400,,204,4.45945945945946
4603609,4,B0058YPMHO,"Family Guy volume 9 had some good episodes and some that were just awful. I haven't found an official episode list yet but I would imagine that 13 or 14 episodes will be on the Volume 10 DVD set. Volume 9 ended at ""Welcome Back Carter"" so here are the subseqeunt 14 episodes. This would wrap up the season 9 from 2010-2011 not including ""Its a Trap"" which was released in 2010.

UNOFFICIAL List:

""Halloween on Spooner Street"" 4/5
""Baby, You Knock Me Out""
""Brian Writes a Bestseller"" 3.5/5
""Road to the North Pole""  4/5
""New Kidney in Town"" 3.5/5
""And I'm Joyce Kinney""  2/5
""Friends of Peter G.""
""German Guy""  3/5
""The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair""  3/5
""Trading Places""  4/5
""Tiegs for Two""  2/5
""Brothers & Sisters"" 4.5/5
""The Big Bang Theory""  4.5/5
""Foreign Affairs"" 4.5/5

I haven't seen every episode on this list but there do appear to be a few more good ones than Volume 9 had. Trading Places, Brothers and Sisters, The Big Bang Theory and Foreign Affairs were all quite funny. Road to the North Pole was a pretty good episode as well. I am a bit disappointed in finding out that other countries have already had this set released but the country in which the show is made hasn't even gotten a release date yet.",1327795200,9,1222,4.463963963963964
4603610,3,B0058YPMHO,"Quality-wise, this three-disc collection, already out in the UK, is a very mixed bag. The only true candidate for classic status among these 14 epsiodes (the remainder of Season Nine) is Brian Writes a Best-Seller, a brilliant comeuppance for the more than usually full-of-himself pooch. The rest are uneven. True, Halloween on Spooner Street has moments, Road to the North Pole improves on re-acquaintance -- as usual, the DVD episodes are raunchier than the broadcast versions -- and it's rare that you'll go all the way through an episode without one clever bit (like Patrick Warburton's linebacker-like version of the American Dad theme in the finale Foreign Affairs). But too many of the later ones come off like filler. For instance, the fight sequence in German Guy far exceeds its comedic life, while the full Jagger/Bowie Dancing in the Street video in Foreign Affairs is time-marking pure and simple. The extras provide some relief: outtakes from 13 episodes, select-scene animatics for two, the cross-promotional Beer Walk episode from The Cleveland Show (S2E9) and, when used on a DVD-ROM equipped PC, 15 clips, five clip mashups and nine songs (all exportable). And at least subsequent DVD releases should finally get back to a convenient seasonal basis for the first time since Vol. 2. But, overall, this represents a distinct drop-off in quality -- one that would continue into Season 10.",1326844800,19,1403,5.131004366812227
4603671,5,B0058YPMHO,"I'm essentially going to just copy and paste the same review I wrote for season 9 in here, with one difference, this is the season with the multiverse episode, or was it two episodes?  Anyway that makes it even better than season 9.  Here is the rest of the review.

I try to buy every season of Family Guy, I've slacked off recently because its now on Netflix, but its a great show to pop into the dvd player when you need something light hearted and funny.  I can't say that this season was any better or worse than the rest, but its Family Guy, lets face it they are all pretty good.",1473638400,,586,4.15929203539823

4603675,3,B0058YPMHO,"Some good comedy here, but some lame episodes. ""Road To The North Pole"" is ugly, crude and quite sickening. It's such an anti Christmas message with the worst songs ever presented on Family Guy. The worst. You'll need a toothbrush to scrub your memory. Some of the highlights are ""Tiegs For Two"", ""Halloween on Spooner Street"", ""German Guy"".  An OK season overall, in spite of the Christmas Crater featuring Seth Macfarlane's incontinent Pothead father.",1457827200,,453,5.121621621621622

4604044,5,B0058YPMHO,I will not give this release of family guy a one star rating because it doesn't deserve it. It's five stars all the way. The amazon image will get a one star rating though. Best buy had this volume on sale for cheaper but only had the version without the sleeve artwork. So I ordered it here for a few more bucks. To me it was well worth it because my other volumes all have the sleeve and I wanted to keep it that way. To my surprise when this arrived it didn't have one. I feel misled by amazon and am now stuck with one volume that doesn't have a sleeve. To some I'm sure it's not a big deal but it annoys me. On a side note I also ordered volume 11 and that did come with a sleeve. That almost annoys me more. Either way I'm not happy and will be going to big box retailers from now on for certain items.,1386547200,,808,3.903030303030303

This review is based on the way the item arrived, and does not reflect the season of the show ""Family Guy"" whatsoever.
As a collector I was happy to see this item on discount for the holidays.
Once the package arrived, I was quickly distraught that the DVD was only delivered with the standard DVD casing, without the SLEEVE as advertised. :(
Buyer's be warned. If you're picky about your cover art, the sleeve may be missing when it arrives to you.

In the one I received had no such sleeve, it was just the plastic case (very thin plastic) and the paper cover inside (the one with the flames)
Had the hard paper sleeve been included, as i assume its part of the packaging (an unboxing video on youtube showed the hard paper sleeve) perhaps the plastic case would not have been damaged in shipping.
An object of some sort punctured the back, It was bad enough to tear the inside paper but the disc itself was not damaged.
So I'll let it slide and keep it.
It's just that what I receive should be what is pictured",1383955200,8,798,4.256578947368421

4604103,5,B0058YPMHO,"I liked it, I think this series over time has not lost its luster. Highly recommended. My comments are short, but Family Guy needs no introduction. It's irreverent, and makes even the most bitter laugh.",1378166400,,202,4.8

4604107,3,B0058YPMHO,"I'm a long time fan of Family Guy, but in these past few seasons, the jokes are just not funny.  The cutaways, which I usually enjoy, seem to be more of a way for the writers/artists to fill time instead of make a joke.  Like when Peter finds out that Brian is dating Quagmire's old flame, there is a long cutaway after this that is just...not funny at all.  They spent a lot of time on an ""epic"" battle between Herbert the Pervert and the old Nazi.  It was apparently supposed to be really funny, but not funny at all (ok, when they stopped to take their pills...that was funny but the rest was just long and drawn out).
I miss the slapstick comedy and anachronistic and physical humor.  I don't like the religious jokes, taking God's name in vain, or mocking Jesus.  Take that out, and I'll consider watching the next season.  Bring back the funny jokes that made so many fans fall in love with this dysfunctional family.",1371772800,,923,4.394117647058824

4604161,3,B0058YPMHO,"I guess it is buyer beware when purchasing a used item (especially a DVD or electronic), however I feel I was duped into believing the item would be slightly used, as described. It was torn on the outside cover as well as on the inside title page, parts were taped over. DVD seems to play well so far, but I have not explored it fully yet.",1364256000,,339,4.151515151515151
4604162,2,B0058YPMHO,"Here;s the simple truth. The show went downhill after Season 8. what happened? The episode BRIAN AND STEWIE, that is what happened. It divided the series into those who found the realistic writing and depressing nature of that unique episode combined with a truly (for FOX) offensive scene in which Brian eats Stewie's Poop--""soured"" the network form letting them ""go too far"" anymore. No more drug episodes, no more ethnic humlor, no more religious mocks. No more anything too controversial.  So what could they do...right---what we get here.  A bland mess of shows, mostly awful with little edge or point. Brian Writes a Best Seller is the best of the lot, along with the Christmas Episode..but there's not much more of interest or comedy. Most episodes are awful in this lot. When you reach a point that turns off 50% of your audience 'when you cross the line"" as in Brian and Stewie, we get to this stage. South Park reached the same problem after the ""Muhammad"" (in a bear suit) episode where Comedy Central forced them to NEVER air episode 200 again UNCUT. So this is what we have come to  unwatchable episodes like ""German Guy"". When this set is under 3.00 let me know...worth 1.00 a disc.",1363478400,2,1196,4.712918660287081
4604163,3,B0058YPMHO,"Like a lot of people reading this I own all 10 volumes of the Family Guy Series.  There aren't many shows that can make it this long and not suffer degradation over time.  This run feels like the producers didn't give it their whole effort.

There are a lack of commentaries which is frustrating given that the Simpsons gives full length commentaries on every episode.  The special features where a little weak.  The Adam West footage of him getting a star on the walkm of fame just seems like pandering.

The deleted scenes were few and far between and weren't all that funny or long.  Overall this is a buy if you have the first nine but an avoid if you are looking to find a Family Guy season to watch.",1362787200,,705,4.33587786259542

This was the first time we ordered any movies from Amazon and after the experience we had we will be ordering more discs in the future without any hesitation.,1350172800,,284,4.377358490566038
4604398,3,B0058YPMHO,"Family Guy used to be very funny without many horrific scenes, making fun of things without being too offensive. But I have noticed that the quality of the gags has really dropped off recently. They concentrate more on violent, bloody scenes, sexual scenes, and it is really hard to watch. Price is also an issue, and as other customers have said, their extra episodes (DVD only) is just stupid stuff that nobody want to watch. So I would recommend another series, unless they really make a big change to the personnel and Family Guy becomes great gain. Again, this DVD set is still pretty good and will give you a good laugh if you are watching the series for the first time. However, don't expect it to be as great as it was before.",1350000000,,734,4.485074626865671
4604498,4,B0058YPMHO,My boyfriend and I enjoyed a weekend at home watching this.  We had a 3 extended laugh out loud moments that made us very happy.,1349740800,,128,4.12
4604499,5,B0058YPMHO,"I enjoyed every episode(My favorite being ""Tea Peter"" and ""Mr. and Mrs. Stewie) Any fan of family guy will enjoy this season, even at an Okay price for every episode in the the season. I easily recommend this to anybody!",1349654400,,220,4.525
4604500,1,B0058YPMHO,To constantly release 12 to 13 episodes each year has become the biggest joke on Family Guy I mean look at the amazon rankings they used to be in the top 5 every time but people have become sick and tired of the greed and stupidity.  The real fans are the ones that lose out they have to wait another year just to get episodes that aired last season always over a year behind.  Just catch up and release full Seasons even if it costs a bit more the fans would appreciate it.,1349308800,5,474,4.086021505376344
4604501,3,B0058YPMHO,"Just to be clear to everyone, this is NOT SEASON 10.  This is the remaining episodes from season 9.
The product description does not even state it as such either.  Every place I have looked up shows season 10 with this cover but this is not the case.  I rate this 3 stars due to this set not even mentioning air dates or any mention of it being season 9 episodes, not to mention how much space is filled with ""junk"" bonus material.

4604502,5,B0058YPMHO,I am a big family guy fan and this dvd did not dissapoint me i got it the other day and love every episode on it my only complaint is that they come in volumes not full seasons,1349136000,,176,3.6578947368421053
4604503,4,B0058YPMHO,"Show is still awesonme, although some gags go too long and im really starting to dislike brian! And Jim, why did u rate this 2 stars? Its not even your rating for this product!! GREAT SEASON. its FAR better than the simpsons, which quit being funny a decade ago",1348963200,,261,4.346938775510204
4604504,4,B0058YPMHO,"I have been a fan of the show since it's debut in 1999.

The last couple of seasons have been hit and miss.  Yet, the show has NOT gotten as bad as ""The Simpsons"" have in their last few seasons.  You can still have some laughs with ""Family Guy"".

But, yet, the laughs have been fewer in the last couple of seasons.

Course, when the show will NOT release by seasons, but by volumes.

This one starts on a Halloween episode & ON SAME DISC THAT HAS ONLY 5 EPISODES HAS THE CHRISTMAS EPISODE.  Meaning how few episodes we get in a season.

""Road to the North Pole"" is a longer episode.

We get episodes uncut here so NOT for kids.

The extras are decent.  For you ""Batman"" & Adam West fans you get to see him receive his star of the Walk of Fame.

Poor plastic case.  You do NOT get air dates or episodes or explanations of episodes, just the terrible plastic case & you have to remove disc 3 to see list of episodes.

So, decent season, not outstanding.  Poor plastic DVD case.",1348876800,6,975,4.166666666666667

4604506,1,B0058YPMHO,"If anyone noticed there has been a mistake. The instant video that can be purchased on Amazon on this page is not Season 10. The description of Season 10 mentions 14 episodes and the Instant video is way more than that. If you plan on purchasing Instant video for certain shows DO NOT do it through Amazon.

Season 10 episode list as such.

4604507,5,B0058YPMHO,"I notice that a lot of the complaints with this and the other later seasons are pretty much that the show is different compared to when it started. so what? the show evolved, fairly well I might add. every character started changing over time so that they didn't become stale or boring. Another complaint is that the show is too offensive now, and takes things too far. then don't watch. seriously, cause if you can't take jokes, then you shouldn't watch this show. The at times gets darker. again, so what? Family Guy has always been the type of show to make any kind of jokes and statements they want to.
Episodes like road to the north pole and road to the pilot have elements of the old character types and the new. the foxy boxing rocky parody episode showcase how well the guys at family guy can parody the classics. Every episode is full of great jokes and should be a treat for any Family Guy fan.",1348790400,,905,4.392857142857143
