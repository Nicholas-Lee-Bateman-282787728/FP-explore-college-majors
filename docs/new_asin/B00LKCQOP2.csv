6488781,5,B00LKCQOP2,"This movie is wonderful and great for the whole family!  It's hard to see the girls be so mean to others at the beginning, but they learn what love through God's eyes is really like.  The girl who portrays Grace is an incredible actress!!!  She is so beautiful and when she talked about Jesus and His love and forgiveness it brought tears to our eyes.  ""Jesus forgave me, so of course i forgive you!"" This movie remind you of what really matters and you see how people who may not be loved by the world are beloved and beautiful and wonderful through God's eyes!!!",1525651200,,564,4.394230769230769
6488782,5,B00LKCQOP2,"I loved this film. For me it was a tear jerker, but not at all hokey. For those that criticize the acting as slow or stiff, think a little deeper. Think of the message beneath the movie. I read that Amber House (the girl that played Grace in the movie), who really is a beautiful young woman with Down syndrome, was asked to her senior prom by a really gallant lad who said she was just fun to hang with. That really moved me, as did the movie, which I felt deserved more than five stars and was not at all preachy.",1525132800,,515,4.0588235294117645

6488784,5,B00LKCQOP2,"It certainly wasn't a top quality production by Hollywood standards, but it was a great message and very touching.

6488843,4,B00LKCQOP2,"Overall, the movie had a good plot.  Spoiler alert:  However, the end wasn't right.  The main female character was blamed for the prank done to Grace, even though she knew nothing about it, and didn't find out until it was happening.  She even tried to stop it.  However, she was still blamed by everyone and put in a position where everyone had to forgive her, even though she had done nothing wrong.  It just didn't fit with the movie, and I found it quite sad that she had to be forgiven for something she didn't do.",1492646400,,519,4.354166666666667

I think this movie had a good theme and a message that is needed in our society today. We need to see people as they truly are and not how we think they should be. This movie teaches us what forgiveness, true friendship and beauty is. I was touched by this movie and I hope all who watch it come away with a lesson of love and tolerance to others. Good movie and would definitely watch again. I'm giving it five stars because we need more movies that teach us things our hearts may forget and what love truly is.",1485993600,,674,4.232558139534884

Hopefully enough young and older people view this to become sensitized to the bullying and those individuals who have Down syndrome.

I liked the example of how forgiveness was shown/given. When viewed through a Christians eyes, Grace is a gift from God; it is unmerited; meaning it is undeserved. God's Grace touched each person in the film. I liked how the author (I'm assuming this is a book) gave the Grace (the person) the name. Grace, the person also was a gift to those around her who were receptive enough to see.

I myself was heavy with glasses so I think I felt for kids that were different I am 57 kids were mean. But kids today are worse and with the media they are blasted with meanness.

Bully vandal teenagers cast as 'privileged' small town elite or parents unaware, prejudiced, enabling, and promoting discrimination and cruelty?  Whatever redemption and self discovery and change follows this horrendous LONG start --- why stick with this or care? Bottom line:  These smugly cruel people are not people you would choose to emulate, to follow, or to have your children associate with [or hear, with their name calling] from the outset (The Before).  So why stick with The Loathesome Before, ostensibly hoping for the necessary promised redemptive Afterwards?  Cara may learn life lessons but this movie begins unsubtly, and sadly too long reflecting teenagers as sheep (except for Brandon) and a mother whose vision is limited.  WANTING TO CHANGE is one of the messages as a predicate for change.  Well intentioned but too much that is bad is tolerated as predicate for lessons about good, right, and kindness for too long.  A+++++++++++++++ for effort and inclusiveness and trying to promote understanding.  But so very heavy handed.

6489597,4,B00LKCQOP2,"This was a very good movie with a unique plot line and an unexpected twist at the end. I liked it, and was glad to see a film about respect and care for the disabled, as well as a girl who really could be a jerk changing into a better person, like the butterflies at the end emerging from their cocoon.

HOWEVER: (The following review from here on out is a spoiler...) there was one element to this film that I found quite terrible, and that was the fact that at the end of the story, everyone acted as though the main lead character had something she needed forgiven for. It was so irritating, and sort of made the end of the story a little agitating. She had no idea about the prank that was about to be played on Grace, and only realized it at almost the last moment. She then tried to tell those who were up to no good to stop, but she was dragged away.

Yes, she could have spoke up more (screamed? Shouted?) and that was clearly not good that she did not, but given the situation, I can easily see how someone could be shocked and confused and even intimidated to do something. But the point is that it was not her idea to do the prank, and she had no idea about it until it was beginning.

Besides, what of the others there? It was a homecoming dance, so I am sure there were teachers and other adults there. Yet NO ONE else spoke up to stop the laughing? And what of the DJ? He could have cranked up some music and put a stop to it. Or all the kids that laughed - someone else could have yelled out for them to stop besides the one and only guy who was speaking up. So in an entire crowd of people, many of whom laughed, and absolutely NO adults who spoke up to stop it, this ONE girl is to blame - who never came up with the idea for the prank to begin with, and never laughed at Grace along with the many others who did? Really, it was a very annoying ending to watch someone almost groveling who did not do anything to cause the problem, and was not as bad as all the others who laughed and never said even one word to stop it. They were the ones who should of been begging for forgiveness much more than her.

It was therefore extremely odd that everyone acted as though she had something to be sorry for, because she was also a victim in a way (how terrible to see that done to ones friend, and then to be blamed for it) and the ones who should have been sorry and forgiven were those who came up with the idea for the prank. It really made the end seem rather confusing and aggravating to hear people telling her she was forgiven, when it was not her fault. Those who should have been asking for forgiveness were all the ones who laughed (she never laughed) and made fun of a disabled person.

But other than that, it was a unique film. Some of the acting was not that great, but it was ok enough to get through. I am glad to see such a movie made about those with disabilities, and just wish the ending would have been more fair and turned towards those who created the prank, and those who laughed at Grace, as the ones who really needed forgiveness.",1465430400,11,3066,4.1033333333333335

But I know that he's with our father and as special as he was here, he's even more special there . I also know that he no longer feels any pain and for that I will be eternally grateful .

Yes, it's a low budget film so it felt a little slow at times and didn't have top-notch-Hollywood acting...but it definitely captivated me and touched me to the point of TONS OF TEARS though it's a more hopeful movie than sad.  Also, I went to a public high school in CA and I think this was filmed in a small town in more of the Bible belt area so some might think this is an unrealistic picture of high school but I think this is pretty accurate for a small town high school.  I would definitely recommend this movie to others.",1462665600,3,650,4.225806451612903

8666300,5,B00LKCQOP2,"This is a poignant story about showing respect for the  physically and intellectually challenged.

Cara, who is new in town, befriends Grace a Downs Syndrome young girl, and she learns to care deeply for her.  They become fast friends.  However, other girls with whom Cara becomes friendly, are out to destroy the relationship, and almost succeed.  These new friends disgracefully ridicule Grace and other intellectually challenged young people.  Even Cara's mother is not particularly pleased with Cara's  friendship with Grace. However, Cara learns an important lesson about true friendship and what is important in life.  Grace is a sweet, caring, loving young woman.  This film is faith based and imparts a religious theme.

The salient feature of this film is bringing out the importance of showing respect for physically and intellectually challenged  people, and showing that they are real people with real needs who care, and love, and live, and smile, and dance, and have needs and wants, and must never, ever be called mental retards or dumb.

Amber House, who has Downs Syndrome, does an excellent job as Grace. Stacey Bradshaw puts in a very good performance as Cara.  The supporting cast is outstanding.

I enthusiastically recommend this film.",1530230400,,1257,5.22

8666306,3,B00LKCQOP2,"I had to review this movie because I wish there was somewhere in the description that this is a religiousthemed film. It personally doesn't bother me that it is a Christian film as to each his/her own, but not everyone is religious. That's also fine in itself, yet many viewers might not be able to discern that fact when watching a movie like this. Eventually, it might turn them off to the content.

I can tell within the first few minutes what kind of movie I'm watching regardless of budget (made by rich people not associated with the film industry, Christianthemed, artsy independent, etc.). However, not everybody who watches a film may be as into the art of movies as I am, so there should be a disclaimer somewhere in the synopsis if a film is of a certain production.

With that being said, I chose to watch Touched By Grace knowing it was going to be a lesson in Christianity early on. I always try to be objective regardless of my personal feelings towards the subject matter, purpose, and budget of a film. With Touched By Grace, it's a decent film overall, but suffers from stiff performances and poor editing. The message is rather forced as teenage students don't necessarily act this way. They may feel similar emotions, but this movie pushes the behavior factor too far. It's watchable, for sure, but could have been done better.",1526688000,,1347,4.65546218487395
