8492523,5,B0064EGRBM,"Chris Qualm suffers from acute agoraphobia- he cannot stand the thought of leaving his house! After his concerned sister arranges a visit from a therapist,Chris actually does begin to feel a little better, and decides to make an attempt to rejoin the outside world. Discovering he's out of coffee,Chris decides to kill two birds with one stone and take a quick trip to the store...what could go wrong? Name it!

This is a truly offbeat comedy from the mind of Mike Legge (THE DUNGEON OF DR. DRECK, BRAINDRAINERS) and one that will keep you watching, and enjoying right to the end. Chris's reactions to the people and situations he encounters on what should have been a simple trip to the store are quite funny indeed!

If you've enjoyed Mike's other films, you'll love this one. If you've never seen his work, I think you'll be surprised by the freshness of his ideas.

COFFEE RUN...it's good to the last drop!",1348790400,,910,4.710691823899371
8492524,4,B0064EGRBM,"Michael Legge has been making films for over 30 years, and his best work has always been based on broad comic themes combined with a keen satirical edge. ""Coffee Run"" remains true to this past; its core focus is on an average Joe who is convinced that everyone outside his home is crazy. After getting some questionable help with his agoraphobia issue, he ventures out to test his newfound confidence... and runs into crazy situation after crazy situation! Borrowing from past movie characters and themes, there are laughs for everyone in this movie. I have my copy, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants, or needs. a good laugh!",1325635200,,628,4.770642201834862
8492525,5,B0064EGRBM,"Michael Legge is one of the few comedic geniuses in the world of micro budget cinema. In his latest endeavor he uses the simplest of plot devices to give us a greatest hits movie. Chris Qualm has agoraphobia and refuses to go outside. He figures that it's safer and the world is crazy and has nothing to offer. Then he undergoes a new form of therapy and decides it's time to make...a coffee run.
Unfortunately, he was right all along as he is plunged into a world of androids, secret agents, Venusians and much, much more.
Coffee Run works as both an individual film and a film for his numerous fans. There are characters from many of his films mashed together into one plot for our enjoyment. It's like Kevin Smith's Askewniverse only it's good.
Just beware that once you get Coffee Run it will send you down the slippery slope of getting all of his movies.
You have been warned!
Enjoy!",1325635200,,888,4.487654320987654
