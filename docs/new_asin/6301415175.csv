7811609,4,6301415175,"I must disagree with my South African colleague who writes that Flair and Steamboat were ""45 year old men with injuries"".  First, neither man was 45 in 1989, they were not even on the cusp of 40 yet.  Also, neither one was injured.  Flair has been renowned for not getting serious injuries, and his only real injury outside of the plane crash in '75 was his shoulder surgery in '99.  The NWA at the time was being carried by Flair as the headliner, despite management's attempts to phase him down.  Simply put, Flair WAS the NWA in 1989.  The end of this tape confirms it, as Flair was already being set up for another main event feud.  Sting was being groomed for headliner status, as shown in Clash of the Champions I, but even in his ""Crow"" days in the late 90's, he never really was a great headliner, despite his popularity.

Lex Luger was pushed down everyone's throats because the NWA had no big musclemen, they were all in the WWF, but despite pushing him against Sting, Luger never could carry it as a headliner.  One look at the huge push the WWF gave him in '93 confirms this.  Luger was thought of by the newsstand magazines as the ""next big thing"", but failed to live up to that promise.  He just never had the charisma or skills, despite being placed with Flair in the Four Horsemen and then against Flair, in the hopes that he could ""learn from the master"", so to speak, and that maybe some of Fair's considerable skill would rub off on him.  However, that never materialized.  Even when Luger had the WCW Champonship, it was basically a flop of a title reign.  Same for his WWF reign, which is why he was stipulated to ""never get another title shot"" at then-Champ Yokozuna.  Luger had good delivery, with a nice, well thought out articulate promos, which was a nice change during the ""LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING"" screaming promos that were an 80's staple, but he never really could carry it in the ring, and was thought of as kind of a big lumbering clod.  However, his body got him by in wrestling for so long.

As far as Barry Windham goes, while I personally liked him, and he had skill, Windham was never going to be a headliner.  Good wrestler, but ""always the bridesmaid, never the bride"".  Good U.S. Champion, but truthfully, even when he battled Luger for the belt after Flair walked out of the company, he was never going to headline for the company, presumably due to a lack of charisma.  To imply the NWA in 1989 was all about Windham is inaccurate to the extreme.  He had as much of a shot at headlining as Magnum T.A., another guy with decent skills, but nothing really that stood out from the pack, other than his resemblence to Tom Selleck.  If Magnum wrestled in any other era than the 80's, when Magnum aired, he probably wouldn't have gotten as far as he did.

Bottom line, 1989 WAS Ric Flair.  Period.  His feuds with Steamboat are legendary, and are still some of the most sought after matches by collectors, over ten years later.",1111276800,4,2965,4.456400742115028
