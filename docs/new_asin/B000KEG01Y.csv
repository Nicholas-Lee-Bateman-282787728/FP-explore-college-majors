8155820,3,B000KEG01Y,"I thought it would play one his shows. It only played bits of his acts, and was only 30 minutes long. I also have Terry Fator's show from the Mirage, which I thought was excellent, because it was the entire show. Is there a Danny Gan's video of one of his entire shows? They must have that at the Mirage.",1361577600,,304,4.083333333333333
8155821,5,B000KEG01Y,"over ten years ago i worked in dannys showroom and the first night i remember all too well...i was up on the balcony when i heard the music from phantom coming from the curtains and checked out what has got to be the best version of it...i was over in youtube and came across a song that he introduced into his show--TRAIN--drops of jupiter and though it wasn't part of his ""normal"" material/audience i remeber the audience was overwhelmingly receptive to it...working in his showroom has got to be the biggest honour one could have--i was very impressed with danny and not just about his show but about the man...his memory will live on specially now that i found that version of TRAIN...and all his work was great...i wonder what happened to Dannys Angels--it still makes me smile when he'd introduce his band and they'd strike their poses...hopefully there will be more dvds since i didn't get one when i worked there--and unfortunately 400.00 is a bit rich for my blood right now...but whoever does get the DVDs you won't be dissappointed--remember there was so much more to the man...",1336435200,2,1089,4.7368421052631575
8155822,5,B000KEG01Y,This is a totally delightful video which was enjoyed immensely.  He was such a very talented performer.  You laugh from the start to the finish.,1331510400,,144,4.72
8155823,5,B000KEG01Y,DANNY GANS WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST THERE EVER WAS. This dvd is only a short excerpt of a full on concert but you spot the enormous talent right away. I believe the family will be putting out a full-on dvd concert. Read his book and you'll see how God had other' plans for this man who dreamed of being a baseball player. Danny signed a 150 million dollar contract in 2000.......just to give you an idea of how priceless Vegas saw him...Steve Wynn gave him his own theatre inside the beautiful Mirage....one of my favourite casino/hotels. Its amazing to have lost him so young and vital. Hes in complete joy with the Lord now.............only God knows why the visit was so brief. Lucky are those who saw him 'live'. What a Talent. There will never be another like him.......chris,1323820800,3,779,4.571428571428571
8155824,3,B000KEG01Y,"The Danny Gans video is excellent so far as it goes.  I didn't notice that the length of the presentation would be so short before purchasing it.  If I had, I might have thought twice before the purchase. The content on the whole was entertaining though and I did
enjoy it in spite of the brevity.",1268524800,,297,4.285714285714286
8155825,5,B000KEG01Y,"There will never be another Danny Gans.  God graced us when she created this miracle we all know as Danny Gans.  Between DG and Merv Griffin and Carrot Top and Sammy, Jr., that's 99.9% of the world's talent.  The other .01% of talent comes from that delightful zookeeper from Columbus, Ohio; I think that guy is a real hoot!  If heaven has a casino, Danny is up there headlining right now.  Danny is to sing and dance what Fred Funk is to chip and putt.  I just wish I had this VHS in a DVD, but...whatever...it is what it is.  If there's a knock on Danny Gans, it's his name, Danny Gans.  I mean, it doesn't really have much of a ring to it, no pizazz to the name, Danny Gans.  He should have given himself a stage name like Joey Voices and Johnny Counterfeit did.  How about ""Danny Impressions"" or ""I.B. Singin"" or ""Ima Performer""(even though I think Ima might be a girl's name)?  Can you imagine the kind of success Danny would have had with one of those names?  He probably would have been the world's most famous person right in front of Obama and Tiger.  I can't believe I was lucky enough to buy this VHS after Danny passed this world.  It will forever be with me.  I wish we could go higher than five stars in our review because I would give Danny a Buzz Lightyear(to infinity and beyond).  One day, if I'm lucky enough to gain entry through the pearly gates, I will gladly pay what some consider an exorbitant fee to see Danny Gans.  And if there's a way to make money in heaven, I will get a job and go back night after night.  I love Danny Gans!",1259971200,,1556,4.216949152542373
8155826,5,B000KEG01Y,My husband and I have seen Danny Gans twice at the Mirage in Vegas and we haved thoroughly enjoyed him each time.  He is an amazing impersonator and has an incredibly wonderful voice.  I'm hoping this multi-talented entertainer will record another DVD!!,1207872000,4,253,5.0
