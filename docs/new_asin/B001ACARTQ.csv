8463267,5,B001ACARTQ,"The 9 or so intervals are at ""steady state"" which is ""medium hard"" but the last six also include a 30 second or 15 second max sprint at the end. After getting my HR up with the steady state part of the intervals, the max sprints kicked my butt! This is a weakness of mine, so I got a lot out of the workout!",1517270400,,307,3.8125
8463268,4,B001ACARTQ,"Like all of the Carmichael videos, this is a solid workout that helps build climbing stamina.  Not quite as intense as Cycling for Cadence, but solid nonetheless.",1394755200,,162,5.0
8463269,5,B001ACARTQ,"I like intervals and this routine has intervals within the intervals.  You can concentrate on incorporating your full peddle stroke to work on cadence and power, alternating between the two.  The duration of the segments is not too long that you fatigue.  Go Blue!",1363564800,,264,4.954545454545454
8463270,5,B001ACARTQ,All the CTS videos are great! Especially when it is too cold to ride outside. These videos are my go to work outs any time.,1358553600,,123,3.96
8463271,3,B001ACARTQ,"Good DVD that provides structured interval training for hills. While nothing you can do at home can simulate the real deal, the interval part of training does help keep your riding foundation in place. I felt the high-intensity parts of the intervals could be a longer time duration.
Chris is bit over ""chatty"" while the the training takes place - I understand he's there to provide guidance and motivation, but it sure would be nice to back him down one level or so with the talking.",1318291200,,484,4.6395348837209305
