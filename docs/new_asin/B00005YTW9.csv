7957025,5,B00005YTW9,"Love Salsa and saw this video many years ago while I was learning. I'm so glad it was still available. This couple does an amazing job of explaining the moves and they're easy to follow. My only complaint about the video is that they sometimes go TOO much into detail about some of the simpler moves, but, that's just because I'm not a beginner anymore, and I'm sure that those who are just starting out will find that part useful....and for all my complaining, I simply clicked the FF button.",1410393600,,493,4.488888888888889
7957026,1,B00005YTW9,"I am very disappointed. Ordered 2 DVDs with beginner and intermediate lessons. I was looking specifically for NY salsa with break on 2, however this one isn't NY salsa as it says in the description.",1354406400,,198,4.685714285714286
7957027,5,B00005YTW9,this couple has done a good job of teaching fancy salsa moves.  as usual they are good teachers as what they did with their hustle video dance lessons. you can never go wrong with getting this video.,1314230400,,199,4.378378378378378
7957028,4,B00005YTW9,But this D V D  must have contained lot of popular Salsa songs as well,1189382400,,70,3.6666666666666665
7957029,1,B00005YTW9,This DVD is hard to follow.  The instructions are not precise and they do not provide step by step instructions.  Why would you want to rewind to keep following the instructions...A Waste!,1128211200,,188,4.84375
7957030,4,B00005YTW9,"I was able to learn all the moves on this video at home, after watching the Red Hot Salsa beginner's tape, and taking classes in a studio. Ron gets quite tongue tied and doesn't do a great job explaining the moves, but you can watch and rewind until you get it. All the moves are shown very well, more than once, from multiple angles.",1106697600,,334,4.234375
7957031,2,B00005YTW9,"This video is too much basic and boring. There are only four or five steps in this video and the steps are very basic and not funny. There are a lot of better videos than this, so if you don't wanna waste your money don't buy this video.",1039132800,2,237,3.9583333333333335
7957032,4,B00005YTW9,"This DVD follows the same pattern as their Beginners DVD video with very smooth flowing combinations taught in detail & in all directions.
This DVD video starts out with an On 2 demo then a curved basic with a shine. This is used to explain On 2 NY rhythm Salsa dancing.
One of the key points of this DVD video is the turn combination that teaches you how to combine basic shines ( solo steps ) into your couple dancing. This DVD video is a good intro into couple shine dancing.
This DVD video contains few steps & combinations but is very detailed. The teaching style is slow & includes all directions & includes some nice styling. A practical breakdown of the steps is given. Then On 2 count of the steps is given as well as a music On 2 demo of all steps.
This is an easy-to-learn NY Salsa DVD video. This teaching style is great for dancers without partners to train with.
Most of the key points for their first DVD video also apply to this DVD video. They teach a very smooth flowing Salsa. They give you options for all the combinations. Overall a nice DVD video with some very well known steps.",1025827200,15,1101,4.323671497584541
