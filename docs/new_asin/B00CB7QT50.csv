5711130,4,B00CB7QT50,"Being a big Tom & Jerry fan, I actually already had all the cartoons in the set from various other DVD's.  I do like that WB mixes the classic-era T & J shorts (including a couple from the oft-overlooked Chuck Jones period) with the new.  The Tom & Jerry Tales episode ""The Cat Nebula"" is certainly one of the strangest cartoons in the duo's long history. . .and it's all the more entertaining for it.

At just under an hour, this is nice way to get your fix of space-themed cartoons featuring everyone's favorite cat and mouse team.  But with so much of their output readily available already, true fans will probably want to seek out the complete collections.",1370908800,,661,4.529411764705882
