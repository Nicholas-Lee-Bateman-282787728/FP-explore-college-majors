I wish our whole country and all of Europe could see this documentary now.  Malignant Narcissistic Personality Disorder is a dangerous psychic cancer that destroys all those who listen and are infected by those who bear this wound.  It is catastrophic when a national leader exhibits these behaviors.  Those who were persecuted found a way to survive through the arts, through music, and through the grace and dignity of learning what it means to be a wise human being, homo sapiens.  This film is profoundly moving and may help people to awaken.",1488067200,,671,4.8

8322213,5,B001MVYUY8,"I appreciate this kind of documentary, beause it shows how some persons work for the peace in the world: that is conforting. I admire very much Alice Herz-Sommer, who in spite all the sufferings she had to endure in a concentration camp during the last world war, because she was Jewess, harbours no feeling of hatred against no one! She is an example.",1371859200,9,352,4.603174603174603
8322214,5,B001MVYUY8,"This is a DVD about Wagner, his music and his history of virulent anti-semitism.  What makes this wonderfully made DVD so interesting is the fact that many scholars, musicians, talking heads weigh in on their personal stand on Wagner and his music.  Some find his legacy repugnant, and others manage to put the anti-semitism aside.  The viewer is left having to decide for themselves.  This DVD is well worth anyone's time and money.  If you visit the website of Allegro .com, you can find out more about the making of the film.",1345420800,12,528,4.695652173913044
8322215,5,B001MVYUY8,Well presented and fairly balanced. This is difficult material to discuss emotionally and the participants are knowledgeable and forthright. Well worth watching.,1268956800,8,161,6.363636363636363
8322216,4,B001MVYUY8,"This documentary film provides an excellent exposition of how music by several jewish composers, and some non-jewish, influenced the thinking of the German people.  The doc shows with brevity but illuminating clarity, what these composers and their music meant to Germans in a positive and uplifting way prior to the ascension of the Nazis.  The film then moves inexorably forward to the rise of Nazism and how this music could be manipulated by this brutal totalitarian regime to further their nefarious and despicable schemes including the horrors of their genocide against the Jews and others.",1265932800,11,596,5.2631578947368425
8322217,5,B001MVYUY8,"This is a masterly and comprehensive account of how the Jewish people, living in German speaking Europe, first found cultural freedom and high hopes of being totally assimilated by their host nations. Particularly in Music they became pre-eminent, from Felix Mendelssohn, through Meyerbeer to Mahler, Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School. These hopes perished in the Shoah and it was MUSIC, which the survivors interviewed in this Film claim,  gave them the courage and strength to survive in the Death Camps.",1179100800,5,514,5.345679012345679
8322218,3,B001MVYUY8,"An interesting DVD on the cultural origin of Nazism, going back to the dominance of Prussia, the Protestents and hence modern Germany. It touches upon Mendelssohn focussing on Wagner, ending on Mahler and Schoenberg.

In this film, some of the survivors of the concentration camp-- mostly musicians including a 98 years old lady pianist ( how she reminds me of Horszowski), a violinist and a cellist etc-- talk about their horrifying experience while the screen flashes back onto some pictures of gas chamber rooms full of naked dead bodies of both genders...

The survivors are of course highly cultivated people all speaking very cultured German, with quite a proportion of them changed to and fro into English without noticing it, and neither would the audience as their English are literally perfect. And not withstanding their culture and gracefulness, the imports, however down played, would nonetheless make your hair raise.

And yes, we also have Zukerman telling us about the Jewish way of living, things like they have more music than eating even in a feast! Barenboim expressed his deep distaste for Nazism and  Ashkennazy rather mechanically (& I prefer Karajan on this score) conducted a German orchestra, with Kissin playing a piece by Brahms. This is by far more a documentary than a musical production and Nupen is, as usual, a great narrator.",1149379200,16,1359,5.0807174887892375
8322219,5,B001MVYUY8,"In the last 60 years we have been watching lot of documents about the effects of the nazi regime that governed Germany in the years just before the World War II. Between the most disappointing things we have to mention the jewish repression and extermination, that took place in different cities of Germany and those countries they conquest, like Poland specially.

This documentary tries to review not only the jew extermination and killing in central Europe but the repression of another minor groups of different ethnic origin, like those who came from the countries under German power or the artists and intellectuals whom were part of Nazis targets.

A very interesting thing in this DVD is the revision of Wagner's works and ideas about the jews, something that creates always a great debate and that it's very well focused here from different points of view. Probably this is the most interesting thing from the point of view of history and musicology  in the DVD. From the point of view of the confidences of the human beings who knew the Nazi repression the DVD is a jewel, because it offers the interviews with people who experimented the concentration camps for a long time, in which they took notice of quite all that happened to them. They talk about the musical life during that period, something that always takes our attention in a kind of situation like that. Kissin, Barenboim, Mehta and meny other musicians, most of them jew or with very deep relation with Israel or the jew community, talk in this DVD, much more than playing music. This is a DVD for listening people to talk about some of the most dark days of our history, some of the most disappointing chapters of the last century.

Like all the Nupen's films, the quality is very high in all the aspects; the script is great, the interviews very well done, searching for important replies and letting the survivers to talk, the film edition is really fantastic, like the images they have from archives and from nowadays. Sound is very good too and the general impression is that of being watching a very sensitive and well done documentary about people and fear, about music in that situation, but from a very humanistic point of view.

It's very important not to forget this... to know the past in order to don't repeat the mistakes we did as society.",1139270400,24,2328,4.738271604938272
