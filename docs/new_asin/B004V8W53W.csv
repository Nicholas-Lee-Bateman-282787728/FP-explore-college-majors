8443050,1,B004V8W53W,The idea of the Rex movie was a good concept but mismanaged all to hell and back.  The acting was poor and I understand the actors were ashamed but my god they could have tried.  The science was weak.  If someone with  imagination and talent had written the screenplay then actors could have let their talent soar.,1315094400,,314,4.456140350877193
