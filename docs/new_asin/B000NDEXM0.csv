8176887,5,B000NDEXM0,"This three pack is a good value and great set of Barney's.  They may not be my all time favorite Barney's, but my daughter (2 1/2) enjoys them.  We needed to buy them so we'd have DVDs for the car.  We had a nice collection of hand me down DVDs.  Barney gets a bad rap.  We love him and find him so much more enjoyable than other shows out there.  My daughter knows the words to half of his songs by heart.",1201651200,2,406,3.8902439024390243
