8551613,4,B00AHH49HQ,"I am a big fan of Essentrics workouts, and this one doesn't disappoint. I am still in the first trimester of my third pregnancy but weirdly started developing lower back pain the other day, which in my other two pregnancies hasn't shown up until well into the second trimester. I had this DVD on hand but had never actually used it (bought as part of a package on the Essentrics website), so the other day I pulled it out and gave it a shot. I have only done it a few times, but my back pain is gone. I'm sure continued use will benefit me throughout the rest of this pregnancy. Exercise is the only thing that has kept pregnancy aches and pains at bay for me in the past, and I am already a believer in the therapeutic, yet toning benefits of Essentrics, pregnant or not. So this DVD is here to stay. I don't know how the workouts manage to be so calm, gentle, relaxing, yet stimulating. It really is unique.

The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because of some minor production issues. It seems like they may only have one camera filming, so you don't always get to see different angles of the exercises, which for me wasn't a big deal because I have done several of their other DVDs and am familiar with the exercises. For someone not familiar, this may or may not be an issue. Also, sometimes Miranda and Ileana talk over each other a little. It wasn't a huge issue, though - just a slight annoyance, really. In the end, the workout was so great, those details are pretty easily overlooked. In spite of those two things, I would definitely recommend the DVD.",1444521600,4,1579,4.352542372881356
8551614,5,B00AHH49HQ,"I have used this just a couple times a week for the past three weeks and absolutely love it. I have only done the standing routine at this point in time. This is my second pregnancy in the 26th week. I was very active with my first pregnancy 5 years ago and was able to walk and do all sorts of pregnancy workouts including yoga. At my 10th week in this pregnancy I began to experience right pelvis pain that stopped me from doing any activity. At 17 weeks my OB set me up with PT and I was diagnosed with SI joint pain or pelvic girdle pain. It was very hard to even walk and my pelvis was very unstable. After 2 weeks of working with PT and learning what aggravated the joint and learning different muscles to use to walk, get in and out of bed or my car the pain was more manageable. Then I found this video. There are certain moves that I must be cautious and even just pause as to not cause SI/pelvis pain, but overall it has increased my strength in my posture. When I was crippled in pain my posture was horrible which would not help me with the carrying the baby throughout the rest of the pregnancy. My PT therapist has been working on this as well but this video has provided stretching and relaxing of muscles and strengthening of the right muscles for me to stand taller and have less pain. I hope to be able to do the deep stretches in the Barr workout and maybe be able to get to do the floor exercises but for now I am grateful for the standing routine. I feel that I would have greatly enjoyed this video even with my first pregnancy as it just works with your changing body stretching and strengthening the areas that need it most. The instructor is in her 8th month of pregnancy and is very enjoyable to watch and learn from in the moves. There is not much to the videos and the lady who started this entire program basically narrates throughout the workout but you will find she does remind you which muscles to focus on and this does in fact help tremendously. The pregnant body is different and I am grateful for this video in developing moves to help with the different changes rather than just trying to modify a regular routine.",1428969600,7,2152,4.264058679706602
8551615,5,B00AHH49HQ,"My place of business brought in an essentrics instructor for mid-day classes and I loved them! Ballet was the only form of exercise I really enjoyed and when I had a foot injury had to stop. This is the closest thing to ballet warm-ups I've found, and unlike some of the more intense programs that integrate similar steps, the exercises are gentle and less likely to cause injuries or long term damage to joints,",1377302400,6,412,4.581081081081081
