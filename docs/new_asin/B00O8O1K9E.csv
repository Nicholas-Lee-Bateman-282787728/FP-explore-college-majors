6729302,3,B00O8O1K9E,"OK, so I only watched this because of the Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner. The movie was good but not great, no fault of the actors. Sophie was very good. I hope to see Sophie in other movies soon.",1420070400,3,196,4.051282051282051

6729305,3,B00O8O1K9E,"The cast was well chosen, but the storyline became weak.",1417478400,,56,4.7
6729306,5,B00O8O1K9E,"Very nice. It worked because you so want Fey (Sophie Turner) to succeed, but at every step the bizarre haunting seems to mess her life up more and more. I also like that the film pretty clearly acknowledged it's debt (and the debt of all head-trip films of this sort) to the classic Gaslight. This was done with a lot of love, and I hope to see more of everyone involved.",1415577600,,371,4.23943661971831
6729307,4,B00O8O1K9E,"This is an interesting pyschological ""horror"" story without any horror. The best way to watch this film (as any film) is cold. Faye Fay (Sophie Turner) is a high school girl whose perfect life comes to an end when her father (Rhys Ifans) gets ill. She has bad dreams and becomes darkly introverted. There are odd impossible things happening in her life she can't explain. She gets the female lead in ""Macbeth"" and creates an antagonist in her understudy Monica ( Charlotte Vega ) who claims she got the part as a pity party due to her father dying.

About 35 minutes into the film we get an explanation of which details follow later. If you read any reviews or descriptions it might spoil that initial discovery.

The film was done well. Not a Hitchcock masterpiece, but a film that keeps you entertained even as it moves slowly as Fay discovers....",1415404800,3,849,4.6158940397351
6729308,1,B00O8O1K9E,"Turns out to be her twin who died at birth haunting her, it's really slow and nothing worth waiting for. Skip it.",1414972800,2,113,4.181818181818182
6729309,3,B00O8O1K9E,I had hoped that the Doppleganger would have been more invasive and destructive earlier in the movie.,1414713600,,101,5.0
6729310,5,B00O8O1K9E,"Beautifully constructed, photographed and acted.  Crafted with great precision and control.",1413936000,,91,7.2727272727272725
8682592,4,B00O8O1K9E,"I'm not a big fan of the movie, I love it because of Jonathan Rhys Meyers.",1529971200,,74,3.6875
8682593,2,B00O8O1K9E,"I only watched it because Sophie Turner is hot. Even still, I couldn't sit through the entire movie.",1509408000,,100,4.611111111111111
8682594,3,B00O8O1K9E,This movie was good but could have been better.,1503446400,,47,4.333333333333333
8682595,3,B00O8O1K9E,"Thin  on plot.  nothing  really  happens  till  the  end, and  even  then  I  was  bored",1495065600,,88,4.133333333333334
8682596,1,B00O8O1K9E,"Very slow! After an hour with almost another to go, I was ready to turn it off! Because I paid to see it, I decided to see it through. Bad decision. There was no thrill, no mystery, just boring. I did learn a new word though, gaslight. For that I can say the $3.99 was the cost of an added word to my vocabulary. I've used it a few times already! Oh, one star for my new word.",1473206400,,376,3.8333333333333335
8682597,3,B00O8O1K9E,"Not bad.  Good first starring effort for Sophie.  Nicely crafted.  It's not a 4 or 5 start blockbuster, but worth a watch.",1471651200,2,122,4.454545454545454
8682598,2,B00O8O1K9E,"I went into this movie with a lot of hope, but was kinda disappointed. I watched this because I enjoy Sophie Turner's acting on Game of Thrones, and wanted to see how she would be in a different environment. Well...it's pretty much the same character as Sansa. Wounded, worried, not sure how to react to what's happening. She seems like she could have a really good range as an actress, but seems typecast for her rolls. Storywise, the plot offers very little. The ""horror"" aspects are done poorly, and the (multiple!) side plots offer nothing to this film. Additionally, I feel like the ending was very rushed, and could have been done better than it was. That's not to say there was nothing good here. The camerawork was stellar in most scenes, and Sophie's acting felt very natural for someone in this position. But if you're looking for something outstanding, you're not going to find it here.",1436227200,,897,4.719745222929936
8682599,3,B00O8O1K9E,ENJOYED TO SEE HER ACT OUTSIDE OF GAME OF  THRONES. SUSPENSE MADE IT WATCHABLE.,1433548800,2,79,4.642857142857143
8682600,3,B00O8O1K9E,"You KNOW you're narcissistic when you have yourself for a stalker. This quirky little psych-thriller has a fair cast, Sophie Turner pre-Game of Thrones is a bit posh for the damaged awkward outsider but perfect for a struggling school Lady Macbeth. Rhys Afans is her ailing dad, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers is her teacher and Mom's emotional friend. Both are perfectly brilliant as always, if underused. There's a bit of drama, young love, a not-so-dead evil twin, problematic guys in hoodies, and of course high-school Shakespeare.",1433462400,,529,5.162790697674419
8682601,2,B00O8O1K9E,"No mystery, no suspense and a bunch of actors who do their best to make sense in this so predictable story. I'm Spanish and I consider Mrs. Coixet one of the very best directors that we have. This is her first intend to film a mystery movie and I'm willing to forget it considering the good memories I have from all her previous films. The main character, played by this beautiful young actress who I've learned t became popular playing a role in Game of Thrones doesn't seem to be at easy playing the victim of a series of mysterious phenomena. Claire Forlani playing her mother, has a physicality that helps her get away with her role with conviction, hard task. As for Rhys Ifans and Rhys Meyers endeavor to make the movie worth watching because of them being in it, unfortunately in not as many scenes as I would have wished.",1427846400,,829,4.4605263157894735
