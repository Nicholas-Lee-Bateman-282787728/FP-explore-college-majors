8496308,5,B006C1M4R8,"Andy Milligan is a weirdo. He's gay yet half his films were about killing people for being gay and that being ok. He had real talent but was either too lazy or under too much pressure to put it on screen. He worked in sub par conditions often cranking out horror films and stuff just off of pornography to make rent. Yet, somehow, he still managed to make some stuff that while not classically good turned out to be pretty good and in it's own way artistic.

Nightbirds is from his British phase. Milligan basically moved out of the off Broadway theater movement he helped create into film where he started out with a bang with Vapors but discovered that money was better. It meant cranking out sex and violence films for theaters where everything was sticky. He eventually got tired of the producers there and headed out to England where he was to work for the ""film clubs"" that were really places where a man could watch porno without getting thrown in jail, which the British claim to be so progressive but in reality they got a prudish side. The main attraction for Milligan is that he could make whatever he felt like instead of just another horror movie as long as a woman got naked. He doesn't make a horror film but it's definitely somewhere in the thriller mold.

Going to England seems to have gotten Andy interested in hitting the local flavor and I don't just mean his inveterate cruising. Harold Pinter ended up being the flavor he was looking for. Cryptic and creepy statements, possible ill intent, and everyone hating each other are exactly the sort of Pinterisms that Milligan would gravitate towards. He latches on and doesn't let go for the 75 minute run time. It's the best Pinter adaptation ever mostly cause Pinter wasn't involved. It also takes a form close to the play/film Sleuth. It's a 2 hander and it increases the claustrophobia and sense everything is about to go wrong. Andy even manages to get in the sex and violence to satisfy his producers.

One last bit of interest is Julie Shaw. IMDB list 4 films for her. Seems she got out quick. It's a shame cause she's got an interesting screen presence and plays her part well, which by all accounts was an impersonation of Andy himself. Despite only making 4 films, 2 of them are this and Peter Walker's The Big Switch. It's not a bad resume and she worked with 2 of the greatest b-film artists of that time, which seriously both those guys were artists.

The DVD is a steal too. It even comes with an extra Milligan movie with the Body Beneath and while it's not as good as Nightbirds it certainly has it charms. It's definitely got his hilarious costuming that is oddly affecting in a highschool play sort of way. If anything, you'll learn vampires hate America. You also get some fun essays from Nicolas Winding Refn, who between this and Pete Walker's Man of Violence DVD has done more to preserve low art cinema than anyone else, and even some people that actually knew Andy. It's a lot of material and all of it is presented well. If you're a trashy movie lover or interested in guys cranking out art as best they can on the fringes, it's a hard DVD combo pack to pass up.",1470096000,2,3155,4.510489510489511
8496309,5,B006C1M4R8,"Magnificent, ultra rare Andy Milligan film! So very dark, and wonderous! Nightbirds displays a rare side of Milligan; one in which he demonstrates excellent story telling skills and his skills as an actually very capable director. The bonus feature ""The Body Beneath"" is a joyful addition to be included for any Milligan fan. The set itself is incredibly nice! The case and artwork don't feel cheap and crummy, as some Milligan videos do. The rather thick booklet that's included is an amazing read; discussing both films, Andy Milligan himself, and Andy Milligan in London. This is a praiseworthy movie in a praiseworthy preservation of one of the most underrated filmmakers of all time!

For those wondering, YES this WILL play on a Playstation 3. I had no problem with that. No surprise, Sony don't make junk.",1427068800,4,812,4.970588235294118
