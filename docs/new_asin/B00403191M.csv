Seikichi still doesn't know that Sora is the other Sky Beast. A major confrontation brings the truth to light. Feeling betrayed, Seikichi sulks and abandons the project. Fortunately, Captain Bellybutton is able to bring him to his senses. Now, Seikichi and the other members of the row house must rescue Sora from jail; where the MIB and Akai are waiting to ambush them.

This anime is great. I've never seen one quite like this. It has so many elements that make it shine. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent. The story is in depth and lots of fun. I really like the mix of new and old. The story takes place in 1843, but there are TV's, and the internet. All the comedic references to cosplay and anime are great too.

Although this series is pretty ridiculous, there is a serious enough story in the works. The relationship between Seikichi and Sora is very cute, but rocky. I found myself wanting them to get together really bad. It's really sad how the point of the show is Seikichi building a rocket so the girl he loves can leave. It's a pretty sad concept. This series is so unique that I can't help but love it. I guess that if you're looking at this DVD, you've already seen part 1. You can trust me when I say that part 2 is better. I highly recommend it",1358553600,,1408,4.390804597701149

8411787,5,B00403191M,"It took only the first episode of this series to hook me into watching the entire thing, over just 3 days.  And it does work better watching them in rapid succession, as opposed to over 6 months.

I found this to be as good as mainstream titles like Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star, Bleach, etc., and in many respects more creative.  Using multiple styles, storylines, historical as well as science fiction elements, comedy, drama themes of good, evil, and shades in between, this chaotic soup, may, from a distance look like a total mess. But when watched from the start, is smooth and perfect storytelling.  I only found one element in the mix to be distracting, and that was the only reason I would rate this only a 9 out of 10.  As of this writing, I have already seen the entire series through 5 times.

Charles Stuckey's review states some of the show's features quite well, too.  Though most of the content of the show is safe for young audiences, this series does cover some VERY dark territory as well, as there are brutal murders and serious abuse of power in two of the story threads, and though they are presented much in the way Disney presents some of it's more horrifying encounters (Snow White's supposed heart in a box, Scar killing Simba's father, etc.), contemplation of some of the off-screen activity can be chilling.

I have yet to watch it with the English voice actors, mainly because almost all anime dubs suffer from poor acting, bad casting, atrocious false accents, and worst of all, 40-year olds trying to sound like 15-year olds.  I am very satisfied with the original voices, but, will give the dub version a try on my next watch.

Here's the best blurb for Oh! Edo Rocket, it certainly beats the one provided by the US distributor:
""This is a serio-comic combination of the legend of Princess Kaguya and the life of the fireworks maker Tamaya Seikichi. Based on a stage play, this story takes place during the Tempo Reforms (1842), where residents of Edo are forbidden to indulge in luxuries of any kind. In order to avoid trouble, our hero sneaks out of the city to test his fireworks. He manages to just avoid being caught, with the help of the motley group of rowhouse tenants he has as friends. Later when he returns home, a beautiful girl is waiting for him, and she wants him to build a very special firework... If that weren't complicated enough, special forces are engaged in a battle with monsters in the forest. And though not immediately noticeable, at least four of our players are not human.
History, drama, comedy, evil officials, secret societies, serial killings, cute girls, a beautiful man, and a very likeable and energetic boy who likes to blow things up... What else could you ask for? How about: spaceships, swing, odd super-pwers, Puffy, aliens, playboy bureaucrats, karakuri mecha, morph machines, the fourth-wall in rubble, and... a little romance... but wait, there's more!"" --D2AC",1302048000,,2933,4.755905511811024

Ratings are a guesstimate, usually on the ""safe side"".

Sub-genre: Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi

Situations: Probably PG+  Types of humor may not be suitable for children
Language:  Probably PG
Nudity:  PG  Maybe not even that much
Violence:  PG  May increase to PG+ because of second part of season one.

Language options: Dub, Sub with separate on/off option. The way it should be.

Special Features: Clean open/close. Trailers(Previews) - These are at least dubbed and make some effort at giving an idea of what the series is about. Some are for live action though, not really appropriate on an anime disc IMO.

First, contains anachronisms - on purpose. It also uses various animation styles for different characters with the ""less important"" being almost comic-strip like simple drawings, the main male character (Tamaya) being in a more ""card-game"" anime style and others being more realistic styles. Oddly this works well for this series and is unique.
It starts out as the stock ridiculous comedy, but with oddly serious scenes thrown in. Don't worry they develop smoothly into a brilliant plot line that has a blend of thought-provoking, historical and entertainment elements all while remaining a comedy-romance. Even when around episode 20 it seems the main story is over and the rest will only be filler episodes, it turns around and pulls it out with a tie-up of lose ends. It does have the requisite ridiculous comedy ending, but not as the only end with no real conclusion. Overall one of the best written animes I've seen.
The situations rating I gave it is due to jokes or inferences about things like necrophilia, homosexuality, and other ""mature"" themes. Most could probably be brushed aside as they are usually brief and implied rather than obvious.",1294099200,,1851,4.9546925566343045
