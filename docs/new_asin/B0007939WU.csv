1. Story..... None to minimal
2. Acting..... Ranges from ""They Should Be Ashamed"" to barely adequate.
3. Direction..... Called in sick.
4. Set Design..... Very nice (really!)

5. EYE-CANDY (the Male Cast)..... FABULOUS!!!  Rough-looking, humpy & hotter than fire.

Sorry folks.  Better luck next time.",1264377600,6,323,5.645833333333333
8046082,3,B0007939WU,"A brutal war is fought to protect a remote island colony from an unnamed enemy. At its' conclusion, the British government implements a program to recruit women as companions for the occupying soldiers.

The film starts promisingly enough as we are introduced to the three sets of characters who spur the story. These being the soldiers, a few original island inhabitants (including two women  involved in relationships with soldiers), and three British women who decide to come to the island in search of adventure and romance.

Conflicts ensue as the island women are thrown aside for the new British imports and the resident men grow resentful of the soldiers' arrogant presence on the island.

There are some memorable moments in the film. Ray Winstone's character is a sometimes hilarious version of Colonel Kurtz(Apocaplyse Now). However, considering the quality of the cast (Guy Pearce, Ray Winstone, Sammi Davis, Noah Taylor), this movie could have been a lot better. This was a real waste of Guy Pearce, for example.

Midway through the film the story disentgrates into a morass of confusion. While the beginning of the movie was sincere and believable the latter parts seemed contrived.

The DVD itself is bare bones (even has spelling errors in the menus) and I would recommend it more as a ""rent"" then a ""buy.""",1146009600,10,1322,5.013698630136986
