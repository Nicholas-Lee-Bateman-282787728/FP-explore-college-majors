8104876,5,B000E373K8,"The first time seeing this series appealed to me immediately.  Paul Winfield's elegant narration starts by briefly presenting the crime,  then a historical background of the area where the crime was commited, and finally, how the crime affected those involved.  Paul Winfield made this series great!!",1386979200,,300,5.478260869565218
