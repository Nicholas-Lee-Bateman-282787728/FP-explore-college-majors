8330654,5,B001OI36GC,Nightmares is well worth watching!  It isn't very long but it will certainly freak you out!  This is one of those movies that stays with you and you just keep thinking about it!  Loved it and LOVED the actors!,1350000000,,209,4.3076923076923075
8330655,5,B001OI36GC,"""Nightmares"" is a gem of short horror. It packs a punch in under ten minutes, with a feel like 2009's ""Paranormal Activity"". The film, while VERY short, and clearly made for a microbudget, is actually a very disturbing and creepy film about a young boy who has habitual nightmares, who uses simple techniques to prevent them. However, the nightmares become all too real one stormy night when the mother leaves a kitchen knife in the pumpkin pie...",1268352000,,447,4.818181818181818
8330656,5,B001OI36GC,"It may be less than 10 minutes long, but made me jump several times.  To be fair, I believe this was produced as a mobile video (iPhone/PSP) short film.  The sound and production value (although dark) are well above average.  Don't watch late at night, by yourself.  I hope this is merely a glimpse of what Jagels may be brewing up for us, somewhere in his deep dark basement laboratory...",1232064000,,389,4.514285714285714
8330657,1,B001OI36GC,"Warning for shoppers.... according to the description, this movie is only 6 minutes long. If this indeed is the case.... it isn't worth your money.",1231977600,,147,4.92
8330658,5,B001OI36GC,"I couldn't sleep after watching this.  ""Nightmares"" gave me nightmares.  I strongly recommend it for people with narcolepsy, this film will cure their proclivity to fall asleep easily.",1231632000,,184,5.535714285714286
