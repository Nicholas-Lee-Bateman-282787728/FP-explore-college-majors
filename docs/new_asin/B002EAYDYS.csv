Fantastic Beatrice Lillie is a real joy and treasure in this. Some of her comedy acting is decidedly very broad (entirely intentionally), though all the rest of the time she's subtly and sensitively naturalistic. The combination 100% splendidly works. (I wholeheartedly disagree with the prior poster, who wrote, ""This wishy-washy performance makes it difficult to decide just what to think about her."")

The authentic period flavour holds added appeal and interest, such as seeing how live theatre audiences responded to stage performances (or to WAITING for a performance to begin), the on-the-road traveling performers' lifestyle and day-to-day experience, etc. This is a film that I think young and old alike will thoroughly enjoy, as well as those who normally would never watch a Silent (or black and white) film. Picture quality is excellent for a movie of this vintage. The recent-years newly added musical score is wonderful and spot-on perfect for the film - an ideal companion to it that evokes the precisely right tone and mood at all times.

Incidentally, for those for whom it doesn't already go without saying, ""vampire"" (a.k.a. ""vamp"") back then was a popular term for a femme fatale type; it's a term that comes up frequently throughout ""Exit Smiling"".

This is a comedy with abundant charm and real heart. It's fun, briskly paced, and thoroughly entertaining. Prepare to laugh out loud!

PS: Vintage movie buffs will get a kick out of seeing Frank Pangborn in a Silent performance as the fey theatrical leading man in the stage play that the traveling troupe puts on. I always also enjoy sightings of Doris Lloyd, who portrays the play's leading lady.",1384646400,6,1724,5.099290780141844
8367378,4,B002EAYDYS,"Exit Smiling is the story of an acting troupe which travels from town to town playing an awful melodrama filled with heroes and villains and vampires and trickery. The troupe's lowest actress (Beatrice Lillie) aspires to become the star, and when she sets her eyes on a drifter in need of a job (Jack Pickford), she uses her small amount of influence and her huge imagination to get him a part in the show. However, when it comes time for them to play in the town he just escaped from, she really has to use her brain to tap-dance her way around a catastrophe.

The actors in this film occupy the B-tier, but they are pleasant enough. Pickford is an adequate leading man, but he is by no means an especially handsome man, nor is he given much to do in this role but play a stock character. Lillie is the real star, and she plays her part well, but her comedic talents are not on full display. She straddles the line between being a very natural beauty to being an awkward, tomboyish comedienne. This wishy-washy performance makes it difficult to decide just what to think about her.

Luckily, the film has charm and excellent direction by Sam Taylor, perhaps the most underrated director from the silent era. He lets the camera move to tell the story, and it is still astonishing to see how advanced silent films were during the time this film was made.",1328054400,7,1353,4.495934959349594
