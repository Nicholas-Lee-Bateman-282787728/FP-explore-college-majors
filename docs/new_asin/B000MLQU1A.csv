8169858,5,B000MLQU1A,"I love the fact that this VHS tape is still around.  It brings back so many memories of performers that are no longer with us.  It is a keepsake for any serious female impersonation admirer.  These performers, in their day, were considered the best in the business and to have them all in one location is monumental.  I love this tape and hope to eventually have it put on DVD.",1252195200,,377,4.3428571428571425
