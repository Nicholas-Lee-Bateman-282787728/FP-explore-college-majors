1657875,4,B00005RY9X,"Yes, I like this movie. As the titles introduce, Delilah loves girls and she loves boys. Unfortuanately, Delilah, a talented graphic artist, falls for a rocker who relies on heroin--enough said.  Now you wouldn't think this feel good movie has much to offer.  However, both the acting and script are superb and just believable.  And frankly, if you've been there, and done that, what's to complain about a positive take on an otherwise unrewarding experience?",1015113600,,459,5.093333333333334
7952693,2,B00005RY9X,"I should make a rule... if it says it's a cross between ""Chasing Amy"" and ""Trainspotting,"" do NOT buy it, even with a nude woman on the cover!

How many movies are there which are about women who fall in love with rock musicians that cinema viewers love?  ""Sid and Nancy"" is one that always comes to mind (a dark fantasy).  I love ""Dogs in Space"" myself.  Now there is a great movie that nearly no one in the USA has heard about (it stars the late, great INXS lead singer, Michael Hutchence).  ""The Doors""?  Well, this is the Canadian version of those movies, albeit with a lower budget along with a subpar screenplay and acting (due to the screenplay, if anything).

Quickly: Bisexual girl, Delilah, falls for heroin addict rock singer, Ryland.  He moves in with her, but she cannot get past her own (bi)sexuality, mostly due to his inability to ""kick the habit.""  Her friends begin alienating her, as much as she alienates them out of love for the singer.  What happens next, I will not spoil.

Well, the movie is done entirely with a hand-held camera.  This attempt at a cinema-verite look is often sloppy, with the camera movement being jumpy and quick.  Being made in 1997, it is understandable why it is like this: filmmaking style.  It is an annoying style (my opinion) and I often criticize movies for using the technique, especially when it is unnecessary.  Although here it gives one a sense of a 3rd person watching the story, I didn't think it was necessary for the entire movie to be filmed that way.  The editing is pretty good, as is the sound work for a low-budgie.

The acting (given the screenplay by the director) was not so great; I didn't believe the actors' or actresses' characters or their decisions (Yeah, Ryland is unable to personally kick the heroin habit - duh!  But why is no one willing to get him REAL help?).  The screenplay was a bit overdone (Okay, the lesbian girl LOVES Delilah, but she just can't get over her.  Is she that weak?), and the delivery by the performers, especially in the multi-character scenes, seemed as if they were reading off of cue-cards.  I didn't ""buy"" the relationship between the two main characters.  Is Delilah that ignorant that she is willing to give up her friends for a total friggin' loser who is unwilling to get PROFESSIONAL help?  She seems much brighter than that, and tougher.  Her love for him just doesn't cut it.  I didn't really get the addition of the gay couple or the religious older woman character.  Perhaps it was to just put a bit more ""color"" in the movie?  Okay, to be fair about the elderly woman, she knows that Delilah has problems, but when the film's setting moves over to her home, she still allows drug addicts to be in her home, condones smoking in her seemingly ""sterile"" home, and swearing is no biggie.  Even the subject matter in the paintings do not even phase her (and I didn't buy that Delilah could paint in the genre style).  Why does this woman even care about Delilah?  Is she Mrs. Kravitz from ""Bewitched""?

There is no nudity in the movie, but quite a bit of (often unnecessary) swearing and some drug usage. (Ryland has the most un-junkie arms I've ever witnessed!)  I mention this because the cover states ""Not Rated.""  Extras are not really worth mentioning, but I will: Trailer and a ""Director's Intro.""

This is the only work by writer/director Kirsten Clarksen.

2 of 5 Amazon stars.

A few tunes on the soundtrack are okay, but most are just blah, especially those with (supposedly) Ryland's vocals.  Also, there is an early Nickelback piece in the movie, if you are interested.",1379894400,,3593,4.610410094637224
7952694,3,B00005RY9X,Interesting film.  It was not what I thought however it was worth watching.  I would recommend it to others  yes.,1379116800,,113,4.55
7952695,4,B00005RY9X,Liked it. Glad I bought it. I couldn't find the movie any where else. I am very happy with it.,1375142400,,94,3.75
7952696,1,B00005RY9X,"I really don't know what to say about this movie. A. Wunderlich in his review called Horsey trash. He was being kind. Everything from the script the acting the score and the cinematography was nothing short of garbage. In some reviews here people loved this movie and I wish I could see why.
There is nothing at all original here. Girl meets girl then girl meets guy and has to give up girl. Guy leaves girl and girl gets guy back. Tragedy  happens and girl moves on to be a successful artist. All predictable and telegraphed.
The only thing about this movie that surprised me was I watched the whole thing and not surprisingly the longer it went the worse the plot and acting got
STAY AWAY from this movie or else you'll feel as foolish as I do",1373414400,,745,4.359712230215828
7952697,2,B00005RY9X,"This story was about a sexy young woman who fell in love with a heroin addict. I could not relate to any of the characters. Those who were not addicted to illegal drugs were addicted to cigarettes and smoked like fiends. Sorry, it was just not my cup of tea. I shun people like this for the plague that they are.",1364860800,,312,4.131147540983607
7952698,4,B00005RY9X,"I am a huge Todd Kerns fan, so I watched the movie (initially) because he was in it, and would watch it again for the same reason. Clearly, any movie about Heroin addiction is going to be dark, and this one is no exception; so, if you don't enjoy that type of movie, you may want to give it a pass. Now, having said that, I can honestly say it was better than I expected. Personally, I thought the actors did a fine job of making their characters believable and drawing me in/getting me emotionally invested. A ""must see"" for TK fans.",1319760000,,534,4.245098039215686
7952699,5,B00005RY9X,"Tuff or not, if you're as big of a Todd Kerns fan as I am this movie will stir up some emotions. I never cry yet I was tearing up again and again all the way through. It breaks my heart but I love this movie. Something Ill watch again and again.",1186963200,2,245,3.730769230769231
7952700,5,B00005RY9X,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE. IT WAS SLOW SOMETIMES BUT MOSTLY GOOD. I LOVED THE CHARACTERS, ESPECIALLY DELILAH AND SIMON. MY COUSIN HAD A HEROIN ADDICTION WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID AND THIS MOVIE WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE REALITY. I FOUND IT REALLY MOVING. I FELT VERY CONFUSED ABOUT WHO I WAS WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER AND I UNDERSTAND THE MAIN CHARACTER VERY WELL.",1081209600,3,347,4.2727272727272725
7952701,1,B00005RY9X,"With the main actress appearing like she's reading her lines the story of Horsey is poorly written, poorly directed, and has no believable emotion from any actor.  Primarily about an artist who turns her back on her best friends to be with a junkie who is addicted to heroin. If you are interested in this type of movie recommend ""Better Than Chocolate"" as this is a real bore.",1021593600,4,377,4.544117647058823
