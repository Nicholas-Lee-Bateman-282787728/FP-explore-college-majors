8372409,5,B002L6C5SQ,Wonderful music performed live by one of the best composers active today. A good purchase.,1474156800,,90,5.066666666666666
8372410,5,B002L6C5SQ,This concert teams up the two singers from Frontier with the composer Yoko Kanno and an band with an orchestra.  Easily the best Macross music DVD since the Cosmic Nyan Blu-ray has a few silly Christmas songs and a bonus standard R2 DVD disc that won't play on a US player (Final Budokan's bonus disc is a Blu-ray that plays on US players) and Nyan Clips is very short and is made primarily of recycled visuals from the series.  This is indeed a must have if you are a fan of Macross Frontier music.,1471996800,,499,4.297872340425532
8372411,5,B002L6C5SQ,"This is an excellent concert starring May'n and Maaya Sakamoto, or Sheryl Nome and Ranka Lee the two main female characters from the newest installment of the Super Dimension Fortress Macross Saga entitled Macross F, or Macross Frontier, and celebrates 25 years of this amazing anime series. It was released on DVD and Blu-Ray disc in November 2009. Yoko Kanno composed the music as she has in the past for Macross Plus and Macross Zero and performs live with May'n and Megumi, there are also appearances by the male main characters voice actors.

If you have had the chance to see Macross Frontier or at least the movies, you have probably been taken by the music. The series has a tremendous sound track, and this concert definitely delivers all the music you love, amazing light-shows, anime background work and a phenomenal performance by May'n, Megumi Nakajima, and Yoko Kanno!

The price is a little steep, but in my opinion totally worth it as you can only find Macross F titles as IMPORT ONLY. Due to issues with the rights, it is doubtful Macross F, its movies, or this concert will be released in other countries.

The run time of the concert in full is 167 minutes on disc one and 63 minutes of other footage on disc two.

If you are a fan of J-pop, do yourself a favor.",1334620800,9,1281,4.580786026200873
