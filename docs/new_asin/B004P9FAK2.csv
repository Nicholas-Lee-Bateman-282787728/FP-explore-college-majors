4444194,2,B004P9FAK2,"I thought the Order of the Phoenix was the most outstanding movie of all time. The soundtrack to it plays in my car daily. When the release of Half Blood Prince was delayed I thought I would go crazy waiting. With incredible anticipation I filed in with the masses to see it when it finally hit the theaters and much like the Goblet of Fire, was immediately disappointed by the absence of the Dursleys. And then who would have thunk it, but no Voldamort either. The last thing I was hoping for was a teenaged hormone-ladened skit. Though at times, Harry's humor was semi-entertaining, the only true Potter parts were the scenes with Malfoy. Quite frankly, the entire story line in the movie was irrelavent to the series. And the fact the 7th book had long ago been released ( and read) took all the guess work out of this movie. We already know why Snape killed Dumbledore and that Snape is the unsung hero. It has taken me this long to write a review for the sheer fact I was having trouble admitting the movie was a failure. Even the music score was pieces taken from past movies. Will I buy the DVD when released ? Of course. I own each book and movie and will most likely watch this movie again hoping that since I know it stinks already, I won't be so disappointed.",1252886400,4,1270,4.385593220338983
4444195,5,B004P9FAK2,"I am a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter books, and I have been mildly (Order of the Pheonix) to severely (Prisoner of Azkaban) disarppointed in the movies since the casting of Micheal Gambon as Dumbledore. Gambon is a great actor, but until this installment, I did not think that he adequately portrayed the character that fans of the book hold so dear. He was alternately too gruff, too clueless, and too weak. I think that this must have been due to writing instead of his acting, however, because he was GREAT in Half Blood Prince. Even with the added scenes that were not in the book, I felt that this installment remained truest to the book. I went to see this movie three times- and this is coming from someone who never goes to the movies. I am truley surprised that other reviewers have not given HBP more stars. To me, it is obviously the best attempt to remain true to the books to date.",1252713600,12,893,4.385542168674699
4444196,4,B004P9FAK2,"Love is in the air at Hogwarts, as Harry finds himself attracted to Ginny while Hermoine is attracted to the new quiddich sensation Ron who is attracted to someone else and so on.  While this may be harmless, there are forces at work that are anything but.  The death eaters are growing in strength and becoming more vicious, killing several muggles in a terrorist attack.  Diagon Alley is all but deserted, only Fred and George Weasley's joke shop is thriving.  Hogwarts has increased security, incoming students are being searched and the entire school is surrounded by a magic force field.  Harry is recruited by Dumbledore to convince former Hogwarts professor Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as the new potions teacher.  The task proves simple.  Slughorn is eager to return to Hogwarts, particularly with Harry Potter as a potential student.  Harry will later be required to do things not so simple.  Dumbledore believes Slughorn has valuable information that could be used against Voldermort and hopes Harry can find it out.  Slughorn has taken a definite liking to Harry, who has become one of his better students.  Of course, Harry has some help.  He is using an old potion book with very accurate notes courtesy of ""the half-blood prince"" (whoever he is).  Unfortunately, there is danger.  Despite the security precautions, Dumbledore is the target of assassination attempts.  Harry suspects Draco may be up to something, he has already been seen with wanted criminals.  Later on, death eaters attack and burn the Weasley house to the ground.  Eventually, Harry gets Slughorn to give Dumbledore a memory that confirms Dumbledore's worst fears about Voldermort, and a way to destroy him!  Will Harry and Dumbledore be able to use Voldermort's own strength against him?  Will they uncover the truth about the assassination attempts?  Will they be able to survive a Trojan-horse style invasion of Hogwarts?

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince reminds me of the start of A Tale of Two Cities - ""It was the best of times, it was the worst times.""  In some ways this is one of the best Harry Potter films made.  In others, though, it lags.  The storyline involving Ron Weasley and quiddich could have easily been done away with, the teenage romance could have been reduced to a couple of minutes.  Fortunately, the movie resolves its teen angst portion in time to get back to the main plot.  That is why Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince has been a success.  On the one (forget it!)  to five (excellent!) star scale, I rate this four.",1252281600,,2552,4.899532710280374
4444197,3,B004P9FAK2,"This remarkably well balanced series of wildly successful films based on an equally popular series of novels by J. K. Rowling shows no signs of waning with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  Potter veteran director David Yates and keeper of the flame scribe Steve Kloves have kept together a burgeoning franchise that is laying the foundation for a grand finale.

A new school year begins, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is coming to terms with being the `chosen one' to do battle against the ultimate in evil wizardry, Lord Voldemort and the evil Death Eaters surrounding Hogwart.  Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) enlists Harry to serve as bait to draw out the supremely evil Voldemort.  An older Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) returns to the school and brings with him a mysterious history of having taught the boy who became Lord Voldemort.  Harry in the meantime discovers a manuscript by the `Half-Blood Prince' and thinks that it is the key to learning the wizardry secret that will enable Harry and his comrades, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) to defeat the man who killed his parents and godfather, Sirius Black.  Harry's school rival Draco harbors revenge against him for the death of his evil father.  There is the aerial game Quidditch that challenges Ron's mettle, and the blossoming of adolescent romance between Potter and Ron's sister, Ginny and between Ron and  Hermione.  Then there is Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and some mysterious behavior that questions his allegiance.  As Dumbledore makes Harry promise to do whatever he instructs, the Death Eaters are unleashed within Hogwart with devastating consequences and a shocking betrayal that will forever change the destiny of the school and foreshadow the coming showdown with Voldemort.

This is a more grownup Potter as it explores relationships more thoroughly and some amusing situations arise such as a love triangle that plagues Ron.  It is amusing to see how hormones are thriving amongst the teens and love is in the air.  Growing up was never this hard. There are also surprises of a high order that will send the series on a new, ominous path while raising questions about the loyalty of a major player. The one constant is our beloved trio of maturing wizards who must face an uncertain future without an important character.  The film reinforces the continuous themes of loyalty and friendship among our wizard heroes.  That bond and natural chemistry among the three actors is partly what holds this remarkable series together.

Most of the characters are back from the previous film Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  It does feel like school has restarted when Professors Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall (venerable Maggie Smith) show up.  Other familiar faces reappear, which greatly help in the continuity and progression of the story.  The filmmakers are wise to introduce a couple new characters here and there without shaking up the status quo too much.  All the Potter films have benefited from a strong focus on storyline in keeping with the novel sources.

Production values are topnotch again, and the dark, moody colored cinematography is an artistic triumph. It is impressive at how mainstream films have pushed the creative aspects of filmmaking without sacrificing popularity; witness the cinematography and art direction of The Dark Knight and the film editing in The Bourne Ultimatum.  It has almost become pass to expect imaginative state of the art special effects in the Potter films, but they are always serving the plot and not merely to draw attention to the spectacle itself.

Since these are British performers, there is a bit of adjusting to their heavy British accents.  This film, perhaps more than any other, assumes that the audience is already well versed on Potter lore, and so it may prove a bit confusing to the uninitiated.  It starts out well and tries one's patience just a tad as it builds a complex narrative that loses steam half-way through and picks up momentum toward the end and never lets up with a devastating payoff which in turn sets up the two part finale in grand fashion.

Though not the best film of the series, The Half-Blood Prince sets the table for the final battle of good versus evil.  This must be a pretty good film because I can't wait for the final installments.",1251590400,,4355,5.004160887656034
4444198,5,B004P9FAK2,"I disagree without everyone who says there is no substance to this movie. There was plenty of substance in this movie, but not a lot of action. That is the difference. This was an amazing movie if you can appreciate character development and a story. But if you are into things blowing up and not caring about the characters or if they die, go watch Transformers.",1251590400,6,363,4.515151515151516
4444199,5,B004P9FAK2,"This movie visually brought the book alive for me.  I always know they can't put the whole book in a movie and they do their best to incorporate the important parts, so this movie touched on all the really important aspects of the story. Loved it!",1250812800,2,247,4.369565217391305
4444200,4,B004P9FAK2,"This is the sixth installment of the Harry series, and by now, Harry has grown resigned to the fact that being the Chosen One might put a damper on your love life.  In the opening scene, it looks like he might get lucky, but then Dumbledore shows up with yet another mission.  This time it's to recruit Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to teach at Hogwarts.  The plot is the same essentially; as Voldemort tries once again to defeat Harry and fails. Throw in some Quidditch footage, wacky hormonal high jinks among the Hogwarts' student body, and some cool special effects, and there's your movie. Only Tom Felton as Draco has replaced Voldemort as the designated sneerer, which is good because he's a lot more photogenic.

As reviewers have noted, you won't understand the title's meaning unless you've also read the book.  It might not matter much now, but could require some more explanation in the next two movies.  Then and again, if you're just seeing it for entertainment and not because you care about the books, it shouldn't matter. If you are familiar with the books, though, you will probably be going, ""Huh?"" at a few scenes.",1250812800,,1139,4.756345177664975
4444201,1,B004P9FAK2,"Although it's not specifically mentioned, I'm going to comment that as Albus Dumbledore discovered the 12 uses of Dragon's Blood, I believe I have discovered at least one use of Dragon Poo -- the screenplay does manage to look better than this substance, but only just barely.  Granted, reducing 650-odd pages into a motion picture that runs in a reasonable amount of time is a daunting task, but forays into totally made up sequences (specifically the visit of Bellatrix LeStrange, Fenrir Greyback, etc to The Burrow), does nothing to advance the plot.

However, I did enjoy the interior of the set of the Hogwarts castle, as they made it seem much more like what I would expect a castle to look like.

Much more could and should have been made of the pensive sequences, especially with regard to Dumbledore's admonition to include Ron and Hermione in what Harry learned, especially given its relevance to the final book.  Much more could also have been made of Harry's obsession with discovering what Draco was up to, although those seemed to lack any real hint of what was going on in those sequences (but I have to admit that I liked Tom Felton's portrayal as well as his costume).

Yes, I'll get the DVD when it becomes available, if only to have the complete collection.  I just hope I don't also find a Draught of Living Death handy when I watch it.  Come to think of it, maybe Steve Kloves was under its influence when he penned this abomination.",1250726400,10,1454,4.65625
4444202,4,B004P9FAK2,"Professor Minerva McGonagall: [to Harry, Ron, & Hermione] Why is it, that whenever anything happens, it's always you three?
Ron Weasley: Believe me, Professor. I've been asking myself that same question for the past six years.

Short attention span summary (SASS):

1. Dark times are at hand for both wizards and muggles, as the Death Eaters wreak a destructive path across both worlds.
2. Draco has a special assignment from you-know-who, which has his mum distressed enough to seek a bodyguard for him.
3.  Hogwarts turns into hormone central as teenagers start getting googly-eyed, and sometimes enlist magical assistance in matters of the heart.
4. Quidditch is always good entertainment, and so is a little walk down memory lane, a hunt for a dark treasure and a dramatic ending.
5. Still not enough Bellatrix Lestrange (the always amazing Helena Bonham Carter) - MORE MORE!!!

This is a rather good interpretation of a book that was largely about young love at Hogwarts (except of course for the ending), and although it was long, it held the interest painlessly.  I never expected much from this one, seeing as it isn't much more than a scene setter for the two grand finales, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.

The young actors have settled down well in their roles, and the rest of the cast fit as comfortably as always.  Jim Broadbent makes a perfect Horace Slughorn, and Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter and Dame Maggie Smith (albeit in a small role this time) continue to excel.  Kudos also to Bonnie Wright who plays Ginny Weasley, a character that has finally come into her own on screen.

Highly recommended for all Potter fans, even if only to get your fix before the next movie.

Albus Dumbledore: You must be wondering why I brought you here.
Harry Potter: Actually Sir, after all these years I just sort of go with it.

4444203,1,B004P9FAK2,"I finally realized what was causing me disappointment with the HP movies.  The continuity of the books was missing in the movies.  It's almost as if those in charge of making decisions hadn't read the books.  There were just too many missing parts to make a transition to the Deathly Hallows.  The Burrow is destroyed (didn't make sense in the movie and wasn't in the book)so where will the wedding take place?  What wedding?  Bill and Fleur weren't in the movie or even mentioned.  Given the track record of past movies, I'm not particularly optimistic about the last movie.",1250467200,15,575,4.747474747474747
