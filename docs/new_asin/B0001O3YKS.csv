8015761,2,B0001O3YKS,"I've watched six other movies directed by Alex de La Iglesia, and have loved every one of them, until I got to this one.  It became so tedious to me near the end that I fast forwarded through much of it.  It also affords few moments when Iglesia can shine, due to the dullness of both the actors (who in all fairness are supposed to be ordinary and rather dull) and the running joke (which is that these two rather ordinary guys become a national comedy sensation based on one slapping the other).  If you have to miss an Iglesia film, let it be this one.",1392163200,,555,4.216981132075472

8015763,2,B0001O3YKS,"I purchased it, because the director did Commonwealth and Dance with the devil and it was very cheap.  To me this movie had no laughing moments; I had a couple of smiles though.  It is better to take this as just entertainment not expecting any gut-busting sequences or funniness in general.  The music video on the disc was more entertaining and lively than the whole movie itself.  The girlfriend/arrest sequence is a plot hole in a way because it never explores if the fat guy really liked her.  How funny is a fat balding guy getting slapped with a reaction of no emotion?  This statement is the base of the fantasy comedy duo in this movie.",1207526400,,645,4.517241379310345

8015765,5,B0001O3YKS,"While I can't speak very well about this DVD, I can say that this movie had me laughing to tears.

It tells the story of a comedy duo who become extremely popular, not to mention rich. They work very much like every famous comedy duo, with a clown and a straight man, like Abbot and Costello. You would think this would make them happy, but seeing as how most of their comedy comes from the straight man slapping, punching, or otherwise hurting the clown, the hate begins to grow.

Darkly funny, this film is perfect for anyone who likes dark humor.",1137542400,6,549,4.425742574257426
