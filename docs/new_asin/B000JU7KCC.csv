2679299,3,B000JU7KCC,"I notice that Amazon has taken the price down considerably. It's obvious that hardly anyone can afford this! Classics, yes--Crappy films, yes.

High unreasonable price? Hell, Yes!

I guess if you're starting a video library, maybe?

This has GOT to be the most expensive thing Amazon has ever sold. (at its' original 4,000 price, for sure!)",1174176000,14,340,5.035714285714286
2679300,3,B000JU7KCC,"This year's Warner Mega Classics does not seem to be as good as the one they released the year before. The previous year mainly had collections of complete boxed sets. Also, last year's had more older classic cinema. This one appears to have films going all the way into the 90's and is spread out over six decades from the 30's to the 90's. There are a total of 14 Best Picture Oscar winners in this set, plus 10 more that are in the AFI top 100 films of all time. Plus you're getting some complete collections such as:

Cary Grant: The Signature Collection
Errol Flynn: The SIgnature Collection
TCM Archives: Laurel & Hardy
The Bette Davis Collection
The Complete Thin Man Collection
The Tarzan Collection Starring Johnny Weissmuller
The That's Entertainment Gift Set

On the bad side, there is much overlap with last year's mega-set. On the off-chance that you bought that collection, it probably would be a waste to buy this one too. To compare, look up ""Warner Classics Mega Collection"" to see what was offered in 2005. Another bad thing about this year's collection is the inclusion of some more modern and really bad films, most prominently the Poison Ivy series and the really awful Embrace of the Vampire, already mentioned by another reviewer. I just don't think Warner should release a Mega Set every year if they can't keep it up to the same level of quality of last year's package. For the few that can afford it, they should get their money's worth.",1172448000,15,1463,4.666666666666667
2679301,3,B000JU7KCC,"I looked at the films in this collection of ""classics."" Embrace of the Vampire, Poison Ivy, P.I. 2, P.I. 3 (P.U.), and others, are hardly classics. This appears to be a marketing plan to unload a bunch of mediocre DVDs that weren't selling, by hiding them in a list of better films, some great films, and many B-features.",1169856000,50,321,4.551724137931035
2679302,3,B000JU7KCC,"I went through the list item-by-item.  There are definitely a few movies that are classics.  Then, there is the other 'stuff.'  For that price, they should provide US with a list and allow us to choose.  I've paid a lot of cash over the years for my DVD entertainment.  I'm not about to sheel out $1100.00 more.  For those of you with 'deep pockets,' dare you take the risk?  Three stars...",1167177600,41,390,4.408450704225352
2679303,3,B000JU7KCC,"All that should be noted is that the the company now known as WB has elected to place Singin In The Rain in the same DVD collection with Tarzan the Ape Man (1981).  Be wary,  very very wary.  The great and the garbage.

No excuse for such an undiscriminating collection to be thrown together.  What is the point?  Surely they have bled us in numerous other ways,  extra features that they have ""just discovered"".  Endless packing must have its own end. Or not??",1166227200,71,461,4.469879518072289
2679304,5,B000JU7KCC,"I can't type enough to do these films justice. I can't imagine anybody affording this on my salary without going into debt, but wow by all means purchase if you can.

I imagine for lack of depth my review will warrent a not helpful, but most of these movies are gems, and I reccomend purchasing if possible.",1165536000,20,307,4.385964912280702
8153115,3,B000JU7KCC,"I wouldn't buy this set myself because I have most of the best ones already. A couple of sightings tells me that there is far more good stuff here than mediocre or bad. If a newish collector wanted to get a lot of good stuff in one fell swoop, this would be a pretty good opportunity. It all depends on the price, doesn't it? IF you don't have more than a few of the films, and IF you can get the set for a reasonable price, I believe there are some potential buyers. At the original price, no.",1296172800,,494,4.051020408163265
8153116,1,B000JU7KCC,WAY Overpriced ! 300-400 $ is more reasonable for this collection for those who want it . 150-200 $ for those looking for a deal on movies that probally have no intention in watching 10 % of these movies .Even if i bought this collection at 2 $ a piece and sold them on ebay would be hard pressed to make a profit ... Would give this a 0 star if i could !,1199750400,4,355,3.810810810810811
8153117,1,B000JU7KCC,Too bad it's not possible to award zero stars.  Read the titles.  'Nuff said.,1199232000,4,77,4.428571428571429
8153118,3,B000JU7KCC,"I mean, they're kidding, right?  Why not just sit down with Maltin's guide or an old copy of Movie Hound and come up with a list of the truly good films, instead of letting the studio dump a bunch of old rejects and loss leaders on your lap?  I suppose if you've got money to burn and want to ""save time"" by not thinking (and shopping) for yourself, then this is a handy purchase... But then what about the time it will take to decide which of these movies are dogs and which are worth having?  Seems pretty silly.",1198972800,2,514,4.171717171717172
8153119,3,B000JU7KCC,"All I will say is this.  Yes there are goodies in here, but a few klinkers as well.  I'd rather just pick the goodies out and buy em separately (some as low as 10 bucks a pop). I have my fair share of these, and when I want more of them, that's what I will do.  No need to lay out 4 figures for stuff I will never watch again.",1197849600,5,326,3.6285714285714286
8153120,2,B000JU7KCC,How many of you can't collect most of these for way under the $20 per movie price?  There are great movies in this list and many I would like to have but probably would not buy except in a collection.  Still the price is about $1000 too high for what you get.,1196985600,6,259,3.9615384615384617
8153121,1,B000JU7KCC,"How can I say this and not sound mean I found the movies being offered to be ALOT for your average ""jo"" who makes it from check to check and even this offer is TOO expensive for the movies you get and they are NOT something I would pay for well maybe watch them on TV if nothing else was on sure there was some good ones being offered but nowhere WORTH the price Save your money for $4,000 I would goto DISNEY LOL!",1194825600,6,414,3.9404761904761907
8153122,3,B000JU7KCC,"Potential buyers should note that there are some duplications within this collection. For example there are boxes of Errol Flynn and Bette Davis films as well as single copies of some of the same films (Sea Hawk, Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex, etc.).

Also, there are a huge number of those annoying security stickers to remove. Some DVDs have three as well as shrink wrap. At a minute and a half per DVD, that's about five hours of tedious labor! Fortunately, most of the DVDs do not have the horribly over-adhesive, not-fully-removable stickers that Fox (for example) always seems to use.

The cost per DVD is under $10, so given a typical DVD price of close to $20 the set only makes sense for buyers for whom more than half the titles are appealing (and not already owned).  There are a handful of deluxe multi-DVD sets like Gone with the Wind and Ben-Hur, so the ""198 title"" claim on Amazon's page presumably translates to a bit more than 200 DVDs. On the other hand, the duplicates of course reduce the number of unique titles, so it probably works out to about 198 non-duplicated DVDs!

One final point: Warner Brothers generally treats their old films well. The prints are acceptable or better, and there are more special features than on most other studio DVDs.",1187049600,7,1277,4.6875

Go with the best not with the amount. with that $4,000 i can go to europe have fun!",1175731200,9,522,3.961904761904762
8153124,2,B000JU7KCC,"I can't imagine anyone buying a collection like this at a price such as this ... unless they are just out to get every movie WB released to DVD. The set defies logic. Some good movies, lots of okay ones, some are junk. The marketeers must believe that we buyers can't decide for ourselves what we like, hence they piled everything together and try to sell it as a package. If you are one of those considering this collection, I have some water front property in Florida to sell you too.

I highly recommend that you pick and choose the movies you like (if unsure, rent it first) and buy them one by one. You'll save a bundle and be better off in the long run.

Not recommended at all.
