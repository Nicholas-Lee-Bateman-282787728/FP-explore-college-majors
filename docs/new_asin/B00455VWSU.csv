8416554,5,B00455VWSU,Did know how this DVD was going to be. I ordered this for my husband for his birthday. We are huge motocross fans. One night I came upstairs and he was in his office watching this DVD. He was in a trans watching this. He absolutely loved it. He was so excited and would not peel his eyes away from the tv.
