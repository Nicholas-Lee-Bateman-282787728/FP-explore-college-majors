8327724,5,B001NPJ0ZC,"This is a video that was done by a reporter who served on the combat line with Grunts, You have it here if you want a ""real"" War Movie....
  These interviews were not made in a fancy hotel like most so called combat reporters like to cover up.....
  This is the real deal.......He has been there done that.
  God Bless him.

I was a grunt who served in the Armored Calvary... 1st/4th Calvary of the Big Red One 1967/68....
  This is a amateur video and the producer not only depicted what it's like to live on the ground in all kinds of weather and combat turmoil but he was seriously wounded as a result of his going after bringing the real truth to the world.......

War is Hell as he so well proves..........
Welcome Home.......
  This film makes Apolypse now and the phony issues presented by that movie belong in the chitter.

If the author reads this believe me Brother you have earned your CIB and Purple Heart.......'
  Welcome Home......Thanks for caring enough about those of us that served  in combat to be almost killed doing it to tell our story.....

 This is not Hollywood and I am sure he has not made millions with his Very Well done work, It is hard to screw up the truth, This is in your face Real combat.

While watching it, you really get the feeling that you know the narrator and you care about his experiences. The documentary is a great look at what it was like to be in the middle of the Vietnam War. This is far and away the best war documentary I have seen. This movie doesn't shy away from any topics that this man faced in war. This movie gives you a real inside look at what the narrator went through before he entered the war, what he experienced in the war, and what he experienced following the war to get his life back on track. This movie is definitely worth your time and money.",1262649600,2,697,4.32824427480916
8327726,2,B001NPJ0ZC,"There had been a lot of excellent film shot during the ten years of the Vietnam war.  As a veteran (Korea) I became interested in Vietnam war films, because my brother-in-law served in the 25th division in the late 60's.  There is a lot of high-quality film footage of combat from that war, however this DVD contains little of it.  The camera man, who is the narrator in the film states he had no  experience with film-making prior to the army and, unfortunately, it shows.  Out-of-focus shots, shooting into the sun, herky-jerky camera movements (even non-combat scenes).  One could make allowances for cameraman's inexperience, but compared to other combat films (WWII & Korea), this is uninteresting, poor caliber film-making.  Not recommended.",1250640000,2,747,5.12396694214876
8327727,5,B001NPJ0ZC,"I originally watched this movie as I was doing a report on the Vietnam war for my university. I watched and researched as many Vietnam documentaries as possible and Shooting Grunts was by far the most original and engaging of any of them. This unique perspective of the Vietnam war will give you insight you've never seen and won't see anywhere else.  The editing of this documentary is tremendous and the music is perfectly integrated with the war footage, making the documentary 100 times more entertaining than the usual war documentary. I'd recommend Shooting Grunts to anyone who is interested in the Vietnam war, film, photography, cinematography, or documentaries.",1232236800,2,671,5.155963302752293
