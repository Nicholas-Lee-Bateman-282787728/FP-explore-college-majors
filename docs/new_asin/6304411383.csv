862564,2,6304411383,"""The Outrage,"" while not quite an outrage, is, at least, a disappointment.  A film with this cast (Paul Newman, Claire Bloom, Edward G. Robinson) and director (Martin Ritt) promises a better result.  Much of the fault lies with Ritt.  He shot the film with an odd combination of lenses and camera angles that, while adding to the atmosphere, make the flashback sequences appear distant and uninvolving.  The question, in the end, is not ""what happened?"" but rather ""who cares?""
The film succeeds best in the framing sequences featuring Robinson, in one of his best roles, as the con man who keeps score and philosophizes about human nature.  James Wong Howe's exceptional black and white photography deserves special mention, and Newman's over-the-top Mexican bandit almost convinces.",1032220800,2,784,5.24

862670,5,6304411383,"The screenplay, actors, music, photography, the Old Southwest location, is absolutely superb! The screenplay expands the story and adds more detail to each persona. Newman, the bandido Carrasco, speaks English and Spanish which  is common, and pulls the 'race card' at his trial. Edward G. Robinson, the 'Con Man', scoffs, mocks and laughs every time he hears a new version. In the final scenes, Claire Bloom's brilliant performance puts us in the mood of a live Broadway play by Tennessee Williams.  Notice the expressions of The Prospector, Howard Da Silva, when the Con Man finds him out. William Shatner's part, The Preacher, is minimal. Laurence Harvey's character, The Husband, expresses loathsomeness, scorn and disdain for his wife verbally and on his face. The camerawork, ethereal ( notice the blur when Carrasco is sick and falls off his horse and the scene around the dead man), close ups, long shots, overhead, upward spiral, and the location in the Arizona desert and scenes by the waterfall are so picturesque. One can see James Wong Howe's camera influence from 'Rashomon'. The musical compositions and orchestrations of Alex North are wonderful ! There are only a few sections in the film where music is played, which is effective in maintaining the silence and solitude of the desert. Festive Mexican dance music, with harp, flutes, tambourine, drums, violins, starts when Carrasco takes a siesta under a giant cactus as the couple passes by. The music continues as Carrasco gallops after them through the giant cactus desert and is reminiscent of ""The Cisco Kid"". Later, a lovely theme for the wife that modulates into an eerie, spooky theme, dark harmonies orchestrated with bass clarinet and low alto flutes when she is accosted at the waterfall by Carrasco on his heavily breathing horse, which puts emphasis on the lecherous looks he gives to his victim. Also, the haunting sound effects and surrealistic photography when she plunges into the river. Hollywood can not be 100% politically correct and please everyone. Even though this film may seem 'politically incorrect', it is not.  There are many Mexicans that do look like Paul Newman we call 'rubio', meaning 'fair'.  Anthony Quinn already got an Oscar as a Mexican revolutionary, ""Zapatista"", in Viva Zapata (with Marlon Brando playing Zapata). Why would Quinn take a role like 'Carrasco' ? If you really want to keep it real, how about the bandido in ""Treasure of Sierra Madre'', Mexican actor Alfonso ( ""We don't need any stinking badges"" ) Bedoya to play the role? The Apaches complained about 'Geronimo' being played by Cherokee actor Wes Studi. Give me a break! There must be 'box office attractions' to play the roles. Great cast. To me, casting is everything. Edward G. Robinson is at his best. I really enjoy Newman's performance with his 'Wallace Beery like raspy voice' and how the screen writers are historically 'politically correct' when Carrasco mentions the way Mexicans, 'greasers', are looked down upon by 'gringo's and how they took away his territory, and would be found guilty of alleged past, present and future crimes anyway. I know the post civil war history of my family from the Old Southwest. (Many settlers from Spain and Old Mexico lost their Spanish land grants and were then treated like Negro slaves.)
The most recent edition of 'Rashomon' has a commentary that takes us through each step of the story, purpose of camera angles, effects, etc. Also, interviews with the cameraman, set director and others in the making of it. I have watched 'Rashomon' and 'Outrage' several times. Each time I see something new. I recommend others do the same. I absolutely love this film and will place it with my other favorites of all time, such as Casablanca, Rashomon, Seven Samurai, and the 'original' Around The World In 80 Days by Michael Todd.
  Some films that were neglected like Orson Wells' ""Touch of Evil"", is now considered one of his best (Charlton Heston is a Mexican in this one). I hope you enjoy this film as much as I do and that someday ""Outrage"" will have a commentary and interview with William Shatner in the making and give this film the credit and recognition it deserves.

862675,4,6304411383,"Rendition of Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, Rashomon (1958), set in the American old west. Paul Newman so immerses himself in the role of the outlaw that he is practically unrecognizable; I literally forgot I was watching Newman act. He completely eliminates all pretentions and makes his performance invisible - a significant achievement for any actor. His mannerisms and gestures are simply fun and fascinating to watch. Edward G. Robinson chews up his lines as the cackling, cynical huckster (if this were a Greek tragedy, he would be an ironic chorus) - simply grand. William Shatner is very good as the quietly disillusioned preacher. Shatner is especially good at conveying pain and sorrow through his eyes. If you have ever seen Star Trek II or III, Boston Legal, The Twilight Zone, or even The Horror at 30,000 Feet, for that matter, you know what I mean. Claire Bloom is also very good, as is Howard Da Silva.

This is indeed a film that relies as much on performance as it does on dialogue. The latter is also pretty consistently very good, with a few moments of true greatness. The cinematography of the legendary James Wong Howe is beautiful, as are the backdrops of this mostly-soundstage film. It is a little rough around the edges, but for fans of any of the aforementioned actors, of classic (if not classical) Hollywood cinema, and of challenging dramas in general, The Outrage is a must see.",1289174400,2,1408,4.866666666666666

862767,3,6304411383,"THE OUTRAGE, screenwriter Michael Kanin's western re-working of the all-time Japanese classic ""Rashomon"", was dismissed by most critics upon it's release in 1964 but has slowly come to be regarded as one of the most unusual classics of it's genre.  Directed by Martin Ritt and starring his favourite leading man Paul Newman as a Mexican bandit, with gorgeous B&W photography from James Wong Howe; it deserves to be seen by fresh new audiences.

A disillusioned preacher (William Shatner) sits at the train station, and discusses the town's latest ""outrage"" with a wily con-man (Edward G. Robinson) and the prospector (Howard Da Silva), who stumbled across it's ensuing carnage.  Notorious Mexican bandit Juan Carrasco (Paul Newman) stands accused of murdering a man (Laurence Harvey) and viciously raping his wife (Claire Bloom), yet as more witness testimonies emerge--including the wife and even the husband!--we are forced to consider the shades of grey within the case and who the real guilty party might actually be.

In her 1982 autobiography ""Limelight and After"" (which I highly recommend), Claire Bloom briefly discussed her impressions of working with Newman and the overall atmosphere created on the set of THE OUTRAGE:
""In [The Outrage], who wouldn't have had a good time?  There was Paul Newman being a Mexican and me being a Southern lady, and James Wong Howe making us look terrific charging through the forest on horses - but it had nothing to do with acting.  Paul Newman is, in fact, a very fine actor, but that was mostly running around having your picture taken.  It was simply fun, like going on location""

Filming a western drama in the 1960's in black and white was quite a revolution at the time, but it also served a dual purpose in concealing the only things that Newman simply couldn't have had while playing a Mexican--his piercing blue eyes!  Claire Bloom nicely fits the bill as the Southern wife; Laurence Harvey, to me at least, is the most fascinating character in the piece because he spends most of the proceedings gagged, and his acting is very internal as a result.

A most thought-provoking film.",1259625600,,2134,4.985915492957746
862768,3,6304411383,"With the success of the remake of popular 1954 Akira Kurosawa film ""Seven Samurai"" to the Western known as ""The Magnificent Seven"" in 1960, ""THE OUTRAGE"" was a 1964 western remake of another Kurosawa classic ""Rashomon"" from 1950.

The takes place in a western town known as the Silver Gulch.  The preacher (William Shatner) awaits the train during a storm at the train stop.  Arriving at the stop is  the prospector  (Howard Da Silva) who wants to know why the preacher is leaving town and tries his best to have him stay.

The preacher came to the town to change the lives of people for good but he's disgusted after a trial which he and the prospector have been discussing.  It appears the preacher feels that the town has become a town full of sin and the murder trial has brought the worst in people.  And thus, he wants to leave feeling he failed.

But in comes the con man (Edward G. Robinson) who learns the story of what transpired at the murder trial frmom the two men.

You start to learn that on the day of the murder, the preacher was coming into town and saw the Col. Wakefield (Laurence Harvey) and his wife Nina (Claire Bloom) riding in their carriage.  That was the last time he saw of them.

As for the prospector, he was the man who discovered the dead body of Col. Wakefield and went to report it to the sheriff which lead to a manhunt.  During the manhunt, an outlaw Juan Carrasco is found near the murder and he is handcuffed outside the sheriff's office while the whole town watches the trial about the murder and alleged rape of his Col. Wakefield's wife.

The sheriff (Albert Salmi) gives his story of how they came to capture Carrasco.  Then Carrasco gives his story about what happened.  In his story, he was resting and while resting, he sees the Wakefields coming by.  He goes to them and tries to sell them an ancient Aztec object with a green stone.  And in his story, he robs the Wakefields, ties up the husband and rapes his wife.  But then his wife says that Carrasco should give him the right to fight for his pride since she lost everything and thus the fight ensues between Carassco and Col. Wakefield and Carassco grabs his knife and kills him.

Sounds like a believable story since Carassco is a feared desperado but just when everything looked as if Carassco was guilty.  Col. Wakefield's wife Nina has her turn during the trial to explain what happened and her story is completely different from the story Carassco gave.

Then an Indian medicine man (Paul Fix) who came across the body gives his account of what happened to Col. Wakefield during the trial.

With three entirely different stories of how Col. Wakefield died, who is telling the truth?  But during the discussion between the preacher, the prospector and con man, it is learned that one of them knows the real truth of what truly happened that day.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""THE OUTRAGE"" makes its first appearance on DVD and is presented in black and white.  The picture quality is good for a film released back in 1964 but I did notice a few scratches and dust.  But overall, people who have waited for a DVD release for so long will enjoy the quality of this film.

If there was one thing that fans should be happy is that ""THE OUTRAGE"" is presented in black and white and not in it's colorized version.

As for audio, the film is presented in mono.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features.  I wished there was a trailer or something included.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""THE OUTRAGE"" is part of the Paul Newman Film Series and Warner releasing Newman films that have yet to be released on DVD (or on video).  So, reading on the Internet and seeing how many people have awaited for a DVD release, finally fans of this film will get their wish.

What one will have to remember is that this film was released in theaters back in 1964.  Despite being based on ""Rashomon"", it's probably best not to think of ""Rashomon"" at all and think of this film as its own film and respect what Martin Ritt brought to this film, a screenplay by Michael Kanin that definitely has its twist and turns,  and a performance of Paul Newman playing an ethnic role.

It's quite unusual to see how humorous this film turned out to be and to find out the truth of what happened that day between Carassco and the Wakefields.  Unfortunately where Rashomon was a film that was dramatic and deadly, ""THE OUTRAGE"" just showed the worst in human motivations.  As much as I hoped for a fantastic reveal, unfortunately the film falls flat.

If anything, I felt that William Shatner did quite well playing the preacher and to see his interaction with the prospector and the con man captured the drama, while watching the different fight scenes between Newman's Carassco and Harvey's Wakefield was quite enjoyable as their characters have a gunfight, go over a waterfall, and eventually their battle to the death.

Overall, ""THE OUTRAGE"" is not a bad film, it's just a film that seems that it had a lot of potential but somehow it just misses its mark.",1235865600,5,5013,4.540691192865106
862769,4,6304411383,"Unlike a lot of the reviewers I have no frame of reference in comparing this Western remake of Kurasawa's original so I have to judge the film on it's own terms.  It's a good film that posits alot of interesting food for thought not the least that cowardice and vanity are sins comparable to rape and murder.  That said it doesn't live up to it's potential.  I attribute that to the hammy performances by the film's principals and Paul Newman is not exempt from criticism.  His bandit seems to have been lifted note-for-note from Eli Wallach in ""The Magnificent Seven"" and not with good results.  You could engender more empathy for Claire Bloom's rape victim if her performance wasn't so overwrought.  Laurence Harvey, per usual, is the substance of wood.  The best work here is delivered by the supporting actors who witnessed the events of the trial.  Believe it or not, William Shatner as a disillusioned preacher gives an effectively understated account.  Howard Da Silva as a prospector who gives key testmony at the trial and the inimitable Edward G. Robinson as a sarcastic snake oil salesman are also terrific.  An interesting film that could have been more.",1235865600,10,1167,4.848484848484849

Carrasco has been convicted of raping a woman (Claire Bloom) and murdering her husband (Laurence Harvey), but four eye-witness accounts conflict... All agree that the bandit raped the woman, but only one asserts that he committed the killing...

Sadistic, defiant, and challenging, Carrasco snarls, sneers, and walks with macho arrogance, to hide the fact that he can only be strong by tying a man to a tree and raping his wife...

The role allows Newman to give a bravura performance, not unlike Toshiro Mifune's in the Kurosawa film, and the stylization would fit the story if everybody else weren't playing it so straight... As it is, the performance seems too showy, easily understandable, exaggerated...",1233100800,,894,5.194444444444445

7870129,4,6304411383,"Review of The Outrage
Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

The Outrage is the American version of Rashoman, the famous Japanese story told from multiple points of view. In this stylized tale, a crime has been committed. One mans version is related from start to finish, convincing the audience of whats so. Then, a second witness comes forward. His version is different, planting the seed of doubt into the viewers head. And so it goes.

Those of you who like to discuss philosophy after a movies end have probably seen this film, or another version of it. I like this version because it was produced right after the end of the Hays Code. Violence and sex were allowed in movies during the 1960s, but since it was all new to filmmakers, they didn't go overboard. While the movie discusses rape and murder, it handles them tastefully. In The Outrage, get ready to see some intriguing performances from Laurence Harvey, Paul Newman, William Shatner, Claire Bloom, Edward G. Robinson, and Howard Da Silva. With a twist during every tale, you won't know who to trust! And youll be talking about the ending long after the credits roll, trust me.",1499644800,,1134,4.722222222222222

7870134,4,6304411383,"... you should if you have the chance to see ""The Outrage"" which is based on Akira Kurosawa's film. Produced in 1964 it was made as a tribute by Martin Ritt who was a fan of the movie ""Rashomon"". It follows pretty closely to the story line in Kurosawa's film hailed by many as the first masterpiece to come out of Japan after the second World War. The big difference of course is the time and location of the story. Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" takes place in 12th century Japan while Ritt's ""The Outrage"" takes place in 19th century U.S. in the old west. Other then that the rest of ""The Outrage"" follows fairly closely to ""Rashomon"". There is a rape and a murder. But who did it and how did it happen? There is four different versions of what took place just as in the original. There is the outlaw, played by Paul Newman, who admits he killed the man, played by Laurence Harvey, after raping his wife, played by Claire Bloom. There is the wife's version where she admits she killed her husband. Then in the most interesting point in the plot the murdered man's version of what happened is told through a second person. In ""Rashomon"" it was a medium while in ""The Outrage"" since it takes place out west an Indian Medicine Man has the spirit of the murdered man speak though him. The dead man confesses he committed suicide. Now what? Who is to believed. Three different versions of what happened with three different confessions to the murder. There is a fourth version that is finally told by the man who claims he found the body of the murdered man. But it could be that man saw more then he claims to.

Throughout it all the same question that is brought up in ""Rashomon"" is brought up in ""Outrage"" too. That being what is truth and what is lies and is man capable of telling the truth. It is a film made to challenge the viewer and get them to think what their perception of truth is. As I described it in my review of ""Rashomon"", *The whole premise to the movie is just what is truth and who is telling it. One version must be the right version of what just did happened. If so does that mean everyone else is lying as to what happened? Or is it that between all or some of the versions does the truth appear in bits and pieces leaving the viewer to take the parts from each version to form one whole truth? Or if you really want to get philosophical does everyone have their own idea just what truth is or is it human nature for people to lie? In that regard the film does prove interesting and compelling for the viewer to watch so they can put together just what they think the truth, as well as truth itself, really is. This is a movie that can get you thinking.* Martin Ritt does a good job of presenting those same questions here in this movie.

Aside from the philosophical aspects ""The Outrage"" is a decent movie with an all star cast with some decent directing and writing to it. In addition to Newman, Harvey and Bloom other great actors who appear in ""Outrage"" include Howard De Silva, Edgar G. Robinson and a very young William Shatner. With a line up like this the acting is first rate.

Of course there is the debate of which is the better version or at least is ""The Outrage"" as good as ""Rashomon"". While I like it and think it is very good I don't think ""Outrage"" is quite as good as the original Japanese version. Kurosawa's version is more deep in exploring the issue of truth and what truth is while ""Outrage"" feels like a copy of those issues without presenting anything new to the discussion. ""Outrage"" just doesn't quite reach the level that ""Rashomon"" does in presenting this interesting story and the issues it brings up. Still if you have seen ""Rashomon"" then you owe it to yourself to watch ""The Outrage"" and compare these two stories. On the other hand if by chance you have seen ""The Outrage"" then you need to see the original version and compare for yourself which is the better one. And if you have never seen either version you need to watch at least one if not both versions. Both of these versions provide a very interesting storyline for anyone to watch and challenge their perception of man and his ideas of what truth is and what fact is.",1436227200,,4174,4.376288659793815
