7821507,4,630211327X,"I've been a fan of Steve McQueen since the early 1970's. I first saw ""Steve McQueen-Man On The Edge"" back in 1988 when it was broadcast on PBS.I have this in my video library,it seems Amazon.com is one of the few places this video is available. The documentary was originally released in 1986 and is narrated by actor James Coburn who worked with McQueen on ""The Magnificent Seven"" in 1960 and ""The Great Escape"" in 1963,which were two of their most popular movies.
  The documentary features interviews with his first wife whom he was married to for more than ten years. Also,it features interviews with their son and daughter,Director Norman Jewison,and other people whom McQueen worked with and friends who knew him. It features film clips from his early days in television and many clips from his best movies. The only reason I'm not giving this documentary 5 stars is because it's only a little over 60 minutes long and kinda leaves you wanting more. However,fans of Steve McQueen will enjoy this biography.",990144000,18,1012,4.84393063583815
