857741,5,6304400381,"This is a wonderful movie.  Pooh and his friends take an adventure to find Christopher Robin.  They are apprehensive because they are going somewhere they have never gone before, and so it seems scary.  But, as they search for Christopher Robin, they find out about themselves.  Piglet is brave, Tigger is strong, Rabbit is smart...all things that they really knew deep within themselves and Christopher Robin points out, once they find him. When you believe in yourself, anything is possible.  This movie is more than entertaining, it encouages children to believe in themselves and have the will to accomplish their goals.",988070400,5,624,5.138613861386139
857742,5,6304400381,"Christopher Robin is starting school, but he doesn't have it in himself to tell Pooh Bear that he won't be home to share his days with Pooh. Instead, he writes a note to Pooh, but the note is misinterpretted and Owl claims that Christopher Robin is trapped in a place called Skull, an evil place, at the very edges of the hundred acre wood. And so to get their beloved friend back, Pooh and his friends set off on an adventure to find Christopher Robin.  I have always loved Pooh, and this movie is definatly for Pooh lovers. Although straight-to-video movies tend to be on the worst side for quality, this is one of the better ones I've seen out. It's very touching and the characters seem like old friends to me when I watch. Maybe I sound cheesy but this movie's worth a try!",977788800,6,778,4.36551724137931

858012,4,6304400381,"I read that this film was received poorly when it was first released. There is no justifiable reason for that. This is one of the few times I was eager to write a review. So much to love, despite a handful of flaws.

Behind The Many Adventures, the 2011 film, and possibly the Tigger Movie, this is one of the best Pooh movies and Disney sequels. While a bit darker than other Pooh films and shows, I saw this once as a kid and remember loving it very very much. It's been on my wish list for years and I don't regret buying it one bit. Frankly, I am still and always have been more scared of the stuffed Pooh winking at the end of Many Adventures than anything in this supposedly scary film. (If your kids (or you, I won't judge) are scared of that, don't worry. There's no winking Pooh in this one).

As an animation student myself, I was overanalyzing every shot and saw a few cost-cutting techniques that might pop out at older fans, but kids won't mind. There are a very small few Scooby-Doo moments, such as running in place and forgetting to fall. There are also a few lines here and there that seem out of character. And the original reel seems to have gotten a bit (VERY SLIGHTLY) dusty in the decade between VHS and DVD releases. BUT,

Flaws out of the way, the characters are acted beautifully with quite a few of the original actors, namely Rabbit, Piglet, and Tigger. Though 30 years after ""The Honey Tree,"" their voices have noticeably aged. Their performances have not. The film begins with a heartwarming song (With a few other great songs (and one unnecessary one), followed by a scene with my favorite Tigger and Eeyore moments of all time. You'll know when you get there. As for the series' signature whimsical wisdom, it's stuffed and fluffed with it.

In terms of the characters, each one overgoes significant growth. Piglet overcomes his anxiety, Rabbit must learn not everything he reads is true (""There's no fog on this map!""), Eeyore must work with his friends, and Pooh, well, the silly old bear must cheer his friends along through the worst of times. Despite this, they're still the characters we grew up with at the end. It's also worth noting that this film begins with an adaptation of the final chapter of AA Milne's second book as well as Many Adventures, and builds on the classic story.

The long and short of it is, this is some top-notch Pooh. Everything you love is here, with a few flaws and slightly scary moments no worse than ""Heffalumps and Woozles"" and Pooh's wink in the original. At just under an hour, it will undoubtedly hold your kid's attention (Or yours) with valuable lessons such as overcoming fears, not worrying about everything, and not believing what you read/hear while the truth stares you in the face, and enough Pooh-style zen wisdom to be enjoyable for all ages.",1473379200,,2824,4.562130177514793

This movie isn't cute or well made, it has all the elements of a scary movie aimed at a much older audience.

858457,3,6304400381,"My daughter LOVES Winnie-the-Pooh. Any Pooh. New or classic, she doesn't care! We checked this movie out from the library and it was so scratched that over half of it would not play. So I tried Amazon. Unfortunately you can only rent this for 3 days through Instant Video. I would like to be able to purchase it through Instant Video rather than have yet another DVD taking up space in my home. But it looks like I will end up buying the physical copy.

While this is not nearly as good as other Winnie-the-Pooh movies, my daughter loves it. The animation is the older style, like from the 90's. I loved the 90's Pooh tv show and the Many Adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh movie when I was a kid. I haven't been able to find the show for my daughter (except in bad resolution YouTube videos) but she LOVES the Many Adventures movie, it remains our all time fave. (A close second is Winnie-the-Pooh the movie from 2011)

After watching this, my daughter loves to draw her own map and pretend to follow it. She likes to pretend her Pooh toys are going to save Piglet from being carried off by butterflies. There are some spooky parts and I found my daughter sitting on my lap to be soothed during those parts. She asked if ""everything will be okay"" and I said, ""yes, there's always a happy ending"" and she was fine after that. Now she loves the spooky parts best and has me rewind to back to the spooky parts multiple times to watch them over again!",1422230400,2,1443,4.380597014925373

858630,5,6304400381,"This movie surprised me in a few ways. First off, this is the first Disney direct-to-video movie I've ever seen that felt like it had actual effort put into it. Not only is the animation decent compared to the likes of other Disney DTV trash (Belle's Magical World **vomits**), but the plot, while not perfect, seems well thought out also. The plot goes like this: Pooh and his best friend Christopher Robin spend every day playing together in the Hundred Acre Woods, but all of that changes when Christopher Robin disappears without a trace! They misread the note that Christopher left for Pooh, and determine that he has been kidnapped and taken away by the evil ""Skullosaurus"". Thus, Pooh and friends set out on their titular Grand Adventure, to rescue their friend from certain doom. Another way the movie threw me off guard, is how dark and scary it can be at times! I soon lost count of how many times the character's lives were seemingly in danger, whether they were falling from high distances, or hanging on for dear life to prevent the former. When Piglet is dangling from a tree, Tigger tries to comfort him by saying that falling from a large height is just like falling out of bed; the only difference is the ""splat"" at the end. There's even a scene where they all go over a cliff! When the movie isn't busy being dark and scary, it's sad and depressing. Eeyore's outlook on life is bleak, which, to be fair, is true to his character, but the characters all end up losing faith in themselves. Piglet loses his (already flimsy) ability to be brave. Tigger loses faith in his bouncing ability, even submitting to certain death when he feels he can't bounce to safety. Rabbit decides he isn't smart enough to find Christopher. Pooh is the only one who has received the advice from Christopher that they need to keep going, but he can't remember what it is, in typical Pooh fashion. Even Pooh gives up, singing a song in which he reveals that his heart is about to break. Pooh is also surprisingly inconsiderate of others in this movie; when Christopher needs to tell Pooh something important, Pooh tells him that it can wait ""forever and ever"". So you're probably asking yourselves: ""With all of the depressing and scary material in a Winnie the Pooh movie, how could anyone give this a 5 star review?"" Well, the movie manages to put the characters in these situations, while keeping all of the charm one should expect from Winnie the Pooh. Buy this movie for its charm, its humor, its compelling story, and its heartfelt message; that you're braver than you believe, that you're stronger than you seem, and that you're smarter than you think. But don't buy it for the music; only one song is half-way decent, and even then, it's not memorable.
*Edit* (7/4/14): I just noticed this now. Even though I wanted to review the VHS version, my review ended up being for the DVD version instead. Whoopsies! Anyway, I just wanted to point that out, because I have no idea what special bonuses come on the DVD, although I'm guessing they must be worth it, since this was the first Winnie the Pooh movie to get a special edition DVD. I'm sure the DVD version also has improved picture and sound quality, but the songs aren't worth a quality boost anyway. Buy whichever version is more convenient for you.",1400976000,,3304,4.630323679727428

None of the gang have a lot of confidence in themselves (Tigger in his jumping, Rabbit in is map authority, Piglet in his fear of heights, Pooh in remembering). Therefore, a majority of the film is spent with Pooh & friends doubting themselves in scary situations.

I understand that the point of this comes at the end (spoiler: they find Christopher Robin - or rather, he finds them). The gang can do whatever they set their minds to, without Christopher Robin's help & all the scary situations the majority of the movie is immersed in was mostly just a figure of the gang's over-active imagination. Yet, so much time is spent in the dark, scary, and frankly depressing parts, that this last revelation would be lost on almost all.

In conclusion, this is not your typical Pooh movie. I would absolutely not recommend it to kids who are Pooh fans regardless of age, but if you have a die-hard fan - use parental discretion. It is definitely a scary Pooh movie.",1392854400,,1570,4.52112676056338

858995,4,6304400381,"I've seen this years ago and used to own it on VHS. It's been years and I've not been able to get it on DVD until now. This movie picks up where the old Winnie the Pooh shorts left off. In fact the beginning of the movie is pretty much the ""last chapter"" of the original shorts.

In this movie, Christopher Robin goes to school for the first time, and this means he cannot be in the Hundred Acre Wood with his animal friends. However, when he tries to tell them not to worry, via a note, it is misread and the animals of the Hundred Acre Wood begin to panic, as they believe Christopher Robin is in danger from the evil Skull-a-Saurus at the horrid Skull [School].

I think the story was very cute and plays well with the original. It's obviously got a slightly more updated feel, but the general innocence of the stories is still there. Singing? Yeah, there's that in there. It seems to be an annoying formula that anything for kids must have an annoying soundtrack. However, I will say the songs in this movie are not too annoying. In fact, at least two are very sweet (Forever & Ever and Wherever You Are) with the other songs, performed by Rabbit and Owl, are a little more corny, yet still interesting enough to keep the story moving and offer the chance of a giggle.

I love the character development in this movie. Granted, we got that in the shorts to a small extent, but we get to see a little more into the strengths and weaknesses of each of the main characters (Rabbit, Tigger, Piglet, and Pooh) with a less gloomy yet still miserable and strangely wise and uplifting Eeyore. Each of the four main characters have to face a fear or weakness without the aid of Christopher Robin, allowing them, like Christopher Robin, to grow up a little more from the experience and learn new things.

It's a fun movie for kids and nostalgic adults. I was so excited to finally get a copy on VHS in the day and I'm excited to get the DVD now. I hope to spend the next several years enjoying this and my other Pooh cartoons.",1348012800,4,2019,4.333333333333333

Just a little after Rabbit takes over leading and then in the cave after they split up until Christopher Robin shows up. Then when they are ready to try a little scary they can try watching the whole movie. Now as far as which is better the old Winnie the Pooh or the new I say to each his own.

859108,5,6304400381,"Synopsis: Christopher Robin is heading to school and tries to tell Pooh about it the day before he starts, but not wanting to ruin their day together, he decides not to. Instead, he writes a letter to Pooh, mentioning how he has to go to school and tells Pooh not to worry about him and attaches it to a pot of honey in front of Pooh's home. The next day, Pooh gets up and finds the jar of honey but not looking at the letter, he mistakenly pours honey all over it. He decides to find Christopher Robin to share his honey, but cannot find him. Soon, all the friends of the hundred acre wood get together, and Owl being the only one with somewhat adequate reading skills, wrongly reads the letter as Christopher Robin going to ""Skull"" and that he needs help from his friends! Soon, the group decides to go on a journey to ""The Great Unknown"", where they think they will find Christopher Robin in the eye of the skull.

Review: I don't know where there are so many negative reviews regarding this movie. I thought this movie was great! As someone who grew up watching the cartoon series during the 80s-90s, I thought this was a great movie adaptation that adults as well as children would enjoy. Sure, there are some scary parts to it, but without the dilemma the characters are in, they wouldn't realize how strong, brave or smart they are. And the movie is not entirely sad; there are some funny parts to it, like when Piglet and Pooh are caught by the butterflies and they end up falling on Rabbit. If I remember correctly, even the cartoon series had some very emotional episodes to it like ""Find her, keep her"" and ""the Wishing Bear"", so I don't know why people thought this movie would be just fun and silly throughout. The background music is wonderful and adds well to the movie, with memorable songs such as ""Wherever you are"".

I do agree that the ending is a little bit of a letdown because they build up the story in such a way that you feel that Christopher Robin really needs to be saved from the skull. Still, the ending did make sense, and overall I enjoyed it.

The ""Special Edition"" DVD also contains some bonus features such as a Game called ""Pooh and friends"", a behind the scenes look at the music called ""Pooh's Symphony"" and a bonus classic episode ""Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day"", as well as sneak peeks to other Disney DVD releases.

Overall, I think that if you are a fan of the series, and you don't mind a little emotional drama thrown into it, you will enjoy ""Pooh's Grand Adventure"".",1281657600,6,2518,4.420258620689655

Yes, the video is pretty nice, but it is too sad and scary for little kids. The part when Piglet, Tigger, Eeyore, and Rabbit think that Pooh is eaten by a skullosaurus is the saddest part of every movie I have ever watched. This is NOT a good movie for any kid. Even my 11-year old kid got emotional watching it. But the 10 minutes after the beginning of the movie is pretty funny. (The part where Rabbit slips on a pile of nuts and falls down, and more!)

We have only watched it once, but fifteen minutes into the show he had to sit in my lap and was actually shivering and wiping tears from his eyes by the time the extremly loooooong song by Rabbit about being lost and then where Tigger falls off a cliff and all the rest of them go over too.  (Which was sad, AND stupid in my opinion because the build up for it was so huge, such a long drop and so on, but when they fell they were all just fine!  SOOOOO stupid!)

The story goes from bad to worse, and more depressing with infuriating songs and repetitive plot devises.  They get lost, they get sad, they get lost-er, they get REALLY sad, all of them think they are worthless, then they get separated and lost AGAIN...you get the message...lame and depressing.

If you are a Pooh expert, maybe this movie thrilled you.  But if you have a shivering child in your lap who is trying not to cry...well, it's just sort of a nightmare.  We will not be watching this movie again.  Go get the Word Adventure or the original movie or series.  Or just go enjoy the books together!",1249171200,3,1315,4.348360655737705
859252,4,6304400381,"Pooh's Grand Adventure - The Search for Christopher Robin is one hour and sixteen minutes long and was released on video on August 5, 1997. The movie starts out with Christopher Robin trying to tell Pooh some unhappy news. Pooh does not want to hear and says it can wait till later. Nightfall comes and Christopher Robin still has not told Pooh the unhappy news. Pooh wakes up the next day and find a honey pot at his door with a note attached to it. Pooh does not see the note and starts to take some honey out of the pot; this causes the note to get honey it. Pooh has a change of heart and starts looking for the ownership of the honey. He first meets Piglet who is trying to overcome his fear of heights but fails and Tigger offers to rescue him. The three of them, along with Eeyore, winds up in Rabbit's vegetable garden. Rabbit sees the letter that Christopher Robin has left and is unable to read it. Rabbit suggest that they visit owl. Once a Wol place, he tries to read the letter but misreads it. Wol believes Christopher Robin has been taken to an evil mountain call Scool. Wol draws a map and Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, Tigger and Eeyore are off to find Christopher Robin. The five get lost in a thorn bush, falls off a cliff, and get lost in a fog. Once at Scool Mountain their adventure looks like an Indiana Jones quest on a kid's level. Also we are meant to believe the adventure took several days. In the end it is Christopher Robin who finds them and rescue Pooh. Christopher Robin tells the group that he has gone to school and Pooh should help himself to the honey pot. In the end Pooh and Christopher Robin are sitting in their favorite spot at the end of the movie. I think this movie, which is done something like a musical, could have had a better story to it. Pooh's Grand Adventure - The Search for Christopher Robin gets a B+.

I had not read any reviews before buying it and was very surprised at how dark and scary it was.  I had to turn it off and won't let my daughter see it again. If you are looking for something Pooh bear, happy and educational, go with the new My Friends Tigger and Pooh DVD. It came out at the beginning of March 08 and has 3 episodes (2 stories each).

859257,5,6304400381,"This is, as someone else has already stated, the best Winnie the Pooh film since the original shorts.  Unlike the more recent sequels to classic Pooh, this film is not 'sugar-coated', and not -- thank god! -- modernized.  It can be quite dark at times, even spooky, but still, it is superb.  Some say it's too scary for young children.  I disagree completely.  The forest of thorns is a lot like Rabbit lost in the mist, from the shorts, and yet people yammer on about how horrific it is.  Falling off the cliff IS a bit much, but you know everyone will be fine, since there's still half the movie to go.

Among other things I like about this movie are the songs, which are not painful to listen to, and are actually really good.  My favorite is Adventure Is A Wonderful Thing, where Owl freaks out Pooh and his pals by singing about the monsters and horrible deaths they are sure to meet.  (""You'll never want to come home.  Maybe you never will!"")  I love that line!  A close second is the Map Song, where Rabbit explains to his befuddled comrades that ""a thought's not fit to think 'til it's printed in ink"" and refuses to believe that the map Owl drew up is 'nothing' like the actual landscape.  He ends up getting hopelessly lost, of couse, which shows the value of not believing everything you read.

In short, Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search For Christopher Robin is a glorious animated film, one families will cherish for years to come.

859258,5,6304400381,"I have been a fan of the Winnie the Pooh films for many years. This one falls near the top of my list. I love it.

 In the film,Pooh and the others discover that Christopher Robin is missing. The story then follows their subsequent search for him for they believe that he is in danger.

 I personally have never met a child who was scared of this film. However,as a precaution,there are certain sequences that may frighten extremely Piglet-like little children. I would not worry about it much though.

 Also,one reviewer complained of some of the song lyrics being inappropriate. They should all be fine for the average child. Do not be too uptight about it. If your child can view the The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh TV series,they should be able to view this film.

 Moving on,my warnings are just a precaution for any more sensitive viewers. I have not one bone to pick with this film. I loved it. The story is great,the music is wonderful,and while the animation is not the best,it is pleasant to watch. I highly recommend this movie for anyone's DVD collection.

859259,4,6304400381,"Christopher Robin tries to tell Pooh that he is going to go somewhere.  However, the subject just fails to arrive.  Instead, Christopher Robin leaves Pooh with these wise words:  You're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.  Little does Pooh realize that these words will soon have significant meaning for him.

The next morning Pooh wakes to find a jar of honey outside his tree.  Pooh begins to dip into the honey, but then has second thoughts as he considers whether the honey might belong to someone.  Unfortunately, Pooh's dip into the honey obscures the writing on a note attached to the side of the honey.  Pooh and his friends eventually discover the night and attempt to decipher it, only to learn that Christopher Robin has somehow gone to ""skull"" and will not be returning.  There is only one thing that Christopher Robin's friends can do:  they must go on a quest to find Christopher Robin.

Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Eeyore and Rabbit set off to ""skull"" to find Christopher Robin.  Unfortunately, Rabbit's map skills are insufficient to the task of finding ""skull,"" and the world outside the hundred acre wood is big and scary.  One might wonder how Pooh and his friends will conquer gaping chasms, monsters, and dark scary caves.  Where is Christopher Robin!  Wherever he is, his friends will rescue him!

This animated 1997 movie was direct to video.  However, the quality of the story and the animation are good, and this movie is captivating.  I believe this movie might have done well as a theater release.  I think fans of Pooh and his adventures will enjoy this family friendly movie, and families with young children will want this movie for their film libraries.

859376,2,6304400381,"When Pooh misreads a note saying Christopher Robin has gone to school,he sets off to rescue his friend. The plot is predictable, and frankly, a bit dull. Many reviewers have said the movie scared their small children,and I can almost see why. While Pooh is exploring a cave,we hear ''spooky'' echoes and mysterious growling in the distance. Pooh falls from a tall height and into a murky swamp. And yet,during all this,the film has a cartoonish tone so none of this events are truly disturbing,however scary they may seem. It feels no soul has gone into the songs, they are bland,cheesy and forgettable,as is the story.

859379,5,6304400381,"My 23-month old son loves this movie!!  As I watched it the first time with him, I was a bit concerned that parts of it might be too scary for him, so I paid attention to his reactions and also talked to him about what was happening in some of the scarier parts.  He was not disturbed at all by any of them and I feel comfortable letting him watch it on his own if I have something that I need to do in the next room.  I realize that some parts of it may be too scary for some children (I would have been one of them at that age!), but I think that most parents have a good idea of what their child can handle, and it's always a good idea anyway to watch a new video with your child the first time through.  That way you can stop it if it seems to be too scary or have other material that your child really isn't ready for.

But, back to the movie!  One of my son's favorite parts is watching Tigger try and bounce really, really high (he's into jumping just now) and he always laughs to see Tigger bounce.  I was amazed that my son was actually paying attention through the whole movie.  There were very few parts where his attention wandered, and it never wandered far.  With other kiddie movies of similar duration, he tends to wander off to do something else after about a half hour or so (which isn't a bad thing, either).  All in all, I think this is a very enjoyable film for both children and the adults that may watch it with them.",1151280000,3,1440,4.056537102473499
859380,1,6304400381,"We have Piglets Big Movie which is an absolute favorite of my 2 year old. So being the sweet mother I am, I bought her this movie.  It petrified her.  It required constant narrative on my part to explain away the disturbing scenes - which predominate the film. It is dark and scarey, and slow, and depressing.  The ending might be great but we only got through a half an hour of the movie - waiting for the tone to change.  It didn't.

The movie will be put away for years to come if I don't sell it at a yard sale first (which I likely will do - because I couldn't stand to watch it either).",1143244800,16,592,4.0256410256410255
859381,2,6304400381,"I grew up with the original Winnie the Pooh movie ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" and loved it as a child. ""Pooh's Grand Adventure"" was not in keeping with the spirit of the first movie.

The song at the beginning with Pooh and Christopher Robin might be considered cute by some, but I found it way too sappy and very difficult to watch. In the original, you know Christopher Robin and Pooh love each other because there is a genuine concern for each other and they want to help each other, etc.  I like the ""understated"" sense of love much better than the ""in-your-face"" kind that this new movie portrays.

Every song in this movie annoyed me.  Owl's song about adventure was pure punishment to listen to.  The entire quest they go on is dark, except for the part where the butterflies try to fly off with Piglet.  That part was just plain weird, but it was about the only part my son (3 years) liked.  Too much of the movie is dark and scary for little ones, and of course, in keeping with recent Disney tradition, there's a very blatant ""moral to the story"" that you are required to learn.  Why can't it just be simple and fun?  Have they ever heard the phrase, ""Keep it simple stupid""?  Why do they have to mess up a good thing?

The plot is one we've all seen before.  How many cartoons are there about animal friends or characters going on a quest and conquering their fears and learning about their inner strengths?  I'd say way too many.  The dialogue is flat and lacking of humor or wit.  The characters just aren't the same -- not the whimsical, witty characters I remember.  I thought this movie was never going to end, and my son ended up getting up and leaving the room long before it was over.

If you are a die-hard fan of the old ""Pooh Bear"" movie, my advice is to stay away from this disappointment.  If you really don't care one way or another, you may enjoy this.  I agree with parents that say this scared their kids.  It would have scared me as a kid, and my son ran out of the room during the scary parts, which are many.  Rent it, screen it without your kids, and then decide if you want to waste your money and buy it.",1142467200,6,2151,4.274752475247524

We rented this great-sounding movie to watch with our 4-yo daughter as she has wanted to watch a Pooh movie.  While this movie starts out wonderfully with a great scene and song about friendship between Christopher Robin and Pooh, the bulk of the movie is spent with Pooh and friends looking for Christopher Robin.  During this time, the 100-acre wood is made to seem like an extremely dark and scary place, which we were not expecting, and the tone seems to get progressively more gloomy. We told my daughter that it would get better, but it got to the point where a despondant Pooh sings a sad song and my daughter just started bawling, and asked ""When are they going to get out of there???"".  The ""good parts"" of this movie at the beginning and end don't begin to balance the long sad part through the majority of the rest.",1139788800,20,905,4.533742331288344
859499,5,6304400381,"This and THE TIGGER MOVIE are the two best Winnie The Pooh movies.

Here we have POOH'S GRAND ADVENTURE: THE SEARCH FOR CHRISTOPHER ROBIN (UK title: Winnie The Pooh's Most Grand Adventure). The animation is definitely television standard, but the story and songs are of a very high quality indeed.

This straight to video sequel picks up right where the original

big screen film THE MANY ADVENTURES OF WINNIE THE POOH left off. Winnie The Pooh and Christopher Robin are hanging out together. They enjoy each other's company. They can do anything and nothing together as bestest friends. The next day Christopher Robin goes off to his first day at school. He leaves a note on Pooh's hunny pot so Pooh will know where he is. Unfortunately the hunny somehow falls on the note making the letters and words on the note hard to read- not that Pooh and the gang could read anyway. Due to this, Pooh and friends believe the word ""school"" says ""skull"" and that Christopher Robin has been kidnapped. Thus they begin a perilous journey across the Hundred Acre Wood.

The message of this movie is made very clear for young and old alike. And I don't mean because it says it on the video packaging. It really resonates with all of us- at least it did with me. I remember it very well- ""You're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think"".

Fans of the classic Pooh cartoons (""Blustery Day,"" ""Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree,"" ""A Day for Eeyore"" and the like), and of ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" will love it. Wonderful songs embellish this perfectly created Pooh story. Some complain that it is dark, scary, and such. Certain parts are, but definitely not overly so. It's necessary to the plot and the message of the film; not every second is 'terrifying' and even for young children, no scene should be too 'scary.' The sad emotional quality of this movie sets it apart a little bit too, but again, it is not too sad for kids, nor is it much more 'depressing' than many other Pooh tales. There is a happy ending with a fun song just as should be expected. From beginning to end 'Pooh's Grand Adventure' is truly grand and should not be missed; the only possible problem I can see is the disclusion of Gopher!",1118534400,21,909,4.515151515151516

But after watching it recently with my second child and listening more intently to the dialogue and words of the songs, I realized what an excellent vehicle it is for teaching children about trusting in themselves.  The movie is HIGHLY entertaining to my kids, who are currently ages 3 and 7. They laugh and sing the songs and dance throughout the movie. And the message is quite motivational.  Each character goes through a process of facing their own personal insecurities -- but by the end they find and celebrate their unique inner strengths.
The lesson is one we could all use -- believe in you self and you can overcome any obstacle.  I wish they would make a movie like this for us adults!",1012867200,6,817,4.5
859504,2,6304400381,"Taken on its own modest merits, this movie isn't really that offensive.  Rated against similar animated fare for children available on video, it neither stands out as a must see, nor as something to be avoided at all costs.  A cast of animal characters sets out to find their human child friend, leading to the standard sort of adventure, brushes with danger, lessons and morals well learned, etc.
 What sets off people such as myself, or at least what reveals us as inflexible purists, is the identity of the set of animal characters being used here.  This is the Winnie-the-Pooh gang:  the bear himself, with Piglet, Tigger, Rabbit and Eeyore.  We remember these characters from older (1960s-1970s) animation, also by Disney (three shorts eventually combined to make the feature The Many Adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh); some may even remember the A.A. Milne books, with illustrations by Ernest Shepard, that served as the original inspiration for the Disney productions.  Poohs Grand Adventure sullies them both.
 It sullies the originals by rendering them equivalent to any other cast of characters designed for children, by sending them through generic adventures that could just as well have been braved by other, less cherished figures.  It sullies them by ignoring the entire basis for the Pooh stories:  these were, after all, originally just a set of imagined tales involving a group of stuffed animals belonging to one boy, Christopher Robin Milne.  In the original Disney shorts, and thus in Many Adventures, the milieu (the Hundred Acre Wood) was carefully maintained and the sorts of adventures the characters actually had were limited to what a young boy, or his father, might imagine happening to them in their homes within that milieu.  This video sullies the originals as well in pasting on those pernicious elements that modern Disney productions just cant seem to avoid:  lessons and morals.  Part of the whimsical fun of the earlier Pooh shorts was the absence of anything remotely didactic in nature.
 Poohs Grand Adventure is just thatthe sort of hyped, epic exploratory venture that these characters were never meant to undertake.  If you can ignore the fact that the characters are Pooh and Company, you might still enjoy it, although it is at root mediocre stuff; otherwise, don't ruin your memories of the original.  As for your children, who you're probably buying this for anyway, your only considerations are (1) Do they care?  (2)  Do you care if they care?",1002153600,11,2487,5.066339066339066
