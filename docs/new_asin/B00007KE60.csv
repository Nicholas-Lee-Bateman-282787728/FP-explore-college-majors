7977352,5,B00007KE60,"Elie Wiesel reflects on his life from his birth and early years in Sighet, Romania, Auschwitz Concentration Camp, Paris after WW II, Israel and finally settling in New York. As he was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize, he felt that it was not for him, but for his Jewish brethren who could no longer speak for themselves. He and his wife founded 2 centers in Quiryat Mal'aki in Israel for the children of the Ethiopian Jewish immigrants who couldn't help their children with their homework in what was almost a new century for them.
  An especially moving segment occurs when he returned to his boyhood home of Seghet, Romania and digs up a gold watch that his Grandfather had given him a gold watch for his Bar Mitzvah and the night before being deported each member of the family had buried something in the yard. He explained that it was there waiting for him all these years when no one else did, and for some unknown reason, he reburied it.
  The tragedy of September 11, 2001 made him sad, wondering if the hatred that had haunted the 20th Century would continue to be a problem in the 21st Century.
  This film should make us all conscious of the need to learn from the past so that we will not be forever condemned to relive it.",1403654400,,1237,4.451327433628318

If you want to know more about those who survived the Holocaust, living on to chronicle their experiences, Ellie Wiesel's story is the one you want to know about.",1381622400,,266,4.804347826086956
7977354,5,B00007KE60,"I use this to teach ""Night.""  It reminds my students that resiliency more than natural intelligence or talent is what makes someone successful.  In Wiesel's case, as with all survivors, resilience is a gross understatement.",1374624000,,223,5.3428571428571425
7977355,3,B00007KE60,"This video was used in a 9th grade classroom, but it's not very engaging for students.  It's hard for students to follow.  This is geared for adult viewers.",1368662400,2,156,4.535714285714286
7977356,4,B00007KE60,"The content of this video is wonderful. My students just finished reading Night, by Elie Wiesel. I was hoping that this could help enhance their understanding of the themes involved with with Wiesel's experience. My students had a hard time understanding Wiesel, and being 15 year olds in their 1st period on a Friday, they weren't willing to try to understand it. Next year I will show it again, but have some questions for them to answer so they actually try to understand. I will check out the PBS supplemental items as well.",1350864000,4,528,4.688172043010753
7977357,5,B00007KE60,"This is an excellent portrait of Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel. It includes archival photographs, a narrative of portions of Wiesel's writings (read by actor William Hurt) and an interview with Wiesel himself.

We see Wiesel talking w/ one of his classes at Boston University, and hear him speak of the events in his extraordinary life. He talks of the horrors of Auschwitz, and of what happened to him when the war ended. He also comments on the abuse of religion to justify acts of terrorism on 9/11, and speaks out against racial and ethnic hatred, regardless of the source.

Two remarkable stories, which I will quote as best as memory will allow: ""When the American soldiers came and liberated the camp, they first cried when they saw what was happening there. Then they started cursing, really cursing at all humanity, and their curses were like prayers.""

""In 1995, I went back to Sighet, the city where my family lived when the war began. I saw the train station, and I went back to the house where we lived. It was late at night when I went through the gate. It had the same squeak I remembered as a child. The night before we knew we were going to be taken away, we each buried something. I buried the gold watch my grandfather had given me for my Bar Mitzvah. I remembered how I had buried it under a certain tree. I dug with my hands and found it there. It was dirty, and I brushed off the dirt. Then, I do not know why, but I put it back, and covered it again. It is still there.""",1133740800,18,1494,4.386281588447654
