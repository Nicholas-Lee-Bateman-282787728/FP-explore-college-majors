7357289,3,B012O5JW9S,"ok, here goes:  strangely, this show was so different that I actually found myself pulling for the director/male lead; it's easy to tell that he's working on a dime store budget here, but that doesn't slow him down one bit.  however, be forwarned:  it's chance taking construction (to the extreme) is at times a little off-putting and there are far too many camera-lingering scenes.  my advise is to ""check your preconcieved film making notions at the door"" and just go with it, as it is definitely filled with new filming ideas.",1471219200,4,529,4.78021978021978

7357292,1,B012O5JW9S,Awful.  It features a protagonist that is so vulgar and annoying that I could only take 20 minutes of it. There wasn't one person in this film I felt engaged with or gave a rat's patootie about. Not a good thing for a film script.  Amateur time.  I wasted $2.,1460419200,2,259,4.14
