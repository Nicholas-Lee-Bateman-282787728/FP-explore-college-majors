7321375,4,B0112HPUW2,"It is sad to think that this is Robin Williams last film. The film I s sad and melancholy, although it does pick up by the end. Robin plays, Nolan, a quiet,reserved man who has worked in the same bank for 25 years. He is married to an undemanding,quiet wife, played by Kathy Baker. His best friend is played by Bob Odenkirk, a professor who has not found his dream.

Nolan lives a comfortable life. He drives a Mercedes. He visits his father who lives in a nursing home. It seems their relationship was not one of great love, but of responsibility. Nolan lives his life quietly, but he has a secret. A secret he has carried for years and has repressed. One day he takes some action, and his secret is revealed to some. The most important aspect is that Nolan may be on his way to finding some happiness.  A bank promotion is offered, but is Nolan ready?

This film brings Robin Williams back to his quiet reserved character. He plays it beautifully, but it does not give the film much life. At times I was hoping the film would hurry along. The writing is exceptional, the acting superb, good-by Robin Williams.

7321376,4,B0112HPUW2,"""Sometimes it's nice to be somewhere else."" Nolan (Williams) has a great wife and a huge promotion coming at his job. He has everything going for him, but he has been keeping a secret from everyone his whole life. When he meets Leo (Aguire) he finally finds a way to be himself, but he still struggles with revealing himself. There are some movies that are made better by casting choices. There are some things that a person is the perfect choice for and you can't imagine watching it without them (Gandolfini in the Sopranos). This movie is the rare combination of those plus real world events that makes the movie actually transcend the screen and makes it feel more real and it has that much more of an impact. In this movie Robin Williams plays a character that struggle with something that he has to keep hidden from everyone while trying to be who they want him to be. The fact that he himself was trying to hide depression from everyone while trying to still be ""Robin Williams"" really adds an extra dimension to the character and makes the movie all the more emotional. The movie itself if just OK, but the real world events are really what makes this a movie to watch. Overall, very poetic that this is the final live action Robin Williams movie. It is almost his way of telling us how he was dealing with his problems. For that reason I recommend this. I give this a B+.",1440979200,26,1380,4.458498023715415
7321377,4,B0112HPUW2,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview (dot) com says: Robin Williams performance in Boulevard is the antithesis of who he created in The Bird CageIn Birdcage he brought us a lovable flamboyant life-loving stereo-typical (easy-to-accept for the masses) openly proud gay male in an openly proudly gay neighborhood. In Boulevard, he is very calm, in a quiet near-stifling neighborhood. Williams plays Nolan, a marriedfor-ever closeted 60 year-old man working an equally soul-crushing manila-envelope job, to match, as we discover, his deeply unfulfilled life.

That is until one evening returning home from his fathers sick bed, he takes a road unknown. Then he makes a U-turn to meet a young male prostitute.

What follows is remarkable subtle realism Williams brings to his character. The viewer is privy to a mans opening. Nolan slowly realizes he has had enough shame. Enough living what others expect or want.

Kathy Baker is the wife. And in one very telling culmination scene, she lays out truths about herself, her selfishness and her cruelty.

Bob Odenkirk, the best friend, provides some humor and ultimately shows what a true friendship means, while he slowly accepts his own real.

Boulevards story moves along slowly, and its content true-played and deep; which makes it a not for all again viewing experience. For those into the human dramas, Boulevard becomes a quietly roaring emotional roller coaster that Williams chooses to ride serenely with his undercurrent a bouncing twelve year old whipping around new corners.

Ultimately, the film shares both how difficult Nolans truth is to bring out to the world and to keep viewers in touch with the long-time awakenings he is finally allowing to be seen. And, reminds every viewer of our great loss of a true American mega-talent.",1439942400,8,1785,5.159169550173011
7321378,4,B0112HPUW2,"BOULEVARD was one of Robin Williams final films.

In it, he delivers a brilliant performance as a married, but closeted, sixty-year-old bank employee whose life changes when he meets and takes a special interest a young street hustler (Roberto Aguire).  Williams may be on a journey of self-discovery, but along that difficult road, his well-structured life begins to fall apart.

Director Dito Montiel has turned Douglas Soesbes screenplay into an excellent,  albeit humorless, film.  Aguire and the supporting cast, which includes Kathy Baker (as Williams wife), Giles Matthey and Bob Odenkirk, are flawless and many of the scenes crackle with raw emotion.

That said, I must admit that, despite its somewhat uplifting ending, BOULEVARD is one of the most depressing films I have ever seen.  Like the equally superb SOPHIE'S CHOICE, I doubt if I would ever want to see it again.

On DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment.

7321379,5,B0112HPUW2,"well I lied , I haven't seen this yet, but my research explained despite Robin Williams vast millions and a truly expansive California mansion on the ocean, countless fans, a wife and family couldn't prevent his suicide due to his various ailments including Parkinson's, dementia, depression. countless pharma drugs, substance abuse. But my point here is this movie was the fast lane to his final hours. Update; I have seen this and its disturbing. possibly disturbing enough to put Williams in a bad  mind set. . this was his final countdown. and I do recommend seeing this last performance.",1439078400,3,592,4.97979797979798
7321380,2,B0112HPUW2,"The many belly laughs Robin Williams so ably gave us throughout his career will never be forgotten, but it was his smaller, darker, melancholic performances that really resonate. So it's fitting in a way that his final on-screen role (he voices a dog in a Monty Python comedy later this year) would be a downbeat film like Boulevard, the latest indie effort from Fighting and A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints director Dito Montiel. It's the kind of somber mood piece that Williams came to be known for, and he proves once again how great of a talent he truly was, even if the film's content is thin, its revelations unsurprising, and the tone too somber to be fully enjoyed.

Williams plays Nolan, a 60-year-old man who has lived his entire life just being comfortable. He works in a boring job as a banker; his wife Joy (Kathy Baker) sleeps in a separate room and they seem to barely communicate; and he occasionally checks in on his hospitalized, catatonic father even though they never got along. It's ""what you're supposed to do"" he rationalizes, putting the outward appearance of his actions at the forefront. It's all about appearances for Nolan, who would rather not stir the pot than do anything that would truly make him happy.

See, Nolan is secretly a homosexual, and the gist of the film is him trying to come to grips with that fact. In 2015 and so recently having seen gay marriage legalized across the country, it feels a bit old-fashioned to have a film about a person realizing their own homosexuality. But that really is the entirety of the story penned by Douglas Soesbe, who gives Nolan a gay prostitute named Leo (Roberto Aguire) to fall in love with. Nolan picks him up on the boulevard, but he doesn't want sex. He's content to merely talk with and gaze into the eyes of the anxious young man, who can't understand what this older, obviously gay man truly wants. Their encounters are frequent, Nolan lavishing Leo with money, gifts, and even a job offer to get him off the streets. He wants to save this young man in lieu of saving himself.

Naturally this all builds to Nolan coming to accept the truth about himself, but the screenplay fails to show how Leo helps to make that happen. Better are the scenes between Nolan and the long-suffering Joy; both of them denying the truth in a shroud of comfortable lies. Williams is terrific, offering another sensitive, understated portrayal that many others would have oversold. But the story lacks any real teeth. There's nothing that suggests why the stakes are so high for Nolan now after all of these years. There's also a frustrating lack of sexuality which is weird for a movie about a person's sexual identity. Boulevard is just sad, in more ways than one. While the film is well beneath his talents, Williams reminds us one final time how deeply his absence will be felt.",1439078400,4,2850,4.673306772908367

7321432,2,B0112HPUW2,"The swan song film of one of my childhood favorites will probably never rank as one of my favorite films of his. With more conservative people, the subject matter will be highly controversial. But in Robin Williams' third outing as a homosexual character, he gives a formidable performance in bleak atmosphere, and one does get a sense of how repressive the atmosphere of his life is.
  Filmed in various Nashville locales,  this is a movie that empathizes with those who struggle with their sexuality, but it shows the heartbreaking consequences of shaking off  an outward show of respectability to address that issue.
  San Francisco's beloved adopted son plays Nolan Mack, a respectable banker who has been married to his wife, Joy(Kathy Baker) for about 30 years. Life revolves around what has become a platonic union, taking care of his incapacitated widowered father, Lionel(the late Gary Gardener) in the hospital, and occasional dining with good friends, Winston, (Bob Odenkirk), and the Beaumonts(Henry Haggard and Sondra Morton Chaffin), until one evening while driving home, Nolan takes, what is literally and figuratively, and unexpected turn, when he turns on a street to consort with some prostitutes on a boulevard, nearly running over a male prostitute.
  I have observed how in his often rapid-fire comedy routines, Robin had specific go-to names for various characters he created. A wife was usually ""Helen"", a son, ""Tommy"", and the occasional gay character mentioned would be called ""Leo"".
  The Leo in this piece is played by a distant and nonchalant Roberto Aguire, whom as this movie unfolds, will wreak havoc on Nolan's life during the course of their sexless relationship, and reject Nolan's kindness to him as he offers the young hustler a chance to reform.
  Parts of this movie could best be described as outright vile, but the sad thing is how this film really makes an astute viewer aware of Robin Williams' physical decline. We see the stiffness of his right side, the tremors while he is on the phone in the scene where he gets into a fight with Leo's pimp, Eddie(Giles Matthey), and we hear the thinning of Robin Williams' already characteristically gentle voice--all of which are symptoms of the Parkinson's  disease that was diagnosed when he was alive, as well as the posthumously  diagnosed diffuse Lewy Body Dementia that was slowly claiming him. One feels that given his condition, this would have been his last film regardless of whether or not he had made the fateful decision to permanently cure all his earthly afflictions by his own hand the summer before this was released.
  The redeeming scenes are those of the genuine compassion Nolan displays for Leo at certain moments, which are reflective of the genuine real-life compassion the great humanitarian often displayed towards those who were suffering.
  A poignant moment of profound drama occurs when Nolan outs himself to his father while tending to him, recalling the childhood experience that left him with no doubt about his sexuality, and despite his inability to speak, we know perfectly well what Lionel Mack's stance is on that issue.
  Others in the cast include Steven Randazzo , as the bank's security guard, Walt, and  the late  Tennessee-born actress, J. Karen Thomas as the Mack's friend, Cat, whose small roles round out this nearly 90-minute piece  as the main characters are forced to take drastic turns as a result of Nolan's drastic turn, reassessing their lives, and via some heartbreak, decide where their loyalties lie.
 Given the terminally ill state of three of the actors, who have all since passed on, one does get a sense of something dying during the course of viewing this movie.
  It's not uplifting; just a depiction of certain truths about certain people, and a sobering final look at a beloved onscreen figure.",1458864000,2,3842,5.0395569620253164
7321433,5,B0112HPUW2,VERY GOOD,1458777600,,9,4.0
7321434,3,B0112HPUW2,"Boulevard does very little.  It's one of Robin's least interesting movies if you ask me.

It's about Robin realizing he always had a preference for men, so he eventually finds himself involved with Roberto Aguire's character one night while Robin's taking a ride down the dark part of town searching for some sexual entertainment.  The movie focuses more on Robin wanting to know Roberto's character better, but Roberto has his own problems.  He often comes off as distracted and not really caring about anything.  He's constantly owing people money and getting involved with dangerous people who criticize his preference for men and even beat on him in one scene.  As a result, even though Robin tries to get Roberto off his feet and get a job, this plan fails when Roberto refuses to show up.  He's too far gone in the head, and too involved with crime.  Boulevard should have focused on why Roberto is the way he is instead of choosing not to explain any of this.

Meanwhile Robin's keeping this big secret from his wife (played by Kathy Baker).  She comes off really understanding and polite, but as Robin's routine changes and he starts lying to her, she gradually suspects something strange is going on.  However given her polite demeanor, she doesn't say anything about it.  The relationship comes off like they're a typical older husband and wife who respect each other's secrets.  Later we find out the two have been sleeping in separate beds for a while now, and despite living under the same roof haven't exactly been together in most aspects.

As a movie Boulevard doesn't have a whole lot going for it.  It's not a good sign when the most interesting characters are Robin's boss who always seems to be around whenever Robin's going through some personal issues and encourages Robin to talk to him about his problems, and the second interesting character is the guy who beats up Roberto that one night demanding cash.  And while the conversation between Robin and his father was the best moment of the movie, but you have to get around another movie cliche showing a parent not speaking and just lying in bed which has been done a million times in movies by now.  I don't think they even explain what was wrong with the father.

Robin's way too soft-spoken throughout the movie, and while he's doing a fine job acting because he was a terrific actor, he's working with a mediocre story which does the movie more harm than good.  More anger and tension should have developed between Robin and his wife, and especially Robin and Roberto.  Because Boulevard doesn't feel like it offers enough the way it is.",1458691200,,2616,4.745575221238938

It's a story of a man with an elderly father who he visits in a joyless nursing home and a wife with whom he shares a house but not a bed. He's a good guy, the film suggests abit taken advantage of, and that presentation, along with the sad music and Robin Williams choice to play him as a melancholy, plus knowing that Robin Williams killed himself, all combined to make it a challenging entertainment experience for me, one I was unable to complete in my first attempt, though I will try again before returning the film to the library.

7321462,5,B0112HPUW2,"Nine Things About the Film Boulevard

1. This bittersweet (but mostly bitter) drama contains one of Robin Williams's best performances ever. It is also the last movie Williams made before he killed himself.

2. Williams plays a guy named Nolan, who has been married to his wife Joy for about 30 years. But their marriage is empty and loveless (they even sleep in separate rooms). While driving home one evening, on an apparent whim, Nolan makes a U-turn on a street and looks at some street prostitutes. He meets a young male hooker named Leo.

3. Leo awakens some long-dormant feelings in Nolan, and Nolan becomes totally infatuated with Leo. Nolan doesn't need sex from Leo, but does need to be around him. Nolan doesn't really understand what it means to fall in love with a prostitute. But he does eventually understand what it means to his marriage.

4. Williams is such an incredible actor, that you can actually feel the ache in Nolan's heart. With a slight twitch of a facial muscle, a brief squint of the eyes, you understand exactly what he's thinking.

5. Roberto Aguire plays Leo. This is only Aguire's second movie, but it's an impressive performance, especially considering most of his scenes are with Robin Williams. Aguire really understands the tough vulnerability and hypnotic sadness of street hustlers. He's a beautiful man made even more beautiful because he's watching his life dreams crumble in front of him.

6. Nolan tries to save Leo from the streets, and this becomes a mirror image of Nolan's struggle to save himself. Both Nolan and Leo are unable to be emotionally available to the people that need them.

7. Those hoping for a Disney ending will be disappointed. This is not a fairy tale, not a new version of ""Pretty Woman"". On the other hand, this isn't a melodramatic Shakespearean tragedy. This is real life.

8. This movie is probably the most sensitive, realistic portrayal of this subject matter I've seen. It illustrates perfectly that sexual orientation - whether gay or straight -is not about sex. People that think it's all about the genitals are doing it wrong.

9. This movie is a restrained emotional catastrophe. It demonstrates the fact that if you want to find hope in life, you must sometimes destroy everything first. And even then, hope isn't guaranteed.",1451692800,3,2305,4.85969387755102

I was brought to tears multiple times throughout this film about a man coming to terms with his sexuality and his desire to be loved and be true to himself. Nolan and Leo are never meant to work out, but you are hopeful--almost rooting for their relationship, while equally feeling for the wife left behind. Reminiscent of the great 'Lost in Translation' starring comedy icon Bill Murray, it pairs an aging male (Robin Williams) as the sad, distant and lonely Nolan, and a younger male prostitute (Roberto Aguire) as his love interest.

Throughout the film you will find yourself sad--it's a heavy piece, but with a message that rings true--you deserve happiness, you deserve to be loved, you deserve to live a life true to yourself. This is a film Robin Williams was proud of and I'm glad it was such a moving, heartbreaking--yet hopeful--piece.",1447286400,3,872,4.845637583892618

Andrews Blu-ray Review: BOULEVARD is the fifth feature from director Dito Montiel, who has captured not only one of Robin Williams last performances, but one of his best, and is an intimate character study and as such, it is but one among many. In the case of Boulevard the elevator pitch is this: Robin Williams is 60, married to a woman, and secretly gay. His name is Nolan Mack and he has a well-payed but dull job in a small bank. As the quiet, inherently sad Nolan Mack, Robin Williams speaks multitudes while uttering very few actual words and there is not one fault in Robin Williams performance in BOULEVARD.

In BOULEVARD it is billed as Robin Williamss final swan song on-screen performance, the twinkle in his eye had faded into a dead stare. The mischievous, manic clown, beckoning us to follow him to a comic three-ring circus, has shrivelled to an unreadable automaton with cringing body language. This isn't the first film in which Robin Williams played a person with a dark secret and shrouded in mixed emotions.

After his box-office hits faded in the late 1990s, Robin Williams conspicuously turned toward low-budget indie film dramas, repeatedly playing isolated and tormented American males in films like One Hour Photo, The Night Listener and Worlds Greatest Dad. What strikes you is the similarities to those characters whether in mainstream farce or downbeat realism. The one great thing about Robin Williamss final film performance is that it shows you how BOULEVARD pays a great tribute to this actor's emotional final career's swan song. BOULEVARD, which was the late actor's ""last dramatic role,"" especially as we are informed in the Theatrical Trailer which deals in suburban malaise and repressed sexuality, especially with those time-honoured indie type films. All of us fans of this brilliant comedian come actor, thought that we would never lose this brilliant genius of Robin Williams; where he made a brilliant career out of humour we have all come to love him for it, especially every time in his tour-de-force live brilliant acts, where Robin Williams unleashed a rip-roaring physicality and especially in the film Good Morning Vietnam, where Robin Williams points out with conviction and beams like a very naughty prankster.

In BOULEVARD the director wants Robin Williams to play Nolan Mack as a worker-bee banker, but also stewing in a monotonous marriage, until he meets the male hustler Leo, which starts the long journey of Nolan Macks hushed conflicted and eventually obsessive journey towards the young hustler that sadly ends in the eventual demise of their friendship. But when Nolan Mack is supposed to stand in a corner and take sober pleasure in a half-naked man, Robin Williams allows his cautiously smitten character to crack with a smile. Later on, he rejects his wife's offer for bedroom intimacy, but Nolan Mack still loves Joy Mack, which Joy Mack does not believe, it is not really deep love but a deep friendship of love, which we see with Robin Williams giving us a slow sly grin.

The melodrama in BOULEVARD pulls him in lots of emotional directions and suddenly has a panicked attack in a race to cover his last night's tryst with the hustler, especially with the cigarette butt, and eventually we get to see a ferocious fight between his Joy and Norman, where he finally informs Joy of his solemn recollection of his closeted childhood in-between, which we see when he also tells the full hidden story of what happened when he was 12 years old, which we also experience without any words when he informs his Father of his dark secret that he has hidden from him all these years and we see his Fathers disapproval without a word ever spoken, but instead turns his head away from Robin Williams. At the centre of this brilliant tour-de-force film is one of course where Robin Williams shows us that he tries to have a spirited outlook with his cacophonous work, which we get a genial outlook throughout the film.

The film BOULEVARD gave us me the chance to see why we love Robin Williams and of course was sadly Robin Williams final curtain call and especially Robin Williams final swan song film, and I applaud Robin Williams for taking on this very delicate role in BOULEVARD and I also feel Robin Williams gave his final brilliant performance, and I suspect Robin Williams was also very proud of his acting performance and I also feel he was very courageous to take on such a role that still reflects today on what happens in real life to Husbands who have hidden sexual desires they wish they could fulfil without causing problems with their married life. And I hope at the next OSCARS that Robin Williams gets some kind of recognition at the Academy Awards which Robin Williams so justly deserves. But the question for anyone who has not seen this film in wondering if BOULEVARD is worth seeing, well it is definitely worth seeing for Robin Williams. But a great performance can only carry a film so far, and it certainly does with BOULEVARD and especially when the character Nolan Mack offers this maxim before the credits role, in saying, Maybe its never too late to start living the life you really want. Of course its a nice thought, but doesnt sound like anything a real person would say. But with the film BOULEVARD if it had anything to say for itself it does say something truly remarkable and especially when get to see Robin Williams wonderful, and truly final brilliant performance.

Blu-ray Video Quality  BOULEVARD looks absolutely stunning in making the 1080p encoded image presentation is a joy to behold. What is also makes this Blu-ray disc look equally stunning is the very respectable 2.40:1 aspect ratio. But when Robin Williams is driving about the city, the black areas are sufficiently dark and very atmospheric, especially the shadows. The palette of muted colours in his working office is off set by the darkened exteriors of the inner city where he lives. But when it comes to the outside shot images in daylight, feature some nice contrast, some wonderfully rendered shades of green and of course the blue skies. But when it comes to the close-ups of the actors, you witness all the pores, tiny facial hairs, and natural wrinkles are all totally visible. So all in all here is not much to complain about here, because BOULEVARD is one of the better looking small budget films available on this Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  With BOULEVARD has just a one audio track of 5.1 Dolby TrueHD Master Audio track, but even with is audio track, sometimes when the actors speak it is slightly muffled and definitely has no bells and whistles here and The sound mix is dialogue heavy and most of it is anchored to give the impression it was only in Stereo, but now and again we do get some ambient sounds. But the street scenes where Nolan Mack drives around before finding Leo comes alive with street noises, especially with cars honking their horns in the distance, plus we also get faint siren sounds, etc., but sadly there's little in the way of low-end frequencies to be heard. Conversations are sort of nicely positioned as is most of the dialogue is always clear, but when during where they whisper, I had to crank up the volume, but despite this, the overall performance of the audio is very nicely done. But equally what I liked about BOULEVARD is the subtle use of the very atmospheric music composed by David Wittman and Jimmy Haun, but the most haunting song that was totally awesome is when you see the credits roll up the screen and I also liked near the end, the two dedications to people who are no longer with us and of course one of those was for Robin Williams.

Finally, it was very hard and sad watching Robin Williams portray such a sad and lonely character in his final performance, especially when we all know how much he was actually suffering at the time of the filming. But despite this BOULEVARD was again Robin Williamss final swan song with a really great film in terms of revealing untold truths or trying to piece ones life back together and of course features some memorable acting performances from one of our greatest actors and comic genius of our times. For that alone it is well worth purchasing this brilliant and thought provoking Blu-ray disc. But one very big disappointment to this Blu-ray disc is that Anchor Bay / Starz Digital has decided to not supply any special features extras, especially as I would have thought that they could have done a special dedication to the late and great Robin Williams, especially from all the cast and crew involved with the film BOULEVARD. Very Highly Recommended!

I have most every movie, he ever made. comedies or drama. He was a master at both and his way of being able to just fast mode joke after joke and never disappoint, it was a ""rare"" commodity!. This is NOT a comedy, in fact is much of a depressing drama. I understand this was the last movie he filmed, before he passed. The story of a lonely man going thru a very hard time dealing with his own personality, trying to find out whom he really was as a person and scare of it at the same time to find out. I hate to say I'm not happy with the fact of this having been last film he made.
I want to make sure to say that in no way, this film was a representation of his own struggles in real life. He played this character as good as he ever was, with what script he had to work with. In the movie while trying to find himself, he finds someone whom he tries to assist as well to comprehend that person's doings and why did not have to continue in that path, but sorry to say not very successful at it, as he confused the two perhaps trying to help himself find his own way.",1447027200,2,1264,3.9803149606299213

I found myself thinking of many people I know of that same age group, who have spent decades in a loveless, separate 'marriage,' because they didn't have the drive or determination to break free and life authentic lives.  Granted, he was a very closeted gay man in this film, but the scenario is so very realistic:  two people, who have been married for years, have slept in separate bedrooms for years, and who have lived separate and independent lives, all under the guise of being married.  It's like having a roommate or a housemate, without being involved.

7321672,3,B0112HPUW2,"This is a tender movie about a man who finally comes to grips with who he is and what he wants out of life. I think the reason there are so many negative reviews is because most people can't stand the thought of Robin Williams playing a middle-aged gay man. But if you can get past that, it's actually very well done. There aren't any sex scenes though there is some cursing and, while the film is slow in the beginning, it picks up in the last 20 mins. It seems like that was done on purpose so the pace of the movie would mimic Robin Williams's character. As Nolan (the character he plays) awakens from his dull and lifeless existence, he stops plodding through the motions and so does the movie. No - this isn't going to be nominated for an Oscar or anything, but it was much better than most of the reviews indicated.",1443916800,,821,4.269230769230769

""I don't have the support to do that.""...""But what if I die alone or strip myself of the opportunity to be in love?"". Regardless of ones beliefs on the topic, this really puts you in that later-life stage of someone who had made the decision to not act on his homosexual desires and pursue a ""normal"" life only to find he had wasted years of his life trying to be someone he was not.

Though it was very awkward, it's worth watching once just because of Mr. Williams.
When I investigated the reasoning he played this role, he said, ""It was a powerful role"".
I'll agree it's a powerful role, but the story sucks. It almost kinda justifies all of those horrible crappy-ending love stories no matter the reasoning behind them, which I don't at all agree with.

He makes the choices of the heart.
Le cur a ses raisons, que la raison ne connat point.  Descartes.  The heart has its reasons that reason does not know.  The movie is influenced by his choices, but informed in some strange way as well.  What  in your life do you regret?

Ok, I did watch it a second time and caught alot of things I missed the first time.  Will watch again and takes notes this time around on this little gem.  There is alot that will just go over many people's heads.
The two beds in two different bedrooms, the cruise, the professor, the dead end soul crushing job at the bank, a sixty year old man  that has problems expressing anything sexual ...it's clear he cares for his wife but it's a relationship they both know was based on lies.  He adores and is confused by the time he finds with his new found love... so much so that he refuses to express any sexual overtures... that it might spoil the occasions.  The boy is seen as a soul mate that never was... rather than something just sexual...oh but the desire is there ...expressed both by a youth that wants to act on it and a elder who knows it could ruin everything...just brilliant.  It's somewhat like the desire of any object we wish to have...but once we have it...it never lives up to what we first thought of it.

Watched it again...Nolan is absolutely tone deaf when it comes to sexual ques that might lead to the next step...he's too afraid too even bat much less make it to first base.  His whole life is based on a cruise that never sets sail.  He's spent his whole life trying to live a role for the professor...unfortunately he fails at that too.
The wife, the bank, the professor, the wife of the professor, Leo, the bank manager, the vice president of the bank...his relationships with all of them fail only because he fails to be honest with anyone.  Everyone gives him a chance to shine and he fails not only them but more importantly...himself.  There is always an escape hatch and he bails...every time.
  He gets frustrated with Leo but in many ways they are the same...refusing to learn or take advantage of new opportunities.
Robin left us a gift...make sure your life is nothing like Nolan's

Been thinking about this alot.  The closing scene has him as a waiter...like to think he bought into a restaurant like he mentioned to Leo.

For those that didn't like the acting...notice how he comes to life in the closing of the show.",1443225600,8,2395,4.447247706422019

Except for a few glints of RW's patented humor, he was entirely convincing as a character. I do have some problems with the script, however: His sleeping separately from his wife is never adequately explained or justified; his attraction to Leo seems to come fully-formed instead of awakening (that may be my own sensibility)-- for someone who's put his whole gay life on hold, this attraction and his admission to his father just didn't seem genuinely rooted in his personality; I couldn't fathom the friendship he has with the pompous professor -- there just doesn't seem to be any basis for it.

What is most disturbing about this film is the sadness in Williams' eyes....not from acting the part of the character in the film, but the true sadness of his soul in the last years of his life.

""Boulevard"" is a subtle telling of regret and salvation...the cast is stellar and all give emotional performances. The on-screen relationship between Robin Williams' and Kathy Baker's characters is touching and sad, almost biting in the ignorance they share living a life with one another.

The main character played by Robin only seems to find happiness in the company of a younger man who he meets by almost running him over. The casting was well done and each person played their role well, really giving me a feel for the character.

Yes, he is repressed, not just as a gay man but as a person and we understand this archetype very early in the film...which makes it much harder to watch the rest of it!!  I felt like I was beaten over the head with his inadequacies with no redemption in sight...Then we get a vignette at the end where we are to assume he lives happy ever after...huh?

The prostitute he tries to love has no love for him, not even compassion. One big down hill ride.  The upbeat guitar music at the end and suggestion that he goes on to a better life doesn't make up for the unpleasantness that came before, nor does it explain how he is going to suddenly find his way given some pretty big personality issues.

How sad to think this was his last appearance as it seems to mirror many troubling aspects of a persons life and one that is rife with choices, pain, regrets, peace of mind, rocks and hard places.  The film narrates the stagnation of a relationship while another begins to bloom.  Nolans marriage is orchestrated with such desperation tethered to an almost last ditch optimism (from his wife) and a stalwart resignation (from him).  It was moving yet disquieting when we see the regimentation and the toll it has taken on a basically innocent and honest man. Moreover how this discomfort has deeply affected a marriage that for all intents and purposes set sail with positivity and expectations.
With his newfound freedom comes the unfamiliar territory of spontaneity as well as a growing comfort with an otherwise risk adverse life.  Leo seems to sense the trepidation in their relationship and is certainly not as comfortable or smitten as Nolan is quickly becoming.  The film continues in this sea of trepidation until revelations and reality.  No spoiler alerts here  just a recommendation for a film that is thought provoking, powerfully acted and ultimately human.  Give it a try, youll be satisfied.",1441756800,3,1321,4.968181818181818

7321939,5,B0112HPUW2,"BOULEVARD will always remain a remarkable film despite the fat that it did so poorly in the theaters. Written by Douglas Soesbe and directed with immense subtlety by Dito Montiel, this film is a fitting tribute to one of Americas greatest comedians, the star Robert Williams who offers a performance that echoes the lives of many men who elect to lead their lives as gay men in the closet for whatever reason. Williams was 63 years old when he died of apparent suicide following a long struggle with depression and this, his last film, is dedicated to this memory.

Nolan Mack (Robin Williams in a performance so understated that it makes us forget during the film that he was one of the funniest crazies in the comedian arena) is 60, quietly married to an independent Joy Mack (Kathy Baker), quietly working in the same desk in the same back for years, tending his dying father, up for promotion as a bank manager, who turns down a wrong boulevard one evening  a street for hustlers and prostitutes and almost inadvertently picks up a young hustler Leo (Roberto Aquire) and begins a relationship with him, supporting him financially and with attempts to find work for him, but never having a physically consummated act  just being in the hustlers presence is enough. We discover that Nolan is gay and has known since he was twelve but elected to never acted out on it. He has a close friend Winston (an Excellent Bob Odenkirk) with whom he communicates but never admits to anyone except his barely conscious father that he is gay. How he deals with his new discovery of the life for which he has yearned is the manner in which the film plays out  his confession to Joy, the rejection by Leo who has his own interpersonal relationship issues and flaws (a very impressive bit of writing that shows the insecurities of a hustlers mindset), and the trauma that finally exposes his real identity makes for a deeply moving though very quiet story.

The film, in retrospect, seems an homage to the other side of the comedy mask Robin Williams wore. In many ways it is his Ave Atque Vale. Sensitive, subtle, deep, and heart-wrenchingly real, it is a fine yet sad way to say goodbye to Robin Williams. Grady Harp, September 15",1441411200,36,2218,4.662404092071611

I mean, yes, the man was quiet and unfulfilled, but he had such a strong immediate attachment to the first person he met, and it just didn't  ring true. Robin Williams' character seemed more than confused about his sexuality, he seemed socially inept in many ways. He took unreasonable crap from his boss, and just seemed lost. Someone was trying to drive the point home that having a late in life sexual identity problem, turns a person into a complete mess. I am sure it is a major issue, but in these times, there are so many other resources other than his bizarre journey alone. He just seemed to have bigger problems than sexual identity, and it was frustrating and clumsy, and sad. As I said, I really wanted to like it, but I just did not.

I'm glad they didn't have cliche, feel good ending with him, it was sad but believable.  I didn't want it to end, and this being my first time watching it, it seemed to end too abruptly, I wanted to see more, but then, that might have been because it was his last. ; (

I do admit though, although Robin poured his heart and soul into this movie, I read how he anguished over scenes, etc., he only could work with what was given him and being a low budget film, he did very well.

The movie explores so many levels of emotion and humanity, without over-telling them.  It was expertly done in that regard, but it is dark, and never really gets much lighter.  There are so many aspects to ponder in this movie and they were so well played that it wasn't overwhelming to include them all in one drama.  Williams does a superb job with the character of Nolan, who finds the strength to assert himself within the movie.  There's the superficial, politely civil marriage, and how some choose that life and are content to live in them (Nolan's wife) while others feel dead in them, the friend who's always ""the star"" of the relationship, who seems very shallow and self-absorbed, but ends up being more attuned and loyal than expected.  I liked the angle of Nolan wanting to help Leo, and slowly realizing Leo didn't want his help and would even exploit his kindness. That's a hard, sad reality that I felt was captured well here.",1441152000,7,1089,4.616580310880829

After his final filming of that movie, he died of a drug overdose. Robin did such an amazing performance in this movie that I wonder if he didn't really struggle with homosexuality. It's just a sad project that was his last. I didn't watch any further after he picked up the male prostitute. It defies who I believed Robin to be. I don't want to remember him any other way.

8723484,5,B0112HPUW2,"As many have said, Robin Williams, in his final performance, leaves us a truly wonderful, albeit painful gift. I put off watching this film for weeks, feeling all but certain it would be so dreadfully sad. The very versatile actor Williams gives us a glimpse into the life of a 60 year old closeted man. It is so obvious that he is screaming at the top of his lungs, please, whatever you do, don't wind up living this pathetic and false existence!!  Of course,as anyone who is living a life that is completely out of control, the sh== is going to hit the fan! It is was just inevitable, that the 2 lives were going to transverse at some point. The scene in the bank parking lot when the young man who Williams has created a secret relationship with, is there to extort $3200 dollars from Williams to get his supposed pimp to go easier on him, at least for the next 24 hours or so. Robin's characters life is on view for all to see, the bank employees and customers, are horrified at seeing the truth that this closeted man has fiercely protected. I think there is also an obvious factor that one cannot watch this film without thinking of the real life tragedy, that Williams found no other way out to his miseries, and took his own life. Robin was the absolutely perfect actor to play this part!  To me the closet has to be the saddest existence, the most
awful falsehood that can create nothing but agony, and lack of fulfillment. I was on a flight recently from Copenhagen to NYC, and encountered a young male flight attendant who was the opposite of the main character in this film. He was as proud as a peacock that he was gay, and if anybody didn't like it, too bad!  I indicated to him that I was gay too, and told him that I thought it was really great that he was being his authentic self, and he appreciated my words. The saddest individuals I have met in my life were terrified that somehow their ""dirty little secret"" of their sexuality was going to come to light. Their lives were going to come unraveled and then what were they going to do? Lying is always so much harder and far more stressful than telling the truth, and much more work! I'm not surprised this film did not do well at the box office, it is like being at the scene of a car accident where you can't bear to look, or turn away. It is so tormenting. I thought all the actors in this film were excellent. And for those of you who were hoping to see the more madcap side of Robin (Mrs. Doubtfire) in his final film , this was also Robin's gift, as someone on here wrote, he was  so understated, so completely opposite of the manic parts he has played. RIP Robin, this might be your best work of all!!",1493164800,4,2677,4.295049504950495
