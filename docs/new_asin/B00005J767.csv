1427937,5,B00005J767,"I must have seen this movie a billion and one times. I rented it from blockbuster after a friend showed it to me, and I watched it over fifty times alone in the first time I rented it. Then I re-rented it again and again and again, constantly re-playing every single scene with Slade Craven. The man is simply GORGEOUS beyond words!! Any goth girl's dream!! Tall, long black hair, pale with black makeup for a yummy effect, a long vinyl trench coat, and the most AMAZINGLY tight leather bodysuit thing in the whole world!! This movie is HIGHLY reccomended to any gal who loves goth guys. I SURE DO!..",1013558400,3,600,4.463636363636364
1427938,3,B00005J767,"First of all, how did they manage to get Joe Mantegna, Gabrielle Anwar and Craig Sheffer in this? Poor Joe must have his career on life support if he has to do this stuff.
But seriously, I actually stumbled across this on cable and actually watched it from beginning to end. The idea of having a concert on an airplane is certainly unique, albeit ridiculous one (somehow they managed to find a large stage area, with a light show and extensive props. Where??).
Anyway, the film holds your interest and there's a sense of fun about it. It doesn't take itself seriously and you find yourself actually getting caught up in it. As far as a B-MOVIE, it's not half bad.
But I'm STILL wondering how the heck they managed to stage a concert inside a 747.",1011830400,,746,4.452554744525547
1427939,1,B00005J767,"This movie has been on cable recently...and other than one actress who spent the movie parading around the airplane in tight leather pants, this movie has no redeeming qualities. The plot has a ""death"" rocker in a Marilyn Manson-type get-up boarding an airplane to give his final concert via an Internet webcast, along for the ride are a few dozen wonderfully dressed and made up ""metal-heads."" Soon all kinds of hijinx and hijacks break out as the viewer is left screaming for a parachute. Rutger Hauer makes a surprise appearance as the co-pilot; surprise, meaning that its a surprise that the same actor who flawlessly spearheaded the classic ""Blade Hunter"" years ago has found himself in this bumbling, ridiculous monstrosity. After Hauer and the plane's captain were mercifully dispatched to that great cockpit in the sky, it is up to the Manson look-alike to try and land the plane...all I could think of was when Julie Hagerty in ""Airplane"" got on the plane's intercom and asked, ""By the way does anyone know how to fly a plane?"" I would also add ""By the way, does anyway in Hollywood know how to make a movie?""",990489600,6,1118,4.768041237113402

1427961,4,B00005J767,"In most cases, I do not expect an intellectually challenging plot in ANY movie that takes case primarily on board and aircraft. This movie did not disappoint.  It was a sit down, buckle up, turn off your brain an enjoy the ride airplane genre film, made in part with Canadian taxpayer money.

The plot has been covered elsewhere. The characters, with the exception of the main rocker, were paper cutouts: the hacker (who seemed too old to me to be wearing a headband), the sexy FBI woman (who you KNEW was going to loosen her hair and take off her nerd glassed in the end) and the pierced and dyed heavy metal fans (some of Canada's finest extras, no doubt.).

But there were hints of breaking stereotypes:  The band was not doing drugs, etc., before the show.  They were eating fruits and veggies.  The main bad boy (Marilyn Manson knock-off) wasn't  a very good fighter.

I do not want to do any spoilers, but there is a sweet moment at the end where the main bad boy rips off his signature satanic medallion at a moment of real distress and asks God for help.  That may not b a big deal to you, but I was impressed.

No nudity, some violence.  Only 4 stars due to all the over done Heavy Metal fans. As is the case of movies showing hippies, they never get it right.",1403395200,,1269,4.334745762711864

All in all, I figure it's still better to watch a so-so Sci Fi/Horror movie than ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Evita"".  This movie will end up being non-memorable, but it's preferable to being in a coma.",1127001600,,380,4.463768115942029
1427967,1,B00005J767,"Slade Craven was definitely not on his game for his farewell concert. One of his strong points has always been his ""stick-to-itivism"" and single-minded, determined work ethics.

  Imagine my chagrin as he walked off after a half hearted attempt at one song (albeit a great, great ?^in' tune!).

  All that aside, Slade's gumption really ended up coming through in saving many lives by safely landing a very complex aircraft and averted an evil metaphysical event in Kansas.

  Slade dropped off the radar(no pun intended) after this heroic feat, and I have heard rumors from fellow Slade fans that he has changed his appearance so that he looks more like his high school yearbook photo, and is now persuing the ""sensitive singer/songwriter"" school of music.

  Any leads, anyone?",1104105600,2,779,5.047244094488189
1427968,3,B00005J767,"Casting Craig Sheffer in this third Turbulence movie is a little strange, considering he also starred in the second.  What's strange is that in this one he's playing an entirely different character, and it makes me wonder why they used this mediocre performer in two movies?

Anyway, in TURBULENCE 3, we get the highly improbable scenario of a Goth rocker fashioned after Marilyn Manson who is going to stage his farewell concert on board a 747.  Somehow, defying all logic, they've ""redesigned"" the plane to include this huge amphitheatre for the concert.  The music is typical heavy metal, heavily laced with violent lyrics, and Satanic undertones.  So it's not so unusual when a Satanic cult leader switches places with Slade Craven, the international rock star, and plans on hijacking the plane to Kansas (?) which is supposed to be the most evil place on earth (tell that to Dorothy and the Oz boys).  This is pretty far-fetched stuff folks.

Anyway, the requisite nonsense happens with computer hacker Sheffer and FBI agent Gabrielle Anwar helping someone fly the plane after the captain is killed and copilot Rutger Hauer offs himself.  (Don't want to spoil why Hauer harikaris or who the pilot is).

There is also a pretty good twist in the identity of one of the cult members on board.

For grade B entertainment, this movie will deliver and it does have a very effective performance by John Mann as the crazed Craven.

After viewing these three turbulent movies, my fear of flying has worsened.  Terra firma!",1101600000,,1518,4.88671875
1427969,4,B00005J767,"Believe it or not, this is actually not that bad of a film. Now, that shouldn't be taken to mean that this is a particularly good film, either but as far as implausible B-movies taking place on hijacked airplanes without pilots go, Turbulence 3 is definitely one of the better examples of the genre.

 Basically, the film deals with Slade Craven, a ""goth"" rock star that is obviously meant to conjure up memories of Marilyn Manson. Bizarrely enough, the two songs that Craven actually performs in the film are actually fairly good. Like a lot of things in this film, the songs are actually something that the producers could have easily blown off but instead, for whatever reason, they actually went to the effort necessary to keep things at least occasionally entertaining. Anyway, for some reason, Craven's latest concert is going to be a pay-per-view extravaganza held inside a 747 flying to Canada. Of course, the idea of holding a concert in an airplane while the airplane is actually in flight is nothing short of ludicrous. Of course, it's no more ludicrous than Rutger Hauer, of all people, popping up as the plane's copilot without raising anyone's suspicions. The filmmakers to their credit, don't waste any time trying to justify this insanity but instead they cheerfully embrace the silliness of it all and roll with it.

 In quick order, the flight ends up getting hijacked by your typical group of demented Satanists. While the plane's helpless passengers -- a nice combination of decadent goths, confused stewardesses, and bandmates who wouldn't be out of place in a shock rock sequel to Almost Famous -- fight for their lives, a ground-based computer hacker (Craig Sheffer) works with a tightly wound yet secretly frisky FBI agent (Gabrielle Anwar) to thwart the hijacker's sinister plans. (Those plans never quite make sense but, by this point, we've already been forced to accept the sight of a concert being held in a 747 and it's already too late to quibble about plausibility.)

 Strangely enough, this all works in it's nicely demented way. This is a fun film and, if for nothing else, it deserves credit for not insulting the viewer's intelligence by trying to be anything other than an entertaining action-comedy. The script is full of a few pithy one-liners that serve almost to satirize all the awful ""comic"" relief that audiences have been subjected to in every big-budget action film produced since the late '80s. As well, the film's actors all seem to be having fun and it comes across to the viewer. Special notice should be given to Joe Mantegna, who seems to be chanelling none other than Airplane's glue-sniffing Lloyd Bridges, as a by-the-book FBI agent, Hauer, Anwar, and, surprisingly, Craig Sheffer who, for once, manages to turn in a performance as something else than the most boring human being alive. The film's strongest peformance comes from an unknown by the name of John Mann who manages to make Slade Craven into an actual, almost compelling human being as opposed to a cardboard cut-out of Marilyn Manson.

 Turbulence 3 is the type of time waster that gives wasting time a good name.",1090972800,9,3131,4.905482041587902
1427980,5,B00005J767,"If you didn't shed at least one tear during the plane landing scene, then you truly have a heart made of stone. Singlehandedly landing a plane against all odds, with no previous piloting experience and with the lives of dozens (not to mention his own life) at stake took *tremendous courage*. Craven proves he's not the self-centered primadonna nihilist you expect him to be and really shines by the end of the movie. Although I don't want to give away the details, there is one scene that with few words, summarizes Craven's re-humanization by juxtaposing his most fearful and humble moment with an enfusion of character and strength.
Fans of the Turblulence triliogy will wonder ""where is there to go from here?"" as Slade Craven's character is arguable the most charismatic protagonist of the series. I'm expecting Craven will likely make a comeback in Turbulence IV, if not be the focus again.
I would be shocked and mesmerized if you and your family did not thoroughly enjoy this movie.",1071360000,6,990,4.863905325443787

1427984,3,B00005J767,"The movie is surprisingly okay. I liked the idea of this ""Marilyn Manson"" type character playing one of the heroes of the film who at first is against God in his music but eventually sees the light and embraces God towards the end. The only thing I didn't care for in this movie is the actor Craig Sheffer and why his character is supposed to be one of the heroes for the film...AGAIN. I say again because he is also in the first sequel to the Turbulence series yet he's playing a different character and I guess we're just supposed to forget that the actor was in the second film playing the hero?

A heavy metal concert abroad a plane..a Marilyn Manson lookalike..a rock star that is taught how to land a plane. Please! spare me.
The action sequences and dialogue are closer to comedy, not intended I tell you.
I am baffled as to what on earth Rutger Hauer, Gabrielle Anwar and Joe Mantegna are doing there???
Maybe with other less known and talented actors, the film would have been more bearable.
The only saving grace in all this mess, is watching Anwar and Monika Schnarre, two very beautiful women, but sadly the script and direction are a waste.
