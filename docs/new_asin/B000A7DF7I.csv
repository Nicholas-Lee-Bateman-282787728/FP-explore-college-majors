8075737,2,B000A7DF7I,"Good, but not for the older woman. Was much too hard on my old body. Hurts joints, makes you feel sick and dizzy.",1378684800,2,113,3.9565217391304346
8075738,5,B000A7DF7I,This exercise workout video is one of the best if you want to get in shape safely using light weight this workout is for you.,1357084800,2,125,4.04
8075739,5,B000A7DF7I,"I've done The Firm, practically ever Jillian Michaels DVD known to man, Slim in 6, and P90X. With the Slim Series, however, I am dramatically toning up. This DVD, Firm It Up, is so freakin' tough but it really hits your glutes, hips, saddlebags, thighs, and inner thighs from every angle. I'm only 4 weeks into a 6 week program, and boy howdy, my legs, booty, and hips look good!

What I love about Firm It Up is that you don't do any lunges (the bane of my existence). I love how Debbie incorporates standing and mat work as well so you don't get into the monotony of one squat sequence after another. The abs portion of the workout is also fantastic. My stomach is really getting a lot leaner and showing some definition.

I would definitely recommend Firm It Up and other Slim Series products. My advice, however, is to pace yourself. I'm not a veteran to working out by any means, but Debbie really takes things up a notch. These workouts are definitely not for newbie exercisers! Go at your own pace, listen to your body. Push pause if you need to, because Debbie doesn't really give you time to rest. You also have more reps at lower weight, but sometimes holding a half squat throughout certain moves will put strain on your lower back (as it did to me). I love the workouts and I'm still getting great results, but I do need to modify from time to time to protect my lower back.",1335139200,6,1386,4.389105058365759
8075740,5,B000A7DF7I,"I am a female in my 50s and I have fallen in love with Debbie Sieber's workout tapes. I am now the proud owner of ALL of them! I just received this tape yesterday and used it this morning. It is about 60 minutes long. You use a chair and the mat. It is a nice lower body workout! All the moves are doable, but I have to be careful on a few of them not to strain an inner thigh muscle and watch the knees on the squats. I have some of her upper body tapes that are awesome but was looking for one to concentrate on the lower body. This is it! Great workout.",1331251200,3,556,3.8017241379310347
8075741,5,B000A7DF7I,"This is a great workout of the mid-section, butt, thighs. I like how it is split up between floor work, chair work and standing work. It makes the time pass much easier and works the exact areas I need!",1322265600,4,202,4.205128205128205
8075742,2,B000A7DF7I,"I am very disappointed with this DVD.  I am at an intermediate/advanced level  and work out 7 days a week.  I have been trying to get this Slim Series for so long and when I finally got it and watched it, it was really disappointing.  It did not make me sweat,it was actually quite boring.
Debbie seemed to lack sensitivity and was just going through the motions.  I am sorry but I really and truly was hoping for more.",1288915200,2,419,4.253164556962025
8075743,4,B000A7DF7I,"I've been using Debbie Siebers workouts for a little while now and decided to recently add this to my workout library. It is around an hour long and does truly work the lower body, including abdominals. Again, I like this series because it allows you to turn off the music if you chose, plus it offers a segment and full timer, as well as green ovals to let you know when you're progressing through each segment of the workout. It concentrates a lot on the thighs, glutes, and also incorporates ab work, hamstrings, inner and outer thighs. You definitely can feel the burn with some of the segments. She is easy to follow, transitions and cues well from one exercise to the next, and often reminds about proper form and taking breaks if needed. I think this is a good addition to anyone's workout library and offers just the primary focus of lower body.",1263600000,10,853,4.545454545454546
8075744,4,B000A7DF7I,"I've been an avid exerciser for years, but hated exercise videos like the Firm. I found them very difficult to keep up with b/c I'm extremely uncoordinated. Oh how I loved my treadmill. After having two babies, my body needed a different approach to weight loss. The treadmill no longer gave me the results I needed. My best friend used this video and all of Debbie Siebers workouts and highly recommended them. She and I have a similar body-type and she (my best friend) looks AWESOME after doing these workouts (Slim Series, Slim in Six). So I decided to give them a try. I'm SO glad I did! I find the moves challenging, yet easy to follow. Debbie Siebers doesn't change choreography too rapidly (unlike the FIRM videos or other DVDs)....she challenges your body with lots of repetitive moves that get results! I could tell a difference after doing videos in this series only a few times. For the first time in YEARS, I have my waist back and am beginning to develop a six-pack. Any of these DVDs are a ""must"" if you want to sculpt your body and look good in sundresses again! :) Thanks, Debbie Siebers!!",1206403200,11,1106,4.562814070351759
8075745,5,B000A7DF7I,"This is definitely not for beginners. I'm doing all of the Slim Series workouts for a while, and Firm it up is definitely one of the toughest!. It's a great lower body workout. The first 20 minutes are standing exercises, like squats, sidekicks, the rest is on the floor. The workout also contains a warm up as well as a tough little ab routine and 6 minutes of well deserved stretch exercises at the end. Doing this tape for quite a while, I definitely have a lot more stamina and my legs are more spapelier and leaner then ever before. It's one of the hardest workouts I have ever done, but in the end it will bring amazing results!",1138060800,26,634,4.336134453781512
