3021145,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I love this show!!! It makes my heart soar!! It's original, fun, funny, and sweet. Not like anything else I've ever seen on TV.

I was sooo upset over the fact that the writers' strike stopped it. I had all 9 shows DVRed (to save them) and then my DVR died!!! Now I am heartbroken!

Please please please let Season 1 come out soon!",1202428800,5,331,4.15625
3021146,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Season One of PUSHING DAISIES has ended.  Sadly, the show, which was supposed to run through 22 episodes, has ended at 9.  Many shows have been adversely affected by the WGA strike, but except for FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS (which not only is going to be cancelled, but did not even get to wrap up its final season, so that it will end with the narrative dangling, an unfitting end to one of the most brilliant shows on TV) none as much for my money as PUSHING DAISIES.  This is simply one of the most original, extraordinary shows in the history of television.  I awaited the arrival of each of the nine episodes comprising Season One like many await the release of highly anticipated films.  That we got only the fraction of a season is heartbreaking.

In case anyone questions whether the season is indeed over, creator and producer Bryan Fuller has stated bluntly that the show will not resume production until next summer, when they will start work on Season Two.  And to make it all even more definite, this past week it was announced that Anna Friel, who plays Chuck on the show, will very shortly start filming LAND OF THE LOST with Will Ferrell.  You can't shoot new episodes if your female lead is unavailable.

What makes this so heartbreaking is how incredibly fresh and original this show was from the very first episode.  I was enthralled from the very first seconds.  As the camera moves up from underneath the earth, through the roots of the plants and grass just under the surface, and then up to reveal a vividly yellow field of flowers through which young Ned is running, I was completely entranced.  Everything about the show affected me in similar fashion from the music, to the extraordinary use of color (the color is what causes many people to compare it to AMELIE), to the relentless number of wonderful sets.  I've never seen a show that I have found so visually exciting.

And luckily the writing and the acting is every bit as good as the art design.  It is almost impossible to over praise the writing on the show for two reasons.  First, when you watch the first episode, it is so stunningly good that your immediate reaction is:  they can't possibly keep this level of excellence up.  Yet, they do.  In fact, the show doesn't merely stay as good as the pilot (or ""Pie-lette,"" as it is titled), it gets better.  The show doesn't merely have a brilliant premise, but has a plan.  Although we've had only 9 episodes, any viewer will definitely get the sense that this show is going someplace very specific.  Second, the show features some of the wittiest dialogue ever found on television.  Many compare the dialogue to that on THE GILMORE GIRLS, both for its immense cleverness and wonderful wordplay, but for its sheer quantity.  Without doubt those two shows probably have more words per minute than any shows ever previously seen.  (Interestingly, some of PUSHING DAISIES is filmed on the part of the back lot upon which THE GILMORE GIRLS was filmed.)  Part of the reason for this is that any spots that on other shows would result in silence on PUSHING DAISIES provides an opportunity for the Narrator, who embellishes the story in marvelous fashion.  Other shows have featured narrators, but in my opinion only ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT does so quite so well.

PUSHING DAISIES features a wonderful if somewhat compact ensemble cast.  Lee Pace, whom many may know from an earlier Bryan Fuller series WONDERFALLS (on which he played the main character's brother), plays Ned aka The Pie Maker, who ""isn't like the other boys,"" in that whenever he touches a dead thing he brings it back to life, with two caveats.  First, if he touches that dead thing (or person) a second time, they will be dead forever.  Second, if he doesn't touch it or them again within 60 seconds, something else must die in its place.  Anna Friel plays Ned's great childhood love Chuck aka Dead Girl, who is brought back to life by Ned after she was murdered.  Of course, this means that Ned and Chuck can never touch directly, which is, as Olive Snook points out, tragic (""notwithstanding big ticket items like genocide and death"").  The outrageously talented Kristin Chenoweth plays Olive.  Although one of the great Broadway musical talents of her time, neither TV nor the movies have found a way to take advantage of her.  Until now.  At first I was perplexed why they would cast such a huge talent in what was clearly the second female lead, but as the series goes along Olive quickly became one of my favorite characters.  And Kristin even sang a song, performing ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" in one of the season's highlights.  Ned's partner in solving crime, the delightfully named Emerson Cod, is played by Chi McBride.  Emerson is hands down the funniest, most delightful character on the show and perhaps a majority of the funniest lines on the show are uttered by McBride.  Chuck's aunts are played by two more Broadway stars, Swoosie Kurtz and Ellen Greene.  The Narrator is performed by Jim Dale, who is perhaps best known as the reader of the Harry Potter books on CD.  For me he is one of the most wonderful things about the show, providing precisely the right texture and background to every scene.  But one other performer has to be mentioned, or rather a pair of performers.  I can't tell them apart and I don't know the name of the second ""actor,"" but Orbit and another Golden Retriever play Ned's dog Digby.  Orbit played JD (short for Just Dog) on an earlier Bryan Fuller series, DEAD LIKE ME.  I have no idea how they get the reactions on film that ""Digby"" makes to things that happen around him, but to watch him you'd swear he really is acting.  My favorite Digby scene might be his interaction with Olive during her singing of ""Hopelessly Devoted.""

As much as I love this show I have to add that I've been amazed and perplexed that not everyone I know who has seen it has liked it.  Some don't like the Narrator.  Some don't like the fast-paced dialogue.  I simply can't account for this.  PUSHING DAISIES does have a very definite style.  I suppose that if the style rubs you the wrong way, you might not like it.  But for me and several of my closest friends, this is one of the most magical shows I've ever seen.  My two all time favorite shows are BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  How much do I love PUSHING DAISIES?  Although there have been only 9 episodes, right now I am inclined to say that I love it as much as those two, making it one of my three all time favorite shows.  Which is just another reason why I have been so upset by its truncated debut season.  But with the writers strike finally about to end (as I write this it has been indicated that the union will vote two days from now on the new contract), I am eagerly looking forward to Season Two.  What accidentally turned out to be the final episode of Season One did end on a bit of a cliffhanger and works fairly well as a transition to Season Two.  Be sure to watch this to get ready for it.",1202342400,90,7002,4.566158781074579
3021147,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Finally, something fresh and refreshing!  You want dark, ugly?  Go see CSI.  You want angst? Watch a soap opera.  Want oddball situations and witty humor? Watch this!  At first, the whole scenario--a man can bring back the dead for one minute, and always has had this power, which has caused him grief in odd ways all his life, and has happened to bring back both his dog and his girlfriend, neither he can touch again--made the eyebrows rise with a ""huh""?  Then you watch, and cannot stop watching. People judge this show compared to all the explosions, deep plots, and sex in other shows, but sometimes you need something that is as fresh as a daisy.  And, yes, there is whimsy, Jim Dale (Harry Potter book Guiness Book Records guy), and just plain weird cases.",1200268800,9,763,4.607407407407408
3021148,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Through 9 episodes so far, Pushing Daisies has become an ever more and more complicated romantic fairy tale between a pie maker and his childhood crush.  Now grown up and brought back from the dead (at the expense of a crooked mortition) by the pie maker, Charlotte (Chuck) and the pie maker have fallen in love in the most delicious series of the 2007-08 season.  The only problem is that if they ever touch, she will die for good.

The support cast include a reward seeking, former detective, a pie shop assistant, the pie maker's dog (brought back to life at the expense of a squirrel), a deadpan, morgue worker (pun intended) and two aunts of Charlotte (Chuck) ,who use to be mermaid swimmers in a circus.

What if you could be raised from the dead for one minute and then put back to being dead?  What if you survived that one minute but someone else or some other living being had to die in your place?  Each week is a new mystery of who-dunnit, why and how in cases that are bizarre to the tenth power.

Pushing Daisies is colorful, witty, absurd, charming, romantic and yes grim as a push me, pull me reaper who happens to bake pies.  As all good tales the story adds with each episodes with more and more being revealed as far as the main characters relate to each other and the lives (sometimes deaths) that they have experienced.

Pushing Daisies is my current favorite tv show. I hope ABC's Wednesdays at 8pm will continue to be illuminated with its' uniqueness.",1198368000,29,1474,4.49063670411985
3021149,5,B000YAA2SQ,"After 9 fabulous episodes, I cannot wait for more! While I have incredible respect for those involved in the negotiations to ensure fairness for both the networks and the WGA, I cannot wait to learn more about the adventures of the Pie Maker and the girl called ""Chuck.""

This is a delightful show that has a very Seuss-ian feel. Very comedic (""Bitch, I was in proximity!"" and ""Reality isn't like puppies, you don't pick your favorite"") and definitely sure to entertain even the most skeptic individuals.

Please cross your fingers for a swift resolution between WGA and the networks so we can get back to the saga of Ned, Chuck, Olive & Emerson Cod!",1197504000,11,650,4.692982456140351
3021150,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Alternately funny and whimsical, PUSHING DAISIES is a visually distinctive romantic comedy that encompasses a truly winning mix of ingredients. With its modern fairy tale settings and exploding color schemes - along with perfect but unobtrusive narration by Broadway veteran Jim Dale - comparisons to the work of Tim Burton are all but unavoidable. (In a good way.)

As in his previous outing (DEAD LIKE ME), series creator Bryan Fuller explores the great beyond but this time the results are much more impressive. The entire series centers around Ned (an utterly charming Lee Pace), who - at an early age - discovers that he possesses the power to bring the dead back to life with just a touch of his finger. The tradeoff? If he touches that person again, they will remain dead forever. And leaving the dead resurrected for longer than a minute causes someone else in the immediate vicinity to die. Cruel? Perhaps. But the universe demands a cosmic balance - and this is its solution.

Ned - the owner of a fairly successful pie shop known as `The Pie Hole' - uses his unique gift to earn a living in two ways: His astonishing pies, where his special touch invigorates the fruit with incredible flavor; and helping a detective (Chi McBride), who accidentally witnessed Ned's gift first-hand, solve murder cases. How? He revives the victims long enough to find out who killed them and then the two of them split the reward money. This can, and usually does, lead to near dangerous adventures for the two of them. Sounds exciting - but as Ned's co-worker Olive (the adorable Kristin Chenoweth of Broadway's WICKED) points out, it's a detached, emotionally frigid existence.

That is, until Charlotte enters his life again.

Charlotte or ""Chuck"" as she is called (played by Brit actress Anna Friel), is the girl Ned loved as a child before she moved away. When Ned and the detective discover the murdered Chuck on one of their cases, Ned brings her back to life for a sizable reward but can't bring himself to kill her, creating this dilemma: Although Ned and Chuck are strongly drawn to each other, they can never, EVER touch.

PUSHING DAISIES is loaded with stars from film, TV and the stage (Paul Ruebens, Raul Esparza, Molly Shannon, Swoosie Kurtz, Ellen Greene, Christopher Seiber, Barbara Barrie, Grant Shaud - to name but a few), and it's clear that everyone is having a marvelous time. The series is filled with tons of clever touches and Lee Pace, full of childlike vulnerability, is an immensely likable lead. His palpable longing for Anna Friel's Chuck is both sweet and touching. Seldom, however, has a series predicated on keeping two characters romantically apart established such a seemingly insurmountable barrier to insure that they remain that way.

As long as the creators can sustain the high level of entertainment that the first (as of this writing) nine episodes have provided, one can only pray that this highly original and gorgeous looking television experiment keeps going for years to come.",1197417600,183,3016,4.903921568627451

3021238,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I took a chance on this show because its soundtrack includes one of my favorite songs, Birdhouse in Your Soul, sung by Ellen Greene and the incomparable Kristin Chenoweth, and because of its outstanding ratings... so many people love it! Now having watched the first season, I TOTALLY understand why! The premise is so creative, and it's presented in a quirky, charming, engaging, and delightful way. It's a dark comedy, but there's also a distinct lightness to it which is so engaging.

When I first watched it, it honestly reminded me of My Name is Earl, another show I LOVED, even though the two are wildly different from each other in tone and content. I think it reminded me of Earl because it is so utterly unique and unlike (almost) anything I'd ever seen before, and because of its rapid-fire, witty dialogue, its saturated color/aesthetic, and its wonderful music- although Pushing Daisies' music is decidedly more orchestral than Earl's. It's also very much like Monk in that each episode focuses on figuring out how and why someone has died as only it's unique protagonist can do- in this case, Ned asks the deceased people themselves and, with the help of Chuck and Emerson, builds on the clues they provide. Perhaps best of all, it truly feels like watching a Dr. Seuss movie with its lush colors- especially orange and green, its narrator, and its candy coating of whimsy. What other show can be described as talking to the dead with a candy coating of whimsy? None. If this sounds wonderful or even just intriguing to you, I highly recommend watching! It's an excellent show!",1511827200,2,1590,4.802919708029197

And I love good detective shows, and this is like a comedy with a mystery each episode. Again, it's hard to describe how this show is light and positive but still cynical and realistic.

3021468,5,B000YAA2SQ,"One of my all-time favorite shows!
What I love about it:  The sets, the narrator, Kristin Chenowith, Lee Pace, the plot, Swoozie Kurtz and the playful scripts.  It doesn't take itself too seriously.  It is unlike anything else I've ever seen before, although I hear it is similar to Amilie.  It is fun, and funny, sometimes silly, but never brainless or stupid.  It is delightfully playful with a slightly dark side.
What I didn't care for:  Anna Friel, sorry, but I don't think she was the best choice for this main character. She wasn't bad, just not as animated as the rest of the cast.  Some parts were a little darker than I like, but the whole ambience of the show is eye candy, so it doesn't come across as dark.  Most people wouldn't care about this.  Kristin Chenowith's plunging neckline drove me nuts in a bad way.  It was unnecessary and didn't fit with the wholesome look of the show.",1482192000,,897,4.515527950310559

3021520,5,B000YAA2SQ,A unique show whose potential was cut short when it wasn't picked up for a third season. I've never seen anything quite like it. Lee Pace and Anna Friel are so talented. The characters will steal your heart.,1482019200,,207,4.473684210526316
3021521,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This was an absolutely brilliant show. My guess is that it didn't survive because you actually need to pay attention to fully appreciate each episode. Fast dialog, humor, and funny sarcasm abound, delivered by an outstanding cast. It's sad that a rare show like is doomed on network television, which is why I watch almost none...",1481846400,,330,4.910714285714286

The narrating takes just a little to get used to but adds to some of the humor....just an FYI if you order this set please know you may get a dvd with the cover that says The Pie Hole, I did and thought they sent the wrong item, so I sent back and Amazon sent a new one, the new one had a cover that said Pushing Daisies (like the picture) when I took the plastic DVD case out it said The Pie Hole oops that is the correct DVD....",1478390400,2,572,3.8559322033898304

This gentle show is full of whimsy and adorable ridiculousness. Its humor embraces word play and subtly and is rather on the dry side.

3022067,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Where do I start with this underrated and wonderfully written show? It's clearly a show that was ahead of its time and the writing was superb, to say in the very least. Unfortunately it was aired at the wrong time and cancelled mainly due to the writers strike that occurred during the same time as the 2nd season came around. I'm guessing that the reason it didn't come back like other shows was probably, at least in my own opinion) that this show was too intelligent for the mainstream reality/cliche' situation comedy/competition/talk show/game show viewer's IQ. Seriously, how does the junk like Two and a Half Men stay on the air when this was so much better and extraordinary in its genre?
I could go on and on, but what's the point? The only thing that I have left to say is that if you are going to buy the box sets make sure you get them on Blu-Ray. The picture is phenomenal and well worth it even though they don't come with any extras.",1431302400,6,948,4.422857142857143

3022099,5,B000YAA2SQ,"An amazing ensemble cast, quirky premise, fantastic episodes, a great narrator, and vibrant visuals combined and made Pushing Daisies one of the best series ever to be produced. Lee Pace is charming and brings such humanity to Ned. Anna Friel's mischievous, flirty turn as Chuck pairs very nicely with reticent Ned. Kristin Chenowith and Chi McBride may be considered supporting characters but they bring just as much heart, mirth, and life to Olive and Emerson. Swoosie Kurtz and Ellen Greene are awesome as Aunts Lily and Vivian, and I'm so glad they got as much screen time as they did. And Digby! Such a cute dog.
For all that the show was about solving crimes (mostly murders), it never feels as bleak or as hopeless as other crime shows do. All of the characters are three-dimensional; none of them ever feel like caricatures or clichs. Even when they are the bad guys, you still identify with them a bit because they are shown as people and not just ""bad guys"".
It's such a shame the series didn't get renewed so we could stay a little longer in Coeur d'Coeurs; I really loved visiting.",1431043200,2,1093,4.668393782383419
3022100,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This is by far my favorite show that I have ever seen. The main storyline about the lives of Ned, Chuck, Olive, and Emerson is original and intelligent, and it balances the humorous and the sympathetic very well. The characters are loveable, funny, and adorably imperfect, and they are brilliantly acted by some superb actors. The chemistry (romantic or otherwise) between Ned and the other main characters is spot on to me. Additionally, the episodic storylines of various death investigations are ingenious and hilarious. The situations border on the absurd but in the best way possible as part of the over-the-top, fairy-tale presentation of the show. Visually, the show is interesting and often unexpected.

The show deserved every one of the seven Emmy Awards it got (in addition to the other awards), and the ratings and cancellation seem to be more a reflection of the American public's desire for unoriginal, clichd, unintelligent crime dramas and hospital dramas and celebrity dance-offs than a reflection on the brilliance of Pushing Daisies.",1431043200,10,1052,5.224852071005917

3022135,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Easily became one of my favorite shows to be cancelled. The characters are adorable, and the writing is hysterical. A show fully centered on death, and yet it also has the most livliest feel to it. All the colors are bright to the point of ludicris, but that just adds to the shows comic appeal. This is probably Lee Pace's cutest role, as Ned the Piemaker. A girl named Chuck, and a disgruntled PI only add to the endearing elements of the show. The drama with Kristin Chenoweth's character is bit weird and boring, but the show makes up for it in bounds in other areas.

I love all the characters in the series, there is no unpleasant.
My mother loves Pushing Daisies, we watching it together.
In fact, this series and big bang theory is the only series I have at home on dvd, most tv shows today are horrible..
It's very clean, romantic, funny and even a little corny.
It's series has a style to Tim Burton films.

It has a love story, comedy, humor, a mystery to solve, and the acting is superb, especially Kristin Chenoweth and Swoozie Kurtz.  Their characters carry a LOT of the show.  I was hoping to finish the series this coming fall and winter when we are not outside so much, but it is now paid programming.

3022345,5,B000YAA2SQ,I watched this show when it came out and loved it! So when i found the series on dvd i was doing back flips. Its a nice show theres no nudity or sex or very much violence (its a crime show so it has to have a little). Its really different and interesting. The packaging for this surpassed my greatest expectations. I love how the discs look like pies and the episode guy looks like the menu to the pie hole. I also love hoe they put the dollies behind the pies in the case it was a great touch. Wish they had but this much detail into the season 2 one. You might be going only 12 episodes thats not a lot its not worth the money. But it is the episodes are actually pretty long. the first time i watched it since it was on tv and i kept wondering when the first episode would end. I love this show! I love the packaging!

3022403,5,B000YAA2SQ,I am so grateful to be able to re-watch this series. Even though it's been off the air for quite some time I still shake my head and wonder why ABC was so quick to cancel it. It is quirky and charming and very well acted. Though it was billed as a forensic procedural it is far more than that. Every episode is fun to watch because the characters are so fully formed. The dialog is somewhat fast paced but not so much so that you get left behind. I will watch the episodes over and over again and should Amazon ever remove it I will find a way to buy the complete series...a blissful 2 seasons.,1401667200,,594,4.085470085470085

3022408,4,B000YAA2SQ,"I never saw this show when it was on broadcast TV but I have to admit that it is proving to be very entertaining.  There is a cartoonlike quality to the visual aspects of the show.  The colors are all supersaturated, buildings and sets are greatly exaggerated, particularly in the distortion of wide angle shots.  The brilliant and superbly performed narration by Jim Dale is consistent and entertaining and the balance between dry almost minimalist performances by the two leads opposing the often over-the-top ones by Chi McBride, Kristin Chenoweth, Ellen Greene and Swoosie Kurtz work really well against the visuals.

I don't know how long the central concept of a couple in love who cannot touch, can be carried off without over-stretching the tension but most of the way through the first season I am finding it keeps my interest very well.",1401408000,,846,4.895104895104895

3022442,5,B000YAA2SQ,I love this series. It's got a whimsical sort of feeling to it and the style and morbid humor remind me very much of a Series of Unfortunate Events. I love the concept and the way its handled and Lee Pace is adorable as the Pie Maker.,1400544000,,234,4.0
3022443,4,B000YAA2SQ,"Although it's a cute show, you have to be careful of the sexual innuendoes.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone younger than 12 unless you believe that they can handle the jokes.",1400544000,,179,4.59375
3022444,5,B000YAA2SQ,Pushing Daisies is amazing from beginning to end.  The colors are are enchanting.  All the characters are extremely original and entertaining.  The narration is top art storytelling and the dialogue is cleverly cute and witty. Listen closely and use your thinker to keep up with the fast paced conversations and guess the mystery in each episode. I recommend this show for the whole family.  It's great for expanding ones vocabulary way beyond other TV shows and it's much cleaner for children to watch.  I think it even teaches adults how to expand and exercise the imagination once again.,1400544000,,590,4.979591836734694
3022445,5,B000YAA2SQ,This show has a Dr. Seuss feel to it but it is very entertaining. Great that it is on Amazon Prime.,1400457600,,99,3.761904761904762
3022446,5,B000YAA2SQ,Cute show and glad I started watching it! Sad I missed it when it used to air on ABC!! Must see if you like a cute mystery,1400457600,,122,3.5555555555555554

3022448,5,B000YAA2SQ,Love this show!! So over-the-top adorable with a touch of the unexpected packed into every episode. My daughters and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching!!,1400284800,,153,5.416666666666667
3022459,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Usually shows that cover death a lot or either morbid or depressing. When I first started this series I wasn't sure how they could make it funny! But better than just being funny, very oddly I actually felt better after watching a episode. It's like a little pick me up in a strange story world!",1400198400,,295,4.381818181818182
3022460,4,B000YAA2SQ,"A clever concept, consistently written, great characters!  The humor is campy, the concept allowed the romantic tension to remain throughout (which was refreshing).  No gratuitous sex or language, there is lots of innuendo and the overiding theme of death & violence, presented as humorous, could be objectionable to some.",1400198400,,322,5.551020408163265
3022461,4,B000YAA2SQ,Very original.  Loved this series. Great acting and original scripts.  Nothing else like it out there.  Cancelled before its time.,1400112000,,130,5.4
3022462,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Just a really good show with comedy, drama, and romance.  Each episode is about 45 minutes long with a good recap at the beginning of each show so you don't necessarily have to start with the first episode and watch in order.  Great cast!",1400025600,,238,4.386363636363637
3022463,4,B000YAA2SQ,"I'd heard a lot about this show so I decided to give it a try. It's very cute and fun, the acting is good and the plot is fresh and interesting. It's definitely one of the most visually interesting shows I've seen in recent years and many of the shots are just gorgeous (even if they're obviously CGI).",1400025600,,302,4.224137931034483
3022464,5,B000YAA2SQ,Really sorry to see it drop off the air.  Especially liked Kristen in her character.  She is an all-around phenom.,1400025600,,114,4.65
3022465,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This has been the only TV series I loved so much, I had to buy the DVDs. Clever writing, visually striking, chaste and yet macabre at the same time!",1400025600,,148,4.137931034482759
3022466,5,B000YAA2SQ,What can I say about season 1 of Pushing Daisies other then its brilliant tv writing and of course the network can it before it could really grow. Season one is full of great stories and characters that have chemistry.,1400025600,,218,4.475
3022467,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I have been watching ""Pushing Daisies"" since it came out years ago. It is well-constructed and wittily written with beautifully crafted characters who create so much intrigue of their own. The use of color, costume and set-design, not to mention the narration by Jim Dale round out the viewer's experience to be one of story-book romance, laced with delightfully dark humor.
It was cancelled far too soon!

Anyone who enjoys the likes of Dr. Who, British costume dramas, Tim Burton, or the Hitchhiker's guide---and simply anyone in the mood to be delighted---will be charmed by this perfectly crafted series.",1399939200,,608,5.141414141414141

3022470,5,B000YAA2SQ,I am so sick of reality TV.  I can't believe that this show only lasted 2 seasons.  I love the story line.  The chemistry between all the characters are great.  This show is so sweet and cute and interesting that even the kids can watch.,1399939200,,237,4.2
3022471,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Just watch it. I seriously just finished the whole season in two days, and I loved it so much! It was seriously one of the best shows I've watched this month. Cute, funny, with some plot twists. I can't wait to watch season 2...",1399939200,,228,4.204545454545454
3022472,4,B000YAA2SQ,My wife and I enjoyed the quirkiness of the show and found it very funny.  Pushing Daisies has it's own style that is very artistic and inventive.  We however can understand that mass audiences would not appreciate the show and thus it only lasted two seasons.,1399852800,,260,4.630434782608695
3022473,5,B000YAA2SQ,I love this show! It's a classic humor with a slightly morbid twist. The characters are quirky and the style of the show is so unique. Got to love it!,1399852800,,150,4.033333333333333

3022478,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I love this show. It's like nothing else. It's modern, but nostalgic. It's certainly aimed at an adult audience, but not trashy. Though its romance will certainly be very pleasing to a female audience, this male is touched by its elevation of love as a constant theme.",1399680000,,268,4.723404255319149

3022493,5,B000YAA2SQ,This show is as wonderful as I remembered.  Too bad there aren't more episodes.  It has the rare quality of being quirky and visually appealing at the same time. Reminds me a great deal Wes Anderson's movies.,1399334400,,208,4.594594594594595

3022513,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Cute and clever. Nice change from today's ""reality tv"" dramas and shows. It's scifi it's crime and it's a romance",1398556800,,113,4.7
3022514,4,B000YAA2SQ,Funny! Surprisingly clean & enjoyable... Reminded me slightly of mirror mirror or lemony snikets as far as the way it was filmed,1398470400,,128,4.863636363636363
3022515,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Pushing Daisies is charming, engaging and so wonderfully different, if anything else it's worth at least one view...and then you'll be hooked. I had heard about it and always meant to watch but procrastination never pays off as it was taken off the air. Lee Pace is so very endearing as the lead, a tender pie maker with a touching way of bringing people back from the dead. Absolutely wonderful supporting cast. The writing of this series - fantastic. So much time must have been put into selecting the Dr. Sues-like words but it all flows so effortlessly.",1398470400,,557,4.6938775510204085
3022516,5,B000YAA2SQ,Sweet. Visually lovely. Oddly realistic for being based on such an odd premise and having such a burtonesque backdrop. Characters are very 'true to life'.,1398470400,,154,5.2
3022517,5,B000YAA2SQ,This show is amazing I just might have to kill myself because I can't stand not knowing what will happen. How evil to cancel a great show and not let them wrap it up. It's just like my so called life all over again! 9th grade was hard enough I didn't need to be abandoned by a TV show! So I suggest you don't watch it cause you''ll just get abandonment issues.,1398470400,,360,4.013888888888889

3022520,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Cute whimsical show. Reminds me of a Dr Seuss book because of all the colors and cutsie rhymes and characters. A bit corny at times,  but who doesn't love some corny?",1398384000,,166,4.354838709677419

But 'Pushing Up Daisies' was a happy discovery on Amazon Prime. The story itself is novel and the characters are charming. I'm not even going to attempt to describe the plot (no spoiler alert needed) because discovering it is part of the fun.

This show is just a great watch. Definitely keeps me interested, even though I tend to find watching TV shows and movies to be boring.",1396396800,,297,4.622641509433962
3022559,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I love everything about this dvd set. Not only is the show amazing with fun dialogue and charming characters, but the design of this dvd is perfect. The discs are shaped like pies, and the case looks like a cafe menu. So cute. This set also comes with some great special features.",1396310400,,280,4.403846153846154
3022560,5,B000YAA2SQ,"If only there were more than 2 seasons. The characters are great with great actors. Even the guest stars are nice surprises. I almost didn't recognize Pee-Wee. I like the twist in the storyline that sets it apart from other mysteries. I am very ""touched"" by the love story between the 2 main characters that can't touch.",1396310400,,320,4.631578947368421

3022562,4,B000YAA2SQ,Something out of the ordinary. Sort of off the wall clean humor and some story line to tie it all together.,1396051200,,107,4.142857142857143
3022563,4,B000YAA2SQ,"Clever concept with very imaginative setting and camera work.  It evokes some of the better work by Tim Burton; or possibly 'an unfortunate series of events'.  It borders on fantasy while staying engaged with the 'real' world.  The characters are all engaging and well suited for their roles but it's the settings and the almost otherworldly feel that sets this one apart.  The narrator deserves acknowledgment too; his droll, deadpan delivery works perfectly.",1396051200,,460,5.260273972602739
3022564,5,B000YAA2SQ,I watched this show a couple years ago and wanted to watch it again recently. I completely love the amusing stories and the witty banter gives me a giggle time and Tim again,1396051200,,173,4.2727272727272725
3022565,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Pushing Daisies is funny, entertaining, and witty. It is filled with beautiful sets and vibrant colors. The characters work so well together. Pushing Daisies is a show worth the watch, I only wisg there were more seasons.",1396051200,,221,5.0
3022566,5,B000YAA2SQ,"It's really too bad this show only had 2 seasons. It's such a fun, quirky show. This show may seem a little odd to some but the dry humor and wit make it one of our favorite shows of all time.",1395964800,,192,3.707317073170732
3022567,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This was a show that ended just too soon.  Just like many shows on ABC it was cancelled after two season.  It is worth checking out and is a lite comedy with Jim Dale doing the narration.  If you don't remember him he did the reading of Harry Potter and also starred in Pete's Dragon.  Great cast, great storyline, and just an escape from the troubles of the day.",1395964800,,363,4.217391304347826
3022568,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Love this show! It's funny, sweet, and very cleverly written.

3022570,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This show is a real treat; a break from the usual romantic comedy. There is an old Greek myth about two star-crossed lovers who are forbidden to make physical contact, and this story reminds me of that, but without all the angst. Very enjoyable.",1395705600,,245,4.590909090909091
3022571,5,B000YAA2SQ,"The idea of talking to the dead fascinates many, but this show puts a twist on the idea. Ned, can only revive the dead for a minute before another living thing takes its place. using the ability to talk to the dead to find their killers, is a fresh twist on the usual detective shows. Funny and gruesome. Just the way it should be.",1395705600,,331,4.1875
3022572,3,B000YAA2SQ,Each episode is entertaining to a point. They seem to be about the same thing every time though. My wife and I have continued to watch it just the same. Maybe for a lack of something better though.,1395705600,,197,4.2105263157894735

3022582,4,B000YAA2SQ,"This is a fun show but it is a bit off-the-wall. I could almost give it five stars but a few of the episodes were almost too odd. However, if you like a clean show with not your run-of-the-mill humor, this might be the one for you. (And what is not to like about watching Lee Pace for 40 minutes?) How about four and one half stars?",1395273600,,332,3.970149253731343

3022603,5,B000YAA2SQ,It is one of my favorite shows and I was sorry it went off the air. I like anything unusual,1394755200,,91,3.6
3022604,5,B000YAA2SQ,It is hilarious and not as cookie cutter as most comedy/ dramas. Also it's very Beautifully done. Love the narroration.,1394582400,,119,5.0
3022605,5,B000YAA2SQ,This show is the best kind of campy. There is a lot of wordplay and the show often edges towards silly.,1394582400,,103,3.9523809523809526
3022606,5,B000YAA2SQ,This show was unique and very clever.  It only lasted a couple of seasons.  I think it must have been difficult to maintain the level of writing but it was a very enjoyable show.,1394582400,,178,4.205882352941177
3022607,4,B000YAA2SQ,I'd heard a lot about this show but only watched it recently.  I can say it definitely lived up to the hype.  A very fast paced and clever comedy.  It's a unique storyline with great narration provided by none other than Jim Dale.,1394496000,,230,4.3023255813953485
3022608,5,B000YAA2SQ,Loved Season 1.  Season 2 had different results.  They are night and day different.  The 2008 writing was atrocious and the writers strike killed it.,1394409600,,149,4.88

and she came back to life. And you were reunited.

I looked forward to seeing this every week. The writers strike
destroyed this show. Relive it on disk.",1394409600,,385,4.436619718309859
3022610,5,B000YAA2SQ,I didn't watch this show when it was on TV.  I caught part of a marathon on TV one day and got hooked.  It's quirky and sweet.

3022617,4,B000YAA2SQ,Pushing daisies is a very interesting series. It's not like your average tv show.

Now I'm totally hooked,1394064000,,275,5.0
3022618,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Bravo to the writers and especially to the set designers/costumers for this creative and witty series. How they managed to make a storyline riddled with death so delightfully pleasant is beyond me.

3022625,3,B000YAA2SQ,"I like the weirdly nostalgic sets and wacky plot lines, but sometimes this show tries too hard to be cute. I'd give it 4 stars if it was a little darker.

3022626,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Love this off beat odd little show.  First, the cinematograhy in this series is outstanding. From over the top sets  and costumes that would make Audrey Hepburn envious to odd angles that give a different perspective, everything about this show seems reinvented. Second, the tongue in cheek approach to the dialog keeps me on my toes listening for the next quip. The detective part of the story line is a bit simplistic in most of the episodes. But the other excellent elements make up for that.

I am going back to watch the entire series again just to pick up on the double entendres, puns and alliterations. The dialog is a delight. I love the character of Olive Snook played by Kristin Chenoweth. What an outstanding comedic actor. She alone is worth tuning in to see and hear.",1393804800,,781,4.644927536231884

3022629,5,B000YAA2SQ,"It's witty, fun, and the piemaker is nice to look at. It all starts with the death of a childhood sweetheart who the lonely piemaker does not want to see dead again. Everything after that is sleuthing of the most interesting (and well paid) cases that Emerson Cod gets employed for.
This show is a must see just to experience the wonderful characters that are Ned, Chuck, Emerson Cod, and Olive.",1393718400,,395,4.577464788732394

This show is terrific  I've watched it numerous times and finally purchased because I always want to have access to the pie maker, Digby, Emerson Cod, Chuck, the Darli g Mermaid Darlings and the effervescent itty bitty!! The show is clever, incentive and makes zombies (yep chick is basically a zombie) romantic.  She's ever so lucky to not have died in some hideous way, allowing the make up people the whimsy to construct fantastical death masks, half a face, large trample good prints, glass shards sticking out everywhere...it's such fun in an odd way.

Yes, it's a comedy, this much is obvious, but then it takes a 180 to somebody dying, then making fun of them, then someone else dying very soon.

3022658,5,B000YAA2SQ,I love this show. Maybe you have to like a certain kind of aesthetic but this show takes risks and as a result is FANTASTIC! The choices throughout are cohesive and successfully create a beautiful quirky universe that doesn't fit into any genre box I can think of. The use of the narrator I think is well done and just creates this feeling of a fairy tale that some of the odd yet cloyingly sweet situations just seem to lend themselves to. I'm a big fan of Wes Anderson and I think this show captures the same kind of feeling; Highly stylized and unconventional.

3022671,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Loved this series and was very upset when it was cancelled. The creator, Bryan Fuller, is a mad, creative genius (Wondetfalls!), and I think he simply flurished in this crazy, quirky world of Ned The Pie Maker, played by Lee Pace.

We meet Ned when he's 9 years old and he discovers he's got a unique gift. If he touches anything dead, he can bring it back to life. BUT, if he touches it again, it's dead for good. And he also learns that in order to give something life, something else has to die. He later learns that he has a time limit of 60 seconds before something/someone dies for the thing/one that he ressurects. Crazy, huh?

But it's not just the situation of our principal character, it's the world in which he lives and works in. He brings back his childhood sweetheart Chuck, who was murdered, but she can't tell her beloved aunts she's not dead because they buried her. And the maddening consequence of their newfound relationship is they can't touch, or else she dies for good.

Our other characters, Emerson Cod, the PI that finds out about Ned's ability and uses it to awaken murdered people to find out who killed them and collect the rewards. Hey, they split the money! Olive Snook, the waittress of Ned's restaurant, The Pie Hole, who was once a top jockey and left after a bad race managed to kill a fellow competitor.

Like I said, a crazy world...but I think you'll love it!",1392336000,4,1397,4.488188976377953

The writing is superb, occasionally dark, offbeat and funny.
Chi McBride often steals the show with his deadpan delivery of cleaver and hilariously funny lines which cleverly point out the many foibles of the supporting cast. I'm positive they could have spun him off in his own comedy Detective series. If Hollywood could team him up with and make a movie with Cedric the Entertainer we'd all be laughing so hard we'd be Pushing up Daisies.

The premise is simple: Ned, a pie maker is able to revive the dead by touching them, a second touch from him and they're dead forever.  If the revived person is around for more than a minute, then a random individual will die instead.  Sounds silly, but thanks to a combination of a great cast, amazing writers, and great direction, it works fantastically.  Ned supplements his meager income running a pie shop by reviving murder victims so that a private detective can solve the case and split the reward money with Ned.  All goes well until one of the victims is Ned's childhood sweetheart.  Give it two episodes, and if you don't love it, move on to something else.  Oh, and make sure you've got plenty of pie on hand.

3022739,5,B000YAA2SQ,"First off, thanks to Amazon Prime for including this in your streaming service. Without you, I wouldn't know the joy of the series.

Pushing Daisies is about a boy/man named Ned who discovers his power to bring dead things back to life by touching them when his canine companion runs into traffic and is hit by a semi. As the poor boy is hunched over his dog trying to come to terms with its death, he touches it and the dog walks off like nothing happened. Ned continues to explore his new powers when his mother suddenly drops dead as a result of a blood clot. He touches her and she immediately comes back to life. Unbeknownst to Ned or his mother, there are a couple catches (as always!). First, if the revived person lives for more than a minute, something else must go. Think of the alchemy principal, an equal exchange must be made. Second, he can only touch the revived person once. If he touches them a second time, they are dead and cannot be revived again.

As you probably guessed, this sets up a devastating tragedy where Ned revives his childhood sweetheart and decides to keep her alive. Trouble is, now he cannot touch her as much as he desperately wants to because doing so would end things between them forever.

The sets are visually amazing, something out of a dark Tim Burton movie. The constant theme of death is toyed with so much that almost all of the emotion associated with it is lost, which is difficult to do in most cases. In ""Pushing Daisies"" it is simply another part of the plot line, bringing people back to life to discover who killed them. Think of CSI with more quirks and less science.

3022760,4,B000YAA2SQ,"This is an extremely fun and interesting show... The overall production has a ""James and  the giant peach"" feel to the cinamatography. The plot and story lines are entertaining and unusual. All of the characters have a loveable quality even when they are not being loveable. The show explores human emotions in a relateable but entertaining way. Pushing Daisies models positive ways to deal with all of our emotions. It is a shame that it did not last longer than two seasons!

I won't go into the details of the show beyond saying that it's sweet, quirky, sometimes funny, sometimes a little creepy but always totally original and unlike any other television program I've seen.

3022841,5,B000YAA2SQ,I fell in love with the whimsy this show offered while it was on television.  It is great to be able to watch a show that ended prematurely in my opinion.,1386979200,,154,3.967741935483871

3022845,5,B000YAA2SQ,"If you are a hopeless romantic, a design aficionado, a fashion geek, a fan of Broadway musicals, old films, or They Might Be Giants, a Chi McBride groupie, a lover of snappy dialogue and groan-inducing puns, a gentle soul, an appreciator of conundrums, a connoisseur of the omniscient voice-over, someone who thinks life is altogether too ugly and not surreal and beautiful enough, or just a person who hungers for pie, you will adore this series. It's delightful.",1386633600,,464,4.961538461538462
3022846,5,B000YAA2SQ,"very cute, sexy, and fun. Tried it because of high ratings, and I agree! Interesting stories each episode. Give it a try.",1386547200,,121,4.545454545454546
3022847,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I give Pushing Daisies 5 stars because of it's unique premise, intellectual dialogue, figurative language, and narrative genius. One could get lost in it's seemingly limitless storyline, with it's twists and turns, this show is definitely a nail biter. It's funny and sad, triumphant yet disappointing; it's a cornucopia of mixed emotions but in a well-thought-out, planned way.",1386374400,,378,5.5344827586206895

3022851,5,B000YAA2SQ,"A guy has the strange ability to bring back any dead thing with just a touch.  However, if he touches it again, it will be dead permanently.  The catch--if he brings anything back for longer than 60 seconds, another living thing of about the same size must die in its place.  Now he's brought back his soulmate, and although they are deeply in love, they cannot ever touch each other or she will be gone forever.  Possibly the most creative premise for a show I've ever seen.  We were devastated when this series was canceled partway through the second season.  Our whole family loved it.  I would give it a PG rating, just because of the fact that there are a lot of corpses on this show, and the topic of death is, for obvious reasons, prevalent.",1386115200,,748,4.416058394160584
3022852,3,B000YAA2SQ,Great series on those rainy days or cold nights too bad only two seasons.  If you like Monk or Drop Dead Diva you might like this too.,1385510400,,134,3.962962962962963

3022854,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I loved the series. It is corny, so if you are in the mood for a serious drama, this isn't it. This is a great show if you want to sit back, relax, and not have to think.

For parents out there considering watching it with kids, I would say content wise it is appropriate for all ages, however the younger ones won't understand, but if you are looking for something to watch with your 12-13 year old, this would be acceptable. So far (I am halfway through the first season) there has been no adult content (maybe a few references here or there, but not enough to warrant any parental concerns) and I think only two instances of profanity.

This is a show that I would definitely recommend to someone, my only regret - that it is only two seasons. Apparently the writers strike a while back resulted in this show going off air.

I watched this through Amazon Prime.",1385337600,,864,4.354037267080745
3022855,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This is such a cute show. I am so sad I missed it when it played on TV, and even sadder it was cancelled so soon. It is funny and quirky and all the actors are great. Some of the digitalization looks very cheap but I feel like that's kind of the point? Anyway, good, fun show.",1385251200,,276,3.8596491228070176

3022858,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Quirky, fun, visually appealing. Went into it with high hopes due to the reviews, and I was not disappointed. Interesting premise, intricate plots, killer dialogue, etc. I can see why it stopped at two seasons. It is probably intellectually over many heads.",1384387200,,257,5.142857142857143

3022865,5,B000YAA2SQ,"A nice series that in a light hearted way deals with the subject of death. Death is a mystery that we will all deal with and this puts a light hearted slant on how it could work, not really. But it is very entertaining.",1383609600,,219,4.0
3022866,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This was such a wonderfully quirky show. I only recently sat down and watched both seasons, lamenting that it only lasted that long. It's a tragedy that it got canceled.",1383436800,,169,4.666666666666667
3022867,5,B000YAA2SQ,"When Pushing Daisies came on I was attending college and simply didn't have time to watch the show. So here was opportunity for me to see the show that several of my friends had said was delightful. I've seen Lee Pace in several other things and rather like him. I like the idea of the story, with the Piemaker bringing people back to life, but only for a minute. The supporting characters were strong. I also felt the show had a strong visual look. It really wasn't until the end of the season that I was frustrated by the thought that the Piemaker and Chuck can never touch. That was very sad.",1383436800,,595,4.321428571428571

3022869,5,B000YAA2SQ,This is a really imaginative and original show that is fun to watch. I wish I had discovered Pushing Daisies while it was still on the air.,1383091200,,139,4.185185185185185
3022870,5,B000YAA2SQ,Fun and engaging with witty writing.  The design is beautiful and really brings you in to the world.  Well done.,1382572800,,112,4.55
3022871,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I don't think I have really seen a show with such a unique narrative and style.  The story is great, the presentation (color, set, and lighting) is great, and the Tim Burton like narrative is great, making for an entertaining show! You just don't see TV shows that are set apart from the rest, in form and delivery, that are also able to pull it off successfully.",1382400000,,363,4.417910447761194
3022872,5,B000YAA2SQ,I LOVE this show and it's been fun re-visiting it on Amazon. Such an inventive and well executed show all around. I wish it didn't get cancelled 4 years ago.,1382054400,,157,4.266666666666667
3022873,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This show is in my top two of all time. Its clever and funny and endearing and the cast and guest stars are spectacular.
Season One was brilliant and can be rewatched repeatedly. I frequently find things I missed the first time. I love the singing episodes as Kristen Chenowith has an amazing voice. The whole colorful look of the show is unique and beautiful. If you like quirky characters, an interesting storyline, and fast paced intelligent dialogue, this is a must see.",1381881600,,474,4.72289156626506
3022874,4,B000YAA2SQ,"It's full of offbeat wry humor on a theme that is much more satisfying than 'Six Feet Under' which I did watch and enjoyed.
If you don't like the feel of Alice in Wonderland parodies, you probably won't like this.
Watch the first episode then any other one on Prime, before you buy it.",1381881600,,285,4.296296296296297
3022875,4,B000YAA2SQ,"This show is one of my all time favorites. So cute and quirky! The audio seems a bit tinny in some episodes, I've noticed. As well as out of sync in some parts, but it's hardly noticible.

I docked it a star because the case arrived a bit broken. The tabs in the inside of the cover (that hold in the DVD info papers) were both broken off and the DVD hinges are cracking.",1381795200,,371,4.013513513513513

3022881,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I saw one of my friends watching this in my dorm a few years back and decided to buy it on a whim.  It's a great show with an interesting premise.  Solving murders is easier when you can ask the dead who killed them.  Beyond that, it has interesting characters and a romance that is both tragic and amusing simultaneously.

The show didn't last long, but I'd highly recommend it.",1381190400,,379,4.371428571428571
3022882,5,B000YAA2SQ,"As a film student studying to write for television, I'm a bit of an aficionado for serialized, stylized storytelling, and Bryan Fuller's Pushing Daisies delivers a top shelf experience on both fronts. The vividly colored set and costume design is complemented by a strong narrative and cleverly written characters who both typify their archetypes and turn them on their ear all at the same time. Fuller's unique obsession with interpreting death in unusual ways lends a sense of wonder and fun to what could easily be a macabre show, and instead imbues it with delight, romance, love, adventure and plenty of humor.

Watch Pushing Daisies. You won't regret it.",1381104000,,660,5.055045871559633

3022887,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Quite possibly the most original show ever on television. It's so hard to describe beyond saying it's laugh-out-loud funny, romantic, sweet, quirky, clever, and utterly charming. The show also had a unique look--lots of bright colors and sets that look simultaneously retro and futuristic--that gave it a fairy-tale quality I've never seen duplicated. The entire cast is phenomenal and I really can't single out any one actor-----but if I could it might be Chi McBride, who is far funnier than he usually gets the chance to be. His comedic timing is absolutely flawless. But truly, everyone is fantastic. Cannot recommend this show enough, but you have to like offbeat and not be put off by the premise.",1380844800,,703,5.017094017094017

The writing is wonderful, the narration in the show is clever and witty, the actors were cast perfectly, and the way it was filmed was refreshing.

couple, the story lines were fun and the narrator made each episode more fun with his quirky style.  The aunts were an interesting duo and their side story became pretty good as well.  I loved all the ways Chuck and Ned found to touch without actually touching.

Blue ray more than worth it, in view of the stunning colors used, and the great set pieces and costumes.
Oh, and the actors aren't half bad either. Cancellation of this show should have had legal consequences for those who decided to axe it

3022923,5,B000YAA2SQ,I was so mad when this show ended so shortly because it was just the cutest neat show I had seen in a while.  Now I'm catching up on all the episodes on Amazon Prime and I'm loving them all over again! Highly recommend watching.,1378425600,,228,4.066666666666666
3022924,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I had heard this show was good, but I really had no idea just how good it was. I am in love with Pushing Daisies!",1378252800,,113,3.56
3022925,5,B000YAA2SQ,So good and wholesome with very good story lines.  Could be easily watched by the whole family.  Fun and engaging and gorgeous to see. Such a good story and amazing series.  Wish it didn't get cancelled because of budget/writer's strike,1378080000,,236,4.85
3022926,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Want to watch something that will cheer up your day/week/year? This is a wonderful, inventive, enchanting show. Such a pity there are but two seasons. A treasure!",1377993600,,162,5.037037037037037
3022927,5,B000YAA2SQ,I got totally hooked on this show after a couple of episodes. It brings a funny twist to a pretty morbid subject. I love the way Pushing Daisies is narrated. Overall a great show. I cannot believe they only made 2 seasons.,1377907200,,222,4.309523809523809
3022928,4,B000YAA2SQ,"The actors and the costumes in this show are great and the overall atmosphere exudes cheerful fun.  Despite that (and the fairytale voiceover) it is not childish or prudish, and it succeeds in making the frequent appearance of death into something more lighthearted than simply tragedy, yet still respectful and tasteful.  The whimsical nature of the show's world also supports a number of unusual plotlines, which makes it a refreshing watch.",1377907200,,443,5.225352112676056
3022929,5,B000YAA2SQ,One of the best sit-coms ever written.  Family entertainment with relationship values that have gone the way of the dodo bird... this series will warm your heart if you have any child in you at all...,1377820800,,200,4.555555555555555
3022930,3,B000YAA2SQ,Nothing more to say but I enjoyed the program very much and will probably not do any more ratings because I feel forced to say something when the stars say it all for me.,1377734400,,170,4.029411764705882
3022931,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This show was quirky sweet and colorful. I don't know why more people didn't watch it while it was on, but it is a shame it got canceled. Still, it is definitely still worth watching!",1377734400,,183,4.257142857142857
3022932,5,B000YAA2SQ,Impossibly cute love story with enough mystery to keep you from gagging. They did an excellent job at taking a grim plot and making it hilarious.,1377734400,,145,4.615384615384615
3022933,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Pushing Daisies is a delightfully quirky show with a unique premise and a great cast. The writing is fun and upbeat while always maintaining a campy, quick humor.",1377734400,,162,4.821428571428571
3022934,4,B000YAA2SQ,"I watched both seasons in a row, I loved it so much... Then waited a couple months and watched both seasons in a row again. I can believe they have some of the most ridiculous reality shows out there right now, and they cancel a great show with humor and musical talent.",1377561600,,270,4.211538461538462
3022935,5,B000YAA2SQ,Great show! Absolutely love it! Definitely one of the best story lines I've seen in a show in a long time!,1377561600,,106,4.095238095238095

3022937,5,B000YAA2SQ,Really hate the series got cancelled. I still enjoy watching it on amazon.  Good clean fun to be had by all,1377216000,,107,4.095238095238095
3022938,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Love this off-beat comedy!!!  Different and completely original, pushing daisies made me laugh non-stop.  So sad that it is not on TV anymore!!!",1377129600,,144,5.217391304347826
3022949,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This is a fantastic show that compares with some of the best cancelled classics. It's cheesy but in a very entertaining way. It kind of plays out a bit like Psych mixed with Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel, mixed with a third old-timey crime drama (sounds boring, but trust me--I'm from the internet). I would definitely recommend this along with some of my other favorites from similar genres: (if you like any of these you will likely *like* the others) Dead Like Me (show), Reaper (show), Lo (movie), and my favorite of all time, Wristcutters: A Love Story (movie). Enjoy my awful review that does not spoil a moment of this amazing show for lovers of quirky television case-by-case episodic adventures.",1377129600,,708,4.811475409836065
3022950,5,B000YAA2SQ,Lee Pace is adorable here as is the rest of the cast. This show is very fresh and new compared to other shows.,1377043200,,110,3.8260869565217392
3022951,5,B000YAA2SQ,"How can a show be funny, morbid, and sweet all at the same time, and still be extremely good? I have no idea, but Bryan Fuller does it EVERY TIME he makes a show. Pushing Daisies probably best showcases this bizarre mix of things. I miss this show so much!",1377043200,,256,4.14
3022952,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I love Pushing Dasies! It's such a fresh show that hasn't really been thought of before and it's nice to see something so creative done. However, I'm still bummed that they cancelled it!",1376956800,,186,4.666666666666667
3022953,3,B000YAA2SQ,I am not sure about this show .It is not peaking my interest. I started watching this show over a year ago and stop to look at something else. Not sure if I will finish it ...,1376870400,,175,3.7567567567567566
3022954,5,B000YAA2SQ,"It's been years since this show was off the air, but I really wish they would live up to the promise of a movie. Pushing Daisies is morbidly sweet - there's no other way to describe. While only 2 seasons, it's definitely worth watching.",1376784000,,236,4.386363636363637
3022955,5,B000YAA2SQ,"How can you not like this show, it's funny, witty, sad and romantic all at the same time.  Five stars for sure.",1376611200,,111,4.045454545454546
3022956,4,B000YAA2SQ,"I started watching this series when it first came out on TV and was intrigued by how a show with such a dark premise could have rich vibrant color. I fell in love with the 4 lead characters and their quirks. After watching an episode, I always want pie.",1376611200,,253,4.183673469387755
3022957,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Alas that this show was canceled after the second season. But whatever you do, do NOT let the fact that it was canceled deter you from watching it altogether. This show is quirky, dark, colorful, imaginative, witty, heartfelt (without being the least little bit sappy), extremely humorous, and all around brilliant. It is visually stunning, with bright colors and geometric shapes, fantastic settings, and beautiful vintage outfits. The characters are instantly likable, and that only increases throughout the two seasons. I doubt there has ever been a more unusual romance on television. There is NOTHING like this show. Watch and appreciate this short-lived but unique show.",1376611200,,676,5.386792452830188
3022958,5,B000YAA2SQ,Such beautiful editing and imagery!  I loved the first season and the story of Ned and Chuck.  The love triangle is sweet also.  Definitely a chick TV show.,1376524800,,156,4.5
3022969,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This show has clever dialogue, a winsome plot, appealing aesthetics and soundtrack.  I would highly recommend it - I've rewatched it a couple times.  I have never met anyone who saw a couple episodes of the show and did not like it.  It seems that folks I know have either really enjoyed it or never seen/heard of it.

The only bummer about the show itself is that it was cancelled after Season 2, however it does wrap up somewhat at the end.  The video and audio quality is good.  The dialogue is fast paced, so it's a shame there are no subtitles.",1376524800,,549,4.333333333333333
3022970,1,B000YAA2SQ,"While the discs were in tact the case was broken in three places, it can't even hold one of the discs in place. Very disappointed with this purchase, as I love the series.",1376265600,,171,4.212121212121212
3022971,5,B000YAA2SQ,"The first episode was a little weird to me but I quickly got used to the style of the show and fell in love with it. It is so cute and really good. I would definitely recommend. I'm so sad that by the time I found out about it it's already been cancelled for a couple years. Lee Pace is also a great actor, love him.",1376092800,,316,3.803030303030303
3022972,5,B000YAA2SQ,"The most romantic, beautiful show, with a who done it feel and witty, sharp, dialogue. A tragic victim of the writers strike, the show could have gone somewhere.",1376092800,,161,4.785714285714286
3022973,5,B000YAA2SQ,Same as my previous review for Season 2.  Great discovery of a show in its afterlife. Chenoweth as Itty Bitty...love her,1376092800,,120,4.714285714285714
3022974,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Every now and then Television gets together and makes a show that demonstrates what Television could be, but it only does it every decade or so and the show usually gets cancelled early. But then Television sits back and says to itself, ""Those fools, now at least they can see what they are missing when they accept reality TV and stupid crime dramas as if it were really entertainment.""

And some of us see it and mourn, knowing that every time one shows up it will be cancelled way too soon and we will have to wait a decade or so before another shows up.

""Pushing Daisies"" is such a show. It's been five years, I can't wait for the next one of these kinds of shows.",1376006400,,669,4.25984251968504
3022975,5,B000YAA2SQ,Love this series! Wish it was more then 2 seasons! Cast is fantastic and the whole premise is so unique.,1376006400,,104,4.25
3022976,5,B000YAA2SQ,Fantastic show! I cannot believe it only lasted 2 seasons. The world is so surreal and the actors and actresses are some if the best I've seen in a tv show.,1376006400,,156,4.064516129032258
3022977,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This was a good series that didn't last nearly long enough. I can't think of another series with such an inventive premise, certainly not now with the glut of shows involving zombies and vampires. All involve the undead (or alive again), of course, but not nearly as originally as Pushing Daisies. It occasionally goes a little overboard with the romantic sentimentality, but it's usually balanced out with a healthy dose of biting wit and childhood trauma. If I had one complaint, it would be that they never really gave the Olive character much to do besides moon over Ned. (That critique is also in light of the second season, which beat that storyline even further.) Olive was probably my favorite of the bunch; I just think she wasn't served well with that particular storyline going on so long. It didn't help that the series came to an end just as she was moving on. But that certainly didn't ruin the show for me. And Kristin Chenoweth is hilarious no matter what.",1376006400,,972,4.690058479532164

3022989,5,B000YAA2SQ,It was a series before its time killed by the writers strike and unfortunately Ned the Pie Man could not bring it back to life.,1376006400,,127,4.12
3022990,5,B000YAA2SQ,"BRING IT BACK. IT WAS A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Also Pie maker is yummy. And Chuck is cute, very good characters. Thanks! :)",1376006400,,113,4.7
3022991,4,B000YAA2SQ,This is a fantastically funny and creative show.  I really wish I had seen it when it was on originally and I wish even more that it hadn't been cancelled.  Do yourself a favor and check it out now :),1376006400,,200,3.975
3022992,5,B000YAA2SQ,The set design and actors are all splendid - especially Lee Pace. I would recommend this show to anyone - any age.,1375660800,,114,4.2272727272727275
3022993,5,B000YAA2SQ,Outstandingly well written and funny.  This series is great. My grandkids loved it as well.  All the series is built on this first episode.,1375660800,,139,4.75
3022994,5,B000YAA2SQ,This show is as wonderful as I remembered it from watching it when it was originally broadcast. Inventive dialog and visuals that manage to take a maudlin concept (the ability to resurrect people just long enough to find out how they died) and make it madcap and delightful. One of my all time favorites.,1375574400,,304,4.648148148148148
3022995,5,B000YAA2SQ,Every last character was brilliant.  Will watch it over and over again in the future.  Very few shows pull me in like this one did,1375574400,,130,4.16
3022996,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Fun, quirky and yet thought provoking.  Worth your time.  Sad it didn't last.  Lovely music and clever cast.  Ack, two more words.  Happy Amazon?",1375488000,,145,4.875

3023008,4,B000YAA2SQ,It was funny and light-hearted.  Storyline of bringing back the dead and its limitations -  different and fresh in a world saturated with reality tv.,1374883200,,149,4.92
3023018,5,B000YAA2SQ,The story unique and engaging.  The actors are wonderful and the strangeness of it all makes it a delightful experience!,1374710400,,120,5.0
3023019,5,B000YAA2SQ,I'm sad there was only 2 seasons of this show. I love that it was a mystery with an underlying story line of how Ned and Chuck love each other but can't express it physically. It is lighthearted and fun and just a joy to watch. They don't make shows like this anymore.,1374710400,,268,4.0754716981132075

3023022,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Extremely well written, well acted and beautifully photographed.  It is a joy to watch.  I find myself smiling with pleasure.  The writing is not amateurish and it is not written at a 5th grade level.  Very bright, witty, and full of extra meanings--you need an education to watch this and realize its full value.  It is also a treat to find a program that is not focused on bathroom humor, which becomes really old really fast.",1374364800,,428,4.578947368421052

With its delightful blend of fantasy and reality, its whimsical tone and its alternating shades of light and dark humor, ""Pushing Daisies"" is that rare television show that can satisfy even the most discerning of palates. Not for nothing, but it's also brilliantly written and acted as well. The worst I can say about the show is that occasionally it leans too far toward the absurd -- but that is offset by the considerable comedic talent of the cast.

If you're a Prime Member, you have nothing to lose by checking out the show. But even if you're not, the show is well worth your money.",1373328000,,625,4.681818181818182
3023062,5,B000YAA2SQ,I cried for weeks when this show ended. I really wish they would start filming it again. It is a visual delight!! Watch this show you will not be disappointed!,1373328000,,159,4.333333333333333
3023063,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I heard about this show a few years ago, while it was just beginning to air on TV I believe. I never got around to it until now and boy, if only I hadn't waited! This show is so clever and funny, the premise is very interesting, the characters are fantastic, and the actors all seem to be perfect for their roles! Pushing Daisies is a definite recommendation to anyone with eyeballs!",1373155200,,383,4.333333333333333
3023064,5,B000YAA2SQ,"During its time, one of the most amusing and tightly written shows on tv. I bought both seasons. The second season was a victim of the TV writer's strike and did not make it into a third. Get it to see the delectable Anna Friel in a standout role and to see the amazing Kristin Chenoweth in a dynamite supporting role. the writing is top-notch and the dialog crackles. The set decoration and the general palette of primary colors is eye-catching. I particularly liked the varied and most ingenious ways the show used to kill off each episode's victim.",1372982400,,551,4.575757575757576
3023065,4,B000YAA2SQ,Nice little quirky show. Not a lot of depth to the plots but that is kind of a nice break from reality.,1372982400,,103,3.727272727272727
3023066,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I wasn't expecting to like this series, but from the very beginning it had me hooked. I love the ethereal and quirky feel of the show. This is now one of my favorite shows. Wish there were more than 2 seasons!",1372636800,,209,4.121951219512195
3023067,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Love this show. Its colorful, sweet and satisfying just like eating pie at the pie hole. All the characters are full, round and brimming with wit. Its always interesting to see how chuck & ned figure out ways to overcome their non-touching relationship. I love that too as it truly adds a 40s romance feel to the show. The adventures of Ned, Emerson, Chuck & Olive always tie into the relationships which again serve the primary plot without being contrived. The acting is very high quality as well as the production.
I cant forget chucks mermaid aunts. They add a nice space outside of the pie hole adding yet another dimension into the characters youth and prior connection to each other overlapping with Neds 'talent. Highly recommend.",1372464000,,738,4.818897637795276
3023078,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I absolutely love this show and was very upset when they decided to cancel it. The writing was good, but most of all the imagination that went behind the stories was wonderful. I love the retro set design, the walt disney like imagery, the talented cast, and the clever writing! I really wish they would bring it back, would have loved to see how far the story of Ned and Chuck would have went, with out all the touching lol........I give Pushing Daisies 2 thumbs up!",1372291200,,467,4.441860465116279

3023098,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This show, which I once heard described as ""a formaldehyde fairy tale,"" is one of my absolute favorites. It is both clever and playful, both touching and whimsical. It takes joy in language, expression, and relationships while toying with the conceptions of life and death. Never without a moment to warm your heart, I can (and have) watch each episode many times over. Pushing Daisies, like it's main character, was tragically short-lived, but luckily that didn't spell the necessary ""end"" for either one.",1371686400,,506,5.108433734939759
3023099,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I liked the whole idea of the show. It's something I never thought of before. I love a good mystery ,so to be able to wake the dead and ask them what happened is such an interesting idea.",1371686400,,187,3.9473684210526314
3023100,5,B000YAA2SQ,I thought this was an excellent start to the series. The premise takes the classic detective story and gives it a unique twist that's thoroughly enjoyable.,1371340800,,155,5.0

3023105,4,B000YAA2SQ,"This quirky and visually delicious show was better than most offerings on TV today and I miss it!  While the subject matter itself is death and finding a ""use"" for it, it does not rely on graphic violence or carnality to keep the watcher entertained.  It is cerebral and sensual by way of actual artistry and talent in all its components.  I wish there were more shows today that actually required a thought process to ""get.""  If you feel the same, you'll love Pushing Daisies.  I only wish it were closed captioned, otherwise it would have received 5 stars from me.",1370995200,,566,4.564356435643564

3023107,4,B000YAA2SQ,Thoroughly enjoyed the entire series when it originally aired.  Rewatching it has been a little slow and not quite as good as I remember (few shows are) but I'm able to still smile as it goes so that's worth something.,1370908800,,218,4.45
3023118,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Unfortunately one of the best things I've seen on TV for a long time.  It's Funny, Touching, Witty, and Smart.  Unfortunate because all the good stuff usually gets cancelled to make room for more of the garbage that fills the airways now.",1370736000,,238,4.642857142857143
3023119,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Pushing daisies has it all. Mystery, love, humor , fantasy all wrapped in a package that is a feast for the eyes.

3023144,3,B000YAA2SQ,A lot of senseless but entertaining conversation which I tired of easily. It is a study in the direction our society is headed. A society in which relationships are superficial and transient. I lost interest after two episodes.,1369699200,,227,5.0

I watch the show with her and because she does not like any type of scary shows,  this show makes her feel like she is watching something scary. It's not a bad show but it is kinda hard to understand what it is really trying to get at, just watch a couple shows and see what you think",1369440000,,351,3.875

3023160,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I give this show five stars (first season). Overall, it is a excellently made show, above average in every regard (except the CGI; which suffered from a low budget). A witty, charming and entertaining storyline, combined with excellent actors, amazing visuals, wonderful sound and impressive sets truly state that this show was a labor of love for several people.

The overarching plot of death and resurrection would normally be something grim and difficult to tackle, however, due to the great writing, exceptional narration and unique style of the show, it proves to be funny, lighthearted yet still pull on heartstrings.

If you are looking for something to fall in love with, I recommend watching this show.",1369008000,,712,5.129310344827586

3023163,5,B000YAA2SQ,I love this series.  It is sad that it was cancelled.  I recommend it to all my friends.  The characters and plot are hilarious.  Kristen Chenowith sings a couple times throughout the season and it makes for very memorable moments.,1368662400,,231,4.7

3023198,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Pushing Daisies charmingly pushes the envelope beyond the usual serial TV fodder.  This show is rooted in a unique Vision--from navigating the dark threshold between life and death with a humorous and whimsical twist to the bold yet cozy settings imbued with vivid crayon box colors. If you're a fan of Wes Anderson's films, it's a good bet you will like this show.  The lead characters are positively irresistible, and the casting is nothing short of perfect. Well worth watching...",1367539200,,483,5.025

3023200,5,B000YAA2SQ,"The series is great- sweet without being cloying, and remarkably funny. I watched this on Blu-ray and found that the audio levels are a bit patchy, with some dialogue sections sounding unnatural, and with the opening music and some effects much louder than they should be- but the visuals are incredible, and I think that if you have a hifi system that lets you fiddle with the audio settings in detail the audio issues could be sorted a bit better than our system.",1367193600,,465,4.614457831325301

The show's whimsical characters and plotlines keep the episode's moving along. The over-arching story line is fun to follow and keeps me guessing. I love the actors in their roles. I also really like the sets-the bright colors and ""perfectness"" of the world the is as much a character of the show as the actors. It's the perfect back drop.
I like that this show is different from a normal romantic-comedy. It has much more to offer on many levels. What really caught me was that despite the wackiness of the show, the actors fit into their characters so well that the stories carry believability with them.

It is about Ned (the piemaker),  his childhood sweetheart, Chuck, and their unusual relationship.  You see, Ned has a gift of being able to bring back someone from the dead by touching them once; but touch them twice, and they're dead forever.  And, yes, he has touched his girlfriend once already, so the sad, sweet longing is always between them.

What a combination.  It is not what you think it is.  There is a surprise around every corner for the viewer and the characters alike. The show takes what could be a morbid subject and turns it into an adventurous, heartwarming and funny combination of events.  The synopsis called this show visually stunning and it is.  There are bright, almost fairytale colors in scenery and dress.  It is a little surreal but done well.  I can't wait to finish watching the rest of the seasons.

I suppose I can understand how it would not translate to the masses, but I'm going to assume that the timing just wasn't right and television audiences just weren't ready for a story like this.
The whimsical feel and look of the show really helps transport you to a somewhat familiar but absolutely Wonderland-like place filled with pies and bees and mysteries needing to be solved.
It's a terrifically fun adventure and feels very Wes Anderson inspired.

I won't detail the plot line as there are probably a million reviews that go into detail on that subject, but what I will say is that this is an utterly magical show and is a true, fun escape and a total breath of fresh air.

They've created a wonderful, otherworldly world that is almost real, but not quite really real -- more emotionally real -- all on purpose.

If you know Wes Anderson's work, it has a bit of that same feeling to it, where Anderson always sets his movies in slightly skewed versions of ours. I think this show is most similar looks-wise and feelings-wise to Anderson's delightful movie Moonrise Kingdom.

The main characters are fantastic and extremely well-acted. Even the supporting cast of characters are each so unique and quirky.

I freakin' love this show. It breaks my heart that it only ran for two seasons (even though it won a bucket-load of Emmys!). It just didn't get the advertising eyeballs the networked, so that was it.

My wife and I had a great time watching this show together.  Very sad it's over.  I think the only complaint I have about the show is that she and I sat in terror all the time because we were so worried that Ned and Chuck would touch and we'd cringe every time they came close.  So that kind of ruined some tender moments in the show since we were afraid that the plastic wrap they used to kiss through or the gloves they put on to hold hands would get holes or something..

It reminded me a bit of an adult version of the Series of Unfortunate Events (due to the narration, the almost cartoon-like setting, and the ever-progressing series of unfortunate events).

It is definitely not an overly sexual show which is refreshing to me. You can expect that every episode is packed with suspense, mystery, humor, and a lot of goodness. I can honestly say that there is not a single character in this show that I do not like. The characters are very multifaceted and innately good yet real human beings that you just can't help but feel for.

The directing is by far one of the best I've seen. The attention to detail and the ""every turn a surprise"" nature of the show just keeps me interested and eager for the next bit.

This show is great!
I remember hearing the title back when it was playing, but for some reason I never watched it.
I cannot remember what kind of show I thought it was, but whatever I thought it was I never even attempted to watch it.
Now I wish more than anything that I had watched it!

This show is beautiful, and I love every character in it.
In fact, I just finished watching the first episode for the first time and I am still laughing and crying.
There's a river of laughing going on inside of me right now.

I really loved the red head.
She was in the movie Land Of The Lost.
There is something special about her that I like.

The blond was great too, and I remember her in another movie about RVs.
She plays dumb, but she aint no dummy.
LOL

I love the aunts too.
One eyed Betty was funny too.

I hate the fact that this show was cut short.

3023414,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I watch a lot of TV shows, but none have quite struck me like Pushing Daises has. The story is about a pie-maker who has the fantastical ability to touch people and bring them back to life. However, there is a catch. He can only bring them back for one minute, and if they are alive for any longer, someone else must die to even the score between life and death. Emerson Cod, a money-loving large black man who brings an air of reality and much humor to show, is a private detective who teams up with the pie-maker to solve murders. Because the pie-maker can bring people back to life momentarily, he can ask them for clues on their murder. The murder victims are not gruesome and are shown in very clever, almost animated, fashions. Their deaths are never depressing, as the plot unfolds somewhat like a play, you keep a distance from their lives and a closeness with the lives of the main characters instead. Now, the murder-mystery-solving scenes comprise only a portion of the plot, as there is also the added twist that once the pie-maker touches a dead thing to bring it back to life, he can never touch it again or it will die, forever. The complication in this occurs when he finds himself waking his childhood crush, ""Chuck,"" and fails to touch her again within one minute. They fall in love, but must avoid contact at all costs. Olive, the adorable and musically talented Kristin Chenoweth, is madly in love with the pie-maker, and knows nothing of his powers. If you can imagine, seeing a relationship like that between the pie-maker and Chuck causes much confusion from an outside perspective. The filming is wonderful and makes every scene ""pop."" There's never a dull moment. It is masterfully creative and very artistic. Its makers utilized each character to their fullest degree, they are multi-dimensional, themed, and each display their individual acting talents. There is much more to say and see, but don't take it from me! I absolutely LOVE this TV show and highly recommend that you at least give it a try!!

3023429,5,B000YAA2SQ,"It's been years since I first saw Pushing Daisies on prime-time TV. I still miss this unique program and still haven't gotten over it being cancelled.

I agree with most good reviews about how great Chi McBride was as Emerson and Kristin Chenoweth as Olive and Anna Friel as ""Chuck"" and the handsome Lee pace as Ned the pie maker.  But I just wanted to make sure that those not on the screen gets the well-deserved accolades and kudos for their contribution to this very special but short-lived series. Without the great casting, without the creative team of writers, and the crew that makes the costume and designs the sets, I don't think this show would have been as perfect as it turned out to be. That and also, the great narrator Jim Dale who also has the perfectly timed storytelling down to an art form.  All the planets must've been aligned just so for this light, sweet and oh-so-fun series to have come together just at that moment in time.

3023492,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I started watching Pushing Daisies when it aired in 2007 and I immediately fell in love with it. I originally watched it because of the character interactions but the wacky, whimsical story lines kept me tuning in each week. This show is so unique from its unusual premise, quirky characters, charming settings, and witty dialogue that it's no wonder the writers, producers, and directors could blend the macabre and magical together in harmony. It's like Tim Burton, Dr. Seuss, and Disney got together and had a love child. Some describe this as Tim Burton on LSD or Dr. Seuss on ecstasy and I can't find error in those comparisons; I just think it's a little more in depth than an acid trip but parts of this show can be pretty trippy.

  I have read other reviews where people say it's too light, too cute, and/or too colorful to be taken seriously. I agree that it's light, cute, and colorful but that contrasts greatly against the fact that this show is about a man who can wake the dead. All sorts of moral and ethical dilemmas and questions are shown and touched upon like is it okay for Ned (the main male character) to bring his childhood sweetheart (Charlotte ""Chuck"", the main female character) back to life when the person to die in her place is a thief (or any bad guy)? Is it ethical for Ned and Emerson (the PI that teams up with Ned) to bring people back to life to find out who murdered them for them to collect the reward money? Just because Ned can bring the dead back to life, does that mean he should? Many questions are asked and some are answered but most are left up to the audience to decide.
  If you're interested in the moral and ethical, you can find it. The topics are there and are dealt with in a respectable, albeit politically correct and more liberal, manner. You're not going to find any proselytizing or much mention of religion (it is touched upon that Chuck and her father are Jewish) or religious Afterlife: only Joan of Arcadia comes to mind when being spiritual but not religious. Pushing Daisies brushes against spirituality but it's mostly a crime/mystery show so even the brief mentions of spirituality can easily be overlooked.
  If you want drop the heavy philosophy and watch this show just for the scenery, characters, and dialogue, you can do that too. The dialogue, scenery, and characters can sweep you away to Coeur de Coeurs and you can just have fun with the friendly banter and loveable romance of the two main characters. Even in the light and airy side of this show there are serious questions like what would you do if you couldn't touch the person you love? If you had a second chance at life, like Chuck, but couldn't let anyone know you were alive, what would you do? How would you handle yourself?  There is plenty in this show to keep both the philosopher and romantic entertained.

  The characters of this show live up to the title of `character'. First, there's Ned, the main male character, who bakes pies and wakes the dead. He has severe emotional issues stemming back to when his father leaves him at a boarding school at the age of eight and intimacy issues that stems from his ability to wake dead things so he doesn't like touching others too much. Then there's his antithesis in Charlotte ""Chuck"" Charles, Ned's childhood sweetheart, first kiss, and true love. Where Ned is very quiet and reserved, Chuck is vibrant, friendly, and full of life. Chuck's father died when she was eight--as a direct result of Ned bringing his mother back from the dead. Chuck's father took the place of Ned's mother when she collapsed from an aneurism only to die for good while kissing him goodnight, leaving Chuck to be raised by her two shut-in aunts, Lily and Vivian. Olive is a waitress at the Pie Hole, Ned's pie `restaurant'. She is deeply in love with Ned but because of his intimacy and emotional issues, and later the appearance of Chuck, her love goes unrequited. Olive becomes ""friends"" with Chuck once Olive learns Chuck faked her own death (at least that's the story Olive believes; she doesn't know about Ned's ability to wake the dead) and befriends Chuck's aunts.  Emerson Cod is the tough, wisecracking PI that teams up with Ned after he discovers Ned's secret of waking the dead. Emerson becomes a mediator when Chuck and Ned or Chuck and Olive or Ned and Olive or anyone has any problems. Lily and Vivian, Chuck's aunts, start out as shut-in agoraphobics but later (due to Chuck's meddling in the form of homeopathic-spiked pies and Olive's encouragements) become more adventurous and eventually gain back their former lives. Each character has their own quirks, strengths, and weaknesses along with secrets they try to keep from each other. It's like one big, dysfunctional family.
  One character you never see is the narrator, voiced by Jim Dale. He makes watching Pushing Daises feel as if you're watching a book being read (think the Grandfather in The Princess Bride) but he is constant throughout the show. He describes the beginning (normally a flashback to when Ned and/or Chuck is around eight), the crime, and emotions while providing a running narrative of what's happening. I can see how some can find him annoying because he does talk about 1/3 of the time and he tends to narrate the obvious. I like him; it adds to the feeling that this is being read from a book.

  For a show including murder mysteries (knowing too much, revenge, adultery, greed, theft, etc) and dealing with death on a weekly basis, the show handles showing the bodies quite well. Going along with the Burton/Seuss/Disney theme, the bodies aren't horribly gruesome and some are even comical. I wouldn't recommend little ones watch this show but tweens (8-12) could watch this because of the lack of blood and guts. In my opinion, the ""worst"" bodies include:
-burned to death (think the smoker in Beetlejuice),
-dog bite (a part of the man's jaw is missing; kind of shocking but you don't see anything and it's handled carefully with humor),
-run over by a car (a woman is cut in half but blood isn't shown; her top half is at the front of the van and her legs are sticking out the back of the van--it looks like she was stretched more than anything)
-bee stings (welts are all over the woman's body; this was the worst for me but I'm phobic with bees),
-pipe through the head/chest (nothing is graphically shown but it is shocking and, like the dog bite, it's handled with humor),
-death by escalator (a woman is show cut in half; there is blood but it's a pretty quick shot--this is probably the worst)
-eaten by shark (the woman is still inside the shark when Ned brings her to life but there is no blood or guts).
Other bodies include being trampled to death by a horse, stab victim, death by falling into a vat of taffy, frozen to death, drowning, falling, entrapment by concrete, death by falling chandelier,  fried to death, and head twisted backwards. I think I covered them all. Despite the horrible ways to die, the bodies aren't that horrifying. My mom and aunt, who can't watch NCIS autopsy scenes because of the bodies, can watch this show.
  For those who want to monitor they hear, I would be iffy with this show. It depends on what you consider a cuss/swear word. One of Emerson's favorite quips is ""Oh, Hell no!"", `damn' is uttered pretty frequently, `bitch' is used (one episode is entitled Bitches) a few times, and `God' is thrown around several times. It's considered TV-PG so it's not going to be worse than an average PG movie to a light PG-13 (think 10 Things I Hate About You or Catch Me If You Can). If you're sensitive to swear words then I would advise to shy away from this show: if you're thinking of letting a tween watch this, they've probably already heard worse at school but I would advise watching this with them in case they have questions or comments about what is said.

  I can understand how people can not like this show; it deals with very dark and grim topics (death is the main topic) in a light, colorful atmosphere that some think disrespectful and not serious enough. Many people like to have their comedies be true comedies, dramas be true dramas, and sci-fi be true sci-fi. There's nothing wrong with not liking this show because it's not your cup of tea but if you haven't watched it, I highly recommend watching at least the first two or three episodes. Like some, you might not enjoy this series so I would recommend watching the first few episodes or at least a few clips on YouTube first. I love this series enough that I will watch it on a semi-regular basis so I invested the money for both seasons. If you only like one or two episodes, you can buy them separately on Amazon Prime or through iTunes.",1316995200,,8719,4.610967741935484
3023493,5,B000YAA2SQ,I still think about some of the sets and visuals. When I first heard the premise about dead things coming back to life I wasn't really into it. I watched it years after it ended and was really pleasantly surprised. Really this was a super cute show with a 1950's like feel.,1314057600,,273,4.269230769230769
3023494,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I'm mesmerized by the kind of romantic fairy tale movies like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enchanted/dp/B0011U52EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enchanted</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elf/dp/B0002F6BRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elf</a>"", and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stardust/dp/B001AQR3IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stardust</a>"".

Those movies hold a special place in my heart...they are just over the top enough to be funny and heartwarming, but not so over the top that they feel like kid's movies.

Pushing Daisies is this type of asexual romantic fairy tale, but an entire TV series instead.

It is beautiful to watch, with well-used (if not a bit obvious) CGI graphics and a very whimsical color pallet and cinematography style.

Many have compared the visual style to the works of Tim Burton (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edward-Scissorhands/dp/B00004U8P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edward Scissorhands</a>"" comes to mind).  It also reminds me a bit of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Dreams-May-Come/dp/B001AQR3MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Dreams May Come</a>"" as far as the visual style goes.

In spite of the seemingly morbid nature of the show's premise and the dark comedy of many of the plotlines, it manages to not take itself too seriously.  It is mostly funny and heartwarming.

This series has been on my ""todo"" list but I never got around to purchasing the DVD set.  Then recently I decided to sign up for an Amazon Prime trial membership and was surprised to learn that as a Prime member I can watch it streaming in HD for free.

I don't want to sound like a shill for Amazon or anything, but I was rather impressed by this instant streaming ""bonus"" because frankly it came as a happy surprise.

After watching this series I'd be willing to fork out the money to buy the DVD set, but now for about the same price as buying the two seasons I can just stream it anytime I want like with Amazon's instant streaming service.  I'm thinking about keeping Prime and ditching Netflix, in no small part to discovering and falling in love with this show.",1313884800,,2290,6.25796178343949

Naturally, he teams up with a private investigating who exposes his talents and together they solve mysteries. (I mean, what else could he do?)

Ned, the pie maker is immediately tested by learning that the woman he loved as a child (Chuck), has died. He makes the hard decision of keeping her alive, while someone else passes on. Did I mention he could never touch her?

Review:

Too bad it was canceled! Olive Snook (played by Kristin Chenoweth) received an Emmy for her stellar performance. When she received the award she noted how it's odd to receive a reward for a show that was canceled. Pushing Daisies also received several other nominations and awards. The stories are cleverly written and the acting is on par. After awhile, the stories tended to drag on and seem mix to togetherl; all while your trying to keep up with the fast pace narration and dialogue. Mid way through many episodes I found myself getting lost through the dialogue, trying what to pick out what's important, and what was simply there for it's whimsical value.

For whatever reason, ABC decided to cancel the show while season 2 was still in production. I'm guessing mid/late year reviews were too poor for the show to continue. ABC did play the entirety of Season 2 on the regular show nights. All of the characters are likeable, even the ""villains"". All in all, a good watch!",1312329600,5,1532,4.642066420664206
3023496,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I adore these episodes... The cast of characters weave their own unique threads throughout each episode. The story lines seem to get better as they progress through the season.  When this show was on the air it was my weekly ""treat"".",1311984000,,233,4.682926829268292
3023497,5,B000YAA2SQ,"For the two weeks that I was watching this show from the first season to the second and last, I walked around in the greatest mood with a giant stupid smile on my face.  It is light, romantic, incredible sweet, witty, funny, intelligent.  It does not trivialize matters and it does deal with some pretty deep things, but it's a lesson in taking hard things in life lightly and still seeing the world with all its vivid colors and smiling about it.  Lovely show.  I wish there were even more of it.",1309737600,24,497,4.369565217391305

3023499,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This is such a great show. The visuals are stunning, the dialogue is fast-paced and smart, and the story is just fantastic enough to be delightful, but not so over-the-top as to be absurd.

Okay, I love the show. I love the colors, the score, the characters - everything. However, if I'm going to be honest, I do have one criticism. Here it is:

SPOILER ALERT

My one criticism was the character of Chuck. The writers didn't have to, but they basically made her into the Manic Pixie Dream Girl (look up the term on Wikipedia if you don't already know what it means.) Chuck's main purpose is to brighten Ned's dreary life - in fact, that's her ONLY purpose, because she's not even supposed to be alive! So, that's what the writers did. Instead of creating a three-dimensional female character, they inserted a trope. I suppose that was easier, and in a way, it fits the over-the-top style of the show. Kristen Chenoweth's character (Olive) is much more developed and unique than Chuck's, yet she is cast as a Supporting Actress - hell, her character was so well-rounded and so liked that she won an Emmy Award for it! So, that's my one criticism of Pushing Daisies. No television show is perfect, and it's still an excellent show that I would recommend to anyone.",1304812800,,1262,4.6
3023500,2,B000YAA2SQ,"I liked this show at first, and was fascinated by the subject matter.  It was clever, well written, well acted, and all around a captivating story.  I really liked the juxtaposition of the dark and light, the grim and the funny, the nightmare and the dream.  I waited eagerly every week to see what new twists and turns the story would take, and how long they could keep it going.

Unfortunately, about two thirds through the first season, the series started running out of steam.  The same jokes kept getting rehashed over and over, and the story began to take on the almost desperate tone of a TV series that had been on the air for too many seasons.  Except, in this case, it was only one season.  I found myself bored and disappointed before the end of season one, and thought it needed to be wrapped up gracefully as possible.

The plot had been brilliant, but did not provide enough soil to grow a whole crop of ""Daisies""!  I am honestly sorry that this idea was expressed in a long, laborious TV series, instead of a feature length film or made for TV movie.  The subject matter could have been adequately explored in a 2 hour time slot, and at least there would have been an end to the story that had a limited amount to say.  This could have been a quirky masterpiece, but it was compromised by an attempt to make it more than it really was.  I am not surprised it was cancelled after season two - they ran out of things to say LONG before the first season ended.  I didn't bother watching season 2 when if was first aired, but I am a member of Netflix, and when it showed up on instant streaming I gave the second season a chance.  I was so bored that I couldn't make it all the way through the first episode of season 2.  After the first few minutes, I remembered why I had lost interest before.

A lot of people liked this show and were loyal to the end.  Those people don't need a review to tell them whether or not to buy this series.  However, if you have not seen it, you might benefit from watching clips on YouTube before purchasing.  Or another idea for those who subscribe to NetFlix - both seasons are avaliable to members through DVD or instant streaming. ALSO:  MY PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS BOTH SEASONS FOR FREE - you should check with your library.  Why spend the money buying it unless you know for sure you will like it?  Just watch it at one of the free venues and see if you like it before you buy it.

Just my humble opinion, but after the initial rush of interest, I ran out of gas on this one.",1294099200,15,2518,4.254736842105263

3023522,1,B000YAA2SQ,I can see how people love the show but it was not my cup of tea. I loved the main character's acting and he was a delight to watch :) but the show never hooked me in and counting down to the second was fairly annoying. It is an acquired taste show so if you haven't seen it before I would rent the first disk or watch a clip on You Tube before you spend your money.,1292025600,20,365,3.7532467532467533
3023523,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Don't know why when they put all the effort and money into making a show they do the spend a fraction of time and money on marketing it.  This isn't the first show that's been pulled off air when no one really knew it was on air in the first place and unfortunately it probably won't be the last.  Like with Dead Like Me though, maybe when the DVD gathers a legion of fans we'll see a movie down the track.  Hopefully they do a better job than the movie version of Dead Like Me though.

Pushing Daisies is a light set in a surreal world comedy.  It ponders the question if you could bring the dead back to life, firstly would you?  Add in the if you do so and don't touch them again (which permanently leaves them dead) then an innocent nearby will immediately die.  So would you still do it?  For a pie maker named Ned this is his dilemma.  He's decided to use his gift/curse for good and teamed up with a private detective to make a bit of money on the side as well.  As long as he obeys the one minute only rule he can touch and bring back a murder victim, and ask them who killed them.  Easy money, usually, well it wouldn't be much of show if there wasn't twists and challenges to each murder. Throw in the fact that one day a victim is his childhood crush whose father died when Ned didn't understand the rules and you add a whole other element to this great show as Ned and Chuck (the woman) try to have a relationship when they can't touch each other, ever or she'll die. Set in a Dr Seuss looking version of the real world with giant props, bright colours and actors talking a bit unnaturally most of the time, I can understand why some people don't like it. A more realistic version might have worked too but so does this.

I also like how you see a lot of stars from TV shows which were made after this such as Glee, Community and others either as regular characters such as pie shop worker Olive or as the murder victims.  The, hey that's whoever from that show, is a nice bonus each time you watch a new episode of this fun show.",1288310400,,2042,4.139240506329114
3023524,5,B000YAA2SQ,"My wife and I happened upon the pilot show by accident and were thrown for a loop during the first opening segments.  Even though we both stared at each other over how quirky the show was, we both laughed knowing that we would fall in love with it despite ourselves.  Pushing Daisies ended up being one of the few shows we watched regularly on TV.

The writing is excellent on its own, but the actors really bring it all to life.  They perform well in conveying the emotionally complex issues addressed in each episode, and each brings enough to the show to make the characters stand out as individuals that compliment one another and the overall story.  The show's design, although slightly different, paints a great backdrop as well.

Overall, it's a great series that shouldn't have been canceled.  It unfortunately was first put out right at the beginning of the writer's strike and never had a chance to pick up steam.  I'd suggest this show to anyone.

With that said, the sense of humor can be a bit quirky, so it isn't for everyone.",1287446400,,1040,4.578378378378378

  It happens from time to time:  a television network cancels a truly original and artistic television series because it does not receive the ratings that the network believes it should be receiving for that time slot.  Quality of programming is no longer considered by these networks as valuable.  Whatever generates the most advertising revenue for the network appears to be the name of the game.  A casualty of this whore of a policy (and the untimely WGA strike during its pilot season) is ABC's mystery/fantasy noir Pushing Daisies, one of the most creative television series ever.  It is a shame and a sham that the series was not allowed to run its course.

  Sadly, television viewership has turned towards the glitz/glamour/faux reality/sickly sweet musicals.  Quick, witty shows are no longer found on television (Arrested Development, anyone?); every network seems to have a ""reality"" talent show, some type of police investigation show, a carousel of formulaic sitcoms and dramas.  It is so rare that a show of immense quality and entertainment value comes along.

  The whole concept of the show is brilliant: a pie maker can bring dead things back to life, but for only one minute or something else of equivalent life value will die after that minute; he must retouch the thing brought back to life to take it back to being dead; a private investigator discovers this power and exploits it to solve murders and claim the reward for solving the murders; it turns out his childhood love is murdered and he chooses not to take her back to being dead - all in the pilot episode (""Pie-lette"").  The rest of the series is devoted to the implications of the pie-maker, Ned's, power and his decision to let his childhood love, Chuck, keep on living.  It explores the notion of not being able to ever touch the one you love again.  There is a terrific cast of brilliantly acted characters.  Chi McBride and Kristin Chenoweth are flawless in their supporting roles.

I've seen an episode or two of Friends, which I found tedious and glib, and Seinfeld, which never really grabbed me. I enjoyed the brief-lived Andy Richter series, but that is probably the last one I saw with regularity. I had never heard of Pushing Daisies before my daughter gave it to me as a gift, and I was not expecting much when I looked at the packaging. But I (and my wife) have been repeatedly surprised and pleased. Season 1 offers 9 episodes of clever writing and gorgeous photography, and mostly lovely acting. I am grateful we got the HDTV; the colors just explode out of the screen. And with the multiple cameras and extensive birds-eye shots it is, as someone else here says, like watching 40 minute feature films.

With 140+ sterling reviews already published, there's not much I need to add. I would say, though, that with the above mentioned Friends and Seinfeld, the acting was always acting. I could never lose sight of the fact that these were highly paid people mouthing (or mugging) lines written for them. In Pushing Daisies though, the acting is so smooth and so pleasant, that even though the plots are outlandish and the magic very magical, the skillful performances of nearly everyone make it a joy to watch.

The show keeps my interest then, not through the strange problems the characters face, but through the characters themselves and their funny, off center dialogue.  It reminds me of the innocence of childhood and carefree nature of that first love.  It is a wonderful little show that has captivated many people, and it's well worth the time it takes to watch the two seasons.

3023593,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Created by Bryan Fuller (""Wonderfalls"", ""Dead Like Me""), ""Pushing Daisies"" is a marvelous show filled with quirky humor, primary colors and a whimsical narrator who provides us with plenty of info on the characters in packing enough delight for a feature film into 22 minutes.

Ned (Lee Pace)can bring the dead back to life. He can only do it for a minute though because if it's longer someone else will die in their place. When his childhood sweetheart ""Chuck"" (Anna Friel)is killed, Ned breaks his own rule. He finds his partnership with a private detective (Chi MacBride)that he splits reward money with strained when Charlotte aka ""Chuck"" is kept alive. Of, did I mention the pies and Olive (Kristin Chenoweth)who works for him at the Pie Hole and is in love with Ned? No, of course not. So this is sort of a murder mystery/comedy and occasionally candy colored musical--among many other things.

The DVD transfer for the show looks terrific capturing the candy colored primary colors of the show perfectly.

The only drawback is that this DVD only contains the first 8 episodes. The run was interrupted by the WGA strike and a handful of episodes were broadcast after it ended. There may even be a few more unaired - and it would have been better if ALL the episodes shot (even if unaired) had been put on a single DVD. Would have been worth the wait. Just in case, I decided I didn't want to miss a bird in the hand. The show is quirky and may not be for all tastes, but I can almost guarantee that if you watch the first - you'll be hooked.

Naturally, it has been cancelled. (If I like it, it will be cancelled...)
This is my first BluRay disc purchase, and I will say it looks absolutely beautiful. (My PS3 now has a purpose).
The unique cast of characters and their individual talents are truly highlighted by this creative series, and keeps you waiting for the next installment to see the ever growing stories plot start to unfold.
Even though the series was cut down in the prime of its life by the idiots at ABC that simply would not air it when it was scheduled, and the writers strike that gave it the final blow, it's still worth watching.
Hopefull greed will force them to release season two and the unaired episodes that were filmed and then canned. If ever there was a series that took full advantage of the HD format - This is it. All the scenery is brilliantly colored, and shot in some very creative ways.

This show was pure escapism candy-coated in the most gorgeous cinematography and set design ever to appear on a network show.  I was very sorry to hear that it would not be renewed and will never forgive abc for throwing the last three episodes into limbo.

If you're wondering if Amazon's customer service rep is warranted, I have to tell you it is.

3023652,5,B000YAA2SQ,"The basic plot of this series is about a boy, Ned, who discovers that he is able to bring people back from the dead by touching them; however, not without conditions and consequences.  He finds out that if he touches them again, they die and if he doesn't touch them again within a minute, another dies in their place.  Parts of the stories are narrated and take place when Ned is a man working in a pie shop.  He takes on a side gig with a detective where he brings the dead back to life (for less than a minute, with the exception of his childhood love, Chuck, whom he allows to live and who joins in on their adventures) to ask how they died so that they can collect the reward money.  While the murder mysteries are what may seem like a huge focus of the series (some dislike the series since the cases are not so difficult and not so gruesome), the real story is about the human interactions, internal conflicts, and personal development.  The stories are always really cute and leave the viewer feeling more light and happy.  Definitely worth watching.

This is an amazing show, so of course the DVD is TERRIFIC! I just can't understand why ABC is pulling a show from its line-up that so many people love ... that ABC did NOTHING to promote ... that has quick witted plots & dialog (the writing is phenomenal!) ... an EXCELLANT cast ... amazing characters ... a beautiful colorful set ...unexpected story lines that are full of twists and turns and HUMANITY ... problem solving (in other unexpected way) ... IS NOT ANOTHER REALITY SHOW (if I wanted that I'd watch my family) ... the filming of the show itself is beautiful... the direction is wonderful ... the cast is just so cute in their parts ... the only negative thing I have to say about it is that ABC has cut the show, so there will only be one more DVD set (2nd season to follow). Unless by some miracle, some other station picks the show up, I pray daily for that to occur! I have to say that this is the only show on television that made me laugh after I lost my brother! It's about a guy that with one touch of his finger can bring the dead back to life, but only for one minute, if he doesn't touch the person again and put them back, then someone else near by will drop. He has issues with his 'gift'. The magic finger guy is Ned (Lee Pace), a very shy guy - he also owns a pie shop called 'The Pie Hole' where he and his staff of friends make culinary pie magic! He teams up with a detective, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride), who is a private eye murder investigator. The two of them bring the murder victims back, for 59 seconds, hopefully long enough to find out who killed them, then they solve the murder and collect the reward ... or that's how it's supposed to work, a sticky situation sometimes. Ned 'reanimated' his long lost love, Charlotte Charles *nick-name Chuck*(Anna Friel), but of course he can't touch her or she'll be toes-up again ... makes for some interesting love scenes. Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth)is a former jokey that works now at 'The Pie Hole', who is in love with Ned, becomes best friends with Chuck *Charlotte Charles*,and eventually (in season 2) becomes a kind of side kick helper to Emerson Cod ... all without knowing about Ned's magic finger! There's also Chuck's two 'aunts' that CAN'T know that she's 'alive' (Swoosie Kurtz & Ellen Greene) who are hysterical! I know it sounds strange, and it kind of is, I can't do it justice, but it is a remarkable show & has a slew of guest stars! Just pick any episode and just watch it ... you'll be hooked and want to watch them all ... then you'll be praying some other station picks up the show that is ABC's loss. Personally, I'm selling my Disney/ABC stock, & I don't care what I get for it ... they didn't listen to the fans, so this fan is leaving! 'Pushing Daisies' is wonderfully fun and visually exciting, give it a try! I always feel a bit lighter and happier at the end, it's just a fun show that during these economically and internationally hard times takes you away from it all!",1231977600,3,3347,4.841186736474695

One would think that week after week seeing Ned bring people back from the dead for a minute to find out their killer would get boring and the plot would be predictable, but it is always a delight.
I, along with many of you who fell in love with this treasure, have written to ABC expressing my feelings towards their ridiculous decision. I know that these are hard times and everyone is trying to make sure that their decisions make financial sense. But then again, during these hard times should we not have something that can give us hope and bring us the kind of joy that this show brings to many of us??!

This show has the best dialogue, the best cast of characters, the best premise, the best narrator...it's droll and whimsical, the sets are Tim Burton-esque as someone else mentioned...and like others mentioned it feels so well produced it's like watching a little film every week. I felt my heart breaking tonite after watching the episode from Wednesday 12/17 - I don't want this to end. I love visiting Cour-de-Cour every week...I want to find out how Ned and Chuck will keep their love alive without being able to...(well, I don't want to spoil it if you haven't seen it) I can't believe who Ned's father is...I want to see Olive find true love...

It's one of the cleanest shows on TV, too - clean and still wonderfully funny and quirky and endearing and hilarious and ....oh dagnab it - WHYYY are they cancelling it? Anyhow, I'm buying season 1 in hopes that they will see people buying it and keep the show on the air (maybe?)....and because it's awesome, of course.",1229558400,2,1068,4.680851063829787
3023740,5,B000YAA2SQ,"The word most commonly used to refer to this show is ""quirky"".  :)

Ok, so there's this kid who finds out he can bring dead things to life by touching them. But if he leaves them alive something else dies... and if he touches them again they die too, forever. He finds this out when his mom dies, and he touches her to bring her back, and his best friend's dad dies in return, then his mom gives him a kiss and she dies too...

Sounds totally grim and awful, no? But it's one of the most fantastic shows I've ever, ever seen. It's witty and funny and light and beautiful, full of clever writing and sweet characters but kept from becoming too saccharine by the unrelenting theme of death. Death and love and pie.

The show invariably gets wonderful reviews, but while the people who do watch it are utterly enchanted - you don't see many bad comments on the show, it's just so very well made - not quite enough people watched it. So due to the not-quite-high-enough ratings and our current economy, the show gets canceled partway through the second season, but the writer has said he would like to finish the plot-threads in a comic book form or perhaps a TV movie. The network has not objected to such ideas.

3023771,5,B000YAA2SQ,"PUSHING DAISIES is a rare treat.  It creates a charming modern fairy tale romance with wit, humor, and creativity and the show's technical flair of bringing its magical world to life is matched only by the heart of its storytelling.

But my review isn't intended to sell you on the show.  If the multitudes of gushing reviews here don't do it for you, then perhaps the show just isn't for you.  Instead, I thought I'd share a little more about the contents of the set to help you decide on your potential purchase...

3 discs of pie-eating goodness...
Each disc contains 3 of the 9 episodes that comprise the short-lived Season 1.  The presentation is rather simple.  No trailers, no top menu.  After the copyright warnings and the Warner Bros logo, they start directly into the episodes.  The show is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen and also contain a short end credits sequence where you have a chance to listen to a brief arrangement of James Dooley's beautiful music.  This may vary on the area, but I don't recall ever seeing this bit aired on my local television station, so it was something new to see and hear for me.  The blu-ray popover menus allow you to select language options and episodes.  The third disc also contains the extras...

""delicious interactive featurettes""
If by ""interactive"", they mean clicking through countless menus to watch its 18 mini-featurettes, then sure, let's call it interactive.  Not that I really needed anything more interactive than that.  :)  But in any event, there are indeed featurettes and they are indeed delicious.  Once you navigate to the ""Pie-Time"" menu, you can click on an episode name in order to watch one or more of its featurettes.  Navigating between each episode featurette menu is a bit slow and cumbersome and very ""DVD-like"".  I wish the extras menu could have been overhauled just a bit to take advantage of some of the quicker Blu-ray menu capabilities, but I suppose staring at all the pies while waiting for the next menu to load isn't all that bad...

All in all, there's around 43 minutes worth of featurettes, which typically contains one or two folks from the cast or crew commenting on clips or content from the episode.  Alas, Lee Pace is the only cast member to make an appearance.  The lengths of these featurettes is a bit disappointing, with some of the lasting barely a minute.  Each featurette flies by in a heartbeat, leaving you wanting for more.  It was rather surprising when I noticed that they all add up to over 40 minutes.

In case you care, here are the lengths of each featurette:
- Pie-Lette (3.24 / 1:46 / 2:53)
- Dummy (1:41 / 3:24)
- The Fun in Funeral (2:12 / 2:29)
- Pigeon (1:05 / 2:40)
- Girth (1:10 / 0:56)
- Kitchen (3:00 / 1:46)
- Smell of Success (1:58)
- Bitter Sweets (1:42 / 2:33 / 6:09)
- Corpsicle (1:32

Overall, the featurettes take some clicking to watch, but they're all worth it, if you like the show.  It would have been nice, had they simply combined all the shorts into a single indexed program for ease of viewing.  For extras, 40 minutes isn't too bad, but for a show with such a great ensemble cast and so rich in effects, I had hoped for a little more.  But nonetheless, I'm happy enough.

If you're fan of the show, this seems like a no-brainer to me.  Unlike other TV sets that I've bought, I've found myself popping in PUSHING DAISIES a few times and still thoroughly enjoy it.  I hope the above info has been helpful.

On a final note, as of this writing (November, 2008) it appears that Pushing Daisies has been cancelled.  If you are so inclined, please consider joining one or more of the campaigns to save the show.  Thanks!",1227484800,8,3652,4.574730354391371

The show keeps a lighter tone although it deals with a murder of the week.  Primary colors are used a lot in the costumes and sets to set a unique tone.  Much of the cast has musical stage experience so it is put to use.  Once in awhile Chenoweth breaks into song, even singing next to a janitor in a choregraphed number.  The dialog is unique too.

As a huge fan of stories about the after life, ghosts, psychics, murder mysteries and generally gothic type subject matter I was fascinated. My mistake was not watching it first on t.v. before I ordered it.

The premise of this show sounds fascinating. A man with powers to awaken the dead for sixty seconds at a time teams up with a private eye to solve murders. Sounds great! But alas, this show tries very, very, very hard to be witty, whimsical, imaginative and just darn cute. Imagine Dr. Seuss meets Pee Wee's Playhouse meets a bad David Lynch imitation. The main character owns a pie resteraunt that looks like something out of a poor man's Tim Burton movie. The dialouge sounds like a bunch of clipped, forced one liners. The story is narrated by a horrifically annoying British character whose purpose is unclear except maybe one of the creators read somewhere that smug British sounding types lended whimsy to a story.

3023899,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Welcome to The Pie Hole, home of The Piemaker, Ned, with a highly unusual ability to bring the dead back to life - but for 1 minute only, or else someone must die in their place - that has been put to the dual purpose of making pies from formerly-rotting fruit and for solving murders. The catch? That The Piemaker can never touch what he brings to life, or else they die forever.

Couple murder-mysteries with the ""reanimation"" of Ned's ertwhile childhood sweetheart Chuck and some of the most hilarious scriptwriting this side of Wonderfalls and Dead Like Me, and you have Pushing Daisies, some of the freshest, most original writing to ever grace the TV screen.

While the first season is unseasonably short due to the writers' strike, that only helps to make the season very afordable on disc. It's well worth it - and your funny bone won't forgive you if you don't.",1224288000,2,870,4.606451612903226
3023900,4,B000YAA2SQ,"At a time when some of the best quirky new writing on television had fled to cable (EUREKA on Sci-Fi, MONK, PSYCH and BURN NOTICE on USA), PUSHING DAISIES burst on the TV world on broadcast television (ABC) on October 3, 2007, as something of a revelation.

High concept (""The Pie Maker"" can re-animate the dead with his touch - but only for one minute without dire consequences - a second touch returns the subject to ""natural"" and irretrievable death), with deeply affecting plot twists (two of his early rescues are his beloved pet dog, Digby - a well used golden retriever inexplicably unidentified in the printed cast list - and the girl, Charlotte Charles - a/k/a Chuck, who is the love of his life - leading to some delightful product placements in the service of romance), high comedy (incongruous conversations with the messily dead in the service of solving their deaths - this is a comedy/mystery - have no right to be this funny) and perfect casting (Lee Pace as The Pie Maker, Anna Friel as Chuck and the sublime reactor Chi McBride as charmingly semi-slimy detective Emerson Cod are ably supported by a perfect mix of seasoned stage actors making the transition to screen work seem as natural as pie making), this show was effortlessly the most delightful high style new comedy aired in years. The only real question was how the creators could possibly keep the high concept airborne for additional seasons (even in modern seasons of inexcusably frustrating brevity - at only 9 episodes, this strike shortened first season seems almost bountiful).

The DVD package is enhanced with a nice ""behind the scenes"" featurette which is unfortunately rather too cleverly broken up into brief segments you have to access by clicking on individual ""pie slices"" like a bad session of Trivial Pursuit, but the only real quibble to be made with the issuers' packaging is the disappointing choice to waste the cover of the plastic box with a generic ""Pie Hole"" Menu (The Pie Hole is the awkwardly named restaurant/bakery in the show run by The Pie Maker) and relegating traditional ""cover material"" to only the outer cardboard wrapper which is often lost after purchase. Someone someday must explain why this environmentally unfriendly wrapper is desirable, let alone necessary.

The joke of the menu is *nicely* used for the INSERT listing cast and episodes with original air dates and further content of the discs. Having each of the three discs patterned after a specific pie (apple, cherry and pumpkin) appropriately labeled with a printed paper doily under at least the last (the white inside tray for discs one and two serves the same subtle purpose for them), is very clever - but the pie jokes in packaging should probably have been left at those two gestures.",1224201600,3,2768,4.885106382978724

And, surprisingly, enough people watch it for it NOT to get cancelled!  If we're in the renaissance of television--which judging on how many great shows are either in production or on their way, we definitely are--this show is a marker to show that audiences are ready and willing for something different.

There are so many different tastes baked into the pie that is ""Pushing Daisies"" that, at first, it seems like there is too much.  The characters first appear to be caricatures, which makes it all the more relevant when they are fleshed out.  Their little acts of kindness to each other in this non-saccharine show seem so tiny but mean so much.  Each episode is driven by detective work, romance, exploration of death, fantasy, pie making, and fairy tale intrigue that some say is reminiscent of Burton, but I'd say that Bryan Fuller's end product here is more like what Burton aims for but just misses.

It's not as instantly spectacular as Fuller's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Like-Me/dp/B0001GF2F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Like Me</a>, nor can I say I love it as unconditionally as his last show,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonderfalls/dp/B0006GAO18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonderfalls</a>.

3023926,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Pushing Daisies is one of the most unique shows on television. It's about a piemaker named Ned (Lee Pace) who as a boy finds that he can bring anything back to life with one touch. One touch brings life and the 2nd touch makes them die again but for good. However, if someone is brought back for longer than a minute someone has to die in their place.

  Ned helps a detechtive (Chi McBribe) by bringing back victims for a minute to find out who killed them. But when his childhood sweetheart Chuck (Anna Friel) is murdered he finds that he can't let her go after he brings her back. Which leads to frustration for both of them through-out the series since they love each other but can't touch or she'll die again .

  The show is brilliant and colorful with great visuals and narration that sounds similar to Boris Karloff's in How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Despite only having 9 episodes in it's first season it still managed to get a few Golden Globe nominations. It deserved them though since it's one of the funnest, imaginitive and even most romantic shows on television. The cast is perfect as well.",1223596800,2,1108,4.515

3023928,4,B000YAA2SQ,"Pushing Daisies is that rare kind of show that never stops surprising. You end up enjoying every single episode, as outlandish as they are, and liking every single character on the show. Its premise, though far-fetched, is enjoyable and fresh.

A man who can revive the dead with the touch of his finger might be in better shape than Ned the Piemaker. He seems sad in his life. Yes, he can bring back dead things to life, but if they remain alive longer than a minute, then something else in the world has to die. He is alone in his life, or at least, he feels that way. That's why he's decided to drown his sorrow in his pie shop, where his quirky waitress, a perfect and adorable Kristin Chenoweth, is secretly in love with him. In all honesty, Chenoweth is the reason to watch this show. I can't seem to get enough of her!

Ned's life takes a sharp turn when, while investigating the death of a young woman, he ends up reviving his childhood crush, Chuck. Once she's back to life, he can't seem to kill her again and, soon enough, love is in the air between the dead girl and the piemaker.

Every episode is written as a small mystery in which Ned and his gang of colorful characters investigate a death. He revives the dead for a minute in order to receive clues that could help them solve the myseteries behind their death. These moments are always funny and fresh.

But what amazes in the show, besides the incredible performances, is the cinematography. The show is incredibly beautiful to look at. The colors are vibrant, the sets original, the costumes always over the top. Its always a pleasure to watch this show.

Sure, being a fresh series, it has its share of small problems. Lee Pace (Ned) often tries too hard to be cute and Chuck is just too good for her own good. And yet, these small flaws take nothing away from this show. I ended up watching the entire first season in three days. I just couldn't stop. I can't wait to see where the second season will now take me.",1223510400,,1985,4.397820163487738

Check it out, you won't regret it!",1223251200,2,311,4.032258064516129
3023930,4,B000YAA2SQ,"From ISawLightningFall.com

At first blush, ABC's Pushing Daisies seems a little too precious for its own good. You notice it first in the cinematography, so bursting with color it's almost eye-searing. Then there's the omniscient narrator who sounds as though he's reading from Grimm's Fairy Tales and who almost always refers to characters by their professions. Hence, the show's protagonist, Ned, becomes The Piemaker since he peddles goodie-filled pastries from a restaurant called The Pie Hole. That's not all Ned -- excuse me -- The Piemaker does. He investigates mysterious deaths with a knitting detective named Emerson and dodges the affections of his love-struck employee Olive. Also, he pines after his childhood sweetheart Charlotte (or Chuck, as he prefers to call her), who he can never have because of a deadly secret.

Sound too saccharine? A little self-consciously screwy? It would be, except for that part about Ned's talent. You see, he can raise the dead. Murders are much easier to solve when you talk with the victims afterward. One touch from Ned and they're alive. Another and they're dead again. But if they stay in this mortal coil for more than a minute, someone else must shuffle it off. He's raised and put down a ghastly menagerie. A businessman mauled by a rottweiler. A pilot thrown through a plane's windshield during a crash. A student incinerated in an explosion. But there's one victim he can't bear to touch a second time, a lonely tourist who was strangled on a cruise ship. That victim is Chuck.

Combining mirth and the macabre is tough, but Pushing Daisies pulls it off. It also provides something of an object lesson. Be it dark or light, an overly narrow tonal range hampers a story, thinning its audience and stripping it of conflict. Why care if you immediately know the perky blonde will win the hunk with little fight or end up disemboweled by the creeping horror? Variation makes things interesting. Marrying opposites sometimes makes them compelling.",1223164800,,2000,5.018072289156627

On a TV Guide level, I suppose it might be difficult to describe a show like this, much less give it a full on critical review, given the mix of comedy, tragedy, romance, and mystery.

On another, very simple level, the one that resonates, and which makes it work oh-so-very-well, is that whatever twists and turns it throws at you, the jokes, the intrigue, the side-stories of the victims who's murders they solve, at the end of it all, this is a love story.

'course, all the little things it adds along the way don't exactly hurt.

All in all, wonderful show that does a great job of making you truly feel for the characters like not many stories can, and the production values for the bluray version are the best anyone could ask for, from the field of daisies in the opening sequence, to Digby's fur.

In all honesty I cannot critique it with negativity other than to warn that it is a bit different than the usual tv show.

A palette of pastel and brightness makes up a modern fairy tale that should be all sorts of macabre considering the subject matter but instead manages to be bright and cute, a flashy setting and story balanced with many instances of brilliantly understated acting.  The storyline and concept are whimsical in nature.  The casting and acting are superb.  Some may be shocked at the pragmatic approach to the power over life and death and exceedingly creative murders, but to me it's all part of the charm.

3023988,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This show is like nothing you have ever seen before.  And that is a good thing.

It is the story of the Pie Maker aka Ned (Lee Pace).  To the world, he is best known as the owner of The Pie Hole, where he serves delicious pies with his assistant/waitress, Olive (Kristen Chenoweth).

But Ned has a secret.  With his touch, he can bring the dead back to life.  Of course, there are some conditions.  If he touches them again, they are dead for ever and ever.  And if he doesn't touch them again in one minute, someone else nearby dies instead.

Since The Pie Hole doesn't pay all the bills, Ned works with private investigator Emerson Cod (Chi McBride).  He brings murder victims back to life to find out who killed them, then the two split the reward.

Everything is going along fine until the next murder victim is the girl he calls Chuck, aka Charlotte Charles (Anna Friel).  Chuck was Ned's childhood sweetheart, and he just can't bear to let her die, so he keeps her alive.  While the two build a non-touch romance, Chuck's two aunts, Vivian and Lily (Ellen Greene and Swoosie Kurtz) mourn her death.

But Chuck's death is just the beginning of the weird cases.  There are the human crash test dummies, the dog breeder with four wives, the bodies in the snowmen, and the exploding scratch and sniff book.  And that doesn't even mention my favorite case, the headless horseman who is after Olive.

So by now I'm sure you've figured out just how weird this show really is.  But it is so much fun, too.  While it is a mystery, the mysteries are only a background to explore the relationships of the characters in the show.  Each week, those relationships advance, grow, and change.  You never know just where they will wind up.

And that's not to mention the look of the show.  Every set and costume uses bright colors and vivid light.  The show was made for HD, and I can't wait to watch it on my new HD-TV.  Plus the make up on the dead bodies is outstanding.  If they don't win some Emmys for make up, something is seriously wrong.

And I must admit, I love the show's humor.  The lines come fast and furious with plenty of banter, especially between Ned and Chuck.  Jim Dale is also in the cast as the omniscient narrator, and he adds his own touch to the show.

Yes, this show is quirky and odd.  But please don't let that stop you.  Get this set and give it a try.  You'll be hook on the quirky before you know what hit you.",1221523200,4,2431,4.342984409799555

  This show leaves you with the same feeling any Tim Burton film leaves you with. In no way is that me criticizing this show. Maybe you'd take it that way if you didn't like Tim Burton, but I do. Especially Edward Scissorhands. It's the kind of show that has a fairy tale feel with a splash of reality. Reality in it's syrupy sweetest form. I'd say pie, but I don't really like pie.

There's a little bit of everything: suspense, action, musical, mystery, drama, romance, etc.  At times you might be a little confused since some parts of the story are very fast paced, but now that it's on Bluray, all you need to do is rewind and watch again!

Beautiful art direction, quirky and inventive storytelling, and great acting performances all around make this one of my favorite shows in a few years. There really isn't anything else quite like it on TV right now.",1219104000,3,445,4.6455696202531644
3024025,5,B000YAA2SQ,"How's this for a concept? A man with an unusual gift brings his true love back to life, but can never touch her, else she pushes daisies once more. If you don't see the irony in this, then you might never get the show, because it's one of the most witty, brilliant, and certainly the most ironic on TV today. If nothing else, it gives a much needed weirdly original twist to cascade of murder-solving detective shows on today.

Ned has the gift of changing people's cold fortunes, bringing them back to life. Unfortunately, if they're alive for more than 60 seconds, then someone else must take their place in the underworld. Since Ned doesn't want to inadvertently take another's life, he has to touch them again before the clock expires. This is both a blessing and a curse. It's a curse in that his childhood was hell because of it, and he can't touch his girlfriend now. The blessing is he can solve crimes by bringing back the disfigured murder victims to extract the information he needs to solve crimes, which adds income to his pie business, and makes his partner, Emerson Cod rather happy.

These facts must be known to get any of the series. But even if you still don't get it, you'll appreciate the characters at least. This show has more quirky character that are so brilliantly developed, you would think this show was on USA. But it's not just the character. Brilliantly designed by all involved, this almost-fanciful world takes cues from people like Tim Burton and other such out-there stylists. The world lives and breaths effortlessly, and amazes you with the irony and quirk of it all.

And even though this show is supposed has all the detective/murder-mystery elements that we know and watch endlessly, this show not only adds Ned's unique twist, but also much humor and wit in it's murder stories. Case in point, when Ned brings back the dead for his 60 seconds, they come back with all the scars that killed them. Whether this is a half-rolled face, knives or glass shards sticking out or whatever, it may seem gory, but once you get over the shock factor of the first time, these scenes play for all comedic value, causing you to laugh, no matter how wrong it may be.

The cases have also so far turned up must quirk, whether it's the killer who uses real test-crash dummies, or the guy who says his wife killed him, but he has 3 wives, they all take quirky and ironic twists that keep with the show's feel. Never do the cases feel over-done, in fact, they might feel a bit underdone. Because the murder isn't the focus here, it's just a side-story. The show is all about the characters, and there story plays out centerstage, instead of the other way around.

And how could I go on without also giving props to the narrator, Jim Dale. Yes, I'd say it's pretty unique for a TV series to have a narrator, and no he does not bore you, but rather, he enchants you with this forensic fairy tale, giving you all the details without it sounding like an explanation.

So overall, certainly a show I'll keep watching well into this season to see how things all pie-pan out. It restores faith in the originality of shows on ABC and network TV. Certainly ABC's best show, and certainly must-see TV, Pushing Daisies is the quirkiest and most ironic show on TV today. Can you say Emmy's?",1219104000,4,3299,4.554806070826307

3024030,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I completely agree with the raves this show has gotten, but none of the reviews mentioned directly the element of the show I like most - it progresses. I've abandoned numerous hit tv shows after a season or two because once it was apparent the show WAS a hit, the original plotline is derailed, delayed, often dismissed completely. The Lost cast can't get off the island until the ratings drop, Earl's list suddenly falls by the wayside for wacky adventures, even Mulder and Scully don't give a damn about the aliens anymore, it goes on and on. It's an infuriating betrayal on the part of the storytellers, one I lost my taste for years ago. Imagine the outcry if JK Rowlings had, in the Deathly Hallows, had Voldemort announce a 4-year scheme that would last Harry and Co thru college!

Not so PD. The show is episodic, but within it's framework are some ongoing threads, potential time-bombs laid out in the original plot and subsequent episodes, easily recognizable to the experienced tv viewer; these are either exploded or defused, in their own time rather than being artificially delayed for sweeps, the season finale, the series finale, or maybe the heat death of the Universe. All those moments when, watching other shows, you find yourself thinking  - maybe even saying aloud - ""Just SAY it already!"" are followed by the characters doing just that! It's incredible - it's like the writers are actually confident in their ability to come up with new stories and so don't feel the need to drag out one or two plotlines until advertising revenues wane.

There's a great feeling of satisfaction to watching (and re-watching) Pushing Daisies as life's doors open and close for the characters, leading them to NEW doors rather than everyone going back and forth through the same doors over and over (yep, Ross and Rachel, I'm talking to YOU).

Pushing Daisies is so tightly plotted it could end at a moment's notice with no loose ends. You don't HAVE to watch it to see how things will end - you WANT to watch it to see what happens next. I'd almost forgotten what that's like.",1216771200,8,2080,4.7217630853994494

I saw the pilot and fell in love with the show.
Quirky characters, great script, awesome acting.
And the visuals?
Just like the creators wanted, a story book brought to life.
I can't wait till season two comes along.
Hopefully Burton fans will start to really pick up on this show.
It would suck so bad if this show ended up going off the air, like Arrested Development just because people aren't willing to give it a shot.
Comon people, just because it's different...AND IT IS!!! Doesn't mean it's not any good.
Give it a shot. I'm not sure exactly where it fell in the overall tv rankings but as far as I'm concerned, anything less than a top ten finish is inexcusable.

3024056,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Now that the format wars are over and Blu Ray has won out over HD TV, I have taken the high def plunge.  And the first thing that I have purchased in Blu Ray is PUSHING DAISIES.  It won't be out until September, but for symbolic reasons I made this my first purchase in the format.  The series is so visually stunning that it is perfect for high def presentation.

Season One of PUSHING DAISIES ended prematurely. Sadly, the show, which was supposed to run through 22 episodes, has ended at 9. Many shows have been adversely affected by the WGA strike, but except for FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS (which not only is going to be cancelled, but did not even get to wrap up its final season, so that it will end with the narrative dangling, an unfitting end to one of the most brilliant shows on TV) none as much for my money as PUSHING DAISIES. This is simply one of the most original, extraordinary shows in the history of television. I awaited the arrival of each of the nine episodes comprising Season One like many await the release of highly anticipated films. That we got only the fraction of a season is heartbreaking.

In case anyone questions whether the season is indeed over, creator and producer Bryan Fuller has stated bluntly that the show will not resume production until next summer, when they will start work on Season Two. And to make it all even more definite, this past week it was announced that Anna Friel, who plays Chuck on the show, will very shortly start filming LAND OF THE LOST with Will Ferrell. You can't shoot new episodes if your female lead is unavailable.

What makes this so heartbreaking is how incredibly fresh and original this show was from the very first episode. I was enthralled from the very first seconds. As the camera moves up from underneath the earth, through the roots of the plants and grass just under the surface, and then up to reveal a vividly yellow field of flowers through which young Ned is running, I was completely entranced. Everything about the show affected me in similar fashion from the music, to the extraordinary use of color (the color is what causes many people to compare it to AMELIE), to the relentless number of wonderful sets. I've never seen a show that I have found so visually exciting.

And luckily the writing and the acting is every bit as good as the art design. It is almost impossible to over praise the writing on the show for two reasons. First, when you watch the first episode, it is so stunningly good that your immediate reaction is: they can't possibly keep this level of excellence up. Yet, they do. In fact, the show doesn't merely stay as good as the pilot (or ""Pie-lette,"" as it is titled), it gets better. The show doesn't merely have a brilliant premise, but has a plan. Although we've had only 9 episodes, any viewer will definitely get the sense that this show is going someplace very specific. Second, the show features some of the wittiest dialogue ever found on television. Many compare the dialogue to that on THE GILMORE GIRLS, both for its immense cleverness and wonderful wordplay, but for its sheer quantity. Without doubt those two shows probably have more words per minute than any shows ever previously seen. (Interestingly, some of PUSHING DAISIES is filmed on the part of the back lot upon which THE GILMORE GIRLS was filmed.) Part of the reason for this is that any spots that on other shows would result in silence on PUSHING DAISIES provides an opportunity for the Narrator, who embellishes the story in marvelous fashion. Other shows have featured narrators, but in my opinion only ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT does so quite so well.

PUSHING DAISIES features a wonderful if somewhat compact ensemble cast. Lee Pace, whom many may know from an earlier Bryan Fuller series WONDERFALLS (on which he played the main character's brother), plays Ned aka The Pie Maker, who ""isn't like the other boys,"" in that whenever he touches a dead thing he brings it back to life, with two caveats. First, if he touches that dead thing (or person) a second time, they will be dead forever. Second, if he doesn't touch it or them again within 60 seconds, something else must die in its place. Anna Friel plays Ned's great childhood love Chuck aka Dead Girl, who is brought back to life by Ned after she was murdered. Of course, this means that Ned and Chuck can never touch directly, which is, as Olive Snook points out, tragic (""notwithstanding big ticket items like genocide and death""). The outrageously talented Kristin Chenoweth plays Olive. Although one of the great Broadway musical talents of her time, neither TV nor the movies have found a way to take advantage of her. Until now. At first I was perplexed why they would cast such a huge talent in what was clearly the second female lead, but as the series goes along Olive quickly became one of my favorite characters. And Kristin even sang a song, performing ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" in one of the season's highlights. Ned's partner in solving crime, the delightfully named Emerson Cod, is played by Chi McBride. Emerson is hands down the funniest, most delightful character on the show and perhaps a majority of the funniest lines on the show are uttered by McBride. Chuck's aunts are played by two more Broadway stars, Swoosie Kurtz and Ellen Greene. The Narrator is performed by Jim Dale, who is perhaps best known as the reader of the Harry Potter books on CD. For me he is one of the most wonderful things about the show, providing precisely the right texture and background to every scene. But one other performer has to be mentioned, or rather a pair of performers. I can't tell them apart and I don't know the name of the second ""actor,"" but Orbit and another Golden Retriever play Ned's dog Digby. Orbit played JD (short for Just Dog) on an earlier Bryan Fuller series, DEAD LIKE ME. I have no idea how they get the reactions on film that ""Digby"" makes to things that happen around him, but to watch him you'd swear he really is acting. My favorite Digby scene might be his interaction with Olive during her singing of ""Hopelessly Devoted.""

As much as I love this show I have to add that I've been amazed and perplexed that not everyone I know who has seen it has liked it. Some don't like the Narrator. Some don't like the fast-paced dialogue. I simply can't account for this. PUSHING DAISIES does have a very definite style. I suppose that if the style rubs you the wrong way, you might not like it. But for me and several of my closest friends, this is one of the most magical shows I've ever seen. My two all time favorite shows are BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. How much do I love PUSHING DAISIES? Although there have been only 9 episodes, right now I am inclined to say that I love it as much as those two, making it one of my three all time favorite shows. Which is just another reason why I have been so upset by its truncated debut season. But with the writers strike finally about to end (as I write this it has been indicated that the union will vote two days from now on the new contract), I am eagerly looking forward to Season Two. What accidentally turned out to be the final episode of Season One did end on a bit of a cliffhanger and works fairly well as a transition to Season Two. Be sure to watch this to get ready for it.",1214611200,36,7318,4.550493545937737
3024057,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Obviously, since this title is not yet released, I can only comment on the series itself. There's really only one thing to say about it: it's brilliant!
If you enjoyed the deadpan humour of Dead Like Me as well as its more serious and heart warming sides, liked the quirkyness of shows such as Wonderfalls, then I'm certain you'll enjoy Pushing Daisies.

Lee Pace is wonderful as the good hearted pie maker, Anna Friel couldn't be more adorable as the - unfortunately dead, but revived - love of his life. Chi McBride is no Mandy Patinkin, but he delivers in his part. Then there's Kristin Chenoweth as Olive Snook. She works for the pie maker and is (not so secretly) in love with him. She is probably the most entertaining character on the show and you just can't help but adore her.

I just hope that Amazon is right this time and the release actually is for all Blu-ray regions, otherwise, I probably won't be able to enjoy this wonderful show on Blu-ray due it being rather unlikely to be released in Europe. Btw, dear people at Amazon, when are you going to learn that Blu-ray uses different region codes than DVD? There is no region 1 for Blu-ray, it must be region A instead.
And while I'm at it, dear studios and publishers, get rid of the darned region codes altogether. They'll eventually be overcome also for Blu-ray and they're just annoying the hell out of those people that actually buy what you have to sell (especially annoying if there's no chance for a release of a title in the region you happen to live in).",1212364800,22,1528,4.512635379061372
3024058,5,B000YAA2SQ,"PUSHING DAISIES was probably the best new show of the strike-shortened season of 2007-2008.  It was something very unique, much like DEAD LIKE ME and TWIN PEAKS.  There was a cheerfulness to it that is missing from televison these days.

Performances: Lee Pace is charming as the main character, Ned.  Anna Friel, an actress fom England, plays Charlotte ""Chuck"" Charles with elegance.  The best performances, however, come from Chi McBride and Kristin Chenoweth as Emerson Cod and Olive Snook.  These are the characters that keep me coming back for more.  They are in my Dream Emmy Ballot for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.

Plot: Every episode we are given a mystery that is to be solved by Ned, Emerson, Chuck, and sometimes Olive.  The mysteries are predictable, but they're fun to watch.  There we're severel songoing storylines throughout the season, including the realtionship between Chuck and Ned, Chuck's two aunts not knowing about her being alive, and Olive's unrequited love with Ned.

Score: The score for this show is extravagant.  It's beautiful and moving, the kind of music you hear in fairy tale movies.  It sets the movie very nicely.

First, if he touches that dead thing (or person) a second time, they will be dead forever.  Second, if he doesn't touch it or them again within 60 seconds, something else must die in its place.  Anna Friel plays Ned's great childhood love Chuck aka Dead Girl, who is brought back to life by Ned after she was murdered.  Of course, this means that Ned and Chuck can never touch directly, which is, as Olive Snook points out, tragic (""notwithstanding big ticket items like genocide and death"").  The outrageously talented Kristin Chenoweth plays Olive.  Although one of the great Broadway musical talents of her time, neither TV nor the movies have found a way to take advantage of her.  Until now.  At first I was perplexed why they would cast such a huge talent in what was clearly the second female lead, but as the series goes along Olive quickly became one of my favorite characters.  And Kristin even sang a song, performing ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" in one of the season's highlights.  Ned's partner in solving crime, the delightfully named Emerson Cod, is played by Chi McBride.  Emerson is hands down the funniest, most delightful character on the show and perhaps a majority of the funniest lines on the show are uttered by McBride.  Chuck's aunts are played by two more Broadway stars, Swoosie Kurtz and Ellen Greene.  The Narrator is performed by Jim Dale, who is perhaps best known as the reader of the Harry Potter books on CD.  For me he is one of the most wonderful things about the show, providing precisely the right texture and background to every scene.  But one other performer has to be mentioned, or rather a pair of performers.  I can't tell them apart and I don't know the name of the second ""actor,"" but Orbit and another Golden Retriever play Ned's dog Digby.  Orbit played JD (short for Just Dog) on an earlier Bryan Fuller series, DEAD LIKE ME.  I have no idea how they get the reactions on film that ""Digby"" makes to things that happen around him, but to watch him you'd swear he really is acting.  My favorite Digby scene might be his interaction with Olive during her singing of ""Hopelessly Devoted.""

As much as I love this show I have to add that I've been amazed and perplexed that not everyone I know who has seen it has liked it.  Some don't like the Narrator.  Some don't like the fast-paced dialogue.  I simply can't account for this.  PUSHING DAISIES does have a very definite style.  I suppose that if the style rubs you the wrong way, you might not like it.  But for me and several of my closest friends, this is one of the most magical shows I've ever seen.  My two all time favorite shows are BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  How much do I love PUSHING DAISIES?  Although there have been only 9 episodes, right now I am inclined to say that I love it as much as those two, making it one of my three all time favorite shows.  Which is just another reason why I have been so upset by its truncated debut season.  But with the writers strike finally about to end (as I write this it has been indicated that the union will vote two days from now on the new contract), I am eagerly looking forward to Season Two.  What accidentally turned out to be the final episode of Season One did end on a bit of a cliffhanger and works fairly well as a transition to Season Two.  Be sure to watch this to get ready for it.",1202342400,90,7002,4.566158781074579

At first, the whole scenario--a man can bring back the dead for one minute, and always has had this power, which has caused him grief in odd ways all his life, and has happened to bring back both his dog and his girlfriend, neither he can touch again--made the eyebrows rise with a ""huh""?  Then you watch, and cannot stop watching. People judge this show compared to all the explosions, deep plots, and sex in other shows, but sometimes you need something that is as fresh as a daisy.

3255645,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Through 9 episodes so far, Pushing Daisies has become an ever more and more complicated romantic fairy tale between a pie maker and his childhood crush.  Now grown up and brought back from the dead (at the expense of a crooked mortition) by the pie maker, Charlotte (Chuck) and the pie maker have fallen in love in the most delicious series of the 2007-08 season.  The only problem is that if they ever touch, she will die for good.

The support cast include a reward seeking, former detective, a pie shop assistant, the pie maker's dog (brought back to life at the expense of a squirrel), a deadpan, morgue worker (pun intended) and two aunts of Charlotte (Chuck) ,who use to be mermaid swimmers in a circus.

What if you could be raised from the dead for one minute and then put back to being dead?  What if you survived that one minute but someone else or some other living being had to die in your place?  Each week is a new mystery of who-dunnit, why and how in cases that are bizarre to the tenth power.

Pushing Daisies is colorful, witty, absurd, charming, romantic and yes grim as a push me, pull me reaper who happens to bake pies.  As all good tales the story adds with each episodes with more and more being revealed as far as the main characters relate to each other and the lives (sometimes deaths) that they have experienced.

Pushing Daisies is my current favorite tv show. I hope ABC's Wednesdays at 8pm will continue to be illuminated with its' uniqueness.",1198368000,29,1474,4.49063670411985

This is a delightful show that has a very Seuss-ian feel. Very comedic (""Bitch, I was in proximity!"" and ""Reality isn't like puppies, you don't pick your favorite"") and definitely sure to entertain even the most skeptic individuals.

Please cross your fingers for a swift resolution between WGA and the networks so we can get back to the saga of Ned, Chuck, Olive & Emerson Cod!",1197504000,11,650,4.692982456140351
3255647,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Alternately funny and whimsical, PUSHING DAISIES is a visually distinctive romantic comedy that encompasses a truly winning mix of ingredients. With its modern fairy tale settings and exploding color schemes - along with perfect but unobtrusive narration by Broadway veteran Jim Dale - comparisons to the work of Tim Burton are all but unavoidable. (In a good way.)

As in his previous outing (DEAD LIKE ME), series creator Bryan Fuller explores the great beyond but this time the results are much more impressive. The entire series centers around Ned (an utterly charming Lee Pace), who - at an early age - discovers that he possesses the power to bring the dead back to life with just a touch of his finger. The tradeoff? If he touches that person again, they will remain dead forever. And leaving the dead resurrected for longer than a minute causes someone else in the immediate vicinity to die. Cruel? Perhaps. But the universe demands a cosmic balance - and this is its solution.

Ned - the owner of a fairly successful pie shop known as `The Pie Hole' - uses his unique gift to earn a living in two ways: His astonishing pies, where his special touch invigorates the fruit with incredible flavor; and helping a detective (Chi McBride), who accidentally witnessed Ned's gift first-hand, solve murder cases. How? He revives the victims long enough to find out who killed them and then the two of them split the reward money. This can, and usually does, lead to near dangerous adventures for the two of them. Sounds exciting - but as Ned's co-worker Olive (the adorable Kristin Chenoweth of Broadway's WICKED) points out, it's a detached, emotionally frigid existence.

That is, until Charlotte enters his life again.

Charlotte or ""Chuck"" as she is called (played by Brit actress Anna Friel), is the girl Ned loved as a child before she moved away. When Ned and the detective discover the murdered Chuck on one of their cases, Ned brings her back to life for a sizable reward but can't bring himself to kill her, creating this dilemma: Although Ned and Chuck are strongly drawn to each other, they can never, EVER touch.

PUSHING DAISIES is loaded with stars from film, TV and the stage (Paul Ruebens, Raul Esparza, Molly Shannon, Swoosie Kurtz, Ellen Greene, Christopher Seiber, Barbara Barrie, Grant Shaud - to name but a few), and it's clear that everyone is having a marvelous time. The series is filled with tons of clever touches and Lee Pace, full of childlike vulnerability, is an immensely likable lead. His palpable longing for Anna Friel's Chuck is both sweet and touching. Seldom, however, has a series predicated on keeping two characters romantically apart established such a seemingly insurmountable barrier to insure that they remain that way.

As long as the creators can sustain the high level of entertainment that the first (as of this writing) nine episodes have provided, one can only pray that this highly original and gorgeous looking television experiment keeps going for years to come.",1197417600,183,3016,4.903921568627451

3255735,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I took a chance on this show because its soundtrack includes one of my favorite songs, Birdhouse in Your Soul, sung by Ellen Greene and the incomparable Kristin Chenoweth, and because of its outstanding ratings... so many people love it! Now having watched the first season, I TOTALLY understand why! The premise is so creative, and it's presented in a quirky, charming, engaging, and delightful way. It's a dark comedy, but there's also a distinct lightness to it which is so engaging.

When I first watched it, it honestly reminded me of My Name is Earl, another show I LOVED, even though the two are wildly different from each other in tone and content. I think it reminded me of Earl because it is so utterly unique and unlike (almost) anything I'd ever seen before, and because of its rapid-fire, witty dialogue, its saturated color/aesthetic, and its wonderful music- although Pushing Daisies' music is decidedly more orchestral than Earl's. It's also very much like Monk in that each episode focuses on figuring out how and why someone has died as only it's unique protagonist can do- in this case, Ned asks the deceased people themselves and, with the help of Chuck and Emerson, builds on the clues they provide. Perhaps best of all, it truly feels like watching a Dr. Seuss movie with its lush colors- especially orange and green, its narrator, and its candy coating of whimsy. What other show can be described as talking to the dead with a candy coating of whimsy? None. If this sounds wonderful or even just intriguing to you, I highly recommend watching!

It is unlike anything else I've ever seen before, although I hear it is similar to Amilie.  It is fun, and funny, sometimes silly, but never brainless or stupid.  It is delightfully playful with a slightly dark side.
What I didn't care for:  Anna Friel, sorry, but I don't think she was the best choice for this main character. She wasn't bad, just not as animated as the rest of the cast.  Some parts were a little darker than I like, but the whole ambience of the show is eye candy, so it doesn't come across as dark.  Most people wouldn't care about this.

The narrating takes just a little to get used to but adds to some of the humor....just an FYI if you order this set please know you may get a dvd with the cover that says The Pie Hole, I did and thought they sent the wrong item, so I sent back and Amazon sent a new one, the new one had a cover that said Pushing Daisies (like the picture) when I took the plastic DVD case out it said The Pie Hole oops that is the correct DVD....",1478390400,2,572,3.8559322033898304

3256564,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Where do I start with this underrated and wonderfully written show? It's clearly a show that was ahead of its time and the writing was superb, to say in the very least. Unfortunately it was aired at the wrong time and cancelled mainly due to the writers strike that occurred during the same time as the 2nd season came around. I'm guessing that the reason it didn't come back like other shows was probably, at least in my own opinion) that this show was too intelligent for the mainstream reality/cliche' situation comedy/competition/talk show/game show viewer's IQ. Seriously, how does the junk like Two and a Half Men stay on the air when this was so much better and extraordinary in its genre?
I could go on and on, but what's the point? The only thing that I have left to say is that if you are going to buy the box sets make sure you get them on Blu-Ray. The picture is phenomenal and well worth it even though they don't come with any extras.",1431302400,6,948,4.422857142857143

3256596,5,B000YAA2SQ,"An amazing ensemble cast, quirky premise, fantastic episodes, a great narrator, and vibrant visuals combined and made Pushing Daisies one of the best series ever to be produced. Lee Pace is charming and brings such humanity to Ned. Anna Friel's mischievous, flirty turn as Chuck pairs very nicely with reticent Ned. Kristin Chenowith and Chi McBride may be considered supporting characters but they bring just as much heart, mirth, and life to Olive and Emerson. Swoosie Kurtz and Ellen Greene are awesome as Aunts Lily and Vivian, and I'm so glad they got as much screen time as they did. And Digby! Such a cute dog.
For all that the show was about solving crimes (mostly murders), it never feels as bleak or as hopeless as other crime shows do. All of the characters are three-dimensional; none of them ever feel like caricatures or clichs. Even when they are the bad guys, you still identify with them a bit because they are shown as people and not just ""bad guys"".
It's such a shame the series didn't get renewed so we could stay a little longer in Coeur d'Coeurs; I really loved visiting.",1431043200,2,1093,4.668393782383419
3256597,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This is by far my favorite show that I have ever seen. The main storyline about the lives of Ned, Chuck, Olive, and Emerson is original and intelligent, and it balances the humorous and the sympathetic very well. The characters are loveable, funny, and adorably imperfect, and they are brilliantly acted by some superb actors. The chemistry (romantic or otherwise) between Ned and the other main characters is spot on to me. Additionally, the episodic storylines of various death investigations are ingenious and hilarious. The situations border on the absurd but in the best way possible as part of the over-the-top, fairy-tale presentation of the show. Visually, the show is interesting and often unexpected.

The show deserved every one of the seven Emmy Awards it got (in addition to the other awards), and the ratings and cancellation seem to be more a reflection of the American public's desire for unoriginal, clichd, unintelligent crime dramas and hospital dramas and celebrity dance-offs than a reflection on the brilliance of Pushing Daisies.",1431043200,10,1052,5.224852071005917

A show fully centered on death, and yet it also has the most livliest feel to it. All the colors are bright to the point of ludicris, but that just adds to the shows comic appeal. This is probably Lee Pace's cutest role, as Ned the Piemaker. A girl named Chuck, and a disgruntled PI only add to the endearing elements of the show. The drama with Kristin Chenoweth's character is bit weird and boring, but the show makes up for it in bounds in other areas.

3256802,2,B000YAA2SQ,This has nothing to do with the show because I can't even watch it haha as I was sent the second season when I ordered the first.

3256803,5,B000YAA2SQ,What a fabulous discovery. Halt and Catch Fire introduced me to Lee Pace and led me here! I love this show...so clever and entertaining. Isn't that what TV should be? It deserved many more seasons. I hear a musical is in the works. I hope so.,1408924800,,242,4.282608695652174

I love all the characters in the series, there is no unpleasant.
My mother loves Pushing Daisies, we watching it together.
In fact, this series and big bang theory is the only series I have at home on dvd, most tv shows today are horrible..
It's very clean, romantic, funny and even a little corny.
It's series has a style to Tim Burton films.
I love it!",1405296000,2,461,4.5

It has a love story, comedy, humor, a mystery to solve, and the acting is superb, especially Kristin Chenoweth and Swoozie Kurtz.  Their characters carry a LOT of the show.  I was hoping to finish the series this coming fall and winter when we are not outside so much, but it is now paid programming.  But those that are able to afford the cost, it is well worth the money for a great family hour or two.",1403740800,2,548,4.281553398058253

3256842,5,B000YAA2SQ,I watched this show when it came out and loved it! So when i found the series on dvd i was doing back flips. Its a nice show theres no nudity or sex or very much violence (its a crime show so it has to have a little). Its really different and interesting. The packaging for this surpassed my greatest expectations. I love how the discs look like pies and the episode guy looks like the menu to the pie hole. I also love hoe they put the dollies behind the pies in the case it was a great touch. Wish they had but this much detail into the season 2 one. You might be going only 12 episodes thats not a lot its not worth the money. But it is the episodes are actually pretty long. the first time i watched it since it was on tv and i kept wondering when the first episode would end. I love this show! I love the packaging! And i love the price! would recommend it to anyone.,1403481600,2,872,3.960227272727273

3256883,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This series must have gotten lost in the pack because it's so original, clever, smart and fun.  It only lasted 2 seasons but should be brought back and tried in another time.

3256900,5,B000YAA2SQ,I am so grateful to be able to re-watch this series. Even though it's been off the air for quite some time I still shake my head and wonder why ABC was so quick to cancel it. It is quirky and charming and very well acted. Though it was billed as a forensic procedural it is far more than that. Every episode is fun to watch because the characters are so fully formed. The dialog is somewhat fast paced but not so much so that you get left behind. I will watch the episodes over and over again and should Amazon ever remove it I will find a way to buy the complete series...a blissful 2 seasons.,1401667200,,594,4.085470085470085

I just want to learn how to make something close to as lovely. Honestly, I suggest everything that has Bryan Fuller as the creator!

3256902,5,B000YAA2SQ,"It's so quirky and fun. I know the subject matter isn't everyone's cup of tea, but for the sheer visuals...it's worth it.

3256905,4,B000YAA2SQ,"I never saw this show when it was on broadcast TV but I have to admit that it is proving to be very entertaining.  There is a cartoonlike quality to the visual aspects of the show.  The colors are all supersaturated, buildings and sets are greatly exaggerated, particularly in the distortion of wide angle shots.  The brilliant and superbly performed narration by Jim Dale is consistent and entertaining and the balance between dry almost minimalist performances by the two leads opposing the often over-the-top ones by Chi McBride, Kristin Chenoweth, Ellen Greene and Swoosie Kurtz work really well against the visuals.

I don't know how long the central concept of a couple in love who cannot touch, can be carried off without over-stretching the tension but most of the way through the first season I am finding it keeps my interest very well.",1401408000,,846,4.895104895104895

3256917,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Pushing Daisies is a whimsical journey about one man's ability to wake the dead. It is a delightful mix of the fantasy and crime genre. Narrated by Jim Dale who you may remember as the reader of the Harry Potter audio books lend his magnificent voice as the narrator in each episode.

3256919,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This series was unfortunately short lived.  It is fun, lighthearted, and stunningly beautiful.  The series maintains a consistent aesthetic that gives the world of Pushing Daisies the feeling of a semi-modern fairytale.  It is such a lovely series.

3256938,5,B000YAA2SQ,"As I mentioned with ""Wonderfalls,""  it is too bad when an incredibly cool show with such potential is cancelled because tv execs (short-sighted businessmen) are so out of touch with creativity. The visual brillance is worth the price of admission.",1400544000,,247,5.175
3256939,5,B000YAA2SQ,I love this series. It's got a whimsical sort of feeling to it and the style and morbid humor remind me very much of a Series of Unfortunate Events. I love the concept and the way its handled and Lee Pace is adorable as the Pie Maker.,1400544000,,234,4.0

3256941,5,B000YAA2SQ,Pushing Daisies is amazing from beginning to end.  The colors are are enchanting.  All the characters are extremely original and entertaining.  The narration is top art storytelling and the dialogue is cleverly cute and witty. Listen closely and use your thinker to keep up with the fast paced conversations and guess the mystery in each episode. I recommend this show for the whole family.  It's great for expanding ones vocabulary way beyond other TV shows and it's much cleaner for children to watch.  I think it even teaches adults how to expand and exercise the imagination once again.,1400544000,,590,4.979591836734694

No gratuitous sex or language, there is lots of innuendo and the overiding theme of death & violence, presented as humorous, could be objectionable to some.",1400198400,,322,5.551020408163265
3256958,4,B000YAA2SQ,Very original.  Loved this series. Great acting and original scripts.  Nothing else like it out there.  Cancelled before its time.,1400112000,,130,5.4
3256959,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Just a really good show with comedy, drama, and romance.  Each episode is about 45 minutes long with a good recap at the beginning of each show so you don't necessarily have to start with the first episode and watch in order.  Great cast!",1400025600,,238,4.386363636363637
3256960,4,B000YAA2SQ,"I'd heard a lot about this show so I decided to give it a try. It's very cute and fun, the acting is good and the plot is fresh and interesting. It's definitely one of the most visually interesting shows I've seen in recent years and many of the shots are just gorgeous (even if they're obviously CGI).",1400025600,,302,4.224137931034483
3256961,5,B000YAA2SQ,Really sorry to see it drop off the air.  Especially liked Kristen in her character.  She is an all-around phenom.,1400025600,,114,4.65

3256963,5,B000YAA2SQ,What can I say about season 1 of Pushing Daisies other then its brilliant tv writing and of course the network can it before it could really grow. Season one is full of great stories and characters that have chemistry.,1400025600,,218,4.475
3256964,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I have been watching ""Pushing Daisies"" since it came out years ago. It is well-constructed and wittily written with beautifully crafted characters who create so much intrigue of their own. The use of color, costume and set-design, not to mention the narration by Jim Dale round out the viewer's experience to be one of story-book romance, laced with delightfully dark humor.
It was cancelled far too soon!

Anyone who enjoys the likes of Dr. Who, British costume dramas, Tim Burton, or the Hitchhiker's guide---and simply anyone in the mood to be delighted---will be charmed by this perfectly crafted series.",1399939200,,608,5.141414141414141

3256967,5,B000YAA2SQ,I am so sick of reality TV.  I can't believe that this show only lasted 2 seasons.  I love the story line.  The chemistry between all the characters are great.  This show is so sweet and cute and interesting that even the kids can watch.,1399939200,,237,4.2
3256968,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Just watch it. I seriously just finished the whole season in two days, and I loved it so much! It was seriously one of the best shows I've watched this month. Cute, funny, with some plot twists. I can't wait to watch season 2...",1399939200,,228,4.204545454545454
3256969,4,B000YAA2SQ,My wife and I enjoyed the quirkiness of the show and found it very funny.  Pushing Daisies has it's own style that is very artistic and inventive.  We however can understand that mass audiences would not appreciate the show and thus it only lasted two seasons.,1399852800,,260,4.630434782608695
3256970,5,B000YAA2SQ,I love this show! It's a classic humor with a slightly morbid twist. The characters are quirky and the style of the show is so unique. Got to love it!,1399852800,,150,4.033333333333333

3256975,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I love this show. It's like nothing else. It's modern, but nostalgic. It's certainly aimed at an adult audience, but not trashy. Though its romance will certainly be very pleasing to a female audience, this male is touched by its elevation of love as a constant theme.",1399680000,,268,4.723404255319149

3256990,5,B000YAA2SQ,This show is as wonderful as I remembered.  Too bad there aren't more episodes.  It has the rare quality of being quirky and visually appealing at the same time. Reminds me a great deal Wes Anderson's movies.,1399334400,,208,4.594594594594595

3257010,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Cute and clever. Nice change from today's ""reality tv"" dramas and shows. It's scifi it's crime and it's a romance",1398556800,,113,4.7
3257011,4,B000YAA2SQ,Funny! Surprisingly clean & enjoyable... Reminded me slightly of mirror mirror or lemony snikets as far as the way it was filmed,1398470400,,128,4.863636363636363
3257012,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Pushing Daisies is charming, engaging and so wonderfully different, if anything else it's worth at least one view...and then you'll be hooked. I had heard about it and always meant to watch but procrastination never pays off as it was taken off the air. Lee Pace is so very endearing as the lead, a tender pie maker with a touching way of bringing people back from the dead. Absolutely wonderful supporting cast. The writing of this series - fantastic. So much time must have been put into selecting the Dr. Sues-like words but it all flows so effortlessly.",1398470400,,557,4.6938775510204085
3257013,5,B000YAA2SQ,Sweet. Visually lovely. Oddly realistic for being based on such an odd premise and having such a burtonesque backdrop. Characters are very 'true to life'.,1398470400,,154,5.2
3257014,5,B000YAA2SQ,This show is amazing I just might have to kill myself because I can't stand not knowing what will happen. How evil to cancel a great show and not let them wrap it up. It's just like my so called life all over again! 9th grade was hard enough I didn't need to be abandoned by a TV show! So I suggest you don't watch it cause you''ll just get abandonment issues.,1398470400,,360,4.013888888888889

3257017,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Cute whimsical show. Reminds me of a Dr Seuss book because of all the colors and cutsie rhymes and characters. A bit corny at times,  but who doesn't love some corny?",1398384000,,166,4.354838709677419

3257028,5,B000YAA2SQ,I loved it. I enjoy murder mysteries and comedies.  The characters were all wonderful especially the pie maker and the aunts.  Too bad it was cancelled but at least they ended it before it could be ruined.,1397692800,,205,4.513513513513513
3257029,5,B000YAA2SQ,"It's very sad that there are so few episodes of this series. The ensemble cast is wonderful, and the romantic and dramatic tension are all very well balanced. The fact that this series is supposed to be a crime drama is hardly even relevant!

But 'Pushing Up Daisies' was a happy discovery on Amazon Prime. The story itself is novel and the characters are charming. I'm not even going to attempt to describe the plot (no spoiler alert needed) because discovering it is part of the fun. I'll only say that if you liked 'Wonderfalls' you will enjoy 'Pushing Up Daisies.'

3257060,4,B000YAA2SQ,"Clever concept with very imaginative setting and camera work.  It evokes some of the better work by Tim Burton; or possibly 'an unfortunate series of events'.  It borders on fantasy while staying engaged with the 'real' world.  The characters are all engaging and well suited for their roles but it's the settings and the almost otherworldly feel that sets this one apart.  The narrator deserves acknowledgment too; his droll, deadpan delivery works perfectly.",1396051200,,460,5.260273972602739

It is worth checking out and is a lite comedy with Jim Dale doing the narration.  If you don't remember him he did the reading of Harry Potter and also starred in Pete's Dragon.  Great cast, great storyline, and just an escape from the troubles of the day.",1395964800,,363,4.217391304347826
3257065,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Love this show! It's funny, sweet, and very cleverly written.

There is an old Greek myth about two star-crossed lovers who are forbidden to make physical contact, and this story reminds me of that, but without all the angst. Very enjoyable.",1395705600,,245,4.590909090909091

Ned, can only revive the dead for a minute before another living thing takes its place. using the ability to talk to the dead to find their killers, is a fresh twist on the usual detective shows. Funny and gruesome. Just the way it should be.",1395705600,,331,4.1875

However, if you like a clean show with not your run-of-the-mill humor, this might be the one for you. (And what is not to like about watching Lee Pace for 40 minutes?) How about four and one half stars?",1395273600,,332,3.970149253731343

3257102,5,B000YAA2SQ,This show is the best kind of campy. There is a lot of wordplay and the show often edges towards silly.,1394582400,,103,3.9523809523809526
3257103,5,B000YAA2SQ,This show was unique and very clever.  It only lasted a couple of seasons.  I think it must have been difficult to maintain the level of writing but it was a very enjoyable show.,1394582400,,178,4.205882352941177
3257104,4,B000YAA2SQ,I'd heard a lot about this show but only watched it recently.  I can say it definitely lived up to the hype.  A very fast paced and clever comedy.  It's a unique storyline with great narration provided by none other than Jim Dale.,1394496000,,230,4.3023255813953485
3257105,5,B000YAA2SQ,Loved Season 1.  Season 2 had different results.  They are night and day different.  The 2008 writing was atrocious and the writers strike killed it.,1394409600,,149,4.88

and she came back to life. And you were reunited.

I looked forward to seeing this every week. The writers strike
destroyed this show. Relive it on disk.",1394409600,,385,4.436619718309859

3257108,5,B000YAA2SQ,"The story is unique. Casting was excellent. Sets were excellent, filming was perfect.

3257109,5,B000YAA2SQ,This was a great series full of quirk and fun and it was great to see it again. It's a shame it got pulled because it was embroiled with the writer's strike and all. It probably would have prospered on cable.,1394323200,,208,4.097560975609756

3257114,4,B000YAA2SQ,Pushing daisies is a very interesting series. It's not like your average tv show.

Now I'm totally hooked,1394064000,,275,5.0
3257115,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Bravo to the writers and especially to the set designers/costumers for this creative and witty series. How they managed to make a storyline riddled with death so delightfully pleasant is beyond me. I almost feel guilty for how much I enjoy it and walk away from every episode with, dare I say, 'cozy' feeling. It's a pleasure to watch.",1394064000,,335,4.694915254237288
3257116,5,B000YAA2SQ,Excellent wry comedy with a bit of the supernatural thrown in. To bad there were only a few seasons to watch.,1393977600,,109,4.238095238095238

3257122,3,B000YAA2SQ,"I like the weirdly nostalgic sets and wacky plot lines, but sometimes this show tries too hard to be cute. I'd give it 4 stars if it was a little darker. I'm also not a fan of the outrageous cleavage on the female cast members, but Lee Pace is super dreamy, so I can deal with it.",1393804800,,280,3.9298245614035086
3257123,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Love this off beat odd little show.  First, the cinematograhy in this series is outstanding. From over the top sets  and costumes that would make Audrey Hepburn envious to odd angles that give a different perspective, everything about this show seems reinvented. Second, the tongue in cheek approach to the dialog keeps me on my toes listening for the next quip. The detective part of the story line is a bit simplistic in most of the episodes. But the other excellent elements make up for that.

I am going back to watch the entire series again just to pick up on the double entendres, puns and alliterations. The dialog is a delight. I love the character of Olive Snook played by Kristin Chenoweth. What an outstanding comedic actor. She alone is worth tuning in to see and hear.",1393804800,,781,4.644927536231884

3257126,5,B000YAA2SQ,"It's witty, fun, and the piemaker is nice to look at. It all starts with the death of a childhood sweetheart who the lonely piemaker does not want to see dead again. Everything after that is sleuthing of the most interesting (and well paid) cases that Emerson Cod gets employed for.

This show is terrific  I've watched it numerous times and finally purchased because I always want to have access to the pie maker, Digby, Emerson Cod, Chuck, the Darli g Mermaid Darlings and the effervescent itty bitty!! The show is clever, incentive and makes zombies (yep chick is basically a zombie) romantic.  She's ever so lucky to not have died in some hideous way, allowing the make up people the whimsy to construct fantastical death masks, half a face, large trample good prints, glass shards sticking out everywhere...it's such fun in an odd way.

Yes, it's a comedy, this much is obvious, but then it takes a 180 to somebody dying, then making fun of them, then someone else dying very soon. It's told in a whimsical style that just doesn't seem to fit the plot to me.",1393286400,,397,3.8536585365853657

3257155,5,B000YAA2SQ,I love this show. Maybe you have to like a certain kind of aesthetic but this show takes risks and as a result is FANTASTIC! The choices throughout are cohesive and successfully create a beautiful quirky universe that doesn't fit into any genre box I can think of. The use of the narrator I think is well done and just creates this feeling of a fairy tale that some of the odd yet cloyingly sweet situations just seem to lend themselves to. I'm a big fan of Wes Anderson and I think this show captures the same kind of feeling; Highly stylized and unconventional. You only need to watch the first episode to know if you'll love it.,1393200000,,631,4.3559322033898304

3257168,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Loved this series and was very upset when it was cancelled. The creator, Bryan Fuller, is a mad, creative genius (Wondetfalls!), and I think he simply flurished in this crazy, quirky world of Ned The Pie Maker, played by Lee Pace.

We meet Ned when he's 9 years old and he discovers he's got a unique gift. If he touches anything dead, he can bring it back to life. BUT, if he touches it again, it's dead for good. And he also learns that in order to give something life, something else has to die. He later learns that he has a time limit of 60 seconds before something/someone dies for the thing/one that he ressurects. Crazy, huh?

But it's not just the situation of our principal character, it's the world in which he lives and works in. He brings back his childhood sweetheart Chuck, who was murdered, but she can't tell her beloved aunts she's not dead because they buried her. And the maddening consequence of their newfound relationship is they can't touch, or else she dies for good.

Our other characters, Emerson Cod, the PI that finds out about Ned's ability and uses it to awaken murdered people to find out who killed them and collect the rewards. Hey, they split the money! Olive Snook, the waittress of Ned's restaurant, The Pie Hole, who was once a top jockey and left after a bad race managed to kill a fellow competitor.

Like I said, a crazy world...but I think you'll love it!",1392336000,4,1397,4.488188976377953

The writing is superb, occasionally dark, offbeat and funny.
Chi McBride often steals the show with his deadpan delivery of cleaver and hilariously funny lines which cleverly point out the many foibles of the supporting cast. I'm positive they could have spun him off in his own comedy Detective series. If Hollywood could team him up with and make a movie with Cedric the Entertainer we'd all be laughing so hard we'd be Pushing up Daisies.

The premise is simple: Ned, a pie maker is able to revive the dead by touching them, a second touch from him and they're dead forever.  If the revived person is around for more than a minute, then a random individual will die instead.  Sounds silly, but thanks to a combination of a great cast, amazing writers, and great direction, it works fantastically.  Ned supplements his meager income running a pie shop by reviving murder victims so that a private detective can solve the case and split the reward money with Ned.  All goes well until one of the victims is Ned's childhood sweetheart.  Give it two episodes, and if you don't love it, move on to something else.  Oh, and make sure you've got plenty of pie on hand.  You'll be craving it after a couple of episodes.",1391126400,,828,4.585034013605442
3257236,5,B000YAA2SQ,"First off, thanks to Amazon Prime for including this in your streaming service. Without you, I wouldn't know the joy of the series.

Pushing Daisies is about a boy/man named Ned who discovers his power to bring dead things back to life by touching them when his canine companion runs into traffic and is hit by a semi. As the poor boy is hunched over his dog trying to come to terms with its death, he touches it and the dog walks off like nothing happened. Ned continues to explore his new powers when his mother suddenly drops dead as a result of a blood clot. He touches her and she immediately comes back to life. Unbeknownst to Ned or his mother, there are a couple catches (as always!). First, if the revived person lives for more than a minute, something else must go. Think of the alchemy principal, an equal exchange must be made. Second, he can only touch the revived person once. If he touches them a second time, they are dead and cannot be revived again.

As you probably guessed, this sets up a devastating tragedy where Ned revives his childhood sweetheart and decides to keep her alive. Trouble is, now he cannot touch her as much as he desperately wants to because doing so would end things between them forever.

The sets are visually amazing, something out of a dark Tim Burton movie. The constant theme of death is toyed with so much that almost all of the emotion associated with it is lost, which is difficult to do in most cases. In ""Pushing Daisies"" it is simply another part of the plot line, bringing people back to life to discover who killed them. Think of CSI with more quirks and less science.

Now he's brought back his soulmate, and although they are deeply in love, they cannot ever touch each other or she will be gone forever.  Possibly the most creative premise for a show I've ever seen.  We were devastated when this series was canceled partway through the second season.  Our whole family loved it.  I would give it a PG rating, just because of the fact that there are a lot of corpses on this show, and the topic of death is, for obvious reasons, prevalent.",1386115200,,748,4.416058394160584
3257349,3,B000YAA2SQ,Great series on those rainy days or cold nights too bad only two seasons.  If you like Monk or Drop Dead Diva you might like this too.,1385510400,,134,3.962962962962963
3257350,5,B000YAA2SQ,"A fun show, and different.  Had never heard of it before this.  It may not be for everybody, but we liked it",1385510400,,108,3.8636363636363638
3257351,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I loved the series. It is corny, so if you are in the mood for a serious drama, this isn't it. This is a great show if you want to sit back, relax, and not have to think.

For parents out there considering watching it with kids, I would say content wise it is appropriate for all ages, however the younger ones won't understand, but if you are looking for something to watch with your 12-13 year old, this would be acceptable. So far (I am halfway through the first season) there has been no adult content (maybe a few references here or there, but not enough to warrant any parental concerns) and I think only two instances of profanity.

This is a show that I would definitely recommend to someone, my only regret - that it is only two seasons. Apparently the writers strike a while back resulted in this show going off air.

I watched this through Amazon Prime.",1385337600,,864,4.354037267080745
3257352,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This is such a cute show. I am so sad I missed it when it played on TV, and even sadder it was cancelled so soon. It is funny and quirky and all the actors are great. Some of the digitalization looks very cheap but I feel like that's kind of the point? Anyway, good, fun show.",1385251200,,276,3.8596491228070176

3257362,5,B000YAA2SQ,"A nice series that in a light hearted way deals with the subject of death. Death is a mystery that we will all deal with and this puts a light hearted slant on how it could work, not really. But it is very entertaining.",1383609600,,219,4.0
3257363,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This was such a wonderfully quirky show. I only recently sat down and watched both seasons, lamenting that it only lasted that long. It's a tragedy that it got canceled.",1383436800,,169,4.666666666666667
3257364,5,B000YAA2SQ,"When Pushing Daisies came on I was attending college and simply didn't have time to watch the show. So here was opportunity for me to see the show that several of my friends had said was delightful. I've seen Lee Pace in several other things and rather like him. I like the idea of the story, with the Piemaker bringing people back to life, but only for a minute. The supporting characters were strong. I also felt the show had a strong visual look. It really wasn't until the end of the season that I was frustrated by the thought that the Piemaker and Chuck can never touch. That was very sad.",1383436800,,595,4.321428571428571

3257368,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I don't think I have really seen a show with such a unique narrative and style.  The story is great, the presentation (color, set, and lighting) is great, and the Tim Burton like narrative is great, making for an entertaining show! You just don't see TV shows that are set apart from the rest, in form and delivery, that are also able to pull it off successfully.",1382400000,,363,4.417910447761194
3257369,5,B000YAA2SQ,I LOVE this show and it's been fun re-visiting it on Amazon. Such an inventive and well executed show all around. I wish it didn't get cancelled 4 years ago.,1382054400,,157,4.266666666666667
3257370,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This show is in my top two of all time. Its clever and funny and endearing and the cast and guest stars are spectacular.
Season One was brilliant and can be rewatched repeatedly. I frequently find things I missed the first time. I love the singing episodes as Kristen Chenowith has an amazing voice. The whole colorful look of the show is unique and beautiful. If you like quirky characters, an interesting storyline, and fast paced intelligent dialogue, this is a must see.",1381881600,,474,4.72289156626506
3257371,4,B000YAA2SQ,"It's full of offbeat wry humor on a theme that is much more satisfying than 'Six Feet Under' which I did watch and enjoyed.
If you don't like the feel of Alice in Wonderland parodies, you probably won't like this.
Watch the first episode then any other one on Prime, before you buy it.",1381881600,,285,4.296296296296297
3257372,4,B000YAA2SQ,"This show is one of my all time favorites. So cute and quirky! The audio seems a bit tinny in some episodes, I've noticed. As well as out of sync in some parts, but it's hardly noticible.

I docked it a star because the case arrived a bit broken. The tabs in the inside of the cover (that hold in the DVD info papers) were both broken off and the DVD hinges are cracking.",1381795200,,371,4.013513513513513

3257378,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I saw one of my friends watching this in my dorm a few years back and decided to buy it on a whim.  It's a great show with an interesting premise.  Solving murders is easier when you can ask the dead who killed them.  Beyond that, it has interesting characters and a romance that is both tragic and amusing simultaneously.

The show didn't last long, but I'd highly recommend it.",1381190400,,379,4.371428571428571
3257379,5,B000YAA2SQ,"As a film student studying to write for television, I'm a bit of an aficionado for serialized, stylized storytelling, and Bryan Fuller's Pushing Daisies delivers a top shelf experience on both fronts. The vividly colored set and costume design is complemented by a strong narrative and cleverly written characters who both typify their archetypes and turn them on their ear all at the same time. Fuller's unique obsession with interpreting death in unusual ways lends a sense of wonder and fun to what could easily be a macabre show, and instead imbues it with delight, romance, love, adventure and plenty of humor.

Watch Pushing Daisies. You won't regret it.",1381104000,,660,5.055045871559633

3257384,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Quite possibly the most original show ever on television. It's so hard to describe beyond saying it's laugh-out-loud funny, romantic, sweet, quirky, clever, and utterly charming. The show also had a unique look--lots of bright colors and sets that look simultaneously retro and futuristic--that gave it a fairy-tale quality I've never seen duplicated. The entire cast is phenomenal and I really can't single out any one actor-----but if I could it might be Chi McBride, who is far funnier than he usually gets the chance to be. His comedic timing is absolutely flawless. But truly, everyone is fantastic. Cannot recommend this show enough, but you have to like offbeat and not be put off by the premise.",1380844800,,703,5.017094017094017

The writing is wonderful, the narration in the show is clever and witty, the actors were cast perfectly, and the way it was filmed was refreshing.

couple, the story lines were fun and the narrator made each episode more fun with his quirky style.  The aunts were an interesting duo and their side story became pretty good as well.  I loved all the ways Chuck and Ned found to touch without actually touching.

Blue ray more than worth it, in view of the stunning colors used, and the great set pieces and costumes.

3257432,5,B000YAA2SQ,Great show! Absolutely love it! Definitely one of the best story lines I've seen in a show in a long time!,1377561600,,106,4.095238095238095
3257433,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Just a great show. A little quirky, but entirely original. I wish there had been a third season and a better resolution.",1377216000,,120,4.5
3257434,5,B000YAA2SQ,Really hate the series got cancelled. I still enjoy watching it on amazon.  Good clean fun to be had by all,1377216000,,107,4.095238095238095

3257446,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This is a fantastic show that compares with some of the best cancelled classics. It's cheesy but in a very entertaining way. It kind of plays out a bit like Psych mixed with Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel, mixed with a third old-timey crime drama (sounds boring, but trust me--I'm from the internet). I would definitely recommend this along with some of my other favorites from similar genres: (if you like any of these you will likely *like* the others) Dead Like Me (show), Reaper (show), Lo (movie), and my favorite of all time, Wristcutters: A Love Story (movie). Enjoy my awful review that does not spoil a moment of this amazing show for lovers of quirky television case-by-case episodic adventures.",1377129600,,708,4.811475409836065
3257447,5,B000YAA2SQ,Lee Pace is adorable here as is the rest of the cast. This show is very fresh and new compared to other shows.,1377043200,,110,3.8260869565217392
3257448,5,B000YAA2SQ,"How can a show be funny, morbid, and sweet all at the same time, and still be extremely good? I have no idea, but Bryan Fuller does it EVERY TIME he makes a show. Pushing Daisies probably best showcases this bizarre mix of things. I miss this show so much!",1377043200,,256,4.14
3257449,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I love Pushing Dasies! It's such a fresh show that hasn't really been thought of before and it's nice to see something so creative done. However, I'm still bummed that they cancelled it!",1376956800,,186,4.666666666666667

3257451,5,B000YAA2SQ,"It's been years since this show was off the air, but I really wish they would live up to the promise of a movie. Pushing Daisies is morbidly sweet - there's no other way to describe. While only 2 seasons, it's definitely worth watching.",1376784000,,236,4.386363636363637

3257453,4,B000YAA2SQ,"I started watching this series when it first came out on TV and was intrigued by how a show with such a dark premise could have rich vibrant color. I fell in love with the 4 lead characters and their quirks. After watching an episode, I always want pie.",1376611200,,253,4.183673469387755
3257454,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Alas that this show was canceled after the second season. But whatever you do, do NOT let the fact that it was canceled deter you from watching it altogether. This show is quirky, dark, colorful, imaginative, witty, heartfelt (without being the least little bit sappy), extremely humorous, and all around brilliant. It is visually stunning, with bright colors and geometric shapes, fantastic settings, and beautiful vintage outfits. The characters are instantly likable, and that only increases throughout the two seasons. I doubt there has ever been a more unusual romance on television. There is NOTHING like this show. Watch and appreciate this short-lived but unique show.",1376611200,,676,5.386792452830188
3257455,5,B000YAA2SQ,Such beautiful editing and imagery!  I loved the first season and the story of Ned and Chuck.  The love triangle is sweet also.  Definitely a chick TV show.,1376524800,,156,4.5
3257466,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This show has clever dialogue, a winsome plot, appealing aesthetics and soundtrack.  I would highly recommend it - I've rewatched it a couple times.  I have never met anyone who saw a couple episodes of the show and did not like it.  It seems that folks I know have either really enjoyed it or never seen/heard of it.

The only bummer about the show itself is that it was cancelled after Season 2, however it does wrap up somewhat at the end.  The video and audio quality is good.  The dialogue is fast paced, so it's a shame there are no subtitles.",1376524800,,549,4.333333333333333

3257468,5,B000YAA2SQ,"The first episode was a little weird to me but I quickly got used to the style of the show and fell in love with it. It is so cute and really good. I would definitely recommend. I'm so sad that by the time I found out about it it's already been cancelled for a couple years. Lee Pace is also a great actor, love him.",1376092800,,316,3.803030303030303
3257469,5,B000YAA2SQ,"The most romantic, beautiful show, with a who done it feel and witty, sharp, dialogue. A tragic victim of the writers strike, the show could have gone somewhere.",1376092800,,161,4.785714285714286
3257470,5,B000YAA2SQ,Same as my previous review for Season 2.  Great discovery of a show in its afterlife. Chenoweth as Itty Bitty...love her,1376092800,,120,4.714285714285714
3257471,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Every now and then Television gets together and makes a show that demonstrates what Television could be, but it only does it every decade or so and the show usually gets cancelled early. But then Television sits back and says to itself, ""Those fools, now at least they can see what they are missing when they accept reality TV and stupid crime dramas as if it were really entertainment.""

And some of us see it and mourn, knowing that every time one shows up it will be cancelled way too soon and we will have to wait a decade or so before another shows up.

""Pushing Daisies"" is such a show. It's been five years, I can't wait for the next one of these kinds of shows.",1376006400,,669,4.25984251968504
3257472,5,B000YAA2SQ,Love this series! Wish it was more then 2 seasons! Cast is fantastic and the whole premise is so unique.,1376006400,,104,4.25
3257473,5,B000YAA2SQ,Fantastic show! I cannot believe it only lasted 2 seasons. The world is so surreal and the actors and actresses are some if the best I've seen in a tv show.,1376006400,,156,4.064516129032258
3257474,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This was a good series that didn't last nearly long enough. I can't think of another series with such an inventive premise, certainly not now with the glut of shows involving zombies and vampires. All involve the undead (or alive again), of course, but not nearly as originally as Pushing Daisies. It occasionally goes a little overboard with the romantic sentimentality, but it's usually balanced out with a healthy dose of biting wit and childhood trauma. If I had one complaint, it would be that they never really gave the Olive character much to do besides moon over Ned. (That critique is also in light of the second season, which beat that storyline even further.) Olive was probably my favorite of the bunch; I just think she wasn't served well with that particular storyline going on so long. It didn't help that the series came to an end just as she was moving on. But that certainly didn't ruin the show for me. And Kristin Chenoweth is hilarious no matter what.",1376006400,,972,4.690058479532164

3257491,5,B000YAA2SQ,This show is as wonderful as I remembered it from watching it when it was originally broadcast. Inventive dialog and visuals that manage to take a maudlin concept (the ability to resurrect people just long enough to find out how they died) and make it madcap and delightful. One of my all time favorites.,1375574400,,304,4.648148148148148
3257492,5,B000YAA2SQ,Every last character was brilliant.  Will watch it over and over again in the future.  Very few shows pull me in like this one did,1375574400,,130,4.16

3257516,5,B000YAA2SQ,I'm sad there was only 2 seasons of this show. I love that it was a mystery with an underlying story line of how Ned and Chuck love each other but can't express it physically. It is lighthearted and fun and just a joy to watch. They don't make shows like this anymore.,1374710400,,268,4.0754716981132075

The writing is not amateurish and it is not written at a 5th grade level.  Very bright, witty, and full of extra meanings--you need an education to watch this and realize its full value.  It is also a treat to find a program that is not focused on bathroom humor, which becomes really old really fast.",1374364800,,428,4.578947368421052

3257558,5,B000YAA2SQ,"...should be criminally prosecuted. With its delightful blend of fantasy and reality, its whimsical tone and its alternating shades of light and dark humor, ""Pushing Daisies"" is that rare television show that can satisfy even the most discerning of palates. Not for nothing, but it's also brilliantly written and acted as well. The worst I can say about the show is that occasionally it leans too far toward the absurd -- but that is offset by the considerable comedic talent of the cast.

If you're a Prime Member, you have nothing to lose by checking out the show. But even if you're not, the show is well worth your money.",1373328000,,625,4.681818181818182

The second season was a victim of the TV writer's strike and did not make it into a third. Get it to see the delectable Anna Friel in a standout role and to see the amazing Kristin Chenoweth in a dynamite supporting role. the writing is top-notch and the dialog crackles. The set decoration and the general palette of primary colors is eye-catching. I particularly liked the varied and most ingenious ways the show used to kill off each episode's victim.",1372982400,,551,4.575757575757576

Its always interesting to see how chuck & ned figure out ways to overcome their non-touching relationship. I love that too as it truly adds a 40s romance feel to the show. The adventures of Ned, Emerson, Chuck & Olive always tie into the relationships which again serve the primary plot without being contrived. The acting is very high quality as well as the production.
I cant forget chucks mermaid aunts. They add a nice space outside of the pie hole adding yet another dimension into the characters youth and prior connection to each other overlapping with Neds 'talent. Highly recommend.",1372464000,,738,4.818897637795276

3257579,5,B000YAA2SQ,Clever. Great technique of story narration. Well worth watching several times. So sad to see the series cancelled. Great adition to the Prime library.,1371686400,,150,5.291666666666667

3257595,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This show, which I once heard described as ""a formaldehyde fairy tale,"" is one of my absolute favorites. It is both clever and playful, both touching and whimsical. It takes joy in language, expression, and relationships while toying with the conceptions of life and death. Never without a moment to warm your heart, I can (and have) watch each episode many times over. Pushing Daisies, like it's main character, was tragically short-lived, but luckily that didn't spell the necessary ""end"" for either one.",1371686400,,506,5.108433734939759

3257602,4,B000YAA2SQ,"This quirky and visually delicious show was better than most offerings on TV today and I miss it!  While the subject matter itself is death and finding a ""use"" for it, it does not rely on graphic violence or carnality to keep the watcher entertained.  It is cerebral and sensual by way of actual artistry and talent in all its components.  I wish there were more shows today that actually required a thought process to ""get.""  If you feel the same, you'll love Pushing Daisies.  I only wish it were closed captioned, otherwise it would have received 5 stars from me.",1370995200,,566,4.564356435643564

3257604,4,B000YAA2SQ,Thoroughly enjoyed the entire series when it originally aired.  Rewatching it has been a little slow and not quite as good as I remember (few shows are) but I'm able to still smile as it goes so that's worth something.,1370908800,,218,4.45

3257641,3,B000YAA2SQ,A lot of senseless but entertaining conversation which I tired of easily. It is a study in the direction our society is headed. A society in which relationships are superficial and transient. I lost interest after two episodes.,1369699200,,227,5.0

I watch the show with her and because she does not like any type of scary shows,  this show makes her feel like she is watching something scary. It's not a bad show but it is kinda hard to understand what it is really trying to get at, just watch a couple shows and see what you think",1369440000,,351,3.875

3257656,5,B000YAA2SQ,I wish this show had never been canceled they could have done so many more things with it.  I am so happy I purchsed both seasons and will continue to enjoy them for years to come.  Who wouldn't smile when thinking someone would love another person so much they would go through life without touching them just to have them near?,1369440000,,329,4.377049180327869
3257657,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I give this show five stars (first season). Overall, it is a excellently made show, above average in every regard (except the CGI; which suffered from a low budget). A witty, charming and entertaining storyline, combined with excellent actors, amazing visuals, wonderful sound and impressive sets truly state that this show was a labor of love for several people.

The overarching plot of death and resurrection would normally be something grim and difficult to tackle, however, due to the great writing, exceptional narration and unique style of the show, it proves to be funny, lighthearted yet still pull on heartstrings.

If you are looking for something to fall in love with, I recommend watching this show.",1369008000,,712,5.129310344827586

3257660,5,B000YAA2SQ,I love this series.  It is sad that it was cancelled.  I recommend it to all my friends.  The characters and plot are hilarious.  Kristen Chenowith sings a couple times throughout the season and it makes for very memorable moments.,1368662400,,231,4.7

3257676,4,B000YAA2SQ,Definitely entertaining and at times frustrating because the characters are so absurdly nice you wish everything could go there way. Watch it to understand.,1368316800,,156,5.541666666666667

3257683,5,B000YAA2SQ,I laughed. I sighed. I could not put it down. Great writing. Great acting. And the sets are very colorful and interesting. I think it's such a shame there weren't more than two seasons. The story could have gone anywhere it wanted with all the plot lines it had going for it.,1367625600,,275,4.3076923076923075
3257684,5,B000YAA2SQ,An original and quirky series.  The use of colors in set design and costumes makes this show unique.  Too bad the writers strike cut this season short.,1367625600,,151,4.555555555555555
3257695,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Pushing Daisies charmingly pushes the envelope beyond the usual serial TV fodder.  This show is rooted in a unique Vision--from navigating the dark threshold between life and death with a humorous and whimsical twist to the bold yet cozy settings imbued with vivid crayon box colors. If you're a fan of Wes Anderson's films, it's a good bet you will like this show.  The lead characters are positively irresistible, and the casting is nothing short of perfect. Well worth watching...",1367539200,,483,5.025

3257697,5,B000YAA2SQ,"The series is great- sweet without being cloying, and remarkably funny. I watched this on Blu-ray and found that the audio levels are a bit patchy, with some dialogue sections sounding unnatural, and with the opening music and some effects much louder than they should be- but the visuals are incredible, and I think that if you have a hifi system that lets you fiddle with the audio settings in detail the audio issues could be sorted a bit better than our system.",1367193600,,465,4.614457831325301

It was too strange a concept to grasp from a commercial, but I really regret not giving it a shot. Lee Pace and Anna Friel are sorely missed.

You'll have to watch it to find out!), all mixed with three or four parts of pure quirky charm. I'd give it eighteen stars if I could!",1365897600,,447,4.321428571428571

The show's whimsical characters and plotlines keep the episode's moving along. The over-arching story line is fun to follow and keeps me guessing. I love the actors in their roles. I also really like the sets-the bright colors and ""perfectness"" of the world the is as much a character of the show as the actors. It's the perfect back drop.
I like that this show is different from a normal romantic-comedy. It has much more to offer on many levels. What really caught me was that despite the wackiness of the show, the actors fit into their characters so well that the stories carry believability with them. It's natural and perfectly normal within the world of this show.",1365638400,,733,4.603053435114504
3257741,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This fabulous, funny, unique series only aired two seasons, so having it on DVD is a must.  It is about Ned (the piemaker),  his childhood sweetheart, Chuck, and their unusual relationship.  You see, Ned has a gift of being able to bring back someone from the dead by touching them once; but touch them twice, and they're dead forever.  And, yes, he has touched his girlfriend once already, so the sad, sweet longing is always between them.  This is an essential for true romantics, those who appreciate quirky humor, and anyone needing a break from the sad excuse of television today. There's nothing else out there like it.",1365552000,,625,4.75

What a combination.  It is not what you think it is.  There is a surprise around every corner for the viewer and the characters alike. The show takes what could be a morbid subject and turns it into an adventurous, heartwarming and funny combination of events.  The synopsis called this show visually stunning and it is.  There are bright, almost fairytale colors in scenery and dress.  It is a little surreal but done well.  I can't wait to finish watching the rest of the seasons.

I suppose I can understand how it would not translate to the masses, but I'm going to assume that the timing just wasn't right and television audiences just weren't ready for a story like this.
The whimsical feel and look of the show really helps transport you to a somewhat familiar but absolutely Wonderland-like place filled with pies and bees and mysteries needing to be solved.
It's a terrifically fun adventure and feels very Wes Anderson inspired.

I won't detail the plot line as there are probably a million reviews that go into detail on that subject, but what I will say is that this is an utterly magical show and is a true, fun escape and a total breath of fresh air.

3257831,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I cannot recommend this show highly enough. The concept for this show is so fresh and surprising and the set design and costumes are incredible. They've created a wonderful, otherworldly world that is almost real, but not quite really real -- more emotionally real -- all on purpose.

If you know Wes Anderson's work, it has a bit of that same feeling to it, where Anderson always sets his movies in slightly skewed versions of ours. I think this show is most similar looks-wise and feelings-wise to Anderson's delightful movie Moonrise Kingdom.

The main characters are fantastic and extremely well-acted. Even the supporting cast of characters are each so unique and quirky.

I freakin' love this show. It breaks my heart that it only ran for two seasons (even though it won a bucket-load of Emmys!). It just didn't get the advertising eyeballs the networked, so that was it.

If you like this show, you might want to check out another show created by Pushing Daisies' showrunner Bryan Fuller -- Wonderfalls. It's different, but also creative in a similar wonderful way.",1361404800,,1072,4.906077348066298

My wife and I had a great time watching this show together.  Very sad it's over.  I think the only complaint I have about the show is that she and I sat in terror all the time because we were so worried that Ned and Chuck would touch and we'd cringe every time they came close.  So that kind of ruined some tender moments in the show since we were afraid that the plastic wrap they used to kiss through or the gloves they put on to hold hands would get holes or something.. I'd have loved to find a way in which Chuck was immune to Ned's touch and then we could have enjoyed the show without that mental torment..

It reminded me a bit of an adult version of the Series of Unfortunate Events (due to the narration, the almost cartoon-like setting, and the ever-progressing series of unfortunate events).

It is definitely not an overly sexual show which is refreshing to me. You can expect that every episode is packed with suspense, mystery, humor, and a lot of goodness. I can honestly say that there is not a single character in this show that I do not like. The characters are very multifaceted and innately good yet real human beings that you just can't help but feel for.

The directing is by far one of the best I've seen. The attention to detail and the ""every turn a surprise"" nature of the show just keeps me interested and eager for the next bit.

This show is great!
I remember hearing the title back when it was playing, but for some reason I never watched it.
I cannot remember what kind of show I thought it was, but whatever I thought it was I never even attempted to watch it.
Now I wish more than anything that I had watched it!

This show is beautiful, and I love every character in it.
In fact, I just finished watching the first episode for the first time and I am still laughing and crying.
There's a river of laughing going on inside of me right now.

I really loved the red head.
She was in the movie Land Of The Lost.
There is something special about her that I like.

The blond was great too, and I remember her in another movie about RVs.
She plays dumb, but she aint no dummy.
LOL

I love the aunts too.
One eyed Betty was funny too.

I hate the fact that this show was cut short.
But thank God we have the two seasons available to watch!

3257911,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I watch a lot of TV shows, but none have quite struck me like Pushing Daises has. The story is about a pie-maker who has the fantastical ability to touch people and bring them back to life. However, there is a catch. He can only bring them back for one minute, and if they are alive for any longer, someone else must die to even the score between life and death. Emerson Cod, a money-loving large black man who brings an air of reality and much humor to show, is a private detective who teams up with the pie-maker to solve murders. Because the pie-maker can bring people back to life momentarily, he can ask them for clues on their murder. The murder victims are not gruesome and are shown in very clever, almost animated, fashions. Their deaths are never depressing, as the plot unfolds somewhat like a play, you keep a distance from their lives and a closeness with the lives of the main characters instead. Now, the murder-mystery-solving scenes comprise only a portion of the plot, as there is also the added twist that once the pie-maker touches a dead thing to bring it back to life, he can never touch it again or it will die, forever. The complication in this occurs when he finds himself waking his childhood crush, ""Chuck,"" and fails to touch her again within one minute. They fall in love, but must avoid contact at all costs. Olive, the adorable and musically talented Kristin Chenoweth, is madly in love with the pie-maker, and knows nothing of his powers. If you can imagine, seeing a relationship like that between the pie-maker and Chuck causes much confusion from an outside perspective. The filming is wonderful and makes every scene ""pop."" There's never a dull moment. It is masterfully creative and very artistic. Its makers utilized each character to their fullest degree, they are multi-dimensional, themed, and each display their individual acting talents. There is much more to say and see, but don't take it from me! I absolutely LOVE this TV show and highly recommend that you at least give it a try!!

3257926,5,B000YAA2SQ,"It's been years since I first saw Pushing Daisies on prime-time TV. I still miss this unique program and still haven't gotten over it being cancelled.

I agree with most good reviews about how great Chi McBride was as Emerson and Kristin Chenoweth as Olive and Anna Friel as ""Chuck"" and the handsome Lee pace as Ned the pie maker.  But I just wanted to make sure that those not on the screen gets the well-deserved accolades and kudos for their contribution to this very special but short-lived series. Without the great casting, without the creative team of writers, and the crew that makes the costume and designs the sets, I don't think this show would have been as perfect as it turned out to be. That and also, the great narrator Jim Dale who also has the perfectly timed storytelling down to an art form.  All the planets must've been aligned just so for this light, sweet and oh-so-fun series to have come together just at that moment in time.

3257989,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I started watching Pushing Daisies when it aired in 2007 and I immediately fell in love with it. I originally watched it because of the character interactions but the wacky, whimsical story lines kept me tuning in each week. This show is so unique from its unusual premise, quirky characters, charming settings, and witty dialogue that it's no wonder the writers, producers, and directors could blend the macabre and magical together in harmony. It's like Tim Burton, Dr. Seuss, and Disney got together and had a love child. Some describe this as Tim Burton on LSD or Dr. Seuss on ecstasy and I can't find error in those comparisons; I just think it's a little more in depth than an acid trip but parts of this show can be pretty trippy.

  I have read other reviews where people say it's too light, too cute, and/or too colorful to be taken seriously. I agree that it's light, cute, and colorful but that contrasts greatly against the fact that this show is about a man who can wake the dead. All sorts of moral and ethical dilemmas and questions are shown and touched upon like is it okay for Ned (the main male character) to bring his childhood sweetheart (Charlotte ""Chuck"", the main female character) back to life when the person to die in her place is a thief (or any bad guy)? Is it ethical for Ned and Emerson (the PI that teams up with Ned) to bring people back to life to find out who murdered them for them to collect the reward money? Just because Ned can bring the dead back to life, does that mean he should? Many questions are asked and some are answered but most are left up to the audience to decide.
  If you're interested in the moral and ethical, you can find it. The topics are there and are dealt with in a respectable, albeit politically correct and more liberal, manner. You're not going to find any proselytizing or much mention of religion (it is touched upon that Chuck and her father are Jewish) or religious Afterlife: only Joan of Arcadia comes to mind when being spiritual but not religious. Pushing Daisies brushes against spirituality but it's mostly a crime/mystery show so even the brief mentions of spirituality can easily be overlooked.
  If you want drop the heavy philosophy and watch this show just for the scenery, characters, and dialogue, you can do that too. The dialogue, scenery, and characters can sweep you away to Coeur de Coeurs and you can just have fun with the friendly banter and loveable romance of the two main characters. Even in the light and airy side of this show there are serious questions like what would you do if you couldn't touch the person you love? If you had a second chance at life, like Chuck, but couldn't let anyone know you were alive, what would you do? How would you handle yourself?  There is plenty in this show to keep both the philosopher and romantic entertained.

  The characters of this show live up to the title of `character'. First, there's Ned, the main male character, who bakes pies and wakes the dead. He has severe emotional issues stemming back to when his father leaves him at a boarding school at the age of eight and intimacy issues that stems from his ability to wake dead things so he doesn't like touching others too much. Then there's his antithesis in Charlotte ""Chuck"" Charles, Ned's childhood sweetheart, first kiss, and true love. Where Ned is very quiet and reserved, Chuck is vibrant, friendly, and full of life. Chuck's father died when she was eight--as a direct result of Ned bringing his mother back from the dead. Chuck's father took the place of Ned's mother when she collapsed from an aneurism only to die for good while kissing him goodnight, leaving Chuck to be raised by her two shut-in aunts, Lily and Vivian. Olive is a waitress at the Pie Hole, Ned's pie `restaurant'. She is deeply in love with Ned but because of his intimacy and emotional issues, and later the appearance of Chuck, her love goes unrequited. Olive becomes ""friends"" with Chuck once Olive learns Chuck faked her own death (at least that's the story Olive believes; she doesn't know about Ned's ability to wake the dead) and befriends Chuck's aunts.  Emerson Cod is the tough, wisecracking PI that teams up with Ned after he discovers Ned's secret of waking the dead. Emerson becomes a mediator when Chuck and Ned or Chuck and Olive or Ned and Olive or anyone has any problems. Lily and Vivian, Chuck's aunts, start out as shut-in agoraphobics but later (due to Chuck's meddling in the form of homeopathic-spiked pies and Olive's encouragements) become more adventurous and eventually gain back their former lives. Each character has their own quirks, strengths, and weaknesses along with secrets they try to keep from each other. It's like one big, dysfunctional family.
  One character you never see is the narrator, voiced by Jim Dale. He makes watching Pushing Daises feel as if you're watching a book being read (think the Grandfather in The Princess Bride) but he is constant throughout the show. He describes the beginning (normally a flashback to when Ned and/or Chuck is around eight), the crime, and emotions while providing a running narrative of what's happening. I can see how some can find him annoying because he does talk about 1/3 of the time and he tends to narrate the obvious. I like him; it adds to the feeling that this is being read from a book.

  For a show including murder mysteries (knowing too much, revenge, adultery, greed, theft, etc) and dealing with death on a weekly basis, the show handles showing the bodies quite well. Going along with the Burton/Seuss/Disney theme, the bodies aren't horribly gruesome and some are even comical. I wouldn't recommend little ones watch this show but tweens (8-12) could watch this because of the lack of blood and guts. In my opinion, the ""worst"" bodies include:
-burned to death (think the smoker in Beetlejuice),
-dog bite (a part of the man's jaw is missing; kind of shocking but you don't see anything and it's handled carefully with humor),
-run over by a car (a woman is cut in half but blood isn't shown; her top half is at the front of the van and her legs are sticking out the back of the van--it looks like she was stretched more than anything)
-bee stings (welts are all over the woman's body; this was the worst for me but I'm phobic with bees),
-pipe through the head/chest (nothing is graphically shown but it is shocking and, like the dog bite, it's handled with humor),
-death by escalator (a woman is show cut in half; there is blood but it's a pretty quick shot--this is probably the worst)
-eaten by shark (the woman is still inside the shark when Ned brings her to life but there is no blood or guts).
Other bodies include being trampled to death by a horse, stab victim, death by falling into a vat of taffy, frozen to death, drowning, falling, entrapment by concrete, death by falling chandelier,  fried to death, and head twisted backwards. I think I covered them all. Despite the horrible ways to die, the bodies aren't that horrifying. My mom and aunt, who can't watch NCIS autopsy scenes because of the bodies, can watch this show.
  For those who want to monitor they hear, I would be iffy with this show. It depends on what you consider a cuss/swear word. One of Emerson's favorite quips is ""Oh, Hell no!"", `damn' is uttered pretty frequently, `bitch' is used (one episode is entitled Bitches) a few times, and `God' is thrown around several times. It's considered TV-PG so it's not going to be worse than an average PG movie to a light PG-13 (think 10 Things I Hate About You or Catch Me If You Can). If you're sensitive to swear words then I would advise to shy away from this show: if you're thinking of letting a tween watch this, they've probably already heard worse at school but I would advise watching this with them in case they have questions or comments about what is said.

  I can understand how people can not like this show; it deals with very dark and grim topics (death is the main topic) in a light, colorful atmosphere that some think disrespectful and not serious enough. Many people like to have their comedies be true comedies, dramas be true dramas, and sci-fi be true sci-fi. There's nothing wrong with not liking this show because it's not your cup of tea but if you haven't watched it, I highly recommend watching at least the first two or three episodes. Like some, you might not enjoy this series so I would recommend watching the first few episodes or at least a few clips on YouTube first. I love this series enough that I will watch it on a semi-regular basis so I invested the money for both seasons. If you only like one or two episodes, you can buy them separately on Amazon Prime or through iTunes.",1316995200,,8719,4.610967741935484
3257990,5,B000YAA2SQ,I still think about some of the sets and visuals. When I first heard the premise about dead things coming back to life I wasn't really into it. I watched it years after it ended and was really pleasantly surprised. Really this was a super cute show with a 1950's like feel.,1314057600,,273,4.269230769230769
3257991,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I'm mesmerized by the kind of romantic fairy tale movies like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enchanted/dp/B0011U52EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enchanted</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elf/dp/B0002F6BRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elf</a>"", and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stardust/dp/B001AQR3IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stardust</a>"".

Those movies hold a special place in my heart...they are just over the top enough to be funny and heartwarming, but not so over the top that they feel like kid's movies.

Pushing Daisies is this type of asexual romantic fairy tale, but an entire TV series instead.

It is beautiful to watch, with well-used (if not a bit obvious) CGI graphics and a very whimsical color pallet and cinematography style.

Many have compared the visual style to the works of Tim Burton (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edward-Scissorhands/dp/B00004U8P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edward Scissorhands</a>"" comes to mind).  It also reminds me a bit of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Dreams-May-Come/dp/B001AQR3MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Dreams May Come</a>"" as far as the visual style goes.

In spite of the seemingly morbid nature of the show's premise and the dark comedy of many of the plotlines, it manages to not take itself too seriously.  It is mostly funny and heartwarming.

This series has been on my ""todo"" list but I never got around to purchasing the DVD set.  Then recently I decided to sign up for an Amazon Prime trial membership and was surprised to learn that as a Prime member I can watch it streaming in HD for free.

I don't want to sound like a shill for Amazon or anything, but I was rather impressed by this instant streaming ""bonus"" because frankly it came as a happy surprise.

After watching this series I'd be willing to fork out the money to buy the DVD set, but now for about the same price as buying the two seasons I can just stream it anytime I want like with Amazon's instant streaming service.  I'm thinking about keeping Prime and ditching Netflix, in no small part to discovering and falling in love with this show.",1313884800,,2290,6.25796178343949

Review:

Too bad it was canceled! Olive Snook (played by Kristin Chenoweth) received an Emmy for her stellar performance. When she received the award she noted how it's odd to receive a reward for a show that was canceled. Pushing Daisies also received several other nominations and awards. The stories are cleverly written and the acting is on par. After awhile, the stories tended to drag on and seem mix to togetherl; all while your trying to keep up with the fast pace narration and dialogue. Mid way through many episodes I found myself getting lost through the dialogue, trying what to pick out what's important, and what was simply there for it's whimsical value.

For whatever reason, ABC decided to cancel the show while season 2 was still in production. I'm guessing mid/late year reviews were too poor for the show to continue. ABC did play the entirety of Season 2 on the regular show nights. All of the characters are likeable, even the ""villains"". All in all, a good watch!",1312329600,5,1532,4.642066420664206
3257993,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I adore these episodes... The cast of characters weave their own unique threads throughout each episode. The story lines seem to get better as they progress through the season.  When this show was on the air it was my weekly ""treat"".",1311984000,,233,4.682926829268292
3257994,5,B000YAA2SQ,"For the two weeks that I was watching this show from the first season to the second and last, I walked around in the greatest mood with a giant stupid smile on my face.  It is light, romantic, incredible sweet, witty, funny, intelligent.  It does not trivialize matters and it does deal with some pretty deep things, but it's a lesson in taking hard things in life lightly and still seeing the world with all its vivid colors and smiling about it.  Lovely show.  I wish there were even more of it.",1309737600,24,497,4.369565217391305

3257996,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This is such a great show. The visuals are stunning, the dialogue is fast-paced and smart, and the story is just fantastic enough to be delightful, but not so over-the-top as to be absurd.

Okay, I love the show. I love the colors, the score, the characters - everything. However, if I'm going to be honest, I do have one criticism. Here it is:

SPOILER ALERT

My one criticism was the character of Chuck. The writers didn't have to, but they basically made her into the Manic Pixie Dream Girl (look up the term on Wikipedia if you don't already know what it means.) Chuck's main purpose is to brighten Ned's dreary life - in fact, that's her ONLY purpose, because she's not even supposed to be alive! So, that's what the writers did. Instead of creating a three-dimensional female character, they inserted a trope. I suppose that was easier, and in a way, it fits the over-the-top style of the show. Kristen Chenoweth's character (Olive) is much more developed and unique than Chuck's, yet she is cast as a Supporting Actress - hell, her character was so well-rounded and so liked that she won an Emmy Award for it! So, that's my one criticism of Pushing Daisies. No television show is perfect, and it's still an excellent show that I would recommend to anyone.",1304812800,,1262,4.6
3257997,2,B000YAA2SQ,"I liked this show at first, and was fascinated by the subject matter.  It was clever, well written, well acted, and all around a captivating story.  I really liked the juxtaposition of the dark and light, the grim and the funny, the nightmare and the dream.  I waited eagerly every week to see what new twists and turns the story would take, and how long they could keep it going.

Unfortunately, about two thirds through the first season, the series started running out of steam.  The same jokes kept getting rehashed over and over, and the story began to take on the almost desperate tone of a TV series that had been on the air for too many seasons.  Except, in this case, it was only one season.  I found myself bored and disappointed before the end of season one, and thought it needed to be wrapped up gracefully as possible.

The plot had been brilliant, but did not provide enough soil to grow a whole crop of ""Daisies""!  I am honestly sorry that this idea was expressed in a long, laborious TV series, instead of a feature length film or made for TV movie.  The subject matter could have been adequately explored in a 2 hour time slot, and at least there would have been an end to the story that had a limited amount to say.  This could have been a quirky masterpiece, but it was compromised by an attempt to make it more than it really was.  I am not surprised it was cancelled after season two - they ran out of things to say LONG before the first season ended.  I didn't bother watching season 2 when if was first aired, but I am a member of Netflix, and when it showed up on instant streaming I gave the second season a chance.  I was so bored that I couldn't make it all the way through the first episode of season 2.  After the first few minutes, I remembered why I had lost interest before.

A lot of people liked this show and were loyal to the end.  Those people don't need a review to tell them whether or not to buy this series.  However, if you have not seen it, you might benefit from watching clips on YouTube before purchasing.  Or another idea for those who subscribe to NetFlix - both seasons are avaliable to members through DVD or instant streaming. ALSO:  MY PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS BOTH SEASONS FOR FREE - you should check with your library.  Why spend the money buying it unless you know for sure you will like it?  Just watch it at one of the free venues and see if you like it before you buy it.

Just my humble opinion, but after the initial rush of interest, I ran out of gas on this one.",1294099200,15,2518,4.254736842105263

3258019,1,B000YAA2SQ,I can see how people love the show but it was not my cup of tea. I loved the main character's acting and he was a delight to watch :) but the show never hooked me in and counting down to the second was fairly annoying. It is an acquired taste show so if you haven't seen it before I would rent the first disk or watch a clip on You Tube before you spend your money.,1292025600,20,365,3.7532467532467533
3258020,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Don't know why when they put all the effort and money into making a show they do the spend a fraction of time and money on marketing it.  This isn't the first show that's been pulled off air when no one really knew it was on air in the first place and unfortunately it probably won't be the last.  Like with Dead Like Me though, maybe when the DVD gathers a legion of fans we'll see a movie down the track.  Hopefully they do a better job than the movie version of Dead Like Me though.

Pushing Daisies is a light set in a surreal world comedy.  It ponders the question if you could bring the dead back to life, firstly would you?  Add in the if you do so and don't touch them again (which permanently leaves them dead) then an innocent nearby will immediately die.  So would you still do it?  For a pie maker named Ned this is his dilemma.  He's decided to use his gift/curse for good and teamed up with a private detective to make a bit of money on the side as well.  As long as he obeys the one minute only rule he can touch and bring back a murder victim, and ask them who killed them.  Easy money, usually, well it wouldn't be much of show if there wasn't twists and challenges to each murder. Throw in the fact that one day a victim is his childhood crush whose father died when Ned didn't understand the rules and you add a whole other element to this great show as Ned and Chuck (the woman) try to have a relationship when they can't touch each other, ever or she'll die. Set in a Dr Seuss looking version of the real world with giant props, bright colours and actors talking a bit unnaturally most of the time, I can understand why some people don't like it. A more realistic version might have worked too but so does this.

I also like how you see a lot of stars from TV shows which were made after this such as Glee, Community and others either as regular characters such as pie shop worker Olive or as the murder victims.  The, hey that's whoever from that show, is a nice bonus each time you watch a new episode of this fun show.",1288310400,,2042,4.139240506329114
3258021,5,B000YAA2SQ,"My wife and I happened upon the pilot show by accident and were thrown for a loop during the first opening segments.  Even though we both stared at each other over how quirky the show was, we both laughed knowing that we would fall in love with it despite ourselves.  Pushing Daisies ended up being one of the few shows we watched regularly on TV.

The writing is excellent on its own, but the actors really bring it all to life.  They perform well in conveying the emotionally complex issues addressed in each episode, and each brings enough to the show to make the characters stand out as individuals that compliment one another and the overall story.  The show's design, although slightly different, paints a great backdrop as well.

Overall, it's a great series that shouldn't have been canceled.  It unfortunately was first put out right at the beginning of the writer's strike and never had a chance to pick up steam.  I'd suggest this show to anyone.

With that said, the sense of humor can be a bit quirky, so it isn't for everyone.",1287446400,,1040,4.578378378378378

  It happens from time to time:  a television network cancels a truly original and artistic television series because it does not receive the ratings that the network believes it should be receiving for that time slot.  Quality of programming is no longer considered by these networks as valuable.  Whatever generates the most advertising revenue for the network appears to be the name of the game.  A casualty of this whore of a policy (and the untimely WGA strike during its pilot season) is ABC's mystery/fantasy noir Pushing Daisies, one of the most creative television series ever.  It is a shame and a sham that the series was not allowed to run its course.

  Sadly, television viewership has turned towards the glitz/glamour/faux reality/sickly sweet musicals.  Quick, witty shows are no longer found on television (Arrested Development, anyone?); every network seems to have a ""reality"" talent show, some type of police investigation show, a carousel of formulaic sitcoms and dramas.  It is so rare that a show of immense quality and entertainment value comes along.

  The whole concept of the show is brilliant: a pie maker can bring dead things back to life, but for only one minute or something else of equivalent life value will die after that minute; he must retouch the thing brought back to life to take it back to being dead; a private investigator discovers this power and exploits it to solve murders and claim the reward for solving the murders; it turns out his childhood love is murdered and he chooses not to take her back to being dead - all in the pilot episode (""Pie-lette"").  The rest of the series is devoted to the implications of the pie-maker, Ned's, power and his decision to let his childhood love, Chuck, keep on living.  It explores the notion of not being able to ever touch the one you love again.  There is a terrific cast of brilliantly acted characters.  Chi McBride and Kristin Chenoweth are flawless in their supporting roles.

The main character has the ability to wake the dead if he touch them, however there is a downside to this, if he touch them again they will die again and if he do not touch them again then something else nearby of the same sort will die, to deal with his unusual ability the main character run a pie store where he buy dead and rotten fruit, touch it and he have the freshest fruit in town, oh yeah and he also work with a PI to solve murders, touching the bodies and getting them to tell him who killed them. All is good and dandy until his childhood sweetheart get killed, he touch her, keep her awake and then fall in love with her, problem being if he ever touch her again she will die.

If the person stays alive past a minute, something else must die for them to continue living.  Ned is blackmailed into a partnership with a private detective who figures out his secret.

I've seen an episode or two of Friends, which I found tedious and glib, and Seinfeld, which never really grabbed me. I enjoyed the brief-lived Andy Richter series, but that is probably the last one I saw with regularity. I had never heard of Pushing Daisies before my daughter gave it to me as a gift, and I was not expecting much when I looked at the packaging. But I (and my wife) have been repeatedly surprised and pleased. Season 1 offers 9 episodes of clever writing and gorgeous photography, and mostly lovely acting. I am grateful we got the HDTV; the colors just explode out of the screen. And with the multiple cameras and extensive birds-eye shots it is, as someone else here says, like watching 40 minute feature films.

With 140+ sterling reviews already published, there's not much I need to add. I would say, though, that with the above mentioned Friends and Seinfeld, the acting was always acting. I could never lose sight of the fact that these were highly paid people mouthing (or mugging) lines written for them. In Pushing Daisies though, the acting is so smooth and so pleasant, that even though the plots are outlandish and the magic very magical, the skillful performances of nearly everyone make it a joy to watch.

Then I will sit down and watch them all together. I am looking forward to the behind-the-scenes pieces to see how the show was put together. Very few shows have ever been this inventive (Dead Like Me comes to mind which was also created by Bryan Fuller and dealt with death). I can only wonder if the writer's strike had never happened would we still have stories of Ned, Chuck, Olive, and Digby to watch?",1246924800,,554,4.4950495049504955
3258090,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Created by Bryan Fuller (""Wonderfalls"", ""Dead Like Me""), ""Pushing Daisies"" is a marvelous show filled with quirky humor, primary colors and a whimsical narrator who provides us with plenty of info on the characters in packing enough delight for a feature film into 22 minutes.

Ned (Lee Pace)can bring the dead back to life. He can only do it for a minute though because if it's longer someone else will die in their place. When his childhood sweetheart ""Chuck"" (Anna Friel)is killed, Ned breaks his own rule. He finds his partnership with a private detective (Chi MacBride)that he splits reward money with strained when Charlotte aka ""Chuck"" is kept alive. Of, did I mention the pies and Olive (Kristin Chenoweth)who works for him at the Pie Hole and is in love with Ned? No, of course not. So this is sort of a murder mystery/comedy and occasionally candy colored musical--among many other things.

The DVD transfer for the show looks terrific capturing the candy colored primary colors of the show perfectly.

Funny, charming, spectacularly original, well written and acted by a marvelous cast - it is gone too soon. It had such an original look to it that I had to have it on DVD. The only drawback is that this DVD only contains the first 8 episodes. The run was interrupted by the WGA strike and a handful of episodes were broadcast after it ended. There may even be a few more unaired - and it would have been better if ALL the episodes shot (even if unaired) had been put on a single DVD. Would have been worth the wait. Just in case, I decided I didn't want to miss a bird in the hand. The show is quirky and may not be for all tastes, but I can almost guarantee that if you watch the first - you'll be hooked. Kudos to all involved in this show and condolences on too short a run.

One of the rare TV shows that actually caught my attention and had me scheduling time to ""make sure"" I could catch it every week, in stunning High Def.
Naturally, it has been cancelled. (If I like it, it will be cancelled...)
This is my first BluRay disc purchase, and I will say it looks absolutely beautiful. (My PS3 now has a purpose).
The unique cast of characters and their individual talents are truly highlighted by this creative series, and keeps you waiting for the next installment to see the ever growing stories plot start to unfold.
Even though the series was cut down in the prime of its life by the idiots at ABC that simply would not air it when it was scheduled, and the writers strike that gave it the final blow, it's still worth watching.
Hopefull greed will force them to release season two and the unaired episodes that were filmed and then canned. If ever there was a series that took full advantage of the HD format - This is it. All the scenery is brilliantly colored, and shot in some very creative ways.
If you don't buy it, it's DEFINITELY a must rent from Netflix on BluRay.

This show was pure escapism candy-coated in the most gorgeous cinematography and set design ever to appear on a network show.  I was very sorry to hear that it would not be renewed and will never forgive abc for throwing the last three episodes into limbo.

If you're wondering if Amazon's customer service rep is warranted, I have to tell you it is.

3258149,5,B000YAA2SQ,"The basic plot of this series is about a boy, Ned, who discovers that he is able to bring people back from the dead by touching them; however, not without conditions and consequences.  He finds out that if he touches them again, they die and if he doesn't touch them again within a minute, another dies in their place.  Parts of the stories are narrated and take place when Ned is a man working in a pie shop.  He takes on a side gig with a detective where he brings the dead back to life (for less than a minute, with the exception of his childhood love, Chuck, whom he allows to live and who joins in on their adventures) to ask how they died so that they can collect the reward money.  While the murder mysteries are what may seem like a huge focus of the series (some dislike the series since the cases are not so difficult and not so gruesome), the real story is about the human interactions, internal conflicts, and personal development.  The stories are always really cute and leave the viewer feeling more light and happy.  Definitely worth watching.

The bluray package includes three discs (which reflect the cuteness of the series--they're colored like pies!) that comprise the first season's 9 episodes.

This is an amazing show, so of course the DVD is TERRIFIC! I just can't understand why ABC is pulling a show from its line-up that so many people love ... that ABC did NOTHING to promote ... that has quick witted plots & dialog (the writing is phenomenal!) ... an EXCELLANT cast ... amazing characters ... a beautiful colorful set ...unexpected story lines that are full of twists and turns and HUMANITY ... problem solving (in other unexpected way) ... IS NOT ANOTHER REALITY SHOW (if I wanted that I'd watch my family) ... the filming of the show itself is beautiful... the direction is wonderful ... the cast is just so cute in their parts ... the only negative thing I have to say about it is that ABC has cut the show, so there will only be one more DVD set (2nd season to follow). Unless by some miracle, some other station picks the show up, I pray daily for that to occur! I have to say that this is the only show on television that made me laugh after I lost my brother! It's about a guy that with one touch of his finger can bring the dead back to life, but only for one minute, if he doesn't touch the person again and put them back, then someone else near by will drop. He has issues with his 'gift'. The magic finger guy is Ned (Lee Pace), a very shy guy - he also owns a pie shop called 'The Pie Hole' where he and his staff of friends make culinary pie magic! He teams up with a detective, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride), who is a private eye murder investigator. The two of them bring the murder victims back, for 59 seconds, hopefully long enough to find out who killed them, then they solve the murder and collect the reward ... or that's how it's supposed to work, a sticky situation sometimes. Ned 'reanimated' his long lost love, Charlotte Charles *nick-name Chuck*(Anna Friel), but of course he can't touch her or she'll be toes-up again ... makes for some interesting love scenes. Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth)is a former jokey that works now at 'The Pie Hole', who is in love with Ned, becomes best friends with Chuck *Charlotte Charles*,and eventually (in season 2) becomes a kind of side kick helper to Emerson Cod ... all without knowing about Ned's magic finger! There's also Chuck's two 'aunts' that CAN'T know that she's 'alive' (Swoosie Kurtz & Ellen Greene) who are hysterical! I know it sounds strange, and it kind of is, I can't do it justice, but it is a remarkable show & has a slew of guest stars! Just pick any episode and just watch it ... you'll be hooked and want to watch them all ... then you'll be praying some other station picks up the show that is ABC's loss. Personally, I'm selling my Disney/ABC stock, & I don't care what I get for it ... they didn't listen to the fans, so this fan is leaving! 'Pushing Daisies' is wonderfully fun and visually exciting, give it a try! I always feel a bit lighter and happier at the end, it's just a fun show that during these economically and internationally hard times takes you away from it all!",1231977600,3,3347,4.841186736474695

Anyhow, I'm buying season 1 in hopes that they will see people buying it and keep the show on the air (maybe?)....and because it's awesome, of course.",1229558400,2,1068,4.680851063829787
3258237,5,B000YAA2SQ,"The word most commonly used to refer to this show is ""quirky"".  :)

Ok, so there's this kid who finds out he can bring dead things to life by touching them. But if he leaves them alive something else dies... and if he touches them again they die too, forever. He finds this out when his mom dies, and he touches her to bring her back, and his best friend's dad dies in return, then his mom gives him a kiss and she dies too...

Sounds totally grim and awful, no? But it's one of the most fantastic shows I've ever, ever seen. It's witty and funny and light and beautiful, full of clever writing and sweet characters but kept from becoming too saccharine by the unrelenting theme of death. Death and love and pie.

The show invariably gets wonderful reviews, but while the people who do watch it are utterly enchanted - you don't see many bad comments on the show, it's just so very well made - not quite enough people watched it. So due to the not-quite-high-enough ratings and our current economy, the show gets canceled partway through the second season, but the writer has said he would like to finish the plot-threads in a comic book form or perhaps a TV movie. The network has not objected to such ideas.

Oh well. All good things end.",1229558400,,1240,4.373913043478261

3258268,5,B000YAA2SQ,"PUSHING DAISIES is a rare treat.  It creates a charming modern fairy tale romance with wit, humor, and creativity and the show's technical flair of bringing its magical world to life is matched only by the heart of its storytelling.

But my review isn't intended to sell you on the show.  If the multitudes of gushing reviews here don't do it for you, then perhaps the show just isn't for you.  Instead, I thought I'd share a little more about the contents of the set to help you decide on your potential purchase...

3 discs of pie-eating goodness...
Each disc contains 3 of the 9 episodes that comprise the short-lived Season 1.  The presentation is rather simple.  No trailers, no top menu.  After the copyright warnings and the Warner Bros logo, they start directly into the episodes.  The show is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen and also contain a short end credits sequence where you have a chance to listen to a brief arrangement of James Dooley's beautiful music.  This may vary on the area, but I don't recall ever seeing this bit aired on my local television station, so it was something new to see and hear for me.  The blu-ray popover menus allow you to select language options and episodes.  The third disc also contains the extras...

""delicious interactive featurettes""
If by ""interactive"", they mean clicking through countless menus to watch its 18 mini-featurettes, then sure, let's call it interactive.  Not that I really needed anything more interactive than that.  :)  But in any event, there are indeed featurettes and they are indeed delicious.  Once you navigate to the ""Pie-Time"" menu, you can click on an episode name in order to watch one or more of its featurettes.  Navigating between each episode featurette menu is a bit slow and cumbersome and very ""DVD-like"".  I wish the extras menu could have been overhauled just a bit to take advantage of some of the quicker Blu-ray menu capabilities, but I suppose staring at all the pies while waiting for the next menu to load isn't all that bad...

All in all, there's around 43 minutes worth of featurettes, which typically contains one or two folks from the cast or crew commenting on clips or content from the episode.  Alas, Lee Pace is the only cast member to make an appearance.  The lengths of these featurettes is a bit disappointing, with some of the lasting barely a minute.  Each featurette flies by in a heartbeat, leaving you wanting for more.  It was rather surprising when I noticed that they all add up to over 40 minutes.

In case you care, here are the lengths of each featurette:
- Pie-Lette (3.24 / 1:46 / 2:53)
- Dummy (1:41 / 3:24)
- The Fun in Funeral (2:12 / 2:29)
- Pigeon (1:05 / 2:40)
- Girth (1:10 / 0:56)
- Kitchen (3:00 / 1:46)
- Smell of Success (1:58)
- Bitter Sweets (1:42 / 2:33 / 6:09)
- Corpsicle (1:32

Overall, the featurettes take some clicking to watch, but they're all worth it, if you like the show.  It would have been nice, had they simply combined all the shorts into a single indexed program for ease of viewing.  For extras, 40 minutes isn't too bad, but for a show with such a great ensemble cast and so rich in effects, I had hoped for a little more.  But nonetheless, I'm happy enough.

If you're fan of the show, this seems like a no-brainer to me.  Unlike other TV sets that I've bought, I've found myself popping in PUSHING DAISIES a few times and still thoroughly enjoy it.  I hope the above info has been helpful.

On a final note, as of this writing (November, 2008) it appears that Pushing Daisies has been cancelled.  If you are so inclined, please consider joining one or more of the campaigns to save the show.  Thanks!",1227484800,8,3652,4.574730354391371

The show keeps a lighter tone although it deals with a murder of the week.  Primary colors are used a lot in the costumes and sets to set a unique tone.  Much of the cast has musical stage experience so it is put to use.  Once in awhile Chenoweth breaks into song, even singing next to a janitor in a choregraphed number.  The dialog is unique too.

As a huge fan of stories about the after life, ghosts, psychics, murder mysteries and generally gothic type subject matter I was fascinated. My mistake was not watching it first on t.v. before I ordered it.

The premise of this show sounds fascinating. A man with powers to awaken the dead for sixty seconds at a time teams up with a private eye to solve murders. Sounds great! But alas, this show tries very, very, very hard to be witty, whimsical, imaginative and just darn cute. Imagine Dr. Seuss meets Pee Wee's Playhouse meets a bad David Lynch imitation. The main character owns a pie resteraunt that looks like something out of a poor man's Tim Burton movie. The dialouge sounds like a bunch of clipped, forced one liners. The story is narrated by a horrifically annoying British character whose purpose is unclear except maybe one of the creators read somewhere that smug British sounding types lended whimsy to a story.

The catch? That The Piemaker can never touch what he brings to life, or else they die forever.

Couple murder-mysteries with the ""reanimation"" of Ned's ertwhile childhood sweetheart Chuck and some of the most hilarious scriptwriting this side of Wonderfalls and Dead Like Me, and you have Pushing Daisies, some of the freshest, most original writing to ever grace the TV screen.

3258397,4,B000YAA2SQ,"At a time when some of the best quirky new writing on television had fled to cable (EUREKA on Sci-Fi, MONK, PSYCH and BURN NOTICE on USA), PUSHING DAISIES burst on the TV world on broadcast television (ABC) on October 3, 2007, as something of a revelation.

High concept (""The Pie Maker"" can re-animate the dead with his touch - but only for one minute without dire consequences - a second touch returns the subject to ""natural"" and irretrievable death), with deeply affecting plot twists (two of his early rescues are his beloved pet dog, Digby - a well used golden retriever inexplicably unidentified in the printed cast list - and the girl, Charlotte Charles - a/k/a Chuck, who is the love of his life - leading to some delightful product placements in the service of romance), high comedy (incongruous conversations with the messily dead in the service of solving their deaths - this is a comedy/mystery - have no right to be this funny) and perfect casting (Lee Pace as The Pie Maker, Anna Friel as Chuck and the sublime reactor Chi McBride as charmingly semi-slimy detective Emerson Cod are ably supported by a perfect mix of seasoned stage actors making the transition to screen work seem as natural as pie making), this show was effortlessly the most delightful high style new comedy aired in years. The only real question was how the creators could possibly keep the high concept airborne for additional seasons (even in modern seasons of inexcusably frustrating brevity - at only 9 episodes, this strike shortened first season seems almost bountiful).

The DVD package is enhanced with a nice ""behind the scenes"" featurette which is unfortunately rather too cleverly broken up into brief segments you have to access by clicking on individual ""pie slices"" like a bad session of Trivial Pursuit, but the only real quibble to be made with the issuers' packaging is the disappointing choice to waste the cover of the plastic box with a generic ""Pie Hole"" Menu (The Pie Hole is the awkwardly named restaurant/bakery in the show run by The Pie Maker) and relegating traditional ""cover material"" to only the outer cardboard wrapper which is often lost after purchase. Someone someday must explain why this environmentally unfriendly wrapper is desirable, let alone necessary.

The joke of the menu is *nicely* used for the INSERT listing cast and episodes with original air dates and further content of the discs. Having each of the three discs patterned after a specific pie (apple, cherry and pumpkin) appropriately labeled with a printed paper doily under at least the last (the white inside tray for discs one and two serves the same subtle purpose for them), is very clever - but the pie jokes in packaging should probably have been left at those two gestures.",1224201600,3,2768,4.885106382978724

3258399,4,B000YAA2SQ,"""Pushing Daisies"" is what we've been looking for in television but never seem to find until it's too late--something unique.  It's different, it's creative, it's intelligent, it's zany, and it's written by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bryan/dp/B0001GF2F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bryan</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fuller/dp/B0006GAO18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fuller</a>.  And, surprisingly, enough people watch it for it NOT to get cancelled!  If we're in the renaissance of television--which judging on how many great shows are either in production or on their way, we definitely are--this show is a marker to show that audiences are ready and willing for something different.

There are so many different tastes baked into the pie that is ""Pushing Daisies"" that, at first, it seems like there is too much.  The characters first appear to be caricatures, which makes it all the more relevant when they are fleshed out.  Their little acts of kindness to each other in this non-saccharine show seem so tiny but mean so much.  Each episode is driven by detective work, romance, exploration of death, fantasy, pie making, and fairy tale intrigue that some say is reminiscent of Burton, but I'd say that Bryan Fuller's end product here is more like what Burton aims for but just misses.

It's not as instantly spectacular as Fuller's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Like-Me/dp/B0001GF2F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Like Me</a>, nor can I say I love it as unconditionally as his last show,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonderfalls/dp/B0006GAO18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonderfalls</a>.  But it is consistently entertaining and will definitely grow on you, warming your heart and mind like a pie in the oven.  And when you're done?  You'll be ready... for Season Two.

This show is so entertaining.  There is an underlying story that moves from episode to episode, but the main action is fresh and inventive.  I can't think of any other show on television that is like this one, it is more like a movie in the set, filming, character development, and acting.

Vivid and lively, from the scenery to the clothes to the plotlines, this show is wonderful--absolutely perfect. Because it's so out of the ordinary, though, I'm afraid that not enough people will watch it (it IS a bit bizarre). But hopefully Pushing Daisies will be the show to change how the world works. Hopefully something beautiful will win out (for once) over the bland colloquial (a.k.a those disgusting things we call ""reality"" T.V. shows).",1223769600,2,739,4.826771653543307
3258423,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Pushing Daisies is one of the most unique shows on television. It's about a piemaker named Ned (Lee Pace) who as a boy finds that he can bring anything back to life with one touch. One touch brings life and the 2nd touch makes them die again but for good. However, if someone is brought back for longer than a minute someone has to die in their place.

  Ned helps a detechtive (Chi McBribe) by bringing back victims for a minute to find out who killed them. But when his childhood sweetheart Chuck (Anna Friel) is murdered he finds that he can't let her go after he brings her back. Which leads to frustration for both of them through-out the series since they love each other but can't touch or she'll die again .

  The show is brilliant and colorful with great visuals and narration that sounds similar to Boris Karloff's in How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Despite only having 9 episodes in it's first season it still managed to get a few Golden Globe nominations. It deserved them though since it's one of the funnest, imaginitive and even most romantic shows on television. The cast is perfect as well.",1223596800,2,1108,4.515

Very few programs I have seen ever have this many unexpected twists and turns and great surprises......formulaic it is NOT!  Having it on DVD is a must for me because I often want to rewind to get some of the occasionally rhyming, intelligent and clever dialogue.  For anyone with a whimsical side to them, each show would be a well-spent hour that will fly by much too quickly....and have you looking forward to the next one.",1223510400,2,693,4.564516129032258
3258425,4,B000YAA2SQ,"Pushing Daisies is that rare kind of show that never stops surprising. You end up enjoying every single episode, as outlandish as they are, and liking every single character on the show. Its premise, though far-fetched, is enjoyable and fresh.

A man who can revive the dead with the touch of his finger might be in better shape than Ned the Piemaker. He seems sad in his life. Yes, he can bring back dead things to life, but if they remain alive longer than a minute, then something else in the world has to die. He is alone in his life, or at least, he feels that way. That's why he's decided to drown his sorrow in his pie shop, where his quirky waitress, a perfect and adorable Kristin Chenoweth, is secretly in love with him. In all honesty, Chenoweth is the reason to watch this show. I can't seem to get enough of her!

Ned's life takes a sharp turn when, while investigating the death of a young woman, he ends up reviving his childhood crush, Chuck. Once she's back to life, he can't seem to kill her again and, soon enough, love is in the air between the dead girl and the piemaker.

Every episode is written as a small mystery in which Ned and his gang of colorful characters investigate a death. He revives the dead for a minute in order to receive clues that could help them solve the myseteries behind their death. These moments are always funny and fresh.

But what amazes in the show, besides the incredible performances, is the cinematography. The show is incredibly beautiful to look at. The colors are vibrant, the sets original, the costumes always over the top. Its always a pleasure to watch this show.

Sure, being a fresh series, it has its share of small problems. Lee Pace (Ned) often tries too hard to be cute and Chuck is just too good for her own good. And yet, these small flaws take nothing away from this show. I ended up watching the entire first season in three days. I just couldn't stop. I can't wait to see where the second season will now take me.",1223510400,,1985,4.397820163487738

The colors are bright and beautiful, the actors are charming, and the plot is very creative. This show is very much a gothic fairy tale. It is both uplifting and tragic at the same time. Check it out, you won't regret it!",1223251200,2,311,4.032258064516129
3258427,4,B000YAA2SQ,"From ISawLightningFall.com

At first blush, ABC's Pushing Daisies seems a little too precious for its own good. You notice it first in the cinematography, so bursting with color it's almost eye-searing. Then there's the omniscient narrator who sounds as though he's reading from Grimm's Fairy Tales and who almost always refers to characters by their professions. Hence, the show's protagonist, Ned, becomes The Piemaker since he peddles goodie-filled pastries from a restaurant called The Pie Hole. That's not all Ned -- excuse me -- The Piemaker does. He investigates mysterious deaths with a knitting detective named Emerson and dodges the affections of his love-struck employee Olive. Also, he pines after his childhood sweetheart Charlotte (or Chuck, as he prefers to call her), who he can never have because of a deadly secret.

Sound too saccharine? A little self-consciously screwy? It would be, except for that part about Ned's talent. You see, he can raise the dead. Murders are much easier to solve when you talk with the victims afterward. One touch from Ned and they're alive. Another and they're dead again. But if they stay in this mortal coil for more than a minute, someone else must shuffle it off. He's raised and put down a ghastly menagerie. A businessman mauled by a rottweiler. A pilot thrown through a plane's windshield during a crash. A student incinerated in an explosion. But there's one victim he can't bear to touch a second time, a lonely tourist who was strangled on a cruise ship. That victim is Chuck.

Combining mirth and the macabre is tough, but Pushing Daisies pulls it off. It also provides something of an object lesson. Be it dark or light, an overly narrow tonal range hampers a story, thinning its audience and stripping it of conflict. Why care if you immediately know the perky blonde will win the hunk with little fight or end up disemboweled by the creeping horror? Variation makes things interesting. Marrying opposites sometimes makes them compelling.",1223164800,,2000,5.018072289156627

On a TV Guide level, I suppose it might be difficult to describe a show like this, much less give it a full on critical review, given the mix of comedy, tragedy, romance, and mystery.

On another, very simple level, the one that resonates, and which makes it work oh-so-very-well, is that whatever twists and turns it throws at you, the jokes, the intrigue, the side-stories of the victims who's murders they solve, at the end of it all, this is a love story.

'course, all the little things it adds along the way don't exactly hurt.

All in all, wonderful show that does a great job of making you truly feel for the characters like not many stories can, and the production values for the bluray version are the best anyone could ask for, from the field of daisies in the opening sequence, to Digby's fur.

It reminds me of, in no particular order: Adams Family, Amelie, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Moonlighting, and Dead Like Me. Plus the fast talking of the Gilmore Girls and countless 1930's screwball comedies. It's got the darkness and morbid humor of Edward Gorey and the Lemony Snicket books A Series of Unfortunate Events.

Yes, I am a Pushing Daisies fan, a lover of a wonderfully bizarre show that while not necessarily appealing to the mass crowd will delight the right audience. In all honesty I cannot critique it with negativity other than to warn that it is a bit different than the usual tv show.

A palette of pastel and brightness makes up a modern fairy tale that should be all sorts of macabre considering the subject matter but instead manages to be bright and cute, a flashy setting and story balanced with many instances of brilliantly understated acting.  The storyline and concept are whimsical in nature.  The casting and acting are superb.  Some may be shocked at the pragmatic approach to the power over life and death and exceedingly creative murders, but to me it's all part of the charm.

3258485,5,B000YAA2SQ,"This show is like nothing you have ever seen before.  And that is a good thing.

It is the story of the Pie Maker aka Ned (Lee Pace).  To the world, he is best known as the owner of The Pie Hole, where he serves delicious pies with his assistant/waitress, Olive (Kristen Chenoweth).

But Ned has a secret.  With his touch, he can bring the dead back to life.  Of course, there are some conditions.  If he touches them again, they are dead for ever and ever.  And if he doesn't touch them again in one minute, someone else nearby dies instead.

Since The Pie Hole doesn't pay all the bills, Ned works with private investigator Emerson Cod (Chi McBride).  He brings murder victims back to life to find out who killed them, then the two split the reward.

Everything is going along fine until the next murder victim is the girl he calls Chuck, aka Charlotte Charles (Anna Friel).  Chuck was Ned's childhood sweetheart, and he just can't bear to let her die, so he keeps her alive.  While the two build a non-touch romance, Chuck's two aunts, Vivian and Lily (Ellen Greene and Swoosie Kurtz) mourn her death.

But Chuck's death is just the beginning of the weird cases.  There are the human crash test dummies, the dog breeder with four wives, the bodies in the snowmen, and the exploding scratch and sniff book.  And that doesn't even mention my favorite case, the headless horseman who is after Olive.

So by now I'm sure you've figured out just how weird this show really is.  But it is so much fun, too.  While it is a mystery, the mysteries are only a background to explore the relationships of the characters in the show.  Each week, those relationships advance, grow, and change.  You never know just where they will wind up.

And that's not to mention the look of the show.  Every set and costume uses bright colors and vivid light.  The show was made for HD, and I can't wait to watch it on my new HD-TV.  Plus the make up on the dead bodies is outstanding.  If they don't win some Emmys for make up, something is seriously wrong.

And I must admit, I love the show's humor.  The lines come fast and furious with plenty of banter, especially between Ned and Chuck.  Jim Dale is also in the cast as the omniscient narrator, and he adds his own touch to the show.

Yes, this show is quirky and odd.  But please don't let that stop you.  Get this set and give it a try.  You'll be hook on the quirky before you know what hit you.",1221523200,4,2431,4.342984409799555

  This show leaves you with the same feeling any Tim Burton film leaves you with. In no way is that me criticizing this show. Maybe you'd take it that way if you didn't like Tim Burton, but I do. Especially Edward Scissorhands. It's the kind of show that has a fairy tale feel with a splash of reality. Reality in it's syrupy sweetest form. I'd say pie, but I don't really like pie.

Ned has the gift of changing people's cold fortunes, bringing them back to life. Unfortunately, if they're alive for more than 60 seconds, then someone else must take their place in the underworld. Since Ned doesn't want to inadvertently take another's life, he has to touch them again before the clock expires. This is both a blessing and a curse. It's a curse in that his childhood was hell because of it, and he can't touch his girlfriend now. The blessing is he can solve crimes by bringing back the disfigured murder victims to extract the information he needs to solve crimes, which adds income to his pie business, and makes his partner, Emerson Cod rather happy.

These facts must be known to get any of the series. But even if you still don't get it, you'll appreciate the characters at least. This show has more quirky character that are so brilliantly developed, you would think this show was on USA. But it's not just the character. Brilliantly designed by all involved, this almost-fanciful world takes cues from people like Tim Burton and other such out-there stylists. The world lives and breaths effortlessly, and amazes you with the irony and quirk of it all.

And even though this show is supposed has all the detective/murder-mystery elements that we know and watch endlessly, this show not only adds Ned's unique twist, but also much humor and wit in it's murder stories. Case in point, when Ned brings back the dead for his 60 seconds, they come back with all the scars that killed them. Whether this is a half-rolled face, knives or glass shards sticking out or whatever, it may seem gory, but once you get over the shock factor of the first time, these scenes play for all comedic value, causing you to laugh, no matter how wrong it may be.

The cases have also so far turned up must quirk, whether it's the killer who uses real test-crash dummies, or the guy who says his wife killed him, but he has 3 wives, they all take quirky and ironic twists that keep with the show's feel. Never do the cases feel over-done, in fact, they might feel a bit underdone. Because the murder isn't the focus here, it's just a side-story. The show is all about the characters, and there story plays out centerstage, instead of the other way around.

And how could I go on without also giving props to the narrator, Jim Dale. Yes, I'd say it's pretty unique for a TV series to have a narrator, and no he does not bore you, but rather, he enchants you with this forensic fairy tale, giving you all the details without it sounding like an explanation.

So overall, certainly a show I'll keep watching well into this season to see how things all pie-pan out. It restores faith in the originality of shows on ABC and network TV. Certainly ABC's best show, and certainly must-see TV, Pushing Daisies is the quirkiest and most ironic show on TV today. Can you say Emmy's?",1219104000,4,3299,4.554806070826307

3258527,5,B000YAA2SQ,"I completely agree with the raves this show has gotten, but none of the reviews mentioned directly the element of the show I like most - it progresses. I've abandoned numerous hit tv shows after a season or two because once it was apparent the show WAS a hit, the original plotline is derailed, delayed, often dismissed completely. The Lost cast can't get off the island until the ratings drop, Earl's list suddenly falls by the wayside for wacky adventures, even Mulder and Scully don't give a damn about the aliens anymore, it goes on and on. It's an infuriating betrayal on the part of the storytellers, one I lost my taste for years ago. Imagine the outcry if JK Rowlings had, in the Deathly Hallows, had Voldemort announce a 4-year scheme that would last Harry and Co thru college!

Not so PD. The show is episodic, but within it's framework are some ongoing threads, potential time-bombs laid out in the original plot and subsequent episodes, easily recognizable to the experienced tv viewer; these are either exploded or defused, in their own time rather than being artificially delayed for sweeps, the season finale, the series finale, or maybe the heat death of the Universe. All those moments when, watching other shows, you find yourself thinking  - maybe even saying aloud - ""Just SAY it already!"" are followed by the characters doing just that! It's incredible - it's like the writers are actually confident in their ability to come up with new stories and so don't feel the need to drag out one or two plotlines until advertising revenues wane.

There's a great feeling of satisfaction to watching (and re-watching) Pushing Daisies as life's doors open and close for the characters, leading them to NEW doors rather than everyone going back and forth through the same doors over and over (yep, Ross and Rachel, I'm talking to YOU).

Pushing Daisies is so tightly plotted it could end at a moment's notice with no loose ends. You don't HAVE to watch it to see how things will end - you WANT to watch it to see what happens next. I'd almost forgotten what that's like.",1216771200,8,2080,4.7217630853994494

Quite simply.......BRILLIANT.
And this is from the guy who hasn't watched ANY tv show regularly since Cheers and The X Files went off the air.
I saw the pilot and fell in love with the show.
Quirky characters, great script, awesome acting.
And the visuals?
Just like the creators wanted, a story book brought to life.
I can't wait till season two comes along.
Hopefully Burton fans will start to really pick up on this show.
It would suck so bad if this show ended up going off the air, like Arrested Development just because people aren't willing to give it a shot.
Comon people, just because it's different...AND IT IS!!! Doesn't mean it's not any good.
Give it a shot. I'm not sure exactly where it fell in the overall tv rankings but as far as I'm concerned, anything less than a top ten finish is inexcusable.
A must watch and a classic in the making.

Even if you've never seen a single episode, this is a great series to own on DVD.  Definitely a safe purchase if you like Tim Burton movies and other shows of the same genre, like Showtime's ""Dead Like Me"".

3258553,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Now that the format wars are over and Blu Ray has won out over HD TV, I have taken the high def plunge.  And the first thing that I have purchased in Blu Ray is PUSHING DAISIES.  It won't be out until September, but for symbolic reasons I made this my first purchase in the format.  The series is so visually stunning that it is perfect for high def presentation.

Season One of PUSHING DAISIES ended prematurely. Sadly, the show, which was supposed to run through 22 episodes, has ended at 9. Many shows have been adversely affected by the WGA strike, but except for FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS (which not only is going to be cancelled, but did not even get to wrap up its final season, so that it will end with the narrative dangling, an unfitting end to one of the most brilliant shows on TV) none as much for my money as PUSHING DAISIES. This is simply one of the most original, extraordinary shows in the history of television. I awaited the arrival of each of the nine episodes comprising Season One like many await the release of highly anticipated films. That we got only the fraction of a season is heartbreaking.

In case anyone questions whether the season is indeed over, creator and producer Bryan Fuller has stated bluntly that the show will not resume production until next summer, when they will start work on Season Two. And to make it all even more definite, this past week it was announced that Anna Friel, who plays Chuck on the show, will very shortly start filming LAND OF THE LOST with Will Ferrell. You can't shoot new episodes if your female lead is unavailable.

What makes this so heartbreaking is how incredibly fresh and original this show was from the very first episode. I was enthralled from the very first seconds. As the camera moves up from underneath the earth, through the roots of the plants and grass just under the surface, and then up to reveal a vividly yellow field of flowers through which young Ned is running, I was completely entranced. Everything about the show affected me in similar fashion from the music, to the extraordinary use of color (the color is what causes many people to compare it to AMELIE), to the relentless number of wonderful sets. I've never seen a show that I have found so visually exciting.

And luckily the writing and the acting is every bit as good as the art design. It is almost impossible to over praise the writing on the show for two reasons. First, when you watch the first episode, it is so stunningly good that your immediate reaction is: they can't possibly keep this level of excellence up. Yet, they do. In fact, the show doesn't merely stay as good as the pilot (or ""Pie-lette,"" as it is titled), it gets better. The show doesn't merely have a brilliant premise, but has a plan. Although we've had only 9 episodes, any viewer will definitely get the sense that this show is going someplace very specific. Second, the show features some of the wittiest dialogue ever found on television. Many compare the dialogue to that on THE GILMORE GIRLS, both for its immense cleverness and wonderful wordplay, but for its sheer quantity. Without doubt those two shows probably have more words per minute than any shows ever previously seen. (Interestingly, some of PUSHING DAISIES is filmed on the part of the back lot upon which THE GILMORE GIRLS was filmed.) Part of the reason for this is that any spots that on other shows would result in silence on PUSHING DAISIES provides an opportunity for the Narrator, who embellishes the story in marvelous fashion. Other shows have featured narrators, but in my opinion only ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT does so quite so well.

PUSHING DAISIES features a wonderful if somewhat compact ensemble cast. Lee Pace, whom many may know from an earlier Bryan Fuller series WONDERFALLS (on which he played the main character's brother), plays Ned aka The Pie Maker, who ""isn't like the other boys,"" in that whenever he touches a dead thing he brings it back to life, with two caveats. First, if he touches that dead thing (or person) a second time, they will be dead forever. Second, if he doesn't touch it or them again within 60 seconds, something else must die in its place. Anna Friel plays Ned's great childhood love Chuck aka Dead Girl, who is brought back to life by Ned after she was murdered. Of course, this means that Ned and Chuck can never touch directly, which is, as Olive Snook points out, tragic (""notwithstanding big ticket items like genocide and death""). The outrageously talented Kristin Chenoweth plays Olive. Although one of the great Broadway musical talents of her time, neither TV nor the movies have found a way to take advantage of her. Until now. At first I was perplexed why they would cast such a huge talent in what was clearly the second female lead, but as the series goes along Olive quickly became one of my favorite characters. And Kristin even sang a song, performing ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" in one of the season's highlights. Ned's partner in solving crime, the delightfully named Emerson Cod, is played by Chi McBride. Emerson is hands down the funniest, most delightful character on the show and perhaps a majority of the funniest lines on the show are uttered by McBride. Chuck's aunts are played by two more Broadway stars, Swoosie Kurtz and Ellen Greene. The Narrator is performed by Jim Dale, who is perhaps best known as the reader of the Harry Potter books on CD. For me he is one of the most wonderful things about the show, providing precisely the right texture and background to every scene. But one other performer has to be mentioned, or rather a pair of performers. I can't tell them apart and I don't know the name of the second ""actor,"" but Orbit and another Golden Retriever play Ned's dog Digby. Orbit played JD (short for Just Dog) on an earlier Bryan Fuller series, DEAD LIKE ME. I have no idea how they get the reactions on film that ""Digby"" makes to things that happen around him, but to watch him you'd swear he really is acting. My favorite Digby scene might be his interaction with Olive during her singing of ""Hopelessly Devoted.""

As much as I love this show I have to add that I've been amazed and perplexed that not everyone I know who has seen it has liked it. Some don't like the Narrator. Some don't like the fast-paced dialogue. I simply can't account for this. PUSHING DAISIES does have a very definite style. I suppose that if the style rubs you the wrong way, you might not like it. But for me and several of my closest friends, this is one of the most magical shows I've ever seen. My two all time favorite shows are BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. How much do I love PUSHING DAISIES? Although there have been only 9 episodes, right now I am inclined to say that I love it as much as those two, making it one of my three all time favorite shows. Which is just another reason why I have been so upset by its truncated debut season. But with the writers strike finally about to end (as I write this it has been indicated that the union will vote two days from now on the new contract), I am eagerly looking forward to Season Two. What accidentally turned out to be the final episode of Season One did end on a bit of a cliffhanger and works fairly well as a transition to Season Two. Be sure to watch this to get ready for it.",1214611200,36,7318,4.550493545937737
3258554,5,B000YAA2SQ,"Obviously, since this title is not yet released, I can only comment on the series itself. There's really only one thing to say about it: it's brilliant!
If you enjoyed the deadpan humour of Dead Like Me as well as its more serious and heart warming sides, liked the quirkyness of shows such as Wonderfalls, then I'm certain you'll enjoy Pushing Daisies.

Lee Pace is wonderful as the good hearted pie maker, Anna Friel couldn't be more adorable as the - unfortunately dead, but revived - love of his life. Chi McBride is no Mandy Patinkin, but he delivers in his part. Then there's Kristin Chenoweth as Olive Snook. She works for the pie maker and is (not so secretly) in love with him. She is probably the most entertaining character on the show and you just can't help but adore her.

I just hope that Amazon is right this time and the release actually is for all Blu-ray regions, otherwise, I probably won't be able to enjoy this wonderful show on Blu-ray due it being rather unlikely to be released in Europe. Btw, dear people at Amazon, when are you going to learn that Blu-ray uses different region codes than DVD? There is no region 1 for Blu-ray, it must be region A instead.
And while I'm at it, dear studios and publishers, get rid of the darned region codes altogether. They'll eventually be overcome also for Blu-ray and they're just annoying the hell out of those people that actually buy what you have to sell (especially annoying if there's no chance for a release of a title in the region you happen to live in).",1212364800,22,1528,4.512635379061372
3258555,5,B000YAA2SQ,"PUSHING DAISIES was probably the best new show of the strike-shortened season of 2007-2008.  It was something very unique, much like DEAD LIKE ME and TWIN PEAKS.  There was a cheerfulness to it that is missing from televison these days.

Performances: Lee Pace is charming as the main character, Ned.  Anna Friel, an actress fom England, plays Charlotte ""Chuck"" Charles with elegance.  The best performances, however, come from Chi McBride and Kristin Chenoweth as Emerson Cod and Olive Snook.  These are the characters that keep me coming back for more.  They are in my Dream Emmy Ballot for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.

Plot: Every episode we are given a mystery that is to be solved by Ned, Emerson, Chuck, and sometimes Olive.  The mysteries are predictable, but they're fun to watch.  There we're severel songoing storylines throughout the season, including the realtionship between Chuck and Ned, Chuck's two aunts not knowing about her being alive, and Olive's unrequited love with Ned.

Score: The score for this show is extravagant.  It's beautiful and moving, the kind of music you hear in fairy tale movies.  It sets the movie very nicely.

Overall, this was a shining light in a dark season of televison.",1212105600,5,1258,4.985576923076923
