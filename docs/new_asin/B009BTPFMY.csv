8539448,5,B009BTPFMY,"This seminar by David Peterson should go down in the annals of history being one of the single best seminars covering the Wooden Dummy ever created,  He shows in detail step by step movements on the Jong, how they will work, why some movements in the Ip Man system have been modified by his teacher GM Wong Shong Leung.  Why some movements will work in application, and others (unmodified) don't.  This seminar will help you increase your skill level on the Jong as well as build more confidence in executing the movements.  There is no doubt that you will truly get to know know and master the Jong no matter what Sifu you have studied under. This DVD is a jewel for any Wing Chun practitioner.",1397779200,2,695,4.492063492063492
