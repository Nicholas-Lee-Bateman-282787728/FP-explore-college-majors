200706,5,1594444536,"I recently rented this movie and found it disturbing and revealing.  How a group of people, working for ""the best interest of the public"" is kept secret, in this day and age is shocking.  Kirby's efforts are funny and rewarding... GREAT JOB  A must see if you wanna see how much of a land of the free we DON'T live in... Censorship is alive and well in Hollywood....",1259712000,7,366,4.352941176470588
200707,3,1594444536,"How long does it take to explain a double-standard? I suppose it depends on how frustrated the double-standard in question has you. Kirby Dick took 1 hour and 37 minutes to explain his frustrations with double-standards that the MPAA sets (regularly) on films depicting sex & violence, and Kirby's explanation is about 1 hour more than it needed to be.

In a nutshell, Kirby's documentary-of-sorts primarily attempts to expose the monopoly that the MPAA holds over independent filmmakers trying to break through. Basically Kirby thinks that an organization (the MPAA) whose exclusive members are the ""Big Six"" major Hollywood studios (Disney, Sony, Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Universal, and Warner Brothers) will try to hinder an independent film's chances of getting better than an NC-17 rating if it has any ""controversial"" sex and violence. Where, on the flip-side, Kirby says that a movie with the same (or very similar) scene from one of the Big Six's studios would earn an R rating.

And Kirby makes a very good case. But after 30 minutes, I'd say most of us get the point. The excessive elaborations in ""This Film Is Not Yet Rated"" go far beyond need-to-know. But, hey, Kirby can make a long movie if he wants to; Freedom of Speech is a Constitutional right, no?

Ahhh...Freedom of Speech...now that's the issue that I thought would be the primary focus of ""This Film Is Not Yet Rated""...not, ""No fair, the MPAA is a monopoly.""

The issue to me is that we are taught that we all have Freedom of Speech as a Constitutional right. Not just the MPAA, but other regulatory groups and corporate entities (the FCC, production companies, theater owners, broadcasters, etc, etc, etc) all say, ""That's fine. You can say it, but we won't put it on the air."" Therefore, for Kirby to zero in on the MPAA (for over 90 minutes) was a bit narrow, and a better film would have included the other entities (deities in their own minds?) that just say ""no"" to free speech.

I'm certainly not for any forms of libel or slander. I'm not into snuff films. I think that a porn movie that glorifies rape should be thrown in the same category as child porn (illegal). But in this day and age where anything...and I mean anything...is so readily available with the nearest Internet connection to people young and old, why is it that mainstream media is still being censored?

If people are given fair warning to the content of media, it should be up to the viewer or listener to tune out or know better than to tune in. What's offensive to me is that I might be restricted from some form of media as it was intended because someone thinks he knows better than I do what I should or should not be able to see (or hear).

I actually like the premise of the MPAA. It's too bad for folks like Kirby Dick if a group like the MPAA truly is holding them down. After seeing Kirby's film it does seem like the NC-17 rating could be unfair at times.

The G, PG, PG-13 and R system is a good one, and it should be used broadly across all media. It let's viewers and parents know what they or their kids could be in for. Unfortunately, the MPAA doesn't always get the rating right; there are plenty of R's that could easily have been PG-13's and vice versa. But I can live with that verses censorship.

The other more restrictive rating perhaps should be P for porn, and applied specifically to movies that are made to sexually stimulate...not to movies that ""have a sex scene in them"".

(Sure, I know, my little remedy might need some polish, but I'm trying to keep myself to under 1 hour and 37 minutes here).

Clearly I don't feel that some government official or anyone should be allowed to restrict you from what you can see and hear. As for Kirby's movie...he does have a point that inspires discussion. But I think your time would be better spent commenting on this review with your take on the issue.",1180396800,2,3879,4.57492795389049
200708,5,1594444536,"Don't miss ""This Film Is Not Rated"", a thorough investigation of the ridiculous system of rating films in the US. Our system only rates films on the basis of sexuality and the American public has no input into the system. The rating system in Europe only rates on the basis of violence. It is almost impossible to find out who the raters are, but Ironweed has found many of them and interviews them on this DVD.",1385856000,5,411,4.421052631578948
200709,3,1594444536,"This is another unusual documentary about Hollywood. It is a 2006 documentary about MPAA rating procedures, cultural values, filmmakers as artists and politics. The filmmakers build their case that many ratings are arbitrarily given by the MPAA. For example, films with sexual content will often get 'NC-17' ratings although many very violent movies can pass with a 'R' rating. Even talking about sex is taboo and some sexual acts are seemingly banned outright. They point out the leniency shown violence over sexual themes and bad language. Some interesting practices are brought up but this documentary does not quite work as a freedom of expression outlet. I'm not surprised large studios have more pull and do empathize with the artists represented. However, some of the people interviewed enjoy playing pranks and making jokes about MPAA members which do not all come across as good taste. We see people getting followed, trash being dug through by private investigators and harassing phone calls and meetings. In the end, they are no closer to providing any new information on the matter as they were in the beginning. This is low brow because it is not something that will go down in history as a political statement. A balanced perspective is not provided. I suppose the point is to shake you up somewhat but this documentary will definitely rub everyone the wrong way (at least a little bit). It's like Private Parts, Bowling for Columbine and Jerky Boys wrapped up into one. We hear from some directors, actors and industry members, such as Trey Parker and Matt Stone, but they never seem to add much to the conversation other than trying to intimidate people into accepting their point of view and cracking jokes. Amazon reviewers give this a lowly 3.5 stars.",1380326400,,1770,4.983108108108108
200710,5,1594444536,"When this documentary was first released, the MPAA was the sole authority concerning film classification. Although the second amendment provided ironclad protection for individual expression, unrated films could only be screened in select cinemas. As such, self-censorship and kowtowing to the edicts of the MPAA were commonplace. Corruption and preferential treatment is rampant for Hollywood films. Any company wishing to obtain a lesser rating need only inquire into this.

Among the seldom-known facts of the MPAA's regime include the following:

- PG-13 films can only include one f-bomb.
- PG-13 films cannot show excessive blood. Bullets and explosions are A-OK, though (this is criticised as part of how society lies to its children through this policy decision).
- Gay and lesbian sex is more likely to be rated NC-17 than R.
- Simply talking about sex too much can land you in hot water and an NC-17 rating.
- Most members are Republicans and do NOT reflect the demographics that the MPAA claims they do.

Among some of the more pernicious and nonsensical decisions include:

- But I'm a Cheerleader being slammed with an NC-17 rating. Its offense? A young girl fondling herself while fully clothed. This film was rated M in Australia (recommended for children 15 and over).

There is fertile ground for further research and analyses, especially concerning video game classification. A game rated M 17+ by the ESRB (Ar Tonelico 3) was rated only PG in Australia.",1370131200,3,1472,5.116666666666666

200714,1,1594444536,"First of all, I could not make it through the whole movie, so maybe it improved after the first 45 minutes but I seriously doubt it.
I got this video hoping to learn more about the MPAA, but all I got was whining directors who can not allow certain footage or their movie will go from R to NC-17.
And then I get a real life love affair of a private detective hired by the movie directors to stalk the MPAA. What does this have to do with anything in the movie?",1338768000,4,460,4.010869565217392

200716,5,1594444536,"Accurate and impartial documentary making at its best

This documentary reveals one of the ambiguous and clandestine way which information (in this case, in the form of films) is filtered and censored in America, the so-called 'land of the free.' It is a very articulate, impartial and wholly watchable expose that views more like a piece of Hollywood's fiction rather than what it is; non-fiction and the reality of the American film industry.

I think that anyone who watches this will be given another piece of the puzzle, will have their blinkers widened and adjusted just a little and have their vision sharpened, what they then choose to do with this new knowledge and perspective is a different matter.",1330387200,,709,4.949579831932773
200717,5,1594444536,"What irked me more about this movie was the subject matter. The MPAA ratings turn out to be so subjective. Too subjective in my opinion.

If 'they' don't like you, 'they' can trash your movie and you are basically left holding nothing. All you can do is just edit your movie more and resubmit it to the board for reevaluation and apparently eventual denial and more editing yet if they like you they will let stuff slide.

AND the whole hypocrisy of the ratings. You make a movie that sprays bullets like they were gumdrops and don't show any bad things happening like innocent bystanders getting killed and you can get a good rating but, oh gawd, show a kiss for too long or the 'wrong kind of affection' and your movie is tossed. As if spraying bullets is better than a healthy display of affection and sex. And heck, the spraying of bullets doesn't even have to be an integral part of the plot and it's just great but non-gratuitous sex is so 'nasty' and 'dirty' and I could go on...

Just because you are too repressed to enjoy it or hide in closets doing it doesn't mean that shielding people from it is a good idea... I'd rather see healthy sex than bullets and blood... I would think that raising a well rounded and moral human being would involve showing them what a significant part of their life a healthy respect for sex and affection can be...",1296950400,2,1355,4.433734939759036
200718,4,1594444536,"I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out.  True, it's not in the same league with a Michael Moore movie, but Kirby Dick raises some really important issues concerning censorship and the control of the M.P.A.A.  The video was sent quickly.  This is great company to deal with.",1294012800,,289,4.519230769230769
200719,1,1594444536,"To me, the limited value of this documentary is that it shows how the current rating system is slightly subjective according to the mysterious board of reviewers, who are, oddly, perhaps the last conservative voice in Hollywood. Moreover, the point that Europeans take sex as nonchalantly as we take violence is very much worth pondering. Two points that do seem to be true are that if it is a comedy, you can get away with a lot more than if it is a drama, and if it has anything to do with gay themes, it will be more scrutinized.

Filled with rather explicit sex scenes, supposedly to prove their point that they are innocuous, this film is more about the damage that an NC-17 rating can do to sales than anything else. It's guised in talk like ""we want to reach more viewers with our art"" when it is clearly about sales. Team America is not going to suffer viewers with an NC-17 rating. Directors, actors and producers each lament how their films were subjectively overrated to NC-17 because of this or that position, the showing of women experiencing pleasure, or the taking of gay themes too far. A few commentators make the ridiculous observation that what they are making is not pornographic because it has artistic value and that the whole artistic enterprise would be ruined were they to, say, crop one scene to not show pubic hair. Oh please. I'm sorry, but if your artistry hangs upon pubic hair, then it seems to me that you are not an artist. This is about as useful as the Supreme Court justice's remark that, well, you just know it when you see it.

Towards the end the director debates with the head of the rating system about why he got an NC-17 rating, when it would appear obvious that since the film is peppered with sex scenes from NC-17 films. It just showed how the film is less than thoughtful.

And, lest I forget, as a subplot two lesbian private investigators do less than impressive PI work to find the identities of the reviewers. They don't even know how to hold binoculars so as not to get noticed and had yet to buy an undercover camera in their years of combined experience. No Magnums there. But that is a quibble. And a silly one.

I felt little sympathy for the director's main points. True the whole rating process is mildly subjective, but as a parent I want to know not the rating, but the little print under the rating. What kind of violence? What kind of sex? Acts have context, and to me this is more useful than the thing itself.",1292803200,9,2473,4.476718403547672
200720,3,1594444536,"This film is definitely one that all movie fans should see - it's not perfect by any stretch, but it does bring to light a problem in the film industry.  Most of us do not even consider the rating board's impact on the films we see.  Kirby Dick brings up some interesting, and disturbing points about a system that has no oversight and it kept completely secret.  What makes this handful of people qualified to rate films?  Why are clergy involved at all?  The strongest part of the documentary are the myriad examples of double-standard and outright prejudice on which films get ""slapped"" with an NC-17, and which get an R.  How does torture porn like ""Hostel"" get an R, but ""Boys Don't Cry"" was given an NC-17 with less nudity (and based on a true story no less)?!  Moreover, why is sex a greater offense than brutal violence?  Children under 17 should be allowed to see ""The Passion of the Christ,"" but not ""Clerks""?  Several prominent directors are interviewed about the ratings process, and their struggle with the NC-17 rating, and Kirby Dick also documents his own journey through the process, including learning that the MPAA illegally made copies of his film!  The film also has a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor, in particular the montage of ""sex scenes"" that counts the number of thrusts that are likely to earn the dreaded NC-17.  Hilarious.

Unfortunately, what weakened this film substantially was how few filmmakers, and absolutely no industry insiders, would consent to be interviewed on camera.  Which made for a very short documentary that the director then padded.  I agree with another reviewer that I couldn't care less who the raters were (the point that they were not parents with children under 17 as publicized was more important than their names), and all the footage of the PI tracking them was utterly boring.  In fact, I fast forwarded through almost all of it.  I think the film would have been better served by letting us hear more from the directors who were interviewed (Matt Stone, Kevin Smith, etc), or by delving deeper into the DVD market and how unrated and director's cuts are benefiting the studios more than if those editions were shown in theatres.  How many consumers go to the theatre for a film, and then are lured into buying the DVD for more footage?

The DVD has a few extras, including deleted scenes with more interview footage, and a scene that considers the MPAA lobby that has impacted copyright laws.  This bit was so intriguing, it would have benefited from another full documentary on the subject!  A Q&A session with Kirby Dick is also included, and was well worth watching.  Overall, the film has many weak points, but is worth seeing just to learn more about who is determining what we see in theatres.",1282262400,5,2758,4.7521008403361344
200721,4,1594444536,"Ever wondered how a movie got its rating?  Why one seems to skate into a rating where as another movie with less ""questionable"" material gets rated much tougher?  Well you aren't alone.  The makers of this film not only wondered, they went out on a mission to find the answers to those questions.  And how does one find those answers?  By attempting to learn the identities of the mysterious rating board.  Stalking out their work place.  Following them to restaurants in the hopes of overhearing work chatter as they eat lunch.  Sifting through their garbage.  Interviewing filmmakers who have dealt with them.

In the end we are left with no real answers, but we do get some interesting commentary on the behind the scenes goings on of the movie industry along the way.",1282003200,3,771,4.7293233082706765
200722,3,1594444536,"Kirby Dick's documentary about the unjust practices of the MPAA takes a very light hearted and rather adolescent approach to what is very serious subject matter. The MPAA is the main censorship organization in The US and has the power to kill any film it wants to right in its tracks. A film slapped with an NC 17 rating can not be advertised, and will not be sold on DVD in most of the major store chains. Since cinema is arguably the most widely consumed form of entertainment by The American public, this means that The MPAA has its finger tips squarely on the pulse of American culture. A pretty scary amount of power considering that The MPAA is not an elected body, and is there for not answerable to the citizens of the country that it is supposedly protecting from mental harm. Instead of treating this issue like it was of national importance by making a stern uptight investigation, Kirby Dick's approach was one of airy easy going humor. This is an approach that can be quit off putting for many viewers. After all, one does get the feeling while watching this movie that Kirby Dick is merely playing pranks on The MPAA like some kind of authority defying school boy.

The gags in TFINYR consist of showing those MPAA offending excerpts that had to be removed from existing films in order to receive that much coveted R rating. Other gags consist of having a set of rudimentary cartoon characters display the language and actions of all the different rating board levels in American films. When those cute smiling cartoon cut outs engage in NC 17 aberrational sexual behavior, it is hard not to laugh out loud at what you're seeing. Another gag in this film is to tally up a count of sexual pelvic thrusts from NC17 movie sex scenes. While each of these Sesame Street styled numbers pop up on the screen, they are accompanied by the ding of a food service bell. All of these gags are actually fairly effective devices, not only because they are quit entertaining, but also because it does clearly demonstrate just how silly this MPAA moral snobbery actually is.

At its worst, TFINYR seems so randomly constructed that it feels sloppy and rudderless half of the time. It is hard not to feel like this film made all its major points in the first half hour and then tried to stretch itself into a feature length film with a bunch of filler. Its best moment was to play R rated heterosexual scenes side by side with identical homosexual NC 17 sex scenes. This display brilliantly lets the viewer know that The MPAA is absolutely biased and thinks it should enforce the notion that homosexuality is somehow amoral and un-American. Another point that clearly comes across is that The MPAA works for and favors the major Hollywood studios while issuing an unfair double standard against independent film makers. These are all great points that needed to be made. It is just that as a cohesive whole, TFINYR feels about as loosely put together as a bowl of oatmeal.

Kirby Dick should of known better!

TFINYR works great as an informative tool to not only show the public that a new and better form of film censorship is indeed needed in our culture, but also as advertisement for movies and film makers that have been given the shaft by The MPAA. As off putting as its laid back style may be, TFINYR is actually speaking the language of the layman by choosing entertainment over seriousness. I was in fact, overjoyed to learn that one of my very favoite films of all time, Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe, is the actual movie catalyst that caused The MPAA to be invented in the first place. This to me is the ultimate badge of honor for my personal film taste. TFINYR accomplishes what it sets out to do, and I would of gladly given it four stars had only Kirby Dick just been a little bit more thoughtful as to which film clips he chose to use while making his ultimate point that violence is far more accepted then sex in American movies.

The film clip he should of used to drive this point home, is that of Arnold Schwarzenegger using an innocent bystander as a human shield on an escalator while spraying the bad guys with a barrage of machine gun fire in Total Recall. Something like that. What he showed the public instead was the pre-rape footage from Straw Dogs by Sam Peckinpah. Not only does this completely defy the very point that he was trying to make in the first place, but it showed an overall lack of understanding and caring about one of the most important films in cinematic history. If the point of his documentary is to make a stand for the integrity of cinema and movie makers alike, then why insult the very history of cinema by cheeply inserting violent images from a black listed film simply because they are visceral? Kirby Dick has to know that Straw Dogs has never once been accepted for even a single solitary second during its 40 years of existence due to nature of the voilence in those very clips he so flippantly inserted into his film. Kirby Dick has to know that the violence in Straw Dogs will never be acceptable in the eyes of the general public, but he chose to insert these clips anyway. He must of thought that like him, no one would care, or know the difference.

We all have our sacred texts.

Not only is it completely asinine to make a point about the acceptance of violence over sex by showing sexual violence of all things, a choice that is utterly stupid, but the violence in Straw Dogs goes well beyond being mere entertainment anyway. Straw Dogs is not The Long Kiss Goodnight or Die Hard. There are no chases, escapes, explosions, acrobatic gun battles, raining cars, or painless death. Straw Dogs shows violence that hurts and gets under your skin and damages you. It is violence that hits you on all levels, especially the sexual psychological level. Straw Dogs shows violence against everything imaginable, including the most controversial rape scene ever depicted in the history of cinema. Till this day, I have never meet a single woman who can watch Straw Dogs all the way through, that is how unforgiving and unrelenting the violence in this film is. I will go on the record by nakedly stating that Straw Dogs is the purest film on violence ever made, even more so then A Clockwork Orange. There is nothing to celebrate or emulate in Straw Dogs. No charming humble narrator like Malcolm McDowell to root for, no futuristic setting to soften the blow. Straw Dogs is a film that forces us all to hold a mirror up to ourselves and cringe at what we see. To think that little Kirby Dick actually thought that he could pass off clips from this masterpiece as if it is the acceptable standard of American entertainment film violence is both laughable and insulting. This single choice by Kirby Dick ruined it for me. That is why I'm going to be stuffing my copy of TFINYR into a coworkers stocking come Christmas time. He has a lot of nerve to display any part of Straw Dogs so completely out of context just to make a stupid point. I guess that this only goes to show that I shouldn't of expected any better from him anyway. After all, he has always been a Dick.",1281225600,6,7121,4.55859375

200725,3,1594444536,"I'll be honest: I liked the movie. As an avid fan of cultural studies, I enjoyed the examination and analysis of the MPAA. The movie simply asks: Why do we let a handful of anonymous people determine what is and is not acceptable to show in a movie theater?

Along the way, the movie raises a number of intriguing questions - why do they bring in two priests to sit in on discussions? Why do they always choose the same two religions for those priests? Do the members of the MPAA live up to their promised qualifications? Is there anything concrete about the rating process?

Unfortunately, many of these questions remain unanswered. The film is a good polemic, it raises thought and discussion, but the director hits a rock wall in his attempts to provide answers.

There's plenty of interesting material here - the discussion of Team America: World Police's utterly ridiculous sex scene, the methods for getting edgy material past the MPAA (the hilarious finding that the MPAA doesn't care -how- you changed something, as long as you changed it), these are interesting.

The absolute highlight of the film, though, is the side-by-side comparison of R-rated heterosexual sex scenes with NC-17-rated homosexual sex scenes. The film presents a series of suspiciously similar scenes that only differ based on orientation - showing the way that the MPAA shuts down attempts to portray homosexuality equally to heterosexuality in mainstream film. The sequence, to me, is one of the best and most brutal cultural critiques ever put to film.

However, This Film Is Not Yet Rated lags after this scene - none of the material afterward lives up to the cultural exploration done in that scene.

As other reviews have noted, the film comes across as petty and sophomoric at times - the scenes with the private investigator made me uncomfortable than anything else. I feel that this can be forgiven given the film's general irreverent tone - it's clear from the comical title sequence that the documentary wishes to inform a little, entertain a little more than that, and mostly thumb its nose at the MPAA.

Overall, I can recommend it - but the whole does not live up to the sum of its parts.",1270425600,12,2182,4.818181818181818

This movie taught me a lot of stuff about the MPAA, and I've already been researching this stuff on my own a lot, so it's jam-packed full of interesting stuff.

The movie seems to be saying that the MPAA should release the names of the people on the board, because these people are responsible for multi-million, if not billion-dollar decisions, and people with that kind of power should take some personal responsibility.

So, it gets a little too Michael Moore-ish for me, where the director hunts down the board members and the review committee, and then publishes the names and occupations of these people on his movie.  But I loved everything else about the movie.",1269820800,,2045,7.246963562753036
200727,4,1594444536,"I saw this film shortly after it came out, and loved it, despite various flaws. I forgot about reviewing it until reading the comments in the reviews for Ma Vie En Rose, a fine film that many were amazed to see receive an R-rating.

That rating makes perfect sense once one sees this movie. Whether we like to admit it or not, there's a lot of control in this country over what we experience from folks who haven't learned how to think properly---that is, with an open mind and wide range of cultural awarenesses. These are the kind of people who keep us permanently in one war or another; apparently the God they worship doesn't like nudity or anything sexual...but he just LOVES violence and war. How does that First Commandment go again?

We are encouraged (by those pulling the strings) to watch graphic, brutal killings day in and night out on TV and in movies, but we are so scared of a little sexuality, especially if it's of a sort that doesn't feature the missionary position and strong feelings of guilt afterwards. These are the kind of folks who quietly review our celluloid art (or lack thereof) and decide what we and our kids are allowed to watch. This film makes that clear, intelligently and with much wry wit.

If you've ever questioned a rating on a movie, see this film and find out why that rating was put there. Our national conscience comes to a large degree from the art we encounter, so control over that art is a big deal for those who stand to make trillions from selling guns and war, and from promoting their neanderthal concepts of what sexuality and religion are.

This doc does have some problems, such as the ineptness of the private investigators, Dick's occasionally immature attitude, and the very one-sided approach in general. But the topic, and the truths presented, outweigh the faults and make this film well worth seeing.

I thought this was a well-known movie, especially among film lovers. Apparently not, from the dearth of reviews here. All I can say is, if you love the art of cinema and wonder why we don't see more of it in this land, watch This Film Is Not Yet Rated to see who subtly shapes our cinematic landscape in ways you might never imagine.",1263513600,15,2198,4.582697201017812

From there the filmmaker hires private investigators who aspire to locate the people who are assisting in giving ratings for films. He submits his own film for a rating.

7799668,5,1594444536,"PERFECTLY ILLUSTRATES THE STUPIDITY OF THE MOVIE RATINGS SYSTEM

The movie ratings system in the United States is a good idea in concept. I have kids. I'd like to know if a movie is appropriate for them before letting them watch it.

But the ratings system we have now is now useful. This documentary shows why. And its very enlightening about the entire process of a movie being reviewed for a rating. Did you know that the MPAA makes content and artistic suggestions to film makers, rather that just reviewing it and rating it like they are supposed to? Did you know that film makers put tons of extra filth, junk, nudity, language, and so forth in film JUST to give the MPAA something to demand gets cut out? What happens is if a film maker puts the version they want to release up for ratings the MPAA will say ""No! This will be an NC-17 rating unless you cut out a bunch of stuff"". So the film makers add in a bunch of stuff, let the MPAA say ""No! NC-17 if you don't make changes!"" then they cut out the changes and the version they actually want to release gets a PG-13 rating.

This documentary talks to many film makers about that process and it's very enlightening.",1440720000,2,1174,4.376146788990826

7799674,5,1594444536,"I have always felt as though the ratings on movies do not accurately represent my family's values.  PG movies are often too violent and emotionally upsetting, and even some G rated movies (Brave Little Toaster?) are not what I would want my children to see when they are young.  My eldest son saw Beauty and the Beast as his first Movie Theater experience, and we had talks afterwards about the inappropriate behaviors and idea of a kidnapped young woman falling for her abductor, etc.

On the other side of the coin, the human body shown nude even for a moment is enough to drive the ratings up.
So if the movie mentions drugs, shows nudity or indicates that sexual pleasure is happening, the movie rating goes straight up.  I am not saying that explicit sex should be shown to young children who could be confused or frightened by these images, but I do object strongly to the amount of violence that is shown in almost every movie marked PG.

Did you know that the rating goes up if war is portrayed as a bad thing?  Unpatriotic wars?  Don't let the PG crowd know how sickening and disturbing WAR is...  And did you further know that homosexual kissing is seen as much more dangerous than heterosexual kissing?

And as for the violence, movies can show any amount of violence they want, just so long as no blood is seen?

Do you know who makes the judgement calls on every movie released?  A handful of wealthy conservatives whose children are mostly adults now and who are kept strictly under pressure not to reveal any details, not even that they are part of the group who rate movies!

Watch this movie, but watch it first without your children if you don't feel that they are ready for some sexual images that had to be cut.  You will be amazed at the little things that are censored to those under 17, and amazed again at the violence and cruelty that is allowed in PG movies.

Whether you agree with MY standards or not,  WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!  You WILL learn a lot.",1391040000,5,1975,4.490196078431373
