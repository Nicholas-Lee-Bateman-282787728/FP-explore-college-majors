4713333,5,B005JZ90M0,"Tomboy is a great film for me. When I was younger than her, I began to dress as a boy and pray every nite to become a boy in the morning. Instead I just kept dressing like a boy and fooling girls into believe I was a boy. Some already knew me and knew I was no boy, but still flirted back. This movie is a lot like that. Helps ignorant fools realize that being gay is no choice, it just is what it is. A child that young that's not even raised by gay parents or a gay atmosphere is gay and wants to be herself and recognized by who she is and what she wants in life. This movie is inspiring and creates a realistic outlook on the dangers in lying about who you are and how people react to it. It also shows a great and loving, comforting feeling of those who are accepting. I totally recommend this film. She is totally the spitting image of who I was as a child and who I am now.",1326585600,4,880,3.8944444444444444
4713334,5,B005JZ90M0,"Tomboy is an extraordinary little film from France that is really worth tracking down and seeing, partly because of the manner in which Cline Sciamma - who directed and also wrote the screenplay - has crafted a film that unfolds in such an unaffected and natural way that it feels like you're actually watching a slice of life, and partly because of the truly amazing performance by the girl, Zo Hran, who plays the film's title character.

Because of the title, Tomboy (which is in fact the title it was originally released under in France), we know exactly what to expect. So when the film begins with what appears to be a ten-year-old boy (Zo Hran) riding in a car with his father (Mathieu Demy), we already know that he is in fact a she, the proverbial tomboy who prefers to look and act like one of the boys. But as they head towards the new town where her family is moving to and where her mother (Sophie Cattani) and six-year-old younger sister Jeanne (Malonn Lvana) are already waiting in their new apartment, we are gradually and subtly drawn in to the illusion, particularly when the father indulgently lets the 'boy' sit in his lap and steer the car. We still know that it's a girl, but in her appearance and manner, we need no convincing that she could easily be mistaken for a boy.

When the girl (we later learn her name is Laure) starts exploring her new neighborhood, she sees a group of neighbor kids playing and goes to join them. The first one she meets is a girl her own age named Lisa (Jeanne Disson). Acting purely on an impulse, Laure introduces herself as Mikael, adopting a boy's name to go with her boyish appearance and manner. And it is as Mikael that she's accepted, crossing the gender boundary from girl to boy. As the summer progresses, Laure finds ways to not only maintain her new boy identity as Mikael but to also expand it, crossing further and further into boy territory. Nothing is explained, but the style is so natural and unaffected that no explanation is necessary. Everything simply unfolds on the screen. It begins with Laure/Mikael hanging out with the group of kids but staying close to Lisa as she studies the boys, carefully observing their behavior: the way they rough-house with each other, the way they spit, the way they take their shirts off when playing, and so on. At home though she is Laure, not telling anyone in her family about her little deception. But in secret, Laure/Mikael works on her act - practicing how to spit like a boy, taking off her shirt in front of a mirror to see if she can successfully pass as a boy without it, and later, going to truly daring and imaginative lengths when the boys decide to go swimming. When her little sister Jeanne accidentally finds out about the deception, Laure ends up drawing her into it, including among other things getting Jeanne to assist making her hair even more boyish than it already was.

But of course the masquerade and double life cannot be maintained forever - particularly with school coming up - and an incident in which Laure/Mikael engages in a fight with another boy who pushed Jeanne ends up bringing things to a head when the boy's mother comes to their apartment looking for the mother of 'Mikael'. The sudden change in attitude towards Laure/Mikael by Lisa and the boys shows just how much the unwritten rules of gender boundaries are already firmly in place before childhood is even over.

All of the performances are pitch perfect, a credit to Sciamma's casting choices (most of the child actors were non-trained first-timers) and to her ability to draw incredibly natural performances from them. Zo Hran's Laure/Mikael is a marvel to watch as she starts from an impulse of the moment and then methodically develops her identity as the new boy in the neighborhood instead of the new girl. It is a delight to watch her as she explores and relishes being 'one of the boys' and all of the freedoms that role gives her. Malonn Lvana's Jeanne is totally believable as Laure's younger sister, completely girly in sharp counterpoint to Laure's tomboyishness. And in priceless 'baby sister' fashion, threatening to tell their mother when she first learns of Laure's deception and then letting herself be bribed into participating with the privilege of getting to tag along when Laure/Mikael meets up with the older kids. Jeanne Disson's Lisa is subtly effective, acting with her eyes as she watches Mikael: jealous of his company when he wants to play with the boys, envious of his ability to engage with the boys in ways she cannot and getting to do things she cannot, and all the while sensing that there is something different about Mikael, something that she can't quite put her finger on but has to do with the affinity she instinctively feels with him. One of the film's best scenes occurs when Lisa invites Mikael to her house and ends up getting 'him' to let her put make-up on 'him'. Mathieu Demy as Laure's father is good-naturedly indulgent of Laure's tomboyishness, while Sophie Cattani as her mother is loving but no-nonsense and it is she who puts her foot down when the deception is revealed. The boy actors are handled an interesting way, existing more as a group than as individuals, so that they're always 'the boys' as a presence, accentuating the invisible boundaries that exist between them and 'the girls'.

Highly, highly recommended, both for the unaffected non-Hollywood style, for being a masterful and original slice-of-life work of cinema, and for Hran's truly amazing and award-worthy performance as Laure/Mikael.",1325116800,36,5564,4.755693581780538

Tomboy or transgender?  It's not like every parent is even going to ask this question.  I had a lot of sympathy and admiration for the parents in this story.  This is an engrossing story of childhood and how things play out when a 10 yr old girl spends the summer secretly passing as a boy with the neighborhood kids.

Set in France, a pregnant mother, her husband and two young girls have recently moved to a new town.  Laure is a cute tomboy who is allowed to ""play boy"" (as her mother puts it)... her hair is short and messy, clothes baggy, and she's got a slim build and androgynous look.  All her friends are usually boys.  While out and about in the new neighborhood, Laure runs into a girl named Lisa and takes on a new identity when asked for a name.  Laure becomes Mikael and Mikael and Lisa become fast friends.  Soon Mikael integrates ""himself"" into a clique of neighborhood boys... Lisa is a softer tomboy and the only girl who tags along with them.

As the summer passes, Mikael continually challenges herself to assimilate more and more... taking off her shirt for sports, going swimming in speedos, and dealing with the crush Lisa has on her.  All the while I'm on the edge of my seat, shaking my head, and waiting for the inevitable ""unmasking""... I'm afraid this is going to get ugly and maybe even violent and I can't bear to watch what might come next.  School is getting ready to start and Lisa questions why she hasn't seen Mikael's name on the class roster.  There is no way out of this one.

The inevitable does happen and you'll just have to watch it to see how it plays out.  Overall, the story is both heartbreaking and heartwarming.  Laure/Mikael's parents were an interesting study of parenthood.  They were extremely loving people and I think they dealt with it the best they could.  The concept of transgender is never spoken about or dealt with here.  I don't think this is the first thought on every parent's mind when your child is so young and a tomboy.  And while Laure/Mikael definitely went beyond ""tomboy"" this summer... I don't think it's 100% clear if she's transgender or not or how far this will go as she grows up.  I didn't feel I should presume that far. A key element to focus on here is just how loving and accepting and honest the parents are.  Even the younger sibling embraces her older sibling with such love.  Whatever lies ahead for this family will be done in the context of living honestly and how much they all love each other and that is what is most key to note about this film.  I will say that the ending was truly sweet and unexpected and very hopeful... had I known that, I'd of watched this sooner.

Absorbing story.  Loved the family dynamics.  Some of the exchanges between the siblings were a bit more mature than any 10 yr old and 6 yr old I can imagine, however.  But how adorable they were.

Can be found on Netflix under foreign movies.",1425600000,2,2950,4.45981308411215

In this case, the main character explores expectations of gender - how girls and boys are supposed to act and behave, and what it means to freely choose one's own gender assignment and the struggles that go with making such a choice.

4713361,4,B005JZ90M0,"The first third to first half of the movie would be a little boring if you did not already know from the title that ""Mickael"" was a girl. (There is a bathtub scene about fifteen minutes into the movie where she stands up in the tub and the audience sees just enough of her to confirm that she is a girl in case anyone may have been doubting it.) This slow pace is however appropriate for the story line since she is just fitting in as one of the boys. The movie is played out as a serious drama, it never goes for the quick laugh, or for that matter any laugh at all. It is the suspense that keeps it from actually being boring, you know that this situation cannot continue indefinitely. But when will her secret get out? What will eventually give her way? What will the reactions of the other children be? The suspense increases as situations develop where she has to try harder to maintain the illusion, such as preparing to go swimming. (I will add that just making herself a boy's speedo out of an old one piece swimsuit was not enough to maintain the illusion, she had to make additional preparations.) The suspense also increases as it becomes obvious that Lisa is looking at Mickael as more than just a friend who happens to be a boy.

The casting of the main character was excellent. I believe with the proper hair style, clothing, etc. she would be a lovely girl, but with the short hair and boys clothing she passes as a skinny boy who might be considered slightly effeminate but not enough to give her away. I have seen boys who acted more effeminate, but they also got kidded by the other boys for acting effeminate. During the movie the other children never make fun of Mickael for acting slightly effeminate, I suspect that the director did not want to bring attention to this slight imperfection in her acting (meaning the character's acting not the actress' acting, it was perfect for the character.)

Overall I liked the movie, I do however have two minor criticisms: There is a thirty second clip included in the ""behind the scenes featurette"" which appears to be a continuation of the final scene of the movie. I would have left it on the final scene if I had been editing the movie. My other criticism might be considered a slight spoiler. At one point while she is playing shirtless with the boys her panties are clearly visible above her shorts but none of the boys seem to notice that ""he"" is wearing girls underwear. The other boys might have overlooked her slight effeminate behavior, considering how slight it was, but wearing girls underwear is something else altogether.",1407024000,,2598,4.537313432835821

The English subtitles were mostly well done, but in a couple of places, the choice of English translation did not correspond correctly to the French dialog (awkward translations--not incorrect, just not the best).  The subtitles were also placed at the very bottom of the screen, and occasionally were off the screen on one of my television/dvd sets.  I had to move to a different TV and dvd to make the full subtitle visible.  One of the best aspects of the film, though totally incidental to the story, was the window into ""normal"" domestic life in France.

4713370,5,B005JZ90M0,"The previous reviews have done a good job of summarizing the plot and the theme of the movie.  Let me just add my reaction and hopefully you will find value in that.  Maybe that will help you decide whether to purchase this movie, or not.

I am not normally captivated by the typical coming-of-age movie, but this one is not typical.  The main character is a ten-year-old girl, who spends the summer passing off as a boy.  Throughout the movie, through her antics and tricks to maintain the lie, I was on the edge of my seat fearing that she would be discovered.  At first, maintaining the lie was easy.  As the plot progressed, events start to put the main character into situations that could potentially expose her secret.  Early on, ""Michael"" is invited to play ball with the other boys.  One team would wear shirts, the other team will go shirtless.  Michael pulls off her shirt and proceeds to join the game.  Thankfully, Michael/Laure still has a nearly-flat, athletic body that could pass for a boy.  She passed this test with flying colors.

Adding complications to the plot is the one girl among the group.  Being slightly more mature than the boys around them, this one starts to crush on Michael/Laure, not knowing that he, in fact, is a she.  Again, I was anxious throughout and feared for Michael.  I kept hoping that Michael and her family would just move away to keep her from having to face the humiliation of being discovered.  This is the sort of thing that could prove very embarrassing for a child and really, her whole family.  Yes, Laure was irresponsible for lying.  Yes, it was a stupid, bone-headed thing to do.  But haven't we all done something dumb as a child?  I wanted her to be spared from the consequences of her actions.

As the story moves along, it becomes harder and harder to maintain the lie.  Michael gets invited to go to the lake with the gang.  In order to pull off the deception, Michael goes home and alters her bikini bottoms to make it look like a pair of boy's speedo, complete with an ingenious little prosthetic for added measure!  At the lake, one of the more aggressive boys challenges Michael to a wrestling match.  Taller and more athletic, Michael wins by knocking the other boy into the water.  Again, she passes the test.  In a pair of speedos, Michael looked like a tall, athletic boy.  If you do not suspect it initially, then you would probably also be deceived.  She looks a little too pretty to be a boy, and there is just the second Tanner stage of a breast bud coming out.  But even so, I can see how the deception would work.

Eventually, her deception is compromised.  Her mother, understandably furious, forces her to confess to one of the mothers.  Rumor got around the playground.  The other boys take Michael to the woods, intending to pull her pants down.  It was at this point that it became hard for me to watch, dreading the potential humiliation for the main character.  In any case, I will stop here and not spoil it for you.

This is not a high-stakes movie plot in which the main character is out to save millions of lives.  Where failure could mean the destruction of all civilized life on the planet.  Let's be real.  This is a movie about a little girl passing off as a boy.  In the bigger scheme of things, it is nothing.  Nevertheless, the fear that you have, the empathy that you have, for the character will keep you on the edge of your seat.

The main character was played by Zoe Heran.  Terrific young actress.  And she is young enough to have the kind of athletic body that made it possible to pass for a boy.  At the start of the movie, even the viewer is not quite so sure of her gender.  It was not until a bathroom scene when she proceeds to step out of the bath tub that her gender was confirmed.  By then, she had already started the deception and was passing herself off as ""Michael"".

This is a highly recommended movie.",1395187200,3,3916,4.469589816124469

4713378,5,B005JZ90M0,"This sweet, affectionate film follows a young girl, Laure, in the last year before womanhood starts to set in - the last year when she could have been taken for a boy. It follows her through that experience, living as Mickael among the boys, playing, swimming, and leading a child's life surprising in its normality.

At least, that's her life away from her family, living for the moment in a summer you want never to end. But it does end, when Laure's barely-there femininity is exposed. I almost sank into my seat, squirming at the humiliation she must have felt. This movie creates a uniquely sympathetic environment, leaving many questions open to thought - why should there be that gender divide, among children too young for puberty? Why shouldn't a child lead whatever life [s]he wants, if it's happy and harmless? Seeing her crushed into the girly mold that she fit so poorly was one of the saddest moments in movie history.

There's only so much an adult can to in encouraging a child to explore - [s]he will hit limits set by the peer group sooner or later, and grownups have little control over children's own society. Still, this movie makes me want to support whatever healthy interests I can in the children I know, since the boy/girl dichotomy is largely artificial, often arbitrary, and potentially harmful .to a child's sense of self.

4713379,4,B005JZ90M0,"I was recently browsing the foreign movie section of my local library and stumbled upon this. I took a quick look at the DVD jacket and decided to take a chance on this. Glad I did!

""Tomboy"" (2011 release from France; 82 min.) brings the story of Laure (played by Zoe Heran), a 10 yr. old girl with boyish looks. When Laure's family moves into a new neighborhood, she is mistaken for a boy by Lisa another kids living on her block, and Laure introduces herself as Mikael to Lisa (played by Jeanne Disson). Laure's decision is never outright explained, so you can do a lot of speculating on that, and also whether she fully comprehends or foresees the consequences of that decision. Laure/Mikael gets to know the other kids in the area and blends in well, to the point where it becomes clear that Lisa is having a crush on Mikael. As the summer progresses, Laure becomes more and more creative in keeping up her hidden identity from the other kids. Will the other kids find out who Mikael really is? What about the budding friendshio between Lisa and Mikael? To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is one gutsy performance from Zoe Heran (and can you imagine how her parents must've agonized whether to let their daughter even play this role). I can't help but feel that writer-director Celine Sciamma was extremely helpful and essential in guiding the Herans through this process. Apart from Zoe Heran, the other child performers (and there's a bunch of them) are also top notch (check out Laure's younger sister, for example). This is a short movie (not even a hour and 20 min. if you don't count the end credits), and this rushed by in no time. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that is GALAXIES away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Tomboy"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1369267200,2,1944,4.599423631123919
4713380,5,B005JZ90M0,"When 10-year-old Laure (Zoe Heran), moves with her family to a house in the French suburbs, the other kids mistake her for a boy. Taking advantage of this mistake, Laure introduces herself to the neighbourhood kids as Mikhael, creating a new and exciting identity for herself.

Eventually, her younger sister Jeanne (Malonn Levana) discovers the deception but keeps her secret so she can tag along with Laure and her friends. When romance blooms between Mikhael and friend Lisa (Jeanne Disson), things become complicated. With the school year fast approaching, Laure's long days of summer fun are drawing to an end and her true identity threatens to be exposed.

Out writer-director, Celine Sciamma (Water Lilies) looks at gender and identity through the eyes of a young girl in this thought-provoking coming of age story.

Zoe Heran portrays Laure/Mikhael incredibly well as she steers through a labyrinth of challenges in an effort to be herself. Malonn Levana stands out as Laure's loveably inquisitive younger sister Jeanne.

4713383,5,B005JZ90M0,"I debated with myself for months before buying this film, but I love the film 'Ma Vie En Rose', about a little boy who wants to be a little girl, so I was curious to see how the story of a little girl who wants to be a little boy might be handled. I suppose therefore, maybe I bought this film as an academic companion piece to 'Ma Vie En Rose'.

In either case, the scenario had to be handled sensitively and proficiently by the actors and directors concerned, to avoid their efforts descending into puerile comedic farce. Fortunately, in both cases, this has not happened.

Celine Sciamma's debut as a Director, 'Water Lilies'', was an almost claustrophobically tense dance of adolescent first love, lust, and friendship. This piece, however, retains the freedom and breathtaking joyousness of childhood, without seeking to mask the truth for the sake of an adult's eyes.

Zoe Heran is perfectly cast as Laure, the ten year old girl who slips into the persona of Michael without a backward glance when she and her family move to a new neighbourhood. She is to be commended for her bravery in taking on this role, as it cannot be easy for a child to be told that they would do well playing the opposite sex. Casting Zoe Heran's real life friends in the film was a masterstroke, as their presence on screen gives the film a fly-on-the-wall feel that just helps to extend the naturally joyous feel of childhood to the viewer.

Inevitably, any serious film collector or fan thinking of buying this film may seek comparisons between Laure and characters such as Saga (Melinda Kinnaman) in 'My Life As A Dog. Don't. This film is very much in the neo-realist tradition of modern european cinema and, as such, the situation in which Laure finds herself is very naturalistic.

I've read other reviews and am wondering if others have missed a point. I don't think, and it isn't the impression I got from the film, that she was struggling with her sexuality; I think she just though boys had more fun and got more freedom. She found herself trapped with events as they moved on, and was having to continually develop her ruse.

For me it highlighted the fact that at least some of what is considered boyish, or girlish, is not genetic but purely what others feel one should do. What one should be.

I do think her mother was unusually cruel, in the way she resolved the situation; it did need something doing, however.

I was particularly disappointed the reason she was fighting wasn't explained: the other boy injured her younger sister - she even tended her wounds; this should have been brought up. It would have been more believable imo. This was the only jarring aspect of the whole film.

4713392,4,B005JZ90M0,"I thought this was an incredibly beautiful film for the first hour or so. It was touching to see children talking, playing and generally interacting like children, and it was refreshing to see a movie that (1) portrayed its narrative through a child's eyes, centering the voice of a child, and (2) centered the perspective of a gender variant person, not their family, friends, or the larger society in which they live. (There are hardly enough movies filmed in ways that center the perspective of gender variant adults, let alone children.)

MY USE OF LANGUAGE: I will be using masculine pronouns throughout the review to reference the protagonist, Mikael, despite the fact that the very name of the film ""Tomboy"" *by definition* highlights that his lived experience (masculine in presentation and behavior) contests his physical embodiment and the fact that he was assigned female at birth and the legal name Laure. I will use masculine pronouns despite the fact that the word ""tomboy"" *by definition* tells us the story will be about a *girl* who simply finds comfort in masculine play; and I will do this intentionally because it seems that the gender variance of this child goes beyond the usual definition of ""tomboy"" (i.e., most tomboys don't find it important to live *as boys*). I will say, however, that the film appears to fall in line with the (mainstream) narrative that a gender variant childhood is something that can be reasonably expected to be forgone in adolescence (in favor of a more 'appropriate' gender identity and/or presentation; a position I don't necessarily agree with).

THE PLOT, IN SUMMARY (with spoilers): A ten-year-old child known throughout the film both as Mikael (his chosen name) and Laure (his assigned/ legal/ birth name) is followed throughout a summer, after relocating to a new town. For the first hour of the film (almost exactly), we see Mikael make friends and play with them, interact with his six-year-old sister Jeanne regularly and in some incredibly beautiful ways, and have a reciprocated innocent romance with a girl his age, Lisa. (His sister's acceptance of him as Mikael around 55-56 minutes in is a particularly touching moment.) We also see him interact with his father, and we notice that the mother is pregnant and see her give birth -- all these things are generally neutral or positive. However, the film takes a spin (and a frustrating one, in my personal opinion) when the mother finds out that her child [that she appears to assume is a tomboy (someone who still identifies as a girl)] is living a life in which friends regard [her] as a boy: she responds by (1) slapping him, (2) forcing him to wear a dress, and (3) coercing him into outing himself as a girl to both the boy he got in a fight with and the girl he was romantically involved with. She said to him: ""We need to tell. I am not doing this to hurt you or teach you a lesson. I have to, understand? I don't mind you playing 'the boy'. It doesn't even make me sad. But this can't go on."" (This reads to me like ""It's okay if you're a lesbian or tomboy as long as you aren't keeping any secrets and everyone knows you're a girl."" Which is super problematic on several levels that I could go into in the comments section if anyone cares.) Then she asked him if he had a better solution. Maybe he, at ten, doesn't have a better solution that he can verbalize, but I hope viewers understand that his mother's response to finding out was NOT appropriate. Outing him as ""a girl"" to his friends caused them to ridicule him, and even (for a short while) turn his ""girlfriend"" against him (despite her initial protest).

That's basically the movie.

I don't want to make this review any longer than it already is, so I will put out there again that I am open to discussing further both (1) why the mother's reaction was problematic, and (2) why the ending was disappointing. In short, the mother's response was: damaging to his autonomy and personhood, emotionally abusive, and something that could have compromised his safety.  None of that is okay.  We have to stop perpetuating the myth that going by a name or gender that wasn't legally assigned to you is a 'lie' or 'secret' - even in (or especially in) film; if his truth that summer was that he was Mikael, a newly-relocated ten-year-old boy, then that's his truth, his reality; there is no other truth. And his mother shouldn't fight his right to self-determination. (Boundaries, anyone?)

Other reviewers have commented on the lack of communication between family members throughout the film, but that isn't necessarily true- his relationship with his sister and his father were both portrayed in positive ways. And gender variance isn't easy to talk about with family because parents have gendered expectations for their children which cause a lot of shame, guilt, and fear in the gender-variant child. Some perspective to consider while watching the film.

I think that's all.

(Oh. And I'm personally tired of films that portray so many of the 'negative' aspects of being gender-variant into them; it's really not all that new/creative or radical/subversive. But I'd still give it a 4.5 because the acting was just fantastic and the cinematography was just great.)",1342828800,3,5244,4.811320754716981

4713396,5,B005JZ90M0,"Childhood is such a tricky time in one's life.  You are bombarded with feelings you don't wholly understand and these feelings can grow into something that haunts you as an adult.  What should otherwise be a carefree and joyous time in one's life can become an internalized nightmare for those unable or unwilling to explore their own emotional complexities; and what child is up for that task?  I am still grappling with elements of my own childhood, moments in time that confuse me still, and I'm nearly thirty years of age.  While watching a film like `Tomboy' I'm literally reduced to tears because I see so much of me and so much of my own confused childhood that I can only wish for something easier for my own children.

And yet, does easy really sculpt an adult?

`Tomboy' tells the story of ten-year-old Laure.  Laure, while female, choses to identify as a male.  She dresses like a boy, walks like a boy, acts like a boy.  She even sits like a boy.  Because of this, she is mistaken by a neighbor girl named Lisa FOR a boy.  Instead of correcting her, Laure tells her that her name is Mikael and from that moment forward she does everything she can to keep up the faade, not for one second assuming the consequence of being found out once school starts.  Instead, she spends her summer days playing ball with the neighborhood boys and forming a crush (that is reciprocated) on Lisa.  The two bond rather quickly, but there is just no avoiding the inevitable.

I'm yelling SPOILERS because I honestly cannot review this without some.

With painstaking subtlety and beauty, Celine Sciamma tackles a very delicate yet weighty subject and delivers one of the finest films of this new decade.  Some have criticized the way in which the interaction with Laure's parents is depicted and yet it truly helps build what is so important to the nature of this film, and that is the child's perspective.  This is a story told through the eyes of a child.  Even something as serious as gender confusion is depicted in a way that is most accessible to the child.  Laure doesn't ever come off as ashamed but instead she is readily comfortable in her own skin.  Even at home, despite refusing to admit to her parents who she wants to be, she doesn't shy away from being herself.  Her parents know she identifies with the `male role' and they accept her for that.  When Laure's mother finds out what she is doing though, the way she is lying to the neighborhood kids, she is upset.  This scene in particular I found brilliantly depicted because it captures all the fear that Laure had and the reason she was so afraid for her parents to really `know' and yet it also captured the panic in the mother's eyes as she tried desperately to understand a way to fix it.  She loves her daughter but she is afraid for her future, and this is shown beautifully without taking too much away from the film's primary focus; Laure.

I also wanted to mention the film's conclusion and the smile that has been mentioned.  One reviewer mentioned that it took away from the film and yet I found it the perfect end point because it did two very important things.  First, it kept in tone with the nature of the film.  Children, unlike adults, very easily forgive, forget, accept and move on.  It isn't until you reach puberty and you start to become a terrible person do you forget how to do that (I say that with intended sarcasm).  So, in keeping with the idea of depicting such a serious subject through the eyes of a child, it is only fitting that Lisa forgive Laure her lie an accept her for who she is.  In asking for her name, Lisa is essentially telling Laure that she doesn't have to hide anymore.  Sure, Laure may want to be a boy and identify and or be referred to in that context, but it is quite unrealistic to expect that be the case entirely at such a young age.  She is getting ready to attend school and it will be nearly impossible for her to keep up such a lie.  Then there is the smile, which closes out the film.  For me, this was such a beautiful way to show that Laure too understands that her life and her decision, while obviously difficult, is going to be okay.  She knows that life moves on and she can get through this.  This does not denote that she knows she has to change and that the phase (as some have called it) is going to be over now that she's been found out.  Instead, this denotes the very idea that Laure understands she doesn't have to hide and that her life may not be as difficult as she imagined it would be.

The entire cast is fantastic, but really this film would have been nothing without Celine Sciamma's delicate direction and Zoe Heran's powerful performance.  The way that Heran captures the very essence of this young girl/boy is flawless and the way she builds such a tremendous atmosphere around her (the jovialness and even the emotional fear) is just unforgettable.

I will, like a fellow reviewer, mention that this does contain underage nudity and it was a scene that took me back.  I saw it coming, as a way to `reveal' the truth about Laure, and so I kind of prepared myself for it a few seconds before it actually happened, but it was a scene that I felt could really shake some viewers.  While not perverted or pornographic in any way, being the father of two young girls I found it slightly unnecessary despite being a powerful moment in the film.

Some have likened this to `Boys Don't Cry'.  I resoundingly agree with that assessment.  The film is every bit as powerful as Kimberly Peirce's debut without mimicking (although the `show us' scene towards the end was obviously taken from that film) and thus creating its own entity.

4713399,4,B005JZ90M0,"To start off i saw this film last october at the Chicago International Film Festival and am excited for its release after all this time. with that being said this film has some tremendous high points throghout, but the ending left me extremely dissapointed.

for the description of the movie i believe the other reviews cover that very well, what i want to focus on is the ending specifically. When Laura is found out by her young male friends and more importantly her mom about her tomboyish (really, it should be called transgender, or gender identity, for her case of ""tomboy"" went a lot further than playing soccer with the guys) ways, her friends act as any boys that age would, by acting out and irrational, and extremely aggressive, abusive. The scenes with the young boys was very heartbreaking and almost moved me to tears, it is a very emotional sequence of scenes. the mother on the other hand, and where the film steers its message is very damaging, and dangerous especially in todays era. The mother is completely embarrassed by her daughters actions and takes her around the neighborhood and forces her to come clean to her closest friends and her love/like interest. it is a very grueling sequence of scenes, and the shouting and abuse she puts her daughter through to get rid of her ""tomboyish"" ways is plain unacceptable, however in this film apparently it is ok to humiliate, shout, and control your children in a fearful manner. what made this worse was that after all of the humiliation from the mother, her male friends, and sexual humiliation, laura suddenly decides she will be a girl now. what makes this idea absurd for the movie is at one point when with her little sister laura adamantly tells her not to tell mom, she WANTS to be a boy, to identify as a boy and loves it! this is not some ""phase"" in her life, she seems extremely determined going forward with her actions/thoughts as identifying male.

what the ending message is telling the audience, ""tomboys"" gender crossing children out there is that all of this is a phase and once you are found out you will be subject to humiliation and abuse but its ok! because in the end you will smile and be normal again. I was really pissed off by this ending because it taints an otherwise BEAUTIFUL film! please note i am giving it 4 stars for the first 4/5's of the film. the way the director develops characters, scenes, relationships, analysis of body, attention to detail is amazing and truly a piece of real cinematic art. however in the end the directors theme, focus on the film is truly a disturbing message. if the director wanted Laura to identify as female in the end and give up her ""tomboyish"" ways there was a better route, and message to be had than what was delivered. A film i compare with ""Ma Vie en Rose"" the rose film which was ahead of its time handles this topic of gender roles and gender identification much better than this film.

Also remember this is a french film, there is a scene of laura completely naked getting out of the bathtub, obviously way underage and when i saw it in the theatre i was caught off guard. i do not mind nudity, however i would definitely like to know before watching something if there wild be child nudity. it is not pornographic in any way, but if you plan to watch it with a family or friends, or children, please just be aware.",1337990400,13,3362,4.553719008264463
4713400,4,B005JZ90M0,"There have been countless coming of age movies made in countless different ways and approaches, but ""Tomboy"" is quite the unique achievement.  Directed by Celine Sciamma of the previously reviewed ""Water Lilies"", ""Tomboy"" is a heartfelt look at a 10 year old girl's summer as a boy.

Laure is at that stage in her life were she looks rather androgynous, her hair is short, she wears gender neutral clothes and is trying to figure out who she is.  Her and her family have just moved to a new town and she is searching for a place to belong.  She meets Lisa, a neighbor girl about her age, and after a moment introduces herself as Michael.  Michael then meets up with a group of other neighborhood kids who also accept her as a boy.

Laure's family life is quite loving and supportive.  Her mother is pregnant with her third, while her father holds down a good job.  She is also best friends with her 6 year old sister.  So why does she feel the need to have people thinks she is a boy?

Michael keeps pushing the boundaries of how far she can go as a boy and there are a few moments of embarrassment along the way. He/she develops a pretty close relationship with Lisa and you start to wonder if she knows who he/she really is.  Laure's life as a boy is kept a tight secret from her parents, but when her sister finds out, she helps keep the secret and they have a fun time with it.  Michael/Laure is very protective of her little sister so when one the kids in the group is mean to her, she takes offense and fights the kid, and wins.  This prompts the kids mother to visit Laure's mother and her secret is spilled.  Determined to set things straight Laure's mother puts a dress on her and brings her to the boys house and then to Lisa's to show them she who she really is.  The mother is not angry that Laure is acting and dressing like a boy, but that she has been lying to everybody around her about who she really is.  Laure is also, remember, 10 years old and is acting in the moment.  Will she be like this when she is 15? 20? 30?  I would think this is probably just a phase, but the film doesn't give any direct answers.  It's just a short glimpse into the life of a girl and her family.

The realism and acting in this film is nothing short of extraordinary.  It is not overly dramatized and melodramatic, but through that acting, the characters, and the simplistic story there is something to it that makes it feel so authentic.  Zo Haren is the young actress who plays Laure/Michael and is the driving force behind its success.  ""Tomboy"" is a good ""discussion"" movie.  Does it have ulterior motives?  Why does Laure pretend to be a boy? and many other things could be asked of it.

Not to say that there aren't films out there that don't do this, it's just that the consequences Mikael/Laure has to deal with are more true to form then say... your average sugar-coated John Hughes movie and at such a young age. I won't go too much into detail, as I do not want to spoil the movie. I will say that I have seen other films by C&eacute;line Sciamma and this one does not disappoint. The main actresses of this movie are very talented and convey a naturalness in their scenes that is amazing to watch. How refreshng to watch kids actually behaving as kids without it seeming contrived. This is a good movie that does not disappoint!",1335744000,6,819,4.466666666666667
4713402,5,B005JZ90M0,"TOMBOY is a rare gem of a film. Writer/Director C&eacute;line Sciamma has created a story that is as genuinely tender about a subject that is becoming more discussed - transgender journeys - that in addition to being a film of brilliance it also demonstrates that in many ways, children deal with variations of normal better than adults. Sciamma presents this fact in such a subtle manner that it is only in retrospect that the impact of the film is comprehended.

A very loving family - the pregnant mother (Sophie Cattani), the tender father (Mathieu Demy), and two daughters - have just moved into a new neighborhood during the summer months.  The younger daughter Jeanne (Malonn L&eacute;vana) is full of joy and creativity and is devoted to her older sister Laure (Zo&eacute; H&eacute;ran - an extraordinary young actress).  Laure dresses as a boy and going out to meet the new neighbors changes names to Michal.  Though shy and obviously fearful of how the others will perceive, Michal is for all intents and purposes a boy.  He joins in games with the other boys, meets a young girl Lisa (Jeanne Disson) who obviously is infatuated with Michal, and retaining `his' nature as a boy he enhances his swimsuit with a creation of clay so that he will appear male to all. Lisa visits Michal but only Jeanne is home and when Lisa asks for Michal, Jeanne intuitively covers for Michal.  Jeanne thus wins Michal's trust and is allowed to accompany him when he goes out to play with his new friends. Jeanne is happy to be a part of Michal's secret. But when a fight occurs as Michal struggles with Rayan (Rayan Boubekri) in defense of Lisa, Rayan's mother confronts Michal's mother and Michal's secret is out.  With cruel lack of insight the mother makes Michal wear dresses now and it is this act that destroys Michal's new identity and the problems that follow are best resolved among the children.

The beauty of the film is that it is almost entirely concerned with the interaction of children: the adults have only momentary roles. C&eacute;line Sciamma appears to be saying that most children pass through stages of gender questions. She is not championing transgender roles, she is merely offering us a very sensitively drawn picture of how confusing moving form childhood to adulthood can be. Zo&eacute; H&eacute;ran's performance is stunning as his the performance of her `little sister' Malonn L&eacute;vana.  Young actor Mathieu Demy (son of director Agn&egrave;s Varda and Jacques Demy) is a true discovery.  But the film's genius is C&eacute;line Sciamma. We will be hearing more bout this gifted artist.

8476132,1,B005JZ90M0,"This film was beautifully done in its moments of innocence, naivety, and the relationship between Mikael and his sister. However, I went into this film expecting a wistful commentary on the struggles of finding one's gender identity at a young age, and was severely disappointed with the message it left behind. Even if Mikael was only ""pretending to be a boy"" in order to fit in with the neighbor kids, he showed a lot of signs of a child coming to the realization that they might identify with a gender different than the one they were assigned at birth. The message that I was left with was that any gender expression different from that assigned at birth should not only be punished, but completely obliterated. The scenes where the mother parades her son around to all of his new friends is so hard to watch, as she doesn't take into account the emotional damage that it is doing to her child. Everything gets a ""happy ending"" when Mikael introduces himself to Lisa as ""Laure"" at the end of the film, and it cuts to the credits. I see this film as having the message of ""go along with your assigned gender, it'll be easier for everyone involved"" all the while it completely erases the mental damage from Mikael's public emasculation among his peers at a fragile age. Overall, I'm very disappointed with the way that this film progressed and ended - the producers, writers, and directors had a phenomenal chance to make a really compelling film about adolescent gender fluidity that could've made waves for children yearning for acceptance from the world or for parents looking for guidance on raising a child who is discovering a gender identity different from the one they were assigned, but instead, sent the conversation back to square one.",1519171200,,1748,4.753289473684211

8476135,5,B005JZ90M0,"I bought this because I've grown tired of Hollywood's all-action idiot-plot movies and I've searched for the Top Hit foreign films.  My only wish is that the producer would've invested a bit more money and offer an English-voice-over version (I knew it was subtitled.).  My ""Tomboy"" granddaughter is a bit too young to keep up with the subtitles, but her sister reads them to her.  They were a bit surprised to see the foreign acceptance of how much skin is shown (e.g., a bathtub scene--very relevant to the story) and realize little girls don't necessarily have to wear shirts all the time--an American sexist bigotry.  But they liked the story.  The ending disappointed them, but that's the way life is sometimes.
  The purpose of the bathtub scene was to ""surprisingly"" reveal that the main character was actually a girl.  BUT with a name like ""Tomboy,"" that was already given away.  If people don't know the meaning of the word, the surprise and earlier scenes would've been more relevant.",1495238400,,994,4.869047619047619

8476138,5,B005JZ90M0,"I love this French film! It is really great and simple. It is about a French family with two daughters, Laure and Jeanne who just moved to a new address outside of Paris, France during summer. One day Laure who has a tomboy haircut and dresses like a boy meets a nice girI neighbor named, Lisa. From the way Laure looks Lisa thinks that she is a boy and Lisa starts to become smitten with her. As the summer goes on, Laure and Lisa start to form a more serious relationship as boyfriend and girlfriend and it even gets to the point where Laure tells her younger sister Jeanne about what she is doing and they keep it a secret from their parents. One afternoon, one of the boy's in the neighborhood hits Laure's younger sister, Jeanne and she hurts her knee. Laure hears about what happened and fights with the boy who hurt Jeanne. After the fight, the boy's mother goes to Laure's house to get her in trouble and when the boy's mother tells Laure's mother about the incident she asks Laure why she would pretend to be a boy and slaps her and tells her to go to her room. The next day, Laure is forced to wear a blue dress, go apologize to the boy and to tell Lisa her true identity. When Lisa finds out, she is so shocked that she rushes to her room without a word. Laure then runs into the woods and takes off the dress and puts on a tee-shirt instead. When Lisa tells the other children, they tell her to ""check"" Laure to see if she really is a girl. Lisa then ""checks"" and when she conforms that Laure is a girl, they go and they leave her to cry alone. A few days later when Laure is outside eating she sees Lisa beside a nearby tree. When she comes down, Lisa asks her what her real name is and she says that her real name is indeed Laure not Mikael (Laure's made up boy name). At the end we see Laure give off a little smile that shows the audience that Lisa and her may just be friends.
Rating: Unrated. If I were to rate the movie I would give it a PG rating just for some brief nudity. Language: French with English Subs.",1477612800,3,2030,4.141772151898734
