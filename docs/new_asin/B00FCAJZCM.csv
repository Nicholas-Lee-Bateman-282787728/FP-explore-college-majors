5975240,5,B00FCAJZCM,"I was lucky to see this film at the FREAK SHOW FILM FESTIVAL in Orlando. It is rare for a film to have you covering your eyes one minute and burst out laughing the next. The cast are honest and gripping, taking you right in on their journey. The plot is so original. I won't spoil it, but i'm shocked this hasn't been done before. Even though I know this film was made for less than $1000, I would never have been able to tell. LOVE THIS FILM!",1390348800,,443,4.045454545454546
5975241,3,B00FCAJZCM,"From lrish writer/Director George Clarke comes a fast moving little comedy/horror SPLASH AREA. Filmed in Northern Ireland It was made on a shoestring budget but still managed to win two awards at the Freak show film festival in Florida (Jury prize and best special effects) What is lacks in plot (and there are a few plot holes)it makes up for in gore and enthusiasm. The young (and older cast} drive the action along from one gore set piece to the next with aplomb. Great cinematography and performances. On a personal note l was involved in the production, as part of the team in the special make-up effects and also have a small part. l found the experience thoroughly enjoyable. So what if the protagonists methods and reasons for revenge are a bit suspect, thats not the reason you watch or buy this sort of movie, be honest you buy it for the gore. As a horror/comedy/gore romp its as good (if not better) than any big budget movie Hollywood has to offer.",1390262400,,961,4.593023255813954

Only this time the teens are stupider than usual and the killers are a group of clowns who seem to be killing for no reason whatever.  Usually a film like this will have some comedic moments or some jump out of your seat thrills, sadly this film is void of both.",1416182400,,308,4.293103448275862

5975248,1,B00FCAJZCM,"SA for short starts out with a touch of UK humor and sprinkles some more in here and there throughout the movie with so...so results.
The story follows a group of teens on Halloween night as they fight to try and stay alive while being chased by four madmen dressed as clowns.. It also has a sub story that is about a guy babysitting two young kids who is trying to entertain them with a scary story. The movie bounces back and forth between the two for the entire movie.
Now you have the setup for the most part without giving it all away.
The movie got very old fast as all that goes on is the above mention, much like a dog chasing its tail and going nowhere fast and loosing all its entertainment value.
There are sexual overtones, but no nudity and lots of cursing including the f...word.
Not much to this VERY low budget indie flick -2 stars",1414886400,2,847,4.267080745341615

5975250,1,B00FCAJZCM,"Full disclosure, I only got about ten minutes in before I had to bail. This ""movie"" is shot on video garbage about a group of juggalos throwing fake blood on people, er... I mean murdering people on Halloween. This barely qualifies as a movie and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for charging people money to see it. Amazon desperately needs some quality control and they need to weed out these poor quality, shot on video backyard productions.",1414540800,4,450,4.782051282051282
5975251,5,B00FCAJZCM,"It's Halloween and the inappropriate linguistic stylings of Uncle Tom have come to babysit, and also tell his niece and nephew the story of Splash Area.  On the carnivalesque streets of October 31st in Belfast a gaggle of killer clowns have escaped from a local asylum and are blending & bleeding their way through the crowds of revellers in the port city.  When a group of friends (led by Anthony Boyle - Onus) are attacked they decide to fight back giving Fast City it's second river...a river of blood.

It's very rare that we declare our love or hate of a film at the top of a review but Splash Area demands that we do so.  Clarke's movie treads on the dangerous foundations of the great horrors that are stories within stories.  It works perfectly.  It feels like an Exploitation movie from the Philippines, it echoes connotative resemblances to Troll 2 (one of my favourite films ever) and it does it in such a way that is hilarious and horrific in equal measures.  Sometimes a movie comes along that for one reason or another just gets everything right.  Splash Area is the first Northern Irish movie to do that.

Anthony Boyle (Mike) gives a great performance in the lead.  He's a young lead but he carries the film with a confidence that lights up the screen and prevents any possible distraction from the events Clarke has mapped out to enjoy.  He's helped along the way by a returning cast of Yellow Fever faithfuls that provide suspense, horror and comedy to the overall narrative.  Robert Render (The Last Light) as down-beaten Office Walker is excellent.  Again he's undergone a transformation, not just in his appearance but in how he presents himself on screen.  He's amazing.  Add to that Alan Crawford (Battle of the Bone, The Knackery), Gary Whelan (The Knackery) and newcomers Leanne Marks & Ruby Campbell and you've got the nucleus for something special.  There's a fantastic chemistry on screen between all the cast.  It's not just a well oiled machine but a closely knit family and it shows on screen.

The cinematography is outstanding.  Clarke's sensibilities are such that no two films are ever the same, it's the sign of a great director and director of photography and it gives Splash Area an aura of originality that allows for anything to happen.  Similarly the scoring of the film is great, but there's so many great little moments.  One in particular when Uncle Tom is reading the story, ""doing"" the voices himself before they blend into the on screen narrative featuring the characters.  It's a tiny thing.  It's almost not worth mentioning if it wasn't for the fact that it sums up everything.  It's that meticulous attention to detail that makes all the difference.

There's nothing in Splash Area I'd want to see differently, there's nothing to change, there's nothing to complain about.  It's Troll 2 crossed with Halloween with a dash of IT multiplied by Tod Browning's Freaks and a perfect modern day Exploitation experience.  Splash Area is nothing short of exceptional.  I can't remember the last time I had so much fun, that was legal and lasted 85 minutes.  I can count on one hand the number of movies I've finished that have made me want to start watching it immediately after the credits, but now I have one fewer fingers.  A fantastic mix of splattered blood and oil based make-up.",1395878400,,3328,4.7574171029668415
8614374,1,B00FCAJZCM,"Wow, this was like teens in Halloween costumes, the extent of their budget and a bunch of locals running around the neighborhood and trying to make something of it, can't think of any other way to put it.

8614382,5,B00FCAJZCM,"As if one masked killer stalking teens on Halloween night isn't bad enough, imagine if the streets were crawling with completely psychotic killers. Oh. And those psychos were dressed as clowns.

But heres the twist. A guy and two girls, all dressed for a Halloween party, witness some seriously grisly slaughters on the streets. At first, they flee from the cackling clowns, but with the bodies piling up quickly and the clowns on their tail, they decide to fight back.

Splash Area: Night of the Freaks is straight-up grindhouse insanity. If you are hoping for a tidy little Halloween clown slasher, you will probably dump all over this flick. But if you like Halloween horror that treats you with some new tricks, this is one to check out. Gritty and gross, the movie is a rollercoaster ride as the kids end up pretty much trapped in the clowns lair.

Theres plenty of dark atmosphere, trippy sequences, tension, gore, and humor. And despite a bit of slowdown in the center of the film, things pick up during the final third of the film with some wild physical fight scenes and a splatterfest reminiscent of indies like Dead Alive.

The only major extraneous portion of Splash Area: Night of the Freaks is the wrap around. The movie is actually being told by an uncle to his nephew and niece on Halloween night, so clips of him narrating to them are occasionally interspersed throughout the movie. While this approach provides an opening sex/kill scene that sets the over-the-top tone, its a pretty unnecessary addition. I wouldnt mind seeing a cut of the film with those segments removed.",1424217600,2,1591,4.795620437956204
