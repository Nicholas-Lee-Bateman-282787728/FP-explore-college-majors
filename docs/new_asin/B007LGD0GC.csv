8519371,5,B007LGD0GC,"I love music videos and in particular Blu Ray .... lately I've been taking chances with groups I know little about hoping for a great concert I can enjoy on my home theater.  Europe Live at Sweden Rock was a huge surprise and great value at 2 and a half hours of excellent concert followed by a half hour of bonus features.  Sadly with super groups I grew up with like Aerosmith pulling BR concerts from a series of shows and even at that barely extending past an hour groups like Europe and Ted Nugent and now Mr Big who present 1 full show start to finish at  2 hours plus get my attention and money.
NOW to this BR concert,
I was aware of the bass player Sheehan and guitarist Gilbert by reputation but wow... this group tore it up for well past 2 hours on this extremely well filmed BR from the legendary Budokan in Japan.  The drummer I also knew from his stint with The Knack and I found the music very easy to enjoy even though I had not been familiar with them.  The musicianship is simply top notch and I can't imagine a fan of this group not just cherishing this concert. On top of it there are 3 very cool music videos and a 16 minute acoustic show!!  THIS (like the Europe and Nuge BRs) for me are the way we should be enjoying concerts on BR, with everything and the kitchen sink thrown in... not mini concerts or truncated affairs with all sorts of bonus features LEFT OFF.. excellent show, excellent musicians and excellent value for money!!!  HIGHLY Recommended",1390348800,7,1477,4.329710144927536
