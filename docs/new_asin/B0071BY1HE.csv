5047232,5,B0071BY1HE,"The images and historical footage in this movie are amazing and awe inspiring.  A well written and produced documentary of a storied Ballet Company.  Whether you have been an admirer of the Joffery Ballet Company, or you just appreciate the arts, this movie will captivate you from beginning to end.",1342051200,,299,4.96
5047233,5,B0071BY1HE,"My fellow Amazon reviewer K. Harris has already detailed the contents of this DVD so I won't repeat what he covered but I will give my personal ""take"" on this wonderful film which is now available on home video from the great documentary distribution company Docurama. (I'm a ""doc"" junkie!).

I'm a huge ""modern dance"" fan and attend at least 10 performances each year. Surprisingly the Joffrey company has not come through Philly - mainly because they were so close in New York (now based in Chicago) so I've never seen them perform live. As I watch this wonderful film, I heard the name of philanthropist Rebecca Harkness - who supported the original Joffrey company in the 1950s - and I remembered seeing the Harkness Ballet Company in NY in the late 1960s. I never knew the connection between the Harkness and Joffrey companies before, but I do now. (No, I won't share the answer here; it's a spoiler alert.)

As we find out in the film, there were actually three phases of the Joffrey and their repertoire and each was distinct. Among the firsts that the company is known for is the first all American repertoire by a NY dance company. (Even Balanchine was basing works on classic European Ballet.). They were also the first to hire Twyla Tharp (for ""Deuce Coupe"" based on the Beach Boys Music) and the first to do a psychedelic piece with a rock band in the pit. Even Prince was so impressed by the company that he allowed them to use his music royalty-free to create ""Billboards"".

As is probably obvious from the music mentioned above, this is not ""old style"" ballet but dance that moved with the times. The film includes lots of interviews with past (and a few present) Joffrey dancers as well the last interviews with Robert Joffrey's partner (in both life and dance) Gerald Arpino.

The bonuses (also described by ""K"") include the 6 minute ""Making of"" featurette, The 3-minute ""making of  Robert Altman's film `The Company'"" (basically an outtake from the Joffrey doc), a 2 1/12 minute ""outtake"" about death of one of the dancers"". The longest bonus is the 36 minute ""rehearsal footage"" from 1967 of the anti-war ballet ""The Green Table"". It is blackl and white footage from a fixed-point camera and the soundtrack does contain some static. But dance folks will be glad that it was included.

This could be one of the best documentaries on dance that I've seen and , with the company's ups and downs there is enough drama here to keep the casual viewer interested. Just as importantly, I think it will lead folks to seek out video footage of the dances that are only excerpted here.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5047234,5,B0071BY1HE,"For those interested in the history of American dance from mid 20th century to the present, this film is highly recommended. Not only are masterworks from the Joffrey Ballet highlighted here, but their performances of forgotten or little known masterworks educate the viewer who may have never seen the company. It was great hearing the backstories from the dancers who performed the works and to learn a bit about why this company endures today.",1341360000,,446,5.04054054054054
5047235,5,B0071BY1HE,"This movie is terrific on so many different levels, and is definitely NOT just for lovers of dance. There is story of Robert Joffrey himself & of his amazing foresight into his future at such a young age, and the development of the Joffrey Ballet as a company; the dancers, of all types and sizes -  this was no cookie-cutter company -and the way they charged through adversity, where others might have folded. The film footage is fantastic - extensive, thorough documentation. The testimonials add to that. The historical footage I found especially interesting - it was incredible to see that The Joffrey Ballet went to Kabul in the 1960s! The footage of Kabul was, I think, unique. This certainly was a different Kabul than we know today.
  Then there are the ballets... Joffrey's & Arpino's wonderful works, very apropos of their time. And, not to forget, the new, talented choreographers he invited to set pieces for his company; and the amazing, historic ballets he brought here, and with their original creators. Green Table & Parade, both of which I saw at City Center in NYC in the 1980s, should not be missed, or misplaced. We have Joffrey to thank for keeping those alive.
  I could go on, but will finally say that, yes, Robert Joffery was truly a Maverick of American Dance!",1340236800,13,1286,4.748878923766816
5047236,5,B0071BY1HE,"This is a marvelous in depth look at the history of the Joffrey Ballet, Robert Joffrey himself and ballet!

5047237,5,B0071BY1HE,"For those lovers of ballet who have ever been thrilled by a performance of the Joffrey Ballet, this documentary provides an opportunity, through interviews, still photos, and video footage, to learn how the company was formed and how it developed, and the drama behind the scenes!  The dancers interviewed for this film have all expressed how their own artistic development and their dedication were shaped by the artistic vision of Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino.  Truly, this film captures their maverick spirit - the determination to present as a classical ballet company and, at the same time, to be cutting-edge in choices of repertoire and styles, and the goal of bringing ballet to young people and to audiences unfamiliar with classical ballet.  The interviews provide personal memories of Joffrey and Arpino that make the viewer feel like part of the family.  You will want to own this movie, if you were ever present in a theater for the life-affirming vitality and youthful exuberance combined with the artistic integrity of the Joffrey Ballet.",1340064000,3,1057,5.127906976744186

8508184,5,B0071BY1HE,"I bought this for my daughter,  a dancer,  to introduce her to the world of the Joffrey Ballet and New York (yes, at the time Joffrey was in New York) ballet.  I is raw in parts,  but it is a passionate look at ballet during the 1960s and 70s,  before the art form was decimated by AIDS.  This is ballet when ballet was new and exciting.  I recommend it.",1359072000,,354,4.043478260869565

What we see and hear in the 82 minutes is very interesting but

the unususal history of this unusual ballet company.",1346803200,,353,4.363636363636363
