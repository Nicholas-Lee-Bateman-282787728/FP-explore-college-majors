4002603,4,B002VY24FM,This is great if you are an advanced person working out.  I like her inspiration to keep it going but often find myself not lasting very long.  It has taken me a few tries to keep up with them.  I love that you can select which part of the workout that you want to do that day with out fast forwarding that's an awesome feature I would recommend this.,1267488000,3,351,4.057971014492754
4002604,5,B002VY24FM,"There are 5 different types of workouts about half hour each, love the exercises & I like her. Also came with a booklet on diet  exercise & how to measure BMI and other useful things to track your progress.",1267315200,7,206,4.282051282051282
4002605,5,B002VY24FM,"I ordered this after trying and loving Jeanette's Kickbox Bootcamp. So glad I did! I usually do Jillian, Cathe, Jari Love, Amy Bento so I consider myself pretty fit... but I was literally dripping sweat 8 mintues into the cardio portion of this one. Jeanette is motivating, encouraging, and her moves are, dare I say, fun! I was pleased to see Terri Ann and Cat (from Exercise TV videos)as her back-up talent, they are both incredibly fit and look like they enjoy what they are doing.
Breakdown- Warmup (about 5 minutes)
Cardio Camp- 28 minutes of non stop mostly plyo moves. There is not a second of rest. Each ""cardio camp"" circuit is about 5 minutes long, you do 4 different moves on each one (at least) which you then repeat several more times in that circuit. Jacks, power jacks, jump switch lunges, wayyy too many squat thrusts, skaters, pendulums, kickboxing combos, fast feet, running, and she throws in some volleyball style moves in the last circuit. It is FAST PACED from start to finish. All three of the ladies are enthusiastic (Terri Ann never stops smiling..) throughout. And they were definitely sweating!
Chisel Camp- 25 minutes- let's just say Jeanette LOVES reverse lunges. And you will do a lot of them (the rep count seems to change from set to set, but it's anywhere from 16-25 each exercise). This is made up of 2 sections (using 10 lb. weights in the first section and 3-5 lbs. in the second) The first section is pushups to alternating side planks, lunges with bicep curls, and then it's a static chair pose with alternating step backs. After the second round of this section, my quads were screaming!! Section 2 is side lunges with an overhead reach- balancing on one leg, a version of clean and presses, plies with shoulder work, more plies on your toes, and then a tricep kickback with glute pulses. Again, you do this section twice. My heart rate stayed at 70-80% throughout this section.
Ab Camp- 9 minutes. Tall situps with weights, pulse crunches with weight, bicycles with a little variation, v-sits, and oblique crunches lying on your side. It was short, but effective, my abs were on fire.
Stretch Camp- 8 minutes. And well deserved. I felt like the upper body stretches were a little short, but the lower body is definitely appreciative of the time she takes stretching it out.

I recommend this to those at a high-intermediate to advanced fitness level. And I don't think you will be disappointed. I'm looking forward to doing more workouts with Jeanette!",1265241600,89,2492,4.755196304849885
4002606,5,B002VY24FM,"i love this dvd it is sooooo hard though so be warned not for beginners at all, its lots of fun and hard work it is a bootcamp i have only done it about four times so far and have to stop to catch my breath a few times but i prefer that tan to think oh is that its over already ? its got cardio, weights, and a small ab section then a cool down 75 minutes in full if you like a challenge you will love this",1261958400,16,406,3.5730337078651684

4002639,3,B002VY24FM,It's okay. I actually think that i'll stick with the cardio sculpt video thats on Youtube until I can order what I think will be a more challenging DVD. I like the energy of Cardio sculpt.,1478476800,,188,4.25
4002640,5,B002VY24FM,"This is a great workout DVD. I loved everything about it. Bikini Boot Camp is a very tough workout, but when I finished the workout, I felt good, powerful and felt like I had accomplished a lot after the workout. Thank you Jeanette for making such a wonderful work out DVD.",1473379200,,273,4.372549019607843
4002641,5,B002VY24FM,"One year after second baby I'm looking to get back into good shape, burn fat, gain strength, etc. and needed something that was a lot of bang for my buck...this is it!

It's intense...I can't imagine doing the whole thing straight through, without cheating and/or cutting corners, but luckily 20 minutes of mostly following along (ain't NO WAY I'm doing lunges with extra hand weight, Jeanette!) feels like a full-blown workout. It's not technical (although I feel ridiculous during the boxing routine), she's peppy and encouraging, and it leaves me feeling great. I actually wanted to fire it up on day 2 and see what the rest of cardio camp held and what the toning section looked like...

I'm excited about making this my new workout, at least 2-3 times a week. Maybe I can even work up to 30 minutes at a time...either way, it feels great to be active again.

If you need a high-intensity but quick workout (or an insane, hour-long blowout), you won't be disappointed here. Especially recommendable for moms who want to use nap time productively!

Thanks Jeanette, I'm gonna be so swoll...",1467158400,,1093,4.797872340425532

4002663,5,B002VY24FM,"I must say that I am impressed and happy with this purchase.  Jeanette Jenkins knows how to work your body from head to toe.  I already had the first Bikini Body Boot Camp and it helped me get into great shape.  I had been doing it 3 times a week so I was looking for something new.  When I saw this one I was excited and thought Id give it a try.
Whats good:  We have the same enthusiastic trainers with her Kat and Terri Anne.  And of course the amazing Jeanette Jenkins who makes working out seem like fun!
Also Jeanette is one of the few trainers that gives you a really good Cool Down/ Stretch that last longer than 3 minutes.  You get to breathe and meditate.  Namaste!
Whats better:  The clock; I love that each interval/workout is about 10 minutes long.  With the first Boot Camp Id be short on time I would need to skip the last interval move to the Cool Down.  With Boot Camp 2 I can pick and choose which ones Ill do on given day.  And I love seeing that clock count down the minutes.  Just when I feel like I have nothing left Ill see I have 2 more minutes or 30 more seconds,  and Ill tell myself to hang in there.  It feels like it's over before you know it. 
Ladies if you're in doubt, I strongly suggest that you buy this workout DVD.  Modify the moves as you need.  Pick one 10 minute segment and add on as you advance.  I guarantee you will see and feel amazing results.",1435104000,14,1388,4.074074074074074
4002664,5,B002VY24FM,"Amazing! I sweat up a storm and sleep so soundly at night when I do this workout. Her cuing is excellent, and she's not chatty nor annoying. This is perfect workout to get your cardio and toning done in one session. I agree with the other reviews, it is NOT for beginners! But if you are intermediate/advanced, give it a try, you won't regret it!",1429833600,,346,4.338461538461538

4002682,5,B002VY24FM,This DVD is definitely a workout. I run half marathons and wanted to work on strength training. This DVD does that. It makes you sweat and you'll be sore the next day. The music is pretty good and Jeanette is a likeable trainer. I would recommend this to friends.,1403740800,,263,4.387755102040816
4002683,5,B002VY24FM,"I am a personal trainer and fitness freak, I love working out at home--and my go-to DVDs are by Cathe Friedrich, but I wanted something new, and the title here interested me...who doesn't want a Bikini Body?  I was NOT expecting the workout I got, though. In fact, I did not have high hopes...the DVD looked a bit cheesy. Do not judge a book by it's cover, though, right?  I am in good shape and the cardio portion had me sweaty and breathing hard!

I don't think I will utilize the weights portion much, though, it's a bit too brief for me, I prefer heavy weights and low reps, but for anyone trying to get into shape, this is great (I would do these exercises with my clients).  The abs are challenging, though, and I loved that section.

I highly recommend this one :)",1401753600,,771,4.326388888888889
4002684,5,B002VY24FM,"I am now officially a fan of Coach Jenkins. I really enjoyed her kickboxing workout so I bought this dvd to add to my collection. I consider this video to be intermediate level. It is fast paced and incorporates a lot of cardio, some sculpt , and a dash of abs. On my first few rounds of this video I could not make it through the entire video as I was pooped out and covered in sweat. She does  various lunges so I would be weary of this video if you have knee issues. The jumping is not to intense but again all those lunges can really cause concern for anyone w/ an injury. Great video that I will keep in my rotation. In terms of calorie breakdown using my polar FT4 watch at the end of the workout (but not including cool down) I burned 505 calories. Now I was only using 3,5, 8 lb weights, where she was using 8 and 10lb weights so if you use a heavier weight I would think you can easily get into the 550 cal burn range.  My calorie burn was almost even between the cardio section vs. the strength/ab section so almost 250 cal burn exactly when broken down at the halfway point.
Cardio : you get 5 cycles each including about 4 different moves. She jumps right in so just be ready!!
Strength: she does combos of weighted moves w/ small cardio movements to help you burn more calories
Abs; not very intense at all in my opinion but good to just finish out this section so you can easily hit the  500 cal mark.

I really like JJs videos. I tend to rotate them in w/ my HIIT 90 min workouts and although these videos are shorter than my normal HIIT videos, they make me sweat just as much and for some odd reason seem to exhaust me more! ha....good stuff.",1401667200,7,1659,4.142857142857143
4002685,5,B002VY24FM,I have been doing this workout for a week now and I love it! I buy all kinds of workout dvd from insanity to the firm. I like the 75 min workout and the fact that you are constantly moving is great! This workout makes be sweat like in the first 5 min! I feel great after I finish not totally exhausted like I feel with insanity. I do love Shaun T but I think I will use Jeanette to get fit for a while!,1399420800,,402,3.7411764705882353
4002686,5,B002VY24FM,I'm intermediate-advanced exerciser and was looking for something to use when I crosstrain. This was the ticket. It's tough but not impossible. I also have knee problems so I have to be careful but all of the exercises were performed safely.,1396137600,,241,4.902439024390244

First time through, I sat down and had to drink water quite a few times. My lower body ached for three days before I was able to give it another shot. I'll have to break it up into sections because there is no way I can complete the entire dvd all at once. I am satisfied with my purchase but I need something for beginners.

I love this DVD....I just wish I could actually get through one segment without having to constantly pause...lol
This DVD is a darn good workout, but it is not EASY! Jeanette and her lovely crew make it look easy, but it
is definitely a lot of work. I'd like to think I was an avid cardio person and it it even kickin' my butt. It is definitely
a great DVD to have on hand and full of GREAT fat burning exercises to help you lose those inches. I have even
cancelled my gym membership because this is more than enough for me personally. I am already seeing results after 3 weeks but
my ultimate goal is simply to be able to finish at least the Cardio camp and Chisel camp segments without taking a break every 8 mins...lol

4002734,5,B002VY24FM,"I am a light to moderate exercise type of person. This type of workout had me sweating and panting within the first ten minutes of cardio. I would say this is definitely a good workout, but for people who are beginners or who are more into light exercise, like walking, which is my preferred type of workout. This could be a bit difficult to start out with.

Granted it's not SUPER SUPER intense for people who are used to working out at this level, but for beginner it will be difficult. I managed to get through every workout, except I hurt my ankle during the chisel camp and had to stop. But I did get through the cardio, abs and everything else.

I would say you have to be in the right mindset for this workout, I'm sure if you did it consistently and gave your all, you would most certainly get in shape...but you have to kinda work your way up to this level of intensity in this DVD.

For this Jeanette Jenkins Bikini boot camp make sure you have an 8-10 pound weight for the abs section and a yoga mat or towel and also smaller 3-5 pound hand weights for the chisel section.  Also have a bottle of water nearby.",1362700800,2,1120,4.244131455399061
4002735,5,B002VY24FM,"I started doing this workout regularly (4-5 days a week) last summer and immediately saw my body begin to change within 2 weeks. During the winter I got busy with school again so I stopped doing it as consistently and gained weight again but now Im back on the grind! Im about 5'6 165lbs. I Love it because it is very fast-paced and I feel like every single exercise really works the full body. It is a STRUGGLE to get through the whole video ( cardio and chisel) so on weekdays I do warm-up, either cardio or chisel, maybe abs (if I feel like it), and stretch camp. On weekends when I have a little more free time I do both and take a little break in between. I keep track of my progress by seeing how well I can keep up with Jeanette and the girls. I also bought her Sexy Abs dvd to substitute the ab camp in this one because I wanted to add more variety to my workout. (and because I love Kelly Rowland!)

I have tried tons of workout dvds and this by far is my absolute favorite!! Sometimes Jeanette does move through her reps a little too fast, but during those I go at the pace thats best for me focusing on my form and still feel like I achieve great results.

I really like that the moves are ""borrowed"" from different things like kickboxing, dance, and sports so it really does feel like its tailored to sculpt the body to be firm, but still feminine.

Definitely worth buying!!!",1362528000,4,1388,4.230188679245283

Its a toughie, and I confess to finding it slightly overwhelming the first few times I attempted to do the workout.  I have used Jillian Michaels dvd's for years (love her) and I also run fairly reguarly, but this JJBB dvd kicked my @$$, well it still does but I can actually complete it now.  It took me about 2.5 weeks of consistently doing the workout approx 3 times a weeks, before I could make it thru the entire dvd. The first time I fully completed it, I was exhausted!!  I started at the beginning of Jan 2013 and while eating better, and using this dvd about 3 times a weeks (also used my JM dvds & running) I have lost about 10 pounds, and have reached my goal weight.  In my opinion, this has really helped tone areas like my arms, glutes and thighs.  I will continue to use this to help reach my fitness goals, and for maintenance.

4002749,5,B002VY24FM,"Yes you read that right. I'm 150 pounds and in great shape but this workout had me sweating buckets and that was just with the warm-up and cardio section. There are two other sections, chisel camp and abs which kick butt on their own too. I have never done all three in one day but I am working my way up to it. I can easily complete all 3 sections on Jillian Michael's workout but Jeanette is another story!

I wasn't ready for the moves nor was I committed enough to get into the kick you in your BOOTY routine.  I'm in a different space and place at this point in history and I will now be adding this workout back into my life, because I love Jeanette's workout style, creative moves, and music.  I will report back on my results at a later date.

This was a great alternative to what I've been doing.  The cardio camp was great, not TOO challenging but my heart rate was up there! The killer parts were the chisel and ab camp. They were off the chain! I didn't think I was going to make it but I did the entire thing (with a few breaks in there of course). This is probably something I'll do twice a week in conjunction with my other exercises.  I wish I had gotten the kick boxing as well...maybe later.  There is a little in here though.
If you're a beginner, I recommend something else because you will probably quit.  This is a bit challenging. I've worked out with her stuff before so I knew what to expect. Best of luck to ya!",1345766400,2,817,4.08125

According to my heart rate monitor, my average HR during Bikini Bootcamp was 167 (including the warm up and ab routine) and my HR peaked at 193.  Total calorie burn:  1106.  Pretty impressive for 75 minutes.  But again, it's really hard and if you're new to exercise, I wouldn't recommend this as a starting point.  Worth every cent.",1343433600,5,583,4.627450980392157

I started out with the circuit training DVD by Jeanette Jenkins and worked it until it was too easy. Bikini Bootcamp is challenging and keeps you moving. What I like best is that the workouts are broken up into, warm-up, chisel camp, cardio camp, ab camp, and stretch camp. Each work out is short and work you hard. Sometimes I only have about 30 minutes to an hour to workout each day and just doing a chisel camp or a cardio camp gives me an intense workout in a short amount of time. If I have more time I mix it up. I have seen very fast results as far as my physique but you also have to eat healthy too and cut out the junk food.

I used to go to the gym and saw little or no results and I could not afford a trainer. I have been doing straight exercise DVD's since August and have seen better results than me going to the gym really not knowing what I was doing.

From the warm up to the end it is non-stop plyometrics and tough jumping sequences...I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make the most of a 30 minute workout.  My workouts are usually 60 to 70 minutes long but on a day when I want fierce cardio in a short amount of time- I put this in my rotation.  Her kickboxing dvd is also one of my faves in my rotation, solid moves - a slower pace but a huge calorie burner.

At least with Insanity you get a water break; however with this workout you get no break.  When I first did the video, I went in thinking I was going to do all the camps, well it did not happen.  After cardio camp I was exhausted, so I tried again the next day and it still didn't happen. I just could not continue to chisel camp.  Then I decided to do the chisel camp followed by the ab camp and it was painful, I am still hurting the second day after doing the workout.  These workouts will definitely be effective. Beginners beware this is vigorous.  I workout 5 days a week and this workout is brutal.

In regards to Jeanette, she is very pleasant and encouraging so it is hard to get mad at her.  The set is decorated like a beach which is great to look at and the music is good.

Great challenging workout and I can't wait until I will be able to do the cardio, chisel and ab camp back to back.",1320883200,2,1075,4.272277227722772

What an awesome program for people looking to change up their routine, increase their intensity level and build stamina.  Jeanette doesn't take a break, which I love, so you don't stand around waiting for her to queu up the next move.  I previously bought her kickboxing tape and am now a devoted fan.  Her demeanor, routines, talking points and even the small talk make for a great workout.  Editing is well done so there are virtually no errors and the music isn't overwhelming and doesn't drown out Jeanette.

Ms. Jenkins is an expert at cueing the moves and the moves are simplistic, yet effective.  I consider myself to be intermediate/advanced and this dvd kicks my hindparts each and every time.  I don't think that I will plateau with this dvd and that's awesome.  I've even added a small 4 lb medicine ball on some of the arm parts to really rev up my heart rate.  I am using it like an interval training dvd, I break for 45 seconds to 1 minute after each bootcamp section for water.  Ms. Jenkins' energy is great and pink positive which I love.  This was my first J. Jenkins purchase and I am super excited each day to work out with her.  This dvd is well worth the money and I am anxious to try more of her dvds.

I was looking for something as tough, if not tougher, than Jillian Michaels' Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism workout, and this is it!

Don't get me wrong, I still love Jillian, but I was out of breath and begging for a break after about 10 minutes of Jeanette's workout.

This bootcamp is a GREAT workout for those who are fairly advanced exercisers. I work out 5-6 days/week for about an hour each day, and this workout was tough for me. Definitely not for beginners!!

Beach theme a bit weird indoors but it's rather like party decor and not distracting.

However, since I am familiar with working out and trying to get fit again, I bought it anyway and I have to say it is fabulous. I have been trying a lot of videos lately and thisis my new favorite. I have already challenged myself to keep with it until I can get through it without stopping.

I could see her claim of a 600 calorie burn (for us heavier folks anyway).  (I am almost 200 lbs) I was tuckered out about 10 min into the Cardio Camp so , unfortunately, I didn't give the rest of the workout 100% and had to briefly stop a few times (my heart rate went over 170 at some points) but stuck through to the end. I could only get through the first two exercises for Ab Camp and, of course, did stretch camp- and I still burned about 440, according to my Polar heart rate monitor.

I didn't even attempt Chisel Camp so that is about 40 min of working out including the 5 minute warm up and the 8 min stretch.

I like Jeanettes style. She doesnt feel the need to take up every moment with the familiar trainer chatter, which I appreciate.

Since I already do a short am strength workout and a pm cardio I plan to split this up and of course throw in some of my other videos to keep it interesting.

The video also came with a booklet with some great nutrional information and a wonderful meal plan complete with doable, edible recipes.

Everyone has a bright, cheerful smile on their faces, despite the fact that this workout is super hard!!  I love that there are some exercises that I haven't seen before, and I especially love that in the weight lifting section, Jeannette works all parts of the body at the same time, making good use of your investment of time.  And, of course, Jeannette has a wonderful personality.  I am a medium to higher level intermediate exerciser.  This was a grueling, but fun workout, and I did have to pause it several times to catch my breath, which is just fine.  However, I almost deducted one star for this reason:  there is no modifier doing the exercise routine.  On a few occasions, Jeannette will verbally suggest a way to tone the difficulty down a bit.  However, I think it's really important to have a modifier - it gives people some motivation to build up their strength, and it's good for even advanced exercisers if they are having an off day.  So, if you're a beginner at working out, please wait and build yourself up first with more basic workouts,  before considering purchasing this one.  For everyone else, you'll either need to do this workout as is, or be knowledgeable enough to figure out your own modifications.  Saying that, I am happy that I purchased it!",1500249600,4,1424,4.644

8382634,5,B002VY24FM,"Absolutely love this DVD. It combines cardio/boxing/strength/ballet/Pilates all on one hour. Such a great, fun way to workout. Definitely recommend .",1485648000,4,149,6.142857142857143
8382635,5,B002VY24FM,"I love this workout even better than the original. There is a bit of a dread factor for me with first one even though I found it super-effective. In Boot Camp 2 Jeanette incorporates cardio, weights, toning using your body weight, and Pilates for a very well-rounded total body workout. I liked the variation of moves and the intensity is just right for me (I'm an Intermediate-Advanced exerciser). I wasn't totally drained afterward, but still felt like I was thoroughly challenged. Jeanette has a great attitude and is super-likable.",1485561600,5,535,5.022471910112359
8382636,5,B002VY24FM,"I have to agree with the other reviewers of this workout!  It really is challenging- in a good way! So far, I've done the Cardio Camp and the Ab camp.  Jeanette jumps right in and gets going on the cardio, which I appreciate.  None of the nonsensical babble like some workout instructors!  I'm pretty advanced (I do Insanity, Amy Dixon Breathless Body and Peak 10 workouts with Michelle Dozois) and wanted something new to put in the rotation.  I also own Jeanette's Cardio Kickboxing and like her style. This is a high impact workout, so if you have knee/joint issues, you may want to skip this one.  Otherwise, if you're up for a challenge, try this out!  My one wish is that the Cardio was longer, but I just do a second workout for an additional 30 minutes.
The Ab Camp was not my favorite.  I felt like some the movements were awkward which  made them more difficult, but did not feel effective.  I will likely just do the Cardio and try out the Chisel Camp",1484265600,3,962,4.4147727272727275
