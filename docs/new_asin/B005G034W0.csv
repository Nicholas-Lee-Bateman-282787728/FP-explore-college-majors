One less star because the translations are pretty bad- you can glean the meaning from what the subtitles, but it's going to take away from your experience of the film.",1442361600,,283,4.795918367346939

8470896,4,B005G034W0,"The reason I gave this 4stars is due to the subtitles, not the movie itself.  The subtitles just aren't done very well.  I'm not fluent in Japanese, but I have studied it for several years.  Between that and having read the manga I was able to extend upon the subtitles and thoroughly enjoy the movie.  Even if you don't know any Japanese don't let that stop you from watching this terrific movie.  I would however suggest reading the manga first, at least the first few volumes which contain the part of the story on which the movie is based.  I'm not sure how many volumes, but it is not all that are published.  The rest build upon the story adding to your knowledge of the story as a whole.  The movie is based on one part, but it is complete enough to make a movie of.  There is a distinct ending even in the manga.  The rest of the manga goes into the past explaining more of the history which leads up to what is in the movie.

The basic story is:  it is set in an alternate history of Edo era Japan.  In this Japan women are in power.  Even the Shogun is a woman.  Men, when they reach puberty, run a high chance of contracting a horrible disease that kills about 75%.  So men must be protected and sheltered as breeders.  As far as anyone remembers this is the way it has always been.  The Shogun being the most powerful woman in the land has a large harem of the most beautiful men.  The story revolves around a young man who enters her harem at the beginning of her reign as Shogun.

It is a compelling story with lots of palace intrigue.  There are some changes to the movie from the manga, but they are mostly to make the story even more compact and linear.  I recommend both this movie and the manga.  The first 7 volumes are available for sale here in English.  I think there are even more in Japanese.  I've read all thevEnglish volumes.  In my opinion in all but a rare few instances the book is always better because so much story has to be cut to make the movie.  This manga is no different.  It would have been better as a TV series.  But they do a great job with what they decided to use.

I really like the premise of this movie/manga.  It definately calls into question what most people think of as hard and fast gender roles.  Especially a country like Japan which is still very much bound by those ideas.

Happy viewing and reading!
