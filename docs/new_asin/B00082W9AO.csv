From 1983, it stars Ghena Dimitrova as the imperious, icy Turandot. It was filmed live at the Arena Di Verona, Italy, a large amphitheater renowned for its special repertoire of grand operas like Aida. Being in the outdoors in such a spacious locale, it is prime stage ground for operas that call for huge crowd scenes, choruses and numerous characters and lavish sets. This would be Franco Zefferelli's idea of operatic paradise. Ghena Dimitrova is in excellent voice, though it appears that the Riddle Scene with its killer tessitura causes her some strain. In the 80's, she was singing a vast repertoire of dramatic roles including Tosca, Norma, Lady Macbeth and her signature role Abigaille in Nabucco. Her voice is unbelievable and I cannot express in words the sheer magnetism of her singing. Her voice is quite possibly the largest in operatic history. Maria Callas may have had a huge voice, as did Birgit Nilsson, but Ghena Dimitrova could reach to the stratasphere with effortless bravura and could darken her voice and put meat on it. The result is electrifying. Her Turandot is a force of nature. Though she is dressed in what appears to be a demure white gown, her mannerisms, facial expressions and invective tone conveys a goddess-like majesty few sopranos have. The costumes are authentically Chinese, the set is  glorious and grand, and the soprano singing the minor role of the slave girl Liu is Cecilia Gazdia, whose pretty, lyric voice is capable of a lot juicier repertoire like Marguerite in Faust, Rossini heroines and even obscure bel canto operas which she recorded. Cecilia Gazdia's Liu is the most convincing Liu I've ever seen. She is not the dramatic/hefty Lius of other singers like Montserrat Caballe, Edda Moser, Leonie Mitchell, Renata Scotto (though Scotto was perfect in size/height for the role). The orchestra is thunderous and the quality of film is great. Fans of Ghena Dimitrova will want to get this DVD as soon as it is released.",1131753600,9,2106,4.932394366197183
