7896174,5,6305841497,My husband loves this movie. Any NASCAR or race fan should watch this. Kind of quirky but I think that's what he loves about it. It's in his top 5 favorites.,1195603200,,157,4.096774193548387
7896175,5,6305841497,"I love this movie. I watch it a least once a month. The director is Jack Hill. I didn't know him before, but love his movies now. Old car buffs cannot miss this movie. I love to call out the cars. '58 Ford. '56 Olds. '61 Plymouth. There are junk yard scenes that are priceless. The figure 8 racing really brings back childhood memories. Sid Haig is great in his part. The expression on his face in the race scenes is pure ""B"" movie. And the MUSIC. just right for the times. I think the music is by Jack Fridge. Many car celebrities of the times play themselves. The quality of the DVD is good and for some reason which I don't understand,  the real name of the movie is ""The Winner"". If you like this, also see ""Jack Nicholson"" in ""The Wild Ride"". I have been hitting ""search"" trying to find movies about old cars, but this is the best one yet.",1125187200,2,844,4.177914110429448

7896177,5,6305841497,"Greasy, cowlicked creep gets popped out of jail for street dragging by Brian Donlevy who promises him beer, women and song in demolition derby racing.
Once he gets a taste of the pennzoil and cocaine in his blood stream he stops at nothing to hustle his way to the top, leaving a trail of bloodied and broken racers and lot lizards behind him.
Sid Haig is coolest star in this film, and it's a kick to see a young Ellen Burstyn as a gear-jamming honey, too. One of Jack Hill's best.",1005868800,7,482,4.3076923076923075
