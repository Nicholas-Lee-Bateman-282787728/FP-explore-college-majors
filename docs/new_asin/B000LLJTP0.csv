8162069,4,B000LLJTP0,"No ""Andrew Preview"". No Shirley Bassey. No South Pacific. A bunch of the weaker material (not bad, just weaker). It's not the very best of by any means. But nonetheless, they are brilliant.",1269388800,2,189,4.757575757575758
8162070,4,B000LLJTP0,GREAT COMEDY TEAM. THIS IS 86 MINUTES OF PURE FUN. THIS IS ONLY A SMALL SAMPLE OF THEIR MATERIAL. THEY ARE AMONG THE BEST OF GREAT COMEDY TEAMS. FOR NOW THIS IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAL FORMAT. THE ONLY REASON I DON'T GIVE THIS A FIVE STAR RATING IS: NOT ALL THEIR BEST MATERIAL IS INCLUDED IN THIS DVD. I DO RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL YOU BRITCOM FANS AND HOPE TO FIND SEASONAL BOX SETS OF THEIR MATERIAL,1242691200,,397,4.102564102564102
