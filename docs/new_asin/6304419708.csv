It is in my mind as one of the most moving pieces of cinema I have ever seen,  with a powerful score and an evil John Malkovich character.  Nicole Kidman  was flawless in it and the final scene will never leave me.  Odd bit at the  beginning, though, with lots of young women in modern dress looking moody  and sulky and not saying much really.",926553600,,488,4.010416666666667

Nicole Kidman with her young fresh face completely devoid of makeup.  The divine costumes of rich fabrics. The beautiful gardens and scenery.  Great story.  Great acting.  Great escape from daily reality.  Great rainy day home alone kind of movie to watch so you can immerse yourself in the story.

John Malkovich is the perfect insidious bad guy - soft spoken, manipulative, & completely evil. So good at being evil you'll still hate him when the movie ends. :D",1440979200,4,703,4.889830508474576

Much better movies out there. A women mesmerizes every man she meets but will have none of them until she supposedly meets the man of her dreams who doesn't fawn over her, but realizes she is still unhappy. She finds out her cousin left her all his inheritance because he is dying and falls in love with him(because she unknowing loved him all along). UGG! Don't waste your time with this movie.

866434,1,6304419708,"I didn't care for the movie despite liking many of the actors who appeared in it. Kidman is pretty much a one-note character, and not at all convincing.

The description listed for this movie is, um, not at all what you'll see if you decide to watch it. Here's what it says at the top of the product page: ""Join Barbra Herr on an emotional journey of her life. From her beginnings as a boy in The Bronx, NY, a young man in Puerto Rico, to the lady she became in New York City. And her aspirations for the future a journey of love, life, sadness and humanity.

866438,2,6304419708,"The reviews made this look like a love it or hate it type of movie. I like Henry James, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Turns out, it is more in the ""hate it"" category than the love it. I tolerated it hoping for a peak emotional finale that never came. There were a few problems. One was the sound. The film has no subtitles, so when the voices are low and muffled, the music drowns out the dialog, or the sound of shoes across a floor overpowers the rest of the story, it creates holes in the flow.

Then there is the I-don't-care aspect of it. It's slow and boring. The faces are blank and emotionless. If the characters don't care, why should I?

Then there is the ""everybody loves Kidman"" angle. She doesn't appear particularly charming, so why would everyone be drawn to her? Especially after she gets married. That is a really big piece of the story that the casting director, or perhaps the director, got really wrong.",1429488000,,926,4.3468208092485545

866440,5,6304419708,"Jane Campion transposed one of Henry James' best novels into a formidable masterpiece.
She captured luminously the author's main themes: money and love, Puritanism, innocence and survival.

A gift of a fortune by an uncle to a young lady turns into a nightmare: money doesn't buy happiness.
She becomes the target of those who need the money for their own `standing' and the survival of their offspring (daughter).
Another main theme of Henry James is Puritanism: the rejection of the `physical' body. The innocent lady is captured through the discovery of physical contact, here, a French kiss. It overwhelms her completely and she gets entangled in a web of lies, hard plays of domination and subtle intrigues in order to keep her former admirers at bay. She stays blind for the `real' world of true affections until she is confronted with naked and shattering facts.

The performance of the cast (Nicole Kidman, John Malkovich, Barbara Hershey and others) is simply sublime. Rarely have difficult expressions in harsh and deeply pure or malignant emotional confrontations so intensely been interpreted.
A must see.",1420243200,,1117,5.165745856353591

John Malkovich is of course an indispensable asset to any film of this calibre.

this is a finely crafted period piece endowed with unassailable integrity and finesse.

The chemistry between the characters creates a potion that evokes a spectrum of human emotion that is both refined and visceral at the same time. The interaction and dialogue are powerful and subtle, at times unnerving with a restraint that threatens to unravel and unleash the ugliness of unbridled emotion.",1415923200,4,579,4.958762886597938

866540,5,6304419708,"This is an intelligently conceived and directed film. Ms. Campion begins her film about 40% of the way into the book and that is a minor problem because if the audience has not read the book they are missing some necessary background on the Isabel/Kidman character. However, I found myself holding my breath in the scenes between Malkovich and Kidman. Henry James gave us a truly evil character in Gilbert Osmond and John Malkovich gets to his core in a brilliant, understated yet intense performance.

866633,1,6304419708,"The casting of Malkovitch as Gilbert Osmond is a serious mistake, as is his resorting to physical violence towards Isabel.  Malkovitch is simply the wrong type of actor - Gilbert is, as he says ""convention itself.""  Yet the actor, as usual, looks like an unmade bed - he also wear his ""watch out I'm a psychopath"" visage used in such ""chewing the scenery"" performances as he gave in ""Con Air"" and ""In The Line of Fire"".  Gilbert is the Adrian Brody type - suave, elegant, vain.  Gilbert would never lower himself to hit Isabel - his tactics are more subtle and are untranslatable into a film.  James' works are not cinematic - he plumbs the depths of his characters - the action occurs in the character's consciousness.  The greatest chapter in the novel has Isabel ruminating about her marriage in front of a fireplace.  Also, I'm not at all certain why Campion, a one trick pony if there ever was one, decided to give Kidman a fright wig - it is certainly not in the style a 19th century woman would wear.  If you haven't read the book you may enjoy the film - though I cannot see how you would.  If you have read the book you could not enjoy the film.  Henry James must never be confused with John Grisham or Stephen King, both of whose prose is so wretched that it HAS to appear better on the screen.  This movie is a total washout.",1375401600,6,1336,4.368421052631579

I recommend this film to ANYONE who loves literature, particularly Henry James.  It's really a psychological drama with so much to think about.",1369094400,,395,4.535211267605634
866756,5,6304419708,"I haven't read Henry James' novel, but I thought that the film was absolutely beautiful no matter how faithful or unfaithful it was to the original story. Jane Campion does not disappoint: each still from the film is like a painting. Gorgeous settings and exquisite costumes. The story is pretty clear for someone who like myself is not familiar with the novel. Young, beautiful and innocent Isabel Archer does not want to get married to the first or second gentleman who proposes to her. She believes that there is more for her in life. She wants to see other choices and experience an adventure. She meets Madame Merle and gets enwrapped in her manipulations. However, I do not want to tell you the whole plot. Some reviewers complained about the acting, but again I found no fault with it. Kidman's Isabel was genuine gentle misguided creature, whose suffering I could feel while watching the film. Hershey's character from the very beginning had some malignancy about her, and Malkovich was purely evil. Donovan's character was my favorite: quiet, sensitive, intelligent and loving. So give it a chance, watch it and savor it yourself. Get lost in the beautiful painting.",1365379200,11,1175,4.9393939393939394
866757,5,6304419708,"I purchased the Henry James novel, Portrait of a Lady, several years ago and what I remember most about the book is that I could not manage to remain interested long enough to move beyond the first few chapters.  During his lifetime, Williams James criticized his younger brother's novels for, in so many words, containing too much tedious detail that only stood in the way of the plot.  I could not agree more,  However, what Director Jane Campion has done with this story is anything but tedious.  She begins with rich settings and unusual camera angles then brings the characters to life with a very convincing all-star cast.  Nicole Kidman does a fabulous portrayal of Isabel Archer, the independent-minded and impetuous young American heiress who is so intent on remaining single - if only to avoid marriage to a 'proper man of means' because it is what's 'expected' of her - that she finds herself running from the one man who, out of genuine love and concern, pursues her across an ocean while she allows herself to be swept away by the cold and cunning Gilbert Osmond, most excellently portrayed by John Malkovich.  Be sure to watch the bonus feature, 'The making of Portrait of a Lady.'",1365292800,35,1195,4.748792270531401
866758,4,6304419708,"First of all, no adaptation can ever equal the great book by Henry James.  He had a gift not only for writing about displacement but also for writing complicated women - women who strive for a better place, a better solution and a better role to fill than the limited one afforded to them by society. Isabel Archer is one of his greatest creations and I thought she was wonderfully played by Nicole Kidman. This is a difficult role and it could not have been easy for her to take it on as Isabel runs the gamut of emotions from start to finish.  She inhabits the role of Isabel - of being that woman who longs for something more, something elusive, something different.  Her co-stars provide her with the very thing she longed for, to the ultimate sad outcome.

Martin Donovan and Barbara Hershey deserve extra accolades for the believability they lent to their characterizations of Ralph Touchett and Serena Merle.  Ralph is the unacknowledged heart of the story until his sad demise and Isabel's realization of his unintended contribution to her now sad life. Merle, the consummate American sophisticate and expatriate, is peeled apart layer by layer on screen.  She manages expertly to be a mosaic of a person - a different character with every person she encounters - but she is ultimately trapped by the choices she has made.  In some ways, she is more tragic than Isabel and in other ways, she is more devious than Gilbert. The hardest roles to fill onscreen are those of the selfless (Ralph) and the complex (Merle).  Martin and Barbara were perfectly cast.

The direction by Jane Campion was a bit frazzled as she inserted certain dream sequences which I found unnecessary and bizarre.  The Isabel of Henry Jame's creation may have been headstrong, but she was never dreamy or prone to such flights of fancy. I also found the ending did a disservice to the story.  There was no hope for Casper and Isabel and she should have been shown in the context of the ending of the novel.  At the conclusion of the novel, Isabel was left with two choices - return to Osmond or rescue Pansy.  Through Ralph, she had secured a financial legacy, with his passing she had acquired the freedom to make this choice, which were offered as a result of her own choices in life.  An ending fitting for a complex tale.",1363305600,7,2305,4.631449631449631

866761,1,6304419708,"Um... you will definitely want to be skipping this version, esply if you have recently read the book. It is so poorly cast, miscast in almost every role, except the American lover, played by Morgenstern. Nicole is average, but everyone else is just not right. A worse travesty, is that Campion ends the movie at the door of the garden, and not in the rooming house the next morning, with Isabel having returning to Italy and her friend cautioning patience. Wow! How could this be?

866762,2,6304419708,"I have seen Nicole Kidman in too many superior performances to blame her (or her fellow actors) for their unfortunate attempts in Portrait of a Lady.
The plot has the potential for the diabolical appeal of Dangerous Liaisons. The film is also a visually pleasing period piece.
But the manipulating personalities, primarily represented by John Malkovich's character, are not effective.
Nicole Kidman's lines come across like she is reading the script from cue cards for the first time.
If I had to place blame, I would say the cast was poorly directed, forced to portray this promising story line with a stiff and unconvincing style.
Please do not let this example turn you off to ""Other"" (pun intended) Nicole Kidman films.",1344124800,2,723,4.983471074380165
866763,1,6304419708,"jane campion must have been on drugs when she directed this.  it was so bad -- so bad -- i feel compelled to write a review to tell people what they'd be getting if they bought it.

from the opening titles (a truly weird sequence in which the camera languidly caresses dreamy-eyed modern women -- it looks like a cross between a calvin klein ad and a feminine hygiene commercial), the film goes wayward.

kidman is part of the problem.  there is no there there.  she always appears to be acting, and is never quite to be believed.  the cast is stellar (mortensen, richard e. grant, john geilgud) but entirely wasted.  male characters act and react because they are besotted by kidman's character, but we have no idea why.  kidman (and this is also partly the fault of the writer and director) never gives a reason as to why this should be so, except that we are told that it is so.  the film seemed less a psychological study or period piece and more a mystery -- the mystery as to why intelligent, good, and kind men would sacrifice and pursue and pine for kidman's empty character.

john malkovich is convincingly villanous, in a quotidian way, but he also seems bored.  barbara hershey valiantly rallies and succeeds in her part, but she is like a postage-sized oasis in a desert.

the costuming is stunning, some of the visuals are superb.  the story is non-existent.  it is almost as if jane campion is besotted with kidman and takes it for granted that we will be too.  she is the black hole of the production, beautifully attired.  it was especially painful to watch her scenes with accomplished actors (richard e. grant, viggo mortensen) who, due to their gifts as actors, are quite believeable (richard e. grant is especially poignant).  those scenes were like watching two movies at the same time -- kidman's movie being ridiculous, non-believable, and what-the-f?  the movie that the other, more-than-competent actors inhabit is a glimpse of what their gifts could have brought to hanry james's novel under the hands of a director who had a less bizarre vision.

henry james's novels have the reputation of being very dense because they are richly psychological.  but it is not impossible to film such a book.  although not a film without problems, merchant-ivory's ""the golden bowl"" is a much better example of how james can be tackled on screen.

this film was so bad i am strongly compelled to find out where jane campion lives, knock on her door, and demand my money back.",1343433600,7,2487,4.695150115473441
866764,5,6304419708,This movie has haunted me since I first saw it in its theatrical release.  I hadn't read the book when I saw the movie but corrected that after viewing.  The movie is mysterious at the end and I hoped to gain some insight in reading the book.  I did.  The movie is very true to James' novel which ends ambiguously.  The movie slowly unfolds and for some there won't be enough action but if you like period pieces that are very literary and allow one to think during scenes you will like Campion's direction of this story.,1343088000,32,521,4.329896907216495
866765,5,6304419708,"I'm kind of obsessed with Jane Campion.  She just has this magical way of making her films feel exotic and intoxicating and they just crawl under your skin and fester in the most exciting ways.  `The Portrait of a Lady' is no exception.  In fact, this little gem is one of her finest works, up there with `The Piano' and `Bright Star'.

The film adapts the novel by Henry James, telling the story of Isabel Archer, a dreamer who is not beyond reaching for something she perceives out there for the taking.  She is certainly vied for by many, but their advances are lost on her as her sights are set on larger fish, mainly an independence that no mere man can offer her.  When a seemingly well intentioned (yet dastardly treacherous) `friend', Madame Serena Merle, enters the picture, things change for Isabel.  Soon she is being courted by an art collector, Gilbert Osmond, with strangely hypnotic charms and an eye firmly resting on Isabel's pocketbook (which contains a hefty inheritance from a dearly departed friend).  As her relationship and eventual marriage to Gilbert takes a nasty turn, Isabel begins to uncover a deeper self she wasn't expecting.

In the hands of a lesser visionary, this film could have been so much less that it is.  Period films of this nature really need a strong point of view, otherwise they come across stilted and dusty; ill paced and even boring.  That isn't the case with `The Portrait of a Lady'.  Jane Campion drenches her scenes in sensual frustrations that live and breathe in the audiences mind, cultivating a structural dynamic that engages the audience and dwells on the mind.

The way Gilbert touches Isabel's wrists and the way she exhales in his ear, her breath on his neck and my pulse is racing.

Without strong performances, these scenes just wouldn't work, and not many directors know how to pull from the depths of an actor like Campion does (I mean, seriously...her actors are outstanding).  Nicole Kidman is fantastic as the emotionally ambushed Isabel.  She really sells her characters understanding of her circumstance and the way she handles the uncovering to the truth sends a devastating blow straight through to the viewer.  John Malkovich has defined creepy seduction for years and for some reason the world goes gaga for him, when I simply find him unappealing (unless he's pointing the finger at his own persona so marvelously, as he did in `Being John Malkovich') but I must admit that he works VERY well here.  Honestly though, the queen of the evening is Barbara Hershey (such a delicious Supporting Actress Oscar nominee she was).  The way she haunts her scenes with this underlined maliciousness that is so intoxicating and so breathtakingly gorgeous in appearance yet lethal to the touch; she understood femme fatale and delivered effortlessly.

I wanted her to be in every scene.

A Campion classic, this one is.  I totally recommend it.  The little tricks (that `silent picture' interlude for one) that are on full display here elevate this film and help establish something deeper, richer and more complex than one could have imagined.",1299024000,2,3107,4.887404580152672
866882,5,6304419708,"Even better than I remembered, this feminist reading of Henry James's early novel is truly respectful of the spirit of the book, but mixes in the director's vision without doing violence to the era in which it was set. It is a rare ""modernization"" that hews so closely to the author's vision, using the restraint that makes up an important part of James's style as a stimulus to the director's personal genius. The casting is brilliant, from plainspeaking Mary Louise Parker as Henrietta, to the sinister beauty of Barbara Hershey's Madame Merle. John Malkovitch as Osmond is sublimely demonic. The settings are appropriately gorgeous. Music is used appropriately and the costumes are so well photographed that the viewer feels the pinch of the corsets and revels in the iridiscence of the silks.",1290297600,2,796,5.037878787878788

866887,3,6304419708,"Visually, I would rate this film five stars. And, I'm certain, that those reviewers who see past this film's flaws and award the film four or five stars are rewarding the stunning visuals. But, dramatically, its barely a three (and that's being generous), because, unfortunatley, it seems, that Campion is far more interested in period detail and far more fascinated with various costume choices and interior designs than she is in allowing her actual characters to do or say interesting things. No one in this film is alive. This is, in part, the theme of the film (and Henry James' fiction in general): everyone, in some way, is living a stifled life. But, it is a problem when the sets are infused with more color & life than the actual people. Mary-Louise Parker (whose eccentric bespectacled performance is the most memorable thing about this film) is perhaps the exception here; she breathes life into every scene she is in. But there isn't much air in these salon rooms and the characters just don't seem to connect to each other. This is especially true of Martin Donovan, who plays Isabel Archer's consumptive cousin and confidante, ""Ralph Touchette"". Donovan looks every bit the part (he looks like he just walked out of a Whistler or a Sargent) but we never feel that he really cares for Isabel nor she for him. The indigo and purple and green color palette that surrounds Donovan and co. is really striking but instead of expressively accenting character moods the colors seem only to highlight a lack. Director Campion does provide a few creative bursts which promise to break through the films subdued surfaces--I am thinking of the 2-3 anachronistically avant-garde fantasy sequences that momentarily threaten to artfully collapse the late-Victorian veneer-- but they are contained bursts that produce no real effects (in the audience or in the characters). Its as if Campion spent all her time figuring out what everyone and everything should look like and had no time left to infuse her still life with any energy or enthusiasm. The result is that the film feels, well, like a fin de siecle museum exhibit, which is unfortunate as this is supposed to be a film about an intelligent and sensual woman's coming to life!

To be fair, there are plenty of fine actors in this film (John Gielgud, Shelly Winters, Martin Donovan, Christian Bale, Viggo Mortensen, Richard Grant, Barbara Hershey, Mary Louise Parker) but the one character that matters most, and the one that is supposed to be the very embodiment of life, ""Isabel Archer"", is played by a strangely self-conscious and self-contained, Nicole Kidman. Kidman is beautiful and brilliant in her way and she wears her satin gowns exceptionally well, but she never succeeds in allowing us any access to what thoughts & passions drive one of the most complex female characters in fiction; and she never really connects with any of the other actors; its as if her panoply of emotions all come from some invisible source. The men in her life seem not to matter at all. The performance is solipsistic (and many of the performances in this film are just that). All we really get from Kidman is a youthful yearning & promise that then, all too quickly (after about one hour of cinema time), turns to a full-on pout once she falls for ""Gilbert Osmond"" played by the clownishly evil John Malkovich (this pout lasts for one hour and twenty minutes). Malkovich's performance seems to be a study in extremes as he veers between too-lazy-to-care dilettantism & manic misogyny. Malkovich has made a career out of playing bohemian burn-outs (Dangerous Liasons, Sheltering Sky...) but this one is so detestable that it borders on self-caricature. Barbara Hershey, as Osmond's accomplice ""Serena"", fairs slightly better. Taken alone each actor seems perfectly suited to play their roles, but somehow the characters just don't materialize; the actors take turns having their big moments but these moments just don't seem to add up to anything that we care to count. The characters never really matter to us, the magnitude of their emotions seem unconvincing, and so this Jamesian plot just seems trifling.

I think Campion very much wants this film to be an emblematic film about all free-thinking woman on the cusp of life (and the opening credits that roll while various young women of all races look on seems to be a testament to this), but since she fails to give us a sense of Isabel Archer's deep longing for free choice and danger, we fail to feel the tragedy of her dream of endless options being thwarted and her dream of danger, ironically, coming true.",1203379200,6,4612,4.896419437340153
866888,2,6304419708,"I will start first by saying that,"" NO...I have not read the Henry James' novel."" That said, my job is to review the Jane Campion film and Laura Jones written screenplay. Having seen this film several times over the years since it first was released in the theatres, I have pondered why this film has never really connected with me until today. I do believe that the real problem with this film is the screenplay itself. Laura Jones also adapted Peter Carey's OSCAR AND LUCINDA and the same problem exists in that film as it does in THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY......short scenes, uneven character development and a lack of ""glue"" that ties it all together to make the viewer have a total sense of identification with the characters and their situations. Jane Campion certainly has a beautiful sense of how a film should look and feel visually, but this screenplay screams for the viewer to run to read the source material to truly understand character motivation.

As in OSCAR AND LUCINDA, I read the book after viewing the film in order to REALLY understand what the film SO lacked. In other Henry James' film adaptations, such as THE BOSTONIANS and THE EUROPEANS, the treatment of James' material was much better (BOSTONIANS being the better of the two IMO). In THE PORTRAIT OF THE LADY, Laura Jones' script simply does not capture and distill the characters and the plot enough to grab a viewer for screen watching alone. The BBC mini series of PORTRAIT from the 1960's has alot more information in it, but it is still rather dull and is centered in the character Ralph Touchett and not Isabel Archer. Standing on it's own, without the book or other screen adaptations, Jane Campion's film is as cold as ice, filmed in dark blues with little light,and very disjointed. For all of it's gorgeous costuming, elegant set design and some moments of brilliant acting, PORTRAIT OF A LADY cannot overcome it's one biggest, glaring fault.....a BAD screenplay. Laura Jones should NOT adapt source material beyond her scope.",1180051200,5,2011,4.795389048991354

When Isabel is explaining to Lord Warburton why he shouldn't marry Pansy and the dialogues between Isabel and Ralph). The ending is great as well.

866995,5,6304419708,"Two themes characterize Henry James' novels and are wonderfully rendered in this film: they are fortune hunting and the depiction of wealthy guileless naive Americans in the hands of sophisticated wordly Europeans. Isabel Archer is such a creation, an American transplant to England exploring her self and future, and full of beauty and promise. At the outset she rejects Lord Warburton, the man who should be perfect for her, so she can find her 'self' and let light into her soul. ""I am very fond of my liberty...I wish to choose my fate"" she tells her cousin, Ralph Touchett who also is in love with her. Isabel's idea of happiness is a romantic journey into the unknown, ""A swift carriage ride, of a dark night..."" She appears to be independent and full of purpose, but Isabel is also an innocent with a streak of sensuality in her being. In her naivete' she mistakes the heartless Gilbert Osmund's sensual indulgments for refinement and is captivated by him, while he determines to possess her for her money. The marriage is a disaster for Isabel whose world becomes darker and progressively more oppressive. At last the mortal illness of her cousin, Ralph, allows her to escape Osmund and go back to England. Now all has come full circle, she is older, wiser, she meets again another ex-suitor, Casper Goodwood. He pleads with her to leave Osmund and make a new life for herself with him. She is back at the moment where it all began and she can start over, she has only to make the choice.

It is not only Henry James plot but the way director Campion presents it that makes this film great and utterly intriguing with every viewing. Nichole Kidman presents a marvelous performance of a woman pursuing not only her vision but also struggling with forces within herself and around her that she, at first, doesn't understand. Kidman is the perfect foil for John Malkovich's superb portrayal of Osmund, a shallow sinister dilettante who manipulates Isabel, his daughter, and his ex-mistress like objects. In Campion's settings the lighting of the opulent surroundings dims as Isabel's world closes about her. In the final scene she makes her choice and turns away from the welcoming warmth of Casper Goodwood's world; she chooses to remain out in the cold. She's not stupid. She's no longer innocent, but she rejects the light for the dark and returns to her abuser. Why?

In her rejection of one promising suitor after another, men who are clearly devoted to her, Isabel reveals that engulfing love terrifies her because it will destroy her independence. The only man she can totally give her love to is her cousin Ralph Touchett, on his deathbed, since she will be free again after he dies. We see also in her early fantasy of a threesome with her suitors that there is a strong element of sensuality in her persona that Osmund perceives and exploits, even to the degree that she is roused as he abuses her. Certainly Osmund doesn't love her. She now knows she is nothing but an ornamental bankroll in his shallow world so she no longer has to surrender her independence to him. Yet she returns to him because he challenges her in ways that other suitors never could, and in this Isabel emerges as the most subtle, complex, courageous, and triumphant persona of all.

In fact Henry James modeled Isabel Archer after his patroness, Isabella Stuart Gardner, whose life is revealed in Douglass Shand-Tucci's biography, ""The Art Of Scandal"".",1140048000,,3443,4.802698145025295

She leaves a suitor behind in Boston.  The movie opens with a proposal of marriage by another suitor, which Isabel turns down.  She is not sure whether she ever wants to marry.  She wants to remain free and do great things.

Isabel has a unique relationship with her consumptive cousin.  If anyone, she loves him.  Her American suitor follows her to England in a failed attempt to woe her.  Isabel says to leave her alone for another two years.

Her uncle dies leaving her a great fortune.  She travels to Italy and meets a man (played by John Malcovich) she can't stop thinking about, even as she tours the world.  After two years her American suitor calls again, and Isabel again turns him down. After marrying, Isabel soon learns that her husband only married her for her money, and her life turns very unhappy.

Isabel's step daughter, Pansy, falls in love, but her father won't let her marry her love.  Pansy is afraid to disobey her father who insists on a match with a rich man.  Isabel finds herself in the middle of the matchmaking, and is blamed when a suitor (one of her former suitors as well) becomes disinterested.

Isabel goes to her cousin on his death bed in England, leaving her husband against his wishes.  This escape frees her.  After a tearful good bye with her cousin, Isabel encounters her old American suitor once again.  Played by Viggo Mortensen, his tender, unwavering love for Isabel is the highlight of the movie.

As always, Isabel runs from him, but in the last moment she turns.  The movie leaves us hanging.  The viewer must imagine the ending.

866999,4,6304419708,"At about two and a half hours, Jane Campion tinkers at the bare threshold of monotony with this gorgeous period-piece, but she seldom falters in her ability to make her leading roles (The Piano, Sweetie) hypnotically compelling for all of their mulishness and tenacity.

Much has already been said about Malkovich and Kidman, both of whom I find were good if not superb, and Barbara Hershey, who brings just the right flavour of deviousness to her character. So I will focus instead on some common criticisms of this film.

Reviewers lament Campion's psychological simplifications of the theme, or her ungenerous treatment of Isabel as a sufferer of false consciousness who walks blindly into her own trap. On the contrary, I think the director is both adventurous and above-board in stating her revisionist projects from the very opening frame.

Henry James lived in the 1880s. His original work was intended as an exploration of what a woman might do if she were given independent means, and his story indicted women as being trapped by a weaker nature.

Exploring the same material Campion comes to a different, more ambiguous, but IMHO, also more interesting conclusion. She prefers to establish the film largely as Isabel's subjective experience, not as the story told by some omniscient narrator on whose shoulders falls the onus of proof. This is evidenced, for instance, by a sequence at the beginning where Isabel imagines making love with three different men at the same time.

For all its occasional flaws the film is at least internally consistent and proves to me yet again that Campion possesses cinematic imagination in spades. From her comes some of the boldest use of lighting and Black & White interludes I have seen in modern cinema.

This is the story about a young American woman (Isabel) who is just orphaned and is invited to stay with her rich relatives, the Touchetts in Victorian England. While in England, she is wooed by the rich Lord Warburton but she rejects his proposal because she wants to see the world and be free. When her uncle later dies, Isabel inherits a big sum of money and becomes truly rich and ""independent"". It is actually her cousin, the consumptive Ralph Touchett (who is secretly in love with her) who pressed his father to leave the money to Isabel without Isabel's knowledge. By this time, Isabel has met the scheming and mysterious Madame Merle (who plays Schubert on the piano most beautifully, I must add). M. Merle introduces Isabel to ""her friend"", Gilbert Osmond, a poor and widowed American staying in Italy who has a young daughter, Pansy. Both M. Merle and Osmond scheme to make Isabel marry Osmond so that he could have her money. Isabel innocently falls into their trap. Despite advice and dissuasions from her relatives, she eagerly marries Osmond and her life after that becomes a true nightmare. There is also a sub-plot involving Pansy's impossible love affair with Ned Rossum (played by Christian Bale).
The accompanying booklet of the DVD provides valuable information on the making of the film and the cast profile e.g. the fact that Jane Campion finds this to be her hardest project. From the movie, it is easy to see that she had put in tremendous effort to bring Henry James' classic to life. Every shot, every scene and every movement of the characters is carefully and beautifully directed and filmed. The colors are so rich, the seem to jump out of the screen! And oh, the gorgeous costumes - especially Isabel Archer's!
The casting is also perfect - notably, Nicole Kidman and John Malkovich who plays the villain, Osmond. Martin Donovan also embraces the difficult role of ""Ralph Touchett"" perfectly. My favourite scene is the one nearing the end involving a sobbing, heart-broken Isabel by the bedside of the dying Ralph. It is here that she realizes she loves him. This scene is so tender to watch. To me, this film showcases Nicole Kidman's best performance and it is THIS particular scene that clinches it.

867144,5,6304419708,"Henry James was realistic about women at the end of the 19th century, particularly those standing between the US and Great Britain. Isabel is such a woman. She gets into the world without any parents but with a tremendously good uncle and cousin. She is surrounded with men who love her and want to marry her out of love. She refuses them, three of them, to be able to see the world. And she falls in the hands of a social climber, a social parasite and a fortune hunter who covers up his liaison with the woman who introduced her to him, and whose daughter is the out-of-wedlock child of this very woman. She is of course deeply unhappy, alone, brutalized too, and yet she tries to save the daughter from her fate. She fails because the daughter is totally under the tyrannical authority of her father, an authority that is tyrannical only because the daughter accepts it and submits to it, particularly because of the teachings of some good Catholic nuns. Finally Isabel finds the energy to escape - for a while at least - from that husband when she learns his liaison and she can force him to accept. But she is so pent up in her stubborn decision that she can never step back and consider a real escape. Yet, maybe, at the end, there is a wavering touch of hope - for her. It is incredible how this woman, who wants to be strong-headed and independent, fails to see the men who love her and to recognize the man who uses her. As it is said in the film somewhere, Americans cannot become Europeans, and yet Isabel succeeds very well in becoming twisted and thwarted in Europe. Is that typically European ? Maybe. Nicole Kidman plays the role with style, delicacy, dainty and quaint nuances, but also with a tremendous amount of gusto, sentiment, feeling and emotion. She is probably ten times better than she had ever been, now she can measure herself with actors that are not stereotyped. Her freedom is probably the key to her present depth. Is the film a metaphor of her life ? Maybe. But who cares. What is important is that this Nicole Kidman is able to bring us such a marvellous masterpiece, though some of the  special effects  (strange camera angles and mirror effects) could have been avoided to reach a more intense purity.

Perhaps aiming for wider appeal, she tries to turn this from the portrait of a unique female personality into a more general exploration of ""women in love"".  Such universalizing might have worked if she and screenwriter Laura Jones had also had the wherewithal to change the story to suit their modified heroine.  But having ditched the most critical aspect of the novel, they then remain reasonably faithful to its flow of events, with Isabel choosing an ugly, ""sterile dilettante"" (Malkovich) over a handsome lover and a rich English lord (Mortensen and Grant respectively) both of whom are infatuated with her.  For Isabel the ""naive idealist"", such a choice is perfectly understandable.  For Isabel the ""romance addict"", and women in general, such a choice beggars belief.  So this not only fails as an adaptation, it fails as a convincing narrative in its own right.  Screenwriting devotees might be drawn to it wondering just how Jones will convey Isabel's famous interiority without resorting to voiceover.  The answer is simple: she ignores it in the writing (with the exception of one inspired fantasy sequence) and leaves most of it to performance.  The result is that Kidman spends more than half the film in incomprehensible tears.  The novel's Isabel cries once in 600 pages.  For all that, this film is still not without reward: the performances from the near-ensemble cast are universally marvellous, the settings and costumes exquisite, and the music and cinematography are a perfect match for it all.  There's no doubting Campion's skill as a director; I just doubt her interpretation of the source material.",1052438400,40,1903,5.240924092409241
867147,4,6304419708,"Its amazing that Jane Campion stays so faithful to the novel, and the movie is every bit as captivating as the book. The end differs slightly but the good thing is that Campion's ending is almost as ambiguous and open to interpretation as James's. This stylized film is wonderfully shot, with the colours, dresses and hairdos reflecting various good and bad times of Isabel's life. I thought Kidman is extraordinary as Archer because she captures a good deal of what James took so much pain to describe about Isabel - the nervousness, the quick wit and a sense of wonder about the future, and a slightly frigid attitude.

I wished Caspar Goodwood would be more animated and less brooding than Viggo Mortensen. Martin Donovan is good as Ralph, but I felt he hurried through some of his most important sentences (for e.g ""I call people rich when ..""). Also, when I read the book, I had imagined Osmond would be a lot less physical, though not less malicious, than Malkovich.

Its a great film overall, and it's sad that it didn't catch on as much as it should have. It was after all a very difficult story to film (much like the Bostonians) and I guess very few people liked it when it came out since the story always refrains from helping the reader/viewer. It is not like (say) Sense and Sensibility or Little Women where everything is happily resolved in the end.",1044576000,5,1364,4.609053497942387
867148,3,6304419708,"Jane Campion is a brilliant director who can direct a film and convey much with a minimum of language and action. Her film, ""The Piano"" is a testament to that innate talent. This would lead one to believe that directing an adaptation of a Henry James novel would be a natural segue for her.
While this is a lush and beautiful period piece, the problem with it is that it is somewhat dull. Despite stellar performances by Barbara Hershey and the supporting cast, the main star, Nicole Kidman, is out of her league, though she is a luminous beauty and has some acting ability. The problem is that her performance lacks the presence or depth necessary to transcend the material and make this a truly interesting film. She just is not good enough an actress to be able to carry this type of storyline and engage the viewer in the lead role of wealthy expatriate, Isabel Archer.
Moreover, while John Malkovich gives a wonderful performance as the malevolent Gilbert Osmond, he is decidedly miscast as he is simply not charismatic enough to make it believable that Isabel Archer would throw caution to the wind over such an unattractive and, decidedly, sinister man. It is unfortunate, as the film is an otherwise fairly faithful adaptation of Henry James' complex novel of the same name. It could have been a contender.",1027728000,,1314,4.74235807860262
867149,5,6304419708,"i first read henry james' great novel when i was a teenager. i remember being fascinated by the astounding complexity of his characters -- how every one of them seemed to mask his or her own hidden agendas beneath layers and layers of ""proper"" social veneers.
the Isabel Archer in the beginning of the novel was an outsider, fresh from america, who single-handedly breathed a new life into the stale surroundings of these rigid european social constructs. she was an ephemeral presence, a beam of light around whom both men and women hovered and wished to take something from. the main dilemma that the novel posed was how this young, somewhat naive outsider could hold true to her dreams of bettering herself within a sophisticated european community without compromising her free-spirited nature and selling herself short. simply put, the novel was about a woman who was in a constant state of flux -- involved in a precarious juggling act involving her own aspirations and those of the people who claimed to love her.
with her ""controversial"" ending to the film version, i believe that jane campion has brilliantly dramatized this state of flux, for in this scene, we see our heroine, once again, fleeing from her options (which are presented to her throughout the film in the form of aggressive male suitors and their various promises) rather than confronting them; but this time, as she rushes away from Caspar Goodwood's embrace in the icy yard and toward the warmth and security of Gardencourt, we see her suddenly stop at the threshold of the home and turn her gaze back toward the yard, back toward Caspar Goodwood. and the frame freezes and fades to black.
critics of this scene are disappointed that campion chooses not to reveal, as James does in the novel, that Isabel leaves for Rome the very next day, thereby implying that she has decided to go back to Osmond and reject Goodwood yet again. however, i believe that drawing this sort of implication would be a far too literal and surface-level reading of the text. in the novel, Henrietta is the one who reveals to Goodwood that Isabel has left for Rome. Goodwood is stunned and is turning away when Henrietta grabs him and tells him to wait a moment. and then the novel ends. James seems to suggest that Henrietta will reveal to Goodwood -- who, like the readers at this point, is shocked at the thought that Isabel may actually go back to Osmond -- the true nature of Isabel's intentions. for me, the implication of all of this is that Isabel will return to Rome because it is her duty to confront Osmond, if only to tell him that she is leaving him. indeed, james devotes some time earlier in the final chapter to expounding about Isabel's inner dilemma over remaining true to her obligations.
of course, this is only my reading of the text, but i believe that this reading helps elucidate campion's decision to end the film the way she does. for although, in the film, Isabel does turn at the threshold of the house to look back towards Goodwood, you will notice that her hand is still firmly on the door handle. she MUST open the door and enter the house and leave for Rome the next day because campion would not stray so far from the text as to betray the facts of the novel (which happens to be a work of literature that she reveres). by ending the film on this moment, campion is at once able to stay true to the facts of the text while dramatizing, in essence, what the whole film has been about: the precarious nature of an independent-natured woman's destiny in a world that aggressively forces her to choose between various life ""options"" that are really nothing more than thinly veiled, socially accepted constructs. just as the ending of the film is uncertain and ambiguous, campion suggests that so too was the future of a woman who dared to stray from the social conventions of that time.
as an astonishing counterpoint to the women of Isabel's time, campion opens the film with an inspired segment in which we see a diverse range of young women looking attentively into the camera; some are sitting gracefully, others are dancing, some are dark skinned, others light, some have short hair, others long, and all are either smiling or looking content. earlier, we hear them discussing the impact of a kiss and the dreamy, romanticized attentions of a lover. campion suggests that these women are, in essence, the descendants and beneficiaries of Isabel Archer's earlier struggles to maintain her own identity within a socio-cultural paradigm that wished only to devour it. for these contemporary women, the nature of love and romance is a topic that is to be discussed in leisure and with fondness, not a crushing matter that could determine the course of their lives. THAT, campion suggests, is Isabel Archer's gift to them.",1021248000,17,4805,4.741935483870968
867150,1,6304419708,"""A Portrait of a Lady"" is a really FINE novel, about a headstrong American heiress who might have married anyone she wanted, and chose the absolute worst man possible. Like I thought of the recent film ""The End of the Affair"", everyone would be better served by reading the excellent novel and just leaving it at that.
This movie could have been great, like the novel is, except for a tremendously fatal flaw made in the casting. John Malkovich plays Gilbert Osmond, the fellow Isabel (Nicole Kidman) completely misreads and marries. I found him entirely wrong for the part. When I read the novel years ago, I cast my own movie version in my mind, as I'm sure many may do to help visualize what's being played out. Osmond is a ritualist, a sensualist, but a sensualist without love. He may have passion, but there would be no tenderness. He constantly compares himself to the pope, as he like the pontiff lives in Rome. Well, the actor who came to mind then, and still did when I re-read the book ages later, is Orson Welles, as he was in ""The Third Man"". It has to be someone who as I say is somewhat sensuous looking. And Welles was that, with his thick lips and satiated eyes. Malkovich? No, no way. Why would she ever have thought him attractive? He was always creepy; there wasn't anything to misinterpret. Bad casting, pure and simple.",1020297600,9,1341,4.545454545454546
867151,4,6304419708,"Nicole Kidman is convincing. The creation of this imagery of entrapment -- the kind of hell that social relationships can become, of their potentially destructive effects on the human spirit is terrifying and yet, this excellent film is beautifully captured. The plays with light and darkness and Nicole's bright future slowly slides into oblivion. It's a remarkable film.
It might speak to only one gender, however. I found that my male collegues were not so enticed by it. It may be that men have not felt the same domination in relationships that Nicole's character portrays so bravely.
And yet, I wonder. In as much as Shakespeare was right, ""men have been deceivers ever,"" I think the same must be said for both genders. So it might be, that reading to the film, male viewers can identify the entrapment as well.
Embedded in this film is a hidden recipe for how to do a relationship well. For even from those that you learn how not to act, you still have learned.",1018742400,,968,4.7

I thoroughly enjoyed Nicole Kidman and John Malkovich, but I'm not sure what all the fuss about Barbara Hershey was--she wasn't bad, but I didn't find her exceptional either, she just blended in with the rest of them.  Mary-Louise Parker was completely irritating, whereas Martin Donovan, Richard E.Grant, and Viggo Mortensen (whose character kept showing up out of nowhere--very confusing) were usually good, but with a few weak moments.  That pretty much summed up the film: potentially great, but too long, too pretentious, and too murky on some fairly essential plot points.

The acting is very solid throughout, with John Malcovitch excelling in his role of a shallow, but charismatic man with an obsessive need to control the people he considers his.  But I wonder if we're not given enough of the depth of the novel to explain Isabelle's reasoning and motivations.  It's possible that the novel can't be captured, despite a director's good intentions.  The prologue and the strange take on some scenes were odd, but did present an interesting twist to the story, and they didn't bother me.  However, I think there is a slow pace that builds effectively, and a slow pace that will loose the viewer.

However, from the start of the film, I found myself wondering what was going on: the mixture of color, b/w, 'old time' film styles was confusing and unnecessary to what is a period film with a strong enough narrative and point of view.  Even the opening credits made no sense with the rest of the film, and were not tied to anything else.  Nicole Kidman, Barbara Hershey, and John Malkovich are good, but other characters, such as Mary Louise Parker's Henrietta, make no sense if you haven't read the book.  Some of the sequences felt edited to the extent of loss of continuity, and the transformation of Kidman's character into someone looking like Hershey's isn't mentioned, and no one seems to care that Kidman's hair miraculously changes color and texture the minute she is in England.  Disconcerting.  At least Campion took the abrupt and ambiguous ending seriously, although if you haven't read the book, it seems as if the film just ran out of ideas, not to mention steam.

I am more energetic when I have something good to say and this movie completely fullfills this. I have been fond of this film for some time now. It took me months to realize just how deeply I was touched by it and how it stayed  with me continually. Henry touches on FEMALE NATURE, and the foolishness of women to want an abusive husband. Henry couldn't do better with knowning a woman's soul literally. I have never seen a man be so wise in reading women like books. I am attracted to Ms. Archer because she reminds me so much of myself. It was quite evident that she was terrified of intimacy, and almost wanted someone to abuse her. Throughout the whole movie, she screamed inwardly, "" SAVE ME from myself."" Many people have mentioned the word ""masochist"" in describing her character and I believe they are correct. To some level, most women are masochists. There is a battle between the sexes. This movie touches on it. Women, like Ms. Archer are afraid of REAL men who don't easily fall for them. When Ms. Archer supposedly returns to her husband Oswand, it shows her in-ability to grow and break away from him and her wanting abuse. The film touches on so much psychology of the female, I could go on forever. I only wished she would have given up and had been strong, and married the other respectable gentleman at the end of the film, and starved the other side of her till it vanished.

The three  pieces of music by Schubert were still exquisite in capturing the emotions  of the movie itself.  The soundtrack for this film is equally as moving as  the book and movie.  It is perhaps one of my favorite Cd's and I cannot go  one day without listening to it at least once.  The prologue, I found  to be thoughtful and beautiful.  It showed the beauty of women with all  it's different faces and forms.  It showed women just being women. It was  the director's way of adding her own signature to a wondrous classic.  I must say Ralph Touchett was my favorite character, because he truly  wanted to see Isabel succeed and do everything her heart desired.  Isabel's  return to Gardencourt, to spend time with her cousin before he dies, is the  most haunting scene in this adaptation.  To summarize this movie/book.

867425,4,6304419708,"Jane Campion did an absolutely superb job in her 1993 Oscar-nominated film The Piano, which starred Holly Hunter as a mute woman sent to marry a man she's never met.  That movie is for some reason one of my favorite of all  time, despite the fact that I personally don't like romance movies or their  equivalent, ""chick flicks.""  After seeing this movie you tend to  think there may be no such thing.  Jane Campion has done another great film  here, although not as good as the Piano, gets a pretty high mark on its own  as a different, brilliant film.
Nicole Kidman stars as Henry James'  headstrong character, Isabel Archer, an American woman who moves to England  to live with her rich uncle (Sir John Gielgud) and aunt (Shelley Winters),  while at this time in her life is desperate to find true love and marry.  After her uncle dies, he leaves her a fortune in his will.  Isabel, now  being the rich woman she is, marries the monstrous Gilbert Osmond (John  Malkovich), who turns her life from pleasant to perhaps utter unhappiness,  all at the hand of Madame Merle (Barbara Hershey--who was nominated for  best supporting actress).
The movie surely plays as a ""Dangerous  Liaisons"" from the victim's point of view, although the film is much  more than that.  For one, this movie is a lot better.  Secondly, the  villians are far more monstrous than revengeful, and finally this movie is  just plain more interesting.  A flaw in this movie is its slowness,  although if you allow yourself to be intrigued by its plot and characters,  this tends not to be a problem (at least it wasn't for me).  It also  depends on how educated you are to enjoy this film, and from my view, a  person has to be somewhat to enjoy this movie in the slightest sense.  Not  to say I'm smarter than everybody else--I had to put the closed captioning  on to read what the characters were saying to keep up with the plot.
Once  again, Campion has scored and proven that yes, even a woman, can make a  fantastic motion picture.  I think people should give her more credit (not  to mention she needs to make more movies) because her talent is truly one  that should be noted.  The DVD pretty much blows as you can tell if you  read the techno-info, but a widescreen version of the film (a 2.35:1  non-anamorphic transfer) will at least let you see the movie in all its  splendor.",962064000,8,2358,4.5322195704057275

867428,5,6304419708,"Two themes characterize Henry James' novels and are wonderfully rendered in this film: they are fortune hunting and the depiction of wealthy guileless naive Americans in the hands of sophisticated wordly Europeans. Isabel Archer is such a creation, an American transplant to England exploring her self and future, and full of beauty and promise.  At the outset she rejects Lord Warburton, the man who should be perfect for her, so she can find her 'self' and let light into her soul.  ""I am very fond of my liberty...I wish to choose my fate"" she tells her cousin, Ralph Touchett who also is in love with her. Isabel's idea of happiness is a romantic journey into the unknown, ""A swift carriage ride, of a dark night...""  She appears to be independent and full of purpose, but Isabel is also an innocent with a streak of sensuality in her being.  In her naivete' she mistakes the heartless Gilbert Osmund's sensual indulgments for refinement and is captivated by him, while he determines to possess her for her money.  The marriage is a disaster for Isabel whose world becomes darker and progressively more oppressive.  At last the mortal illness of her cousin, Ralph, allows her to escape Osmund and go back to England. Now all has come full circle, she is older, wiser, she meets again another ex-suitor, Casper Goodwood.  He pleads with her to leave Osmund and make a new life for herself with him.  She is back at the moment where it all began and she can start over, she has only to make the choice.

It is not only Henry James plot but the way director Campion presents it that makes this film great and utterly intriguing with every viewing.  Nichole Kidman presents a marvelous performance of a woman pursuing not only her vision but also struggling with forces within herself and around her that she, at first, doesn't understand.  Kidman is the perfect foil for John Malkovich's superb portrayal of Osmund, a shallow sinister dilettante who manipulates Isabel, his daughter, and his ex-mistress like objects.  In Campion's settings the lighting of the opulent surroundings dims as Isabel's world closes about her. In the final scene she makes her choice and turns away from the welcoming warmth of Casper Goodwood's world; she chooses to remain out in the cold.  She's not stupid. She's no longer innocent, but she rejects the light for the dark and returns to her abuser.  Why?

In her rejection of one promising suitor after another, men who are clearly devoted to her, Isabel reveals that engulfing love terrifies her because it will destroy her independence.  The only man she can totally give her love to is her cousin Ralph Touchett, on his deathbed, since she will be free again after he dies.  We see also in her early fantasy of a threesome with her suitors that there is a strong element of sensuality in her persona that Osmund perceives and exploits, even to the degree that she is roused as he abuses her.  Certainly Osmund doesn't love her.  She now knows she is nothing but an ornamental bankroll in his shallow world so she no longer has to surrender her independence to him.  Yet she returns to him because he challenges her in ways that other suitors never could, and in this Isabel emerges as the most subtle, complex, courageous, and triumphant persona of all.

In fact Henry James modeled Isabel Archer after his patroness, Isabella Stuart Gardner, whose life is revealed in Douglass Shand-Tucci's biography, ""The Art Of Scandal"".",943401600,2,3461,4.802698145025295

Her hair in this movie has to be the worst ever seen on screen. This movie failed in every way, but Henry James needs to be ascribed much of the fault. That book is overrated too. I was going to liken this movie to a bad day-time soap, but even bad soaps are far more appealing then this movie.",1497830400,,433,4.105882352941176
