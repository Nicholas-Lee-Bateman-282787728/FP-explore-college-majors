8225246,5,B000WQWQ2C,Good overall season review even if you are not a Moto GP fan or just getting into it.  Well worth it.,1306627200,,101,3.8095238095238093
8225247,4,B000WQWQ2C,"I enjoy having the whole season on one disc. I just wish it was the entire races, not just the highlights.",1273104000,,106,4.095238095238095
8225248,1,B000WQWQ2C,"I have bought all the MotoGP DVD season reviews from 2000-2007 and plan on buying 2008.  I have been to the U.S. Redbull GP at Laguna Seca the past 3 years and I love the sport!

That being said, I am truly disapointed with the 2007 DVD.  One of the greatest things to hear during the race is the loud 130db sound of the bikes; something you barely hear during the review.  Also the commentary was very poor, sometimes even no sound at all.  If this is only a highlight why couldn't it contain commentary throughout?

Another note, why not have the 250cc and 125cc race highlights like the older DVD reviews?

Lastly I appreciate the intro that was created/illustrated, but why show the same 45 second clip before every race highlight?  That's extra time taken from the race footage or paddock footage.

All in all any MotoGP enthusiast will still enjoy watching some of the highlights, but don't be surprised if you get bored by the audio.",1229558400,5,940,4.5476190476190474
8225249,1,B000WQWQ2C,"Would somebody please make sure the next review has the audio mixed properly?  I can't believe they turned down all the race sounds and turned up the commentators.  The commentary is secondary to the thrill of HEARING the RACE SOUNDS.

God, which moron sat in the audio studio and came up with this mix?

Terrible.  Within 20 seconds I felt cheated.

It really felt like there was a mic in the middle of a room picking up the voice of the commentators while they watched the TV playback of the races with the volume of the TV turned down.

Oh and yes please, more time in the paddock and with the umbrella girls (aren't they part of the whole thing?)

Save yourself some money, pick up the ""Faster"" 4-dvd set and get excited for the sport.",1217721600,8,739,4.382352941176471
8225250,2,B000WQWQ2C,"Don't get me wrong.  I LOVE motoGP and love the fact that I can miss a race or two during the season and still pick up these season reviews, but they clearly need to step up the videos.
I like the video shots of the european countries and all, but wouldn't it make more sense to spend a little more time in the paddock??
As a fan of the sport, I would much rather see video about the racers and their preparation, hobbies, interests, challenges, etc. than seeing the lovely Spanish countryside.
In a sport where they are starving for US attention, it would make more sense to me to play the ""personal"" card vs. the ""tourist"" card.  Since the races this season were pretty ""ho-hum"" w/ Stoner's domination, it would have been good to see a LOT more behind the scenes.",1204588800,13,765,4.380281690140845
