8340578,5,B001T4Y1S8,I went to HHS so I am partial to anything having to do with the history of the school ! it's 130 years old now.... Beautiful school!,1458777600,,132,3.925925925925926
8340579,4,B001T4Y1S8,"I bought this for my mother, an HHS alumna.  She always fondly speaks of the school and it's reputation when she attended (C/O '57).  The architecture is just gorgeous and puts my high school to shame.  Unfortunately, HHS's academic reputation took a dive during the 70s, but it's been doing better as of the last 10 years or so.

Anyway, this is a nice little video and should be shown to all of the new students.  Being a student here is also being a part of a great Tampa institution.  Although most kids probably won't appreciate that until they're older. :-)

The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that I would have liked it to have been a little more in-depth.  Granted, though, I'm a history nerd, so a much longer documentary would have probably bored most people! :-)",1293926400,,792,4.451388888888889

8340581,5,B001T4Y1S8,"My HHS documentary DVD arrived yesterday, and I watched it immediately with my wife and my son, who is a
high school junior this year.  He had a lot of questions about Hillsborough and that strange concept called ""school spirit"" which is sadly hard to find in this jaded age...  I recognised a lot of stills which were taken from the Hilsborean from my years ('60-'62) - I paused the show when it came to the photo of the Beaker Breakers and Mrs. Rebe, my 11th grade chemistry teacher.  It seemed fitting that I should introduce to my family some of the people who were so important to me not so very long ago.
