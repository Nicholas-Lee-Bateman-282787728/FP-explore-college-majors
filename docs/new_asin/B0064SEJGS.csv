8492856,2,B0064SEJGS,"WARNING: The second DVD snapped in two when I tried to coax it from the spindle. I have never encountered so flimsy a disc. The color is ""vintage"" (I.e., runny) and the audio lags a fraction of a second behind the picture. Not one of the Met's better-produced in-house releases. Troyanos is fantastic, though.",1484956800,,309,4.7407407407407405
8492857,1,B0064SEJGS,"Here is what happened.  I bought this DVD back in 2013, thinking it was a limited edition and wouldn't last long.  It was expensive then as well, over $40.

When it arrived, I noticed that not only did they send me the shrink-wrapped case with two DVD's inside, they also sent an additional two DVD's of the same thing, separately, without a case.

I didn't know why that was, but in any event I set it aside and didn't get around to listening to it until almost 3 years later.

When I finally got around to watching it, I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find that parts of it were gravely defective on the technical side.  That is, the sound was out of synch with picture, something that plagues a great many opera DVD's, but I hadn't encountered it on a MET DVD yet.

Then I wondered if this was why they had sent me an extra set of the same DVD's.  I wondered if it was because they had received complaints about this defect, so they were sending some newer ones from a different 'run'.  Well, these were bad as well.

Now, three years after the fact is far too much to expect in the way of customer service.  And yet, when I wrote to the Met Opera Shop describing the situation, they said they would be glad to send me a replacement.  It is to their credit they would do this, because there is NO ONE I would ever expect to do this after an interval of three years.

However, the new replacement is exactly the same as the old one.  There are 3 copies I have seen, over the space of 3 years, all defective.

And so I came here to Amazon Reviews, and I see another one-star review describing the exact same defect.

So I can't fault customer service at the Met Opera Shop.  And I can't fault the performance, and it is even someone other than Placido Domingo, which is welcome just for the sake of variety if nothing else :-)

But it is up to 4 copies now, and no indication from others that they have even seen theirs.  I would hazard they haven't.

If you would like to donate $40 to the Met, that is wonderful.  But don't expect a Don Carlo video in return.

Respectfully submitted ...",1466812800,4,2089,4.248730964467005
8492858,1,B0064SEJGS,"Beginning in the monastery scene of Act I and becoming worse through scene 2, the sound track separates from the video data.  What a shame that in Troyanos' marvelous aria, the visuals are a full word behind the audio. At this price point .... unacceptable. I didn't even play disc 2.",1456790400,,284,4.568627450980392
8492859,5,B0064SEJGS,"A marvelous cast, superbly conducted. But don't be fooled. This DVD is not out of print and can be found elsewhere for a fraction of the cost.",1426636800,,142,4.296296296296297
8492860,5,B0064SEJGS,"This is a lovely production of my favorite Verdi opera.  I enjoyed it very much for its beautiful singing, the complex plot and the fine acting of the singers.",1403827200,,160,4.517241379310345
8492861,4,B0064SEJGS,"This is the best overall production I have seen of this opera. Though I like the French version done at the Chalet in 1996, this is still the best. I first saw it in 1979 on stage.  This was the 1980 telecast from the Met. The sound was still a bit rudimentary. Mike placements and balance not as good as they would be in three seasons. At times, even the biggest voices fade until they move to a better spot. Still, this is the worst part of this DVD.

Levine is still young and imaginative in this production.  He allows the flexibility Verdi would have demanded. This is a very good reading of the score, and one of his best from the master opera composer.

If you want one reason to get this, it is Paul Plishka. He is in his prime and the best Phillipe I have ever heard. A much underrated bass, this is a role that fits like a glove. His dark timbre and the magnificent ring on his f's and f-sharps are marvelous.  Aside form Nicolai Ghiaurov, the best bass of the era. This is a must for no other reason.

Renato Scotto was a fine actress and singer. As Elizabeth, she sings with beauty and dignity. Dramitically, this role is not a major challenge, but musically, it requires a good sense of phrasing and tonal color.  Though not the the prettiest voice of her era, she has the tools for a very good performance. Her facial expressions compensate for general lack of physical drama for the character. And her high pianissimo..........wow.

As Carlo, Vasile Moldoveanu is another underrated performer in this country. His voice is Domingo sized and his color approaches Corelli without the same level of ""squillo."" he does have ringing top notes.  Here, he is not quite the best I have heard from him, but he sings with commitment and generally good tone.  He is a bit understated in his drama with Sherrill Milnes, but he handles this shortest of Verdi tenor roles well.

Milnes is in his prime and in his element. Lyric and dramatic, power and sensitivity, he brings out the nobility and quiet strength of his role and still has reserve to milk his dying scene. Again, he is a Great in his prime and with Plishka, the chemestry is riveting.

The legendary Jerome Hines is the Inquisitor.  Again, wow.

Finally, one of my favorite mezzo's, Tatiana Troyanos.  A wonderful Eboli.

Aside from the microphone issue mentioned above, this is the DVD to get of you want a marvelous performance of the five act Italian version of this operas. Happy Verdi bicentennial.",1371686400,8,2468,4.549773755656108
8492862,5,B0064SEJGS,"A wonderfull performance by all the artists, and I greatly enjoyed  watching it,  I was at the performance many years ago.",1346284800,,122,4.761904761904762
8492863,4,B0064SEJGS,"The 1980 performance of John Dexter's 1979 production of Verdi's ""Don Carlos"" (in Italian translation), is headed by Vasile Moldoveanu, Renata Scotto, Tatiana Troyanos, Sherrill Milnes, Paul Plishka, and Jerome Hines.

Dexter's production is severe and intense, culminating in an overwhelming auto-da-f, the burning of unrepentant heretics. (This writer saw the 1984 revival in the theatre.) Scotto and Troyanos are particularly fine in rendering his ethos, a kind of concentrated stillness. The costumes are brilliant.

Moldoveanu is better than one might have recalled. Without the glamour of other exponents of Don Carlos, such as Jon Vickers, Plcido Domingo, or Roberto Alagna, he sings the role more musically than many other tenors of the past who are nearly worshipped. Scotto was certainly one of the greatest of singing-actresses, and shows herself, once again, to be a complete actress. Her transition from the happy French princess of the beginning of the opera to the tragic Queen of Spain is extraordinary. Her voice, if not of an objective ""beauty,"" is completely expressive. Troyanos is seen here in one of her finest portrayals, as the flamboyant Princesse of Eboli, and Milnes is also seen in one of his most sympathetic roles.

For this writer, Plishka's greatest role was that of King Philippe II. He certainly did not resemble the great Catholic monarch of history, but he mastered the role, one of the most complex for basses. Even if one is not a usual admirer of Hines, it must be admitted that his Grand Inquisiteur was a triumph. Despite a worn voice, he thunders to great effect as this mysterious character who, in reality, dominates this grand opera. In the secondary roles, Betsy Norden, John Cheek, and Timothy Jenkins make particularly felicitous impressions. The 1983 revival of this production, with Domingo, Mirella Freni, Grace Bumbry, Louis Quilico, Nicolai Ghiaurov, and Ferruccio Furlanetto, had been previously issued on DVD.",1325289600,11,1964,5.268370607028754
