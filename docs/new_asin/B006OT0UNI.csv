8502225,2,B006OT0UNI,"I actually didn't expect much, but I'd seen Melantha Blackthorne in a couple of movies and she showed potential as an actress. This however is not one she should put on her resume.",1400025600,3,180,4.484848484848484
8502226,5,B006OT0UNI,This was horrible. It had no wrestling and no blood. It was just some amateurs pretending to tussle around in a kids swimming pool (filled with slippery red syrup) inside some hotel conference room. Most of the women involved are not even attractive. The guy doing the announcing calls the same four moves over and over regardless of what the women are doing. The music sucks. Wasted my money.,1384560000,4,393,4.7101449275362315
8502227,1,B006OT0UNI,"The ""Average Women of Horror"" and  ""the most chubby actresses in underground horror"" is how the Editorial Review should read. These women are so minimally attractive that you're relieved to see them shower with all their clothes on. The event is a kiddie pool in the middle of a hotel banquet hall filled with a pink paste that is supposed to be blood. For a horrifying atmosphere they have all the lights on while some acid casualty riffs hack chops on a casio keyboard full blast. A horror movie about women wrestlers(or gory wrestling matches) would of been pretty cool. Instead this a bunch of non athletes in dumpster diver outfits rolling around as if in slow motion.",1334016000,3,673,4.703389830508475
