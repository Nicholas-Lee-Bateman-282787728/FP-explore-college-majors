2218428,5,B0007LPSM2,"Move over Norman Bates, Michael Myers, and Jason Voorhees--there's a new demented-since-youth serial killer in town.  His name is Martin Bristol, and he's one bad mutha.

2004's MALEVOLENCE is a low-budget but high-quality slasher flick that hearkens back to the roots of the genre and reminds fans why classics like PSYCHO (1960), THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974), and HALLOWEEN (1978) remain so beloved.  Yes, MALEVOLENCE borrows a lot of iconography from the classics that came before, but it is more than a mere imitation.  Auteur Stevan Mena and his crew pay homage to their legendary predecessors but approach their material with contemporary vision and some fresh ideas.  So even veteran slasher fans are apt to jump a few times, and most will sit on the edges of their seats along with the genre newbies.

As with HALLOWEEN, the film starts by feeding to the audience a wee bit of backstory that initially seems unrelated to the rest of the film.  The plot then seems to center on a quartet of thieves and a bank robbery that has gone awry.  But much like PSYCHO and THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, the film unexpectedly but skillfully shifts gears and focuses on the inept thieves' fateful encounter with a depraved killer--donning what is likely become his trademark mask--who lives in an abandoned slaughterhouse on the acreage adjacent to their hideout.

Since the bulk of the primary characters in MALEVOLENCE are crooks and do not come off as very nice or likeable folk, the film at times seems to be a cautionary tale about the ""bad"" things that can happen to ""bad"" people.  But the robbers have also picked up a few innocent hostages along the way, a plot device that provides the audience with a character or two that they can identify with--characters who,  as any genre fan knows, are probably going to survive.  (Such characters are known as the ""final girls"" in genre jargon, and they have become an immutable part of the slasher-flick tradition.)  But the final scene jarringly tweaks the assumed morality theme.

Though most, if not all, of the primary players are cinematic newcomers, the acting in MALEVOLENCE is top-notch.  Brandon Johnson quite convincingly portrays the angst-ridden robber who was reluctantly drafted into the bank heist, and beautiful dark-haired actress Heather Magee plays the smarmy and manipulative love interest with professional flair and finesse not usually seen in low-budget indies.  Even better is the performance of Samantha Dark.  As the adult hostage, she evokes a realistic sense of anxiety, fear, and despair that makes it easy to believe that she is in genuine danger.

Stevan Mena wrote, directed, and co-edited MALEVOLENCE, and he did such a fantastic job that it's surprising to learn that this is his first feature-film effort.  His direction is tight and the editing top-notch; not a single action or scene seems superfluous to the plot, yet it is all also visually exciting.  And speaking of the visual, the cinematography and lighting are outstanding, with rich color and crisp detail (when necessary) even in the dark-lit or night scenes.  (Check out those trees along the edge of the road when Brandon Johnson and Heather Magee are driving down that dark stretch of rural highway!)

Following in the footsteps of venerable genre director John Carpenter, writer/director Mena also composed and created the score for MALEVOLENCE.  And an interesting and eclectic score it is.  Certain parts evoke passages from Bernard Herrmann's score for PSYCHO, yet other sections are clearly inspired by Carpenter's own score for the legendary HALLOWEEN.  In spite of the many sources of inspiration, however, the score for MALEVOLENCE never seems hodgepodge.  As with his direction and editing, Mena knows where certain styles or types of music are needed to complement the mood of a scene or the actions being depicted, and never does the music seem inappropriate or overbearing.  Yes, Mena nods and sometimes bows to the masters that came before him, but never does he sacrifice the film at hand for the sake of paying homage.

MALEVOLENCE is a film that will greatly please hardcore genre fans, yet it should also entertain the newbies and those who lurk on the periphery of the genre.  It is a wonderful piece of filmmaking that supports the argument that the best contemporary horror and slasher flicks come not from Hollywood, but from independent filmmakers who truly love the genre and know what it's about.

The DVD from the cool folks at Anchor Bay--folks who, by the way, also assisted with the theatrical distribution of the film--is a film-lover's treasure trove.  Not only does it offer a beautiful digital transfer of the film--anamorphic and in its intended aspect ratio of 1.85:1--there is also a bunch of goodies like a feature commentary with Mena and some of the actors, deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, the theatrical trailer & radio spots, and even some rehearsal footage.  This package is a must-own for any serious genre fan or indie-movie buff.",1114473600,2,5034,5.027710843373494
2218429,4,B0007LPSM2,i'm not sure whether or not this movie would exactally be considered a slaher film. it seems that way to me. others seem to disagree but i thougt the whole bank robbery thing was interesting it added something real to what would have been just another horror movie. also unlike the majority of movies like halloween you got to see the victims or mary at least being stabbed usually you just get the flash of the knife and then see a bloody corpse so i liked that but i have one major concern here that pretty much prevented me from giving this 5 stars.. where the f**k was the nudity?,1114041600,2,584,4.318181818181818

I just saw the remake of Amityville Horror, and I must say, it sucked. Everyone in the theater was either laughing or rolling their eyes. You want a good haunted house movie, check out the Haunting(1963), The Shining, the original(Vincent Price) House On Haunted Hill, the Changeling, or the original Amityville Horror film. ANYWAY, I can't wait to get this movie in the mail, it looks scary as hell. Hopefully the viewing will come to my city(doubt it lol).

2218432,3,B0007LPSM2,"a little independent horror flick about 3 guys and a girl who rob a bank and end up getting seperated, one of the guys dies and another one of the guys kidnaps a woman and her daughter. The kidnapper brings the daughter and mother to a house out in the middle of nowhere. The 3rd man and the bank robbing woman show up and they find the mother but the daughter is missing. Wanna know where she is? She's hidden in a factory not far from there...factory...slaughterhouse, same thing and there is a sadistic killer wandering around looking for a good night's kill. Obviously just a cookie cutter plot to Halloween and Texas Chainsaw and those bunch but it stands alone in its little world with low budget camera work and some corny acting but hey, its a little better then the loud obnoxious horror movies we get now a days with all the decapitations for no reasons and the blood and the innards which become outards. Chilling atmosphere though with corny suspenseful music...it works for most part and its predictable yet enjoyable at the same time. Basically at the beginning it talks about child abductions and it works good into the movie as we see a little boy and his mother and then later when we unmask the killer its the little boy who was kidnapped years back...so yeah",1108512000,,1277,4.556521739130435
2218433,2,B0007LPSM2,"I feel that ever since Wes Craven came out with ""Scream,"" there have been a whole lot of seemingly scary movies being scraped up from obvious sources.  Malevolence is part ""Halloween,"" part ""Texas Chainsaw Mass."" so much that it's predictable, which made me uninterested after half of it's viewing.  The premise is that a bank robbery goes wrong between 3 guys and a girl.  One of the guys escapes alone and ends up kidnapping a mother and daughter in their minivan and ties them up and keeps them in an abandoned house not far from serial killer territory.  There could have been so much more depth, intensity, and just plain better acting between these characters and with this story. Since I saw ""Halloween"" a few times over the past 12 years, this serial killer's demeanor and look was a close copy of Michael Myers, but the mask was a little more KKK.  The sound effects where also straight from Halloween.  But if you've seen Halloween and thought it was scary, don't expect this one to be equally scary.  So, my advise would be that if you're in your mid- to late 20s or older and you've seen the classic horror films, don't waste your time with this.  If you're a teenager who's never seen or heard of ""Halloween,"" just rent it.  It's better than Malevolence.",1106438400,,1267,4.595555555555555
2218493,1,B0007LPSM2,Meh at best. Acting at a bare minimal acceptable level. No real plot or story line. It made me sleepy. Not scary at all.,1458777600,,120,4.041666666666667

If there is a plot or purpose, I missed it. I would have given up on the movie, but I was hoping that something significant would take place. Nope. I myself feel neither bereaved nor malevolent, just glad the boring, jumbled waste is behind me, way behind me.",1414195200,,418,4.819444444444445

2218500,3,B0007LPSM2,"More than anything, this film feels like a companion to the superior prequel, 'Bereavement'. A good first attempt from a promising director!

2218501,3,B0007LPSM2,"Malevolence is a horror movie with an old-school feel. It's about a group of bank robbers that end up in a situation with a serial killer after a slightly messed up heist. Sounds interesting, right? Although Malevolence is a good film, its flaws stop it from being truly great.

What did I like? It has an authentic old-school slasher atmosphere. The music is similar to movies like Halloween and I really enjoyed it. It also feels similar to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre; there is a scene where Kurt, a robber, searches the killer's home and ends up with a similar whack to the head like in TCM. Aside from that, it has plenty of great looking shots and a decent antagonist (he actually reminded me of Jason from the original Friday the 13s.)

What did I dislike? Malevolence's biggest issue is definitely the mostly terrible acting. Luckily, the worst actor dies early on in the movie. Overall, most of it looks forced and the dialogue has no immersion. Also, the movie is generic and really stays away from originality and innovation. The ending was also expected.

Overall, it's a good movie, but it's not amazing. It really doesn't stand out and is only worth watching if you want to kill time or if you're a fan of the slasher genre. As of 6/30/12, Malevolence is available on Netflix Streaming and I recommend you check it out there before directly paying for it.

No sex or nudity, but it does have violence and blood, and some frightening scenes.",1341014400,,1454,4.64591439688716

2218521,2,B0007LPSM2,"Malevolence is a horror movie that tells the tale of a deranged lunatic that tortures and kills women. The story touches on Martin Bristol a six year old boy that was kidnapped over ten years ago and became the student of this psychotic killer. The story has another plot going as well about four people that have committed a bank robbery and are on the run. One of the robbers in an attempt to get away car jacks a women and her young daughter and takes them to an abandoned house where he waits for the other bank robbers to arrive. The story gets really creepy and confusing and you just want it to end. I just discovered Anchor Bay Films and I'm quickly becoming a fan, but this one just didn't do it for me. The prequel to this movie ""Bereavement"" is a much better movie, but it still lacks the gripping conclusions that I love in a good horror film, but the storylines are much more cohesive than Malevolence.",1319932800,,915,4.356725146198831
2218522,2,B0007LPSM2,Maybe we have seen too many horror movies but we found the film to be rather boring and in some parts slow.  There are quite a few parts where the characters are running through dark woods even before they are stalked by the killer.  The mother remains bound throughout most of the movie and once the little girl flees the viewer doesn't see her for a while.  The killer's face is covered the vast majority of the time.  Plus the very ending was predictable.  The movie (like most of the reviewers have mentioned) is a rehash of other horror movies so there is not anything new or extremely well done.,1318723200,,601,4.427272727272728
2218523,5,B0007LPSM2,"MALEVOLENCE concerns a group of bankrobbers who hide out in a forgotten farmhouse. Little do they know that a homicidal (malevolent as it turns out) maniac lives just down the road. This leads to several brutal deaths. There's a bit more to the story, including the killer's novel method of succession. The movie's atmosphere is caustic and full of doom, making it easy to believe that no one will indeed ""get out alive"". Yes, MALEVOLENCE was obviously put together by someone who loves the genre. It was fun to spot the tributes to TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (the bones and clashing cymbals) , FRIDAY THE 13TH 2 (the hood), and HALLOWEEN (music).

2218524,2,B0007LPSM2,"Malevolence (Stevan Mena, 2004)

Malevolence is another one of those movies I seem to be seeing a lot of recently that had all kinds of potential to be really, really good, but have one or more flaws so fatal that they drag the entire movie down. In this case, there is more than one flaw, but the one that really sealed the deal for me is the way the mystery angle is handled. There's a certain school of thought that you can keep viewers as much in the dark as you like as long as you explain everything at the end. Certain directors can pull it off well, but the more movies like this I see, the more I realize those directors are in the minority.

Plot: a bank robbery goes awry, and the four would-be robbers--Julian (Little Erin Merryweather's R. Brandon Johnson), Marylin (Threads' Heather Magee), Kurt (St. Trinian's' Richard Glover), and Sally (Pamela Marie Guida in her screen debut)--flee for an old house in the country. When they get there, they discover the house already occupied by the Harrisons, Samantha (Ultrachrist!'s Samantha Dark) and Courtney (Courtney Bertolone, also in her first screen appearance). Problem is, the Harrisons are being menaced by a rather warped individual named Martin (Seabiscuit's Jay Cohen). We learn in the opening scene that Martin suffered some serious trauma as a child, and it seems to have scarred him for life. (The whole story of the original trauma will pop up in the soon-to-be-released Bereavement, which has a much higher-powered cast; Michael Biehn and John Savage will be headlining.) From here, the rest of the film heads straight into the usual slasher-film territory.

It's nothing you haven't seen before, and that's a problem. The predictability factor works against a movie that could have done a lot in the way of subverting clich. Then, of course, there's Martin himself. I can see where the director was likely going with this, especially since he already had it in mind to film a prequel (Malevolence, it seems, is the middle film in a trilogy), but there's so much of the story missing here that the film feels unfinished. The other two pieces may make this into a brilliant piece of filmmaking, but as it stands, we only have the middle piece now, and the middle piece by itself leaves much to be desired. **",1260403200,2,2280,4.752525252525253
2218525,3,B0007LPSM2,"Well, well, well. Maybe slasher flicks aren't quite as dead as I thought they were. Or more specifically, 'good' slasher flicks. While big studios are busy remaking every old horror movie, checking them off as they go down the list, first-time director Stevan Mena poured himself into the neglected subgenre with his independent film, Malevolence. The hard work paid off, and Mena's seen his film make a successful limited theatrical run and a nice release from Anchor Bay.

Has there ever been a movie where a bank heist goes well? You'd think by now that someone would get it right for a change. In MALEVOLENCE, apparent seasoned law-breakers Max (Keith Chambers) and Kurt (Richard Glover) team up with Max's sister Marylin (Heather Magee) and her boyfriend Julian (Brandon Johnson) for a high-stakes robbery. The four of them do a better job than most Hollywood capers, but to balance out their (relatively) good work at the bank, they picked a very poor spot for their arranged meeting place. Like in real estate, hideouts are all about location, location, location. The abandoned house in the woods they chose makes for a poor one since it's a hop, skip, and a jump from a really irritable neighbor...with a big knife.

It's hard for me to believe that this is Mena's first feature film, but it is. The low budget isn't even noticeable. The first key was to film in 35mm, which automatically gives it a leg up on many indie movies these days. Mena then surrounded himself with a very good crew and a solid cast. I think it's safe to say that the director of photography, Tsuyoshi Kimoto, has a great career ahead of him. The movie 'looks' great all the way through and lighting is never a problem, as it seems to be in a lot of low-budget stuff. Production values look very high, mainly due to the great locations they found to shoot at. The slaughterhouse is an actual slaughterhouse that was shut down many years back, so its dilapidated state is absolutely perfect.

No gratuitous nudity. No excessive gore. No special effects bonanza. No deep underpinnings. Yet, a sack over the head hasn't looked this scary since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FRIDAY-THE-13TH-PART-2/dp/B00001MXXP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 2</a>! Why does it work? The script may be a little lukewarm, but Mena knows what he wants. It's simple and straightforward and a serious attempt to make a scary film. It doesn't try to be funny. It just wants to scare you. And often it does. It's the direction. It's the camerawork. It's the great sets. And it's the music, which Mena composed himself. The music is responsible for some of those jump scares, but those aren't the only scares. There's genuine tension being built up.

What doesn't work? Sure, the killer seems really attached to his knife. Really attached. He could have been a tad more inventive. Maybe just once he could have tried a hacksaw. Maybe a screwdriver (flat-head of course). How about a coat hanger? That'd be neat. Something else besides the knife! Other than the killer's reluctance to try new things, there's the obligatory I-don't-want-this-to-be-a-brainless-slasher explanation portion at the end of the film which was far too lengthy. It's making up for everything it didn't bother to explain earlier in the movie, but it didn't really need to. Or at least it could have been done a little more tersely. Just minor qualms, and nothing that should keep you from seeing it.

By the end of it all, MALEVOLENCE is sure to have conjured up images of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HALLOWEEN/dp/B00009UW0N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HALLOWEEN</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-TEXAS-CHAINSAW-MASSACRE/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE</a>, but you won't mind the similarities.

2218528,2,B0007LPSM2,"Malevolence is the story of 4 young bank robbers who flea to a rural safe home after robbing a huge metropolitan bank. En route, one of the thieves is forced to carjack a lady and her daughter at a gas station, and take them to the safe house. While at the house, one of the people that was taken hostage escapes, running to the neighbors home; the home of a hack and slash killer.

The setting and scenery in Malevolence was fun to watch. It was unique and eery. But outside of that, the story offers little. Samantha Dark holds the film together, and is the only actor who doesn't overact to the point that you want to scream. The rest of the cast is horrendous. Don't expect to see them again.

The movie was paced pretty good, but there weren't a lot of frights. I was scared at times, but never really on the edge of my seat. I think the reason I stayed immersed in the film was due to the setting, and Samantha Dark.

The killer was old school hack and slash, complete with the big butcher knife. There were many cheesy horror cliches used in the last 30 minutes.

Malevolence is a very sub-par movie in many ways. It is worth watching for the unique story and setting if you can tolerate horrible acting. It is by no means as good as most other horror films on the shelf, but worth watching for fans of the genre.

You will see it, remember some parts, and might even buy it if you like the unique aspects.

I had read an extremely inaccurate synopsis on the internet for this movie, but it had sounded good so I rented it. This movie is terrible. I've seen a lot of bad theatrical horror films, this movie doesn't even deserve a theatrical release. But, I must admit. It had a few good elements (hence, my 2 stars). The music (composed by writer & director Stevan Mena) is really good, like ""Halloween"" & ""Friday the 13th"" good. Some of the uses of the music during scenes where the killer appears are pretty effective. But this movie sucked from the beginning. It begins with a little kid (who we've already seen has been missing) watching a man kill a young girl in a basement/torture chamber. Then 10 years later,  we meets Kurt (Richard Glover), Marilyn (Heather Magee), Max (Keith Chambers), and Julian

(Brandon Johnson). Marilyn and Max are siblings. Marilyn and Julian are lovers. They four plan to rob a bank and after they do (apparently the budget wasn't big enough to film the robbery) Max is dead and Kurt is heading to the meeting spot, a secluded ""deserted"" house in the middle of nowhere.

When Max was shot, I was compelled to write a thank-you note to the writer,

because Keith Chambers is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. This man should be shot. Anyway, as Marilyn and Julian stop to bury Max's body. Kurt drives to the house when his tire blows. Kurt (dressed in the same jumpsuit he robbed the bank in and holding two bags of cash...What a dumb a$$) jacks a car that contains a young mother named Samantha (Samantha Dark) and her daughter Courtney (Courtney Bertolone). Why does Samantha have a English accent? Anyway, Kurt takes the young mother and daughter to the house, when Courtney manages to escape. Kurt runs after her, leaving Samantha in the house. Kurt ends up at another house (the setting of the torture chamber) and is killed. The killer takes one of Kurt's money bags and uses it as his mask. Marilyn and Julian then arrive at the meeting spot to find Samantha and most of their money missing. Insert next cliche here. Anyway, at the end of the movie we find out who the killer is. Never before have I known exactly what was going to happen before it did, writer Mena doesn't even bother to add something in at the end to make us go ""wow, now that's a twist."" Instead, after ""discovering"" the identity of the killer; we are given yet another ""I saw it forty minutes ago"" twist. I think Stevan Mena should stick to scoring horror films rather than writing them. Seriously, folks. Don't waste your time.

Not in the mood to purchase anything just killing time one afternoon and seen the packaging which caught my eye. I read the back and ask the guy if he seen it and he said he never heard of the movie before, so on that note and something telling me to buy it I did. Don't regret it a bit, for 8 bucks it was worth every dollar.

 Slow for a lot of persons out there whom like the newer cookie pattern horror; Scream, I know what you did...etc. But great for persons whom like to take there time to get there. This movie is a relief from today's standards and goes back to what horror/slasher films where slow low lighting basic plot and dialogue and cheap style camera work. And suspense building.

 Story takes place having Minersville Pa (20 min. ride from my house)being the back bone of a missing child in the late 80's and a bank robbery in today's time in Allentown Pa go wrong where two people are then hijacked and held hostage at remote location between Allentown and Bethlehem Pa where they thought was abandoned but don't realize that they are Victim's themselves to what lies ahead. Very well thought out with traces of Elm St., Halloween, Friday The 13, Amityville, The Shining etc. Enjoy and hope this helps in what I think is a rare gem.

 For those to note Allentown Pa is aprox. 25-30 minutes from Minersville if you get a little confused to the gap between the two places.",1136678400,,1487,4.330935251798561
2218544,3,B0007LPSM2,"[good things]

The movie, after starting off slow, was fast paced and quite suspenseful. The movie payed homage to old horror classics such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the slaughterhouse), Friday The 13th Part 2 and The Town That Dreaded Sundown (the sack head), A Nightmare On Elm Street (green and red walls in the slaughterhouse), and Sleepaway Camp (bug tape). You can tell that Stevan Mena is a huge fan of the genre classics.

The killer reminded me more of Jason in Friday The 13th part 2 with his mannerisms. He stalked and he hunted like Jason. There are also a few scenes that to me seemed like carbon copies of scenes in Friday The 13th Part 2. The acting, in my opinion, was also dead-on along with the directing.

[the bad]

The movie needed more blood and gore. It needed more killing. The whole bank robbery and 'up to the bank robbery' scenes were just too much. It slowed the movie down alot, and really had no significance to the actual plot.

The movie was unique in alot of ways, but the homage was a bit overdone in a few scenes. It seemed like a friday The 13th Part 2 remake in some of the scenes. I did like that, but when it comes down to it, they left a slight sour taste in my mouth.

[final thoughts]

This movie was so hyped prior to it's release. By watching trailers and checking the website periodically I was so anxious to see it. It's sad to say that when I did get around to see it that I was severely let down. I am not saying the movie sucked, it did not, but it was way to slow. I find myself trying to watch it and I can't and if I do I bump it up a few chapters to get to the part where the movie starts go speed up.

But, I really liked the killer, and the story behind him. I liked the references to horror classics, and I liked the soundtrack.

There were hints of a sequel, and I would really like to see it. Hopefully they can fix the mistakes they made in this one and improve.",1136246400,6,1923,4.1617250673854445

Long ago, there was a series of child disappearances in the area.  The plant is not abandoned, there is a madman on the loose and he is pleased to find fresh victims.

'Malevolence' is an okay movie, if you are a fan of horror flicks.  It's pretty typical, Jasonesque hunter and hunted playtime.  The best filming is done in the old plant, especially the kitchen and bathroom tub scenes that look very similar to my first boyfriend's apartment.

The sets are good, the photography decent, the editing a bit choppy in places, and the acting vaguely wooden.  But its worth a rent.  The worst aspect was the cheesy finishing line from the local cop, ""Overlooked, like a tree in a cornfield.""  Blech.

2218568,3,B0007LPSM2,"If I'm not familiar with a movie, I'll usually visit The Internet Movie Database website to get the skinny before buying...with regards to the low budget, independent film Malevolence (2004), there seems to an awful lot of ten star reviews all saying the same thing, about how this movie is a `return to the genre' (meaning the horror genre), a homage to movies like Psycho and Halloween, etc.  Usually when I see something like that, I chalk it up to reviews posted by people who have a particular interest in seeing the DVD sales do well, or, perhaps friends of director...regardless, I decided to give it a chance...and I have to say, it wasn't as great as the glowing reviews stated (I didn't think it would be), but it wasn't that bad, either...especially considering it was Stevan Mena's first effort (he produced, wrote, and directed the film).  Appearing in the film is Samantha Dark (Life & Times: Harry Otter), R. Brandon Johnson (""One Life to Live""), Heather Magee (Garmento), Courtney Bertolone, Richard Glover (Arizona Heat), and Keith Chambers (Hitch).

As the movie begins some text is displayed on the screen indicating the year is 1989, and how hundreds of thousands of children go missing each year, some found, some not...and then it speaks of one particular boy, and how he disappeared while playing in his backyard.  We then cut to a scene where a young woman is hanging from the ceiling of a dilapidated room (looks like a basement), chains around her wrists, and a shadowy figure enters with a large bag with something moving inside...perhaps it's a sackful of puppies?  Nope...it's a young boy (I'm guessing the one that was referred to earlier), revealed as the man removes the bag, apparently so the boy could witness the bit of nastiness to follow...fast forward about ten years and we see two men, Max (Chambers) and Kurt (Glover) talking about a job (in a graveyard, of all places), the inference being some type of armed robbery, to which afterwards Max returns to a motel to inform a couple, Julian (Johnson) and his girlfriend Marylin (Magee), who also happens to be Max's sister, that the robbery is going down the next day.  Turns out it's a bank job, and it does go down, but not necessarily as planned as Max gets shot in the gut.  The crooks split up, Kurt, who has all the money, in one car, the rest in another, the plan now being to meet up at an isolated location and split the dough...along the way gut wound Max bites it, and Kurt picks up a couple of hostages in a mother (Dark) and daughter (Bertolone), and eventually all (except Max) end up at a deserted, rundown house, but it turns out they're not alone, as there's someone living in another deserted, rundown house nearby, someone whose not quite right...and by that I mean he be into killing (he got the killing jones, if you will), which may explain why the all the houses in the area are deserted...

Okay, I did see a number of references to horror films of the past, some of the more noticeable ones being The Amityville Horror (the exterior of one of the houses looked very similar to the house featured in that film), Halloween (the killer who survives many injuries), Night of the Living Dead (well, I won't tell you which part, but you'll know it when you see it), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (victims suspended from ceiling, awaiting a gristly and violent end and usage of bones for interior decorating), Friday the 13th Part 2 (the killer donning a sack on his head) and so on...which made me wonder if this was really an homage, or someone just ripping off scenes from popular and influential horror films of the past and stringing them together with a somewhat lame storyline to create a new film (it leaned slightly more towards the latter, in my opinion).  To me, homage is a respectful acknowledgement, not necessarily pilfering what others have done in very obvious fashion perhaps due to a lack of originality (did anyone see Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake of Psycho?)...I thought the direction by Mena was very strong and skillful, especially given this was his first film.  He knows how to set up shots, create some suspense and tension, and I'd be interested in seeing him direct another film because I think he's got a lot of potential, but perhaps a film written by someone else, as that's where I felt the most weaknesses, in the plot, characters, and dialog (so much time was wasted on the setup to the point where we didn't really even see the killer, who was rather goofy, until about 45 minutes into the film).  The actors did okay (nothing spectacular, but a lot better than expected), it's just their characters felt unsubstantiated, and I didn't find myself making connections to any of them, which resulted in my not really caring if they got whacked...in those other films I mentioned, each fostered an emotional investment from the audience towards the characters which developed a sense of dread from implicit dangers they faced.  And some aspects didn't really make sense, other than the fact they were obvious plot devices to get a particular character alone so that they could be put into danger...perfect example is when Julian decides to drive off in the dark looking for Kurt (Kurt arrived at the house first), who's gone missing, leaving Marylin all alone.  Where the hell would Kurt have gone, especially since the vehicle he arrived in was still by the house?  Yeah, it wasn't the same car he left the robbery in, but Julian and Marylin had already deduced that Kurt had probably switched cars along the way...and I especially loved the bright idea of letting Kurt take all the money from the scene of the crime by himself, while the other three drive off in a separate vehicle, because it's not like Kurt would've run off with the half a million dollar haul...nah...besides, Marylin said Kurt was too afraid of Max to screw them over like that...yeah, whatever...if I was in a situation like that with a half a million dollars it would be `Vaya con dios, suckers'...and I'll tell you what, as far as Max getting shot in the gut, it sure didn't seem like it was all that painful...especially if you've seen the film Reservoir Dogs (1992).  Remember Tim Roth's character?  And I have to say, Marylin didn't seem to take it all that hard when her brother Max croaked (rather quickly, considering gut shots usually involve a long and painful demise)...but, perhaps I'm being too nit picky...there are some scares to be had here, along with some creepy atmospherically spooky fun, capped off poorly by a huge and clunky expository/revelation dumperoo near the end...

This Anchor Bay Entertainment Divimax Special Edition DVD features a very sharp and detailed widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, picture along with matching Dolby Digital Surround 5.1 audio.  One thing with regards to the audio...I noticed at points where the musical scoring (which was very strong) would drown out the dialog at certain points.  There are bunches of extra features including a commentary track with the director, one of the actors (Johnson), and associate producer Eddie Akmal, rehearsal footage (1:19), a featurette titled Back to the Slaughterhouse (31:33), deleted scenes, trailers, TV and radio spots, a still gallery, the original screenplay on DVD-ROM, and previews for other Anchor Bay DVD releases like Evil Dead (1981), Halloween (1978), Hellraiser (1987), Dead & Breakfast (2004), and The Card Player (2004).  All in all an excellent release of a mediocre movie.

This movie feels like it came out years ago, and it's a good horror flick, and true to the slasher flick genre.  The musical score is awesome, it totally reminds you of the old slasher flicks, and in some ways the musical score is a total rip off of Halloween and Friday the 13th.  Which in my book is a big positive.  The only thing I would have changed about this movie is the whole robbery/criminals aspect.  I would have gone with the old school guys and gals partying, drinking, doing drugs, having sex, and getting killed off one by one.  Because everything else in the movie is done so well.  If they stuck to that formula it would have been even better than what it is.  That said, if you dig the older style slasher flicks, then this movie is a nice little gem.  If you think those movies suck, and you thought ""White Noise"" was great; stick to that crap.  You shouldn't consider yourself a horror aficianado.

Director/writer Steven Mena obviously respected John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN as much of this film pays homage to that 1978 classic.  Although not quite the caliber of HALLOWEEN, MALEVOLENCE nevertheless brings on some tense scares, thanks to its haunting imagery and an eerie score by Mr. Mena himself (another tribute to composer/director Carpenter).  While derivative of other stalker films, this movie manages to engage us in the story of a trio of bank robbers who make the mistake of arranging their rendezvous at a spooky house.  We're introduced early on to the disappearance of 6 year old Martin Bristol, and then ten years later, we're reintroduced to quite a different Martin.  While the performances may not be Oscar-caliber, Brandon Johnson as Julian, Samantha Dark as the kidnapped mama, and Heather Magee as the doomed Marilyn all do their best in keeping the viewer interested.

2218571,2,B0007LPSM2,"Hey Yall,  im writing this review to warn people about the pro's and con's of MALEVOLENCE, 1st let me start off by saying(and im not trying to glorify myself) i think i know a thing or two about horror movies, being fans of true horror fim creators like, fulci,romero,carpenter,argento etc...,  knowing how a horror film should be made,. in any case heres the review, prior to MALEVOLENCE'S release i heard so many praises to this movie about how ""it pays homage to the 70's horror genre"" and all that junk, i found the trailer online and i wasn't impressed at all , in my head i said to myself it looks weak but non the less the day it came out i bought it, excited to see the hype that surrounded it,  then about an hour and a half later THOROUGHLY dissapointed.

 Heres why: this sounds way closeminded and ignorant but i am into movies that have great gore scenes and lots of bloodshed(not that a movie needs blood and gore to be a good movie), and there was basically no blood at all in this movie, so the gore and blood factor isn't even an issue here, 2nd the acting was very bad, the actors tried to hard to make thier characters believable and that didn't work out for them, 3rd the movies pace is WAY to slow.

 The CONS of the movie: The setting was great, the old slaughterhouse and farm was a great choice of location, especially whatever season they shot the movie in, it complimented the setting greatly in addition to being nicelooking already. 2nd the score of the movie added to the creepy setting of the film, the sound effects as well were a plus, 3rd: some camera shots were nicely done

oh i also forgot to mention that the killer in the movie was very lame and unoriginal wearing a pillow case over his head? although the idea of the kidnapped martin brolin watching his abductee comit murders in front of his eyes and following in his footsteps is a cool idea.

I will admit the movie did give me a feeling that i don't get from every movie i watch,the movie also is growing on me and i find myself wanting to watch it again here and there, but over all don't belive the hype of this movie and rent it before you buy, heres a list of some movies you all should check out before you even contemplate watching this, Mutilation Man,Man Bites Dog,The Deadly Spawn,Re-Animator,Near Dark,The Manson Family,Suspiria,The Last Horror Movie,Dead End,",1116892800,,2364,4.466357308584687

And I still don't understand.

Why are we bashing Malevolence? Detour, The Hazing, and The Amityville Horror remake have better customer ratings than Malevolence.

Malevolence bashers: Does this strike you as odd?

Honestly, I loved this movie. I thought this was a scary, smart homage to Halloween that found a series of effective scares and a gorgeous sense of atmosphere. Don't tell me you weren't impressed by the killer's lair. Ordinary junk has never seemed so threatening. And the Bone Deer...What a beautiful piece of work. It's the kind of minimalistic and brutally effective set piece that's been missing from modern horror. The masters of horror recognize the impact moments like this have. They get under your skin. I'm not saying Steven Mena is a Carpenter or Argento. But I think some of you would agree that he shows great promise. In his first outing, he created a film that has jumps, whose meanacing presence lingers when the film is over. These days, most Hollywood releases go for one or the other. I love the B-Movie Horror Flick as much as the next guy, but it's great to see a film that strips horror down to it's core quality: Primal Fear. I haven't been this excited by a small horror movie since Session 9.

Let's give Mena credit where credit is due. If you all want nothing but B-Movie, direct to video horror / Japanese imports (or poor American remakes of) for the rest of your lives, that's cool. But it's time to recognize that some directors are trying to give horror it's good name back, regardless of how successful we think they are (and on that, we all seem to differ.)

2218573,1,B0007LPSM2,"I was devastated after watching this film. Why? How? What do I have to do to get the scripts that I've written to film?

I've been writing for a few years now and constantly my scripts are ripped apart for minor illogical incidents. Yet, nothing as ridiculous and riddled as MALEVOLENCE.

AND THIS MOVIE HAS WON AWARDS!!

Where do I go? Where do I sign? How can I get my script turned into a movie?

Wow. Where do I start? First of all. MALEVOLENCE is Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Psyco, House of Wax, etc. etc. I don't mean, it's like them, it is them. The stories. The camera shots. The music. Complete rip-offs. You will see absolutely nothing new by watching Malevolence.

I understand that this is a first film by the director and the actors, but the acting is so over-delivered by everyone. Horrible scripting.

An argument before a bank robbery over the fact that the girl wanted a Snow White mask instead of the Werewolf mask. Completely unnecessary. An argument in a script to get across that the people are wearing characters masks... is not needed when you can see it visually.

A mother and her daughter are abducted and despite the fact that the daughter is able to wiggle from her restraints and run free, the mother can't. Yet, the mother, after watching her daughter run away being chased by a murderer and watching a brutal murder... she is apparently narcoleptic because she manages to SLEEP! Soundly... numerous times.

She also manages to wiggle her way into a closed closet, despite having her hands tied behind her back.

The mother knows there is a crazed knife wielding murderer out there and her daughter is missing, yet she never gets emotional until she finds her daughters shoe.  Then, she whimpers, for a second and they cut to the next shot and she's fine again.

Oh, of course, the knife wielding murderer slaughters everyone he comes in contact with, but of course he decides only to restrain the ONE guy who can save the day.

Just because you turn the music up really loud every time GUNNYSACK face appears in the woods, doesn't make it scary.

Neither is a wall display of bones and a large animal head. Which is never explained... I might add.

Our killer is a major weeney who gets cold-cocked by a 12 year old girl and knocked out by a chair to... HIS BACK?

At the end of the film, the camera is set on a close up of 2 officers who says things to elude that they are looking upon a devastatingly huge amount of corpses and the numerous amount of missing person cases to be solved... and the camera pulls out to show 7 bodies. An 8th is brought out.

I'm sorry. Lately I've been really upset at the weak quality of movies that we are being subjected to. There are so much better scripts and movies to be made out there and the studios aren't looking past themselves and their friends and it's appalling.

There are many many many writers out there with original ideas and far better scripts. PLEASE STUDIOS... look harder!! FIND THESE PEOPLE AND QUIT CHEATING US with run of the mill trash.",1116460800,6,3052,4.54014598540146
2218574,3,B0007LPSM2,"This film is a return to the halcyon days of the 80's slasher era.  Everything has an 80's vibe to it from the cheesy music, stilted acting, cheap camerawork.  Was this intentional?  If not, I feel a little sorry for Mena but if you grew up in that era like I did then Malevolence is a nice little treat.  Mena's style reminds me of Dante Tomaselli, another talented indie horror filmmaker.  Both are capable of instilling genuine dread and a creepy atmosphere despite what is an obvious micro-budget.  If done well, movies like this make things look even scarier since the cheap film quality makes it look so REAL.

The opening scene shows us 6-year-old Martin Bristol in 1989 being kidnapped and having to witness his kidnapper brutally murder a woman.  Bristol is reported missing and never seen again.  Flash forward 10 years later: In a nearby town, a group of bank robbers pull a heist, highjack a vehicle with woman and son in tow and high-tail it into the countryside.  Little do they know that they have stumbled into the home of Martin Bristol, now all grown up and a full-fledged killer.

Admittedly, &#8220;Malevolence&#8221; is derivative of many slasher films most notably Halloween, Psycho and TCM.  The bank-robbers stumbling into the wrong house plot also bears a strange resemblance to another recent movie named &#8220;Dead Birds&#8221;.  However, I refuse to slam the movie because of this.  If anyone cared to watch the special features section, they would hear Steven Mena acknowledge that his film resembles past slashers and say that he was intentionally paying homage to them.  I totally agree with Mena's point that anyone who makes a slasher these days risks making a derivative movie since the genre has been done to death.  Which, when you think about it, makes Carpenter's Halloween such a powerful achievement in retrospect.  Released over 25 years ago, it has been studied, manipulated and copied to death yet none of those imitators are able to make a film as scary or as powerful as Carpenter's.  Mena's film is no exception.

So no this is not a terribly original movie but it does qualify as a creepy, suspenseful entry in a well-worn genre.  There is however one thing I find original in this film: we actually get to see &#8220;behind the mask&#8221;, the villain's face at the end of the movie in a close-up that lasts for several seconds.  Nice touch.

The special features are an immense treat: we get cast member interviews, deleted scenes, a photo gallery, rehearsal footage, trailers for several of the horror classics that Mena was inspired from such as &#8220;Halloween&#8221;, &#8220;Evil Dead&#8221; and &#8220;Hellraiser&#8221; and last but not least a half-hour feature on the making of the film which profiles the actors, set locations and Mena's acknowledgment of having used several slasher films as influences in what stands as an extremely interesting look into indie DIY filmmaking.  Steven Mena's exactly the type of passionate horror geek the genre needs more of.  Give his film a try, you just might like what you'll see.",1115683200,,3080,4.947470817120623

This whole thing stunk.  Funny thing is though, watch the featurette to the director praise himself on every detail of the movie you found either really annoying or just plain awful.

I know we the horror genre audience owe a great debt to Anchor Bay Entertainment, but you have to keep it honest, and honestly these reviews are giving this film too much credit.

2218576,3,B0007LPSM2,"One thing I did like about this movie was it really tried to bring back some of the old atmosphere of the 80's horror movies. Good old slasher flicks. They even used the same eerie dated sound effects, similar build ups, and story lines. Pretty much In same fashion as the original Halloween or Friday the 13th movies. However, that's about all the good it has. (1)  It incorporates the annoying sound variation you hear in all these new horror movies. By that I mean in one scene the characters are mumbling and hard to hear, so you turn it up to hear what they are saying, then in the next scene  when something ""scary"" is supposed to happen, the sound BLAST your TV set off the entertainment center. This is annoying to me, sounds aren't scary to me, just aggravating because I have to play volume tag with my remote. (2) when I seen the movie trailer  for this, I was thinking it looked professional, but when I started watching it, it definitely seemed a little more generic than the previews. A lot of the actors and actress where bad. What your left with is an ""above average budge"" horror movie picture with very ""low budget"" actors. The contrast was very strange to me and very noticeable. (3) There is no new territory covered in this movie. The only new concept is the victims are bank robbers. Otherwise the movie borrows ideas from just about every other horror movie ever made. It is also loaded with tons of horror clich&eacute;s. You all know them: people tripping and falling when the killer is chasing them, killer not dying after several blows to the head and body, and then laying there while ""playing dead"" . This movie has it all. Which leads me to my next critique (4) Not only does this movie borrow ideas, it completely stole ideas from Friday the 13th. I think it stole to the point that I'm surprised they aren't getting sued! The killer spends most of the movie warring a bag over his head. Before Jason took on the famous hockey mask, this is exactly what he did in the early FTT movies. The killer also has his exact outfit, his exact boots, and even Jason's exact weapon of choice  (5) Finally, not a major complaint, but its one of my personal complaints: I call it the actor to body ratio. Basically, for example, if you start a movie off with 4-5 people, then you know  (most likely) you are not going to see more than 4 or 5 deaths in the movie. Therefore, you can usually tell how slow a horror movie is going to be based on this ratio. I knew when the movie started off with 4-5 people it wasn't going to be very fast paced, and there wasn't going to be a lot of slash'n if you will. The movie has its moments, but it doesn't rake up the body count like in the old 80's horror movies it is trying to model itself after.

NOTE: By the way, to anyone that gave this 1 star:
You have no clue what a bad horror movie looks like. You haven't been around the block enough times to see a bad one. If you disagree with me, try renting one of these titles: ""666 demon child, ring of darkness,ancient evil 2""",1114560000,,3035,4.334507042253521

We have a child killer (Remember Micheal Meyers)who grows up to be a grown up killer.(Sorry if I spoiled it for you) Who senselessly hacks anyone who gets in the way. The music is almost identical to that of Halloween Oh yeah I almost forgot. The killer wears a mask. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE!",1114473600,,424,4.51948051948052

It pays homage to Friday The 13th Part 2 and Halloween mostly but has some Texas Chainsaw Massacre elements to it as well.
