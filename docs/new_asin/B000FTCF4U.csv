8126448,5,B000FTCF4U,"I won't give a professionally styled review as some others have. I saw the film via our downtown library, and I was captivated by the drama. Someone else referred to this film as ""slow (paced)"", but I disagree. It's long, with a time around the two hour mark. However, on my first viewing of the film, I wanted more. At the end, I actually thought it was a much shorter film.

This is a well-directed, dramatic look at love and the transitions that both a husband and wife go through.
""The struggle is real.""

I was impressed by the things the wife...puts up with, for the sake of her husband.",1443916800,,593,4.381818181818182
8126449,3,B000FTCF4U,"The movie is in French, which I was not aware of when I rented it, however I was able to turn English subtitles on. This drama takes place in the 1930s and is from a Belgian filmmaker. It is unfortunate that she doesn't leave her husband as he is abusive and controlling. The film is not rated, but would probably be rated R.",1300492800,,325,4.174603174603175
8126450,3,B000FTCF4U,"When I read that the film was based on a novel written in 1937 by a Belgian woman it made a lot more sense to me.  Obviously this is pre-Feminist stuff.  A woman of today would scream at the self-denying sacrifices this poor woman made in order to hang on to the marriage to this loutish, selfish creep.  If you can stomach that, and if you are a big lover of French films of the hyper-arty type, then you might like this movie.  Actually I am a long time lover of French cinema but I find that some of the more recent films don't live up to the earlier wonders of the Nouvelle Vague. I place this one in that category.

What is wonderful in Gilles' Wife is the cinematography.  I also loved the costumes---very beautiful, but unrealistic, I felt for the situation.  Would such a poor housewife have such lovely, lace bordered nightgowns?  Everyone wore beautiful, hand knit sweaters and adorable knitted hats.  The younger sister, a mere shopgirl, managed to dress up quite well and the little girls wore clothes that I doubt a mere factory worker could afford.  Gilles' wife does have a sewing machine, though, so perhaps that's just another of her many virtues.  I'm quibbling here and actually the visuals kept me watching it; otherwise I think I would have quit way before the end.

I did like the story and perhaps the novel is worth reading.  It could have been told in half the time, though.  The choice to have very little dialogue and many, many, (many!) close ups of the face of Gilles' wife was just too self consciously arty for my taste.

For all of the intensity of the drama, I felt absolutely unmoved by the ending.  This is a woman whose internal and external life have been meticulously (and...slowly) displayed to the viewer for almost two hours, and yet it didn't involve me emotionally in the least.  I think they just tried too hard.  The actress ""telegraphed"" her feelings so strongly that there was nothing left to the imagination.  In real life, people don't show everything they are feeling to that degree.

I was surprised at the high ratings given here, but not surprised that only a few people have seen it.  I guess you could conclude that it's a film that a very few people will like a lot.",1222300800,2,2222,4.518796992481203
8126451,5,B000FTCF4U,"I'm not going to write a review that sums up the story; you can read that in the product description or on the back of the box at your local Blockbuster.  Instead, I'm going to appraise the film itself.

La Femme de Gilles is one of my absolute most favorite French films, ever.  It's poignant and moving; you can't help but be drawn in by the incredible plot.  The cinematography is stunning, second only to the sumptuous lighting.  The casting is superb: Devos' tired eyes speak bounds; Cornillac's round face perfectly portrays his ultimately childish character; and Smet is beautifully deceptive.

The most common complaint, however, is that there isn't a lot of dialogue.  And, this is true.  However, it's not necessary to speak; Emanuelle's expressive eyes and Mona Lisa smile convey all that the audience need know.",1170374400,6,823,4.913043478260869
8126452,5,B000FTCF4U,"'La Femme de Gilles' ('Gilles' Wife') began as a novel by Madeleine Bourdouxhe and was transformed for the screen by Philippe Blasband, Marion H&auml;nsel  and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Fonteyne who also directs this stunning and controversial art piece.  Certainly one of the most visually magnificent films of recent years (cinematographer Virginie Saint-Martin) 'Gilles' Wife' succeeds on every level: the story is unique, the direction is liquid and languorous, and the cast is superlative.

Elisa (the remarkably sensitive Emmanuelle Devos) lives with her husband Gilles in what appears to be a perfect marriage: Elisa is the doting but sincerely in love housewife who spends her days caring for their twin daughters, cleaning house, cooking special meals, canning berry jams, keeping her husband satisfied sexually; Gilles (Clovis Cornillac) appears to be a loving husband, tender with Elisa, enamored with her, and content.  Elisa has a younger attractive sister Victorine (Laura Smet) who visits  this haven-like household frequently to see her nieces and almost from the start  we sense there is an attraction between Gilles and Victorine.  Elisa becomes pregnant with their third child and Gilles grows a bit distant.  Elisa gradually acknowledges the fact that he is having an affair with Victorine and though hurt by the deception she decides the only way to keep Gilles is to allow him to discuss the matter with her. Patiently she listens to his fears that Victorine may have another lover and in fact allows Elisa to stalk Victorine to substantiate the affair.  Elisa accomplishes her mission and Gilles is devastated with the truth, all the while paying little attention to the emotional sacrifices Elisa is making on his behalf.  There are confrontations, Elisa even seeks out a priest to help her in resolving her pain but the priest doesn't pay attention and Elisa is left with silence.  When eventually the affair between Gilles and Victorine ends Elisa has given birth to a son, accepts Gilles' remorse, and ultimately in her own quiet way finds a mode of redemption for her trials with an unfaithful husband.

The fact the Elisa is content to be just 'Gilles' wife' instead of maintaining her dignity is hard to swallow at first but in Emmanuelle Devos' gifts as an actress we are made to understand her choices.  The triad of actors here are amazingly fine and they are directed with graceful sensitivity by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Fonteyne.  As an extra on the DVD there is an extended conversation with Fonteyne who shares some of the deleted scenes - this viewer only wishes there were not deleted! - and gives one of the more intelligent surveys of a film's story and progress on record.  The visual painting of the scenes is so very beautiful that each frame could be a canvas.  This is an impressively fine and deeply moving film.  Highest recommendation.

8126454,4,B000FTCF4U,"One of the great pleasures of ""Gilles Wife"" is watching the incredible Emmanuelle Devos as she observes, listens to or reacts to others with her huge, limpid eyes. She has the manner, carriage and of course, the powers of observation of a great silent film star...Mary Pickford or Lillian Gish come to mind which is entirely appropriate in this film in that director Frederic Fonteyne (""An Affair of Love"") has chosen to film much of ""Gilles Wife"" without dialogue.
Based on a 1937 Belgian novel by Madeleine Bourdouxhe, Devos plays Elisa, a country housewife and mother who fears her rough-hewn husband (Clovis Cornillac) is having an affair with her beautiful younger sister Victorine (Laura Smet). Ever the committed and devout wife: Elisa stoops to spy on her sister to assuage her husband's fears that Victorine has several lovers. But though this may sound like debasement, because Elisa's Love for Gilles is all encompassing and without limits or pride her devotion instead becomes transcendent.
""Gilles Wife"" is well directed and beautifully photographed and provides yet another opportunity to bask in the talent and heat that is Devos.",1151712000,12,1145,5.161290322580645
