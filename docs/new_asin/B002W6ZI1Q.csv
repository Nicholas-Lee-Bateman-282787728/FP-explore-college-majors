8382886,3,B002W6ZI1Q,Interesting but I believe that this man is not a psychopath he is a narcissist. It all adds to my knowledge.,1400371200,2,108,4.190476190476191
8382887,4,B002W6ZI1Q,"i'm a licensed professional counselor, and i have had occasion recently to find material that could succinctly capture the mental process and manipulative machinations of antisocial personality disorder. this video does a great job of highlighting this chilling disorder. i highly recommend viewing this film, but be prepared to feel slimed, just like ian did in the making of it. it's dreadful to know that there are people out there who seems to be devoid of the characteristics that make us most human.

please note: when i first put the dvd in my dvd player, i got an error message, and i thought i wasn't going to be able to view the film. (this may have something to do with dvd players being programmed to play dvd's from certain regions but not others?) but when i inserted it into my laptop dvd drive, it worked, and i was able to view it on my big screen by using an hdmi cable.

then, 40 minutes into the 55 minute documentary, the playback froze, and i had to shut it down, and then fast forward past the frozen point to get it to play again.",1368489600,3,1054,4.455958549222798
8382888,5,B002W6ZI1Q,"I watched this amazing documentary on Australia's ABC website last night and was blown away. I had suspected there was something very wrong with a man I knew and now I have an answer.

Huge thank you to Ian for putting his very personality on the line to make this documentary. You're a very brave man.",1270252800,19,302,4.392857142857143
