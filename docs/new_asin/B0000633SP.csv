7958518,5,B0000633SP,"This is one of SWV's earlier releases and is out of print as of this review(as is all of Harry Novak DVD's released under Something Weird Video). So the prices will be inflated. The two main features in this DVD include Kidnapped Co-ed and Hitch Hike to Hell.

Hitch Hike to Hell(88 mins/1977): The story involves a loony deliveryman driving around in an old beat-up van and while making deliveries always happens to pick up young and reasonably attractive female hitch hikers(save for one fruit-cake). They always manage to not notice anything strange about the guy. The conversation starts out innocently enough, but when the young women mention ""running away"", the dorky deliveryman starts going bonkers and the rest is history. This psycho lives with his over-attentive mom and one of the cops chasing after him is ""The Professor"" from Gilligan's Island.

Kidnapped Coed(76 mins/1977): A rich coed girl is snatched up for ransom by a cold looking ransomer  who has to constantly call and check up on his elderly mom from some isolated payphone out in the middle of nowhere. Eventually the girl ""falls in love"" with her captor and requests that he make passionate love to her. While waiting for the ransom to appear, they run into some odd lunatics in the back woods.

There's three trailers which include Hitch Hike to Hell(2:26), Kidnapped Coed(1:44), and Kidnapped Lover(0:59). There's also a Gallery of Exploitation Art & Greatest Hits Soundtrack(5:19) with posters of old Novak movies with 60's/70's era music. And my favorite is 'Harry Novak Box Office International'(27:04/1992) where the owner of Something Weird Video visits Harry at his Hollywood location and gets a grand tour.

Lastly there is three short subject films. 'The Hitch Hiker'(3:24) is B&W and features a blonde chick cruising around in an old automobile while a narrator extols the virtue of driving and the open road.  When her car breaks down, she has trouble hitching a ride until she begins shedding some clothes. 'The Dangerous Stranger'(10:21) is a propaganda scare film that used to be shown in schools to scar the minds of young innocents(or bore them to sleep). And 'The Cautious Twins'(4:19) is an animated scare film featuring a set of boy/girl twins who seem to encounter a predator in every corner of the neighborhood.

Of the two main features, I definitely enjoyed Hitch Hike to Hell a lot more. The movie just has that bizarre ""what the hell?"" vibe I sometimes get when I watch low-budget oddball flicks from the 60's and 70's. Kidnapped Coed is alright but certain parts of the movie seem to drag on a bit. Keep in mind this is just my personal preference and taste. Overall this is one of the better collections from Something Weird Video.",1382745600,2,2735,4.919739696312364
7958519,4,B0000633SP,"Something weird has put two really strange films together here. The first is Hitch Hike To Hell in which a deranged man in a dry cleaning delivery van kidnaps women who are hitchhiking and then proceeds to rape and kill them. There is a shocking murder of a child (it isn't seen on screen) that really has an impact. Russell Johnson (Professor on Gilligan's Island) is a policeman assigned to the case. Very odd, but well made film.
The second film is Kidnapped Coed, and this is a film about a kidnapped girl who falls in love with her captor, and he with her. They go on a crime spree together. A great twist ending to this one. The extras are good on this disc, but the highlight is a tour thru Harry Novac's Boxoffice International studios. That is a great 30 minutes. All in all a great disc well worth the money.",1044403200,5,818,4.352941176470588
7958520,5,B0000633SP,"One of the best discs yet released by SWV, this little beauty sports two awesome features and a slew of even better extras.  ""Hitchhike to Hell"" is undoubtedly the weaker of the two features, but is nonetheless a laugh riot.  The lead actor veers from one extreme to another with such scenery-chewing abandon as to be a marvel unto himself.  Half the time he's acting like Lenny from an ""Of Mice and Men"" production staged by a particularly talentless community theater.  The other half of the running time finds him screaming and going as psycho as Norman Bates would have had ""Psycho"" really sucked.  ""Kidnapped Coed"" is a much better film.  The acting (particularly from Friedle regular Jack Cannon) is solid.  The story manages to be fairly compelling in its own pulpy way and some of the scenes are actually quite remarkable.  Though pacey and far from perfect, it is a solid piece of work from an underappreciated director.  As for the extras, I must crown the animated short ""The Cautious Twins"" as King of School Scare Cinema.  This rhyme-narrated little ditty follows the titular twins as they play in the park, attend a movie and walk the streets in what has to qualify as the most depraved town in America.  These poor kids can't go two feet without confronting yet another touch-feely stranger offering candy or a free ride.  Hilarious!",1026864000,4,1348,4.787878787878788
