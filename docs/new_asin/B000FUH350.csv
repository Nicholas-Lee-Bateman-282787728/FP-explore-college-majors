2589080,5,B000FUH350,"The show's opening credits wears its influences very much on its sleeve with a very slick, jazzy feel reminiscent, in look, of the ones for Catch Me If You Can with the music segueing into a trip-hop-ish score much like the one David Holmes composed for Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven remake.

Hustle is beautifully shot so that each episode is like a slickly produced mini-movie - imagine Ocean's Eleven: The Movie. The show uses freeze frames, messes with camera speeds, uses inventive camera angles and even has a character break the fourth wall and address the camera or otherwise call attention to the fact that we're watching a television program.

The show examines what motivates these grifters. Sure, it's the thrill and challenge of fleecing some rich mark but it is also avoiding the drudgery of working a boring, soulless 9 to 5 job. These people are keen observers of human nature. They know how to gain someone's confidence and take their money while avoiding being caught by the victim and the authorities. And in a refreshing change of pace, this group doesn't always succeed every time out and we see what happens when a mark gets wise when one of the con artists screws up. As Hustle progresses through this first season, it gradually delves more into the personal lives of the main characters and their inter-personal relationships.

The first disc includes ""Assembling the Team Part 1,"" a making of featurette. This extra goes through the show's origins, casting and characters with the cast talking about working with each other in a very informative way that is great for those new to this show.

The second disc features the second part to ""Assembling the Team"" with each of the main cast members gush about each other in this engaging look at how this show came together.

Finally, there are well-written biographies on the main cast members.",1160092800,5,1870,4.886435331230284
2589081,5,B000FUH350,Let me just say that this is the best program I have ever seen on TV - and I've been watching TV for many years.  And the music in surround sound is magnificent.  I'm going to get the DVD asap.,1158796800,3,193,3.8

2589083,5,B000FUH350,"What do you get when you put five smart,cunning and charming con people together?.Well,what happens is(hang on to your wallets folks)cause you get 'Hustle'.Hustle the new BBC and AMC television show now on DVD.Hustle tells the story of five con people,or should I say con artist. And our lovable con artist are.

Some of the episodes have a tendency to hit you with a little suprise at the end. So be on the lookout for it. It's one of the things I like about the show. So in since the audience is con right along with the mark. I really wacthing this show. And I always make it a point to watch the long verison(the DVD set contains the long versions)of the show instead of the short ones. Following the adventures of these con artists can be very enjoyable. And in season one. We get to see them put the con on a manipulative art gallery owner,an arrojant fairground owner and a greedy businessman. And they also manage to save a businessmans business as well. Some of the guest stars on season one are Orla Brady,James Laurenson and Tamzin Outhwaite. Yes!!The Con Is On.

2589085,5,B000FUH350,"This show is fantastic 5 stars all the way.

But as the review states, be careful.  I had read over on Amazon UK that the first series dvd had been cut.  It was a mistake and it has been fixed...for them.  I am not sure if these are uncut, but one would have to assume so.  Even if they are cut...the series is still worth a look.",1156291200,3,330,3.8656716417910446
2589086,5,B000FUH350,"I started watching this show long before ""Thief"" and ""Heist"" came along, both of which served up in-your-face violence and the dregs of humanity.  ""Hustle"" is a class act, and gets its highest marks from the quality of the cast, writing, and lack of gunplay (owing to the Brits' staunch anti-gun laws).  All of which goes to show that alluring stars and creative writing can out-wit, out-play, and out-last any flash-in-the-pan also-ran.  I do want to see what Ray Liotta has to offer in this fall's ""Smith.""  Maybe it will give Hustle the only run for its money out there.  In the meantime, I look forward to re-playing the cons of Mickey and his gang on season one's DVD set.",1154822400,4,677,4.608333333333333
2589087,5,B000FUH350,"This is as good as it gets on TV. The acting is tops, the plot line is always a surprise, and the editing can't be beat. In the final analysis, the con is on the viewer since it is difficult, if not impossible to anticipate the conclusion. I'm enjoying the 3rd season currently and will love the replay of the 1st season on the arrival of my DVD's. I can't wait to order the 2nd season DVD's when available.",1152662400,17,407,4.1645569620253164
2589088,5,B000FUH350,I originally watched this show because Robert Vaughn was in it.  Now I watch it for all the characters.  This show is so well written and so clever.  It is so much better than 99% of American TV shows.  Glad to see Season Two is starting soon and cannot wait to own the first season on DVD!,1150070400,15,290,4.035087719298246

2589130,5,B000FUH350,This extremly brilliant series should be watched by all.  I saw the first season in the UK in 2004 and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  I believe that season 4 is excellent too.  Can't wait to get it.,1191974400,,203,4.025
2589131,4,B000FUH350,"Every so often there's a television show that completely enchants me; Hustle is one of those shows. Taking place in contemporary London, it's a caper-a-week tale of con-men with hearts of gold earning a living by duping wealthy ne'er-do-wells of their ill-gotten gains.

Hustle follows a crew of grifters including legendary con-man Michael ""Mickey Bricks"" Stone (Adrian Lester), Danny Blue (Marc Warren), Stacie Monroe (Jaime Murray), Ash Morgan (Robert Glenister), and Albert Stroller (American acting legend Robert Vaughn) as they pick up the big con game again after a long haitus during which Mickey was in prison. Danny, an untried novice, is the newest addition to the crew - with some hesitation. Each of them has their particular jobs to do - Mickey and Danny work the inside to convince their marks, Ash is the man who can get or make anything, Albert is the roper who brings the marks in, and Stacie plays convincing backup parts, as well as lending her expertise as a pick-pocket. Working as a family unit, these grifters struggle to make ends meet while pulling cons and taking scores off of those wealthy they deem deserving of comeuppance.

This series is a treat. Unlike most American crime shows, where the focus is on the dark and depressing reality and violence of the streets, Hustle is a refreshing tale of modern-day Robin Hoods staying just one step ahead of the law - and their marks. The emphasis here is on fun. The music is light (a bouncy sort of techno-jazz), the dialogue crisp, and the atmosphere humorous. These are characters, and a show, that you will quickly grow to love and return to again and again. Admittedly, this program owes a great deal to the Academy Award-winning Paul Newman/Robert Redford opus The Sting (which is heavily referenced in the first episode), but they take that film's love of capers and sense of fun to new levels.

However, do be warned that while this set includes the full first season, it is, nonetheless, only six episodes long and, thus, goes by very quickly. Setting this aside, Hustle is a brilliant show that I cannot recommend highly enough. Check it out, and enjoy!",1189900800,5,2138,4.852054794520548
2589132,5,B000FUH350,"Everyone I have shown this show to has been hooked! I can't recommend this show enough! From the producers of MI-5 (spooks) is a cast of grifters that work the long con. Mickey Bricks, Danny Blue & Crew are a joy to watch. The comedy and the writing is top notch! Although there is only 6 episodes per season, I highly recommend this wonderful program. The freeze frame/cast talking to the audience is brilliant and has become a staple all their own. Enjoy!",1186617600,,457,4.518072289156627
2589133,5,B000FUH350,Excellent character development and superbly written. It is amazing that they can produce so many riveting plots.  Most series take a couple of episodes for the cast to gel - this one takes right off.  You won't be disappointed.,1180396800,,228,4.82051282051282
2589134,3,B000FUH350,"""Hustle"" has become an excellent show, full of intricate plotting, sharp wit, and enjoyable ensemble acting. The first season, unfortunately, is seriously marred by a lack of originality. Both the first and last episodes are shameless ripoffs of ""The Sting."" When you have only six episodes, stealing the plots for two of them from the SAME movie is quite a con!

However, three of the four remaining episodes (all but the weak second ep) are very good indeed. At its best, the show has the feel of a breezy ""Mission: Impossible"" with more interesting characters.

If you're discovering this show for the first time, start with Season 2.",1180137600,9,637,4.888888888888889
2589135,5,B000FUH350,"Hustle is another wonderful program to come from England.  This program about British long con artists is well written, well acted, and well staged.  Think of this as the British television version of Ocean's Eleven.  If you enjoyed the series MI-5, you will enjoy this (it is even made by the same people).",1178928000,2,307,4.754716981132075
2589136,5,B000FUH350,"Season one tells the story of Mickey Bricks, the best of the long con artist as he put together a crew of grifters that quickly become the talk of Scotland Yard. This show is a must see for any one of all ages... My hat is off to BBC Programing",1178409600,,244,3.9
2589137,5,B000FUH350,"A crew of five long-con artists (Adrian Lester, Marc Warren, Jamie Sheridan, Robert Glenister, and Robert Vaughn) target arrogant wealthy cretins with elaborate confidence schemes.  Operating under the credo that it is impossible to con an honest man, they design situations in which the greed and dishonesty of the mark is necessary for the scam to succeed.  Just in case that isn't enough to secure viewer sympathy, the writers often have the protagonists conning to raise money to help a bedridden friend or avenge an unfairly cheated old lady.  As far-fetched as this sentimental streak may be, it is an essential element of this show's breezy, clever, thoroughly entertaining style.  The entire cast is excellent, but Lester and Warren really stand out.  It's good to see the dependable Robert Vaughn again.",1178323200,,812,5.1679389312977095
2589138,5,B000FUH350,"More than a ""caper"" movie, ""Hustle"" demonstrates how greed leaves one open for scam artists.  Robert Vaughn, a consummate professional and the perfect head of the team, leads an excellent troupe of actors as they lay out elaborate plots to entice the greedy into their web.  Well done.",1175817600,,285,4.916666666666667
2589159,5,B000FUH350,"Hustle is a great con show with all the theatrics of a great heist movie like Ocean's Eleven.  The characters are all great and since they have a strict code of ethics you don't have to feel bad about cheering for the ""bad guys."" The show is good quality in both appearance and writing.  Its a nice fun show that you can just sit back and enjoy.  The writing is good enough that the cons don't get boring.  If you like the caper genre you'll really like this show.  If you like glitzy shows like Las Vegas (which is not as good as this at all) you'll like this show too.  If you just like to watch interesting people doing interesting things then this show is for you also.",1175385600,,673,4.178294573643411
2589160,4,B000FUH350,"This is a delightful, witty series.  Influenced by the amazon.com critiques for Season Two, I watched that series first and am glad I did.

Main complaint with Season One is that three of the six episodes ""pay homage"" to THE STING.  While this is okay for two of the three, the finale episode deepens appreciation for the Newman-Redford-Brennan feature.

Worth the DVD investment, but first allow yourself to get hooked by the less derivative second season.",1175299200,3,457,4.973684210526316

2589163,5,B000FUH350,"I stumbled across Hustle late one night when nothing else was on.  I was hooked right away!  This is a great show, it's funny, full of suspense, and intellegent.  I even let my kids watch it, although I was a bit surprised when there was a little bit of nudity that wasn't there on TV.  Hustle has a little bit of something for everyone!",1168300800,,337,4.21875
2589164,5,B000FUH350,"HUSTLE is a BBC series currently in production in the United Kingdom.  So far, three seasons have been shot, produced, and shown, all to great reviews.  The episodes revolve around the adventures and misadventures of a professional long con team (meaning that the set-up for a mark takes time, effort, and money).  This is the first DVD set to be released in Region 1, but the second is coming in February.

Adrian Lester stars as Mickey Bricks, the team's leader.  Robert Vaughn is Albert Stroller, the team's hook to get a mark set up.  Stacie Monroe (Jaime Murray) works as the banker and the bait in some of the cons.  Robert Glenister plays Ash Morgan, the ""fixer"" for the team, meaning he can fix problems and electronics, and get necessary supplies.  Mark Warren stars as Danny Blue, the team's newest recruit.

HUSTLE revolves around this close-knit family, playing off their strengths and weaknesses.  Each episode deepens the character more, and allows you to peek into their backgrounds -- where all kinds of surprising things are hidden.  Although the characters constantly evolve, the episodes are stand-alone, each a complete story in itself.

If you like crime stories with a touch of comedy, a knowing wink to the audience, and even a little education in all things criminal, HUSTLE is definitely a series you should buy or rent.  Or you might be able to catch episodes on AMC.  But I'm willing to bet they lure you in and get you to shell out a few hard-earned bucks for the DVD set.  That's the art of the con.",1167955200,2,1528,4.713207547169811
2589165,5,B000FUH350,"If there is one thing I have to say about Hustle is that it is the greatest show currently on television. The acting is superb and the story lines are amazing. It really makes you think that what Micky Brick's crew is doing is actually possible in the real world and draws you in from there. If american television writers could produce a show of this caliber, I believe in my estimation that it would in fact save network television.",1167955200,2,434,4.4375

I highly recommend this DVD BBC television series.",1163030400,2,369,4.71875
2589167,4,B000FUH350,"Quite a fun little show.  I thought that I read it's from producers from ""MI:5,"" but I'm not certain.  It has some of the same look (playing with camera speeds, nice cinematography, crisp writing).

Another reviewer mentioned that there's no closed-captioning.  It was fine on my television.  He said he confirmed it with three DVD players, but closed captioning is on a television, not a DVD player.",1162598400,,400,4.91044776119403

I love watching Leverage - the characters are fun to watch and some cons are really good.

However, Hustle is as good, though you have to take each episode from both series and then analyse which is better. The first thing that draws you in is the title music. Adrian Lester as Mickey ""Bricks"" fits in nicely in the leader's role. Robert Vaughn is charming and brings back memories. Ash is very skillful, Stacie is smooth and Marc Warren as Danny is fun to watch. Sometimes I have to rewind due to the corny british accent (does not happen for all british serials) but here it takes some getting used to.

The viewer is taken along the con and the whole con is explained with a freeze frame technique. The whole world simply is frozen while some key point in the con is explained to the viewer. Very nicely done and great fun to watch. I'm currently on Season 2. Do watch Leverage also - you'll definitely like it if you enjoy Hustle.",1257984000,2,1173,5.168421052631579

I'm surprised they haven't cloned this series on HBO or Showtime. I think it's a little dry for American audiences. If you can come to grips with the dry but solid writing of this original show then you're well on your way to enjoying a well made program.
