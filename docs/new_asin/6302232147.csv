7822437,1,6302232147,"I just finished reading the wonderful book; ""Lou's On First"" about Lou Costello and written by his youngest daughter Chris Costello and it mentions this ""made-for-TV movie"" and where it comes from. Don't waste your money on this piece of trash! I'm originally from Paterson, NJ and have always been proud of Lou coming from my home town.",1308182400,3,337,4.827586206896552
7822438,1,6302232147,"As an A&C ultimate fan I can't believe they made such a horrible movie.  It had so many holes in it.  The acting was terrible as the classic ""Who's On First"" was made UNFUNNY by Korman and Hackett who will never be confused with Abbott and Costello.  I'm forced to give it one star because you can't go any lower.",1232496000,4,313,4.183333333333334
7822439,5,6302232147,"Based on the book ""BUD AND LOU:THE ABBOTT AND COSTELLO STORY"" by Bob Thomas, and directed by Robert C. Thompson this comedy/drama follows Abbott and Costello (Harvey Korman, Buddy Hackett) from their modest start in vaudeville through their early radio success  and, utlimately, to their stardom as motion picture and televison stars.",1151366400,3,334,5.423076923076923
