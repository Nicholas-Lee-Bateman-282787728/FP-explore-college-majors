8125916,1,B000FS2WLW,"Oh, how boring!!  It's conference footage and to boot the audio isn't even that great.  Would not recommend, unless of course you like that sort of thing.  Snooze fest!!",1363564800,,169,4.758620689655173
8125917,1,B000FS2WLW,"You REALLY want me to rate this item AFTER I have already returned it!!!
I think I would have enjoyed the video however 5 minutes into the video it froze up and wouldn't play.  We took it out to see if it was scratched - which it was NOT.  Then we tried it again.  Same thing - froze around the same spot and THEN got stuck in our DVD player.  We had to cut the power to the player to get the F'n thing out!  Still nothing visibly wrong with the DVD though.  Returned and was told I could not get another one because they were now out of stock and unsure if they would get them back.  (Was suppose to be a birthday gift).  Doubt I will try this one again unless I am assured it will play!!!",1356048000,,690,3.9136690647482015
8125918,2,B000FS2WLW,"I expected with everything that I have read from Meldrum that this would be a really good bigfoot dvd to own. Sadly this is not the case. It literally is two discs, both are just someone in the crowd at hotel presentations with video cameras.",1352592000,,242,4.4
8125919,1,B000FS2WLW,Don't buy this DVD. It consist of a series of long winded presentations from a convention. Nothing that you haven't heard before.,1307923200,2,129,4.909090909090909
8125920,4,B000FS2WLW,"This two-disc DVD set features four lectures from an unknown location sometime in 2003, and the material is very interesting. Disc 1: The first lecturer, Dr. Jeff Meldrum of Idaho State University, is about footprint morphology, and is very well-done by Dr. Meldrum. After the lecture, he takes questions from the audience. Dr. John Bindernagel is next, with a history of the Sasquatch being left out of the field guides and also his feelings on the whole field and the rejection by science. He also takes questions from the audience. Disc 2: Gordon Strasenburgh, a longtime Bigfoot enthusiast, lectures on the Patterson/Gimlin film and why he thinks it's real and also his theory as to what Bigfoot is (he believes it's australopithecine). He also shows some native drawings and sculptures of apelike creatures from Native Americans. The last lecture is by John Green, the esteemed Sasquatch chronicler, who gives a history lesson of his involvement in it and also his descriptive nature of the creatures. This set is highly-recommended for anyone's Bigfoot DVD collection.",1198540800,4,1074,5.17816091954023
8125921,3,B000FS2WLW,"Sasquatch Science is really nothing more than a dvd of four speakers at some kind of bigfoot conference. This is nothing spectacular but it's not horrible. Quality of the coverage as a whole is low as it's done with slides, overheads, and a hand held microphone and the lighting is just terrible. You can also hear all the people whispering that are near the recording camera. This dvd includes:

1. Dr. Jeff Meldrum speaking for an hour on the mid tarsal break in primate feet and how it might apply to interpreting sasquatch prints. It's a good presentation but you could fall asleep pretty easy. Uses slides for visual aides.

2. Biologist John Bindernagel discusses the lack of inclusion of sasquatches in nature guides and tracking manuals even though they haven't been ""scientifically proven"" to exist. Maybe the best part of the dvd. Uses slides as visual aides.

3. Gordon Strasenburgh talks about bigfoot images in various cultures like pictographs and carvings. This is the worst presentation of the dvd, it's sloppy, and actually rather painful to endure this dude's speech pattern with his wheezing. Uses overhead projector for visual aides and is just plain poorly done.

4. John Green presents his standard-every-convention speech about sasquatch and the media. He actually gets cutoff at one point and becomes angry at the guy timing them. Green broaches the subject of Ray Wallace in his segment also. Good segment but from what I've seen it's your standard John Green conference speech.

Overall, this conference dvd is just okay, nothing outstanding or really mind-gripping going on. From what I can see, it doesn't even tell you when or where this presentation was done other than at West Coast Hotels.",1155513600,8,1721,5.003496503496503
