8339915,4,B001SJPO9Y,"At one hour and 10 minutes, there's not a lot of filler to talk about.  Just a good story from the early 1930s around the depression.  Nice love story, but never sappy.",1508630400,,168,4.21875
8339916,5,B001SJPO9Y,"Great movie.  Sadly, not burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.

8339919,3,B001SJPO9Y,"William Powell, one of my favorite actors since childhood, stars in this RKO classic playing John Fletcher, a spoiled playboy who's inherited his father's shipping empire but has no interests in life other than pursuing polo, women, and anything that avoids work.  That is, until he starts dating Joan Colby (Ann Harding), a woman who used to regard marriage as a business proposition herself, but soon finds she's falling in love with John the cad.  So much in love, she tricks the confirmed bachelor into marrying her, hoping she can (in time) make him love her in return - and that's when the real mess begins.  The first half of this short film plays like a drama, the latter more comedic (and featuring a wonderful supporting role by Reginald Owen, playing a manservant), which comes off a bit disjointed though things meld together nicely in the end.  Quirky but worth a watch, with solid performances.  (from sixtysecondcinema.blogspot.com)",1425859200,,947,5.006369426751593

8339921,4,B001SJPO9Y,"- Joan Colby: ""Love? Marriage has nothing to do with love. Marriage is a business. At least, it's a woman's business. And love is an emotion. A man doesn't let emotion interfere with his business, and if more women would learn not to let emotion interfere with theirs, fewer of them would end up in the divorce court.""

Don't worry. She's not as mercenary as she seems.

After watching William Powell and Ann Harding's only cinematic pairing, I feel that someone's pants should be kicked for not reteaming them, their chemistry was that solid. DOUBLE HARNESS, out in 1933, showcases Powell's patented panache and wit, but that's expected. What surprises is Harding's light touch. I'd only ever associated her with melodramas. Well, DOUBLE HARNESS is a comic melodrama. Harding plays the conniving yet sympathetic Joan Colby. From jump we note that, of the two Colby sisters, Joan tends to be the steady, dependable one. The younger Valerie (Lucile Browne) is more spoiled and frivolous and habitually incurs extravagant debts.

Being practical and being pragmatic, Joan posits that marriage has nothing whatsoever to do with love. Joan claims no talent and instead plans to ride a man's coattails to success. Luckily she exudes this aura that is ""cooly virginal yet exquisitely inviting."" She sets her cap on John Fletcher (William Powell), the so-called ""Playboy of the West"" and also heir to a shipping empire. But when Joan hatches a plot to dupe the longtime bachelor into marrying her, a resentful John doesn't take too well to the matrimonial plunge. The romance cools off quick. So now can the estranged couple find their way back to happiness? John's shipping enterprise has gone on the skids since he took over five years ago. Maybe the way back to his heart, Joan thinks, is to help him make his business solvent once more. Joan, you see, has made the cardinal mistake of dismissing her own philosophy. She fell in love with the guy. Except now the guy's taken to spending quality time with a gorgeous old flame (Lilian Bond).

DOUBLE HARNESS, an obscure RKO gem, runs 70 minutes long and works hard to delight its viewer with its blend of polished acting and smart, snappy dialogue. It's not a screwball farce; it's more of a sophisticated comedy. As well there's a bit of suggestive pre-Code material going on between our two leads. Powell and Harding are very watchable together, whether in the heat of romance or in the cooling-off stages. It's one of those stories that throws some doubt towards the expected happy ending. Things culminate in a zany dinner sequence in which the butler and the cook get into a scrap and the number of dinner guests amusingly dwindles one by one. Ann Harding shines as a comedienne in this stretch. It's a blast watching her as she tries to keep it together and perform her hostess duties even as the complications pile up. Somewhere in this mess, maybe, just maybe, John and Joan Fletcher can find it in themselves to reconcile. Or maybe not. What's known is that William Powell was a year away from his iconic Thin Man role, after which I betcha the only leading lady them movie studio suits had in mind to partner up Powell was Myrna Loy. Sorry, Ann Harding.",1375488000,,3208,4.795660036166366
8339922,5,B001SJPO9Y,"Double Harness is a genuine forgotten gem, a Pre-code comedy/drama/love story/soap opera that was out of circulation for almost 50 years. Spoiled heiress Valerie Colby gets married, an event which inspires her older, more settled sister, Joan, to also get married. It is a decision inspired, not by love, but by personal ambition, and she chooses for her spouse the wealthy but unambitious John Fletcher. Joan manages to trick him into marriage, but unexpectedly discovers she has fallen in love with her own husband. Their burgeoning relationship is threatened by spendthrift Valerie's continual demands of money from Joan. This is more of a straight dramatic role for William Powell, but as ever, he manages to infuse humor into his performances with a twitch of his mustache or a quirk of his eyebrow. Ann Harding, however, steals the film, as she is won't to do in most films she made. Indescribably beautiful, Harding was an exceedingly popular actress in the early 1930s, famous for her ""woman's films"", but is largely forgotten today. Unfortunate, because she is marvelous in this film. Harding is a very subtle, understated performer who has the difficult talk of making the transformation of a rather unlikable character into one the audience sympathizes with and even likes a believable one. The dinner party Joan throws near the conclusion of the film is hilarious and shows that Harding was not only a brilliant dramatic actress, but a sterling comedian, as well. Again, very subtle and nuanced. The supporting players in this one are also amazing, especially Lucile Browne as the bratty, clueless, and selfish Valerie. Probably a fairly typical film of its era, nonetheless it is well worth viewing, and is sure to entertain for its all too brief 70 minutes.",1329350400,4,1771,5.068493150684931
8339923,4,B001SJPO9Y,"As I mention in my book Ann Harding-Cinema's Gallant Lady, DOUBLE HARNESS was one of the many wonderful pre-Code films to ""bite the dust"" after the enforcement of the Production Code.  The film was a critical and financial success, but never re-released.  The problem was a seduction scene which established that Ann Harding was offering William Powell pre-marital favors.  In the 1950's ... a truncated DOUBLE HARNESS showed up on New York TV where portions of this ""offensive"" scene were deleted.  This DVD contains the restored version.

DOUBLE HARNESS -used here as an idiom for ""Marriage"" had been a London stage success in 1933 written by an American, Edward Poor Montgomery, who adapted it from a 1904 novel by English author Anthony Hope.  Hope had also penned THE PRISONER OF ZENDA.  Oddly enough, the director for DOUBLE HARNESS, John Cromwell, would direct Ronald Colman 1937's THE PRISONER OF ZENDA.  Cromwell also directed OF HUMAN BONDAGE, with Bette Davis, after Ann Harding turned down the role.  Cromwell had actually directed Ann Harding ten years earlier, in 1923, in her first big hit on Broadway, TARNISH.

By the time they teamed for DOUBLE HARNESS in May 1933, both Ann Harding and William Powell were well-established screen stars.  Harding had been nominated for Best Actress for HOLIDAY (1930) and Powell was just a year away from THIN MAN triumph at MGM.  Powell liked the script for DOUBLE HARNESS and was delighted to be working with Ann, an actress whom he truly admired.  On screen their chemistry and rapport is the film's chief asset.

In his 2007 review of Double Harness SF critic/author Mick LaSalle stated, ""Double Harness is especially precious because it is one more of a handful of first-rate vehicles for Ann Harding, who was perhaps the best actress of the early 1930s.  Don't believe it?  See her.  Her technique is psychological, extremely modern.""

As with most Ann Harding films, the ensemble spirit prevails.  Cromwell's direction is sleek.  Ann's saucy, yet level-headed character targets wealthy San Francisco playboy Powell as if it were her ""business"" to do so.  Powell finds her ""coolly virginal, yet exquisitely inviting.""  He asks if she can be trusted.  ""Can you?"" she replies.  ""In drinking, yes,"" he answers.  Harding and Powell pull off the superb dialogue with seasoned charm and flair.  Watch for the scene where Harding first goes up to Powell's apartment.  She's wearing a gardenia corsage that Powell gave her- as they embrace, she exclaims ""My Flowers!""  She's about to be de-flowered, as it were--a great double-entendre.

About the only thing that misses the mark is a slap-stick scene toward the end.  A confrontation between Reginald Owen (the butler) and Wong Chung (the cook)comes off as a bit awkward.  The finis itself, however, is quite touching.  Highly Recommended.",1300838400,10,2840,5.08008658008658
8339924,5,B001SJPO9Y,"This product and this film are both very good. Do be aware that this is a DVD-R you are purchasing. Notice the TCM logo displayed prominently on the artwork? You can buy this film directly from TCM for under twenty dollars. If you want the entire Lost and Found RKO film collection of six films on DVD-R it will cost you just under sixty-five dollars.  As for the film, it is a great pre-code, unshown for decades and tied up in rights problems until TCM rode to the rescue in 2007 and cleared matters up. Now TCM owns the rights to this and five other films that were in the same boat.

Ann Harding plays Joan, the oldest of two sisters and the daughter of a man who is still wealthy but has been hit hard by the depression. The film opens on the family shopping for younger daughter Valerie's wedding trousseau. Valerie's champagne tastes are having difficulties adjusting to a cheaper brand, and one gets the feeling that she's used to being pampered by both Joan and her father.  This fact figures in prominently later on in the plot. Afterward, Joan runs into John Fletcher (William Powell), heir to the Fletcher shipping line. After a couple of casual dates, Joan decides that John would make a good husband. The bottom line looks good - there's only one problem. John is a confirmed bachelor. Joan decides to take the intensity of her quest up a notch. She begins sleeping with John and, with the help of her sister, arranges to have her father call on John and find her in his apartment dressed only in lounging pajamas. Chivalry will demand that John marry her and so will her father.

Things work out as Joan planned up to a point. John agrees to marry Joan, but wants it understood that there will be a divorce after a respectable amount of time has passed - six months. In the meantime, Joan's business-like attitude towards the marriage has been ruined by the fact that she now loves John and only has six months to get him to feel the same way without trying so hard that John can see that she is trying to get him to love her.

This movie has some great precode moments as well as the always dapper William Powell and the regal bearing of Ann Harding at her very best. In spite of the rather dramatic and heavy sounding plot I've described, it also has some great comic moments. The best of these is near the end of the film when Joan has to pull off a dinner party for some of John's potential clients without having them know about the mayhem going on behind the scenes, yet she is thwarted quite hilariously at every turn.

Let me also remark that the video and audio quality on this product are quite good. Highly recommended for fans of precode cinema.",1260057600,8,2672,4.4317718940936865
