4370526,5,B004FN268M,Great pricing. Nice video. This is a very good documentary of the Atocha and the Treasure Salvors crew and the Mel Fisher family.,1326499200,2,129,4.6521739130434785
8427982,5,B004FN268M,"This tells the years-long story of the Mel Fisher family as they searched the ocean floor for a ship reportedly loaded with treasure from the 1600's. After some initial success there is a long gap of time between finding more contents of the hold. During that time the state of Florida and then the Federal Government both state that they should get a portion of the find!

Engaging and insightful along with some sadness along the way.",1508630400,,436,4.662337662337662
8427983,5,B004FN268M,"Check out how the various government entities let the private citizens take all the risk and expense and then step in and try to take the booty for themselves without doing anything to help along the way. Thank goodness for the five justices on the U.S. Supreme Court who can see through the legal gobbledy-gook to the big picture and do the right thing. This is the dream everyone has as a kid of finding treasure chests full of gold and silver. Kudos to Mel Fisher and his crew for painstakingly preserving the historical artifacts for the public, too.",1484265600,,554,4.606060606060606

8427989,3,B004FN268M,Seems more of a biography of hardships faced by the hunter than a documentary on the ship or details on its recovery,1409184000,,116,4.318181818181818
