2423698,5,B000BM7YY2,"First, all of the other reviewers make good points.  This isn't a video for absolute beginners; you should have some comfort with the fretboard and chord/scale structure.  (I think even if you don't there's plenty here for you, it just might come harder.) I disagree a little about the fret markers, because Jimmy usually says what position he's playing so you can keep up.

The reason this DVD is a no-brainer in my opinion is because you get an excellent two-hour lesson from a great, engaging teacher for less than half the price of a single one-hour lesson from your local teacher.  AND you can play it over and over again, and really absorb what Jimmy is saying and doing.  (If you're like me, you'll need to.)  Plus, transcriptions with tab.  It may not take the place of one-on-one lessons but there's no way you won't get your $22 worth out of it.

And Mr. Bruno, if you're reading this, thanks for the great lesson!",1162944000,16,924,4.557575757575758
2423699,5,B000BM7YY2,"I spent two and a half years going through the No-Nonsense Jazz video.  It was incredible.  If the DVD is the same thing (I'll bet it is), then it is great.  Jimmy revolutionized my playing with this video.  He focuses on the 2-5-1 progression, diatonic to the key of C. This makes complete sense.  He explains the use of Dorian and Mixolydian modes, along with lots of other information.  Jimmy is a winner and so is his instructional material. As a prerequisite to this DVD, I would suggest that you have some basic music theory (knowlege of diatonic chords, order of sharps and flats, etc.)and knowlege of time signatures (quarter note, half note, etc.) to get the most out of this course. Also, if you are relying on Tab, I would suggest using this course to familarize yourself with standard musical notation (there is a reason that they use this in colleges and have for long time, it is the universal written language between instruments. Tab doesn't mean much to a trumpet player! However it does include tab.) During the study of this course I used it to literally learn to read up and down the neck, with standard notation (although this wasn't part of the course.) Jimmy uses some pretty fast licks, but don't be intimidated, they are usually consecutive notes (you can see this if you study the included documentation.) If you are seriously interested in jumping from blues or rock into the jazz world, this is the CD.  Just take your time, and think about what he is presenting.  After studying this CD, you'll walk away snappin' your fingers, with a feel for what bebop jazz licks feel like and are make of.  I could not have spent my money better.  Jimmy is a patient teacher, a kind soul, and this DVD is a winner.",1160006400,8,1730,4.587662337662338
2423700,5,B000BM7YY2,"this is a good instructional video. it has a good amount of information and ideas that you can incorporate into your practice. and they are explained in layman's term. it covers good foundation, but doesn't get into advance ideas, so appropriate for beginning jazz players that have some general ideas about music and theory, but don't know how to put things together and practice them on the guitar. i really liked how he explained about the structure of his usual guitar lessons, which you can borrow to build your practice routine. dvd format has added features: slow mo play. good index system. etc. also comes with a booklet with tab notation. if you are a self studying musician that feel lost(especial rock and blues players wanting to get into jazz), you will enjoy this one.",1156550400,6,783,4.807407407407408
2423701,5,B000BM7YY2,"The title says it all. Not for beginners or dabblers, but serious intermediate guitarists who want to improve their soloing, or people moving into jazz from rock/blues/whatever. Enough material to keep you busy practicing for a year. I've seen a bunch of jazz  guitar instruction DVDs, and this is by far the best.",1147219200,33,314,4.9245283018867925
2423702,5,B000BM7YY2,"If I could only buy one jazz dvd this would be it. Jimmy may seem a little confident but he should be, he's kinda funny too when he says you can learn something the hard way and use the theoretically correct jargon if you want to ""impress your girlfriend""

Here is a breakdown:

He shows you how to see the neck in multiple box and diagnal pictures for major, dorian, and melodic minor scales.

Shows the Major 7 and dorian arpeggios and how to connect them to these pictures.

Illustrates a Dorian melodic minor tritone substitution, sounds cool.

Shows his picking style.

Lays out a kick your tush chord lesson, I know more chords than any guitar player I know and this guy gave me a chord tooling.

Has a nice section on bass line chord comping.

Then he explains at the end how you should go about practicing these concepts with jam tracks.

And there are many examples he plays that are long and tabbed out; there are nearly a thousand riffs you could glean from these examples of his tabbed improvizations. He isn't teaching riffs but they are there tabbed out if you want them.

There is enough material here to keep you very busy and will go along way toward improving your ear and command of the guitar.

And best of all he makes it simple and takes the junk science out of jazz theory.",1141776000,55,1296,4.4033613445378155
2423703,4,B000BM7YY2,"This video is great for someone who knows how to play, but isn't very familiar with jazz style. There's enough information here for most players to get somehting out of it, but the video assumes that you know certian theory concepts. Unless you already know what scales are for, how to build them, how to spell chords and how to play a few closed jazz chord voicings, you will have to be very, very patient to really use this. If I were just starting out, I wouldn't get this as a susbstitute for a teacher. I would get a teacher and make them explain this to me when I was ready.

If you're fine with that, then there's plenty of good stuff here. Seriously, the video is two hours long. Even if you can't play anything near the scary fast speed he uses, you can still get the concept. It's all thoroughly explained in a clear, lucid manner. It's very nuts-and-bolts practical stuff, and you won't have to think about it for two hours to use it (but it couldn't hurt).

My only real gripe is that he can be kind of patronizing. I've met plenty of other guitarists who are just as pompous, and can't back it up as well as he can, so it doesn't bother me. When he suggests that you practice scales for ""an hour a day to play for your friends at parties"" it comes off as a little snotty. Still, he has plenty of good ideas, and he can play like nobody else.",1139356800,29,1354,4.223938223938224
2423704,5,B000BM7YY2,"If you're in the John Denver style (and I totally respect John Denver) then this vid may not be for you. It is for jazz players who want  to tighten up their playing. I can't wait to put in those 2 or 3 months on this vid, I consider it an honor to study with Mr. Bruno!",1137456000,3,270,3.736842105263158
2423705,2,B000BM7YY2,"While the other reviewer of this DVD felt that there was a 'world of knowledge' contained in this disc is a matter of conjecture.

As an above average guitar player (blues, R & B, classic rock)who still relies on my fret markers periodically, but, and this is important, who doesn't read music but does understand basic music theory, there is little I could glean from this DVD as presented. There is no question that Bruno is incredible and his approach to scales appears to have considerable merit.

But he does not really 'teach' you what he is doing. His guitars have no fret markers and while I can follow him in slow motion as anyone probably could who understands the fret board, I am afraid this disc is only for the acomplished and those looking for a thoughtful approach to Jazz guitar.

Before he even gets to the basic chord voicings you have to buy into and learn his approach as a prerequiste. Had I known that and had I been prepared to spend months with this DVD (which I was not) I would not have bought it.

If you are really serious about Jazz guitar and want an interesting approach and you understand music theory and can read sheet music, then this might work for you.

Otherwise stay away.

I was looking for some further Jazz guitar chord voicings such as Aaron Stang (this guy is good) teaches in a couple of his dvds, to interject into the form of blues I am gravitating toward.

This wan't the disc and frankly was a waste of my money.

My mistake, I bought into what the guitar teacher's review said, but it was beyond me or the time I was prepared to devote to it.

There is a lot of good material out there of the 'here's how to do kind and why'. If that's what you are looking for then stay away. I want my money back but that isn't going to happen!

I feel I was misled, but that's my problem.",1136505600,18,1825,4.309941520467836
2423706,5,B000BM7YY2,"I've known jimmie bruno for almost 20 years. I first discovered him when he was playing at JJs' Grotto on 21st street in Philadelphia. This was before he got a contract with Concord jazz. He was amazing to watch then and he has only gotten better and better over the years.  There is no way that you can fail to learn from Jimmy as he presents material in the most basic terms. As a guitar teacher i periodically buy guitar books and DVDs so I know what's out there. Although the literature is improving it is still hard to find a comprehensive and easy to understand and follow guitar tutorial. I have the original VHS and it was an unbelievable amount of material for the money. This time the bargain is even better as you can pre order the DVD from Amazon for under $20. If you have any interest in deepening your understanding of your instrument this is the DVD for you. If you are a listener and want to understand the fundamentals of jazz guitar then don't hesitate to order this DVD. As a matter of fact any guitar player will gain an amazing amount of knowlege from it. I've pre ordered mine and if you're smart so will you.

  Good pickin' to you all and thanks to Jimmy Bruno for twenty years of great music.",1130284800,18,1218,4.328947368421052
2423707,5,B000BM7YY2,"The use of continuous three cameras recording when Jimmy is playing is how all guitar video tutorials shouuld be.

Great video and audio quality. Great editing. No filler, no fluffing around, just get into to it.
Video content and structure (chapters, sections, direct links to specific lesson material) could not be better.
Totally professional from Jimmy's side and from the producer / editor of the DVD.
Jimmy's way of teaching is clear, easy to understand, and easy to remember.
I bought this DVD in 2008, but did not watch it until last week. Durr.
Wish we had this kind of instructional material in 1960 when I was starting out.

2423709,3,B000BM7YY2,"I edited my review because in reality there is much we can all learn from this DVD. The latter part of it gets into comping and bass lines which interest me a great deal. I'm working on learning to play an 8 string. Jimmy is giving us the tools to become as good at this as we want. The question is time and effort.

I'm very happy I have this DVD, I'll refer to it often. I left a 3 star rating the first time through, but really this is a 5 star video.

Thanks Jimmy, the light bulb finally turned on in my head. Maybe someday I'll have a ""jazz brain"".",1360281600,,554,3.9375

When Jimmy turns on the juice and starts playin'...wicked, melodic lines that are played so naturally, as a waterfall...falls...Then consider how clean his sound is, the strings he's usin, and the tone he's getting!

2423715,5,B000BM7YY2,"Jimmy Bruno is a great teacher. Jimmy's fingering system and thoughts on chord melody and inversion selections are excellent. I've been playing blues a long time, but jazz always seemed complicated and mysterious. Jimmy cuts right through to the heart of playing jazz. This is not a shortcut to making a jazz noise with your guitar - there are some serious concepts that will take a lot of practice to master, but Jimmy will get you up to speed in the shortest possible time. This video will probably be most useful for intermediate and advanced players who have little or no jazz background but want to explore. A beginner may not get much out of the examples to begin with, but it never hurts to watch the masters explain what they do - some of it will stick in your  mind. I always like to watch musicians who do things I cannot, just to see where the road might lead.

I'd recommend this DVD to any guitarist who loves jazz guitar but just can't seem to master the theory behind it. This DVD won't make anyone a jazz player overnight, but it will help you to advance your playing skills. Highly recommended.

I did have one issue:

If you order this DVD, be sure to check the enclosed booklet when you receive it - the booklet that I received jumped from example 15 to example 34. So I contacted Amazon, and, as usual, they sent me an immediate replacement at their expense, but unfortunately the booklet was missing the same pages. Obviously this is a QC issue with the publisher and nothing to do with Amazon. I contacted Hal Leonard Publishing and they have agreed to send me a replacement copy of the DVD. I had to pay the $5 to return it but at least I have the complete product.

UPDATE 9/19/2011: After returning the DVD on August 3 to Hal Leonard, and several emails promising they were sending the replacement, Hal Leonard Corp finally sent me a replacement DVD and threw in a bonus DVD for my patience. I must say, it seemed to take a long time, maybe they had to search around for a complete booklet? Anyway, I now have the complete book - now I actually have to get to work trying to learn some of Jimmy's stuff.",1311638400,3,2128,4.404580152671755
2423716,5,B000BM7YY2,"I agree its NOT for beginners, however if you know your triads and basic major scale shapes (NOT JUST PENTATONIC) then this DVD is a goldmine. Rock/Blues players like myself will find this DVD invaluable!
Jimmy probably plays clean guitar quicker than most Rock cats but don't let that put you off! He takes the time out to slow things down and explain the ease of getting a jazz sound under your fingers, to sum up There are 7 notes in a major scale so what about the other 5? Relax, Jimmy's available to answer that one! Best instructional DVD on the web, EVER!",1276646400,,563,4.423076923076923

2423718,2,B000BM7YY2,"The initial demonstration of guitar playing by Jimmy Bruno was very good. However It was not clear from the advertisement,that it was mainly a teaching tool. Mr. Bruno,is a horrendous teacher. He is much too complex,and assumes a lot of prior knowledge. He goes much too fast,and should have brief breaks during which the student is allowed to practice what he has just taught in the prior segment. It would be much better if he confined the entire D.V.D.to demonstration Jazz guitar playing,with a series of different melodies. It is fascinating just to watch a virtuoso,at any instrument, play",1260576000,,595,5.02020202020202

Keep in mind, there is no such thing as a quick fix.  You will need to practice every day.  The good news is that Jimmy Bruno shows  you what to practice and  how to practice.

I've looked at dozens of videos on learning the guitar.  This is by far the best.

The way Jimmy explains his approach to jazz is easy to understand for those who have some playing under their belt. Putting it into action will require some practice, but the method is there for you if you want to put in the time.

I also thought he was a pretty entertaining guy as well as a good instructor. I've seen a few other of the ""Hot Licks"" DVDs and there are some that may be great players, but they are NOT good teachers!! And a few others that have just plain deadpan personalities...",1252281600,,650,4.2

Highly recommended.",1251676800,,366,4.397058823529412
2423722,5,B000BM7YY2,"I've been playing a long time and I wish I'd had this years ago. Jimmy makes a very compelling case for his method and it works. Trusting your ear first and then explaining it with theory is a good thing. Exploring Jimmy's ideas will help you inject life into your soloing and comping. It's helped me increase my enjoyment of the instrument substantially.

There are several things that I like about his approach on this video.
1. His recommendations at the end on how to practice and what he'd have you do if you were a student are great. If you work them, you'll get benefit. Of course, you need to consider your goals and how much time you can invest, but the ideas are sound.
2. His lessons on shaping chords and comping are great! Again, if you work the method, you'll see connections on the fretboard and feel comfortable enough to toss away that book of chords that's been gathering dust on your shelf and has kept you locked into the old way of doing things.
3. Following his method will help you learn the fretboard. That's the biggest thing that it helped me do. I knew a lot of theory before, but he helped me unlock the thinking that had me feeling a bit wrapped up, constrained and my playing a bit stale and unimaginative.
4. Regardless of whether you get one DVD or both, even though much of what he plays is transcribed, don't think that you need to learn all his licks or memorize the passages. Follow his advice and follow your ear. Learn the best bits from the passages and use it to up your technique.

With this and his follow on DVD, you'll get some great ideas on how to develop your chops and become a serious player. Additionally, his Mel Bay book on his scales is good. It's thin and to the point. Well documented and a nice companion to the DVDs.",1233014400,8,1773,4.36969696969697
2423723,5,B000BM7YY2,"This DVD is a tremendous help.  I found my guitar playing got better after watching it just half way though and going in the other room to play before it even finish.

Jimmy Bruno does not teach conventional music theory like what you would get from a university, college or music theory book.  He has a much simpler approach to guitar than all the teaching things out there that I have found personally.  In this DVD you will have exposure to the 5 shapes.  Once you know these 5 shapes you will find yourself playing better because you will see guitar differently.

The audio on this DVD is great.  The voice speech is not way lower than the guitar playing like a lot of teaching DVD's are.

If you made it this far in the review I am going to tell you to save your money and not bother getting this DVD.  Jimmy Bruno has opened an online private lesson website.  [...] if you are not sure about signing up then get this DVD and set your mind at ease.

I have personally been playing in bands for over 7 years and my playing only broke through to the next level after taking a few lessons from this man, Jimmy Bruno.",1202860800,5,1118,4.251184834123222
2423724,5,B000BM7YY2,"If scales is something you've escaped from practicing, then this DVD will do it for you.  It's not a beginners video but if you've been playing a couple of years and still don't get how scales, harmony and improv goes together, maybe the answer is in this DVD.  Jimmy teaches 6 scales that you can use for majors, minors and all the modes.  Certainly smartened up my understanding of what to do (and I teach guitar!).  It's a great teaching resource and the booklet explains it all in TAB and notation.  If you get Jimmy's downloadable PDF ($9 from his site) you'll have even more info to get these scales down pat.

Jimmy's a very good communicator and this is one of those DVDs that really works well (as a teacher I've seen loads; there are plenty out there that are either bad or just a promo for the artist).  This is neither - he really wants to get these ideas over to you and does it just like he was running a master class for you alone.  A very good example of what a guitar tuition DVD should be.",1200009600,10,1007,4.2631578947368425

Jimmy makes it easy and fun to learn almost like a guitar coach at your side saying this is easy and yes you cant do this!!The video gives close up shots booklet with all the scale patterns and runs jimmy performs. A must have for any serious guitarist wanting to learn jazz at any level!!",1199750400,3,604,4.5
2423726,5,B000BM7YY2,"I love this DVD for two reasons:  1)Jimmy gives you practical, down-to-earth instructions without using 'academician'-type words; and 2)he shows you exactly what he means!  In doing so, he really removes some of the mystery of jazz playing.

I would recommend this DVD if you already know the fretboard somewhat, and want to get started with basic jazz improving.  It's not really for beginners, unless you are extremely motivated to get up to speed with the scale/chord patterns.

To elaborate on what I mean by Jimmy being more down to earth, he points out that while knowing exactly what a 'G7 Flat 5, Flat 9' chord is and its notes can be somewhat important on an intellectual level, what's most important is that you can HEAR those notes.  Being able to label a scale as this or that is not as important as HEARING how it might be different from a major scale, for example.

In the beginning of the DVD, Jimmy emphasizes the fact that first, you need to know the basic chord patterns of the fretboard.  There's no way around that fact.  But he helps you by overcome this hurdle by going through each scale/chord pattern simply and thoroughly, thereby laying it all out for you.

As the title of this DVD states ('No Nonsense'), Jimmy isn't promising you that you'll play the most awesome licks in 3 days.  He's realistic.  You do have to practice.  But armed with his tips and samples, you can't help but improve if you practice his ideas for yourself.",1190073600,7,1457,4.622568093385214

I got this book thinking Jazz was some insanely complex thing -- it can be if you want it to -- but it can also be pretty straightforward, and that's what Jimmy is concentrating on here for the most part.  At one point he explained something and says, ""Hey it's Jazz, it's not rocket science.""  And the light bulb went off.  Sure there was stuff I needed to practice and learn, but now I was understanding the basics of what Jazz and soloing over changes is all about.  Jimmy is a great teacher and his playing just made me want to play.  Absolutely recommended.",1512950400,,659,4.404958677685951

8088796,4,B000BM7YY2,"I bought this DVD because jazz music and theory in general has always been a bit hazy and difficult to understand.  Bruno makes it quite easy to grasp given that you pay attention to what he is telling/showing you.  By no means will this elevate you to his level of playing if you are beginner or intermediate player but he does demystify some concepts when it comes to using notes outside of the major Dorian and mixolydian scales.  He shows you how each note of the major scale has its own scale which can be utilized over chord changes.  He shows you four voicings for major 7th, minor 7th and dominant 7th chords on 5 groupings of strings, each group made up of four strings to be strummed or plucked with the nails (my preferred method).  This adds up to twenty voicings that can be used for voice leading and navigation of the fretboard (but you have to connect the dots as he doesn't really show you the fingerlings for these inversions.  You have to follow the notes in logical sequences).  I gave this four instead of five stars because he does NOT touch upon something very important and fundamental in music: modulation.  What it is and how to employ it to create music with more depth.  Learn some techniques for modulation like using pivot chords and employ what he teaches you and you will advance quite quickly so long as you practice adamantly.

8088801,4,B000BM7YY2,"Bruno makes a good point that jazz is vulnerable to over-thinking and over-intellectualization, particularly when it comes to what scales are superimposed over what chord, etc. A player with a few scales and jazz chords under their belts can get off the ground much more quickly by focusing on the practical problem of creating a line over a II-V7-I progression, which can be done without an exhaustive study of scale and mode positions--just an understanding of how to derive them from a single scale position. Bruno gives works from six positions (and has a separate publication mapping out his scales.) I like the fact that scales avoid stretching as much as possible. The only limitation I can see is that eventually you need to break out of the vanilla--nice sounding, but vanilla lines to incorporate the color tones that create those nice dominant chord tensions (the ""pretty notes"" that Parker referred to.) This is covered more in depth in his second DVD. An experienced player may only find ""old wine in new bottles"" here, but for me it was the Rosetta Stone that finally got me going. I had been listening to liking jazz for many years, but this video got me going on the road to finally understanding what I was listening to and trying to play all this time.",1399852800,2,1270,4.751131221719457
8088802,4,B000BM7YY2,"Don't let the reviews fool you; this is a good DVD for beginning guitarists. While Jimmy's chops and tempos are very high level, the actual content of the DVD is accessible to newer guitarists.  Even if you don't absorb everything, you will at the very least learn a handful of very practical scale patterns and enjoy watching a guitar legend.",1397520000,2,343,4.716666666666667
