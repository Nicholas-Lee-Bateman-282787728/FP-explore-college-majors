8479891,4,B005MWKALA,"The story line was a bit cheesy in places, but I enjoyed it. It was better than most movies I have seen recently. The characters were believable and the Sarasota scenery great!",1413072000,,176,4.53125
8479892,1,B005MWKALA,"From what I had read and from the cover of the DVD it looked to be a good story.
Sadly it was not. Poor acting as well as filming did not help.
Would not recommend this movie. But everyone to their own, some may find it to their liking.",1381968000,,236,3.836734693877551
8479893,4,B005MWKALA,"The director should never be allowed to do another film again. And the writing was awful. The blonde actress was hot and might have had a chance in another film but the script was so stupid NO ONE could pull it off. The rest of cast was really bad and a few not so easy on the eyes - especially the therapist. Ouch. I did however find it entertaining. If this was sold as a dark comedy it would have been awesome. The writer, producer and director took themselves way too serious. I've seen worse films. If you turn it on mute it's actually pretty good. Very bad script and even worse directing is what the problem was here.",1326326400,6,624,4.2521008403361344
8479894,1,B005MWKALA,"There are movies where you find yourself trying to preserve your dignity or sanity by fast forwarding to escape the absurd plot, bad acting or ridiculous dialogue and then there are movies that are so so bad that skipping every ten minutes and then checking the storyline for a minute on the prayerful hope it was just a mistake and it's better than you thought. Well, it took less than five minutes into the movie to begin skipping and there was no relief.

The story is about some well-endowed female model type military intelligence officer who happens to be in Kuwait in the 90s and suddenly does a double pistol Western shoot out with a bunch of well armed bad people one of whom survives and decides to come after her many years later when she's a civilian photographer in Florida.  Stupid improbable storyline really shallow acting from actors with mostly little/no experience except a few TV series/movies. A lot of limited dialogue with read the teleprompter pauses where you wait for the next edited canned response. Cheap production with a really badly fabricated Arab hut with abandoned car in front - very stereotyped. Cheap echoing audio with production budget not allowing for subtitles.

Not surprising that the five star reviewers could barely write one positive sentence. Even IMDB which rarely rates movies below a four gave this a 2.7.",1326326400,4,1355,4.8826086956521735
8479895,1,B005MWKALA,"The film opens in Kuwait with all the acting, script, and historical accuracy of an Asylum film. Janis (Lisa Varga) is injured in Kuwait in 1994 and is sent home. She is haunted by her past which includes her images of her brother (Ken Stellingwerf) killing their parents. He is in prison in Sarasota, Florida, the same town where Janis decides to live. While in prison he sends her threatening letters and has a red SUV try to run her over. Janis just gets up and brushes it all off, like the Blues Brother did when Carrie Fischer destroyed their hotel with a bazooka, only it wasn't funny.

Janis is a free lance photographer who drives around in a Mercedes when she is not playing tennis. She has a friend who recommends a psychologist (Seva Anthony) which she visits. In the 10 years(?) Janis has been out she hasn't aged a day, gained a pound, or apparently had a boyfriend. The movie claims 10 years, but doing the math it is 17. Apparently the movie is supposed to take place in 2004 and we ignore the anachronisms. She is waiting for her brother to get out of prison and come after her. Toni Ann Rossi is getting her big break by playing Janis' friend Carol. Too bad Alan Cameron Roberts didn't write any decent lines for her. In fact the weakness of the film can be seen during the lengthy dialouge scenes which include awkward pauses and trite conversation. It was the worst of an Asylum film combined with a bad Hallmark production.

No swearing or nudity. Near silhouette sex scene.",1325980800,,1494,4.509225092250922
8479896,1,B005MWKALA,C'mon. There were two reviews for this claiming it was a great film. I watched the preview & knew after 30 seconds it was not a great film. Hilarious. I'm writing this because there should be some kind of fake reviews filter like on Yelp; for when people associated with a movie try to write a bogus review to get viewers.,1325289600,3,322,4.295081967213115
8479897,1,B005MWKALA,"Dont waste your time, or money on this one. High school acting, and film work. For those that gave this 5 stars, I can only wonder what they were thinking !",1325116800,3,156,4.064516129032258
8479898,5,B005MWKALA,"Wasn't sure what to expect from this film, but I loved it! Great acting, directing, story and beautiful cinematography! Definitely buy the DVD.",1323043200,2,143,5.260869565217392
8479899,5,B005MWKALA,"Non-Stop Action & Adventure Mickey Spillane Type Noir Thriller.  Filmed on location in beautiful Sarasota, Florida using the local talent.  Siskel & Ebert both agree - Two thumbs way up!!!!",1322697600,,189,5.266666666666667
