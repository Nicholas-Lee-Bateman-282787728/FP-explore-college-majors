3131673,5,B0014FAIZC,This breathtakingly sensitive and humanistic story is beautifully filmed with loving care by FFC.  The foil for the touching exploration and esoteric examination of the human condition is the backdrop of Nazi aggression and genocide during WW2.  Normally I share basic opinions of the most published film critics regarding films they review.  I could not disagree more with the prevailing opinions of published reviews I have read regarding this film.  FFC has set a very high standard for script writers and directors who want to create worthwhile innovative cinematic art.,1210809600,11,574,5.344444444444444

The storyline is interesting and highly unusual, the actors are perfect for their roles and FFCoppola has created a magnificent journey for heart and mind.  The music is beautiful, the sets sumptuous, the baroque lighting just right, the sense of wonder is palpable throughout.

3131681,4,B0014FAIZC,"Released in 2007, ""Youth Without Youth"" was Francis Ford Coppola's return to filmmaking after a ten-year absence. The story revolves around a 70 year-old man (Tim Roth) in Romania at the outset of WWII who is struck by lightning and miraculously regains his youth and now looks like a 40 year-old man. He acquires amazing powers as well, like psycho-kinesis and the ability to ""read"" a book by ""scanning"" it with his mind. The Nazi's catch wind of his incredible evolution and want to study him to create the perfect race (or whatever). The second half of the film takes place after the war years when the man finds a woman who looks like a young version of his deceased love (Alexandra Maria Lara). Incredibly she too is struck by lightning with differing results and it aids in his research on the origins of languages.

The film brings to mind two films from the mid-90s that also address people with fascinating powers -- ""Powder"" and ""Phenomenon."" The latter was decent whereas the former shot for greatness and in some ways attained it. ""Youth Without Youth"" is completely different in tone, mostly due to the WWII time-frame, but also because it's less of a wannabe blockbuster and more artsy and nigh unfathomable.

It has been said that ""Youth Without Youth"" was an intensely personal project for Coppola. For one reason or another, the topic -- based on a book -- resonated with him and he was driven to convey it on film. You get the impression that Coppola had discovered the answer to the mysteries of life and wanted to share it with the world.

Think about it: Coppola is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time and he had ten years to conceive, prepare, make and release a film. He could've churned out blockbuster drivel like the ""Transformers"" movies (not that there's anything wrong with that, lol), but -- as a true artist -- he's beyond caring about creating popular popcorn fare and the ""success"" thereof. It brings to mind Willard's observations about Col. Kurtz in Coppola's renowned ""Apocalypse Now"": ""He could've gone for general, but he went for himself instead."" Francis could've gone for mindless and lucrative entertainment, but he had something more important in mind.

So, yes, I believe ""Youth Without Youth"" is a work of art, and certainly interesting and entertaining in some ways, but it requires willingness and effort to handle the 124 minutes of viewing time. it's a dense film, loaded with depth; it may even hold the secrets to life itself! Beyond that, it features some beautiful cinematography, music and women.

Speaking of the women, I found it curious that women are shown to be universally attracted to Dominic, the main character played by Roth. After all, Roth is short and hardly a George Clooney. But then I reflected on it and accepted it. Why? Because women have a sort of sixth sense -- typically called ""women's intuition"" -- where they see or sense things beyond the physical. In other words, Dominic had highly evolved and was, in essence, a superior human being. He may not have been Brad Pitt, but women instinctively picked up on his evolutionary superiority and drew to him like a magnet.

Another plus are the locations, shot in Romania, Bulgaria, the Himalayas and India.

Needless to say, this is a difficult film to rate. If you're in the mood for conventional cinematic entertainment ""Youth Without Youth"" won't fill the bill even though there are several entertaining elements, (the aforementioned cinematography, music, women and locations); but if you're looking for cinematic art and weighty mind food it's an ""A"". As such, my balanced rating is...

3131683,1,B0014FAIZC,"As other reviewers have pointed out -- what happened to Coppola?  He had complete control over this movie (director/producer/writing credit), and he makes a two hour & 4 minute film that is at least 40 minutes too long, with characters that we don't care about.  Tim Roth does not have the screen appeal to carry this film.  (How about Brad Pitt or George Clooney? Were they not available?)

Coppola really needs someone to edit his scripts before he goes into production, and cast the actors.

But, this is Francis Ford Coppola so once you begin watching it you have to stick it out to the end -- in hopes that there is a big payoff.  (Disappointed? Yes, but I didn't make inquiries.  I let it go.  Because this is the business we have chosen.)

One more comment: I was hoping that this sci-fi film would say something about everlasting love -- because that is the direction it was headed.  But no.

(If you want to watch a sci-fi film that has this theme and gives you a powerful ending, watch Solaris with George Clooney.  And it is only an hour and 39 minutes long.)",1399075200,,1070,4.458762886597938

3131691,3,B0014FAIZC,"This movie has some decent ingredients. Good music. Some creepy moments. Good premise. There's even some familiar Coppola-isms, like the ""old becomes young"" thing from ""Peggy Sue got Married."" But it could have been better.

People, some of them critics, level the rap that it's indecipherable and artsy. That's a clichd criticism and rarely true. This picture is guilty of those things for sure, but it doesn't suffer from them. No, it suffers from something worse: bad casting.

Can Tim Roth carry a feature? Should he? He's a good actor but in this case we're supposed to believe he's irresistible to young women. Sorry, he isn't THAT good an actor. Every babe who walks across the screen either gropes, propositions, or obsesses over him. Many wind up in the sack with him.

In case you missed it, we're talking about Tim Roth. What's next, Martin Short as James Bond? Even Coppola feels the need to explain. In the commentary track, while assuring us that he's in no way implying that Roth isn't attractive, he says that anyone who was an ""improved version of a human male"" would be unbearably attractive to women, even if the guy was otherwise unattractive. The reason: ""women are always drawn to the most evolved guys.""  I couldn't tell whether he was dissing Tim Roth or women, but it was a typically-entertaining remark from Coppola and more fun than watching without the commentary.

As is the case in my movie reviews, the positives only apply to a rental or ""free"" viewing. If I had paid to watch this in a theater with other people sitting around I might have been disappointed or even pissed-off. But, for home viewing, it's not the worst film ever. Those looking for a better example of modern Coppola should check out ""Tetro"" instead.",1356480000,,1750,4.781456953642384

I hate to compare directors, but I think if Spielberg were to deal with this material it would be just as visually interesting but much more thought provoking and integrated.
5 Stars is lowering the bar quite a bit.
I guess there are Coppolla fans who geekily admire his technique, but it requires a coherent and involving script and story line too to make an exceptional movie.",1351814400,,593,4.5514018691588785
3131694,3,B0014FAIZC,"This is a film based on a book. Sometimes books make for great movies. Other times, they lead to movies that seem too short for the material that was in the book. This movie gives that impression. The plot of the film has an interesting premise, namely, the experiences of a man who has the opportunity to continue his academic career without aging after a freak accident. Unfortunately, the movie does not do a good job of developing the back story or some additional plot lines. The professor who suffers this fortunate accident had a lost love who seems to have been reincarnated. Unfortunately, we don't get much of the back story, so the impact of his meeting her is lessened. There is a secondary plot about his research into ancient languages which is aided by his girlfriend's regression into past lives that allows her speak extinct languages. Again, this seems like a fertile plot line that hasn't been very well-developed in the movie which lessons the impact. The characters are well-acted and are interesting in many ways, and the scenery is engaging. Overall, this film is just different enough to hold the viewer's interest, but it seems like there are a lot of gaps or missed opportunities that lead to an ending that is less engaging than it could have been. It seems as though what would be a number of important themes in the book just don't come through terribly clearly in the movie. Aside from this, it's a watchable film and is worth checking out.",1344384000,3,1470,4.7015503875969
3131695,2,B0014FAIZC,"I read Mircea Eliade's novella of the same name a few years back.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  It felt so pretentious; so full of, well...you know.  It was the type of story that was attempting to be profound, but at the end of the day it said next to nothing about anything and left a sour taste of someone who felt they were smarter than you but couldn't do anything more than say big words and fake some sort of intellectualism.  I was convinced, while reading the story, that it was the type of story best suited for the screen.  Some novels should NEVER be filmed, and then some stories should NEVER be written.

There was something about `Youth Without Youth' that seemed so cinematic.

So, with that idea in mind, I was somewhat excited to see Coppola's film adaptation.  It took me long enough (like five years to be exact), but my lack of motivation was certainly caused by my distaste for the book the film stemmed from.  Still, while settling into my living room to watch this last night I was happy.  I had been waiting to see Coppola, a proven cinematic wonder, tackle this prose and make something astonishing out of it.

Apparently my hopes were too high.

It seems that even a visionary genius like Francis Ford Coppola is unable to make something out of nothing and so, when the dust settles, all we are left with is a pretty piece of nothing.  The cinematic touches are stunning.  The cinematography, set design and costumes are beautiful to look at.  The visual embellishments are well played and add trinkets to the film's overall presence; but the story is still strangely vapid and pointless.  I hate watching a movie that is supposed to be mentally stimulating and find myself so bored I want to bore out my eyeballs rather than watch another minute of it.

OUCH.

I applaud Coppola for accepting the challenge (which he even notes it was, for he clearly states in the forward to Eliade's novella that he didn't understand this story) but the fruits of his labor were minor and really didn't validate attempting such a bore.",1332374400,4,2051,4.603305785123967
3131696,5,B0014FAIZC,"Over the years the Coppola Family et al. have demonstrated that win, lose or draw, they choose to craft films as provocative as they are visually stimulating. Youth Without Youth is no exception [1].

On the eve of World War II aging scholar Dominic [Tim Roth] is struck by a bolt of lightning. Instead of dying he rejuvenates, gaining superhuman intelligence.

Hitler's spies and 'scientists' learn of his recovery and will stop at nothing to kidnap and 'study' Dominic. Seduced and compromised by an exotic and alluring Nazi intelligence operative [Alexandra Pirici], he flees across wartime Europe...

Youth Without Youth is both love story and mystic journey. Matt Damon cameos nicely. There are fine performances by Alexandra Maria Lara (Dominic's once and future love), Bruno Ganz and Andre Hennicke. Shot in the USA, Romania, France, Italy and Germany the production schedule was almost as far-ranging as the plot (based on a novella by luminary Mircea Eliade).

3131697,1,B0014FAIZC,"I won't repeat what others have so eloquently written about the movie.  You can read Grady Harps's review for that information.

There were many episodes in this ""paranormal"" movie that were unrelated to any other episode.  One example:  The main character climbs into a cave where there is *gasp* a skeleton. This scene is completely unrelated to anything, and is never mentioned again.  As the movie moves along, I kept thinking that the various events would lead up to something important, but was disappointed.

The ""love"" story, a short part of the whole, was boring.  This lady shows up, and the main character falls in love with her.  There is no information about her; where she came from, who she is, what she does, nothing. Therefore, I couldn't care less that they fall in love.

3131701,4,B0014FAIZC,"I've been looking forward to watching Youth Without Youth for two main reasons: Mircea Eliade, on of the more readable and thought-provoking philosophers and historians of religions - ""The Sacred and the Profane"", ""A History of Religious Ideas"" - and, it turns out, a fiction writer of meaning and substance, his work with deep roots in the very myths the author has been exploring for his entire life as a scholar and a writer of fiction. The other reason is Francis Ford Coppola, the legendary, talented, uncompromising movie maker, known to most of us for his ""Godfather"" trilogy. Add to the mix Tim Roth (Dominic), Bruno Ganz and the talented Alexandra Maria Lara (Laura/Veronica) a cameo appearance by Matt Damon and a VERY talented and enthusiastic support from a large team of Romanian actors and movie crew into the mix and we should expect a superior piece of cinematography. [Interestingly, Lara played Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary alongside Ganz' Hitler in critically acclaimed ""The Downfall""].

The story/plot is complex/ambiguous enough and open to interpretation - a good thing - to cover in a short review. It's probably sufficient to state that it's the story of a man, unexpectedly and perhaps undeservedly being offered a second chance at re-living his life. Or maybe what he gets is an extension or it may be life extended through a dream or a dream extended through... no good stories breaching into the fantastic and the mythical can provide actual 'answers' because they would become trivial then. But, there's the story, and then there's the movie that came out of it and this is a brief review of the movie.

Youth Without Youth (the movie) is an interesting example of what happens (in reality) when one of the world's leading movie directors takes an uncommonly rich, thought-provoking, complex tale and attempts to translate it into cinematography on a limited budget. And, since money talks loudly when making a movie, a small budget would dictate the movie's length, the talent employed, the number of takes, the extent of the 'on location' scenes, the credibility of special effects and so on. Coppola was constrained to filming most of the movie in Romania - a beautiful country and the scenes that depict the Romanian reality are great but Romania's mountains aren't nearly as grand as the Himalayas, making the parts that are supposed to take place in India not so convincing. Then, it's the accents. It's perhaps acceptable for the actors portraying Romanian characters to speak English with a Romanian accent but then Roth's English - playing the Romanian linguist Dominic Matei - is perfect. And then we see or rather hear Italians speaking Italian with a Romanian accent, Germans speaking German with what appears to be a Romanian accent... it's distracting, ESPECIALLY in a movie where 'language' plays such an important part.

The plot is quite compelling and, thanks to professor Eliade's literary talent and scholarship, extremely thought-provoking, this being that kind of movie that MUST be watched more than once and then watched again. And by the second watching, the accent distractions begin to fade into the background but more careful editing might have improved - a Nazi agent seductress with a swastikas stenciled on her bra's straps and keeping a copy of Mein Kampf under the mattress add cartoon-like elements to a story that seems to want to push the viewer into a mode where free thought and boundless speculation are encouraged.

So... a 'difficult' plot that allows itself to be interpreted and re-interpreted by the viewer almost at will, above average acting from Tim Roth (playing his characters at ages ranging from 20 to near-100 years old) and Alexandra Maria Lara as a generally uncomprehending, helpless, stunned partner. Coppola was great at making it all happen, including the actual financing of the entire project. The visuals are generally good for a movie that couldn't afford CGIs or any enhancements but some of the 'locations', especially the 'Indian' backgrounds aren't always convincing. The soundtrack which is adequate even if it lacks the usual surround sound effects that movies with a larger budget can afford and the music is sometimes inspired. After watching the movie twice I can't help but ask myself ""would this gain much from the larger budget Hollywood treatment?"" And my answer is ""probably not"" so, flawed as it is, I prefer ""Youth Without Youth"" the way it ended up to be - with me, the viewer, able to eventually ignore the small flaws and distractions and immerse myself into Eliade's world of myth and possibilities. In my case, reading the actual story&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Youth-Without-Youth-Univ-of-Chicago/dp/0226204154/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Youth Without Youth (Univ. of Chicago)</a>&nbsp;made it for a complete experience.

In ""Youth Without Youth,"" the protagonist, Dominic Matei, quite literally, gets a second lease on life.  Dominic is a frail man of seventy when, on Easter morning in 1938, he is struck by lightning while crossing a street in Bucharest.  But rather than dying or being forever disfigured, Dominic undergoes an amazing transformation as a result of his experience - sort of his own resurrection into eternal life:  for he not only returns to the body he had when he was in his 30s (think of this as a kind of ""17 Again"" with substance), but he develops the mental acuity and telekinetic powers of a ""superman"" as well.  This is quite a boon for an ambitious writer whose primary goal in life has been to survive long enough to complete a comprehensive and exhaustive work on human language and consciousness.  Yet, as his mental faculties increase at an ever-accelerating rate, Dominic's life becomes a dizzying and eventually undifferentiated blur of reality and hallucinations, dreams and memories.  Soon, the Nazis have made him an object of ""study,"" determined to use him as a guinea pig in their efforts to create a ""master race.""  But that's only half the story, which extends well into the late 1960s, with Dominic holding onto his eternal youth at virtually every step of the drama.

Impeccably produced, written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""Youth Without Youth"" is a fascinating mixture of war time drama, unrequited love story, psychological study, ancient and primordial mysticism and sci-fi fantasy.  The screenplay, based on the story by Romanian writer Mircea Eliade, provides plenty of food for thought for those willing to dig into its deeper themes of time and the through-line of human history, and a feast for those who like a challenging story, solidly constructed and solidly told.  The structure is admittedly episodic in nature, but it's only because the movie is utterly unafraid of veering off into intriguing and wholly unexpected paths when it feels the need to do so.  This keeps the movie perpetually fresh and the audience thoroughly intrigued from first frame to last. It isn't important that the movie make perfect sense at, every moment; what's crucial is that we be willing to put ourselves in the hands of the filmmakers for the time it takes to tell their story - to go where they want to take us.  And those places are fascinating.

Tim Roth carries the film with his beautifully understated embodiment of a man trying desperately to understand his place in the world, and Alexandra Maria Lara is heartbreaking as the loving, troubled young woman with similar issues who briefly joins him on his journey.

With its enigmatic storytelling and its refusal to spell everything out in simplistic terms for a spoon-fed audience, ""Youth Without Youth"" risks alienating a large segment of the ticket-buying public.  But for all those with an appreciation for the novel and the unique, ""Youth Without Youth"" is an unheralded gem to be reveled in and savored.",1275350400,3,3004,4.9541832669322705

3131706,4,B0014FAIZC,"I don't know if you're into metaphysics, mythology, psychology, and Eastern philosophy.  If these things interest you, you will probably love this movie.

Based on the book by Mircea Eliade, who has explored many cultures, and religious paths, who has written books on alchemy and about shamanism, and spirituality,  Youth without Youth trips through the wires of your higher consciousness.

As you watch, the captivating images that unfold onscreen, immediately make you aware that you are not dealing with an ordinary filmmaker.  If you press the subtitles button, what you see is not subtitles but a readable commentary by Francis Ford Coppola, which I found added to my understanding.  He explains how the lightning is awakening. He mentions Prometheus, and Frankenstein's monster being created by lightning.  I thought about Saul being converted by a lightning strike.

Dominic Matei, old and bitter, is struck by lightning.  He regresses in age to become a young man.  Nurses notice his virility with pleasure. His intelligence grows. Sinister people want to  tap his potentiality.  He sees another version of himself in the mirror, a duality, but is it conflicting, or does it open doors.  He meets a woman, who looks like the love of his life, but is a totally different woman.  They engage.  They travel.

Along the way the mind, (I loved the four probabilites) reincarnation, linguistics, bridging the gap between dream and reality, and consciousness are explored through Dominic reexperiencing youth without youth.

I had a great dream after seeing this, that paralelled the movie. I was not struck by lightning, but I did get an electric shock. It seemed significant. I don't know if you will have a dream after seeing this movie.  Only one way to find out I suppose.

3131707,4,B0014FAIZC,"This film by Francis Ford Coppola is based on the short story by Romanian writer Mircea Eliade.  Perhaps that is what is the trouble with the movie.  Plot of the story is so multi-layered and complex that making a movie was no easy task.

Tim Roth plays an elderly linguistics professor who never managed to finish his one major work regarding the origins of the language.  He is old and lonely, his life void of his one true love and his professional life work unfinished.  One rainy day, he walks the streets of Bucharest and gets hit by the lightening.  Before long, he makes remarkable recovery, starts looking 35 years younger and due to historical circumstances of the time (WWII) gets second chance in life.  But even the second chances have their steep price.  He must wrestle with his inner self that is trying to take sides between good and evil?  Can he stay on the side of good and still acomplish his life's work?

Movie is visually very pleasing.  I particlulary liked the part in Malta where now young professor finds his long lost love and wants to protect her at all costs.  However, deep philosophical debates about consciousness and subconsciousness, soul reincarnation, power of words and language, legacy we as a human beings leave in the world is something tht really belongs to the written word rather than a film.

3131708,5,B0014FAIZC,"A mystery wrapped in an enigma encapsulated in a movie.  Coppola has accomplished greatness again, managing to touch on the themes of lost love, and regained, youth, the nature of time, the search for knowledge, reincarnation and the non-linearity of time.

Is now now?  Is the me writing this the same me as yesterday or as tommorow?  Is the me that awakens exactly the same as the me the went to sleep the night before and what exactly happened in between?  Are the people of the 1940's or 1890's actually still there, all of us in the now that is the present, or is the intensity of an experience sufficient for it to defy time?

I Know exactly the genesis of Coppola's idea and the compulsion that drives it.  It is a universal imperative, contained in all of us and summarized in the first sentence of Aristotle's metaphysics.

It is in the sunlit radiance of the dawn as easily as in the memories of the lost loves of youth and it is in the confrontation with evil and the adherence to the sanctity of life, even unto the admission and allowance of its end.

As for the other, he knows it too and will admit it, though on his plane things are seen more completely, still it is not for him to partake of this life, that is reserved for us.  The choice is ours.  And that is the ultimate meaning of this remarkable and enjoyable film.

3131709,2,B0014FAIZC,"Note: I had to quote the other critic who did not find this movie so stunning, literarily. The same could be said about our world of high finance leading up to to stumble , slip, slide, collapse, shriek, horror, of 2007,&'08...and, we all suppose, '09!Did no one see this coming? Actually a few did...but as in all things...""The Few do not matter in the grand scheme of things one whit"". They are merely the messengers with party pooper news that just get whipped, shot, and killed.
It's understandable that Coppola might try a real art piece in his golden years. We can't help but feel he must have identified with the character, Dominic, who seriously questioned his worth and contribution to the world as he stumbled, slipped, and slid into his seventies. It is an awful thing, - you whippersnappers who can't imagine losing eyesight, hearing, and even mental faculties. It's a bad time. Many of us can identify with Dominic as well...questioning our worth and contribution to life...and maybe that we might have squandered our lives more prudently/artistically/theologically...certainly more theologically and morally. Even Charlie Sheen is redeeming himself with his very successful sit com, ""Two and a Half Men"".
The movie will not disappoint artistically. The cinematography is unsurpassed. But was that Francis...or his cinematographer?
It's the story line that seemed never to even glance at the goofy meter. The actors, all of them, are absolutely superb -each deserving of approbation - ( except for the sad fact that we are in an interminable age of ""Mumble Cinema""-meaning...no one wants to distort their pretty face by enunciating...just whisper, mumble pseudointellectual mumbo jumbo...sigh, and blub-glub foreign accents at a decible level well  below the music track...all sort of up there with ""The English Patient"" in 'Mrr,, hrr, bliperrpt"" incomprehensivble mutterings)... these actors portrayed one person reversing in time, and another ""Soul Transmigrating"" forward in time-  first to the  ancient beginnings of man and language...then forward to turn out to be Dominic's high school sweetheart. ""Awww"". (sorry ) I'm not supportive of the premesis, because it is more ten million dollar elaborate exposition of the ""ABC"" belief system=""Anything But Christianity"". Anyone who has never studied Judeo Christian Theology in great depth will contort their faces at this next remark-but all one needs to know about the history of the Earth and mankind is there in the Bible that  you so despise you refuse to read it. ( which is not unlike despising asparagus, without ever having tasted it! ) Genesis was dictated to Moses, because the one who created the world in six days, knows the future, and knew that this would be a huge question in the late history of mankind. Now think about this: If you were a general and planning your battle strategy against ""the despised enemy""...and your ""enemy"" knows the future and can and will anticipate your every move..how can you possibly plan any effective strategy at all? You can't win against a creator who demonstrates knowledge of the future all over the map. God created a ""terrarium""; and the jealous kid next door was envious, and introduced toxins when God's attention wandered. It will take thousands of years to straighten out the putrified gene pool...but straighten it out He will...and the brat next door will ""get his just due, and all who went over to his side"". In the meantime, evil does win, and win big. But in the end, the oil will be separated from the water. It takes time, that's all.
Now a few million folks came up with 'some kind of explanation'...but it is only that...""some kind of explanation""-namely Buddhists and Hindus, Zorastrians, et. al. O.K., great. But in the end, they are each and every one- all ""wannabee"" religions. Incidentally, religious people are NOT what God is looking for or seeking to rescue. Religious people are interested Only in familiar rituals handed down from generation to generation. Anything odd frightens them...hence the sadistic persecution of the ""odd person"" in High School= Something that compels folks at the synagogue and the Church to all dress and act alike...fear of persection. It is all tragicomedy. It is only those who have hit rock bottom so hard that they cried out for help in humility, and God lifts these very people out of the ""vortex to perdition"", thus ""saving"" them. If one has lived a life of priveledge all of one's life...these poor souls cannot possibly distinguish between what is resplendent and what is repugnant. This explains Ron Howard's anti religious zeal. ( prime expample of a life of priveledge ) All semi erudite/pseudo intellectual mincing about in powdered wigs, sniffing the snuff of our fame and fortune= swill, created by a Brit, where Darwin is has become the God of all creation.
And this in turn has more to do with making large amounts of filthy lucre, and absolutely nothing to do with enlightening john q public.
Meaning, we are back to the ""goofy meter pegging""...all over the map.... the poor little rich boys simply don't realize at all what bleating, Dodo Birds and useless Gnats they have become...and soon to be extinct themselves-and haven't the foggiest clue...thus they , like Dominic, have utterly wasted their lives.

There's no doubt that the photography is gorgeous; but that's all about its merits. Actually, there's about 8 to 10 movies in here and none makes complete sense. The first plot about a 70 year-old linguist who is literally hit by a thunderbolt and regains youth takes you to another one and then another and then another, with thin (or none)substantial relation between them, being its pretentiousness the only linking root. Crowded with bizarre characters, the confusing story depicts - besides the hero - a wise scientist, a bunch of nazis trying to kidnap the linguist, a girl with memories of lost love, spies, more nazis and many more. The intriguing anecdotes take you from Rumania to India, Malta and Switzerland, but actually the movie goes nowhere. I's hard to make much sense out of such a muddle.

Yes it is true that the director explores some interesting philosophical ideas, particularly Eastern wisdom, but overall I found the project disjointed and imperfect.  Some of the powers of the main protagonist, such as
digesting a book's contents by merely passing his hand over the volume, are utterly unconvincing.  Interesting ideas, beautiful cinematography, and good acting cannot overcome weaker plot and poorer editing.  As it turns out, I much preferred that other (science) fiction movie about a person struck by lightning, entitled ""Powder.""",1212624000,8,760,5.064
3131715,5,B0014FAIZC,"YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH is for this viewer one of the most creative and genuinely intelligent and beautiful films to be released in some time.  Francis Ford Coppola has utilized the finest points of his gifts as a movie creator and the result is a mesmerizing, quasi-hallucinatory exploration of the fine book by the Romanian writer Mircea Eliade.  Not only is Coppola's screenplay challenging and complex, it is also a well-developed guide to making visual the concept of Eliade's at times perplexing story.  The cinematography by Mihai Malaimare Jr. is moody and captures the surrealism of the tale, and the musical score is by the great contemporary composer Osvaldo Golijov who has taken every element of Romania mysticism and culture and translated them into a miraculous musical brocade.

Dominic Matei (Tim Roth in a brilliant performance) is a 70-year-old professor whose sheltered life has been spent in his thwarted exploration of the origin of language.  The old man is struck by lightning and survives under the care of puzzled physicians and as he shows signs of life, Professor Stanciulescu (Bruno Ganz) is at his side, helping Matei to learn to communicate and eventually accompany him through his complete recovery. Matei grows young in appearance and is able to time travel through the decimation WW II brought to his native Bucharest, altering his identity as he is given a second chance at a life he never experienced, a life that includes a love affair with a woman who closely resembles his early love Laura and now falls in love with him as Veronica (Alexandra Maria Lara).  In a Dorian Gray mode Matei lives for years as an ageless man, able to communicate with his 'double' who is visible only to Matei.  His condition intrigues the interest and suspicions of both the Nazis and journalists and academic colleagues until certain tidal events change Matei's course and he regresses into old age, retuning to the moment of time when he was first struck by lightening.  It is a story of the quest of eternal youth and the Faustian consequences that accompany that journey.

The tone of the film is operatic and with the majority of the cast drawn from some of Romania's finest actors, the quality of performances is uniformly outstanding.  Tim Roth is remarkably superb in this challenging role, a performance that deserves acclaim from a very wide audience. YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH is Coppola at his finest.  Highly recommended.

3366178,4,B0014FAIZC,"Released in 2007, ""Youth Without Youth"" was Francis Ford Coppola's return to filmmaking after a ten-year absence. The story revolves around a 70 year-old man (Tim Roth) in Romania at the outset of WWII who is struck by lightning and miraculously regains his youth and now looks like a 40 year-old man. He acquires amazing powers as well, like psycho-kinesis and the ability to ""read"" a book by ""scanning"" it with his mind. The Nazi's catch wind of his incredible evolution and want to study him to create the perfect race (or whatever). The second half of the film takes place after the war years when the man finds a woman who looks like a young version of his deceased love (Alexandra Maria Lara). Incredibly she too is struck by lightning with differing results and it aids in his research on the origins of languages.

The film brings to mind two films from the mid-90s that also address people with fascinating powers -- ""Powder"" and ""Phenomenon."" The latter was decent whereas the former shot for greatness and in some ways attained it. ""Youth Without Youth"" is completely different in tone, mostly due to the WWII time-frame, but also because it's less of a wannabe blockbuster and more artsy and nigh unfathomable.

It has been said that ""Youth Without Youth"" was an intensely personal project for Coppola. For one reason or another, the topic -- based on a book -- resonated with him and he was driven to convey it on film. You get the impression that Coppola had discovered the answer to the mysteries of life and wanted to share it with the world.

Think about it: Coppola is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time and he had ten years to conceive, prepare, make and release a film. He could've churned out blockbuster drivel like the ""Transformers"" movies (not that there's anything wrong with that, lol), but -- as a true artist -- he's beyond caring about creating popular popcorn fare and the ""success"" thereof. It brings to mind Willard's observations about Col. Kurtz in Coppola's renowned ""Apocalypse Now"": ""He could've gone for general, but he went for himself instead."" Francis could've gone for mindless and lucrative entertainment, but he had something more important in mind.

So, yes, I believe ""Youth Without Youth"" is a work of art, and certainly interesting and entertaining in some ways, but it requires willingness and effort to handle the 124 minutes of viewing time. it's a dense film, loaded with depth; it may even hold the secrets to life itself! Beyond that, it features some beautiful cinematography, music and women.

Speaking of the women, I found it curious that women are shown to be universally attracted to Dominic, the main character played by Roth. After all, Roth is short and hardly a George Clooney. But then I reflected on it and accepted it. Why? Because women have a sort of sixth sense -- typically called ""women's intuition"" -- where they see or sense things beyond the physical. In other words, Dominic had highly evolved and was, in essence, a superior human being. He may not have been Brad Pitt, but women instinctively picked up on his evolutionary superiority and drew to him like a magnet.

Another plus are the locations, shot in Romania, Bulgaria, the Himalayas and India.

Needless to say, this is a difficult film to rate. If you're in the mood for conventional cinematic entertainment ""Youth Without Youth"" won't fill the bill even though there are several entertaining elements, (the aforementioned cinematography, music, women and locations); but if you're looking for cinematic art and weighty mind food it's an ""A"".

Tim Roth does not have the screen appeal to carry this film.  (How about Brad Pitt or George Clooney? Were they not available?)

Coppola really needs someone to edit his scripts before he goes into production, and cast the actors.

But, this is Francis Ford Coppola so once you begin watching it you have to stick it out to the end -- in hopes that there is a big payoff.  (Disappointed? Yes, but I didn't make inquiries.  I let it go.  Because this is the business we have chosen.)

One more comment: I was hoping that this sci-fi film would say something about everlasting love -- because that is the direction it was headed.  But no.

People, some of them critics, level the rap that it's indecipherable and artsy. That's a clichd criticism and rarely true. This picture is guilty of those things for sure, but it doesn't suffer from them. No, it suffers from something worse: bad casting.

Can Tim Roth carry a feature? Should he? He's a good actor but in this case we're supposed to believe he's irresistible to young women. Sorry, he isn't THAT good an actor. Every babe who walks across the screen either gropes, propositions, or obsesses over him. Many wind up in the sack with him.

In case you missed it, we're talking about Tim Roth. What's next, Martin Short as James Bond? Even Coppola feels the need to explain. In the commentary track, while assuring us that he's in no way implying that Roth isn't attractive, he says that anyone who was an ""improved version of a human male"" would be unbearably attractive to women, even if the guy was otherwise unattractive. The reason: ""women are always drawn to the most evolved guys.""  I couldn't tell whether he was dissing Tim Roth or women, but it was a typically-entertaining remark from Coppola and more fun than watching without the commentary.

I hate to compare directors, but I think if Spielberg were to deal with this material it would be just as visually interesting but much more thought provoking and integrated.
5 Stars is lowering the bar quite a bit.

3366191,3,B0014FAIZC,"This is a film based on a book. Sometimes books make for great movies. Other times, they lead to movies that seem too short for the material that was in the book. This movie gives that impression. The plot of the film has an interesting premise, namely, the experiences of a man who has the opportunity to continue his academic career without aging after a freak accident. Unfortunately, the movie does not do a good job of developing the back story or some additional plot lines. The professor who suffers this fortunate accident had a lost love who seems to have been reincarnated. Unfortunately, we don't get much of the back story, so the impact of his meeting her is lessened. There is a secondary plot about his research into ancient languages which is aided by his girlfriend's regression into past lives that allows her speak extinct languages. Again, this seems like a fertile plot line that hasn't been very well-developed in the movie which lessons the impact. The characters are well-acted and are interesting in many ways, and the scenery is engaging. Overall, this film is just different enough to hold the viewer's interest, but it seems like there are a lot of gaps or missed opportunities that lead to an ending that is less engaging than it could have been. It seems as though what would be a number of important themes in the book just don't come through terribly clearly in the movie.

3366192,2,B0014FAIZC,"I read Mircea Eliade's novella of the same name a few years back.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  It felt so pretentious; so full of, well...you know.  It was the type of story that was attempting to be profound, but at the end of the day it said next to nothing about anything and left a sour taste of someone who felt they were smarter than you but couldn't do anything more than say big words and fake some sort of intellectualism.  I was convinced, while reading the story, that it was the type of story best suited for the screen.  Some novels should NEVER be filmed, and then some stories should NEVER be written.

There was something about `Youth Without Youth' that seemed so cinematic.

So, with that idea in mind, I was somewhat excited to see Coppola's film adaptation.  It took me long enough (like five years to be exact), but my lack of motivation was certainly caused by my distaste for the book the film stemmed from.  Still, while settling into my living room to watch this last night I was happy.  I had been waiting to see Coppola, a proven cinematic wonder, tackle this prose and make something astonishing out of it.

Apparently my hopes were too high.

It seems that even a visionary genius like Francis Ford Coppola is unable to make something out of nothing and so, when the dust settles, all we are left with is a pretty piece of nothing.  The cinematic touches are stunning.  The cinematography, set design and costumes are beautiful to look at.  The visual embellishments are well played and add trinkets to the film's overall presence; but the story is still strangely vapid and pointless.  I hate watching a movie that is supposed to be mentally stimulating and find myself so bored I want to bore out my eyeballs rather than watch another minute of it.

OUCH.

I applaud Coppola for accepting the challenge (which he even notes it was, for he clearly states in the forward to Eliade's novella that he didn't understand this story) but the fruits of his labor were minor and really didn't validate attempting such a bore.",1332374400,4,2051,4.603305785123967
3366193,5,B0014FAIZC,"Over the years the Coppola Family et al. have demonstrated that win, lose or draw, they choose to craft films as provocative as they are visually stimulating. Youth Without Youth is no exception [1].

On the eve of World War II aging scholar Dominic [Tim Roth] is struck by a bolt of lightning. Instead of dying he rejuvenates, gaining superhuman intelligence.

Hitler's spies and 'scientists' learn of his recovery and will stop at nothing to kidnap and 'study' Dominic. Seduced and compromised by an exotic and alluring Nazi intelligence operative [Alexandra Pirici], he flees across wartime Europe...

Youth Without Youth is both love story and mystic journey. Matt Damon cameos nicely. There are fine performances by Alexandra Maria Lara (Dominic's once and future love), Bruno Ganz and Andre Hennicke. Shot in the USA, Romania, France, Italy and Germany the production schedule was almost as far-ranging as the plot (based on a novella by luminary Mircea Eliade).

There were many episodes in this ""paranormal"" movie that were unrelated to any other episode.  One example:  The main character climbs into a cave where there is *gasp* a skeleton. This scene is completely unrelated to anything, and is never mentioned again.  As the movie moves along, I kept thinking that the various events would lead up to something important, but was disappointed.

The ""love"" story, a short part of the whole, was boring.  This lady shows up, and the main character falls in love with her.  There is no information about her; where she came from, who she is, what she does, nothing. Therefore, I couldn't care less that they fall in love.

3366198,4,B0014FAIZC,"I've been looking forward to watching Youth Without Youth for two main reasons: Mircea Eliade, on of the more readable and thought-provoking philosophers and historians of religions - ""The Sacred and the Profane"", ""A History of Religious Ideas"" - and, it turns out, a fiction writer of meaning and substance, his work with deep roots in the very myths the author has been exploring for his entire life as a scholar and a writer of fiction. The other reason is Francis Ford Coppola, the legendary, talented, uncompromising movie maker, known to most of us for his ""Godfather"" trilogy. Add to the mix Tim Roth (Dominic), Bruno Ganz and the talented Alexandra Maria Lara (Laura/Veronica) a cameo appearance by Matt Damon and a VERY talented and enthusiastic support from a large team of Romanian actors and movie crew into the mix and we should expect a superior piece of cinematography. [Interestingly, Lara played Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary alongside Ganz' Hitler in critically acclaimed ""The Downfall""].

The story/plot is complex/ambiguous enough and open to interpretation - a good thing - to cover in a short review. It's probably sufficient to state that it's the story of a man, unexpectedly and perhaps undeservedly being offered a second chance at re-living his life. Or maybe what he gets is an extension or it may be life extended through a dream or a dream extended through... no good stories breaching into the fantastic and the mythical can provide actual 'answers' because they would become trivial then. But, there's the story, and then there's the movie that came out of it and this is a brief review of the movie.

Youth Without Youth (the movie) is an interesting example of what happens (in reality) when one of the world's leading movie directors takes an uncommonly rich, thought-provoking, complex tale and attempts to translate it into cinematography on a limited budget. And, since money talks loudly when making a movie, a small budget would dictate the movie's length, the talent employed, the number of takes, the extent of the 'on location' scenes, the credibility of special effects and so on. Coppola was constrained to filming most of the movie in Romania - a beautiful country and the scenes that depict the Romanian reality are great but Romania's mountains aren't nearly as grand as the Himalayas, making the parts that are supposed to take place in India not so convincing. Then, it's the accents. It's perhaps acceptable for the actors portraying Romanian characters to speak English with a Romanian accent but then Roth's English - playing the Romanian linguist Dominic Matei - is perfect. And then we see or rather hear Italians speaking Italian with a Romanian accent, Germans speaking German with what appears to be a Romanian accent... it's distracting, ESPECIALLY in a movie where 'language' plays such an important part.

The plot is quite compelling and, thanks to professor Eliade's literary talent and scholarship, extremely thought-provoking, this being that kind of movie that MUST be watched more than once and then watched again. And by the second watching, the accent distractions begin to fade into the background but more careful editing might have improved - a Nazi agent seductress with a swastikas stenciled on her bra's straps and keeping a copy of Mein Kampf under the mattress add cartoon-like elements to a story that seems to want to push the viewer into a mode where free thought and boundless speculation are encouraged.

So... a 'difficult' plot that allows itself to be interpreted and re-interpreted by the viewer almost at will, above average acting from Tim Roth (playing his characters at ages ranging from 20 to near-100 years old) and Alexandra Maria Lara as a generally uncomprehending, helpless, stunned partner. Coppola was great at making it all happen, including the actual financing of the entire project. The visuals are generally good for a movie that couldn't afford CGIs or any enhancements but some of the 'locations', especially the 'Indian' backgrounds aren't always convincing. The soundtrack which is adequate even if it lacks the usual surround sound effects that movies with a larger budget can afford and the music is sometimes inspired. After watching the movie twice I can't help but ask myself ""would this gain much from the larger budget Hollywood treatment?"" And my answer is ""probably not"" so, flawed as it is, I prefer ""Youth Without Youth"" the way it ended up to be - with me, the viewer, able to eventually ignore the small flaws and distractions and immerse myself into Eliade's world of myth and possibilities. In my case, reading the actual story&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Youth-Without-Youth-Univ-of-Chicago/dp/0226204154/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Youth Without Youth (Univ. of Chicago)</a>&nbsp;made it for a complete experience.

In ""Youth Without Youth,"" the protagonist, Dominic Matei, quite literally, gets a second lease on life.  Dominic is a frail man of seventy when, on Easter morning in 1938, he is struck by lightning while crossing a street in Bucharest.  But rather than dying or being forever disfigured, Dominic undergoes an amazing transformation as a result of his experience - sort of his own resurrection into eternal life:  for he not only returns to the body he had when he was in his 30s (think of this as a kind of ""17 Again"" with substance), but he develops the mental acuity and telekinetic powers of a ""superman"" as well.  This is quite a boon for an ambitious writer whose primary goal in life has been to survive long enough to complete a comprehensive and exhaustive work on human language and consciousness.  Yet, as his mental faculties increase at an ever-accelerating rate, Dominic's life becomes a dizzying and eventually undifferentiated blur of reality and hallucinations, dreams and memories.  Soon, the Nazis have made him an object of ""study,"" determined to use him as a guinea pig in their efforts to create a ""master race.""  But that's only half the story, which extends well into the late 1960s, with Dominic holding onto his eternal youth at virtually every step of the drama.

Impeccably produced, written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""Youth Without Youth"" is a fascinating mixture of war time drama, unrequited love story, psychological study, ancient and primordial mysticism and sci-fi fantasy.  The screenplay, based on the story by Romanian writer Mircea Eliade, provides plenty of food for thought for those willing to dig into its deeper themes of time and the through-line of human history, and a feast for those who like a challenging story, solidly constructed and solidly told.  The structure is admittedly episodic in nature, but it's only because the movie is utterly unafraid of veering off into intriguing and wholly unexpected paths when it feels the need to do so.  This keeps the movie perpetually fresh and the audience thoroughly intrigued from first frame to last. It isn't important that the movie make perfect sense at, every moment; what's crucial is that we be willing to put ourselves in the hands of the filmmakers for the time it takes to tell their story - to go where they want to take us.  And those places are fascinating.

Tim Roth carries the film with his beautifully understated embodiment of a man trying desperately to understand his place in the world, and Alexandra Maria Lara is heartbreaking as the loving, troubled young woman with similar issues who briefly joins him on his journey.

With its enigmatic storytelling and its refusal to spell everything out in simplistic terms for a spoon-fed audience, ""Youth Without Youth"" risks alienating a large segment of the ticket-buying public.  But for all those with an appreciation for the novel and the unique, ""Youth Without Youth"" is an unheralded gem to be reveled in and savored.",1275350400,3,3004,4.9541832669322705

Based on the book by Mircea Eliade, who has explored many cultures, and religious paths, who has written books on alchemy and about shamanism, and spirituality,  Youth without Youth trips through the wires of your higher consciousness.

As you watch, the captivating images that unfold onscreen, immediately make you aware that you are not dealing with an ordinary filmmaker.  If you press the subtitles button, what you see is not subtitles but a readable commentary by Francis Ford Coppola, which I found added to my understanding.  He explains how the lightning is awakening. He mentions Prometheus, and Frankenstein's monster being created by lightning.  I thought about Saul being converted by a lightning strike.

Dominic Matei, old and bitter, is struck by lightning.  He regresses in age to become a young man.  Nurses notice his virility with pleasure. His intelligence grows. Sinister people want to  tap his potentiality.  He sees another version of himself in the mirror, a duality, but is it conflicting, or does it open doors.  He meets a woman, who looks like the love of his life, but is a totally different woman.  They engage.  They travel.

Along the way the mind, (I loved the four probabilites) reincarnation, linguistics, bridging the gap between dream and reality, and consciousness are explored through Dominic reexperiencing youth without youth.

I had a great dream after seeing this, that paralelled the movie. I was not struck by lightning, but I did get an electric shock. It seemed significant. I don't know if you will have a dream after seeing this movie.  Only one way to find out I suppose.

Tim Roth plays an elderly linguistics professor who never managed to finish his one major work regarding the origins of the language.  He is old and lonely, his life void of his one true love and his professional life work unfinished.  One rainy day, he walks the streets of Bucharest and gets hit by the lightening.  Before long, he makes remarkable recovery, starts looking 35 years younger and due to historical circumstances of the time (WWII) gets second chance in life.  But even the second chances have their steep price.  He must wrestle with his inner self that is trying to take sides between good and evil?  Can he stay on the side of good and still acomplish his life's work?

Is now now?  Is the me writing this the same me as yesterday or as tommorow?  Is the me that awakens exactly the same as the me the went to sleep the night before and what exactly happened in between?  Are the people of the 1940's or 1890's actually still there, all of us in the now that is the present, or is the intensity of an experience sufficient for it to defy time?

I Know exactly the genesis of Coppola's idea and the compulsion that drives it.  It is a universal imperative, contained in all of us and summarized in the first sentence of Aristotle's metaphysics.

It is in the sunlit radiance of the dawn as easily as in the memories of the lost loves of youth and it is in the confrontation with evil and the adherence to the sanctity of life, even unto the admission and allowance of its end.

Actually a few did...but as in all things...""The Few do not matter in the grand scheme of things one whit"". They are merely the messengers with party pooper news that just get whipped, shot, and killed.
It's understandable that Coppola might try a real art piece in his golden years. We can't help but feel he must have identified with the character, Dominic, who seriously questioned his worth and contribution to the world as he stumbled, slipped, and slid into his seventies. It is an awful thing, - you whippersnappers who can't imagine losing eyesight, hearing, and even mental faculties. It's a bad time. Many of us can identify with Dominic as well...questioning our worth and contribution to life...and maybe that we might have squandered our lives more prudently/artistically/theologically...certainly more theologically and morally. Even Charlie Sheen is redeeming himself with his very successful sit com, ""Two and a Half Men"".
The movie will not disappoint artistically. The cinematography is unsurpassed. But was that Francis...or his cinematographer?
It's the story line that seemed never to even glance at the goofy meter. The actors, all of them, are absolutely superb -each deserving of approbation - ( except for the sad fact that we are in an interminable age of ""Mumble Cinema""-meaning...no one wants to distort their pretty face by enunciating...just whisper, mumble pseudointellectual mumbo jumbo...sigh, and blub-glub foreign accents at a decible level well  below the music track...all sort of up there with ""The English Patient"" in 'Mrr,, hrr, bliperrpt"" incomprehensivble mutterings)... these actors portrayed one person reversing in time, and another ""Soul Transmigrating"" forward in time-  first to the  ancient beginnings of man and language...then forward to turn out to be Dominic's high school sweetheart. ""Awww"". (sorry ) I'm not supportive of the premesis, because it is more ten million dollar elaborate exposition of the ""ABC"" belief system=""Anything But Christianity"". Anyone who has never studied Judeo Christian Theology in great depth will contort their faces at this next remark-but all one needs to know about the history of the Earth and mankind is there in the Bible that  you so despise you refuse to read it. ( which is not unlike despising asparagus, without ever having tasted it! ) Genesis was dictated to Moses, because the one who created the world in six days, knows the future, and knew that this would be a huge question in the late history of mankind. Now think about this: If you were a general and planning your battle strategy against ""the despised enemy""...and your ""enemy"" knows the future and can and will anticipate your every move..how can you possibly plan any effective strategy at all? You can't win against a creator who demonstrates knowledge of the future all over the map. God created a ""terrarium""; and the jealous kid next door was envious, and introduced toxins when God's attention wandered. It will take thousands of years to straighten out the putrified gene pool...but straighten it out He will...and the brat next door will ""get his just due, and all who went over to his side"". In the meantime, evil does win, and win big. But in the end, the oil will be separated from the water. It takes time, that's all.
Now a few million folks came up with 'some kind of explanation'...but it is only that...""some kind of explanation""-namely Buddhists and Hindus, Zorastrians, et. al. O.K., great. But in the end, they are each and every one- all ""wannabee"" religions. Incidentally, religious people are NOT what God is looking for or seeking to rescue. Religious people are interested Only in familiar rituals handed down from generation to generation. Anything odd frightens them...hence the sadistic persecution of the ""odd person"" in High School= Something that compels folks at the synagogue and the Church to all dress and act alike...fear of persection. It is all tragicomedy. It is only those who have hit rock bottom so hard that they cried out for help in humility, and God lifts these very people out of the ""vortex to perdition"", thus ""saving"" them. If one has lived a life of priveledge all of one's life...these poor souls cannot possibly distinguish between what is resplendent and what is repugnant. This explains Ron Howard's anti religious zeal. ( prime expample of a life of priveledge ) All semi erudite/pseudo intellectual mincing about in powdered wigs, sniffing the snuff of our fame and fortune= swill, created by a Brit, where Darwin is has become the God of all creation.

3366211,3,B0014FAIZC,"I have very mixed feelings about this film. The idea of two people struck by lightning - one who grows young and the other who grows old - who just happen to fall in love is, to put it bluntly, an absurdity. Yes it is true that the director explores some interesting philosophical ideas, particularly Eastern wisdom, but overall I found the project disjointed and imperfect.  Some of the powers of the main protagonist, such as
digesting a book's contents by merely passing his hand over the volume, are utterly unconvincing.  Interesting ideas, beautiful cinematography, and good acting cannot overcome weaker plot and poorer editing.  As it turns out, I much preferred that other (science) fiction movie about a person struck by lightning, entitled ""Powder.""",1212624000,8,760,5.064
3366212,5,B0014FAIZC,"YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH is for this viewer one of the most creative and genuinely intelligent and beautiful films to be released in some time.  Francis Ford Coppola has utilized the finest points of his gifts as a movie creator and the result is a mesmerizing, quasi-hallucinatory exploration of the fine book by the Romanian writer Mircea Eliade.  Not only is Coppola's screenplay challenging and complex, it is also a well-developed guide to making visual the concept of Eliade's at times perplexing story.  The cinematography by Mihai Malaimare Jr. is moody and captures the surrealism of the tale, and the musical score is by the great contemporary composer Osvaldo Golijov who has taken every element of Romania mysticism and culture and translated them into a miraculous musical brocade.

Dominic Matei (Tim Roth in a brilliant performance) is a 70-year-old professor whose sheltered life has been spent in his thwarted exploration of the origin of language.  The old man is struck by lightning and survives under the care of puzzled physicians and as he shows signs of life, Professor Stanciulescu (Bruno Ganz) is at his side, helping Matei to learn to communicate and eventually accompany him through his complete recovery. Matei grows young in appearance and is able to time travel through the decimation WW II brought to his native Bucharest, altering his identity as he is given a second chance at a life he never experienced, a life that includes a love affair with a woman who closely resembles his early love Laura and now falls in love with him as Veronica (Alexandra Maria Lara).  In a Dorian Gray mode Matei lives for years as an ageless man, able to communicate with his 'double' who is visible only to Matei.  His condition intrigues the interest and suspicions of both the Nazis and journalists and academic colleagues until certain tidal events change Matei's course and he regresses into old age, retuning to the moment of time when he was first struck by lightening.  It is a story of the quest of eternal youth and the Faustian consequences that accompany that journey.

The tone of the film is operatic and with the majority of the cast drawn from some of Romania's finest actors, the quality of performances is uniformly outstanding.  Tim Roth is remarkably superb in this challenging role, a performance that deserves acclaim from a very wide audience. YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH is Coppola at his finest.  Highly recommended.

3366213,4,B0014FAIZC,"Tim Roth is great as an elderly Romanian professor of languages who is struck by lightning and made young again. Francis Ford Coppola's first film in ten years is visually inventive, dense and demanding - so naturally almost no one went to see it. It's off the wall, over the top, confounding and camp. Also very beautiful. A shot in the arm by a genuine artist that's miles ahead of the phoney art movies that got all the acclaim in Aught Seven.",1211068800,12,446,4.451219512195122

This is framed in the style of a jaunty low key fantasia with a bohemian european cinematic type of stylised culture in presentation. Overall i'd say this film is a nice non-literal but symbolically dramatic, self-contained piece of cinema experience.

The film mystified me enough that I requested it as a Xmas present, and upon a second viewing, I found the film much easier to follow.

8255519,3,B0014FAIZC,"This coulda been a couple of fairly good movies. One would be the elderly professor regretting lost love and unfinished work, who is struck by lightning and suddenly is young again, who is beginning to develop strange super brain powers (his linguistic powers suddenly increase dramatically, he can absorb the content of books by just looking at the cover, he can make a bad guy shoot himself, etc) , who is hunted by the Nazis as a fascinating human specimen, and who is apparently developing sexual super powers as well, as he turns out the Nazi spy sent to seduce him.  Another would be about the man whose life's work of identifying the Ur-language is suddenly greatly facilitated by his young wife being struck by lightning and manifesting the character of an ancient Indian woman who then begins to dream in older and older languages, and the pain of having to relinquish the quest for the Ur-language in order to save his wife from premature aging and death. Now in either or both of these movies, you would want to get Tim Roth. Even with Tim Roth, I don't know if you could actually make these movies successful, since the
philosophical and mystical doo dah that Coppola is apparently most interested in is really difficult to make interesting on film. Be that as it may, if you have Tim Roth getting younger, and seducing a Nazi with a swastika on her garter belt, and debating the issue of ""what is real?"" with his double, and floating naked in a bathtub, and chasing his distraught wife out onto a rock in the crashing sea, at least you have guaranteed yourself an enthusiastic and discerning female audience.",1421798400,3,1621,4.687719298245614
8255520,5,B0014FAIZC,"Deeply challenging, this film dances across the screen and dares its viewers to follow along, weaving symbolism, philosophy, and raw emotion into a world of magical realism that explores the many contours of the human soul.  Every scene is a struggle that demands rapt attention to the details and flourishes that Coppola has so painstakingly assembled into this masterpiece of cinematography, and for an audience willing to decipher its mysteries, its artistic rewards are infinite.  Artfully filmed and edited, Tim Roth's quiet and subtle performance draws viewers into a strange and ever-shifting psychological landscape, and I cannot wait to watch this film again with a more analytical eye to catch new ideas that I know I missed the first time around.  Bravo!  Encore!",1421798400,5,774,5.2682926829268295
