1833814,5,B00008AOUT,"Fan Favorite Lance Henrickson of ""Aliens"" plays a bomb squad specialist who takes a journey of microscopic proportions in this film.  I have to say I just picked it up to see him.

It obviously was made on a budget but it does have entertainment value. I would ignore all the other reviews if you don't mind cheesy effects and like action adventure with a positive ending.

This looks like one of those Sci Fi Channel movies of the week. Robin Givens puts in a good performance as a perky scientist the Lance Henrickson character falls for romantically.  Now if only Sci Fi could do a low budget version of Star Trek with the former actors they could concetrate on character and not special effects.

The thing I like about these low budget movies is the fact that it has a positive ending as opposed to negative one. In today's world we need a few more happy endings without any negativity.",1132963200,,891,4.509316770186335
1833815,2,B00008AOUT,"This is a pretty bad film, starting off like a thriller and then becoming sci-fi.  Some of the acting is quite amateurish and you have to wonder why Lance Henriksen and Robin Givens would associate themselves with it.  I guess they needed the money.  The accents, particularly the German, are quite poor and I doubt that they actually filmed much on location.  Where was it filmed though?  Americans and Hispanics and others seem to have hard accents, as if they are from Eastern Europe.  Israeli television suffers from the same problem with accents when they make TV shows pretending to be Americans.

There are a number of plot problems and the scene where they figure out the sequence to stop the nuclear timer is ridiculous.  The complexity of it does not follow.

The scenes where they are reduced to microscopic and in a sub remind me of Fantastic Voyage.  Although, just as another reviewer remarked, the original and its effects were better, even though they were pre-CGI.  They are injected into the dying terrorist's body to find and defuse a nuclear trigger.

I cannot recall any nudity although there is some action violence.",1115683200,2,1138,4.839378238341969
1833816,2,B00008AOUT,"ANTIBODY is definitely a mediocre ripoff of FANTASTIC VOYAGE, and what merits it has rests purely on some minor individual achievements.  First, William Zabka, long known villain of all his movies, dons a German accent, and plays a good guy who actually saves the day!  Lance Henricksen also plays a good guy, but one who seems desperately in need of Geritol.  And poor Robin Givens looks like a snow cone with that hairdo, and looks like she was in need of Ex-Lax.
The effects are pretty dismal, and although it maintained my interest, it's certainly not a film I would recommend you buy, but might rent when you're in the mood for a trip through the body!",1079136000,5,657,4.598290598290598
1833817,1,B00008AOUT,"My trail of bad movies continues with this sucker! I can challenge the director that I can do better CGI than what they cobbled together for this movie. First, movies like this make fun of legitimate technologies and then they abuse viewers by giving it a cool name. Anyway, the movie is a modern take on Innerspace but the graphics in the 20 year old original were better than these.
Stay away!",1071014400,6,395,4.5
1833818,1,B00008AOUT,"An awful European remake of the classic ""Fantastic Voyage"".  The story has been modernized to a terrorist with a nuclear bomb detonator implanted in his head instead of a cold war era scientist with top-secret information, but otherwise the story is the same.  The acting by Lance Henriksen and Robin Givens is good, the rest of the cast just don't come across as believable.  The special effects are reasonably good CGI.  Although the giant skin mite swimming through the bloodstream is just a bit too far out there for me.
My suggestion is to rent Antibody and Fantastic Voyage and do a double feature.",1062720000,3,604,4.778846153846154
7981185,2,B00008AOUT,"Gaynes (Lance Henriksen) must shrink down and enter the body of a criminal in a mini-sub to get a micro-detonator. He has a daughter, used to work for FBI and Robin Givens is in it. Our bad guy is a caricature of bad guys giving a ridiculous speech. I had to ask, ""Is that acting? Is that the scene the director wanted?"" He was cheesy.

If you have never seen the film ""Fantastic Voyage"" I would recommend to watch it instead and avoid this made for TV quality film.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. No anti-bodies getting ripped off a Rachel Welch.",1460851200,,553,4.359223300970874
7981186,3,B00008AOUT,We had fun watching this movie just so we could make fun of it.  I'm glad we didn't have to pay to watch this in a theatre!,1379289600,,123,3.5555555555555554
7981187,5,B00008AOUT,"Is there anything besides taking Moscow in winter that the Germans can't do? Great movie, it did not take the lazy route Horseman insisted upon. It is an involved tale and requires patience from the viewer, the payoff is well worth it.",1367107200,,235,4.619047619047619
7981188,1,B00008AOUT,"You really have to ask yourself how stuff like this gets funded? Then there's the other side in that how desperate do you have to be to get on board with a project like this?

I tried to put the corny aspect of ""everything"" aside and just watch it, but found it impossible with the set looking like it was built by grade-school children that got hold of their parents reefer stash and a bottle of Jim Beam......... One of those kids got hold of a staple gun and two or three billion staples!",1364860800,,491,4.223404255319149
7981189,2,B00008AOUT,"i disagree it's a rip off of ""fantastic voyage"".  yes, the theme is similar, being shrunk down and injected into a body and the political overtones of the movie, but it's a different movie made decades later.  i agree with the reviewer that stated it should be ""pg"" rather than ""r"" rated.  nothing really warrents that rating.  it's more espionage than sci-fi and the cover misleads you in that.  overall, it's okay, and it is full screen.  i'm a fan of lance henriksen, so enjoyed it from that vantage.  i'd recommend renting versus owning it though.  or buy it really cheap, like i did at a flea market.",1267574400,,605,4.537037037037037
7981190,5,B00008AOUT,"But ""Fantastic Voyage"" can never be replaced. ""Antibody"" is an updated version of ""FV"" but without all the details. The script was hokey, the plot decent. I could have done without Robin Givens. Her hairstyle must have been shellacked. Nary a hair out of place.

It was nice seeing Lance Henriksen (TV's ""Millenium""'s Frank Black) again. He looks even better than he did in the TV show! I found his daughter to be terribly miscast. He refers to her as 17, but she looked mid-20's if a day. Other than the too fast clock counting down the time left to save the day, it was very enjoyable! I agree it didn't deserve an R rating - the cussing was it, but it was so well timed and so apropos to the situations. The humor was enjoyable, and in a couple places I expected them to remark ""we've gone to plaid"". It lacked the sexual nature of Raquel Welch - in ""FV"" everyone got to grope her to get the hardened pink gel off her voluptuous form - but all in all I would recommend it. No, it isn't ""Fantastic Voyage"" - but then again, what could ever be again?

I'm purchasing the dvd because my husband and I had a good time watching it and laughing at its many humorous moments. It could have had a little more detail in the voyage through the body, but it was fun.",1261267200,2,1258,4.2594142259414225
7981191,3,B00008AOUT,"It's actually unfortunate that ANTIBODY is rated R. Aside from some violence and a bit of language, it could have easily been PG-13 or even PG. Yes, it's a CGI-heavy update of FANTASTIC VOYAGE (sort of). Yes, it has lots of goofy situations and cornball dialogue. Still, the kid in me enjoyed it and smiled at the internal micro-universe idea. Lance Henriksen (ALIENS, PUMPKINHEAD, NEAR DARK) and the beautiful / talented Robin Givens are a comfortable match, making the most of their relatively silly roles. So, if you can shift your brain into F-U-N mode and relax, you'll have a good time w/ this one...",1260057600,5,606,4.780952380952381
7981192,2,B00008AOUT,"This movie ripps of an old classic i saw when i was young, about  shrinking people and an innerspace ship then injecting a pateint. the first was to kill a tumor i beleive but this one is to stop a nano detonation device.  its kinda lame , especially if you've seen this story line before.",1210982400,,289,4.236363636363636
7981193,1,B00008AOUT,"The most astonishing aspect of this film is the credit list.(All those people ?..how?)Did it really take five carpenters to bang up the shed they used as the interior for the craft?.Five people is unbelievable...and not one could have been a carpenter..even though it was quite obviously a

wooden project (for some ten year old ).The seats on the craft..have to be seen to be believed...wood with a few coats of matt paint..and done really poorly. And no fancy monitors or keyboards..just shelfing and silly flourescent lighted corridors..incredible.

This film was made from materials culled from a old  shed..The story line was so not so silly for a sci fi but what excecution.

The main character is inside a body disarming a weapon...gets a phone call from his daughter that she is at the Paris Airport. Speaking from Munich..he asks her to stay in the airport  lobby while he then just seems to pop over and meet as if only  a moment has  elasped...very good. How could so many people have had the gall to have asked to have been paid for having contributed to this. So bad ..you have to watch to believe it.",1141084800,3,1114,4.682051282051282
7981194,1,B00008AOUT,"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I love sci-fi and have been a fan of Henriksen from Aliens and through projects like Millenium. When I saw this on sale for $5, I picked it up - expecting a bargain. I have to honestly say I would have felt bad getting it for free. Definately a B-movie, but that doesn't necessarily guarantee a bad movie. Horrible plot with a script to match, over the top acting, especially from the two ""gunners"". Just horrible.",1137024000,,461,4.5
