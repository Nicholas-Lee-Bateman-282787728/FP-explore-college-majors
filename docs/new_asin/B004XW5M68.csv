4497693,5,B004XW5M68,"This served as an invaluable asset.  Being given this information at the hospital under stress makes it difficult to remember.  Having the DVD at home allows for methodical review and repeat as needed.  This should be given for free to all heart patients when they are sent home.

4497694,5,B004XW5M68,"We bought this DVD for a friend's father-in-law who was facing an open heart surgery. Watching with him as his follow up caregiver, We found this DVD easy to follow. When you're recovering from a traumatic experience like heart surgery, it's easy to get confused and overwhelmed with the terminology the doctor uses. RecoverRite made sense of his recovery process with the easy to follow visuals. He is now on the road to recovery and much more positive about full recovery because he has the knowledge to do so.  Thank you for creating this awesome product! I strongly recommend this product to anyone who is going to be getting heart surgery.",1325808000,5,644,4.801801801801802
4497695,5,B004XW5M68,"This DVD is thorough, concise and practical. Recovering from Heart Surgery explains in layman's terms exactly what that entails. It gives you visual guidelines to help you recover right. It's just what the ""doctor"" ordered. If you're confused about how to live your every day life after heart surgery and want to recover well and quickly, I can't recommend this video enough. It takes the mystery out recovering from heart surgery. Thanks for making it so simple!",1305072000,4,463,5.025974025974026
4497696,5,B004XW5M68,"I fortunately have not had to deal with heart surgery personally, but I bought this DVD from the Recoverrite website about 6 weeks ago to give it to a cousin whose husband was going in for a bypass. They told me it was a lifesaver and really helped them stay on track with his recovery. She said it was very simple and straightforward and addressed a lot of their questions, taking a lot of the uncertainty out of his return home. I'm happy to say my cousin's husband is pretty much back to his old self! I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who knows a heart patient or is a heart patient.",1304899200,4,598,4.254385964912281
8447477,1,B004XW5M68,Very disappointed.  Wanted to actually see what a heart patient goes through so to be prepared ahead if time with what to expect. This DVD was nothing more than a couple of paid actors sugar coating the obvious common sense stuff.  Save your money.  Wish I had!,1487116800,,261,4.51063829787234

8447485,5,B004XW5M68,"This DVD was so well done and so informative.  So many things we learned from it that the doctors didn't tell us about, i.e., buying shirts and bras that button/clasp in the front, a pillow over your seat belt.  It was very classy, very thorough and very -- not scary.  The best part was when the depression hit, we were able to recognize that it was part of the healing process and nothing unusual.  It really helped move us through the healing process.  Thank you SO much for this great product!",1405987200,5,497,4.417582417582418
