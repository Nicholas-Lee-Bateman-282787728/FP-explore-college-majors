It was the perfect mix of silliness, humor, pop culture and the supernatural. I would look forward to every Tuesday when it would air. The 8th episode of the show, and I remember it well, involved the hijacking of a plane. The following Tuesday was September 11th, and then the show never aired again.  I've always assumed these two events are connected and were the deciding factor in the show's cancellation. Comedy hitting too close to home with actual tragedy. Never the less, I miss this show and would have loved to see how it ended.  I hope they do release this on DVD.",1391644800,,683,4.5
8272690,5,B001993Y7M,"I would love to both see this spooky, funny show re-aired and released on DVD.  The Cast, Crew, Writers really didn't get a chance to develop this program to it's fullest potential. I realize that WB/UPN networks disolved in the CW merger but the quality of the programing disappeared. Yes Dead Last was quirky, but a great many of us are.  Television executives have forgotten the lessons of the thirties... When money is tight, the world facing Wars that seem unending and natural disasters... we could all use a little break from reality.  Shows like Dead Last, Enterprise, Special Unit 2 and Roswell to name a few give us a little light-heartness at the end of the day.",1303257600,2,673,4.686440677966102
8272691,5,B001993Y7M,"This show was one of those magnificent gems that was screened in the ""throw away"" hours after midnight here in New Zealand. I have waited in vain for a repeat screening, or, even better, a DVD release, as there were episodes that I missed. The premise was simple - trio of slacker musicians find a magic amulet and, as a result, can see and talk to dead people. Much hilarity combined with serious creepiness follows as the dead insist that the trio perform a variety of tasks for them. Dead Last was one of the few shows in the same genre that it could its own against the masterful work of Joss Whedon (Buffy, Angel). I look forward to its eventual release.",1280448000,2,659,4.409836065573771
8272692,5,B001993Y7M,"I really miss this show:  it was fun, creepy, crazy, with a terrific premise, cast and guest stars.  What really kills me is that this show didn't make it (thanks a lot, WB/UPN who are now CW), while shows like ""Charmed"" did stay on (ad nauseum).  This was the show that ""Charmed"" and others like it, really couldn't hold a candle or an EVP to.

I've been praying to the programing gods at SyFy to play all the episodes.  If you get a chance to see any episode of this show, don't miss it.  You won't be disappointed.",1269043200,4,517,4.224489795918367
