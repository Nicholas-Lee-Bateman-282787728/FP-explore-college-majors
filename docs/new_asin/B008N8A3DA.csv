5170268,5,B008N8A3DA,Ordered this for a Christmas gift for my 12 yr old daughter who likes watching Poirot on PBS- she loved it!  Many of these we have never seen before and they are all quality episodes. Ordered it on black Monday and got a great deal! Would highly recommend it for true Agatha Christie fans!,1356825600,,289,4.351851851851852
5170269,5,B008N8A3DA,"Bought this as a gift and recipient is happy.  There seems to be a wide range of prices for these sets, so check all the vendors.",1356739200,,129,3.9615384615384617
5170270,4,B008N8A3DA,This was a great purchase and a great watch--due to the length of time to watch these videos it's kinda best to not watch all at one time. But they are great,1356652800,3,157,3.9375
5170271,5,B008N8A3DA,"Considering when the originals were made and how no-one at that time could have envisaged the future need for hi definition quality, these discs really are amazing",1356566400,,163,5.074074074074074
5170272,5,B008N8A3DA,"I got into Poirot when I started to borrow them from the local library. I think the first one I ever saw was Murder on the Links, which was fine but I did not think too much of it, it was just something to watch for free that was somewhat amusing. However, as I continued to borrow them and watch them I began to fall in love with the show and the characters. I won't go into much detail about who's who and why they are so wonderful because if you are considering buying this collection you already know all that.

It was not long before I knew that I had to own every bit of David Suchet's Poirot but while I was ready to do the work to find out which episodes are in which collection, I was not ready to shell out a bunch of money to buy them individually. The release of Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Early Cases is a gift from above. In the order of the original U.K. broadcast, it collects the first 6 series in 6 individual cases (with 3 DVDs in each case) in a lovely outer box. They are great for someone who does not have any of the earlier DVDs but they are also perfect for those who are seeking an upgrade. I have watched some of the original versions from the library so I can compare. The new DVDs are remastered, making the picture quality much more crisp and best of all they now come with subtitles. The DVD menu is also different with a polished new look and easy navigation capability.

At one point I was thinking of waiting until they come out with Poirot: The Complete Collection but series 13 is yet to be aired, which is the last one but who could wait that long? Also, I am not sure if there will ever be a North American release of the complete collection. Acorn Media holds the rights to series 1 - 6 and 11 - 13, while A&E owns series 7 - 10, which are 12 feature length movies. So in addition to the Early Cases I have also purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agatha-Christie-Poirot-Definitive-Collection/dp/B004HJ0ZLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agatha Christie Poirot: Definitive Collection</a>, which collects series 7 - 10. Here's to hoping after series 13 Acorn releases Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Later Cases, collecting the remaining series.

Highly, highly recommended.",1356566400,59,2258,4.668341708542713
5170273,5,B008N8A3DA,"I LOVE Poirot. Bought all the releases from the begining. Saw this on Amazon at 66% off and as these are the bulk of the best ones (once Hastings & Miss. Lemon are gone, it just doesn't have the same zing) decided to get it a few days ago and open up some shelving space.  The picture quality is really good (DVD version) and it's in broadcast order, unlike the original releases.  Do yourself a favor and buy this set (or blu-ray if you prefer).",1356307200,8,446,4.235294117647059
5170274,5,B008N8A3DA,"I had some of these episodes on DVD and decided to get this complete version on Blu-Ray.  I could not be more pleased with the picture quality, and it is great to have all the episodes in one set in original order.  Donate all your old DVD versions to your local public library and buy this Blu-Ray version - you will love it.",1351641600,38,326,4.158730158730159
5170275,5,B008N8A3DA,"Remastered-Orig UK order Poirot Early Cases set is 45 mysteries solved by Poirot, the masterful Belgian `little gray cell' man who forever out-sleuths Scotland Yard. David Suchet is Poirot, enough said. It's a repackaging for the advantage of those who have not purchased them singly. Advanced picture quality, and I am told by my Blu-ray user friends, the best Poirot yet. All Agatha Christie stories make it fantastic, but Suchet makes the film adaptations soar to new heights. Humor, fantastic scenery & costuming appear. Poirot stories began in 1920 and the fictional character was granted a 1975 NYTimes front page obit.
Episodes are loaded with guest stars as well as regular recurring characters such as CI Japp (Philip Jackson), Hastings (Hugh Fraser) Poirot's right-hand, Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran).

SUBTITLES available for all 45 episodes. Airing began in1992. Masterpiece Mystery! It is CLASSIC UK sleuth TV, as applauded as the original books.

5170280,5,B008N8A3DA,"I had previously bought the standard definition complete Poirot set and was terribly disappointed in the poor image quality and the lousy packaging of the disks (many of the 33 disks arrived loose and floating around in the plastic retainers!) Thus I decided to return them and buy this remastered Blu Ray version of the ""Early Cases."" I am extremely pleased with video quality and have no regrets at all. While there are slight variations in quality between some of the episodes all are far better than the SD versions.

I have long favored the early seasons of Poirot, finding the later seasons far darker, both in image quality and content. These 45 episodes are to me, anyway, what Agatha would want. When the producers dropped the marvelous art deco intro and went darker and grainier with far more contrast I felt they had decided to go ""modern"" and play to a younger audience. That leaves this eighty year old Agatha Christie fan slightly annoyed (of course, most everything annoys me these days.)

Still, I might ultimately buy the rest of the episodes in Blu Ray, if only to have the complete collection, sitting proudly beside my remastered Joan Hickson Miss Marple set.",1501891200,5,1180,4.807881773399015

I have the same complete set, but bought mine as they were available individually.  My son in law one day asked if he could borrow one of my dvd's and I told him he could.  He has borrowed only one other complete volume since.  I ordered this set, hoping it would be different than the ones I was letting him borrow from, but since there was no description of what I was actually ordering, other than Poirot's complete set of 'The Early Cases'. I got him the same set. It won't have the same impact I was hoping for, but I do believe he will still enjoy them. I would really like if the seller would tell you what volumes are in the set, and maybe an episode title from each volume, so this doesn't happen to someone else.",1472256000,,829,4.098765432098766

I had watched most of them before on library DVD's but I am glad to have them for myself and I watch them very often.  I am glad they have become available on DVD for the fans to enjoy.  I have many other sets of mysteries, so when I watch an episode of Poirot after an interval, I very often do not know who the killer was though some of them I do.  I like the acting,  the music, the stories, the friendship among the main characters, the various settings, London and even faraway places.  It is a wonderful series.

5170342,5,B008N8A3DA,I grew up reading Agatha Christie novels and love her quirky detective. David Suchet is perfect as Poirot. I loved the series on PBS and want to own my own collection.,1394928000,,167,4.419354838709677
5170343,5,B008N8A3DA,"If you are a fan of this punctilious, albeit brilliant, little dandy then this is the compilation for you. Importantly, the image is crystal clear and one notices the tendency toward particularly balanced composition---very particular to the art deco motif of both the period and the series [look at a piece of deco jewelry to see what I mean]. In such a way, the mood-between-the-wars is conveyed very subtly. I also am taken with the costumes/dressing. Poirot one expect to be fastidiously perfect. And Miss Lemon is always charming. But its the Oxbridge-ian Captain Hastings that one looks to for both casual elegance and a boys naivtee that contrasts with Poirot's worldliness. All that and creative plots and beautiful image...what more can one want?",1394755200,5,755,5.096774193548387
5170344,5,B008N8A3DA,David Suchet is definitely the quintessential Poirot.  I have always wanted to have these mysteries.  I had enjoyed them greatly when they originally aired.  This is an excellent collection that I am sure any Poirot fan will be happy to own.  Hours of good quality viewing await you.,1394668800,,283,4.833333333333333

5170347,5,B008N8A3DA,"any yens you are having for the best actor ever to depict Agatha Christie's Poirot.  Captain Hastings is perfect and I enjoy Miss Lemon and Chief Inspector Japp.  I miss those characters in the later episodes very much.  (The actor who portrays Japp has eyes like Hitler and could play him in a movie).  Anyway, back to the point.  It's great and this was much less expensive than what was being sold for a time at Costco.  We're very glad we got it and it showed up in a timely manner.",1392422400,,486,4.285714285714286

All of Agatha Christies characters are wonderful and I enjoy watching all of their movies. I hope to own all of them eventually and watch them again after while.,1390953600,,313,4.7592592592592595

5170353,5,B008N8A3DA,This collection contains the episodes from the first six series of this wonderful production.  David Suchet's dedication to the role of Poirot is evident in every episode.  I hope the final seven series will come out in a similar collection so I won't have to buy any duplicates.,1389225600,,279,4.791666666666667
5170354,5,B008N8A3DA,I know I am certainly pleased with this collection of H. Poirot film adaptions.  As always Mr. Suchet and Acorn give a fabulous performance!!  I especially like having the early cases all together in one set.  It makes it simpler for me to be sure I've collected all of the available dramatizations of Miss Christie's stories.

5170356,2,B008N8A3DA,"I simply love Poirot and decided to order the full set of ""the Early Cases"", I also Ordered the ""Definitive Collection""..I did not think of the time it takes to watch all these lovely Poirot and by the time I got to the problem discs, My time to return had expired.  Two discs freeze and I can watch them if I turn off the Disc Player, turn it back on, eject the disc, reload and then watch for the segment and where the next ""scene"" is....Very tiresome.  The Christmas disc in the last pack will not load at all.  Soooo, my long awaited set will remain incomplete I guess, due to the policy of how quickly we need to return.  I would suggest you buying this set or the other one at a time and when you have plenty of time to watch them, though so if you also get a faulty product, you will be able get the service of returning the defective disc.",1387065600,24,847,4.115151515151515
5170357,5,B008N8A3DA,"I've viewed all of the Poirot films and I have to say that these early ones are the best. Unfortunately, I've already figured out the first four films within a few minutes of each one. I don't care much for the later ones that left out Inspector Japp, Miss Lemon and Hastings. Guess their contracts ran out or they wanted too much money.
Overall, if you are a fan of Poirot, Agatha Christie or British mysteries in general, you should enjoy this set. I do and look forward to seeing each film over and over again. The DVDs are of good quality with proper video and audio. Unlike a great many DVDs, I don't have to strain to hear the dialogue while the music hurt my ears.",1386806400,4,671,4.291338582677166

5170364,5,B008N8A3DA,"I am not commenting on the quality of the Poirot's; I found them good enough to buythis set.

The disks are organized according to seasons so some have a lot of installments and some less. Picture quality is excellent and everything is sub-titled. For this price don't bother buying the DVDs.

The package covers all 45 Poirot's of Seasons 1...7. (Note: 7 not 6)",1378080000,2,362,4.640625

Netflix had this on the ones you can watch right off the Tv but now it's in Disk only. (This is a TV show my husband use to watch with his mom growing up. So it was not happy to hear that Netflix delete from our seem line account.

5170369,4,B008N8A3DA,"While not perfect, the transfers of episodes in this Blu-Ray set are noticeably sharper than the previously released DVDs. Scenes that were shot in brighter light are pleasing to my eyes, while there is some graininess in the more dimly lighted scenes. This is most obvious during some interior scenes and outdoors at night. Others have pointed out the subpar picture quality of an extended portion of the Murder on the Links episode, and they're correct about that flaw. That shortcoming, however, is an anomaly in this set, since virtually all of the episodes look much better than their DVD (or VHS) counterparts. Even if you already own the DVD versions of many of these episodes, this Blu-Ray set is a worthwhile purchase if you can get the set at a substantial discount.",1374624000,6,776,4.842105263157895

5170380,5,B008N8A3DA,"The numbers of reviews submitted for the various multi-episode packages of David Suchet's portrayal of Agatha Christie's beloved Belgian detective Hercules Poirot is testament enough as to its popularity, with many going into considerable detail about each episode covered.

I'm not about to clog up the reviews with more of the same. If you know who Poirot is there's no need, and if you don't, many of these other great reviews will fill you in nicely. I simply wish to say that each meticulously portrays the time period (1920s to 1940s before the series reaches its end) as only British productions can, and with actors who do not overplay their roles in sticking as closely as possible to Agatha Christie's books.

As some have noted, these original episodes have more of an Art Deco and often brighter and less-brooding look to them with the semi-regular characters of his aide, Captain Arthur Hastings (Hugh Fraser), his secretary Miss Felicity Lemon (Pauline Moran), and Scotland Yard Chief Inspector James Harold Japp (Philip Jackson), each of whom more or less faded from Christie's books after entering the mid- to late-1930s.

The later episodes, some of which were produced by the A&E Network but still stuck flawlessly to the period in appearance, began to take on a darker side in their storylines (as did her books), with the only recurring characters being George, his valet, and detective fiction writer Ariadne Oliver (played by the brilliant actress Zo Wannamaker).

The only episodes not yet available on DVD are those of the final season, which were filmed the past year - Elephants Can Remember, The Big Four, The Labours Of Hercules, Dead Man's Folly, and Curtain. The last, which brings our favourite detective, now wheelchair-ridden, back to Styles, now a retirement residence but where it all began, also sees his death.

I have them all to date, and can't wait for these to be broadcast and then finally made available on DVD.",1364428800,32,1954,4.9815950920245395

His supporting cast, Hugh Fraser, as Captain Hastings (his Doctor Watson) and Phillip Jackson as Inspector Japp ( Lestrade)  along with Paline Moran (Miss Lemon) make for a very entertaining series. What action there is, is basically low keyed and has little if any real violence. The one negative comment I have concerns the length of the episodes. An extra 10-15 minutes of plot and character development would have been a plus. Lastly, the DVD Blu Ray reproductive quality is fantastic.
