309284,5,6301093526,"As the mother of nine month old twins, you can imagine my dilema when my old tape just plain wore out!  I have been working out to this particular video since it first appeared in 1991.  Kathy Smith is fantastic, and this tape in particular is so well put together, it keeps your attention and even after more than a decade, never bores me.  I was so excited to find a used copy today, and ordered it rush delivery!  The pattern of exercises, is so well put together, it works all muscle groups, especially prone problem areas for women.  I cannot stress enough how highly I recommend this video.  Although I love all her other tapes, none compare to this one for me.",1015804800,2,667,4.382113821138211
309285,5,6301093526,This is a great tape.  Works the whole body for 40 minutes.  I have two of her other videos and this one is more hard even though it is an older tape.  Highly recommended,1014768000,,170,3.9411764705882355
309286,5,6301093526,"I have tried many workout videos and I always come back to this one.  It is fairly simple but manages to work the entire body.  After only a couple uses, I can always tell a difference in how my body feels and looks.",1010275200,3,216,4.0
309372,5,6301093526,Kathy is great in this tape when you need cross training from stepping.  I like to use this on alternate days with some additional jogging then use step benching on the other days.  Great workout and easy to understand and follow.  Good for any level and easy to do in limited space or large space.,1311292800,,298,4.381818181818182
309373,5,6301093526,"This is another old workout tape from Kathy Smith, but if you like aerobics, you will like it because it gives a great workout. Kathy gives excellent instruction, along with modification for beginners. It takes close to an hour to complete, too, which is a nice change, because so many workouts are of a shorter duration.",1295913600,,321,4.75
309374,4,6301093526,"Everybody knows that Cathy is the queen, but that doesn't mean that she never comes up short. This workout is too long, and it bypasses ab work. For that she gets one star taken away, but if you got 70 minutes to spare and more time to work your abs, then this is a great workout because it well works your arms, cardio and legs. It's a great way to burn off dinner!",1254700800,,366,4.027397260273973
309375,5,6301093526,Thanks for all the reviews - it helped me to decide to purchase this one.  VERY happy.  Never had heard of Kathy's tapes before.  I'm a low impact exerciser & Kathy REALLY has 2 folks doing the low impact versions next to the other 2 folks doing the high impact.  This one is worth the time & will be used often.,1170288000,,312,4.065573770491803
309376,4,6301093526,"If you can get past the dated outfits and nondescript music of the eighties, you will probably enjoy this workout, no matter what your level. The premise of this workout is that a longer, lighter workout burns more fat than a quick, intense one. So the goal here is to keep your heart rate at the lower end to allow a longer workout, thus more fat-burning. But if you are advanced, there's no reason you can't add more range of motion (or strap on wrist and ankle weights) for more rewarding results; if you're a beginner, just turn the tape off when you've had enough but DON'T forget to cool down a little with a little walking around the house). Enclosed in the video is a ""Fat Burning Nutritional Tips"" booklet, which pretty much advocates high carbs, low fat - she doesn't differentiate between good and bad fats, but she DOES recommend your carbs be the quality kind - whole grains, fresh fruits and veggies, etc.

The 55 minutes are broken down into a warm-up, 6 workout segments, and a cool down/stretch. The six workout segments are interval training: aerobics mixed with some strength and toning exercises. The steps are easy to follow and pretty basic. The toning includes your typical lunges, squats, arm and shoulder work (using your body only for resistance - or pick up a set of weights and really work it), as well as even some back exercises.

If you are a beginner, this video serves as a really good starting point. I consider myself advanced and can make it through the whole thing quite easily, but with a nice sweat, thanks to the extra energy I put into the routine.

This workout is simple enough that most people can catch on during the first time through the video. This fact is enough to bore me after the third or fourth time (I require constant challenge for the most part), so I'm glad I borrowed this from the local library instead of buying it. You can buy this one on ebay for a couple dollars and for that reason, it's a good one to add to your collection, even if you only do it a few times a year, mixed in with your regular workouts. If you're new to the workout world, this could, quite possibly, be the video that you do until the tape breaks or until you decide to move it up a level.

LEVEL: All

EQUIPMENT: None

YEAR: 1988

LENGTH: about an hour",1110585600,11,2288,4.433333333333334
309377,5,6301093526,"This is a 40 minute, mostly low-impact workout.  It is divided into 6 sections.  There are form pointers and modifiers, even basic human anatomy lessons on the names of the muscles worked - such as the quadriceps, latissimus (sp?) dorsi, deltoids, etc.  I like these lessons; I, for one, have heard of the names but don't know where they are located, and after doing this workout, I can finally put a ""face to a name.""  This workout burns fat AND educates you!  There are also two places to check your pulse and two places to check your exertion rate.

This is a super fun workout!  This video was made in 1991 but this did not feel dated at all.  In fact, most of the moves are still done today - such as step taps, repeaters, hamstring curls, and mambo cha cha chas.  The choreography is simple and easy to follow.  She likes to use arm circles.

The moves connect to each other extremely well; moving from one move to another is very smooth.  This is important because moves that don't mesh together make the workout choppy, clumsy, and frustrating to do.  Kathy does a great job of creating combinations that flow from one move to another very well.  One such example: walk 4 steps to the left, followed by 4 repeaters followed by 4 step touches.

Kathy herself is pleasant and mild.  There is no squealing like in her Timesaver Lift Weights to Lose Weight video.  I think her favorite way to cue is to start with ""Take it...,"" whether it's ""take it back,"" ""take it up,"" ""take it from the top,"" etc. because she says that a lot.  She has 6 background exercisers, and except for the occasional and minimal cheering and whooping, they are supportive but not a distraction.

I thoroughly enjoy this workout.  I'm not bored at all and Kathy chooses combinations that are fun to do, hence making this workout very fun.",1103500800,8,1817,4.515337423312883
309378,5,6301093526,This video is awesome.  I feel so energized after I do it and it keeps my energy up for the rest of the day.  I have been doing the video for 2 weeks now and have lost 5 pounds! It really works your behind and hips.,1064275200,2,215,3.652173913043478
309379,4,6301093526,"I have been a fan of Kathy's for about 5 years now and decided to explore other tapes because I was getting tired of the ones that I have, Like Weight Loss Workout, Lift Weights To Lose Weights, Cardio Fat burner, Pregnancy Workout, and Fat Burning Breakthrough. I read the reviews on the Fat Burning Workout from 1988, (which don't bother me)and thought I was gonna have a great workout. Yes, I broke a sweat, but nowhere near as much as I did in the Weight Loss Workout. If your a beginner, this is a great start BEFORE you buy the Weight Loss Workout which is one of the best workouts I ever had, I did that one for about a year. But in this video,I do like the fact that your getting both cardio, and strength at the same time throughout the workout, but a little to easy, ESPECIALLY if you like a lot of cardio. Great workout for beginners, and lazy days.",1058400000,5,860,4.25
309380,5,6301093526,"With this video, you have an effective aerobic session and SIMULTANEOUS muscle group toning, not before, not after, DURING! Kathy says there are three new discoveries here: LOW and SLOW - lower intensity target range keeps you in fat burning state. LONGER TIME - to change shape, the body starts to burn fat as chief fuel. If you exercise beyond 15 minutes, greater percentage of energy comes from fat deposits. And last: MUSCLE TONING - coupled with continuous movement.
This 70 minute 1988 tape is nearly 40 minutes of fat burning, topped off with effective cool down and floor stretch.
The program is well structured and divided into six segments, these usually average 5-6 minutes and when doing the workout, it can seem much longer. Fat burning charts and exertion charts pop up periodically.

Kathy's exercise group consists of about six other students, average, plain looking people, no fluff to distract you. You will see Modifiers, a person who will perform the lower impact version if needed. Also, inserts pop up to show the particular muscle that is working at the time and its proper name.

Music is tolerable. Steps are very easy to follow, and are done without constantly changing, I like that!
Sections One through Six focuses on arm and leg movement working theouter thigh and buttocks, leg work, knee lifts, obliques (waist), biceps, triceps, middle back, hamstring lunges, focus on quadriceps, gluts, inner thigh, hips, efficient cool down and stretch
There are a few select exercise video tapes I prefer and Kathy Smith is one. This is one of the better tapes because it includes Fat burning and muscle toning in the same steps! You get it all done with this tape. Excellent......Rizz.",1024185600,12,1705,4.958041958041958
7809407,5,6301093526,I love this video!  I used to have it years ago and lost it or loaned it out.  Now I am older I can still do the video with the modifying tech she offers instead of jumping around.  Would recommend to anyone that is in good health.,1518912000,,231,3.872340425531915

Lines appear all over the place & it is also blurry. I expected a reasonable quality but this video is NOT!!! Exercising to this video is NOT pleasant.
VERY disappointed & shocked by this Amazon purchase.

7809413,5,6301093526,"I bought this in the 90's to get in shape after my first child.  Using it 4 times a week, I dropped 60lbs!  I just bought this a week ago and can't believe that it still works me as hard as any of the videos being made today.  Nothing fancy, cheesy music, but effective.  Kathy Smith motivates you to keep going and have fun!  I just graduated from nursing school and have 40lbs to drop.  I am confident this will help me get there.  I would highly recommend this video for anyone who wants to lose weight and get fit.",1388880000,2,518,4.12

7809415,5,6301093526,"I have done EVERY workout video know to mankind (it seems like) and this old VHS of my moms is BY FAR the most fun and effective workout video of them all... Its upbeat, Kathy keeps you motivated and interested while working up a good sweat and the stretch at the end is AH-MAZING, unlike a lot of other videos that I have encountered, My 4 year old daughter has a lot of fun doing it with me, just like I did at her age with my mom.  I really wish that they would reproduce it on a DVD because my VHS that has been played literally hundreds of times is really showing its age, 24!,as is my VHS player. If you ever find this a garage sale or in your parents basement pick it up and give it a try you will want to do It again and again.",1362528000,,735,3.9
7809416,5,6301093526,This is a great workout! the VHS was in great shape. I have never had one problem with it. I would tell anyone to buy this workout!,1313884800,,131,3.888888888888889
