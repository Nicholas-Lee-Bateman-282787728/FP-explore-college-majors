2747673,5,B000MTDQPA,"This is a fabulous video, full of information on all aspects of wine, from growing the grapes to fermentation, aging and serving wine. A great review for wine experts, and a fact-packed video for those interested in learning more about wine. If you like what you see in this video, consider picking up a 'wine course' book from your local library.",1196035200,5,347,4.704918032786885
2747674,5,B000MTDQPA,"Actually, I was lucky enough to find this DVD as a rental. I was genuinely impressed with this video. Production
quality was very good, but this video was just amazing in terms of the absolute amount of information given
and the scope of the topics that were covered. Obviously a great deal of thought and planning went into
the production. I was absolutely impressed with the content. I learned a tremendous amount of information
about wines. This DVD doesn't just discuss wines, it discusses grape growing, crops, fermenting, aging, packaging and distribution.
It also discusses the different types of bottles for wines, the different styles of wine glasses, how to open
bottles of wine and champagne. I just can't say enough great things about this DVD. I loved it. My only advice
would be that if you watch it with the genuine interest of getting as much from it as you can, TAKE NOTES!!!
There is so much information that you will not remember everything!! This is an excellent DVD!!!",1188691200,14,989,4.823529411764706

8172013,3,B000MTDQPA,"Pretty poor production.  I actually got sick of Vivaldi's Four Seasons as it was the soundtrack for the whole film (less one section when they were talking about Champagne).  The audio was up and down, and made listening to it more of a challenge.  The info is definitely introduction, so if you know even a little it will be but a review.  (But, the title does say Introductory so I can't fault anyone by myself).  I reviewed as 3 stars (vs 2) for the simple fact that it is a production about wine.....and who doesn't like listening to information about wine (even if it is a review)!  It could have been great.",1484006400,,613,4.428571428571429

8172015,4,B000MTDQPA,This DVD met my expectations: It was a basic introduction to the subject of wine.,1427414400,,81,4.466666666666667
8172016,5,B000MTDQPA,"This is an excellent way to pick up the fundamentals of wine.  I like the systematic way in which the varietals are described (grape types), how the soil and weather affect each type of wine and region and how the labeling is different in parts of the world due to tradition and national laws. Rather than being overwhelmed by the world of wine, the film was presented in a clear way addressing wine and wine terms for the layman.  Even retaining small parts of the information would be so helpful, for example, the labeling differences which so often confound everyday wine lovers and thus keep wine in the world of mystery, even snobbery.  Why should this be so?  Understanding wine means being able to enjoy wine without being intimidated, because, in the last analysis, isn't it about what is truly enjoyed?",1408320000,,811,4.7304964539007095
8172017,4,B000MTDQPA,"Literally--- I have watched this dvd 4 times.  Every single time I have fallen asleep and haven't ever seen the end.  It's kind of hilarious.  It's a great DVD and really goes into a lot of detail about wine, which is awesome.  And sort of confusing which is why I feel like you need to watch it a few times to really grasp/try to grasp the vast world of wines------ if you can stay awake ;)",1370908800,,391,4.105263157894737
8172018,5,B000MTDQPA,"Perfect for the newbie or wine aficionado. Definitely a great watch. Breaks everything down for you. History, health benefits, classic grapes (types of wine). World wine regions, wineries, vineyards & harvest. Also explains the Wine making process. Shows you the correct way of tasting wines, which is actually quite important. It makes a difference in your opinion of the wine I might add. Also, Includes Wine pairings, understanding the labels, buying, serving, storing wine & so much more. Excellent buy or investment, depends on how you look at it :)",1368403200,,554,5.166666666666667
8172019,3,B000MTDQPA,"If you are looking for a good starting place to begin your understanding of wine, this dvd truly delivers as its title advertises: ""An Introductory Guide To Wine.""  This dvd is chock full of information and the absolute beginner such as myself found that I had to view this dvd repeatedly to catch up to most of the information provided.  In other words, this dvd holds up well to repeated viewing as you catch a little more of the vast amount of information that is presented here each time you view this.  I also liked the packaging that resembles a hardcover book.  The problem with this dvd though is that picture and sound quality-wise, it isn't very good and so if you are one of those who absolutely have to have picture and sound quality to do justice to your high-end theatre system then this disc will disappoint.  If, however, your intention for getting this disc is purely educational and you don't mind the sometimes very poor picture and sound quality that crops up from time to time so long as you get a good learning experience then this disc is for you.",1234742400,,1070,4.523316062176166
8172020,5,B000MTDQPA,"I have to say that this was a well planned & informative program. The topics are structurized ideally into core subjects & very relevant to those wanting to learn or know more about wine. Have also found it to be useful & educational when sharing or educating base on the subject. Very brief, good topic choice & a sure good buy. Ideal as an educational program",1213833600,3,361,4.484848484848484
8172021,2,B000MTDQPA,"Fortunately, I watched this as a rental, and I'm glad I did not purchase. I found this DVD to be somewhat annoying, and I'm surprised by the other five star reviews. The content did not seem balanced, most of it focused on wine production, which I was not particularly looking for. The sound quality is just terrible. One speaker in particular, who was discussing wine labels and tasting, would have been very interesting except that the sound and picture quality appeared to be filmed with a 1980's video camera in someone's home with a very bad microphone. Very uneven.

Throughout the whole production, Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"" plays, which becomes tiresome *very* quickly. Many of the segments could have done without music altogether, and this added nothing.

One item that I found odd was a very detailed segment toward the end about champagne and sparkling wines. It was very informative, but seemed more of an add-on and did not really fit with the rest of the program. I only wish that more wine styles had been covered like this, but sparkling wines were the only ones to get this detailed treatment. If you are interested in learning more about sparkling wines, this may be for you.

Might be worth a rent on Netflix for some, but otherwise I wouldn't add it to my collection.",1203897600,7,1287,4.762331838565022
