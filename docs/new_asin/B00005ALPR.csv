7935698,4,B00005ALPR,"This is a review for the WB VHS videotape release of the RKO crime double feature, HUNT THE MAN DOWN (1950) and SMASHING THE RACKETS (1938) a well-matched pair of ""B"" crime films.

In HUNT THE MAN DOWN (1950) directed by George Auchainbaud, a dishwasher shoots down a holdup man and when the dishwasher's picture appears in the local paper it develops that he is really, Richard Kincaid, played by James Anderson,  a 12-year fugitive who was found guilty of the 1938 shooting death of a fellow party goer.
Kincaid almost convinces the  Public Defender, Paul Bennett played by Gig Young, of his innocence but they only have one week to track down the seven witnesses who were guests at that impromptu party 12 years ago.
HUNT THE MAN DOWN is a fast paced, no nonsense small scale noir that is well thought out and directed by veteran George Auchainbaud, a savvy director of almost every type of film.  The cast, although mostly consisting of unknowns, does a creditable job here and I think most viewers will be just as  interested in the outcome of this mystery as I was. A worthwhile, suspenseful noirish mystery, to say the least.

SMASHING THE RACKETS (1936) directed by Lew Landers based on an article by Forrest Davis, screenplay by Lionel Houser. Jim ""Socker"" Conway, played by Chester Morris,  a former boxer is manuevered into a do-nothing political position and frustrated with his situation he finds a method of using his new job into going after slot machine racketeers who've assaulted friends of his. But,as it turns out, Jim's actions put his girlfriend and her sister, girlfriend of a mob lawyer, in danger. This story is supposedly at least partly based on the career of Thomas Dewey, racket busting New York prosecuter, eventual governor and Presidential candidate.

Over all I give this crime double feature Four Stars.",1284595200,3,1837,4.84664536741214
