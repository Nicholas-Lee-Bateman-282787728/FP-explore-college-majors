8668172,5,B00LU4RA1C,"You know, this is why I love indie movies. You can see the blood, sweat, tears, and love that went into this.

I was surprised to find that the sets were pretty good, and the sound was a whole lot better than I've seen in a lot of low-or-no-budget films. There were actual costumes, which is kind of amazing for any production on a shoestring budget. You can tell the producers were actually paying attention to little details.

The story is a bit slow for my taste, but that's just me. The tone moves between indie quirky and ""Little House on the Prairie""-sweet. There are some scary bits, but I think that has everything to do with Mark Adam Goff's unflinching, downright disturbing performance as the female lead's (Marcie Price) abusive dad.

My conclusion is: buy this movie. Support indie films!",1425600000,,801,4.666666666666667
