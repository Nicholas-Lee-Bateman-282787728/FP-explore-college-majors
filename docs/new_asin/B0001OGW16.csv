2022796,5,B0001OGW16,"I really think this movie is hilarious, especially the way all those soldiers are so casually killed (by each other) on their military base in peace times. The runaway tank through the town driven by a crew high on heroin is utterly hilarious as it destroys market places, flattens a Volkswagen Beetle, and plows down a row of gas station pumps and detonates the place killing the crew of a military truck convoy, and the tank crew is confused by the orange flames showing up in their video surveillance screens but otherwise oblivious of the appalling destruction going on and engulfing the tank. All our (anti-)hero sees when he spies the two charred bodies and the military trucks is the opportunity for plunder and they find the trucks filled with about five million dollars worth of weapons which they later trade to a weapons dealer for 30 pounds of opium which they later try to convert to heroin, only to have their entire factory blow up when it is attacked by undercover agents.

I was pleasantly surprised to find a good story, good acting, and a bit of a surprise twist towards the end.  There were some major production/ storyboard/ screenplay errors.  Like when the units go to the field and the whole thing is cut short, it was a surprise, but the execution was forced and it seemed like a story rip-off.  That part of the story/ screenplay cheapened the whole film and left me feeling empty, like something was missing.

2022825,5,B0001OGW16,"I was an Infantryman in the U.S. Army in Germany from 1990-1993. I found this film to be entertaining and for the most part a generally realisitic portrayal of certain aspects of Army life in Germany.

I prefer to look at this film as a composite of Army life in Germany because it illustrates many of the things GIs had to deal with and their reactions to their situation. Most of the types of things depicted could easily have taken place without a commander finding out about them until it was much to late. The only parts I thought were a little too far-fetched were the dead soldier being thrown out the window unnoticed in broad daylight and the final scenes in which the heroin lab is raided. However, the movie touches on some of the reasons why GIs in Germany behaved like some of the characters in the film, particularly a general sense of boredom, easy access to hard drugs and prostitutes, the ability to get away with things and a sense of isolation by being in a foreign country.

Most of the disciplinary actions I know about and misbehavior was driven by boredom. Although a civilian would think that being stationed in Germany would offer a vast variety of interesting cultural and travel opportunities, it is important to know that most of the soldiers I knew didn't ask to be stationed in Germany, the Army just sent them there. Therefore, for many their interaction with the German community was basically limited to drinking beer in local bars and trying to pick up German girls. Few could speak any German and not many took trips to other parts of Europe.

This environment led to pent up frustrations and tensions that manifested themselves in incidents like the ones portrayed in the film, particulalrly in the early 1990's when training budgets were slashed and the Army in Germany lacked a clearly defined mission. It also led to excessive drinking, experimentation with drugs like heroin (which was especially true in Berlin) and hashish, fighting and a tendency toward making mischief like ration card fraud, stealing gear from other units like heaters for armored personnel carriers, or intentionally losing equipment on training operations only to go back later and recover it and sell it on the balck market.

However, in spite of all that, by the time their tours of duty ended and they were being rotated home, most of the troops I knew over there enjoyed their time in Germany and considered it to be one of the better experiences of their lives. It can also be said that most of the soldiers in Germany were professionals and didn't cause any trouble. Army leadership at the time operated on the assumption that a leader would spend 80% of his time correcting the 20% who were causing problems. This movie focuses on that 20%. The U.S. Army in Germany is a special thing and is a unique historical phenomenon and it has played a special and important role in the lives of many of those who served there and many Germans who came into contact with it. Some of them made their fortunes from it.

When looked at from this perspective, the film can be taken at face value. When I watched it the first time, it actually made me wonder if any of the writers or production staff had been stationed in Germany before. If none were, I would be curious to know where they got their material and ideas from.  My assumption is that they either read several years worth of Stars and Stripes reports and got old articles from the German media (which was very vocal about anything they percieved the Army or a soldier had done wrong) relating to incidents involving GIs. The film also has added realism because it was filmed in Germany on actual US Army facilities.",1337472000,,3685,4.661538461538462

2022827,2,B0001OGW16,"BUFFALO SOLDIERS (2001), is of interest to fans of Joaquin Phoenix,
Ed Harris and Scott Glenn, who comprise the star cast of this picture
taking placing in West Germany, before the Cold War ended, as the
Berlin Wall fell. It also is especially entertaining to those having
served in the military.

The story captures well the self-contained world of the military, in
terms of bases, discipline, the constant reminder of belonging to a
group, and the expectations imposed that must be met in terms of
uniformity, and standards that met by all in innumerable aspects of
conduct. The picture shows a few of these: the mess, drills, marches,
deployment exercises, etc. It also brings up the physical and
mental stress of being in a chain of command, where there is no
outsider, per se, who can come to a soldier's rescue, if there is
misconduct, abuse of authority, physical violence, even to one's life
in extreme and rare cases of bullying.

An intriguing suggestion made by the movie, is that the volunteer
nature of enrollment (vs. conscription) has resulted in a lack of
recruited manpower, leading the Army to force convicts to serve, such
that many of these bring their prior shady activities to their new
place of employment. We see drug users and drug labs built on an Army
base, narco-trafficking, as well as black market reselling of Army
commodities. The picture shows the numerous tentacles of those
operations, as perhaps 30 or more are on the take, to look the other
way, or participate actively.

The entertainment goal is met, such as from a few moments of juvenile
humor (a tank runs over a car, gas station), or the mini-romance
with Phoenix and a teenage girl, played by Anna Paquin, but mostly
from thrill and action aspects, culminating in a climax of
explosions, and a fire fight and man-to-man combat.

Some interesting lessons are learned by Phoenix, as he tries to pull
out of his deal, being told by the international arms dealer that he
can't do that, under penalty of losing his life, as up until then he
was small-time, dealing only with commodities, not rifles or grenade
launchers.

The story also underlines how some individuals in the chain of
command (in civilian life, supervisors, bosses, but here, officers,
sergeants) due to lack of oversight can create their own rules, and
get away with it, preparing an ordeal for their rivals in the
organization, such that they are themselves the judge, jury and
executioner, later leaving appearances of either a suicide event or
of an accident of their coworkers.

Overall, this work is entertaining because it intentionally doesn't
take itself too seriously, has a charismatic cast, the required
ingredients for an action film, and a sufficient plot to keep people
interested for 90 mins.",1270166400,,2764,4.907922912205567

2022840,5,B0001OGW16,"Buffalo Soldiers is the story of US Army supply clerk Ray Elwood, played by the handsome and mysterious Joaquin Phoenix.  Elwood is one of those go-to-guys who can score anything you need in exchange for the right favor.  He has his hands all over the supply chain, drives a sweet German sports car, and knows who to cook up a batch of heroin in spare warehouses.  He's a stoic who is well-respected by his peers.  He helps his goofball desk jockey boss (played by Ed Harris) keep the base in West Germany in line.

Elwood's life is thrown into personal and romantic turmoil with the arrival of Sgt. Lee (played by Scott Glenn) and his beautiful daughter (Anna Paquin).  Sgt. Lee has a personal goal of cleaning house and exposing Elwood's dabblings in the black market.  Elwood, of course, decides to antagonize Lee by dating his daughter, and then he falls hard for the young lady.  The movie is a dark game of cat and mouse between Lee and Elwood, with the base commander bumbling around in the background in truly comedic fashion.  With a few healthy plot twists and elements of both satire and horror, Buffalo Soldiers is a movie to catch on DVD for anyone who likes dark drama/comedy in which the viewer ends up rooting for a handsome ""bad guy.""  Fans of this movie should check out Wonderland and Lord of War.",1176940800,,1316,4.561702127659575

2022842,5,B0001OGW16,"This was an interesting film I discovered by chance, overlooking it on the rental shelf, and hearing about it last year through a friend.  Finally I rented it, and now own a copy of it.  Joaquin Phoenix plays private elwood, a young man that chose the army instead of jail. Most of the movie takes place in 1989 germany, just before the berlin wall fell. Elwood has managed to make it through training and is now stationed in one of the supply divisions.  He manages to become in charge of ordering for his company, and ordering he does.  Though paperwork and orderforms, he manages to become a big suppler of goods (cleaners, equipment etc) to many germans as well as the rest of europe, making a few pennies as well. Eventually, he decides to put some other skills he has to use becoming a supplyer of refined heroin, attempting to make one last big profit. Along the way, love is thrown into the mix, and amazingly he falls in love with the worst available option, his commanding officer's daughter, played by ed harris.  this doesn't make the boss happy.  Well, the movie goes from their, and lets just say elwood's life gets complicated, just a bit. The ending is great.  Must watch. you'll be suprised.",1171497600,,1208,4.590697674418605
2022843,4,B0001OGW16,"""Buffalo Soldiers"" is essentially a version of Bill Murray's ""Stripes,"" but only told by a guy who is really, really angry.  It's still funny - even inspired, at times - but it's a humor fueled by rage.  And that rage causes the story to make a couple of missteps.

Set in 1989 (note the perfect use of then-President Bush's plastic grin in several portraits) on an Army base in West Germany, ""Buffalo Soldiers"" informs the viewer that the majority of our fighting soldiers are simply there in order to escape a jail sentence.  As a result, thieves and drug dealers rule the roost - the top MP is a villainous heroin dealer.  The only virtuous soldier is the commanding officer, Colonel Berman (Ed Harris), who is a nice, incompetent buffoon more suited to running a vineyard than a regiment.  (This is a wonderful supporting performance by Harris, by the way.)

Almost every Army movie has a ""scrounger,"" the guy who can get things done in the cracks of the system and usually with a lot of charm.  In ""Buffalo Soldiers,"" that is Private Ray Elwood (Joaquin Phoenix), the company clerk.  We see early on how smooth Elwood is as he simultaneously covers up a drug dealing enterprise while protecting the honor of a soldier who was killed playing tackle football indoors while stoned on about ten different substances - including the Pill.  Elwood is a small-time heroin dealer who sells black market Mop & Glo and drives a Mercedes.  He is one of the princes of the criminal Army.

His little realm gets invaded by ""Topper,"" Sergeant Robert Lee (Scott Glenn, easily the most sinister Sergeant ever).  Lee sizes up Elwood in an instant and brings him down about fifteen pegs - look for an inspired scene involving Lee's bullying of Elwood via ""target practice.""  Lee is unbribable, connected to the general, but also dangerous in that Scott Glenn way.

Elwood also has his little world come apart due to a stoned tank crew on maneuvers.  Intoxication leads to two dead American trucks drivers and two trucks full of unclaimed assault rifles.  Elwood stumbles across the guns and instantly sees an angle.  But he is forced by his connection to take raw narcotics rather than cash as compensation.  Elwood, who makes his money by cooking the drugs into a distributable product, is soon playing a game that he does not control, and the bodies begin to mount up.

This is not one of those movies that gently mocks the Army while honoring it.  There is nothing gentle or honorable in ""Buffalo Soldiers.""  It is funny.  It is dark.  And it pulls no punches.  While not a great satire in the class of ""Thank You for Smoking,"" it is a worthy satire sure to appeal to the wicked sense of humor in all of us.",1166140800,,2697,4.639240506329114
2022844,4,B0001OGW16,"I'm going to write this in the sense that I just know that it was based on real events, and that I watched it simply for entertainment value. [...] I wouldn't be really surprised if worse things really happened in the military in the late '80s, however.

This movie has very grim, yet subtle humor in places, like the drugged-up trio in the tank running over a ""beatle"" and a local German market. I almost felt a tinge of guilt for laughing. What kept me glued to the screen when I saw it on Cable a few years back, was the character of Elwood and the way his moralless self carries himself and the way he handles situations. He seems to have the confidence, knowhow, and ""intelligence"" that the other soldiers lack. Also, I bought this DVD as the story and everything seemed so non-mainstream in spite of it having a good budget with Hollywood stars. Nice mix. You'd never guess it was an Aussie/German flick.

I can't really say that it's perfect. The ending seems rather abrupt after the big climax with the crazy sarge; It'd be more mind-blowing if he really did die afterward, as it would've made the ""falling dream"" seem like a premonition. Ah well, it could've been a lot worse. A few scenes would've also been expanded upon a little more.

I don't recommend it for a date movie, and not if you want to laugh your [...] off. If you want a good drama, don't have a problem with a main protagonist with next to no decency (a plus in my opinion), and like some black humor to boot, you might just enjoy this one.",1163289600,,1516,4.387900355871886
2022845,5,B0001OGW16,"I was in the Army in the same time period and almost the exact same area where this film was portrayed, in a little town called Neu Ulm, Germany.  I can promise you, this film is not over the top and it's not necessarily taking any artistic license.

Not that every soldier was like Elwood and the rest of them.  There were plenty of people who were very strait laced and did their job profesionally.  But there were also plenty of people just like the ones in this film, and all of this stuff and worse did take place in the real US Army in this period.  In fact I knew a guy who was eerily like Joachim Phoenixes character in this movie.  He even looked kind of like him.

I'm sure it's all quite well documented, I know there were plenty of articles in Stars and Stripes and especially in the German media.  Look it up online if you don't believe it.  There were shootings on base, smuggling and theft rings, drug rings.  Horrible racial incidents.  Corruption.  Riots between different Army units.  Just like in the movie there were horrible ""training"" accidents in which numerous G.I.'s were injured and killed.  Routinely.  Thats just a fact of military life.

In reading some of the other reviews, I have to wonder.  Who do you think your military is?  A bunch of saints? A bunch of geniuses?  Middle of the road high school graduates, tasked to do very difficult jobs under very trying circumstances (like staying up for days on end which the DOD seemed to have a fetish for making people do) using Extremely dangerous equipment (like tanks!)

Sometimes these kids rose to the occasion, sometimes they cracked under the strain and / or succumbed to temptation.  It's just human nature.

I found the movie to be a caracature of military life, and I found many of the situations a bit hard to believe, but there is such a thing as artistic license.  Other reviewers have said that there is a ""dark theme"" to the movie, and I agree. HOWEVER, both my wife and I found the movie to be entertaining.  This is not a movie for everybody, but I would recommend it especially for people who were stationed with the U S Army in Europe at any time during the past 30 years.

2022874,3,B0001OGW16,"The name of 'Buffalo Soldiers', historically speaking, originally refers to the all black soldiers during the post-Civil War period (there is a made-for-TV film starring Danny Glover of the same title).  I say this not because I wanted to show my historical knowledge (sorry, I confess, I did).  I say this because I still don't know why the film (or the original book) uses the name?  What's the point?

This is exactly what I was thinking while watching this film.  It is a satire, to be sure.  I can see it when Joaquin Phoenix appears as Elwood, US soldier in Germany just before the Cold War ended, and acts like an anti-hero -- stealing, cooking cocaine, etc.  I don't know whether or not his outrageous deeds are based on truths, but I know such dark comedy films as ""MASH"" and ""Catch 22,"" and you don't need to be offended seeing these things on screen.  Even if the tank runs like mad on the town's market, 'squishing' the cars and stalls; even if Ed Harris's Col. Berman is, good-natured as he is, hopelessly inept as an officer.  Scott Glen's sardonic sergeant Lee (another reference to the Civil War?), according to his daughter Robyn (Anna Paquin), is delighted to 'kill' Elwood, just like he did in the previous war in Vietnam.  And her burnt skin testifies to her words.  All these elements point to one thing only.

Right, if the things went this too far, this film must be a satire. But against what?  The film is about that particular time between the long Cold War and the Gulf War, the curiously 'peaceful' period when nations in the world were keeping the military balance in a precarious way.  But that old time is gone forever, and we should know that now.  It is Miramax who knows it best when it had to delay the release date many times.

However, for all its uniformly good acting, the film looks irrelevant now.  It's about those soliders living at that time and that place.  It's not 'Three Kings' whose setting is more immediate to us.  It's not 'Catch 22' whose absurd situations reminded us of our equally absurd existence.  And of course, the film is not about the soldiers in Iraq (if so, this could never be released).

With all respect to the film and its makers, it is truism, or cliche, to say that 'Buffalo Soldiers' is darkly funny, hilarious attack on the US military system, and so on and on.  The film is not boring, but it ends there, nothing more.  Aussie director Gregor Jordan made 'Ned Kelly' after this, and it also lacked a strong center or theme around which the events should be depicted.  Like 'Ned' 'Buffalo Soliders' is pretty entertaining, and retains a good amount of satrical tone in it, but the target remains very vague throughout the story.",1113868800,,2700,4.588726513569937

2022876,5,B0001OGW16,"I was actually quite surprised by this black comedy.  It's really much more sympathetic and amusing than I expected, though it has its' dark moments too.  I would suggest that those viewing it not take things too seriously and don't go into it thinking this is going to be a documentary about real life in the military--its' not that kind of movie.  As the bonus material indicates, the point of the movie is that it was supposed to take place in 1989, the end of the Cold War, when for a short period it was believed that this was a good thing that was happening and that it might be the end of wars.  (The cynical among us knew better, of course, and can scoff at such misconception now.) The result is that without a real war, some will create their own, out of boredom or whatever.

Anyway, all that said, this movie worked for me.  As usual, actor Joaquin Phoenix takes an unethical, uncaring opportunist and gives the audience permission to like him and root for him, even though he's not a traditional good guy.  His character, Ray Ellwood, has just the right mix of charming wit and inevitable screw up.  This is a character that the audience could have just written off as an idiot and a bad guy without the nuances and layers Phoenix brought (and always brings) to his roles.

2022881,5,B0001OGW16,"Gregor Jordan's ""Buffalo Soldiers"" was simply brilliant and real. Originally to be released in 2001, but postponed after 9/11 this movie presents both satirically and factually the corrupt military in US Army. Sure not all military personel
are like this, but many of them especially going up the higher
rank food chain know how to exploit and abuse their power
which is what the movie shows.

Joaquin Phoenix (in his best performance may be)plays Ray Elwood,
an army guy who gets way over his head when he and his army buddies come across top military missile weapons and then tries
to sell them to his drug dealing friends.

Everything's cool until the corrupt and psychotic Sgt. Lee (Scott Glenn) catches wind of whats going and then sends in his
Army goons to steal Ellwood's stuff, he then proceeds to make
Ellwood's life a living hell while Ellwood is now targeted
for death if he doesnt have the merchandise to sell by his
drug dealing friends.

Ellwood hatches a scheme to tick of Sgt. Lee by investigating
his personal files then dating his daughter who knows all too
well about her maniacal father.

When these two guys collide , sparks will fly and eventually
at the end of the movie you see that military isn't quite, the
skeaky clean, moral image they portray to be in those propaganda ""all you can be"" commercials.

Ed Harris is also great as Col. Berman, a col. whose really
not too smart but who would rather be growing a wine vineyard.

Buffalo Soldiers is definitely worth seeing on all accounts, though some people will call it un-american, even those people
will have a time denying what actually happens inside the
military through this movie.

It seems that guys like Sgt. Lee are very real in the military
and thats what really is scary.",1093219200,,1760,4.694805194805195

2022895,3,B0001OGW16,"Although the opening shot of ""Buffalo Soldiers"" echoes the most famous image from ""Dr Strangelove,"" the real pedigree for this military satire lies in those twin hits from 1970, ""MASH"" and ""Catch-22.""  ""Buffalo Soldiers"" presents us with an army corps composed almost exclusively of drug users, narcotics dealers, bureaucratic bunglers and traffickers in stolen merchandise.  The prime culprit is battalion secretary Ray Elwood, the opportunist supreme who knows all the angles and can make the system work to his own benefit and advantage.  A criminal who was given service in the military over time in prison, Elwood has simply transferred all his illegal activities to the realm of army base life.  One day, however, Elwood meets his match in the form of one Sergeant Lee (the leathery Scott Glenn), a gruff no-nonsense commander, new to this German base, who is on to Elwood's antics and is determined to make life a living hell for him.
""Buffalo Soldiers"" is a gutsy film in that it dares to take on a sacred cow institution and paint it in an unflattering light.  It is also willing to present us with a protagonist who has few, if any, redeeming qualities as a human being (though he does radiate glimmers of decency, at times, albeit not very convincing ones).  These are the film's two strongest virtues, yet they are also, paradoxically, its two greatest weaknesses.  Despite Joaquin Phoenix's superb, energetic performance in the role, Elwood just does not grab the viewer's sympathy in the way that, say, Hawkeye and Yossarrian do in ""MASH"" and ""Catch-22"" respectively.  Those characters could be shrewdly, cynically humorous about the flaws and hypocrisy in the military establishment, yet could still value what was good in the institution itself and the grunts who made up its ranks.  The problem with Elwood is that he is seen far more as the rule rather than the exception in the world scenarists Eric Weiss, Nora Maccoby and writer/director Gregor Jordan have created.  The film, though it obviously has valid points to make, feels so unbalanced in its approach that it ends up weakening its own moral case.  It's true that the other two films took place in a wartime setting and ""Buffalo Soldiers"" is set in peacetime 1989, but it still could use a bit more equity in its portrayal.
All this wouldn't matter so much if the film displayed a finer sense of humor and a firmer grasp of tone, which ranges all the way from dead seriousness to cartoon-like caricature and slapstick.  There are a few deft and witty moments in the film, but they just don't come often enough to lift the comedy too far above the ordinary.
Maybe ""MASH"" and ""Catch-22"" were more acceptable as satires because they weren't targeting just the military but the human propensity for war in general.  With no war operating in its background, ""Buffalo Soldiers"" seems to exist in a sort of satirical vacuum - making it, in the long run, a cynical exercise oddly devoid of relevance and point.",1080950400,,2980,4.877227722772277

Watch this movie and ENJOY, you won't find another like it. It also helps if you've had family in the forces during the eighties. Faulklands...what a waste of time.",1080777600,,609,4.648148148148148
2022897,3,B0001OGW16,"When it comes to books-turned-into-movies, there's an eternal question: Is it better to see the movie before you read the book? Or should you read the book before you see the movie?
  I've always felt that reading a book can spoil a movie for a viewer, yet movies almost never ruin a good book for a reader because, well, there's just more there. And the fact is, the book is almost always better than the movie. With the exception of, maybe, ""The Godfather."" And, so I'm told, ""The Bridges of Madison County."" And ""Carrie."" And most of the James Bond movies. And . . .
  Anyway, all this came to mind because I watched ""Buffalo Soldiers,"" a movie based on Robert O'Connor's novel. Joaquin Phoenix plays Ray Elwood, an Army specialist who's running drugs and black-market goods through his base in West Germany in the late '80s, about the time the Berlin Wall comes down. With the Cold War over, the soldiers grow bored, get slack and start giving in to bad
ideas, such as tackle-football indoors and heroin.
  Meanwhile, like a crooked Ferris Bueller, Elwood scams his commanding officer (Ed Harris), fences anything not nailed down, collides with a no-nonsense sergeant (Scott Glenn) and ill-advisedly falls in love with the sergeant's daughter (Anna Paquin).
  The movie flirts with interesting ideas about peace and war and soldiers and criminals; it's well-made and nicely juggles drama and dark humor; and literally all the casting is perfect. But as a fan of the book, too many times during the movie I found myself buying hard-to-buy scenes (for example, the massive opium refinery Elwood assembles right on the base) because of what I knew from the novel, not from what the movie was telling me. Which made me wonder: Would I have liked the movie more if I didn't know the book? By the time I got to the film's forced ""happy"" ending (which plays out much differently than O'Connor imagined it), I realized that if the movie were better, the book wouldn't matter.",1077840000,,1971,4.7595307917888565
2022898,3,B0001OGW16,"A twisted and amusing satire about the ridiculous war situations, ""Buffalo Soldiers"" is one of the many indie sleepers that should get more recognition.
This is an offbeat war movie, one that wisely avoid the stereotypes and cliches of bland Hollywood pictures like ""Pearl Harbour"" or ""Black Hawk Down"". Here, the perspective is cynical and heavy on dark humour, mixing a bit of drama and action. In fact, its so cynical that there`s no characters to empatise with, so between the bad guys or the terrible ones we have to choose the first group.
Joaquin Phoenix plays a lazy and hypocritical soldier that becomes interested in his bosses` daughter (Anna Paquin), which leads to some contrived situations.
Director Gregor Jordan doesn`t choose sides, as he uses every chance to attack anyone that somehow gets involved in a war process. There are no innocents in ""Buffalo Soldiers"", everyone has their own agenda and betrayal is common here.

Joaquin Phoenix is great as Elwood, the specialist who's scamming left and right while his inept commanding officer played by Ed Harris is completely oblivious to the outrageous events taking place on his watch.  I'd have to agree with one reviewer in that Scott Glenn is a scene-stealer in his portrayal of a sadistic sergeant out to bust Elwood.

As a matter of fact it's hardly even a heist movie at all (even though that's part of it).  It is instead dark, funny, gripping, and more importantly, more original than any movie Ive seen in quite some time.
As soon as the movie began I knew I was in for a treat but by the time the movie reached its climax - complete with drugged up US soldiers battling one another to the death - I knew I was watching something classic. Ive liked everything director Gregor Jordan has layed his hands on (TWO HANDS and NED KELLY, both with Heath Ledger) but this is easily his best work and Joaquin Phoenix (as he did in GLADIATOR and SIGNS) delivers a flawless performance.

2022922,5,B0001OGW16,"In 1989, Ray Elwood (Joaquin Phoenix) is a supply clerk stationed to a U.S. Army base in West Germany who makes money on the side by selling Army requisitions on the black market. His unit gets a new Top Sergeant (Scott Glenn) at the same time Elwood and his partners have an opportunity to sell some arms for enough money to retire on. Sergeant Lee is bent on crushing their operation and Elwood's swagger. The arms sale is complicating their lives. And Elwood has fallen for his enemy's daughter (Anna Paquin).

""Buffalo Soldiers"" is a hilarious black comedy based on the book of the same name by  Robert O'Conner and directed by Gregor Jordan. The film has been widely admonished for presenting an unflattering picture of U.S. military personnel. ""Buffalo Soldiers"" doesn't comment much on officers, except to say that some are blind to what goes on under their noses. The film is about enlisted men stationed to West Germany during the last years of the Cold War ""with nothing to kill except time."" These soldiers are overwhelmingly idiots, sociopaths and junkies. But they sure are funny. I spent the summer of 1983 near a U.S. Army base in West Germany, and I can attest to the strangeness of base life and the feeling that the enlisted men are purposeless. I also had an acquaintance who was stationed to West Germany in the early 1990s. He was a lot like the soldiers in the movie. In fact, of five people I have known who enlisted in the Army or Navy, four resemble characters in this film. So however unflattering ""Buffalo Soldiers"" may be, I am inclined to believe that it is a realistic portrait of base life at a specific time and place. The cast of the film is just wonderful. Joaquin Phoenix and Scott Glenn are perfect in every way. The supporting cast delivers equally impressive and thoroughly enjoyable performances. It's nice to see Ed Harris in a comic role. His talent is not wasted here as Elwood's earnest but naive commanding officer. ""Buffalo Soldiers"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. It has smart darkly comic writing, good construction, and gutsy performances that never fail to entertain. It's one of the most enjoyable films in recent memory. But it's a very dark comedy that dabbles in tragedy as well. And it's unflattering to at least some U.S. military personnel. If that doesn't bother you, don't miss this film! I give ""Buffalo Soldiers""  my highest recommendation.

The DVD: Bonus features include a short ""making of"" documentary, an ""Anatomy of a Scene"" featurette that concentrates on the scenes surrounding Elwood's acquisition of the weapons, and an audio commentary by director Gregor Jordan. The bonus features aren't terribly exciting, but I think the audio commentary is more worth your time than the other stuff. Dubbing is available in French.

2022923,4,B0001OGW16,"BUFFALO SOLDIERS  didn't make it to the theaters for long because of the content and timing.  This is  one of the more anti-military moives out there and watching the inner dark workings of subrosa crime within the military is not what the studios deemed as appropriate when it was due for release around the time of 911.  But now, a couple of years later, when we are hearing the stories of what happens in soldiers' minds when stressed (as in Vietnam, as in Iraq where the suicide rate is increasing) or when bored by the false security of a two year stint of isolation and that boredom encourages subterfuge, then this film noir makes sense, uncomfortably.
Joaquin Phoenix makes the most of his role as the 'undercover agent' who pilfers goods for the black market on the German base of the US Army at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall 1989.  Ed Harris is terrific as the disillusioned officer-on-the-way-up who loses everything, and Scott Glenn is evil personified as the Top Sargent who comes on base and wipes it clean - if dastardly deeds can be termed 'clean'.  Elizabeth McGovern proves she can still vamp, and Anna Paquin is growing into a fine actress.  So even if the story is a bit on the slight side we still have some fine actors to observe.  There are shortcomings here, chief among them is the rather flatline of the speaking and the action.  It is almost as though everyone concerned is zoned out (much like those who are cooking heroin to sell) - and that 'everyone' includes the director and camera crew.  But it is not without its good moments - for a view at home.",1074556800,,1592,4.515679442508711
2022924,3,B0001OGW16,"BUFFALO SOLDIERS is a movie adaptation of Robert O'Connor's popular novel about a group of young U.S. soldiers at the Theodore Roosevelt U.S. Army Base in Stuttgart, West Germany in October 1989. Military clerk Ray Elwood (Joaquin Phoenix) is the mastermind of the operation. Along with his GI pals he deals drugs, steals supplies, and has a thriving black-market business. But his schemes begin to unravel when Sergeant Lee (Scott Glenn) decides to investigate Elwood's activities. And to make matters worse, Elwood pursues Lee's daughter without his permission.
While viewing this DVD I was constantly confused about the intention of this film. Is it a comedy or a drama? Did the directors want their audience to walk away with a serious impression or laugh all the way through to the credits? Unfortunately this film couldn't make up its mind. Some of the scenes contained screwball comedy elements reminiscent of classic military movies such as STRIPS (i.e., stoned soldiers causing havoc by running the tank though the town). Other scenes attempted to portray the heartfelt emotions of the characters (i.e., Ed Harris coming to grips with the end of his military career). But the two polar opposites never successfully united to create a good movie.
I read all the press about this film when it was suppressed shortly after 9/11/01. But now after finally being able to watch it I can't believe that anybody had a problem with it. Clearly this is an instance of being hypersensitive. Why is this film controversial? It's surely not the first film to portray soldiers who don't follow protocol. What's more, it's set during 1989 - 15 years ago.
In short, BUFFALO SOLDIERS simply didn't work for me. There were too many frayed loose ends at the end that detracted from the whole. It is surely unfortunate that wonderful actor abilities such as Ed Harris and Scott Glenn were wasted in this dismal film.",1074297600,,1904,4.971786833855799
2022925,4,B0001OGW16,"Buffalo Soldiers had its first official release in Canada during the Toronto Film Festival on September 8, 2001.  This was days before  9/11 when terrorists flew aircrafts into the World Trade Center and Pentagon.  Miramax held the film back in concern of how some might react to the anti-war message depicted in the film.  Almost a year and half later during the Sundance Film Festival, a woman verbally assaulted the filmmakers by stating that they were anti-American for making the film as she threw a water bottle towards the screen that accidentally hit Anna Paquin.  Having this background information prior seeing the film brings the audience to the story in a completely different light, which builds up a pre-viewing atmosphere full of notions.
Buffalo Soldiers is an interesting story about Specialist Ray Elwood (Joaquin Phoenix) who runs all kinds of scams on his military base in Germany during the final days of the Cold War when the Berlin Wall is about to plunge.  When the new Top Sergeant Lee arrives to his base, there seems to be a new sheriff in town.  Lee also happens to bring his daughter Robyn (Anna Paquin) who falls for Elwood.  This is a recipe for disaster as Elwood discovers that he also has feelings for Robyn, and Robyn's father is out to get him by all means necessary.  Buffalo Soldiers is a comic anti-war drama that is depicted through an atmosphere of boredom among young adults without much life experience and a lot of responsibility.

It's interesting to consider what it must be like for the US military for the number of years between major wars (e.g., between Vietnam and the first Gulf war.) Aside from the minor skirmish here and there, fully trained and fully armed soldiers have a lot of time on their hands, idle hands with unbridled access to weapons and drugs. Surely makes for a funny predicament for a film!
Among the actors, Phoenix has a remarkable way of playing negative characters, and yet making the audience care about his characters (e.g., in Gladiator.) He is at his charming best as the anti-hero. It seems almost that the director did NOT want this to be a comedy, and therein lie the most hilarious moments --  e.g., when Ed Harris plays against as the bumbling Colonel Berman.
Overall, a pretty watchable movie and hence a worthy rental with a pithy topical theme. Just don't expect it to establish any sort of a rooting interest.",1071446400,,1079,4.678947368421053
2022933,3,B0001OGW16,"Buffalo Soldiers is going to be a movie which will unsettle all living patriotic Americans. Any film like this would be hailed as a stroke of genius but then September 11th 2001 halted this movie from it's original release date. As it stands it's a fine movie about the incompetency of the American army and the boredom the soldiers have as they have nothing to do. The only problem is.......do we have any sympathy for the characters at all? I found myself thinking that it was pointless because the characters show nothing to garner any sympathy.....and perhaps that's the point of the film. In that case it's good. But the whole joke about the army generals being inept is one that's very tiring and repetitive. I think the only person in this who gets any sympathy at all is the new soldier who came in thinking that what his father said "" about army guys stick together "" is given a bit of a shock when he gets beaten up really badly. An important lesson for those to say that you shouldn't always believe your own romantic illusions. They tend to be nothing but a figment of your imagination.
As a film, Buffalo Soldiers is an interesting film, but is it really great? The answer is no. The problem with films like these is that will always suffer under films like it and that have been done before. Dr. Strangelove and Apocalypse Now will forever be the masters of the genre. Anything else seems to be tipping their hat towards them. They do have their moments of brilliance but they cover themselves inside a shell that in the end you've got a film that you've thought you've seen before in some other form and what this leaves you with no other option
