4859007,4,B005QKYJGK,"I really love this group.  My wife and I visited Mr. Williams in Tupelo, Ms and were quite impressed with him. We were also present for the making of this DVD and when we received the cd the title threw us because we did not remember hearing a song with those words in it. So when you get to this song (last one)the DVD only has music, like the cd, you do not get to see the group singing this song because it was not recorded during the making of the DVD. We got the music on the cd and really wanted the visual on DVD. Also there were only 3 new songs this time.(and they are awesome!!). We still very much support the Qc's but a little more new music would have been great. After all they put out ""Through the Years"" and ""The  Collection"" recently,which we both love but since we drove to Atlanta just for this event, it would have been nice to hear some new material. We PRAY that GOD will continue to Bless this group in every way and keep Patricks' kids fat (as he said in Atlanta). We will continue to pray for them as always.  Be Blessed!!!",1326326400,7,1048,4.127450980392157
