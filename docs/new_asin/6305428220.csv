1020929,5,6305428220,The faculty is one of the greatest films of all time. It out does scream for plot and originality. I was seriously on the edge of my seat the entire time. Despite being fairly herrific this film still manages to send shivers  down ones spine the gore enhances the film no end and you start to wonder  if this is vying for goriest film ever. Trust me you must see this film.,925344000,,373,4.166666666666667

1021083,5,6305428220,I absolutely love this classic from my child hood! I remember seeing this in theaters when I was in high School lol... Josh Hartnet was the anti hero of that era at the time in every movie he did. Chicks loved him an guys thought he was cool. Usher added extra flavor to the movie & was on top at that time. They don't make movies like these anymore. I really miss all the teen movies from my era 80's & 90's. The Faculty is a must buy especially for this super cheap low blu ray price!!!,1506729600,,488,4.041237113402062

1021847,5,6305428220,"Many people call The faculty a cross between The Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Breakfast Club and they're right. Five of the six main characters exactly parallel the characters of the Hughes film and it is pretty close to a remake of Body Snatchers. Herrington High School in Ohio is a typical small town school of the late 90's with the usual mix of ""in"" and ""out"" students, a fairly loose drug culture and a hometown football team. Casey (Elijah Wood) is one of the ""out"" students, so out he's vulnerable to being bullied. His only salvation is being the photographer for the school paper. Things are already happening beneath the normal surface when he finds what looks to be a strange, worm-like creature on the football field where he eats lunch alone.

He shows it to his science class where the teacher, Mr. Furlong (played by Jon Stewart, a real surprise) puts it in water where it reactivates itself. This begins a series of events that lead to the six disparate students coming together to try to stop the alien enemy using the school as a staging ground for an invasion. It takes off from there and never loses its pace, quickly moving from one scenario to another. The balance between the horror and comedy elements is carefully sustained. Though generally called a horror or sci-fi comedy, the comedy is mostly in its satire and often light mood and not in actual attempts to be funny. The scary and serious elements predominate.

The best thing about the film is its cast. It is probably because director Robert Rodriguez had been making a name for himself with films like El Mariachi, Desperado and From Dusk Until Dawn. Of course many of the younger actors were just starting out. But practically every actor is perfect in their role. Imagine a school with Bebe Neuwirth as the Principal, Salma Hayek as the school nurse and Robert Patrick as the Coach. Piper Laurie makes a rare appearance as the school's drama teacher. The students include Elijah Wood as the geek, Josh Hartnett as the troublemaker, Shawn Hatosy as the earnest jock, Jordana Brewster as the pretty girl clea Duvall as the Goth girl and Laura Harris as a sweet and naive new student from the South.

Just sit back and enjoy this film. I was surprised by how good it was and watched it a second tie. It's almost perfect of its type but has (for me) a trick in the resolution that ties things up a little too neatly. It hurt the film a bit for me but didn't ruin it.",1475020800,3,2458,4.569160997732427

The killer for my are the two glaring plot holes:

First, how did nobody in the hundreds of cast and crew know what a diuretic was?  Seriously, nobody grabbed a medical textbook and timidly raised a hand during production?

Second, If these things want to take over the world, and just need water to multiply... why Ohio?  Had they started in water (the Earth is full of it), they could have been billions strong before starting the infiltration, and the queen would be untouchable.

1022531,4,6305428220,"I streamed this one and I really liked it! The cameos were great and there were lots of famous actors in it who weren't yet famous and I liked seeing them before they got really famous like how famous they are today. The story followed a group of high school students in their high school and it was like when I went to high school but a little different from my old high school since, like, my old high school didn't have monsters or aliens in the high school labs or the high school gym or anywhere else in the high school. Speaking of aliens, this movie is full of aliens and alien references and lots of alien things that I really liked because I like aliens and the idea of aliens and I was really able to get into it even though I've seen lots of other alien movies recently about aliens. POD, Phantoms, Big Ass Spider, Harbinger Down, Blood Glacier, The Thing, The E.T. (short for enterterrestrial), Europa Report, Men in Black, Men in Black II, Men in Black 3, Gremlins, Close Encounters with the Third Kind, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust.

When I think back to my high school days, I remember lots of things about it. The bullies, the jocks, the cheerleaders, the athletes, the footballs, the coaches, the teachers, the principals, the assistant teachers, the substitute teachers, the vice principals, the friends, the girlfriends, the friends' moms, the friends' dads, the friends' cars, the pencils, the books, the notebooks, the note cards, the flash cards, the tests, the grades, the papers, the essays, the student newspapers, the student government, the student dances (these were still called ""proms""), the classrooms, the classes, the showing and telling, the bathrooms, etc. Just the other day, I was talking to one of my best friends from my group of friends when I was in high school and then I was talking to one of my friend's friends, too, about our other mutual friends. It was refreshing to recollect our readings and our rejections and our readjustments and just being ready to react to registering for our reconstituted remedies we recalled as calling ""classes!"" Bill was told me about his new girlfriend since I hadn't talk to him since his divorce from my ex-girlfriend and his girlfriend sounded really pleasant but I don't know if I'd want her to still be my girlfriend today, not least of which because my girlfriend would have a thing or two to say about me getting a new girlfriend, if you catch my drift! My girlfriend wasn't a student at the high school when I was but she was a student at the time a different school before she transferred as a student to my high school after I graduated as a student from it and now she wishes she could be a student again like I wish I could be a student, too! So many great things we remember together. Watching this movie together really pulled us closer together and made us wish we could've gone together to school but instead we were forced to gather our memories of things we do still do together today like see this movie and it was good!

The actors were great acting in this movie and all of the acts were good but the standout act was probably the third act where all of the actors' characters were acting possessed by alien-actors from another planet. I did have to avert my eyes when I saw the nakedness but I didn't have an aversion to any other activity within the archival footage as an acute reminder of just how much I like this movie. I recommend this one but if you have any other ones that you would recommend as a number one movie to watch on a cold night or early in one morning or with someone you think would like watching a movie with instead of watching one by one's lonely self, I'd all up for it!",1453852800,,3703,4.492581602373887

1022535,5,6305428220,Great quality blu-ray.  Looks and sounds as thrilling on the home theater as it did when I saw it in local theaters when it was released back in the late 90's. The film still buzzes with the Williamson vibe present after the Scream franchise struck a nerve with young audiences.  Truly enjoyed how Rodriguez nestled a lovely homage to John Carpenter within the movie.

1022536,4,6305428220,"Taking place in Herrington High School, the faculty are behaving in some bizarre ways. Two students Casey(Elijah Wood) and Delilah(Jordana Brewster) witness an attack on a staff member by two teachers. Convinced that something is going on, the two students along with several of their classmates plan on retaking their school against impossible odds.-summary

I have to come clean and say that I really like this movie, and I do not consider it a guilty pleasure. This is one flick that is always in rotation every October in my home. The reason is simple, it's a very fun film that keeps me entertained from start to finish.

Directed by Robert Rodriguez and released in 1998, The Faculty is a campy sci-fi/horror which borrows elements from classic films Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Thing, and yes, even The Breakfast Club. At its core, the film is your basic save the world tale, but the stellar young cast and quick pace helps the film to be a lot better than what it is. The young cast is definitely among the films highlights. The Faculty was released at a time when the horror market was being heavily saturated with teen cast(or as close as you can get to teens), and it was aimed for that particular audience, hence, the numerous pop culture elements; but this film ended up being one of those rare successes in my book.

I really enjoyed the acting from each of the cast members and there was no true stand out. Now, if we're looking for sex appeal, then I would say that the young female cast was overshadowed by the smoking hot Famke Janssen as the teacher Ms. Burke(sorry Jordana, you're slightly edged out). I mean she was just, oh wow, I would cheat without hesitation. The film also has a good amount of character development. The characters all had very real personalities, and it was nice to see them break their molds eventually. Most films of this style would have overly annoying characters, that you can't wait to see die, but I was actually attached to all of them. From the insecure loner, yet fouled mouth half-way lesbian, to the geek who begs to get beat up. I think there's someone for everyone.

Those whom are coming into this hoping to be scared are better off looking elsewhere. The film doesn't make any attempts at serious horror. Although there's a small amount of gore, I don't believe there's anything that could have one turning their head. The film also has a small bit of female nudity, which is within reason and never over the top since the character is kept in a somewhat dark shade with her side towards the camera. There's also several comedic moments that had me cracking up on certain occasions. The comedy doesn't clash with the overall content because the film never tries to be serious.

The soundtrack is also a plus, which is made up of some of the hottest rock songs both old and new. The songs set the tone of the film with their energetic vibe and fits completely with the setting and characters. I also thought the special effects and monster design was pretty good.

Although very straight-forward, predictable, and even slightly inconsistent, the plot is well paced enough and it stays on course. Once the characters and threat is introduced, it stays above water by revealing one story element after the other. The swift take over of the school is never dragged out, and the film never became boring to me. The film is listed as being 104 minutes but it doesn't feel that long.

Overall, I won't say that The Faculty is a serious favorite. I will admit that my enjoyment has died down over the years, but I would gladly take this unoriginal work over so many original works out there. The Faculty succeeds because it doesn't try very hard in any area. This is just your average entertainment that delivers where it counts. Recommended.

Pros: Fun plot, cast, ample character development, soundtrack

Cons: Too predictable, not the least bit scary, slight inconsistencies",1446422400,,3937,4.710755813953488

1022627,5,6305428220,"Many of the students at Harrington High have always stood firmly by the belief that Principal Drake as well as many of the teachers and staff--particularly the football coach; Coach Willis seem just a bit odd and a few fries short of a happy meal. One evening after a late night conference about the school's budget, Principal Drake is locking up for the night, when she's confronted by Coach Willis who seems more erratic and loonier than usual. Upon having a pencil staked through her hand, Drake makes a run for it only to be oddly slashed to death with a pair of scissors by the school's drama teacher, Mrs. Olsen.

The following day, the film's large main character students are introduced that consist of Casey Connor, a dedicated but bullied photographer for the school newspaper; Delilah Profitt, the snobby and brash editor-in-chief for the paper and cheerleader for the football team; her boyfriend, Stan Rosado, who's on the football team; the smart but lazy and rebellious Zeke Tyler, repeating his senior year who manufactures and distributes a powdery ecstasy-like drug to students in the school; the gullible southern belle, airhead, Marybeth Hutchinson who's transferring from Atlanta, Georgia, and the silent, gothic outcast, Stokely Mitchell who has a liking for sci-fi novels.

While having lunch on the football field one afternoon, Casey finds a tiny, strange creature on the field and takes it to his biology professor, Professor Furlong for investigation. During the examination the creature is determined to be a new species of a cephalopod parasite called a mesozoan. The weird entity is placed in a fishing tank where it grows larger, forming into a crustaceous-like thing. Sooner than later, dozens of weird happenings take place around the school such as shifting behavior changes in many of the teachers and staff; and witnessing Coach Willis attack the school nurse. The students may all be different from each other with not a lot in common, but they all come to agree with each other on one thing: the faculty of Harrington High are being influenced by otherworldly entities.",1437696000,,2107,5.051724137931035

Sort of like an invasion of the body snatchers feel to it. About 7 teenagers ban together to try and figure out what's going on and who's behind the setup.

1022815,3,6305428220,"The Faculty is one of the better products of the late 90s Scream generation, sporting a derivative yet solid sci-fi/horror storyline and a first-rate cast. I initially held off on purchasing the Echo Bridge blu-ray release in hopes that a more reputable company would pick up the slack and put out something a little nicer. Well, unfortunately based on what I've seen and heard, this release (while clearly distributed from Lions Gate) is pretty much identical to the Echo Bridge release down to the picture, sound and green-tinted menus. Granted, this isn't necessarily a horrible thing as the presentation of the film is fairly decent, I just think it could've been done a little better had Lions Gate actually attempted a remaster instead of being cheap and lazy. It would've been nice to get a least one extra or two as well, perhaps a commentary from Robert Rodriguez or even a cheesy vintage featurette. Alas no, not even a trailer, even though the packaging claims there to be one included (an Ultraviolet digital copy is actually included though, in case you're interested). If you're a fan and have yet to purchase a blu-ray version of the film, it's an easy recommendation on the strength that the previous DVD was a poor non-anamorphic presentation, but I wouldn't invest too much cash in it.

1022818,4,6305428220,"This Robert Rodriquez production of what can rightfully be called a modern Sci-fi classic revolving around the theme of aliens taking over the human body and inhabiting the body as host in a diabolical attempt to gain control over human civilization constitutes a homage to Invasion of the Body Snatchers and proves to be a better exposition of the theme which is entertaining, fun and sexy.

The movie revolves around a group of students, one of whom discovers the remnants of an extra biological entity that comes to life upon being placed in a fish tank, coming to the realization that aliens had gained control of their high school teachers and their attempts to uncover the queen alien in a concerted effort to search for an effective method to annihilate the queen so as to vanquish all alien parasites inhabiting their human hosts and to restore life back to normalcy; and introduces two attractive actresses, one assuming the role of heroine (namely, Jordana Brewster) - who will take you breath away, and the other the role of villain/alien (namely, Laura Harris) -who will knock the breath out of you.

1022934,4,6305428220,"With so many terrible horror movies out there, The Faculty surely seems to be a cut above the usual garbage. It's a good little chiller with a better than average cast some who went on to much bigger things. Alien take over at a high school soon turns into a teenage Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but it's quick pace, solid cast and creepy atmosphere keep this film from falling into the usual paint by numbers sic-fi flick.

The Blu Ray is a little inconsistent, looking crystal clear most of the time, but with occasional blurriness here and there.

Okay! Now that I've mentioned that....let me mention my Breakfast Club Referance....The Outcasts of the school end up becoming friends after they start getting attacked by the aliens.......There's Josh Hartnett and Famke Jansen.....and I really liked this pairing...I know SOME people might think it's weird like in a Conner and Cordy way....but he was a misunderstood outcast who Cordelia actually TOOK the time to understand, and they made a nice couple so get over it! Clea Duvall (who also played a very similar character in Buffys Invisible Girl.....And Check it out people, cause just because it's in the 1st Season Doesn't MAKE it invisible......she was REALLY good as Aly Shedes character......but I didn't care for the guy who was playing her Emilio Estevez boyfriend......in fact me, my fiance and all our friends would say Get out of our movie if it wasn't for his last line......which I'll use at the end of this review.....but some people we Do want out.....is Steve from that 70s Show.....and we like him and his joke......but not in this movie So here's a Joke for him.....Hey Steve......does this seem like a movie for you....No.....cause like the next character YOU Are NOT NEEDED!

A whole character wound up on the cutting room floor named Venus. She can briefly be seen in the scene where Mr. Furlong gets bit from the parasite when they put it in the aquarium. I guess they also cut out a lot of Gabes (Usher) scenes. Just look at the TV spots on YouTube and you can see a few of them. IMDB has a great list of all the known scenes that were cut.

1023300,4,6305428220,"This movie came out along with a very similar movie by the title Disturbing Behavior.  This was the far better movie, both commercially and critically.  The Faculty is highly derivative of the 50's ""Red Scare"" movies, particularly Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  It also borrows very heavily--particularly in creature effects--from John Carpenter's The Thing.  Nevertheless, it does so more so as an homage, and it in no way feels cheap or a rip off.  From this standpoint it does rip off Wes Craven's Scream, with characters directly referencing horror movies as a way to understand the problems they are facing in their own movie.  Nonetheless, the movie is great fun and a pretty good horror movie.

The Blu-ray treatment is quite good.  My main complaint is that there is definitely some digital enhancement going on here, particularly with edge enhancement.  It never completely oversteps its bounds, but it is definitely there.  Otherwise the picture looks very strong on all fronts.

All cable and dish companies seem to think it's okay to edit their viewing of all movies by making them fit on todays TVs - 16:9. The most common aspect ratios used today in the presentation of films in movie theaters are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1. When they edit it to fit either 4:3 or 16:9 on a movie produced in 2.39:1 they cut off the left and right sides so that it fits the screen.

1023407,4,6305428220,"Monstrous aliens Body Snatch the faculty of a small Ohio high school in this clique-y high school throwback filled with before-they-were-famous A-listers.

Director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk til Dawn, Planet Terror) delivers a fun horror experience in this clique-y high school throwback.  As if pulled from the Breakfast Club's Saturday detention, we find a motley crew of completely dissimilar backgrounds and values who are forced to work together against their common enemy, forces of evil: their teachers!

The players include the shallow it-girl Delilah (Jordana Brewster; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, Fast Five), the drug-peddling closet intellectual Zeke (Josh Hartnett; 30 Days of Night, Sin City), the bullied quiet kid Casey (Elijah Wood; Maniac), the maybe-lesbian antisocialite Stokely (Clea Duval; Identity, American Horror Strory), the football team captain Stan (Shawn Hatosy) and the southern belle do-gooder Mary Beth (Laura Harris; Dead Like Me, Dead Zone).  Some fellow student cameos include sesident stoner (Danny Masterson) and the token black guy (Usher).

That's one Hell of a cast of before-they-were-huge actors!  When I recently saw this movie again, I found the cast to be as enjoyable as ""the movie.""  It's fun seeing a bunch of star power in a movie you saw years ago without knowing they'd one day be a big deal (or, at least, slightly more famous).  But we've only looked at half the cast.

Facing off against the students, we have the faculty, including the super mousy English teacher (Famke Janssen; Hemlock Grove, Deep Rising, The House on Haunted Hill), football coach and gym class teacher (Robert Patrick; Terminator 2: Judgment Day), biology teacher Dr. Furlong (Jonathan Stewart), Nurse Harper (Salma Hayek; From Dusk til Dawn, Dogma), Principal Drake (Bebe Neuwirth) and some other teacher who played a famous role (Daniel von Bargen; The Silence of the Lambs, Thinner).

After being taken over by alien monsters in this Body Snatchers-Puppet Masters sampler, this high school faculty begins to behave much as the cold, transient high school educators we find today biding their time until moving on to what they think will be more glamorous careers.  Blatant, weird stares, stolid faces and socially awkward over-explanations of simple concepts clarify to the audience who has or hasn't yet been claimed by the alien lifeforms--as if we needed our hands held to understand this.  But, then again...this movie was marketed to high schoolers around the ""no child left behind"" days.  Anyway, this hardly begins to explain the weird behavior of the faculty.

Mr. Furlong and Casey find some alien, aquatic larva which grows rapidly in water and self clones in seconds.  You've gotta' appreciate all of the movie-referencing in the dialogue (e.g., Aliens, The Puppet Masters, Men in Black, Invasion of the Body Snatchers), when our protagonists emulate the ""who's one of them"" test from The Thing and when a teacher's severed head ""crawls"" away--again, we'd like to thank The Thing for that idea.

The violence and blood are ""fun.""  It doesn't match up to the comically overdone slapstick of Drag Me to Hell, Tucker and Dale vs Evil or Evil Dead.  But it's pretty slimy and gross nonetheless.  There's stop-motion, CGI and classic make-up...even rubber monster suits (but mostly CGI).

It's all a good time, but the effects run at a slow pace until the end.  In the meantime this feels a lot like a high school movie with a series of eerie teacher scenes mixed in.  But the last 30 minutes--featuring eye stabbings, aural insemination, tentacle attacks and crawling severed appendages--are well worth the wait if for no other reason than competent and fun special effects surrounding a nostalgic cast including many of today's A-listers.",1376956800,2,3793,5.224422442244224

1023726,4,6305428220,"This movie should have been a total dud, but it's one of the most entertaining teen horror flicks out there in my opinion. Admittedly that's not a genre I watch much of, because they tend towards the predictable slasher type, which isn't my style. But I do enjoy a good monster and/or alien invasion scenario.

The Faculty should have been a dud because there is absolutely nothing original in the plot or characters, and I do mean absolutely nothing. Name any movie with teens or monsters and you'll find elements of them in this one. Yet it works as an entertaining romp anyway.

A humongous part of why it works is due to the casting. They mixed known with up and coming adult actors with some known, some up and coming, and some completely unknown young actors, and all of them did their part to sell the idea that none of the cliches were cliches. I was already familiar with a lot of the cast when it was originally released (which is when I first saw the movie), but quite a few of them are people I only know from later work (like Famke Janssen, Jordana Brewster, and Jon Stewart). That's part of the fun of going back and watching the movie now, as I point and exclaim, ""Oh SHE was in this!""

One of the other reasons it works is because the filmmakers were unabashed in their unoriginality. They didn't resort to cliches while pretending to be doing something new or different. Instead, they wholeheartedly embraced genre conventions and tropes, constantly tipping their hat to those who did it first or best. (In much the way Galaxy Quest did, though they did it even better, and with an at times tongue in cheek aspect that is absent here.)

While on the whole the dialogue is probably the weakest part of the film, there are many lines that will make any SF geek chortle with glee, from discussions of Heinlein's The Puppet Masters to an accusation of ""going all Sigourney Weaver"". In the end that is what pulls it all together. This is a movie made for all of us who have grown up reading about and watching monsters and aliens, and might also have a penchant (perhaps a guilty pleasure one) for teen flicks.",1374278400,,2122,4.503896103896104

The Faculty has an alien invasion story (Invasion of the Body Snatchers is even mentioned in the film), where the aliens take over the bodies of a school faculty and the students. The few students that weren't ""body snatched"" team up and go after the queen. It has many elements of classic SciFi/Horror films; I particularly enjoyed the scene where they have to test who's an alien and who's not, and it plays out a lot like the blood testing scene in The Thing. The actual queen alien/monster isn't seen until the end, but the design was still great; the scene where it swims through the pool at full speed was thrilling. It packs plenty of thrills, a couple of scares, and great acting. As far as my opinion goes, I didn't see any significant flaws in the film.

Overall, it's a fun, time-killing SciFi film that respects the classics. As of 8/6/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.

1024036,5,6305428220,"A seemingly regular and quiet town suddenly gets turned upside down when high school students believe something has taken the place of their teachers and authority figures. Perhaps this could be because everyone starts acting the complete opposite of their usual selves, like how how quiet teacher named Elizabeth Burke (Famke Janssen, ""X-Men"" & ""Taken"") confronts a bullying student in a way that probably most red blooded american males would love.

The opening sequences do set the stage for this eventual take over/possession of the various faculty members and the students have to fight back and find a way to turn back this invasion before they expand outside of their town. For being a typical teen horror flick it does have some funny lines, good punch and decent if not hokey suspense. The alien revealing/attack sequences are good if not silly and ridiculous a lot of the time, but at least fun.

The cast for being back in 1998 features some good talent, like Clea Duvall (""The Grudge""), Jordana Brewster (""The Fast & the Furious""), Josh Hartnett (""30 Days of Night""), Salma Hayek (""From Dusk Til Dawn""), Elijah Wood (The ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy), Robert Patrick (""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"") even Jon Stewart (""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"").

Video:
Dimension = Letterboxed widescreen in 4:3 format, so your widescreen TV will show a small picture with big black bars on all four sides.

No, I did not make a mistake listing the audio details for the Echo Bridge release; it really does have Dolby Digital 5.1 in the menu, but only Dolby Digital 2.0 in the movie.

The only bad part about this Dimension release (and the only reason to consider the Echo Bridge release) is that the video is letterboxed, so a widescreen TV will show the picture with black bars on all four sides.

Teen acceptance, alianation, confusion and the feeling of fear that you won't make it as a adult. This looks better on Blu ray than than standard dvd as  you would expect. however this is not remastered really, alot of canadian only titles are just the same print off dvd put on blu ray. Still the print is a good one here unlike lets say halloween h20 which has dirt and specks all over it. THe other two movies on the halloween triple pack though look great. (another canadian only release) with these canadian ones you at least get them on blu ray but don't expect any work done to the print. This one is only 1080i but it looks pretty good!, This though had a good print thankfully , unlike the canadian only blade 2, final destination 2 and  'a hard days night"". these will all come out on blu ray here eventually, but this one may never do that; so this one is the one to get if you want to buy a canadian ONLY blu ray. I went to amazon canada to get it from them and it came pretty quickly too. This may not be remastered; but it's still better than the dvd version by far. It's close to what I saw in the theater in 1998 yakima, washington state even. the extras are  none though; but at least I got this cool sci fi flick from the 90's finally on blu ray. It's one of my favorite sci fi flicks of that decade. So this was a must have for me. Only a non sci fi fan could give this cool flick a one star rating so ignore those.",1295049600,,1988,4.142487046632124

I don't know any of the actors names right off hand, but there are some very good actors in the movie. The football coach character was in Terminator two and also in the X Files. He was an excellent character in the flick. John Stewart was also quite good in his role as a teacher. The actress who played ""Lilith"" or Frasier Crane's wife on Cheers was quite good. And how could she not be great. She is extremely SEXY. I think she's a powder keg. The spanish actress who was also a teacher, was good in the flick.

The cast of young stars did pretty well as high school students. However, I didn't think the girl who played the alien ""Queen"" brought much to the movie at all. The idea of killing the aliens with some ""skat"" is fairly lame, but I guess it could work. What was that substance anyway, cocaine? Not much really happens in this flick. The best action occurs in the school itself.

The movie is a BLATANT ripoff of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. If this bothers you then you will probably give the movie a low grade. Personally I didn't even think about the Body Snatchers when I saw this flick. Only later did I realize how this movie really did just rehash that same plot.

 With apologies to the tune  ""Ohio"" by the Pretenders

At a High School in Ohio,
All the teaching staff was gone.
They were now hydrostatic ET's
Who had come here from a far.

It started with the Football coach,
But it was hard to tell
He was a whack- job to begin with
For players he made hell.

A. O., a high school in Ohio

But soon he got the Principal,
And all the teachers too
And soon the student body
Were all puppet-mastered too.

All though this movie's hackneyed,
It has some funny jewels,
A gross scene in the shower,
And a hot one (swimming pool)

A. O., a high school in Ohio

The cast are future ""Stellars"",
From acting and music too.
There's Usher though he doesn't sing
And that girl from 902...

Frodo before he got the ring
And that Android from T2
The Commandant from Malcolm,
And Frazier's Lilith  too.

A. O., a high school in Ohio

The funny thing's these aliens
Really weren't all bad
They wanted all to be fulfilled ,
And not to live so sad.

They wanted kids to study harder
And to play harder on the team
And while this isn't Heinlein,
It also isn't ""Scream""

A . O.,  a high school in Ohio

So here's the deal, it is a campy but not overly so version of the Puppet Masters, and not at all bad if you are in the right mood",1211673600,2,1292,4.124497991967871
1024395,4,6305428220,"The 90s were an interesting time for the horror genre; the 90s started off on a down note for horror flicks, while there were plenty of one that were successful it seemed like there were more misses. The days of the franchises were all, but over as they finally ran out of steam and the audience weren't really responding to them as well. The filmmakers who shaped the genre in the 70s and 80s were now falling on tough times. New franchises started and most ended up going direct to video. But than Kevin Williamson came along and bought horror back big time. Like his work or not at one point this guy was the biggest thing in horror and really shook things up. Suddenly well known TV actors were now starring in horror flicks something that was never possible in the 80s and even some well known film stars did horror. While I prefer a cast of unknowns or cult actors, point is Williamson changed a lot in the genre.

The Faculty is the typical horror flick from this point in the 90s; the stylized hey look at us we're so smart and cool era made famous by Kevin Williamson. At this point in his career Kevin Williamson was red hot. All the screenplays he wrote were huge hits and spawned several knock offs and his TV work like Dawson's Creek became the latest teen sensation. I'll confess Kevin Williamson's movies are sort of guilty pleasures. In particular they aren't my kind of horror, but I do enjoy watching his movies again his flicks are my guilty pleasures. He found a formula that worked and rode it out until the end.

The Faculty is a high school version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and there are many references to the Body Snatcher movies and novel as well. I'm a sucker for the Body Snatcher movies I love them all and no many how many remakes come I'll watch them. Most people will cite Scream as Williamson's best work as a writer, but I'm going with The Faculty. All that made Scream so popular is here, but at times it felt a little forced where as The Faculty it doesn't seem so forced. I thought this was well written and with excellent if not clichd characters, which I believe was intentional.

Besides Invasion of the Body Snatchers there is also a homage to The Thing as well. If Scream was his homage to slasher flicks, The Faculty was Williamson's homage to Alien Invasion movies. The characters as stated are clichd, but they work well actually and are all quite likeable. They are well developed and in some ways all add to the plot. Again most people will cite Scream as his best, but I have to go with The Faculty. In a sense all of Williamson's scripts are almost a rewrite of each other. They all follow the same formula, but they were all mostly well written.

Robert Rodriguez is one of my favorite directors and he does an excellent job here. The pacing of the film is very well done. The plot or characters always move forward and honestly there is never really a dull moment. Something is always happening to keep the viewer hooked on the movie. The Faculty does lack the thrills and chills of the Body Snatcher movies, but there is some decent suspense and tension to be found. At this time in horror everything was very Hollywood stylized made for a new crowd and people like me were pretty much left out, but The Faculty is one of the very best from the Williamson era.

The Faculty is a slight letdown is the sense I did expect more from Robert Rodriguez in the thrills and chills department, but that is actually the one real fault in the script. Everything is so hip and cool I suppose that is why it gets lost so for me that is the only flaw in the script. But there is some decent suspense and tension at times and probably better than most of these Hollywood horror flicks at the time, but I did expect more from Robert Rodriguez, but regardless he does do an excellent job at keeping the pace moving and always keeps the movie a lot of fun.

About my only complaint is in the final act when we find out who the main alien is we see him or her out of human form. I don't know for me it just didn't work. The saying sometimes what you don't see is better and in this case I think that's true. For me the alien out of human form just didn't fully work. But it's not something that ruins the movie. The Faculty is still enjoyable, but I would have preferred the alien to stay in human form.

The Faculty is a product of it's time. Every element of 90s horror is here though a lot has changed since this type of flick is a thing of the past now. But despite my problem with the movies of this era, The Faculty is in my opinion one of the better flicks from that time. The casting is solid and all the actors provide solid performances. I actually liked all the characters and found myself rooting for them to survive.

Who knew this would mark the end of the Kevin Williamson era? While it may not have lasted long it did revive the horror genre and start a new trend even if what in spawned was mostly lousy with some exceptions. After this, Williamson would fail at the box office as a writer and producer and his TV shows didn't make it out of their first season. Kind of weird how at one moment he's box office gold and TV ratings gold and the next moment everything is a flop. Overall The Faculty despite being Hollywood stylized is in my opinion a very enjoyable take on Invasion of the Body Snatchers.",1206835200,4,5362,4.333665338645418

1024482,4,6305428220,"When ""The Faculty"" arrived at theaters in late 1998, the world had already seen it's share of over-hyped, over-dramatic and sarcastic teen horror from the mind of Kevin Williamson. Not only did we already have a ""Scream,"" but there was a ""Scream 2,"" as well as a corny ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" followed by a corny sequel with an even cornier title. To add insult to injury, he tainted what could have been an amazing comeback movie, ""Halloween H20"" with his own embarassing self-referential ""touch-ups"" on the script. Most horror fans, including me, placed blame on Williamson for watering down the horror genre, and forcing us to suffer through a five year period of bland horror that was finally put to rest with the flop, ""Valentine."" However, working in Williamson's favor are two things. First, you can't blame him for ""Disturbing Behavior"" or ""Urban Legend,"" as he had nothing to do with them, and second, he did deliver this little underrated gem. Together with director Robert Rodriguez, ""The Faculty"" was brought to the screen in a style that set it aside from it's peers and with a story that, despite lacking in the originality department, didn't feel quite as stale.

Six teenage stereotypes -- a jock, a brain, a pretty girl, a frumpy girl, a burnout, and a naive new kid -- band together when they discover that their school, and eventually their town, are being infested with an alien life-form. The teachers are more cruel and strict than before, and their parents and the police force aren't of much help either. Taking a cue from ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers,"" the parasites in this movie use their human counterparts as a host, taking away what made them human and using their bodies to feed their needs. It's not too long into the film that the kids wise up to this fact. When Josh Hartnett, laying it on a little to thick as the burnout character, stabs his science teacher (played by John Stewart) in the eyeball with a homemade cocaine inside a pen, a plan to hunt down the Queen, which will theoretically save everyone (aside from the few they already wasted) is devised. The movie turns into a whodunnit of sorts, but without resorting to ""Scream""-esque cliches. Rest assured, there are no long-winded explanations as to what their motivations are and how they pulled it off.

One of the biggest flaws in this film would be the last fifteen or so minutes, which really degrades itself to some sort of b-movie monster flick. Needless to say, when the Queen reveals herself, it's a bit embarassing to watch. However, the movie on the whole is thoroughly entertaining. Even when it reaches into moments of cheese, it is still fun, thanks mostly to Rodriguez's expertise. One has to wonder how this guy got stuck directing a teen-horror flick in the first place. A fresh faced Elijah Wood, Jordana Brewster and Clea DuVall are fun to watch in the film, but it is really the Faculty themselves who take center stage. Rodriguez alumni Robert Patrick and Selma Hayek, along with Jon Stewart and Famke Janssen, threaten to steal the show. Their portrayals of overworked, underpaid and underappreciated teachers are spot-on and couldn't be closer to reality. I swear, I've had these people as teachers growing up.

Overall, ""The Faculty"" is an entertaining little sci-fi/horror that you'll probably want to watch more than once. Sure, it's become a bit dated eight years later, but of all the movies of it's kind popping up at the time, I'd have to say this is the best. The DVD is horribly disappointing, however, with no special features really to speak of. Hopefully one day they'll put out a special edition, with some commentary and some insight into the making of the film.",1168387200,4,3708,4.790625
1024483,4,6305428220,"Scream-play scribe Kevin Williamson's formulaic yet satisfying suspense thriller, ""The Faculty"" borrows from a buffet of tried and true storylines: Williamson fills his plate with plots from ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" tasty twists from his own ""Scream"" series, and still leaves room for heaping helpings of ""The Breakfast Club,"" to boot.

Indeed, Williamson was no doubt the John Hughes of the 90's, his finger firmly on the (sometimes slashed) pulse of teenaged America.  Recognizing a can't miss recipe when he sees one - in this case the old ""take a teen from each disillusioned demographic then unite them in a common cause"" trick - and adding a sci-fi spin to his already patented brand of knowingly ironic self-reference, Williamson cooks up a stylistic stew with something for everyone, even though some flavors could have used a bit more seasoning.

Elijah Wood leads the aforementioned ragtag bunch of scholastic standbys (you know 'em, you love 'em:  the jock, the cheerleader, the geek, the Ally Sheedy outsider, the genius underachiever, the new girl, etc.) in a somewhat queasy quest to save their Ohio high school from an alien takeover.

Williamson's wink wink self-aware gimmicks work well in this setting, for he can once again mask his thematic thievery by having his own characters discuss his crimes: ""Well how bad can stealing be if I'm admitting it?"" asks the new Zeitgeist of Teen Angst. And so the somewhat-Sheedy outsider is a huge science fiction fan, thus she speaks eloquently of Heinlein's ""The Puppet Masters"" and the original ""Body Snatchers"" stories, saving us the trouble of calling Kevin on his references.  Neat!

And cliched lines can't be spoken without acknowledging their triteness first.  But today's trick question is - if every new sardonic screenplay calls itself out on every cliche, then doesn't that just replace the old cliches with new ones?  Of course, some lines work on and of their own merits - as when one of the teens accuses Wood of impersonating the hero(ine) from another popular series of alien films.

But I digress.  The real reason that all of this works so well is the person who's stirring the stolen stew - in this case erstwhile indie maestro Robert Rodriguez, of ""El Mariachi"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" fame - adds enough spice with his deft direction as to make this picture quite palatable indeed.  It's the little moments that most directors ignore or treat as filler that Rodriguez has fun with - especially in his slo-mo depictions of disjointedness.  Watch as the librarian spookily brandishes a ""QUIET PLEASE"" sign as two of the teen rebellion talk strategy;  laugh as you catch a glimpse of eager-beaver students in a classroom with hands raised, signalling certain disturbances in the force.

The gore is fun and ""Blade""-like, with foamy death sequences that leaves seemingly  carbonated corpses - another cola tie in, perhaps? - and fairly decent computerized and animatronic effects of dismembered body parts seeking to reconnect.  And, as in the original body snatcher movies, Rodriguez does a great job conveying the palpable paranoia of not knowing whether your best friends and confidantes are still on your side.

Of course, that's where this entire movie works best, on the level of saccharine allegory - because, not only as teenagers but in at later stages of life, haven't we all worried about and experienced the hurt of allies switching sides and friends defecting to join our detractors?  Well, this movie treats those back-stabbers with a healthy dose of eye-gouging in return, which can be quite therapeutic. What teen won't thrill at the sight of student stabbing teacher at face value?  And, in the end, haven't we ever stopped to consider that the word ""alien"" can also mean ""outsider""?  So, in a way, aren't we all just aliens trying to get by?  Awwww - time for a group hug!",1167436800,,3877,4.987577639751553

Well, as the film so adeptly points out, ""Would you come in all Independence Day or just slip in through the back door?"" Get a toe hold and then, boom, world domination.

The only thing standing in these aliens way? A sterotypical 'we-wouldn't-be-friends-otherwise' group of students that are here to save the day.

1024486,4,6305428220,"""The Faculty"" is one of those movies where you want to reduce it to simple cinematic equation history, such as ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" meets ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" But that is really too simplistic an approach. Not since ""The Rock"" have I seen a film that references as many other films as ""The Faculty"" (comedy homages in the tradition of ""Airplane"" do not count). When you watch this film see how many times you suddenly say to yourself, ""Oh, yeah, just like in 'The Thing.'"" Clearly, screenwriter Kevin Williamson (""Scream"") is back to his old tricks, this time in the field of science fiction rather than teenage splatter flicks, aided and abetted by director Robert Rodriuez (""From Dusk Till Dawn"").

The premise of the film is that the old school kid fantasy about teachers being alien monsters comes true at Herrington High in Ohio. The faculty are only first on the alien agenda for possession. Next are the police, the students, their parents, the folks in town, the visiting football team, and, by the end of the month, the entire world. All that stand in the way are the fellowship of the high school student stereotypes: there is Casey Connor (Elijah Wood), the Stephen King nerd; Delilah Profitt (Jordana Brewster), the campus queen; Stokely Mitchell (Clea DuVall), the goth girl with the encyclopedic knowledge of science fiction films whom everyone thinks is a lesbian; Stan Rosado (Shawn Hatosy), the sensitive jock who wants to be more than a quarterback; Marybeth Louise Hutchinson (Laura Harris), the new girl in school; and Zeke Wells (Josh Hartnett), the big man on campus when it comes to drugs.

Actually, ""The Faculty"" ends ups being one of the most subversive films in history because the big lesson here is that mind altering drugs can save the world (that just cannot be right, people). But it is hard to focus on a ""message"" in a film like this where the only real question is how are these kids going to save the world and which on the infected people is hosting the queen? That last one is where Williamson proves he was paying attention to story construction because there are plenty of clues that set up the big payoff, which is usually a sign of competency when considering a film like this. Otherwise the big joke in the film is that the adults are having a lot more fun being monsters than the kids are trying to save the earth. Robert Patrick plays Coach Willis with maniacal glee while Piper Laurie goes for underplayed creepiness. Famke Janssen goes from mouse to lioness, Bebe Neuwirth gets to work on her chilling smile, and even Jon Stewart has his eye-popping moment. Only Salma Hayek is really wasted, given nothing more to do than blow her nose.

The end result is a decent science fiction horror film, which is a pretty good deal. We are clearly in a world where a competent film in this genre qualifies as an above average effort. But ""The Faculty"" embraces both the history of the genre and the stereotypical characters running around in it trying to save the world. The idea of an unpretentious exploitation film just sounds strange. For me, the two scenes that capture the essence of this film are the suspenseful sequence where the gang tries to figure out who amongst them cannot be trusted and the bit where the new and improved football team gleefully beats up on their out of town opponents at the big game on Friday night. ""The Faculty"" plays well in both ballparks. The only serious complaint is that this film was apparently so well crafted by Williamson and Rodriguez that there are no deleted scenes; all this DVD offers in the way of extras is the trailer. That is a downer.

Bonus Question: Since this film is scripted by Kevin Williamson can it be read as an allegorical twist on ""Dawson's Creek""? Sure, why not? It just gets a bit complicated, because if Casey is Dawson and Zeke is Pacey, then Stan has to be Jack (the football part, but not the gay part, unless you want to go back to the very beginning in which case he can be Cliff). That means Delilah is Joey (but with Abby's attitude), but then we have to decide if Marybeth the new girl in town or Stokely the girl with a bad reputation is Jen. Since that can work out either way your decision can be based on whether you are trying to work this out in terms of the high school years on ""Dawson's Creek"" with Andie or the college years with Audrey.",1138838400,4,4387,4.613316261203585

1024619,3,6305428220,"The Faculty pokes fun at itself - and that's admirable. They aren't trying to make a movie like Scream; rather, they are trying to make a serious movie, but my guess is that they know they won't succeed as much as they would like to. Here's my point. Early in the film, Casey (Elijah Wood) and Stokely (Clea DuVall) are discussing Casey's beliefs that aliens are overrunning the school. Before I go any further, why jump at aliens first? There are many possibilities for what seem to be odd possessions...one that pops to mind is demonic. Anyway, Casey shares his belief with Stokely (whose character oddly pretends to be a lesbian so that people will stay away from her), and she doesn't really buy into his theory. During their discussion, they discuss The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Stokely says that the movie was simply a poorly done remake/stolen version of Robert Heinlen's Puppet Master's (I believe). In essence what the filmmakers are saying here is that their own movie is a pale imitation of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which is itself a pale imitation of something else.

That may mean that they knew they weren't making an A+ movie and tossed those lines in so that they could say, ""Hey...I wasn't being completely serious, look!""

Then again, it may just be me.

One reviewer said that with Scream and I Know What You Did..."", teen horror films are becoming common. That's ridiculous. Freddy and Jason movies are teen oriented, and there were perhaps seventeen films between the two of them. Those are just the ""big"" ones. There are plenty of smaller films looking for a teenage audience (such as the Scarecrow, which is terrible, and I don't recommend that to anyone).

Anyway...

The movie is typical for the genre, and while the main characters are cookie-cutter stereotypes, the filmmakers do make an attempt to turn some of these around. The captain of the football team decides he wants to be normal, and Casey (lesbian in hiding) is secretly in love with him (completely against her character, btw - that just didn't make any sense), and ends up being a nice little girl in a skirt and sweater by the end of the film. So they reverse two stereotypes and create another.

Josh Hartnet's character, Zeke, is as unbelievable as their solution to kill the monsters. He's repeating senior year because he pretends to know nothing (so we think he's the typical grunger), but he's actually just short of being a genius. He makes something akin to crystal meth in a lab at home (that, luckily, doesn't explode like the real ones when it's being torn apart), and lo and behold, the ""meth"" is what kills the aliens. The movie is asking us to suspend disbelief (almost impossibly done) on that.

Most ""teen"" horror films - most horror films, for that matter - have a guy and a girl fighting the big bad beastie together at the end, but this one didn't. While the ending was hardly unconventional, it was good enough to get a ""star"".

Watching this was guilty pleasure for me. I was home sick, flipping through Comcast's On Demand, and found The Faculty. There were, certainly, more intelligent films to watch, but I chose this.

It's difficult to review a movie by its merits when you like it even though you know shouldn't. The merits of this movie are few. Perhaps the cast made it enjoyable. This was Josh Hartnet's third film, but his first that was relatively high profile. For Elijah Wood, it was a transition film - he was making the move from a remarkably successful and quite good child actor to adult actor (at 24, we can safely call him an adult, even if he's barely taller than a hobbit <wink>). It's always interesting to watch that transition, especially when it's successful.

Salma Hayek, of course, was nominated for an Oscor in 2002 for her supporting role in Friday. Usher - well, we all know what happened with Usher.

There are more interesting notes regarding the cast (Bebe Newith, of Lilith fame, is there), but I'm tired and don't feel like tracking all of them down. <grin>

So...final thoughts...guilty pleasure, not an original movie by any means, good acting. Tough call.",1138147200,2,4128,4.718055555555556
1024620,4,6305428220,"While ""The Faculty"" isn't the greatest horror flick out there, it is worthy of a few viewings.  I must admit that four stars is probably more than this film deserves, but I can't help but enjoy this movie.  The story, retread as it may be, is fun and played out wittingly by a cast full of up-and-coming stars at the time that will eventually have solid careers.  Also, the actual faculty is played by established actors and actresses who you will recognize and perhaps be shocked by their appearance in the film.

The plot has been around the block a few times, mixing stereotypical teenage characters with a stereotypical teaching staff that starts to act just a wee bit strange.  As time goes on, people start to go missing or are transformed into zombie-like drones.  The small band of heroes, with stellar performances from Clea DuVall and Elijah Wood, must join forces to find the queen of an alien race trying to--you guessed it--take over the world.  Other young stars in this flick include Jordana Brewster, Josh Hartnett, and Shawn Hatosy.  Usher Raymond makes a small appearance as well.  The highlight of the young cast, though, is Laura Harris, who plays her character very well.

The faculty is chock full of mainstream actors, from Robert Patrick(Terminator 2) to Bebe Neuwirth(Cheers, Frasier).  John Stewart turns in a memorable performance as the science teacher and I was shocked to see Salma Hayek as the funny school nurse.  Famke Janssen goes from shy to svelte as an extra-terrestrial, and Piper Laurie gives a motherly, if not-of-this-worldly performance.

This film is just fun to watch.  I can't complain about that.  It laughs at itself as well as sci-fi horror as a whole, all the while giving you a story full of solid acting and a little suspense.  It's a well done flick worthy of repeat performances.",1136592000,2,1832,4.823717948717949

With the success of ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" it's become common to see teen horror films. Mix that in with a Kevin Williamson (who wrote both of these remarkably fresh late 1990's slasher yarns) script, and you have a film aimed at the teen market, but the first thing to come to mind, is that the whole teen horror market has become watered down. ""The Faculty"" may entertain the demographic for which was created for, but others will find this ""The Breakfast Club""-on-acid science-fiction romp to be utterly humorous more than it is atmospheric or entertaining.  ""The Faculty"" may remind many of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (A similarity acted on by some of the movies young heroes), in that the aliens use human bodies as a host. After the teachers become infested by the creatures, the faculty tries to take over the student population. A few students get away, and begin to try to figure out what's going on. Using the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" plot, they determine that there is probably one leader alien, and if that one is killed the human hosts will return to normal. That's what they hope will happen. They develop a type of weapon that they believe will battle each alien, but throughout the film they find it harder and harder to trust each other, unsure of who really isn't possessed by the small worm like aliens.

The principal, Ms. Drake (a funny Bebe Neuwirth), is ""converted"" by the football coach (Robert Patrick), who is in cahoots with the drama teacher, Mrs. Olson (Piper Laurie). The body snatching is accomplished by some creepy-crawly organisms that enter the host organism through the ear. No cumbersome pods to worry about. Our hero turns out to be the nerdy Casey (Elijah Wood), pure bully-bait, who is brutalized by just about everyone on campus except the sickly sweet Marybeth. She's a transfer student from down south with a mint julep accent. Casey's eventual allies are punky Stokely, campus queen/cheerleader/school-paper editor Delilah, star quarterback Stan and flunky drug dealer Zeke, who just happens to be a closet rocket scientist. In the beginning, it's kids versus adults, but then the aliens start looking for younger blood. It's disappointing that ""The Faculty"" degenerates into a routine game of alien hide-and-seek, with a familiar special effects display as back up. The fertile themes of peer pressure and teen alienation are swept away with the appearance of drooling monsters, Sigourney Weaver-rejects. Director Robert Rodriquez, who burst upon the Hollywood scene with the energetic ""El Mariachi"", provides some pep, as does the likable cast.

It's fun to watch, even typically, most of the teenagers, are played by 'kids' in their twenties, and Josh Hartnett as the worst hair ever!

The best actors in this are definitely the lovely Shawn Hatosy & Clea Duvall, although I dunno what to make of Clea's hair - is it greasy, or as she overdone it with the gel? Love the eyeliner too!

During the cast pictures at the end, the science teacher who was 'killed' in the film is shown very much alive with a patch over his eyes and bandages over his fingers. The female teacher who was decapitated only to have her alien-controlled head rejoin her body, is seen (also very much alive) wearing a scarf
around her neck, presumably to hide the scar.

Near the end of the movie, Marybeth refuses to take the alien drug test by saying she's allergic. Jordana Brewster's character Delilah says, ""Yeah, and I'm Portuguese."" In real life, Brewster can speak fluent Portuguese.

Jon Stewart plays Prof. Edward Furlong in this movie. Actor Edward Furlong played John Connor in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, chased by the T-1000 Terminator played by Robert Patrick (Coach Joe Willis).

A small town school that rests on the merits of its football team becomes the target of an alien invasion.  Symbiotic aliens (mistakenly called parasites) take control of members of the school faculty.  From there they move on to assimilating the student body and the local authorities.  Soon it seems as if the whole town has been taken over except a small group of students.

While trying to maintain their own identity, the students realize that if they do not act offensively the invasion will quickly spread across the state and then the world. Their only hope lies in stopping the invasion now.

The story, while not completely original, comes right out and says it is a tribute to Heinlein's The Puppet Masters.  But this is not just a remake.  An extra dimension is added.  It could be possible that the public is the target of a huge conspiracy aimed at making them more accepting of the idea of aliens and extraterrestrial life.

I say that because sitting through this precocious rehash of ""Puppet Masters"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" (along with a little bit of ""The Thing"") is an absolute breeze. Though not without its share of suspense-dread and red-herring scares, the movie ably demonstrates the social symptoms of overall teenage distrust through a handful of characters that should be one-note yet inject a uniquely disparate perspective of the goings-on. Those goings-on are too familiar to us by now: a parasitic alien infects leagues of human hosts with the simplicity of an airborn virus and essentially renders individuals into becoming somewhat 'optimal' zombies. Alright, if aliens chose to overpower the Earth through brain manipulation, why choose Ohio to start? Because... who the hell ever thinks about Ohio, the same ill-fated state as ""Heathers""? Where this movie excels is Williamson taking the pop culture UFO phenomenon (through movies and literature) and ingesting it with the posit that, instead of attempting to be secret leaks about such subject matter, they are actually devised to divert our attention away from the seriousness of it when it actually does happen. (Much the same way Williamson approaches his post-mod horror projects.) Drawn from legitimate personal experience, though dismissed as pulp fare or daydream fantasy by anyone else. Yeah, sure, it's ludicrous, yet the possibility is undeniably intriguing. So Rodriguez comes in and smoothly milks this angle, and aptly, I might add. I always think his better films are those he does not write himself (but that still won't stop him from being the cameraman, re-recording mixer, co-producer, editor and director on this movie) and ""The Faculty"" is a case in point. His hyperbolic style fits right in with this type of writing, and Williamson delivers his slickest dialogue yet (see review title). One more thing (and let me know if I'm crazy, here): this has got to be one of the most violent high schools depicted on film, and of course it's only violent while the students are still human. (Although, Stokely does endure some harsh blows during the aliens' siege.) I understand it ain't gonna make the AFI 100, nor be regarded as seminal viewing by 'Cahiers du Cinema.' But it's dependable. Whether you want some laughs, some scares, some mental repairs, this is one that you won't have to feel guilty about reaching for.

The plot is that aliens have landed and are taking over the school, this group of outsiders are the last ones left and have to stop it before it gets out of control. Yet, the twist is that one of the group IS the alien, but who? I good film and I enjoyed it",1071100800,3,831,4.167701863354037

1024890,3,6305428220,"Similiar in premise to Mark L. Lester's CLASS OF 1999 with an obvious ode to INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, screenwriter Kevin Williamson joins forces with director Robert Rodriguez for a fast-moving ""aliens take over our school"" popcorn flick. With a director known best for Mexican gun battle movies and a writer known for wise-cracking parodies of slasher flicks, a movie about aliens taking over high school classrooms would not seem like an obvious choice.
A group of high school students led by super-senior Hartnett (in his debut role) are shocked to discover that their teachers are actually alien invaders. It's up to dweeby Elijah Wood, snobby Jordana Brewster, and a handful of jocks and outcasts to stop them. As it turns out, the beings that live inside their hosts have a fatal reaction to the ingredients in the class drug dealer's stash. Using the contraband as their weapon, the group heads to the high school where the teachers are ready and waiting.
While it does provide some tense moments, this movie seems to play it safe a little too often. Rather than sacrifice its more popular characters, it always seems to stick them in escapable situations and pander to what the audience would like to see happen with them. The kids, who are on a ""Breakfast Club"" tip very rarely seem to be in any authentic danger. This seems more like a kiddie-version of Heinlan's ""Puppet Masters"" than a real serious sci-fi thriller. For all its faults, at the very least, this film has fun with its cast which includes Robert Patrick, Jon Stewart, Famke Jannsen, Usher Raymond, Duane Martin, and a dressed-down Salma Hayek. Hartnett, in particular, has very rarely been as good. Williamson's always-overwritten characters aren't quite as obnoxious as they were in his ""Scream"" scripts though subsquently, Rodriguez's style feels just a little toned down. What many had assumed to be his trademark Mexican stand-off style mentality of directing is not quite the case here. He's moving in a different direction and while I am a fan of his other style, it is good to see him try something different. The collaborative efforts of both seem to combine for an entertaining if somewhat predictable and harmless new take on an old story.",1061424000,2,2231,4.9361702127659575

I'm a person who enjoy's a good horror movie were it dosen't show so much violence, and leaves your mind up to what hapened. In this film you see way too much.

1024894,4,6305428220,"A pleasantly enjoyable alien invasion movie which pits the wits of a rapidly-shrinking group of high schoolers against a rapidly-growing group of water-loving alien monsters.
Plot-wise, there's not much new: 'Something's not quite right at school' is the theme that takes up most of the film, with the usual disbelieved teenagers trying to warn their parents of the danger amongst them.
Certain parts of the film are full of holes; the courageous tactic used by the kids to dispose of the aliens seems slightly ridiculous and the usual character mold of the over-sexed, dentally perfect, highschool students being pursued by something evil, puts the film in Clich Land.
However, 'The Faculty' works well through convincing special effects, one or two surprises and the intrigue of not knowing who is human and who is alien. Reminiscent of several better films, such as 'The Thing', it fails in atmospherics but makes up its losses with a very impressive twist near the end.
Look out for a young Josh Hartnett who went on to star in 'Pearl Harbor' and an even younger Elijah Wood, who was to become internationally famous as Frodo Baggins in 'The Lord of The Rings'.
Overall, 'The Faculty' is very watchable; not destined for the Horror Hall of Fame but something which could easily make it to your video shelf, to be watched again and again.

1024973,4,6305428220,"""The Faculty"" is one of those movies where you want to reduce it to simple cinematic equation history, such as ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" meets ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" But that is really too simplistic an approach. Not since ""The Rock"" have I seen a film that references as many other films as ""The Faculty"" (comedy homages in the tradition of ""Airplane"" do not count). When you watch this film see how many times you suddenly say to yourself, ""Oh, yeah, just like in 'The Thing.'"" Clearly, screenwriter Kevin Williamson (""Scream"") is back to his old tricks, this time in the field of science fiction rather than teenage splatter flicks, aided and abetted by director Robert Rodriuez (""From Dusk Till Dawn"").
The premise of the film is that the old school kid fantasy about teachers being alien monsters comes true at Herrington High in Ohio. The faculty are only first on the alien agenda for possession. Next are the police, the students, their parents, the folks in town, the visiting football team, and, by the end of the month, the entire world. All that stand in the way are the fellowship of the high school student stereotypes: there is Casey Connor (Elijah Wood), the Stephen King nerd; Delilah Profitt (Jordana Brewster), the campus queen; Stokely Mitchell (Clea DuVall), the goth girl with the encyclopedic knowledge of science fiction films whom everyone thinks is a lesbian; Stan Rosado (Shawn Hatosy), the sensitive jock who wants to be more than a quarterback; Marybeth Louise Hutchinson (Laura Harris), the new girl in school; and Zeke Wells (Josh Hartnett), the big man on campus when it comes to drugs.
Actually, ""The Faculty"" ends ups being one of the most subversive films in history because the big lesson here is that mind altering drugs can save the world (that can't be right). But it is hard to focus on a ""message"" in a film like this where the only real question is how are these kids going to save the world and which on the infected people is hosting the queen? That last one is where Williamson proves he was paying attention to story construction because there are plenty of clues that set up the big payoff, which is usually a sign of competency when considering a film like this. Otherwise the big joke in the film is that the adults are having a lot more fun being monsters than the kids are trying to save the earth. Robert Patrick plays Coach Willis with maniacal glee while Piper Laurie goes for underplayed creepiness. Famke Janssen goes from mouse to lioness, Bebe Neuwirth gets to work on her chilling smile, and even Jon Stewart has his eye-popping moment. Only Salma Hayek is really wasted, given nothing more to do than blow her nose.
The end result is a decent science fiction horror film, which is a pretty good deal. We are clearly in a world where a competent film in this genre qualifies as an above average effort. But ""The Faculty"" embraces both the history of the genre and the stereotypical characters running around in it trying to save the world. The idea of an unpretentious exploitation film just sounds strange. For me, the two scenes that capture the essence of this film are the suspenseful sequence where the gang tries to figure out who amongst them cannot be trusted and the bit where the new and improved football team gleefully beats up on their out of town opponents at the big game on Friday night. ""The Faculty"" plays well in both ballparks. The only serious complaint is that this film was apparently so well crafted by Williamson and Rodriguez that there are no deleted scenes; all this DVD offers in the way of extras is the trailer. That is a downer.
Bonus Question: Since this film is scripted by Kevin Williamson can it be read as an allegorical twist on ""Dawson's Creek""? Sure, why not? It just gets a bit complicated, because if Casey is Dawson and Zeke is Pacey, then Stan has to be Jack (the football part, but not the gay part, unless you want to go back to the very beginning in which case he can be Cliff). That means Delilah is Joey (but with Abby's attitude), but then we have to decide if Marybeth the new girl in town or Stokely the girl with a bad reputation is Jen. Since that can work out either way your decision can be based on whether you are trying to work this out in terms of the high school years on ""Dawson's Creek"" with Andie or the college years with Audrey.",1050364800,3,4369,4.609756097560975

1024975,5,6305428220,"During a time when the cinematic bowels of horror ruptured and teen movies seemed to flood the market and become a dime a dozen, I opted to skip this film because of some very bad experiences that still didn't set very well with me. Like many of the people I knew, there were lingering doubts plaguing me as to whether a mainstreamed cast of this nature could actually approach the terrible in a convincing way and if a theme that echoed ""aliens kidnapped my baby while at high school"" could actually find a way to be new and diverse. After a time, however, I opted to buy it on an impulse, liking something I had seen about the making of the beast that all the trouble stems from in this tale. After countless rewatches, I have to say that this isn't what I first stereotyped it to be and, although it isn't original, is very appealing.
We begin in the confines of our little Ohio-based school system, introduced to the living representations of all our modern stereotypes of what students can be. From there we see the basic interactions and the bullying - the drug-use and subsequent salesmanship, and the athletics - as our gaze is focused through one ""geek"" (Elijah Woods). Thinking his life is difficult enough already, he finds himself shocked when, looking around on the football field, he discovers the dehydrated remains of what appears to be a new species. Odder still, is its ability to come to life when introduced to water. This leads down even more bizarre pathways for him, and he finds himself and this band of miscreants we spent time watching early becoming stars when thrust into the gears of what seems to be an alien invasion.
While the script was nothing new, the actors more made up for this by providing seamless performances that were sometimes dry and sometimes surprisingly funny. On top of this, the effects on this were, in a word, delightful, giving the watcher something to keep an eye out for. From the beast with rows of teeth that would make any dentist smile and sing songs of happiness to the aquarium-based lifeforms, the DVD version of this had a quality that was simply superb. Add all of this together and you get one thing; a movie that is enjoyably delectable.",1041984000,26,2203,4.622448979591836
1024976,1,6305428220,This movie is a sad joke.  The boom microphone droops into the view of the camera constantly.  What weak wimp did they have holding it up there?

It's not for tots: there is a lot of violence in first fifteen minutes of the film, and the kids ""test"" one another (to make sure they're not aliens) by snorting home-made powder.  But it's all done with tongue-in-cheek. I was especially pleased with the performance of Elijah Wood as the school ""target"", Casey, who spends the first half of the movie getting beat up, and the second half of the movie kicking alien butt.  ""Casey, when did you become Sigourney Weaver,"" one of his classmates asks... Hah!  It's fun.",1030924800,2,751,5.040322580645161
1024978,4,6305428220,"I didn't expect much from ""The Faculty,"" despite liking Robert Rodriguez's work. I was happily surprised to see, if not a perfect movie, quite a good one peeking out amongst the forest of such teen horror drek as ""Dangerous Minds."" The plot is fairly basic: The teachers at an Ohio high school have been replaced by aliens (or have they?) as the first part of a plan to take over first town and then the world.
Not surprisingly, given Kevin Williamson's screenwriting duties, the script is highly self-conscious, and almost immediately, characters in this alien invasion film begin comparing events to ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and Robert Heinlein's ""The Puppet Masters."" (They then make a few leaps in logic that, while perhaps necessary for the plot, seem a little silly and it's disappointing to see that their assumptions are pretty much spot on.)
Unfortunately, Williamson's normally good work with teen characters -- although they may be highly stylized, you can't say his ""Dawson's Creek"" teens aren't at least interesting -- gets a little too broad here. We have Zeke, the super-genius drug pusher who's stayed back a year in school, a number of rather cypher-like other teens (including the coolest girl in school ... the editor of the school paper? Huh?), although one at least is supposed to be a cypher.
While the teen stars of the film somewhat disappoint, given the degree to which they were underwritten, the titular faculty of the high school in the movie is a hoot, with a good number of marquee stars almost unrecognizable as high school teachers. Salma Hayek is anything but glamorous as the school nurse, as is Famke Janssen, who spends most of the film looking like anything but a bombshell. Jon Stewart is a convincingly scruffy high school science teacher and the obligatory ""cool teacher"" every school seems to have. And Bebe Neuwirth, perhaps typecast because of her role as Lilith on ""Cheers,"" plays it cool as the school's principal. The actors are clearly having fun as the teachers-turned-alien invaders, and it's a pleasure to watch them wind the film to its inevitable conclusion.
That conclusion, incidentally, isn't quite so inevitable as it might seem, with a few well-done last minute twists and turns, although the big confrontation with the boss alien falls into the same trap as Stephen King did with ""It"" -- was it really necessary after a story full of effective small scares to go with a big boogeyman of a monster? Likewise, the denouement is a little hard to believe, and beneath both Williamson and Rodriguez.
But those are minor quibbles. Overall, ""The Faculty"" is a fun, and surprisingly well-made space invaders movie, and a treat to watch.
A strongly endorsed rental pick for fans of the writer or director of for fans of old science fiction horror films.",1026086400,,2810,4.930379746835443
1024979,5,6305428220,"OK, let's start by getting the bad out of the way. The plot of the Faculty is one of the oldest chestnuts in science fiction - the ""aliens are taking over the town by stealing people's bodies"" schtick. And at several points the script descends into unbelievability - not the suspended disbelief of a good science fiction movie, but the ""where the heck did that come from?"" disbelief that can often take you right out of the swing of the movie.
Now the good - and there's considerably more of this than of the bad. The script is well-written and witty, and handles the problems mentioned above in stride. As you might expect from a movie written by Kevin Williamson, there's plenty of genre-referential humor and often dry wit. The acting is uniformly good, including several well-known stars (Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett, Robert Patrick, and Famke Janssen). Some of the lesser-known actors, especially the teen ones, also shined - Clea Duvall as outsider Stokely, Jordana Brewster as popular girl Delilah, and Laura Harris (who at first I thought was Kirsten Dunst) as southern belle Marybeth. The special effects, while still obviously B-movie, are good enough that they don't detract from the film.
The film adeptly uses the motif of an alien invasion as a metaphor for life in high school - for example, the aliens offer the six main teens (the only ones still human in the town) the chance to truly ""fit in"" by giving up their individuality. By fighting back, the teens confirm their individuality. This device has been used often by Joss Whedon (another noted teen-scribe) in his TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer; fans of that show will probably want to see this film, if for no other reason than Clea ""Invisible Girl Marcie"" Duvall's starring role.
While the movie suffers from many of your typical sci-fi B movie cliches, the writing and acting deftly overcomes those handicaps and is a stylishly funny combination of sci-fi B movie and teen movie that fans of both genres will enjoy.",1020556800,3,1990,4.821637426900585

1025121,3,6305428220,"The Faculty is another attempt to cash in on Teenage America's on again, off again love affair with horror movies. The temptation to make them is strong because their budgets are relatively low, mainly because they rarely need to employ one or two expensive stars for marquee value. Parents may well remember seeing Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street, both of which came out around 1980, but almost none of them remember who starred in them. It is somewhat different now because so many actors in these movies are successful players on TV series or soap operas, but they are still young and inexpensive.
The Faculty is a modestly imaginative entry, even though it admits it owes much of its story to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The story is basic. Students at an Ohio high school have always been alienated from their teachers, but this year the teachers really are aliens. A parasite from someplace has taken over their bodies.
The lead players are the usual stereotypes. There is Casey [Elijah Wood], the nerdy smart kid. Jordana Brewster plays Delilah, the school's beautiful Queen of Mean. Stan, the Jock, is played by Shawn Hatosey. Then we have Zeke the Rebel [Josh Harnett], Stokely the Outcast [Clea DuVall] and Marybeth the Good Girl [Laura Harris]. The teachers and parents are also straight out of the Stereotype's Handbook. They range from mildly neurotic to dangerously psychotic, and this is before the aliens get them.
What saves the movie are the directing style of Robert Rodriguez, who elicits strong performances from the cast, and the fairly intelligent dialog. Everything is propelled by the type of humor that is best appreciated by people under the age of 21. While the horror is predictable, it fits the satirical nature of the picture. In one scene, one character says to another, ""Don't you ever just want to be yourself? I know I do."" She then transforms into a hideous monster. Similar scenes are too risque to describe here.
Another plus is that the young cast is full of actors who are a cut above those usually found in such fare. I expect to see a lot more of them, especially Josh Harnett, Clea DuVall, Laura Harris and Elijah Wood, who has proved his talent in a number of other movies. Of the older actors, it was great to see Piper Laurie, though she deserves better material. Miss Laurie made her first movie when she was eighteen.

1025123,4,6305428220,"This teen horror is scripted by Kevin 'Scream' Williamson, and it shows.  This movie is full to the brim with knowing nods and winks to sci-fi and horror that true fans of the genre will appreciate.  The plot is basic enough, group of teens battle against their teachers and peers as they gradually become a set of mute, apparently perfect clones.  Yet this version of 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers' is both original and clever in that it pits its kids not only against the clones but against each other as the slowly-decreasing inner group is riven by suspicion and paranoia.  'The Faculty' also manages to allude to 'The Breakfast Club' with the group of teens basically being a geek (Wood), a prom queen, a jock, a goth and the new girl.  This witty device manages to increase the tension, which is edged up very effectively and old set pieces such as the almost obligatory 'chase through the school corridors' scene is fresh and exciting.
Rodriguez has also managed to assemble a smart young cast, many of who are now rapidly rising in the industry.  Wood proves that he is more than able to carry a movie with his likeably geeky hero whilst Hartnett (giving evidence of his later stellar performance in 'The Virgin Suicides') and Duvall (last seen in TV's 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' as the invisible girl, as well as indie flick 'But I'm A Cheerleader') give able support.
Some of the central ideas are also very clever, such as that the government planned conspiracy thrillers such as 'Men In Black' in order to cover up the real conspiracy.

1025269,2,6305428220,"This movie doesn't really deserve to be seen.  It trades on the popular interest in aliens of any kind, combined with the always-ready backdrop of a high school environment, with the underdog yet genius school kids pulling the trump card against their teachers.  The storyline is very weak, with little external development, which lends to the movie an 'empty' air that is not filled by any amount of attempted drama in the lighting or soundtrack.
Watching 'The Faculty' is a strange experience, neither remotely frightening nor absorbing, the cast flit through their roles rapidly and do not entice the viewer into the action.  As a take-off of 'The Terminator' or 'Alien' it is faulted and unconvincing, and fails dreadfully in any way to hold water as a serious movie of any kind.  The only people who could justifiably watch this would be sold-out aficionados of Elijah Wood, of which I am sure there are many.  His performance, such as it can be given the material he has to work with, is excellent, as is that of the rest of the younger cast (particularly DuVall and Hartnett), but if Mr Wood or Mr Hartnett don't up your heart-o-meter whenever you see them on screen, then don't give this movie any of your valuable time.",1010361600,,1228,4.746478873239437

1025274,2,6305428220,"Let's start off by saying that it was a nice, fresh twist to have a teen horror film that wasn't a slasher film. I prefer the slasher ones, but this will do. Kevin Williamson from ""Scream"" and Robert Rodriguez from ""Desperado"" and ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" team up for this sci-fi/horror teen film about a bunch of high schoolers who find out that the faculty at their school have been overtaken from some outer space parasite. The one thing this film has going for it is the cast. We get a lot of great seasoned performers : Piper Laurie, Robert Patrick, Salma Hayek, Jon Stewart, Bebe Neuwirth, Famke Jenssen, and Christopher MacDonald. The kids are all good. Jordana Brewster is an instant eye catcher. Very beautiful girl. There is nothing new here, but the sharp direction and choreography, as well as the solid cast make it decent enough.

1025275,4,6305428220,"THE FACULTY is one of those ""teen-scream"" films that are just meant to provide cheap thrills, and this movie definitely fills the bill. The basic plot concerns alien parasites who take over the faculty of a small Ohio high school and soon practically rule the entire town. Only an odd and small collection of popular and outcast students can save the day. Josh Hartnett as ""2nd year in a row"" senior Zeke and Elijah Wood as put-upon Casey lead this gallant crew and turn in fine performances. However, it is the talented cast in the faculty roles that really shine. Robert Patrick is appropriately strange as the football coach, while Selma Hayak is amusing as the school nurse nursing a VERY bad cold. While her role is relatively small, Piper Laurie does a chilling turn as the possessed drama coach. Famke Janssen shines as the meek English teacher, who becomes a sex-pot under the alien influence. Bebe Neuwirth (Lillith of CHEERS and FRASIER fame)adds her strong screen presence to the role of school principal. The movie goes at a good clip and keeps the suspense and thrills coming. Overall, this is a fun flick, which I recommend.",999129600,4,1138,4.781725888324873

It was under Jordana Brewster. When I heard it was a horror movie that made me like it even more because I love horrors. If you want a movie to keep you entertained and to keep you awake I recommend this movie. It's a scary and funny movie. I loved it and I hope you will too!

It has a great mixture of comedy while keeping the suspense theme strong.  With actors Josh Hartnett playing the troubled bad boy and Elijah Wood playing the nerd/geek it made the movie even better.

I saw this film on Cable TV and I have to say that it is very excellent. It's about a modern-day group of high school students who find out their teachers are aliens and the aliens are trying to take over the world, basically by turning everybody else into aliens. The teens have to find the Queen Alien and destroy her so all the other aliens will be destroyed and everyone will be human again. The ending will be pretty surprising, because the person who everybody thinks is the Queen Alien actually turns out not to be the Queen Alien.
THE FALCULTY has an all-star cast of young talented actors and actresses. All of the performences from the entire cast is absolutely serperb, and the script is well-written and solid. The special effects aren't all that bad, either. The Queen Alien looks extremely frightening. The stand-out actors in this film are Jordana Brewster (Delilah), Josh Hartnett (Zeke), Usher Raymond (Gabe), Laura Harris (Marybeth), and Elijah Wood (Casey).
THE FALCULTY is one of those modern-day fables because in the beginning, everything in the small town appears to be normal, and then strange things start happening: All the people in town start disappearing and turning into aliens.
This is a fun, very good film. It may not be Oscar material but heck! Not all movies can be worthy enough of winning any Oscars and that doesn't make them bad, either. So if you love horror, then go try THE FALCULTY. I can guarentee you'll love it!",990662400,4,1598,4.710714285714285

Right on track from the outset, with a first-rate cast, good sense of humour and some very memorable scenes.  Unfortunately, the third act veers away from being a brilliant horror-mystery-thriller-whodunnit and unimaginatively reverts to an Aliens-type action finale.  A shame, because it undermines the rest of the film a little, but it's still an excellent movie, much better than you might expect.  It's just a shame about the complete lack of extras on the disc (although the picture and sound quality are excellent).",986342400,2,758,5.398305084745763

This movie takes an old but well loved theme and formula and brings it into modern day High school hallways.  It successfully brings back the theme of 'who can you trust?'...something that will *always* be with us.
Of course this movie also leans on that age old joke ""I think my teacher is an alien"".  Yes, this is a ridiculous thought but it's all meant to be taken lightly.  It's just a movie people, let's all lighten up.  I bet none of us ever expected a movie to incorporate this old joke in a smart way, huh?

I have to admit that the cast is awesome and they are capable of being great actors. But it doesn't seem like there is really a good story that builds up or something. It's just like: Whoa! Guess what? Our teachers are aliens. And then after that there's plenty of action...it's just no good.

I have seen it far too many times and this is just one from the bunch.
You'll see nothing that wasn't carbon copied from other movies of this type. For example, the high school kids who begin to suspect that their teachers really are from distant places team up to try and stop them.

All I want is a director's cut with all the deleted footage that was featured in the ads for the movie. Usher didn't get taken over until much later in the movie.,984614400,,443,4.162790697674419

This film pays homage to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and the lesser known but excellent Puppet Masters (the movie is great, rent it asap).

They uncover a conspiracy by the aliens to invade the Earth after witnessing the brutal invasion of the school nurse via her ear. This movie doesn't require an ounce of thought really because it is a popcorn movie. Kevin Williamson as usual, lays it on pretty thick with references to other movies.

As a scary suspense thriller it's an insulting joke, one that will make you wish you had bought 'The Thing' instead. As an ironic parody of 50's 'body snatcher' films it doesn't work either - there isn't actually any irony, and the end result is that of a dull, low-budget film that would have gone directly to video without passing go if it were not for the involvement of Kevin Williamson. A year from now we will all wonder how Williamson could have had such a hold over the filmgoing public, given that his one good idea ('Scream') has been stretched to breaking-point, and that he is unable to do anything else effectively. Half-way through watching this at the cinema some drunk people walked in, shouted 'this is a stupid film' and walked out again. The DVD doesn't even have any extra bits, not that it would make the film worth any more. Interesting cast, though - Salma Hayek appears for a split-second, Robert Patrick draws a parallel between the average P.E. teacher and the T-1000, and Elijah Wood plays a geeky hero, something you don't get in most films.",969580800,,1142,4.602941176470588

Well, that's definitely NOT me. Despite priding myself on  usually disliking most of the ""JUNK"" Hollywood churns out, after  seeing the FACULTY, & looking into the depths of my soul, I must admit,  begrudgingly, it is a rather entertaining movie!
Fast-paced and shrewdly  pressing all the audience's buttons, in the right order, it does exactly  what its producers want it to: Take you on a Cinematic ride!
Still, I'd  like to issue TWO BRIEF WARNINGS:
IF YOU'RE A SALMA HAYEK FAN.....DON'T  BLINK!  (You just might miss her altogether!) T.O.S.T. = About 4 or 5  minutes!

1025518,3,6305428220,"Imagine you're back in the 1950s and watching one of the many teenage horror flicks of that day.  You know the kind -- a monster comes to down  (always a small town), a small group of teenagers figure out what is  happening, but whenever they turn to the adult world for help, the monsters  have gotten there first and changed the adults into monsters.  Our teenage  heroes are scared and don't know what to do when they begin to suspect each  other of being a monster!  Yet if they don't rise above these impossible  odds and chase the monsters back into outer space, the monsters will take  over the town tomorrow and the next day they will take over the planet.  Okay, you're in the 1950s and watching these movies, and you wonder  ""What will these movies be like in the year 2000?""  THE FACULTY  is your answer.  First, you'll find that the plot hasn't changed one iota.  Second, you'll notice how the teenagers themselves have changed from Archie  and Veronica goody-goodies into punk cocaine-sniffers who use language that  was simply not allowed and not heard in the 1950s.  Third, you'll notice  that the teenage heroes, underneath, have the same hearts of gold and the  same sense of social altruism that they had in the movies of the 1950s.  But the biggest change of all is the fourth one: the special effects.  In  the 50s, you could laugh at the seams that were showing when the monster  hunched forward, or the little toy-constructed towns that they stomped on.  But in THE FACULTY you see monsters that have been spawned from computer  animators, who wiggle and jerk and suck you up into their insect-like  mouths.  You see people turn into monsters before your very eyes.  (When we  first saw this in the old WOLF MAN movie of the 1940s, we were frightened;  now we see the same thing routinely in movies and on tv, and in fact, if  we're watching a horror flick, we simply expect someone's face when shown  in close-up to start to transform itself into the ugly  and menacing face  of a monster.) So, 40 years of Hollywood progress has brought us special  effects that are truly fantastic.  THE FACULTY uses the usual special  effects; nothing much new here, we've seen it all in the past few years.  But the special effects are used to good effect.  The screenplay isn't up  to the standard of the same writer's THE SCREAM, but it's better than his  two sequels of THE SCREAM.  Leonard Maltin says one thing that is  absolutely insightful: THE FACULTY is too long.  At 117 minutes, it drags.  But the drags are due to simply lingering on to a scene too long.  A  judicious cutting of a minute here, two minutes there, 30 seconds somewhere  else, and the movie could have made ten times the money it made.  I'd say  105 minutes would have done the job nicely.  The editor, perhaps prompted  by the director, simply tried to milk too much out of the scenes. They  should have hired the editor of MAGNOLIA and given him a free hand with THE  FACULTY.  Too bad--you spend so much money on a film, and then hurt it  badly in the editing room.  Bottom line: a quite enjoyable movie, better  seen at home on DVD than in a theatre because you don't want talkers in the  theatre to distract you while you watch this one.",966556800,,3229,4.511304347826087

Well, I rented it, and it turns out  they were wrong about this movie, but not in the way that I thought they  would be wrong.  The Faculty is much worse than the way I heard it  described.  In fact, it is an abomination.  It is truly awful, and ranks  (or shall I say ""reeks"") as one of the worst movies I have ever  seen.  If you take out the swearing, this film is basically kiddie-horror.  The story is like one of those Goosebumps books that ten year olds read.  It is basically just your run-of-the-mill class nerd becomes big hero  movie.  It reminded me of a made-for-television movie, like one of those  ABC after school specials.  The fact that they make reference to Invasion  of the Body Snatchers in this pitiful movie is utterly ridiculous since it  is nowhere near being in the same league as that great sci-fi classic.

A drug dealing teen is the hero of the whole ordeal.(Dumb Idea! ) A cocaine like drug becomes a test for people infected by alien  organisms.(Dumb Idea! ) The clincher for me is the sweet blonde haired  girl from Atlanta, Georgia who starts out as just your average new girl in  town. In the end she gets naked(Great idea! ) and then gets ugly(turns  into hideous, menacing alien creature.(Scary!  No! ) This movie certainly  has some ""original"" ideas and definitely gives viewers a whole  new outlook of southern women(just kidding) and it is an incredibly wierd  sci-fi horror flick but its originality is not for the better. I find the  attempts at scaring the bejesus out of its audience in a high school  atmosphere to just be different and sometimes(and in this case) being  original is just being different(not better). The only redeeming quality  for this flick would be to watch this movie for its comedic value.  ""The Faculty"" is almost classic in the so bad that it's good  genre. It has ""Your not going to believe this one"" stamped all  over it.

1025805,4,6305428220,"I saw The Faculty on Showtime last week, and I thought it was a very good movie.  I especially liked the way the movie made sense after you see the ending.  The moviemakers made sure there was a reason each of the main  characters was spared from being infected by the alien.  For example, it  turns out it was lucky the quaterback had his run-in with the coach at the  end of practice.  It made QB sympathetic to the alien.
  I was a  little disappointed in the ending of the film after the alien was killed.  None of the characters seemed to recoginze that the alien had played a  vital role in improving a very dysfunctional school environment for them.  I know dream sequences at the end of horror movies are cheesy, but I think  this time that type of scene could have been put to good use.  Maybe  Stokley or the character played by Josh Hartnett could have had a dream  experience that dealt with the dual aspect of the alien.  To sum up, I just  think the alien was right about a lot the things it said while chasing  Elijah Wood around the lockerroom and it would have been nice if one of the  characters in the aftermath could have recognized this.",953510400,,1158,4.317757009345795

Besides having teens  playing the roles of teens. Unlike ""scream"" for instance. I found  the meshing of different cliques to be refreshing and new. The story line  of teens fighting aliens trying to take over the planet may not be new. But  I think this movie puts a new and creative spin on it, without making it  too dramatic.

I was so happy with  this movie, it was great. Any high school student has thought at one time  or another, that there teachers, parents, friends, were aliens, so this is  a film that most can relate to. I personally really liked the mixing of  ""cliques"", and the fresh-budding relationship between Stan and  Stokely (horrid name), he is a cute quaterback, and she is an outsider, but  there is great chemistry between the two. It's also good to see actors  portraying teens, who actually look as though they are still in high  school. The way they go about destroying the alien race, is humorous, and  it is always good to have suspense, and the occasional commic-reliefs. This  movie has it all, and if you get scared easily, do not worry, you won't be  closing your eyes to much.

1025809,1,6305428220,"Robert Rodriguez is an enormously talented director, but I'm still wondering why on Earth he wanted to make this stupid teen horror film about aliens taking over a high school.
He probably thought that he could make  it better with his own personal style and, while I commend him for trying,  this movie is a half an inch from being completely  unwatchable.
Rodriguez's directing, usually so involved and in-yer-face  in his previous films, seems pedestrian in this movie. It's almost as if he  knew how bad the material that he was working with was.
The lousy and  unoriginal special effects speak for themselves: they are laughable and  embarrassing to watch. Not only did this movie lack creativity, but it also  lacked originality.
The only plus that I can give this movie is that,  unlike other teen movies, the actors that portray teenagers in this movie  actually seem like real teenagers.
I can't even recommend the film on  that basis. Avoid this movie and see Rodriguez's ""El Mariachi""  which, for a film with a not-so-new story idea, was a fresh and innovative  movie that offered something new.",952128000,2,1106,4.881720430107527

However if your into these kind of  teen horror flicks, then you'll probably enjoy it a little bit more.

This  movie is rated R because of violence, graphic language, and brief nudity  (you see someones butt).  I love this movie.. rent it you won't be  disapointed!",932774400,,799,4.607142857142857

(the only thing I hate is when I tell people this is my favorite movie and they say ""oh what's it about?"" and I say that aliens are taking over a school.  it sounds so  dumb!)  Clea DuVall (Stokely) RULES!  She is my favorite character.  She is  such a good actress, she does such a good job of being the bi**hy outcast.  BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!",931132800,,373,4.083333333333333

1026395,5,6305428220,"I rented this flick expecting nothing more than a stupid, SCREAM-like ""horror"" movie...well, I was wrong. Yes, it does have all the teeny-bopper stars in it....but the movie admits the ""borrowed""  storylines of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the like by referencing  them a few times throughout the film, which I liked.
While this Kevin  Williamson era of ""horror"" we are in right now is annoying me,  THE FACULTY is a movie that stands on its own. This film has you saying  ""Oh...****"" quite often, and the plot, premise and movie as a  whole is just downright entertaining.
I rather liked the cast, and  Rodriguez's directing is awesome. Also noteable was the performance of  Robert Patrick (Terminator 2), who delivers in THE FACULTY as a dark and  menacing football coach turned alien.
All in all, well worth your time  and your money....",929836800,,846,4.853146853146853

7888892,5,6305428220,"When video rental stores and VHS tapes were still in (feeling nostalgic now) the lady that I used to rent VHS tapes from bought me a copy of The Faculty because I used to rent this movie every single weekend after school was out.

I was a big Elijah Wood fan back in the day which led me to discovering this movie in the first place. And I love films that focus on High Schools. This film has an enjoyable cast but the vulgarity level, at times, is unnecessary. Still, it does not impune on how good this movie is.

If you love aliens this is a great film!",1521590400,,556,4.091743119266055

7888898,4,6305428220,Its a good movie but the subplot kind of sucks. Kids do drugs if you want to save the world. And its not like they used the non super addicting drugs they used cocaine and all of them will go through withdraw and probably struggle with addiction for the rest of they're life.,1510790400,,275,4.2075471698113205
