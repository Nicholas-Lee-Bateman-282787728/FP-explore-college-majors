5009311,5,B006OKOWYU,"My son loves these dvds. Blues stock is really nice change, compared to other episodes. I recommend it if your child likes blue.",1403481600,,128,4.608695652173913
5009312,5,B006OKOWYU,My grandnephew loves this Blue's Clues video and listens to it all the time.  It is one of his favorites.  I wish the program were still on the air.,1380931200,3,148,4.068965517241379
5009313,5,B006OKOWYU,"Bought (BlueStock) it to replace a broken one.  Two DVDs for a great price. What a great deal, can't beat it!",1369180800,,109,4.190476190476191
5009314,5,B006OKOWYU,My son is totally enjoying it! He  watches it everyday and is learning from it. Would recommend to buy for toddlers.,1367020800,2,116,4.523809523809524
5009315,3,B006OKOWYU,"My two-year-old son loves Blue's Clues. He would rather watch one of the others that teach him the alphabet or numbers, but this one isn't bad. One of the bonus episodes is horrible -- Joe sings in an ""opera"" voice. I've only had it on once and I will never watch it again. I'd still like to see more of Steve than Joe. They keep releasing videos starring Joe, even though Steve made a lot more episodes over the history of the show.  All in all, if you've bought a bunch of other Blue's Clues and you want something new and your kid just wants Blue, then it's a worthwhile purchase.",1365120000,6,583,4.252252252252252
5009316,4,B006OKOWYU,"We bought this hoping that it would be a hit with the nephew since he liked Blue's musical, but not so much here. Partly I think because it's Joe and no one likes Joe (in our family anyway).",1458345600,2,190,4.026315789473684
5009317,5,B006OKOWYU,"My son dances along to these episodes and they really keep his attention. It's his first DVD obsession, being that he is only 3 lol so I love how its educational and incorporates sign language.",1457049600,,193,4.542857142857143
