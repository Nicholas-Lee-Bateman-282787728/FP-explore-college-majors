7935643,2,B00005ASO3,The narrator of this DVD sounded like a narcoleptic.  The person would start giving out information about the cars and stop talking for a good 2 minutes while the camera zooomed in on the cars.  When the vehicles were driven you could hardly hear the cars.  Overall the DVD was informative but don't expect to be entertained.,1188000000,,325,4.666666666666667
7935644,3,B00005ASO3,"The four latte slurping yuppies that found this so bad should consider that you don't get a ""Dreamworks"" type production with Clint Eastwood style direction and a Paul Newman level narrator for the price which they paid for this DVD.

As a Porsche owner, driver, former sports car competitor in the early days of SCCA racing, and a continueing attending fan I found this DVD interesting, informative, and certainly nostalgic and well organized and

definitely worth the price.",1164412800,,476,5.089743589743589
7935645,1,B00005ASO3,I am lost for words! You will do better to call a friend with a video camera and do the job yourself. Porsche AG should probably sue the company who commited this atrocity ! Avoid,1066867200,10,179,4.142857142857143
7935646,1,B00005ASO3,"I ordered The Distinguished Racing Heritage of Porsche as well as Ferrari by Brentwood Home Video. Once I viewed these DVDs I realized how Brentwood chose their name.
I would be ashamed to call these DVDs home videos. Their video quality is below that of most camcorders. The content is hokey and the music is reminisent of porn movies of the 70's.
You've been warned!",998265600,73,368,4.676923076923077
