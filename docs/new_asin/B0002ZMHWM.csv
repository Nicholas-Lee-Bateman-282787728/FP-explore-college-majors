2152326,5,B0002ZMHWM,"Yay!  I was worried they wouldn't release the rest of the series because of the new Batman series (Better animation, great design work, writing not as gripping, voice acting not quite as spectacular) but here it comes - just in time for me to drop some Christmas hints.  Now, here's hoping these boxes sell well enough to give the Superman and Justice League shows the same treatment.",1095033600,9,384,4.7164179104477615

2152329,5,B0002ZMHWM,Love the show! It's just the character design I don't like or understand. What's up with the super square chin and abnormally broad shoulders?,1508457600,,142,4.958333333333333

2152347,5,B0002ZMHWM,"Another set that doesn't disappoint !  Liked the extra feature on Robin on one of the discs.  The story telling is so strong, it does something that one would think might be impossible: to feel sympathy and empathy for the villains !

2152357,5,B0002ZMHWM,Probably the greatest super hero cartoon series of all time. Dark and mysterious as Batman should be but still kid friendly. I watched them when they aired on tv and now share them with my kids and they love it. A classic series that will stand the test of time. Nothing out there can compare.,1469577600,2,293,4.345454545454546
2152358,5,B0002ZMHWM,"I love this show.  It is one of those shows that is just simply awesome.  You sit back and see fabulously put together animation, stories well thought out and engaging, characters that look and sound amazing, and action that never ceases to hold your attention.  If you believe animation is meant to be humorous this is not for you, if you think animation can't have adult themes this is not for you, but if you want 100% entertainment and awesomeness this is for you.  I recommend buying the cheapest of the 4 volumes first and after watching you will either not want the other volumes or you will go ahead and buy the other 3(that's what I did) cause even though I remember liking this show I didn't know if it held up to time but it most certainly did.",1468540800,,755,4.371428571428571

I bought it used and next time I will by it new.",1466380800,,150,4.033333333333333
2152362,5,B0002ZMHWM,"Batman: The Animated Series - Volume Two picks up where Volume One left off.  This Batman cartoon is high quality all around and is for many people the definitive version of Batman when prime time TV shows, cartoons, movies and everything else Batman is weighed and considered, positives and negatives combined.  This animated series appeals to audiences of all ages, much like the 1960s TV show did.  Adults can watch this animated series and get as much if not more out of it than kids.  The animation is well done and the voice acting is superb, with many celebrities lending their voices to characters, such as Mark Hamill, Melissa Gilbert, John Vernon, Adrienne Barbeau and countless others.  The Joker episodes give Harley Quinn a lot of screen time.  Of course, all of your other favorite villains are featured on this volume, such as The Penguin, The Riddler, The Catwoman, Two Face, and many others.  This animated series depicts Gotham City as a dark and shadowy place with villains going to work after the sun sets.

Extras include commentary on 4 key episodes by the series creators, a segment called Robin Rising: How The Boy Wonder's Character Evolved, Gotham's Guardians: The Stalwart Supporting Characters, and Voices Of The Knight: Voiceover Stars Talk Some More - About Their Work.

Highly recommended.",1464393600,2,1320,4.9908675799086755
2152363,5,B0002ZMHWM,The only thing bad about this entire animated series is that it didn't last a LOT longer. Every episode is fantastic!,1464048000,,117,4.619047619047619
2152364,5,B0002ZMHWM,Great series,1461456000,,12,5.5
2152365,5,B0002ZMHWM,I got this with the first volume because I wanted to collect all the volumes.  This is a great series and I really enjoyed watching them when I was a kid.,1459641600,,154,3.967741935483871
2152366,5,B0002ZMHWM,My daughter loved getting these for Christmas.  She loves Batman and these did not disappoint.,1459296000,,94,5.266666666666667
2152367,5,B0002ZMHWM,"Arguably one of the finest animated series' produced, this particular volume as a few episodes which I love: ""The Laughing Fish,"" ""Night of the Ninja,"" and my all-time favorite - ""Almost Got 'Im"" The Harley Quinn character was definitely hitting stride during this batch. Again, the animation and writing is excellent. The only (minor) complaint I have is the plastic clips used to secure the discs in the case. It may be difficult to remove them the first time. However, once done, they are easier to remove later.

If you've got Volume One...this should be a no-brainer purchase. If not - this is a nice introduction to the series (though Volume One has it's merits too).",1455926400,,673,4.801724137931035

2152376,5,B0002ZMHWM,"In this review I,ve decided to consitrate on the audio commentary. In ROBIN'S REKCONING part 1 Bruce Timm and Eric Rodominski discuss the character development of Robin and his relationship with Batman. The fight scenes and Robin's confrontation with Batman over Tony Zucco are fully realized and dramatically portrayed!

In ALMOST GOT 'IM Bruce Timm, Eric Rodominski and Paul Dini discuss the villains who are playing cards and talking about Batman. Killer Croc is talking dumb and is actully Batman pretending he is Croc and Bruce finds it amusing he does this and the directers are commenting on the quality of the animation! All of the villains, sultry and sexy Poison Ivy, brutal Killer Croc, the crafty Penquin and the mad Joker are all well animated as is Two Face with good body language and gestures! Contrast this to the comment made about vol 1 in which the writer said the animation would be more exciting if it were less stiff and more animated! Considering certain budget restraits the animation is marvellous and the characters are very expressive!

In HARLEY AND IVY the contrast of the sexy Ivy and the goofy Harley is fully realized in the body language of the two girls and Bruce Timm's comments along Boyd Kirkland agree with just how expressive the girls really are! Whether it's takes or expressions as well as actions the characters are full bodied characters even when the budgets are fairly tight! While GARGOYLES has a higher budget from Disney, if it weren't for the success of BATMAN the ANIMATED SERIES there would be NO GARGOYLES!

I'm amazed at just how attractive the backrounds really are! When I recorded this show it was on vhs tape. In 2015 I'm watching these episodes for the first time on crystal clear DVD and i'm blown away by the quality of the craftsmanship! In HEART OF STEEL A Barberra Gordon. before Batgirl, does battle with a bunch of androids and Kevin Alteiri mentions his enjoyment of japanese anime as an enfluence on the episode! The 1990s saw a rise in creativity and we won't see animation rise to the level of the hand drawnanimation of the 1990s again! Not even the cgi computer graphics can match the power of hand drawn animation in the 20th century! I can hardly wait tor BATMAN vol 1 and 3 to come out by next weds!",1445644800,,2275,4.711055276381909
2152377,5,B0002ZMHWM,My absolute favorite show growing up as kid! So glad I own it now on DVD!,1445299200,,73,3.625
2152378,5,B0002ZMHWM,The definitive Batman animated series IMHO. Kevin Conroy IS Batman and this collection continues the fine work started in Volume One. Being it is a collection and has multiple discs watch out for the inevitable scratched disc......you always get one in a multiple disc pack. I think the stories in this one are a bit better and the writers and animators learned from Season One.,1444348800,,378,4.8307692307692305

2152386,5,B0002ZMHWM,"Still better then 90% if the stuff that comes out today and I like cartoons and anime. This series just set the bar and kept raising it every season.

In a time before the Marvel universe and it being ""cool"" to like comics/super heroes, this series was winning awards and shaping the industry into what it is today.

2152460,5,B0002ZMHWM,"This I bought mainly for the Tyger Tyger episode. Of the 28 episodes released between September 1992 and January 1993, the below are my favorites.
  Perchance to Dream. After being knocked out in a mysterious warehouse, Bruce wakes up in a world where his parents are alive, he is engaged to Selina Kyle, and someone else is Batman. But he cannot read anything. All devised by the Mad Hatter.
  The Laughing Fish. A personal favorite. The Joker starts threatening the patent office when they refuse to patent his deformed fish. Has lots of Harley Quinn.
  Cat Scratch Fever. When Catwoman searches for her missing cat, she uncovers a plot by Roland Daggett to infect Gotham City that Batman must stop. Bruce bails Selina out of jail and protects her later when she is infected and can barely move.
  The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne. Dr Hugo Strange uses his mind reading machine to learn Bruce's secret identity and attempts to auction it off to The Joker, Penguin, and Two-Face. But Two-Face refuses to believe Bruce Wayne is Batman. Dick Grayson impersonates Bruce in the last scene.
  Heart of Steel -- 2 parts -- First appearance of Batgirl. A hyper-sophisticated robot steals computer technology from Wayne Enterprises, leading Batman to a sentient supercomputer and its plans to replace humans with androids. Batman traces a series of robots to Cybertron's headquarters. Lots of references to R.U.R. play.
  Tyger Tyger. The best episode. Selina Kyle is captured by Dr. Emile Dorian and transformed into a humanoid cat creature. Tygrus falls for her. Very well-done.
  Almost Got 'Em. In a bar, a collection of Batman's enemies chat about their failed attempts to kill him. 4 stories. Catwoman saves Batman, then he saves Catwoman from Harley Quinn. Also Bruce impersonates Killer Croc. Has stories by Poison Ivy, then Two-Face, then Penguin, last and longest is by The Joker.
  I am the Night. Batman has serious doubts about his calling and he is depressed when Commissioner Gordon is seriously wounded by the Jazzman. But he feels better when Wizard thanks him and Gordon calls him a hero. The first appearance of Barbara Gordon.
  The Man Who Killed Batman. Sid the Squid tells his story of how he accidently seemed to have killed Batman, and now everyone wants to kill him, especially The Joker and Rupert Thorne. He is followed and saved twice by Batman. One scene has Harleen Quinzel pretending to be a lawyer bailing out Sid. Here she has a deeper voice.
  Zatanna. Zatanna Zatara, an old friend of Bruce Wayne from long ago, is framed for grand larceny, and Batman helps her to prove it was Dr. Montague Kane who committed the crime. Zatanna seems to be in love Bruce and knows him as John Smith.
  The Mechanic. The Penguin finds the mechanic (Earl Cooper) who designs the Batmobile and forces him to turn the current model into a deathtrap [an idea that had already been used in Batman Returns]. Batmobile destroyed. Also how Earl and Bruce met and built the Batmobile.
  Harley and Ivy. Another favorite. Harley Quinn teams up with Poison Ivy and both become the Queen of Crime, as Joker and Batman find out. The Joker had thrown Harley out, but ends up missing her. Harley tries to steal the Harlequin diamond, runs into Ivy and they become partners.
  There are others, but these are my favorites. Box set has documentaries on Robin Rising, Gotham's Guardian's, and Voices of the Knight.",1401494400,,3409,4.834482758620689

The cartoon that was so dark it was drawn on black paper, it featured superb writing and voice acting including Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Ed Asner, and Adrienne Barbeau.

The voice acting is wonderful, the series maintains the dark and brooding batman while still making him fun and engaging, and the Rogue's Gallery of villains that appear in the episodes still posses the level of insane violence and schemes. They are Bad Guys for the sake of being Bad Guys, and for an animated show, that's great. :-)",1382832000,,483,4.438202247191011
2152485,4,B0002ZMHWM,In this second season I'd have to say my favorite entity is that you get to see how clever the Cape Crusader is. The writing and the storylines have climbed a couple of notches as well. I'm continuing to see why this series won four Emmys for Best Animated Program.,1382486400,,265,4.32

2152488,5,B0002ZMHWM,"I forgot how grounded The early episodes of the Paul Dini/Bruce Tim interpritation of the DC Univers were.  Batman the Animated series is like Marvel's Ironman 1 & 2, compared to Justice League Unlimited being more Sci/Fi Fantasy than Marvel's Avengers.  Seasons 1 & 2 focus more on Batman being the world's greatest detective than the dark knight.  It's to the point were some episodes play out more like the shows CSI or the first half of an episode of Law and Order than a super hero cartoon.
If you are part of the generation that is to young to have watched the show when it was on the air, I highly recommend getting these DVD's.  Afer watching this set again, I can honestly say that this is still the best Batman tv show made to date.  The ones that followed were good in their own way, but when ever I pick up a comic book it is the voice actors from Batman the Animated Series that I hear in my head while I'm reading.",1380240000,,928,4.28
2152489,5,B0002ZMHWM,Great series and my kids enjoy the shows. It is light enough for kids but also pretty true to the older Batman stories.,1378857600,,119,4.217391304347826
2152490,5,B0002ZMHWM,"What I really like about this volume
1. It introduces the Ridder 'If your so smart why aren't you rich', and has the follow on episode where batman is inside a computer game he controls 'what is reality?'.
2. The Robin's Reckoning episodes dealing with Robins origin story and superb voice acting as well.
3. You get to see more of Bruce Wayne. I love the short scene in 'Jokers Wild' where the Jokers pretending to be working at a casino and Bruce sits at the table telling him how he doesn't like all the ugly clown faces decorating the casino and he couldn't work there. All the while he knows full well he's talking to the actual Joker. Then there's more on Bruce Wayne's past in the two Samurai Episodes, also great to watch.
4. Alfred's character is further developed in 'Eternal youth' where he goes to Poison Ivy's health spa and he plays a more active role in the Hugo Strange episode.
5. Love the 'Almost got him' episode, where batman's foes sit at a card game debating who has come closest to defeating the Dark Knight.

I was slightly disappointed with the quality of 'the strange case of Bruce Wayne' episode, but these are all from dvd without digitalization and dust gets in. In this instance, however, there was fuzziness every 30 seconds or so.

On the whole, it was great to be able to add another twenty episodes to my collection (I already have the volume 1).

2152491,5,B0002ZMHWM,"Imagine Gotham City had a daily cartoon for the kids about their citys real life Batman?  Yes, the reality of it all; with crazy killer clowns, vengeful body builders, two-faced and insane former public officials, and a bevy of other human monsters that create fear and panicBut what if they had a cartoon to lighten that reality up a bit, and relax the citizens in the process.  This might be that cartoon, only displaying the Dark Knight in a surreal, yet intriguing place, where the bad guys are not so bad, and they always get captured. Where Gotham looks like a mix between Alex Proyas Dark City and an Edward Hopper painting, with touches of German Expressionism thrown in for good measure

This series is for the pre 911 Batman fans, when we didn't know fear and sickness like we do today. Its a less harsh, more fanciful look at the Caped Crusader, in a fun and innocent way that might just take you back to a time when the world was just a bit less nuts.",1377129600,,963,4.429378531073446

29.  Eternal Youth:  Several rich industrialists are invited to the Eternal Youth Health Spa, and that's where they are last seen before disappearing.  The only connection: they had something to do with the death of plants.  Bruce Wayne also receives an invitation but Alfred and his ""lady friend"" Maggie, go in his place.

Bruce invites Duane to dinner, and around the same time, certain civilians start acting strangely.  A

He helps defeat the gangsters and arrest the Jazzman, but at a high cost--Gordon is severely wounded.

Off Balance:  While following Count Vertigo's trail, Batman encounters Talia, daughter of the head of the Society of Shadows, who was sent by her father to prevent the capture of a sonic drill that the Count stole.

53. Paging the Crime Doctor:  Dr. Matthew Thorne, losing his medical license and forced into becoming the crime doctor by his younger brother, crime boss Rupert Thorne, must perform delicate surgery on Rupert.  He can't do it alone, and kidnaps Dr. Leslie Thompkins to assist. Batman discovers Leslie's disappearance, and rushes to track her down - and has an additional interest in Matthew, because he was a medical school classmate of Bruce Wayne's father Thomas.  A-

As a massive comic fan, this 90's series is what Batman is to me. The Tim Burton movies are fun, the Nolan ones exciting, and cartoons like Batman Beyond are certainly amusing--but this show is Batman's real story. It's full of action, but heartfelt and rich in writing (Just watch the Mr. Freeze episode).",1356739200,,612,5.009803921568627

2152532,5,B0002ZMHWM,"My review for this is the same as for volumes 1 and 3, so I've just copied them below.

I know they made one a few years back, but I can't find one for a reasonable price at this point in time. These sets are perfect replacements. Every episode from one of my favorite cartoon shows of the 90's, what's better than that? Nothing.

The picture is good, not blu ray, but for a 20 year old cartoon it's pretty good. Sound is decent as well. I've noticed that a few episodes suffer from the speech is too quiet and action sounds/music is too loud when set at a normal volume. Am I complaining? No, It's not that much of a problem that I regret spending money on these. Just watch them with the volume control nearby.

As far as extras, I can't really comment. I haven't gotten into them. Usually I don't  bother with extras on TV show sets, especially cartoons. They're usually a bunch of rough sketches set to an explanation from the director or voice acting that was never used. Not my cup of tea.

I bought these just so I could have all the episodes to enjoy whenever I want. Now if they'd just do a release for Gargoyles I'd be all set.",1355097600,,1137,4.221198156682028
2152533,5,B0002ZMHWM,"You can not call yourself a Batman fan unless you have this in your collection. You will meet Zatanna, see a Robin Rising featurette, and the episode ' Almost got him' truly a must have!",1355011200,,186,4.3428571428571425
2152534,5,B0002ZMHWM,17 dollars for 28 episodes very good brings me back to my childhood brings back great one of the best animated shows ever,1354838400,,121,4.304347826086956
2152535,5,B0002ZMHWM,i would recommend this series to whom also love the batman series and enjoy awesome entertainment. so freaking awesome!! yay!,1353888000,,125,5.3
2152536,5,B0002ZMHWM,"God! Where do I even start?! The second volume is a triumph! Its superhero storytelling at its best, and absolutely essential for all Batfans young and old!

Heck, the episode called 'The Laughing Fish' is worth the money alone! Hands down the best episode of the Batman Animated Series, and honestly, one of my favorite Batman stories ever told in any medium. Whenever I get the chance to turn someone new on to this wonderful series, 'The Laughing Fish' is always the episode I pick out, and I have never had anyone tell me they were disappointed in the program I had selected. 'The Laughing Fish' is a phenomenal, stylish, disturbing, and cartoonish tour de force of superhero entertainment.

But that's not all, folks! Almost every single episode is fantastic! Sure, its got its clunkers, 'Moon Of The Wolf' and 'Cat Scratch Fever' for example are God awful, but it also includes some of the best work to ever come out of the animated series.

Along with the incredible Laughing Episode episode, volume two also boasts the Emmy Award winning two-parter 'Robin's Reckoning'. A very earnest and touching episode where the Boy Wonder's origin is completely explored, and I remember it being one of my favorites as a child. It hasn't lost its touch, the episode struck a chord with me. The darn thing works!

There is another fantastic two-parter included here and it is called 'Heart Of Steel', and it is a fan favorite. A wonderful Sci-Fi Batman story that remains one of the most exciting episodes of the Animated Series.

A few other stand-outs in volume two are the Riddler Episodes, and a Penguin episode titled 'Birds Of A Weather'. Paul Williams of Phantom Of The Paradise fame returns to give voice to the most sympathetic rendition of the beloved super villain. Penguin's best episode in the series and, most likely, the best Penguin tale there is in any medium.

As a kid I really enjoyed the two episodes featuring a villain called Kyodai Ken, a master Ninja Assassin from Bruce Wayne's past. The better of the two, an episode called 'Day Of The Samurai' is still one of my favorite episodes in the show's run. I loved the character of Kyodai Ken, and although I wish Bruce Timm and Co. did more with the character, I respect the fact that he never became old, tiresome, or non-threatening. Great character.

'Almost Got 'Im' is a Paul Dini classic, and another fan favorite. I was also quite partial to 'Perchance To Dream', it was a very bizarre and well done episode, almost like Batman does the Twilight Zone. I loved it. I think I might watch it again tonight actually, as it is a very absorbing story, and I enjoy the way they tell it.

The second volume is, in my opinion, the very best of the Animated Series. Volume One was pretty good too, and Volume Three (with the exception of a few episodes) was a rather week set. Volume Two is Batman The Animated Series at the top of its game, at full stride, and it just never lets up. The special features are short but sweet, and the commentary tracks are both informative and funny as usual. Buy the discs for the shows. I'm so happy I did, they helped to renew a love for Batman I hadn't felt so intensely since I was a kid. And as you grow up, anything that makes you feel twenty years younger is a good thing. And this, this is a good thing.",1351728000,,3310,4.5606060606060606
2152537,5,B0002ZMHWM,"I LOVE the Batman Series on T.V. I grew up watching them. Excelent Series. No Scracthes or nothing. I will continue to give my hard earned sweat, blood, and cash. Thank you Amazon!",1351641600,,180,4.484848484848484
2152538,5,B0002ZMHWM,"This collection continues where the first one left off, showing the series in its production order.  Back are Batman and Robin, (more Batman than Robin) fighting crime on the mean streets of Gotham City.  Like the rest of the series, these episodes feature mature writing and great artwork rarely seen in a children's cartoon series.  The caped crusader squares off against the nemeses he fought in the first collection:  The Joker, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Two Face, Penguin, Clayface and more.  Also making his series debut in this collection is the Riddler, a favorite of mine.  Most of these episodes are good to really good, with only a few duds, IMHO.  A stand out episode for me in this collection are ""Robin's Reckoning,"" which flashes back to when Dick Grayson became Robin and also features the older, college student Robin like never before in the series and shows how far he's come and how mature he is.  Other stand outs for me are ""Heart of Steel,"" which is one of the few episodes I actually remembered from the series, and ""The Man Who Killed Batman.""  So, all in all, a very good collection for Batman fans.",1351468800,,1125,4.698979591836735
2152539,5,B0002ZMHWM,"Well what can I say about Volume 2 of Batman: The Animated Series? I think it's a great volume of a great tv series that brings back so many memories in my childhood. Like Volume 1, this Volume 2 set has a lot of great episodes, along with some amazing special features. My personal favorite episodes from this set are Robin's Reckoning Part 1 and Part 2, Night of the Ninja,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne, If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?, Day of the Samurai, Almost Got 'Im, Zatanna, and The Mechanic. Robin's Reckoning reveals Dick Grayson's origins of how he came to live with Bruce Wayne. It was a very saddening episode for Dick because his parents were murdered by Tony Zucco because the owner of the circus his family was a part of refused to pay insurance money to Tony Zucco. Then of course Bruce decides to take Dick in as his ward, and Bruce vows he will find Tony Zucco. Then in Night of the Ninja, it reveals Bruce's origins of his martial arts training. I thought it was a great episode as it was Bruce Wayne who defeated Kyodai Ken, and not Batman. Then in the episode The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne, it introduces the villain Hugo Strange, who attempts to reveal Batman's secret identity as Bruce Wayne. Then there is the episode If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich? This episode introduces the villain Edward Nigma, aka The Riddler. Plus John Glover voices him, with one of his most recent roles was involved in playing Lionel Luthor, the father of Lex Luthor in The WB/The CW's Smallville. Plus he even played a villainous scientist in the Batman & Robin movie from 1997. Then in Day of the Samurai is when Batman once again faces against Kyodai Ken, who is trying to find a scroll which will reveal to him how to perform the death touch to kill Bruce Wayne. Then in Almost Got 'Im, this episode features the villains Two-Face, The Joker, Poison Ivy, The Penguin, and Killer Croc (who is actually Batman in disguise), each telling a story of how they almost killed Batman. Then comes the episode Zatanna, which of course introduces the character Zatanna who is a magician whose father Zatara taught Bruce all he knows about disappearing. Then comes The Mechanic, which is when the Batmobile is damaged, he takes it to his personal mechanic to repair it. Then The Penguin comes in to sabotage the Batmobile (very similar in the movie Batman Returns when Penguin sabotages the Batmobile in order to make people thing Batman has turned bad).

2152543,5,B0002ZMHWM,"...this is the one to buy.

As do the other sets, the production values of the series are exemplary.  This set contains five of this reviewer's favorite episodes: two of which are two-part installments (the award-winning ""Robin's Reckoning"" and ""Heart of Steel"") and single episodes (""The Laughing Fish,"" ""Joker's Wild,"" and ""Harley and Ivy"").  It's not coincidental that all of them, with the exception of ""Laughing Fish"" have commentary tracks because they represent the best the show has to offer.

Other great episodes are ""Birds of a Feather"" which presents The Penguin (voiced again by composer/actor Paul Williams) sympathetically and has a wonderful Shirley Walker score; ""Eternal Youth,"" a really creepy episode involving Poison Ivey's  revenge on those she feels are endangering the planet; and ""Perchance to Dream"" with a great turn by Roddy McDowall as The Mad Hatter.

Of course, ""Batman: the Animated Series"" never dropped the ball; so, there's something noteworthy in all of the installments in the compilation.",1346284800,,1026,5.341614906832298

This cartoon series was the greatest of all time in my opinion, like I said for both kids and adults. I purchased volume 3 and can't wait to view it.

2152546,5,B0002ZMHWM,"It's hard to believe these classics were made 20 years ago!  I remember when they originally aired and I couldn't record them.  That's because the station kept changing the time slot.  Batman is back and the animation is better than ever. This time we get to see more of Robin.  It's the newer version with the improved costume.  We also get to see Robin's journey in transforming to Night Wing.  It's too bad it wasn't a mini-series because Robin's story was worthy of a series.

But I digress, season two amps up the action!  It has more TV and voice actors we've never seen in a long time.  Adrianne Barbeau from ""Maude"" was perfectly cast as Cat Woman. Mark Hamill's has got to be the most under rated voice actor cast as the Joker.  His Joker has to be the definitive animated voice of the character.

I love Season 1, but Season 2 gives an experience of uniqueness as Batman's challenges get more complicated with villains like the Riddler, a personal favorite. Two-Face (another personal favorite bad guy) gradually continues his ""two-cents"" of the story arc that began with his downfall in Season 1 (""Shadow of the Bat"", pts. 1 and 2, followed by other Two-Face episodes leak into Season 3).

Top notch black-backgroug animation, exciting storylines and thrilling music combine into the rather foreboding atmosphere that millions of Batman fans will forever know to be that iconic Gotham City.

Volume 2 shows off the cartoons when their makers were in their best form. The voices are fully developed, the pacing is faster and more cinematic and some of the plots get a little darker and more adult.

If you're older than 6 and you like Batman, then pop these in the player and enjoy.",1300406400,,578,4.86734693877551
2152565,4,B0002ZMHWM,"I have seen all the episodes from the original animated series, from vol. 1 to vol. 3 (Vol. 4 is another version of the show, so I won't include it). The original animated series is SUPERB. I mean... is everything that everybody wants from Batman! Is dark, action-packed, and the script and animation are fantastic.

BTAS Vol. 2 is loaded with many good episodes but I don't think that they were so good as Vol. 1. In fact, I think that the only reason that this volume is worth buying it, is because of the two Riddler episodes (""If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?"", ""What is Reality?"") and four episodes that includes Joker and Harley (""The Laughing Fish"", ""Almost Got 'Im"", ""The Man Who Killed Batman"", ""Harley and Ivy"")

The rest of the episodes are pretty good. The Penguin episodes are MUCH better than the one in Vol. 1, the two Ninja episodes are pretty cool, the Robin episodes are very emotional, the Hugo Strange (Egghead) episode is kind of funny, the Mad Hatter episode is very confusing, the ""Heart of Steel Part 2"" episode is action-packed, and the episode ""The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy"" is very interesting.
I didn't liked ""Tyger, Tyger"" and ""Moon of the Wolf"". I also found the episode ""Mudslide"" pretty weak for a Clayface episode. The rest is okay (I was very disappointed that there were no Scarecrow episodes).

NOW! I don't recommend BTAS Vol. 3!! Unless you are a Harley fan, Ra's Al Ghul fan, or Batgirl fan (there are only 3 Harley episodes, 3 Batgirl episodes, and 4 Ra's Al Ghul episodes). The rest of the episodes are pretty weak and clich! Also, my second favorite villains which are Riddler and Scarecrow were tuned down here! I mean... Scarecrow only makes a small appearance in a couple of episodes and the Riddler episode was VERY weak. :(

Adios.",1300060800,,1786,4.624605678233438
2152566,5,B0002ZMHWM,"There are so many levels that Batman: The Animated Series works on that it is difficult if not impossible to sum them up in any review. However, I would like to try. First, the show gave Batman an aesthetic that was at once pleasing to children and to adults. Gotham City is a dark and dirty urban distopia not unlike Tim Burton's noir-ish portrayal of the Dark Knight's home, albeit in the animated series it is trimmed up into a classy art deco design. As is well known, the series animators were inspired by Max Fleischer's Superman cartoons, which are themselves classic. Their appreciation of older animation shows through and yet at no point dominates Batman: The Animated Series. Instead, watching these cartoons is like watching a whole tradition come to life. We see Burton's films, the 1930s early backdrop, a modern Gotham, art deco designs, Max Fleischer's Superman work. The series deserved its many awards for fine animation.

However, there is something else that needs to be touched upon: the story lines are simply brilliant. Although this began as a kid's cartoon, it brought with it an immensely complex and compelling level of psychological depth. It is not too much to say that Dini, Timm, and company effectively raised a number of existentially big questions in the series, ranging from the nature of friendship, the trauma of memory, betrayal, jealousy, loss, and above all justice and the possibility of redemption. I think that Batman: The Animated Series is not far removed from a form of moral pedagogy. This is particularly the case on volume 2, which has two of my favorite episodes on it, Robin's Reckoning (parts 1 and 2).  The issue of not letting your feelings outweigh your sense of justice is a very big theme, and the writers did a brilliant job of making this compelling. I treasure this series; my girlfriend and I have watched its many episodes many times and, above all, I look forward to sharing it someday with my own children. I do believe that this is the finest compliment that I can give it.",1298073600,2,2038,4.786931818181818

2152568,5,B0002ZMHWM,"I remember watching this show very fondly in the early 90's, and it still holds up today. That is the most surprising part I think, because there are some shows that are not as good as they used to be, when watched again. This show is the opposite as it got better with age, it even rivals so many animated series that are seen today. If you think about it, there are not many shows that can match the caliber of Batman. Some can come close, but not many. I've seen The Batman & Batman brave and the bold shows, and while there good they don't match this series. Probably because the creators wanted to draw more and more inspirations from the comic books with the 90's series which is good, after all that's where the character started. That is what Batman is, the dark, twisted, gothic characteristics of the villains and setting really shine through. I'm not someone who thinks that everything in entertainment sucks in the 2000's, but you have to admit that creators seemed to take bigger risks in the past.

What can I add to the praises of this show that has not already been said?  The animation, voice acting, and storylines are, of course, amazing.  We get 28 great epidsodes of the series in this volume.  Some of my favorites include: ""Almost Got 'Im,"" ""The Man Who Killed Batman,"" ""Zatanna,"" and ""Joker's Wild.""  Batman goes up against villains like The Joker, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Clayface, The Riddler, The Penguin, Catwoman, and several others.  Robin/Dick Grayson also makes a few appearances and we get to see his origin story.  There's also a hint of Batgirl.

The special features are really good in this volume.  There are commentaries on the episodes ""Robin's Reckoning, Part 1,"" ""Heart of Steel, Part 2,"" ""Almost Got 'Im,"" and ""Harley and Ivy.""  There are three featurettes: ""Robin Rising,"" ""Gotham's Guardians,"" and ""Voices of the Knight.""  I found them all very interesting, especially getting to see the voices behind the characters.

2152577,5,B0002ZMHWM,"The best animated Batman series by far.  Stays true to the feel of comics without alienating non-comic fans.  It is made for a younger audience and as a result the themes are toned done, but it is done in away that doesn't harm the integrity and complexity of the brilliantly formed characters of the franchise.  Other Batman animated ventures come off to campy (1970s ""Super Friends"") or are watered down, babied even (modern day ""Batman: The Bold and the Brave."")

22min isn't a lot of time to tell a Batman story which tend to be more intricate then other superhero smash and punch-athons so the series paint with broader strokes then the comics but that is to be expected.  Never does it sacrifice story to conform to the constants of what was (lets be honest here) a childrens show.

Of course I'm biased, I watch the series every day in my formative years and to those of you like me, yes, it is as good as you remember.  Also for the fans of the series there is some nice bonus features.  It isn't chalk full of extras but each volume has selected episodes with commentary and mini doc-featurettes.

Each show is like a small movie, and as the series got older the better the animation got, the better the acting got and the better the action an stories.  Overall: great fun for kids of all ages!",1222992000,,477,3.9894736842105263
2152595,5,B0002ZMHWM,"After the absolutely stunning run of action cartoons in the 80's, the 90's were suffering from a serious backlash against ""violent"" programming and there were no exciting cartoons left on the air.
That is until this absolute masterpiece of a cartoon series began airing in 1992.  This series hit the ground running with astounding story-telling and a dynamic visual style that was brought off with a new animation technique that was developed specifically for this show.
Stylistically, the show is set in a 1940's art-deco esque Gotham with a modern twist that is perfectly accented by the noir-film style that each episode is produced with.  The story telling is dark and exciting, yet never too violent or scary for young-ones (no blood etc.) and the writers absolutely nailed the character of Batman and his cast of Rogues who are brought to life with astounding voice acting.
If you like Batman, this is the best television series/DVD collection they have made to date.
This second season collection includes the classic episodes: Perchance to Dream, Night of the Ninja, Day of the Samurai, Joker's Wild, and the fan favourite Almost Got 'im which features Joker, Two-Face, Penguin, Poison Ivy, and Killer Croc. all discussing the time they came closest to getting the Bat.  A MUST HAVE for Batman fans!",1221177600,,1307,5.013824884792626
2152596,5,B0002ZMHWM,"Batman the Animated series is probably the best animated show to be released which makes it a must own for adults and kids alike.  This season especially since it includes ""Almost got Im"" which is the finest episode the show made.  Plus the featurette on the voice actors is great.  Buy this with confidence.",1220745600,,308,4.666666666666667
2152597,5,B0002ZMHWM,"Yes, I love the new Christopher Nolan movies.  But I have to admit, this animated incarnation of Batman from the early nineties will always be the definitive version of the character for me.  I readily admit I'm biased, as I grew up watching these shows, and seeing them today brings me back to a simpler time in my life.  But even now, as an adult, I am amazed at how well the storytelling on display holds up over a decade later.

This set builds upon the solid foundation laid by the first volume (which is also well worth a purchase), coming across as almost universially strong.  The writers and artist had clearly found their groove.  The characterizations are stronger and more nuanced, the animation is more consistant, and even the weaker episodes here are leagues better than some of the clunkers found on the first set.

Special praise needs to be handed out to the voice cast, which is uniformly excellent.  Kevin Conroy IS Batman.  Period, the end.  He switches between the playboy Bruce Wayne and driven Dark Knight with ease, and his ""Batman voice"" is nowhere near as grating as Christian Bale's.  All of the villains' voices ooze personality without sounding like characitures.  The performers really make you believe the characters have feelings and souls underneath their brightly colored costumes.  And of course, special praise should be given to Mark Hamill's absolutely inspired take on the Joker, which you can hear numerous times throughout this set.

Although almost all the episodes on this set are good, standouts for me include:

-""Robin's Reckoning,"" the Emmy-winning exploration of the Boy Wonder's origins (although Part I is definitely sronger than Part II)
-""The Laughing Fish,"" a pretty straightforward adaptation of the seventies comic tale in which Joker tries to collect royalties on fish he has mutated to look like him
-""If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?,"" the Riddler's origin story and a far more interesting take on the character than the laughing buffoon seen in the Adam West TV series or the mid-nineties film
-""Almost Got 'Im,"" a brilliantly told series of vignettes in which each member of Batman's rogues gallery relates how they almost took out the Bat (Penguin and Joker's are the best tales)
-""Harley and Ivy,"" which is a fan-favorite and definitely in my top 5 list of all time great episodes.  The always fun Harley Quinn (voiced to a T by Arleen Sorken) is thrown out by the Joker and teams up with Poison Ivy on a seemingly unstoppable crime spree.  This episode is a riot, but it also features a rather adult and complex portrayal of the Joker-Harley relationship, where he's clearly the abusive boyfriend but they both genuinely love each other.  Plus, who knew Poison Ivy could be so funny?

With 28 episodes on the set you get a lot of bang for your buck, and the featurettes and commentaries are an insightful look into the creation of the series (I genuinely wish there were more of them).  Any Batman fan should purchase this set, as it features an adult take on the character without the disturbing violence and imagery seen in the recent films, making it perfect for family viewing.  Both kids and adults will be entranced.",1220572800,3,3194,4.834558823529412
2152598,5,B0002ZMHWM,"The BTAS series continues in with this DVD box set. It contains episodes 29 to 56, which are in production order instead of airdate.

-Episode 1.29, Eternal Youth: Not a very intriguing episode. Poison Ivy's plot to turn people into trees seems silly and campy. The sub-plot involving Alfred and his lady friend Maggie ramps it up a notch, though. (2.5/5)

-Episode 1.30, Perchance to Dream: Lots of suspense and lots of twists at every corner. A must-see for all Batfans. (5/5)

-Episode 1.31, The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy: Josiah Underwood is hired to hunt down Batman by using confusing traps and mind-blowing techniques. This looks more like Riddler's work, but the plot twist at the end is a good one. (3.5/5)

-Episode 1.32 and 1.33, Robin's Reckoning: We go back in the past to see how Dick Grayson's parents are killed and how he becomes Robin. The two-parter has the perfect flow, but the climax could've improved with a more suspensful confrontation between Batman and Robin. (4.5/5)

-Episode 1.34, The Laughing Fish: Based on the DC comic, The Joker wants to copyright his smiling fish. But that's only the beginning as this episode as the right stuff: violence, suspense, Joker venom, black comedy, etc. (5/5)

-Episode 1.35, Night of the Ninja: Kyodai Ken isn't compelling enough. But the fight scenes are watchable. (2.5/5)

-Episode 1.36, Cat Scratch Fever: Another uninteresting episode. Professor Milo can't get any worse than this . . . (1.5/5)

-Episode 1.37, The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne: This episode could've been alot better in some quarters. But here we can perfectly see what motivates Bruce Wayne into being Batman. (3.5/5)

-Episode 1.38 and 1.39, Heart of Steel: A scary, yet cliched plot that involves androids replacing humans in society. (4.5/5)

-Episode 1.40, If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?: The debut of The Riddler. The confusing riddles here are much more effective than in ""Batman Forever"". And the maze is quite exciting. (4/5)

-Episode 1.41, Joker's Wild: Another excellent Joker Episode. I'd watch it again in a heartbeat! (5/5)

-Episode 1.42, Tyger Tyger: . . . meh. (3/5)

-Episode 1.43, Moon of the Wolf: This fails when compared to ""On Leather Wings"". More of an Outer Limits episode than a Batman plot. (1.5/5)

-Episode 1.44, Day of the Samurai: Better than ""Night of the Ninja"". Deals with Bruce's experiences in Japan and a secret Martial Art move that's deadly. The volcano looks beautiful. (4/5)

-Episode 1.45, Terror in the Sky: Not as good as ""On Leather Wings"", but the plane sequence is absolutely terrifying. (3/5)

-Episode 1.46, Almost Got 'Im: Lots of humor and chemstry between main villains. Highly recommendable. (5/5)

-Episode 1.47, Birds of a Feather: The Penguin and Veronica Vreeland don't make a perfect couple. But that's the point: it's funny and suspenseful. But what is the yellow rubber-ducky boat doing here? (4.5/5)

-Episode 1.48, What is Reality?: Two words . . . Virtual Reality. (5/5)

-Episode 1.49, I Am the Night: One of the best BTAS episodes since ""Heart of Ice"". Batman is doubting whether he's making a difference in Gotham City, especially when Comissioner Gordon is severely wounded during a shootout against ""The Jazzman"". (5/5)

-Episode 1.50, Off Balance: The Debut of Talia and Ra's Al Ghul (cameo). It's not a great episode, but it's still entertainingin some levels. (3/5)

-Episode 1.51, The Man Who Killed Batman: Tension is all around as a Sid the Squid thinks he's killed Batman. Joker's eulogy and Harley's ""Amazing Grace"" should be worth watching and listening to. (5/5)

-Episode 1.52, Mudslide: A Shakespearean tragedy. Very dark, and very depressing. (4/5)

-Episode 1.53, Paging the Crime Doctor: A bit boring in some parts, but still watchable. (3/5)

-Episode 1.54, Zatanna: This didn't catch my interest. ONe of the weaker episodes, I'd say. (2/5)

-Episode 1.55, The Mechanic: The plot is the same as Penguin's Batmobile scheme in ""Batman Returns"". But I still enjoyed it. (4/5)

-Episode 1.56, Harley and Ivy: Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy. WOW! What a duo! ""Get 'em."" (5/5)",1220227200,,4099,5.017725258493353
2152599,5,B0002ZMHWM,"Please read my Amazon review of Batman - The Animated Series, Volume One.

I have two boys (a 5 year old and a 4 year old). They are too young to watch the Batman movies -- Batman Begins and The Dark Knight -- but that doesn't stop them from being die-hard fans of the Caped Crusader.

Of course, these DVD collections are popular with older fans but young children can enjoy them, too.

There are a few scary scenes but nothing on par with what you'd find in the PG-13 rated movies. I recommend that you watch the cartoons along with your children and discuss it with them. I've found that I can reinforce Batman's good behaviors and point out what makes villians bad.",1217203200,,669,4.379032258064516

2152602,5,B0002ZMHWM,"These DVDs are the only ridiculously overpriced cartoon series I would purchase (or ask for as gifts) before marketers came to their senses and realized almost no season of anything should be worth more than 15 to 20 dollars.
The guys who made this bothered to read Batman books.  Old ones.  New ones.  Good ones.  Dorky ones.  Then they thought about what made it cool.  They borrowed all the fun parts of the first Tim Burton movie, then made one of the first multi-emmy winning cartoons ever.  Now that they had made Batman cool again, they didn't stop.  Filming each episode like a mini-movie (as they describe in excellent commentaries), they decide to dig up old DC comics characters, like Zatarra, the Grey Ghost (voiced by Adam West), and the Creeper, and then they create new characters that fit so well into the cannon that they get spin-offs, like Bullock, Montoya, and of course Harley Quinn.  But the best part is probably how they manage to take dopey things, like Robin, who never really made sense as a side kick (let's dress a kid in bright red and name him after a bird) and manage to make it serious and cool.

This set and each of the other three are excellent.  The extras are fine, commentaries most of all, but these guys went on to make Batman Beyond, and then Justice League, again taking strange and semi-unknown characters (Martian Manhunter and the Atom for example) and making them very cool.  I can't recommend it enough if you haven't seen them, and if you have, you'll want to keep them.

2152618,5,B0002ZMHWM,"In my oppinion the Warner TV animated Batman series of the 80's  is the best of all the Batman representations. It keeps to the original style that I grew up with within the covers of DC Comics. Kevin conroy as far as it goes is Batman. He plays both parts with the correct darkness (Dark Knight) and levity (Bruce Wayne). The animation is good and the opening title sequence with the music backing it is the best especially if you listen closly, you hear a huge chinese gong in the background reinforcing the darkness. The style is also reminscent of some japanese animations. So if you're a fan of this style of animation or an out and out Bat freak then this is for you",1123027200,,672,4.376
2152619,4,B0002ZMHWM,"Batman the Animated Series was a classic for many people back in the day, and it's great to see that they've gotten all three volumes out on DVD.  Much of what I experienced when watching the first volume crosses over to the second.  First, the voice acting and music are the some of the best that any cartoon has ever had.  Second, the artistic styling of the show is fantastically well-crafted and moody.  Third, the script and dialogue is by and large very, very good.  The downside, at least now, is two fold: (1)at certain junctures, the animation seems blocky and childish when compared to today's standards, and  (2) certain episodes you thought were great as a kid turn out to be a little flat.  However, this volume in particular distinguishes itself from the first and the third volumes by having some of the more classic episodes of the series, episodes that hold up to adult viewing and are in someways timeless and rewatchable.  While the Volume One had some great introductions for various characters (double episodes for Two-Face and Clayface, the famous ""Heart of Ice"" for Mr. Freeze), and Volume Three is by and large the most consistent in episodic quality, Volume Two is great for its stand-outs.  These include:

Perchance to Dream: an episode I remembered vividly as a kid and one that was even better to watch now.  The plot centers around Bruce Wayne awaking in his bed to find out that everything, from his parent's death and his escapades as Batman, has been a dream.  Well-scripted, creative, and with a great one-on-one battle at the end, this episode is one of the greatest and most unique in the Batman canon.  Overall: A+

Almost Got 'Im: An episode framed by the classic Batman villians (Joker, Two-Face, Penguin, Poison Ivy, and Killer Croc) sitting in a darkened bar while playing poker and telling stories.  The dialogue is excellent, the stories are entertaining, the the overall structure is truly superb.  This episode has great rewatchability, and certainly deserves the status of all-time classic.  Overall: A+

Joker's Wild: while not containing the best animation of the series, this episode sets the bar high for all Joker-centric episodes.  The dialogue is very, very funny, with a great lead-in of Joker and Poison Ivy squabbling in Arkham.  The quality of the writing continues, as does the quantity of the action, which is excellent.  There's a prison-break, a car chase, Batman fighting some thugs, Batman trapped on a giant roulette wheel with a grenade, a hang glider-helicopter chase, and a one-on-one Joker-Batman battle inside an out of control helicopter.  This is Batman at its most entertaining, and if you like Mark Hamill as the Joker, you'll love him in this episode.  Overall: A+

There are other greats, including ""Robin's Reckoning,"" ""The Laughing Fish,"" ""Off-Balance,"" and ""I Am the Night.""  As for the rest, the Riddler keeps things interesting, as does Kyodai Ken.  Some of the other episodes are a little disappointing, but with the high quality of the better episodes, this volume remains a great buy.",1119052800,4,3067,4.9298245614035086
2152620,4,B0002ZMHWM,"I was looking forward to watching this set, and the first episode I watched was ""Heart of Steel"", a two part episode. To my dismay, there was some extremely distracting flicker/blur throughout. I thought it may have been DVNR, which is used to ""smooth out"" some movies on DVD, but is a process which does NOT work on hand-drawn animation.

Luckily, ""Heart of Steel pts 1 and 2"", and ""The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne"" are the only episodes with this problem. I went frame-by-frame and could easily spot frames with an out of place ""ghost"" on them. So, the problem probably isn't DVNR, which has a tendency to remove lines and blur single frames in animation. Perhaps it's an incorrect attempt at de-interlacing, I don't know... But whatever the problem is, it's there and that's my reason for knocking this otherwise 5-star set down to 4.

Still, there are 25 other episodes on this set with no trace of this problem. As everyone else has commented, the show features great stories with great voice acting, music, direction, and animation. Definitely reccomended! But DVD mastering guys at Warner, please don't repeat that mastering mistake in the future!",1114560000,5,1156,4.862944162436548
2152621,5,B0002ZMHWM,"...How do you trump the Batman: The Animated Series boxset?

Answer:  You release a second one!

As that little bad joke suggests, the Riddler joins the line-up of Batman's Rogues Gallery in the second collection of Batman: The Animated Series.  And it's surprising to me that I actually enjoy the new one even more.  It has everything the first one had, and more, more appearances by Robin, more battles with the Joker, more of crime boss Rupert Thorne, and of course, more of Batman himself, voiced brilliantly by Kevin Conroy, who has done the voice of Bruce Wayne and his alter ego in more than 200 different DC related animated shows, not to mention about 5 different animated movies and 3 video games(and a few cassetes as well!).  Conroy has the dark, brooding voice of Batman down pat, so much I can't imagine Batman sounding like anything else now.  Props also to Loren Lester, Emfram Zimbalist Jr., and Mark Hamil, who do the voices of Robin, Alfred, and the Joker, respectively.  There's so much good stuff on this set.  Some of my favorites include the return of Clayface, who's slowly dying; Hugo Strange attempting to auction Batman's secret identity off to his enemies; two episodes of Batman taking on a deadly ninja from his past; the Riddler's debut; Bruce Wayne awakening to a ""perfect"" life; and many others.  There's also Off Balance, which features a cameo from Ra's a' Ghoul.  However, Ras himself won't be actually causing any mayhem until the 3rd and final TAS set.  Like the first set, this one has a few documentaries behind the series, although while the first one went behind the creations of the show, this one goes into the making of the supporting cast(Robin himself gets a whole documentary).  There's also some more top talent, including Seth Green, John Rhys-Daves, Bud Cort, Micheal York, Matt Frewer, Julie Brown, Tom Wilson, and even some top voice talent such as Jim Cummings, Jeff Bennett, and Paul Eiding, oh, plus there's also Melissa Gilbert as Batgirl!  This set is a great buy for fans of Batman, animation, or just looking for a good TV series in general!",1108771200,4,2101,4.78393351800554
2152622,5,B0002ZMHWM,"I'm not exaggerating when I say that I think this was the best animated superhero show ever.  From the very first episode the film noir style capture the truest essence of the old-style Batman.  The gritty, vengeful Batman...the expert detective and martial arts master.  This show featured so much to love from the outstanding animation to the well-written scripts to the fantastic voice talents.  This set contains 28 Batman Episodes over the 4 disk set.  Here are some of my favorite episodes of this great set:

""Perchance to Dream"" Marvelous episode as Bruce wakes up thinking he had only dreamed that his parents died and he became the Batman.  But he slowly unveils the truth and now Bruce has to battle his alter-ego, Batman.

""The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne"" - When Judge Vargas, a friend of Bruce Wayne's, is blackmailed by Dr. Hugo Strange, Bruce journeys to Strange's health resort in Yucca Springs to investigate. Strange has a machine that can see people's thoughts and discovers that Bruce is Batman. He then attempts to auction Batman's secret identity to the Joker, Two-Face and the Penguin.

""If You're so Smart Why Aren't you Rich?"" - When Edward Nygma, the creator of the computer game, 'Riddle of the Minotaur,' demands his share of profits he is fired. Nygma vows revenge, and years later when his former boss is selling his company Nygma makes his move and becomes the Riddler!

""Joker's Wild"" - The Joker breaks out of Arkham Asylum when he learns billionaire developer Cameron Kaiser has built a gambling casino exploiting the evil clown's likeness. Batman is also infuriated, knowing the Joker will destroy the casino and everyone in it to avenge his wounded pride.

""The Laughing Fish""  Hilarious episode.  The Joker has developed a chemical which induces a 'Joker' smile on fish. He makes a visit to the Gotham copyright offices, demanding a copyright for his Joker fish. When the frightened bureaucrats tell him that such a copyright is impossible, he threatens to kill them one by one until he gets what he wants.

""Harley & Ivy"" - After the joker kicks her out of the gang, Harley Quinn forms a partnership with Poison Ivy. The Joker has a fit when he hears of their 'Thelma and Louise'-style crime spree, and sets out to get Harley back.

""Zatanna"" - When the glamorous magician Zatanna is framed for a robbery during her act, Batman comes to her defense. The two heroes unite and use the skills her father, Zatara, taught them to expose and combat an evil illusionist.

""Mudslide"" - Clayface is falling apart- literally. His clay like body is virtually disintegrating. Fortunately, a woman scientist he knew from his movie star days is working on a remedy. However, Hagen is forced to steal money to pay for the expensive components of the remedy.

""Off Balance"" - While following Count Vertigo's trail, Batman encounters a Lady In Black and learns that she is Talia, daughter of the head of the Society of Shadows who was sent by her father to prevent the capture of a sonic drill that the Count stole. But after his identity is mistakenly revealed to Talia, Batman remains off-balance as to where her true loyalties lie.

The outstanding writing in the series should come as no surprise as the shows were written by many long-time comic writers including len Wein, Paul Dini, etc.  These guys really know Batman and capture him so close to Bob Kane's original vision.  Obviously the violence is toned down from the comics but that doesn't mean there's any lack of action.

If I have one minor complaint its that the episodes are NOT in chronological order.  Not sure why Warners did it this way.  The set comes with commentary on several episodes and a few short featurettes which were really good.

Now maybe if they can put together a Justice League package just like this one, I can die happy!",1108598400,10,3834,4.783004552352049
2152623,5,B0002ZMHWM,"It doesn't get any better this, folks. Batman:TAS has been hailed for years as THE best incarnation of Batman, capturing an essence that the films, TV show, etc could never achieve. And I agree! The writing is beyond excellent! Each 20+ minute show draws you in to the world of Gotham and all of its fascinating characters and architecture. The animation is superb and is better than later attempts. Standout epsidoes include ""Laughing Fish"" with Harley singing a cute lil jingle, ""Almost Got Im"" and ""Harley & Ivy."" The only downside is there are no Mr. Freeze episodes on this volume, so hurry up and release volume three.",1107388800,6,624,4.787037037037037
2152624,5,B0002ZMHWM,"If nothing else, buy this for the Joker.  Even in his mellowed down form for the cartoon, the Joker is still the greatest villain to ever grace a comic book/cartoon.  Why?  While the Joker has always been one of the finest villains with insane methods of bugging the Bat, it's Mark Hamill's voice that sells it.  If you've never heard Ole Luke Skywalker do the Joker, among other cartoon villains, you will not believe what he's capable of -- the Force never came close the power of his sinister laugh.  While there is a vast array of voice talent such as Arleen Sorkin and Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill clearly rules this cartoon and everytime the Joker makes an appearance you're sure for a good show.",1107129600,4,699,4.56
2152625,5,B0002ZMHWM,"The episodes collected in the first volume of Batman: The Animated Series on DVD were great in their own right, but the episodes collected in this newly released second volume of the series is something really special.  Here, the viewer is introduced to Ra's Al Ghul and his seductive daughter in a glorius two parter.  The first appearance of the Riddler is here as well, and the Emmy winning ""Robin's Reckoning"" two parter; in which the origin of Robin is revealed as the Boy Wonder is on the road to revenge.  ""Tyger, Tyger"" is a standout as well as Catwoman is kidnapped by a very mad scientist, and the Dark Knight is pushed to his limits to save her on an island very similar to that of the Island of Dr. Moreau.  ""The Cape & Cowl Conspiracy"" is outstanding, and the darkly funny ""The Man Who Killed Batman"", in which a bumbling wanna-be hood finds himself suddenly popular after he seemingly off's Batman.  The writing and voice talents are what make the cartoon so great, with Kevin Conroy his usual excellent self as Batman, and Mark Hamil is perfect is the Joker.  David Warner and John Glover are perfectly cast as well as Ra's and the Riddler respectively, while the writing allows the detective apects of Batman's character to overshadow the ""super hero"" status he gained in the feature films.  All in all, Batman: The Animated Series is easily the best super hero cartoon ever produced, and if you missed out on it years ago, now is the time to give it a look.",1106956800,7,1474,4.5606060606060606
2152626,4,B0002ZMHWM,"The only reason I can't give this five stars is because I have some issues with the audio. It's either too loud or too quiet.  But still, that doesn't stop me from enjoying the episodes on this DVD. I own Volume 1, but I have to say that this is the one I've really been looking forward to.

Most of my favorite episodes are on here, and I haven't seen a number of them in over ten years, but I remember them fondly. In my review of the Gargoyles Season One DVD (another cartoon collection worth buying), I spoke of how it was rare for an after-school cartoon to have such dark subject matter. Well, if you watch a few episodes of Batman, you'll see where Gargoyles got it from (of course, a few of the people who wrote for Batman, such as Eric Luke and Michael Reaves, also wrote for Gargoyles, not to mention the fact that Carl Johnson, who composed the soundtrack for Batman: TAS, wrote the music for Gargoyles as well). For example, an episode on Disc 3, entitled ""I Am the Night,"" deals with Comissioner Gordon getting shot. I first saw this when I was twelve or thirteen, and before that, my after-school cartoon regimen consisted mostly of things like Ducktales. I was also surprised to see that some episodes (such as ""Robin's Reckoning"" and ""Off Balance"") contained death. This showed me a new face of animation, one that could be dark and chilling as well as warm and fuzzy.

Visually, I love the direction that the production team decided to take Batman in. Drawing upon such inspirations as 30s art-deco (think Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"") and 40s film noir, not to mention a few references to the classic style of the Superman cartoons done by the Fleischer brothers, Gotham City and its inhabitants have a look and feel to them that is retro, sleek, and post-modern all at the same time. Batman's villains also look great. Instead of being garish and over-the-top, as the villains in Schumacher's failed attempts to direct Batman movie sequels were, their appearance and behavior here are more streamed-down than overblown (I especially love how they handled Two-Face, Mr. Freeze, the Riddler, and the Penguin). Unlike the old Adam West series, you won't find anything campy, gimmicky, or ludicrously slap-stick here. Instead, we have a more down-to-Earth depiction of a man obsessed with justice and a strong moral obligation induced by his childhood trauma. Of course, this is made even better by the voice talent. They could not have found a better voice for Batman than Kevin Conroy. Then of course, there's Mark Hammill's shockingly outstanding portrayal of Batman's nemesis, the Joker. Other noteworthy performances include Efram Zimbalist Jr. (Alfred Pennyworth), ""Hell-boy"" Ron Perlman (Clayface), Bob Hastings (Comissioner Gordon), and ""Night Court"" alum Richard Moll (Two-Face).

I only hope that we see a Volume 3, as a few of my favorite episodes, such as ""His Silicon Soul"" and the two-part ""Shadow of the Bat"" (which deals with the origins of Batgirl), were not put on the first two Volumes. But so far, it is good to see one of my favorite childhood cartoons (about my favorite comic book hero, no less) collected on DVD. If you liked this show, or if you like either Batman or cartoons in general, you should buy this.",1106870400,3,3246,4.780748663101604
2152627,5,B0002ZMHWM,"&#65279;After years of steadfastly ignoring the ardent wishes of its fan base, Warner Brothers is finally continuing to release its landmark Batman: The Animated Series in quailty DVD complete box sets,instead of dolling the episodes out at a sluggish four or five at a time! The ""seasons"" are somewhat complicated to explain as the Animated saga is actually comprised of three separate ""series"" that originally aired from 1992-1995, with some of the episodes being replayed in the upcoming ""season,"" hence the designation of ""Volume"" rather than ""Season"" in the DVD box set releases.

As has been noted, this 4-disc set features 28 episodes including the first appearances of Ra's Al Ghul, voiced by David Warner, his daughter Talia, voiced by Helen Slater, in the facinating episode entitled, ""Off Balance."" The set also includes the Riddler, voiced by John Glover, in, ""If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?"" This release also includes the Emmy-winning ""Robin's Reckoning,"" which deals with the murder of Dick Grayson's parents and subsequent emotional trauma when Grayson, who is now Robin learns the identity of the killer. This episode includes corresponding commentary by the equally brilliant Bruce W. Timm and Eric Radomski.

The creators of this Animated classic series set to their task after the first Batman movie and somehow managed to capture the essence of the comic book world of Batman, without the gore of the mainstream comic book titles.

In one of the last hand-painted animation shows ever to have been rendered, Batman: The Animated Series is as flawless a rendition of Bob Kane's mythic creation as ever captured on comic paper or film, both live-action and animation. Time will tell, but I believe the Batman Animated saga is worthy of being crowned the greatest animated Superhero series to have ever been produced. Regardless of its place in history, it changed the animated genre forever as well as, ironically, the comic book and film depictions that spawned it. It is pure magic.

The ""Dark Deco"" design of Gotham City and all of the characters in the Batman mythos were deftly crafted by many of the modern comic industry's greatest talents including: Alan Burnett, Paul Dini and the aforementioned Bruce W. Timm. Every subtle nuance was anticipated and superbly rendered in serious stories that merged the childhood wonder and excitement of comic books with the adult appreciation for drama, humor and tragedy.

Each half-hour episode feels like a movie, and the voice actors who portrayed the characters were so well matched that theirs are now the ONLY voices I hear when I read the comic. Since I'm 48 and have been reading The Batman since I was a kid, that's saying something.

Credit goes to the voice talents of Kevin Conroy, who pulls off the best Batman and Bruce Wayne voices I have ever heard, along with Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars Trilogy) for literally BECOMING the Joker in his voice portrayal. Other steller voice talents belong to Efrem Zimbalist Jr., for a flawless Alfred Pennyworth, the stalwart Wayne family butler; Adrienne Barbeau as the Catwoman Selina Kyle; and Arlene Sorkin as Harley Quinn (a character created in the Animated Series, which in a cool twist, was then introduced into the mainstream comic book titles.)

The talented Shirley Jackson composed the memorable music, which again blends perfectly with the whole to create a true animated masterpiece.

Because these series feature stories of the Dark Knight, it remains utterly amazing that the bulk of the episodes take place in Gotham City at night, but nonetheless manage to have amazing color and true vitality. This striking visual style was given to each character, too, making them seem more sturdy and larger than life but totally believable.

While the background of the characters is outside of the mainstream comic book continuity, the Animated Series remained true to the core of the characters' personalities and motivations more than ANY other rendition. It is so compelling that you can not only see Gotham, but feel, smell and even taste this ""fictitious"" city!

To watch these shows is to fall permanently under the spell of The Batman, the great loner detective, who was driven to crimefighting after the senseless murder of his parents that occurred in front of him during a robbery when he was a boy.

This Batman is noble, tragic, funny, brilliant, obsessed, selfless, real and completely heroic, elements that were sadly missing in the many movie portrayls of the character and often missing in today's comic book maintstream depictions that too often rely on violence (rationalized as ""action"") in lieu of honest storytelling.

If you have never seen this show, whether adult or child, you should. And for those of us who watched with utter amazement and joy during its original run, these are hugely anticipated DVD

releases.

Let us hope that the remaining episodes will be released soon, and that the subsequent series, Batman Beyond, which was a look at the Caped Crusader in the future complete with an aging Bruce Wayne and a new ""Batman,"" will also soon be released in full on DVD.",1102636800,146,5152,5.038777908343126
2152628,5,B0002ZMHWM,"Okay, maybe that's not true but I still believe that Batman: The Animated Series is the best rendition of the B-man put to screen yet, and that counts the Tim Burton movies (I refuse to comment on the latter two movies) and the cheesy, yet entertaining 60s TV series with Adam West.  Paul Dini and Bruce Timm are/were geniuses and although the animation could be a little not too animated at times, the storylines (Tyger, Tyger not included) were all top notch and they really got the character of the Dark Knight down.  Kevin Conroy is the best Batman ever, Mark Hamill is a genius, I could go on about the characters, all of which are great.  Anyone who loves Batman and is disappointed in the way he has yet to be properly adapted to screen needs to pick this up.  I'm so glad they have it on DVD now because I only have a few VHS tapes of the show and I don't even know if I still have a VCR.  I'm not even sure if I still remember how to use one of those things.  Anyway, Batman.  The Animated Series.  Excellent.  Buy it.",1101600000,7,1027,4.225641025641026
