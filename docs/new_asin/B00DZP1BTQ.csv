5880289,4,B00DZP1BTQ,"A little - no, a lot - weird but a nice story all-in-all.

The premise is pretty much what it says on the tin; we have a hero is is zombie-mad. (One wonders if, when the Zombie Apocalypse does happen, if he'll fight or go get bitten on purpose...). He meets a girl, then, well, things happen.

There are bittersweet aspects to the relationship for there is a certain amount of impermanence implied, even more so than you get with 'normal' relationships. But, it works, and it is funny often enough.

Watch carefully for some foreshadowing.

There is an incomplete feel to the story, it could easily stand another 'season' to match the 13 episodes this package contains. There are supposed to be 3 OVAs out there and those may do the expected wrap up.

That last comes with a bit of a caveat: there is word that Funimation is recalling this package due to issues of either censoring of the original or abridgement of the masters. I found the series to be enjoyable as-is, just somehow incomplete. I'm at a loss to understand what is meant by censoring as the fanservice is still pretty blatant.

Given that last if I had known the issues I would have waited for the re-packaging Funimation is supposed to be doing. The series is worth owning/watching... just not now in its present form.

Let me re-stress that last; the series is enjoyable, funny often enough and bittersweet. The production values are good as is the voice acting. Get this, you should enjoy it just fine if you like the genre.

Just... wait a while. Give Funimation a chance to correct the issues alluded to above. Heck, maybe they'll re-issue with the OVAs too.",1383696000,9,1630,4.596551724137931
5880290,4,B00DZP1BTQ,"Story- This series is definitely interesting taking a new look at the romance/horror genre by combining dark and twisted moments with sweet and romantic ones, it has lovable characters who some of which are unique (Chihiro, Rea, and Grandpa) but the rest are cookie cutter. the white elephant in the room isn't that though, its the cliff hanger. plus it never delved deeply into the Rea being a zombie as much as i would have liked  Animation- the Animation Production is done by Studio Deen the makers of Higurashi and Fate/Stay Night. they did a good job with the Animation and liked how they made it dark when need be and light and sunny when need be, i also love all the horror posters and chucky and jason dolls and masks in Chihiro's room.  Soundtrack- the music is alright throughout the actual show but the opening and ending songs are two addictive musical pieces. the voice acting on the English Side is amazing (love romero ref.",1383609600,,939,4.650602409638554
5880291,5,B00DZP1BTQ,"For the ignorant people who can't read the title of this product, it says ""Broadcast Edit Verson"" WHICH MEANS IT WILL BE CENSORED!!!

Funimation has stated they've chosen to recall the release of this series due to issues.  The original issue is the masters they worked from were the televised versions(which are editing for time and censored for air in Japan).

But anyways Sankarea....it was interesting. Not really great and not really bad. It's just hard to really put in a good review when there's not much to work with. It feels like it doesn't know what direction it wants to go in. Does it want to be drama, does it want to be a slice of life, romance, horror/goth? It's like the show can't make its mind. Maybe after giving this another go later maybe I can formulate a better review.",1380585600,3,585,4.4766355140186915

5880296,3,B00DZP1BTQ,"I have watched the show, but not these specific DVDs, so I am not offering an opinion on this order specifically.

This show has some interesting tone issues, with issues of sexualizing children, emotional abuse, necrophilia, and incest.
If you are expecting a straight up comedy with a quirky undead twist then you might be off put.  Conversely if you are looking for a dark and gothic show with a macabre twist, then you might be put off by all the goofy content.  So I don't even know who this was aimed at.",1380326400,,510,4.462365591397849
5880297,1,B00DZP1BTQ,"Funimation has messed up this release majorly and has put the heavily censored TV version of this series on the Blu Ray/DVD sets and does not currently have the uncensored masters on hand yet.

Because of this, if you buy this release from Amazon or anywhere at the moment, you will notice that the episodes are heavily censored in scenes.

I suggest people cancel their pre orders and refrain from buying this series until Funimation has shipped the uncensored boxsets to retailers at some point in the future.

I am absolutely against censorship but think that this needs to be mentioned, many of you will need to return your boxsets to Amazon and request a refund, a replacement won't make any difference, you will just get a censored boxset sent to you.

Sit tight, Funimation doesn't make mistakes often, and as you've noticed I haven't in any way been negative towards Funimation.

I will leave this review up for a short while before removing, more as a heads up for people who don't know, I'll also link to the article talking about this in the comments section for further clarification.",1380326400,182,1096,4.747368421052632

The story get me so interested that i had to read the manga to know a lot more, because right after you finish this one you will ""die"" for a second season hahaha..... watch it and see it for yourself.",1379116800,7,804,4.220779220779221

If this is a series you've been thinking about getting then GET IT! It's one of the best out there if you love romance...and zombies lol. I just wish there had been a second season made.

5880303,2,B00DZP1BTQ,"Sankarea is a show that I really wanted to like.  It had a lot going for it.  The idea behind the story is extremely interesting, and the two leads are compelling and actually have some depth. Artistically, the show looks great, and it isn't afraid to deal with some pretty heavy subject matter. It should have been a slam dunk.

It wasn't.

My biggest problem is that Sankarea goes nowhere.  These thirteen episodes are all set up and background.  There is a small through plot, but when the show ends, it is obvious that there is a whole lot of story left to tell.  Luckily, the manga is available in English for those who want to finish the series. Still, the show spends a surprising amount of time exploring the backgrounds of its cast, including Babu the cat.  I appreciated the storytelling, and I really did enjoy getting to know most of the characters, but once I got to know everyone, I really wanted to see their stories play out, and then... the show ends.  It is obvious that everyone involved with the creation of the show had intended for a second season, and as far as I know, that second season never happened.

The other issue is the fan service.  Sankarea deals with some pretty dark subject matter, including sexual abuse.  The problem is that the character at the center of this abuse is also regularly used for a quick glimpse of skin.  While the fan service is fairly mild, it is still off putting due to the nature of that character's backstory, and how it is presented.

Sankarea is half a great anime series.  Sadly, the other half never got made.  I can't recommend this series based solely on the fact that it feels so completely incomplete.  However, if you are a fan of the manga, or interested in the manga, this series could work as a nice compliment.  Otherwise, I have to say, give Sankarea a pass.

(As a side note.  There is a lot of noise about this series being censored.  The original release was censored, as Funimation had received the broadcast masters instead of the DVD masters.  The current release, the one with the bloody cover, is uncensored. I don't believe the censored release is still available for purchase.  However, I should point at that even uncensored, the show is not very extreme.  There is a tiny bit of nudity early on, and a few glimpses of violence, but over all the show is not overflowing with objectionable content.)",1452816000,5,2383,4.566037735849057

5880305,3,B00DZP1BTQ,"I was pretty disappointed with this series ending, it felt incomplete and granted you can continue the story by reading the Manga.  It felt like I was reading the first 3 volumes of the Manga, so there's a lot of stuff not explained.  I won't go into the show details because there are plenty other reviews from people that want to ruin it for you.  I burned through all of the episodes pretty quickly but I can't recall liking anyone in particular.  Other than liking Zombie chicks, the main character failed to have any redeeming qualities for me.  Supporting cast was pretty much zilch.  I really wanted to like this series because its not your typical Anime but I thought that it fell short of being good.  I think there was a lot of stink made because Funimation's first release was the one aired in Japan so it was censored, I got the uncut version but the death scene was hardly memorable uncut (oops did i spoil something?).",1450224000,,932,4.511904761904762
5880306,3,B00DZP1BTQ,"Zombies and Love, but mostly zombies. Here is my review for Sankarea

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) Chihiro Furuya the male protagonist of this show, is a zombie loving teenager of the story here. He lives with his dad, sister and grandfather at a temple and they take care of it. Our other protagonist is Rea Sanka the title character of the show. She is a rich girl who wishes for a normal life but her extreme overprotective dad won't let her do anything she wishes. One day Chihiro's cat Babu got hit by a car and died. Chihiro got extremely sad. A few days later after Babu's death Chihiro went to clean out the atic upstairs when he finds a manuel that is badly damaged and very hard to read but its a resurrection potion how to book to bring the dead back to life. Chihiro digs up Babu and brings him to a deserted factory where he tired making the potion. While createing the potion he finds Rea crying and screaming into a well wishing for her father to let her be free and do what she wishes. When he calls out to her she runs away. Next day he goes back to trying to get Babu alive again but Rea is there again crying. He tries to cheer her up and she tries to help Chihiro resurrect Babu. When they try a different way to make the potion they give some to Babu but it doesn't work. Then Rea makes Chihiro promise her that is she dies he would take care of her because of her wish to be free from her father then she drinks the potion hopeing that it would make her come back to life if it worked. When Rea's father Dan'ichir find Rea and Chichiro he chases her up a cliff wanting her to come back. When she refuses she commits sucide and falls off a cliff and gets impaled on a tree stub branch and dies. Dan'ichiro over comed with sadness watches from above, When Chihiro runs over to Rea's body she starts pulling her self up. She confirms the potion works and she has come back as a zombie for Chihiro to take of now. Dan'ichiro sees this and rushes down to get his daughter, when she tells him that shes dead and no long he plots to take out Chihiro and make Rea his again. Then that when the real story begins.

Pros:  The story feel mostly good. The character are all really good in depth. It a good anime over all. The are boobs and butt shown because of the uncut version of this being shown. I saw this show on TV so im not sure if it was the uncut version but I think it wasn't so there are more scenes with boobs and other uncut fanservice.

Cons: When I said the story mostly feels good I mean that is that each episode seems to move yet the story goes slowly. At times I wish there was some more action, its a very low action anime. Most of the time Chihiro is concerned with Rea and her zombieness and trying to keep her from decomposing and turning into bones. The romance of the story feels cut and dry with Rea and Chihiro, other than 2 kisses that is about it. Another thing I find a con here is Rea's dad and how his part in the story is a nasty overly protective is trying to get her back to be his again. He is shown as a rich and dare I say yes a pedo because he takes picts of his daughter Rea nude for his own pleasure. Yes he is a very sick invidual. Other than Chihiro and Rea and Dan'ichiro's 2nd wife, everyone else in the story either doesn't know he does this or the people working in his mansion just don't care.

Side note: as of today 9-20-2015 or 20-9-2015 the dvd set is for 39.95, which I feel is too expensive for just 13 episodes.

Over all: To me this was an alright series, I just wish some else would have happened, some bigger action or something else in the story but nothing. I liked it but I don't think I would watch this series again",1442707200,2,3705,4.117565698478561

5880320,5,B00DZP1BTQ,"If you are put off by all of the reviews saying this is the censored version, don't be. The version listed here to be released on March 31, 2015 is the uncut/uncensored product. There was an unfortunate problem with the last release because the discs were made from the censored version that aired on TV in japan. Naturally, a broadcast version may have to be toned down at parts, but they stopped producing that version and promised to release the full version once they get the uncensored masters. This is that version, so there is going to be some slight nudity and uncensored gore. Anyway, onto the review! --

Sankarea is about a zombie-obsessed kid named Chihiro Furuya who has no interest whatsoever in real girls, at least not ones that are living. Too bad for him that zombies aren't a real thing, right? Enter Rea Sanka, a prototypical rich girl who seems to have it all, unfortunately her home life leaves something to be desired. Through the perfect combination of Rea's desperation, an accident, and a reanimation elixir that no one actually believed would work, Chihiro finally gets a chance to be with the girl of his dreams.. kind of. Naturally, the issue of dating a real life zombie is not without its complications.

If you've ever watched any movie or show where two people are trying to develop a relationship while hiding the fact that one of the pair is secretly a supernatural creature, from another planet, a mannequin (uh oh, I'm dating myself here) or something else like that, then you'll be in some familiar territory with this show. Much of the hijinks in the show revolves around Chihiro and Rea trying to deal with her recently developed status as a member of the undead, while trying their best to hide it from their very inquisitive friends and family, which leaves an opening for many funny and entertaining moments. At the same time, there are moments of worrying over the seriousness of Rea's condition, and her very human expressions of wanting to live a normal life despite having been turned into a zombie, so there's a high/low element of comedy and drama. The cast of characters is memorable and well-developed, as well as small and focused enough that you don't have to remember too many names or people in the 13 episodes that you get.

The only downside I would say is that I wish there was more of it. The manga it was based on extends far past what we get in the show, and so far there's been no whisper of a season 2 in the works.

That said, I don't think you would regret picking this up. It still is a good story, it is decently character-driven, and it doesn't suffer from an oversaturation of sterotypical anime tropes and quirks, so it'd probably even be good to show to someone with only a casual interest in anime (or no interest at all). The art style is also very appealing, making it that much easier to watch. I personally can't wait to watch it again.",1426204800,26,2912,4.594230769230769

The plot revolves around a boy who has always wanted a zombie girlfriend since he was a young boy and a girl who wants to escape the clutches of her controlling father. What results is a dramedy of undead proportions that ends with a hint that a second season could very well be made.

Now if you read other reviews, they mention that this product is heavily censored and FUNIMATION issued a recall since the uncensored content would change the rating from TV-14 to TV-MA and allow me to be brutally honest on this subject. The show is not scary at all but the dramatic points and just the IDEA that this product has more to offer in an uncensored sense definitely makes me feel a bit uneasy considering what's in the censored version alone. I'd like to elaborate, but I'm sure I couldn't do that without spoilers.

As a whole, don't pass up on this series just because it's censored. If you're like me, you won't even notice it and the plot/character developments are well worth the purchase I made.

8599489,1,B00DZP1BTQ,"NOT A REVIEW OF THE SERIES. CASE BROKEN, OPENED, THEN RESEALED.

The case was damaged with bits of plastic falling out. It is clear the box was opened and the discs have fingerprints and smudges. Luckily the discs themselves appear to run fine. Im not sure if this was how it came from the manufacture, supplier, or at Amazon. Either way this is enough negligence for me to put this out as a warning for anyone buying this series in particular as this was the first time Ive encountered this level of damage to a Blu-ray case from an amazon delivery.

Sorry for bad pictures I did this quickly and mainly to focus on the risk this could have been much worse.",1529452800,,658,4.385245901639344

8599497,2,B00DZP1BTQ,"So I bought the unrated version last year at Acen and I have to say, why was this even originally released blurred and edited? There wasn't much violence and blood and there were I believe 1 pair of tits in the entire series. OK show but wasn't great.",1464134400,,251,4.25
8599498,5,B00DZP1BTQ,"Maybe I just didn't see it, or it's just a given, but it has both dub and sub. It's the first anime series I've wanted to own and I've got to say.. Getting it in 3 days on standard shipping definitely made me consider ordering more anime series this way. It's a great product and the series itself is all a matter of opinion, but I love it. The lister at under $30 is honestly a steal as I would have paid the $60 listing for this product. Take advantage!",1461542400,,455,4.066666666666666
