5710977,5,B00CB5ERCY,"DISC ONE

  tommy dreamer and joey styles talk about the old days in between matches. tommy has a pink tye.
  1-TOMMY DREAMER vs taz. I give this match 6 stars out of 10. it was really good. it was, however before all the blood and guts ECW  is known for.
  2-terry funk and arn Anderson vs bobby eaton and sabu. this match IS NOT  as it sounds a match from the 1980's.it's auditory was horrid but it was awesome ! 7 stars out of 10.
  3-cactus jack vs terry funk. don't get your hopes up. I know it sounds like a dream match but it is cut short, really short. plus, these guys have battled all around the world and their matches are always incredible. furthermore , this particular match  was NOT  unreleased. it was on a video called ""the worlds most violent matches"" and the real ECW  video ""best of cactus jack"". video. plus, its iconic result has been shown countless times on TV,ECW and WWE. 5 stars for baiting the fans with a match like this and for getting fans to pay money to see a dream match that didn't happen that way. 5 stars means  average or about as good as the stuff on RAW.
  4-tommy dreamer vs sandman
  this match could've been one of the greatest matches of all time and was definite selling point for me. the announcers talk all about the repeated canings of tommy dreamer prior to this but only show one shot. they mention a dreamer-sandman Singapore cane match but don't show it despite saying it was dreamers defining moment. the match was super but not as good as it should've been considering these 2 guys have an unbelievable threshold for pain. 7 stars.
  5-eddie guierro and the steiner brothers vs 2 cold scorpio, dean malenko and cactus jack. this was eddie guierro's ECW  debut.it was a lot of fun to watch. the action was great. 7 stars.
  6-raven vs tommy dreamer.
  this match was really good too. they mention that the winner gets to fight sandman several times during the match. they should've included that match as well. 7 stars. awesome !
  7-public enemy vs the gangstas
a 7 star match.it was the public enemies last match in ECW. they really put on a show.

that was the first disc. I was already very happy with my purchase. THERE WAS A LOT  of behind the scenes and inter promotional talk on it.
  DISC TWO

  1- taz vs chris Jericho
  bill alfonso and commissioner gordan were hand cuffed together outside of the ring. unfortunately,
about half of the camera action was focused on them at the expense of the match. the poorly taped match was over in about 1 minute.it was very not that big of a deal. 5 stars out of 10.
  2-2 cold scorpio vs shane douglas. the intro is very long. the match was very slow with both wrestlers taking frequent breaks. these breaks were very often after  less  then a minute of action. this went on for 26.5 minutes. i  give it 5 stars despite the fact that the action definitely picked up because the constant stopping was very annoying.
  3-sabu vs chris Jericho.
  this was the best match of the entire DVD  set. all of the matches should've been this good.im sure theres enough top notch material to use.i give it 8 stars. 8 stars = iconic and if its not it should be.
  where are the new jack vs Spanish angel match where they had their  iconic fall ? or the match where new jack cut a fan who stepped in for sabu ?
  4-6 man tag match. all of the ppl fighting in it have Japanese names. this was  one of the best matches on the entire DVD  too.these guys gave it everything they had ands left it all in the ring. 7 stars.
  5-eliminators vs the dudleys vs the gangstas.
  the eliminators are perry Saturn and john kronus. the dudleys were NOT bubba ray and devon but devon and their dad. I cant say his name here.the gangstas were new jack and Mustafa.it was very good. 6 stars.
  DISC 2  was really good. it go off to a slow start but was all worth it because of the sabu match.they mentioned sabu and sandmans wars leading up to the infamous ""stairway to heck"" match. they should've included one or more of those.

  DISC 3

  1-the sandman , taz, tommy dreamer and al snow vs sabu, RVD,  doug furenas and phillip lafon.they really get going in this one.but theres so much action to try to keep track off, it falls apart. there are often 4 2 man fights going on. really good for 6 stars.
  2-shane douglas vs al snow.
  there is a creepy interview with al snow before the match. the camera guy goes in and out with the zoom the whole time. it felt like I was in water. I will never watch it again. I wanted to puke. it was slow to start but picked up later. supposedly, shane douglas was wrestling with a broken arm and 2 more broken bones in his face. despite that shane Douglas's arm was an obvious target and the means for an easy win, al snow pretty much left it alone. the match did however, get good. I think it was al snows best match ever. 6 stars.
  3-RVD and sabu vs lance storm and chris candino.
  RVD and sabu can make any match awesome even if CC  is in it. and awesome it was ! 7 stars.
  4-bam bam biegelow vs sabu vs taz.
  taz's eye was heavily taped up but no one went after it not even once. there was hard hitting action all the way through. it would've gotten a 9 if it hadn't been for the disappointing ending. 8 stars. awesome plus !
  5-balls Mahoney and little spike Dudley vs the Dudley boys.
  hard hitting with a lot of action like every Dudley war. 7 stars. they mentioned that the winners battled raven and tommy dreamer. that match should've been on here.
  6-rhino vs mike awesome
  this was like to tanks playing bumper cars. it was over fast though but great while it lasted. 6 stars for being so fast on a match that could've been far better.
  7-tajiri vs super crazy vs jerry lynn
  this was fast and exiting. there was plenty of uninterrupted chain wrestling. spectacular ! 7 stars.
  8-RVD VS  mikey whipwreck
  RVD  is so awesome ! any match he's in is almost guaranteed to get a minimum of 7 stars no matter who he's facing. he can carry anybody. I never get tired of watching him invent new and interesting ways of kicking people in the head. 7 stars.
  9-justin credible vs jerry lynn vs steve corino
  it was fast and the announcers spend a lot of time talking about other matches. despite not liking ANY  of these 3, the match got a 7 because these paper champions really stepped it up.
  DISC  3 was really good. of course, that's because RVD  was there to make it awesomer !
  this video is well worth your money. just don't expect every single match to be a super match. unlike the old original ECW  videos that ECW  put out.all in all i'd say this is in the top 10 best wrestling videos EVER !",1375488000,,6630,4.282820097244732
5710978,4,B00CB5ERCY,"There really are some amazing matches in this set. It definitely does justice to what ECW was, which was a proving ground for some of the most amazing wrestlers to ever get into a ring. My only gripe is that WWE had to change the walk out music for most of the wrestlers. I remember The Sandman's epic entrance to ""Enter Sandman"" (with the entire crowd on their feet singing along), The Gangstas coming out to ""Natural Born Killa"", even The Steiner Brothers in their short stint in ECW used ""Welcome to the Jungle"". But I understand why they had to do it, and even why ECW has to switch themes for many of their roster: they didn't have rights to those songs. All in all, that's one small gripe, and someone who didn't watch ECW back in the day wouldn't even notice. I'd recommend this or any other of WWE's ECW releases if you want to get a taste of what ECW was all about.",1375401600,,874,4.271084337349397

5711001,5,B00CB5ERCY,"I cannot get enough of ECW. So happy that WWE decided to release another volume of incredible unreleased matches. This time, Joey Styles co-hosts with Tommy Dreamer. Their chemistry is really good and they do share a few interesting stories about the promotion. If you think ECW is only about ""hardcore"" matches, think again. True fans know it is not and if you are newer to it, these unreleased home video releases will show you that there are a wide range of match styles that the company took pride in. This set is very diverse in the match styles presented on the various selections: Puroresu, Lucha Libre, tag team, three ways dances, as well as some hardcore matches sprinkled here and there. I wish there was some more Eddie Guerrero or Dean Malenko matches included on this volume, but sadly there is not. Still an amazing set though.

5711010,4,B00CB5ERCY,"I was a huge fan of ECW (the Paul Hyman version) and this Blu-Rays gives you a ton of reasons why it was so good back in the day.  Aside from well thought out stories that had an eventual meaningful end, you had one of the greatest mixes of styles any promotion ever did.  In an ECW show you could see everything from a Lucha Libra match to a blood-filled death match followed by an out of this world wrestling match.  It was a great mix of storytelling and action.  A plus is all the talent that went though ECW over the years, such as Cactus Jack (Mick Foley), Terry Funk, Chris Jericho, Sabu, Dudley Boys, Eddy Guerrero, Public Enemy, Tazz, and so many others.  Perhaps the best part of this Blu-ray is the commentary and introductions by the one and only Joey Styles.

With the exception of Raven and RVD I can't name anyone else worth a damn who came from the bingo hall. And don't say Taz. That midget was overhyped, overrated and Paul E's boy. He wouldn't have made it anywhere but ECW. I borrowed this disaster of a blu ray from a misguided friend who is still waiting for ECW to come back and who thinks wrestling is a bunch of fat guys in jean shorts hitting each other with crap. I prefer classic wresting over the abortion Vince McMahon puts out nowadays and own many of these WWE releases but ECW sucked. It didn't go out of business by accident.

5711017,5,B00CB5ERCY,"With the high sales of the first volume, WWE quickly released Volume 2 of ECW Unreleased as Joey Styles returned to host this set with Tommy Dreamer joining him this time to co-host & also tell various stories throughout the presentation on such subjects such as why WCW talents appeared in ECW, new talents setting up when the established stars left, and various individual wrestlers such as the evolution of Steve Corino in ECW. Now it should be noted that just like how WWE advertised all of these matches as being previously unreleased by WWE (the Pioneer Home Video releases are irrelevant in their ""Universe"") on Volume 1, the same case applies here for Volume 2 in that only one match was previously released by WWE.

Tommy Dreamer vs. Tazmaniac - This was Tommy Dreamer's ECW debut & a completely different looking Dreamer than we've known today as he kept knocking Taz down with shoulder blocks & clotheslines while attempting to work over his arm for Taz to come back with suplexes & powerslams while delivering headbutts as both men traded momentum & went to the outside with both men changing chairshots & taking some hard hits. This was a good debut for Dreamer as despite having the ""pretty boy"" look at the time, we was getting a standing ovation for his effort afterwords.
""Hardcore TV"" Oct. '93

Terry Funk & Arn Anderson vs. Sabu & Bobby Eaton - This match was a unique setup (which Dreamer & Styles explained before the match) with both Eaton & Anderson being WCW contracted wrestlers for his match as Sabu & Funk started brawling with one knocking the other over the top rope through a table before Sabu started using a chair on the outside with Eaton joining in with the wild brawl continuing with Paul E. Dangerously getting involved & Funk delivering a piledriver on top of a piece of table before Anderson got into the mix using a chair himself as the fight between Funk & Eaton ended up going all the way to the ""Eagle's Nest"" area with Public Enemy making their presence known causing Funk to go crazy & hit anyone in sight with a chair including his partner. This was match was more unique than anything else as we're used to seeing Funk & Sabu in this type of hardcore war environment but not Anderson & Eaton which made this very appealing.
""When Worlds Collide"" May '94

Cactus Jack vs. Terry Funk - Both men started brawling on the outside & into the crowd before heading back into the ring where Cactus caught his head in between the ropes the same way that caused him to lose his ear against Vader as Funk pounded on it but this match was more significant for who decided to get involved in the match causing Cactus & Terry to team up & get the fans help leading to one of the most infamous scenes in ECW history to the point where it was still used on the opening credits for the year years after both men had already left the promotion.
""Hardcore Heaven"" Aug. '94

""I Quit"" Match: Tommy Dreamer vs. Sandman - Dreamer came into this match showcasing his future ""Innovator Or Violence"" ways as he had control of the match using a car fender in the ring along with a crutch & chair on the outside while Sandman resorted to actual wrestling holds such as the crossface chicken wing & top rope elbows before both men would exchange piledrivers against each other before Sandman would start his celebration early & ended up paying for it to the point where even Dreamer couldn't have believed what he did. This was a unique match as both men switched roles with Sandman doing more of the wrestling & Dreamer using more of the hardcore weapons.
""Hardcore TV"" Oct. '94

Eddie Guerrero & Steiner Brothers vs. 2 Cold Scorpio, Dean Malenko, Cactus Jack - The Steiner's ECW Arena debut with Taz in their corner wearing a brace due to his neck injury as Scott & Malenko started off doing some grounded amateur wrestling with Scott starting to resort to more power moves with Malekno responding suplexing Scott to the outside as the match started to pick up pace from where as we got wrestling faceoffs with Scorpio against Guerrero & Rick while Rick traded fist on the outside with Cactus at one point with the Steiners heavily relying on various suplexes such as the belly to belly from the top rope & double underhook plus some triple teaming moves by picking up each member of the opposite team for Guerrero to deliver a move from the top rope resulting in what was definitely a fun six man tag.
""Wrestlepalooza"" Aug. '95

Raven vs. Tommy Dreamer - The winner of this match would get a title match against ECW Champion Sandman later that night but things started out with Stevie Richards & Blue Meanie attempting to distract Dreamer allowing Raven to attack from behind whipping Dreamer into the guardrails & putting himself through Dreamer & a table only for Tommy to start giving multiple DDT's to anyone in sight while also using weapons like a chair & cheese grader along with other weapons the fans would have him as both men were bleeding & fighting through the crowd before making it's way back to the ring with Raven's associates doing whatever they could to help out Raven in the process. This was the out of the control brawl that this feud had the reputation of.
""Holiday Hell"" Dec. '95

Public Enemy vs. Gangstas - This match started out real violent was Johnny Grunge was bleeding in the opening seconds thanks to New Jack before Rocco Rock responded hitting him with a pie of all things & making Mustafa bleed while Grunge got his receipt on New Jack as this brawl started implementing more weapons like a cheese grader & cookie sheet & chair along with a bodies going through a table with the fight going into the front row & through the crowd before coming back into the ring with them using whatever they could get their hands on such as a frying pan & loaf of bread. This was the final match for the first major act from ECW in Public Enemy before they headed to WCW & was the type of brawl that put them on the map in ECW as it was an out of control brawl that had some comedic elements but still hardcore.
""House Party"" Jan. '96
[Bloodsport: ECW's Most Violent Matches]

Chris Jericho vs. Taz - This match was advertised as a MMA-style ""shoot fight"" where the only way you could win was by submission & knockout along with a special referee with a background in martial arts while Bill Alfonzo was handcuffed to Tod Gordon at ringside. Both men worked a submission style with Taz using a freestyle bow & arrow while Jericho went for a fujiara armbar before a member of Team Taz (Chris Chetti) got involved cuffing Alfonzo & getting involved allowing the Tazmission to get applied with the referee calling for the bell. This was more of an angle as the match itself didn't go long with more focus going on what happened between Alfozno & Gordon along with a third party before, during, and after the match.
Apr. '96

ECW Television Champion 2 Cold Scropio vs. Shane Douglas - This was a unique championship match as Douglas was fighting for a title that he openly stated didn't want or cared about which made Scorpio feel disrespected as both men showed disrespect between each other in the early moments using both the title & a WWF shirt. Scorpio started out working over the arm with various armbars & wrenches only for Douglas to be able to keep countering him to the point where Scorpio got frustrated & started throwing charis into the ring which ended up coming back to haunt him as Douglas launched one of those chairs in Scorpio's face & launched Scorpio into the front row on top of a fan as both men brawled through the crowd with Scorpio using whatever he could get his hands on such as a crutch & chair while Douglas gave Scorpio such an impactful powerbomb on the floor that you saw his eyes roll into the back of his head. They made their way back into the ring where Scorpio used some dirty tactics & a chair while also performing some unique offense that not even Joey Styles knew how to call along with one impactful finisher after another but kept showing the he was more concerned with getting his respect than getting a win causing Douglas to deliver some high impact offense of his own. This was a highly competitive match that went very close to the 30 minute time limit with neither man letting up at one point the entire time.
""A Matter Of Respect"" May '96

Sabu vs. Chris Jericho - According to Joey Styles, this was their first ever meeting against each other & is also the first time that WWE has released ""fan cam"" footage (not professionally shot but with a amateur camcorder). Both men started out grounding each other early with different takedowns & each man attempting to work over the other's leg with moves like the leglock & spinning toe hold before Sabu went to his daredevil offense with a triple jump dive to the outside only for Jericho to top that with a slingshot springboard splash to the outside before making their way back to the ring where each man would start to go extreme from a top rope frankensteiner & powerbomb to a lionsault onto a chair & Sabu using a table as a diving board onto Jericho in the crowd. Both men were evenly matched throughout the entire contest in regards to grounded wrestling & aerial offense to even using weapons to the point where they & the audience showed mutual respect towards both men.

Gran Hamada, Gran Naniwa & Great Sasuke vs. Dick Togo, Terry Boy, Taka Michinoku - The match started off very fast paced & never slowed down as both teams showed a mix of lucha libre & japanese style wrestling such as high flying moves such as moonsaults in & out of the ring and launching themselves out the ring into the isleway while Togo & Hamada showcased their power advantage along with Taka's team resorting to many double & triple teaming including doing a triple powerbomb while trying to take the mask off their opponents at various times. This was set to be a preview of their later Barely Legal PPV match & it was just that as both teams went non-stop from bell to bell.

ECW Tag Team Champions Eliminators vs. Gangstas vs. Dudley Boyz - Buh-Buh Ray had broken his ankle during the match at Barely Legal causing Big D. to be D-Von's tag partner in this match as it started off as a one on one match with Eliminators with Saturn being able to take down Big D. with various head scissors before Buh-Buh got involved to give them the numbers advantage which worked as Saturn was chokeslammed onto of Kronis through a table. The Gangstas got involved with their trash which turned this into a non-stop brawl with some weapons from a guitar & mailbox & VCR to a stop sign & umbrella & crochet mallet causing many men to bleed while Saturn was still focused on Bubba with an aerial assault & brawling in the crowd as fans were throwing in their own weapons into the ring. This was one of those out of control brawls that you normally get whenever these teams face off against each other.
""The Buffalo Invasion"" May '97

Sandman, Taz, Tommy Dreamer, Al Snow vs. Sabu, Rob Van Dam, Doug Furnas, Philip LaFon - This was a unique situation as it was WWE vs. ECW in faction warfare that was just a non-stop brawl both in & out of the ring that saw various highlights such as what Dreamer did to keep RVD from escaping the tree of woe, Sabu's dive into the front row, someone going through a table, the effect Sabu's chairshots had on Taz, the appearance of another man who Taz had his issues with that led to the locker room emptying, and the managers themselves fighting against each other. As I stated, this was just a non-stop action brawl.

ECW Champion Shane Douglas vs. Al Snow - Shane Douglas was coming into this match with multiple injuries along with the fact that he was attacked by Taz & bleeding from the mouth earlier in the night but still opted to wrestle without his arm brace allowing Snow to heavily work over his arm causing Francine to get involved whenever Snow was starting to get an advantage which Douglas took advantage of dropping Snow on the guardrail & taking a high risk dive into the front row that had him land on his bad elbow followed by a powerbomb onto open chairs as both men traded momentum including kicking out of the other's signature moves while the locker room surrounded the ring to ensure the Triple Threat didn't get involved. This was a good wrestling match between two of the purest veteran wrestlers ECW had on it's roster that that time.
Wrestlepalooza '98

ECW Tag Team Champions Chris Candido & Lance Storm vs. Sabu & Rob Van Dam - Candido & Storm were on the same page for the first time in few months due to mutual enemies in RVD & Sabu as both teams were working together with double teaming holds such as a flapjack, bow & arrow with a chair to the ribs from the top rope, and the Doomsday Device along with a series of one man hitting a move only for his other opponent to come right back with another move such as RVD's corkscrew legdrop onto Storm on the guardrail followed by Candido with an over the top dive with Sabu coming right behind with a triple jump dive onto Candido in the front row with the match getting more intense with people getting put through tables either by the other team or crashing through the table themselves. This was both an athletic & competitive tag match between all four men.

FTW Champion Taz vs. Sabu vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - This originally started out as Taz vs. Sabu in a big brawl that went through the crowd only for Bigelow to get involved attacking both men turning this into a triple threat that saw all three men interact with each other various times such as Taz suplexing Sabu over the top onto Bigelow, Bigelow yanking Sabu over the top rope through Taz & a table, Sabu & Bigelow throwing Taz through a table, Taz kicking Bigelow through a table followed by a lariat to Sabu that hurt his own arm, Sabu's triple jump onto both men, Taz's back to back suplexes, both men trying to put Sabu through a table that just wouldn't break, one man delivering a move only for the other man to hit him with the same move, one man had a submission only to have the third man apply one onto him, and everyone taking chairshots. I can't describe this match better than what Joey Styles said, ""Let's not call it a wrestling match but that was one of the greatest fights I've ever called"" as all three men literally beat each other into exhaustion.
""Hardcore TV"" Aug. '98

Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Balls Mahoney & Spike Dudley - This was from the first ""ECW On TNN"" taping that never aired (another story for another time) with Balls & Spike carrying a chair & ladder to the ring as this started off as a 4 way fist fight with Balls & Spike getting the upper hand with Balls doing a top rope dive onto the Dudleys followed by Spike coming off a ladder as a cheese grader was introduced into the match causing Spike to bleed with Bubba wearing it as war paint while D-Von used it on Balls only for Spike to fight back using a chair & guardrail to his advantage with the fight spilling out into the crowd all the way to the concession stands & back to ringside where not only Sign Guy Dudley got involved but a double stack of tables were set on fire. This was the bloody extreme brawl that you would expect from these two teams against each other.

ECW Champion Mike Awesome vs. Rhino - Awesome showcased his crusierweight ablitity for a giant early with a slingshot back elbow & a dive over the top rope & top rope clothesline while Rhino used his power for holds like a spinebuster & gore in the corner while going aerial himself with a diving headbutt only for Awesome to come back with one hell of an Awesome Bomb through a table & impactful frog splash. This match didn't go long & Rhino was still in his ""Rookie Monster"" year in ECW but this was good for what it was with both men being very similar in structure & ability.

Super Crazy vs. Jerry Lynn vs. Yoshihiro Tajiri - Jerry Lynn came into this match with his ribs taped from a previous attack by Tajiri & his associates Steve Corino & Jack Victory as this match had various interactions between all three men such as Tajiri flipping Crazy onto the top rope who came off with a crossbody onto Lynn only for Lynn to later flip Crazy into dropkicking Tajiri, Lynn & Super Crazy with head scissor & armdrag takedowns, Tajiri's moonsault onto both men on the outside , a 3 way fight through the crowd that saw Crazy deliever one insane moonsault, Tajiri in a surfboard by Crazy only to be bulldogged by Lynn, and Lynn's cradle piledriver on Crazy followed by Tajiri's baseball slide dropkick to Lynn. This match started off past paced & never let up once with tons of wrestling & interaction between all three men.

ECW Television Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Mikey Whipwreck - RVD spend too much time for Mikey's taste playing to the crowd causing Mikey to go after him during his entrance taking the match to the floor giving a leg sweep into the guardrail & frankensteiner on the floor but RVD retaliated using his educated feet with various kicks & surfing the chair into the corner followed by rolling thunder before a chair was used to both men's advantage for either a german suplex, pedigree, or the Van Daminator in what resulted in a competitive match.

ECW Champion Justin Credible vs. Jerry Lynn vs. Steve Corino - This started off hot with Credible being backdropped onto Corino before Lynn dove onto both men but Credible came back with a reverse DDT & repeating driving Lynn's head into a chair while Corino knocked Credible into the guardrail & baseball side into a chair with Lynn using a chair himself using the chair for a top rope dropkick & a leaping clothesline onto both men in the front row. Things started to get more extreme from here with all 3 men bleeding & Credible using the singapore cane including one moment where he repeating caned Corino who was tied to the top rope while so many other issues happened such as Francine's involvement causing someone else out to even the odds while the referees themselves were having issues with each other resulting in a good 3 way dance.

(Blu-Ray) 911 vs. Doink the Clown - This was pretty much more of a segment than anything else as it was about 911 showing that ECW wasn't the sports entertainment you see elsewhere as he did what the crowd was begging him to do, ""KILL THE CLOWN!""
""Hardcore TV"" Aug. '94

(Blu-Ray) Steel Cage Match: Public Enemy & Mikey Whipwreck vs. Sandman, 2 Cold Scorpio, New Jack - You saw Mikey Whipwreck like how you've never seen him before coming into this match as he was transformed in a member of Public Enemy for the night from his hoodie clothes to even having a Rocco Rock hairstyle as this match saw everyone rammed into the cage at some point in time resulting in many of the participants bleeding, Woman poking though the cage with the singapore cane, New Jack & Johnny Grunge fighting outside the cage & through the crowd, Sandman suplexing tables including one time off the top rope, three stacked tables inside of the cage, Mikey coming off the top of the cage on more than one occasion, and a wild post-match brawl that even saw the security get nailed. This was just a wild six way brawl from start to finish.
""Gangsta's Paradise"" Sept. '95

(Blu-Ray) ECW Champion Terry Funk vs. Raven vs. Stevie Richards vs. Sandman - Raven kicked this match off going after Sandman during his entrance leading to all four men brawling on the outside with Funk & Raven going through the crowd while Sandman & Stevie were at ringside with Sandman dropping guillotine legdrops from various spots onto Stevie before everyone was in the ring & Raven tried to reform his old alliance with Stevie by barking orders like how he used to with Stevie reacting differently than he did years before with Sandman & Funk then forming an alliance together to work over Stevie's neck including Sandman bringing a guardrail in the ring that would have a dangerous effect on more than one person involved in the match. This was a good four way dance that told various stories but unfortunately is mostly remembered for giving Stevie Richards his neck injury that not only left him paralyzed in the ring afterwords (which they didn't show) but would also heavily effect his wrestling career for the next few years.
""The Buffalo Invasion"" May '97

(Blu-Ray) Public Enemy vs. Dudley Boyz - After leaving ECW for 3 years in WCW, Public Enemy returned to ECW but had a mixed reaction from the fans & a confrontation with Joel Gertner & Sign Guy Dudley allowing the Dudleys to attack from behind & beat down P.E. with chairshots & trash cans to the head & body causing them to bleed before an old enemy of P.E. & current adversary of the Dudleys made an appearance. This wasn't much past the original extreme tag team of ECW in Public Enemy getting beat down & left laying by the new extreme tag team of the Dudleys.

(Blu-Ray) Street Fight Match: Tommy Dreamer vs. Lance Storm - Tommy Dreamer made it clear for weeks that it was his intention to piledrive ""Beulah"" (Dawn Marie) & she was so sure it wasn't going to happen that she claimed she wasn't going to panties only for Lance to make her put on a pair before coming to the ring while Dreamer showed up with a surprise with Francine in his corner. Both men started fighting on the ramp & around ringside with Dreamer giving the first major with with a trash can lid stopping a sunset flip attempt but Storm fought fire with fire using a guardrail to crotch Dreamer on it & launching Dreamer onto an open chair before working over Dreamer's cut eye with with a belt but Dreamer was still being the ""Innovator Of Violence"" by backdropping Storm over the top rope through a table & giving a stunner using a chair to the throat along with bring a ladder into play taking advantage Storm's head caught between the steps while we also had outside parties getting involved including one moment that made Joey Styles go, ""He comes to the broadcast booth & gets Francine to sit on his face...I WANT HIS AGENT!"" Lance Storm is always known as a great technical wrestler but he was able to adapt to Dreamer's hardcore style here resulting in a very good street fight to the point where one person wasn't able to walk away from the fight.

(Blu-Ray) Japanese Death Match: Super Crazy vs. Yoshihiro Tajiri - Crazy sprinted straight to the ring catching Tajiri with a top rope dropkick right from the start as Tajiri attempted to take out Crazy's vertical base by delivering a dropkick to the knee & backdropping him into the front row while showing more aggression than before by kicking the back of an open chair into Crazy's face & a baseball slide into 3 chairs with Crazy trapped in the tree of woe causing him to bleed followed by Tajiri biting & spitting out the blood but Crazy kept fighting with impactful offense such as a snap powerbomb & top rope legdrop through a outside table & later a top rope moonsault through a table only for Tajiri to return it right back with a brainbuster & a reverse DDT onto a chair. These two men always have non-stop intense encounters but this was the most violent I've seen them get to the point where the finish was something that Joey Styles had never seen in his entire ECW career...and that's saying something.
""Hardcore TV"" Feb. '00

Well this set wasn't perfect as some matches didn't have any value to them past the name recognition (Taz/Jericho) but the good heavily outweighs the bad as we had some dream matches that I never knew existed (Sabu/Jericho) along with giving us more matches that were harder to find (only two also released on the Pioneer Home Video collections & only 3 matches from PPV's) when compared to Volume One so this is a collection I highly recommend to ECW fans as you had a mix of everything from great wrestling to extreme hardcore violence.",1375920000,7,24084,4.512603116406966

My only gripe is, why censor the language? Especially when it has a parental advisory sticker on the package? ECW is meant to be TV-MA & should be left that way, but then again, Raw should be TV-14 & left that way.

There are still some old matches on here, but they are all good and fast paced with some chair shots here and there, but mainly the quality of matches is better, mainly hardcore. The picture is good as usual, the sound is good too, but I'm still annoyed that the wrestlers theme music is not the same as the original entrances. Overall a very good sequel, can't wait for volume 3 to come out.",1423526400,,545,4.46
