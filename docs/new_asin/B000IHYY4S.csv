2656881,5,B000IHYY4S,"I've been to many of these places digitally filmed, and they look amazing in HD-DVD. Shot in full 1080p, it's like looking through a window, and will show off what your HDTV can (or should, with the correct settings) look like.
This one will be played from time to time, especially in winter. Worth the price.
If you enjoy scenery, nature, and those nature sounds with music you can pick up at any Target store, this is a good choice for you.
Play it in the background when you're doing chores around the house, if it's been cloudy forever, or the you've had a rough day.
This one let's you relax...",1201046400,4,599,4.405405405405405
2656882,2,B000IHYY4S,"WHile this disc doesn't cost much, you don't get that much. Video quality is OK, but Blu-Ray deserves better. I bought this item because I was eager to get some high quality material to show off my Blu-Ray system. Unfortunately this is not it! Probably will never watch it through. Ah well!",1197936000,15,290,4.596153846153846
2656883,2,B000IHYY4S,"I got this HD DVD, the picture is clear due to HD DVD, but the content is not what I expect. Moving picture is not ""moving"", the camera just stayed in one place and did not move when taking moving picture. I do not like this style.",1191888000,2,231,3.9361702127659575

8145510,1,B000IHYY4S,"Imagine being roped to a tree, unable to move, with your eyelids clawed open like those of the tortured kid in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  OK, this is meant to be like those animated fake fire places.  You watch only between sips of Christmas punch.  But do not think it is like a Travelogue.  You see a nearly dead scene so long that you begin to think your mind has frozen.  You begin praying that another Meteor Crater will form or volcano erupt.  Please let the camera battery die so that the cinematographer will have to move again!  Please allow an illegal alien to crawl through the majestic vista.  Let a rattler slither toward the camera and out The Fourth Wall and bite me out of my misery!  Let an Indian shoot me for trespassing.  Just let my people go.  HD was never so Advanced in the Art of Numbing.  I take the disc out and put it back in: my Smart TV asks if I want to resume Play.  I must be in The Twilight Zone.",1424995200,,924,4.181818181818182
8145511,3,B000IHYY4S,"Interesting, but could be so much more with greater visual effort.  Informational, but not inspiring.  I would describe is as sort of ""going through the motions"".",1387324800,,162,5.1923076923076925
8145512,4,B000IHYY4S,"This is beautiful south-western scenery.  The colors are vivid, and relaxing.  This was a good demo for a 50"" Plasma I bought for my parents.  In many ways, the quality of the footage looks clearer than ""Blue Planet"" does.  Most of the scenes are well composed.  Most look professional, but a few minutes seem semi-pro. If you can get it at a good price, It's a great bit of footage to doze to.",1291593600,,394,4.342465753424658
8145513,3,B000IHYY4S,Video pictures are good by the music is real anoying and sometime they stay on a scene too long,1287273600,,95,4.052631578947368
8145514,5,B000IHYY4S,"This video is basically designed to be a relaxing visual to represent what you would see if you were sitting and staring out over the vista. There is little movement nor should there be. If you are sitting and looking this is what you will see. It is great to put on a screen to relax people, which is what I do in my medical office.",1272844800,,333,4.0606060606060606
8145515,5,B000IHYY4S,"Great compositional variety of the scenic southwest.  Don't know about the music because I always mute it on these as it is typically new age electronica.  But I love reading with it playing in the background.  Great in the summer, virtual vacation without the expense.  And after viewing these landscape movies, I always feel refreshed as if I had taken an actual vacation.",1264377600,,374,4.888888888888889
8145516,2,B000IHYY4S,"Technically, the visuals and audio are excellent. Content, however, is a disappointment. It is a collection of stills advancing much too slowly. Many, many attractive sites in the Southwest are simply not included.",1252713600,6,214,5.515151515151516
8145517,5,B000IHYY4S,"When I was preparing to take my wife to visit the Southwest for the first time, I used this Blu-ray video to give her a feel to what the country really looks like.  As a result I think she developed a better understanding of what it is like to live in this part of the country.  For someone from the east it is really hard to picture truly open spaces and vistas that only the southwest can offer.  This video does a wonderful job of presenting this detail.",1242172800,,457,4.170454545454546
8145518,2,B000IHYY4S,"Ok, talk about truth in advertising...this is literally like a window on the landscape.  Other dvd's of this type that I have owned featured movement and/or time lapse photography to make it both visually interesting and still convey some type of ""action"".  This DVD put me to sleep.  It's like a slide show of vacation photographs. It that's what you want, fine, but in my mind, there other better choices out there to bring back memories of trips to region.  They must have taken a camera, mounted it on a tripod, stuck it up in places and shot a few minutes of film and moved on.  I gave it two stars because it is beautiful, but not for me.",1207267200,2,644,4.378151260504202
