8175089,5,B000N63HW4,"This is an excellent film, especially for viewers NEW to Italian film. For young men, this is a perfect introduction to the films of Italy. The protagonist, Tanino, is a typical young man, not unlike young men all over the world. His adventures are due as much to his vulnerability as they are to the nefarious people who surround him. The film never falters or even slows down. ""My Name is Tanino"" is funny and action-packed. I cannot wait until it is readily available to everyone.",1264464000,5,483,4.627906976744186
