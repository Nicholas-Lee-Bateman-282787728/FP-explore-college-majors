7749700,5,B01FCBO5EI,"This film covers in detail the time, effort, resources, and people necessary to save one of the most iconic movie cars of all time that almost rotted away to nothing. It chronicles the journey perfectly from screen, to theme park attraction, to relic, to museum piece once more. This documentary delivers drama and comedy while being incredibly informative about the car's history.

Absolutely worth every dollar! The bonus features are incredibly entertaining.",1468281600,5,461,5.402777777777778
7749701,5,B01FCBO5EI,"As a documentary fan, and a Back to the Future Fan (albeit - not ""super fan""), I found this documentary fun, engaging, and entertaining.  Admittedly, I did not know ANYTHING about the Delorean prior to watching this doc; however, I learned so much about the car's history and gained a profound appreciation for what the Restoration Team accomplished.  This movie will make you fall in love for that beautiful car all over again!",1468281600,,428,4.8493150684931505
7749702,5,B01FCBO5EI,"This film actually shows what can be done when you get the right people for the right job.  After Universal let their most recognizable asset next to Frankenstien rot on their backlot for 30 years they actually green lit a restoration on the world's most famous movie car.  Instead of letting someone's relative get the job, something that still happens in tinsel town to this day, they actually awarded the gig to artists who knew what they were doing.  This shows what can be accomplished when a team is brought together without Hollywood politics.  Even the filmmaker's documenting the process were the right people who were insterested in truth.

 This noble film documents the once in a lifetime look at the blood and sweat required to bring back the only surviving DeLorean Time Machine from Back to the Future.  Perhaps after seeing this film it will inspire other studios to rethink their Archives departments and to not simply turn over their treasures to employees who simply get their high ranking job because they have kept their heads down, and who have ""yes manned"" to get their jobs.  there are no yes men or yes women in this project.  This is the way things are done at Disney and other studios, nobody has any expertise and they go outside their companies to get things done, while the archives staff takes the credit. Well Universal should be awarded as they did it right this time and prove that the only way to get something done right is to have the right people for the right job.  From the restoration team to this film's director.",1468281600,5,1555,4.6838235294117645

7749710,5,B01FCBO5EI,"That was hugely enjoyable to watch. Nothing felt incorrectly paced, under or over explained, or ""OUTAPLACE"" (haha, sorry).

I've never seen the car myself in-person, so to see it reborn from the guts was fantastic. The closest I ever got was when I lived in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and going to a meet up of owners. I do really like that they restored to the original movie (part 1) spec as well, totally the right decision.

Sad to see how it was neglected for so long. Happy it's now loved and looks so amazing!",1522800000,,516,4.4787234042553195

For any Back to the Future fan or DeLorean lover, this is awesome to watch all these guys rebuild a great piece of history. I'm not a car guy at all and I would have loved to be in the shop helping sweep the floor just to be around these talented and skillful masters.

It is determined that it can no longer be shown so a group of unpaid volunteers spend a year of part-time work refurbishing it first of all as a vehicle and then as a movie prop.

This documentary you SHOULD see is a testament to that feeling we all felt shared among a team of professionals that rescued the only remaining Delorean from Universal Studios to restore it to 100% screen and original production authenticity all sanctioned by BTTF producer Bob Gale.

The team, all volunteers, share their own personal experiences before, during, and after the outstanding finished product as well as recounting the history.

The project was a real labour of love for the fans involved in the restoration. The story of how it was brought back to life from a horrifying neglect by the studio and destructive so-called fans who stripped the car for souvenirs is a fascinating one. The dedication to detail by Joe Walser and his team on the car and the drama involved in hitting the deadline is amazing to see.

7749736,5,B01FCBO5EI,"If you loved this movie trilogy, you'll definitely appreciate this film.  This is what should happen to every iconic car in Hollywood.  It takes you basically step by step in the restoration process.  The actor that played Doc Brown at the theme park is a joy to watch perform.  He is a dead ringer as far as the performing his voice.  It was amazing to see the lengths they went to to see them aquire the missing pieces.  This is a must have for your BTTF collection.",1482796800,,468,4.32183908045977
7749737,2,B01FCBO5EI,"Outatime is a decent documentary about back to the future time machine. The film  lacks depth and seems to skip over a large portion of the restoration to focus more on the people restoring the Delorean time machine, than the car itself.",1482019200,,237,4.642857142857143

Outatime documents the restoration of one of Hollywood's most famous picture cars - the Back To The Future DeLorean which had fallen into a sad state of decay by being left exposed to the elements on the back lot of Universal Studios. Hopefully the studios will consider saving more of their picture cars in the future as they are a vital part of cinema history. Amazing and well worth your time to see the efforts that were gone to in order to save a piece of Hollywood history. Your Back To The Future collection isn't complete without this great documentary.

7749746,5,B01FCBO5EI,"If you love Back to the Future, and love the DeLorean Time Machine, this is a MUST SEE! It is an amazing story to see how this iconic movie car was abused over the years, then brought back to its original splendor by the efforts of Universal, Bob Gale, and a team of FAN Time Machine experts. Restoring the most famous movie car in history was no small feat... Many parts and pieces were stolen over the years, 25 years of being outside in the California sun and weather, and the obscurity of some of the military surplus pieces that made up the Time Machine made this a monumental task.

The story is beautifully told by filmmaker Steve Concotelli. And its also packed with great extras and scenes. I've watched it 3 times now and just like Back to the Future, its just as good or better every time I watch it!",1474070400,,811,4.3355263157894735

Really sad how the car was in such disarray before the Restoration Team got ahold of it. It was painstakingly tore down piece by piece and meticulously restored passionately to the level that is only found within superfans. Not only did they restore a car to show condition, as one would expect on a show like this, but at the same time they were restoring a movie prop with unbelievable accuracy.

The beauty of the movie is that it ties together everything that makes the DeLorean time machine such a compelling story: the devoted time machine restoration team, Bob Gale, the fans, the back story of the car, and even the some of the technical mechanics of rebuilding a prop car.

I highly recommend any Back to the Future fan watch this movie (which is basically everyone who has ever seen Back to the Future). Not only will you learn something new, but you will really enjoy it, too.",1469836800,,834,4.509933774834437

To see this stunning ol' gal go from movie-to-display-to-out the back for whoever wants a pic or a part-to-ready for the scrap heap-to-absolute stunning beauty! The attention to detail is beyond perfection. The angle/type of bolts and screws, positioning of all attached parts, the Kovacs Curl in the wiring harness at the drivers door, the pioneer speaker grilleat the back of the Worm Hole Generator! The entire team have achieved what most would say is unachievable! This doco and extras are long enough to show what was required without dragging on (but I personally could sit through 15hrs or more of watching these guys and gals work their magic!)

7749761,5,B01FCBO5EI,"Amazing new documentary about the DeLorean time machine. I have been a huge fan of the Back to the Future films since the early 90s and I'm thrilled that the preservation and restoration of the ""A""-car is so well-documented in this film. It is indeed quite a story. I remember seeing the car on the Universal studio tour some years back, thinking to myself that it's a shame that fans only get to see it for the few seconds it takes to drive by, and a shame that it wasn't getting more attention. While it didn't look pristine by any means, I was shocked to learn via the documentary that it was in such poor shape. It's amazing that Bob Gale was made aware of this, and that he ultimately started the process that would lead to this incredible restoration.

It's really fun to see how the team went about getting the car back into prime condition. The level of detail and care they went into was astonishing. I also enjoyed the segments about how the fans who had stolen parts off it over the years actually returned some of the crucial elements, such as the Flux Capacitor.  The only thing I didn't get an answer to - or maybe I missed it: does the restored car actually drive??

Overall a great film!",1469664000,,1203,4.385650224215246

The work and love that the restoration team put into this project is dedication at its best.
I am now not only a huge fan of the franchise, and the Delorean but of the restoration team too.

7749764,5,B01FCBO5EI,"A superb film by Steve Concotelli that details the important restoration process of the ""A Car"" DeLorean, the main one used in all three films and the only one (of three) that survived the test of time.  As a huge BTTF fan for over 30 years, I immediately connected with the group of guys who were tapped to restore the DeLorean.  The BTTF experiences and anecdotes they shared in the film were powerful, and I enjoyed every minute of it.  This movie and the special features that are included are well-worth the price.  Buy this today...you will not be disappointed.",1469059200,,567,4.64

This is just a really fun movie that keeps you entertained, and laughing, and also kinda on the edge of your seat as you sit there thinking, ""Are they gonna finish it in time?"" Totally loved this!",1468972800,,339,4.151515151515151

Luckily we have all these things and being a huge Back to the Future fan I couldn't be happier! Sit back and enjoy the journey as this documentary does not disappoint. The presentation is great.

In the span of 63 minutes you're able to have a front-row seat into the journey of restoring the most notorious movie car ever known. The documentary does an excellent job of providing information about the A Car, as well as providing you with an in-depth look into the restoration journey. You're able to learn about the rare parts, pieces, and cool secrets about the time machine. You're able to see the A Car in a way that has never before been seen. This documentary does a stellar job at conveying just how much of a labor of love the restoration was. It's an amazing story, and Steve Concotelli did a brilliant job chronicling the restoration from beginning to end.

OUTATIME is the documentary the DeLorean time machine deserves.",1468800000,2,799,4.7898550724637685

Preserving a piece of our entertainment history for generations to come seems like a small thing , its not. This film captures the process and the heart well.",1468800000,,300,4.189655172413793
7749772,5,B01FCBO5EI,"I think we all can agree that aside from Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, the time machine is THE main character of the entire trilogy. It's the centerpiece of the story line and the greatest looking car to ever exist (this MIGHT be an opinion, but i'm fairly certain it's fact). Before this documentary, I had no idea of the poor condition the time machine was in prior to the restoration (to be fair, I didn't know there was a restoration happening until AFTER it was already done). There was no upkeep, no preservation. It takes a real hero to save a hero (car), and the Time Machine Restoration team are definitely heroes. It's funny, it's moving, and a must-see for any back to the future and Delorean fan out there. I would give it more stars if I could.",1468800000,,765,4.432624113475177

The ""A"" car restoration was necessary in making sure we keep a piece of pop-culture history intact for decades to come. This film and its amazing extras make you fall in love with Doc's Time Machine all over again. I've been a hard-core fan for decades, and I'm happy to say that this film let me in on some additional BTTF trivia that I didn't know about and that I do not think had ever been discussed before. Thank you Steve for putting together this great film, and thank you Restoration Team for keeping my childhood dream alive.",1468800000,,771,4.436619718309859

It's a really interesting look at the DeLorean time machine, the history of it and the process of saving it. Despite being a MASSIVE BttF fan, there was a lot I didn't know about the car itself and I really enjoyed the history of it and how it came to be in such a sad state. It was really cool going through the process of the restoration and the finished product looks amazing. I can only hope someday I can get out to California to see it in person! ;)

This is a great documentary for BttF fans as well as for fans of movie props and history. Very high production values and nicely put together.",1468627200,3,716,4.226277372262774

And also the filmmakers also worked tirelessly to capture the efforts. It's amazing to see how selfless this team was to volunteer their time and take so much care to honor the history of this amazing movie.

It's true what they say, this DeLorean Time machine is one of the most important cars in cinema history and to see the state it was in was tough - especially if you're a fan of the movies. But the restoration team paid extremely close attention to all the details of the car and restored its 1985 condition - maybe even better!

The movie is packed with great interviews from people who were there, including the original designer/builder of the time machine. Not only is this a great car restoration movie, you get a really cool glimpse into filmmaking and how props are really put together. Although it's a bit liking looking behind the curtain and seeing that the car isn't REALLY a time machine, when we see the final product, all faith is restored that when that baby hits 88 miles an hour, we're gonna see some serious s.................!",1468627200,2,1197,4.615023474178404

The car was stripped completely back to the chasis before being rebuilt to a stock Delorean and then painstakingly restored back to the time machine as seen in the film. The detail is and effort involved is unbelievable.

Like a lot of kids in the 80s, I fell in love with the Delorean after seeing Back to the Future and I remember going on the ride and seeing the car at Universal Studios back in the mid 90s and then again on the back lot a few years ago and was heartbroken at the condition it was in.
