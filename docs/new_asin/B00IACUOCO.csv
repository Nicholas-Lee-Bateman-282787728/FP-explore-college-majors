6255530,4,B00IACUOCO,"In the Northern mountains of Laos, a young villager gives birth. Unfortunately, she gives birth to not just one but two boys, and according to local tradition, it is a bad omen to give birth to twins. The second is stillborn, suggesting the first one is cursed with bad luck, and their custom dictates that they should abandon him at birth; but the mother begs her mother-in-law, who is also something of a shaman and midwife, to allow her to keep him. Subsequent circumstances suggest he is indeed cursed, and that he will be the source of endless bad luck to the family, but the boy, Ahlo, means to prove himself, to show his family that he is not cursed, and will risk his life to do it.

The Rocket is the first fiction feature film by Australian director Kim Mordaunt, who had previously made several acclaimed documentary films with his producer and partner Sylvia Wilczynski. They are sorry they can't be here, as they are currently researching for another film. The film won the audience award for World Cinema at AFI Fest, was awarded the Best Narrative Feature and the Audience Award at Tribeca, and the young lead, Sitthiphone Disamoe won best actor for his role as Ahlo. It also won the Crystal Bear and the Best First Feature and the Amnesty International Prize at Berlinale. It was also the Australian nomination to the Academy Awards for best foreign language film.

Its director, Mr. Mordaunt, has lived and worked throughout Southeast Asia, in Laos, Vietnam and Thailand, and something he learned during his travels inspired him to make the award-winning documentary Bomb Harvest, that was also filmed in Laos. Laos was heavily bombarded during the Vietnam war -- it is in fact the most bombed country in history -- and there are unexploded ordinances scattered throughout the countryside. Bomb Harvest examines the environmental, social and personal impact of these remains of war. It follows an Australian bomb disposal specialist who trains locals how to defuse the bombs, and who tries to convince villagers and especially children not to look for bombs and use them for scrap metal.

The documentary was a great international success, and helped bring attention to the fact that there are ticking time bombs scattered throughout the land of Laos. What audiences seemed most interested in, however, were the stories of Laotian children who risked their lives to try and improve their lot. Their friends in Laos encouraged them to make another film, this time telling a similar story but from a Laotian rather than an Australian perspective. They decided that it should focus on a child, and that it would be a fictionalized exploration of many of the issues and difficulties they had witnessed in Laos, but that it would also show the resilience and hope they had encountered in the people they met.

They wanted to be sure that the story they told was authentic, that it reflected the real experiences of the people of Laos, and that it wouldn't look like an outsider's film. They tried wherever possible to adapt their story by drawing upon the personal narratives and personalities of the actors and locals they worked with. That struggle for authenticity made their film more risky in the eyes of investors, and it was a struggle to get the Australian financing for a film with a completely Laotian cast, and no English-language speakers at all. It was also a struggle to win the trust of the local communist government, but the success of their previous work, and the fact that they had a number of local filmmakers on their team, helped to reassure officials.

The film depicts the loss of connection, and the loss of cultural heritage, experienced by villagers who are forced to leave their homes due to the construction of a dam. They had lived a life in close touch with the land, a life centered on the once flowing river that is now a stream running down from the dam up above their valley. Now they are forced to relocate, to make a home elsewhere, where they are strangers and unwanted, and where they have no ties to the landscape.

As I understand it, the film has been embraced in nearby Thailand, where critics have praised it as capturing the authentic Indochinese spirit -- but it has been banned in Laos where it was filmed. The Laotian government is very sensitive to any perceived criticisms of their relocation efforts. According to some reports, they want to turn their country into ""the battery of South-east Asia"" by exporting hydroelectric power to Thailand and Vietnam. The film does give some indication of the impact of those aspirations on both the land and the people of Laos. The filmmakers remain hopeful the film will someday be shown in Laos, and point out that other films banned in Laos were eventually released there.

A powerful scene, early on in the film, shows villagers watching a government presentation at the dam upstream of their village, suggesting that they should take pride in the success of the dam, and explaining that another dam will be built downstream from them and that their village will be submerged. The young boy, still oblivious to the changes he will soon face, swims blissfully in the waters of the dam, watching the underwater ruins of people who inhabited the land much earlier, now lost to oblivion. Later, when they are forced to move, the boy carries mangoes with him from a great tree planted by their ancestors. He hopes to plant them when they arrive in hopes of establishing a connection between their past and their future, and of connecting to their new home.

The film depicts scenes of incredible natural beauty, but also depicts struggles against nature -- notably there is a scene that reminds me of the Werner Herzog film Fitzcarraldo in which a man carried a boat over a mountain through the Amazon jungle. The place they arrive to is a war scarred country, and at the heart of the film is its suggestion of the environmental and cultural impact of dangerous technologies, designed for war, that had fallen from the sky. It is a film that may make you think about the past differently, because it is not over for many of those who were impacted by war. At the same time, it is a rich and rewarding and entertaining film, and I'm fairly confident that most viewers will fall in love with the plucky young boy and girl, and perhaps also the eccentric uncle in a purple coat, who are the true heroes of the film.",1396224000,3,6413,4.760791366906475

6255536,4,B00IACUOCO,"An unlikely underdog-story from Australia, The Rocket showcases the struggles of a Laotian family as they go in search of a new home after the construction of a dam forces them to abandon their native village, a situation that is emblematic of how indigenous people the world over are callously pushed aside to make way for an impersonal modern world.

Young Ahlo (Sitthiphon Disamoe), the central character in the story, comes from a culture that believes that twins are by their very nature either good or evil, and since Ahlo is himself a surviving twin (his brother having been stillborn), the family - his mild-mannered father and cantankerous, superstitious grandmother - cant quite decide whether hes a good luck charm or a bad luck charm, though they suspect he is probably the latter. This puts Ahlo in the rather awkward position of feeling like every time some calamity befalls the family, he is somehow indirectly responsible for it. The three travelers are accompanied by an elderly Laotian who, as a child, fought on the side of the Americans during the war and whos so obsessed with James Brown that he dresses like him and carries his recordings with him wherever he goes, and his feisty little niece who quickly becomes Ahlos confidante and companion on the journey.

The crux of the plot is Ahlos attempts to win a cash prize for the best homemade rocket built out of the many un-detonated explosives that lie strewn across the countryside, a sad and painful remnant of the long-ago war that, all these years later, continues to cast an indomitable shadow over the region. Its a contest with its roots planted partly in science and partly in traditional superstition, since the goal is to appease the gods by seeding the clouds in the hope of making it rain.

Improbable as it is at times, the movie demonstrates that, even among the have-nots in this world, there is often still a caste system designed to keep a person from advancing in life, but that with a little ingenuity, determination and a few handy resources, its hard to keep an optimistic and spirited boy down.",1405900800,,2091,4.802777777777778

6255538,5,B00IACUOCO,"This is a film that was made by Australians with the financial assistance of Screen Australia but is set in Laos. It tells the story of ten year old Ahlo. He was born as a twin, his sibling not surviving birth. In his tribe twins are seen as one being good luck and the other being bad - his grandmother decides that he is the bad luck one and thinks he should die.

His mother loves him and he grows up but the curse of his bad luck taints everything. So every misfortune can be related to him. Then the authorities turn up to build a new dam and they have to leave their ancestral home. What follows is a trip across beautiful Laos, a land that is still riddled with ordnance and the scars of the Vietnam War.

Ahlo finally thinks he might be able to prove he isn't cursed when he sees an opportunity to enter the rocket competition of a town. This town awards a big cash prize to the best rocket - in the hope it will please the gods and make it rain.

The journey that they all go on will feature adventures with electricity, malaria, unexploded bombs and Laos' answer to James Brown. This film is one that has at its core a very positive message, but the road is a very rocky and my heart went out to Ahlo and his friends and family on a number of occasions. Writer and director Kim Mordaunt has made a film to be proud of and it is Australia's official entry for an Academy Award 2014 for best foreign language film. In Lao with good sub titles and a run time of 96 minutes, this is a film it is very easy to recommend indeed.",1404777600,,1532,4.117056856187291

6255540,4,B00IACUOCO,"I've traveled through Laos on motorcycle several times and have stayed in the remotest of villages, so just to see the scenery and village scenes was fun for me.

The positive notes in this movie are how people who live at the poverty line can still find happiness and be bound as a community by common activities.

The negative notes, which the movie fully intended to bring up, is how superstition and ignorance can make a simple problem nearly impossible to deal with.",1401926400,,471,4.662650602409639

Kia and Ahlo join forces to earn money for their families. The results are surprising and delightful. Upbeat and hopeful movie for families.

The actor playing Ahlo is a street child, whose well honed survival instincts fit the part so well it may not be acting, like the child actors in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slumdog-Millionaire/dp/B001P9KR8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slumdog Millionaire</a>. The stuntman who plays Ahlo's father Toma had never played a leading acting role before, yet felt he was telling his own life story in The Rocket. The grandmother playing Taitok is Akha Hilltribe and said she was just being who she is.

Once we were sleeping in bamboo huts among the hilltribe people when I injured my hand. The shaman grandmother went up into the hills to gather herbs, then brewed a poultice with which she bandaged my hand. She came back from her work in the fields to check on me, and replace the cotton wrap and clean the wound before we left the village.

The Rocket visuals are stunning&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peoples-of-the-Golden-Triangle-Six-Tribes-in-Thailand/dp/0500973148/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peoples of the Golden Triangle: Six Tribes in Thailand</a>. At the entrance to hilltribe villages are gates of carved spirits like effigies to protect the community from harm with geometric wood talismans tacked to the gateposts. Women wear silver coins sewn to hats, a walking bank since there are no locks on homes. Children are protected by talismans as they do their work of collecting metal from bombs to sell for scrap. Laos was carpet bombed by the USA for 9 years and live bombs remain traps for the unwary.

On the Plain of Jars we walked between stone marked paths. Those sinuous wayfinders have already been cleared of land mines. Warnings to not step outside the paths do not need to be repeated.

The soulful authenticity of pain and horror seems to come from remembered history among the actors. And their joy and laughter is genuine and heartfelt. Ten star recommended family film, The Rocket opens avenues for discussion about what we value, contributing to the family welfare, differences and samenesses among human beings globally: the desire for the dignity of self sufficiency through work, the universal thirst for freedom, respect for family and friendship, desire for safety, food, shelter, clothing.

Visually poignant reminiscence of Laos and the Viet Nam era legacy",1399939200,,4130,6.082474226804123
6255545,5,B00IACUOCO,"I lived in Laos for a year and had the good fortune to travel to many parts of the country.  This movie captures the incredible beauty, poverty, and simplicity of life in rural Laos.  I suspect (but can't verify) it accurately represents the poor handling of relocation of minority tribal members for big government projects.  Where it fails, I suspect, is that it doesn't capture the open, loving, sharing spirit of the Lao people that I experience.  But then, I was a foreign traveler, not a poor minority citizen.  Also clearly addresses problems left over from America's ""Secret War"" in Laos.  Overall, a beautiful and important film.",1399766400,4,638,4.91588785046729
6255546,5,B00IACUOCO,"This movie was excellent! It had a richly layered story line with compelling and very real characters, and also managed to bring in different aspects of Lao life today (like environmental issues, land concessions and displacement, the legacy of the war, etc.) in a natural but shocking way, as you would encounter them on the ground there. Highly recommended!",1398470400,3,359,5.101694915254237
6255547,5,B00IACUOCO,"The Rocket is a wonderful movie about a boy struggling against the world. Young Ahlo has a hard enough time growing up in rural Laos. This beautifully filmed movie looks like a travelogue but the world that they live in is deadly and that adds to the tragedy He has to deal with poverty, modernization, and a landscape littered with unexploded ordinances (UXOs)  and then a catastrophe strikes.

This is the second time that director Kim Mordant addressed the issue of UXOs left by armed forces after a war they leave the first time he used a documentary format but this time he uses drama.

His grandmother believes that Ahlo was born under a bad sign. It's an unfair world but as many young boys do Ahlo tries his best to help his family and neighbors. But those attempts fail.

He tries to gets by with a little help from his friend Kia who is bearing her own cross and The Godfather of Souls greatest Laotian fan. Everyone has endured some horrible tragedy but they continue to persevere. Even with all the strikes against them Ahlo and Kia develop a genuine friendship and show great warmth that emanates from the screen in spite of the difference in language.

Ahlo sees the last chance to help his family find a home and escape the stigma that he is shackled with by entering a rocket building contest hence the title, but its a guarantee that hell do well. The subject matter is deadly serious, but the film is family friendly although I would caution parents to watch it first due a particular scene.

Story  Draws you in and makes you care for the characters.
Acting  When are they going to have a best acting category for kids?
Visuals  A beautifully filmed movie.
Soundtrack  Ambient sounds and music add to the film.",1398211200,2,1729,4.566343042071197
6255548,5,B00IACUOCO,"This film is deeply moving -- at once funny, inspiring, sad and eye-opening.  Mordaunt had the courage and the soul to tell a rich story about an impoverished land and a people that most of the world know nothing about.  I'd pay serious money to have witnessed the first casting meeting between Mordaunt and Sitthiphon Disamoe aka Ahlo.  What a charming and powerful presence.  Same for Loungnam Kaosainam aka Kia.

And what planet did Purple come from?  He was flat off the charts.  Wonderful acting from top to bottom, in a movie set against a backdrop of enormous human suffering -- much of it inflicted by the U.S. Air Force during the CIA's secret 1964-1973 war.
