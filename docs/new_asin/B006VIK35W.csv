8505014,5,B006VIK35W,"Great movie that gives a new perspective on this dark chapter of history. Based on a real story, the movie is about a family of German jews that gets hidden by a group of farmers in the Mnsterland during WWII. It shows the courage of the farmers without downplaying the risks they took. I particularly liked the complexity of the characters in the movie. For example, it hints at why a farmer at the time might have supported the Nazis but hidden a Jewish woman and her daughter at the same time. The movie does not portray stereotypes but shows how humans can be quite complex in their motivations.
However, I have to say, that the first time, I tried to buy this movie from a UK seller and have it shipped to the US, it never arrived. After waiting 2 months or so, I filed a claim and got my money back. I then ended up buying it in person during my next trip to Europe.",1455926400,,872,4.227544910179641
