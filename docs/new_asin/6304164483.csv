7865625,4,6304164483,"You Sinatra fans? I would have you look at the whole Sinatra, his swagger  as he  came up to the Mike , the confidence, the  anticipation you felt, that told you this will be good. He was the complete entertainer, not just his singing but, the whole package, you get it all and that is what you pay for This man drank , smoked, kept hours that would down any other man. Then came on stage and you did get your monies worth. So he blew a line, or you heard a cracking voice. So what?, I don't give a damn he still was the best at what he did, he entertained . There were  more accomplished singers around that did it by the book, this man was self taught. Impeccable phrasing, pronunciation. No one could touch him in that regard.  I had the pleasure of seeing him when I lived in Hollywood. I had the green light as I walked across Sunset at Cherokee, he was in his car at the red light when I saw him I gave him a thumbs up, he smiled, nodded his head,  and  returned a thumbs up back to me..

He did indeed, do it his way.

I loved the man, flaws and all.",1433030400,2,1065,3.981132075471698
7865626,5,6304164483,"Great concert!  And, I love the introduction by Princess Grace.  It's the last of the classy and glamorous eras of old Hollywood, so her intro really sets the scene for Sinatra's entrance and performance.  Frank's performance will remind you, once again, why he is The Chairman of The Board and why nobody comes close to his level of vocal and phrasing prowess -- a true master with a one of a kind style.  I'm a young guy and I can tell you for sure, they don't make singers like this anymore.  Fortunately, Frank Sinatra's voice lives forever in recordings and DVD's like this. Check it out.  Really cool concert!",1426982400,,615,4.5963302752293576
7865627,5,6304164483,"This is another fantastic performance by Sinatra, and yet it is also a very unique concert.  Princess Grace of Monaco gives a loving introduction to Sinatra (former actress and co-star with Sinatra in the movie ""High Society).  Besides the glamorous and royal setting of this concert, there are songs that you have never seen Sinatra perform before, as well as unique arrangements to some of his standards.  Check out the cool arrangement Sinatra and orchestra pull out with ""One For My Baby"" -- not just piano (as usual), but fully orchestrated with a lush arrangement that is like the soundtrack of a movie, with Sinatra as the actor and narrator.  I had the pleasure of seeing Sinatra perform 5 times in my life and I have never seen him perform this song with an arrangement like this.  Sinatra has so much vocal control and command of the stage that it's hard to understand why he decided to retire around the time of this concert.  Although it was really just a short two year break -- thank God!  Anyway, Sinatra's arrangements, choice of songs and overall demeanor make this a unique concert -- a must see.  Enjoy!",1426896000,2,1122,4.688775510204081
7865628,4,6304164483,"What can you say - he was a master performer.  I have seen better by Sinatra but this one was still good.
It includes most all of his signature numbers.",1394928000,,152,4.066666666666666

7865630,5,6304164483,"Have watched this video several times and really enjoy it. Michael Dorn is the perfect narrator, with his deep articulate voice-over. The re-enactments are done very well. Never fails to send a chill down my spine and check out the dark corners.",1198972800,,245,4.857142857142857
