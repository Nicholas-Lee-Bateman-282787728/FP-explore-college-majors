8081195,1,B00000IBR4,"This movie is not Keifer Sutherland's movie with the same name called ""Beat"".  This movie is a Korean movie that was subtitled and I couldn't even get through because I was so dissappointed by getting the wrong movie.  It needs to be made clear to the public what they are getting...this movie does not list the cast list.  Keifer Sutherland has three movies that are in the can, but are not yet released.  Beat is one of these movies about an author who has a homosexual escapade in the sixties? And then accidentally shoots his wife in a William Tell stunt at a party.  This is pretty lame as far as a review goes, but had I gotten the right movie, I would have written the right review.",1006128000,2,689,4.3515625
