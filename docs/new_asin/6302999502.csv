7833723,4,6302999502,"This TVM directed by Michael Toshiyuki Uno is notable for how Laura Linney steals the tube, as the daughter of Joanne Woodward as Washington congressman faced with the issue of drug addiction. The use of real life pictures of Woodward with her own daughter, and the fact that she co-produced, tells you that the subject has personal significance for Woodward. Unfortunately for her the teleplay by Nina Shergold, based on a story by Michael McTaggart and Ellen M Violett, presents Woodward as a harridan, evidence of the negative effects of a working mother. At one point Fritz Weaver as her husband says ""Trying to reason with you is like standing in front of a bulldozer"". If the idea of making the drug addict a torch singer who idolises Billie Holliday is perhaps rather overstated, the teleplay also raises a generational comparison between drug taking and alcoholism. The music score by Patrick Williams is used to lovely effect in one scene, when a baby is first held, but otherwise we get soaked in inspirational uplift. Watch for Patti D'Arbanville, and Allison Janney.",1003276800,7,1078,4.961325966850829
7833724,3,6302999502,"Joanne Woodward gives a strong performance as a determined, sometimes domineering, yet well-meaning congresswoman coping with her daughter's drug addiction on the eve of announcing her run for the U.S. Senate. Woodward (who earned an Emmy nomination for this film, which she also co-produced) and Laura Linney, who portrays her substance addicted daughter, show the strong love/hate dynamics in their character's relationship. Linney, (later co-starring opposite Jim Carrey in ""The Truman Show,"" and earning an Oscar nomination for ""You Can Lean on Me"") gives a heartfelt, unflinching portrait of a woman struggling to deal with her substance abuse/recovery as she asserts her independence from her mother, and Woodward superbly brings to life yet another strong, intelligent female character in her long line of smart, well-chosen, and expertly acted roles. The sensitive, intelligent script by Nina Shengold pulls no punches in illustrating the debilitating side of drug use, yet is never preachy.
This film handles difficult subject matter that may have seemed cliched or melodramatic in other hands in an honest, straightforward manner; much credit to all involved for first class work.",986256000,7,1190,5.580110497237569
