3172537,5,B0017INRGI,"Tiny Toon Adventures has to be Warner Bro's best cartoon show ever. I too have waited a long time for this release and have finally had my prayers answered. I just wish they would sell these sets for a price that wouldn't suck our pockets dry. Of course that's not a problem if you're someone like Montana Max. And by the way, there are more volumes on the way, Season 1 Volume 2 will be released on April 21st and after that volume 3 will be the complete second and third seasons. This had to be the best of the Steven Spielberg Presents collection and now we can finally enjoy it when ever we want. In the words of Go Go Dodo ""If you're a Tiny Toons fan but you don't buy a copy of this DVD set, you're Coo-Coo, Coo-Coo!""

Please make plans for more Tiny Toons on DVD, Warner Bros.",1212624000,,406,4.342105263157895
3172539,5,B0017INRGI,"I,ve waited for so long and it's finally here! The first volume of Tiny Toon Adventures on DVD! I remember Tiny Toon Adventures from my childhood back when I was a young lass. In case you are unfamiliar, Tiny Toons is about a second generation of young Toons who are kid-like versions of Looney Tunes. They attend a school called Acme Looneversity where the original Looney Tune characters are teachers. They teach Buster, Babs and the other Tiny Toons on how to become the 2nd generation of Toons and they earn a diploma of Lunacy when they graduate. If they're not at school, the young toons are out having adventures that are often parodies of popular movies, TV shows, comic books, etc. Tiny Toons like 80s and 90s cartoons and many other classics have true humor and absolutley none of the rotten toilet humor and idiocy that's in the horrible cartoons and animated films of today. Thanks to this and other DVDs, we can now have the classics with us forever. The humor in Tiny Toons is witty and often has parodies of popular TV shows and movies. This is one classic you may want to share with your family.

Tiny Toon Adventures began production when Warner Bros. reinstated its animation studio in 1980. It debuted in 1990 on Fox Kids and ended production in 1995. A major precedent was the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Tiny Toon Adventures is a witty show that often contained political and entertainment satire. Caricature versions of celebrities made frequent appearances, though were almost always voiced by imitators, and often appeared under parody names. Tiny Toon Adventures is a series that kids, teens and adults of all ages can enjoy.

This is defintely a recommendation for all DVD libraries.

3172540,5,B0017INRGI,"I'm so happy!  At last I can junk all my TTA VHS and the ones I taped off air that were filling up space on my shelves.

All the episodes IN ORDER.  Done the right way.

Proof that The Studios DO LISTEN if you put enough pressure on.

Well done Warners.

But remember fans.  TTA Vol 1 needs your support.  Warners would not have
spent time and money putting it together if they hadn't considered the
potential sales first.

If TTA Vol 1 doesn't sell as many as they think, they'll be no Vol 2 or 3.

3172542,5,B0017INRGI,"Tiny Toons is easily the best animated TV show of the nineties. Although shows on the Disney Afternoon always have a special place in my heart, Tiny Toons is so witty and hilarious. Watching it as an adult is possibly more fun than watching it as a kid. For example: Who knew that the whole Buster/Babs plot-line of ""Tiny Toons: How I Spent My Summer Vacation"" is a parody of Deliverance???? I've been waiting for this to come out for years, and I'm so glad it finally has. It's about time!! I can't BELIEVE they released stupid Animaniacs and Pinky & The Brain first.",1208736000,2,568,4.471153846153846
3172543,5,B0017INRGI,"Why Season 1 Volume 1?

Season 1 was odd with a whopping 65 episodes.  Most likely it will be broken up into ""Season 1 Volume 1"" and ""Season 1 Volume 2"" DVD releases although Volume 2 hasn't been announced yet.

Fans are hoping the following will also be released on DVD:

Season 2 had 13 episodes

Season 3 had 20 episodes (which included the 30 minute ""It's a Wonderful Tiny Toon Christmas Special"" as an episode)

There were two hour long specials:
""Night Ghoulery""
""Tiny Toons Spring Break Special""

And a direct to video release:
""How I Spent My Vacation""",1208563200,68,560,4.54
3172544,5,B0017INRGI,"Fantastic!  Tiny Toon fans have been waiting for years to see this out on DVD.
For those not as familiar, Tiny Toon Adventures (TTA) was a weekday cartoon that came out in the early 1990s.  It's animation and story lines were wonderful, contrasted with the majority of poorer quality animated shows of the time.
The ""next generation"" of Looney Tunes (not baby versions of the originals), TTA kept what made toons fun, while leaving most of the old overdone formulas behind.  While enjoyable for kids, it also had a lot of jokes and references that made the show as much fun for adults as well.  In fact most of the people I knew who watched TTA were young adults, including myself.  But don't bother trying to convince the marketing people of that.  Fortunately the writers and animators knew their audience.
I've seen some box art for this elsewhere, and have to say I think they could significantly improve it, if going to be more appealing to its fans.  But don't let it dissuade you from checking the show out.
Overall one of my favorite cartoon series, and as much fun for us big kids as for the young ones.  I'm looking forward to having it on DVD!",1208044800,14,1154,4.541062801932367

3172546,4,B0017INRGI,"I remember when this show came out...loved it to the point where I still to this day can sing the theme song, and I haven't seen it probably since I finished high school.  So it's a bit different to watch this through grown up eyes, I've grown into a more peaceful sort and not nearly so amused by dropping anvils, etc. but it is still pretty cute and definitely has it's funny moments.

So I watched episode one with my daughter tonight and noticed that the closed captioning is way, way off.  Sometimes she and her papa like to leave the close captioning on so that he can read as he's watching.  It was pretty clear they had the text loaded up for an entirely different episode, I finally asked my angel to turn of the captioning (because she was holding the remote) because it was pretty distracting to be listening to one thing and reading something entirely different and making sense of both...headache inducing to do for longer periods of time that's for sure.  For me, the thing is, we don't need the close captioning, but others do, so I think this is an issue that needs to be looked into and resolved by the production company.  And that's the reason for the dropped star, not the falling anvils, or rolling coins with Monty's face as the case may be...",1497571200,,1265,4.454545454545454

My 8 year old who is more of a non- fiction, non- comedy type, like his daddy, watched. He liked it I think because of all the songs and learning they try to impose. For example, one episode teaches about the states, while another tells about Abraham Lincoln. Of course it is more comical than traditional teaching but still it gives the just of the matters.

It's a relatively careless transfer from analog sources, so it's got all those fantastic problems you remember from good old NTSC television. Even the logos have serious dot-crawl all over them. The DVD encoding looks bad to begin with, and is only exacerbated by the analog problems in the source material.

I grew up with the family watching Tiny Toons when I was young and it was a show we all as a family love. The only thing we could really rely on watching these amazing cartoons again at the time is by holding on to tapes recording the broadcasts. Now I am relieved this is finally on dvd. However, Warner Bros.  waited just slightly too long to put it on dvd. Someone really close to me whom I love dearly passed away sadly within little over a mere year before Tiny Toons season 1 volume 1 came to be on dvd igniting the rest of the volume's releases. So the Tiny Toons dvds would get 5 stars but the inexcusable long wait on preserving this show into digital knocks it down 1.

3172614,5,B0017INRGI,"Buster appears from out of his burrow and introduces the viewers to Adventure Day on Tiny Toon Adventures. He then rushes off to Acme Looniversity, where he meets Babs outside of school and they open with a song, ""Oh, dear, Acme Looniversity. School of much hilarity. We say with much sincerity. Let us go home at ton.""
During class, many of the Tiny Toons are asleep at their desks, bored with their teacher, Elmer Fudd, who is demonstrating cartoon logic, such as walking on thin air. He walks off of his desk and does not fall to the ground, as he shows his class that they will not fall until they look down. Babs is at her desk, not paying any attention, as she doodles and dreams about being Queen Babs. Plucky is sitting at the desk behind her and pops her dream balloon with his pencil, complaining that she was blocking his view. Babs retaliates by sticking her tongue out at him.

The principal informs Elmer over the loudspeaker that his car is on fire (again), so Elmer tells his class to ""be vewy vewy quiet"" until he gets back and leaves the classroom. Babs mocks Elmer and snidely asks, ""Has he been using that line long enough, or what?"" The toons crack up hysterically, as Babs continues to poke fun at Fudd (in her Joan Rivers voice). Hamton informs her that Professor Elmer Fudd wanted them to be quiet, but Babs interrupts him and jokes, ""Every time opportunity knocks, the pig complains about the noise."" Buster peeks out of the door and notices a gloomy Elmer walking down the hallway (carrying his detached steering wheel, which is still smoking from the fire) and tells Babs that Elmer is on his way and that she had better cool it. Babs basically doesn't care, as she continues to do her shtick. She imitates Elmer Fudd as Elvis Presley, singing similar to Elmer and dancing and dressed as Elvis (wearing a wig that resembles Elvis' hairstyle). She then produces a sweat puddle, as Dizzy (wearing a shirt that reads ""Roadie"") spins up to her and hands her a towel. She wipes her face and hands it back to Dizzy, as he tosses it at Plucky's face, sending him smashing into the wall. Buster tries desperately to warn her that Elmer is back, but to avail, as she finishes her imitation (on top of Elmer's desk) with singing, ""Sometimes, I wonder what I'm a gonna do, but there ain't no cure for the Elmer Fudd blues."" A boiling mad Elmer grabs her by her wig and orders her to go the principal's office, while giving the rest of the class a pop quiz (who are distraught about this).

Babs (back in her normal outfit) goes to the principal's office, opens the door and looks inside, as he introduces himself as ""The Great and Powerful Principal of Looniversity"" (a giant, flaming green head similar to the wizard from The Wizard of Oz) and tells her to come in. He is angered that it is the third time this week that she has been sent to him. She gets on her knees, ""crying"" and ""pleading"" (actually giving one of her performances that The Great and Powerful Principal of Looniversity says will not work on him this time) that she was framed and is innocent. He tells her that she has to learn some self-control. He tells her that he is sending her home for the rest of the day, which delights Babs, who imitates Glinda the Good Witch with her response, ""There's no place like home."" He tells her that he is not amused and zaps a note in her hands, which is to be taken home to her mother.

Babs comes home and greets her dozens of siblings (all younger than her) before walking over to her mother (who is always only seen from the neck down) with the note. Babs' mother, who is bottle-feeding one of Babs' infant siblings, is upset that she was sent home from school again and dreads having to talk to the principal, as she hates it when he ""shoots that fire in the air."" Babs tries to explain how she was making fun of Elmer and the ""vewy vewy"" line that he always says, but her mother interrupts her by patting on her head and telling her that she needs to learn some self-control. She also tells Babs that it would be a good idea if she goes to her room and study, and that they will discuss school later. A distraught Babs goes to her room, turns on the television and plops down on her bed, believing that no one appreciates her.

A commercial is on, as a strange-looking fellow in a bow tie and checkered suit is asking the viewers if they are feeling down and if their life is less than grand. Babs lies back against her pillows and responds, ""Sheesh, it's downright bland."" He then ecstatically asks the viewers, ""Then, why not come down to... (pausing briefly as the human was just a costume, revealing Gogo to be the one wearing it) ...Wackyland?"" Gogo maniacally laughs and walks around in the air above the pathway leading to Wackyland. Babs is excited and remarks, ""Yeah, I'll run away to Wackyland!"" Gogo is now looking and speaking directly to Babs, as he happily responds, ""Good idea. They'll appreciate you there. They will. They will. They will."" Babs approaches her television set, looking directly at Gogo in front of the screen, and agrees with a ""Yeah!"" Gogo finishes the commercial with saying, ""This announcement paid for by the Wackyland tourist board."" He then reaches out from within the television set and turns the dial (which shuts it off), as he disappears and the screen goes to black. Babs thanks him out loud anyways and leaves her burrow.

She gets on her pink bicycle and pedals straight to Wackyland, mumbling about self-control and how everyone will realize how talented and terrific that she is now that she is gone. She arrives at the bridge that leads to Wackyland and hops on, but as she walks across, thunderclouds appear over her and there are many laughs, howls and other odd sounds that startle her. She decides to hold her head up high and chest out, hopping quickly across the pathway until she makes it inside (standing on top of one of the rock platforms that are floating in the air). In her John Wayne impression, she boldly states, ""It'll take a lot more than that to frighten me, pilgrim."" A blob-like creature appears from above her and growls at her, hanging upside-down and displaying his large and vicious teeth. Babs looks to the audience, as she points to the creature and remarks, ""It'll take something like that."" She screams and dashes for the exit, but everything suddenly disappears, as the scenery changes (with a spiral-shaped blue and white sky all around her) and Babs falls down to the shiny, blue ground right below her. There is a pyramid with an eyeball on it and a giant lady's shoe sitting in the background, as a huge mouth appears behind her, crazily states, ""Welcome to Wackyland,"" and laughs. Babs looks to the viewers again and says, ""I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.""

Babs is scared and hurdled up on the ground, as the mouth transforms back into his normal self, which is revealed to be Gogo Dodo (who was also the blob-like creature). He jokes, ""I like her, she's silly,"" and then introduces himself to her (while hanging upside down in the air). Babs is slightly annoyed and wonders why he screamed at her, as Gogo tells her, ""Seems like the wrong thing to do at the time"" (peeling a banana that a large chimp emerges from, which licks Babs and goes away). Babs grumbles, ""I see,"" as Gogo bumps into her and says, ""Lucky you. I can't see a thing without my glasses."" He proceeds to remove two glasses of water from his eyes and drinks one, giving Babs the other one (which she doesn't drink, but just holds onto). He wonders what brings a bunny like her to Wckyland, as she responds that no one appreciates her in Acme Acres and that she thought she would try living in Wackyland for a change. Gogo informs her that she will need someone to show her around, as he quickly changes into a tourist guide's outfit and puts Babs in tourist attire (complete with a camera and a lei). A chain link with two legs and feet is walking around, as Babs asks what it is and Gogo responds, ""A missing link."" A large, anthropomorphic pen rushes over to greet Gogo and offers to buy him lunch, as the wacky dodo hugs him and tells Babs that he is his ""pen pal."" Babs takes a picture and five small stones with hair on top of them go rolling by, as she responds, ""Oh, look. The rolling stones...and me without my autograph book."" A Warner Brothers logo is chasing a different WB logo with a mallet, smashing it as they run. Babs smiles and feels that she is going to like it in Wackyland.

After school, Buster, Plucky and Hamton go to her home, feeling bad for her for being sent home early. Buster finds a note next to her burrow and reads it out loud. It reads, ""Dear Buster, I have run away to Wackyland. It was the only mature thing to do."" Hamton is unpleasantly surprised, as he pulls down a chart of Wackyland and Acme Acres, explaining that much of Wackyland is uncharted cartoon wilderness. Buster is determined to find her, but Hamton does not want to go. Plucky informs them that they do not need to worry (pulling out an odd-looking device from his backpack), as he explains that he had been working on his ""lost rabbit detectometer device"" during shop class and that it will lead them right to her. He presses a button in the middle of it and it lights up, pointing and literally taking Plucky towards her location. Plucky yells for Buster and Hamton to follow him, as they are led to the bridge leading to Wackyland. Plucky holds back the device from taking him further and states, ""My brilliant invention tells me Babs is in Wackyland."" Buster pulls out Babs' note and responds, ""Her note told us that."" Plucky counters, ""Ridicule is the burden of genius,"" as the device pulls him quickly over the bridge with Buster and Hamton following closely behind.

They are led to an enormous, scary-looking tree with an entrance at the bottom of it. The tree's limbs resemble arms with long, eerie fingers protruding from them, as the holes in the tree's bark resemble a growling and evil-looking face. Hamton demands that he is not going in there, as Plucky feels that he does not have a choice, being taken through the entrance by the device. Buster tries to ease Hamton's nerves and tells him to wait outside, just in case Babs shows up, as he is going to go in and check things out for himself. Hamton nervously paces around, humming a Looney Tunes opening theme song, as an anthropomorphic briefcase (full of all sorts of items inside) approaches him. He suspects Hamton to be out of his environment, then asks if he is out of order (hanging an ""Out of Order"" sign around his neck), out of luck (handing him a giant four-leaf clover), out of circulation (forcing a newspaper in his hands), out of thin air (dropping a thin air canister on top of him) and out of season (shaking out salt on him from a giant salt shaker). He then questions Hamton on being out of bounds, but before Hamton can answer the puzzling question, he tells him that he has a 5-yard penalty and they will have to punt. A football (with legs and feet in brown shoes) forcefully kicks Hamton high into the air, as the briefcase responds, ""Hhheee's out of sight.""

Meanwhile, Gogo is ""fly fishing"" (using a large fly for bait, which holds up a sign that reads, ""Help Me!"") in a red stream that levitates above the ground, but Babs doesn't seem to find it humorous. She notices a gigantic fork that is stuck in the ground and jokes (in Valspeak), ""Gag me with a spoon. Is this like, what, the fork in the road?,"" as a large anthropomorphic eyeball (wearing a fedora and looking for something with a magnifying glass) passes by, to which Babs quips, ""Oh my gosh. Look at that. Must be a private eye."" This makes Gogo laugh and excited for Babs, telling her that she is getting the hang of Wackyland already.

Plucky is letting his device lead the way (as he is oblivious to close by signs that warn of a large hole that is ahead of him), but walks over a giant hole and suddenly realizes what he has done when he looks down. He falls through it, as the camera pans out and reveals the hole to be one of the black eyes of an enormous smiley face in space, which spits the green duck out of his mouth. Babs is laughing hysterically with a few of the residents (including the rolling stones, the pen pal, the missing link and a two-headed fellow that is wearing overalls and has no arms), as an anthropomorphic bucket full of dirt is pulling money out of the dirt and throwing it around. It hands Babs some cash and she responds, ""How nice. Paydirt. Thank you. I have always relied on the kindness of strangers."" The residents burst out in laughter, as Babs bashfully says, ""Stop! I'm not that funny."" An anthropomorphic fax machine walks to her and a fax prints out of it. The fax machine reads it out loud to her, as it states, ""We, the nutty natives of Wackyland, hereby invite you to a fancy-shmancy dinner at the Royal Palace."" Babs (imitating Katharine Hepburn) responds, ""Why, I'd be delighted to come. Really, I would."" The Wackylanders celebrate, as the pen pal yells, ""Three cheers for Babs."" Gogo approaches him with three chairs balanced on his finger and jokes, ""Three chairs for Babs."" Babs looks to the viewers and says, ""Pandemonium doesn't rain around here, it pours.""

Buster is walking down a pathway that is laying in-between rows of giant statues of feet, as he quips, ""Oh. These must be the foothills."" He notices a sign that reads ""Old Smokey"" and thinks that if he climbs up on top of Old Smokey, he might be able to spot Babs. He gets to the top, which has a large gray face protruding from the ground with a cigar in his mouth, puffing out large amounts of smoke into the air. Buster greets and asks him if he has seen a female bunny, to which the smoker's face bellows out a ""Nnnooooo"" from the side of his mouth, blowing a huge smoke cloud at Buster, which engulfs him and takes him into the air. Buster coughs and remarks, ""Someone alert the surgeon general,"" as he floats up into the air, passing by an enormous police office sitting on a large cloud and dunking smaller clouds (which are shaped like doughnuts and floating around) into his coffee (which is in a mug that reads, ""Cloud Cop"") and eating them. The cop grabs the cloud that Buster is in the middle of, but Buster halts him before he is eaten and says, ""Hey! Watch it, pal. I'm nobody's doughnut."" He then hops out of the cloud and falls through the sky, as suddenly Plucky (still falling from being spit out of the smiley face's mouth) and Hamton (still falling from the football's powerful kick) join him in the air. Buster is relieved and says, ""Fancy meeting you guys here,"" as Plucky responds, ""Yeah, nice of you to drop in."" They continue to fall (passing large film reels with stick figures on them, a giant open newspaper that is detailing the NASDAQ Stock Market on its pages and the moon in space), as they head straight for earth and land into a large cooking pot full of water.

Buster begins to bathe in the pot, stating, ""I generally opt for dry-cleaning, but what the heck,"" as a large anthropomorphic spoon approaches them. He is wearing a chef's hat and holding a pepper shaker, as he comments (with a French accent), ""Better to have ze hare in ze soup than ze soup in ze hair, no."" He then begins to shake the pepper into the pot, as most of it gets on Plucky, who wants to know what's the ""big idea."" He tells them that he is preparing dinner for the Queen, as she is having some friends over, and Hamton politely wonders who that could be. The spoon informs them that they are those friends and quickly slams the top of the pot over them. He snaps his fingers and two looney waiters unroll themselves out of a giant pig's tongue from within its mouth. The spoon quips, ""Dumb waiters"" (play on the word, ""dumbwaiter""), as he orders them to take the ""soup"" to the Queen.

Buster remains optimistic, assuring Plucky and Hamton not to worry, stating, ""I'm sure that the Queen is a kind, gentle, understanding...,"" but then gets interrupted by the Queens' demanding and angered voice, who yells, ""Where's my dinner?"" A startled Buster then finishes his statement by softly saying, ""Barbaric monster."" The waiters take the pot and drop it off in front of the Queen's throne inside of her palace, as she sits in silhouette with only her glaring eyes visible. The waiters remove the top, revealing a frightened Plucky and Hamton and a curious Buster. The Queen snarls, ""Feed me!,"" as Plucky and Hamton cling tightly to each other, scared for their lives, but Buster just calmly lies back against the pot and snacks on a carrot. Buster then scratches his chin, wondering who the Queen could be. The Queen yells out, ""Buster!,"" as Buster responds, ""Babs, is that you?,"" as the Queen pulls on a rope that lightens up the area and revealing herself to indeed be Babs. She is wearing a red and white crown that looks similar to a Jester's hat, a red and white fur coat and holding a rod with eyeballs. She is also surrounded by other Wackylanders, including Gogo (still in the tourist guide's outfit), the spoon chef, the private eye, the fax machine, the bucket of dirt and the pen pal (with red Looney Tunes opening title rings behind them).

Gogo tells them that Buster is incorrect and that she is ""Queen Babs, the first ruler of Wackyland,"" as he thanks them for playing the ""game"" and offers a parting gift (a giant comb). Babs tells him to zip it, as Gogo takes it literally, grabbing on a zipper that pops out of his mouth and zipping it up. She approaches Buster, Plucky and Hamton and informs Gogo and the Wackylanders that they are her pals and that she is very happy to see them. She assists Plucky out of the pot, who tells her that they thought she might be lost, or eaten alive by some slime-oozing creature (demonstrating by turning into a blob-like substance), torn limb from limb (demonstrating by ripping apart his shirt), but Buster interrupts him before he can carry on any further by clearing his throat and saying, ""I think she gets the picture."" Gogo responds, ""Picture! Did somebody say 'Picture?,'"" as he is holding a large anthropomorphic camera and slams it to the ground. He looks through the camera lens and has the Tiny Toons in focus for a group shot, but they are a little too far apart to get their full bodies in the picture, so Gogo pushes them closer together from each side, causing them to squeeze tightly against each other. He then squeezes them even tighter together by tying them up with rope. He takes off his hat and poses in front of them for the picture, seemingly telling them to say ""cheese,"" but was actually speaking to the camera, who responds, ""Cheese!"" Gogo slams Plucky's and Hamton's heads against the ground, as their eyes flash like a camera would flash when taking a picture. A picture pops out of Plucky's mouth as well as one from Hamton's mouth, as Gogo yanks them out and looks at them, which both are of the camera (with a big smile of his face).

Babs commands Gogo to stop acting silly, but he responds, ""I'm not acting,"" jumps into the air, makes noises like a siren and dashes off. Buster asks Babs how she is doing and she hops back into her chair and tells him that she is doing great. He asks if she is sure and she responds (with several of the other Wackylanders by her side and the pen pal continuously shaking her hand), ""Right as rain,"" as a raincloud suddenly appears directly above her and drenches her with heavy rain. He then asks if she is going to stay, which Babs responds that Wackyland is terrific (but then with an agitated look, pulls her arm back to release her hand from the pen pal's grip). Hamton sadly says that he is going to miss her, as she grabs him by the cheek and tells him that she will miss him as well. Buster coolly states that Acme Acres won't be the same without her (having his back to her and putting his hands into his fur on each side of his waist, which resemble pockets), as she informs them that they can visit her at any time. Plucky sarcastically responds, ""Sure we will,"" but then quietly tells Buster and Hamton that they should get going, as he doesn't want to find out what Wackyland is like after dark. He begins pulling Hamton and Buster across the red carpet to exit the palace, as Buster and a saddened Hamton tell her ""goodbye.""

They proceed to leave out the palace, as Plucky believes that Babs has it good, but Buster and Hamton seem doubtful of this. Plucky responds, ""What are you guys talking about? She's Queen. She's royalty. She's...,"" but gets interrupted by Hamton and Buster, who simultaneously say, ""Miserable."" Plucky looks back at Babs, who appears exhausted as she is surrounded by laughing and playful Wackylanders (the pen pal is continuously shaking her hand again while the private eye is shaking the other, the camera is hopping up and down and repeating the word, ""Cheese,"" several blue round dots float over to her and one says, ""Come on, dots, and do the polka,"" as they begin ""dancing"" in the air, the fax machine approaches her and says, ""The fax of the matter are irrelevant,"" as an elephant, the football and the two-headed fellow appear and the elephant asks, ""Did somebody call for an elephant?""). Babs has had enough of the constant insanity and endless jokes, as she yells, ""Stop! I can't take this anymore!"" She calms down a bit and explains, ""Look. You're all a lot of laughs, but you have to learn some self-control."" This causes her to remember Elmer, The Great and Powerful Principal of Looniversity and her mother (each appearing in their own separate bubble cloud around her) all telling her that she needs to learn some self-control (her mother's bubble cloud is under Elmer's cloud, which is preventing her to be seen from the neck up).

The Wackylanders are absolutely shocked at hearing this, as the fax machine prints out a fax for Babs regarding self-control. She takes the fax and reads it out loud, as it states, ""Article 9 of the Peanut Code strictly forbids the use of self-control while in Wackyland."" She is stunned to read this, as the pen pal angrily responds, ""Off with her head."" The Wackylanders surround and try to capture her, but she manages to escape their attempt (also losing the Queen attire and resorting back to her regular outfit) and tries to run away from them. They stay hot on her trail, chasing her through what appears to be underwater at the bottom of the ocean, but it turns out to actually be a picture reel that Gogo is turning, as they run out of it and into a room with 3 doors. Babs leads them into a hallway, but then quickly turns back the other way, trying to allude them. However, this doesn't work, as the Wackylanders are right behind her and ready to attack. She rushes over to the 3 doors and is confused on which one to choose, as the Wackylanders cheer for her and yell out different suggestions on which door to pick, or to ""take the money.""

Gogo approaches her (parodying a game show host, wearing a brown jacket and holding a microphone) and asks, ""So, what's it going to be? Door number one, door number two, or door number three?"" She chooses door number three and opens it, as a businessman with a contract tells her to ""sign right here."" She screams in terror and slams the door on him, as she states, ""My agent."" She then opens door number one, but there is another door right behind it. She opens that door, but there is another door that she has to open, which reveals the final door behind it. The door happens to be incredibly small, as Babs lies down next to it and opens it, peeking inside and noticing nothing but darkness. She looks back and sees the angered Wackylanders quickly approaching her, as she responds, ""Good thing I didn't have that carrot cake for dessert last night,"" and then narrowly escapes their clutches by squeezing though the door.

Meanwhile, Buster, Plucky and Hamton are back outside of the scary-looking tree, as the tiny door appears near them and floats over to behind Plucky. Babs (with an odd voice and from within the door) says, ""Knock, knock,"" as Plucky believes it was Buster or Hamton who said that and responds, ""NNaahh, cut it out. You know I hate those kinds of jokes."" Buster points to the door and tells him to look at it, then hurries over to it and opens it up. Babs pops out from the other side and lands on the ground, telling them that being Queen was awful and that she really missed them. She also says that she wants to go home, as the Wackylanders open up the tiny door from the other side and simultaneously respond, ""Fat chance! Stop her!"" Buster picks up Babs and informs them that it is time to get out of there, as they dash away from the Wackylanders, who are all snatching at her and fall from the door onto the ground.

The Wackylanders recover quickly and go after them, as the four Tiny Toons have made their way to a sign that reads, ""TO ACME ACRES,"" pointing to a nearby bridge that leads up to the apparent exit out of Wackyland. They approach the bridge, but it (and the sign) disappears before they can step onto it, leaving them at the edge of a cliff and nowhere to go. Hamton nervously says, ""Oh, no! How are we going to get out of here?,"" as Gogo suddenly appears (inside a portable information booth) and responds, ""The only way to get out of here is to leave the way you didn't come in.""

Buster asks, ""Well, we used the bridge to come in, so to get out, we can't use the bridge?"" Gogo remarks, ""Hhhmmm...could be,"" as the Wackylanders are almost upon them and they have to do something quick. Buster (remembering Elmer's technique of walking on air that he had taught them earlier in school) says, ""Well, it's worth a try,"" as he steps over the edge without looking down and doesn't fall. He tells the others to follow him, as Plucky and Hamton go next. Babs thanks Gogo and appears to be approaching him to give him a hug, but the wacky dodo responds, ""Aahh...don't mention it,"" then unzips the swirly purple and white background, waves to Babs, goes through it and zips it back up. She catches up to her friends, as Hamton reminds them, ""Remember what Professor Fudd said. Whatever you do, don't look down."" They walk through the air with their heads held high, as the hazy background changes back to the normal sky in Acme Acres, several feet above the bridge leading to Wackyland. The four of them fall onto the bridge, as they are relieved to be back home. Babs responds, ""Boy, I've learned my lesson. From now on, self-control is my middle name."" Some time later at Acme Loo, Elmer commends Babs on her newfound self-control, but as he turns his back, she can't resist taping a ""Laugh at the Monkey"" note to the back of him. She and the rest of her classmates snicker and laugh at the note posted on Elmer's back, as he wonders what is so funny. Babs shrugs and responds, ""I just can't help myself.""",1376870400,,26877,4.501229004506349

I DO NOT like having no choice but to be on-line to watch or play anything that I paid for. If I am in an area that does not have internet, I want to be able to access it! This instant video thing is a bad Idea! That was a bit too much money to pay for something that I can't fully download. Needless to say I am disappointed!

However, it's great to be able to watch the Tiny Toons videos again. Anyone that is a big fan of the series will love this one. I would just suggest buying the DVD set over streaming it.

The characters could be rude and crude, driving my mom crazy. It is one of my favorite cartoons! I eagerly awaited the DVD release from Warner Bros., in which I do love rewatching every episode, but the video quality could have been better, reminding me of VHS tapes. What is up with the fourth disc? Warner Bros. was too cheap to release a fifth disc, so they went with a double-sided disc instead.

3172656,4,B0017INRGI,"I'll be honest. I didn't grow up with the Tiny Toons like everyone else here. I never saw then when they originally aired, and I never saw them when they were syndicated. In fact, I only first heard about them a couple of months ago (before then, I only knew of their successor, Animaniacs). And now, I wish I had seen them when I had the chance on TV (not that it was totally possible, considering I was born in '96, and they ended in '95). For some reason, I can't get enough of their looney installments. The gags, the characters, and the animation--which is so fluid and colorful, it's just terrific--makes this show so great. I'm really hoping that Warner Bros. releases the final two seasons on DVD. I'll be waiting!
(The reason I gave this four out of five stars was because the last episode of disc 4B (""A Ditch in Time""), wouldn't play when I selected it. I was only able to see it through the 'play all' feature)",1317340800,,922,4.366279069767442

3172660,5,B0017INRGI,"I'm so happy to have this on dvd. This is the 2nd half of the 1st season, and it's worth every penny. I received it in the mail just yesterday so I haven't had time to watch all the episodes yet, but the one's I've seen so far bring back so many memories. I remember watching this everyday when I was a kid. The characters were great, the stories had morals and every day life lessons. Kids today don't get that from the new cartoons.

As far as quality of the picture goes...I have my dvd player hooked up to a 32inch LCD with the red/white/green/blue/yellow cables (I can't remember what kind they are) and the picture looks great. I didn't notice any dirt or lines in picture so far, I know some people can get nitpicky over that, but they don't understand that this cartoon was made with cels, an older type of animation process, and this is the best it ever will look. So don't expect HD high quality. I wouldn't hold my breathe for blu ray either. But still, the picture is great, nuff said.

Lastly for the packaging, It comes in a regular clear plastic case, with a cardboard slipcover. I was expecting a foldout same as the Animaniacs, but I like the case better.

If you enjoyed this show as a kid, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. This was one of the best cartoons of the late 80's to early 90's. This would also be great to give your children or grandchildren. I also ordered the the 1st half which hasn't come yet, but the last I've heard there are no plans to release seasons 2 and 3, which is a shame. Quite a few classic episodes in those seasons. But hopefully they'll be released in the near future. I hope you find this review useful in your decision. Get it, you won't regret it.

3172667,4,B0017INRGI,"When I got this set, I was very relieved to see that there were only single sided discs included.  Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed to see that there were absolutely no special features included on this set.

This set contains the remaining thirty episodes of the first season of Tiny Toons.  This set includes such classic Tiny Toons episodes as ""Career Oppor-Toon-ities,"" ""Ask Mr. Popular,"" ""Mr. Popular's Rules of Cool,"" ""Fairy Tales for the '90s,"" ""Tiny Toon Music Television,"" ""Viewer Mail Day,"" and ""You Asked For It Again.""

Overall, this is a decent set for what you get.  However, I do wish that some kind of bonus feature had been included in this set.

3172668,4,B0017INRGI,"This first volume set for the first season of Tiny Toon Adventures contains three single sided DVDs and one double sided DVD.  Personally, I fail to understand why it was decided to do a double sided disc instead of putting five single sided discs in the set.

The set contains thirty-five episodes and one bonus feature.  In addition to the first episode, you can see such classic Tiny Toon Adventures episodes as ""The Buster Bunny Bunch,"" ""Prom-ise Her Anything,"" ""Cinemaniacs,"" ""You Asked for It Part 1,"" ""Citizen Max,"" ""Buster and the Wolverine,"" ""You Asked for It Part 2,"" ""Fields of Honey,"" and ""A Ditch in Time.""

The bonus feature is ""From Looney Tunes to Tiny Toons - A Wacky Evolution!""  This is a documentary that runs for around 20 minutes, and contains interviews with several members of the production crew, as well as Ruth Clampett (the daughter of legendary Warner Brothers animator Bob Clampett).  The documentary talks about the origins of the original Looney Tunes shorts to how Tiny Toon Adventures came to be, and decisions that were made regarding the show.  It was an interesting documentary, and really gave an insight into what went on behind the scenes for Tiny Toon Adventures.

If you enjoy Tiny Toon Adventures, then this set is worth picking up and adding to your DVD collection.

3172670,5,B0017INRGI,"Just recieved my copy this morning and I was highly disappoited in the Packaging for Tiny Toons. Looks like hardly any effort was put into it. The set is not in a DVD boxset but in a single DVD case. Instead of overlapped discs, the discs are in thier own case, so you have to flip to get to them. The boxart is nothing special, something you could easily do in Photoshop. I'm certainly not a fan of flip side discs like for disc 4. It would have been better if they had just added a disc 5. There is also no artwork on disc 4 which means it will probably get easily scratched if you don't take care of it. There're these weird circular things on the front and back inside the DVD. Not sure what the point of that was for. For a great show, it definiely deserves better treatment and should've recieve the same treatment that Animaniacs had gotten.

On a good note, the episodes are unedited! The picture quality is still bright and colorful. Though there is still some grainy-blurry spots on them.

Besides the packaging, I'm super happy that it's finally out on DVD. It's been so long since I had last seen Tiny Toons. I don't think I will buy Season 1 Volume 2. Again, the packaging is just awful. I think I'll wait for a complete season 1 boxset and hope for better treatment.

3172678,3,B0017INRGI,"I used to watch this show back in my grade school days and was a big fan of Buster, Plucky and of course the inimitable Babs.  I'm glad to see it's finally on DVD for those of us who grew up on it to enjoy, as well as potential new fans who have never seen it.

That being said, I feel that Tiny Toon Adventures is not nearly as good as it subsequent series, Animaniacs: yes, Tiny Toon Adventures is fun and silly (much like the Looney Toon Cartoons) but at times it is simply too frenetic and slapstick for its own good (and believe me, I enjoy a dropping anvil or two . . . )

I would have liked to see more of the female characters in the series, especially Shirley Loon, who I feel pretty much steal every scene she is in.  Elmyra is a very interesting incarnation of Elmer Fudd and is voiced to perfection.  Babs, voiced BRILLIANTLY by Tress MacNeille, is simply the star of the show and can do no wrong (those Joan Rivers impersonations are a riot!) It must be said that all of the show's best episodes star Babs.  It's a pity the storylines for most of the female characters (with the exception of Babs) don't venture beyond standard ""female"" plotlines.

Also, though the show is called Tiny Toon ""Adventures"" there is in fact not much adventuring in the typical episode.  The major characters have their standard plotline and this is generally rehashed throughout (i.e. you know what will happen when Montana Max stars in an episode). Perhaps the writing would have been stronger if each storyline was a full episode, rather than three or four episodes per show.  (""How I Spent My Summer Vacation"" is remarkably well-written because it allows the writers ample time to develop the simultaneous storylines).

The show is rather kiddified (especially in contrast to the sly adult humor of ""Animaniacs"") which Tom Ruegger states was the intent of the show.  This doesn't mean that it won't appeal to adults . . . they're just clearly not the target audience.

I've pointed out mostly what I believe are the most glaring shortcomings of the show; that being said, I think it is still very watchable and enjoyable for anyone who grew up in the 90s or is a diehard Warner Bros. cartoon fan.",1243382400,2,2192,4.521518987341772

3172680,5,B0017INRGI,"Here it is: The second half of season one of Steven Speilberg's ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" is now on DVD !

With your hosts Buster and Babs Bunny - ""No relation."" - as well as a gaggle of original characters like Plucky Duck, Hamton J. Pig, Elmyra, Montana Max, Dizzy Devil, Gogo Dodo, and more, they'll take you on a whole mess of crazy adventures with 30 more episodes on 4 discs !

Ranging from how cartoons are made and a crash course in dating, to a talk show by Mr. Popular (Buster) and a crazy TV show lineup, it's never a dull moment in Acme Acres.  Of course, keep an eye out for a few of your favorite Looney Tunes characters in some episodes.  None of this zaniness would have been possible without their help at the prestigious Acme Looniversity.

With Buster's coolness, Babs' impersonations, Plucky's egotism, Gogo's wackiness, Elmyra's love of animals, Monty's money-grubbing selfishness, and much more, that's pretty much all you get in this set.  There aren't any special features or the like in there, but that's okay.  These episodes are some of the best I've seen in the '90s decade.  (Too bad THIS decade is almost over !)  Anyway, I hope the rest of the series, as well as the direct-to-video special ""How I Spent My Vacation"", will be on DVD soon !  Later, toonsters !",1241049600,2,1287,4.556521739130435
3172681,1,B0017INRGI,"I love Tiny Toon Adventures.  It's a great cartoon show, but this DVD set is an insult to any fan of the show.

I am not talking about the lack of special features or the rather generic packaging.  Those things can be overlooked.

Rather, I refer to the fact that this set contains EDITED versions of the show!

In the Tiny Toons Music Television episode the 555-Acme telephone number has been edited out!  This is an insult!  I paid good money for a DVD of a favorite show.  How DARE they cut out portions of the program, for ANY reason.  Warner Bros. should be ashamed of themselves for this offensive cut, and those responsible should be fired.

If I sound angry, I am.  This is a totally unacceptable action.  I'm tempted to return the DVD and demand a refund.

3172686,5,B0017INRGI,"In my opinion, Steven Spielberg's Tiny Toon Adventures, along with its follow-up show Animaniacs, were the very best animated comedy shows of the early 90s. I was delighted to see the first volume of Tiny Toon Adventures' first season coming to DVD, and of course the first volume left me eager for more. And very soon, on the 21st of April, 2009, the wacky world of Acme Acres, along with its cute, funny, loony characters, will be back with the remaining 30 fun-packed episodes of the first season! Tiny Toons never failed to make me laugh when I was a kid and they never fail to make me laugh now that I'm an adult. Tiny Toon Adventures is a show that's made in very good taste - it has really smart humor and nice cultural references, it doesn't have any dirty or obscene material, and as opposed to many modern TV shows that try to be funny by being dirty, Tiny Toon Adventures is very funny in a good, clean way. Tiny Toons has something for all ages - kids and teenagers will have a lot of fun and will actually learn some life lessons along the way (the show has some 'educational' episodes meant to bring a message to the children), while the adults will appreciate the smart humor and cultural references. And of course, everybody will appreciate the top-quality animation created by some of the greatest animation studios of the day (Tokyo Movie Shinsha, anyone?), will love the nicely drawn cute characters, each of which is well thought-out and has his/her own personality, and will adore the fun-packed stories in each of the episodes.

In case you're a fan of good, high-quality classic animation, or if you like animated comedy shows, or if you just like to have fun and if you have a good sense of humor, don't miss Tiny Toon Adventures! If you got the first volume of the first season, I'm sure you'll adore the second volume too, and if you haven't yet experienced Tiny Toon Adventures, it might just as well be a good idea to grab both volumes and prepare for a few days of fun and wackiness!",1234137600,21,2012,4.512328767123288
3172687,4,B0017INRGI,"Growing up in the 80s and the 90s make me thankful for I had grown up with many of the best animated cartoons, Tiny Toons being one of them. In many ways, the cartoons of the 80s/90s were the best for they had adventure, action, witty humor(and no toilet/rotten humor), good vs.evil emotion and personality. Shows like Tiny Toons and other shows of the 80s and 90s were made in very good taste - they had really smart humor and nice cultural references, they didn't have any dirty or obscene material, and as opposed to many modern TV shows, movies and animated films that try to be funny by being dirty, this show and other shows were funny in a good clean way. As a fan of Tiny Toon Adventures, I was pleased to hear about the second volume. I was happy with the first volume and hearing about the second volume has me excited. Fans of Tiny Toons, 80s/90s cartoons would be happy to hear of this volume. This set comes in 4 discs and contains the rest of the first season.

Tiny Toon Advenuters is about a generation of toon kids who attend a school called Acme Looniversity where Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes characters are teachers and teach them on how to become the second generation of toons. They're adventures are often parodies of movies, tv shows, comic books and other forms of popular culture. Tiny Toon Adventures is a witty show that often contained political and entertainment satire. Caricature versions of celebrities made frequent appearances, though were almost always voiced by imitators, and often appeared under parody names.

Tiny Toon Adventures debuted in 1990 and was shown on Fox Kids and later put into syndication. A major precedent for the series was the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This is one good show you may want to share with your kids and your family. I myself remember growing up with this show and those who also grew up with 80s/90s shows and Fox Kids will appreciate this. Tiny Toon Adventures is a series that kids, teens and adults of all ages can enjoy.

3172688,4,B0017INRGI,"Tiny Toons were not younger versions of Warner Bros. famous Looney Tunes characters but in reality they were the next generation of cartoon stars.  Developed by Steven Spielberg in conjunction with Warner Bros., Tiny Toons premiered in 1990, beginning in syndication and then moving to the Fox Kids network.

The opening toon is called ""A Looney Beginning"".  Those familiar with Warners classic cartoons will recall that they often broke down that imaginary wall between fantasy and reality, mixing their characters with their real life creators.  An animator (voiced by Steven Spielberg) is given until 9:00am the following day to come up with a new hit cartoon or else he's out of a job.  He works feverishly creating and throwing away ideas until those ideas take on a life of their own in the form of Buster and Babs Bunny.  Those two rascally rabbits actually end up as the real creators of Acme Acres and all its interesting characters including Plucky Duck, Hampton J. Pig, Dizzy Devil, and others.

These characters are all heavily influenced by Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tazz, and the rest of the Looney Tunes cast.  In fact, they are all instructors at Acme University, teaching their students how to be funny cartoon characters.  Some of the more original characters in the series include the loud, abrasive, and obnoxious Montana Max (Based on Yosemite Sam), Elmyra Duff (a female version of Elmer Fudd), and Shirley the Loon.

The four disc set includes 35 episodes in all, roughly a third of the entire series run.  While the show isn't as satirical and subversive as the classic Looney Tunes it does have its moments.  Kids will love the show but won't get the gist of all of the inside jokes.  Nothing is sacred as the writers lampoon politics, entertainment, sports, and just about everything else.  ""It's Buster Bunny Time"" is a parody of the old Howdy Doody show. ""Hollywood Plucky"" features caricatures of celebs such as Jack Nicholson, Mike Tyson, Pee Wee Herman, Cher, the cast of Star Trek, and Batman in one of the most hilarious episodes of the first season.

The voice talent was outstanding throughout, upholding a long Warner Bros. tradition.  While the Tiny Toons were certainly based on the Looney Tunes, each actor puts forth a tremendous effort to make their characters unique and not just a retread.  Particularly impressive was the animation.  While nothing might match the superior Warner Cartoons of the 1940s, the Tiny Toons were head and shoulders above the later Looney Toons and Merrie Melodies of the late 60s.  The success of Tiny Toons reinvigorated the Warner Animation studio and paved the way for futures shows Like Batman: The Animated Series, Animaniacs, and Pinky and the Brain.  Tiny Toons did an impressive job of holding up the long, proud lineage of Warner Bros. animation.",1233014400,2,2820,4.946921443736731

3172692,5,B0017INRGI,"I've been really happy with this collection and would highly recomend it for familys.  Also, this item is a must-have for any fans of Tiny Toon Adventures.  I think the studio is testing the marketability of this series, so hopefully more seasons will follow.",1223769600,,259,4.863636363636363
3172693,4,B0017INRGI,"I remember when this series first came out on weekday afternoons.  I enjoyed it immensely and found lots of laughs and fun stories.  Some of the humor is definitely dated to the early 90s, the culture and personalities of the day, but I think children, youths and adults can still find plenty to enjoy about it.  This series was essentially the beginning of a string of animated hits from Warner Brothers during the 90s television animation revival, roughly coinciding with Disney's launch of a high-quality series of television animated programs.  The writing and music were great, with some stories and characters more memorable than others.  This first volume features some of the most classic episodes that I remember best and most fondly.

However, the transfers on this set are rather poor.  Much poorer than those of Pinky and the Brain and Animaniacs volumes.  They look like transfers from old syndication tapes, the picture being somewhat soft.

Also, during this early period WB was farming out the animation work all over the world.  Most of the studios did good to very good work animating these programs.  Unfortunately one studio seemed to get a disproportionate amount of the work during these early days and did an absolutely terrible job.  Kennedy Cartoons animated and for all intents and purposes ruined large portions of these cartoons and even whole episodes.  How can I describe how unappealing their animation was?  Basically the guilty parties should be hunted down and punished.  How in the world they could receive the model sheets, do their sorry excuse for animation, look at the two in comparison and not see that their product looked like absolute garbage is beyond me.  The characters are consistently off model, with stupid ""cigar-chewing"" mouths, goofy hand posture, shuffling feet, look like they're squatting on the floor all the time, and bouncing incessantly.  To see this worthless junk animated over the lavishly painted backgrounds of this series is a bit disconcerting.  It's even more egregious, almost criminal, when Kennedy got their dirty mitts on classic characters like Elmer and Bugs for short segments, such as in ""Fields of Honey"".  I remember tuning in for re-runs of this show after school.  If I saw it was one of the episodes that looked like trash I'd just turn it off.

Mercifully Warner Bros got fed up with the crap Kennedy consistently produced and finally gave them the boot.  Later seasons and later WB series didn't suffer the indignity of being animated by those no-talent hacks.  Here's hoping for future volumes of this series that will feature better animated episodes on the whole and have even more fun memories.",1223683200,2,2681,5.029478458049887

3172704,5,B0017INRGI,"From Steven Spielberg, and some of the madcap minds and twisted talents that brought you ""Animaniacs""....

They're tiny, they're toon-y, they're all the little loonies !  That's right; the Emmy award-winning series ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" is finally out for the first time on DVD !  There are 35 cartoons of this breakthrough series on four fun-filled discs.  (And one of them is 2-sided !)

If you haven't lived through the '90s decade when they first appeared (That is to say if you're new to this show), I'd be happy to tell you about these Looney Tune wannabes of Acme Acres:

Buster Bunny - He's a laid-back blue rabbit who always plays it cool.  Whenever he's up against a problem, he gets to it Buster-style !
Babs Bunny - A spunky pink rabbit who is a close friend of Buster's.  Watch out; she'll do an on-the-spot impersonation or three that's rather dead on.
Plucky Duck - Like his ""Daffy"" counterpart, this little green duck tends to steal the spotlight no matter what trouble he's in.
Hamton J. Pig - Unlike his ""Porky"" counterpart, he's a neat-freak swine with a rather huge appetite.
Montana Max - Monty is your typical spoiled brat boy millionaire who actually has to BUY his way into friendship.
Elmyra - This gal just L-O-V-E-S animals and can't help but squeezing them to pieces.  (No, seriously, she does.)
Furrball - A hapless feline who looks for food and shelter, but he sometimes lives with Elmyra.
Sweetie - A cute little pink birdie who likes to egg on Furrball.  (Sometimes literally.)
Dizzy Devil - A pint-size Taz who eats practically everything in sight.
Gogo Dodo - One of my favorite characters, Gogo is a ballistic dodo bird who calls the bizarre Wackyland his home.
Li'l Sneezer - Don't judge this cutie by his size.  His sneezes pack a tremendous punch !
Shirley the Loon - She has phenomenal psychic powers that leaves her friends awestruck, yet skeptical.  (Especially Plucky.)

There are lots more characters in this show that I can't possibly include in this review like Fifi La Fume, Little Beeper, Calamity Coyote, Fowl Mouth, and Mary Melody.  You'll just have to see for yourself.  And with so many gags, funny takes, and the like, you'll be surprised how great this show is direct from their Looniversity.  Also look for the bonus feature ""From Looney Tunes to Tiny Toons"" where we get an inside look at the series.

So if you're a fan of Bugs Bunny or even the Warner Brothers and their sister Dot, get this set.  Hopefully, part two of this ridiculously long season will be released real soon.  Enjoy this until then !",1217548800,2,2562,4.691275167785235
3172705,3,B0017INRGI,"As a huge Tiny Toons fan I waited many long years for this in anticipation they would release it with the same high quality and interesting extras and packaging as other Warner Brothers animation.  See the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looney-Tunes-Golden-Collection-Vol-1-4/dp/B000J4QWKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looney Tunes: Golden Collection, Vol. 1-4</a>&nbsp;series for how good WB can do when they put in the effort.  This first Tiny Toons release apparently didn't warrant the same care, which is disappointing for us long-time fans as well as those willing to pay a premium for the 4 disc set.

There are precious few extras, disappointing for a series made in the heyday of the Amblin studio.  The DVDs menus are just straight ""click here"" links - no animation, no sound effects - again, disappointing for such a thoughtfully animated and written series.

Last, the cartoons themselves.  The DVD video transfer is amongst the worst I've seen for animation and in my DVD collection I have lots of examples for comparison.  Dirt, weak color and a low-quality transfer make this really hard to watch, particularly when I have such fond memories of the series.  The sound mix is good and the great classic cartoon orchestrations and sound effects come through well.

3172706,4,B0017INRGI,Don't get me wrong this is one of the greatest and funniest cartoons ever but my complaint is why didn't they do the episode selections like they did on the animaniacs dvds.

Mainly if there are any baby Plucky episodes.,1217376000,,390,4.283783783783784
3172707,4,B0017INRGI,"Picked up my copy today, and here's a rundown of my impressions of it.

The Bad:  The packaging is terrible.  Generic clipart drawn in that really kiddieafied style that was so common in the merchandizing back in the day

  DVD Menus.  Now, granted, the menus on the Animaniacs and P&TB sets were not fantastic, but they were not so hideous either.  The TTA ones are just as simple as those, but instead of some nice new artwork, they are presented over a screencap from an episode.

  Special Features:  Well, there is only 1.  The highlight of it is the introductory narration by Fowlmouth.  Then, it gets into a pretty generic rehash of what was so great about the Looney Tunes.  Spends about half its length on that without really saying all that much that we have not heard before.  Granted, Bob Clampett's daughter had a lot to say, and she did basicly say that TTA was good, and sorta implied that her father would have liked it.  (Take that, John K!)  Then, it finally gets into how LT inspired various parts of TTA, but in a not very in depth way.  There's some talk about how involved Steven Speilberg was, but again, nothing new about how it was said.  And then, there was Tom Ruegger...  I repeat my assessment that he's a modern day Leon Slessinger/Eddie Selzer.  He may have some talent, but like his LT predecessors, he has NO CLUE about the show he produced.  After going on at great length about how Looney Tunes were made for adults, he then goes on to say how they went out of their way to make Tiny Toons a show for little kids.  Did he ever even *watch* his own show?  Most annoying.  Finally, there was NOTHING on the voice work.  I hope there will be better features on subsequent sets.

  Episode Order:  Instead of arragining them in production order, which would put Hare Today Gone Tomorrow fist, they are arrainged in order of original airdate, meaning that The Looney Beginning is first.  Along with this ordering are all the strange continuity errors that can be so confusing that viewing them in production order clears up nicely.  (I wonder what this will mean for the Toons from the Crypt episode, which was never aired during the inital run, but only showd up when Nickelodeon got the show and aired them in production order.)

The Good:  The episodes are unedited.  This is a big one.  For example, the extra costume when Buster is first drawn in The Looney Beginning and Sweetie's audition are right where they are supposed to be, instead of missing like they were for most of the shows syndicated run.  There were even a couple of other very short clips in some of the epsiodes that I did not recognize, so it looks like we are getting an uncut set of episodes.

Now, don't get me wrong, the good far outweighs the bad.  I am just dissapointed that this show, the one that really sparked the whole Silver Age of Animation at WB, and in my estimation, everplace else as well, deserved a better presentation than the one it got.

Hopefully some of these shortcomings will be corrected in subsequent sets.

But I tend to doubt it.",1216857600,23,3064,4.516423357664234
3407034,5,B0017INRGI,"Tiny Toon Adventures has to be Warner Bro's best cartoon show ever. I too have waited a long time for this release and have finally had my prayers answered. I just wish they would sell these sets for a price that wouldn't suck our pockets dry. Of course that's not a problem if you're someone like Montana Max. And by the way, there are more volumes on the way, Season 1 Volume 2 will be released on April 21st and after that volume 3 will be the complete second and third seasons. This had to be the best of the Steven Spielberg Presents collection and now we can finally enjoy it when ever we want.

3407036,5,B0017INRGI,"I,ve waited for so long and it's finally here! The first volume of Tiny Toon Adventures on DVD! I remember Tiny Toon Adventures from my childhood back when I was a young lass. In case you are unfamiliar, Tiny Toons is about a second generation of young Toons who are kid-like versions of Looney Tunes. They attend a school called Acme Looneversity where the original Looney Tune characters are teachers. They teach Buster, Babs and the other Tiny Toons on how to become the 2nd generation of Toons and they earn a diploma of Lunacy when they graduate. If they're not at school, the young toons are out having adventures that are often parodies of popular movies, TV shows, comic books, etc. Tiny Toons like 80s and 90s cartoons and many other classics have true humor and absolutley none of the rotten toilet humor and idiocy that's in the horrible cartoons and animated films of today. Thanks to this and other DVDs, we can now have the classics with us forever. The humor in Tiny Toons is witty and often has parodies of popular TV shows and movies. This is one classic you may want to share with your family.

Tiny Toon Adventures began production when Warner Bros. reinstated its animation studio in 1980. It debuted in 1990 on Fox Kids and ended production in 1995. A major precedent was the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Tiny Toon Adventures is a witty show that often contained political and entertainment satire. Caricature versions of celebrities made frequent appearances, though were almost always voiced by imitators, and often appeared under parody names. Tiny Toon Adventures is a series that kids, teens and adults of all ages can enjoy.

This is defintely a recommendation for all DVD libraries.

All the episodes IN ORDER.  Done the right way.

Proof that The Studios DO LISTEN if you put enough pressure on.

Well done Warners.

But remember fans.  TTA Vol 1 needs your support.  Warners would not have
spent time and money putting it together if they hadn't considered the
potential sales first.

If TTA Vol 1 doesn't sell as many as they think, they'll be no Vol 2 or 3.

3407039,5,B0017INRGI,"Tiny Toons is easily the best animated TV show of the nineties. Although shows on the Disney Afternoon always have a special place in my heart, Tiny Toons is so witty and hilarious. Watching it as an adult is possibly more fun than watching it as a kid. For example: Who knew that the whole Buster/Babs plot-line of ""Tiny Toons: How I Spent My Summer Vacation"" is a parody of Deliverance???? I've been waiting for this to come out for years, and I'm so glad it finally has. It's about time!!

Season 1 was odd with a whopping 65 episodes.  Most likely it will be broken up into ""Season 1 Volume 1"" and ""Season 1 Volume 2"" DVD releases although Volume 2 hasn't been announced yet.

Fans are hoping the following will also be released on DVD:

Season 2 had 13 episodes

Season 3 had 20 episodes (which included the 30 minute ""It's a Wonderful Tiny Toon Christmas Special"" as an episode)

There were two hour long specials:
""Night Ghoulery""
""Tiny Toons Spring Break Special""

And a direct to video release:
""How I Spent My Vacation""",1208563200,68,560,4.54
3407041,5,B0017INRGI,"Fantastic!  Tiny Toon fans have been waiting for years to see this out on DVD.
For those not as familiar, Tiny Toon Adventures (TTA) was a weekday cartoon that came out in the early 1990s.  It's animation and story lines were wonderful, contrasted with the majority of poorer quality animated shows of the time.
The ""next generation"" of Looney Tunes (not baby versions of the originals), TTA kept what made toons fun, while leaving most of the old overdone formulas behind.  While enjoyable for kids, it also had a lot of jokes and references that made the show as much fun for adults as well.  In fact most of the people I knew who watched TTA were young adults, including myself.  But don't bother trying to convince the marketing people of that.  Fortunately the writers and animators knew their audience.
I've seen some box art for this elsewhere, and have to say I think they could significantly improve it, if going to be more appealing to its fans.  But don't let it dissuade you from checking the show out.
Overall one of my favorite cartoon series, and as much fun for us big kids as for the young ones.  I'm looking forward to having it on DVD!",1208044800,14,1154,4.541062801932367

3407043,4,B0017INRGI,"I remember when this show came out...loved it to the point where I still to this day can sing the theme song, and I haven't seen it probably since I finished high school.  So it's a bit different to watch this through grown up eyes, I've grown into a more peaceful sort and not nearly so amused by dropping anvils, etc. but it is still pretty cute and definitely has it's funny moments.

So I watched episode one with my daughter tonight and noticed that the closed captioning is way, way off.  Sometimes she and her papa like to leave the close captioning on so that he can read as he's watching.  It was pretty clear they had the text loaded up for an entirely different episode, I finally asked my angel to turn of the captioning (because she was holding the remote) because it was pretty distracting to be listening to one thing and reading something entirely different and making sense of both...headache inducing to do for longer periods of time that's for sure.  For me, the thing is, we don't need the close captioning, but others do, so I think this is an issue that needs to be looked into and resolved by the production company.  And that's the reason for the dropped star, not the falling anvils, or rolling coins with Monty's face as the case may be...",1497571200,,1265,4.454545454545454

My 8 year old who is more of a non- fiction, non- comedy type, like his daddy, watched. He liked it I think because of all the songs and learning they try to impose. For example, one episode teaches about the states, while another tells about Abraham Lincoln. Of course it is more comical than traditional teaching but still it gives the just of the matters.

The only thing we could really rely on watching these amazing cartoons again at the time is by holding on to tapes recording the broadcasts. Now I am relieved this is finally on dvd. However, Warner Bros.  waited just slightly too long to put it on dvd. Someone really close to me whom I love dearly passed away sadly within little over a mere year before Tiny Toons season 1 volume 1 came to be on dvd igniting the rest of the volume's releases. So the Tiny Toons dvds would get 5 stars but the inexcusable long wait on preserving this show into digital knocks it down 1.

3407111,5,B0017INRGI,"Buster appears from out of his burrow and introduces the viewers to Adventure Day on Tiny Toon Adventures. He then rushes off to Acme Looniversity, where he meets Babs outside of school and they open with a song, ""Oh, dear, Acme Looniversity. School of much hilarity. We say with much sincerity. Let us go home at ton.""
During class, many of the Tiny Toons are asleep at their desks, bored with their teacher, Elmer Fudd, who is demonstrating cartoon logic, such as walking on thin air. He walks off of his desk and does not fall to the ground, as he shows his class that they will not fall until they look down. Babs is at her desk, not paying any attention, as she doodles and dreams about being Queen Babs. Plucky is sitting at the desk behind her and pops her dream balloon with his pencil, complaining that she was blocking his view. Babs retaliates by sticking her tongue out at him.

The principal informs Elmer over the loudspeaker that his car is on fire (again), so Elmer tells his class to ""be vewy vewy quiet"" until he gets back and leaves the classroom. Babs mocks Elmer and snidely asks, ""Has he been using that line long enough, or what?"" The toons crack up hysterically, as Babs continues to poke fun at Fudd (in her Joan Rivers voice). Hamton informs her that Professor Elmer Fudd wanted them to be quiet, but Babs interrupts him and jokes, ""Every time opportunity knocks, the pig complains about the noise."" Buster peeks out of the door and notices a gloomy Elmer walking down the hallway (carrying his detached steering wheel, which is still smoking from the fire) and tells Babs that Elmer is on his way and that she had better cool it. Babs basically doesn't care, as she continues to do her shtick. She imitates Elmer Fudd as Elvis Presley, singing similar to Elmer and dancing and dressed as Elvis (wearing a wig that resembles Elvis' hairstyle). She then produces a sweat puddle, as Dizzy (wearing a shirt that reads ""Roadie"") spins up to her and hands her a towel. She wipes her face and hands it back to Dizzy, as he tosses it at Plucky's face, sending him smashing into the wall. Buster tries desperately to warn her that Elmer is back, but to avail, as she finishes her imitation (on top of Elmer's desk) with singing, ""Sometimes, I wonder what I'm a gonna do, but there ain't no cure for the Elmer Fudd blues."" A boiling mad Elmer grabs her by her wig and orders her to go the principal's office, while giving the rest of the class a pop quiz (who are distraught about this).

Babs (back in her normal outfit) goes to the principal's office, opens the door and looks inside, as he introduces himself as ""The Great and Powerful Principal of Looniversity"" (a giant, flaming green head similar to the wizard from The Wizard of Oz) and tells her to come in. He is angered that it is the third time this week that she has been sent to him. She gets on her knees, ""crying"" and ""pleading"" (actually giving one of her performances that The Great and Powerful Principal of Looniversity says will not work on him this time) that she was framed and is innocent. He tells her that she has to learn some self-control. He tells her that he is sending her home for the rest of the day, which delights Babs, who imitates Glinda the Good Witch with her response, ""There's no place like home."" He tells her that he is not amused and zaps a note in her hands, which is to be taken home to her mother.

Babs comes home and greets her dozens of siblings (all younger than her) before walking over to her mother (who is always only seen from the neck down) with the note. Babs' mother, who is bottle-feeding one of Babs' infant siblings, is upset that she was sent home from school again and dreads having to talk to the principal, as she hates it when he ""shoots that fire in the air."" Babs tries to explain how she was making fun of Elmer and the ""vewy vewy"" line that he always says, but her mother interrupts her by patting on her head and telling her that she needs to learn some self-control. She also tells Babs that it would be a good idea if she goes to her room and study, and that they will discuss school later. A distraught Babs goes to her room, turns on the television and plops down on her bed, believing that no one appreciates her.

A commercial is on, as a strange-looking fellow in a bow tie and checkered suit is asking the viewers if they are feeling down and if their life is less than grand. Babs lies back against her pillows and responds, ""Sheesh, it's downright bland."" He then ecstatically asks the viewers, ""Then, why not come down to... (pausing briefly as the human was just a costume, revealing Gogo to be the one wearing it) ...Wackyland?"" Gogo maniacally laughs and walks around in the air above the pathway leading to Wackyland. Babs is excited and remarks, ""Yeah, I'll run away to Wackyland!"" Gogo is now looking and speaking directly to Babs, as he happily responds, ""Good idea. They'll appreciate you there. They will. They will. They will."" Babs approaches her television set, looking directly at Gogo in front of the screen, and agrees with a ""Yeah!"" Gogo finishes the commercial with saying, ""This announcement paid for by the Wackyland tourist board."" He then reaches out from within the television set and turns the dial (which shuts it off), as he disappears and the screen goes to black. Babs thanks him out loud anyways and leaves her burrow.

She gets on her pink bicycle and pedals straight to Wackyland, mumbling about self-control and how everyone will realize how talented and terrific that she is now that she is gone. She arrives at the bridge that leads to Wackyland and hops on, but as she walks across, thunderclouds appear over her and there are many laughs, howls and other odd sounds that startle her. She decides to hold her head up high and chest out, hopping quickly across the pathway until she makes it inside (standing on top of one of the rock platforms that are floating in the air). In her John Wayne impression, she boldly states, ""It'll take a lot more than that to frighten me, pilgrim."" A blob-like creature appears from above her and growls at her, hanging upside-down and displaying his large and vicious teeth. Babs looks to the audience, as she points to the creature and remarks, ""It'll take something like that."" She screams and dashes for the exit, but everything suddenly disappears, as the scenery changes (with a spiral-shaped blue and white sky all around her) and Babs falls down to the shiny, blue ground right below her. There is a pyramid with an eyeball on it and a giant lady's shoe sitting in the background, as a huge mouth appears behind her, crazily states, ""Welcome to Wackyland,"" and laughs. Babs looks to the viewers again and says, ""I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.""

Babs is scared and hurdled up on the ground, as the mouth transforms back into his normal self, which is revealed to be Gogo Dodo (who was also the blob-like creature). He jokes, ""I like her, she's silly,"" and then introduces himself to her (while hanging upside down in the air). Babs is slightly annoyed and wonders why he screamed at her, as Gogo tells her, ""Seems like the wrong thing to do at the time"" (peeling a banana that a large chimp emerges from, which licks Babs and goes away). Babs grumbles, ""I see,"" as Gogo bumps into her and says, ""Lucky you. I can't see a thing without my glasses."" He proceeds to remove two glasses of water from his eyes and drinks one, giving Babs the other one (which she doesn't drink, but just holds onto). He wonders what brings a bunny like her to Wckyland, as she responds that no one appreciates her in Acme Acres and that she thought she would try living in Wackyland for a change. Gogo informs her that she will need someone to show her around, as he quickly changes into a tourist guide's outfit and puts Babs in tourist attire (complete with a camera and a lei). A chain link with two legs and feet is walking around, as Babs asks what it is and Gogo responds, ""A missing link."" A large, anthropomorphic pen rushes over to greet Gogo and offers to buy him lunch, as the wacky dodo hugs him and tells Babs that he is his ""pen pal."" Babs takes a picture and five small stones with hair on top of them go rolling by, as she responds, ""Oh, look. The rolling stones...and me without my autograph book."" A Warner Brothers logo is chasing a different WB logo with a mallet, smashing it as they run. Babs smiles and feels that she is going to like it in Wackyland.

After school, Buster, Plucky and Hamton go to her home, feeling bad for her for being sent home early. Buster finds a note next to her burrow and reads it out loud. It reads, ""Dear Buster, I have run away to Wackyland. It was the only mature thing to do."" Hamton is unpleasantly surprised, as he pulls down a chart of Wackyland and Acme Acres, explaining that much of Wackyland is uncharted cartoon wilderness. Buster is determined to find her, but Hamton does not want to go. Plucky informs them that they do not need to worry (pulling out an odd-looking device from his backpack), as he explains that he had been working on his ""lost rabbit detectometer device"" during shop class and that it will lead them right to her. He presses a button in the middle of it and it lights up, pointing and literally taking Plucky towards her location. Plucky yells for Buster and Hamton to follow him, as they are led to the bridge leading to Wackyland. Plucky holds back the device from taking him further and states, ""My brilliant invention tells me Babs is in Wackyland."" Buster pulls out Babs' note and responds, ""Her note told us that."" Plucky counters, ""Ridicule is the burden of genius,"" as the device pulls him quickly over the bridge with Buster and Hamton following closely behind.

They are led to an enormous, scary-looking tree with an entrance at the bottom of it. The tree's limbs resemble arms with long, eerie fingers protruding from them, as the holes in the tree's bark resemble a growling and evil-looking face. Hamton demands that he is not going in there, as Plucky feels that he does not have a choice, being taken through the entrance by the device. Buster tries to ease Hamton's nerves and tells him to wait outside, just in case Babs shows up, as he is going to go in and check things out for himself. Hamton nervously paces around, humming a Looney Tunes opening theme song, as an anthropomorphic briefcase (full of all sorts of items inside) approaches him. He suspects Hamton to be out of his environment, then asks if he is out of order (hanging an ""Out of Order"" sign around his neck), out of luck (handing him a giant four-leaf clover), out of circulation (forcing a newspaper in his hands), out of thin air (dropping a thin air canister on top of him) and out of season (shaking out salt on him from a giant salt shaker). He then questions Hamton on being out of bounds, but before Hamton can answer the puzzling question, he tells him that he has a 5-yard penalty and they will have to punt. A football (with legs and feet in brown shoes) forcefully kicks Hamton high into the air, as the briefcase responds, ""Hhheee's out of sight.""

Meanwhile, Gogo is ""fly fishing"" (using a large fly for bait, which holds up a sign that reads, ""Help Me!"") in a red stream that levitates above the ground, but Babs doesn't seem to find it humorous. She notices a gigantic fork that is stuck in the ground and jokes (in Valspeak), ""Gag me with a spoon. Is this like, what, the fork in the road?,"" as a large anthropomorphic eyeball (wearing a fedora and looking for something with a magnifying glass) passes by, to which Babs quips, ""Oh my gosh. Look at that. Must be a private eye."" This makes Gogo laugh and excited for Babs, telling her that she is getting the hang of Wackyland already.

Plucky is letting his device lead the way (as he is oblivious to close by signs that warn of a large hole that is ahead of him), but walks over a giant hole and suddenly realizes what he has done when he looks down. He falls through it, as the camera pans out and reveals the hole to be one of the black eyes of an enormous smiley face in space, which spits the green duck out of his mouth. Babs is laughing hysterically with a few of the residents (including the rolling stones, the pen pal, the missing link and a two-headed fellow that is wearing overalls and has no arms), as an anthropomorphic bucket full of dirt is pulling money out of the dirt and throwing it around. It hands Babs some cash and she responds, ""How nice. Paydirt. Thank you. I have always relied on the kindness of strangers."" The residents burst out in laughter, as Babs bashfully says, ""Stop! I'm not that funny."" An anthropomorphic fax machine walks to her and a fax prints out of it. The fax machine reads it out loud to her, as it states, ""We, the nutty natives of Wackyland, hereby invite you to a fancy-shmancy dinner at the Royal Palace."" Babs (imitating Katharine Hepburn) responds, ""Why, I'd be delighted to come. Really, I would."" The Wackylanders celebrate, as the pen pal yells, ""Three cheers for Babs."" Gogo approaches him with three chairs balanced on his finger and jokes, ""Three chairs for Babs."" Babs looks to the viewers and says, ""Pandemonium doesn't rain around here, it pours.""

Buster is walking down a pathway that is laying in-between rows of giant statues of feet, as he quips, ""Oh. These must be the foothills."" He notices a sign that reads ""Old Smokey"" and thinks that if he climbs up on top of Old Smokey, he might be able to spot Babs. He gets to the top, which has a large gray face protruding from the ground with a cigar in his mouth, puffing out large amounts of smoke into the air. Buster greets and asks him if he has seen a female bunny, to which the smoker's face bellows out a ""Nnnooooo"" from the side of his mouth, blowing a huge smoke cloud at Buster, which engulfs him and takes him into the air. Buster coughs and remarks, ""Someone alert the surgeon general,"" as he floats up into the air, passing by an enormous police office sitting on a large cloud and dunking smaller clouds (which are shaped like doughnuts and floating around) into his coffee (which is in a mug that reads, ""Cloud Cop"") and eating them. The cop grabs the cloud that Buster is in the middle of, but Buster halts him before he is eaten and says, ""Hey! Watch it, pal. I'm nobody's doughnut."" He then hops out of the cloud and falls through the sky, as suddenly Plucky (still falling from being spit out of the smiley face's mouth) and Hamton (still falling from the football's powerful kick) join him in the air. Buster is relieved and says, ""Fancy meeting you guys here,"" as Plucky responds, ""Yeah, nice of you to drop in."" They continue to fall (passing large film reels with stick figures on them, a giant open newspaper that is detailing the NASDAQ Stock Market on its pages and the moon in space), as they head straight for earth and land into a large cooking pot full of water.

Buster begins to bathe in the pot, stating, ""I generally opt for dry-cleaning, but what the heck,"" as a large anthropomorphic spoon approaches them. He is wearing a chef's hat and holding a pepper shaker, as he comments (with a French accent), ""Better to have ze hare in ze soup than ze soup in ze hair, no."" He then begins to shake the pepper into the pot, as most of it gets on Plucky, who wants to know what's the ""big idea."" He tells them that he is preparing dinner for the Queen, as she is having some friends over, and Hamton politely wonders who that could be. The spoon informs them that they are those friends and quickly slams the top of the pot over them. He snaps his fingers and two looney waiters unroll themselves out of a giant pig's tongue from within its mouth. The spoon quips, ""Dumb waiters"" (play on the word, ""dumbwaiter""), as he orders them to take the ""soup"" to the Queen.

Buster remains optimistic, assuring Plucky and Hamton not to worry, stating, ""I'm sure that the Queen is a kind, gentle, understanding...,"" but then gets interrupted by the Queens' demanding and angered voice, who yells, ""Where's my dinner?"" A startled Buster then finishes his statement by softly saying, ""Barbaric monster."" The waiters take the pot and drop it off in front of the Queen's throne inside of her palace, as she sits in silhouette with only her glaring eyes visible. The waiters remove the top, revealing a frightened Plucky and Hamton and a curious Buster. The Queen snarls, ""Feed me!,"" as Plucky and Hamton cling tightly to each other, scared for their lives, but Buster just calmly lies back against the pot and snacks on a carrot. Buster then scratches his chin, wondering who the Queen could be. The Queen yells out, ""Buster!,"" as Buster responds, ""Babs, is that you?,"" as the Queen pulls on a rope that lightens up the area and revealing herself to indeed be Babs. She is wearing a red and white crown that looks similar to a Jester's hat, a red and white fur coat and holding a rod with eyeballs. She is also surrounded by other Wackylanders, including Gogo (still in the tourist guide's outfit), the spoon chef, the private eye, the fax machine, the bucket of dirt and the pen pal (with red Looney Tunes opening title rings behind them).

Gogo tells them that Buster is incorrect and that she is ""Queen Babs, the first ruler of Wackyland,"" as he thanks them for playing the ""game"" and offers a parting gift (a giant comb). Babs tells him to zip it, as Gogo takes it literally, grabbing on a zipper that pops out of his mouth and zipping it up. She approaches Buster, Plucky and Hamton and informs Gogo and the Wackylanders that they are her pals and that she is very happy to see them. She assists Plucky out of the pot, who tells her that they thought she might be lost, or eaten alive by some slime-oozing creature (demonstrating by turning into a blob-like substance), torn limb from limb (demonstrating by ripping apart his shirt), but Buster interrupts him before he can carry on any further by clearing his throat and saying, ""I think she gets the picture."" Gogo responds, ""Picture! Did somebody say 'Picture?,'"" as he is holding a large anthropomorphic camera and slams it to the ground. He looks through the camera lens and has the Tiny Toons in focus for a group shot, but they are a little too far apart to get their full bodies in the picture, so Gogo pushes them closer together from each side, causing them to squeeze tightly against each other. He then squeezes them even tighter together by tying them up with rope. He takes off his hat and poses in front of them for the picture, seemingly telling them to say ""cheese,"" but was actually speaking to the camera, who responds, ""Cheese!"" Gogo slams Plucky's and Hamton's heads against the ground, as their eyes flash like a camera would flash when taking a picture. A picture pops out of Plucky's mouth as well as one from Hamton's mouth, as Gogo yanks them out and looks at them, which both are of the camera (with a big smile of his face).

Babs commands Gogo to stop acting silly, but he responds, ""I'm not acting,"" jumps into the air, makes noises like a siren and dashes off. Buster asks Babs how she is doing and she hops back into her chair and tells him that she is doing great. He asks if she is sure and she responds (with several of the other Wackylanders by her side and the pen pal continuously shaking her hand), ""Right as rain,"" as a raincloud suddenly appears directly above her and drenches her with heavy rain. He then asks if she is going to stay, which Babs responds that Wackyland is terrific (but then with an agitated look, pulls her arm back to release her hand from the pen pal's grip). Hamton sadly says that he is going to miss her, as she grabs him by the cheek and tells him that she will miss him as well. Buster coolly states that Acme Acres won't be the same without her (having his back to her and putting his hands into his fur on each side of his waist, which resemble pockets), as she informs them that they can visit her at any time. Plucky sarcastically responds, ""Sure we will,"" but then quietly tells Buster and Hamton that they should get going, as he doesn't want to find out what Wackyland is like after dark. He begins pulling Hamton and Buster across the red carpet to exit the palace, as Buster and a saddened Hamton tell her ""goodbye.""

They proceed to leave out the palace, as Plucky believes that Babs has it good, but Buster and Hamton seem doubtful of this. Plucky responds, ""What are you guys talking about? She's Queen. She's royalty. She's...,"" but gets interrupted by Hamton and Buster, who simultaneously say, ""Miserable."" Plucky looks back at Babs, who appears exhausted as she is surrounded by laughing and playful Wackylanders (the pen pal is continuously shaking her hand again while the private eye is shaking the other, the camera is hopping up and down and repeating the word, ""Cheese,"" several blue round dots float over to her and one says, ""Come on, dots, and do the polka,"" as they begin ""dancing"" in the air, the fax machine approaches her and says, ""The fax of the matter are irrelevant,"" as an elephant, the football and the two-headed fellow appear and the elephant asks, ""Did somebody call for an elephant?""). Babs has had enough of the constant insanity and endless jokes, as she yells, ""Stop! I can't take this anymore!"" She calms down a bit and explains, ""Look. You're all a lot of laughs, but you have to learn some self-control."" This causes her to remember Elmer, The Great and Powerful Principal of Looniversity and her mother (each appearing in their own separate bubble cloud around her) all telling her that she needs to learn some self-control (her mother's bubble cloud is under Elmer's cloud, which is preventing her to be seen from the neck up).

The Wackylanders are absolutely shocked at hearing this, as the fax machine prints out a fax for Babs regarding self-control. She takes the fax and reads it out loud, as it states, ""Article 9 of the Peanut Code strictly forbids the use of self-control while in Wackyland."" She is stunned to read this, as the pen pal angrily responds, ""Off with her head."" The Wackylanders surround and try to capture her, but she manages to escape their attempt (also losing the Queen attire and resorting back to her regular outfit) and tries to run away from them. They stay hot on her trail, chasing her through what appears to be underwater at the bottom of the ocean, but it turns out to actually be a picture reel that Gogo is turning, as they run out of it and into a room with 3 doors. Babs leads them into a hallway, but then quickly turns back the other way, trying to allude them. However, this doesn't work, as the Wackylanders are right behind her and ready to attack. She rushes over to the 3 doors and is confused on which one to choose, as the Wackylanders cheer for her and yell out different suggestions on which door to pick, or to ""take the money.""

Gogo approaches her (parodying a game show host, wearing a brown jacket and holding a microphone) and asks, ""So, what's it going to be? Door number one, door number two, or door number three?"" She chooses door number three and opens it, as a businessman with a contract tells her to ""sign right here."" She screams in terror and slams the door on him, as she states, ""My agent."" She then opens door number one, but there is another door right behind it. She opens that door, but there is another door that she has to open, which reveals the final door behind it. The door happens to be incredibly small, as Babs lies down next to it and opens it, peeking inside and noticing nothing but darkness. She looks back and sees the angered Wackylanders quickly approaching her, as she responds, ""Good thing I didn't have that carrot cake for dessert last night,"" and then narrowly escapes their clutches by squeezing though the door.

Meanwhile, Buster, Plucky and Hamton are back outside of the scary-looking tree, as the tiny door appears near them and floats over to behind Plucky. Babs (with an odd voice and from within the door) says, ""Knock, knock,"" as Plucky believes it was Buster or Hamton who said that and responds, ""NNaahh, cut it out. You know I hate those kinds of jokes."" Buster points to the door and tells him to look at it, then hurries over to it and opens it up. Babs pops out from the other side and lands on the ground, telling them that being Queen was awful and that she really missed them. She also says that she wants to go home, as the Wackylanders open up the tiny door from the other side and simultaneously respond, ""Fat chance! Stop her!"" Buster picks up Babs and informs them that it is time to get out of there, as they dash away from the Wackylanders, who are all snatching at her and fall from the door onto the ground.

The Wackylanders recover quickly and go after them, as the four Tiny Toons have made their way to a sign that reads, ""TO ACME ACRES,"" pointing to a nearby bridge that leads up to the apparent exit out of Wackyland. They approach the bridge, but it (and the sign) disappears before they can step onto it, leaving them at the edge of a cliff and nowhere to go. Hamton nervously says, ""Oh, no! How are we going to get out of here?,"" as Gogo suddenly appears (inside a portable information booth) and responds, ""The only way to get out of here is to leave the way you didn't come in.""

Buster asks, ""Well, we used the bridge to come in, so to get out, we can't use the bridge?"" Gogo remarks, ""Hhhmmm...could be,"" as the Wackylanders are almost upon them and they have to do something quick. Buster (remembering Elmer's technique of walking on air that he had taught them earlier in school) says, ""Well, it's worth a try,"" as he steps over the edge without looking down and doesn't fall. He tells the others to follow him, as Plucky and Hamton go next. Babs thanks Gogo and appears to be approaching him to give him a hug, but the wacky dodo responds, ""Aahh...don't mention it,"" then unzips the swirly purple and white background, waves to Babs, goes through it and zips it back up. She catches up to her friends, as Hamton reminds them, ""Remember what Professor Fudd said. Whatever you do, don't look down."" They walk through the air with their heads held high, as the hazy background changes back to the normal sky in Acme Acres, several feet above the bridge leading to Wackyland. The four of them fall onto the bridge, as they are relieved to be back home. Babs responds, ""Boy, I've learned my lesson. From now on, self-control is my middle name."" Some time later at Acme Loo, Elmer commends Babs on her newfound self-control, but as he turns his back, she can't resist taping a ""Laugh at the Monkey"" note to the back of him. She and the rest of her classmates snicker and laugh at the note posted on Elmer's back, as he wonders what is so funny. Babs shrugs and responds, ""I just can't help myself.""",1376870400,,26877,4.501229004506349

I DO NOT like having no choice but to be on-line to watch or play anything that I paid for. If I am in an area that does not have internet, I want to be able to access it! This instant video thing is a bad Idea! That was a bit too much money to pay for something that I can't fully download. Needless to say I am disappointed!

However, it's great to be able to watch the Tiny Toons videos again. Anyone that is a big fan of the series will love this one. I would just suggest buying the DVD set over streaming it.

The characters could be rude and crude, driving my mom crazy. It is one of my favorite cartoons! I eagerly awaited the DVD release from Warner Bros., in which I do love rewatching every episode, but the video quality could have been better, reminding me of VHS tapes.

3407153,4,B0017INRGI,"I'll be honest. I didn't grow up with the Tiny Toons like everyone else here. I never saw then when they originally aired, and I never saw them when they were syndicated. In fact, I only first heard about them a couple of months ago (before then, I only knew of their successor, Animaniacs). And now, I wish I had seen them when I had the chance on TV (not that it was totally possible, considering I was born in '96, and they ended in '95). For some reason, I can't get enough of their looney installments. The gags, the characters, and the animation--which is so fluid and colorful, it's just terrific--makes this show so great. I'm really hoping that Warner Bros. releases the final two seasons on DVD. I'll be waiting!
(The reason I gave this four out of five stars was because the last episode of disc 4B (""A Ditch in Time""), wouldn't play when I selected it. I was only able to see it through the 'play all' feature)",1317340800,,922,4.366279069767442

3407157,5,B0017INRGI,"I'm so happy to have this on dvd. This is the 2nd half of the 1st season, and it's worth every penny. I received it in the mail just yesterday so I haven't had time to watch all the episodes yet, but the one's I've seen so far bring back so many memories. I remember watching this everyday when I was a kid. The characters were great, the stories had morals and every day life lessons. Kids today don't get that from the new cartoons.

As far as quality of the picture goes...I have my dvd player hooked up to a 32inch LCD with the red/white/green/blue/yellow cables (I can't remember what kind they are) and the picture looks great. I didn't notice any dirt or lines in picture so far, I know some people can get nitpicky over that, but they don't understand that this cartoon was made with cels, an older type of animation process, and this is the best it ever will look. So don't expect HD high quality. I wouldn't hold my breathe for blu ray either. But still, the picture is great, nuff said.

Lastly for the packaging, It comes in a regular clear plastic case, with a cardboard slipcover. I was expecting a foldout same as the Animaniacs, but I like the case better.

If you enjoyed this show as a kid, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. This was one of the best cartoons of the late 80's to early 90's. This would also be great to give your children or grandchildren. I also ordered the the 1st half which hasn't come yet, but the last I've heard there are no plans to release seasons 2 and 3, which is a shame. Quite a few classic episodes in those seasons. But hopefully they'll be released in the near future. I hope you find this review useful in your decision. Get it, you won't regret it.

3407164,4,B0017INRGI,"When I got this set, I was very relieved to see that there were only single sided discs included.  Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed to see that there were absolutely no special features included on this set.

This set contains the remaining thirty episodes of the first season of Tiny Toons.  This set includes such classic Tiny Toons episodes as ""Career Oppor-Toon-ities,"" ""Ask Mr. Popular,"" ""Mr. Popular's Rules of Cool,"" ""Fairy Tales for the '90s,"" ""Tiny Toon Music Television,"" ""Viewer Mail Day,"" and ""You Asked For It Again.""

Overall, this is a decent set for what you get.  However, I do wish that some kind of bonus feature had been included in this set.

3407165,4,B0017INRGI,"This first volume set for the first season of Tiny Toon Adventures contains three single sided DVDs and one double sided DVD.  Personally, I fail to understand why it was decided to do a double sided disc instead of putting five single sided discs in the set.

The set contains thirty-five episodes and one bonus feature.  In addition to the first episode, you can see such classic Tiny Toon Adventures episodes as ""The Buster Bunny Bunch,"" ""Prom-ise Her Anything,"" ""Cinemaniacs,"" ""You Asked for It Part 1,"" ""Citizen Max,"" ""Buster and the Wolverine,"" ""You Asked for It Part 2,"" ""Fields of Honey,"" and ""A Ditch in Time.""

The bonus feature is ""From Looney Tunes to Tiny Toons - A Wacky Evolution!""  This is a documentary that runs for around 20 minutes, and contains interviews with several members of the production crew, as well as Ruth Clampett (the daughter of legendary Warner Brothers animator Bob Clampett).  The documentary talks about the origins of the original Looney Tunes shorts to how Tiny Toon Adventures came to be, and decisions that were made regarding the show.  It was an interesting documentary, and really gave an insight into what went on behind the scenes for Tiny Toon Adventures.

If you enjoy Tiny Toon Adventures, then this set is worth picking up and adding to your DVD collection.

3407167,5,B0017INRGI,"Just recieved my copy this morning and I was highly disappoited in the Packaging for Tiny Toons. Looks like hardly any effort was put into it. The set is not in a DVD boxset but in a single DVD case. Instead of overlapped discs, the discs are in thier own case, so you have to flip to get to them. The boxart is nothing special, something you could easily do in Photoshop. I'm certainly not a fan of flip side discs like for disc 4. It would have been better if they had just added a disc 5. There is also no artwork on disc 4 which means it will probably get easily scratched if you don't take care of it. There're these weird circular things on the front and back inside the DVD. Not sure what the point of that was for. For a great show, it definiely deserves better treatment and should've recieve the same treatment that Animaniacs had gotten.

On a good note, the episodes are unedited! The picture quality is still bright and colorful. Though there is still some grainy-blurry spots on them.

Besides the packaging, I'm super happy that it's finally out on DVD. It's been so long since I had last seen Tiny Toons. I don't think I will buy Season 1 Volume 2. Again, the packaging is just awful. I think I'll wait for a complete season 1 boxset and hope for better treatment.

3407175,3,B0017INRGI,"I used to watch this show back in my grade school days and was a big fan of Buster, Plucky and of course the inimitable Babs.  I'm glad to see it's finally on DVD for those of us who grew up on it to enjoy, as well as potential new fans who have never seen it.

That being said, I feel that Tiny Toon Adventures is not nearly as good as it subsequent series, Animaniacs: yes, Tiny Toon Adventures is fun and silly (much like the Looney Toon Cartoons) but at times it is simply too frenetic and slapstick for its own good (and believe me, I enjoy a dropping anvil or two . . . )

I would have liked to see more of the female characters in the series, especially Shirley Loon, who I feel pretty much steal every scene she is in.  Elmyra is a very interesting incarnation of Elmer Fudd and is voiced to perfection.  Babs, voiced BRILLIANTLY by Tress MacNeille, is simply the star of the show and can do no wrong (those Joan Rivers impersonations are a riot!) It must be said that all of the show's best episodes star Babs.  It's a pity the storylines for most of the female characters (with the exception of Babs) don't venture beyond standard ""female"" plotlines.

Also, though the show is called Tiny Toon ""Adventures"" there is in fact not much adventuring in the typical episode.  The major characters have their standard plotline and this is generally rehashed throughout (i.e. you know what will happen when Montana Max stars in an episode). Perhaps the writing would have been stronger if each storyline was a full episode, rather than three or four episodes per show.  (""How I Spent My Summer Vacation"" is remarkably well-written because it allows the writers ample time to develop the simultaneous storylines).

The show is rather kiddified (especially in contrast to the sly adult humor of ""Animaniacs"") which Tom Ruegger states was the intent of the show.  This doesn't mean that it won't appeal to adults . . . they're just clearly not the target audience.

I've pointed out mostly what I believe are the most glaring shortcomings of the show; that being said, I think it is still very watchable and enjoyable for anyone who grew up in the 90s or is a diehard Warner Bros. cartoon fan.",1243382400,2,2192,4.521518987341772
3407176,5,B0017INRGI,This is a great show. I am so glad they finally got it on DVD. The first one was ok but this Vol. has to be the better of the two.. highly recommended,1243296000,,150,3.5757575757575757
3407177,5,B0017INRGI,"Here it is: The second half of season one of Steven Speilberg's ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" is now on DVD !

With your hosts Buster and Babs Bunny - ""No relation."" - as well as a gaggle of original characters like Plucky Duck, Hamton J. Pig, Elmyra, Montana Max, Dizzy Devil, Gogo Dodo, and more, they'll take you on a whole mess of crazy adventures with 30 more episodes on 4 discs !

Ranging from how cartoons are made and a crash course in dating, to a talk show by Mr. Popular (Buster) and a crazy TV show lineup, it's never a dull moment in Acme Acres.  Of course, keep an eye out for a few of your favorite Looney Tunes characters in some episodes.  None of this zaniness would have been possible without their help at the prestigious Acme Looniversity.

With Buster's coolness, Babs' impersonations, Plucky's egotism, Gogo's wackiness, Elmyra's love of animals, Monty's money-grubbing selfishness, and much more, that's pretty much all you get in this set.  There aren't any special features or the like in there, but that's okay.  These episodes are some of the best I've seen in the '90s decade.  (Too bad THIS decade is almost over !)  Anyway, I hope the rest of the series, as well as the direct-to-video special ""How I Spent My Vacation"", will be on DVD soon !  Later, toonsters !",1241049600,2,1287,4.556521739130435
3407178,1,B0017INRGI,"I love Tiny Toon Adventures.  It's a great cartoon show, but this DVD set is an insult to any fan of the show.

I am not talking about the lack of special features or the rather generic packaging.  Those things can be overlooked.

Rather, I refer to the fact that this set contains EDITED versions of the show!

In the Tiny Toons Music Television episode the 555-Acme telephone number has been edited out!  This is an insult!  I paid good money for a DVD of a favorite show.  How DARE they cut out portions of the program, for ANY reason.  Warner Bros. should be ashamed of themselves for this offensive cut, and those responsible should be fired.

3407183,5,B0017INRGI,"In my opinion, Steven Spielberg's Tiny Toon Adventures, along with its follow-up show Animaniacs, were the very best animated comedy shows of the early 90s. I was delighted to see the first volume of Tiny Toon Adventures' first season coming to DVD, and of course the first volume left me eager for more. And very soon, on the 21st of April, 2009, the wacky world of Acme Acres, along with its cute, funny, loony characters, will be back with the remaining 30 fun-packed episodes of the first season! Tiny Toons never failed to make me laugh when I was a kid and they never fail to make me laugh now that I'm an adult. Tiny Toon Adventures is a show that's made in very good taste - it has really smart humor and nice cultural references, it doesn't have any dirty or obscene material, and as opposed to many modern TV shows that try to be funny by being dirty, Tiny Toon Adventures is very funny in a good, clean way. Tiny Toons has something for all ages - kids and teenagers will have a lot of fun and will actually learn some life lessons along the way (the show has some 'educational' episodes meant to bring a message to the children), while the adults will appreciate the smart humor and cultural references. And of course, everybody will appreciate the top-quality animation created by some of the greatest animation studios of the day (Tokyo Movie Shinsha, anyone?), will love the nicely drawn cute characters, each of which is well thought-out and has his/her own personality, and will adore the fun-packed stories in each of the episodes.

In case you're a fan of good, high-quality classic animation, or if you like animated comedy shows, or if you just like to have fun and if you have a good sense of humor, don't miss Tiny Toon Adventures! If you got the first volume of the first season, I'm sure you'll adore the second volume too, and if you haven't yet experienced Tiny Toon Adventures, it might just as well be a good idea to grab both volumes and prepare for a few days of fun and wackiness!",1234137600,21,2012,4.512328767123288
3407184,4,B0017INRGI,"Growing up in the 80s and the 90s make me thankful for I had grown up with many of the best animated cartoons, Tiny Toons being one of them. In many ways, the cartoons of the 80s/90s were the best for they had adventure, action, witty humor(and no toilet/rotten humor), good vs.evil emotion and personality. Shows like Tiny Toons and other shows of the 80s and 90s were made in very good taste - they had really smart humor and nice cultural references, they didn't have any dirty or obscene material, and as opposed to many modern TV shows, movies and animated films that try to be funny by being dirty, this show and other shows were funny in a good clean way. As a fan of Tiny Toon Adventures, I was pleased to hear about the second volume. I was happy with the first volume and hearing about the second volume has me excited. Fans of Tiny Toons, 80s/90s cartoons would be happy to hear of this volume. This set comes in 4 discs and contains the rest of the first season.

Tiny Toon Advenuters is about a generation of toon kids who attend a school called Acme Looniversity where Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes characters are teachers and teach them on how to become the second generation of toons. They're adventures are often parodies of movies, tv shows, comic books and other forms of popular culture. Tiny Toon Adventures is a witty show that often contained political and entertainment satire. Caricature versions of celebrities made frequent appearances, though were almost always voiced by imitators, and often appeared under parody names.

Tiny Toon Adventures debuted in 1990 and was shown on Fox Kids and later put into syndication. A major precedent for the series was the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This is one good show you may want to share with your kids and your family. I myself remember growing up with this show and those who also grew up with 80s/90s shows and Fox Kids will appreciate this. Tiny Toon Adventures is a series that kids, teens and adults of all ages can enjoy.

3407185,4,B0017INRGI,"Tiny Toons were not younger versions of Warner Bros. famous Looney Tunes characters but in reality they were the next generation of cartoon stars.  Developed by Steven Spielberg in conjunction with Warner Bros., Tiny Toons premiered in 1990, beginning in syndication and then moving to the Fox Kids network.

The opening toon is called ""A Looney Beginning"".  Those familiar with Warners classic cartoons will recall that they often broke down that imaginary wall between fantasy and reality, mixing their characters with their real life creators.  An animator (voiced by Steven Spielberg) is given until 9:00am the following day to come up with a new hit cartoon or else he's out of a job.  He works feverishly creating and throwing away ideas until those ideas take on a life of their own in the form of Buster and Babs Bunny.  Those two rascally rabbits actually end up as the real creators of Acme Acres and all its interesting characters including Plucky Duck, Hampton J. Pig, Dizzy Devil, and others.

These characters are all heavily influenced by Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tazz, and the rest of the Looney Tunes cast.  In fact, they are all instructors at Acme University, teaching their students how to be funny cartoon characters.  Some of the more original characters in the series include the loud, abrasive, and obnoxious Montana Max (Based on Yosemite Sam), Elmyra Duff (a female version of Elmer Fudd), and Shirley the Loon.

The four disc set includes 35 episodes in all, roughly a third of the entire series run.  While the show isn't as satirical and subversive as the classic Looney Tunes it does have its moments.  Kids will love the show but won't get the gist of all of the inside jokes.  Nothing is sacred as the writers lampoon politics, entertainment, sports, and just about everything else.  ""It's Buster Bunny Time"" is a parody of the old Howdy Doody show. ""Hollywood Plucky"" features caricatures of celebs such as Jack Nicholson, Mike Tyson, Pee Wee Herman, Cher, the cast of Star Trek, and Batman in one of the most hilarious episodes of the first season.

The voice talent was outstanding throughout, upholding a long Warner Bros. tradition.  While the Tiny Toons were certainly based on the Looney Tunes, each actor puts forth a tremendous effort to make their characters unique and not just a retread.  Particularly impressive was the animation.  While nothing might match the superior Warner Cartoons of the 1940s, the Tiny Toons were head and shoulders above the later Looney Toons and Merrie Melodies of the late 60s.  The success of Tiny Toons reinvigorated the Warner Animation studio and paved the way for futures shows Like Batman: The Animated Series, Animaniacs, and Pinky and the Brain.  Tiny Toons did an impressive job of holding up the long, proud lineage of Warner Bros. animation.",1233014400,2,2820,4.946921443736731

3407189,5,B0017INRGI,"I've been really happy with this collection and would highly recomend it for familys.  Also, this item is a must-have for any fans of Tiny Toon Adventures.

3407190,4,B0017INRGI,"I remember when this series first came out on weekday afternoons.  I enjoyed it immensely and found lots of laughs and fun stories.  Some of the humor is definitely dated to the early 90s, the culture and personalities of the day, but I think children, youths and adults can still find plenty to enjoy about it.  This series was essentially the beginning of a string of animated hits from Warner Brothers during the 90s television animation revival, roughly coinciding with Disney's launch of a high-quality series of television animated programs.  The writing and music were great, with some stories and characters more memorable than others.  This first volume features some of the most classic episodes that I remember best and most fondly.

However, the transfers on this set are rather poor.  Much poorer than those of Pinky and the Brain and Animaniacs volumes.  They look like transfers from old syndication tapes, the picture being somewhat soft.

Also, during this early period WB was farming out the animation work all over the world.  Most of the studios did good to very good work animating these programs.  Unfortunately one studio seemed to get a disproportionate amount of the work during these early days and did an absolutely terrible job.  Kennedy Cartoons animated and for all intents and purposes ruined large portions of these cartoons and even whole episodes.  How can I describe how unappealing their animation was?  Basically the guilty parties should be hunted down and punished.  How in the world they could receive the model sheets, do their sorry excuse for animation, look at the two in comparison and not see that their product looked like absolute garbage is beyond me.  The characters are consistently off model, with stupid ""cigar-chewing"" mouths, goofy hand posture, shuffling feet, look like they're squatting on the floor all the time, and bouncing incessantly.  To see this worthless junk animated over the lavishly painted backgrounds of this series is a bit disconcerting.  It's even more egregious, almost criminal, when Kennedy got their dirty mitts on classic characters like Elmer and Bugs for short segments, such as in ""Fields of Honey"".  I remember tuning in for re-runs of this show after school.  If I saw it was one of the episodes that looked like trash I'd just turn it off.

Mercifully Warner Bros got fed up with the crap Kennedy consistently produced and finally gave them the boot.  Later seasons and later WB series didn't suffer the indignity of being animated by those no-talent hacks.  Here's hoping for future volumes of this series that will feature better animated episodes on the whole and have even more fun memories.",1223683200,2,2681,5.029478458049887

3407201,5,B0017INRGI,"From Steven Spielberg, and some of the madcap minds and twisted talents that brought you ""Animaniacs""....

They're tiny, they're toon-y, they're all the little loonies !  That's right; the Emmy award-winning series ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" is finally out for the first time on DVD !  There are 35 cartoons of this breakthrough series on four fun-filled discs.  (And one of them is 2-sided !)

If you haven't lived through the '90s decade when they first appeared (That is to say if you're new to this show), I'd be happy to tell you about these Looney Tune wannabes of Acme Acres:

Buster Bunny - He's a laid-back blue rabbit who always plays it cool.  Whenever he's up against a problem, he gets to it Buster-style !
Babs Bunny - A spunky pink rabbit who is a close friend of Buster's.  Watch out; she'll do an on-the-spot impersonation or three that's rather dead on.
Plucky Duck - Like his ""Daffy"" counterpart, this little green duck tends to steal the spotlight no matter what trouble he's in.
Hamton J. Pig - Unlike his ""Porky"" counterpart, he's a neat-freak swine with a rather huge appetite.
Montana Max - Monty is your typical spoiled brat boy millionaire who actually has to BUY his way into friendship.
Elmyra - This gal just L-O-V-E-S animals and can't help but squeezing them to pieces.  (No, seriously, she does.)
Furrball - A hapless feline who looks for food and shelter, but he sometimes lives with Elmyra.
Sweetie - A cute little pink birdie who likes to egg on Furrball.  (Sometimes literally.)
Dizzy Devil - A pint-size Taz who eats practically everything in sight.
Gogo Dodo - One of my favorite characters, Gogo is a ballistic dodo bird who calls the bizarre Wackyland his home.
Li'l Sneezer - Don't judge this cutie by his size.  His sneezes pack a tremendous punch !
Shirley the Loon - She has phenomenal psychic powers that leaves her friends awestruck, yet skeptical.  (Especially Plucky.)

There are lots more characters in this show that I can't possibly include in this review like Fifi La Fume, Little Beeper, Calamity Coyote, Fowl Mouth, and Mary Melody.  You'll just have to see for yourself.  And with so many gags, funny takes, and the like, you'll be surprised how great this show is direct from their Looniversity.  Also look for the bonus feature ""From Looney Tunes to Tiny Toons"" where we get an inside look at the series.

So if you're a fan of Bugs Bunny or even the Warner Brothers and their sister Dot, get this set.  Hopefully, part two of this ridiculously long season will be released real soon.  Enjoy this until then !",1217548800,2,2562,4.691275167785235
3407202,3,B0017INRGI,"As a huge Tiny Toons fan I waited many long years for this in anticipation they would release it with the same high quality and interesting extras and packaging as other Warner Brothers animation.  See the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looney-Tunes-Golden-Collection-Vol-1-4/dp/B000J4QWKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looney Tunes: Golden Collection, Vol. 1-4</a>&nbsp;series for how good WB can do when they put in the effort.  This first Tiny Toons release apparently didn't warrant the same care, which is disappointing for us long-time fans as well as those willing to pay a premium for the 4 disc set.

There are precious few extras, disappointing for a series made in the heyday of the Amblin studio.  The DVDs menus are just straight ""click here"" links - no animation, no sound effects - again, disappointing for such a thoughtfully animated and written series.

Last, the cartoons themselves.  The DVD video transfer is amongst the worst I've seen for animation and in my DVD collection I have lots of examples for comparison.  Dirt, weak color and a low-quality transfer make this really hard to watch, particularly when I have such fond memories of the series.  The sound mix is good and the great classic cartoon orchestrations and sound effects come through well.

Mainly if there are any baby Plucky episodes.,1217376000,,390,4.283783783783784
3407204,4,B0017INRGI,"Picked up my copy today, and here's a rundown of my impressions of it.

The Bad:  The packaging is terrible.  Generic clipart drawn in that really kiddieafied style that was so common in the merchandizing back in the day

  DVD Menus.  Now, granted, the menus on the Animaniacs and P&TB sets were not fantastic, but they were not so hideous either.  The TTA ones are just as simple as those, but instead of some nice new artwork, they are presented over a screencap from an episode.

  Special Features:  Well, there is only 1.  The highlight of it is the introductory narration by Fowlmouth.  Then, it gets into a pretty generic rehash of what was so great about the Looney Tunes.  Spends about half its length on that without really saying all that much that we have not heard before.  Granted, Bob Clampett's daughter had a lot to say, and she did basicly say that TTA was good, and sorta implied that her father would have liked it.  (Take that, John K!)  Then, it finally gets into how LT inspired various parts of TTA, but in a not very in depth way.  There's some talk about how involved Steven Speilberg was, but again, nothing new about how it was said.  And then, there was Tom Ruegger...  I repeat my assessment that he's a modern day Leon Slessinger/Eddie Selzer.  He may have some talent, but like his LT predecessors, he has NO CLUE about the show he produced.  After going on at great length about how Looney Tunes were made for adults, he then goes on to say how they went out of their way to make Tiny Toons a show for little kids.  Did he ever even *watch* his own show?  Most annoying.  Finally, there was NOTHING on the voice work.  I hope there will be better features on subsequent sets.

  Episode Order:  Instead of arragining them in production order, which would put Hare Today Gone Tomorrow fist, they are arrainged in order of original airdate, meaning that The Looney Beginning is first.  Along with this ordering are all the strange continuity errors that can be so confusing that viewing them in production order clears up nicely.  (I wonder what this will mean for the Toons from the Crypt episode, which was never aired during the inital run, but only showd up when Nickelodeon got the show and aired them in production order.)

The Good:  The episodes are unedited.  This is a big one.  For example, the extra costume when Buster is first drawn in The Looney Beginning and Sweetie's audition are right where they are supposed to be, instead of missing like they were for most of the shows syndicated run.  There were even a couple of other very short clips in some of the epsiodes that I did not recognize, so it looks like we are getting an uncut set of episodes.

Now, don't get me wrong, the good far outweighs the bad.  I am just dissapointed that this show, the one that really sparked the whole Silver Age of Animation at WB, and in my estimation, everplace else as well, deserved a better presentation than the one it got.

Hopefully some of these shortcomings will be corrected in subsequent sets.

But I tend to doubt it.",1216857600,23,3064,4.516423357664234
