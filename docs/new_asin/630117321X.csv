8026682,4,630117321X,It's not Uncommon Valor or Rambo but I liked this one.  Another blast from the eighties.  Both Katt and Brown were quite good in their respective roles.  One reviewer thought Katt was mis-cast but I didn't think so.,1523664000,,215,4.605263157894737
8026683,5,630117321X,"WHITE GHOST is an interesting little copy of RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, starring William Katt (!) as the titular character, a soldier left behind in the jungles of Vietnam and who has been waging a war against the Vietcong ever since. A rescue mission is sent in to bring him home, but the leader of the squad has other ideas. Although obviously inspired by the Stallone flick, this B-movie isn't too bad at all. The action is gruesome and has a kind of nihilistic viciousness that seems to be inspired by PLATOON. Katt is miscast as the tough guy but he's not too bad and his performance is amusing at times. There's a wealth of action in the story and the usual elements of the genre, from cruel Vietnamese captors, torture, prison camp interments, jungle traps, betrayals, jeep chases and mucho grenade throwing. This film was shot in Zimbabwe, somewhat unusually, which lends some authenticity to the backdrop. Watch out for Reb Brown's hilarious cameo!",1523145600,,958,4.77710843373494
8026684,1,630117321X,"The best part of this movie was reading the reviews you people left before me.
There's nothing left to say",1522886400,,106,4.35
8026685,2,630117321X,"It gets two stars because it is soooooo bad it made me laugh.  Seriously, this movie is terrible.  Stop watching immediately and rent Tropic Thunder.  Even if you have to spend $16.00.  It will still be cheaper than the multiple therapy sessions it will take to wipe this movie from your memory.",1521504000,,295,4.615384615384615
8026686,5,630117321X,I just watched the Code Red Blu-ray of this film. It's actually the UNCUT version of this film it runs about 5 minutes longer and it had a lot of gore and extra violence.,1459641600,,170,4.029411764705882
8026687,1,630117321X,"THE ONLY REASON I AM NOT RATING THIS VIDEO LOWER IS BECAUSE 0.01 IS NOT AN OPTION.  AT 0.69 PER COPY, THIS VIDEO IS WAY OVERPRICED.  THIS IS FAR AND AWAY THE STUPIDEST MOVIE THAT HAS EVER BEEN MY MISFORTUNE TO SEE.  EVERY CLECHE THAT WAS EVER DREAMT UP ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR IS IN THIS MOVIE.  WILLIAM KATT, PLAYING THE PART OF AN OFFICER WHO'D BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN VIETNAM FOR FIFTEEN YEARS,IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF SORROWS FOR ANYONE BRAVE ENOUGH TO SIT THROUGH THIS STINKER.",1139702400,2,476,4.375
