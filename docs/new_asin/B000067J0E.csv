7963168,5,B000067J0E,This is a wonderful documentary which spans quite a long time although the film itself is fairly short. It gives important information while focusing on the AMAZING Mozu. Fantastic.,1169683200,3,181,5.275862068965517
7963169,5,B000067J0E,"This is my favorite of everything George Page has ever done:  the story of a snow monkey with deformities overcoming challenges not only to survive but also flourish in the harsh environment of her home.  In addition to Mozu's touching tale, other aspects of this film are also very beautiful including the lovely scenes of ice, snow, thermal pools, and Mozu's babies.  George Page's ""grandfatherly"" narration compliments the writer's excellent storytelling and is a wonderful tribute to Mozu's extraordinary life.  Highly recommended.

7963170,5,B000067J0E,"There are so few movies about monkeys that finding one is a real treasure.  There are lots of movies about apes - chimps, gorillas, and orangutans, but movies devoted only to monkeys are few and far between.  But what's even better is the masterful direction in Mozu.  Well paced, well thought-out and well put together, this movie is shaping up to be a classic.
The movie is built around a hook, which is the biography of one resilient Japanese macaque, whom they name Mozu.  Although it feels gimicky, having one central character is the most effective route I have seen into the primate world.  But the writers/directors don't force the movie to be only about Mozu - the let the macaque world happen, using Mozu as an anchor.
But the most important thing is that the movie makers succeed in getting lots and lots of different footage of lots of interesting events in the macaque world.  Snowy weather, bathing and swimming, tree climbing, social interaction and lots of grooming.
I have enjoyed watching this movie many many times, and I always get something new from it.  I just with there were more monkey movies out there.",1058832000,15,1128,4.724489795918367
