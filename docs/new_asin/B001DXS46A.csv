8295455,5,B001DXS46A,"A very important piece of American history. An ideology that is not dead today in the 21st century
It must be seen and viewed for what it is. It creates hate. It is outlaw vigilantism covered under the auspices of what some believe is White America but to extremism. I have personally seen and heard people like this and as a white American of biracial parents it's an embarrassment. That is why we fought against facists racist and nazis in WWII. We do not need extremist rhetoric to make and keep America free. We are a land created by immigrants. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and to be heard but not at the expense of becoming insane fanatical criminals when we hunt people down and extinguish lives for no reason other than saving ones ideals. Makes a mockery out of our freedoms",1509408000,,792,4.545454545454546

8295458,5,B001DXS46A,"this very good documentary focuses on White Supremacist movements such as the Aryan Nations and even goes back to the German-American bund days during the latter 30s. I am a history (mostly the World Wars) buff but I also like to study extremism of all kinds. Viewing the first few minutes was very intimidating for me. If you are interested in this sort of thing or are doing some kind of college project I highly recommend this for your studies, this is the best film documentary of neo-Nazism I've ever witnessed. Maybe even the only one out there.",1441411200,2,551,4.63265306122449

8295461,4,B001DXS46A,"It is really horrifying the sort of stuff you see in this DVD.  I thought that the KKK was bad, but the Nazi's in this country are practically kissing cousins to them.  It is an excellent DVD and very well made, just like virtually everything put out by the History Channel.  If you purchase one DVD this year, this is the one.",1269993600,16,327,4.241935483870968
