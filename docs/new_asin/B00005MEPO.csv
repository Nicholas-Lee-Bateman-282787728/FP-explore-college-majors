1625558,5,B00005MEPO,"Another reviewer of this documentary writes:
""Unwieldy and suffering from attention deficit disorder, his facades scream in contrast to the environs. Windowless and cold, you wonder how the interior can display such a warmth and balance. The outside and inside simply cannot the be the same building. This, to me is the essential dichotomy of this film and his personality. ""
I refer this reviewer to ""The Fountainhead"" by Ayn Rand for an indepth explanation of the rational purpose behind this ""essentail dichotomy.""",1028764800,,517,5.240963855421687
1625559,3,B00005MEPO,"Ken Burns managed not to annoy me with this documentary as he has done in the past with other documentaries. It serves as a good overview of FLLW's life and career. But one is left thinking there could have been something a little extra that could have made this the definitive documentary on this icon of the 20th Century.
My initial reaction is that the footage of Wright's building was superbly done, but the documentary would have been served with more of this footage...and especially, more footage of different buildings and not just the famous ones. Also, there is not a lot of effort to show exactly *why* Wright was a great architect. His main philosophy of design is covered, but not those small details that propel his buildings from the above average to the extraordinary. Instead, more attention is paid to his life, which admittedly also makes for a great story.
This documentary is worth owning, but only to suppliment your collection of Wright books and videos (if you're so inclined as to have a ""collection"" like I do!).
One other note: I expected the picture quality on this DVD to be of higher quality than it was. The rich colors of the footage are sometimes compromised by a coarse sampling rate (blocks of pixels becoming visible...especially in darker scenes). A higher rate of sampling would've served the DVD much better, even if it would have required two discs.",1017360000,21,1389,4.791666666666667
1625560,5,B00005MEPO,"This DVD provides a comprehensive, objective, and compelling look at one of the greatest architects ever. I was especially surprised to learn more about Wright's fallibility and the tragedies that touched his life. This is Ken Burns storytelling at its finest. Some good DVD extras, too.",1006214400,,287,5.260869565217392
1625561,5,B00005MEPO,"Often the best way to experience any architecture is to be there in person, but if that is not possible, then this film would be the next best thing to give you that exhilarating feeling you would get from experiencing Wright spaces. The cinematography is exquisite, the interviews and stories are inspiring, Wright's work is captured beautifully on film. True, this film is not the a study guide to Wright's architecture. It will not show you floor plans, sections for every building discussed in the film nor will it give you the secrets of Wright's design process, but it does allow you to see much much more than a book can. Frank Lloyd Wright's work is very much entwined with his legend, his personality, his vision, his upbringing, and his dogged determination to be the best ever architect. The boldness of his innovations, his contant reliance on nature for inspirations, and his genius in sythesizing all these are all wonderfully captured on film. This video is a must see!",1004227200,11,984,4.828402366863905
1625562,2,B00005MEPO,"Ken Burns doing Frank Lloyd Wright. Expectations among fans of Wright's work were very high. But Burns fell woefully short in capturing the essence of the man and in explaining what makes his architecture great (and what makes the ideas behind it still relevant today). Instead, he spent too much time delving into personal scandals, as if the docu. was being made for the commercial networks rather than PBS! A mediocre effort.",1003190400,3,428,4.958333333333333

7945485,5,B00005MEPO,"In watching this marvelous documentary on the life and career of Frank Lloyd Wright I was reminded of an equally unpleasant creative artist.  After Robert Frost spent several days of abusing and attempting to humiliate the poet Archibald McLeish, the historian Bernard DeVoto told him, ""Robert, you are a great poet, but a bad man.""  Contrary to one myth, not all geniuses are jerks.  Marcel Proust was exceedingly quirky, but by every account he was a generous and caring friend.  Albert Einstein was by accounts a remarkably nice person, Vladimir Nabokov, though a brute in reviews (known as Vlad the Impaler), was in ordinary life a kind and goodhearted soul, while William Carlos Williams was not only a great modern poet, but a thoroughly decent human being.  But there are enough people like Frank Lloyd Wright, Picasso, Beethoven, and James Joyce to keep alive the myth of Genius as Jerk.  Wright certainly did his share to feed into this myth and the documentary doesn't try to mute this aspect of his life.  He was just not a very nice person and had he not been a great architect we wouldn't want to know anything about him.  Apart from his work his was an ugly life.  But he was also a stunningly gifted and prolific architect.  I've never heard anyone address the question of which architects in history had the largest number of buildings constructed, but I could easily believe that the crown belongs to Wright.  I first saw a Wright designed building when I lived for a year in Louisville, KY and had a striking looking bank building pointed out as a Wright design.  I also visited the Guggenheim in NY when living in New Haven for several years.  I was never impressed by the art collection it was designed to display, but the building itself I found to be stunning.  My closest encounter with Wright came when I moved to Chicago to attend the University of Chicago and my route home took me each time directly along the Robie House, usually considered one of his two or three most important designs.  For several years, for instance, AIA members voted it the second most important structure from an architectural standpoint in America, surpassed only by Wright's Falling Water.  Yet, the Burns's documentary gives virtually no attention to the Robie House, although they do show it briefly.  This is probably my only major complaint, the near complete neglect of one of his most highly regarded designs (notwithstanding that it is the one I know best).

Through Wright's life is unpleasant at almost every point to contemplate, his architecture from beginning to end is utterly exhilarating.  More than any architect I know, whenever I see either in person or on film or in print any of his designs, I am seized with a desire to inhabit that space.  When I see a Mies van der Rohe design, I have the opposite reaction.  The spaces designed in the International Style I rarely find inviting, inspiring, warm, or welcoming.  Wright's spaces, whether public or private, always are all of these things.  The documentary does a great job of showing many Wright spaces, photographing them in ways that show how the spaces work, and from angles that are especially revealing.

I do think that the documentary would have helped by looking at more buildings, especially the Prairie style homes (such as the Robie House, which is shockingly relegated to a bit part).  But much else also is left out.  Wright was as much a designer as an architect, yet while his furniture and windows are seen in a myriad of shots, there is virtually no mention of his thoughts about design.  Also, there was very little in the way of valid criticism of his work.  Anyone who has known first hand any Wright structure knows that they are, as a rule, very poorly constructed.  Most of his works have had to be rebuilt or at least corrected.  The film does talk of the severe leaking of the roof that was experienced after the completion of the Johnson Wax Headquarters.  Almost all of his designs have had the same problem.  One of the critics on the show talks of Wright being a great engineer, and on the macro level perhaps that is true.  But on the micro level, he simply didn't seem to have a grasp of how to put things together.  Just one example from my own experience.  If you walk along the long exterior wall that lines the Robie House one will be stunned to see how crooked it is.  It wriggles like a snake.  I have read that Falling Water has been similarly plagued with structural problems.  Yet apart from the Johnson leaky roof, almost no mention is made of any of this.

Reading some of the reviews below, I have to express some bafflement that so many seem surprised that the documentary focuses so much on Wright's life.  The title of the documentary is FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT, not THE ARCHITECTURE OF FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT.  I'm not being pedantic.  Only in the second case should one be surprised that so much was said about his life.  In the former case I would have been astonished if they left all the biographical details out.  I think much of the problem here stems from two sources.  First, many want this to be the documentary that they anticipate seeing, not the one that Burns actually made.  Second, much of the problem is that there is a massive gap between the quality of Wright's work as an architect and the quality of his life as a human being.  As DeVoto might put it, he was indeed a great architect, even if he was a bad man.",1129852800,10,5445,4.629822732012513
7945486,2,B00005MEPO,"I bought this dvd thinking that I wanted to see homes that Frank Lloyd Wright built, but this dvd does that no justice.  This is a documentary of Frank Lloyd Wrights life, not a movie about his work.  I do not suggest buying this unless you want to know about the man, not his work.",1104796800,6,282,4.109090909090909
7945487,5,B00005MEPO,"This biography of Frank Lloyd Wright is a fascinating story.  He was the most celebrated American architect of his day.  He felt a house should be one with nature, to compliment it.  His homes gave a distinctive feeling of spaciousness; and he believed an architect's primary purpose was to build dwellings that people delighted in living in - and not just looking at.
Scandals tainted his ""first life"" and probably contributed to his lack of major commissions.  But his career took flight when, at sixty-two, he married a woman who, for once, was his intellectual equal.  She was totally devoted to him and had him write an autobiography and begin a school of architecture.  The exposure led to new clientele - and to his most significant creative achievement - the Guggenheim Museum in New York, which took thirteen years to build, and was completed six months after he died.
Frank Lloyd Wright thought very highly of himself, of his own abilities, and of his contribution to the advancement of mankind's existence.  His self-confidence drove him to push the edges of the envelope - for his entire life.  His vision was infectious.  Clients would recall fondly that working with Mr. Wright, while he was designing and building their homes or offices, would be the highpoint of their lives.
Mr. Wright's accomplishments are a testament that life - and living - are not bounded by age; and that divine ability can sometimes lead to greatness.
This is easily one of Ken Burns' best works, and I couldn't stop watching it!",1055376000,6,1520,4.8604651162790695
