8060348,4,B0009GV9CI,"I bought this DVD after seeing this opera in the theater.
The cast is outstanding: The main characters, Renato Bruson as Nabucco and Ghena Dimitrova as Abigaelle were in the peak of their careers playing a very difficult role that require not only a powerful voice with a big range  but they also have to be very good actors which they are. The rest of the cast, even the smallest roles were also very good as well as the chorus who played a very important part in this opera.
My mayor concern was that the overture wasn't played considering that this opening is very important to get immerse in this beautiful music. Overtures are part of any opera, besides it is a very enjoyable music, even though its heard in different parts of the performance and is important to get in the mood since the beginning of the show.
I didn't like the costumes so much, but the rest of the setting was very good.
The sound was acceptable.
Although the music and singing were great Im giving this DVD a rating of 4 because of the overture omission.",1396656000,3,1031,4.455026455026455
8060349,2,B0009GV9CI,"This inexplicable staging is worthwhile if you need a good laugh, although the singers deserve top marks for their ability to keep straight faces through endless indignities as well as their admirable vocalism.
In director Barrie Koskie's interpretation, taxidermy was a major theme, with a stuffed monkey glued to Fenena's shoulder, a boa constrictor coiled around the High Priest and huge tiger heads serving as shoulder pads on Nabucco's mantle.  Other costumes seem to have come from the wardrobe of a 1920s lunatic asylum for singing cricket players.  Their discarded shoes were piled high in one scene, and white uniforms were only relieved by black pleather smocks for the Hebrews and a few sequins for the ladies.  Green neon creatures hovered over several scenes, and the Biblical quotes on which the opera is loosely based were handed out, word by English word (it was sung in Italian) from trapdoors.  Nabucco was encaged in a puppet stage, the one reference which I was able to decipher. (Puppet king, right?).

Eurotrash has lost only its scatological references in this transition to Down (pretty far down) Under.  But I recommend you buy the CD, unless you are a collector of the curious and already own one of the excellent other DVDs.  My favorite is the Met/Levine version, in which Maria Guleghina RULES.  It should be called ""Abigaille"".",1291161600,,1357,5.026785714285714
8060350,3,B0009GV9CI,"Un Nabucco petit format qui ne cherche pas  jouer la concurrence avec les moyens du MET ou de la SCALA, mais qui s'impose par son originalit et sa mise en scne un peu ""clownesque"" o l'histoire ancienne est replace dans un contexte distanci qui laisse place  une vritable motion lorsque le hros, emprisonn, laisse percer toute la vulnrabilit du pouvoir.
Jonathan Summers campe un Nabucco pris au pige de sa propre ambition, et sa dploration est traduite d'une faon remarquable,  la manire des hros manipuls, qui croyaient pouvoir toucher la puissance divine sans faire fondre leur maquillage de ""tragic circus"".",1216512000,4,610,5.08
8060351,3,B0009GV9CI,"Well, here it is.  The video that introduced Dimitrova to many in the wider operagoing public.  She could sing Abigaille in her sleep, it seems, although the sound here does not appear to capture the extreme high notes well.  They sound squealy and thin (compare this to the La Scala video of 5 years later where no such problem exists).  Bruson is his usual strong self.  ""Dio ti guida"" is especially compelling.

The video quality is subpar--unfocused and tending to dull everything out.  The Dimitrova Turandot of two years later looks much better, and Dimitrova sounds better there too--the video producers must have learned a few things about taping in the Arena.

But, other than Dimitrova and Bruson, what this video will most likely be remembered for are the bizarre costumes, which make the cast look like Byzantine chess pieces with awkward pointy headdresses and bulky, shiny plastic armor in primary colors through which the singers spindly limbs protrude unprepossessingly.  The tenor who sings Ismaele is made up to look particularly unflattering.  And the female chorus members all have swami headdresses and broad-striped muu muu-looking garb.  Maybe this all read well in the arena, but here it looks preternaturally odd and clunky.  The La Scala Nabucco of 5 years later is infinitely more stylish and appealing (a Byzantine cobalt-blue dream landscape concocted by Maxfield Parrish--a novel choice for Nabucco, perhaps a visual antidote, smoothing out its crude vulgarity).  If not the winner of the all-time ugliest opera production sweepstakes, then this 1981 Verona Nabucco is definitely a runner-up.",1129507200,16,1622,5.24031007751938
8060352,1,B0009GV9CI,"I quit after the first act
it was that dull ,pathetic,
and lackluster
 even the audience was sitting on its hands
and that is a sure indication of a sorry lemon
save yourself the dissapointment
 look for another perfomance",1027555200,8,222,4.666666666666667
