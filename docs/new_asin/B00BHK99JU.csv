5621248,2,B00BHK99JU,"I waited with anxious anticipation to see this film.
What a major letdown!
Tom Hanks' involvement doesn't do much, if anything, to help this poorly done effort.
Just makes you wonder why he even bothered.
If you are a Lincoln buff you should give this a definite miss.
It pales in comparison to almost anything else I've ever seen on Lincoln, except for maybe Tad, a made for US TV film done about 20 years or more ago where Kris Kristofferson portrayed the man.
I'm not even sure if it was ever released commercially.
No loss there.
Back to the point - Killing Lincoln does it's best to do the same to the genre.",1370390400,2,613,4.385964912280702
5621249,4,B00BHK99JU,"I know very little about the assassination of Lincoln, so watching this I learnt a lot. I particularly like the way the film could  blend in well the recreation and the historical data almost seamlessly. How accurate it is, I am not sure, but it appears to have a ring of truth about it.

The filming is good, the acting reasonable, although I do not think, it is that good; the narration is very well done by Tom Hanks.

I found it very absorbing",1370131200,,447,4.2976190476190474
5621250,2,B00BHK99JU,Saw this on tv. The reenacting was great - would have been better by itself without the constant interruption by Tom Hanks.,1365120000,7,123,4.636363636363637
5621251,4,B00BHK99JU,"This is an interesting and inisightful film that pays attention to historical detail.  At times, it leaves you wishing for more information as to how much help some of the peripheral characters gave Booth in his escape and gives relatively little information about how the army found Booth.  It was an accurate and entertaining look from a different perspective.",1362700800,6,362,5.11864406779661
5621252,3,B00BHK99JU,"Yes Tom Hanks did a creditable job but this portrayal of the Lincoln Assassination was like watching Reality TV ,flashy but lacking substance, which is not surprising considering what the executive producers did to Gettysburg.
""You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.""

In my opinion  better productions are ""The Conspirator "" , produced by Robert Redford or "" The Day Lincoln Was Shot""  starring Rob Morrow as Booth and Lance Henriksen as Lincoln .

I have read that Mr. Hanks is working on a Mini-Series about the 8th Air Force in WWII using the excellent Masters of Air by Donald Miller .",1362182400,7,683,4.528455284552845
5621253,5,B00BHK99JU,"This docu-drama was outstanding!  I can't imagine all the research that was done to make this possible.  All of the additional historical information that was presented was fascinating. The actors were amazing!  The best thing about this program was it gave the facts shown and narrated without all the liberal bias and rhetoric.  Tom Hanks gave an excellent narration.  I must say, Mr. O'Reilly, well done!!

5621254,5,B00BHK99JU,"It's narrated by Tom Hanks. I, being an American history buff, really enjoyed this. A lot of cool facts about Lincoln's last days and about his killer, John Wilkes Booth and the conspiracy to kill Lincoln as well as Sec. of State Seward and VP Andrew Johnson. The actors did a great job and even look like the historical figures they portray. I like it so much that I watched it twice straight through.",1361232000,74,402,4.445945945945946
5621255,5,B00BHK99JU,"This is the best of the 3 ""Killing"" movies. Others are great too, but this one is just a bit better. This is part documentary as well as part historical reenactment.

5621379,5,B00BHK99JU,"Great documentary.  The movie provides many relatively unknown facts about the assasination and its aftermath.

5621384,5,B00BHK99JU,I purchased this dvd as a gift for my brother.  He is a history buff and has always loved anything about the Civil War.  This was a great movie and we both learned things we didn't know about the Lincoln assassination.  Tom Hanks was an added bonus as the narrator of the story.,1410480000,,278,4.2075471698113205

5621387,2,B00BHK99JU,"I couldn't finish watching it, even though I rented it. What a waste of my money. I don't mean to sound harsh, but I just couldn't get into it. The acting was okay; Tom Hanks--God bless him--I like but not in this. A movie without narration would have been better. Just a plain movie from John Wilkes Booth's POV would have been more interesting, and I would have gotten more out of it. But this gets two stars.",1409011200,2,411,4.282051282051282

5621395,5,B00BHK99JU,Bill O'Reilly wrote a great book depicting the final days of President Lincoln. The producers of the film do just as great of a job putting the scenes to life on the screen.,1399766400,,173,4.2727272727272725
5621396,5,B00BHK99JU,"This is very good & very well done. But there is a small blooper. Not once but twice Hanks refers to Sec. of State Seward as Sec. of ""WAR"" Seward. incorrect, funny it was never caught in production..  But still an easy 5 stars!!",1399593600,,228,4.181818181818182
5621397,5,B00BHK99JU,"Although parts of Bill O'Reilly's books can be tedious and only marginally historically accurate....this is certainly one of, if not the best treatment of this story I have seen. Great care was taken to work the actual events and statements made during the actual crime, and the actual people. Usually, creative license is taken by the producers to ""beef up"" the drama.....but there was none of that here. The acting is excellent, particularly JWB.....who captured the ego, and probable mannerisms better than I have ever seen before in these types of productions. If you want to see and feel the most likely personalities of the assassination players.....this is the video for you. I've seen every one of the previous attempts at telling this event......................and so far, I've watched this one twice. It is excellent in every way!",1398988800,2,841,5.145985401459854
5621398,5,B00BHK99JU,Great dvd about the Killing of Lincoln . A must for history buffs . I went to Gettsburg for their 250 Anniversity of the Gettsburg Address,1398816000,,138,4.346153846153846
5621399,5,B00BHK99JU,"It pales in comparison to Lincoln, starring Daniel Day Lewis, but still a must see.  This is more of a documentary than a movie, but still goes at a quicker pace than most documentaries.",1397865600,,186,4.470588235294118
5621400,3,B00BHK99JU,"I really wanted to like this documentary because of others' 4 and 5 star reviews, but I was disappointed.  There was no reason to drag it this story out for two hours or to incongruently break up the ""drama"" with Tom Hanks every 5 to 10 minutes.  Thee book does a great job of weaving together the final battles of the Civil War with the assassination plot, but this documentary leaves out the final battles (they are briefly mentioned). They could have spent 30 minutes on that, instead of dragging out the plotting and conspiracy.  I think this doc is aimed at people who don't know or don't care about the Civil War, but are intrigued by Lincoln's  assassination. It's probably worth watching if you have your fast forward button at the ready.",1397174400,,746,4.586466165413534

5621404,4,B00BHK99JU,"This is not as dry as several things posted on history channel. Live action re-enactment, along with Tom Hanks' narration, helps viewers understand the events and mood of the country during this difficult period.",1395100800,,212,5.264705882352941
5621405,5,B00BHK99JU,Excellent adaptation of Bill O'Reilly's book. I am passionate of the history of this country and the book was superb and the movie was too.,1394928000,,139,4.6

5621408,5,B00BHK99JU,"I thought this was a very well done movie.  It basically stayed true to the book by Bill O Reilly.  The naration, by Tom Hanks, was well done.  In addition, the actor who played John Wilkes Both was very believible.  This movie gives a history lesson in an entertaining way",1391040000,,273,4.4
5621409,5,B00BHK99JU,This was nicely done. It was partly narrated by Tom Hanks but this does not get in the way of the drama laid out before us. The actors were well played. There were several things that I had not learned in school back in the 60's nor in any other venue before this. It was very interesting. I highly recommend to all ages.,1390780800,,321,4.111111111111111
5621410,5,B00BHK99JU,This was a great movie and is sure to become a classic.  The DVD is a standard Blue-ray DVD so the picture quality is excellent.,1390780800,,128,4.12
5621411,1,B00BHK99JU,"I must say this product is okay. Nothing wrong with it.  But, I did want it in the book form and not in the CD form. So I am saying that I must have ordered it wrong.  I didn't return it as I didn't know about the cost of returning and reordering it.",1390176000,,250,3.69811320754717
5621412,3,B00BHK99JU,The research was impressive and presentation was great.  It was interesting and worth watching/reading/listening to.  It complements the movie Lincoln well.,1389657600,,156,6.380952380952381
5621413,5,B00BHK99JU,"I saw this movie listed for only $7, and it included all of DVD, Blu-Ray and Ultraviolet digital copy.  The deal was simply too good to be true... yet it was!

My Dad is a fan of the book and he says the movie outdoes the book in many ways.  I personally never read the book, but this movie was very enjoyable to watch.",1389571200,,319,3.953125
5621414,4,B00BHK99JU,It was good but slow in some parts. Good historical review. Good look at Booth an his crazy thinking. The man was deranged.,1389225600,,123,4.391304347826087

5621418,5,B00BHK99JU,"So well done!! All the actors gave such compelling performances, especially Jesse Jackson, who played John Wilkes Booth& Billy Campbell who played Lincoln. The narration done by Tom Hanks made the movie even more enjoyable& because of that, I learned certain Historical facts that I never knew before. The scene where Lincoln is dying will bring you to tears. SO VERY EMOTIONAL!! Anyone who loves History& appreciates outstanding acting, this is the movie for you.",1388275200,,464,5.2
5621419,5,B00BHK99JU,Should be watched along with Ken Burns: The Civil War or the Movie: Lincoln. All three provide a great historical framework for understanding how modern America came into being.,1388275200,,177,5.137931034482759

5621427,5,B00BHK99JU,"Superb blu-ray picture quality.  With an amazingly accurate presentation of this historical event.

I hadn't realized why it could be so good on the details until viewing the ""Making of"" documentary on this blu-ray, which explained the director's attention to detail, and that of the actors, costumers, writers, and historians working with them.

The actor who plays John Wilkes Booth stole the show; he was fantastic.  They had him looking almost exactly like the infamous JWB, and he acted as one would picture Booth had presented himself-- dramatic and larger-than-life with his words and comportment.

This should be viewed by kids as well as adults.  Recommend highly.",1385424000,4,673,5.242990654205608
5621428,2,B00BHK99JU,"What Booth did in 1865 was, to use Talleyrand's language, ""Worse than a sin; it was a mistake."" Booth should have known that
it was past the time when the removal of Lincoln would enable the South to win the War. Furthermore, he should have known that such an action would be used by the Union leaders to institute a brutal occupation of the South.
However, if this assassination had taken place in 1861 or 1862, it would have deprived the North of a brutal warlord and enabled a peace to have been achieved by another leader, such as McClellan. A warlord chief of state who violates the Constitution to
continue the ruinous tariff robbery of the South and kills Amerinds ad libidum should not be exempt from paying the ultimate price of his deeds. Recall that Lincoln had a gallows with 35 slots built to hang the Dakota protestors of Lincoln's land grab in Minnesota.
It is significant that several tribes supported the South and none the North. Lincoln was a money grabbing lawyer in the worst traditions of that trade. He deserved what he got. But the way Booth did it was injurious to America, though not nearly as injurious as Lincoln's unConstitutional  and genocidal war to suppress the South.",1383868800,2,1201,4.665094339622642
5621429,4,B00BHK99JU,"Good companion piece to Saving Lincoln, which covers Lincoln's life. This was a thorough examination of Lincoln's death, but I was more inspired by his leadership and courage during the nation's darkest hours. Also, Saving Lincoln is more of an epic movie, whereas Killing Lincoln is a solid documentary.",1383696000,6,304,5.224489795918367

5621432,3,B00BHK99JU,"I found the movie a bit tedious.  While interesting, the inter-scene narrations were somewhat intrusive.  Perhaps if there had been fewer of them, they might have worked better.  The reenactments were well done and the over-all learning experience was good.  The movie put life to a very sad chapter in American History.",1383436800,2,320,5.096153846153846

5621434,3,B00BHK99JU,"The book is always better than movie.  Always.  Killing Lincoln on DVD is no different, and perhaps even more so than many good adaptations.  I loved the book--well-told, fast-paced, informative and interesting.  The documentary-style adaptation cannot match it.  One hopes the Killing Kennedy documentary due out this weekend will surpass this first attempt to bring O'Reilly's best-sellers to the screen.",1383177600,6,406,5.7
5621435,2,B00BHK99JU,"Hanks ruined it for me. His ""role"" was completely unnecessary. His silly attempts at seeming relevant were pathetic. Placing things on the table to his right, as if they were spur of the moment decisions, was an annoyance. Plus, he constantly shook his head while narrating. (If some malady is causing his head to continuously move from side-to-side, well, I'm sorry.) He even interjected a few ""Uhs"" and whatnot, to make it appear his commentary was impromptu. It did not work. My fifth grade nephew could have done a better job. Whatever he was paid was far too much. A voice-over by a competent narrator to fill in the transitional parts would have been optimal. The REAL actors were, in large measure, superb, and bore striking resemblances to the person they portrayed. I finally resorted to speeding up the dvd, to the point I could read Hank's parts. When the camera moved back to the vignettes, I would return to normal speed.",1382572800,,934,4.771604938271605

This movie is basic but full of facts and protrays an excellent version of the characters to give the viewer a better insite of their mind-set.  The second time that you view it is even better.  There are some things missing of course, but a full and accurate account would require a 12 hour movie.  For Lincoln assassination buffs I think this is a keeper.",1379808000,,474,4.541176470588235

5621444,3,B00BHK99JU,"It is understood that this was a movie and to be fair, the acting was superb; however, there are many documentaries that reveal more than this. Again, this was time limited, whereas it did not really explore the profound details that have been covered as far back as the David Wolper days. Accordingly, other than being in HD, this information is nothing new under the sun other than intensely showing the brutality of the Seward attack by Powell. Just to mention, according to Robert Todd Lincoln, his father displayed a high, squeaky type voice, as portrayed well by Daniel Day Lewis.",1378080000,,586,4.811881188118812
5621445,5,B00BHK99JU,"Of the 44 presidents of the United States, there have been known assassination plots directed at nineteen of them. Of those, only six have actually been shot. And of those six, four were killed. The four presidents assassinated in office were: Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy.

Garfield was shot by a jealous madman, and McKinley by an anarchist, but nobody really hears about Leon Czolgosz or Charles Guiteau. The mysterious and endlessly debatable assassination of beloved president John F. Kennedy bears the brunt of the conspiracy theories, ranging from the good, the bad, and the weird. But it is the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth on April 15th, 1865, that is arguably the most romanticized and famous political killing in US history.

For a non-American like me, Killing Lincoln is the perfect blend of information, excellent reenactment, suspense, intrigue, and entertainment. I knew a lot about the assassination of Honest Abe BEFORE I saw the film, but I did not know what went on AFTER the actual shooting at Ford's Theatre at 10:25 AM, April 15th. It turns out that I only knew half the story. The most compelling part of the conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln was, arguably, not Lincoln's actual assassination. It was the slow lead up to it, the conspiratorial meetings, the building obsession of actor John Wilkes Booth, the relatively unknown plan to assassinate Secretary of State William Seward and Vice-President Andrew Johnson (both of which failed), Booth's dramatic escape, the valiant effort of doctors and surgeons to keep Lincoln alive, Booth's hideout and retrospective final days, and his anti-climactic death.

Day-Lewis played Lincoln as a man, full of faults and shortcomings; at times unsure of himself, but with a strong moral compass and as the brilliant manipulator and motivator he was. But Billy Campbell portrays him as the brilliant leader, the eloquent speaker, the devoted president, the humble man, the loving father and husband, and noble but conflicted soul that we all picture and remember him to be. Campbell's is an incredibly dignified, noble, and moving portrayal of the 16th President, and if he provides the heart and soul of the film, then Jesse Johnson as John Wilkes Booth gives the fiery spirit.

Johnson is absolutely electrifying as the theatrical and controversial, often mythical man who murdered Abraham Lincoln. Renowned actor, hot-blooded patriot, fervent speaker, brilliant manipulator, charismatic, grandiose, obsessive, conflicted, sympathetic...these are the adjectives that describe the 26 year-old John Wilkes Booth. Jesse Johnson chews the scenery and steals the film with his fiery, fervent acting and brilliant portrayal of Booth. The audience feels simultaneously repulsed, intrigued, sympathetic, and related to the man. From his stunning entrance, Johnson does nothing less than rivet and enthrall the entire film. His is a complex performance, but a sympathetic one. This is the finest Booth ever put to screen, and one of the most memorable antiheroes in recent cinema. You may begin feeling distanced and repulsed by him, but by the end, you cannot help but feel sorry for Booth. He thought he would be a hero like Brutus - slayer of a tyrant, but he has gone down in history as one of the most one-dimensional villains of all time.

They want to explore the true facts and circumstances that led up to Lincoln's assassination, and the the final days of John Wilkes Booth. Not satisfied with ending there, they further explore Booth's co-conspirators and their fates and demises. With historical accuracy, excellent costumes and cinematography, amazing period-accurate dialogues and stunning re-enactments, they have created one of the finest historical documentary films in recent years: Killing Lincoln.

Don't get me wrong I love Tom Hankins as an actor, but he is not an actor I would think of as narrating this or any other piece that is non-fiction.  It's like having Ophra Winfre being the narrator of the new Imax film about the Artic and the music done by Paul MaCartney....Bad choices on both films.",1377734400,,584,4.243243243243243

5621450,5,B00BHK99JU,"KILLING LINCOLN is that rare historical documentary that takes you inside history.  Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard are writing a series of books to breath life back into history. O'Reilly feels that Americans are losing touch with history and children are no longer learning the basics. Here is the documentary version of their book KILLING LINCOLN.

Great lengths were taken to ensure as much accuracy as possible in KILLING LINCOLN with authentic looking costumes, locations and sets. Re-enacting a tragic moment in American history is done with the great care. Here is an amazing visual trip back in time. Actors, including Billy Campbell as Abraham Lincoln, take us through these events. Filling in pieces and explaining the history is Tom Hanks. Hanks does a truly fine job in bridging the sequence of events.

KILLING LINCOLN is a great history lesson for adults and older children. Anyone fascinated with history will be intrigued by this production. I have read many books on the assassination of Abraham Lincoln so there was no new information for me but it was incredible to see the events ""live"" through historical fact. Most people know John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln in Ford's Theater but few realize this was a larger conspiracy. Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward were both on the hit list that fateful night. How many people know what transpired in Washington, D.C.,. as Lincoln was dying?

Here is a visually stunning documentary that brings history to life. Campbell protrays Lincoln as a kind-hearted soft-spoken man with a strong love for his wife and sons and for his country. Maybe Lincoln is idolized and maybe he should be. April 14, 1865 became a decisive moment in American history. Nothing would be the same again.
Anyone with an interest in American history should see KILLING LINCOLN. Here is the whole story and we see what happened to the conspirators. Historical records are used rather than conjecture. Was justice served in the sentences carried out on the surviving conspirators? Why did 18 pages disappear from Booth'sfinal diary?

Although the extras were interesting, I wish there had been much more on the life of Abraham Lincoln and the fates of the conspirators. It was interesting to see 1865 re-created and how the actors went about their roles. O'Reilly mentions finding out that John Wilkes Booth's fiance was having an affair with Lincoln's oldest son Robert and this anger could have fueled his need to kill Abraham Lincoln. Fascinating, if true, but why not explain the evidence.

A great deal of dedication and energy was given to this production of KILLING LINCOLN. It is a remarkable achievement and should been seen by all.",1375747200,,2702,5.020089285714286

5621461,2,B00BHK99JU,"If you have seen the Daniel Day-Lewis film, you might want to skip this one. In real life John Wilkes Booth (Jesse Johnson) was an actor, in this film he left a lot to be desired. The movie starts in the days/months before the assassination and goes up to the death of the assassins. It includes narration by Tom Hanks, who wisely didn't play any roles. Unfortunately the narration added very little to the film, other than make it annoying. Why narrate what is on the screen?

There were boring scenes of Booth writing a letter. The dialouge was dry toast. The ending with Booth saying ""kill me"" as he laid helpless would invoked images of the ultra-liberal book/film ""Johnny Got His Gun."" Really Bill, that was an influence on you?

I almost turned it off after 10 minutes. A remarkable film that captures both the boring aspect of a documentary and the fictional aspect of a film.

5621466,3,B00BHK99JU,"""Killing Lincoln"" was a quasi-documentary in style that presented factual ingredients as usually spoken by Tom Hanks.  That was an interesting approach, particularly for history buffs, but it was a clash of different styles when compared to the exaggerated acting by the principle cast members.  The actor who played J. W. Booth seemed to be portraying not just his character, Booth, but also the archly melodramatic style of 19th century acting.  His snarling and hand gesturing reminded me of the TV cartoon character, Snidely Whiplash of many years ago.  I'd have preferred to see Booth as a tormented individual along the lines of Hamlet or Macbeth.

The actor who played Lincoln had a tough act to follow, because of Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" having been in theaters so recently.  Daniel D. Lewis's portrayal of Lincoln in that movie should seal that character away on the shelves for decades to come.  But having said that, the Lincoln of this movie in question really did an admirable portrayal.

All in all, I'd say this was a decent made-for-TV movie, and Tom Hanks presence made it worth the cost of admission right from the start.",1373241600,2,1137,4.947368421052632

We get into Booth's state of mind, and those who are familiar with this story will find many surprises and pieces of trivia. (Such as learning the original plan was to kidnap Lincoln.)

My mother likes to watch ""Dateline NBC"", where a legal case whose conclusion is already known is drawn out for the audience in interviews and the presentation of evidence.

5621476,3,B00BHK99JU,"This hybrid docudrama/documentary on Abraham's Lincolns last days and his assassin, actor John Wilkes Booth was made for television and apparently was broadcast on either the History Channel or the National Geographic Channel earlier this year and is now on home video on DVD and Blu-ray. This is a review of the BD edition.

Based on the book by TV commentator Bill O'Reilly (and Martin Dugard), and executive produced by directors Ridley Scott and Tony Scott (neither of who directed it), the 96 minute film (listed incorrectly by Amazon at 120 minutes) tries to tell the story using new information unearthed by the authors and - as you will hear, way too many times. In the ""bonus Features"" the director wanted this to be as accurate as possible, down to the makeup on everyone in the film, including those that surrounded Lincoln on his death bed. He even made an exact replica of the gun the Booth used.
Whether you feel that actor Billy Campbell has the right build and voice for Lincoln will have to be your own decision. For my taste, Daniel Day Lewis nailed it in Steven Spielberg's recent film ""Lincoln"". But we need to remember that there are no recordings of Lincoln's voice; Edison had not yet invented the phonograph!
There are already other reviews here so I'll try not to duplicate their info. I put  the disc in my BD player without knowing anything except that the film was about Lincoln and Booth. It starts with no opening credits and we see Booth shooting the president. (The rest is really flashback). So I assumed it was a docudrama. Then about five minutes into the film Tom Hanks appears - not as an actor in costume, but as a narrator, and - for some reason , he is facing to your right. Anyway he tells you how many days Lincoln has to live. And, he returns periodically to give a bit more info and tell you ""again"" how many days Lincoln has left at that point. I really found this distracting, as did another reviewer.

So as for the film, it was okay and it does tell the story.

The BD is loaded with LOTS of special features. First there is the full-length commentary by the screenwriter (I have not listened to that). Then there are the following:
Interview with O'Reilly - approx.  5 minutes
Uncovering The Truth: the Making of Killing Lincoln - 22 minutes
A series of five ""promotional"" features including the music  Costume, Production design, etc.
And finally an ad to visit Virginia (17 seconds!!)

O'Reilly has also written a book titled ""Killing Kennedy"" and that film is finished but hasn't aired. And he just signed an agreement with the National Geographic Channel for a film titled ""Killing Jesus"". So there are more ""Killings"" to come.

Yes, I learned more about John Wilkes Booth than I learned in school, but this film didn't ""excite"" me as Spielberg's film did! I guess it's all how you ""look"" at history.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
