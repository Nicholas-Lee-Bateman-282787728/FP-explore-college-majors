Certainly playing ability and level are subjective measures, even so - perhaps ""advanced beginner"" or ""intermediate"" may be more appropriate ratings. But you will not be disappointed with the musicianship and Roger's obvious labor of love that these traditional songs represent. I loved ""The Water is Wide"" and have found that it's one that even a beginner might have success learning. And Mr. McGuinn does suggest that these can all be played with simple strumming; no advanced hybrid picking is really required. So grow into it!",1128902400,4,697,5.176991150442478
7984773,1,B00008JUHB,"While McGuinn's artistry is excellent, this video's title is totally misleading - claiming ""Basic"" and ""Easy arrangements"" are totally untrue here. ""Basic /easy"" does not mean simultaneously flat picking and finger picking at 100 bpm. This isn't even structured as a learning video, its really a quick run through by an accomplished artist at full speed. A performance video for his fans perhaps but really not something a beginner could do. There's also some gratuitous shots of the peghead to let your know whose brand of guitar he's playing. If you have anything less than intermediate to advanced guitar skills you will be disappointed. Which is a shame because this publisher does put out some excellent learning tools (for example Steve Kaufman). Shame on them for misleading us on this one. Save your money !",1087689600,19,815,5.044444444444444
7984774,5,B00008JUHB,"If you are a McGuinn fan, and love the song ""Chestnut Mare"", get this DVD.  It is very well produced, with excellent sound and visuals.  The songs are well chosen and the techniques demonstrated will be helpful to players of all levels.  The last song on the disc is an acoustic 12 string version of ""Chestnut Mare"".  He plays this on his Martin signiture model, and it is just fantastic.  Of all the songs by the Byrds that I remember, this was my favorite, and if you watch closely, and have some skills, you can bring it to life.  Great product.",1086220800,4,548,4.376237623762377
