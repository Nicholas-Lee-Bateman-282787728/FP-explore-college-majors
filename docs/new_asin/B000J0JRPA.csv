8165394,5,B000J0JRPA,It is a shame Henry Hill has sunk as low as he has. It would be interesting to see a follow up on this documentary to see if he has shed the problems he dealt with in this movie.,1318896000,,178,3.58974358974359
8165395,1,B000J0JRPA,"I thought this would be a good DVD but was very dissapointed. This documentary makes the local news look like Emmy Winners.

Henry Hill has nothing left to offer anyone and just rambles on about his difficulties in adjusting to ordinary life. He needed subtitles just to make the viewers understand him.

Seriously, do not waste your money. You will regret it like I did.",1258329600,2,371,4.6923076923076925
8165396,1,B000J0JRPA,"Being a big fan of ""Goodfellas,"" I was looking forward to this documentary.  Unfortunately, this is pretty dull.  Henry is discovered as a cook in a small Nebraska town that has a significant meth problem.  This film covers Henry's difficulties in staying straight and his domestic and drug problems, which are more depressing than interesting.  Henry mumbles so bad that the film makers were forced to use subtitles for him.  There is very little discussion of Henry's ""old days"" in New York and the special features on ""Goodfellas"" are better if that is what you are looking for.  Thus, I suggest you skip it.",1226966400,4,611,4.826923076923077
