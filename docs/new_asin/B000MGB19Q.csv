8168680,5,B000MGB19Q,"This is a must for any aspiring percussionist. Alex Acuna has traveled all over the world and demonstrates so many rhythms that make the world what it is today. If you're looking into doing Afro-Cuban, African, etc. THIS IS WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!! This is also great for other musicians. Acuna really dives into the group aspect of it and the feeling of the music, but his direction is definitely geared towards percussionists!",1279584000,4,425,4.916666666666667
