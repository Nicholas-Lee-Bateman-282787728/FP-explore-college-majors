2653174,5,B000I5XNDS,"Brilliantly written, with real laugh out loud gags and with great performances from both leads. Kathy Burke steals the show though - her Linda La Hughes is just spot on hilarious....if you like british comedy and humour then watch this show, but stay away if you are homophobic or laughophobic",1405728000,,293,4.88

2653178,5,B000I5XNDS,"I was at first concerned that the items would not play in DVD player due to regions, but after the items arriving in a timely fashion, in 'as new' condition, I didn't have to worry at all.  They played without hassle and are absolutely hilarious, just as they were described. I will be more than happy to return to this supplier.",1307404800,,329,4.39344262295082
2653179,5,B000I5XNDS,"Although this item is only available in PAL, and I knew that it wouldn't play on DVD players in the U.S. and Canada; I bought it knowing that it will play on most computers. It plays just fine on my PC and MAC. For a short time some episodes were played on BBC America, and I really liked the series, so I'm happy that I found it.",1266883200,4,330,3.9402985074626864

8144009,5,B000I5XNDS,Another Favorite British show I love. I first saw this on PBS 21 and from the first viewing I fell in love with this show also because it makes me laugh every time I watch / see it some people say BBC will never ever let a show like this be made let alone be shown on the Television again I read from an online news article of a news paper from the UK the show ended because of James Dreyfus decided to leave the show to come to America to star in a new TV comedy sitcom but the show was considered not funny at all and was cancelled either way more episodes of Gimme Gimme Gimme should have been made with or without him just like The Thin Blue Line where Dreyus played P.C. Kevin Goody another show I love to me the only thing that I did not like about this DVD collection of the show was there were no extras nothing to show How extremely funny Burke and Dreyus are in other shows etc they were in as well actor / character bios would have been cool as well I forgot to mention as an added extra ABBA  Gimme Gimme Gimme song / video would have been cool if added on here since the opening and closing song is originally done by ABBA,1458172800,,1135,4.0
8144010,5,B000I5XNDS,"Raunchy, silly but still funny! It's so out there you gotta appreciate it for what it is, this would never be allowed in the US. Great addition to any brit com collection.",1433203200,,171,4.375
8144011,5,B000I5XNDS,"Love it, love it, love it! Kathy Burke --- she's hot!  Rated 5 stars, although some reservations about gay stereotyping with male character. It is what it is, I guess --- and I loved this one!",1432944000,,192,4.333333333333333
