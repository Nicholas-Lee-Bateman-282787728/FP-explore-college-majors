5451633,5,B00AMQG8NU,"I can't recommend this movie enough if you are a history buff or someone who is interested in how the American West was created and the amazing people who established a little thing called the Pony Express.

5451663,3,B00AMQG8NU,This was more of a documentary than I expected. Unfortunately I fell asleep about 1/2 way thru. My companion said it was ok. But long.  He enjoyed learning  the facts of these men and women of this era. They had a lot of challenges in getting the mail thru.,1481328000,,257,4.224489795918367

5451675,1,B00AMQG8NU,I dislike documentaries as it can slant the real truth. I would rather view the old western movies as I know that they are fictional for the most parts.,1476403200,,152,4.275862068965517
5451676,2,B00AMQG8NU,had hoped for better but just boring and repetitive,1475971200,,51,4.777777777777778
5451677,5,B00AMQG8NU,"Totally enjoyable; both entertaining and educational at the same time. Hats off to those responsible for creating this little gem. While most of us have heard of the Pony Express I suspect few have any depth of knowledge about this amazing effort; the details provided by this documentary provide fascinating insights of which I was unaware.

Very definitely worth the time it takes to watch it!",1475971200,,395,4.984848484848484

5451684,4,B00AMQG8NU,"I had mixed feelings about watching this video thinking that it might be an old production.  It is not.  It is well done and relates the incredible contribution made by the operation of the Pony Express during the period before the American Civil War.  I didn't know that the operation of the Pony Express was so short-lived, nor did I appreciate that without it California might have had a very different future.",1474675200,,413,4.708333333333333

5451689,3,B00AMQG8NU,"The film wasn't quite I expected,,, because I didn't expect a documentary!  For what  it was -- a celebr ation of the umpteenth birthday of the Pony Express-- it was pretty good, I guess.  I didn't really know much about its history , so, from that standpoint, it was worthwhile.  It was too repetitive, however.  I'm not sure what other approach they might have taken, but it became a little boring.  Everyone along the way wanted to present what THEIR town had contributed to that history, and there were a LOT of  topwns!",1474156800,,524,4.56989247311828

5451702,1,B00AMQG8NU,"I thought that this was going to be a history to the Pony Express. Instead it's a long video about a bunch of reenactors goofing off on their annual ""repeat"" of the journey along the route. A waste of time",1471910400,2,205,4.15

5451709,5,B00AMQG8NU,Great history of a short lived organization during the Western expansion days. Worthy of watching again. I have been to the Pony Express museum in St Joseph. Movie really made it come alive.,1469577600,,190,4.787878787878788

5451720,5,B00AMQG8NU,"If it is what your interested is in is is a great movie
it is a great history lesson and a great example of peolple passing on the history of the pony express through re enactment for lack of a better term",1468454400,,205,3.9047619047619047
5451721,4,B00AMQG8NU,"As much about the reenactment as the original, this is a pleasant introduction to a little-know niche of American history appropriate for family viewing.",1467763200,,153,5.416666666666667

5451723,3,B00AMQG8NU,"I wanted more history. The students preferred it over a traditional lesson, but my objective was westward expansion. It was more about modern day reenactment.",1467590400,,158,5.36
5451724,4,B00AMQG8NU,"The film uses the annual Pony Express reenactment to illustrate the importance of remembering and understanding history.  In addition to giving new information about the Pony Express (1860-61), the film presents the use of history to curtail incorrigible youth, assist in wild mustang rehabilitation and how to go about presenting history to the public.  Sort of a ""this is why history is important"" documentary.",1467504000,,412,5.421875

5451729,1,B00AMQG8NU,Thought this might be a movie.  Would have been a great idea for one.  And while I appreciate history....I guess you could say I didn't like it because I wasn't mentally prepared for a documentary.,1466899200,,197,4.6

While the history was given, it was narrated in anticipation of the celebration of the anniversary. I was sorry to learn that it happened a few years ago and I missed it.

5451889,3,B00AMQG8NU,wow tough question it is a documentary that tends to repeat itself a lot--but if your paying attention it has some really valuable knowledge to pass along--I would recommend it!  Especially since I am involved with the BLM mustang program,1463961600,,238,4.95
5451890,4,B00AMQG8NU,Vary informative and shows how big a deal the pony express really was - a little slow but worth it,1463961600,,98,3.95

5451901,3,B00AMQG8NU,Tis was an informative program but tended to drag on repeating the same message of needing to educate our youngsters on the importance of knowing US history.  There were interesting facts presented but would have been more entertaining to have shown more of the re-enactments and including much more of the lives of those who ran on the pony express and how the outposts were maintained.,1463875200,2,387,4.863636363636363

They must have said ""it's important to remember our history"" about 6000 times, but then never told the audience that history. At one point someone says that there are a lot of myths about the Pony Express and we need to separate the fact from the myth. Then they never told us what those myths are or what the truth is! Long drawn out scene of people standing around the grave of one of the founders and talking about how important he was, with no discussion of what he did or why it was important. Etc. Maybe 15 minutes actually telling us things about the Pony Express and 90 minutes telling us how people should learn more about the Pony Express.",1463788800,8,800,4.524137931034483

At one point someone explains that ""a shot of whiskey"" comes from the old west trading of a .45 bullet for a glass of whisky.  This is so not true and a ridiculous legend.  Just google the ""etymology of shot of whiskey"" and you will find how wrong that is. At another point they have a guy using divining rods looking for graves.  Divining rods do not work, they have never passed a scientific test to find anything and they have been tested literally hundreds of times.  I was waiting to see big foot or aliens come down to help with re-enacting.  It is a BAD movie, poorly researched on anything but a museum and a bunch of want-a-be cowboys. It is mostly just a boring movie about re-enactors celebrating the ""glory"" of this 18 month failed business model with very little context.  In a word boring.  I would have loved to hear more about the history of the time and more about what we do know unless of course we don't know then why make a documentary.",1463184000,2,1009,4.358288770053476

Not just anybody could be a rider because of the dangerous sacrifices one had to make much less the skill and sheer stamina a person needed to accomplish the job!

Hearing people say, ""Well, we don't know what it was really like, but that's what makes it great"" was just a bit much for me to stomach.",1462752000,,318,4.482758620689655

5452063,2,B00AMQG8NU,A poor variation on the actual history.  Nothing was believable.  Acting sucked.  Narrator was unbelievable. There was  television series that was more honest.,1462579200,,159,5.782608695652174

If you want to watch plenty of bad horseback riding, folks talking about running museums, and lots of questions raised in the film that were left unanswered about the Pony Express then you will enjoy this movie and not feel like it is a waste of time.",1445731200,3,294,4.462962962962963

8554021,3,B00AMQG8NU,"This isn't about the historical Pony Express, a business that only lasted eighteen months (1860-1861). This is about a Pony Express re-enactment group that is celebrating their 150 years of re-enacting what the Pony Express might have been like. It's like watching a documentary on a Comic Con convention, with everyone dressed up in costumes and re-enacting their favorite characters in movies and comic books. There is VERY LITTLE historical information in this ""documentary"", and it is told from the perspective of a single town. Unless you are in this re-enactment group, or know someone who is, you probably won't get a lot out of it, other than seeing pretty horses and a neat museum. There are good documentaries on the Pony Express out there, but this isn't it. I'm sure that's why they called it ""Spirit of the..."", instead of a documentary on the historical company itself. The description is a bit misleading. I watched it all the way through hoping to get more historical information, but no such luck.",1516492800,,1014,4.935672514619883
8554022,2,B00AMQG8NU,So many old people that want you to get off their lawn. Had to stop when they started divining for dead bodies and asking them seance questions.,1512000000,,144,4.37037037037037
8554023,4,B00AMQG8NU,"As I first started watching this documentary, I wasn't sure if the name fitted the description... but as I completed the film, it truly was about keeping the Spirit of the Pony Express... ALIVE! As a photographer of the ""Remnant's of the Pony Express; Sacramento to Salt Lake City"" I commend all of you on your work on keeping the Pony Express memories alive; the Museums across this country and all of the volunteers of each organization, including the National Pony Express Association!
I recently had to opportunity to photograph a few riders on this years Annual Re-Ride (2017). These folks are not provided a horse at a Station to ride as were the original riders. No, these folks BRING their own horse(s), and must drive their personal trucks and trailers to the sites to do the Ride.
I learned that can be quite a challenge, as this year in Nevada there was a snow storm, the roads were muddy and with this kind of weather comes a lot of challenges. It didn't stop them though!
Thank you to the NPEA volunteers who also helped me to get to stations that I otherwise would not have been able to photograph! My book will be coming out next year Lord willing. This video has been part of my research, along with many a books and Archives in Museums and Online. I enjoyed watching this video.",1500681600,,1295,4.538461538461538

The documentary focused on the current day volunteers that reenact the 10 day ride that covered about 1,300 miles.",1486598400,,287,4.958333333333333
