8564195,5,6302799228,"As the writer/producer/creator of ""Gene Krupa: Jazz Legend""--as well as our newest effort, ""Gene Krupa: Swing, Swing, Swing!""--my mission was to let the music of this drumming legend speak for itself.  The  essence of Gene Krupa is in his performances, and this program presents  over a dozen complete performances of Gene in action, along with Benny  Goodman, Lionel Hampton, Teddy Wilson, Charlie Ventura and many more.  This  video has been acclaimed worldwide, and some writers have even maintained  that this video actually marked the beginning of the burgeoning swing  craze.  After all, Gene Krupa was not only a jazz legend, but remains the  original ""King of Swing.""",920851200,16,675,5.224299065420561
