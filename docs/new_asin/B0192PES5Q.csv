7560994,4,B0192PES5Q,"I have been a huge gx over the others for years just due to the fact that the show makes dueling look exciting. With season 3 the duels are more invigorating. My only issue is that I wish they would have included the real final episode and had dubbed season 4, but the show is still my favorite that I watch again and again.",1457568000,,324,4.078125

7561013,5,B0192PES5Q,"*I received a review copy of this series in exchange for an honest review

After almost a year of waiting, fans of YU-GI-OH!: GX will finally be able to see what happens to Jaden and his friends. And I doubt youll be disappointed. The duels are still intense (and not painfully long, thankfulIy) and the stakes are high once again as Jaden takes on opponents of all skill levels. If you're ready to continue your GX experience, Season 3 will take you there!

I have to say, I am impressed with this season the most so farmuch like Harry Potters progression in the books, Jaden and his friends have sort of matured over the past three years. Thus, the characters are more interesting and a bit deeper in their development.

Curiously, Ive seen a lot of buzz on the internet in regard to YU-GI-OH!: GX Season 3 and the missing final episode. I did some digging and discovered Episode 156 was actually not dubbed for the English release, therefore the season is sorta left on a cliffhanger.

But that doesnt detract from the series at all, and if anything, it whets the appetite for more. Season 3 is another big win for me, and I recommend it. The DVD set is available now, so take a look.",1458864000,,1187,4.456221198156682
7561014,5,B0192PES5Q,"Absolutely loved this series/season it was a great continuation from the original series. Its always sweet to see old characters from the orginal show pop up every now and then. However I am upset that they didn't finish the english dub, hopefully it'll return one day. Regardless of that this is a great show & will forever hold that number one slot as the best Yu-Gi-Oh! series to date.",1458604800,,388,4.63768115942029
7561015,5,B0192PES5Q,"Finally after a long awaited wait, yugioh gx season 3 is here.  The third season is by far the best.  The season focuses on Jaden and Yubel (a spirit from his childhood days who was sent away in space because Jaden hoped she would become safe to use because everything he played her, his opponents would collapse) who vows to have revenge on her beloved Jaden for sending her away.  She does this by sending Jaden and his friends to another dimension.  In this dimension Jaden loses most of his friends and a darkness takes him over in the process.  The season contains 51 episodes.  I had hoped the last episode of season 3 was in this boxset but sadly it wasn't.  So this boxset ends with Jaden ""up in the stars.""  Unfortunately because of 4kids wanting to air 5ds, season four was never dubbed and probably never will be which is real let down.",1457740800,,847,4.419354838709677
