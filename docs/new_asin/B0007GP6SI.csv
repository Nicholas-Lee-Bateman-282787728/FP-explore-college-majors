2211573,3,B0007GP6SI,THE MOVIE I FELT WAS A REAL TOPIC. MANY GUYS CAN RELATE THIS. THIS MOVIE ALSO BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES. MOST OF ALL TOO DAMN SHORT LOL,1232409600,,134,3.8214285714285716
2211574,5,B0007GP6SI,"I'd never heard of this movie when I picked it up in Walmart so I took a chance and bought it. That was $5.50 well spent because I was not disappointed. This movie is funny at times, sad at times, thought-provoking at times, but entertaining at all times. I actually cried at the end. I can't remember the last movie I watched that brought tears to my eyes. Anyhoo, I turned my ringer off so I wouldn't be disturbed. If you like ""30 Years To Life"" you'll like this movie too. The main reason I like this movie is because the characters are so real: the drunk who puts somebody on blast at the family gathering, the ""Oreo"" friend (black on the outside, white on the inside), the ""Ms. Independent-I-Don't-Need-No-Man-I-Got-Dental-Benefits-and-my-own-business"" female, the angry one who has that inner turmoil but is taking it out on everybody else, the so- called ""Mack"" who fronts like he's ""The Man"" when he's really on lock, the ""We-need-to-take-this-relationship-to-another-level"" one,(marriage) and the loud sister, the one who keeps the party going no matter what  (Wendy Raquel Robinson). The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that in some scenes women were referred to as ""b-----s"" and ""h--s."" Anyway, Guy Torry is an outstanding actor, he acted his heiny off in this one. His character is the one that stood out. But don't take my word for it, take a chance like I did and see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.",1160092800,9,1438,4.775100401606426
