5832615,5,B00DLX76BY,"I've owned a lot of WATP videos, and I find this one to be more challenging than the rest. I love how one mile is her regular kind of walk, the next ramps it up, and the third involves toning. I haven't done the last two miles yet, but I look forward to the challenge!",1380153600,,268,3.890909090909091
5832616,4,B00DLX76BY,"I have a bunch of other Leslie workout DVDs, and I really enjoy this one.  Ok, so it doesn't have the ""customize your workout"" feature- I don't care.  Each of the 5 miles is its own segment, so if you start with the warmup, you can then choose which of the miles you want.  When the mile ends, I walk over to my remote, hit the forward button to skip over the segments I don't want, and then start moving again.  I'm not a big fan of the band segments (not just here, but on any DVD)so I usually do miles 1,3, or 5. When I'm done, I skip to the cool down- and it doesn't bother me that the stretch isn't more intense (I hate stretching, to be honest). The music on this DVD is better than on many of her videos, and the chatter isn't as annoying in most places (there are a couple moments, but I can live with them).  The cast keeps getting younger each video, and the only one here from Leslie's past videos is Brianna (who appears to be about 23, but maybe I'm wrong- if she's older than that, then she looks friggin' amazing). I still wonder what happened to Linda, Joann, Mary Kay, and Carol. Leslie herself is working out in a full face of makeup, which does bug me-I know you need a little for the camera, but a full face?  Still, the exercises are fun, and the 10 minute countdown clock is actually rather inspiring.  After all, who can't do something for 10 minutes?

So, overall, I really like this video. I don't know if it's my all-time favorite (Ok, I know full well it's not- that's probably the Belly Blast workout), but it's head and and shoulders over the 3 Mega Miles video that was released earlier this year.",1380153600,14,1627,4.225806451612903
5832617,3,B00DLX76BY,"Like another reviewer, I was extremely disappointed that the workout cannot be customized like my other 5 mile CD of Leslie's.  I assumed the technology would go forward, not backward, when I ordered this.  The workout itself is fine if you like Leslie and you now have the option to turn off the instructions.  I would have given 3.5 stars if that was option because the new music is a nice change.  If you only plan to go the full 5 miles (which would take well over an hour) and you don't want to customize, you will probably enjoy this one.",1379203200,,544,4.356435643564357
5832618,5,B00DLX76BY,"A nice addition to her workout DVD collection. She said she worked up a sweat, but was by no means difficult.  It was nice to interchange between this and insanity.",1378771200,,164,4.466666666666667
5832619,5,B00DLX76BY,"Ok, let me start w/ the minor cons to get it out of the way. I don't like the fact that you can't customize the miles. The menu gives you the option to either play entire workout, or select individual miles; but you can't create your own workout. Also, the cool down walk & stretch session is embedded to mile 5; there isn't a selection for it on the menu. However, these are just minor annoyances for me & not bothersome enough for me to take down a star.

This is a great workout DVD; the miles are about 13-16 min long. Today, I did miles 3-5 (including the cool down in mile 5) and it took about 45 min to complete. I worked up a sweat & felt like I had a complete/efficient workout. The moves are pretty much Leslie's basic moves--walking in place, side steps, knee lifts, kicks, kick-backs, etc. However, there are some new moves such as the ""cha cha"" & some skater moves. The strength training sessions in miles 2 & 4 are great--if you are short on time, you can easily combine one of those miles w/ mile 3 (the interval mile) & you've got yourself a short, yet complete workout w/ cardio & strength training combined.

The great thing about all of Leslie's workouts is that you can modify the intensity level based on your own ability & comfortability. I'm able to do higher impact workouts, so i usually jog in place, even when leslie & her walkers are just walking. If some of the moves are too intense for you, you can just modify them; for example, instead of doing the skaters, you can just do side steps. In mile 3, during the speed intervals, leslie & her walkers are doing high impact knee-ups--if those are too much for you, you can just jog in place. Anyway, you get the idea.

I would definitely recommend this DVD.",1378684800,188,1734,4.345679012345679
5832620,3,B00DLX76BY,"This DVD loses 2 stars right away. From the description, I expected to be able to choose miles to create my own workout each day but this is not the case. This is simply a 5 mile walk with chapters. You have to play the full walk to start with the warm up. If you choose to start at mile 3, for instance, it starts there then plays to the end or you stop it. The ""cool down"" is not accessible separately either so you have to fast forward. I'm not a fan of the band miles so I would skip the 4th mile to save time (I never have 1 1/2 hours for a workout) but it's annoying to stop walking, forward the DVD, then start back with my legs cramping. This is a major disappointment since this capability has been used in the past on another 5 mile DVD and it's the one thing I'd wish to have on every workout!

As for the workout itself, I'd give it 4 stars if not for the other problems. I don't mind the band in use during the walk, but mile 4 is a lot of stopping and starting to do squats and lunges in between walking. The other huge problem that I have with  newer Leslie walks is all of the bouncing/shifting! It's not friendly to those with shin splints or other issues and it has been a part of almost every workout in recent years. Aside from that, it's a good, sweaty workout with other little mini-boosts. Leslie isn't too annoying with her chatter (although she usually doesn't bother me even at her chattiest anyway). The music is a nice change.

Unfortunately, the workout falls down again and loses another half a star...WHERE IS THE STRETCH?  Another issue with recent workouts is the rushed stretching and this one is the worst with NO STRETCH. You raise your arms up and down a couple of times and stretch them overhead and to the front and that's it.

Leslie, I've been a fan for years and you can do a better job than this! I expect more from you. I have only really liked one out of the last 5 workouts (Walk It Off in 30 Days) and that one is too short to be my regular workout. I'm just not feeling her workouts anymore... perhaps because I don't fit into the young demographic that is being targeted now. I've been doing Walk workouts since Walk Away the Pounds came out...a loooong time.

So, in summary, if you can workout 1 1/2 hours a day to do the whole workout, or don't mind breaking your stride to jump around to different parts of the video (and shift-punches), plus adding in your own stretching session, then it's a good workout for you. Sadly, I don't expect to have it in my rotation as often as I'd planned when I thought I could easily do 3-4 miles a day.",1378684800,23,2590,4.201207243460765

5832626,5,B00DLX76BY,"This DVD is broken down into 5 segments you can mix or match.  It is a little more difficult than some of the other WATP videos, but as she always does, Leslie has a modifier. The miles are *perceived exertion*, not actual miles in footsteps so if you wear a fitbit the miles will be different.  However, I use this tape every other day alternating with another WATP tape & eating a healthy, clean diet and I've lost 60+ pounds.  It works and is easier (and less boring) that the treadmill.  There are too Many nasty reviews by people that clearly did not consistently use this tape.",1512432000,4,583,4.420560747663552

5832631,5,B00DLX76BY,My favorite Leslie Sansone workout so far! It has one warm up at the beginning and and a cool down at the end with 5 different miles inbetween. I ordered the digital version of this on Prime and it's not a big deal to fast forward to the mile I want to do. It has bands in two of the miles but I just ordered a beach body one from amazon for like $9. I always burn around 450-500 calories when I do 3 miles of this workout. I like being able to pick which miles I want to do so I'm not doing the same thing every time. Leslie is really great at keeping my interest and motivation going throughout the workout. The time always flies by when I'm doing these videos. I really enjoy them and how easy the choreography is. It's not complicated or hard to follow. Basic and simple yet super effective. I am a huge fan of Leslie and this video is the best!,1508976000,,849,4.029585798816568
5832632,4,B00DLX76BY,"I have used these workouts before and wanted them in DVD format as well. However, the image shows that the item comes with a stretch exercise band, which was half of the reason why I bought it in the first place. It does not include this. The image is misleading.

As for the workouts, each mile is very different and you can mix them up depending on how you feel. I liked going straight through for all five miles when I was in good enough shape. Two miles are more strength training. One is high intensity with a bit of almost-running. Overall, a great workout.

One star off for not including the stretch band as indicated on the packaging -- otherwise, a great product.",1508889600,,673,4.419354838709677

5832635,4,B00DLX76BY,First I want to say I love this one!  She uses the stetchie band in miles 2 and 4. It is a good workout and moves along at a good pace. The only reason I marked off one star is that you can not program the miles if you only want to do part of it and the warm up and cool down are not listed separately.  This is my first Leslie workout DVD with the band and I feel like a get a good upper body workout with it.  If you don't mind having to keep returning to the menu to select the next mile if you aren't doing the full workout it is a good one to try.,1505174400,2,552,3.5833333333333335

5832637,5,B00DLX76BY,I really liked this DVD for alternating fast walking with toning moves.  It breaks up the monotony of just walking and the toning for the arms is what I need.  This workout also goes by pretty quickly because I enjoy working out with Leslie.  Her chatter doesn't really bother me and I like her personality!,1503705600,2,307,4.545454545454546
5832638,5,B00DLX76BY,"I have been doing Leslie's walking videos for years and I have enjoyed them all. 5 Mega Miles has become my all time favorite. I don't just enjoy doing it, I look forward to doing it.",1503100800,2,183,4.111111111111111
5832639,5,B00DLX76BY,"Holy guacamole!  This is quite the workout!

I love these videos and got this particular dvd because my sister raves about it.  I had been using the 4 mile walk from Leslie's Ultimate collection, and was ready to move on to something else.  My sister and her husband do 1 mile a day and then all 5 miles on their 5th day, with breaks on the weekend.  But I'm retired, have more time, and I'm not that disciplined.  It's like a candy bar; I can't eat just some of it.  I have to eat the whoooooole thing.  I just started using the 5 mile walk last week (I've used it 6 times, to be exact), and I'm down 2 pounds.

These are youngsters in this dvd.  There's a reason for that.  People my age would just look pathetic huffing and puffing their way through 93 minutes of this.  But with that being said, if you want a challenge, this is it.  There are 5 different 1 mile segments, so you have the option to do 1 mile or a couple of miles or the entire workout.  I have tendonitis in both arms and a torn labrum in my right shoulder so there are times when I have to minimize the arm movements, but this is such a high energy workout that I feel like I accomplished something just getting through it.

I have several of these dvd's.  This will probably become one of my favorites.  Enjoy!",1503100800,4,1283,4.150406504065041

5832641,5,B00DLX76BY,I love this Leslie Sansone walk DVD! I have been regularly walking with it now for about 3 months and the results are amazing! I have a more fit body and I feel better too. Leslie Sansone is motivating and fun to walk with. I definitely recommend this DVD - & all Leslie Sansone walk videos in general!

5832647,5,B00DLX76BY,I love Leslie's DVDs. These are great low impact work outs that someone my age(59) can do without damaging joints. In fact my knee joint is doing better using these. You can make them higher impact if you boost more and add low hand weights. I have five DVDs now and alternate the walking DVDs with the toning DVDs.,1492214400,,315,4.3559322033898304
5832648,5,B00DLX76BY,"What a great DVD for those of us who want to lose some weight, get fit and stick to it.  I had purchased Leslie's Walk to the Hits (3miles) DVD first.  This 5 Mega Miles is my second and probably my favorite of the two.  I try to alternate between them and find I like the challenge of the 5 Mega Miles. Mine did not come with the bands so I use an elastic band from another exercise system for mile 2 and free weights for mile 4. Works fine for me.
The exercise is easy to follow, even if you aren't familiar with Leslie's general routine.  I was able to do all 5 miles on the first try. I think you get a great work out and for me, the fact that I continue to do it, makes it a winner.  I thought I would get 'bored' just walking for 5 miles but you aren't 'just walking', and Leslie does a great job keeping you engaged.
You can choose to do it a mile at a time, but I have discovered that it is so well put together, 5 miles goes by quickly.  The effort and sweat is well worth the feeling of accomplishment you get and is a great start to the day.
The warm up is about 5 mins; miles 1 & 2 are about 15 mins each; mile 3 is about 13 min; mile 4 is about 12 mins; mile 5 is about 16 mins; and the cool down is about 5 mins.  Total of 81 minutes.  Doing all 5 miles puts you at about 9,696 steps!!!!
I would recommend this workout to anyone wanting to get fit and not wanting to go to the gym.  I also think it is a better workout than taking a walk outdoors when its either too cold or too hot.  If I can do it (I'm over 65yrs.) you can too. So go for it!!!!",1491004800,2,1561,3.7607361963190185

5832652,5,B00DLX76BY,"First off, here's a shocker for fans of Leslie Sansone's videos: No Nick! That's right, the ever-smiling Nick Drago doesn't appear in 5 Mega Miles, but the young, athletic cast of walkers is as appealing as ever. (How does Gabby make those moves look so graceful?). They are fun to watch. This is my 5th Leslie Sansone DVD, and it's definitely on the higher side for impact and exertion. I'd say it is a little tougher than 'Tone Every Zone,' and a little less demanding (minute-for-minute) than 'Walk It Off In 30 Days.' But Walk It Off is designed to be alternating 30-minute programs, while 5 Mega Miles is going to take 1 hour, 15 minutes in its entirety. That's a strong workout.

Because each mile walk can be selected individually from the top menu, you don't have  to do the entire DVD. But the warm up and cooldown sessions aren't included in the menu. You can get the warmup (which I recommend) by hitting play all, and get the cooldown by playing Mile 5. So I'd recommend doing 'Play All, doing the warm up, and then going back to the menu to select the miles you want to do. Miles 1, 3 and 5 are brisk cardio programs, while 2 and 4 mix in the stretch band, so the pace is a little slower. Mix and match! If I want a little less than an hour, I really like warmup, mile 1, mile 3 and mile 5 and cooldown. If I want an hour, mix in mile 2 or 4.

This program is fast-paced and aerobic, especially miles 3 and 5. But to Leslie's credit, she gives you options to lower the impact, and in Mile 3 Brianna demonstrates the moves. Trust me, Brianna is still getting a great workout. I wouldn't recommend doing Mile 3 without first doing the warmup or Mile 1, which is low impact but still very aerobic.

Here's what I like about Leslie Sansone's DVDs: They are doable. You can bump up the workout, or keep it simpler, but in the end YOU CAN DO IT.",1487289600,13,1852,4.252840909090909
5832653,5,B00DLX76BY,Love her videos. They are a decent workout right in the comfort of your home. She shows both low and higher impact ways of doing the steps.,1486598400,,139,4.185185185185185

The variety from one mile to the next keeps it interesting as one mile utilizes the exercise band (I used weights instead) , another is a little higher impact, another focuses on abdominals, etc.  I have an Apple Watch which indicated that I burned over 500 calories after the 5 miles which could be expected as it is over an hour long.

5832672,2,B00DLX76BY,"I honestly didn't finish this video because the walkers in the first mile were so distracting.  I tried adjusting the perspective on the tv thinking maybe that was why the two walkers on her direct left and right looked so bizarre, but it didn't help any.  There is also something so gross about people wearing super low cut shoes and no socks.  As far as the actual exercise routine I thought the first mile was kind of slow.  I fast forwarded to the 2nd mile hoping she might have changed walkers, so I would be free of the freakasaurus in purple shoes.  Mile 2 uses one of her toning bands, I don't have the band and her routines with it aren't challenging w/o one.  I have done other Leslie routines before, I lost 80 pounds ten years ago doing her 4 mile super challenge once or twice a day.  I have also done her 5 mile fat burning walk which is awesome because it's just fast walking/jogging the whole time, no stupid resistance bands.

I have a bad back & knees so I wear supports while walking.  Doing the walk tapes with my supports makes me work out all muscles without feeling self-conscious.  Leslie is dynamic and inspiring.

This one requires much more muscle to use and makes for an intense workout if you increase the tension. I found that I did work up a sweat on this program, more so than most of the others (though I do boost those). The 5 miles take a lot of time, so I usually go 4, changing out the one I skip each different time I work out. It is hard getting to know the new walkers and you don't immediately feel the same connection as her older tapes (plus, they are getting much younger which is probably a good thing :) A good work out over all.",1474243200,,624,4.040322580645161

5832686,3,B00DLX76BY,I have several of Leslie Sansone videos and love them but this one doesn't feel like I am getting the miles in.  Her other videos are mostly walking moves that keep your heart rate up and give you the steps you need for health.  This video has segments that include several minutes of using the band that is provided with the video.  I have never been a fan of trying to mix cardio with strength training and my preference is confirmed by this video.  It leaves you wondering how you actually walked a mile in some of the segments.,1473465600,,531,4.333333333333333

5832688,4,B00DLX76BY,Good for those looking for simple moves and lower impact.  There is some light impact in part of it but you can modify.  This would be good for those just starting to work out or who are looking for a lighter work out just to get you moving.  This would be the opposite of a hard core sweat dripping off your nose jumping screaming intense cardio bootcamp workout.  It's not high fashion and it's not going to make you ripped but it will get your steps in for the day.,1472342400,,468,4.166666666666667

I am able to work out to a more intense program if I feel like it or if I had a busier day, I can have a slower paced workout -  I have a Fitbit, and using Leslie with my Fitbit assures me of a good, solid 5 mile (or more) day almost every weekday. I'm on my feet at work but usually find myself short anywhere from 1 to 2 miles to get my 5 mile day in and that's when I can pop in this video, pick a color and get a mile (or two, or more) without feeling like I've shorted myself. The bands weren't a big deal - and I don't use them, so I can't really comment on them but I do like the workout video.",1468454400,,629,3.625

5832723,5,B00DLX76BY,"This DVD is a welcome addition to my Leslie Sansone collection. I prefer videos that include boosted walking segments and exercises for toning, which this one does.

MILE 1 is a classic low impact mile
MILE 2, Walk and Tone, uses the toning band during parts of the walk to strengthen arms
MILE 3, Speed Intervals, is a faster mile
MILE 4, Strength intervals, alternates walking with lunges, squats and arm moves using the toning band
MILE 5 is the Ab Walk and cool down

PROS: Leslie has added some new moves--the cha-cha and skater. A mile countdown, which begins when there are ten minutes left, has been added as well. The other exercisers work at various levels of intensity, which is helpful if you want to step your workout up, or take it easier. The music is fairly innocuous and there's not too much giggling and chatter. And...the DVD includes a free toning band.

CONS: There's not much lower body work. MILE 2 concentrates on the arms and MILE 4 has only a few lunges and squats which alternate with arm exercises. I skip the arm movements and do extra lunges and squats. After I've done this workout a few times, I will probably pause it during MILE 4 to add even more lunges and squats.

All in all, I'd recommend this DVD.",1459814400,,1237,4.508928571428571
5832724,5,B00DLX76BY,Use this DVD at least one a week.  Great for toning.,1459728000,,52,3.727272727272727
5832725,5,B00DLX76BY,"I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, I work out 4-6 days a week I'm more of a cardio girl but just getting into weight training. My level umm is intermediate. So when i tell you this DVD is definitely a challenge for me I mean it gives me a good work out and allows me to get my steps goal in. (12K daily). If you are an advanced athlete and  use to interval training this might not be a DVD for you.

The one thing I like about this DVD is we don't have to go over the core moves (side steps, walk, knee lifts and kicks) per mile. Once you end one mile the next one starts almost seamlessly and I like that. However saying that doesn't mean you cannot choose to do mile 3 then mile 5; you can still customize the mile if you like.

If you are use to Leslie Sansome style then you will understand this statement, I believe this is one of my favorite boosted mile DVD's. My heart rate was up there and I got a great work out last night. I borrowed this DVD from the library and now I will purchase it. Oh yea BONUS it comes with the firm band and these bands really helped me with the under bra hanging and my arm (triceps).

5832726,5,B00DLX76BY,"I enjoy working out to this when I can't get out and walk outside. I feel this gives me some variety than just walking on my treadmill and honestly, I think I get a better workout than when I walk on my treadmill. I really feel the sweat and burn and this gives you an all over low impact workout which you don't get when you just walk as only your low body gets the most benefit.

I do have to mention that my kids hate when I workout to this video only because Leslie will say, ""Walk, Walk, Walk..."" a lot and they get sick of hearing her doing that. LOL. So you may not want to workout to this if family is in the same room, or maybe you do if you want to bug them.",1458432000,,668,3.8405797101449277

I have a few players and they all come up with the same message.  VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING!  This  now makes me reluctant to buy any more through AMAZON.

Routines with more complicated choreography do not appeal to me as they once did, and some, such as step routines with many turns and changes, are a little frightening. We do tend to lose balance a bit as we age. But this routine is absolutely within my range, and I add a few things,like pendulums instead of sidesteps, etc.  etc. to make it mine. The ""higher"" impact is a piece of cake. Use the stretch band as your body tells you to use it.

I hate the toning band.., even when I force myself to do the 2 miles with it I don't think it is as effective as weights. It's really uncomfortable to hold and create resistance. When skipping those 2 miles the other 3 miles are good and I really like the boosted sections. I am not as entertained with the other walkers as in other Leslie workouts. And there are awkward transitions in music at times and when moving from one mile to the next.

Held my breath putting this one on, but was pleasantly surprised.  Leslie's a bit more low-key than in some of the others, which is nice.  Good variation in the workout, some new faces in the crew.  As someone who tends to like to walk and neglect weights work, this was a good one for me.  Took me a bit to get the hang of walking and using the elastic band at the same time, but I can feel it working.

What I find particularly annoying is all the make up, smoky eye make up look, and false eyelashes (who, for crying out loud, wears false eyelashes to workout?). I have to say that overdoing it with regards to vanity is just silly. Come on Leslie, most women tie their hair back and don't wear all that heavy make up when they workout. You'd look so much better without it.

So often I've tried other workouts that had me guessing what on earth they had in ind the whole time... the power walk steps are predictable and it made it easy to fall rit into burning.  Great video... Great workout and intensity level.",1444521600,,320,4.696428571428571
5832750,5,B00DLX76BY,"I think this is a good workout if you are willing to really put the work in. I appreciate that Leslie had one walker, Cain, show some higher intensity versions of the movements to show people simple ways to bump up the burn. I the variety that you get with this DVD. I also like the heavier / thicker stretchy band that comes included with the DVD set. I've used a lot of different DVD workouts over the years, but I always seem to find my way back to Leslie, and a large part of that is because she somehow manages to keep things fresh. I don't mind the new crowd that Leslie has walking with her now, but I do miss seeing some of the veteran walkers by her side.",1444435200,3,664,4.076335877862595

Every mile is separated and allows you to be flexible with your daily workouts - you can choose to do 3 miles one day, 1 mile the next, or the whole 5 miles. Overall a low impact, enjoyable way to exercise in your home. There are plenty of opportunities throughout the workout to ""boost"" your calorie burn and up the intensity, all to your comfort/fitness level. Just because it's a walking video, doesn't mean you won't break a sweat! You get out what you put into it. I'm 33 and healthy and I love this workout!",1444176000,2,589,4.462962962962963

5832754,5,B00DLX76BY,"Good workout.  This is my 5th Leslie Sansone workout dvd and it is challenging.  I started working out about a month ago everyday with the stretch band (which is included w/the dvd purchase) I notice a difference in  my upper back, shoulders and arms (toned, sculpted, not as jiggly). My upper thighs and legs are toned and have actually gotten slimmer. I like how Leslie alternates between walking & working w/the bands.  You start with a  warm up, 1st mile is her basic walking mile, 2nd mile you work with the bands and boy do you feel that burn in your arms, shoulders and back.  3rd mile is a speed interval mile w/no band.  4th mile works your biceps, triceps, working in squats and lunges. 5th mile is geared to your waistline and boosting your walk.  There is a cool down walk and a bit of stretching for the arms and waist.  There was no stretching of the lower legs, back and hamstrings in this dvd.  No matter, I end up doing these on my own after the dvd is finished.  I've lost another inch in my waistline, and I couldn't be happier.  I do a 5 mile workout 5-6 days a week, this is what works for me.",1443398400,2,1114,4.277511961722488
5832755,5,B00DLX76BY,this is one of my go to videos!  the back up walkers have less bad habits than in some of her other videos.  the toning band works great for me.  leslie is a little saccrine but i don't mind.  she doesn't totally annoy me and i find i get bored easy.  i have several of her videos and i love this one in particular.,1442880000,,315,3.859375

5832763,5,B00DLX76BY,Havae been using Leslie Sansone exercise dvd's for about 5 years and this one is definitely a great workout!  works up a sweat - aerobics and strength training using a stretch band.  I recommend this for an advanced workout.,1439769600,,224,4.717948717948718
5832764,5,B00DLX76BY,"WHEW! Again, Leslie knocks it outta the park!! This had me moving and working but NOT doing jarring moves that would hurt my joints. I have an arthritic knee and bursitis in my left hip. I'm a freakin mess. This actually helps move and loosen those tight joints up! She always makes modifications that get your heart rate up there so NO EXCUSES for being a couch potato!! She does use a stretch band in this one, so you'll need one on-hand, and I always say that if this isn't quite challenging enough you can add hand and ankle weights (only add ankle weights if you're medically able to, as they can potentially be hard on your knees if you're not experienced). The music is good, the queuing is decent, she does get off on a chatty tangent sometimes so she's not great with her queues but she just makes you happy that somehow it's ok. Time FLIES with her, and I'll find ANY reason to be miserable when working out but I just can't find anything wrong with this one! SO GLAD I found Leslie.",1439164800,6,993,4.344086021505376
5832765,5,B00DLX76BY,"I was so skeptical about these walking workouts, but this gave me a serious workout.  Altogether I think the entire five miles took an hour and a half to complete and according to my polar ft4, I burned about 730 calories.  This calorie burn also includes what I would have burned had I not been working out, so the actual calorie burn is less I realize, but still, it was a really good work out.  They use bands for some of the miles, so I used my hand weights when I could and just did alternate lifting techniques.  The workout doesn't require much space at all, which is great because I rent a pretty small house.  This will be awesome during the winter when I can't get out to walk with my kids or when it is too hot in the summer.",1439078400,7,736,4.154929577464789
5832766,5,B00DLX76BY,"So far I am really pleased with this workout. The reason I have trouble with most workout videos is it is so hard to keep up with the moves, but this video only uses a few simple moves that are easy to follow. I had shoulder surgery a couple weeks ago and am able to do mile 1 modified easily and not use my right arm, as i am able to move my arm more, i will progress but I have watched the whole video and like it.

I've had it for a few weeks, now, and have lost a couple of pounds and several inches already. I am also mindful of the way that I eat and try to eat ""clean"" as they say, but I have treats once in a while, too. Normally I do all 5 miles (bands included, because who doesn't want toned arms, back, legs, etc?? Count me IN)! Today I had to switch things up so I did 3 walking miles and then did the two tone/strength miles later. I check my heart rate throughout, and since I am over 200 lbs right now, I average at close to 800 calories burned when I do all 5 miles (and put lots of energy into it). Not too shabby. One day I really gave it my all and burned close to 1000 calories. The miles fly by. Hubby keeps complimenting me on how ""tiny"" I keep getting. Haha. I highly recommend this one! I LOVE LESLIE!!!!

Tues evening/Sat morning that's when i have time to devote to a 5 miles workout, and it is a workout. Leslie is right calling it Mega Miles cause that's what it is, mega, meaning big. I have thought, at times, to break down the workout and do 1 or 2 miles but as soon as the music starts and i get into it, wow, the heart starts pumping and the sweat starts coming and there i go. When Leslie have us use the bands, in mile 2 & 4,  i get so excited with the pulling motion across the body. All i can hear my body saying is pull, pull, pull. This is a good one.

5832783,5,B00DLX76BY,I lost 30 lbs in 3 months doing this daily and eating healthy. Great workout video with low and high impact capabilities. Yes she talks a lot but I like the encouragement when I'm working out. I have back issues and found this worked well for me. It has 5 separate mls and by that I mean at the end of each mile there is a small gap/break. I liked this because if I feel like 1 ml I know when I have reached that mile. Great workout video- only issue for me is that it isn't available for instant video so I have bought the DVD twice since my kids lose or scratch it up.,1430006400,4,570,3.9224137931034484

For me, it's a fairly good 3 mile workout.  When I want to do something with resistance, I do her workouts with weights.  For me, they are much better.  Too bad, I can't just customize mile 1, 3 and 5 to do.  Doing it like this is well over 45 minutes and not a bad workout.",1428624000,2,427,3.8505747126436782
5832787,5,B00DLX76BY,"This is quite a challenge for chubby me and my skinny husband. I would like to recommend when using the band use the first count to get to the position she says and the remaining 3 to slowly release. You get more bang for your buck so to speak.

I also like that each mile is legitimately different. I think the first time I was pretty sure I couldn't finish but I wanted to see what the other miles were...so I did finish it. After doing it once I knew what was coming/left so I could push through a little easier. I was thinking about trying to find some people in my area to come join as it's much more fun with a group :-)",1428537600,2,626,4.008

This one is more vigorous than the previous ones I've purchased--lots of upper body work included.  It's a really good workout, and I think I'm going to like it a lot.  I appreciate the basic philosophy of her workouts--changing up the direction of the motion to get different muscle groups involved.

Variety is nice and keeps one motivated.  I love that there are not too many different steps, but the workout is great.

5832795,5,B00DLX76BY,"I absolutely LOVE this walk. It's not boring and there are some variations to her traditional walking moves. Here's the breakdown:

Warm-Up: Introduces the moves and warms up the body for the more intense workout to come.
Mile One: Classic Cardio. This is Leslie's signature one-mile walk. Very low impact.
Mile Two: Incorporates the ""stretchy band"" for a good upper body workout.
Mile Three: No stretchy band and is the fastest mile because it incorporates boosted intervals of jogging (very fast walking).
Mile Four: In this mile, you get a deeper muscle workout with the band but it's not quite a true mile because you're stopping to do the strength training. Lunges, squats, bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, etc.
Mile Five: This mile focuses on the abs and it does the trick! Focus on your core and keep moving!

The last 12 minutes of the video is a short ab routine done on the floor. I have not done this part of the video yet because, at the end of the 5 miles, I find that I really don't need it. Even without the ab routine at the end, I have found that during Mile Five, if I really focus and keep my tummy tight, I feel the tightened muscles in my abs the next day (or later in the same day depending on what time I've done my walk).  This video is now a permanent staple in my routine and I am proud to say that in just the two weeks I've been using it, I have noticed a difference in my waist line as well as my energy level. This is a must buy for Leslie fans looking to take their walks to the next level.",1425254400,46,1519,4.285714285714286
5832796,5,B00DLX76BY,Great option when you can't exercise outside.  Much better workout then on a treadmill.,1425254400,,87,5.214285714285714
5832797,5,B00DLX76BY,"a fun walk!  It's amazing what a great workout you can get ""just walking inside!"" ;)  Leslie makes the moves fun and really gets you moving and gets the heart rate up and blood flowing, and sweat going!

This is a really great workout, because she has it broken down into the individual miles, so you could do one mile, 2 miles, 3 miles, 4 miles, or 5 miles, and you can even decide as you go along, ""ok, I'll do another mile!""  :)

She incorporates exercise bands, which you would get if you bought the boxed dvd set, but obviously not with the download, which I got.  I'd love to have the bands, and may get those at another time :)",1425081600,,634,4.155737704918033

5832806,4,B00DLX76BY,"So, I bought this DVD based on the absolute overwhelming positive reviews regarding Leslie Sansone in general. As I was already doing cardio that equated to three miles with another DVD (more traditional cardio), I chose this one because of the promise of five miles. However, five miles is inaccurate.

I am one of those people that have something attached to them to monitor miles traveled and steps taken. I wear it 24/7 and it's fairly accurate. When it's inaccurate, it's generally because it's too generous with the miles/steps, rather than not giving it enough. When I do this complete workout I get 3.5 miles total. I've done it everyday for 1 week and I get the same miles every time.

With that being said, I still love this workout. It doesn't look like it's going to be intense, but it is. I work up a good sweat and multiple parts of me are sore when I'm done each day. I like the band that came with the DVD as well. It's a good quality band with mid level resistance.

There are some things that I'm not a big fan of, such as Leslie's 'surprise' when she sees who's walking with her in the middle of a class. Really? You didn't notice who was walking with you before you started? Also, I wouldn't mind being able to hear the students make noise and such during the workout. Hearing them grunt/groan or yell/whoop let's me feel like I'm more part of the class. Frankly, Leslie is my least favorite part of the workout, but that's based on personality and we all have our own tastes when it comes to that.

I'm not going to break this down to mile by mile or anything like that - a lot of reviewers already included it. I will say the video is good quality, the sound is great and the workout will help you to burn calories. I'd love a true 5 mile workout, but I'm still glad I made this purchase!",1423526400,2,1810,4.346153846153846

5832808,5,B00DLX76BY,"This DVD begins with a warm-up and then the option of 5 different miles, which go like this:

Mile 1 - low impact (just lots of standard walking steps)
Mile 2 - walk and tone (doing walking steps while incorporating the toning band that comes with the DVD)
Mile 3 - speed intervals (classic walking interspersed with revved up paces)
Mile 4 - strength intervals (again, the toning band makes an appearance)
Mile 5 - ab walk (moves to tone the abs)

The entire DVD is loads of fun, and energizing! The time clock makes its appearance again (yay!) and there's the option of picking and choosing which miles to walk.

5832810,5,B00DLX76BY,"I just got this DVD and I have done her 1,2,3 mile tape for years. I love it because it's easy to follow and because it's low impact. It also can be done no matter what the weather and the 1 mile is only 20 minutes long. So you can squeeze it in no matter your schedule. This DVD however brings out the tiger in me. My fitness level has increased and this tape pushes me harder but it is still easy to follow. My favorite part is she has added a new variety of steps and grape vining is so much fun to me in a workout. She adds Cha Chas and tapping to the side with a twist at the waist. Each mile is geared to a particular achievement and the abs were definitely worked in the second mile. I love this DVD and you can do as many miles as you want. It is a nice addition to my collection of the walk away the pounds and the variety is what makes it so additive.",1422403200,2,861,3.842696629213483
5832811,4,B00DLX76BY,"I really like Leslie Sansone's walking DVDs - I first got turned on to them at a Weight Watcher's meeting.  I've been using them for about a year - they're super for me - I can exercise when I want to, and at home!  I like the 5 Mega Miles - a good workout when I do all the miles, and great to select just the abs walk.  The pace is great - except for the toning sections.  Those are toooooo slow, and not enough for good muscle toning, for me!  My biggest complaint with this - and bascally all Leslie's DVDs - is that she talks and 'jokes' around too much.  Encouragement, yes, but there are never more than 5 seconds between comments!  I also tune out the religious comments - hey, Leslie, not all of us are Christian!  Otherwise, I love this method of exercising!",1421107200,,768,4.1768707482993195

This is a nice addition to my collection.  As others have mentioned, there is no separate warm up and cool down but you can do the warm up on the first mile, pick and choose from the other miles, and then skip to the cool down at the end of the 5th mile.  The toning band is also thicker than the ones in her earlier DVDs and is much harder to stretch.  I did 3 miles one day and the other 2 miles the next day.  Both workouts left me sweating (but I also hold a 4 lb weight in each hand for more intensity).

Her cool down is missing the leg stretches though.  It's not a big deal for me, I just add them in, but for someone who isn't used to walking a lot, the leg stretches are a must.",1420329600,,820,3.7267441860465116

5832830,4,B00DLX76BY,"I have several of Leslie's DVDs.  This one does not disappoint if you are  looking for a workout to get your heart pumping.  The toning exercises in the second mile not only make this routine more challenging, but are convenient because all you need is a band.  Each mile ramps up the speed a little more so buy the end you are truly sweating.  I recommend this for days when you have a lot of time, it runs about an hour and a half.  The stretching routine is at the very end and there is an additional floor workout for the abs.
Since I video streamed it I can't tell if you can play particular segments.  When video streaming you don't have that option readily available.  You have to move the cursor back an forth to get it at the point you want it.  If you did than you could pick the exercises you want to do on any particular day.  I rated it four stars only because it could be a bit repetitious in some segments.
As to complaints I've read about her tapes not really giving you a challenging workout, than you should try other tapes. I recently damaged my rotatory cuff and had not exercised for several weeks.  I needed something to get me back up. Leslie's tapes inspire you to get up off the couch. They build stamina and confidence. I don't think they are intended for advanced exercisers. If you want that level try PX 90 or Jillian:)",1414800000,2,1348,4.288537549407114

The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating was because Leslie only used one older woman in the video, and the camera didn't show her as much as the younger , attractive, very fit participants.

I am an older exerciser, and in pretty good shape for my age. I had to give up some of the harder core workouts for that reason. it seems to me that leslie used to show a more varied exercising group in her older videos..and I have a bunch of them.

5832840,5,B00DLX76BY,"I have many of her videos.  I like them all well enough, but there are 3 that I LOVE and this makes that list.  The other two are the walk to the hits videos.  I love this because you get a complete workout as in mile 1 is basic, mile 2 really works out your arms with a resistance band, mile 3 is some serious cardio with HIITs, mile 4 does some deeper muscle work including lunges, bicep curls, and squats, and mile 5 keeps you focused on squeezing in your abs.

There is a 5 minute warm up in the beginning, but the first 5 minutes of mile 1 is the same song and same speed, so if you wanted to skip this you could.  There is also a longer cool down at the end that I normally skip because the last 5 minutes of mile 5 is slower.  I do a few stretches on my own and am good to go.

I am a step counter so I will say that step wise you won't get 10,000 steps off of this.  I usually end up with right at 9,000 when I do the warm up through the end of mile 5.  This is mostly due to mile 4.  You stop walking 3 times, once for lunges, once for bicep curls, and once for squats.  You probably only really walk 1,000 steps in this mile.

Start to finish I usually plan on spending about 1 hour and 20 minutes on this, im not really sure if the last 13 minutes is cool down or what cause I have never watched that far, I have watched a few minutes of the cool down before switching it off.

Leslie can be kind of cheesy and she really is not in this one, and she says things that keep me on track, like reminding me how good it is for my body and my muscles, and focusing on muscles works them more, etc.

The music is pretty good.  Music wise, walk to the hits is my favorite, but this one is not bad, and the music switches at a minimum every 5 minutes so that is good too.",1412380800,16,1773,3.8060109289617485
5832841,4,B00DLX76BY,"I really like Leslie Sansone's exercises. These walks are a little faster and slightly more challenging, but in a good way.  I can still do them.  I like that you can pick and choose to do one mile or all the miles or pick out 2 or 3 miles to do.  What I don't like is that using Amazon Instant Video, all five miles are as one video, so you have to fast forward over the miles if you want to skip ahead to a different one.  They should be listed separately or there should be a way to choose the warm up, cool down, and whichever miles you want in between.  But at least they should be listed separately to make it easier to choose.

I'm still pleased with this purchase, though. I can do these exercises at home, but it's also easy to call them up on my iPad to do them when I'm traveling, too.",1410739200,,796,4.006329113924051

This is not for a beginner, but the way the dvd is structured you could just do one mile each day until you build up.  My only complaint about this dvd is that there is no stretching for legs at the end at all.  After a 5 mile walk, you need to stretch those calves, hip flexors and hammys...Easy enough to do some stretches on your own though.

Additionally, the music encourages bumping your moves up to a jog even when it isn't called for during the routine. Very nice.

5832877,4,B00DLX76BY,"Leslie's workouts were one of the first I found when I first got into DVDs.  I like the workouts themselves, they are always good for starting out when I found most things intimidating or getting back into doing things regularly after a break, or just when you don't want to think too much (ie, steps are simple).  But omg, her constant chatter and over the top WEEEE! ISN""T THIS FUN!  DON""T YOU JUST LOVE TO WALK! enthusiasm just drove me nuts. Bonkers.  I'd be working out and yelling at the tv.  Well this one has a very fine and easy to find Music Only option.  YIPEEE!  More dvds should have this.  A lot more.  Most even. But especially Leslie, and Denise Austin, the top two chatter boxes.  Some people must like it, as she sure does keep selling videos, but I'm just glad I can now get the workout without the chatter.  THANK YOU, Leslie please keep this feature.

Workout is about the same as all the others. For those new to her videos they are generally on a more beginner level. Not as slow as the new ones from Jane Fonda, but nothing super intense and the steps are very basic ones, no complicated choreography.

I am docking it 1 start though since the music does kind of suck (sounds like a kid with an old computer wrote it), and there is no separate warm up and cooldown, or way to get to it quickly.",1398816000,2,1318,4.308943089430894
5832878,2,B00DLX76BY,"After using previous 5 mile videos by Leslie, I thought that this newer version would have more of a run/walk sequence like the others. Instead it has a mile where you stop, and use the flex bands. If I wanted a workout video, I would've bought a different instructor's video. I expected to get a walk/run sequence.  I found this video disappointing. Better off using the older version.",1398124800,,386,4.676470588235294

5832884,5,B00DLX76BY,Leslie's group changed this CVD by including a timer in bottom corner.  I like that because sometimes my morning workout is on a tight schedule.  She also used strengthening bands for two of the miles.  I am getting very toned.,1396742400,2,227,4.625

With the lovely Midwest winters we have been having, I can't tell you the last time that I have been able to do that. This CD is perfect for me! It has 5 different ""miles"". I can do any one of them or any combo of them that I choose. There is NOTHING difficult. No moves you can't follow. I pretty much have it memorized which is also nice because you can just play the music and not listen to the instruction. I feel like I am getting a good enough workout without over doing it.

Even though this is time consuming (I do the entire 5 miles at one time- about an hour and 20 minutes), I really feel like I've accomplished something by the end, so I make the time to do a 5 mile walk at least once per week.

So you can do just 1 or you can choose 3... I especially like how she announces each mile marker as you reach it. Once you get started, you're always done before you know it.

5832901,4,B00DLX76BY,Really great workout.  I have worked out with Leslie before and have found her engaging without being overly peppy.  She makes it easy by telling you when she will change steps.  The pace is great for getting a good sweat in an I really enjoyed the #2 workout that included the band. (not a big fan of the #4 band workout)  All in all it is an great workout and I would recommend it,1391990400,2,382,4.121621621621622

5832903,3,B00DLX76BY,"I've purchased a lot of Leslie Sansone DVDs over the years.  Generally, there isn't much to distinguish one from another, except for what set she is on or who is walking with her.  This one is shot in a light, bright space.  Much better than the black curtain she filmed in front of for a long time, but still not the outdoor setting her fans keep begging for.  None of her cast members from the early days are with her in this one, so if you're looking for new - young -  faces perhaps you'll like this.  Personally I'm a little disappointed that she seems to have abandoned Carol, MaryKay, Linda and Joanne in favor of a decidedly younger crowd.  Not sure if her make-up tips are coming from a younger crowd as well, but in this video she is painted up with a heavy-handed ""smokey eye"", which I found kind of weird and distracting.  Another issue (for me) is that there is no way to combine certain miles for a non-stop workout - you have to pick and choose individual miles, or select play all, keep the remote handy, and then skip from one section to another. Definitely does not take advantage of the latest/greatest DVD technology.  Last but not least, whether you manage to stick through the whole five miles or you just fast forward to the end, you'll find there is no real stretch after the cool down.  Granted most people should do more stretching than she usually offers anyway, but here there is no calf or hamstring stretch at all.  Nada.  After five miles.  Are you kidding me?!  This is probably the last Leslie DVD I'll ever buy, and I'm giving it to the library.  Leslie's DVDs got me off the couch and moving several years ago, and I'm grateful to her for that, but I'm just not into what she is selling now.",1391904000,10,1726,4.383647798742138

I was starting to get bored and my body used to the other workouts but after 2 days with this one, my muscles feel it which I love.  The ONLY reason I didn't give 5 stars is a reason that drives me nuts.  They don't do the entire 5 miles with you in one workout.  After each mile they go get changed, do their hair and have make up put on.  You do NOT look like that after a workout like this and I would prefer they are as sweaty and rugged looking as most of us working out.  Otherwise a great DVD",1391212800,2,633,3.8230769230769233

Sure this tape may have been put together, from previously taped miles in 2013, but this DVD/walk  is dated.  I suggest if you are looking for ""fresh"" you keep this in mind because LOTS of her DVD, with Bright Fresh covers are really OLD walks ""re-released.""  In the first miles one chick has one a ""flash dance"" type of outfit. Music is nothing - techno, synthesized, rhythm.  Now for the guts each miles is very well described on the DVD jacket.  While I would like some NEW stuff I did like this DVD for the variety on it.  Two features I like on the tape is first you can do Music Only, and I surely get tired of Leslie's non-stop chit-chat, and second this is the only DVD (I have 12) that I noticed has a time meter on it so you know when that ""mile"" is running out.  I liked that and Leslie if you read this Do it on all you DVD/walks.

I do these workouts five to six times a week and they really keep me in shape!",1383004800,2,576,4.355140186915888
5832935,3,B00DLX76BY,"I have over 30 Leslie Sansone DVDs and am a big fan of her style of exercise.  While all of them will give you a great workout (it's what you put into it that counts), it's the little things that make some of the workouts more enjoyable than others.

Music - No popular tunes in this one, just a basic (could get on your nerves) techno background beat.

Fun Factor - This DVD is more serious than most.  Not the various amounts o joking around, laughing, and having fun that are at the core of some of her other DVDs.  More focus on the moves than the friendships.

Stretchy Band - This DVD comes with a good quality, heavy stretchy band.

Total Exercise Time - 1hour, 25 min.

No Stretching at the end of this DVD.  One of the reasons I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone is her warm ups, cool downs and stretching segments.  If you want a good stretch after this workout (and you will want a good stretch), have another DVD ready to queue up to fill that void.

The Warm Up (5 min):  This workout has the regular warm up moves that you expect from these workouts.

Mile 1 (15 min):  This is called the Classic Mile, and it should probably be called the ""new"" classics mile as it does have 1 minutes of optional gentle jogging at the 12 minute mark.

Mile 2 (15 min):  This mile uses the stretchy band and focuses on the upper body only.  It is uneventful otherwise.

Mile 3 (13 min):  This mile has 3 optional boosted walking segments that last approximately 2 minutes each.  There are 2 new (to me) moves in this mile, a ""Skater"" which is a side-to-side move but you put your leg in the back and a new punching move (adapted from her kickboxing DVD) where you are shifting side to side and punching forward.  Nothing that's hard to follow, just a new one to keep it interesting.

Mile 4 (13 min):  This mile uses the stretchy band and works the lower body with some lunges and squats (not too many) and some upper body/arm exercises.  There is an optional gentle  job for about 30 seconds a the 6 minute mark).

Mile 5 (15 min):  This mile focuses on abs from the basic, classic cardio moves that she does with kicks and knee lifts.  Otherwise uneventful.

5832937,5,B00DLX76BY,"I have been doing Leslie tapes for about eight years, so far the only workout I have done regularly. I really like this new tape,  I only do four miles for foot injury reasons, it seems adding that fifth mile seems to aggravate it, but I figured I could change the miles as I go with this DVD. I love it, I had not realized that since I have used the other four mile tape so regularly, it was not really challenging me anymore, I found this out after I started using this DVD.
I switch the miles around, the button on the remote that moves the tape forward or backward a whole section makes this easy, and I like the fact I can change it up every day if I want. There is more ""boosted"" walking, and two segments of the band use, so I can switch between them if I want. If you are a regular Leslie user, I think you would like this DVD, if not a regular ,give it a chance. It is a great workout, especially for someone my age (57) that has a problem foot and sometimes a small problem with my knee.",1382054400,2,997,4.010050251256281

I generally do 4& 5 mile workouts, and also the newer 3 miles as the pace is faster. This workout doesn't disappoint-the pace is quick, there are a couple newer moves, & the cast is young which I find inspirational in making the usual moves a little bigger. That being said, I also own her Walk Slim 5 mile DVD that came out a year or two ago-these 2 workouts are very similar in design-walking segment, strengthening section using the band, firming section with more lunges etc & a faster walk mile. I don't mind the duplication as I prefer the newer DVDs, but many may consider them redundant.",1381622400,4,703,4.333333333333333

The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because when a program gives you the flexibility of doing one or more miles each workout, the warm up and cool down need to be separate segments.  To be a very effective DVD, the user should be able to view the warm up and cool down no matter what miles she did that day.  And by the way, what happened to stretching?  After the cool down, there is no stretching.

Almost a 5 star program.",1381017600,2,695,4.029197080291971

5832949,5,B00DLX76BY,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; please see that web site for a more detailed version of my review.

As the title of this DVD suggests, the workout consists of five total miles, but each mile is chaptered individually, allowing users to customize their workout length.  In addition, the DVD comes with a resistance band:  this band is used during two of the segments to provide a strength training effect along with the cardio workout.

As always, instructor Leslie Sansone is teaching live with a group of about eight background exercisers (she has the same group in all the routines, although their outfits and positions change).  The Main Menu lists selections for ""Play Full Workout"" and also the five miles individually, each with a ""Play"" and ""Play with Music Only"" option.  I have provided additional details below.

WARM-UP (5 minutes)

The warm-up can be accessed by choosing the ""Play All"" option only.  Here Sansone sets the pace for the walk as well as introduces her ""core"" steps, which include walking (really marching), side step, kicks, and knees.

MILE 1, CLASSIC LOW IMPACT (15 minutes)

This is a very typical Leslie Sansone walk which includes all of her classic steps (not only those mentioned above but also hamstring curls, step outs, etc.).  As the name implies, the walk is mostly low impact, although Sansone does work in a jog burst towards the end (no modifier is shown).

MILE 2, WALK AND TONE (15 minutes)

This is the first segment which uses the band.  Sansone does a nice job of incorporating arm movements using the band into a walk that is still at a brisk pace.  However, there are also periods when she does not use the band and focuses on the cardio only.

MILE 3, SPEED INTERVAL (13.5 minutes)

This segment is a bit shorter; Sansone notes that this is because the pace is faster.  There are more of what Sansone terms ""gentle jogs"" included here, but this time, one of the background exercisers, Brianna, modifies the impact moves.

MILE 4, STRENGTH INTERVALS (13 minutes)

The band is again used for this section.  However, unlike Mile 2, which used the band concurrently with the cardio, here Sansone alternates the cardio and strength work.  She begins with a fast-paced walk (about 5 minutes).  She then stops and anchors the band under one foot for a set of static lunges; these are repeated on the second side.  Another fast walk sequence follows, and then a set of double bicep curls/alternating bicep curls with the band.  After the final fast walk, Sansone finishes this mile with squats and single-arm tricep extensions.

MILE 5, AB WALK (15 minutes)

This mile is intended to focus more on the abs/core.  There are extra rotational movements, and Sansone also adds in a few other new moves such as cha-cha and grapevine.

COOL-DOWN (5 minutes)

Here Sansone introduces a new walker:  Laurie, who has lost 140 lbs.  The majority of the cool-down is consists simply of slowing down the walk pace, with the last minute or so including some very basic stretching.

As noted above, the main advantage of this DVD is the chaptered format, allowing users to customize a workout of a single mile to five full miles, or fifteen minutes to well over an hour.  (It would have been even better had the Warm-Up and Cool-Down been chaptered separately as well, but users can skip to these sections easily enough using a remote.)  Another nice feature of this release is that all of the miles are performed at a brisk pace, which should make this video more appealing to a wider range of exercisers.  In summary, this is one of the best, most versatile offerings that I have seen from Leslie Sansone, and I definitely recommend it.",1380499200,79,3734,4.758566978193146
5832950,5,B00DLX76BY,"I had considered skipping purchasing this one after reading a particular review about the production of the DVD. I'm so glad that I took a leap of faith and just decided to experience it for myself. The curiosity was too great. I am so impressed with Leslie because the mega miles consist of toning, speed intervals, strength intervals, and ab concentration. It's almost like an all-in-one workout except for floor work.

***Menu Screen***
1. Play All
2. Mile 1 (with or without music)
3. Mile 2 (with or without music)
4. Mile 3 (with or without music)
5. Mile 4 (with or without music)
6. Mile 5 (with or without music)

***Pros***

- Music: Picture it this way; if you can remember Janet Jackson's video called Rhythm Nation, then you certainly remember the dim and dark background or area she danced through. The music in this DVD reminds me of that, only replace Janet and her dancers with human beings wearing a cyborg suits exercising with Leslie. That's exactly what the music reminds me of in this workout. I think her choice of artist this time is more favorable. When you first listen to it, you may not pick up the beat right away. But when you do the full workout at least a second time, you'll enjoy the music more. You will definitely pick up the beat if you choose the 'music only' option, which is why I'm glad that option is available becuase the music is actually very nice this time. The warm up song repeats into mile one, mile 4, and then the cool down. I would give the music a 4.5 out of 5. It really helps you move.

- Clock: The clock at the bottom only appears when you have 10 minutes left until the mile is over. So, by the time that second song hits, the clock will appear and it will stay there. But I'll say this; those are the LONGEST 10 minutes ever! It does seem like the miles on this DVD are a lot longer but that's probably because the miles are more challenging. It's MEGA.

- Her Friends: There's one guy and the rest are women. There's one woman that's probably as old as Leslie but the rest are like collage age. All are in good shape. I think Cain/King is the guy's name but I like watching him sometimes because his moves can be fancy. Their apparels are really nice. They change colors throughout the workout. There were a few things they wore that I actually wanted to buy, like Leslie's really cute shirt she wore during the second mile. There's a woman name Angela there that wore a lot of nice and cute things.

- Energy: This entire workout requires a lot of water intake, patience, push, and energy. When I first did it, water never tasted any better, but it also ran out faster. If you're like me, You can just do all the five miles at once and I've been waiting on her to do a really good challenging DVD and believe me, this is it. Unfortunately, this may not be a workout for those who are a little older. This is HIGH intensity. If you're around my weight (170-157) you can surely do this. But there's a reason why she has younger people with her in this workout.

**Cons**
As you saw up above she's got all miles and then each individual mile listed on the menu screen. However, if you choose to do 'play full workout' option, it does not give you the option to choose 'with or without music'. That's only for the individual miles. But there is a trick. Just choose mile 1 'music only' and the workout will continue to go on from there. It won't bring you back to the menu after you're done with a mile. It will just keep going, even if you choose music only. The only bad thing about this 'trick' is that if you do start from mile 1 on the menu screen, you miss out on the warm up because the warm up is ONLY part of the 'play full workout' option.

There is no warm up or cool down option on the menu screen. BUT, your DVD remote should have a 'next' or 'next chapter' button. Just choose that at the beginning of Mile 5 to skip to the cool down. The cool down has it own chapter even though it's not on the menu screen.

It looks to me like those responsible for her DVD layout were perhaps rushing through. But please do not let this influence your buying options. The workout is still fantastic and it's a good experience where you'll know a different atmosphere, music, and faces. And again, if you're like me and just do all the workouts at once, this should not bother you much anyway. This is the only MAJOR con I think of because you don't have a lot of freedom. I understand many of her fans would love to schedule and make their own combination mile settings. We should get the word out more on her Facebook page.

- Key on moves
Leslie does get off step here and there or she'll forget to warn you when the kicks, etc, are coming up. It's not severe. But I'm sure we're all veteran walkers now. So, it should not be much of an issue to keep up with her.
***********************
**Miles**

Mile 1 (Classic Low Impact)
It's claimed to be low impact...but it's not and I like that because I like competitive workouts. There is boosted walks and a lot of arm movement as well.

Mile 2: (Walk & Tone)
This mile will get your teeth gritting, especially when she exaggerates the moves longer due to talking too much. This band mile features stretching the band in front of you, behind you, above you, and to the sides. She'll give you a few SMALL breaks in between, but you'll find yourself quickly returning to the bands. On this mile, you do not stop moving completely, you will continue to move with or without band use. I was already very tired by the time it was within 2 minutes of the band usage. VERY competitive stuff! I know most people would prefer she leave the band as a separate thing from the entire workout. But look at it this way; You are getting your arms TONED. You'll have sexy beach arms instead of jiggly flesh. Think of the cute tank tops you can wear. All Leslie is doing is applying more concentration at another area of the body.

MIle 3: (Speed Intervals)
Intervals! Yes! There is a lot of jogging and shifts, plus side kickboxing. Bri is also in this workout and she'll provide a low-impact version for this mile only. The intervals are done three times throughout the mile.

Mile 4 (Strength Intervals)
By the time you get to this mile, you're probably already be very exhausted and don't feel like doing a SECOND mile of band workout. This band workout as actually more pleasant because it's targeting the bottom such as your legs. There's the word interval again, so for three times, you'll go back and forth through fast walk and band workout. There is some pausing because you have to do lunges and squats. And I'm grateful for the pauses because that gives you time to gather your energy.

I DESPISE Lunges, so, I just substitute for squats. I think there is a little bit of boosted walk in this mile along with four-knee set. If you think by going back and forth to the bands and pausing is losing your progress, you're NOT, because she provides excellent arm toning where you feel the burn, plus she makes up for the 'pauses' with the fast walk intervals.

Mile 5 (Ab Walk)
I really wanted to reach through the screen and yell at Leslie to tone it down! Ugh, I was so tired! But I can't be a hypocrite because I wanted this! I wanted a tough workout. She will use knees (one, and four sets). She will do the 'skater' move about two times, side steps but also with a turn while reaching out. She uses the 'cha-cha' twice. The cha-chas were just too much. I was so tired. When she did it the first time, I thought she extended it out a wee bit too much, but again...she was talking. :p

Cool Down & Stretch
The cool down is when she'll introduce a lady that has lost a BUTT LOAD of pounds. You can see her story on Leslie's website. Very good encouragement. The cool down is usual, but the stretch was pretty short. All she gave was just the reach upward, forward, and sides. That's it. There was nothing for the legs. But I have a feeling that maybe it had something to do with the length of the DVD. Maybe she was not allowed to have a full stretch session. Who knows. But we all know her by now. You can just do them on your own. Plus her stretches are never really long enough for your body to get a REALLY good amount of stretch anyway.

**Additional Information**
When I first did the full workout, I burned 598 calories. When I did it a second time, it was 570. The third time, it was 607 calories. The trick is to just make sure you exaggerate arm movement. You'll burn more. Even when she did not use arms, I did anyway. So for a workout that's almost 600 calories, that's basically TWO meals burned off.",1380412800,121,8611,4.324659231722428
