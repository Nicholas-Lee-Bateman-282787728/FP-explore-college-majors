1338995,5,B00004CJTU,This is a movie that will restore your faith in people; that they are genuinely kind and helpful to others in need.  The good values imparted on the railway children by their parents transend time periods. The values are as relevant now as in 1905.,1211932800,,248,4.511111111111111
1338996,4,B00004CJTU,"Most of the family will enjoy this, especially if they like Masterpiece Theater movies. This is the style like ""Pride and Prejudice"" where over time a familiarity and respect develops. This is similar to Disney movies made about 30 years ago. They don't make many like it any longer unfortunately. Three English children are told their father will be away for some time and they must go to the country to live like the poor. They are saddened and yet optimistic there will be new things to see and do. The settings in Victorian England are very well done. The cast and story is what really makes the movie. Special appearance by Sir Richard Attenborough is well received. Even though he is only seen briefly throughout the movie, his part is well performed. This movie is not fast paced, but if you are patient about watching it will pay off. Fans of foreign movies like ""Waiting for Ned Divine"" will probably enjoy it.",1181260800,,919,4.644171779141105
1338997,5,B00004CJTU,"My mother read this book to us when we were kids and I am a huge E. Nesbit fan. I was happy to find that this film was faithful to the book, even to those absolutely killing little pure Nesbit comic moments. Of course things had to be a bit compressed (I wonder why they didn't include the part where Perks actually catches Peter stealing the coal) and I suppose they couldn't include all of the children's escapades (like the one withe the canal boat that catches on fire) and Peter's hairstyle is a bit too 70s in my opinion (maybe I'm wrong about that though), but otherwise I enjoyed it (the part with the brass band at the party is really quite funny). I haven't seen the more recent version, but I can definitely say that if you want an entertaining film that stays refreshingly close to the book you loved as a kid, get this one.",1150416000,11,836,4.2974683544303796

After all these years, it's still my favorite movie of all time because it's gentle, no one gets killed or kidnapped by aliens - it's just heartwarming and lovely.

If you have never seen or heard of this movie buy it now, settle on the sofa, preferably with a warm mug of cocoa and prepared to be transported to another time and place where people CARED about one another and paranoia was at least 100 years away.

There's not a doubt in my mind that this charming story will make you remember a time when movies had pure, unadulterated heart.  Jenny Agutter shines as the oldest daughter in a role that could very easily have been overacted.  I've seen this movie numerous times since first taking my children to see it when originally released.  I'm constantly amazed at the sense of civility and decency one brings away from it.  It's a family film about family, and how important (no matter how jaded we think we are) it really is.  The lovely Johnny Douglas score is also quite wonderful.  And I bet the last scene brings a smile to your face.  Needless to say this version of ""The Railway Children"" is highly recommended.

Starring Jenny Agutter and Bernard Cribbins. Lionel Jeffries' adaption of E. Nesbits much-loved bestseller ""The Railway Children"" is a timeless and enduring affair. After their father is mysteriously taken away, three Edwardian children move to the country where the local railway becomes a source of hope and adventure. Sensitive without being sentimental, the film perfectly captures a magical moment in childhood, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest children's film of all time.

FILM FACT: Awards and Nominations: 1971 24th British Academy Film Awards: Nominated: Best Supporting Actor for Bernard Cribbins. The entire cast break the fourth wall and perform a curtain call as the credits roll. The camera moves slowly along a railway track towards a train which is decked in flags, in front of which all of the cast are assembled, waving and cheering to the camera. At the start of the credit sequence, a voice can be heard shouting ""Thank you, Mr Forbes"" as an acknowledgement to Bryan Forbes, who put up a security for the film to be completed. Meanwhile, Jenny Agutter holds up a small slate on which ""The End"" is written in chalk and says ""Goodbye"" as the credits conclude. There were special events around the shooting location and even a live production took place at Waterloo Station [London].

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: The well to-do Waterbury family is turned upside down when their father is taken from their home under mysterious circumstances. Mother [Dinah Sheridan] explains nothing except that father has had to go away, and with her children moves to a humble house in the country. The three Waterbury children occupy their time by waving to trains, which leads to a number of adventures. Young Peter [Gary Warren] learns that stealing coal is wrong, even if mother is cold. Phyllis [Sally Thomsett] is a tag-along without much imagination of her own, but the oldest daughter Bobbie [Jenny Agutter] learns more about the disappearance of her father, and handles every problem as if it might help get him back.

The popular novel ""The Railway Children"" is one of those stories about plucky kids in Edwardian England, the kind of tale one expects to see handled in a more frivolous manner. If done by Disney, it would be a musical with adults who act like children and children who act like idiots. The leads would be big star personalities that would warp the original story all out of proportion.

Actor Lionel Jeffries was a familiar second-string buffoon in Peter Sellers films before he became better known in larger roles in First Men In the Moon' and `Camelot.' The Railway Children' was Lionel Jeffries' first film as a director, and his good taste in hewing closely to the modest lines of the book is matched only by his direction of actors. The performances here are all good, in a way that shows a delicate director's control. Every character is a surprise. Dinah Sheridan is the virtuous mother who tries to keep the tragedy from her children, and only becomes upset when she thinks they're out begging for charity. Bernard Cribbins is the proud railway porter with a house-full of kids, but he's never mindful for being a quaint character actor, or to make easy statements about class. William Mervyn is the rail tycoon who takes an interest in the kids; Jeffries handles this part of the story so well, we never resent the fact that our kid heroes have a millionaire on their side.

Nobody reaches for tears or easy emotional effects, so the story never becomes mawkish. Mum is caught crying once by herself, and is left to her privacy. Potential emotional scenes are subverted, as when the Russian refugee's family is found. We cut to a long shot of his happy exit by train, and the feeling of goodwill is sublimated back into the story, instead of being squandered in a tearful release.

At the centre of `The Railway Children' is Jenny Agutter, who is a marvel to watch and the real star of the show, even with 5th place billing. The quiet intelligence and positive attitude on her sensitive face make her the perfect heroine. She wears no makeup to suppress her beauty, and seems all the more beautiful for it. Most of the adventures are really hers, as her younger siblings are only helpers and cheerleaders. The enforced move to the cold countryside is a catalyst that forces her to think and act as an adult.

Jenny Agutter is marvellous, whether flagging down a train headed for trouble or carefully mending misunderstandings with the neighbours. Her interactions with the rich gentleman on the train bring back the nostalgic notion that perhaps there once was a time when people communicated with such direct sincerity. The Railway Children has no outrageously exaggerated story points, and the kids remain kids and not superheroes. But in the bright and hopeful 1905 world presented by Lionel Jeffries, all things seem possible. The scene I remembered all these years is a simple birthday party for Bobbie, the only time Jeffries uses camera tricks to get an effect. Bobbie opens the door to find her family and friends greeting her with a cake and gifts, and a flush of barely contained delight comes across her face. She glides from one guest to another, speechless and grateful, and the camera helps express her boundless happiness. It's one of the most beautiful scenes of its kind, ever.

The underplaying of the obvious also gives power to a late episode where the Waterburys nurse a prep school boy with a broken leg. No special attention is given to romantic sparks between him and Bobbie, but the beginnings are there in their farewell. That, and in the gleam in Bobbie's eye at the end of the hilariously feeble puppet show they put on for their guest. Helping enormously are Arthur Ibbetson's camera and Johnny Douglas' musical score. Both are pretty but never precious. Douglas' tunes only become predictable when they try to hype the light comedy moments - his adventure and dramatic themes are terrific. The whole movie has the slightly rosy feel of old events softened and sweetened by memory. It's even better than I remembered it, something that doesn't often happen when rediscovering old pictures.

Still considered a national treasure in England, but virtually unknown here, `The Railway Children' is on the British Film Institute's list of 100 Best British films. The warmth and good will Jeffries creates is so strong, he can afford to have a Valentine-like last shot, with his cast breaking character to say farewell to the film audience. As family films go, The Railway Children is just about as good as you get. The casting is pitch perfect from the three children, Jenny Agutter, Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren, to Bernard Cribbins as Mr Perks and the kindly, well-educated mother, Dinah Sheridan. The child actors are utterly convincing in their roles and the quality of their acting is, for me, epitomised by Jenny Agutter who was two years younger than Sally Thomsett (who played her younger sister) and is really the focus of the film is the story is a coming-of-age tale for Bobbie. This is one of those films that works for viewers of all ages and the ending is one of those that, like `It's a Wonderful Life,' really brings a lump to the throat.

As I hadn't seen this film for well over two decades, I suspected that it would have lost its effect over the years and I wouldn't appreciate it as I did as a child. I was glad to find that it was probably more effective now as I'm now in a position to see the quality of the filmmaking, writing and acting. The period setting, in the early Edwardian era, is important is it means `The Railway Children' doesn't age or become in anyway dated. The Waterburys, especially Bobbie and the Mother, are incredibly posh and Jenny Agutter can probably outdo most members of the Royal Family for correct enunciation!

Blu-ray Video Quality  As to mark the 40th anniversary of the films release, not only was the film digitally restored. The picture is absolutely stunning and shows what can be done when time and effort is put into restoring a film to its former glory. Detail level is high and the contrast and tone are exceptional. The colours are vibrant and showcase the beautiful scenery of the Yorkshire Dales from the bright blue sky to the rolling fields where almost every buttercup can be picked out. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  It's not only the picture that has been restored, but the sound has undergone restoration treatment and is presented here in a beautifully clear 2.0 LPCM Stereo soundtrack. The dialogue and small ambient sounds are crisp, with the trains giving a reassuringly loud noise as they steam past, whistle and break.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Now and Then: A Retrospective Documentary on The Railway Children [20:00] The first extra feature is a retrospective comprising interviews with many of the locals who were involved as extras such as Ann Cryer MP and they all talk about the locations, what it was like having a feature film come to their small town and how they reacted when they saw themselves on screen. You don't often hear about the people who live in and around an area where a film was made so this gives a nice insight into how the film was made, the locations used and what the locals thought, and still think, about the film.

Special Feature: Interview with Acclaimed Children's Author Jacqueline Wilson: Jacqueline Wilson gives her perspective on the book and the film as a children's writer.

Special Feature: Interview with Jenny Agutter: Jenny Agutter talk about how they became involved, what it was like working with the other cast members and what they got up to when they weren't filming?

Special Feature: Interview with Bernard Cribbins: Bernard Cribbins also talks about how they became involved in this classic children's magical film. It's quite amusing to hear Bernard Cribbins talking about his night-time fishing.

Special Feature: Interview with Sally Thomsett: Sally Thomsett also gives an informative interview on all aspect of her involvement with the film. There is also a very funny anecdote that Sally Thomsett informs us about Jenny Agutter and that Sally Thomsett was caught out by Lionel Jeffries when they snuck out for a night on the town!

Finally, `The Railway Children` is one of the finest family films ever made in Britain and sits alongside films like Mary Poppins as examples of what you can do with a great cast, great subject material and grey settings. It really doesn't matter how old you are, The Railway Children is a film to be loved and cherished and this Blu-ray is the perfect way to do this. It is a splendid new release and, although there is no commentary track, it is a wonderful release for all the family. Very Highly Recommended!

1339023,5,B00004CJTU,"Based on the novel by E. Nesbit, The Railway Children takes us on a journey back in time to 1905 Edwardian England.

 From the moment the story began I fell in love with the setting and faithful artifacts in the rooms of the family's city house and later in their country cottage.

 The 3 siblings face challenges and struggles children in each generation go through in the process of growing up. Learning begins at home, it is said, and in practicality this was the case for these 2 sisters and brother homeschooled children.

 In each situation the children faced, they ended up going up the higher road - even when it meant extra work for themselves.

 This great DVD is a teaching in itself on how to overcome obstacles in growing up and life in general - a role model for kids of all abilities to strive to do their best and be their best!

 I've watched this story several times and can't recommend it enough for all the family! Finding good family entertainment is sometimes a challenge and this story is so much more than just a film to take up a rainy afternoon. I learn more about the time and culture every time I watch it.

 And, I appreciate that I live in a modern age where the conveniences we take for granted now were not always available to the average worker - like indoor commodes, for instance, or a separate bedroom for the kids from the parents.",1408665600,,1368,4.428
1339024,5,B00004CJTU,"This was a film I remember having an effect on me as a 12 year old growing up in a village that had a train station just the same, the station master was a cross between Bernard Cribbins and the one in Mrs Miniver played by Henry Travers.  There is one line in the film that can get to me even now, some 40+ years later, when Jenny Agutter says ""Daddy, my Daddy""!

It is charming and gentle, it can be watched on a summer's evening or on Christmas Eve. It will not shock you or leave you feeling nervous! you can watch it with your children, your grandchildren or just as I did on my own!",1400198400,,588,4.017094017094017
1339025,5,B00004CJTU,"We first saw this film decades ago when it had only recently been made, and fell in love with the story and all the characters, especially the children.  Recently saw it available for online purchase and decided to buy it.  After all these years, it still has all the charm and warmth, and has only gotten better with the passage of time.  Certainly much better viewing than much of what is shown today.

You do need a DVD player that is capable of playing Region 2 DVDs (to the best of my knowledge, the 1970 film was never released on Region 1 DVDs), and Region 2 DVD players cannot be bought at most retailers here in the US.  But we have one that we bought online (through Amazon, as a matter of fact), so it was no problem running the DVD.  And the player was reasonably priced, too.

Coming back to the film, great story line, very well filmed and edited, great cast of characters, wonderful background music.  In other words, a typically well-polished British film production.  And very reasonably priced, shipped promptly from the UK and arrived here in the Midwest within a week.  It doesn't get much better than that!",1394236800,3,1127,4.534653465346534

Amost too good to be true, everyone is always immaculately attired and has perfect manners, and interiors are spotless - unbelievable, isn't it? A simple story of perfect children, with a perfect mother and a slightly less than perfect father who goes to jail - uprooted from their perfect London town house with its' maids and opulent interiors - to end up in a small Yorkshire village in a simple country cottage (although having seen Panorama on TV the previous evening, about people losing their homes in London - most of us would nowadays give their eye teeth to live in aforementioned country cottage - with or without electricity and running water), the story revolves around the little station and the comings and goings of the trains and the part they play in the childrens' lives.

This was one of my favorites as a child and as I watched, it made me wonder how we've come so far from the values and convictions taught in this film. I won't repeat the description or give anything away. Most of the movie takes place in Yorkshire, so you'll enjoy scenes of rural countryside. This is a movie about adapting to circumstances, caring for others, conviction, generosity and honesty. Wholesome entertainment with characters that display good values. This is certainly one for the family.",1353801600,,684,4.708333333333333

1339035,5,B00004CJTU,"Agree with all the previous reviewers -- this IS a Great Film.  Being a Jenny Agutter fan since Walkabout, I must say that she is a truly wonderful person to watch on the screen.  The PBS remake might not come up to the standards of the first film, but it was a masterpiece of casting to allow Jenny to play the mother this time.  I only wish that the original film would be remastered and released as a two disc anniversary set in region one format, so that the rest of the world might enjoy it.

1339037,5,B00004CJTU,"Sometimes you just need to escape for awhile to a simpler time & place, where suffering & virtue are rewarded, and injustice is always set right. I can't think of a better way than to watch this lovely evocation of Victorian family, love & perseverance. It does something rare by capturing all the warmth & sentimentality of such a story without ever succumbing to the maudlin or sticky-sweet. Even though we know the story must end happily, with the world of the struggling family fully restored, it still maintains a distinct dramatic tension throughout.

Of course the young Jenny Agutter is a marvel! It's no wonder she managed the transition from child to adult actress so well -- she brings a rich, subtle palette of emotion to the role of Bobbie, saying so much more than words could with the slightest change of expression. Yet she can also give us displays of unalloyed sorrow & joy that burst to overflowing with feeling, and make them absolutely convincing & honest.

The look of the film is beautiful, with a particular glow & depth of color that so many English films from that period display. And Lionel Jeffries' direction is superb -- you can sense how much he loves telling this story, and that love comes through on the screen. It's a golden dream of a place too perfect to exist in real life ... but what a wonderful dream it is, while it lasts!

Now, if someone will only bring this DVD back into print again ...",1272499200,,1432,4.5859375

1339039,5,B00004CJTU,"What is enjoyable about watching random movies at random times is that one never quite knows what to expect or where the next great piece of cinema will emerge.  Recently, my viewing has taken the form of stapled classics like ""Raging Bull"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but this time my VCR took me away from modern conveniences and plopped me right down in front of Lionel Jeffries' ""The Railway Children"".  This is a skillfully directed film about three youthful children, a mysterious event with their father, relocation to the open fields of England, and eventually the rewards inherited by merely waving at trains.  At first glance this seemingly simple children's film doesn't seem all that hopeful as it has been lost on VHS rarity for some time, but within the first fifteen minutes of this film, one realizes that it is more than just your common place children's movie - ""Railway Children"" was created during a time when purity was more than just saying ""no"", when family meant everything, and where adventure was ready for you around every railroad track bend.  This is more than an adorable film, it has amazing cinematic techniques used, it keeps the regular viewer glued to the screen with unanswered questions, and gives three perfect companions to follow along this 110-minute voyage.  ""Railway Children"" is a lost treasure that needs to be seen by families and film aficionados alike.

There are several moments that stand out proudly in ""Railway Children"" that transform this from mediocrity to excellence - one happens to be our three children; Bobby, Phyllis, and Peter.  Modern cinema assures us that these three children cannot provide ample darkness, laughter, and insight into the world surrounding them, but Jeffries' children prove otherwise.  From intelligently spoken lines (both from acting and the script), to sincere kindness and dedication to this small village, all the way to the final meeting at that train stop; these children are more than just child stars advancing a story, they are leading us with emotion, persuasion, and a realism unseen by today's children.  There is more imagination packed in this small VHS than I have witnessed in film for years.  A favorite scene that could have been handled with generality, of which I have seen in other films, was the birthday scene for Bobby.  The way that Jeffries floats her between guests and gifts was exciting and refreshing, keeping our eyes excited about each scene, as well as our mind.  Another scene that captured my attention was when the children were working on gifts for Perks, when asking one man for a gift, Jeffries has him merely state, ""No, I will not.  I don't like Perks."" The children's reaction is hilarious - providing moments for both children and adults to enjoy throughout.  Filmed in the 1970s, this tiny feature provides genuine laughs than most modern comedies.  It is a creative film coupled with great choreography and direction.

That is to say, as much as I loved this film, it wasn't perfect.  Jeffries does a great job of keeping us guessing as to what happened to father, but it did feel like the event occurred, the children were kept in the dark, and it suddenly resolved itself by the end.  More detail to father, not much more, would have solidified his character and given us the opportunity to see more of the children's reaction.  Also, there is one scene in this film, one of those grandiose wide-screen shots of the English countryside that is just breath-taking, but when looking a bit closer you happen to see cars in the background.  It made me chuckle, but didn't distract too much from the overall picture.  Cinema like this is sorely missed today, and oddly, it seems that only the British have the gumption to produce it.  Films like ""Love, Actually"" or ""Vicar of Dibley"" demonstrates the power and excitement for community towns, places where everyone knows everyone and we aren't afraid to be neighborly.  This is more of a theme that American audiences could have more of - more understanding of what is happening outside, instead of remaining secluded to your own events.

Overall, I loved ""Railway Children"".  I didn't know what to expect when I first put it in the VHS player, but from the opening scene, to the exploding train set, to Perks birthday, Jeffries proved that he could handle the most child-friendly story with ease.  His ability to make the child actors feel like real characters, to involve the adults less, and to involve the children like they were adults was outstanding.  This is a film to be viewed as a strong alternative to anything Disney releases.  The continually occurring themes of friendship, kindness to strangers, and forgiveness blasts through the TV with grace and power.  ""Railway Children"" is more than just a kid's film; it is a feature that should be a staple to modern audience viewing.  Not only does it give a great visual to the English countryside, but it also teaches (and shows) how life would be greater with an emphasis on imagination and courage, instead of fighting any CGI bad guys.

The footage of the trains is first class.  It is interesting more than ever now, having seen various locations where the movie was filmed.  Jenny Agutter really shines in the movie...hard to believe than in real life she is younger than her 'on film' sister!",1514851200,,396,4.614285714285714
