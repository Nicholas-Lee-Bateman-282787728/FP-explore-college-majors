8118130,5,B000F6ZCJ8,"This movie was made in 1992 so its a bit dated. However, it gives a good look at airborne school that was still accurate when I went in 1999 and then it transitions to more of the history of the early Airborne Corps. I enjoyed this film very much.",1469750400,,247,4.061224489795919
