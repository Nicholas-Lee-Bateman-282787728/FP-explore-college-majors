The movie is slow going compared to the 2008 video.  It takes awhile to actually get to the race.  It gives a good idea of what Erzberg is about, but we just want to see the race.",1402358400,,335,3.8823529411764706
8234740,5,B000Z3DRKC,"An excellent mix of interview and event footage. While I might long for a complete end to end documentary of nothing but race footage, that would be something that would only appeal to a small number of moto enthusiasts, whereas this was even enjoyed by my wife. It's an incredibly difficult race, and one leaves it appreciating the incredible preparation and skill set needed to be considered a finisher. You will enjoy this.",1385078400,,426,4.8493150684931505
