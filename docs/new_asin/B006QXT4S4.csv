5014481,5,B006QXT4S4,"This documentary is a must see for any music lover that enjoys hearing about the history of how a band gets started and how music is created. Musicians have many different influences and it's interesting to learn about how a band like Fishbone (who is so unique) was formed, and why they did what they did, and continue to do so. In an age where real, true art is lacking and pseudo musicians are thriving, it's refreshing to see people who take their craft seriously, through all the adversity and difficulties musicians face in the music business. You have musicians, and then you have designers of music. The members of Fishbone are designers. Although they do not have millions of dollars from record sales, or a billion fans, they have the respect of their peers, and that is nothing short of honorable.",1330646400,8,808,4.697183098591549
5014482,5,B006QXT4S4,"If you were ever in a Fishbone pit or just taped your foot to ""Party at Ground Zero"" you must watch this movie. The power of Fishbone changed a generation and made many of Gen-X what we are today. Want to get the angst and understand why 40 something is still mad at the world. Take a look at this. Yea, I said it. The story of Fishbone is the the story of Gen-X and why we still don't want to belong and why we don't like you. Take your ColdPlay, take your American Idol and shove 'em.... Fishbone is still Red HOT. BTW - Do everything you can to get this band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and support the best music the time forgot.",1330560000,3,641,3.9767441860465116
5014483,5,B006QXT4S4,"Simply put this is a really great documentary about an extremely important band of the 80's, 90's and 00's and beyond. I admit I am a big fan, but would think this is a great film for everyone interested in music. Having been a longtime fan but never fully understanding the changed in lineup, this was great to see.

A basic very well done rock-documentary, with a twist, its about an amazing group of musicians who had a very interesting history and never got the break they deserve. Even though they paved the way for countless others who made more money, they never got their big break and lumbered in underground stardom.

The movie documents the rough times of the band and tries to focus on the tremendous contribution to changing the music industry and rock n roll itself.

Highly recommended for any fan!",1330560000,3,813,4.631944444444445
5014484,5,B006QXT4S4,"Thoroughly enjoyed the documentary.  I've been a Fishbone fan since 1992, seen several of their California shows.  I can remember where I was mentally & emotionally at each of those shows, and wherever that was, Fishbone brought me to the present where nothing else mattered but the night.  Ever changing yet never straying from the core of who they are.  Thank you for sharing your lives on film and allowing us to get to know you, just a little more.
This film is suitable for both fans and strangers of the band.  True entertainment.
Thanks for the fix!",1330300800,2,556,4.63265306122449
5014485,5,B006QXT4S4,"This was a really great film and does and excellent job at telling the story of the formation of this seminal L.A. band through early years and up to the point of the split of the original lineup. The movie tells the story of the musical path they have blazed and the trials and tribulations of staying true to their vision without compromise.

The only thing I wish it would have covered is everything that they've done since then as they've soldiered on through a few lineup and record label changes, and still continue on to today.

But I see why they had to stop where they did as the movie covers the subject in such great detail that it would have made a 3+ hour flick. Great film making and highly entertaining whether you're a fan of the band or not. This film just might make you one.",1327104000,15,793,4.315436241610739
5014486,5,B006QXT4S4,"According to RottenTomatoes.com, this is simply the best movie of 2011.  Directors Anderson and Metzler manage the tour de force of making a documentary focussing on an obscure yet incredibly influential Los Angeles rockband, Fishbone (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crazy-Glue-Fishbone-s-latest-record/dp/B005JIPUJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crazy Glue, Fishbone's latest record</a>) and at the same time amking it relevant for all audiences.  The movie addresses the racial history of Los Angeles, brotherhood and its limits, creative processes,... while staying true to the uniqueness of the band.

5014488,5,B006QXT4S4,"First off - like most everyone here, I love Fishbone (natch, their earlier stuff resonates the most) and thoroughly enjoyed this documentary.

Clearly, the story here is of a transformation. The early, formative years are ripe with fun, a sense of adventure and no stated goals beyond hanging out as friends, jamming in the bedroom and making music for the sheer joy of creation. Getting a live gig = nirvana. The cartoons are inventive, adding an oft-funny (and realistic) dimension to the ""how it was back then"" tales.

The years 1985 - 1992 are their artistic peak during which the band (and their fans) felt they were on the cusp of a major breakthrough, despite the often weird amalgamation of musical styles.

From then on however, it's a sad, downward trajectory that exudes quite a bit of pathos. Due to the limitations of a still-rigid industry (which was unable to pigeonhole them...how could they?), the loss of key members Kendall & Chris, and their inability to break through at a mass-market level...the band watches as other (whiter) acts such as the RHCP, No Doubt and various grunge bands go onto mega-stardom while they're left playing small clubs, wondering what happened.

The band allows itself to be filmed in brutal honesty. Particularly hard-to-watch is frontman Angelo having to move in with his mother due to loss of his apartment, although he certainly seems to take it in stride...we feel worse than he does. Norwood & Kibby are also forthcoming in their assessments of Angelo and how artistic genius can be a very trying thing to live with, day-in-day-out.

Hope prevails of course...the band eventually reunites with estranged members and continue to tour new records, refusing to join the greatest-hits-oldies circuit, where at least a guaranteed paycheck would await.

This is a frank and riveting documentary...highly recommended.",1445817600,3,1863,5.091803278688524
5014489,5,B006QXT4S4,I love Fishbone. This story was told in an intimate and yet very cool way. It is unlike any other movie I have seen about a band.,1445472000,,129,3.814814814814815

5014491,4,B006QXT4S4,I've been a Fishbone Soldier since being a kid growing up in LA in the 80's and saw some of the defining shows of their career. I felt this documentary was very well thought out and put together. I do plan on buying the dvd soon as well.,1431820800,,237,3.9583333333333335

5014502,4,B006QXT4S4,"Well done documentary.  Very interesting to see how the band took form and the broad influence they had on many acts.  It covers much live footage, especially from the early days, where they performed like no other (I was fortunate to see them play twice). The only thing that would have made this better is if there was a 'documentary set' that included an uninterrupted live concert to hear all their songs in that form.",1406678400,2,422,4.613333333333333
5014503,5,B006QXT4S4,"You don't have to be a Fishbone fan to appreciate this documentary, you just have to love music and people and magic and life. The story of these beautiful, brilliant, clever and funny boys finding each other and going on to create such incredible, groundbreaking and enduring music is wonderful and heart-warming. It gives you faith. The way this film shows the joys and strains of friendships and personalities as they grow and change within a long-running band is just brilliant. On top of that you feel the artistic struggles of integrity versus compromise, and the cruel industry that so often packages for the masses at the expense of creative genius. Weve never seen a better music documentary. You come away loving the people and caring about them really deeply. And you hear their music and have to buy the albums. Brilliant!",1403913600,,834,4.880281690140845

5014505,5,B006QXT4S4,Very interesting to get the history of this great band. It was a bumpy ride to the top and back down again. Hopefully Fishbone will reunite with all the original members and put out a new album.,1395273600,,194,4.27027027027027

5014510,5,B006QXT4S4,"Learning so much of the inner workings of such a phenomenally talented group was a fascinating experience. Having seen this band play probably 30 times over the last 17 years, it was a true eye opener. Hope they always know their fans are with them to the end, which I for one hope does not come during my lifetime. Five stars all the way.",1376265600,,339,4.3125
5014511,5,B006QXT4S4,The band Fishbone is a musical treasure and being able to see what their life on the road is like and has been since the beginning of the band is wonderful. It's a shame they are not given the same acknowledgement from the music industry as other bands that copied their style but they will always have a strong fan base because they are worth it. Fishbone is and will always be REDHOT!!!,1373414400,2,388,4.328767123287672
5014512,5,B006QXT4S4,A fantastic documentary by some great fellas about some creative and talented guys in the rockin-est band ever. If you don't know who to fishbone is do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It's not your typical happy ever after but it's an honest look at one of the greatest bands of all time.,1372550400,,295,4.381818181818182
5014513,5,B006QXT4S4,"I saw Fishbone live for the first time when they opened for REM at a free show in Athens.  I had their EP by that time and I couldn't have been happier to see them live.  I've since seen them two other times and I can tell you that they're unparalleled in any genre.  Truly the greatest live band I've ever seen, and I've seen them all.  I hope they can get on track and finally get the wide exposure they so richly deserve.  This doc is the first step toward achieving that.  Check it out and learn how the record and radio people like keeping your ears in a box!",1362960000,,564,4.036036036036036
5014514,5,B006QXT4S4,"I heard about the documentary via Twitter, and got lucky to have control of the remote one night last week (a break from my cousin's addiction to reality tv.) I ended up watching it with them, and was inspired, touched, and shocked by what this band has gone through. For them to come full circle and be where they are now, is a true testament to the power of music and love.

I enjoyed the historical context of LA's culture and music throughout, as well as the different perspectives of family, friends, musicians, record execs and the band members themselves. It was engaging, had depth and of course INCREDIBLE MUSIC. This documentary should be watched by everyone that appreciates bands and music in general; clearly, I loved it!",1361664000,,734,4.734375
5014515,5,B006QXT4S4,"Not sure how non-fans feel but as a lifetime fan, this movie was a treat. It was also sad in some ways, but I'm just happy I got to see the original lineup 25 times before they broke up. It's great that Angelo, Walt and Norwood continue on but the feeling is just not the same. I think the last part of the film captures that, a bit too much actually. Love the live footage dvd extras. Thanks for everyone involved for making a documentary about the best band that ever lived.",1360108800,,476,4.184782608695652
5014516,5,B006QXT4S4,"Do Yourself a favor and Buy, Rent, Stream, Steal this movie. Prob the most underrated band to come out in the last 30 years. Inovators to the Umph degree.. And if they come to Your town, don't miss them, they are truly one of the most exciting live act's on the road. Where ever they play Stadiums, arena's or a club they will make you feel like you are at a party where evryone has a great time and feels welcome.",1359590400,2,414,4.1234567901234565
5014517,5,B006QXT4S4,"If you laughed and cried during The Story of Anvil, then you will definitely appreciate Everyday Sunshine.  The story shows the promising rise of one of the greatest music acts that didn't quite materialize in the mainstream like the Chili Peppers and Jane's Addiction, even though Fishbone is every bit as great as both.  Everyone used to call James Brown the hardest working man in show business...well then Fishbone is the hardest working, most bada$$, funky, rockin', jamming band in all of any type of business!  I have seen Fishbone on many occasions and I am always leaving the show feeling like I have just been through a workout.  The story of Fishbone is an in depth look at the beginnings of what should have been the Greatest Band In Rock N' Roll, in my humble opinion they are the greatest band I have ever had the pleasure and honor to witness live.  Two of the best live shows I have ever seen are Fishbone and Primus in 1991 and King's X and Fishbone in ca 2003.  Through the good times, bad times, and all the adversity that comes with bands breaking up, Fishbone (Angelo and Norwood) have continued to put together a solid group of musicians that bring the FUNK every time they play!  The documentary leaves the fans hoping for a possible reunion of the original members (not sure about Fish), but, until that time when the universe aligns along the axis of Fishbone; Rocky, Dre, John, and Jay (and Welcom Back Dirty Walt, we missed you) are each seminal musicians themselves who add to the eclectic entity known as Fishbone and provide one of (if not the) greatest rock shows here on the face of the earth.  I only hope that anyone and everyone who has ever listened to Fishbone, rediscovers this great band through this documentary.  I am tired of people looking at my t shirt or sweatshirt and say ""Isn't that a Fishbone shirt, I haven't listened to them since college.""  I just want to say, ""Take your head out of your a$$, and go listen to Fishbone again, they are still alive and kicking and putting out the best music in the industry!""  They are too good of band to not be playing headline arena shows.  America and the world needs to stand up and fight back against the fake, pop-crap, anti-music that has taken over the airwaves, real musicians and real meaning is what music is all about.  Fishbone is all about REAL MUSIC.  KEEP SKANKIN' TO THE BEAT!",1359590400,4,2379,4.553990610328638
5014518,5,B006QXT4S4,Here's the thing about this band that really comes through.... They got crazy amounts of heart. They put it all out there. They aren't afraid to show you their weaknesses alongside their genius.  This band deserves to be labeled with the top bands of our time and they deserved to be paid!  Greatest live show ever!

5014523,5,B006QXT4S4,I must start by stating Fishbone is my favorite band of all time.  This documentary is not just interesting for hardcore fans like me.  It gives such a great look at the rise and fall of this band that was poised to be one of the biggest bands around.  So many musicians get so close to being super stars and Fishbone was knocking on the door.  Anyone who is a fan of music will love this documentary for the realism the interviews and the history.

5014528,5,B006QXT4S4,As a person who grew up in the 90's music was extremely important to me. I always loved Fishbone from the very first time I heard them. This film really shows how wonderful and talented these guys are! And how many big name groups like No Doubt and others count Fishbone as one of their biggest influences! I never understood why these guys never got more recognition. I found this movie to be very exciting and insightful.

The personal interviews of the band members reveal a genuine story and really show you what it's been like for each of them to be a professional musician ... the good, the bad and the ugly sides of it too.

5014536,5,B006QXT4S4,"I've been a big fan of Fishbone since I was back in middle school, about the same time when Reality Of My Surroundings first came out.  I was quite pleased to see a documentary come out, and even more pleased at just how good it is!  I mean, being a fan I was sure to enjoy it regardless, but the documentary is exceptionally well done and may even appeal to those unfamiliar with the band.  But I'm sure it will mostly be fans that see this film.  But that's no surprise-that's Fishbone's career!
The film follows the band from it's genesis in the ghettos of L.A., to their discovery, record label signing, their near-misses with fame, breakdown of their guitar player, and eventual breakup.  Though there is quite a bit of footage of the present lineup of the band(which includes only two original members now), the storyline of the film pretty much ends with the breakup of the original band members.
As I had said before, the film is very well done and far, far beyond any kind of VH1 music documentary.  I'd highly suggest it to people who aren't familiar with the band as is provides insight not only into one of the most influential, talented and misunderstood bands of the last 30 years, but it also gives you a good look at how clueless the music industry is(but that's something many Fishbone fans are quite well aware of).  Record companies have no clue what to do with a black band unless they fall squarely and nicely into their ""black music"" package.  Granted, Fishbone would have had a hard time trying to find a niche had they been white, considering how all over the board, outrageous and unclassifiable their sound is.  But considering they are black, it's all the more confusing(""Too white for the blacks and too black for the whites"" as George Clinton states here).  So as a result, Fishbone are a band that appeals to the select crowd that dig unconventional and underground music.  They also appeal greatly to other musicians and have inspired countless bands, many who have managed to get a taste of fame, and many very inferior to Fishbone.
I guess my only gripe about this film comes in the later half.  It's never actually stated by anyone, but there seems to be this vibe that the band more or less died after some of the original members left, and that present day Fishbone is kinda desperately trying to reclaim their greatness.  Nothing is really said about the current lineup, but they really are just pushed to the wayside.  This bugs me and I think it's quite unfair coz while the original band was nothing short of magical, I think the current lineup is stellar and deserves WAAAY more credit.  Fishbone stumbled a bit with the Chim Chim and Nuttwerx albums, but Still Stuck In Your Throat is nothing short of awesome.  I just wish a bit more respect and recognition were given to the musicians playing with Fishbone now, as they are very, very good.
Other than that, this is a great viewing experience.  It's funny, educational, pisses you off at times, makes you happy at other times, and is just all around a very enjoyable documentary.

It is great to know the true origins of a band of such longevity, the incredible journey that continues to this day. HELLO rock n roll hall of fame..",1345593600,,267,4.254901960784314
5014538,5,B006QXT4S4,"I am not a huge Fishbone fan. Was first told about these guys back in the 90's by a fellow musician.  I admired their energy and courage to be different, but never really got off into them. For some reason, I heard about this film in LA in 2011 and was curious to hear and see the story. Cant really tell you why. Was just drawn to it. I think it was the promo I saw where well know bands like No Doubt and Chilli Peppers were talking about them. Something compelling in their stories.

Man!!!!!!!!! am I glad I went to see this film. One of the most tragic, but eye-opening stories about the music industry I have ever seen (and I have seen some band docs). Follows their life from eaarly beginnings in LA, to failed efforts in the mainstream, videos, inside band fights, lawsuits, just an incredible...but very candid film.

Was fortunate enough to see this in Hollywood with Angeleo (lead singer) and Norwood (bassist) there in the theater for Q&A. Angelo is mad cool. Out of his mind, but brilliantly.

I will watch this many more times,have already seen it 3 times now. I listen to ""Everyday Sunshine"" the song when I need a pick me up now. Feels good. PEEP IT, you will never forget it.",1345075200,2,1192,4.380090497737557

Visually a very cool documentary - cool graphics, Laurence Fishburne narrates. I came away from this thinking how dedicated these artist are. To stick with it so long without the financial reward.

5014541,5,B006QXT4S4,"Solid, powerful and thorough documentary on one of the most influential but not-as-successful-as-they-should-have-been bands of all time. Entertaining and plenty face-paced for a documentary, Everyday Sunshine does a great job of walking through the creation and evolution of a band probably too innovative for their times.  Very few bands ""own"" or ""define"" anything new or truly original about music anymore, but Fishbone did and does, and the film - rather than slavishly gush over the band - walks fairly and objectively through their failure to achieve commercial success in addition to all their great things. I've followed Fishbone for well over 25 years, seeing them in small clubs w only 50 or 100 other people in the mid-80's, and watched as bands who OPENED for them like the Red Hot Chili Peppers went on to super-stardom while Fishbone was left behind. This film walks through all of that - the ups and downs. It's a must see to get a sense of how the music industry works, how the greats don't always come out on top, and how these brilliant musicians have persevered regardless for three decades. A must see.",1344816000,,1122,4.905263157894737

5014543,5,B006QXT4S4,"After seeing the trailer for the ""Everyday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone"" movie, to say I was excited was a bit of an understatement.  I cannot lie, I'm a Fishbone fan, and a black rock musician.  Since I was just starting out playing music, I've connected with Fishbone on a deeper level than just music.  I've heard Norwood and Angelo speak in other great documentaries (Electric Purgatory) so to see one based soley on the band, was intriguing.

Hoping it wouldn't be another ""Anvil"" type documentary, I was pleasantly surprised.  There is some amazing live footage of the band from the early years to present for the Fishbone fans, great photos and old fliers.  Another thing the movie did that I haven't seen before was the use of animation.  Several different artists throughout the movie, helps tell the story in such an innovative way.

Another thing I appreciated was the story.  The story of a band that has become famous and not rich.  Something the average person doesn't understand.  So many times we see the packed shows, the tour bus (or motorhome) and assume everyone is financially fine.  9 times out of 10 that's not the case.  Also the relationship between founding members Norwood Fisher and Angelo Moore was something everyone can relate too.  The ups and downs of the music industry, creating a sound, unable to be classified by the industry at it's inception, then copied by their white counterparts who've went on to much financial success (Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, No Doubt) and Fishbone, now in their 50's still looking for the payoff.  It's the type of movie that leaves you talking for hours after with ""what if"" scenarios.  I can't lie, after watching ""Everyday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone"" I felt motivated to continue to create, to continue to dream, to continue to follow said dreams.

Thank you to everyone involved with this film for that.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-eacute-but-de-la-fin-la-Gen-egrave-se/dp/B008KW0WI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D&eacute;but de la fin: la Gen&egrave;se</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/She-s-Got-To-Be-A-Pirate/dp/B005FJPFT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">She's Got To Be A Pirate</a>",1344816000,,2279,5.655882352941177
5014544,5,B006QXT4S4,"I knew alot aboout Fishbone before this documentary, and it was still great, even for an expert fan such as myself.  It's well made (the animation), all the players, specifically Walt driving by his old neighborhood.  The Warfield footage, the classic 'swims', sure you can see stuff on youtube, and it's good, this however, is definitive, a complete document of a complicated concept that is, this band we call Fishbone.  Sure they suffered from being too democratic, however, their sound never suffered, there's always strong tracks on all the albums, they always sound good with repeated listens.  People need to know their story, the fear of having black men not doing one particular style in music on stage, undiluted creativity that obviously influenced pretty much all the band's you listen to.  The implosion they experienced, the beacons that are Norwood and Angelo, the incredible new line up, you know they have at least one more classic album in them, and by classic I mean, incorporating all genres on one album or even an ep, I know they had an ep that came out, I haven't heard it.  If I were to pick an album to start with, go with In Your Face, specifically the song In The Air, you want go nuts listen to Truth and Soul, you wanna know the fuss, listen to the self titled debut ep with all the tunes you know but you never knew who did it.  See the reason Mr Bungle exists, the ChiliPeppers and No Doubt...now if they could get Andre 3000 to produce at least one track where he channels Tom Jenkinson and then they do live versions with instruments of the wub wub for a half second and then have Dewaele brothers (Soulwax) produce some tracks as well and of course do a duet with Mike Patton.

It is a great piece of work that made me appreciate this band even more.

These guys are one of a kind. So much so that they were undefinable musically. Each member is an unique artistic entity and the sum of the parts makes up Fishbone.

Even if you are not a Fishbone fan, this film will be enjoyed by fans of music.

And be sure to catch Fishbone on tour in a city near you. They still bring it as hard as ever.",1344816000,,593,4.230088495575221
5014548,5,B006QXT4S4,"This is a phenomenal documentary about a truly ground-breaking band. I'm hoping this film helps Fishbone to finally get the acknowledgment they deserve for the road they paved for so many other bands. Many bands that have both aspired for greatness and many that have achieved greatness have sited Fishbone as a significant influence. This film doesn't and couldn't possibly give the whole picture in such a short amount of time. However it does a great job of mixing personal histories of individual members, the band's history and where Fishbone fits into the progression of punk, alternative, ska, etc over the past few decades. If you watch this documentary and then go see Fishbone live like I did, you'll be scratching your head trying to figure out why these guys aren't one of the - if not THE - top band to come out of the 80's - 90's alt-music scene. Fishbone is RED HOT!!!!",1344816000,,884,4.709677419354839
5014549,5,B006QXT4S4,"I saw that this doc was on Netflix and was incredibly excited as I've been a fan for decades and didn't know it existed.
I'm a native Angeleno and have been a live musician since I was 16 so the first thing you have to know about Fishbone is that they were THE live Los Angeles band you aspired to be. What this doc hopefully does for the uninitiated and/or unaware viewer is to place Fishbone in the sociological context and musical hierarchy that they rightly deserve.
Their EP was not only the perfect party record of its era but it melded so many musical genres and styles that you couldn't adequately describe Fishbone with only one or two hyphens.
I was, at various times so proud for what these often disparate fellas produced as well as maddeningly frustrated that they splintered apart before the world at large as well as they themselves got to see the zenith of their collective capabilities.
The mighty 'Bone will always be the most exciting and refreshing band many including myself have ever seen live (and I've witnessed Queen, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Guns N' Roses among many others).
Without giving any spoilers or expose too much of their unique backstory I can only say that this doc not only gives a hearty and in depth history of the band for the casual fans as well as several wonderfully heartwarming moments for their true fans. I am going to order this DVD for the extras and commentary.

I hope you not only enjoy this movie and this incredible band's output but that you also realize that a live rock-punk-ska-funk-r&b-spoken word-alternative-underground-pop-soul band experience once existed so successfully and that all live bands should be held up to their example.",1344816000,,1697,4.752542372881356
5014550,5,B006QXT4S4,"i love this band and really enjoyed this documentary about them.  Even if you are not a fan of the band there is plenty here to enjoy, it being the story of 5 friends from Los Angeles in the late 70's/early 80's who formed a band, got on the cusp of success, but for various reasons never quite got there and have been plugging along in relative obscurity ever since, with only 2 of the original 5 members staying with the band uninterrupted (a 3rd original member has since returned to the band and is currently performing with them).  many elements at play here: race and prejudice in the music industry, the internal dynamics of a working band, the personal relationship between the 2 longest serving members and the accomodations to each others' needs they both had to make.  I would compare this film to Beats, Rhymes and Life (the story of A Tribe Called Quest) and Beyond The Lighted Stage (the story of Rush)both of which it is not necessary to be a fan of the band's music in order to enjoy the film.  Funny, sad, inspirational and informative, with many testimonials from peer musicians regarding their influence and the respect they have for these guys.  do yourself a favour and watch this film.",1344816000,2,1207,4.595348837209302

EVERYDAY SUNSHINE:  THE STORY OF FISHBONE, chronicles the story of legendary L.A. band FISHBONE, from their rise from local punk/ska outfit to mainstream artists, to their ""fall"" due to court cases, band departures and internal conflict.  Narrated brilliantly by Laurence Fishburne, the documentary features glimpses into the bands historic past with video clips, live performances and rare pics of the band in its infancy and heyday.  The doc also shows where the band is now, a relentless touring band with ever-present energy and packed shows.

With interviews with most of the original lineup, EVERYDAY SUNSHINE gives you the awesome, the glory, the sadness, the anger and straight up truth about this unsung band determined to not be classified nor categorized for mainstream consumption.  Also included are many interviews from other stars that worked, played with, or simply just admired what they brought to the table (Les Claypool, Flea, Gwen Stefani, Keith Morris, etc).

Extra's include deleted scenes, more interviews with the original band, and classic live performances.

I almost teared up watching Angelo's struggles and having to move back in with his mother along with the small crowd in Spain the film opens with.

More than that, though, Everyday Sunshine is the story of the racism inherent in the record industry and how a band that didn't fit easily into a category was eventually ignored, even as thousands cheered.  It could have been millions, and therein lies the tragedy of this story.

But there is hope as well.  Fishbone is still out there, making music.  Angelo and Norwood, keep fighting.  Much respect.",1344816000,,564,4.762886597938144
5014555,5,B006QXT4S4,"Having LOVED Fishbone since I was a kid, starting/modeling my own band after them (despite not being ska/punk at all), AND having the incredible privilege of touring with them extensively in the mid-/late-'90's (including Fish's last tour with the band), this movie truly moved me on many personal levels. Beautifully shot - combining old-skool live VHS footage, photo collages, TV appearances and current HD footage of the band, the film makers have a finely crafted vehicle to tell the story of a band in crisis.

It is truly heart-wrenching to watch a band so poised for greatness and glory have such a long struggle over so many years. It is really the tale of a dysfunctional family trying to keep itself together and the dream alive through truly difficult circumstances. Like all families, they have their ups and downs, but Fishbone's story is particularly riveting because of the profound influence they have had on so many of the world's biggest bands (Red Hot Chili Peppers, No Doubt, Janes Addiction among many others who really took this documentary as an opportunity to praise Fishbone in this film). Even more compelling perhaps is the notion that it was Fishbone's intense dedication to keeping the band ""democratic"" that might have most contributed to their lack of commercial success over time. This is something that hits close to home for me and it was astounding to watch this unfold for them over the years - ironic and embittering, especially as band members (family members!) dropped away one by one.

That said, it is important to note that this is not a film about a DEAD or DYING band - quite the opposite! It's inspirational and uplifting - Fishbone's triumphs are vast and truly great! It is profound to watch Norwood and Angelo work so hard to keep the dream/vision/family of Fishbone alive despite all the adversity they've been through (and still are going through).

I saw them recently (July 8th, 2012) in Brooklyn and they were as intense, vital, musically sound and HUNGRY as ever!
I know it's not feasible to think that they could or would tour with the original line up (for myriad, complicated reasons), but all of us die-hard, old-skool fans can hope - and watch this movie again & again - long live FISHBONE!

Black radio stations did not want to play their music, and the white people loved them. Unfortunately, they did not generate the sales that they should have, so they were dropped by Columbia/Sony. The situation with Kendall Jones is heartbreaking, but, it needed to be told. The only downside to this masterpiece is why was not the Fishkeeper interviewed. Fish Fisher is one of the most underrated drummers of our time. He did some amazing things on the drumkit (Servitude from Give A Monkey A Brain, f.e.), and he made it look so easy. His brother, Norwood, underrated...hell all of the bandmembers are underrated. I wish that they could get back together, and do some serious damage to the plastic boring music scene right now.

The songwriting and musicianship demonstrated a depth of talent amongst the assembled musicians. Maybe they tried to keep it going too long. Angelo Moore is an irrepressible creative artist with a championship smile and infectious energy, and I wish he and his bandmates had achieved better financial outcomes from their music. Moore and bassist Norwood Fisher are the anchors and glue that keep the Fishbone legacy alive as other band members leave abruptly or drift away, and Fisher strikes me as the most level-headed and reasonable character in this film, which one wouldn't assume from his outrageous and wry haircut/topnot/antenna/uni-dredlock. While this film spins downward in the second half, it's worth viewing to get an insightful picture of the challenges and dynamics of the career of the rock musician.

I first caught a couple of their shows in Boston many moons ago when Reality of My Surroundings was out (Beacon Theater)
and when they hit the Paradise Lounge as an offshoot show during the Lollapalooza tour.  Was an instant fan of their unique
brand of music.

Saw then again recently in Tennessee in November of last year.  Still rocking an incredible show.
Angelo came out before the show and chatted up the fans... afterwards Rocky Dre and Angelo were out
at the bar meeting the fans..

Its cool to see another side of Fishbone when they are not on tour and Mama Fish and Angelo's mom.
Angelo and his daughter is cool to see and relate to them as family guys...

I highly recommend this movie to any Fishbone fan and to anybody who loves good music.

That was kind of like a huge disappointment because you felt like these guys should be at the Universal or Irvine Amphitheatre, at least. So I knew something was up by then. It's great to see this, though, and see that they kept going and going--at least Norwood and Angelo. I'd love to see them today.",1475452800,2,665,4.285714285714286
