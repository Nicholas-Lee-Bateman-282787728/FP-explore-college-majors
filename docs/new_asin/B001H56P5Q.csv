8307920,5,B001H56P5Q,Love all of Tinto Bress' movies.  Most of his works have great story lines.,1430611200,,75,4.357142857142857
8307921,1,B001H56P5Q,"In spite of the claim that this DVD is for 'All Regions', it does not work with U.S. DVD players. I am returning it.",1421107200,,116,3.875
8307922,5,B001H56P5Q,"What is porn and what is art? The line between them was never so thin as seen in this movie of Tinto Brass. I'm a big fan of Tinto Brass. I love all his movies. But, obviously, all his movies were not created equal.",1294704000,,215,3.909090909090909
8307923,2,B001H56P5Q,I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH MY FELLOW REVIEWERS ABOUT THIS MOVIE. THIS WAS A MOST DISSAPOINTING EXPERIENCE. THE FOG WAS NOT ADVERTISED AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE A CUT WAS MADE. I FEEL LIKE A SUCKER FOR BUYING THIS GARBAGE. IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY. I THINK THAT TINTO BRASS WOULD BE FURIOUS THAT HIS ARTWORK WAS THIS BADLY DISPOILED.,1287100800,2,324,4.416666666666667
8307924,1,B001H56P5Q,"I bought this because I am a Tinto Brass fan also.  ""The Key"" has to be a classic, there is sex, but there is a good plot also, and it keeps you interested and guessing. But what is disappointing about ""PO Box Tinto Brass"" is the Korean censorship. Flashes of fog appear where there should be female parts.  This is most annoying and interrupts what continuity there is.  I was taken in by the line: 'This is the ORIGINAL theatrical release as envisioned by Tinto Brass with the original Italian soundtrack.'  I'm pretty sure this is not the way Tinto had envisioned his film would appear.",1183852800,15,589,4.528301886792453
8307925,1,B001H56P5Q,"I bought this because I am a big Tinto Brass fan.  What the advertising above does not tell you is that although this an all-region DVD, it's in Italian with only Korean subtitles.  So unless you speak Italian or read Korean, you may want to pass on this one.",1182470400,14,259,4.26530612244898
