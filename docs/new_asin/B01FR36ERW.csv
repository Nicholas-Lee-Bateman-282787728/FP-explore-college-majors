Budget Western movies were very popular in theaters from the 1930s to the 1940s, and on television in the 1950s. Most people over sixty remember them. Younger people may also find them entertaining and educational. They had a message: those who do right win in the end. These movies defended small ranchers against the big landowners who wanted their lands. Others defended people against criminal gangs with ""collective security"". The right to keep and bear arms was well-recognized. Small movie studios were threatened by big movie studios with their cartel of theaters. Was it changing tastes or economics that caused their decline? Few people under fifty have ever seen horses used to work the land. Many were set in modern times and showed telephones, radios, and automobiles.

The newer westerns in the 1950s changed to personal conflicts from property conflicts. ""High Noon"" was an example of personal conflicts (with a hint of business conflicts). One movie noted how an increase in settlers disadvantaged cattle men since they could no longer graze their cattle on publicly owned range land after Government lands were given to homesteaders, people who would earn the land by working and developing it. Laura Ingalls Wilder's books told about homesteading on the prairie and pioneer life on the frontier. Building a railroad into Texas ended the long cattle drives to the cow towns of Kansas. Store owners did more business with 500 families living year around than from 1,000 transient cowboys.

These movies were popular before big corporations began to put small owner-operated stores and farms out of business. One way was to cut off small business owners from wholesale distributors. If banks ""red-lined"" small businesses they could not get the loans needed for running their business. There were no government loans for farmers and ranchers then. Many of these films were produced by small studios who operated on a low budget. Later they were shown on television during the 1950s to fill up their broadcast schedule (the way some older TV shows are recycled today). [Read THISTV*COM & MOVIESTVNETWORK*COM schedules.]

These western films had very little padding and there is more action than in some longer big studio productions. Some have songs and dances for entertainment. The stars are: Roy Rogers, Johnny Mack Brown, Buster Crabbe, James Newill, George O'Brien, Tex Ritter, Bob Steele and many others who are little remembered today. Some were real cowboys (Tim McCoy, Hoot Gibson) or rodeo riders (Ken Maynard). The formula of the ""Three Mesquiteers"" seems to have inspired the ""Range Busters"" and the ""Rough Riders"" (they were undercover investigators who fought gangs of criminals).
