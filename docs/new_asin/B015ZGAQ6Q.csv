8735166,1,B015ZGAQ6Q,Bootleg quality at best.  This is a recording of a streamed concert.  The streaming is done at a very low bit rate so the Video is exrtremely pixelated and the Sound is tunnel like.  Very poor quality reproduction.,1481068800,2,214,4.578947368421052
8735167,3,B015ZGAQ6Q,"First of all, BUYER BEWARE!!! This is EXACTLY the same concert footage as INDESTRUCTIBLE LIVE IN GERMANY DVD, The only difference is that Inside The Fire contains 4 additional songs from the same concert performance added on. So, by purchasing this release, you are getting more or all (?) of the complete concert from 08'. I also own the EP version Ind. Live In Germany which I bought 5 yrs. ago and found the picture quality/clarity to be better than Inside The Fire disc which seems like nothing more than poor bootleg picture quality. The audio is fine on both discs. Then again, if you are a die-hard fan and want the extra tunes,then this Inside The Fire disc is for you. I see that Amazon lists these DVDs side by side selling them as ""Frequently purchased together"" which, no doubt, is most likely nothing more than a case of pure greed on their part! 3 Stars for fluctuating picture quality!",1480377600,2,900,4.596273291925466
8735168,5,B015ZGAQ6Q,Love it!  If you are a fan of heavy metal this is a great band.,1473120000,,63,3.2
