3874884,1,B0028VCPMK,"Unmitigated trash. Terrible production values: fake-looking glued beards and limp, on-the-cheap battle scenes. The script is beyond redemption. Example: Four, (count them) four brave cossacks fall to the ground and repeat, word for word,  rigmarole about dying for the Russian soil (""russkaya zemlya"")-- and in one montage sequence to boot.  ""Battleship Potemkin"" this is not.
Soviet film studio system used to produce amazing films where the patriotic message was blended with terrific acting and masterly cinematography.  This film, while aspiring to match the masterpieces of Soviet era, falls far short of that high standard.
  Two redeeming factors:  The old, Kamenetz-Podolsk fort on the Dniestr AND the  beautiful Magdalena Mielcarz!",1250640000,26,740,5.73394495412844
3874885,5,B0028VCPMK,"Not much like the Yul Brenner film from 1962! This film seems historically far more accurate in costume and music. The friction between Russia and Poland is exploited for maximum effect. The Polish love interest for the elder of Taras' sons is shown as a shallow although beautiful woman.

As one who belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, I was happy to see the positive light in which the traditional Russian Orthodox (Pravoslavniy Khristian) faith is regarded among the Cossacks. This is a central issue in the film as it ought to be. Even today there is conflict in what is now called Ukraine, especially Western Ukraine where Uniat influence from Polish Roman Catholics is still quite strong.",1250380800,9,698,4.915254237288136
8357052,3,B0028VCPMK,"If you are searching for a historically correct film, this is not it. Yes the locations are amazing, the costumes look very authentic, and Bogdan Stupka's acting is good, if not amazing. But that's about all that is good about this film. The depiction of the Poles is one dimensional and Magdalena Mielcarz acting is very flat, although she is beautiful. The love story is strange, and only about the love scenes and the characters are so obsessive as to not make the story interesting. The depiction of Jews is at best, racist, and is a disgrace to modern movies.  The fight scenes are boring and gory and when *spoiler alert* all of the main cossack heroes die, they die pouring out their love for the great mother Russia, which is laughable. The torture scenes were excessive, the love scenes unnecessary and overall the film did not deliver. All of the film was not bad, but I would only recommend the first half, where we see more what the Cossacks were like.",1389052800,,964,4.604651162790698
8357053,5,B0028VCPMK,"This movie far surpasses the older, Yul Brynner, version (though I love that actor!).  The subtitles are not a problem, especially if you know the story.  The action is well-filmed; and the actors seem to be fitted perfectly to their roles.  As you watch this film, it seems as if the Cossacks and Poles were coming alive again.  There is no gratuitous violence (it was, after all, a very bloody age).  The score helps to make this a five star movie.  Everything about it went far past what I expected when I ordered it.  I used it in a Literature of War class (for high school seniors) to complement Gogol's novella; the students loved it and agreed that it was very true to the story.",1373500800,,686,4.44
8357054,4,B0028VCPMK,"The movie is actually not bad, even with it being stilted to promote Russian nationalism (the Cossacks' death cries are more than a bit overdone). There is much battle bloodshed and torture for people who like realistically gruesome violence. The nude scenes with Magdalena Mielcarz (an actual Pole) are quite nice. I can see how she could turn a young Cossack against his own on a dime. The single-mindedness of the Cossack men in those times is believable considering war was an inevitability with everyone coveting their neighbors land, goods, and wives. Movies are never historically perfect and this one is far from it. However, Tony Curtis and his perfect hair is not in it, which is a great improvement (although I like Tony in other stuff).",1337558400,,748,4.897637795275591
8357055,3,B0028VCPMK,"A bit torn as to what to say about this movie.

For the acting I would have rated it 4+, but the effort to bring Russia into it was mind numbing.  Let's be real.  The Ukranians hated Russia so much that even as late as WWII when the Germans invaded the Ukranians at first saw them as liberators.  The idea that these Ukranians would be willing to die for Russia and give praise to Russia with their last breath is almost as believable as making a movie about WWII in the Pacific with the US Marines portrayed as fighting for Germany and singing the praises of Hitler as they died (after all, they're fighting Japan there and not Germany).

That being said, if you know nothing of history and couldn't care less, but want to see a lot of action, good acting and some healthy doses of very obvious propaganda then you will likely enjoy this movie.
It really would have taken very little editing of the script to have made this a very good movie with regard to both the acting and action (which it already is), and the historical perspective shown in the book.  I just like to imagine them remembering home and family when they died.  Ignoring the script at points.
If you're a student of the history of Eastern Europe you'll have to keep telling yourself it's just a movie and hopefully those who watch it, but don't know the history, will be interested enough to look up what really was going on there (or perhaps read the book) and sort out the reality.",1323907200,,1453,4.399253731343284
8357056,4,B0028VCPMK,"This film is a visual feast. It's fairly faithful to the historical fiction novel of the same name that it's based on. It's a rousing, emotional, dramatic, and romanticized account of the Cossack Rebellion written and later filmed to advance the cause of Russian nationalism and religious Orthodoxy. In terms of historical time line, the events in the films marked the beginning of the Polish Deluge, which is the beginning of the decline of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and also the rise of Russia as a regional power. More cynical modern viewers may find the characters in this movie somewhat two dimensional with their thoughts and actions that border on the surrealistic, in a sense that the characters on screen behave more as physical embodiments of Cossack ideals and Russian nationalism and less as flesh and blood human beings. The pageantry of the film, however, is undeniable, featuring dazzling arrays of costumes, armor, and weaponry. The imagery of Polish Winged Hussars is used very liberally in the film, with just about every Pole on a horseback being a member of that elite unit. Historically the movie is inaccurate: the multitudes of social/economic/political under-currents in the rich regional history behind the story were brushed over in the cause of Russian nationalism, but visually it's quite stunning and entertaining.",1316736000,,1352,5.263888888888889
8357057,4,B0028VCPMK,"Don't forget, this movie was made by Russians, this folklore tale was than and now Ukrainain, Taras Bulba even though a fictionl charater was Ukraianian, there is no love loss between the two countries as the Russians have persecuted the Ukrainian people for years especially during those times. As far as the movie, it was very good.",1298332800,2,334,4.87719298245614
8357058,5,B0028VCPMK,"Please disregard low ratings for this moovie from other reviewers. They have no clue what they are talking about! I watched it many times, and every time it gets better. I would consider it to be a prequel to ""With Fire And Sword"" and relating to Cossack Uprising of late 16th century. It's historically accurate. Actor performances, scenery, dialogs, and music are really outstanding. I would rate it 5 stars!!! One of the best movies I've ever seen!",1278892800,8,451,4.794871794871795
8357059,3,B0028VCPMK,"Bogdan Stupka is a brillant actor.  I have seen him in two Polish Films (Stary Basn and With Fire and Sword). His portrayal of the fictitious Taras Bulba is up to full measure.  The action sequences were great, although the portrayal of the nasty Poles (my ancesters, I suspect) was a mite too caricature.  That said the film uses the history of the Ukraine as a backdrop for Russian nationalism.  The Cossack rebellion against the Polish Throne and their greedy Polish, Lithuanian, and polonised Ruthenian rulers had nothing to do with Russia.  Russia at that time had a peace treaty with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.  It is a shame that films like this, while well made, distort the rich histories of Central and East European nations, about which English speaking peoples know next to nothing.

8357060,5,B0028VCPMK,"This is a magnificent film.  True to Nicoli Gogol's novel; unless one hasn't had the good fortune to read the novel, it will seem confusing in a few parts, but you can get caught up pretty fast.  It's good to know that in these modern times when you need a hundred men for a mass battle, instead of a handful of actors CGI'd into many, it's great to see REAL actors in mass battle scenes.
The dialog (subtitles) may seem contrived at times, but it doesn't make the film less enjoyable.  Interestingly enough, the Russian actors speak Russian and the Polish actors speak Polish with a Russian voice over and the subtitles.  Never seen this before and it works!

This not the romaticisized version of Hollywood (which is a marvelous film in its own right) and fairly graphic in the bloodshed.  The scene of Ostap's death is right out of the book and the actors death scene (I thought) was better than Mel Gibson's final goodbye in ""Braveheart"".

This is very good film, well worth the time to watch and enjoy.",1264636800,10,1007,4.530386740331492
8357061,1,B0028VCPMK,"Flood the living room with Red Army Chorus songs and hook yourself up to a slow IV-drip of 100 proof Blue Label Stolichnaya before viewing this uraaaaah-Russian-chauvinistic version of ""Taras Bulba"" directed by loyal Communist Vladimir Bortko.

Hemingway called ""Taras Bulba"" one of the ten best books of all time. Sadly, this film
hijacks a great adventure story and uses it as a vehicle to push aggressive Russian propaganda. Nicolai Gogol intended his ""Taras Bulba"" to enchant readers with the heroic and colorful legends of the Kozak defenders of the Ukrainian steppes and built his short story around the human tragedy of a father (Taras) who discovers his traitorous son is fighting against his own people.

Although he wrote in Russian, Gogol constantly asked his mother living in Ukraine to detail colorful Ukrainian customs, dress, songs, folklore and history to help authenticate a period that captured his imagination. Unfortunately, this proud and unique heritage of Ukrainians still sticks in the craw of  today's chauvinist Russians.

Bear in mind this film's $25 million budget was completely footed by the Russian Ministry of Culture who have much bigger fish to fry... Poor Putin and the rest of the Russian skinheads who must resort to perpetual chest-thumping! (Just watch any of the myriad combat films being cranked out non-stop in the Motherland these days, glorifying their Spetsnaz warriors in violent wars in Chechnya, Afghanistan and any other place where ""threatened"" Russians ""feel surrounded"" and must ""defend themselves"".) But the other major thorn for the Russians is the existence of an independent Ukrainian state...

It doesn't matter to the Kremlin that the action of Taras Bulba took place long before Peter the Great dragged the resistant Muscovites kicking and screaming to rename themselves as ""Russians"", thus stealing the royal pedigree of the Kievan Empire (""Rus"") from Ukraine. (Education and things like printing presses took even longer to break through to the Tsar's superstitious Muscovites because they were seen as ""the work of the devil"". Russian hate/envy of all things Western exists to this day.)

But Peter understood only too well that his Muscovites desperately needed a pedigree more presentable than their primitive origins in the northern swamps. In the past, Muscovites had vainly tried to manufacture an imposing lineage. The grandiose ""Third Rome"" idea sputtered before it could fly. (remnant: ""Tsar"" was derived from ""Caesar"")... so, presto-chango.... just snatch all the intellectuals away from enlightened Ukrainian universities and claim the Kievan Empire for their own. Now the Muscovites started to preen before the world as ""Russ-ians""....

This is the real reason the Kremlin has produced this propaganda film, brazenly stealing the uniquely Ukrainian ethos of the steppes, Taras Bulba and the Kozaks. Purpose: to load it with disinformation.

How does this film compare with the 1962 Hollywood version? Well, filmed on location in Ukraine in 2007, this Bortko movie is more consistent in set design, costumes, and overall authenticity to the original novel than the romanticized Yul Brynner / Tony Curtis 1962 version which ludicrously displaced the endless wide Ukrainian steppes with Argentine mountains.

I was always convinced this title role was one of Yul Brynner's most powerful portrayals, and it is a credit to Bohdan Stupka that his unique assumption of Taras is equally valid... older and more contemplative, perhaps a bit wiser.... Both films featured several different scenes from the novel. The part of Yankel the Jew was completely omitted in TB 1962, while TB 2007 drops the brutal hazing of Taras' sons by Polish students. The storming of the Polish castle walls with ladders is extremely well done in 2007..... but yet there was a delightful chemistry between Tony Curtis and Christine Kaufmann in the more playful 1962 version... with help, of course, from Franz Waxman's magnificent score which is light years better than the 2007 pretentious slow-motion musical themes during climactic battle scenes and irritating Zamfir-like flute music.

But the biggest turn-off in the present movie occurs during the last brutal battle (blood spurting at every opportunity), when dying Kozak warriors indulge in countless melodramatic praises to the Holy Russian Motherland and even to the Tsar, as they draw their last breaths. (In what insane universe would these wild, proud, and independent Ukrainian Kozaks have ever died with the name of any ruler, much less their hated Russian enemy, the Tsar, on their lips?) Embarrassing to sit through, and more melodramatic than the worst potboiler Italian opera. But then, that was its purpose - propaganda for ""Great"" Russia, pure and simple: continue to rewrite history by confusing the very real distinctions between Ukrainians and Russians. The Kremlin's overriding aim is to bully Ukraine away from NATO and to punish Poland for supporting Ukrainians in their Orange Revolution. (BTW, this movie has been severely criticized in both Ukraine and Poland...)

Too bad this great story was twisted into cheap agit-prop. In Soviet ideology, the propaganda film was one of the most powerful agents of social change and control over the masses. Uraaaaaaah!....... As the current Kremlin continues leading Russians down this same path, Eisenstein is surely grinning in his proletarian grave.",1251936000,54,5414,5.357647058823529
