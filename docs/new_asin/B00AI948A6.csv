8551966,1,B00AI948A6,"I got this in time so the 1 star isn't about the seller but about the movie itself. If your looking for a punisher, deathwish, vigilante, boondock saints type movie this isn't it. Its filmed like a bad porno and is more like a liberals view on the type of movie. The main character is more or less against such things, and his police officer friend is the one doing the killings and trying to bring him in on it. I wouldnt recommend this movie",1477353600,,443,4.223529411764706
