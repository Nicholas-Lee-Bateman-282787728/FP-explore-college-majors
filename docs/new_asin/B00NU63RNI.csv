8680255,5,B00NU63RNI,I love this movie.  This is my 2nd one - the first one wore out between me replaying and loaning to others! Thank you to the creative minds that created this easy-to-follow explanation of how the universe really works.,1444348800,4,218,4.589743589743589
8680256,1,B00NU63RNI,"What the Bleep!? Down the Rabbit Hole - Quantum Edition 5 disc set

A colleague at work recommended this film to me, and after looking around for a copy I decided to purchase a used edition of the 5 disc set, and although the film is out of production the used copy was still expensive. Still, I looked forward to being able to see an in-depth scientific documentary during some time off work... boy was I wrong!

So to begin with I viewed the original (shorter) theatrical version of the film, and this I found confusing and troubling in its presentation. I have watched every science and physics documentary on the BBC for years (professor Jim Al-Khalili, professor Marcus du Sautoy, etc) so I have a good basic introduction to the subject matter already. To begin with, I didn't fully understand why the film annoyed me so much. Then I viewed the longer extended version, and this time analysed what was being said.

There are two parts entwined within the film. One part presents known scientific knowledge regarding quantum physics that has empirical evidence to back it up, and to be honest these parts are presented in a clear manner. Then the other part of the film takes this known scientific knowledge and extrapolates a whole list of extraordinary claims that are unfounded and in actual fact have nothing to do with quantum physics. In short, the film is misinformation, the film is a misrepresentation of present scientific knowledge.

It worries me because this film is clearly aimed at the average person, and in doing so is exploiting the fact that the average person is mentally incapable (or mentally too lazy) of thinking in a rational, reasoned, critical, objective way. Indeed, I find it a difficult task myself, especially when being bombarded with unfamiliar scientific concepts and language.

Some objectionable points:

1. Empirical scientific knowledge of Quantum Entanglement, one particle being entangled with another regardless of distance and time - from this the film claims that one particle is entangled with ALL other particles in the universe, that all is one.

2. Empirical scientific knowledge that when a wave function is observed (measured by a scientific instrument) it becomes a particle in a specific time and place - from this the film claims that 'observation' means observation by the human eye and by extension observation by the human consciousness, that is, by observing with our consciousness we literally create physical reality. The film urges us to become better observers in order to create the reality we desire... wish fulfillment... rather infantile.

3. Scientific theory of the Unified Field or Super String Field being the foundation or base level of quantum physics - from this the film claims that the Unified Field is 'pure consciousness', that consciousness brings physical matter into existence, that thought creates the universe. And following on from the misinformation regarding entanglement, the film claims that we do not have individual consciousness, but that we are one with the universal consciousness of the Unified Field, and our physical bodies and physical reality is a manifestation of the universal consciousness.

4. The film claims that by thought we can create our own reality. By extension, the film also claims that disease is caused by the way we think. One 'scientist' actually says that by changing the way we think we can change our genetic structure... which of course is nonsense.

5. There there are ludicrous claims such as thought intentions put upon water, whether positive or negative, can determine the structure of the ice crystal when said water is frozen. The films line of reasoning is that if human thought can affect the shape of ice crystal growth, then just imagine what effect our thoughts have upon our own bodies as our bodies are 90% water (actually, our bodies are between 55% to 75 % water, but no matter). Ha! Totally pure water does no freeze. In order for water to freeze, a nucleator (an impurity such as a particle of dust, or even a bubble) has to be in the water to be the nucleus of an ice crystal, that is, an object upon which an ice crystal can form and grow. So the shape of an ice crystal is determined by the type of nucleator and its size. Nothing to do with imprinted thought intentions! There is more nonsense like this in the film, such as thought intentions being imprinted upon electrical devices.

And so it goes on and on and on, one nonsense claim after another, all using twisted and misrepresented facts to back them up. And ALL of them can be torn to shreds with a little bit of rational thinking.

Then there are the 'scientists' whose testimony is used to back up these nonsense claims, such as...

Joseph Dispenza, D.C., Doctor of Chiropractic Degree, Life University... yes, that's CHIROPRACTIC: a system of complementary medicine based on the diagnosis and manipulative treatment of misalignments of the joints, especially those of the spinal column... Mr Dispenza literally has nothing to do with quantum physics what-so-ever!

To his credit, David Albert, Ph. D., Professor and Director of PHILOSOPHICAL Foundations of Physics, Columbia University, the first interview on the first interview DVD, forthrightly says that the claims of the film are unfounded and are at odds with the scientific consensus regarding quantum physics. However, because the language is technical, I doubt that the average person will understand exactly that his point of view is the antithesis of the film's.

JZ Knight doesn't even have a title board come up before her interview. No wonder!... JZ Knight is an American mystic teacher and author, and is known for claiming to be the channel of a spiritual entity named Ramtha... she peaks in tongues! And it has made her a millionaire! JZ Knight is also the founder and president of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment... this film, 'What the Bleep!?', is made by Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. The aforementioned Joseph Dispenza is a member of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment.

In short, this film has an agenda: to make huge amounts of money for the makers of the film and all those involved, either directly through film distribution or indirectly through book sales, tours etc. That these people chose to make their money by exploiting the ignorance of the average person who are desperate to find some meaning in a meaningless universe.",1443052800,4,6413,4.979439252336449

It was interesting to see Marlee Matlin again (deaf actress who won an Oscar).",1438646400,2,172,4.580645161290323
8680258,5,B00NU63RNI,"Great video. I had originally bought the ""blue"" version and actually like it better buy this is a bit different and a lot more material. I recommend you get this but if you just want to o watch the movie I prefer the blue version. Each has its pros / cons but this one has a ton more interviews.",1438214400,3,295,4.016949152542373
