The story centers around Jimarcus who is a marketing executive for a record label, and his girlfriend Latrisha an aspiring model. Jimarcus's co worker and college friend Deshawn does not care for Latrisha too much, as he feels that they are moving too fast. Latrisha begins talking to a mysterious guy on the internet and choas ensues. There are twists and turns in this movie that i won't spoil for you. Good script, good cast, and good director on this one. It's definitely worth checking out if you like independent films.",1355356800,,591,4.803921568627451
