8642073,5,B00IH1P27K,Great show with a lot of dvd exclusive features.,1431043200,,48,4.444444444444445
8642074,5,B00IH1P27K,"It's tricky to rate niche products, but I'm going to assume if you found yourself here in the first place, you already would give this 5 stars, so probably no controversy there.

Beyond that, the commentary track is awesome, the episodes are all great, and I can't wait for the next! Keep up the great work Pat!",1393718400,,311,4.456140350877193
8642075,4,B00IH1P27K,"Pat is a goofy, fun loving nintendo nerd. He brings this charm to the screen with quirky stories and adventures about loving retro games.  Not only is he entertaining but he is also very knowledgeable.  I've never seen anyone with such knowledge and it just totally captures your interest for collecting these digitized little gems.  No blowing on the connectors though Pat!  You're gonna rust them.  If there's anything that disappoints, it's that as a girl gamer, some of the ""other"" content is a bit of a put off.  Overall, This DVD is a good buy for anyone with a love for old school gaming.  Sit back, grab the popcorn, and hopefully you'll learn a thing or two as well.",1392768000,,675,4.575
8642076,5,B00IH1P27K,"Pat the NES Punk volume 3 is a great DVD, but, it's even better with the Volume 1and 2! Wristbands are nice too!",1392681600,,112,3.9130434782608696
8642077,5,B00IH1P27K,"He's neither angry nor irate, he's the Punk. In his own brand of comedy and informative retro video game reviews, Pat The NES Punk delivers. Insight into these old NES games of yesteryear comes few and between, sometimes more often than not. In addition to most of your common games most people tended to own, Pat also educates on titles not a lot of people may have owned or even heard about back then, perhaps something you might've passed by on the shelf at a local video store. I eagerly await future volumes to come.",1392681600,,521,4.494736842105263
8642078,5,B00IH1P27K,"It was the best of the times, it was the worst of times and then there is the nes punk of all time. Otherwise known as Pat or Patrick as Frank, the keeper of knowledge for all of life's unsolved mysteries, refers to him. Join Pat on his fantabulous journey through Nostalgiaville. You'll laugh and maybe even cry but it won't be because of the price. It's a steal at whatever price Pat deems worthy. If you want to be able to sit back and enjoy hours of great nes games and comedy hi jinx then this DVD is for you. It practically has your name written on it. If your name is Pat it literally does. Did I mention Frank? This mysterious wizard assists Pat in his quest for knowledge by answering a barrage of well thought out questions. I Highly recommend this for all people who are a kid at heart and have a sense of humor.",1392681600,,823,4.182389937106918
8642079,5,B00IH1P27K,"Pat the nes punk is a goofy, fun, often times over the top silly (in the good three stooges sort of way) web show that will make you want to go dig your childhood nintendo out of storage to play all your classic favorites and pick some up you have never played before.

This gets most notably compared to the Angry video game nerd, but in my opinion is a bit of a different monster where as the AVGN reminds you of childhood frustration, ""The Nes Punk"" reminds of blowing on your copy of contra hearing that title screen and knowing you where about to kick some alien ass.

Now this dvd set much like volume  one and two is stuffed like a thanksgiving turkey with goodies some of my favorite being the NES marathon moments. The ""NES Punk episodes"" are full of fun humor, honestly they make me laugh out loud. Where as ""The Flea Market Madness"" episodes are a must watch for any collector as pat gives great tips and tricks to getting your favorite games at fair prices.

If you are a fan of fun, silly and good goofy humor this is a must own DVD collection with over eight hours of material it will leave you satisfied.

Also there is an anthropomorphized ROB the robot what more could you want?",1392681600,2,1195,4.316964285714286
8642080,5,B00IH1P27K,"Pat ""the Nes Punk"" Contri's third DVD in his online series of retro video game reviewing humor is something you shouldn't hesitate on buying, especially if you like NES games, wacky reviews, and aging hippies named ""Frank""",1392681600,,222,5.027027027027027
