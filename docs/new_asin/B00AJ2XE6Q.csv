If you're used to Hollywood, you won't like any low-budget Indies.
But if the story means more to you than the packaging, this film is worth a watch. Unique.",1460419200,,347,4.704918032786885
8552448,5,B00AJ2XE6Q,"A different sort of Horror Film. It has some Christian themes underlying the premise of a film maker who discovers that woman in the Last Great Snuff Film never really died and wants to correct this. It is a wordy script, but causes thought. All the acting is solid and straight forward. Fine performance by Kelly Barry-Miller as the woman who msut do everything she can't to save her stepdaughter. Creepy, intense, yet surprisingly not grisly for a horror film dealing with killings and the ilk. Would recommend anyone give it a try!",1432166400,,534,4.752688172043011
8552449,5,B00AJ2XE6Q,"I love movies made by independent filmmakers because they are frequently willing to tackle themes that few in Hollywood will.  Such is the case with this film.  ""Remake"" tells the story of a preacher whose daughter Megan is kidnapped by a snuff filmmaker.  The filmmaker, known as Twitch, kills young women, films their deaths, and then sells the movies to rich clients.  The preacher soon learns that his wife Rita has a dark and disturbing past that is directly tied to the kidnapping of his daughter.  Rita was at one time a porn star.  Her death was faked in her last movie, which was made nearly 20 years ago.  Twitch wants to remake that movie, this time killing Rita for real.  He tells Rita to exchange herself for Megan.  If Rita refuses, Twitch will remake the movie anyway, killing Megan instead.  The violence in ""Remake"" is quite gruesome at times.  At the same time, ""Remake"" forces us to think about the true horror of what some people will do for money.  A large part of the story focuses on the preacher's struggle to deal with his wife's dark past, something which he previously knew nothing about.  He preaches forgiveness from the pulpit, but finds himself unwilling to forgive Rita--but he must find a way if he has any hope of saving his daughter.  ""Remake"" was almost two hours long, but I hardly noticed.  I was mesmerized from beginning to end.",1411603200,,1369,4.645833333333333
8552450,5,B00AJ2XE6Q,"Doug Phillips is a busy, hardworking filmmaker and also wears many other hats for this film: actor, writer, and producer of Remake.  The film is informative and unique - blending horror with a christian faith message.  'Remake' an interesting movie to watch and I recommend it.",1355875200,,277,5.0
