2167600,3,B00064ALIG,"I am a serious fan of Stolove's series on Chair Dancing and Chair Tone-up, but found the yoga one difficult to follow, especially the instructions on controlling your breathing.  However, people who really like yoga and cannot stand much (or at all) - as I can't - would enjoy it probably.",1405814400,2,289,4.666666666666667
2167601,5,B00064ALIG,used my dvd and love it so I bought one for my arthritic sister..,1405555200,,65,3.7142857142857144
2167602,5,B00064ALIG,"This is my second disc,  I wore out the other one.

For anyone with limitations,  this provides a remarkable work out.  I have the whole series",1402963200,5,143,4.384615384615385
2167603,2,B00064ALIG,I HAVE ALWAYS LIKE HER YOGA.  HER MOVES ARE EASY TO FOLLOW .  HOWEVER I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR HALF A CD OF HER ADVERTISING FOR HER OTHER YOGA TAPES. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.,1394409600,10,178,3.9166666666666665
2167604,4,B00064ALIG,I purchased this dvd with the notion of conducting such a class in the future.  I was pleased with the poses that could be done sitting down.,1390780800,,141,4.222222222222222
2167605,5,B00064ALIG,IT FITS JUST WHAT I NEED FOR EXERCISE DEALING WITH ARTHRITIS. VERY EASY TO PARTICIPATE AND MAKES ME FEEL MUCH BETTER.,1377820800,,117,4.619047619047619
2167606,5,B00064ALIG,"I have felt so much better since starting ""chair yoga"".  I have more energy and don't get out of bed in the mornings with a lot of aches and pains.  I would recommend it and as a matter of fact, I have told relatives and friends to get it.",1334102400,6,239,3.857142857142857
2167607,1,B00064ALIG,"The instruction, instructor, and class are all OK, upbeat and good models. However, I was prepared for an hour of yoga, and maybe a second routine for the next day. The DVD has only one, 1/2 hour routine. It would have cost them very little to add another one or two 1/2 hour lessons to the tape. I feel seriously gypped and taken advantage of.

For the $20 price you can get a lot more. I recommend ""Yoga for Caregivers"". It has many more poses, several lessons, is 140 minutes long, is safe and gentle, is effective, and costs under $10 on Amazon.",1332028800,11,549,4.330097087378641
2167608,5,B00064ALIG,"I tried a bunch of seated exercise DVDs.  This is the ONLY one I found that I liked.  Here is a short list of positive features.
Music is inoffensive.
Shows individuals of all body types, ages, and races, and types of dress.
Shows how exercises can be done at different levels of difficulty.
Not too complex, but not trivial either.
Authentic, good adaptations of yoga exercises.
Well-sequenced, good selection.
Not too long, and possible to select subset.
Reasonable energy level.
Speaker is positive without being silly.
Not too wordy, but enough talking to facilitate doing steps.

Perhaps it is just a good match for me, but I liked it, find it enjoyable, and it makes me feel good.  Every other DVD I tried, I had a problem with either the music or the actors or the voice or the exercises themselves: I either found it annoying or foolish or offensive or uninspiring or just something I would never do.",1263340800,32,908,4.6918238993710695
