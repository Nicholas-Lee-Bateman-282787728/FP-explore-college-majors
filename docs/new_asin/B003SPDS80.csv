4189134,5,B003SPDS80,"Ok, I own the other three already and I am counting down the days to this one and the other three that will follow. The Japanese music DESTROYS the American music, and I'm American. You have the choice to either watch it in English (with original voice actors) or the original Japanese voice. Watching it either way is epic. The picture and quality of sound get 11 out of 10 rating from me and all my other friends that watch these with me. The DBZ Boxes are worth every penny... and then some! I mean come on... UNCUT, HD QUALITY, ORIGINAL MUSIC/VOICES... what more could a TRUE DBZ fan want??? BUY IT AND YOU SHALL BE PLEASED!!!",1280966400,5,630,4.3931623931623935
4189135,5,B003SPDS80,"This is the only way to watch Dragonball Z. The quality of the video picture is perfect. It is exactly the way that it aired in Japan. I know because I was there watching it.  It does not have any of the stupid American music. It does include an English voice track but I wish it didn't. If you watch it with American music and English voices then you aren't really watching Dragonball Z. It's almost the same as watching power rangers.

Watch the Dragonbox if you really love Dragonball.",1279843200,7,488,4.411111111111111
4189136,5,B003SPDS80,Who cares if  is dosent have the American score on it the point of the dragon box is to give the viewer the original version of the dragonball z experience. if you are watching the dvd for the intro music than you should not watch it at all. and also who cares if you buy it one person not buying it isint going to make funimation change their masterpiece.,1279584000,15,356,4.159420289855072
4189140,4,B003SPDS80,"I grew up watching the show on Toonami so I am a huge fan of the american score music.  This sadly did not have it but the picture quality made up the difference.  Compare it to the orange bricks the picture quality is a thousand times better.  The japanese music isn't even bad either.  There are a ton of special features including next episode previews.  Luckily I borrowed this set so I didn't have to pay for it but it was nice to see the remastered picture.  It truly is for fans of the original anime.

If you prefer the American score though either buy the orange bricks since they are very cheap now or just wait a little longer.  Dragonball Z Kai is ending soon and once the last Dragon Box set is released I'm sure Funimation will re-release the entire series on blu ray with both music scores.",1303603200,,805,4.32
4189141,5,B003SPDS80,"DBZ Dragon Box Four is a great addition to any collector's DBZ series.  My kids really enjoy these episodes.  This DBZ Box has audio options for any particular user's preferences regarding original soundtrack or more current dubbing.  I prefer the original Japanese production/language/music, so at least these DBZ Boxes provide the options to present them in these formats.  I grew up watching the original format and actually like the options these DVDs provide.  The quality of this DBZ Box and the previous three suit my preferences just fine.  If other users prefer different types of dubbing to more current visual/audio options, there are other choices of releases available.  We are happy with this purchase.",1291593600,,716,5.228070175438597
4189142,5,B003SPDS80,Funimation will only be releasing the Dragonbox's for a limited time so if you are fan you might want to pick these up while you still can.,1289174400,,139,4.185185185185185
4189143,5,B003SPDS80,"This is a review for Dragon Box 4.

I was very satisfied with this set. This has the Pony Canyon remastered footage. The season sets, however, were cropped and had terrible color remasterings. It was very DVNR'd. This, however, is a true remastering, with frame-by-frame restoration. It has 42 episodes, and also comes with a Dragon Book. The Dragon book is an episode guide and a special features book. These episodes cover the Artificial Humans Arc and the Cell Arc. It stops around the beginning of the Cell Games. Overall, this is an enjoyable set and I recommend it fully!",1286409600,2,577,4.77
4189144,5,B003SPDS80,"I used to love the English dub with the American music and I now see the light. It all started with ""playing"" around with the subtitles and noticing that they were way off. Some of the translations were completely different, I figured that it was because of the translation process, things are meant to get 'lost'. I did some research and for what ever reason FUNImation decided to not be faithful to the series and as I result the series is completely different.

I recently started watching the dragon box in Jap/ with english subtitles and boy does it make a difference. The story literally feels much more solid and geared toward an older crowd. So now I fully understand why these boxes were made to default in jap with english subtitles. I would have preferred the series in english, but since the dub isn't faithful, than theres no point.

Although we do have Dragon ball Z kai which is coming out in parts and that series is being dubbed the 'correct' way and its much more faithful to the original series. Not to mention the story is much more fluid and faster paced, which we all 'hardcore fans' need to re-watch something we've watched multiple times.

I rate this box a perfect 5 because it has everything you need to enjoy the series the way it was meant to be seen. It has the original themes, and it was restored the correct way, leaving the footage untouched, with original colors. Also the package its self looks amazing! I have all four volumes together and they look stunning, they seriously look like they're worth much more! For Dragon ball Z fans, this box set is a must!

Please keep in mind that I started watching dragon ball z in toonami when I was 15 years old and I was fond of the english dub and the American music. So for those who think, they can't get used to the Japanese music, you can! just give it time and you'll notice that its worth your time.

4189145,5,B003SPDS80,"These releases are amazing and the next line in the series doesn't dissapoint.
We pick up right where dbox 3 left of, with Yamcha finding Artificial Humans #19 and 20.
This goes far up to early Cell Games I believe.
A great batch of episodes in a nice box with a nice little book to boot in amazing quality! Truly the way DBZ was meant to be seen.
If you're a fan and you haven't seen the dragon boxes, do yourself a favor and pick them up. You won't regret it.",1285372800,,461,4.076923076923077
4189146,5,B003SPDS80,"While I pre-ordered mine from rightstuf, it's nice that the Dragon Box is being supported.
It would have been nicer if ""Z"" was redubbed in the same fashion as Kai and with the obviously better script, we can't all win right? Anyway, I'm a fan of the Japanese version so it doesn't bother me at all. There's kai for the English version.

The episodes take place right where box 3 left off, and should go up to the beginning of the Cell Games.
They better put Son Gohan on box 5!

That leaves SSJ Son Goku with Box 6, and Piccolo for Box 7(or vice versa)",1283040000,7,552,4.19811320754717
4189147,5,B003SPDS80,i own the first 3 and am fairly sure this one will be just as great. i just order box four and i already cant wait for box five. and as for the missing score i started watching dbz back in 1997 and it didn't even have a dub. so the missing score is meaningless to me.,1282694400,6,267,3.7017543859649122
4189148,5,B003SPDS80,"The REAL way this series was meant to be seen! This set is for the true DBZ fans. These were originally released in Japan in a very limited quantity and were very expensive. So a big applause for Funimation for finally doing something right, and giving us these at an awesome price. These sets have the original Japanese audio and video, and it's all perfectly remastered. (Unlike the fake remastered orange brick sets.) Don't worry, there is an English dub too. The only bad thing about these sets, is there are no extras on the discs. But I'm betting they will be included in the last set.
And for those of you complaining about them not including the Bruce Faulconer music, HAHA! Go buy the crappy orange bricks and stay away from my Dragon Boxes.",1281830400,5,750,4.562962962962963
4189149,5,B003SPDS80,"The 4th set in the Dragon Box series, just as great as the last ones! Another worthy buy. It doesn't include FUNimation's dub score but it does include everything else (plus the dub score is unfaithful to the original version anyways). Video quality and audio quality are great just as usual.",1281484800,7,292,4.745098039215686
8404577,5,B003SPDS80,Should have ended with Cell Saga.,1470960000,,33,4.666666666666667
8404578,5,B003SPDS80,"If you're still here, you're set to be all in for getting these Dragon Box's.  Although the box art depicts Cell, this contains both the Android and incomplete (not imperfect) Cell Saga.  After this you only have 1 more box set to have all of Cell and a MUCH BETTER ending to DBZ.  As far as I'm concerned - and I'm a die-hard DBZ fan - you only need to go as far as Cell; after that, it just gets really ridiculous.

The Majin Buu saga is like if you're playing a game where you have to pick the correct door to progress, and every door that you're lead by all accounts indicates to you that it's the right one you're greeted with a ""HAHA SUCKERS! YOU PICKED WRONG! TRY AGAIN!"" and that just gets old after awhile.  That sums up Majin Buu, every idea, every plot thread, everything introduce is suddenly and radically given a left turn for no other reason than to just keep the series going.  If you've ever seen the Robot Chicken skit with M. Night ""What a twist!"" that's the saga in a nutshell.",1451174400,,997,4.248677248677248
8404579,5,B003SPDS80,long time dbz fan and these dvds are great. Japanese audio true to the manga can help differentiate how far off the funi dub is from the manga,1373932800,,142,4.107142857142857
8404580,5,B003SPDS80,"Realy enjoyed watching this series on TV.
Can't wait to watch this uncut box.

8404583,5,B003SPDS80,The Dragon Ball Z Dragon Box four is Awesome.  The Dragon Ball series is enjoyable to watch.  I would recommend this product for anyone who enjoys the Dragon Ball series.,1344124800,,170,4.633333333333334
8404584,5,B003SPDS80,Wonderful set. I would highly recommend it to hard core fans if you can still get your hands on it!,1334793600,,99,4.0
8404585,5,B003SPDS80,"The Dragon Boxes are great, as an owner of both the season sets and Dragon Boxes, I would recommend the Dragon Boxes for hardcore fans of the subbed anime.  They are in 4:3 format instead of 16:9 like the season sets, although this may be a little annoying it's better because that's how the series was made.  In 16:9 format you lose some of the screen. The Dragon Boxes went through a much better remastering process, in the season sets, many lines were deleted do to the remastering process used. They do not include the English broadcast music, so if your not a fan of the Japanese music or the 4:3 format then I would recommend the season sets, I you like both of these then I would recommend the Dragon Boxes.",1313020800,,714,4.401515151515151
8404586,5,B003SPDS80,"I originally owned the orange DVD sets of DBZ and I picked up the Dragon Boxes because I wanted to see for myself what the difference was. The first noticeable difference is that the Dragon Box packaging is much better. The discs come in their own book (3 per book/6 total). In addition, there is a Dragon Book which is a little hardcover with character profiles and sketches. The packaging is just sublime. You have the same audio options has you do with the orange sets (Japanese mono, English dub, Japanese score only). The English dub is high quality (sound wise, not necessarily in voice acting) while the Japanese audio still has the same 96 kbps treatment that the orange sets have. So the audio quality is exactly the same as the orange sets. Yet, the sets are automatically made to play the Japanese audio with English subtitles which makes it odd that the Japanese audio is so low. Either way, it's a mono track and thus there isn't much that can be done.

The sets retain the original aspect ratio. The widescreen cropping of the orange sets never bothered me but if you'd prefer the full-screen then you should pick up these sets. As for quality, the Dragon Boxes are definitely more well preserved and there are little to no blemishes on the screen. The orange sets contained the occasional obvious blemish (missing lines, etc.). Strangely, the colors in the orange sets seem to be a bit more brighter. I am unsure what to attribute that to.

So if you have the orange sets, should you pick up the Dragon Boxes? If you prefer the original aspect ratio, then yes. If you'd like better packaging, then yes. Otherwise, there is little motivation to make the switch. The audio is the same as the orange sets and you still don't have access to the U.S. dub score. Visually there is improvement, but the average person won't be able to tell a significant difference. Yet, I cannot deny the quality of this release and so if you do not have the series yet then get the Dragon Boxes!",1305331200,,1988,4.565826330532213
