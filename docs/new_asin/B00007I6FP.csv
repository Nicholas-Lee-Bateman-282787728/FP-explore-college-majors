1810406,5,B00007I6FP,"With the fact that the show has been on for ten seasons and the proliferation of gritty and realistic programming now on TV (especially on HBO which has no restrictions), one can forget the power and shock of NYPD Blue when it premiered in 1993.  David Bochco insisted that ABC allow him to use minor profanities and brief nudity to create a more realistic portrayal of the lives of New York City cops.  While several stations balked at the show and refused to carry it, the show was an instant success.  What really made the show so interesting was not the language or nudity, but the well written shows and first rate acting.  Bochco veteran Dennis Franz plays alcoholic detective Andy Sipowicz, who was only supposed to be in the first episode, whose character is gunned down and nearly dies.  Mr. Franz is superb as the volcanic Sipowicz and was rewarded with the first of his four Best Actor Emmys for the season, but the real star of the season is David Caruso.  Mr. Caruso is simply magnetic as Sipowicz's partner John Kelly.  Whereas Sipowicz is a hot head, Kelly exudes cool and calm.  He is passionate about what he does, but his anger boils beneath the surface where Sipowicz's explodes.  It is this dynamic between the two that makes the pairing work as one of the best in TV cop show history.  Other cast members include Sherry Stringfield as Assistant D.A. Laura Michaels who is also Kelly's ex-wife, Amy Brenneman as Janice Licalsi who is a police desk officer that is tangled up with the mob and carrying on an affair with Kelly, James McDaniel as Lt. Arthur Fancy who heads the department and is black.  Sipowicz is also a racist which causes much tension between him and Fancy.  Nicholas Turturro is Dt. James Martinez who is a new detective who struggles for acceptance on the job.  Future series regulars, Gordon Clapp as Greg Medavoy, Sharon Lawrence as Assistant D.A. Sylvia Costas and Gail O'Grady as receptionist Donna Abandando all appear as recurring characters before all were made full time cast members in the season two.  Actors like David Schwimmer, Michael Rappaport, Wendie Malik, Daniel Benzali, John Wesley Shipp and Bradley Whitford have guest roles.  Season one of the show almost seems like a separate show all together due to the massive cast changes that occurred after the season.  Mr. Caruso believed all the hype about him and made the mistake many actors who achieve success on a TV show, that they can become movie stars.  Mr. Caruso left the show after four brief appearances in season two and never achieved the stardom that he seemed slated for.  Sherry Stringfield left the show after the season to go to another show that would be even more popular, ER and Amy Brenneman also left the cast.  For the one season that he was on the show though, Mr. Caruso created an indelible image and the show would continue on through the rest of the decade as one the most popular and well made shows on television.",1049673600,106,2951,4.684108527131783
1810407,5,B00007I6FP,"What a joy to be able and revisit this show. I clearly recall the uproar it caused when it premiered, and it's still pretty provocative lo these ten years on.
If you follow the show, Dennis Franz has created one of the greatest characters in the history of television. Sipowicz is one for the ages, and seeing the tortured man in the initial episode, unable to know what we know...he calls his (unbeknownst to him) future wife a ""p***y little b***h"" within the first minutes of the first episode, for example...it's a bit like going back in time.
Again, looking at that first episode. The cast includes, of course, the outstanding David Caruso (you can't take your eyes off him when he's onscreen...now he's on CSI: Miami), Amy Brennemann (Judging Amy), Sherrie Stringfield (ER), Nicholas Turturro, James McDaniel, Daniel Benzali, even David Schwimmer (Ross from Friends)...is a delight. The video transfer is eye-popping. The crisp yellows of the NY taxis, the cool blues in the station, Caruso's hair...all delivered vividly, with killer sound as well.
Oh yeah...this is great stuff.",1048809600,42,1085,5.033333333333333
1810408,5,B00007I6FP,"Well I received my season one NYPD DVD's this morning, watched 2 episodes already, I'm in TV heaven, it doesn't come any better than this(thats TV of course!).I thought Hill Street was the best but I think Bochco & co surpassed themselves with this, like other reveiwers I think the departure of David Caruso as the King of cool John Kelly was a big blow, (but to be fair Jimmy Smits as Bobby Simone in series 2 was a great replacement)
Dennis Franz is brilliant as Andy Sipowicz, but the shows greatess asset is its humanity, you care about the characters because you know they care, something clearly lacking in many movies and TV shows today, anyway starting to get a bit deep so better say goodbye to our American cousins,keep making great shows!",1048204800,20,750,4.604477611940299
1810409,5,B00007I6FP,"Definitely the best season of them all....David Caruso was excellent on the show..a shame he decided to leave.  I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1.  I am a fan of all of the seasons, but this is where it all started and these are some great episodes.  A definite to add to the collection!!",1047945600,6,284,4.423076923076923
1810410,5,B00007I6FP,"To Kate (London, UK - See More About Me).
Obviously the reviewers were people who followed the show on television -- I'm one -- and are glad that this show is finally on DVD.  I hate to say it but, after John Kelly left, I stopped watching the show.  Jimmy Smits took his place, but after 4 years of L.A. Law, Jimmy and I had to part ways.
Anyway, when Miami Vice hits the DVD's there will be the same kind of responses. Those who have followed the show with superior knowledge re: cast and characters and are glad to have a chance to see any good series once more.",1047859200,3,565,4.127272727272727
1810411,5,B00007I6FP,"Agree with another reviewer about this being the show's best season. The stories were fantastic, the acting top-notch, and Caruso perfectly embodied the noble Irish NYC cop with an intensity that left the show with a giant emotional hole once he departed.",1047513600,10,255,5.095238095238095
1810412,5,B00007I6FP,"This DVD has not been released yet so I can't write a review.  I am curious as to how the other reviewers managed to critique an item which is not available.
It's magic!",1043280000,9,169,4.121212121212121
1810413,5,B00007I6FP,"The David Caruso season was the best of the series, hands down!  The episodes were fresh, we were just starting to get to know the characters, Sipowicz was at his most flawed, and Caruso's John Kelly was on fire and full of intensity.
Certainly, part of the early criticism surrounding the show at the beginning was due to the ""adult content"", but it really wasn't anything you wouldn't see or hear in a somewhat tame PG-rated film.  Once the initial ire died down, viewers and even the show's detractors saw that the show was masterfully written, brilliantly acted, and totally engrossing.
This 6 disc set offers running commentary on selected episodes, plus a small handful of other features.  But you shouldn't need any of those carrots dangled in front of you to get you to buy this box set.  It's just a great show, period.
**** Only drawback:  The John Kelly character exited after the 4th show of the second season, so with this box set we don't get to see the conclusion of his story arc.  It would've been great if Fox could have included those 4 episodes.
So buy this box set, and also purchase ""The Shield - Season One"".  Own the two best cop shows ever made!",1041465600,25,1170,4.542857142857143
1810414,5,B00007I6FP,"WARNING: This review of a police drama may contain adult language and partial nudity.  Reader's discretion is advised.
The first twenty-two episodes make up the first season of this ground-breaking police drama.  Anyone who is a fan of the show, anyone who likes drama, anyone looking for heroes, this is where to start.  They may have flaws, but they are as real and true-to-life as characters on television are.
Die-hard fans will enjoy the extra features, plus seeing just how far Detective Andy Sipowicz (played by four-time Emmy winner Dennis Franz) has come with his character.  Those that have recently found the show will enjoy this trip through time to the beginning.
Watch closely, see if you can spot all the guest stars from the first season who launched and/or enhanced their careers from appearing on the show.
Ask anyone that is or was a member of the real NYPD, and they will tell you it is by far the most realistic show about cops ever.
As James McDaniel, who plays Lt. Arthur Fancy, said on his last episode in season seven about America's true heroes, ""...because when you're a cop in New York City, you're somebody.""",1039564800,18,1137,4.756345177664975

1810478,5,B00007I6FP,"Excellent cop series that survived a number of potentially disastrous cast changes over the course of its run.

It's worth noting that the show in its first season is quite different from the show it became.  The lead character, Detective Johnny Kelly (David Caruso) gives off a very different vibe than later characters who held his position, like Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits), Danny Sorenson (Ricky Schroeder), or John Clark (John-Paul Gosselaar) , and Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) is more of a supporting character than the lead he became as the show went on.

But the cases are great, and it's nice watching the spark of romances that will later develop into strong, loving marriages.",1470700800,,686,5.0

I am glad that Amazon got it .I believe it is one of the best shows that American tv has ever had. That kind of quality production and casting are not on the air anymore.

1810594,5,B00007I6FP,"I missed this series as was an expat for years,  I discovered it on Amazo by chance and think it is  sort of an UPDATED KOJAK with personal family relationships woven in, not overdone. IKojak just action little personal things, and HILL STREET BLUES too tied to that period of time, sort of depressing now.

Notice that Kojak was lower Manhattan too, but  Precinct 13  and this one is out of Precinct 15, nice touch.  I am  Just in 2nd season, got years to go unless get bored.  Could they keep up the series from season 3  to 13?

  I will find out by continuing or maybe sneak ahead to see how they age.  Checked life of Dennis Franz and now an old man and quiet, worn out, but was his top role, so he cin his actingl life and now can retire comfortable where ever.",1465516800,,767,4.171232876712328

It shows the day to day  life in a detective squad on the job, and in each dective's personal life. As such it presents a true balance of a big city police department.

This series is one of the best, if not the best, police dramas ever filmed.  David Caruso is excellent in his role; it's unfortunate that he decided he could leave the series to become a movie star, which didn't work out.

1811059,4,B00007I6FP,"Too busy with work and family to watch when this show first aired. Really enjoying going through the series now though. Upon reading some background material on the program it is noted that the producers were looking to compete with cable TV... thus the nudity. Somewhere the claim was made that the show's nudie scenes were not gratuitous. In fact, you can see where the writers attempted to make the sex lives of the squad members an organic extension of the characters. They took us deep inside the souls of the members of the 15th precinct, so why not have access behind the bedroom door as well? It's part of who they were.

But guess what? At the end of the day the bare butts we routinely were exposed to were nothing *butt* gratuitous. The performers were naked for one reason; to make us look. Hind site informs us of this. My personal reaction to the nudity in NYPD Blue.... boring! I just fast forward through. The show is too good, even today, to have the episode's exposition impeded by bare-assed actors running around the set when their clothed performances were so darned good.

The acting is the glue that held this series together for 12 seasons. And not just the regular cast. The weekly guest stars playing the various perps and victims were highly believable. If convincing emotion had not emanated from the cons being grilled in interview rooms 1 and 2 the show would have been laughable. Fortunately everyone had great stories to tell and great lines to utter. The brilliant writing by Bochco, Milch, and the others was the deep substrate the show stood proudly on. That's why 20+ years later this is still a riveting series to take in.",1455408000,2,1659,4.658703071672355
1811060,5,B00007I6FP,"Few shows remain so relevant so many years later. This one is such a classic, it will stand the test of time. I remember being mesmerized by the slick story telling and direction, and superb acting by the main and side cast, the first time I watched this when I was a new immigrant to this country in the mid nineties. Episode after episode, season and after season, this one delivered. And then years later, when Audience Now decided to show all of it, I was recording it. Still the same slickness as I remembered.

One hell of a show, the producer and the directors, above all the incredible cast, every single one of them should be rightfully proud of this masterpiece.",1455235200,,672,4.508196721311475

Then, realizing my mistake, I wanted to see the earlier shows. The first season is great, because Danny's partner is Linda, who frankly is a much better character than his later partner, in my view, and more appealing.

I was in my 30's when the show came out and am enjoying watching it again with a new perspective.  I'm not sure if 30- somethings would enjoy it but I would say to give it a chance.  It's not the same as current shows -it feels more authentic.  The characters are real and flawed in genuine ways.

I am looking forward to see many more programs.  I've had my ROKU for almost a year and learned about Amazon prime video.  I was offered a 30 day free trial and at the end of thirty days I was willing to purchase Amazon Prime to watch many programs for free.  Some have a required payment but I am willing to pay if it is a good movie.  I had recently canceled my TV Subscriber because the monthly bills are more than I can afford as a Senior Citizen.

Seinfeld, Deadwood, Sons of Anarchy, The Wire, and at least a dozen more shows are represented here. Even ""That 70's Show"" shows up in a brief role. If you binge watch, of course, you'll feel some very familiar plot lines show up.

Glad to see that times have changed in police work and the job but like to be reminded of how challenging and frustrating crime still is. Police have to block out terrible incidents and go forward to step out into that city life everyday. Lots of great actors and up and coming actors you can see in minor roles. You really do care about their lives.

Takes a lot to walk from a show like this. But I do not take anything away from a great actor like Dennis Franz. His character equally pulls his weight and he did a amazing thing by maintaining the greatness of this show after Caruso left. Not many shows could've survived such a hit.

1811250,5,B00007I6FP,"22 Years later the power of the writing and the acting still ring true.  It is an honest excellence that was groundbreaking for its time and is free of the ""trying too hard"" unwatchable quality of many of today's wannabe TV drama series.  I was once again completely engrossed in this series after the Pilot.  This is a gripping and emotional story that could use another viewing by people trying to understand the ageless issue of good cops and and the few bad apples that ruin it for the thin blue line.  It also highlights the ageless problem of the code of silence that exits today 49 years after Serpico.  On another note, this series underscores the brilliance of online streaming.  I missed so many episodes of this weekly series due to work and buggy VCR's  back in the 90's when this originally aired.  It also reminds me of the good old days when you actually received over 48 minutes of programming per hour.  The extra 5 minutes this series has over today's series is perhaps an unfair advantage.  The excellent Law & Order series run just over 43 minutes.  Juxtaposed, the excellent Law & Order series become almost unwatchable with its abrupt and now seemingly contrived transitions.  This trip down memory lane is made even more entertaining by the appearance of many of today's well known actors often making their TV debuts in this series.  This would make a great drinking game for NYPD Blue parties.",1451606400,,1418,4.6923076923076925

1811326,5,B00007I6FP,It's nice to be able to watch this series again after all these years. Things that are taken for granted on tv now were completely unheard of and groundbreaking when NYPD Blue came on the scene. The stories are still great; they hold up incredibly well and the acting has always been amongst the best in tv. It's just an all around fantastic series and season one basically sets the characters. Andy Sipowicz is probably one of the greatest characters in television history.,1447372800,,474,4.72289156626506

1811346,4,B00007I6FP,"Wow, what a joy to find this great series again.  I did enjoy it on it's run but at the time my viewing was sporadic.  Looking forward to the Jimmy Smits era.  David Caruso is OK but what was the big to do about him?  Why did he leave?  His movie career was not that great.  Also, it is definitely the auxiliary characters that really sell the show. Gail O'Grady was never given her true worth as well as Amy Brenneman.  Kim Delaney was well over rated and Sherry Stringfield should have stayed.  Alas, ER was calling.  Well, as I said the supporting cast really gives the show it's depthand continued interest.",1446940800,,611,4.383928571428571

1811355,5,B00007I6FP,One of the most innovative show on network TV.  Most of the reason what you could put on new show was allow based on NYPD Blue pushing the walls out.  Detective walking into shower with ADA both show butts.  Never done before on TV.  Fit in issues of the day that had never been previously put on network TV.  Two Detectives discussing prostrate problems while standing at urinals in the station.  Character development was very good.,1446681600,,434,4.644736842105263

1811359,4,B00007I6FP,NYPD Blue picked up where Hill Street Blues left off.  The show introduced us to characters that have matured and developed as the series continued thru the various seasons.  The conflicts and tensions that existed among the squad members were well written and acted. These provided an excellent counterpoint to the criminal activities being investigated.,1446422400,,355,5.4363636363636365
1811364,5,B00007I6FP,"A a career law enforcement executive, I can tell you that this series is about as authentic of a police show as you will ever see. There are glaring officer safety issues in each episode, but nothing the average viewer would ever pick up on. The acting is exemplary and I watch re-runs on a continual basis. I would give anything to meet Dennis Franz. His ""in your face tactics"" and take no %$#& from anyone, including his bosses, is spectacular!!!

1811727,5,B00007I6FP,"I give the entire NYPD Blue series five stars.

I now have just started re-viewing the series beginning with the first set.  It's terrific to watch.  Keep in mind that the producers had high hopes for Blue, but didn't know how much of a hit (if at all) it would be.  So the introductions are slightly different at first, the cutaways are a continually evolving art form, the music is a bit more strident and some of the character interactions are a bit edgy.

As you get deeper into the series you'll see that the finished product is a finely polished narrative with slice of life situations in every episode.

NYPD Blue is the best cop series ever.",1440979200,,649,4.4576271186440675

1811972,4,B00007I6FP,I like a lot of the show but it tries too hard in season one. In following season the show matured and characters are more comfortable with themselves.

1812495,5,B00007I6FP,"The series takes a little while to get into its groove, but it soon evolves into the series that became - and still is - my favorite drama ever.  In early episodes, the dialogue and characters are a little stiff and forced, and the cinematography is not yet up to its later splendor.  When it first aired, I always finished each episode as if I had really worked for sixty minutes, completely enthralled in the characters, the dialogue, and the story.  I was always disappointed that each episode ended.  And it still captures me in the way, twenty years later.",1431129600,,561,4.58

1812589,5,B00007I6FP,"Loved season 1 of NYPD BLUE because the way it set the stage for the series. I have to be honest, though. I wasn't sorry to see David Caruso leave and Jimmy Smits replace him. Even my 15 year old son, who knows Caruso from CSI has become a megafan of Jimmy Smits. He doesn't know the story of how Bobby Simone leaves the show. I won't tell him. I want to see him cry like I did when I saw it air nearly 20 years now. I wish that whatever differences there were, Smits would have stayed on the show. Dennis Franz was the only constant, not that I'm complaining about that. I miss seeing Franz on the telly every week.",1430265600,,616,4.057377049180328

1812752,5,B00007I6FP,"If it can be said that ""Hill Street Blues"" changed the tone and format of TV cop shows forever with its gritty realism, use of hand-held cameras, outstanding acting and writing, and multi-episode story arcs, then it must also be said that ""NYPD Blue"" became the epitome of that genre. Without question, when ""NYPD Blue"" burst onto the scene in 1993, six years after ""Hill Street Blues"" ended, it continued and refined the gritty and realistic TV police drama, and brought it to new heights.

""NYPD Blue: Season 1"" is a harbinger of great things to come on this show. In the very first scene of the very first episode, when embittered, alcoholic detective Andy Sipowicz publicly grabs his crotch and snarls to a female Assistant District Attorney ""ipsa this,"" and then calls her a profane name, viewers are informed that they are in for something they've never seen in a broadcast TV series before. Later scenes in that same episode signal the advent of a police drama unafraid to show profanity, partial nudity, and greater sexuality. So much so, that when the first episode of ""NYPD Blue"" premiered on ABC  in September 1993, over 200 affiliates refused to air it.

There's really not much I can add to the litany of praise that the first season of this show has received through the years. Its public reception speaks for itself. Every episode features a superbly written story that's taut, tense, grittily realistic, and acted to perfection by series regulars David Caruso, Dennis Franz, James McDaniel, Amy Brenneman, and Sherry Stringfield, and a supporting cast that includes Gordon Clapp, Nicholas Turturro, Gail O'Grady, and others.

This 6-DVD set containing the complete first season of ""NYPD Blue"" was first released in 2008 by 20th Century Fox. Technically, the set is excellent, with top-notch video and audio quality. Episodes are shown in their original 4:3 aspect ratio. Video is clean, crisp, sharp, and imbued with vivid natural colors. Audio is in the original 2-channel stereo format that's also clean and bright.

""NYPD Blue: Season 1"" is the very first TV show I ever bought on DVD.  Since then, I've watched it many times and have always derived tremendous entertainment from it.  Highly recommended.",1428192000,,2223,4.975741239892184

The story starts out as a cop show but ends up being the story of the redemption of Sipowicz. This is my third viewing since it began and I'm enjoying it as much as I did the first 2 times.  This is the reason I signed up for Amazon Prime.  Until recently  you couldn't buy all 12 seasons  so being able to stream the entire series is a plus.,1427328000,,442,3.9101123595505616

I'm a huge Jimmy Smits fan, but Season 1 was the only one w/John Kelly. (he left 4 episodes into Season 2)

I didn't watch it on TV when it was broadcast 1993-2005, but became a fan years later, watching it in back to back reruns late at night/early morning.
I was happy to discover all 12 seasons of NYPD Blue are available on Amazon Prime and that I was able to watch this show again, whenever I want.

Each episode would require nothing more than the great characters they present, the storyline and the interactions between the characters.  My point being, I can remember many of the great actor/actress performances in this series.  Some of them just too powerful to ever forget.  But, until I watched it again, I had completely forgotten about the ""rated R"" stuff.

This is a show where the good guys do not always win, just like real life.  In my view, the Blueblood series could take a lesson from this show even though some of the Blueblood stories already show a high degree of plagiarism.",1419897600,,656,4.918181818181818

1813765,5,B00007I6FP,"NYPD Blue was the best hour-long drama ever broadcast on commercial television.  Ever.  Period.  This goes for the first season and all the rest right to the end.

The first season differs from all the others in several important respects.  The most important of these is that Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) is not the main character -- that role falls to the somewhat more cardboard and unrealistically perfect Detective John Kelly (David Caruso), They had not yet developed the characters and thrashed about at first a bit, but not for long and they kept it entertaining even while feeling their way.  The incidental music is a bit different too -- choppier, thinner, and a tad less intriguing than it became as the series matured.

The relationship between Andy and Sylvia (the always interesting and unusually gracefully-aging Sharon Lawrence) slowly progresses from enmity to affection.  And the relationship between Medavoy (stammering Gordon Clapp) and Donna Abandondo (the painfully beautiful Gail O'Grady) is absolutely hilarious.

This season hit most of the notes this series continued to hit -- beautifully developed characters dealing with serious matters, both personal and professional, interspersed with liberal doses of comic relief.  It is a formula that makes ""NYPD Blue"" very easy to watch, and it captures the interest even through endless repeats.",1418342400,,1367,5.316279069767442

1814023,5,B00007I6FP,"I never watched this show when it was broadcast on network TV, which has become a very good thing. I just finished watching ""The Wire"" and ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" and I was eager for more of the same. I gave this a try, in spite of my reservations about David Caruso, since I was not fond of him as the lead in ""CSI:Miami."" On the other hand, I always liked Dennis Franz on ""Hill Street Blues""

You are all familiar with the fact that there is a lot of profanity and nudity. That did not affect my decision in either direction, but it did tend to increase the sense of reality. I believed how these cops acted, which I cannot say about most other cop shows, especially the CSI franchise.

As I watched the first few episodes, I was dismayed at the characterization of Detective Sipowicz by by Dennis Franz, and the screenwriters. Usually, a character begins a series on an even keel, and story arcs may drop the character into a hole from which they must either work themselves out of, or drop from the series Sipowicz was starting at the bottom of the hole.

But, and this is the good part, by the middle of the season, Sipowicz is back on an even keel, and we see him as the good cop he is and was for most of his career. I feel a bit shortchanged by the fact that aside from Kelly and Sipowicz (Caruso and Franz) none of the regular characters are tremendously interesting, although several guest stars, such as Peter Boyle and Bradley Whitford (I'm a Bradley Whitford fan. Go figure.) add a lot of interest.

This is one of the weaknesses of ""Law and Order Criminal Intent"" until they brought Chris Noth in to alternate with Vincent D'Onofrio. Unlike ""Criminal Intent"", NYPD Blue is far less cerebral, but it's made up by the fact that the characters are more real. The answer to my question of whether I will buy additional seasons is ""Absolutely"".",1416009600,,1860,4.4298245614035086

1814199,5,B00007I6FP,"NYPD Blue is an outstanding TV drama. For some reason, we only rarely watched it during its original run, so are very glad to find it on Amazon Instant Video. We are about 12 episodes into Season 1, and are getting to know the characters. One of the things we enjoy most is that even though there are a lot of characters, the writers find a way to get them all involved so you learn to understand and appreciate them all. Sipowitz is especially great as the hard guy with a soft heart. The relationships between the characters really makes this program click - these are cops, but they are real people with real problems too, and that's what sets NYPD Blue apart from so many shallow, bang-bang cop shows. We plan to work our way thru all the seasons and savor every episode for the great program this is.",1415059200,,805,4.373333333333333

It's hard to make a show awesome for 3 or 4 years but they did it for 12 years & really only ever made about 4 or 5 bad episodes (I say bad just to mean it didn't live up to the NYPD Blue standard I'd still pick them over a show like CSI Miami).",1412812800,,397,3.6470588235294117

The excellent writing sends this show head and shoulders above all the other police/action shows that came before it (although I will always love The Rockford Files).  I appreciate the fact that the ""good guys"" are allowed to have character flaws while the ""bad guys"" demonstrate occasional moments of dignity and humanity.  Dennis Franz is a phenomenally good actor who plays a seriously flawed character.  We watch him struggle to regain control of his wasted life, work to repair his damaged relationships, and slowly learn to build new ones.  In the season premiere, he may seem devoid of redeeming qualities, but by the third episode, you - and he - will begin to discover them.",1410480000,,922,4.916129032258064

I am seeing some episodes that I missed or don't remember, but it is good enough to watch them all, which I am doing. There is some nudity which would not, in my opinion make it suitable for younger children.

In is day, NYPD Blues was a suspenseful weekly cops soap opera.  Every week the network played another episode.  The beauty of instant prime is the individual control to determine how many to watch and when!  Having watched about half the episodes of season 1, it is good to report that thus far NYPD Blue has retained it's edge, in the wake of newer cop shows, and the high-tech shows like NCIS, CSI, and  whatever is yet to roll out this season on TV.",1407888000,,596,4.5233644859813085

It's fun to watch a show that's set in the not too distant past where the detectives and lawyers don't have cell phones yet (Law & Order started out that way, too).  The grunt work the detectives have to work through, the display of gut instinct seems appropriate, and this show is ""gritty"".

Forget the Law & Order concept of a DA interviewing a suspect in the presence of his lawyer - never happens. These vignettes show the emotions and understandable reactions of the men/women who ride around @ 3am when we're snoring away.  Loved the series when it first aired and appreciate it again even more. If you want to get an accurate feel of what cops do on a daily basis, not just relying on news reports and complaints, experience this series. It's worth your time.",1404086400,,622,4.654545454545454

1815102,4,B00007I6FP,"This tv series was one of the most well crafted television police shows in history.
Dennis Franz and the squad were outstanding in their roles they played.
A very well written program. One of the main things about this tv police series,
is that it showed that the cops are real people, and deal with real human issues in their
daily lives, as well as coping (or not coping so well) with all the terrible realities of life out in
the world. The show demonstrated only too well that there really are ""good guys and bad guys"",
both on the police force and out in with the lives of the public.
It was great in it's ability to bring up strong emotional feelings with the audience. Sometimes one
find oneself sad and ""crying"" one moment and laughing the next. Anyway I thank Amazon Prime for
having this great series on, as I love to revisit my old friends that I loved (and some i loved to hate,
like the IAD chief who gave Officer Likalsi such a terrible time,and threw her under the bus)
Yes, this does bring back wonderful memories, thank you!!",1403913600,,1042,4.404145077720207

After 21 years, the influence of the show is obvious and interesting, but I do not watch a series for that. I watch for the characters, the writings the acting. My advantage is knowing where the entire arc is headed. I know that in essence the show is the analysis of Andy Sispowicz, a deeply flawed alcoholic who wishes he could see a different path and who has a passion for justice deep in his heart.

I'm so glad this show is on Amazon Prime Instant Video as now I can finally watch all the seasons of this fabulous show. It's fun to see some of the stars we know today in their earlier years. It was groundbreaking then, although we seem to have gone a bit backwards since then, to see so much man butt. It's always part of the story line and doesn't seem gratuitous. It's never made sense to me why nudity scenes almost always show only the women; sexist much? Everyone seems so uptight about the human body and OK with so much graphic violence.

1815473,5,B00007I6FP,"I love cop dramas, and this series is one of, if not the best series of all time in the genre.  If you like gritty character driven drama this is an excellent series.  The first season sets the tone and pace for this series where each show has enough connection to develop bigger stories, but interlaced within each episode are individual story lines that add soo much to the series.

What makes this series(and season) so good is that it excels in what matters most in a tv drama:  plot and characters

1.  The Plot:  Very creative and interesting.  They do have a plot line involving the mob that is pretty important in the season, which is done well, but the mob has been done so many different ways I felt that this was a little old hat.  Don't get me wrong it's very well done and doesn't detract from the series, it's just not very innovative.

The stories of the cops private lives is also very well done and interesting.

2.  The Characters.  For me the actors and characters of the show pushed this NYPD Blue over the edge from just being a good show to being a GREAT show.  They are ALL excellent!  Some of the lesser roles that were in this season were filled by actors who would go on to play leads in some outstanding TV Shows in the future like:  Friends, The WestWing, Judging Amy, just to name a few.

The two actors that shine brighter than the others though are:  Dennis Franz as Andy Sipowicz and David Caruso as John Kelly.

This was the only full season that John Kelly is a character, and he is great.  He is that calm and collected officer that everyone wants to be around that can take care of any situation both personal or public.  He's the guy that men watching the show usually would see themselves as, or at least wish they were.

Andy Sipowicz on the other hand is the main lead through the whole series, and is one of my favorite characters of all time.  He's that flawed hero that you root for.  Defintely not your typical handsome lead, but follows the line of other great characters in TV history like Hawkeye Pierce, that you love to watch.

This season was outstanding, especially the story line of the lost girl that found it's climax in the last episode of the season.

**I should mention that this show was very controversial at the time of it's release because of the adult language and skin bearing scenes.  This season came out in like 1993-4.  Watching it 20 years later I found these parts still very racy.  I think if the show was released today it would still be very controversial.",1398643200,,2528,4.399568034557236
1815492,5,B00007I6FP,We used to watch this show when it was first on. Glad that is is on Prime. This another one of the shows that I am binge watching.,1398643200,,130,3.6785714285714284
1815493,5,B00007I6FP,This show is a CLASSIC. It's hard to believe it went on the air twenty years ago. The writing and production values don't sound or look dated at all.,1398556800,,149,4.172413793103448

1815495,5,B00007I6FP,"The cast and plots overwhelm the senses.

1815496,5,B00007I6FP,"This is a great action filled series even though Sipowicz may have spent more time with IA for some of his tactics.  I almost lost my badge because of alcohol, but my watch commander got me into rehab and I can relate to his problems with alcohol.

1815501,4,B00007I6FP,Season One  lays the foundation for one of the best if not the best police dramas of all time...Edgy and ground breaking for its time; NYPD Blue balances gripping drama with humor and candid focus on the flawed and redeeming side of police drama.

Dennis Franz plays a great part, David Caruso was great too.  Too bad he did not stick it out.  You can see in the start of season 2 that Kelly has changed, not a happy person.

I just started watching it so my review is incomplete it what I've seen so far makes me wanna call outta work & make a marathon outta it. The stories are original & demonstrate the moral struggle in police work, whether to do it straight up or veer off the heroic path. I can already tell it's gonna be a monumental show, mainly because of the actors (some of which were on one of my other favorites E.R.) particularly Caruso & his chubby bull of a partner who freakin cracks me up, Denis Franz. They're in sync to the point of making it seem like they've been on the job together forever. Other highlights are that sometimes cheesy but great 90's music & the bare booties that caused a raucous back when the show premiered which is how I originally heard about it. I highly recommend it!",1396310400,,945,4.2555555555555555

They really help you understand the detectives of the 15th squad and why they are what they are.

They aren't cute, they aren't hip...they are NYC detectives solving ugly crimes and often dealing with the scum of the streets. Yet, the stories also bring in a lot of characters who are trapped by circumstance, engaging in their own ways.

It remains on many lists of greatest TV shows of all time, and many of its episodes are listed in TV Guides top 100 TV episodes of all time. The series ran for 12 seasons. The first 8 seasons it was always among the top rated TV shows. Then starting in 2001 season 9 was aired in a different time slot, which hurt its rating. But even in those last 4 seasons it continued to have better than average ratings, and to this day remains a much beloved favorite.

1815779,5,B00007I6FP,"I watched NYPD blue when it first came on the air after reading about it in the Sunday paper on how controversial it would be with rougher language and more aggressive acting than other shows before its time. I was a faithful watcher and watched every episode of the entire run. I think I can say this is the only series where I have done this. Season 1 is jammed packed with action, back stories and great acting all around. Several police families that I knew described it as ""very accurate"" when it came to how the detectives handle the cases in front of them.

David Caruso as John Kelly and Dennis Franz as Andy Sipowicz are the BEST detective duo EVER. They feed off each other and as this season 1 progresses you can see how they care for each other and have each other's backs. It is a shame that David Caruso left the show so early because I could have imagined several emmys for him with his performance. The writing and story lines for this show have always been good and it is interesting to watch it now after all of these years and see some actors who have moved into starring roles on other programs.

1815861,5,B00007I6FP,"NYPD is probably among the top ten must see TV series of the past thirty years.  The acting is superb and the cases the detectives handle, although old, are still timely.  If you can get past the first few seasons where they are still using pagers and later walkie talkies, you will find a gem of a show.

1815905,5,B00007I6FP,"One of the best crime show series on TV. Fine acting--nuanced performances by entire cast, especially Dennis Franz--coupled with great writing and directing.

1815906,5,B00007I6FP,"Following on the grit and wit of Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue took the cop genre many, many steps further.  Great characterizations, great threads through the first season about morality and personal foibles.  Without NYPD Blue you don't get to The Wire, The Sopranos, etc., because that show revealed what audiences really want, especially from what is effectively a long form television novel presentation.  So, yep, 5 stars.  Hell, 10 stars.  (Oh, and by the way, David Caruso was brilliant in it; what a putz he was for walking away from the best role he could have ever hoped for.)",1390953600,,586,4.82

1815970,5,B00007I6FP,"I found myself completely surprised by how much I liked this series after only about 3 episodes. David Caruso was awesome and I was sorry to see him go, but Jimmy Smits is an excellent replacement. I am now in season 2 and I feel that there is a lot about this show that was used as a model for one of my other favorite shows, The Shield. I would not be surprised if Shawn Ryan wasn't a fan of NYPD Blue prior to creating The Shield. Even the colors of ""The Barn"" are drab and shabby and almost identical to the interior colors of the set of NYPD Blue, and even right down to the ""cage"" that both shows used to hold prisoners. Although different, a lot is similar. I am in it for the duration and will be watching all 12 seasons of this incredibly well written show.

1816009,5,B00007I6FP,"Season 1 of Blue is essential for getting to know one of the most iconic characters in television history, Andy Sipowicz. I ha started to watch NYPD Blue shortly after Jimmy Smits joined the cast. I came to see it as one of the best TV series ever produced. I watched it from then on until the last episode. It wasn't until I went back & watched season 1 that I came to have a real appreciation for just how far Andy had come along. He went from a cop you would be afraid of, to THE cop you would want to have handle the case if you or a loved one were ever the victim of a crime. Dennis Franz showed himself to be the great actor he is taking that character from a drunk who was ready to lose his job to the leader of the squad. He lost his son, his wife & his first real friend & Dennis Franz made you feel every bit of what his character went through. It's sad that no one in Hollywood has been able to consistently write a character that does his talent justice, since the series ended. If you want to come to see great acting & the great handling of a character, you need to watch NYPD Blue from the first episode to the last. Dennis, we miss seeing you every week.",1390521600,,1170,4.004273504273504

1816070,5,B00007I6FP,"I remember catching this show on TNT growing up and liking it, but never continued to watch it. I started watching it recently and I have one word to describe it and that is amazing. This show is so well written and acted with a great blend of comedy, action and drama that works so well. I am a fan of Hill Street Blues as well so I see many similarities and familiar faces which makes the show even more enjoyable to watch. One of the great things about this show is that the cops are not necessarily the good ones, they can be scene violating people's rights and leading witnesses and criminals in their confessions to help them when they end up in court which is completely unethical, but the writers help us sympathize with these characters even if they are doing things that against the law or unethical. Dennis Franz is amazing in this show and nearly every time he is on screen, you don't know what to expect whether he is going to say something rude, racist or funny.",1389830400,,976,4.368131868131868

After rewatching the first episode, I realized something: They don't make 'em like this any more! The cast is fabulous, especially Dennis Franz as Sipowicz. The dialogue is gritty and real. As much as current cop dramas are allowed to use words that were once banned, NYPD broke ground with creative language and even use of the N-word when the plot justified it. Hard to watch sometimes, but the fast-moving plot combined with the background music and quick edits keep you watching. It's also fun to recognize bit players who have become stars (Anna Gunn from Breaking Bad, for example). The only caveat I give is that once you start watching be prepared to spend all your free time glued to your tv, kindle, whatever you have. I am up to season 1, episode 18, and can't wait to get back to the 15th Precinct!",1389830400,,950,4.4655172413793105

The development of Dennis Franz's character over the course of the first season has been the real key to the show in my opinion. The writers have made him into the most important character simply because we care about him and are cheering for him to continue to change his life!

Overall really really good show and better than 95% of any cop shows that are on television now.",1389139200,,668,4.21875

1816281,4,B00007I6FP,"My wife and I like to watch this series and are glad to see we can continue watching this for many more episodes to come.  The one thing that we dislike about the episodes is the of sexual encounters where too much skin is shown.  Fortunately there is not a lot of this type of exposure and so we are able to continue to watch this series.

I cannot give this series a 5 star as there are negative points. The show is entertaining and builds the characters to where you can see the chemistry between people and relationships. The main character is not perfect, he has his own human charismatic weakness however he is a good cop with good intentions and looks out for his associated friendly relationships, sticking up for other policemen or policewoman, encouraging proper ways of life, though he has some of his own short comings which he is working out as well.

Overall this is a good show to watch.  Though it may be something for a more mature audience.  Not necessarily something I would recommend for family with young kids. The violence seems to be real life type events and is not too excessive however, it is still present. There are a lot of worldly exposures presented as only can be expected as this is a cop show. The struggles each character experiences seems to be realistic.

We have just finished season 1 and are now continuing to season 2 and hope to watch all of the NYPD Blue seasons and then will need to find another good show to watch. If the seasons become too violent or too much sexual exposure then we will discontinue our watching of the series.  At this point we are able to endure the brief exposures.",1387584000,,1633,4.456375838926174

1816379,5,B00007I6FP,I may have aged but this show has stood the test of time.  Great scripts; fine acting and it's a real kick to see so many of today's eell-known actors in their beginning roles.,1379548800,,176,4.176470588235294
1816380,5,B00007I6FP,"Still a great series of human struggles and joys, which are as applicable today as they were in the 80's.",1379548800,,105,4.3
1816381,5,B00007I6FP,Love this show!! The actors are truly talented and I will watch the entire series!  Dennis Franz is hysterical and compelling at once!,1379462400,,134,4.826086956521739

1816383,4,B00007I6FP,I thought it was a very good season overall.  No boring episodes.  Each one tied to others just enough to keep you interested in the big picture.  Enjoyable viewing if you like cop shows.,1379116800,,187,4.4411764705882355

1816385,5,B00007I6FP,This program still holds up after decades of originally being aired. Not a weak episode with network TV groundbreaking nudity and language. Dennis Franz is absolutely one of the best and strongest characters right there with Tony Soprano that has been on a series. I never liked David Caruso (Howdy Doody look alike) as he is the same in EVERY episode with zero depth and few acting abilities. Glad he was replaced after his big flop movie career ended after his 1st film. Jimmy Smits replaced DC and was a huge asset to the cast and scripts .Kim Delaney was excellent as Diane Russell and became an item with Smits in the 2nd season. Its great now to be able to watch all the episodes right straight through without those annoying commercials. The only way you can watch network TV nowadays is to DVR it and streak through useless commercials . Does anyone really ever pay attention to commercials other than the companies advertising? All in all make it an NYPD Blue marathon its so worth it!,1378857600,,994,4.621468926553672

1816416,5,B00007I6FP,"Ground breaking series when it was on TV in the 90's and now I remember why. The characters draw you in from the start of the pilot episode and you can't wait to see the next one. Gritty and socially relevant story lines, as well as characters who seem like real people.

To make matters even worse I now have Amazon Video and just finished watching it again. Touch to David Caruso for starting it with Dennis Franz. Than there was Jimmy Smitts, James McDaniels, Gordon Klapp, Kim Delaney and a whole lot more.

(I found him unbearable in CSI Miami.)  It's amusing to spot all the practices (smoking in restaurants, etc.) that are now verboten.

I really enjoyed rewatching the first season over the course of a few days and nights. I'm so glad Amazon provides this outlet to watch these programs from my young adult years. I'll get to season 2 eventually. I enjoyed David Caruso's performance, but his character got on my nerves as he took so many risks to help others.

1816458,5,B00007I6FP,Season 1 has to be the best.  The characters Kelly & Sipowitz were developed flawlessly.  Being a retired NYPD Detective I have to say this is the closest portral of working in a squad room minus the levity and the fact cases are solved in one episode.  Simply loved it!,1375315200,,270,4.36
1816459,5,B00007I6FP,Was far ahead of it's time and thus is still relevant and up to date. Acting and writing are superb especially after Caruso left early in second season.

1816491,5,B00007I6FP,"This may not be the right place but I do have an Amazon. Prime question.
Please pass this on to the proper group...

NYPD Blue streams perfectly every time and it is has never buffered at the client side.
However, a couple movies I have viewed have many buffering interruptions.

Why does Prime stream fail on movies but not TV shows [In my experience anyway]?
My guess is that other customers are also watching the movie [and not the 20 year old TV show] and I am competing with your server for stream slices!

FYI: One movie I quit watching on Sunday afternoon because of the bothersome interrupts. I then watched the remainder of the movie after midnight with no streaming interrupts at all.

If this problem is caused by my equipment OR my ISP, then please tell me how to correct the problem.

If the problem is on your side, e.g. lack of Server bandwidth, are you going to fix it soon?

He tolerates no bigotry, yet he is a bigot himself.  Perhaps I am a bit biased myself, since I love all the characters Dennis Franz plays, but Sipowicz is his signature role.

You will never finish an episode with a bad taste in your mouth. This show is like meat and potatoes, well-seasoned, next to every other police procedural that is a ham sandwich on stale bread.
I also like the show's utter lack of concern for filling the screen with increasingly attractive actors. If you watch long enough, I'm pretty sure you catch a glimpse of Dennis Franz' ass. The drama is so good that even that isn't offensive.",1368576000,,583,4.669902912621359

The handling of transitions as characters departed and joined the shows was, for the most part, masterful.  In the last couple of seasons, continuity was not quite as smooth as it had been in the past, but the crime stories and the personal drama remained strong.  If you ever needed to see what is so wonderful about home video, the opportunity to watch a series like this in big stretches shows it.",1366070400,,762,4.8307692307692305
1816681,5,B00007I6FP,Love this series when new and still better than anything on now except Vegas & Homeland.  Still sorry Caruso left the series.  He may have done well for himself on CSI but the part on NYPD was made for him and was a far better series.  Of course Dennis Franz & Jimmy Smits do a great job of bringing their characters to live & keep the series great for many years.,1365984000,,364,4.098591549295775

As for the show itself the rapid speed of the action and the attention to detail was no less fantastic from the emotional intertwining to the gritty language that our favorite character(s) used it always seemed that an hour just wasn't enough to stuff this New York biopic into....kudos to Stephen Boccho for another job well done.....as for his next project ""Deadwood""...well that too goes into the T.V. history books too...........LOL",1365206400,,802,4.992537313432836

1816744,5,B00007I6FP,"Andy Sipowitz still remains uniquely qualified as a powerful force on TVs NYPD Blue's 12-year seasons.  1993 thru 2005 was impressive years as quality television is rated because of the presence of NYPD Blue.  Steven Bochco & David Milch were the driving factors.  Understandably the NYPD Blue set was not the most pleasant of working enviornments, The Sipowitz character, Dennis Franz, had the strength of character personally to endure the difficulties on the set and the ability to create one of TV's strongest characters. ---  John Kelly's character was the high mark for any character acting in TV or movies during the first season of NYPD Blue.  David Caruso allowed the audience during 1993-1994 to experience the best police dramas here-to-date.  Unfortunatedly, Caruso couldn't suffer the NYPD Blue task to continue such steller 22-episodes each season.  Jimmy Smitts as Bobby Simone not only took over Caruso's character, he devoured it in Season 2, Eposide 5.  Simone was interesting in LA Law but his age, education and the writing and direction on NYPD Blue, gave Smitts his ultimate performances with the uniquely qualified Dennis Franz.  NYPD Blue continues to give fans constant fascination and awe with every episode.  The enjoyment of the 12 seasons of NYPD Blue are ones to re-watch periodically when the NYPD Blue desire hits.  Streaming the 12 seasons on Amazon is a real thrill !",1363737600,,1401,5.100877192982456

what I remember most is that they would show it late, 10:00 on the west coast. and had warnings that this was an ADULT drama.
and man was it ever. but it really wasn't all that racy.
but it did cause controversy.
scene a shower det. Andy is starting to wash. a woman steps in the tub...
Andy "" what are you doing?""
Silvia ""I thought I'd shower too,save water""
Andy "" I usually was my self....down there...boy...that's sure gonna be clean""

The two of them working as a team of detectives is very dramatic, gripping, sad, sometimes humorous and always entertaining to watch. Their humanity really comes through . The supporting actors and characters are also excellent and often very engaging. I lost interest in the show after David Caruso left to pursue a movie career (which never panned out for him) after the 4th episode in the second season.

1816862,4,B00007I6FP,"""NYPD Blue"" was probably the most realistic portrayal of the New York City Police Department since.....""Barney Miller"" (and that's not a joke!).  The subtleties of the Squad Room and on the streets are left that way...""subtle""....even within the show, leaving it up to the viewer to catch them (much like real life).

The one drawback of Season 1 for me was, unfortunately, David Caruso's ""Det. John Kelly"" overplaying his predictable part as the laid-back cop playing off the the more ""outgoing"" Andy Sipowitz (Dennis Franz).  Caruso only lasted the one season, more or less (I believe at his own request), and the part of Andy's partner was then magnificently played by a true New Yorker, Jimmy Smits, who moved the part into an easily believable portrayal, including his own New York ""subtleties.""

Some (much?) credit should be given to Gordon Clapp for his performance as the somewhat less-than-self-confident ""Detective Greg Medavoy"" who, despite that, rises to the mandates of the police situations presented to him, to the point where Sipowitz in a later episode calls Medavoy a ""good cop,"" a true compliment coming from a seasoned officer.  Nice job Gordon.

While certainly not a ""to be continued"" type of show, keep in mind that many of the episodes' story lines (but not all) are continued or referred to in the next episodes (much like real police work), and if you purchase a full season you'll find yourself not watching only one episode, but the next one following. And the one after that.  It can get addictive...!

1816888,5,B00007I6FP,"I thought this show was good all the way through to its last season, but I don't know if it ever got quite as good as the beginning. David Caruso might have seen himself as the lead, and he was good, but Dennis Franz stole the show right from the start. His performances in the first few episodes are nothing short of top-notch, world-class displays of acting talent. He exhibits every emotion known to man as he struggles with his vices, loses his job, gets shot several times, and attempts to recover both personally and professionally. Franz lets the audience know from Episode 1 that he's out to create a truly memorable character, and he succeeded fantastically.

Caruso is certainly a highlight, playing the dark, quiet, tough cop, a foil to Franz's loudmouth Andy Sipowicz. The two had great chemistry, and it's a shame they didn't get a chance to do more seasons together. Other important characters introduced in Season 1 are Greg Medavoy, James Martinez, Donna Abondando, and Arthur Fancy, all of whom remained for multiple seasons. Fringe characters include Mike Roberts, who returned from time to time in subsequent seasons; John Kelly's wife Laura, who left before the end of the season, and his obsession, Janice Lecalsi, who appeared in a few episodes with him at the beginning of Season 2; Adrian Lesniak, who eventually developed a short-lived romance with Martinez; and Vince Gotelli, a gruff, older night duty detective who's good for some comic relief.

To say that this first season was action-packed would be an understatement. The show's intense violence, language, and sexuality pushed the boundaries of network TV, delivering graphic content nearly comparable to that of HBO. But it wasn't just because sex and violence sell; the show portrayed a gritty realism that would've been compromised and watered down by a more conservative approach. It's a travesty that only the first four seasons have been released on DVD, as the series ran for twelve. Thankfully, Amazon has made the rest of the seasons availabe on instant video so we can at least see the rest of the series, but I still hope that fans of NYPD Blue will someday get our wish and see the show's remaining eight years on DVD.

1816892,5,B00007I6FP,"It's funny to think that at one time NYPD Blue was considered too lewd and sexual, but it was. It broke television boundaries and became one of the best police drama shows of all time. While it definitely went on longer than it should have, the first few seasons (especially the first) made up some of the best television shows of all-time.

Season one was the only full season that Detective John Kelly (David Caruso) was in, and the show was never quite the same to me after that. Detective Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits) was probably the best possible replacement for Andy's partner, but no one could ever quite replace John Kelly. Thanks to the terrific job David Caruso did as playing the intriguing and complex John Kelly, season one is definitely the best out of the series.

What also makes season one (along with the first three seasons to a degree) stand out is the grittiness and how real the characters are. Starting around the fourth season we start to get more cliche, boring characters who you'd never really see in the NYPD. Lots of supermodely type girls (come on, are we supposed to believe EVERY girl cop in the NYPD is drop dead gorgeous?) and unnecessary love drama. Andy starts messing with and marrying every girl in sight, and everyone in the office is hooking up. In the first couple seasons I feel like I'm seeing real relationships at work. Tragic love and true passion, it's corny at times, but at least it feels right.

Each episode seems to advance one long term story, plus tackling one major and also a minor self-contained story. There is the inevitable love interest, but it never gets tacky like in 'Grey's Anatomy.'

Although the show depicts New York in the 1990s, the whole show is in no danger of feeling outdated. Crisp writing, thoughtful plots and some very neat camera work keep the action rolling and the characters totally plausible.

1816990,5,B00007I6FP,"Although it seems tame compared to the show's currently on television (most notably ""The Shield""), ""NYPD Blue"" was groundbreaking back when it premiered in 1993. It was one of the first television shows to truly push the envelope, featuring nudity, violence, and language that you thought you'd never hear on network television at the time. So much so, that it wasn't even broadcast on the ABC affiliate in Dallas during that first season.

The first season contains some quality television moments. I found the pilot disappointing - it's dull prime time fare meant primarily to shock the viewer. However, the second episode will draw you in. Sipowicz, after being shot by a mobster, lies in the hospital while his partner, Detective John Kelly (David Caruso) and other precinct characters, seek revenge. The internal affairs stuff becomes more relevant, as does Sipowicz's nasty drinking habit, his disastrous personal life and his racist tendencies. Kelly is more of a kinder cop, standing behind his partner even with his bad habits, and Caruso plays it with such debonair coolness in contrast to Franz's gruff Sipowicz that he attracted movie offers quickly and left after the first four episodes of the second season. Unfortunately, people remember more about how Caruso's career went downhill after he left the show than just how good he was at playing Kelly.

Remember that besides the shock value, season one of NYPD Blue is depicting a pre-Giuliani New York City - one in which people carry spare watches and extra cash so that when they inevitably get mugged they have something to give the robber and don't get pistol whipped. This inevitable sense of victimhood is personified in ""4B"" (David Schwimmer), a guy who is mugged in the laundry room of his own apartment building, starts carrying a gun, and is eventually killed while trying to defend himself against a subsequent attack. There's also the budding ""Beauty and the Beast"" romance between Sipowicz and ADA Sylvia Costas which begins Sipowicz' transformation into a good and admirable person. Then there is the season-long epic of officer Janice Licalsi (Amy Brenneman) who kills a mobster who in turn wanted her to kill John Kelly and was threatening to reveal her late father's corrupt past as a police officer as leverage. Licalsi has apparently gotten away with a crime that seems somewhat justifiable, but her conscience just won't let the deed rest.

Overall, I would say that this was one of the better seasons of NYPD Blue. The characters were much more interesting than they were in later seasons and the stories were pretty good, although I was somewhat bored by the internal affairs material. The season holds up over time, but the shock value really doesn't, and in some cases actually does damage to character development. For example, there is really no reason for that last scene of the last episode of the season between John Kelly and Robin, the widow of John's rich friend who has recently died of cancer. In fact, subtract the shock value, and it makes Kelly look like a real jerk - Licalsi is facing prison for saving John's life and his first act after her confession and arrest is to be with another woman? In spite of it all, I would still recommend the DVD set since this first season really is very unique among the twelve season run and is a must for any true fan of the show.",1162598400,7,3371,4.8591304347826085

I know Sept. 11th was a huge tragedy, but is seems rediculous to leave this out of a show that was taped almost ten years ago. The clothes and cars are also from 1993 right? This is the only ""complaint"" about this all. For the rest? It's worth every penny!",1155859200,4,749,4.0675675675675675
1816993,5,B00007I6FP,"I rarely give out 5 stars in my reviews, but I'm giving one out for this one!  Phenomal writing, poignant on screen acting, personal story lines that made you care about the characters, and salty language and sexual situations all made for excellent, sometimes shocking, normally Networked Cesored scenes.  And that's magic in my book!

Before ""The Wire,"" before ""The Shield,""  even before Hill Street Blues (okay, scratch that last one, sorry...), there was NYPD Blue, and this was the show that started it all!  Dennis Franz has ALWAYS been one of my favorite characters and has been featured in several Brian De Palma flicks, starring in smaller minor roles.  A saint of an actor, and one of the nicest men you'll ever meet, but a hell of an actor.  He makes you believe he is the worst cop on planet earth, (well next to the Chiklis character in The Shield.)

David Caruso, also a fine actor, but a bit overrated in my opionion rounded out the cast.  I have high respect for the actors who carry on, and don't quit early, and that means I respect Dennis Franz more than David, but that doesn't take away from my great respect for his acting skills.

Not much more to add, that hasn't been already said.  Please also see my reviews for other seasons of NYPD Blue.  They may start to get more negative, as this was clearly the A #1 best season of the bunch!

1816994,5,B00007I6FP,"One of the best cop shows in history of television. This show ranks right up there with the Law & Order franchise. What made this show really great was the way the characters were realistically portrayed. They weren't the usual squeaky clean characters we see from CSI, Bones or Crossing Jordan. In NYPD Blue we emphatize with the squad when we see the frustration in the faces and even in the gestures of the Detectives when a perp is giving them the run around or a when an incompetent squad sergeant is appointed ( Eddie Gibson )or when a fellow detective screws up a case. This was the strength of the show the ability to draw empathy from the audience. I read here Season 4 is slated for a June release.

1817006,5,B00007I6FP,"NYPD Blue was a groundbreaking drama that aired on ABC from 1993 to 2005. The acting was first-rate, especially by David Caruso, Dennis Franz, and Amy Brenneman. David Milch and Steven Bochco created a series that was for adults and, yes, it did include adult language and partial nudity. The characters were three-dimensional and complex, not cardboard, as the last reviewer stated. The ratings (not ""rateings"") were excellent for the pilot episode, and they continued to stay strong throughout season one. Many intelligent people were fans of this series, and to call anyone who watched the series ""stupid"" simply shows how limited the previous reviewer's intelligence really is. NYPD Blue was a quality drama series, not junk. Maybe the previous reviewer should review a DVD on how to spell correctly instead of an excellent police drama.",1136160000,11,841,5.1911764705882355
1817007,5,B00007I6FP,"For years my Tuesday nights revolved around this show.  Then, sometime around the time they got yet another pair of gorgeous, yet totally colorless, female detectives, and yet another ""Loo"" and the show became totally a police procedual (I have to think budgetary cuts had to make dispensible anything outside the station house and  exteriors filmed on an already established studio backlot), I gave up on it, and switched to the now supremely edgier and better written (and acted and directed) The Shield.  That said, there were those years were the cooler talk at my place of work revolved around NYPD Blue, and it was never better than in its first, groundbreaking season.  Forget the hype about the nudity and language: what made this show so great was its portrayal of complicated, fallible people--truth be told, men--doing a immensely difficult job.  Kelly and Sipowicz were such compelling figures because they were basically decent men in a world where decency didn't necessarily solve the cases they had to deal with.  Who could forget Kelly telling then young detective Martinez how far he would violate a suspect's rights to get a confession.  It was brilliant drama, as we find ourselves confronting our own ambivilence about civil rights when they come to criminals.  And who could forget that moment when a grieving couple whose son has been murdered look at a pigeon on a rooftop and speak of how that's the little boy's spirit come back to them. And Andy Sipowicz--angry, drunken, violent, racist Andy--saying that he could see the light around the pigeon and yes, it had to be the boy come back.  Television didn't, and doesn't, get better than this.  We all know that NYPD Blue should have ended years before it did (although that would have denied us the opportunity to see a great actor like Dennis Franz at work), but for this first season, and at least two more seasons, there was no better acted, written, directed drama on television.  This is a box set worth having.",1133654400,28,1992,4.863905325443787
1817008,5,B00007I6FP,"The first season of this ground-breaking TV series gave the viewing public something they had never seen before - real people doing their job, as policemen. The characters were flawed, human, realistic, and written so brilliantly they jumped out of the screen at you. Denis Franz is simply superb, David Caruso brilliant, and the supporting cast, peerless.

  It makes compelling viewing seeing the two leads evolve and react to one another. The relationship onscreen is all the more brilliant when we remember how in real life the two men did not hit it off ( in truth Caruso had a touch of the prima donnas, and made everyone's life hell on set, ultimately leading, it has been said, to the heart attack of one of the show's creators. Read the book to find out more if you're intriqued by that. )

Simply one of the best shows ever, and shame shame shame on the powers that be who seem to have chickened out of supplying more than the first two series!",1122854400,7,954,4.56140350877193
1817009,5,B00007I6FP,"Now that this series has run to its conclusion, one can look back on it and analyze what we have seen with much more clarity. Does it rank up there with the best police television series of all time? Did it change considerably during the course of its run? Can we honestly say that it will stand the test of time?

There were other police series before and there will be others after...one of the best examples of this would be Hill Street Blues, in which Dennis Franz also had a role, which was ground breaking in its day but doesn't really stand the test of time now.

One could argue with Blue that it stands up more because it was still running original episodes until 2005. That, however, doesn't explain the first season of the series, filmed in 1993-94 and how, even today, it comes across as fresh as it did then.

Funny thing, though, it is the latter episodes that probably won't stand up...when the show became less about grit and the characters and more about the catch em and intimidate them in the interview room...in other words, it became more predictable. Not bad...just predictable.

In season one we're treated to the dark, below the surface leadership of Detective John Kelly, as portrayed by David Caruso. To imagine and think of what direction the show would have taken had Caruso stayed past episode four of season two would be pure conjecture. Here, though, it is apparent that this is his show. Dennis Franz makes a capable second lead, showing us much of what was to come, but it's Caruso's below the surface darkness that resonates in these shows.

The cast would change considerably in season two, but they were letter perfect in season one. I thought Amy Brennerman as Officer Janice Licalsi stood out more than some people gave her credit for. In the first three episodes alone, she goes to bed with Kelly, is told to kill him, kills the people who ordered her to kill Kelly and loses her father, who commits suicide. She would eventually be blackmailed by the mob and arrested for murder.

Franz as Sipowicz shows many of the traits we will become familiar with during the seasons to come, stubborn, racist, angry and sometimes out of control, it's fascinating to observe this character as played by one of the true nice guys on television.

Franz, of course, is the only original cast member to remain for the entire series run, though Gordon Clapp as Detective Medavoy shows up in episode three and throughout the first season...but not as a series regular.

I always found Nicholas Turturro's James Martinez a bit much but he also brought a wide-eyed energy to the show. Martinez is eager to learn from the best which, despite their differences, Kelly and Sipowicz are.

James McDaniel's Lt. Arthur Fancy is the show's other enduring character and it is clear that he and Sipowicz don't care very much for each other (that crack about going out for ribs was typical of their relationship)but recognize that, on some level, they need to work together.

Sherry Stringfield's Laura Hughes Kelly is good as the reason for a lot of John Kelly's problems...it was the job that tore their marriage apart.

We also see the Medavoy-Donna Abandando dance, the downfall of Andy Sipowicz Jr. and the beginnings of Sipowicz's relationship with Sylvia. We also see his ongoing battle with alcoholism and the other demons that possess him.

It's unfortunate that Caruso left after a mere 26 episodes, but he made his mark and later admitted he made a big mistake. He thought he could sign his own ticket for a big screen career after that, but it never materialized. Only when CSI:Miami came along was he able to resurrect his career.

It's disappointing that only this and season two have been released...and there seems to be nothing on the horizon for seasons three onward. But, if this is all to be released on DVD, they have released Blue at it's best, a collection no fan should be without.",1122163200,13,3915,4.697810218978102

1817011,5,B00007I6FP,"I have watched the show both in prime-time and on syndication, and if I had to say one thing about it to sum it up, I would say this: you have to be pretty intelligent to be able to follow it in all of it's complexities. The situations, dialogue, and personality quirks or the characters are something that I think could only be comprehended fully by an extremely smart 12th grader or a person who has either gone to college, or read a ton of books, or lived on the streets of NY. You have to know what ""He got shanked in Riker's"" means. If you think a shank is something you put in your soup, and you don't know what/where Rikers is, the show can be frustrating. The characters often speak in riddles and use sarcasm not easily understood by the perps even! You have to have a basic understanding of police and criminal procedure, investigations, etc. and symbolism. In any given episode there are usually two new cases and a continuation of one or two storylines that have been ongoing, so, unlike Law & Order, if you just sit down and turn it on, you can get lost right off the bat. Checking the episode guides online will help, but you need to know the characters personalities as well! Sipowicz is old-school. Medavoy is melodramatic. Diane is kind of hesitant, Jill is much less tense. My personal favorite, James Martinez (played by the versatile Nicholas Turturro), unfortunately did not stay with the show through the run.

1817012,5,B00007I6FP,"David Caruso evidently had a difficult time during his one season of ""Blue"" and four great episodes in the second season. But when he was on the show, it was complex, bittersweet, tough, and heartbreaking.  He brought a sensibility and a soul to the show that it lacked when the more conventional Jimmy Smits came on board and the show became more conventional too. Caruso's unsentimental relations with the other characters made the show seem real. His cooler, more low key style brought out more humanity in every episode.  To me, there was no other actor on any TV drama who brought this much to the table. The extra documentaries on the First Season Disc (and the Second Season too) relate the difficulties he had - but it doesn't take away from his work.  This was the finest season of TV cop drama - it was the peak.  And it hasn't yet been equalled. Seeing Caruso on the more conventional and flimsy ""CSI:Miami"" and seeing Dennis Franz finish out the string on the final, awful, sentimental ""Blue"" episodes only makes the First Season stand out stronger: all 22 episodes are great, including the 4 of the Second Season - and then you see Smits and a more predictable style take over.  Caruso made the show great.",1115510400,12,1219,4.625

Dennis Franz was there from the first through the last episode of ""Blue"" and just became better and better with each season.  The only reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 5 is due to the presence of Caruso who only served to drag the show down.  True acting genius is when a really nice guy has to play the part of a first rate Ass**** and manages to do it with a serious degree of humor, just as Dennis Franz did for the shows entire run.  A miserable, self centered individual just acting the part is nothing special.  I was glad to see Caruso go.  Jimmy Smitts was a much better fit by far.  Over all, it's the best Police drama ever.

In particular I liked the character of Kelly, and the character of Janice. I thought Janice was quite a tough gal, and Detective Kelly was your average straight arrow. Martinez was okay, but needed a wardrobe change and a shave. (His shirts were just awful!) My only peeve was the sex. Do we really need to see Sipowicz naked getting it on with a prostitute? I'm not a prude, but I really prefer to leave that to my imagination. Thank you very much. I also thought Kelly was a bit of a jerk to Janice. She was going through enough without him giving her the third degree and the cold shoulder. And what's with all the women? He divorces his wife and then has more dates than captain Kirk. I wish the writers toned it down. Kelly just isn't  THAT good looking. Some of the other character's love life's might've been more interesting to see fleshed out.

1817061,5,B00007I6FP,"When Boccho introduced ""Hill Street Blues"" to TV audiences, I thought that nothing could surpass the brilliance of that show.  I must say that even with the creation of NYPD Blue, nothing has in my mind.  However, this does not mean that Blue is not as compelling as Hill Street in its storytelling, cinematography, ensemble acting, brilliant writing and plot characterization.  The core of the show rests in the way cases are intertwined with the personalities of the characters.  What facinates me is the varied and complex range of each character, especially Andy Sipowitz.  He above all the other characters personafies the struggle of finding ones true self through the personal demons within.  With that said you can't help but love the guy because through the rough and tough surface appearance, he is a dedicated cop and a good person that can see the best in others more readily than he can see in himself.
The first two seasons are classic in the way the characters are brought to life so that each is identifiable to the audience in such a way that you feel their expierence personally.  Add to this the superb storytelling and camera work and you have TV worth watching which says a lot considering there is very little to see these days.  Although recent seasons are not as compelling as the first two (what shows are?), I still find myself glued to channel seven (NY) partly based on those first two seasons.
Accordingly, it is my feeling that season one and two are a must for anyone who appreciates great acting, brilliant writing, and exceptional storytelling.  These are the ingredients that make for excellent TV",1061856000,5,1631,4.817204301075269
1817062,5,B00007I6FP,"Oh, dear, this is an addictive series. 6 episodes in 4 days. Get a life, Gaz. I'd already seen the whole series twice when it was originally run, and thought it so good that I sat down to write the makers a congratulatory letter but I didn't know who to send it to. The problem for the producers was that they told the story of the precinct house so well, and ended it on such a perfect note, that there wasn't really any point in continuing with it. They'd done it, and should have left it as a one off masterpiece. The next series lacked Caruso, the long running corruption saga and the strong writing. I don't know if some writers moved on, but the humour of the show, similar to 'Hill Street Blues', seemed to lessen dramatically. Formula set in, the usual interrogation scenes, and also a peculiar political correctness. I don't know whether that's because of all the rules in America to do with office politics, no racism, sexism etc, but everyone in the squad room seemed to talk in this odd ""I-must-check-every-word-for-respect"" stilted speak. Very odd and uncomfortable. I stopped watching and the series eventually vanished for two years before returning at an after midnight slot. Caruso went on to star in 'Micheal Hayes' which was an interesting attempt to tackle politics with intelligence, but was slow starting and often incomprehensible to the layman. Sadly, he now stars in 'CSI: Miami', a truly dreadful, meretricious waste of time in which he appears to be in a straightjacket with nothing much to do. Franz appears to have stayed with the show, but the tragedies in his life seem to have gotten into the realms of the ridiculous. If they haven't already, they should cut his character a break. Nearly everytime an actor wants out, the producers kill their character. Is this realistic?
Before all that, though, was this classic first series which is well worth investing in. I have problems with some of it. Halfway through, police brutality was introduced, and the constant beating up of suspects, which the series appeared to condone, quickly became repellent. I note that real NY cops didn't get away with this conduct in one particularly notorious case. Also, the lead characters were never on the take or anything. Real good guys, up to a point.
