5399611,5,B00A8GBWNA,A refreshing version of a timeless story! Both creatively shot and wonderfully acted....captures the whole hearted freedom and magic of second chances.,1357430400,,151,5.909090909090909
5399612,5,B00A8GBWNA,"Across the board, Broken Roads features some of the finest acting of any movie this year.  You will fall in love with these characters.  Moving and emotionally charged - a must see!",1357430400,,181,4.625
5399623,1,B00A8GBWNA,"Maybe this COULD have been a good film but it's not!  Terrible acting...totally over the top and unbelievable!  Sally Kirkland?  Are you kidding?  RETIRE!  The young man in this movie is ""okay"" but when he shows his anguish and anger it is totally unbelievable.  The movie is terrible and I didn't make it past the first half hour.  Don't waste your time!",1509753600,,355,4.629032258064516
5399624,1,B00A8GBWNA,Some of the worst acting I think I have ever seen. I don't know who told Aidan Bristow he could act but he can't.,1508544000,,113,3.75
5399625,5,B00A8GBWNA,This is a message from a higher being. With every sorrow comes a new Blessing.,1508457600,,78,4.266666666666667
5399626,4,B00A8GBWNA,"This review may sound negative, but it isn't. This is a really great story about all the things life can throw at us, and our inherent desire and ability to pick up the pieces to forge ahead. While I hesitate to write this, I feel as though it must be said, so here goes. There were three instances in the movie, that I counted, in which lines were 'borrowed' from a few mega-movies. I'm not going to list them, but if you pay attention while watching the film, every instance that seems unnaturally forced it may have been the result caused by the insertion of a famed performance of earlier times.",1508284800,,599,4.405405405405405
5399627,4,B00A8GBWNA,Good but not great...moved really slow,1508025600,,38,5.5

5399629,3,B00A8GBWNA,"Hard to rate these movies that are so slow to develop and looong.  It probably would have been a better movie if it had been shorter.  I did like the message.. for me it was simply, we aren't done living till we're done; for others it might be something different.  I do question those that complained about the age of the actor (he was 25 when the movie was made, not 18, but heck, close enough.)  When he isn't screaming you can hear he has a young voice.  And the rater that complained about his eyebrows... really?  lol.  Haven't you ever seen Meditteranean-type men.  They are dark and bushy and handsome.  :)  Anyway, I gave it 3 stars because it had some redeeming qualities to it, that started to fill out about an hour into it, but it was a loooong slow movie.  Good enough acting that I went to see what other movies some of the actors had made.",1507507200,,855,4.28125
5399630,5,B00A8GBWNA,"I COULDN'T PUT IT ANY BETTER THAN SOMEONE ELSE WROTE.
Awesome, heartfelt movie!! Spectacular acting to the point where you didn't know they were acting....it was like watching real life unfolding.
I GUESS BECAUSE I TO HAVE GOE THROUGH SOME STUFF AND STILL AM. IT HELPED TO GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE FIGHT TO GET THROUGH SOME STUFF I'M STILL BATTELING.",1507334400,3,347,4.704918032786885
5399631,1,B00A8GBWNA,"This movie went on & on to last two & 1/2 hours & I fail to understand why the content couldn't have been shortened. It was basically a slow-paced, teenage years, made-for-TV type of plot. The acting was not that good & I could go on with reasoning. Save yourself that two & half hours & watch something epic or do yard work. You will have accomplished much more than sitting through this movie; I wish I had.",1507075200,,409,4.256410256410256
5399632,5,B00A8GBWNA,"Awesome, heartfelt movie!! Spectacular acting to the point where you didn't know they were acting....it was like watching real life unfolding.",1506470400,,142,5.809523809523809
5399653,3,B00A8GBWNA,"I'm an hour into this and trying to decide if I want to spend another 1.5 hours hoping something makes it worthwhile.  Honestly, I don't see why any film is 2.5 hours long.  To me, that indicates an editing problem.  I'm distracted by this actor who plays Aldo.  Not only does he not look 17, but he also has an eyebrow challenge going on.  Are they painted on?  Whatever it is, they look fake and are an odd shape.  Would look good on Mr. Spock, but not Aldo.  Acting talent by the entire cast is a good effort; I've seen worse.  Plus, in some spots, the writing makes me wonder who in the world wrote this script.  I don't know if the last long stretch will be worth viewing based on what I've already seen.",1506211200,,709,4.185185185185185
5399654,2,B00A8GBWNA,"The premise has great possibilities. However, I could not get past the poor writing, the slowness, the darkly lit scenes, and most of all, the lead actor, who looked like 30 instead of 18. As a mother of a 23 year old son, this bothered the hell out of me. Turned it off about 1/4 way thru. Oh- and all the glowing reviews perplex me. So over the top; ""Best movie ever made"" "" a masterpiece"". LOL, nope.",1506211200,,403,4.17948717948718
5399655,5,B00A8GBWNA,"I started out watching this thinking; what am I watching.  However, I gave the movie time and it gripped me!!  The acting is not the best at times, but the emotions are raw!  The story line is true to everyday life and the feelings that occur in situations of loss, love, growth, change, forgiveness, and  redemption.  Watch it!!",1506038400,,329,4.603448275862069

5399658,4,B00A8GBWNA,"Almost shut this one off, but gave it a go and it turned out to be pretty good.  Realistic, earthy, and good acting.  The story covers the human emotions of should have, could have, why me, had a person known, etc.  It ends well and there is hope.  Give this one a watch.  It starts off slow, but it will be worth your time.  The makeup artist could have gone easier on the eyebrows.",1505520000,,383,4.108108108108108
5399659,1,B00A8GBWNA,"You had to listen to a second rate opening song and no one spoke for the first 15 minutes of the film and they they started screaming at one another.  I kept fast forwarding, hit on a damn sex scene, fast fowarded until the dumb end.  Another film casting from a welfare line of non-actors and calling it a movie.  Another waste of effort, time, money. and using 5 watt bulbs that keep the whole movie in black.  Where's my gun?",1505433600,2,428,4.246913580246914
5399660,4,B00A8GBWNA,Really quite good.,1504742400,,18,5.333333333333333

5399662,2,B00A8GBWNA,"S-L-O-W moving and very hard to get through. Not sure how it got so many good ratings. Family and friends, maybe?

The only reason I gave it more than one star is that the actors did well despite horrible direction.",1503964800,,215,4.375
5399663,5,B00A8GBWNA,"Very interesting movie, but boy was acting too childish just cause daddy left. I have been through at least 100,000 times the night mare he has gone through, but the acting on every ones part was very good in the time only allotted for such a subject. Excellent long pauses and facial expressions.",1446768000,,297,4.622641509433962

5399665,5,B00A8GBWNA,"This movie is so special that words do not describe it!!!!!! From the directing, acting, camera shots and soundtrack its an absolute masterpiece. Director justin chambers first feature film and its unbelievable how great it is for someones first movie the director is a true TALENT i fell in love with the film immediately. terrific acting by Aiden Bristow, Sally Kirkland, Soshana Bush and Rolonda Watts. If you have not yet seen it its an absolute must see and truly something special to be seen its a remarkable first film from Director Justin Chambers and just the beginning of a legendary career for him. I can not wait to see what is in store next for him and his future endeavors! Pure inspiration truly special and a must see from a very talented cast and crew! THIS IS A MUST SEE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BROKEN ROAAAADDDDDDDDSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!! CAPTIVATING INTRIGUING INSPIRATIONAL GREATTTTT ALL AROUND MUST SEEEEEE BEST OF 2012-2013",1363564800,,938,5.019230769230769
5399666,2,B00A8GBWNA,"The best thing about the movie is newcomer Aidan Bristow (who DOESN'T look Italian at all). He has a cute face, nice teeth, interesting eyes and (LOL) batwing eyebrows. He is a good actor, and doesn't overdo his feelings. The film would totally fall apart without him. But even he can't carry this effort. The story is good, but unfortunately weakened by its excruciating snail pace: every unnecessary minute makes it all the weaker. Two and a half hours are appropriate for a panoramic Biblical saga. This would have been more powerful had it lasted an hour and a half or l:45 max. The first hour could have been cut to 20 minutes: too many silences, pauses, dead time. The musical score, while pleasant by itself, just slows down the action and really does nothing to enhance the film. There is no evidence of any real editing here - the plot drags on like water periodically dripping from a faucet. The father appears too late in the film. Knowing more about him and developing the relationship with his newly-discovered son would have put more flesh on the sparse storyline. Bristow's acting rates 3.5 stars, but Bush's histrionics and the deadly sluggishness of the screen time bring it all down to 2 stars. Mr. Bristow, choose a better script next time and your career will take off!",1363564800,,1289,4.707964601769912
5399667,5,B00A8GBWNA,"Lovely indie feature with a lot of heart that looks like it came from a major studio.  The film boasts strong, affecting performances; from the masterful Kirkland and appealing newcomers Bristow and Bush to the fine supporting players Watts, Marquand and Glass, each actor creates an authentic, passionate portrait. Director Chambers' premise is engaging and his well-written script is heartfelt and thought provoking. Beautiful cinematography gives the film high-budget texture and a first-rate score adds to the professional quality.  A little film with a lot to recommend it.",1362355200,3,578,5.556818181818182
5399668,5,B00A8GBWNA,"I had the opportunity of watching ""Broken Roads"" when it was premiered at Harkins Movie Theater in Tempe, Arizona. It was a thought-provoking and an emotional movie. It showcases how one can turn a troubling past into a learning opportunity for growth. Once we engage our thoughts and actions in a positive and optimistic direction we turn our ashes into beauty. This movie is engaging, entertaining, and empowering. It is for everyone.

5399669,5,B00A8GBWNA,The soundtrack for this film was perfect!! The scoring and mood it captured were spot on.  Get the film - get the track!!!,1361923200,4,122,4.304347826086956
5399670,5,B00A8GBWNA,"A pleasant surprise film in an age of violence and extravaganzas!!  An excellent cast creates an old story in a new and exciting way.  Great locations, excellent camera work and a terrific cast!!  Sally Kirkland is still wonderful and Shoshanna Bush is a real find.....I sure hope to see alot more of her. This film is definitely a MUST SEE!!",1357776000,5,342,4.666666666666667
5399671,5,B00A8GBWNA,Beautifully filmed! Beautiful story line! Incredibly touching movie! Good to see a great film in a day that most movies don't seem to capture anything of substance! 'Broken Roads' is ABSOLUTELY a MUST.SEE.,1357516800,2,205,5.242424242424242
8548212,2,B00A8GBWNA,"The most impressive aspect of this movie is how the director managed to cram about 1.5-2 hours of content into 2.5 hours of run time. The story moved along very slowly, with many scenes dragging on and other scenes being completely unnecessary. There were some good moments in the movie, with just as many cringe-worthy moments. The acting was decent except for the grandmother. She flip-flopped between being okay and terrible. If you have 2.5 hours to spare with no other options go ahead and watch it.",1527465600,,504,4.804597701149425
8548213,2,B00A8GBWNA,"SOOOOOO slow. 3 every scene has a 15 second lull that could have been removed. Main actor was 26 trying to play an 18 year old.  He yelled way too much. I never have a chance to watch a movie, so I'm bummed it was so terrible.",1524787200,,226,3.8085106382978724

8548215,1,B00A8GBWNA,I got through about half of this movie and couldn't stand to watch it any further.  The lead actor is so-so at best.  His anger is totally over the top bordering on absurd.  Sally Kirkland is ok but not the greatest actress.  I just wasted over an hour of my time  hoping this would get better.  Don't bother to watch it.,1520812800,,321,4.180327868852459
8548216,1,B00A8GBWNA,"So slow. And so long. Not that great of a storyline. Very predictable. Fair acting. Wish I could have my 2.5 hour back. Also wish I had read the reviews first. And paid attention to the imdb score. Watc h love everlasting, same type movie but way better in half the time.",1517788800,,271,4.230769230769231

8548218,1,B00A8GBWNA,"If i could give this movie no stars i would. Terrible acting, way to long, and a ton of screaming! Wife made me watch this. I can only imagine watching this over and over again is what hell feels like. Painting a room would have been a better time then watching this and i hate painting",1514678400,,286,4.125

8548220,3,B00A8GBWNA,Nice film. It has it's flaws (I'ts too long and in some parts it feels kind of slow) but if offers nice performances for the most part and the story is interesting. The characters are deep and relatable (especially the protagonist) and the plot keeps you interested till the end.,1513900800,,279,4.6
8548221,3,B00A8GBWNA,"I thought this movie was going to be more about romance. I found this movie in the romance genre in the Amazon Prime Video section. More of sad movie than anything. The main character experiences many negatives in his personal life. Then Madeline was introduced. Madeline was very kind, patient, and generous. Madeline was the only real loving character in the movie. Throughout the movie I was really just waiting to see which scenes she appears in. Otherwise, the movie was rather unbearable. I guess she was the only one character I could really relate to.",1510012800,,559,4.833333333333333
