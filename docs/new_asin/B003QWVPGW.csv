4172080,5,B003QWVPGW,"Not only great views of the cosmos, but step by step of all the progressions of the telescope and who was responsible for them.",1375660800,,127,4.333333333333333
4172081,5,B003QWVPGW,This was a well done program on the history of astronomy and man's increasing appetite for seeing deeper into space. Ever since its invention the telescope has been getting bigger and bigger. This will continue as long as there are technological developments in the field of optics and engineering. This is a good survey type of show for science minded viewers.,1370995200,,361,4.934426229508197
4172082,4,B003QWVPGW,"There are very view docs on past, present and future tools for Astronomy, this fills the gap.  Add it to your collection.",1368835200,,121,4.5
4172083,5,B003QWVPGW,"This documentary is packed with information, beautifully presented like a story, at a pace that enlightens but not overwhelms the audience. It makes you marvel at the geniuses of the pioneers of science, and realize ""Wow, this is actually the world we live in"". When others made telescopes 150 feet long, Newton, yes, that Newton invented one that is 6"" long and more powerful. This film is full of stories like this.

Documentaries do not get better than this!",1347148800,,461,4.8354430379746836
4172084,4,B003QWVPGW,"There's much to this DVD to appreciate as it interweaves the story of the Telescope with the development of astronomy: the simulation of Galileo's first sighting of Jupiter's moons, the discovery by Newton of white light and spectral colors, the concept of a standard candle, Edwin Hubble, spectroscopy, redshifts & the discovery of galactic distances and expansion of the universe, etc. through to dark matter & dark energy.  The dramatizations of Galileo and Herschel are good but left me wanting more detail, especially for Herschel.

Some major omissions include achromatic refractors, Cassegrain reflectors, telescope mountings and the 200 inch Hale telescope.  The trade-off for the latter is the great, in-depth treatment of the reasons for building an observatory on Mt Wilson and the work done there.  The segments on current large telescopes don't touch the transition from equatorial to Alt-Az mounts and the tight integration of telescope and observatory building since the 1970s. The part of the DVD between the 10 and 20 minute marks has a frantic pace -- launching from Galileo's 1609-10 discoveries to current solar system probes, diving into Mars terrain, a quick jump back to the 1600s for Cassini himself then out to Saturn for the Cassini mission.  Here and elsewhere in the DVD the visuals are overdone for my taste: too many rocket launches, time-lapse shots of telescopes moving at unnatural speeds and 3D or video enhanced nebulae.

Still, the accuracy and interest level is very high.  Contemporary astronomers are clear, on-point and not given to rhetorical flourishes.  The DVD covers a lot of territory in 1 3/4 hours. The gaps can be filled in with a good book such as Fred Watson's Stargazer: The Life and Times of the Telescope and the DVD Journey to Palomar.",1310256000,9,1790,5.1061643835616435
4172085,5,B003QWVPGW,Loved this DVD....I could watch this over and over again....the photes from the hubble telescope are breathtaking....wish it were longer.,1304035200,2,137,5.9
4172086,5,B003QWVPGW,"A remarkable DVD that I highly recommend - technically of very good quality and the science is inspiring ($15 very well spent). Contact is probably my favorite movie of all time - definitely in the top 5 of all time. Here is the science behind much of it and the stories of the giants of optics and astronomy that made understanding the physical universe possible - Inspiring stories of great scientists of a bygone time and the present. The DVD has on it two separate programs - The Mystery of the Milky Way & The Ever Expanding Universe. Both lend themselves to viewing on a hi-def system - they upres perfectly with the images being remarkably crisp - again all round well produced DVDs. I would love to see this on Blue Ray b/c the vistas of space and the iconic images from Hubble will be superlatively perfect.

The Mystery of the Milky Way - Tracks developments in astronomy - from the lenses, Galileo - changing the world of Science and Religion to Cassinni - the rings of Saturn . The rudimentary tools and the first principles that were used to develop profound truths that seem so obvious today are shown and explained. The arrival of Sir Isaac Newton and his insight into the physics of optics is part of the pantheon of pioneers and their work is explained in a very engaging manner. The Ever Expanding Universe is a continuation of the first part but with the newer telescopes. Heard of the Hubble telescope? Ever wonder who it is named after? These are our heroes - of the 20th century - despite what the media may have you believe. It is somewhat sad that this documentary that encapsulates and chronicles great science and even greater people, is inspiring, yet gets only two reviews in two years while the Disney movie Tangled gets 192 reviews a week after being released.
I will end this sermon by saying -. NASA/ JPL - MY HEROES - I love you!!!",1302048000,18,1864,4.531157270029674
4172087,5,B003QWVPGW,"I learned more in the four separate hours of this DVD than I have from many shows. It really Blew My Mind
I was astonished at the number of stars and the actualy distances that are somehow made fathomable by this intelligent History of Telescopes. Every  on should see this to really understand our place in this Universe.
I have watched it four times already and plan for many more veiwings with family and friends. This is really great to loan. Fantastic easy to understand Science at its most amazing.",1286755200,22,504,4.6
4172088,5,B003QWVPGW,"I caught this on TV on PBS and LOVED it, been waiting for it to be released on DVD, amazing images and info and excellent narration. Takes you on the amazing journey of early astronomers discovering planets and the solar system to the present day Hubble discoveries. Its amazing to realize that before telescopes, we had no idea about space, and watching the timelines of these discoveries is exciting. I highly recommend this DVD, you will get lost in it and find your mind expanding.",1277337600,14,485,4.7176470588235295
8402677,5,B003QWVPGW,"This package brings together two documentaries on at telescopes, and their capabilities.  The first starts with the earliest discoveries in the seventeenth century, and traces the development of more powerful telescopes that made it possible to understand the solar system and the Milky Way.  The second picks up with the construction of the Mount Wilson observatory in the early twentieth century, which was used to identify other galaxies, and was instrumental in discovering that the universe was expanding.  From there, the narrative moves on to the Hubble and radio telescopes, which have let to the mapping of fluctuations in the early universe, and the recent discoveries of dark matter and dark energy.  Highly recommended.",1523059200,,731,5.385964912280702
8402678,5,B003QWVPGW,"Use this in my introductory astronomy course at a major university, large lecture (200+ students). The DVD covers the history, technical aspects, and the future of telescopes.",1514160000,,175,5.518518518518518
8402679,5,B003QWVPGW,Love space telescopes and this documentary feeds your interest. I would recommend to anyone interested in astronomy.,1477872000,,116,5.882352941176471
8402680,5,B003QWVPGW,I watch this over and over...great film!,1425168000,,40,4.857142857142857
8402681,5,B003QWVPGW,"This 2-parter from Nova tells the history of cosmology from the invention of Galileo's telescope to the present day, covering many of the key people and events along the way:  Galileo, Isaac Newton's invention of the reflecting telescope, the astronomical brother-sister team of Caroline and William Herschel using large reflecting telescopes to explore the Heavens, Edwin Hubble (first to prove that galaxies other than our own exist), Penzias and Wilson who discovered the 3 degree Kelvin background radiation.  And much more!

This covers the history of the telescope and cosmology and the things that are being explored today, like dark matter, dark energy, the variations in the blackbody radiation from the Big Bang, and the first good measure of the age of the universe (13.7 billion years).  There's a lot of detail here and certainly a lot that's been left on the cutting room floor -- a regrettable, but very necessary thing.  Cosmology goes back to the ancient Greeks (and undoubtedly before that) and shows no signs of stopping or even slowing down:  any question answered is sure to bring out new questions.

We hear most of this tale from people working in the field today, experts all, who clearly love their work and that of those who came before.  The videos are stunning, the discussions entertaining and enlightening.  I think that years from now, when cosmology has (predictably) moved on and some of these present-day questions have been answered, this will still be an entertaining and enlightening program.",1424649600,,1529,5.108433734939759
8402682,5,B003QWVPGW,Excellent all the way around. I would buy from them again. Very satisfied overall.,1414713600,,82,4.928571428571429
8402683,5,B003QWVPGW,"This is a wonderful documentary by PBS which goes through the history of science's exploration into the universe using the telescope. I've shown it to 5th grade classes and they learn a great deal from it while enjoying it at the same time. This documentary gives some of the essential ""how we know"" information that is usually lacking from science textbooks.  It is important that students not just memorize a bunch of science facts, but that they also understand how it is that we know these facts are true. This documentary accomplishes that goal with style.

The documentary is divided into two parts covering the earlier years of telescope usage and then the modern time period. Students will learn how Galileo, Newton, Herschel, Hubble and others improved and improved telescope technology and usage in order to peer ever further into the universe. They will learn how the big bang, dark matter, and dark energy were discovered and how we can tell how far away stars are and which way they are moving.

As usual, NOVA has real present day scientists explaining many of the concepts in the movies. It is important that students become familiar with the names and faces of modern scientists. They usually know tons of actors and pop stars and then only a couple scientists when they come to my class. These always being Galileo, Newton, and Einstein (all dead and gone). When they leave my class they know scores of modern scientists and what they do. One way I accomplish that is through quality documentaries, such as this one by NOVA.",1402876800,3,1541,4.807547169811321
8402684,5,B003QWVPGW,"I watched this one in the company of others who were even more amazed than I was at the ""scope"" of the telescopes that are busily searching the skies for a greater understanding of where we are in the Cosmos. The segment that shows a ""blank"" spot in the star field blew us away. It makes me wonder who pays for all these incredible machines and the work of the scientists?",1383868800,2,372,4.253521126760563
8402685,5,B003QWVPGW,"Want to understand space and just how immense it is? Watch this documentary about man's discovery of not only planets and stars, but other galaxies like our own Milky Way. Awesome!",1382832000,,180,4.838709677419355
8402686,5,B003QWVPGW,"This DVD about the history of the telescope is wonderfully done and I found
it very enjoyable and informative.  Highly recommend!!",1381449600,,130,5.190476190476191
