2515123,5,B000EBGFPO,"I caught this movie at a small screening a few weeks ago. It is by far, one of the better Independant Serial Killer Genre movies that has come out in the last few years.

A must have for Indie-True Crimw buffs.",1140566400,2,210,4.121951219512195
2515124,5,B000EBGFPO,"Finally!! It was about time they did a re-make of The Boston Strangler! You guys, if you love thriller/drama/serial killer movies like I do, it's a must see!!!! The reason why I've already saw it, 'cause to me, where there's a will there's a way! This new actor Mauro Lannini is definatelly going to be a very well known and respected actor, and maybe even a star, I believe he's got the potential, and he's very handsome! I'd definately cast him! The actor that plays the detective is not bad either. I loved the movie a lot! and the writing, I loved the writing too. For some it might be a bit graphic, but hey after all it's The Boston Strangler movie that we're talking about! It's definatelly a great movie, don't miss it.",1140566400,3,727,4.432835820895522
2515125,5,B000EBGFPO,"Hello dear amazon.com,

I'm a big fan of Thriller!
I just recently watched the new Boston Strangler movie, although it hasn't come out yet I somehow was able to watch it. Wow!
First of all I want to mention that there's a mistake, Albert De Salvo is not portrayed by Tony Curtis but by Mauro Lannini. Let's give that actor the credit that he DESERVES, so please make a note of it.
I then want to mention that although is not a big budget movie, it's very well done, I loved it! And that actor Mauro Lannini,
I don't know where he comes from, but he's amazing! I loved the way is acting in the movie.

8108270,4,B000EBGFPO,"I thought the acting really fine.  The direction was annoying with the explosive back flashes.  Seems DiSalvo's guilt was never really confirmed for all the murders.  And finally when his DNA was available in 2010, it proved his guilt in only one early murder.  It's thought that there were more than one Boston stranglers.  I am hard of hearing and would have liked captions, which the DVD didn't have.  The movie is not as good as I first thought perhaps and interesting enough, if a bit slow.  It's better than the Tony Curtis version.",1486252800,,538,4.659574468085107
8108271,3,B000EBGFPO,"The movie was decent and interesting to watch, but not that great either. I sold this movie on ebay not long after I watched it. It is ok for a rental, but not a purchase.",1406246400,,171,3.914285714285714
8108272,1,B000EBGFPO,"Terrible on every level. The lead actor is an Italian playing an American w/ a horrible accent and  lisp. It's laughable. Production values are worse than a student film. The actor playing John Bottomly, the lead investigator, has a modern haircut - he hasn't even bothered to cut his hair to reflect that it's 1963. Forget script. its awful. Why bother making a movie when you are this lazy. Can i have my money back?",1357603200,,418,4.573333333333333
8108273,1,B000EBGFPO,"Apparently the producers of this film has no budget for lights....Every scene is in the dark with a thunderstorm raging outside and ghosts houling in the background....and... Ricky Ricardo as Albert DeSalvo..
Get the picture ??",1214956800,,227,5.333333333333333
8108274,1,B000EBGFPO,"I don't care how much I hate a movie...I finish watching it. There's only two movies that I have stopped watching in the last 2 years. One was ""The Phantom of the Opera."" It's not that it was a bad movie, I just don't like musicals. The second one, is this film. I made it through twenty minutes before turning this off. What a piece of crap. That's not just because it's completely inaccurate and can't hold a candle to the original. This is just a poorly produced and poorly made film. First off, the dude playing Albert DeSalvo has a foreign accent. Not a Boston accent. Hell, I don't even mind the fact that he doesn't have a Boston accent...But the dude sounds like he's from Prague or something. The cinematography is awful...In the beginning, they list a hefty record (including rape) for DeSalvo. That's not true. Tony Curtis (who played DeSalvo in the original) was perfect; He made the character look like a family man, as well as an insane killer. This guy's crazy from the beginning and admitting to the murders right off the bat. Don't see this movie. See the the other one. This is a waste of time and a complete waste of money. I sat through Dahmer, Ted Bundy, Gacy, Evilenko, and Ed Gein. 4 of those 5 movies were bad. This is the worst. This movie deserves negative stars, OK?

GRADE: -Z",1154908800,11,1304,4.456066945606694
8108275,2,B000EBGFPO,"Talk about a dull movie. The facts were not all drawn out right nor was the personal information about Albert De Salvo. In summary, boring movie with Albert's mind games about the thirteen women he supposedly killed in the 60's.",1151107200,6,228,4.725
8108276,1,B000EBGFPO,"And I really struggled.

I felt like I was watching a cast of porno stars taking a week off from their usual work to try more 'serious acting' which had a don't-give-up-your-day-job quality about it: unnatural and stilted. I guess the fluffers weren't around. I think a better job could have been done with a bunch of cardboard cut-out figures.

The background music was mostly cheesy synthesized stuff. Okay so they didn't have a big budget. A kazoo might have worked better.

Camera work: they had one technique that they used to death - the slow circular pan. And what was with all those overhead shots of modern day Boston? Oh, maybe we weren't supposed to notice that.

I wondered about the research done on the story. Near the beginning when the goodie-two-shoes dectective gets a grilling on how he's got to get DeSalvo's confession any way he can, he questions why the guy would admit to the killings. The response from one of the tough guys is 'they're all looking for their 15 minutes.' This comes from the famous quote of Andy Warhol which, oddly enough, wasn't uttered until 3 years after the events in the movie take place.

And why, if there was political advantage in getting DeSalvo's confession at any cost, would you send an honest person to get it?

Clipping room floor fodder, this one.",1146614400,11,1306,4.681222707423581
8108277,4,B000EBGFPO,"A goood indie film! A very interesting story with new evidence, yet the question still remains the same as who's The Boston Strangler. Great scenes between Mauro Lannini and Jason David, they really pull you in.",1143072000,,211,4.888888888888889
8108278,5,B000EBGFPO,"This movie is like a good book that you can't wait til the end! The acting, the story-telling, the suspense, and the directing are all superb and I wish there were more movies done this well. It is definately a must-have DVD!",1141862400,,225,4.380952380952381
8108279,5,B000EBGFPO,"Not being a proffessional reviewer,....I don't know the words they use... but...I say this Is a movieI would definetely pay to see. I did see the orig. oneThis looks great to me.( I watched the trailer). terrific and stunning action, the lead actor is headed for big rimes I think... hmmm it says this was made last year... how come theres  nothing out there like ads or anything???  anyways cant wait for it to hit the theatres.
