174593,5,0984301801,Excellent! A great movie and many Biblical analogies for any Christian! Inspiring biography and a super lesson about picking up the Cross and denying yourself daily!,1336348800,2,165,5.384615384615385
174594,5,0984301801,"I have been a Jesus follower for 30 years and I would say this man's story is more significant than 90% of what happens in today's American churches.  There is no doubting his sincerity--his sacrifice is obvious and the object of his devotion is clear.  He knows the real meaning of life and the movie got me questioning how I am spending my life, as it no doubt does to anyone who watches it.  You can't NOT LIKE Arthur--he has no agenda of his own.  He is sharing God's love and using the cross as evidence.  The movie is well done, fascinating and one of the best investments of time a person could make.  Arthur is the Mother Theresa of evangelism!",1335398400,3,652,4.347107438016529
174595,5,0984301801,"WOW!  This man's story is just amazing!  What a phenomenal Christian witness this story is.  I cannot say enough good about it and it would be a perfect youth, bible or study movie.  I happened to watch it at church and had seen Arthur or CBN Network several times.

With that said:  This is a guy who is willing to absolutely do what God called him to do.  He is even willing to lay down his life in order to be obedient to what God asked him to do.  How many christians are willing to do that?

This movie will get you to think about what God has called you to do for Him, and what are you willing to do, and are you willing to sacrifice something for Him.",1332979200,,658,4.0
174596,5,0984301801,"Arthur Blessitt is one of the strongest Christians ever! The Lord gave him the strength to literally walk around the world! This DVD has additional stories and many other great features, like music videos and classic pictures of Arthur's adventures. If you are a Christian and willing to buy this, do it soon, because this product sells quickly!",1306886400,5,345,4.9655172413793105
174597,5,0984301801,"I am always blessed by Arthur Blessitt. I received this DVD the day before Christmas eve. My husband and I really enjoyed watching it Christmas afternoon. It is very inspiring - I wanted the story to go on though, and felt there was so much more to share, especially about his family. Thanks Arthur!",1299456000,6,299,4.555555555555555
174598,5,0984301801,"The Arthur Blessit story is much like watching a modern-day prophet. His life is a message and a sign, but the insight he shares throughout the movie is encouraging, but often challenges the western idea of Christianity. The movie itself is much like a documentary, only it holds your attention with anticipation and flows very smoothly. Many documentaries get a bit old after 30 minutes, but this movie is so professionally done with unique turns in the way the story is told, that your attention is captured throughout!
I really can't say enough good things about this movie. I went to see it numerous times in the theater, and now own the DVD myself. It has humor, drama, adventure, unexpected turns, and above all else, glorifies the Lord so beautifully. Believers in Jesus will undoubtedly be challenged and inspired, and unbelievers will appreciate Arthur's authentic walk with God.
Definitely good for youth groups and small groups, but also great for an evening movie night.",1289001600,17,982,4.9939024390243905
174599,5,0984301801,"I was given this DVD by a friend and absolutely love it. It's a beautiful story, inspirational, encouraging, and makes me cry every time. Must see!!!",1436659200,,149,4.769230769230769
174600,5,0984301801,"Jehovah God is amazing and so is his follower Arthur Blessitt!  You won't want to stop watching this once your start it!
Arthur has carried the cross for more than 41,000 miles in every country and major island group in the world!  He actually took 1 hours and 8 minutes out of his busy day to speak with my wife and I over the phone.  That conversation is something we will always remember!  Love Arthur and follow him on Facebook!",1432598400,,432,4.3625
174601,5,0984301801,"Very inspirational, The stories of his travels and the dangers he went though just to be a witness of what the cross represents is so uplifting.",1431216000,,144,4.576923076923077
174602,5,0984301801,Awesome story!,1425600000,,14,6.5
174603,5,0984301801,Great movie! It should be shown in every church. There are few men of God that are willing to obey God in the fashion that Arthur did and still does today.,1424131200,,155,4.032258064516129
174604,5,0984301801,Excellent film and it is an adventure in faith.  What an amazing story from Sunset Strip to walking the whole world facing all dangers and surviving on faith alone.  A story that will never leave you...thanks,1422403200,,208,4.75
174605,5,0984301801,"Where has this story been all these years? It has been a too-well-kept secret. Perhaps it's the way the DVD was marketed, but I truly had no idea of the incredible story I was about to watch. Even the first 15 minutes of introduction by the narrator left me thinking, ""What good could carryng a cross around the world do for anyone?"" But when Arthur Blessitt was finally allowed to speak for himself, starting with his ministry on Sunset Strip and telling stories from his 40-year journey with the cross, it blew me and my family away. Arthur's unshakable commitment to Christ, his unwavering devotion, obedience and love, made a huge impact on each one of us. Highly, highly recommended.",1419897600,3,688,4.741666666666666
174606,5,0984301801,Amazing story of a man who is a vessel of mercy!!!,1419292800,,50,3.6363636363636362
174607,5,0984301801,"We loved this movie, Arthur had GOD with him at ALL TIMES, and you can see that, in the trying moments of this movie, what a Commitment to the Cross of CHRIST.

I would like to see a movie of this made with actors also.

God bless you Arthur.",1406592000,,242,3.9183673469387754

174610,5,0984301801,This is an excellent documentary about a man sold out to Jesus Christ and loves Him more than life itself.  You will see numerous occasions where God intervened to protect Arthur and touched the lives of people all over the world.  A must see for every dedicated Christian!,1390262400,,273,4.666666666666667
174611,5,0984301801,Seeing God's work through the life of this man is such a blessing! I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be uplifted in how God works through His people.,1379980800,,161,4.225806451612903
174612,4,0984301801,"I enjoyed the movie.  It was not as dynamic as I was hoping.  I know there were many many more events that could have been covered in the content.  But, it did make a good effort at presenting Arthur Blessit and his efforts.

The seller was excellent!  I got the video the next day!  I was flabberghasted!",1379203200,,305,4.2631578947368425

It is amazing.",1356393600,3,329,5.226415094339623
174617,5,0984301801,"I wanted to give it three stars because of the lack of stories and how short the dvd is. Arthur doesn't like the focus being on his stories though and instead wants the focus on the message. So I will respect that. I did wish though he gave more details into his jouneys like he does on TBN. Still though, what he went through is soo amazing its worth 5 Stars or more!",1356048000,4,368,4.054794520547945
174618,5,0984301801,"I met Jesus in 1970 and Arthur Blessitt had been going across the Country. After 35 plus years, I wondered what happened to him. I was so happy to find that he did a  Documentry on all those years. What a blessing. I have shared it with most of my friends and will be sending it on to others in another Sate.
It's a perfect film to show how real and how wonderful God really is.
Thank you.",1336608000,3,389,3.9871794871794872
7795262,5,0984301801,Excellent movie. I remember hearing about this man walking across America on the news as a kid. I didn't realize that he has been walking across the world ever since.

Not necessarily ""entertainment"" but a decent kind of learning and witnessing.
Fact is better than fiction, which makes ""historical fiction"" writings (Michener, Ken Roberts, etc) and this product a fulfilling experience.
I bought at least one copy to support this product. (Put my money where my mouth is)",1445212800,,341,5.576923076923077
