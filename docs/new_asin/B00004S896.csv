1347057,5,B00004S896,"After 35 years it almost made my heart stop to see Jonathan Harris, Bill Mumy and the beloved Robot reunited on the flight deck of the Jupiter 2 in costume and character in this 1-hour TV special.  Produced and directed by  Lost in Space fan-boy Kevin Burns, this will delight anyone who grew up in  the 60's.  All I could do as I was watching the DVD was say  ""oooooohh"".  The bonus special effects and ""making of""  section at the end of the program were a great addition to my collection.  Five stars and a great ""thank you"" to Kevin Burns for making this  available to us.",956620800,30,575,4.299065420560748
1347058,5,B00004S896,"This program may not have been as heavily promoted as it should have been, but that aside, it is the second best retrospective of LIS there is. (Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen being the best, and due on DVD)the extras at the end are well worth the cost alone.
Thanks to the producers, Bill Mumy, Jonathan Harris, and the rest for turning out  such a great product.
If you haven't bought it yet, BUY IT NOW!",956534400,11,405,4.328947368421052
1347059,5,B00004S896,"If you loved Lost in Space as a kid, you probably have nostalgic feelings for it now. This is the best restrospective on the show I have seen. Why? Because it has stuff in it we HAVEN'T seen/heard before. But Kevin Burns puts it the best: it is worth it for the end. Billy and Jonathan in costume  again, on the J2 -- they seem so much like their old selves (watch Billy as  he runs from the controls to the astrogator .. it is just Will Robinson  used to do).",955843200,7,460,4.032967032967033
1347060,5,B00004S896,If you are a lost in space fan this DVD is a must! The behind the scenes footage and bloopers are amazing. Seeing Guy williams give his screen test gave me chills. If you don't have a DVD player this is  good reason to get  one!,954892800,14,228,3.9347826086956523
1347061,5,B00004S896,"WOW!  I've really got to hand it to the producers of this programme.  It is SPECTACULAR!  I had heard about it when it was first broadcast in the States, but I couldn't find a copy ANYWHERE! Now, thanks to the folks at  Foxstar Productions(who produced it) and Image Entertainment, HERE IT IS!  One hour of GREAT information on Irwin Allen's BEST TELEVISION SERIES  EVER!  Hosted by TV's John Laroquette, it has everything from clips  (galore) to interviews, bloopers, and scenes from the movie.  But the BEST  is at the END!  There... RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES... JOHNATHAN HARRIS, BILL  MUMY and THE ROBOT POP IN!  ON THE SET OF THE JUPITER 2!  IN CHARACTER!  Unbeleveable, folks.  As if all of this weren't enough, the DVD includes  BONUS MATERIALS!  Guy Williams COMPLETE screentest!  Special effects  bloopers!  A behind-the-scenes featurette!  The ORIGINAL CBS-TV network  sales presentation (that was used by Irwin to promote the show to  advertisers and toy companies)!  What MORE could you ask for?  How about  GREAT picture, colour and sound quality!  If you are reading this and  haven't purchased one yet -- SHAME ON YOU.  As for me?  I was lucky to get  a preview of the DVD from a friend who works at 20th Century Fox TV.  I've  already ordered mine! ENJOY!",952992000,62,1268,4.7981220657277
1347062,5,B00004S896,Found out about this video special while looking for anything on Lost in Space. It's quite a treat for those of us who enjoyed the series in our childhood. I'm glad it was produced.,1355097600,2,181,4.352941176470588
1347063,5,B00004S896,A really interesting & nostalgic look at a classic TV series. Took me back to my childhood with this much loved favourite. I will certainly watch this DVD again.,1331856000,,161,4.586206896551724
1347064,5,B00004S896,"For those of us who are Lost in Space fans, this documentary is very interesting, retrospective, and fullfiling; the cameos and interviwes with original cast members are rewarding as well. The interview with Guy Williams in wonderful, and will very much satisfy any fan..",1285545600,,271,5.181818181818182
1347065,4,B00004S896,"This disk is almost worth it, if only because of the Guy Williams screen test.
I was one the serious Lost in Space Watchers(a little older than Billy), I laughed with the robot, Dr. Smith and Wil, but Guy had whatever Errol Flynn had(charisma). He should have been a much bigger than he became. But one thing you've got to give him credit for, he was his own man and loved his family. Good for him. Watch the screentest and see why.",1239667200,4,432,4.280487804878049

1347068,3,B00004S896,"I was curious, and the reviews were fairly good, so I bought it. I enjoyed it, mainly for the interviews with the cast, and Guy Williams' screen test.  The rest was just a repeat of what you'll find on the season three DVD. Still, if you're a true LIS fan, you'll want to have it for your collection.",1204588800,4,300,4.172413793103448
1347069,3,B00004S896,it's ok but it would have been alot better if the narrater was mark goddard (major west).,1196553600,2,89,4.294117647058823
1347070,5,B00004S896,"it's worth buying if you are a fan of lis has interviews with cast members, behind scenes,best part was return of Will,Dr. Smith & Robot. They still got it as if they never stop playing their rolls. GET IT.....Now..",1162080000,4,215,4.538461538461538
1347071,4,B00004S896,"I read the other amazon reviews about this show and was almost reluctant to buy it.  However being a hardcore fan of Lost in Space, I bought it and very much enjoyed it.  I think John Larroquette hosted the show wonderfully regardless of his lack of affiliation with it.  I do agree with one thing: The ""BONUS Footae"" became quite boring after awhile. Unfortunately there was NO SOUND and it was just LONG, OVERLY-EXTENDED scenes of the cyclops giant, the chariot, and the Jupiter 2. Other than that, I enjoyed the reenactment of grown-up Will, aged Smith and the Robot getting lost in space.  It was evident to me that Jonathan Harris hadn't changed a bit and was an outstanding actor until the end. They could have done so much more with this show, perhaps it was hastily put together. I have to agree with Andy Spletzer:  ""Recommended for hardcore fans of the show.""",1122940800,7,869,4.616883116883117
1347072,5,B00004S896,"After reading the many lukewarm reviews here, I didn't have very high expectations for this DVD of a 1998 documentary produced in part to hype the Lost In Space motion picture released around that time. But after hearing that there was one last scene on here with the 1960s Dr. Smith and Will Robinson in character circa 1998, I knew I HAD to have this.

Turned out the documentary itself wasn't half as bad as I had been dreading. In fact I'd say overall it's pretty decent. Yeah, so John Laroquette is irrelevant to LIS, but I've seen many other documentaries hosted by people equally unrelated to their subject matter (--hell, Bill Mumy himself sometimes acts as host of Biography). At least Laroquette wasn't particularly irritating here like he could have been.

Maybe if you're a hardcore LIS fan who has read every book and article available on the subject, then there probably won't be much new here for you. But as someone who always enjoyed the show but hasn't really gotten into the fandom side of things, this documentary was just right for me and I picked up many a new fact here and there (eg.: John ""Star Wars"" Williams did the music for LIS too? I did not know that. And the guy who did the robot's voice was a completely different person from the one inside the suit? I did not know that either.)

It was great seeing the remaining cast members as they looked in 1998 and finding out what they had been doing during all the years since.  I also found this documentary very useful when trying to educate friends brand new to the classic LIS with more background info on the show. It really helps to show them how important this show is to many people (yes, I am NOT a freak for liking this!), and why. After watching this, they are not quite so dismissive of the show and are more willing to try and give it a chance.

Bonus material includes the original network promo presentation for potential advertisers (now also available on one of the LIS TV show DVDs), some SFX footage they shot of the giant cyclops for the show's pilot (I was surprised it was in colour. Did they shoot all the B & W shows in colour first?), and Guy Williams' screen test for Irwin Allen to get the part of Prof. John Robinson (my squeaky-clean image of Prof. Robinson is forever destroyed thanks to a moment when Williams seems intent on revealing to Irwin Allen the tender young age he lost his virginity at. Gah!)

But the real highlight here is of course the scene with Will and Dr. Smith. Both actors deliver their lines as convincingly as if they had just walked off the 60s set, and the Jupiter II mock-up they are in looks quite authentic too. The scene is over in a brief couple of minutes and the ending is a little silly, but I have to say it was really great just to get one final glimpse of them. It will be the last, unfortunately, due to the death of Jonathan Harris just months after. I really wish they had done more like this and sooner, but I guess something is better than nothing....

So for me, this disc was the perfect way to complete my LIS DVD collection. Just like the extra disc included especially for the fans in the Space 1999 DVD Megaset, it adds that last little something extra that's really nice to have. I think that this is one of those obscure titles that will be highly sought-after by fans after it goes out of print, so grab it while you can.

(--And for any people reading this from the DVD-making biz, howsabout releasing the episode of the 80s gameshow ""Family Feud"" that they mention in this documentary, where the cast of LIS were guests? I'd buy that!)",1120176000,17,3593,4.441578148710167
1347073,4,B00004S896,"I'm not sure why someone would question the choice for the host of the show. John LaR was just fine, seeming to grasp the importance of Lost in Space to its fans. he also seemed to blend in with the inside humour.

 I would have liked to have seen some outtakes, but you can't have it all.

 As stated by another, the colour was great. Seeing Guy Williams doing the interview was very enlightening to me. He's been described as a 50's/60's George Cluny. Bull! He is an Errol Flynn if there ever was one, and that screen test mkaes him seem more akin to Flynn in that cocky way. Cluny does not have the features of those two, nor could he be considered a looker at all, in comparison.

 To see Johnathon Harris have some fun again was great. At the time of the 1997 movie he was asked if he did a cameo in the film. His answer was, ""Cameos? We do not do cameos!""

  Mumy actually seemed like a kid again, which is strange for all  the growing up he had to do. He was fine.

All of the interviews were much appreciated, but a tad too short.

 Watching this made me decide to get all of the DVD's of the three seasons, but I am going to wait to see if there is a package of all of them when the second half of the third season hits. Sure beats cable-cr**ola.",1112400000,15,1255,4.073469387755102
1347074,3,B00004S896,"While the majority of this DVD is a rehash of other Lost in Space documentaries, it is worth purchasing for the last 10 minutes of the main feature - in which Dr. Smith and Will reappear aboard the pretty accuruate reconstruction of the Jupiter 2 - in full character and costume.  The late great Johnathan Harris shows he can still play Dr. Smith to a tee.  While its a shame he did not live to participate in the ""Voyage Home"" TV movie, this is the next best thing seeing these memorable characters give it one last show.  Also interesting is the ""making of"" segment showing the filming of the final segment.  No serious Lost in Space should be without having this DVD.",1045872000,15,670,4.467213114754099
1347075,3,B00004S896,"It seems a shame that such an enjoyable series has often been treated so poorly overall. The main problem with this retrospective is that John Laroquette, who has nothing at all to do with ""Lost in Space"" is our host. It's also a shame that many other cast members from the original series did not make an appearance on this special.
... Perhaps it was a way to remind folks about the theatrical version which was mostly a flop at the box office.
I enjoy watching ""Lost in Space"" and so as a viewer it would have been great to see the original cast members sitting down discussing the show and interesting tidbits that went on while showing clips from the series. Unfortunately, that's not what happened.
The most enjoyable part of the DVD in my opinion was seeing Will, Dr. Smith and the robot together in character at the end. It was a short scene, but it did show that nobody missed a beat with their characters even after all these years.
The ""Bonus Footae"" became quite boring after awhile. Unfortunately there was no sound and it was just long, overly-extended scenes of the cyclops giant, the chariot, and the Jupiter 2. However, the bonus of Guy Williams being interviewed by Irwin Allen was indeed worth watching. The third bonus of getting the set together for the Jupiter 2 when Will, the robot, and Dr. Smith do their final skit at the end of the show was also a treat.
If you enjoy ""Lost in Space"", this is one of the few specials you can find on the subject so it's the best we can do. I have heard that the DVD called 'The fantasy worlds of Irwin Allen' is a better retrospective of the series. ...BR>Finally, with the recent death of Jonathan Harris, it is nice to see his final appearance as Dr. Smith captured forever. I have to say that Mr. Harris truly made ""Lost in Space"" more enjoyable.",1045094400,38,1809,4.451807228915663
1347076,5,B00004S896,"I loved this special. Never saw it when it originally aired, but this DVD is fantastic. It's Nostalgic and a great 'making of' - of a very popular 60's TV show.
A small narrative with a lot of screen tests, behind the scenes, costume design, creature making and props building. Also there are Bloopers and an added commentary by most of the original cast on their roles, getting hired and working with each other.
Even Bill Mummy (Will Robinson) and Johnathan Harris (Dr. Zachary Smith) do a cameo by recreating their roles 30 years later. Extremely fun!
If you were a fan of the original series, you got to have this!
""Danger Will Robinson, Danger""!",1023235200,7,650,4.660869565217391
1347077,5,B00004S896,"What a tepid treat this DVD is. Packed with all the frolicky fun and silly scenes from many of the earlier series, this DVD delivers. The music of early John Williams is all here too, hinting at the genius scores he was yet to create. Like most DVD's there are plenty of surprises, like unshown footage of cheesy monsters and tricky gadgets. There is a modern ""play-act"" scene with an Adult Will Robinson, and an even MORE adult Dr. Smith and the Robot. All reenact the campiness that gave the original it's camp status. It's a great trip through space nostalgia and an obvious precursor to Star Trek. Also included is the eerie screen test for Guy Williams. Eerie, in that, he seems to be holding all the male set crewmen with heavy eye-contact during the test. You'd have to see it to believe it, but what was he doing? Hmmmm. That cigarette sure lasted a long time! Lots of Supplemental features. Enjoy!",1002672000,2,906,4.564417177914111
1347078,5,B00004S896,"This DVD really brings out the best of LIS.  Although the second and third seasons were not the best (although they still had some good episodes) the first season was undoubtly the best.  I would hope they release this monumental series out on DVD.  I consider the first season black and white episodes to be almost flawless.  This DVD really is fascinating and provides also a lot of stock footage of special effects shots.  Nearly an hour of chariot, jupiter II and other footage is seen.  I recomend it heavily.  Once again, Kevin Burns and the LIS cast and crew have done it again.",994896000,7,585,4.5673076923076925
1347079,4,B00004S896,"This is a must have for all Lost in Space fans. While it could have been much longer, it does have plenty of memorable scenes and moments of Lost in Space. The short episode with ""guest stars"" at the end is the  icing on the cake. Good job. Let's just pray that there will be a Lost in  Space II so it can live ""forever.""",964915200,10,321,3.923076923076923
1347080,3,B00004S896,"Andy Spletzers review suggests to me that he was not 8 years old in 1968. He is missed the magic of it totally. His review is is definately one of a kind, his. All things considered it was decent just not enough stills and  discussion with cast members and to much about the sixties in general.",961545600,3,294,4.25
1347081,5,B00004S896,"I taped this when it was on channel 32. For all you youngsters out there, Fox is the movie company which originally aired Lost In Space. This special is filled with interviews by the stars, Johnathan Harris, Bill Mumy, June  Lockhart, & Mark Godard etc. Plus clips, out takes, and special effects  shots of the jupiter 2 miniatures & More.
