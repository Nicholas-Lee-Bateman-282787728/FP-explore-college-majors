Their live show is a heady mix of sensual music, sharp dressing, intense video projection and clever stage choreography. A Gotan Project show is a total sensual experience, enhanced by the stunningly evocative visuals of Prisca Lobjoy, whose work as Gotan Project's artistic director has played an integral part in shaping the Gotan aesthetic right from the start.
