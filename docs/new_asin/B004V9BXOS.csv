8443111,5,B004V9BXOS,Love this double feature two movies in one and who doesn't love a young Elizabeth taylor,1472774400,,88,4.5625
8443112,1,B004V9BXOS,"As other reviewers have stated, terrible transfer of both films.  Life with Father was originally a color movie but it is in black and white here, and very dim.",1469318400,,160,4.517241379310345
8443113,1,B004V9BXOS,"The movies are first rate and both treasures but the sound on them, especially life with Father is just awful, almost unintelligible.
Look for a better transfer.  These classics deserve remastering and much better sound.",1458864000,,220,5.285714285714286

8443115,1,B004V9BXOS,"I completely agree with everything stated in the only other review for this product. The sound quality is poor, the print is poor. Even for the low price, it is not worth your money or the disappointment in seeing and hearing two classics distorted.",1403913600,5,249,4.681818181818182
8443116,1,B004V9BXOS,"While thease are great classic movies the transfer of them is terrible the picture quality is sub par at best and the sound is even worse!! I had to turn the volume all the way up on my tv on ""Fathers Little Dividend"" just to hear the sound and even then it was fading in and out and on ""Life With Father"" more of the same only the sound was so distorded you couldent even make out what was being said. Thease classic movies deserve better than this I am replaceing them with the DIGICOM copies.",1329609600,17,495,4.166666666666667
