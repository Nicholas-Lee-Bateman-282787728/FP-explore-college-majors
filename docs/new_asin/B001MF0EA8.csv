8321072,5,B001MF0EA8,"As I already own several ""Nozze"", I bought this DVD mainly because of Erwin Schrott and was not disappointed. I'm so glad that he is sort-of ""upcoming"" and am looking forward to many more operas in which he will sing.
The production, although updated, is fortunately avoiding Eurotrash - something to which I am as allergic as the best. Judicious updating can throw a new light on a production, especially when most of the new ideas work, as they do here.
Definitely a much enjoyed addition to the rest of my ""Nozze"".",1357689600,,517,4.630434782608695
8321073,5,B001MF0EA8,"If you're seeking a ""traditional"" production of Le Nozze di Figaro, I can tell you ""why not!"" This is a dramatically eccentric mis-en-scene, on the edge of trying-too-hard bizarre but extremely well sung. Please notice that amazon has fuddled the reviews once again; several of the low-star reviews herewith are not of this DVD at all but pertain to a different production, one I haven't seen, starring Daniela de Niese. Susanna in this production is sung by Martina Jankova, la Contessa by Malin Hartelius, and Marcellina by Irene Friedli. All three female leads sing extremely well, and Hartelius is arguably the best Contessa you'll ever hear. Add Judith Schmid as the love-striken lad Cherubino, and you have an outstanding ""upper register"" for the rendition of Mozart's score.

Erwin Schrott sings Figaro. His portrayal, both musically and theatrically, offers a variant interpretation from the usual. Schrott's Figaro is a ""hunk"" of a man, again both vocally and theatrically. He's not the clever Figaro of Beaumarchais or of most Mozart/Rossini stagings. In fact, he's a little dim; he needs plenty of handling by the women in his life. None of his schemes prove helpful. It's Susanna, the Countess, and surprisingly Marcellina who pull Figaro's chestnuts out of the fire.

The wildest variant from traditional productions, however, is the portrayal of Conte Almaviva, sung here by Michael Volle. This Almaviva is pure slapstick, an upper-class fop, a wouldbe magician, a lecher as hapless as any in a Marx Brothers film. Volle sings much of his role in a silk bathrobe. You'll either hate this portrayal or tolerate it for the sake of the music. As I said before, Why Not?

If you've already figured out that this is a Nozze which aims for laughs above all, you're a clever reader. The minor characters -- Bartolo sung by Carlos Chausson, Basilio sung by Martin Zysset, and Barbarina sung by Eva Liebau -- are pure vaudeville. Barbarina is a sex-crazed airhead who can hardly keep her knees together. All three are indeed ludicrously funny. If you find their antics ""over the top,"" well, you'd best stick with traditional productions.

Conductor Franz Welser-M&ouml;st is impeccable in his choice of tempi and his musical accord with the foolishness on stage. The singers are equipped with radio-microphones, a technology that has become more or less standard. The results are excellent in terms of balance between orchestra and voices.

If you've never seen/heard Le Nozze di Figaro -- there must be a few people who haven't -- or even if you've heard/seen it only once either live or on DVD, you might be wise to choose a traditional production first.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Le-nozze-di-Figaro-The-Marriage-of-Figaro-Jean-Pierre-Vincent--Paolo-Olmi-G-Furlanetto--Szymtka-Op-eacute-ra-National-de-Lyon/dp/B00005NGAB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Le nozze di Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro) / Jean-Pierre Vincent  Paolo Olmi - G.

There is some reoccurrence of singers between the operas:

ROBERTO ACCURSO is Antonio in Figaro and Masetto in Goivanni.
MAITE BEAUMONT is Cherubino in Figaro and Dorabella in Cosi.
MARIO LUPERI is Bartolo in Figaro and Commendatore in Giovanni.
GARRY MAGEE is Count Almaviva in Figaro and Don Alfonso in Cosi.
CHARLOTTE MARGIONE is Marcelina in Figaro an Donna Elvira in Giovanni.
DANIELLE DE NIESE is Susanna in Figaro and Despina in Giovanni.
LUCA PISARONI is Figaro in Figaro and Guglielmo in Cosi.
MERCEL REIJANS is Don Basilio in Figaro and Don Ottavio in Giovanni.
NORMAN SHANKLE is Don Curzio in Figaro and Fernando in Cosi.

The remaining singers are:

CORA BURGGRAAF is Zerlina in Giovanni.
CELIA COSTEA is Countess Almaviva in Figaro.
JOSE FARDDIHA is Leporello in Giovanni.
SALLY MATTHEWS is Fiordiligi in Cosi.
MYTRO PAPATANASIU is Donna Anna in Giovanni.
FLOOR VAN DER SLUIS is Babarina in Figaro.
PIETRO SPAGNOLI is Don Giovanni in Giovanni.
MELANIE GREVE and FANG FANG KONG are the First and Second Ladies in Figaro.

The singers are generally very good, well worth listening to. They are good actors as well. There is the added bonus that they physically match the roles they play, except Maite Beaumont in the trouser role of Cherubino. Her singing and acting are fine, but it is impossible to make her look like a man.

Some serious problems arose with the nontraditional staging. Cosi worked the best, Figaro broke down at the end, and Giovanni was a disaster throughout.

Cosi Fan Tutte was supposed to be set in a youth hostel. The revolving stage took us from room to room as the plot unfolded. It worked, mostly. There were the usual difficulties of staging a story outside its intended scenery. For example, the principles attended a dance party, while completely inappropriate music was playing.

Le Nozze Di Figaro was staged in a car dealership, which remained as the only staging. This worked to some degree, but the entrances and exits of the singers sometimes seemed bizarre without the appropriate changes in scenery. The garden scene near the end was shown on a black and white closed circuit television screen. It was fuzzy and confusing. Viewers who were unfamiliar with the story would have been bewildered. The television was a bad idea which should have been abandoned.

Don Giovanni was a travesty. The staging consisted of beds which the singers climbed in and out of. At the end of the opera, the beds moved around the stage. Often, singers who were not part of a scene remained on stage. Don Ottavio often caressed a doll, which was a replica of Donna Anna. Anyone who did not know the story would have missed much of the plot line. This production reminded me of something schoolboys might devise who wanted to mock an opera. All this was too bad, because the singers came to perform. Pietro Spagnoli was the most villainous Don Giovanni I've seen.

I can recommend Cosi, and Figaro with serious reservations, but not Giovanni. But there are so many worthy productions of Figaro and Giovanni, why bother, unless it's for the performers? Or if you happen to enjoy opera being trashed.",1351641600,,4076,5.702970297029703
8321075,4,B001MF0EA8,"Yes. A perfect countess in Malin Hartelius. Bravo Malin. Comparable with the best.
Figaro (Schrott) and Susanna (Jankova) are simply marvelous too. Excellent rendition and equally good acting and interpretation of the characters.
The Count (Volle) is quite up to the mark, although I wish he was not(forced by the director?) made to act like more of a comic than his position or role in the opera would suggest. Sure Mozart in his age would never have dared portray him as a two bit magician and a bit daft. A little tiresome on stage at times, but singing? Excellent.
I cant say I was too impressed with Cherubino (Judit Schmid) who seems to become suddenly inaudible in tiny patches in her most vaunted numbers. Marcellina, Bartolo, Basilio and Barbarina were average but fitted in quite well with the rest on the stage.
Welser-Most has done a decent job with the orchestra and so have the post production people... Clear picture with the aspect ratio of 16:9

The disappointment for me was the 4th act, where the staging is quite clumsy, and a dose of what borders on slapstick has been exaggerated... may look good on stage for a performance, but on a DVD could get pretty tiresome when watched over and over. The one star I have deducted was for this.",1282867200,4,1256,4.683257918552036
8321076,1,B001MF0EA8,"I purchased this disk for one reason and one reason only: Amazon lists the delightful British soprano Sally Matthews, who captured my heart in Gianni Schicchi and Alice, as one of the performers. Well she isn't. Unless she's hiding in a car trunk. So what did I get? A Eurotrash production of an operatic masterpiece set in an auto dealership. If you're going to stage an opera in an auto dealership, Electra would be the best choice since Buick made one. But I should have been more cautious when I saw it was De Nederlandse Opera who undoubtedly have a performance in the works of Aida with the Grand March set in the checkout line at Walmart or Billy Budd set in Captain Verve's bathtub. This is actually a good performance featuring singers who can sing and act and musicians who can play if you can get over the ludicrously ridiculous staging. I have numerous recording of Figaro and this one goes on the bottom of the stack.",1273881600,4,930,4.541666666666667
8321077,3,B001MF0EA8,"I have watched many videos of this terrific Mozart-Da Ponte opera, including having 20 in my personal collection.  I have seen it about 6 times in performance as well.  So there is not a lot new that can be done, here.  Still, a very solid production has its own merits.  Which this one does, until the disastrous last act.

Starting with the strengths, they must go to Daniele de Niese and Luca Pisaroni as Susanna and Figaro.  Their interplay is marvelous. In fact, the opening intraduzione three small numbers is perhaps the best I have seen.  They are very young, eagerly in love, while he is distracted with the Count's business (more on that anon).  VERY well done.

The opera is updated to modern times, set in a car dealership owned by the Count, with his living quarters above the business.  Figaro is his business manager. All of this works fine. I do NOT have a problem with doing modern era productions of classic era operas, with the understanding that some things just do not translate (referring to Almaviva as his ""Lord"").  That problem is par for the course, unless you radically change the text, which most productions don't.  It works just fine, for the most part.

The real disaster is the last act, when there are strange goings on ""in the garden"".  This is where Susanna is due to meet the amorous Count, when he is, in fact, met by his wife disguised as Susanna.  And Figaro gets jealous, and mayhem ensues, etc etc.

The problem, is that, in an effort, I assume, to be ""modern"" and ""different"" the garden activities are shown by closed circuit cameras on a large video screen which we saw previously at the end of the first Act.  It is too much.  Virtually the entire last 20 minutes is shown on this black and white 4-part video screen.  It is out of focus, too disjointed, and a complete mess.  It is, in fact, completely unwatchable!!  I skipped to the end.

So, an entertaining production and performance is your for 80% of the show, but the ending is terrible. What a shame.",1266710400,7,2003,4.551820728291316
8321078,5,B001MF0EA8,"This is the first Figaro I have heard, starting with the 1934 Glyndebourne recording, where the Countess, with all her conflicted emotions, gets a perfect rendition.  I have come to expect great insights from Malin Hartelius, but this performance exceeded my expectations.  Her dramatic performance in no way compromised her musical accuracy,at any time.  She has given every phrase her full attention, in the best tradition of lieder singing.  The audience responded with long applause.

Michael Volle, as the Count, also pleased.  He is a good bit more dramatic than Rodney Gilfry on the Gardiner DVD.  Hillevi Martinpelto,  the countess on the Gardiner DVD, is very reserved in the solos, but comes alive in the ensembles.

The remaining singers are about equal on both these DVDs,  which brings me to the conductors.  Welser-Most offers a beautiful subjective interpretation with flexible tempi that never drag or race.  Gardiner gives an ideal performance according to HIP standards.  I enjoy both.

Staging is another matter.  The Gardiner is staged by Jean Louis Thamin, minimalist but traditional.  This new production staged by Sven-Eric Bechtolf is sexually highly charged, although I did not spot any nudity.  Every possible Freudian reference is fully exploited.  At first I rebelled, but watching this a second time, I began to see some value in this.  Unlike Bechtolf's Rosenkavalier and Don Giovanni, the added action is more focussed.  In other words, this action while a bit hyper, does add to the comprehension of the story. As I write this, Cleveland Ohio critics are giving the, very similar, Severance Hall performances great reviews.  If you don't accept Mozart's ""potty mouth"" childish side, you may want to avoid this DVD and get the Gardiner one.",1238112000,9,1771,5.187279151943463
8321079,4,B001MF0EA8,"This is Schrott's second Figaro in a less than twelve month period, the earlier being the ROH production. The two productions have vast differences as well as similarities. The ROH production as been set in the equivalent of the Regency period--Spanish version. The Zurich is set in what appears to be the 1950's. For those who note such things, Schrott can appear sans shirt, but in an undershirt in the Zurich house. Vocally there is no difference between the two performances. The man has a glorious multi-hued voice over which he has complete command. Not only is he good looking he can act. He should have a great career. Indeed, the virile sound he produces would lead one to wonder if the great Verdi baritone roles are within his ability.

The other main vocalist is Malin Hartelius, the Countessa. She has developed from a Pamina lyric to a patrician lyric who one day will make a superb Marschallin. In fact Ms. Hartelius is the only countessa who is able to make the class distinction between Susanna and Rosina--not since Schwarzkopf has there been a singer who understands this social division.

The remaining singers, Martina Jovanka (Susanna) Michael Volle (Count) and Judith Schmid (Cherubino) are good if not quite comparable to their counterparts at ROH. My main complaint with this production is the variable sonics: the harpsichord accompanying the recits is barely audible for much of the time. This is most annoying since this is a problem which surely could have been corrected before the DVD was released.

Which Figaro to choose? This new Zurich prodcution will win no plaudits from me. Sven-Eric Bechtolf is responsible for some bizarre productions at Zurich, notably the Rosenkavalier and Pelleas. The Figaro is almost a model of conservatism but not of imagination--budgetary constraints? The ROH production is far more opulent. The most beautiful production is the Rene Jacobs' performance. The weakness in that set is the Countessa, Annette Dasch, more of a Susanna than a Rosina. The John Eliot Gardiner boasts the same weakness. These two performances are HIP if that is a consideration. Because it is so reasonbly priced the first Glyndebourne performance should be in everyone's collection, if only for the great performance of Von Stade's early Cherubino, a role she owned for many years. The second Glyndebourne is very good, but Renee Fleming lacks the magic that she can be capable of. Bottom line: no one performance has all the virtues that one looks for, but then that is true of most DVD's.",1236038400,12,2532,4.995260663507109
