Although I love the other he did much more.",1328054400,,301,4.472727272727273
8296116,3,B001E25MH4,"Good music, really high energy upbeat cardio.  The moves were hard to get for me the first time, but I'm sure as I use it I can get the hang of it. At least it's in the privacy of my own home!  I started off doing it without the arms, and not adding in the jumps.  But as I get fitter I know that I will get more benefits from it.
  The guy that leads it unhelpfully keeps suggesting that this will help get you into your bikini, or that you will look great in it. But, you can at least turn the commentary off once you are done with needing instructions. I'm going to stick with it a few weeks and hopefully be ready for the advanced moves! Thats the good thing about this, there is room to advance if you're average fitness.
I recommend this if you are average fitness or above, like high energy workouts, and enjoy Ministry of Sound Music.
A note for fans of previous Ministry of Sound workout videos, they've changed from Deanne Berry to another guy.  I've heard from the UK amazon crowd that he's not as good, so I'll try some of the older ones next.",1256428800,,1055,4.147058823529412
