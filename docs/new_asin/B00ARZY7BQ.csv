If your familiar with PM Entertainment you get 3 great PM Ent. flicks in this bundle and all are awesome ya get Repo Jake, Last Man Standing and Maximum Force.  Only one that seems a bit out of place here was dusk till dawn as most of these[while entertaining] are low budget action flix but it is nice to have that one in the bunch. Im assuming they included it, to coincide with Rob Rodriguez's Road Racers which was also a pretty cool flik.  Anyways just for those 4 films i mentioned this is worth a purchase.  Qaulity is also very good on all of these films.  Its a 2 DVD set with 4 films on each disc just fyi.  If yer looking for a good lazy way to spend yer weekend ya cant go wrong with this pack of flix,will keep ya entertained all the way to monday",1472256000,,799,4.057324840764331
