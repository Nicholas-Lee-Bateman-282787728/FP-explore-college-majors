I love how the character devolpment is not to fast nor too slow. It  is just right. The characters are well balanced, and the animations are  incredible. The battles are wonderful and provide a nice challenge, for all  the mon. BUY THIS VIDEO!",941673600,,395,4.24
1093371,5,6305951500,"This video is how Digimon started. Don't get Digimon mixed up with Pokemon and Monster Rancher. They may seem the same but they are definitly different. Compared to others, this series ROCKS!",941500800,,191,5.0
1093372,5,6305951500,"I frankly haven't seen the video, but I have seen all the shows on it. They are filled with beautifully strung animation and great voice overs. One of the things you'll love about digimon is that you can't wait for the next  digi-volution. I put this video as one of the best for people that like  anime without all of the adult content.",939859200,,337,4.333333333333333
1093499,5,6305951500,"I, too, haven't baught this video but rather saw the episodes when they aired on TV years ago. After reading the Editorial Review (by Doug Thomas) I was appalled. To say Digimon is a ripoff of Pok&eacute;mon is completely ridiculous. I would compare it to saying General Hospital is a ""ripoff"" of E.R. simply because they both feature doctors, patients, and drama. One privy to Japanese culture would know hat ""-mon"" was a small trend in the world of Anime.

Overall, I find Digimon to be more compelling and emotional. The main kids (called the Digidestined) develop a deep, emotional bond with their Digimon which doesn't become fully apparent until the last episode. The first season has 54 episodes, and is easily one of the best in the entire Digimon universe. If one hasn't seen the first few episodes, they might find it difficult to understand the dynamics of this great show. Filled with action, suspense, drama, and insanely humorous jokes (their unsuspected dryness adds to the humor) made by villains, Digimon remains one of my favorite animes, along with Cowboy Bebop and Fullmetal Alchemist. And for that, I give it 5 out of a possible 5.",1134864000,,1152,4.847715736040609
1093500,2,6305951500,I'm sorry But I just had a hard time enjoying this season.  After a few episodes I just stopped watching digimon for a long time. This was a complete dissapointment for me. I liked the original digi mon better. Now it's just some card game come to life! It's just all wrong. I put in a second star for animation It's excelent. But the storyline it just ugh... You may enjoy it if your a hard core digimon fan. like I said I just had a tough time enjoying it.,1088294400,2,458,4.088888888888889
1093501,4,6305951500,"In my opinion, there's really no need to debate on how good Digimon is (specifically, Season 3).
Analyzing the animation itself, you're offered good quality, and 2nd-rate 3D parts (the Digivolving).
If you're all down with that, and you're still having trouble enjoying it, maybe the storyline is the cause. I consider the storyline of Digimon Tamers much better than Pokemon, and after comparing both shows, it's not hard to determine which one fisplays more originality. This can't be the problem.
The only real thing that can be found fault with Digimon (taking this tape, and the entire existence into consideration) is the American-dubbed versions.
Like most Japenese-to-American animes (but not all), the dialouge is frequently overdone - overly dramatic, too hyped-up, cheesy phrases, etc.
Still, if you're a Digimon fan, there's no real need to debate. I enjoyed Season 3 over Seasons 1, 2, and 4, so it's easy for me to rate it over the others.
I suggest against reviewing this negatively if you're not even interested in buying; Digimon fans who are willing to (buy) won't pay critics much notice.",1081209600,3,1107,5.054644808743169

1093503,3,6305951500,"It seems that Disney/Buena Vista skipped quite a few episodes when they released this. Being the second video(Where's the DVD's of these things???) in the Digimon Tamers series, I expected this to have episodes 5,6, and 7 on this. Unfortunately for whatever reason, Disney decided to skip ALL the way to the episode where the Devas begin to appear. So those who haven't see Digimon Tamers when it was on Fox or UPN and decide to get this video, be warned, for it skips a few crucial episodes.
 But anyway, there are three episodes on this video instead of four like they did on the first video. Nonetheless, these are more action-packed episodes compared to the ones Disney previously released. Especially with the impending invasion of the Devas. The first episode(They didn't even title the episodes again!) begins with Yamaki firing up his Juggernaut system, which is basically a 'vacuum' that attracts and destroys all digital beings, namely the Digimon. Unfortunately Yamaki's program fails, and in brilliant irony, Juggernaut actually becomes a gateway for some menacing creatures called 'Devas'.
The first of which, resembles a tiger, and begins to face-off against Takato, Rika, and Henry.
In the second episode on the video, strange happenings start to occur in the subways of Japan as some strange creature with red glowing eyes slithers around in search of humans to eliminate. Luckily Takato decides to start up a search party for the Devas, so the menace in the subways won't have it easy, right? Well, with Rika at a japanese play, and Henry busy with his own ordeals, how will he be able to find this intruder on his own?
And on the third episode, Takato and Henry go camping with their school, and Guilmon, Terriermon, and Calumon tag along too(There's quite the hillarious moments while they try to keep hidden from the adults). Things seem alright, that is, until all of Japan's electricity goes out for some reason.
Either way, if you like your Digimon with action and mystery, you might as well check this one out if you've never seen the episodes before on TV.",1052265600,3,2081,4.878531073446328
1093504,5,6305951500,"I love Digimon! I was thinking they can keep on making more Digimon for Seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4 for VHS. We should keep making viedos of starting with Season 1 Digimon (Vol. 5) and have three or four episodes. If you all like Digimon and if you want to get the whole seasons, then write back if we can talk them into making more animated Digimon for the Fox Kids and UPN TV hit series!",1040083200,,384,4.0
1093505,5,6305951500,"The first poster was way off in describing the video. Too bad it's just going to drag the score down. The story is this:
A powerful program called the ""Juggernaut"" is sucking Digimon into a vacuum, and it's unleashed a nasty group of Digital Monsters- the Devas. Angry that Digimon are being tamed on Earth, the Devas intend to cause trouble!
Although their data appears scrambled on the Tamer's D-Poer, there's no mistaking the Devas! First Mihiroman, a tiger-like Deva, appears in town, and one by one, the Tamer's overtake him with the help of their Digimon. Then Sinduramon, a bizarre part-animal, part-machine- looking deva takes over a subway train. And when the kids try to enjoy a well earned camping vacation, a bird-like Deva, Sanduramon, shows up at the campsite! Having swallowed all the city's electricity, he's looking for more!
It's time for Guilmon to digivolve again and save the day. But even if he does, are there more Devas to come?
That's straight off the box information. While this movie was suppose to be something big, i found it to be just like the series but just linked together. Not a bad flick cause their are alot of humorous parts in it. If your a Digimon fan, check it out. If your new to it, check the first videos first.",1033344000,7,1255,4.657657657657658
1093506,5,6305951500,"sorry about the unusefull stuff before. The first episode is
when the tiger deva attacks and Growlmon digivolves into
Wargrowlmon for the first time. I kinda like this episode because
Takato faints and dreams he's with Growlmon. So they have this talk but then he wakes up holding Calumon's arm and then he says
""Did you know you talk in your sleep.""The next episode is when
the evil snake deva appears in the underground subway(where else
are there subways.)to attack the tamers so while Takato and Guilmon are having fun with their new friends Rika and Henry are
both fighting for their lives. Until Impmon shows up and tells Takato were his friends are. Then the next one is when Takato
and his scoolmates go on a little feild trip to a lake.
There they are having a blast until the rooster deva shows up. Then they try to keep this a secret from the digimon. Only
to get their digimon hurt after having a chase from Impmon. So they end up having to follow the rooster,have a big fight then it's over. In case your wondering This one is my favorite episode and I didn't buy the movie,I just saw it at a little girl's
birthday party. Thats why now I'm telling it to you so you won't have to buy this movie for no reason. I like it so I'm going to buy it.",1032912000,2,1256,4.326271186440678
1093593,4,6305951500,"...I like this movie--I'm glad that someone had the sense to put the episodes into a film.  The voices are slightly different than they are later in the season, (probably because the voice actors are just getting used to their parts) but that doesn't change the overall effectivness of the video.
The characters are fun, the Digimon are interesting, and the Digiworld and Digivices are intriguing.  The common prefix 'Digi' may seem tiresome at first, but you'll grow to get used to it. (I think...)
All in all, I think that this is a decent example of anime and a good beginning to the Digimon show.",1023667200,2,600,4.650943396226415
1093594,5,6305951500,"They state that digimon is a rip-off of Pokemon, when it is really Pokemon that is a rip-off of digimon! Digimon was created in the 80's as a virtual-pet type game, but did not gain real popularity until the early 90's, when animator TOEI decided to create a TV show out of it. By than GameFreaks saw digimon becoming popular so they decided to create a new game for the GBC, and would launch a worldwide phenominom!  As the first season was getting ready to launch its TV show Digimon in 1994, it met with financial troubles, and could not find anyone to help support the show, so they gave up on it. The creators of Pokemon now saw a huge opportunity for themselves to release the show pokemon, and they did and became a worldwide hit. 2 years later TOEI had finnaly made enough money, and realeased a short Digimon movie in Japanese theaters(20 minutes long, and was the first part in the Digimon Movie in the USA). It became very popular, so they released it on tv and it became a huge success! Digimon in Japan is aimed at young-adults and in America it is aimed at kids(season 1) pre-teens(season 2) and teens(season 3) and from what I have seen from the Japanese season 4(Digimon Frontier), and from how much the other seasons when coming to the USA were edited, I'd say that this season is probably aimed at pre-teens. ...Well anyway... this is a very good item and I recomend it for any digimon fan.",1020643200,5,1408,4.457364341085271
1093595,5,6305951500,"I disagree with [...people who say] that this is a ripoff of Pokemon. Digimon is definitely NOT a ripoff of Pokemon. Pokemon has trainers collecting the Pokemon, and the 'enemies' are people; in Digimon, each child is partnered with a certain digimon, and they can never have more than one. Plus, with Pokemon, the evolutions are permanent; with Digimon, the ""digivolution""s are not permanent (not even close). Also, with Digimon, the 'enemies' are other Digimon.

1093596,5,6305951500,"Ok first, It is not a rip-off for lots of reasons, Here are 2 of them
1) in the first episode one of the digidestended asked Agumon if he was a pokemon.
2) Digimon is made by the same people who made pokemon so how can it be a ripoff for goodness sake?
This is a very inspiring series and is basically for higher age viewers, since pokemon is intended for younger folk, because Digimon wasn't afraid to show death or anything like that... So I don't see what all the fuss is about...",997833600,2,483,4.148936170212766

The relationships:
Tai and Sora: I agree. Tai and Mimi: I...uh... Matt and Mimi: I don't agree. Joe and Mimi: a little bit. Izzy and Mimi: I don't know.

1093599,2,6305951500,I must say at first i hated Digimon but when the series went longer into the story i started to like it. It is a very good show and i think it is way better then pokemon. This show is for more grown up kids while pokemon is for little babies.,974592000,,242,3.764705882352941

Well, I'll just talk about these videos.  It shows a great introduction to the series, with seven characters sent out to try and save the digital and the real world (frankly I think that seven is a little much).  It shows you the personalities of the characters, and the ever-so-cool transformations, or 'Digivolving' scenes when the Digimon increase their attack power and size.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the series, it gets much better later on!",973296000,7,698,4.898305084745763
1093671,5,6305951500,"Like Marielle from USA, I too have only seen Digimon on tv.  First, I'd like to say that I used to be a fan of Pokemon.  At first the cards were  really cool, the episodes on tv were pretty cool too.  But as it went on,  the cards became collectibles, the cartoon got worse by the episode.  There  was no development whatsoever.  I thought in order to become a Pokemon  Master Ash had to ""catch 'em all"" but that wasn't the case.  Then  there's team rocket.  ""We're blasting off again!""  that part got  so irritating!  It was the same thing over and over again.  Like others,  when I first saw Digimon I thought it was a rip off of Pokemon but I bet if  Digimon came out first Pokemon would have seemed so lame.  I see Digimon in  a different way now.  It's a series I would actually buy.  It's so much  better than Pokemon!  The characters, the endless number of digimon, the  story line, everything!  The story actually developes as the characters  meet new enemies and discover more about the Digital World.  You learn more  and more about the characters as they go through emotional problems.  Even  though there are 7(and later8) character development is not left out.  There were many times when it became so suspenseful, I almost wanted to  build a time machine to travel to next Saturday.  I'm not saying Digimon is  totally perfect though.  It may get a little confusing or boring at times  but overall it's an action packed, adventurous, dramatic, humourous,  addicting series that's suited for the whole family.",968112000,3,1522,4.582706766917293
1093672,4,6305951500,"Chronologically, digimon actually came BEFORE pokemon, but since most  everyone doesn't know this, they consider it a ripoff of pokemon. By itself  it is a pretty decent series and is in some ways much gooder than pokemon  for instance you don't have to worry about your opponent's type as much as  you do their level.
Everyone should see both series and see wich one they  like for themselvs, after all, both are very similar but there's also many  differences, for instance all digis can talk in a human manor, the pokemon  only have a few that can speak in a human manner. don't get me wrong, I  like pokemon too, but i like digimon better.",966384000,3,643,4.530434782608696
1093673,5,6305951500,"Ok, so the first time I watched Digimon I wanted to strangle the artists because of the oversized hands and feet, but you get used to it. The normal anime plot of saving the world takes on an interesting Magic Knight  Rayearth type twist where the world in question is an alternate world. The  plot progresses and becomes more clear as time goes on, and more exiting.  It realisticly displays life with Matt's divorced family, and Izzy being  adopted. It's not all perfect familys with no problems. The digimon  themselves are sweet and cute. The object of this show is not to entertain  the little ones with happy go lucky stuff. The 7 friends all have faults  which make them more interesting. You watch their friendship grow along  with their personality.

Digimon is more deep, especially with each of their Crests that stand for their most powerful inner strengths: Courage, Friendship, Knowledge, Love, Sincerity, Hope, Reliability, and Light.  Every episode, there's a new story, and the friends grow closer together every day.  Also, there are family relations, like how one of them is adopted, and his parents didn't tell them.  I hafta admit though, the first coupla eps are pretty boring, but they get more exciting and more deep as the story goes on, especially when they're back on Earth during the Story of the Eigth Child.

I think they're both great shows. I used to be really into  Pokemon but after a while (especially when Brock left the show) it got  kinda boring. I think the older episodes are way better.
Later on, I got  into Monster Rancher and I really liked the plot of the show about the kid  being in a video game. It's a pretty good show but kinda boring.
Then  when I saw the first episode of digimon, I though it was a little childish  and I didn't really get the idea but after a while it began to really grow  on me. Especially in the newer episodes when they get back to the real  world. Now I've seen every episode and watch the show everyday! Almost  everyone here agrees that Digimon definately did NOT copy Pokemon (and  there's so many things to prove it) All three shows are great but I have to  recommend Digimon as the best show!
By the way, if all those people that  wrote the reviews were in a Digimon chat room it would neat to hear  everyone's opinion. Does anyone know any Digimon chatrooms?  If you do  e-mail me at teresa275@excite.com

If you don't believe me, then give Poke'mon Stadium  a try. Poke'mon is also for younger kids. I'm not saying that both  teenagers (or preteens, whatever you call'em) and little kids can't watch  it, but the fact is that poke'mon isn't as deep as digimon. Digimon is  about saving the world, not winning badges. After a while, I just forgot  about poke'mon because digimon was just more apealing to me. I'm twelve and  I WATCH DIGIMON EVERY SINGLE DAY. BUT: that doesn't mean I hate poke'mon.  Don't judge two completely different shows. If you think the animation is  better in digimon, fine. But would someone who had been a poke'mon fan  since the show first came out say the same thing? Digimon is easy to relate  to because its about kids our age. It IS kinda hard to tell exactly how old  the digidestined are, but you can tell that they aren't a bunch of ten year  olds. Don't get me wrong, little kids can love digimon too, but I have a  feeling they get more attached to it for different reasons. Digimon is  flashy with its computer tweeking and colorful animation, but it isn't  cheezy or empty by any means. There are some scenes in digimon that are  really...Well, they certainly aren't CHEEZY!  I know that didn't make  sense, but I'm not here to brag about digimon. All I'm asking is that if  you think poke'mon beats digimon hands down, you don't have to say it so  insultingly. That is why I am only posting one opinion: I think Digimon has  it right in terms of realistic characters and beautiful animation, but if  what you people are saying is that digimon should be as popular as  poke'mon, let me warn you. If digimon becomes as well known as poke'mon,  they will commercialize it, and then it WILL be cheezy. Be glad that people  think its just a rip off, because then they'll just leave digimon alone and  won't ruin it with commercialization.  Also, I have a message for  ""Flares"": I completely agree with you about Matt, but I'm way to  embarrassed about it to say it out loud.

Digimon is not a rip-off, it's one of the best anime  ever. Why? Well, the animation rules, MUCH better than Pokemon. Also, it  actually has a plot for goodness sakes!

Also, there are zillions of  character relationship theroies, like TaixSora (very obvious), IzzyxMimi  (very popular, although I don't agree), JoexMimi (this I do agree with),  MattxMimi (err...yuck), TaixMatt (the famous Taito), SoraxMimi (not very  popular), and TKxKari (they go together!)
If you want great anime,  check out Digimon. I have this tape, and watch Digimon everyday on Fox  Kids. Here are my ratings for each ep:
And so it begins...-Okay ep. We  get to see a basic overview of all the characters' personalities. I thought  it was a little rushed, but that's just me. I'd rate it a 3
The Birth of  Greymon-The telephone scene is hilarious. I love it! And Shellmon's pretty  cool. Plus we get to see a lil more characterization. I'll rate this a  4.5

Garurumon-Excellent! Good dialouge between Matt and Tai (but  they're FULL brothers, Yamato and Takeru! Not half! Dub error...) and  awesome battle. Garurumon rules! Definate 5.
Well, to sum it up, GET  THIS VIDEO RIGHT NOW! Because Digimon is no rip-off...it's supierior!",952560000,4,1741,4.972222222222222

Yeah right for one thing Pokemon has more creativity because unlike digimon all the names of the pokemon do not end in ""mon"".
Although it does has some good humor and such it's  still a palid attempt to pokemon.

The Digidestined (that's the kids) are each given a crest based on  their strengths/weaknesses, and have to learn to overcome their problems to  help their friends. (i.e Joe, the eldest of the kids, is a cynic, and has  to learn to believe in others' abilities in the bleakest of situations-He's  a really big cynic, so that's a bit of a problem for him) The Digimon are  also cuter/cooler than the Pokemon. For one, would you rather have a Pidgey  as a pet, or its much cuter Digi-equivalent, Biyomon? For coolness, would  you decide on a Charizard (blech! what kinda name is that! ) or one of  Gabumon's later evolutions, Garurumon (a fierce ice-wolf) or even  Weregarurumon. (enough said-the coolest of the Digimon IMHO... Kinda rolls  off your tongue as you say it... go ahead... try!)
The animation (done by  the DragonBall guys, no less) is a lot more fluid than Pokemon (for crying  out loud, Pokemon is pretty choppy) and has much more detail. From the  Digimon and their attacks to the DigiDestined, even the landscapes are  better than Pokemon's!
Finally, the humor is a lot more creative than  Pokemon's. Whereas Pokemon relies on cheesy puns, Digimon takes some  creativity into consideration (with a bad pun here and there):  ""Everybody makes mistakes...like Disco!"" ""It's like Deja Vu  all over again!"" ""I swear, Myotismon, I won't do it again!  Promise! I'll do anything! I'LL WORK ON SUNDAYS! ""

If you actually watch the two you will see quite a few of differences. Though there are small simularities.

1.) When pokemon evolve, they can never return to their previous stage they can only evolve forward(as far as their line goes). Digimon however can dedigivolve back to a previous stage.

2.)Pokemon - the human characters share the same home world with their faithful pocketmonsters.
Digimon - the kids get swept away into a digital world, to meet and soon befriend some digital monsters.

3.)Pokemon evolve by items being used(which are good for one use), friendship with their trainer(some at day or night specifically), reaching a certian level, or being traded(in some cases a particular item needs to be held by the poke)
The digimon digivolve with the help of their partners digivice when they are in danger, and later to the higher stages with the corresponding crest(a special necklace) and digivice also when there is danger affot.

4.) Pokemon have much shorter evolotion lines.
Pokemon: Baby > Basic > Basic2 or Basic > Basic2 > Basic 3.

Digimon: Fresh(hatchling baby), In-training, Rookie, Champion, Ultimate, Mega (and there were a few cases past mega in the first season as i'm reviewing i won't go into the digimentals and all of that).

4.) Pokemon focuses on self confidence, friendship, compassion, kindness, standing up for oneself and friends, respect, good versus bad/evil, friendly rivalry(and some not all that freindly) and teamwork.

Digimon focuses on friendship, teamwork, leadership, the crest traits: love, courage, hope, respect, responsibility, good versus evil, kindness, etc.

After all that typing i'd like to say both are good and different enough that neither is a rip-off.

i loved this when it first aired and i owned all vhs tapes back in the day, they were stolen however or i'd still own them to this day. i stopped watching after the 3rd season, but i personally like stories that stick to the original characters better myself.

7898164,5,6305951500,"I'm sure a certain reviewer feels the burn as rabid digi-fans jump all over him for his scandalous review.  Please be a assured (in rational tones such as I'm pleased to see on this particular page) that Digimon is a show far surperior to Pokemon.  As has been said, there is a great deal of character-develpment and pathos in Digi-mon which that other show, quite blatantly, lacks.  That Digimon is one fight scene after another and, further, that Pokemon is not, is absurd.  I cannot recall a single Pokemon episode that did not depict some sort of battle, even if it was one of those monotonous battles with Team Rocket.  On the other hand, I can instantly recal episodes from Digimon, such as everyone's fav, ""Genesis of Evil"", which contain no fight scenes.

May I go further?  I disagree wholeheartedly with the preposterous statement that Pokemon has any morals and Digimon has none.  Pokemon is, if fans will excuse me, the saga of a spoiled, selfish boy who has the one wish to ""be the best"".  Also in this series, the Pokemon are ""caught"" and, without reading into this line of thought too far, are enslaved and used simply for the purpose of becoming the best.

Digimon is a story of friendship.  The characters in this wonderful plot (I will return to this statement) are called to save the world with the help of their digimon partners.  The digi-destined and -mons become extremely close, as each child has but the one digimon.  They work together to save the world and often it is the child's goodness which gives the digimon his strength.  As they struggle to save the world, each child learns lessons particular to his character and ends up as a well rounded individual.  Certainly, the Digimon writers are too intelligent to put across their own ideas of morality; however, cliches are what they are because they are true.

Another aside; I have not yet seen the first season, but from what I have seen in the second, family plays an important role in the story.  Unlike in Pokemon, the parents are not only mentioned but play an important part in plot and character development (such as in Ken's case).  Also, larger familys (in this country, that is to say, familys with more than two kids) are very positively portrayed and there is a great deal of friendship between siblings (except perhaps in the steriotypical relationship between Davis and his half-witted sister).

Let me return to the terms ""saga"" and ""plot"".  As can be seen by anyone who tunes into only a few episodes, Pokemon is definitely a run-on series and very repetitive.  Digimon has a real plot and, to the dismay perhaps of great fans, when the story is finished, it is finished.  Overall, I have seen great internal cohesion in the second season.  A note, though - there is sometimes a lack of cohesion from one episode to another in terms of accomplishments, especially in the ""trusting Ken"" plot.

In closing, I would recommend Digimon wholeheartedly, even with no comparison to that other show, to anyone in search of a light but not brain-rotting cartoon series.  This show is appropriate, in my oppinion, to ""kids of all ages"".  My own family can attest to that.  We are four girls and one boy, ranging from 4 to 18, and this is the only cartoon we watch.  In fact, my parents do not ussually approve of our modern-day cartoons, so filled with violence and loose morals and oppressive f*m*n*st*c garbage, but they make an exception to this worthy show.
Now, if Jetix would only show the first season and would play the second at a time other than 11pm or 5am, life would be oh so good!!

There are more villians that are actually evil, compared to Team Rocket in Pokemon who are defeated nearly every episode. It was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid and it's still one of my favorite anime series today. Although I can't compare the dubbed to the Japanese version, I think the dubbed version was good and would be worth buying.

I am kind of disappointed though, that there isn't a DVD boxset availiable for the first season (on Amazon at least) and as far as I've seen, the VHS don't seem to go past episode thirteen or so. There may be a boxset of DVDs of VHS tapes somewhere, but I've never seen it...",1148083200,,1015,4.342105263157895
