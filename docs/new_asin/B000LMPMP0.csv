The video focuses on specific stores (probably they all gave the video company money). The narration is horrible! Bad photography! Lingers on too many fillers, such as the animals in the Zoo, a brewery, and stores!
DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$'s! I returned mine.",1194307200,,326,4.945454545454545
8190575,2,B000LMPMP0,Purchased this guide as am planning to visit Toronto for first time and hoped for a taster. Unfortunately this was more like watching someone's badly put together holiday video. Scenes backed by only two types of music: soft acoustic guitar and clubbing dance music! Perhaps will give a laugh but not a great endorsement of what I understand to be a great city,1178928000,,360,4.73015873015873
