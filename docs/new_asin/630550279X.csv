Ralph waite is great in the role of the father, jennifer jason leigh is a great actress. Great movie worth watching.",1421884800,,261,4.574468085106383
7891455,4,630550279X,"The Movie was Straight. They need to do a remake of this movie! I seen this movie when I was a kid! But these ridiculous prices I'm not feeling it! I'm only giving it 4 stars for the movie, not for the price of the movie! Get this on DVD! And hopefully in the future, they remake the movie with different actors!

7891456,5,630550279X,"Unintentionally, this is one of the most hilarious films ever made. I love it. It features ""Daddy"" from The Waltons and Jennifer Jason Leigh, the hot ho from Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I had seen this film on television back in the 1980s and couldn't get it out of my head. In the 1990s, I bought a VHS copy on Ebay for about 20 bucks. The story is such a blatant ripoff of Steinbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" combined with tidbits from ""Of Mice And Men"" that it cannot help but bring a chuckle to the mildly educated. Also, the stupidity of John Walton's family and the people who live in Angel City is hilarious as they allow themselves to be strong-armed into living as slaves in a work camp that is run by like 2 guys. The ending riot scene will put a smile on your face for days.  In ""Of Mice and Men"", the main character talks about the dream of someday owning a farm...in this film, the dream is to someday own a fruit stand. This movie is well-worth watching....unintentional humor at it's best!",1384992000,,1004,4.340425531914893
7891457,4,630550279X,I've been looking for this item for years and was really pleased when I found someone who had a copy. I was hoping to find a DVD of this film but had to settle for ordering it on VHS. the film was watchable but because the tracking varies on each recorder it wasn't the best but still happy that I've seen the film again after all this time.,1359331200,,341,4.029411764705882
