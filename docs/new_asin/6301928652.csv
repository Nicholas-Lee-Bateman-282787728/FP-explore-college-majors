7816964,2,6301928652,"Any movie with Tawny Kitaen automatically gets bumped up by 1 star.  If you do the math, you can see that I did not think too much of this film.  I guess there is a  reason as to why it is so obscure ~ even for a huge Tawny fan like myself.

The biggest drawback of the movie is that it is very long-winded (> 2hrs).  Now, that is not necessarily a bad thing SO LONG AS it's a story which I find compelling.  This DVD fell short on that.  Also, while the cover entices you to think that Tawny has a leading role, that is not the case as she's only in maybe 40% of the flick.

The story is about 3 friends from HS.  One of them owes a loan shark a lot of $$ so all 3 of them head to Vegas to try & bail him out.  They believe a fight is fixed so they bet on the longshot boxer.  To their chagrin, things do not turned out as planned in the ring (which is actually the one genuinely funny part of the flick).  From there they engage in one misadventure after another.

If you are, like me, a HUGE Tawny fan, then MAYBE this 1 is worth a gander ~ just barely.  For people who wish to see Tawny in an absolute classic ""B"" movie, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perils-of-Gwendoline-in-the-Land-of-the-Yik-Yak/dp/B000FI8MKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik Yak</a>.

7816965,4,6301928652,"I remember this as a fun HBO mini-series that aired in the 80's.  I was happy to find it on DVD for a good price.  Re-visiting it has not belied my memory of a campy, humorous story with fun characters and a nice measure of sex appeal.  I must take issue with the packaging, though.  I was embarrased to put it with the family dvd collection because the cover just looks like 80's porn.  I mean, it's a story about three dudes, but the jacket and the dvd itself are stamped with this picture of the ladies of the show in their bedroom clothing.  There a lot more to the content than the packaging would imply.",1491955200,,609,4.206896551724138

7816969,2,6301928652,"I didn't enjoy watching this movie.  It is not funny,  and the story line is a stinker too.  I did enjoy seeing Tawny Kitain when she was young and beautiful,  but this was not one of her better movie rolls at all!  It is just a mundane film that makes you feel glad that it is not 1986 anymore.  Skip it!",1426982400,,305,3.918032786885246
7816970,5,6301928652,"I enjoyed seeing Glory Years because of the Fabulous  Mamie Van Doren. She is always livening up any film she is in. Nice to see what she was up to in 1987. I have met her and she is so nice to her fans. And I appreciate her making a stand for women's and gay rights. One of the last stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood, and a lining legend.",1341792000,,342,3.816901408450704
7816971,4,6301928652,"Long, but very good retro comedy / drama with many familiar faces from the era. Not a classic but something different for those who think they've seen all 80's films. Tawney is hot so it really doesn't matter, watch it for her.",1276560000,,227,4.428571428571429
