8175696,5,B000N95DIC,"This is an excellent documentary on one of the Catholic Church's most beloved saints. Fr Andrew really brought this saint to life for me. full of funny and entertaining stories Fr. Andrew managed to get to the very heart of who this man is. He paints a very Francisco picture of this beloved saint and aspects of Pio's Capuchin spirituality shine through.

This documentary is in no way 'preachy' but calls one on and inspires a person to seek after holiness.

Padre Pio was an increadable man. His story should touch many hearts.",1376006400,9,530,4.688172043010753

It touches on all aspect of his internal religious spirituality and all the elements that made him a holy man. Every element of spirituality that this movie touches on through a Franciscan friair who narrates the documentary with pictures of Padre Pio and a grounded knowledge in his faith. It does not give footage of Padre PIo but lets everyone understand the holiness of this great Saint of Modern Times.",1360454400,9,509,4.593406593406593
