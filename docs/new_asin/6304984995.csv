7881754,5,6304984995,"""The Nazis Strike"" is the second in director Frank Capra's ""Why We Fight"" series that is the supreme example of American propaganda from World War II.  During the war Capra was a major in the U.S. Army Signal Corps and was commissioned by General George C. Marshall, the Army Chief of Staff, to make series of films that would explain the government's policy to the troops hastily being assembled, trained, and sent overseas.
In this 41-minute black & white documentary, which was released in 1943, Capra covers the rise of the Nazis to power as Hitler establishes his dictatorship over Germany and then has his armies march on Austria and Czechoslovakia before invading Poland and officially beginning the war.  What is emphasized is how attempts at appeasement were made but failed to deter Hitler from his dreams of conquest.  Capra documents how Hitler combined political maneuvers with military preparedness to position Germany for war.  The section on the ""Blitzkrieg"" (""lighting war"") attack on Poland is a superb record of the fall of that nation before the German juggernaut.
Capra was able to use the facilities of MGM, Paramount and 20th Century Fox, as well as the talents of filmmakers like Walter Huston, George Stevens, and William Wayler, as well as composers Alfred Newman and Dmitri Tiomkin.  The animated map sequences were doen by Walt Disney and his staff.  In addition to being effective tools of propaganda, helping to shift American from an isolationist to a war footing, the ""Why We Fight"" series effectively redefined the art of the documentary.
The series was eventually shown to the public in theaters and prints were shown to American allies in England and the Soviet Union as well.  Even today the ""Why We Fight"" series remains a prime source of archival footage of this period.  ""The Nazi Strike"" is followed by ""Divide and Conquer,"" which continues the story of how the Nazi easily conquered most of the European continent.",1082332800,,1955,4.993846153846154
