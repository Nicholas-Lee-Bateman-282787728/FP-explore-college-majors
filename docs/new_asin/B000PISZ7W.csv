2824105,5,B000PISZ7W,"I love movies where the plot centers around work and money.  This movie was very entertaining.  Michael Keaton was great, as usual - top of his game.  The plot was full of twists and turns.  The ending was completely different from what I expected---a complete surprise.",1187654400,5,270,4.804347826086956
2824106,1,B000PISZ7W,"Well, no.  The disk is too small to make a good frisbee and the story (which is supposed to be a psychological thriller) is neither psychological nor is it a thriller.

Here is the story so you don't have to waste your time watching it.  Keaton plays a salesman who is set up to mentor a new man from the midwest.  The new man is engaged, so naturally Keaton's character, who is a really nasty fellow, starts having sex with his fiancee.  What he does not know is, the fiancee is a prostitute hired by a man who wants to take over the company.  Somehow Keaton's affair brings down the entire sales office and helps bring down the value of the company (since other prostitutes have been hired to sabotage other sales offices across the country.)  This creates an opportunity for the fellow who engineered the whole thing to buy the company for a cut rate price.  Keaton's character loses his job, finds out he's been played for a sap by a hooker, and then goes back to his old job at Northwestern University as a college prof.  The story ends with the people who set all this up laughing at him.  That is supposed to be a thrilling surprise ending, except that it makes no sense.  Furthermore, the characters are all so unlikeable there is no reason any of us should care one way or the other - and we don't.

I gave this one star because the system would not let me give it zero stars or twenty raspberries.

Amazon's got lots of great movies for sale.  Do yourself a favor and buy something else.",1186531200,11,1497,4.35740072202166

oh, while watching this movie i have realize that some of the shoots were taken in front of the building I work in ( One Shell Square). and they were suppose to be in New York?",1184976000,,359,4.202898550724638
2824108,3,B000PISZ7W,"Michael Caleo's background in writing for television shows in this flimsy little flick that despite a solid cast comes across as tired retelling of the bad guy to good guy to bad guy sequences.  There are some good one-liners in the film, with a script that is so peppered with the 'f' word that it is crippled by it, but the story has been done before and much better and this time around the 'twist' is obvious from the film's opening lines.

Goofus-doofus Midwesterner Jaime (Brendan Fraser) has moved form Ohio to New York with his gorgeous girlfriend Belisa (Amber Valletta) to join a sales company whose chief salesman is foul mouthed, ill tempered Ted (Michael Keaton) who appears to loathe everyone and the world. Jaime is assigned to Ted, but Jaime's level of intelligence borders on idiocy and his fate with the company seems doomed...until Jaime introduces Belisa to Ted...and the  romantic fireworks start.  Ted falls for Belisa and begins to change his outlook, confiding his inner spirit as a professor of English literature to Belisa.  A transformation takes place and as Jaime spirals downward while Ted and Belisa's affair ignites, role reversal happens as a not at all surprising plot unfolds.

Michael Keaton is a fine actor and makes the best of this mouthy role, but Brendan Fraser's talents are completely wasted - a hint from the start that all is not as it appears...  It is a mediocre movie and even if the audience doesn't turn off the soundtrack to rid the script of the trashy language, it can become insulting to the intellect.  But again, Keaton helps it float.

2824109,5,B000PISZ7W,"So many of Hollywood's most popular movies have become so painfully formulaic that 15 minutes into the thing, you can figure out who wins the girl, who loses his life and who gets what he deserves. This movie starts out that way but the ending caught me by surprise. I first saw this movie one week ago and as the days have passed, I continue to think about the ending and the story line. It's *that* good a movie.

It's also a thinking person's movie. Nothing explodes and no one's head rolls down a staircase and there's no blood and gore, but my oh my, is it a compelling story.

There are a lot of messages you can take away from this movie but the one that rings most true to me is a quote I heard many years ago from William Barclay (Bible scholar). He said that evil seeks to breech our spiritual fortress in our weakest places and in our strongest places and that we should be vigilant to guard those two ""low spots.""

The other reason I loved this movie is it's about ""every man"" and each plot and sub-plot is very believable and has no discernible plot holes (as so many movies do). It's very well-written, well-acted and deliciously interesting. You may want to watch it twice, to make sure you miss nothing.",1184112000,33,1219,4.361233480176211

2824122,5,B000PISZ7W,"I like both of the male stars of this movie, but knew little to nothing about the female who was also featured. This was one of the most riveting movies I have seen in a VERY long time. The performances were beyond good and I have so many good things to say about it that I hate to dampen it with negativity...with that being said however...Mr. Keaton's performance was marred by the fact that the only words he knows are the tiny little ones he uses to link every curse word known to man. It was over the top and not in a good way! Ok...so maybe I live a sheltered life working for IBM among other businesses, but after the initial shock value wore off I had to wonder if the people who wrote the script was really frustrated in his own life because no one in the business world really talks that way do they? Or allow themselves to be talked to that way either...especially buy a salesman?

But as stated earlier...the movie was amazing. It keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. And you just let it all sink in and then you watch it again. And again...looking for signs of what was going to happen. It isn't Mr. Keaton's fault someone didn't think the movie could hold up without the language. Wait until thekids are in bed or at a sleepover...you do not want to have to explain what the words are...or worse...they ask a teacher!",1341532800,5,1349,4.290196078431372

2824124,4,B000PISZ7W,"I bought this because of Amber Valletta's nude scenes.  They're OK, but not worth five stars.  I didn't really believe the ending, or at least Amber's ending.  I can't really say too much without revealing the plot, but Brendon Fraser broke type-cast by the end, and I doubt if anyone would take the trouble to set in motion such a complicated plot, but I enjoyed it anyway.",1265587200,,374,4.552238805970149
2824125,5,B000PISZ7W,"The semiotic language underlined twice in two transcendental sequences. ""Be a shark, not a bait.""

This brilliant script deals with several facets of the human being in the city of the world : How to survive in the middle of the competitive contour? How do we face the success and bear our affective lacks behind the mask of the most terrible existential loneliness? Where is the turning point of every human being?

After the first quarter of the film my mind brought me back those horrid memories of the magnificent film ""Midnight cowboy"" . The tangent point resides precisely in the fact we have a winner salesman Jamie Bashant (Brendan Fraser) and his fiance Belisa (Amber Valletta) from Ohio  has been enticed and recruited to face the challenge in New York City in order to triumph into a well reputed enterprise related with the sell of first-order technological devices and how he has to deal with the wolf of the thousand won battles, Ted Rike (Michael Keaton who stole the show in this film) .

That's the initial premise. Our new promise begins his job with many failures and disappointments. And when his girlfriend and Ted begin a sudden and hot affair the tic tack of the clock will initiate its regressive count.

The gradual and irreversible crumbling of our hunter runs parallel with the decay of the firm he represents, because the was the superstar of this winner team. And we will witness the awful truth in the great and unexpected finale.

Undoubtedly, we are in front of the best films of this year. Astonishing performances and an engaging plot make of this movie a magnificent finding.",1253577600,3,1610,4.773381294964029
2824126,4,B000PISZ7W,"""The Last Time"" kept my interest.  The sales lingo and stiff competition formed a good foundation for the film where getting ahead vies with truthfulness.  Michael Keaton who was in ""First Daughter"" and played Batman for Tim Burton years ago does a good job as the cutthroat Ted who does anything to make the sale.  Keaton develops the character well as we eventually see his vulnerability.  Brendan Fraser who was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Air-I-Breathe/dp/B0014Z4OKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Air I Breathe</a>&nbsp;which was not so great and the Oscar-winning&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;plays Jamie, a naive salesman from Ohio trying to adjust to New York.  One of the deleted scenes showing Fraser in leather with a girl in the bathroom was thankfully not in the final cut.  Fraser does a good job showing the downhill emotional trajectory of the character.  Amber Valetta from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transporter-2/dp/B000BTITKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transporter 2</a>&nbsp;plays Jamie's girlfriend Belisa.  The scene with her being unfaithful with Ted as Jamie lies unconscious next to them in the bed is jarring.  Billy Slaughter turns in a nice cameo performance as the frisky intern who gets beat up in the parking lot.  Neal McDonough turns his blue eyes loose as Hurly whose bravado exceeds his accomplishment.  Michael Lerner was a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for ""Barton Fink"" in 1991.  He turns in a nice cameo performance as the sales guru Leguzza who has a penchant for Korean boys.  Michael Caleo who directed an episode of ""The Sopranos"" helms the project and keeps it unpredictable into the home stretch.  Perhaps we might call this ""Death of Salesman 2.""

2824127,4,B000PISZ7W,"gd plot, kind of well written screenplay, could have been more interesting. shooting could have been much more interesting too. story tells how the business world would have gone all the ways to take their enemies down. even sending staffs over to the other company as someone else...very interesting indeed, just not shot 1 st class.",1224028800,4,334,4.982142857142857
2824128,4,B000PISZ7W,"This is a comedy that turns serious as a bitter salesman realizes he can still fall in love, and not with money.  The problem is, he doesn't realized he's being duped and his company is being taken down...one salesman at a time by a bigwig that likes to thin out heavy competition.  Will everyone open their eyes in time?  I would've liked a different ending, but it was a good watch.

2824129,2,B000PISZ7W,What a cheesy movie.  Made no sense and I got so tired of Brendan Fraser over acting.  Sorry guys.  Wish it could have been better.,1189468800,,131,4.16
8191921,2,B000PISZ7W,"The Last Time I'll ever watch this movie. Glad I didn't pay to watch it. It seemed to suffer from an identity crisis. I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a comedy, drama or thriller at different times during the movie. Brendan Fraser was totally miscast and unbelievable in his role. Overall, it was undeveloped, unoriginal plot, predictable ending and no reason to care about any of the characters in the end.",1514764800,,415,4.621621621621622

I especially liked the part where Michael went through the book of drawings.  That peaked my curiosity and was very thought provoking.
You didn't know if it would turn horror quick or what.  It was a motley genre film with a talented cast.  I would say it was a drama, black comedy, romance, mystery genre that toyed with horror and the dark side.  In other words it was sort of a heinz 57 or mutt genre.",1487635200,,541,4.153846153846154
8191925,5,B000PISZ7W,"Set in the world of high-finance corporate sales in New York City, Michael Keaton plays Tod Riker, the #1 salesman in the company's NY office,  who seemingly has no morals & is quite ruthless.  Enter Brendan Fraser as Jamie, the relocated Midwesterner, who's been a top earner at his former company, along with his beautiful & reluctant NYC ""relocated"" fiance, Amber Valetta, as Belissa.  These are the central, pivotal characters of the film and all are deep, complex, flawed people, played with unabashed brilliance by all three.  The rest of the cast members round out this amazing film equally well.

Jamie is assigned to Tod, who, as the senior account executive is supposed to facilitate Jaime's transition to this new sales force & help smooth the acclimation to New York City, as Jamie & Belissa are out of their element & know no one there.  Tod is brash, tactless & has no patience for taking this eager-to-please, sunshine-y Midwesterner under his cynical ""wing"".  As the story unfolds, so does Jamie!!  He can't seem to make a sale, even when almost served up on a platter by Tod, who doesn't understand & is frustrated with whatever is happening with Jaime that he can't seem to make a sale.  The office is under the pressure of making their sales quota for the quarter and additional stress as other branches have been letting people go & even closing some branch offices.  While Jamie is unraveling, Belissa isn't the ego-bolstering fiance; instead, she is becoming more & more disillusioned with Jamie and becoming more attracted to Tod.

From here, you'll be coming to one conclusion.  However, this movie does not go for the obvious in any way, shape, or form!!  It takes many winding turns, building upon & heavily centered on each characters' individual personalities and the interplay among them.  Throughout, there are moments where it will seem that each character is either devious, duplicitous, unscrupulous and, possibly even deranged.  Therein lies the genius of this film's creator!  As the film builds to its'  twisty, cunning curveball conclusion, you'll be left breathless!!",1486425600,,2105,5.002873563218391

8191928,5,B000PISZ7W,"One of the best movies I have ever watched. One scene in the movie tells you there is something more to Michael Keaton's character than just being a jerk and complete A Hole. While Ted is waiting for Jamie on the front steps of his house, he looks around at the neighborhood. Ted notices the perfectly kept houses. The man across the street mowing his lawn. Everything manicured. The example of a perfect life. At least on the outside. You see a slight hint of sadness of something lost on Ted's face. ( Revealed later in the movie ) Very subtle but it is there. At that point you realize the reason for Teds anger. His bitterness towards everyone. That one quick scene made me take notice that this was going to be more than just your basic movie drama. It is one of those movies where the characters come full circle. You see the progression. And it makes perfect sense. Nothing is forced by any of the actors. And honestly there is a little bit of Ted Riker in all of us. This movie never would have done well at the box office.  You have to pay attention to notice all the small details and let the actors tell the story. The ending took me by surprise. I am pretty good at guessing what will happen next in a movie. But not with this one . The music at the end of the movie is perfect.  Sadly a score was never released. Michael Keaton' final words say it all. "" Unlike Dorian. We pay for our sins now.

8191930,5,B000PISZ7W,"I love Michael Keaton, especially when he is in some serious sarcasm mode lol.  This is probably my favorite of all Keaton movies.  It introduces us to a salesman (Keaton) at the top of his game (after being in the biz a mere 3 years) and the period in which he takes on an optimistic young colleague (Brenden Fraser)... who isn't coming along as successfully as his background had promised.  This only infuriates top salesman who treats him (and everyone) like dirt.

But the dynamic changes when top salesman meets younger salesman's pretty young partner.

Fascinating character study.  And wow what an unexpected twist.  Loved it.  This is just one of those random movies I got a lot of love for and have seen more than once.  It cracks me up.  A hidden gem I never even heard of until it was out for some years.  Loved the very end-- the last minute or two.  Loved the idea that some traumas can lift us from our life into strange new worlds where we can't even recognize ourselves... and then again return us, forever changed.  Highly recommended!",1466467200,,1052,4.591397849462366
