5414396,5,B00AEVXGFG,"As a long time fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, I highly enjoy the new series so far.  I picked up the dvd from amazon a few days ago and everything works great.  The dvd itself does have some extras although nothing that I really care for.  Would have really liked seeing an interview by the creators, actors, or producers of the new show. This dvd has the first 6 episodes of Nickelodeon's new Turtles series.  Like other long time fans, I did come into this new show with some fears over certain details like; the different animation style, Don and Mikey's new bladed weapons, and turning April into a teenager.  The changes I pretty much got used to by the end of the first episode.

Now, I don't know why some fans have a difficult time buying this just because it isn't the full season.  One thing, the price tag is VERY cheap.  Including shipping it's just over $10.  If the releases continue like this, we'll get the full season in 4 dvds.  That's only around $40.  If you look around at full season box sets for other shows, you'll see similar and at times even more expensive price tags.  Besides, $40 for 26 episodes of a series like this is well worth the money.

Anyway, if you've been a fan of other Turtle incarnations like the Mirage, Archie, and IDW comics, or the 1987 and/or 2003 series, or the movies, you may or may not enjoy this series.  I happen to really like all of the cartoon series', the movies, and what I've read from Mirage and Archie. At the very least, I highly recommend you give this series a try for several episodes at least.  This series is a great new edition to the Turtle franchise.  Until next time...Cowabunga/Booyakasha!",1362614400,3,1673,4.471947194719472
5414397,5,B00AEVXGFG,"Spanning over 25 years with three animated series, four films(three live-action/one CGI), numerous video games and comic books, and countless action figures and merchandising; The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are well known by the masses. Nickelodeon decided to take their stab at them and with very surprising results. This particular DVD is, in actuality, an appetizer for the Season 1 featuring six episodes from the show..which begins with ""Rise of the Turtles"" an origin story that takes its viewers through the TMNT basics, from the turtles deciding on a leader to their first slice of pizza. The surprising thing is that Nickelodeon decided to shake things up a bit. For instance, April O' Neil is a teenager now. Kraang is THE Kraang now(an army of robots with brain aliens in their bellies)...and that's not all(I'll leave it up to you to find out). It's alot more humorous than previous incarnations(with REAL humor instead of DUMB humor where you're expected to 'get it') and, while more lighthearted than any other TMNT program or movie, it's good fun for the whole family.

While I understand everyones' trepidation of waiting til a full season comes out on DVD, if you're curious to see what the new show has to offer and don't have any other means of catching it, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Rise of the Turtles is a good place to start. Loved it and am looking forward to more.",1362441600,2,1395,4.861344537815126
5414398,4,B00AEVXGFG,"I was born in 1981, which means that I grew up on the original TMNT series. I had--okay, I still have--a collection of TMNT memorabilia, all of the movies, all kinds of stuff. I've seen these characters through countless rebirths, whether it was one of the many cartoon series, the comics from Mirage, Archie, or Image. Whenever there's a remake, the fans of the original will be hesitant to buy into the new version. I was especially doubtful when it came to the casting of the voice talent.

I'm a big fan of Greg Cipes, and of course Rob Paulsen played our beloved Raphael in the original series. However, I think that the current cast could not possibly be any better. I loved the original cast, of course, but something about this current cast feels more close to the comics. I also think that Rob's voice fits better with Donatello.

This series, while indulging in small amounts of silliness, plays them out as characters instead of caricatures. Each one has his or her light and dark sides. I also enjoy seeing April getting to learn to be a ninja like she did in the comics instead of a helpless reporter. It's also nice to see her as a teenager in this series. It just adds a new dynamic to the story.

It also doesn't hurt that there are a lot of little references to the old series, to the comics, and subtle shout-outs to the fans of the classic versions. I think that if you approach this new series with an open mind and a love of all things TMNT, you will fall in love just as I have.

Besides, fans of TMNT should be excited about introducing a whole new generation to the characters we know and love.",1361836800,7,1618,4.40133779264214
5414399,5,B00AEVXGFG,"When I first found out about the new Ninja Turtles Nicktoon, I was excited! Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was one of my favorite cartoon series growing up and the new Nicktoon was something to be excited about. With various elements from both the Mirage Comics series and the 80's cartoon I was a big fan of, it is a great combination.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-The-Complete-Classic-Series-Collection/dp/B009474UW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Complete Classic Series Collection</a>&nbsp;I also love how the Nicktoon introduced Donatello's crush on April.
For some odd reason, Walmart released the DVD the week before Amazon did, so I'm watching the DVD right now! The key thing to know about this DVD release features an `uncut' version of the hour-long pilot episode `Rise of the Turtles' (let's see a Season Box Set do that!), along with five additional episodes from the first season. Before the DVD's release, I only saw two of the episodes that are featured on it ""New Friend, Old Enemy"" and "" I Think His Name Is Baxter Stockman"", all the others I saw were later episodes.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Trailer/dp/B009C46XYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Trailer</a>&nbsp;If you chose to wait for a Season set, you might get the pilot in two half-episodes, but this DVD release has it `uncut'. So, it might be worth it, it depends on your own opinions.",1361318400,11,1570,6.108597285067873
5414400,5,B00AEVXGFG,"I wasn't sure what to think of the new TMNT DVD but it surprised me that we liked it.  By ""we"" I mean my boys (4 and 6) and myself.  While it is not the TMNT that I remember from when I was younger, it is still a great show.  The characters are the same turtles we love just animated a little differently, more modern looking.  The DVD features five episodes with a total of over two hours of cowabunga fun! They have to battle against their enemies as usual in these action package episodes.  My boy (4 and 6) love them and ask to watch them again and again.

5414402,5,B00AEVXGFG,Can't Wait For This To Come Out. I've Been Following The 1st Episode Up To Now. I Must Say Its Worth Watching. I Tune In Every Saturday Mooring To Nickelodeon.

5414403,3,B00AEVXGFG,"I'm happy to report that this new TMNT show rocks! At first glance I wasn't quite sold with the animation though they did look much better than in their previous cgi movie where they looked just too damn skinny. It also seemed like Nickelodeon were going in a retro route that echoed memories of the original animated series which I wasn't so fond of excluding of course the five episode pilot. Fortunately I was proven wrong & this series incorporates all the best elements of the TMNT. I Definitely appreciate the cgi animation a lot more now too because it's all so insanely detailed down to the last pixel. Animation giant Ciro Nieli & Nickelodeon have smartly put together one kick ass show sure to please fans new & old so I really hope it proceeds a successful run just like their previous animated series. This is a smartly written series that's appealing to both kids & adults alike but I don't give this DVD release a full five stars because I really wish they'd have just released the whole first season onto DVD instead of just half the season. Also, I'm not sure whether or not this is gonna have any cool special features.",1355356800,3,1136,4.546341463414634

5414419,5,B00AEVXGFG,I haven't watched an episode of the Turtles since somewhere in the original series in the early 90's but this series looks and feels like the closest to the original comic as we're ever going to get. I like the show but I feel that characters like Dogpound or Xever drag the series down to elementary age level. These guys suck but the rest of the series is great.,1393718400,,364,4.2898550724637685

5414421,5,B00AEVXGFG,"My husband and I ran across this new (2012) version of the turtles and started watching them on a regular basis.  We absolutely love them (yes, we are adults, but who cares?!) I love the fact that the characters have distinct personalities and looks unlike the 1987 version where they all looked and acted the same.  The writing for the show is excellent - the perfect mix of humor, sincerity, and good life lessons all combined into one fantastic show.  The only complaint I have is that (as a parent) I feel it's a bit too violent/creepy for younger kids (it's up to each parent to decide how old their kids should be) and they insult Michelangelo a lot (in good fun, but still) which I wish didn't happen so much because I'm not sure how much little ones would pick up on that and think it was ""cool""  to do since the turtles do it.  They do have some moments where they clearly show that they care about Mikey, though, and each other, especially when one of them gets taken or hurt by a ""bad guy.""",1389225600,,1001,4.331550802139038

I'm so glad I did - they're really entertaining, oops I mean she loves them, not me. he-he. And before anyone gets all freaked out that a 4 year old is watching them, we discuss that all of the moves are self-defense to ward off bad robots.",1388448000,,543,3.9454545454545453

5414430,5,B00AEVXGFG,"I'll begin by saying that I was wrong. I'm of the generation that lived and breathed the 1987 Ninja Turtles. I first saw the trailer for this cartoon and thought it was a cheap CGI ripoff of the franchise.

But then I watched the first episode and fell in love all over again. It made me feel the way I did all those years ago growing up with the Turtles. Except, unlike the 1987 cartoon, which hasn't aged well, this show looks and feels fresh. The 87 cartoon was corny and the animation was often inconsistent at best. By contrast, the writing for this series is actually pretty decent for a cartoon. Each episode is self-contained, but I like how the build upon a larger story with some continuous characters and elements. The action is well paced but also allows time for character moments. Best of all, the show is genuinely funny. Not goofy, corny, ""I can't believe I'm watching this"" funny, but some real ""laugh out load"" moments.

I think this show has potential to revive the Ninja Turtles franchise. I dare say it might even be better than the 1987 series in some ways. Definitely recommended.",1370563200,3,1103,4.565656565656566

5414434,5,B00AEVXGFG,"Ever since I was a kid, the 1980's series of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was my favorite show of all time.  I've collected all the DVDs of that series over the years, and even though I'm an adult now, I've never stopped loving it.  So it's saying something that I think I like this new Nickelodeon series even better.  They seem to have combined everything I liked from the 80's series with everything I liked from the newer series into one show, and the result is one fantastic TV show!  There are a ton of my favorite voice actors in this series, they captured the characters perfectly, and the plot is excellent.  I highly recommend it for any TMNT fans.

The only problem with this series that I can see - it's taking forever for new DVDS to come out.  Volume one (which I bought a long while ago) is all that's available so far, and volume 2 (which I've already pre-ordered) isn't coming out until July.

5414438,4,B00AEVXGFG,"In 1984, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird began working on a comic book series titled ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" for Mirage Studios. Featuring a darker, action-driven storyline, the comics became major collectors items due to its short print run. And because of the popularity of the comics, Playmates Toys Inc. was approached to create an action figure toyline and before they began working on the risky project, the toy company would only agree to do so, if an animated TV series was created.

Geared for children and featuring characters with color coded masks, spoke with stereotypical surfer dialogue and a love for pizza, the series was a major hit. Created in 1987, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" would air on television through 1996, and along with the TV series, the toyline was also a big success and would continue on with a live action series, multiple video games and also several live action films.

By 1997, the series has a live action series titled ""Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation"" which lasted for a single season and in 2003, the series was resurrected by FOX and with 4Kids Entertainment, the remake would be produced by Mirage Studios (the original series had no ownership by Mirage) and would be more edgier like the original comic books and much more darker than its 1987 counterpart and once again, the series and its toyline would become a major success.

And now ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is back!  In 2012, Nickelodeon acquired the rights to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from Mirage Group and 4Kids Entertainment and this time around, wanted to go with a CG-animated series and that there would be slight changes for this 2012 version from the original series and previous series that fans may have been accustomed to.

The new series would feature voice acting from Jason Biggs as Leonardo, Rob Paulsen as Donatello, Sean Astin as Raphael, Greg Cipes as Michelangelo, Mae Whitman as April O'Neil and Hoon Lee as Splinter.  In this newer series, each of the Ninja Turtles try to get accustomed to being heroes as they are taught by their sensei Splinter. A former human that was changed into a rat.

The leader of the group is Leonardo (blue mask) who fights with two katana swords and is the level-headed member of the four; Donatello is the hacker and computer/science expert  (purple mask) and fights with a rokushakubo.  He also has a crush on the video gamer girl, April O'Neil;  Raphael is the hot head of the group who acts on impulse and tend to be a problem with the group, as he tends to not think before acting.  He fights with two sais and has a pet turtle named Spike and Michelangelo is the person who loves video games, skateboarding and pizza but he is also seen as the jokester and idiot of the group.  He fights with two nunchaku and is the immature member of the.

And the group gets help from a human named April O'Neill who loves video games and pizza but also has a special spiritual sensitivity and is being trained by Splinter to be a ninja.

Together, they take on a mysterious group known as the Kraang that is led by Shredder.

A total of 26-episodes (as of February 2013, 14 episodes have been aired) were made and the first season began premiering on Nickelodeon in Sept. 2012.  And now the first six episodes will be released on DVD courtesy of Nickelodeon.

Included in ""Rise of the Turtles"" are the following episodes (featuring spoilerless summaries):

  EPISODE 1: Rise of the Turtles, Part I - The Ninja Turtles try to follow the Kraang who have abducted April O'Neill and her father Kirby.
  EPISODE 2: Rise of the Turtles, Part II - The Ninja Turtles try to rescue the O'Neills.
  EPISODE 3: Turtle Temper - Raphael has a problem with his temper and because Raphael and Michelangelo get into a bit of squabble, they end up messing up their reconnaissance mission and are recorded by a man with a cell phone who wants to make money with the video footage.  Now Raphael must get the man to not sell that video.
  EPISODE 4: New Friend, Old Enemy - Michelangelo's TV hero is the martial artist Chris Bradford, but what Michelangelo doesn't know is he is Shredder's top lieutenant.
  EPISODE 5: I Think his Name is Baxter Stockman - The team sneaks out against Splinter's orders, they battle a crazed man in a suit known as Baxter Stockman that is powered accidentally by a device Donatello created.
  EPISODE 6: Metalhead - Donatello creates Metalhead (a remote-controlled robot turtle reverse engineered from Kraang technology).

VIDEO & AUDIO

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Rise of the Turtles"" is presented in full screen format. The CG animation and the character designs is quite different from its previous series predecessors but for the most part, the animation is pretty cool.  I love how the series mixes CG but also cool artwork at times.  The overall look of the city and the integration of the characters to the environments is cool and detail of the CG animation is a plus for the series. I also like how they gave each ninja turtle a distinct look.  From Donatello have a gap to Raphael having a chipped shell.

But for the most part, the series does look good as one can expect on DVD.

As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital and dialogue and music is clear and understandable.

There are no subtitles but closed captions are included.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I was very fortunate to be around when the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book came out and since then, like many other adults who grew up with the franchise, it's been part of our lives. May it be when were a child watching the animated series or playing the video game at the arcade or at home on a video game console. ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" has been a big part of American pop culture for 25 years.

I have grown up watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and seeing every incarnation of the series.  And so far, each has brought something new and different to keep the series fresh and new for the new generation of viewers watching it.

With this new series that began in 2012, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" somewhat gets a new reboot.  The characters are the same four ninja turtles but they now have their distinct style, their own look and some characters are much different than how they were presented in past series.

This time around, I watched the series with my nine-year-old.  He was just born when the 2003 series was featured on television but at three or four, I began introducing him to the original series and also the 2003 version.  And he also had a chance to watch the 1997 live action version as well.

But while watching the series, I can tell he was captivated by this newer series because the series is now CG.  He loved seeing the characters and he kept talking about the commercials on Nickelodeon portraying Donatello as dumb as SpongeBob SquarePants' Patrick and he enjoyed the craziness of that character.

And watching this series, I have to say it was pretty cool.  I'm glad the ""Cowabunga"" days of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are gone and while I thought the 2003 series was fantastic as it featured a more darker tone, I think for today's younger fans, especially the Nickelodeon audience, children will enjoy this series. Yes, there is fighting violence, but nothing to severe.

But for the most part, this may not be the TMNT that fans grew up with back in the '80s or '90s, and even those who grew up watching it in 2003.  Like other major properties from ""Transformers"" to ""G.I. Joe"", you have to continually retweak the series to target a new audience (and tie-in with the toyline).  But older fans should not complain as they can easily go back to their original series by watching on DVD, but even for older fans like myself, I found ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Rise of the Turtles"" to be a lot of fun.  It's different but for today's young audience, it makes sense to have things modernized.  So, I appreciate where the writers have taken this anime series and created something fresh and different but yet respecting the original series as well.

The series has always been about Splinter and his four teenage mutant ninja turtles taking on Shredder and his ninja and other bad guys and that still exists in this 2012 series.

Picture and audio quality are good on DVD and there are quite a bit of special features on the actual storyboards to full animation included on this DVD release.

Overall, if you are have grown up with this series and still appreciate it, young at heart or want to introduce your own child to ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", ""Teenage Mutant Ninjua Turtles: Rise of the Turtles"" is a fun, action-packed series for today's generation of young viewers.",1364601600,,10085,4.715428571428571

5414441,3,B00AEVXGFG,"I seriously looked forward to getting this for the FREE poster thats included... Well, it wasn't included in mine. I pre ordered, paid $10 for it when it was $7 at Target and Target has the fricking poster!!! What is the point of pre order when you don't get one with a limited(in theory) run poster with some?!
As for the actual DVD, it is cool. I didn't think I was going to like the new series but it does grow on you. The 2nd volume is already out if you know where to look.
I do like the inside cover. Features Leonardos bio. Leads you to believe the others are going to be on the other volumes. I WANT MY FRICKING POSTER!!!!!",1363392000,,631,4.138211382113822
5414442,5,B00AEVXGFG,"First, whatever the packaging says, the episodes are all in their intended 16:9 ratio; I can only surmise they mean full for a wide screen TV.

Anyway, I gotta say I like this new TMNT show. I have a soft shell for the original series, even if it hasn't aged well. And I loved the 4Kids series which, ironically, was the more serious and even poetic series, paying its dues to the original comics. This show does its predecessors proud, with a lot of action, a lot of heart and a lot of funny moments. Only thing is that I wish the humans could look anywhere near as organic as the turtles or other mutants; they use the artistic style to their advantage, while most of the people looks like they were carved from wood. Pretty decently carved, but rough nonetheless.

The DVD itself is quite serviceable. You get six episodes, two of them the double-length beginning and four engaging if not episodic adventures. Also included as extras are a music video of the opening with on screen lyrics (also on iTunes for free) and  animatic storyboard/first-pass animation reels for each episode. These are great to watch, as the storyboarders really put a lot of energy into those initial drawings, and seeing them in motion makes me think another 2D series could have worked out as well. I only wish they didn't devote half of each of the reels to simply showing the finished footage from the eps again; minus that, each one generally has about 4-5 minutes worth of footage (except the first, which only has a minute). The bonus poster is decent, and the inside of the sleeve has a bio for Leo, which I assume will be the theme for the following sets: 4 sets of 6-7 eps for 4 turtles. If you're waiting for the eventual box set, note that the DVD is only $8 as of this writing, so this and the next set will be about the same price as a box anyway. So it's totally worth it if you're planning on getting the DVDs at all.",1362787200,3,1913,4.413597733711049
5414443,5,B00AEVXGFG,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have been one of my favorite cartoons ever since the original, classic series debuted in 1987. Which brings me to this cartoon of 2012. What we have on this particular DVD is 5 (technically 6) episodes of the first season from Nickelodeon's take on the TMNT. There is a lot to love here from old to new fans.

It seems like this series was designed to retain the old fans, while making some new ones along the way. Michelangelo's voice had me concerned, but once I watched the first episode, my concerns were put to rest as the voice cast is pretty solid. Featuring Rob Paulson (Donatello), Sean Astin (Raphael), Jason Biggs (Leonardo), and Greg Cipes (Michelangelo).

My only gripe is the show is not on Bluray, but no big deal. I have a feeling they will release the Bluray when the first season is concluded.",1362787200,,844,4.582781456953643
