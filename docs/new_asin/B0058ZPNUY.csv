4617288,4,B0058ZPNUY,"This DVD is good for beginners and when I say beginners I mean if you have had little to no physical activity in a long time.  I got this as a gift and thought it would be a little more heart pounding, but it isn't.  Also it seems as if it is geared toward overweight to obese people.  The movements are slow and precise.  This DVD will help you get your body ready to start working out harder.  If you have knee or joint problems they do have an alternative workout that one of the Extreme Makeover people do in the background.

Overall I should have been expecting what the show represents: A workout for people starting and those that are overweight.  If you fall in that category pick it up and start moving.",1322092800,9,712,4.268656716417911
4617289,4,B0058ZPNUY,"I really enjoyed this workout.  I exercise at home and have many workouts.  I am not obese, but I do prefer low-impact workouts.  I also prefer workouts that don't wax poetic about how great my (butt, abs, what-have-you) will look after doing the video.

This workout fit the bill for me.  It has 3 workout options (roughly 10, 20, 30 minutes).  The shortest has the feel of a joint-mobility warm-up (not very taxing for me) but the longest did cause me to break a sweat.  Yes, there is some repetition between the different workouts, so if you plan on doing ALL of them in one sitting, then you'll probably be bored.  They all can be modified to be easier or more challenging.

I found this workout GREAT for days when I don't want to do something too intense, don't feel like getting out my weights, or if I want a ""spark"" workout later in the day (just to get moving after sitting a long time).  I also plan to take it with me as I travel for the holidays (doesn't require a lot of room, no equipment needed).  I have 2 preschool age daughters and they really enjoy this video, also.  The moves are simple and repeated for time; there is no foul language, like some trainers think they must (*cough* JILLIAN!), and the instructor is encouraging and friendly.

It's a keeper for me.",1321315200,36,1284,4.435897435897436
4617290,5,B0058ZPNUY,I am a big fan of the show.  I think this video is exceptional in that it helps people like me(obese).  I have been doing it for a few weeks and it along with Chris Powell's Stax program has helped me drop 45 lbs in 2 months!  Keep in mind I have been doing the stax program and walking and a little weight training. Now I am doing this workout video and walking and weight training a few days a week.  This is GREAT!!!!!  I CANNOT WAIT FOR HIS BOOK TO COME OUT DECEMBER 2011!!!!,1317945600,84,479,4.0
4617291,4,B0058ZPNUY,"The cover of ""Extreme Makeover Weight Loss Edition: The Workout"" shows images of three people who have been on the show.  They are Rachel who lost 161 pounds, LaRhonda who lost 202 pounds, and Alex who lost 216 pounds.  There's also an 11 minute segment where they give advice.  This workout is designed for those who want to start losing weight and have not been active.  This DVD is probably not intended for experienced exercisers.

There are three levels in the DVD.  Each level has its own warm up and cool down.
In all three, Chris Powell leads a group with various fitness levels.

Level 1 is about 15 minutes.  This workout is for people, (like the people on the cover, when they first wanted to get fit), who are just starting out.  Movements are slow and carefully controlled.  Mr. Powell instructs with safety in mind and works on the upper body, the lower body, and the core.

Level 2 is about 25  minutes.  This workout bumps it up a bit by introducing some aerobic movements.  Aerobics include some high impact, but there's always a low impact version shown.  Mr. Powell works more on the upper body, lower body, and the core.

Level 3 is about 30 minutes.  Mr. Powell continues the upper body, lower body, and core work with longer aerobics, a series of squats, pushups, ab work and so on.  Easier modifications are shown.

Mr. Powell's instruction is friendly, gentle, and mindful of newcomers to exercise.  No equipment is needed.  The DVD explains consistency in exercising over time to improve health.",1317600000,277,1520,4.7034220532319395

It gives one a complete/all body workout and a cardio workout that is moderately easy to do. It challenges me just enough on level one to start.  I am 70 lbs overweight, but I do step aerobics regularly.  It has a good pace and Chris and the people who are working out with him (they have lost 160-200 lbs) are very encouraging and inspiring.

4617363,5,B0058ZPNUY,"This DVD may not be a 5-star for me personally, but I think it's a great place to start if you are a beginning exerciser.  That level one work out is TOTALLY achievable for anyone at virtually any weight!  And if you modify it up, it can get the heart rate up for someone who is in moderately good shape--though, to be fair, you would have to modify up A LOT.  The second and third level are a good challenge with nice levels.  His assistants generally have very good form and Chris is very encourage and motivating--not like scary, barking trainers of other DVDs!

Now here comes the criticisms.  My main issue is with the shredders on levels two and three.  The first low intensity level of shredders on each DVD is good.  But then level two moves into butt kicks, which is a move used in many of Jillian Michaels DVDs (a pretty advanced move) and these fairly killer squat uppercuts!  Level three's second level of shredders has VERY SLOW jumping jacks and VERY SLOW high knees that do absolutely nothing for my heart rate.  Level two's third level of shredders are ""down and outs""--or, as they are more commonly known, burpees!  Whoo-ee!  I know when I was a hundred pounds heavier, that was EXTREMELY challenging for me to complete.  Level three's third level of shredders is the ""cross country skier"" which, while being fast paced, isn't nearly as intense as the burpees.  Then--the second level moves into draw bridges (used in a Bob Harper work out!) and supermans (used in LEVEL THREE of Jillian Michaels' Thirty Day Shred!)  What gives, Chris?  Are you trying to kill beginners??  In my opinion, any move that is used in a Bob Harper or Jillian Michaels DVD should be saved until the last level--and then performed modified!

There is a little bit of a lack of balance in the work outs, but if you power through, you will see results.  I definitely recommend this for people who are just beginning--just don't get discouraged by that nasty level two!",1446422400,3,1960,4.61271676300578

We had quick smoking almost three years now and the weight was the next to go. I loved watching Chris on TV and he is very easy to follow and it really can kick your butt. I love that working the right muscles help burn the fat. I was always scared that if you don't loose the weight first and you do these exercises and lift weights to just tone up you will walk away with a muscle the size of your fat. Not for me. We are still on the 15 minutes three to four times a week, do others exercises to make sure it's not boring, and you don't lift weights but your body does feel it. It is like your body is its own resistance and let me say that I have some weight to loose. I have lost with this dvd I have lost 10 in a month, now you have to realize that we also changed our eating habits so it is not just this dvd. Try to believe in yourself and there are no quick fixes I have been on all types of darn diets and pills.

4617440,4,B0058ZPNUY,"I'm on a quest right now for a fun and challenging variety of low impact workouts. Due to my pretty severe lower back issues, I will never try P90X type exercise videos nor do I have the desire to. So far, I like this. I only have a passing acquaintance with shows like ""The Biggest Loser"" and ""Extreme Makeover"" so I wasn't inspired to buy it due to fandom or by Chris Powell's celebrity trainer status. I picked it because I knew the people in the video were successfully losing a lot and still working toward their goals (I like inspiration through the success of others).

Anyway, about the actual video:

There are three workouts on this DVD--Level 1, 2, and 3. Level 1 is of course the easiest. It provided very little challenge for me--It's more for someone who is very obese or perhaps elderly. This didn't bother me. I just considered it a warm-up.

Levels 2 and 3 steadily grow in intensity while still providing modifications in either direction. For instance, if you're feeling too challenged, you can keep doing a certain exercise in the simpler form it was done in the 1st level (shallower squats, less hopping) or you can do a slightly harder version of the exercise being shown (full push-up rather than knee push-up).

I'm not in the greatest shape but I have only been working out regularly for the past few months, so I found Level 2 a nice challenge without leaving me exhausted and impatient for it to end within the first 60 seconds. Others may not agree. It all really depends on where you're at in your fitness level.

I'd definitely suggest it to beginners or casual, non-fanatical exercisers who want a good sweat without any serious pain.",1403308800,2,1665,4.611486486486487
4617441,4,B0058ZPNUY,"This workout dvd is great if you are a true beginner. And by that, I mean very new to exercise, or very over weight with limited mobility. Chris Powell works with obese/morbidly obese people, so he is aware that there are limitations, especially in the beginning of a weight loss journey. The workouts go at a slow pace and are very clear. The movements are somewhat simple, but you do feel the burn. I will say though, there is quite a bit of movement on and off the floor, so be aware and cautious if you have troubles with your knees or back or things like that. You will have to make that transition quite a bit - that's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars, because it caught me by surprise a little bit. Overall, if you are in the beginning stages of losing weight and really just need to get in the habit of regular movement, this is a great starting point. Also, if you watch Extreme Weight Loss, a few past contestants are in the video. Chris is also a nice motivator.",1402963200,4,978,4.235294117647059

I am losing pounds, inches and seeing my clothes fit better.  I am following a low-carb eating plan and feel better too.  I like doing this in the privacy of my home in the morning before work cuz I am not into gyms.  I have moved from level 1 to level 2 as of today.  So far, I'm sticking with it and I am not bored.

4617458,5,B0058ZPNUY,"I am the anti-workout queen! I hate doing it yet I know something has to change or I will never reach my goal of being healthy (and smokin' hot for my husband, of course). Chris Powell's video actually surprised me because he was so nice and so motivational. It's almost like he used to be fat too. He seems to really understand just how difficult it can be for some people to move, especially in a way that they are not accustomed to. I loved the fact that he talks you through with care and patience and he begins with small movements that anyone can do (YES, ANYONE). Although I felt that it was a bit easier than I thought it would be to do the workouts, it does come with different levels and each one adds a little more so eventually, for a larger person, it becomes just enough to do without adding an ""I can't keep up, I quit"" mentality. It definitely gets your heart racing and makes you feel good that you could actually accomplish something, physically. Being a size 20W, I felt the workout was geared toward people at least my size, if not larger simply because the movements were so basic and small. Perfect for people that hate to workout, like me! Just give it a try if you are a couch potato like myself and want to begin the process of getting healthy. You won't be disappointed.",1394409600,4,1296,4.337448559670782

With the help of an excellent naturopath and a good friend who was determined to get well and shared what she has learned with me - I have been fighting my way back to health
 This video is excellent for anyone who wants to get back into shape, but needs to start with a program that is beyond their present capabilities. The video has 3 levels of workouts so you can start at an appropriate level, but still progress to more challenging workouts. Chris Powell is encouraging and positive while still helping you make progress without becoming so overwhelmed that you despair and feel like you just can't progress. I highly recommend this video to anyone who needs an exercise program they can do at home that actually can help you get your strength and your life back.

4617474,5,B0058ZPNUY,"I'd recommend this to anyone who is obese and wants to begin a workout designed for them.

If you're familiar with the show Extreme Makeover: Weight Loss Edition you know trainer Chris Powell works with people who are severely overweight/obese and this DVD is the perfect starting point for anyone who falls into that category. It took me months to actually try the DVD because I was afraid of it being above my fitness level (I was 300 lbs and very sedentary) and it was amazing. Level 1 is only about 10 minutes long which made it feel a lot more doable. He knows who his target audience is and offers modifications and support the whole time. In 10 minutes I was sweating and felt like I got a full workout even with simple moves with squats and getting on all fours and standing back up. He does a full warm up and cool down too.

After a month of level 1 I have moved onto level 2. It's been 2 weeks (of every other day) and can do pushups onto my knees. I pour sweat and I still feel like I get a full workout in my living room. There are 3 levels, all with modifications, and even an option to play all the levels back to back for when you reach maximum strength. I've already ordered his other DVD so I can switch up my workouts.",1391644800,,1237,4.19327731092437
4617475,3,B0058ZPNUY,"Its a little slow...  I tried the first 2 parts, and it was obviously for people who can barely get off the couch...  It would be a good video for someone who is severely overweight that has a hard time moving.

Level 3 gets my heart rate up to around 150-160 but averages 130-140, but the workout doesn't go fast enough and I get bored after about 20 min... I have to throw in some stuff while waiting for the video to move on...  And now that I know it a little I just do some extra moves while they talk and adjust their movements on the video.

As a reference, I am a 32 yr old F approx. 275 lbs.  Just in case others looking are around the same...  I used to do all kinds of boot camps, and gravity, kick boxing, but then killed my knees, and blimped out...

Now, I'm fat. Very obese. It's my own fault-- no exercise, eating what I want. Sitting all day at a computer.

I'm very upset with my body and the few times I actually look in the mirror... it's depressing.

As a promise to the Mrs, I promised to lose weight and live longer. With his book and this video I'm on my weight.

I'm currently on Level 1 and 10 years ago this would be a warm up. Today, it's kicking my ass. But Chris is amazingly motivational. This video is exactly what I need and ordering it was the best thing I've done for myself in years.

If you find level 1 too easy -- awesome. I'm not past it yet, so I congratulate you on not getting to the point I have.

There's two more levels to go... and for the first time in a long time, I'm excited to get there.",1391472000,15,872,3.954285714285714

I can actually make it through the whole workout which makes it less frustrating.  Love Chris Powell.,1389657600,,247,4.545454545454546
4617481,5,B0058ZPNUY,"I am obese but I have a pretty athletic background.  Still, I'm pretty out of shape.  The levels aren't particularly difficult exercises but they can be a challenge for large people.  Luckily, the guy on the video is encouraging if you need to take it slower or tone down the intensity of the exercise.  There's also typically someone with him doing a ""modified"" or less intense version of the workout.  It seems like this Chris guy did the video with larger people in mind, and that's a very nice touch.  It was a little awkward at first and I felt kind of silly, but it was really easy to get into everything and follow along.  And although the exercises really get your heart pumping, they never go too fast and even encourage you to take it slower if you're feeling like it's a little too intense.  I recommend this for people just getting into their weight-loss routine.  It's a very encouraging start, and I know from experience that it's so much easier to stay motivated when you have someone encouraging you and doing it with you--even if they are just on the TV screen.",1389225600,4,1078,4.515463917525773

As someone who's gone from fit-to-fat myself, I think this video is a great way for me to get my big heiny moving now.

I think it is more of a workout for someone who has not worked out ever or not very often as it is very basic. It is more of a stepping stone for fitness. I do like how basic it is for now tho. I have not worked out in a while and my body can tell. This is perfect for working my way back into exercising. I would say this is a very good beginner workout.

Right now I do nothing, outside of an occassional walk. I have about 30-40lbs to lose. I was able to do the first workout with minimal difficulty. For the first time I didn't feel lost, uncorrdinated and completely out of shape!!! I have in the past with home workout videos and that has led to frustration and giving up. It was perfect to ease into regular activity. Although I didn't break into a sweat, I could do all of the moves and repetitions with some challenge and I could definately feel that it worked my muscles the next day. And it only took 15 minutes! I can squeeze that into my day! I'm not a big Extreme Makeover viewer, but I really liked the instructor. He made me feel comfortable and, although it was relatively easy, that I was on the right track. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who needs to simply get moving, but is intimidated by the gym and amount of time a typical workout takes.

What I like about it most is that you are working out with people who actually lost weight from doing it, and because they are not skinny or at their desired weight, it makes it more realistic and encouraging to do. Each level is easy, but a little more to do as you bump it up. It makes me sweat, but does not wipe me out. After I finish the workout I am usually energized and head right for the shower.

4617578,5,B0058ZPNUY,"I've been disappointed with other videos in the past that were marketed to 'beginners' or had multiple levels that in fact were completely inappropriate for very overweight individuals who wanted to work out at home. The Biggest Loser series (which do actually include modified moves but there are some exercises that I found impossible even at level one) as well as any of Jillian Michaels' DVDs come to mind. To be clear, those aforementioned workouts are GREAT if you're closer to a normal or 'overweight' size, but when you're out of shape or need to lose 100+lbs they can be frustrating. This workout- at least the level one workout I just finished- is completely free of moves that I can't do- there are no 'mountain climbers', actual push ups, planks, jumping jacks that would likely injure an ankle, etc.

So onto this DVD- So I just tried the first of three workouts-just 15 minutes-and I am legitimately sweating. At my weight and given the fact that I haven't been working out regularly, I decided to start at the beginning and I'm glad I did. I know that I got a decent workout, but I also wasn't frustrated by moves that I can't do. Everything was slow, steady, and modified for actual overweight beginners. I am excited to try level two (25 minutes) soon, but I may stick with level one for the next week or so.

In my opinion, this DVD fills a niche and is a bargain at under $8. Definitely worth it.",1359072000,9,1415,4.566929133858268

I bought  and read Chris' book, ""Choose to Lose"" and I was motivated enough to buy this dvd.  Three weeks ago, I started to work out on Monday-Friday Level 2 of this dvd.  My waist size was 34.  After three weeks of working out, my new waist size is 32.  I was astonished by the results I have obtained by this dvd.  I feel more energetic and I'm wearing skirts that I stopped wearing because of my waist size.

I kept making excuses for not working out (tired, not feel up to it, next week, etc.). Not anymore, I'm determined to exercise because of how I feel now about myself.  Chris Powell is an excellent motivator.  He says to not give up and to push ourselves.

4617696,4,B0058ZPNUY,"I love Chris Powell and love watching the show.  I typically consider myself beginner-intermediate, and level 1 of this dvd was WAY too easy for me.  It's definitely meant for someone extremely out-of-shape and/or obese.  Level 1's exercises are gentle and slow.  Chris Powell is encouraging and good with cueing.  Since I am not THAT much of a beginner, I ended up doing a Biggest Loser workout after completing this level 1 workout so that I could get my heart rate up.

I skipped level 2 and went directly to level 3, which is more my level.  I usually have to modify a lot of exercises on other dvds (like BL & Jillian dvds) but with this level I only had to modify the jumping jacks (my knees and back can't handle actual jumping) and the push-ups (because my upper body strength is practically non-existent!).  Some of the other exercises I did decide to do a little faster than they were doing on the dvd because it wasn't getting my heart rate up enough.  However, the last section of level 3, the endurance section, has you do 4 sets of different exercises, 20 seconds on then 10 seconds rest, and those did test my endurance!  The endurance segments included squats, push-ups, sit-ups, and bridges.  I can feel it in my quads and arms the most.

I would recommend this dvd for someone who is severely out-of-shape or obese and looking for a good beginner's workout.  If you have done workout dvds like the Biggest Loser or Jillian Michaels series then this will probably be too easy for you.  I will probably keep it in my library to mix things up a bit with the level 3 workout.",1341446400,9,1589,4.491289198606272

I would recommend this video to anyone who hasn't worked out before or hasn't worked out in a long time and one who is over weight or obsese not for the skinny workout queen or king.  Chris does a great job with this video and uses people he has worked with to help lose weight.  I also like he doesn't use all skinny people in the video.  This is intimidating to some over weight people.  I really think if your looking for a video that is for a true beginner you won't go wrong purchasing this one.  There is 3 levels to this video so you can start out slow and work your way up to a more fat burning workout.  Very simple easy to follow video.

It is a great tape for those of you just starting off, but if you are in semi okay shape I would only recommend if you can make yourself work harder than they do in the video. I won't lie I was sore the next day, but I feel like I wouldn't have been if I was working at the intensity they were on the video. The good thing is it offers low impact for people with bad knees, and it also offers variations of intensity for beginningers and such.

I don't understand why this workout video received so few stars by some of the viewers.  I'm not overweight but needed something a little bit lower impact and this video delivered exactly what I was looking for.  I average 5 miles daily on the elliptical or treadmill and this video still gave me a decent workout and was easy on my joints.  THE VIDEO SAYS IT IS LOW IMPACT right on the case cover!

<My Bodymedia Data:> My weight fluctuates between 115-130 and I'm in my late 30's  5ft 4in.
Level 1 I burned 40 calories (2.8 per minute avg)  216 steps with activity of 09 minutes moderate 00 vigorous.
Level 2 I burned 127 calories (4.3 per minute avg)  892 steps with 19 moderate activity minutes and 05 vigorous.
Level 3 (modified) I burned 137 calories (4.0 per minute avg) 1415 steps  19 moderate activity with 07 vigorous.

The only thing I would have liked would have been a visual countdown clock for each interval and a couple of the kickboxing workouts didn't feel balanced.
