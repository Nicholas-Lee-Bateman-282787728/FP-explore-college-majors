7346955,5,B012DCNKDQ,"Among other good things one can say about Pat Metheny, is that he and his people make really nice videos to document the best of his work. The live videos are really satisfying and well done. With this release, Pat takes a different approach. Rather than recording a live gig, he puts himself and the other members of the Unity group on a stage with camera operators on the stage. His goal, he says in the liner notes, was to provide the viewer something like the experience of the musicians on stage. So, that's the background. What you have on this fine video, as with the concerts and the 2 Unity Band studio recordings, is a group of musicians with impeccable taste, full command of their instruments, playing original compositions by Pat Metheny. There can be nothing bad about that. I'm grateful this came out, which I'll enjoy as a memento of being able to see this band in Atlanta this year.",1441756800,21,899,4.555555555555555
7346956,5,B012DCNKDQ,"I also just received my BD of this amazing finale of this group. I was fortunate to be able to see them twice last year. First early on in Topeka,KS on March 8th. Then later on July 26th in KC with Hornsby. Now this beautifully recorded and filmed encore. Methenys music, ranging from state of the art ""straight ahead"" Jazz, to pastoral ballads, always presents the musicians with a challenge. To accurately interpret his complex compositions, interact with your bandmates, and then evolve towards an even greater interpretation is what the ""Unity Sessions"" is all about. Pat makes it easier, because he writes with his bandmates abilities and strengths in mind. The ""Evolution"", and ""Realization"" of each piece is really wonderful. I am a huge fan of the PMG of years past, ""As Falls Wichita, SFWF"" brought me into the ""fray"", saw em live in SF. However, this band takes me to that same, but evolved place, unbelievably awesome music!! As a guitarist myself, I won't attempt to describe each songs ""re/evolution"" over the last couple years. Fortunately, ""Unity Band"", ""Unity Group"", and now ""Unity Sessions"" documents this awesome piece of ""MUSIC HISTORY"". All the musicians on this recording deserve an ""Encore"". Thanks Pat!!!!!!!!!!",1441497600,15,1235,5.0588235294117645
7346957,5,B012DCNKDQ,"Fortunately I received an early release bluray copy from Metheny.com store order today.  What can I say... As a Metheny fan this is a blessing... Amazing sound and HD video. What a treat. Amazing musicians. This is not a live concert show, it appears to be made specifically for fans. The band plays at its peak of amazing. Your own personal concert with close ups you cant get at a live gig. This is close to the set I saw Unity Band play here in PA last spring 2014 for KIN tour and the guitar Medley he played on the campfire tour with Bruce Hornsby 2014 that included the Sun in Montreal.  Some amazing suprises I never saw live like Go Get It duo just Pat and Antonio jam rock out; Chrokee with Pat and Chris- Wow! Fun all around, Chillax and enjoy this amazing performance. As a fan, This video is opening to your musical heart and mind and will leave you blissed out on a metheny high.",1441065600,9,892,4.272189349112426

A long time fan of Pat Metheny and the Pat Metheny Group, I got to see him on tour with the Unity Group and really enjoyed the performance of the musicians and the group. Almost overwhelmed.

7346960,5,B012DCNKDQ,"I have been very fortunate because I've followed Pat Metheny for more than thirty years and I have been able to see all its concerts here in Spain, the last of them in Fuengirola-Mlaga two years ago with the Unity Band on the King album presentation.
This bluray is an excellent job. It's impossible to play better that these extraordinary musicians do it. They are not only very great instrumentalists. Moreover they know to convey all the emotions and you can really realize the greatness of their humanity and enormous sensitivity. About Chris Potter and Benjamin Williams they are a great addition to this Pat's new group and already produced a huge surprise to me a couple of years ago. Noteworthy is also the enormous collaboration of Giulio Carmassi.
All my life I've also been a big fan of Charlie Haden, someone much more than a friend for Pat Metheny and his spirit is also present in some way at this great bluray.
Thank you so much for your music, Unity Band. Thanks for everything Pat and I hope see you soon again in Spain.
Good bless you all !!!",1489968000,,1060,4.58421052631579

7346965,5,B012DCNKDQ,"The music is great. The musicians are great. The camera work is great. The sound is great. The interviews are not a reason to buy this disk, though I enjoyed watching them. We don't learn much about the musicians or the music from watching them, but they are enjoyable and help convey the optimistic and good hearted spirit of these sessions.

By this time, Metheny is a bit remote and unapproachable. He is one of the two or three most popular and most important jazz musicians in the world, and the interviews do almost nothing to help us better understand him. But this hardly matters. The music is so good, the songs are so good, the musicians and the whole production are so good, that one just sits back in awe and enjoys a cornucopia of joys.

Both Potter and Antonio Sanchez are impeccable in general, and never more so than on these songs. I don't know Ben Williams as well as the other three, but he is excellent throughout this session. These guys are pros, and this whole disk represents the very peak of modern jazz and modern media production. If you like Pat Metheny at all you are going to love this disk. This is more than just good music, this is an amazing opportunity to watch great jazz being made in an intimate and revealing video.",1471046400,4,1254,4.471615720524017

7346971,5,B012DCNKDQ,"Not sure where to place this disc.  Somewhat avante guard?  Somewhat straight ahead?  A whole lot of Pat Metheny?  A bit of ""Orchestron""  As Pat once said, ""our sets are a bit of where we were, where we are and where we're going"".  This effort certainly fills the bill!

The musicianship of the five members is just incredible.  Until the first Unity disc I'd never heard of Chris Potter.  Wow!  Glad I purchased this DVD.  One thing to hear the group.  Another to see them.  Sad I missed their local show last year.  Vegas called.",1457308800,,531,4.4526315789473685

7346977,4,B012DCNKDQ,"I've consistently received great joy and uplift from Metheny's work since Phase Dance and small local venues. I'm 4-staring this work because the up-close camerawork reveals something that I have a hard time reconciling with the feelings that the music convey: the apparent absence of expressed feeling among these players. I get that making great music is great work; I get that they're documenting in a sterile (albeit well-known-to-them) studio environment; I get that its a group phase finale. Aside from one early hint of a slight maybe grin by Chris Potter I do not see an instant  not one instant  of bright eyes, happy looks, exchanges, any outward manifestation of happiness, delight, joy, alone or together. I see overly serious cats and this negatively impacts one of the primary reasons we listen to and watch live performance. Yeah, I know: it's about the music. Yes and no.",1451520000,2,887,4.986486486486487
7346978,5,B012DCNKDQ,"Pat is one of my all-time favorite musicians.  And I've learned that it's difficult to like everything he does.  It's just that, for me, when he get's it right, his music is among the best that can be had.  The Unity Band is one of his forays into a traditional straight-ahead jazz setting.  These are all incredibly adept musicians playing at the highest possible level.  Most of the dvd, then, is either great ensemble jazz quartet/quintet music or softer Pat-focused solos.  Anyone who is a ""Pat fan"" or a lover of well-played jazz will enjoy this dvd.  But, for me, one song, ""Born"" has a universal and instant appeal.  This is one of those slow starting, slow burning, layered, building-to-a-peak masterpieces that leaves you feeling like you just went through a very emotional, very spiritual experience.  I've shown this track to many friends now, some of whom could care less about ""jazz"" and never heard of Pat Metheny. And all have been impressed and deeply moved by watching and listening to this piece of music.  And, please understand. I've listened to ""Born"" on youtube (sound only) and liked it.  But, there is something about watching it performed ""live"" by these great musicians displaying both intense passion and incredible restraint that brings this song to another level.  ""Born"" would not have been out of place on the wonderful Metheny/Haden ""Missouri Sky"" cd.  Beyond ""Born"", there's a lot to be appreciated on this dvd.  Of course, Pat, as always is on his game.  He's just one of the all-time great guitarists.  The drummer, Antonio Sanchez, shows unbelievable versatility and imagination yet never overpowers the rest of the band.  Chris Potter gives performance after performance that shows why he is considered to be among the best sax players.  And, Ben Williams, proves easily that he belongs in the company of these legends as he plucks, picks and bows his upright bass.  I should also mention that this is a ""live"" performance done in a studio, so there is no crowd noise.  This allows for precision playing and the sound on this disc is fabulous.  A fifth musician, Giulio Carmassi shows up from time to time to contribute additional textures to the proceedings and Pat has also included a touch of his programmed instruments from his Orchestrion experiments, which add some interest.  All in all, if you appreciate Pat Metheny or great jazz, you will appreciate this whole dvd.  But, my guess is that even if your musical tastes are not that specific, you will still love ""Born"".  Be sure to turn up the volume or listen to it on good headphones.",1451433600,3,2581,4.840182648401827
7346979,3,B012DCNKDQ,"I got the chance to check out Pat Metheny's Unity Sessions and I really wasn't that impressed.  The quality in the picture was superb, but the actual session with the musicians was boring to me.  I didn't find that much umph in the music, kinda put me to sleep in some aspect.  I think this DVD should just be a CD and serve as background music.  Kinda slow.",1447113600,2,358,4.220588235294118

But it's just not my type of jazz.  Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays are my generation's Gershwins and I miss having them around.",1444694400,3,293,4.105263157894737

7346988,5,B012DCNKDQ,"Better than being there--is that possible? I've followed Pat Metheny for thirty years and Chris Potter for twenty, so it was a great pleasure to catch Unity live at the Monterey Jazz Festival a couple years ago. Sure, it was cold, our seats were the equivalent of the left field bleachers (without the elevation) and the chairs themselves haven't been updated since I saw Miles there in '63. But there's nothing like LIVE.  But this DVD might almost make me rethink that statement. At first it seemed odd--no audience, no applause at the end of each number, a fade to black after each tune. But what's gained is extraordinary. Since the cameras are multiple and creatively utiiized, we get to view up very close the incredible passionate dexterity of these great artists. Antonio Sanchez--wow, he really does play all that at once and make it sound musical and great and somehow support everything going on in the group. BIRDMAN--why, yes, but add in another super-hero or two; This guy is now officially a national treasure. In additiom to the rousing tenor, Chris Potter plays guitar (wow!). flute, bass clarinet and soprano.

For this one night, I'm glad the Unity band played without an audience. Inspiring, challenging, unique, it's one music video that I'm going to play again and again.",1443398400,18,1293,4.899543378995434

8726036,5,B012DCNKDQ,"Earlier in the decade, jazz guitarist Pat Metheny began experimenting with robotic, electrical manipulation of a variety of musical instruments.  The capper was a video that came out in 2012 called The Orchestrion Project. Working with engineers he plays by himself on a variety of instruments backed by a mechatronics band.  It is a brilliant concept and an artistic and musical masterpiece.  To top things off, it is on Blu ray in 3D!

A few years later I was able to see Pat and his Unity Band live in Dallas.  Metheny had taken a few pieces of his ghost orchestra with him on the road.  It was fun to see and hear.  But it is still a small portion of what this latest album contains from a musical perspective.  His Unity Band didn't stop after their tour but went into the studio and recorded this video.  Granted, there is no live audience other than those working the production and there are clear editing stops and starts with each track, but it is still highly effective.

Metheny plays the usual assortment of unusual guitars and electronics.  Others in the band are Giulio Carmassi on keys, flugelhorn and vocals; Chris Potter on various saxes, guitar, flute and an interesting bass clarinet; Antonio Sanchez on drums and cajon and finally Ben Williams on acoustic and electric bass.  It all comes together perfectly.

The Blu ray includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 which is what I listened to.  It is very enveloping and certainly better than the compressed Dolby Digital 5.1.  There is also an uncompressed LPCM 2.0 version which I plan on checking out in my dedicated music room when I get a chance.  The 1080p video resolution is fine but unexceptional.  The only extra is a series of short interviews with the band and why they are part of the project.  Subtitles are in English, German, Spanish and French.  Here is the track list:
