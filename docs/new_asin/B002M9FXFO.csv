8373634,5,B002M9FXFO,"The 1962 British film, DON'T TALK TO STRANGE MEN begins w/ the murder of a young woman, her body uncovered by a group of children. The scene switches to another girl named Jean Painter (Christina Gregg), who, while waiting for a bus, receives a bizarre call in a call-box, from a strange man. Intrigued and full of romantic notions, Jean awaits a second call from the man, not realizing that he has a dark agenda. The more she talks to him, the more she reveals about herself. Poor, innocent Jean gives away more and more information as the man questions her. Finally, a meeting is arranged. Jean's parents are oblivious to the situation. She's told only her little sister, Ann (Janina Faye- THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS). Will sis spill the beans before it's too late?  DTTSM is a perfectly-paced, old-school cautionary tale w/ just enough suspense. You'll never look at call-boxes in the same way again!...",1420934400,,903,4.751592356687898
