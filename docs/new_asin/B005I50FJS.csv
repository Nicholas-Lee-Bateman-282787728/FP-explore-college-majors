4708266,5,B005I50FJS,"I love this DVD because I have the ""wonderful"" pear body type and the two sections for legs and buns are a great for my problem areas.  That being said, I feel like the exercises are easier on your joints than other such lower body workouts I have seen in other DVD's that target that area. The DVD also contains other sections such as swan arms and a general all-over body workout as well. Furthermore Mary Helen Bowers is very present without being perky.  Her body is gorgeous but I never feel like she is rubbing that fact in my face, but instead she wants the viewer to improve and feel better about him or herself. Finally as an adult ballet dancer, I have been having some problems/pain in my hip flexors, after doing this workout, the pain has lessened quit a bit.",1324339200,22,772,4.391608391608392
4708267,5,B005I50FJS,"I really love the Ballet Beautiful work-out dvd! The videos give me a great work out and I've been seeing fantastic results! I particularly love that there is an option to play all the videos or you can pick and choose. I usually like to do the 15-minute Ballet Beautiful Body as a warm-up to the 60-minute dvd (sold separately) and every other day I'll end with another 15-minute Blast video. For me, the specific focus on form and my core took a little getting used to but once I got used to it, I started really getting a lot more out of my work outs. I really like that these videos are portable and I don't need any extra equipment to get results. I recently brought this dvd with me on my trip to Seattle and I just did two of the Blast videos in my hotel room every day and I didn't feel like I took a huge break from working out. I love that Bowers (Ballet Beautiful Founder) encourages stretching between sets; I did dance in high school but haven't done it since so my flexibility had not been the same, but after only a month of this video 6-7 times a week, my flexibility is back to when I was in high school. I couldn't be happier with my purchase! Along with this video and eating a balanced, healthy diet, I'm down to 120 from 130 and I don't think I'll be giving up this method any time soon!",1319673600,26,1308,4.173913043478261

8474232,5,B005I50FJS,"The first time I did it I could not finish it because it is really hard. But it is definitely working, I could feel it in my glutes. Plus, I love Mary Helen Bowers, she is so soft-spoken and she makes you do quick stretches every couple minutes between exercises.",1358121600,4,263,4.28
8474233,5,B005I50FJS,"I LOVE these workouts!  I'm not a ballerina. Sure, I took ballet when I was 6, but that was a looooong time ago.  I'm the type of person who can't walk across a room without tripping, so I was a bit wary, but Mary Helen Bowers makes me feel like I'm warming up for a performance of ""Swan Lake.""  The Swan Arms workout, in particular is a killer.  It doesn't look that difficult, but OUCH!  Proof that you don't need any equipment to get a good workout.
I find myself standing taller after these workouts, as well. And I love that I can do anywhere from 15-60 minutes. Definitely recommend!",1353801600,6,589,4.318181818181818
8474234,1,B005I50FJS,"I found her annoying, self conscious and boring. (Okay, she IS thin and beautiful so maybe I'm hating -- just a little.)  But seriously, I like Leah Sarago, Ellen Barret and Kulture series much more and find myself motivated to do them -- this one is collecting dust on the shelf.  It was challenging in the sense that the routine is totally monotonous -- but I didn't feel instantly leaner/taller and a little sore like I did with other videos.  If you are a die-hard ballet enthusiast, try the Kulture ballet series and/or the one by Ellen Gulan. Also, after learning that I couldn't return this DVD, I've decided to purchase my fitness DVDs only from Collage Video from now on.  (Sorry Amazon, you're pretty good for everything else but you need to make sure that your vendors have a more liberal return policy on this type of product which requires trial and era if you are going to compete with Collage.)",1342310400,6,909,4.592592592592593
8474235,5,B005I50FJS,"I studied ballet as a kid and teenager and have done all of the barre workouts, most recently Ballet Body which I really wanted to love, but don't.  Ballet Beautiful came up on my Amazon recommendations and on a whim, I ordered it.  While waiting for my DVD's to arrive I downloaded Mary Helen's steaming videos and was just in love with those cardio workouts!!  I have now completed the Blast DVD and it's amazing!  First off, she creates a very, very pleasant atmosphere with the lovely piano music, the white background and a very nice personality with no voice overs, it's so relaxing and time goes by so quickly!  I have done them all, including Jillian Michaels, these are the hardest workouts I have done and what I feel sets these apart from other barre workouts is the range of motion and the lengthening and stretching of each movement.  The ""bend, stretch, bend, stretch"" brought back memories!  I highly recommend these very high quality workouts, I have just started this week but cannot wait for the results!  I am an equestrian so workouts directly impact my riding, after just a week I have a better seat and more control in the saddle.  Thank you Mary Helen!!",1339113600,15,1176,4.642512077294686
8474236,4,B005I50FJS,"I haven't had this for long, but these are my first impressions.

First of all I've been a Tracy Anderson fan for the past 2 years or so. I actually got this as part of the 2-DVD pack (a steal!). So I thought I could handle this. But let me tell, you this lady kicks your butt in the gentlest way possible.

After a few days I can only get 3/4 through the Arms section, and I can only make it 3/4 of the way on each leg for Part 1 of the Butt section. I'm not even going to try Part 2 for now. These exercises leave me shaky and exhausted (and I can't even do them all!), but I feel like if you're a trooper you'll get fast results.

The Arms are sort of a more refined version of Tracy Anderson's arm exercises, and they freaking KILL! As for the Butt exercises, I am not going to lie--I have been cursing at the poor women while she smiles.

I left one star off because I feel like there's a lot of strain on my arms and wrists for some of these exercises, and I have to modify with some other exercises so as not to re-injure old injuries.",1338336000,23,1042,3.947619047619048
8474237,5,B005I50FJS,"I've only had this for almost 2 weeks and already see a difference in my back, butt, arms and I also feel like my stomach is somewhat flatter. Even my triceps are better & everyone knows that's a really annoying area to get in shape. I've actually felt like doing at least part of it almost every day, which is a big deal for me since I can get bored easily. I regret not just buying the bundle since I knew I was probably going to want both DVDS .
My only complaint is with the packaging. I feel like the center can put cracks in the inner circle of the DVD easily. I had this problem with another workout DVD so I don't actually push the DVD back in and I especially don't want this one to get ruined.",1335744000,11,703,4.0285714285714285
8474238,4,B005I50FJS,"Even if you are just starting out and your body can manage only one set of the exercises at first, you will still see results. They don't look all that strenuous to watch, but don't be fooled... they are! Set a timer, and build up to it.",1331164800,12,237,4.0638297872340425
8474239,5,B005I50FJS,I really do love it! I have no training in ballet or dance but I have done a ton of workout dvds. I have to say this one has changed my body! Really has! I feel stronger and my body looks stronger and healthier. You have to stay w/ it though. I really think this is more then worth the money.,1325203200,9,292,3.80327868852459
