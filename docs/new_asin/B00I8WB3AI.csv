6254053,4,B00I8WB3AI,"Les Mahoney's feature comedy ""Mike Case in: The Big Kiss Off"" is an entertaining, often surreal and sometimes dreamlike send-up of the classic film noirs, set seemingly in our present while still conveying many aspects of the 1940s, with many strange non sequitor, almost ""Airplane""-esque characters and situations.",1392076800,5,315,5.583333333333333

6254128,1,B00I8WB3AI,"This is a low budget flick that has such horrible dialog that I could only stomach about 10 minutes of it.  It is produced in the genre of the old time noir detective movies - think Bogart in any of the Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade roles, but with none of the directing talent of the filmmakers who actually debuted the genre, and certainly not the acting abilities of a Bogart.  I am generally a big fan of noir detective movies, and I had high hopes for this movie, but since my introduction to the genre was Bogart as Philip Marlowe in The Big Sleep and Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon, I have a tendency to use those as benchmarks.  If those movies are a 10, this movie is at best a 2, and that is using IMDB's 10 point scale instead of the less robust Amazon 5 star rating scheme.  Now, granted, it is supposed to be something of a comedic take on the genre, but even a comedic take needs at least a bit of acting talent and a decent script to pull things off, and that is not what you are getting here.  To say these actors are struggling to get into show business is probably understating the obvious.",1432512000,6,1107,4.178403755868545

6254137,4,B00I8WB3AI,"Funny and irreverent, ""Mike Case In:  The Big Kiss Off"" is a showcase of some very good, not yet famous indy actors doing a helluva job ad-libbing and making fun of all the film noir stereo types that we all know and love.  It's an easy, good time to watch and enjoy..  Give it some time and you'll find the rhythm.  Don't be a film snob or expect high gloss Hollywood (yawn) comic book heroes here, this is indy filmmaking and the work is tough (some uneven audio levels that actually I thought worked in certain cutaways) - but the talent in front of the camera is top notch.  There's Les Mahoney looking like Ben Affleck's scruffy older cousin as Mike Case and that beautiful Brunette Lieutenant Debra Mayer-- having fun, barely keeping their giggles under the surface in the back of the car, getting thru a scene about something - just riffing, having fun trying to be serious about finding Victoria's husband or whatever at about the 60 minute mark.. I can't remember what that scene was about, I just remembered I was in on the joke -- it really didn't matter to me.  They were having fun with this story and so was I at that point.  I wanted to see what would happen next.

Not so in the beginning.  I had a lot of laundry to fold this night and I figured I'd put on something I didn't have to pay much attention to for something to glance at up on the TV.  Well it took me about 5 minutes of watching this movie while folding my laundry that I started smiling.. and couldn't stop smiling at these characters and the actors .. smitten by the charm of what was being presented for me.  The director really let some scenes play out and gave the actors a long leash.  A lot of one-off scene stealing scenes of characters appearing - stealing a scene from Mike Case (or ""Casepi"" haha - or trying to be as nice as they can to one another in an art gallery) - then off we go to the next little turn in the storyline.  Yeah there was a reason for all this, but I wasn't paying much attention to much more than -- hold on second.  Hey, I just got another Twitter follower!  Oh.. now what was I saying...?

People, there is a small, quite, satisfying joy of finding movies I never heard of.. and then realizing, wow I'm a lucky guy.  This movie is good.  I'm being entertained.  I'm not folding my laundry anymore.  Now I want popcorn and some soda.. and to sit and freeze and watch what happens next to Mike Case.  I'll fold my damn laundry another day.  I'm not really a film noir aficionado.. I saw Chinatown & Casablanca.. and a few others I guess.. but I saw a lot of comedic mock-u-mentaries, poking fun at heavy metal music, small town theatre, dog shows, folk music and film-making itself - and ""Mike Case In: The Big Kiss Off"" is squarely in that crowd.  A fun time and worth a few a viewings.",1429488000,2,2800,4.291428571428572

It's the collective bits of genus that make it fun and let's face it, it's hard as hell to make a feature film to begin with. I applaud Les for sticking to his guns and finishing the race. This is the epitome of Indy filmmaking how you can do a lot with a little if you have good friends and an amazing support system. All in all it was a fun ride and I recommend its light comedic flair.

6254183,5,B00I8WB3AI,"Dive into some laughter-noir as low-budget shamus Mike Case gumshoes his way through a familiar gallery of hip & trendy shysters.  When femme fatale Victoria Billows hires him onto a missing husband case, it's because he's crooked enough to score & honest enough to... trust?  Case & Vinnie, the enforcer with a conscience, trade beatdowns like dancing partners.  On the upside, our man gives the shaft to more than one villain as he bedroom hops his way across the L.A. basin.  There's a wealth of community-arts Hollywood mojo in this persistently resourceful breakout indie.

The female cop should have had a hella lot more leads and control in the case and it was obvious Case was completely unnecessary. I would rather watch a movie on the female cop and the daily bulls*** she puts up with.

Mike Case acts like a child as shown in his scenes with Tahmal. And not to mention there's a difference between befriending various prostitutes for information sources and offensive fetishism.
