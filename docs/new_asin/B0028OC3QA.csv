8356488,5,B0028OC3QA,"This is really an excellent introduction to flyfishing for large mouth bass.  Dave Whitlock's manner is pleasant, his instructions are clear, and he seems to enjoy what he's doing. For the beginner, Whitlock discuss all the basics: lines, rods, reels, flies, casting, retrieves, etc.  But even an experienced fly fisher will find good stuff here, especially in the realm of handling the flies on and under the water.  It's my impression that this video was made at the time that Orvis was trying to encourage flyfishing for bass, and with the demise of that attempt, the video seems to have been allowed to go out of print...which is a pity, because this really is a well done piece.  If you have any interest in flyrodding for bass and still have the capacity to play VHS tapes, I'd encourage you to buy and watch this excellent video.",1312070400,,836,4.705479452054795
