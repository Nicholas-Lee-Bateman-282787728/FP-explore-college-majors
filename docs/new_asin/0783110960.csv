45990,5,0783110960,"This movie blew me away!!!!! All Americans for AMERICA MUST SEE THIS at least once! It does show how vulnerable we are even as a superpower! Don't wanna give the movie away BUT the last statement muttered from the terrorist ""Next time we'll bring both towers down!"" gave us some eerie chills!! Nuff said.",1064016000,4,304,4.648148148148148
45991,5,0783110960,"I had seen this movie before and specially bought it for the last scene. It's very ironic and somewhat scary to know that a movie dialoque can actually turn into a Catastrophe.
I have put up the ending clip which is very astonishing on Kazaa, search for ""shockingly rare"", (without the quotes) and you will see what I mean",1031011200,5,322,4.47457627118644
45992,5,0783110960,"It is haunting.  This is the one production that had a tragic, ominous promise to its ending - that no one paid attention to (myself included).  The production, of this HBO Movie, tried to tell us about a September 11th happening.  No one knew - that we didn't know to listen.",1023753600,3,276,4.372549019607843
45993,4,0783110960,"A made for T.V film about the bombing of the World Trade Center, done in a kind of 'Pulp Fiction' style with a kind of narration from the FBI man in charge of the investigation (Peter Gallagher)explaining to his superiors about the information they had on suspects movements before and after the attack. Slow at times with some decent acting and shots of the Center itself. The final scene and comment in the film, so ironic as to what would unfortunately take place 8 years later.",1012521600,,481,4.604651162790698
45994,3,0783110960,"This is a competent docudrama of how a terrorist cell managed to slip past the US authorities and set off an explosion in the World Tade Center. Unfortunately the film is too simplistic and does not delve into more complex issues beyond showing that the FBI screwed up.
  The arab actors have created dynamite performances to avoid stereotypes, however the script has oversimplified and reduced to jingoism the ideology that drives the Islamist extremists. The Blind Cleric is also a mere shadow of himself, as anyone who read any of his interviews will see for themselves. Nothing is said of how the war in Afghanistan has created these terrorists, nor of the conflict in Egypt out of which they came. The viewer does not get the sense of the volatile and explosive cauldron that is the revolutionary Middle East, nor of the US involvement in it.
  Perhaps it is too much to ask from a made for cable film, but the audience is none the wiser as to why and how after seeing the film. Other than that the actors portraying the terrorists electrify the film and offer a wry commentary on the civil liberties in the American society.",1005091200,10,1130,4.663316582914573
45995,5,0783110960,"I was astounded when I saw this film...The authorities had the information at its fingertips and missed everything in 1993 and again in 2001! A true docudrama, this film is very current to the events that are taking place today.  North Americans must never forget what happened both in 1993 and 2001. We must learn from past history. Punish those responsible and teach them a lesson they will never forget. If you were impacted by what happened on Sept 11th, you must watch this film! Will likely never air on TV again (too controversial)! A must have, Highly recommended!!",1004400000,3,573,4.787878787878788
45996,5,0783110960,"This engrossing movie examines the circumstances leading up to and the aftermath of the badly botched 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. By focusing more on the characters, both good and bad, than on the explosion itself, the film is able to avoid becoming another disaster movie.
It has strong parallels with the tragic events of September 11, 2001 and I found it moving. I cried several times while watching it. Highly recommended.",1000425600,6,438,4.9324324324324325
45997,5,0783110960,When I saw this movie for the first time. I was shocked to see that they ended to knock over both towers with this bomb in the first 1993 Attack. 8 Years later *somebody* *DID* it... A very haunting pre cursor of what was later to happen.,1000166400,2,238,4.085106382978723
46028,5,0783110960,"The movie is based on a real event, and is impressive how easy it was for the muslims extremist to get what they want and of the dangers this extremist could inflict. And how the investigation of the NYPD and the FBI helped to find them and to get the teacher of them who tried to be innocent.",1392681600,,293,4.068965517241379
46029,5,0783110960,"The theme of this movie is that terrorists have the will and unfortunately due to America's free and open society, along with the gross negligence and incompetence of some security officials, the means to commit deadly attacks. This movie was made 5 years before 9/11, and the very last line uttered before the credits roll will chill you.",1341187200,,339,4.862068965517241
46030,5,0783110960,"SOME TIME AGO, BEFORE 9/11 I HAD THIS FILM ON TAPE. NOW I WANTED TO HAVE IT ON DVD, TO KEEP FOR MEMORIE
OF SO MANY MISTAKES THE GOVERNMENT MADE THEN. TO KEEP MEMORIE OF A FATAL MOMENT FOR NOT LISTENING TO
A WARNING FROM THE TERRORISTS. ALSO ENTERING THE USA SO EASY, ESPECIALLY THESE PEOPLE.
YET IT SAYS THE ""LAND OF THE FREE"" NOW THEY ARE FREE AND WE ARE THE 'PRISONERS OF OUR SECURITY' THAT MAKE US NOT

46031,5,0783110960,"This is the true story of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Included in the film is the assasination of Rabbi Meir Kahane by the cousin of one of the bombers, the beloved Rabbi was shot in the face in front of almost 2,000 audience members during his speach at the Marriott East on Lexington Avenue in the heart of Manhatten, Also documented is the bungling of the FBI in their handling of the Rabbi's assasination, and the consequenses the nation suffered as a result. This movie covers every aspect of the emergence of Al Queda, even as early as 1990, when the Rabbi was assasinated, through 1993 when the Rabbi's assasin El Sayid Nossair's cousin perpetrated the bombing of the World Trade Center. If you care about historical truth, this film is for you.",1284854400,2,761,4.644444444444445

46033,5,0783110960,"I wondered why such an excellent movie such as this took so long to get to the DVD market, with some of the other HBO movies going to DVD almost immediately.

Nevertheless, I have read many of the factual reports of many of the incidents that occur in this movie. Particularly, when one terrorist returns to the Ryder rental to collect his deposit, with the FBI in wait. That's right. After the WTC bombing, he returned for the deposit on the Ryder truck that they exploded in the WTC basement.

But the most sobering moment of the movie, is at the end. Where some prophetic words are used, and in hide sight, should make every American angry. This is a must see. So see it.",1210809600,4,674,4.384
46034,5,0783110960,"A few years ago, I flat our refused to watch any movie on the terrorist attacks on the US. Too ugly, too painful, too real. My brother ended up convincing me to watch this movie, and I was amazed at how much I liked it. This movie was made before 9/11, and the original FBI investigators were consulted when this movie was made so it would be accurate. The terrorist training tapes that are seen in this film are real, too.

For most of this movie, you would think it was comical if not true. There were so many close calls for these terrorists while they were planning the attack, they had the police and FBI on them a lot, but because of laws (many made during the Clinton era) they ended up being protected rather than prosecuted.

I completely recommend this movie! It is informative and fascinating; it moves quickly and keeps the watcher captivated. It is sad, because this attack did go forward (even though not as planned) and people died - but it is an important part about American history that we need to know and remember.

I am also disturbed/intrigued by the last line of the movie. One of the terrorists is arrested and looks at the World Trade Centers. He says something like ""the next time, they will both go down."" The terror attacks of September 11th, 2001 took years to plan. I think he knew.

Tagline: No one expected a terrorist attack on U.S. soil. But many could have prevented it.

Rent it, buy it, just make sure you watch this movie!!!",1184198400,10,1462,4.440298507462686
46035,5,0783110960,"Path to Paradise shouldn't offend anyone who lost a friend or family member on 9/11 or in February of 1993. It wasn't created to play on your fears or insult the memory of those who died. It was created to explore the 1993 truck bombing and just happened to be an excellent forecaster of the 9/11 attacks. In this sense, it was way ahead of its time. Every person who viewed this show after 9/11 most likely scratched their heads and said ""why didn't anybody see this coming?"" Hollywood has done its best job at blurring the lines between poetic license and reality in this movie. It would be a five star effort even if 9/11 had not happened.",1095033600,7,642,4.4033613445378155
46036,5,0783110960,"We were warned about destruction of the WTC eight years in advance. This HBO documentary proves this (circa 1997). Many lies have been told to us from our government about 9/11.

In the documentary the ""organizer"" of the 1993 WTC bombing, Ramsi Yusef, tells the FBI agent escorting him back to NYC that ""Next time we will take them BOTH down"". This documentary was shown on HBO almost daily up until the Sept 11, 2001 tragedy- BUT HAS NOT BEEN BROADCAST ONCE SINCE 9/11... Why is that? Why is HBO suppressing this powerful documentary? You must watch this!!!

Let's petition HBO to rebroadcast the documentary.",1094688000,12,610,4.8
46037,5,0783110960,"An HBO production, amazing actors, superb dialog. A bomb-making
expert from Iraq attempts entry to the U.S. without a visa. He states he's leaving Iraq for political asylum in the U.S. The INS agent questions him a bit, looks over his fishy looking passport. She approaches her superior with the asylum application
and urges that ""he should be detained"". ""Jails are full. You want to take him home?"" her boss retorts. The film shows just how these terrorists jumped through about any and every loophole in the system under the guise of religious freedom. Bomb-making right in the apartment. Operating right under the nose of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. Anti-American propaganda tapes found in an apartment which, truth be told, is not against the law. And of course there was the chilling prophetic line at the end: ""Next time we'll bring them both down."" Absolutely worth watching again and again.",1080950400,10,914,4.980392156862745

There were a lot of exposures of screw ups by the government.  But I do better understand some of the laws that were since implemented.  Not sure I agree, but I get it.",1438819200,,336,3.8115942028985508

7790084,5,0783110960,"I remember seeing this movie on HBO way before 911 happened.  It is a docudrama about the first bombing of the World Trade Center and the government's determination to find the people who did this and stop them from their evil plans to do more harm.  The most amazing line in the whole story is at the end (stop reading here if you don't want to know what happens).  The government men are flying over Manhattan in a helicopter with the mastermind of this plot and as they pass over the WTC he looks at them and says, ""Next time we'll bring them both down.""
