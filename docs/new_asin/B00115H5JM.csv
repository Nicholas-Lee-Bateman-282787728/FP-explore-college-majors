8240589,2,B00115H5JM,Love the Movie but the recording was off on the sound in one section (lasted about 30-45 seconds).  This is a fairly close representation of the book and great as an intro to young children.,1503446400,,190,4.428571428571429

This animated version can not hold a candle to the Mickey Mouse version.",1478995200,,258,4.586956521739131
