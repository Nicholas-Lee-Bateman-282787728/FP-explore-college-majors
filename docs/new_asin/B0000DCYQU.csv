8324154,3,B0000DCYQU,"This is not a great movie for movie making purists.  For those who like baseball history, it is a fine film that tells the story of Jackie Robinson.  Jackie Robinson plays himself while being surrounded by familiar backlot faces and playing opposite Ruby Dee.  There is a lot for people to remember in this film.  Some may be offended by the racial slurs even though markedly toned down.",1180396800,2,387,4.647058823529412
