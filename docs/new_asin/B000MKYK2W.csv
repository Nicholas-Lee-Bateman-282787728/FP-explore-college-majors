8169604,1,B000MKYK2W,"This film is misleading to people who are not familiar with Rastafarianism. How can you do a film about ""Rent a Dreads"" (not rasta) but spend 90% of the film interviewing true Rastas? This misleads ignorant viewers to think they are one and the same. A proper director or producer would have been able to tell the true story here which is to highlight the contrast between the two. Instead the lines are blurred and the documentary does not really tell the story behind Rent a Dreads its instead a story about Real Rasta.",1312934400,,521,4.553191489361702
8169605,1,B000MKYK2W,"This film was well made but it is not about sex tourism. Ok maybe there is 5 minutes spent on that topic. This is a documentary about Rastas and the history of slavery in Jamaica. Why not just call it that? If you want to learn about female sex tourism, don't rent this film. You will get all you can learn from the trailer.",1278547200,,324,4.078125
8169606,5,B000MKYK2W,"This documentary was very informative.  It focuses on sex tourism in Jamaica.  The interviews, were quite interesting. It sheds light on a very real issue that not just Jamaicans but other West Indian/ Caribbean nations deal with.",1266796800,,230,5.1891891891891895
8169607,2,B000MKYK2W,"The video is deceptive on several levels.  Although ""sex tourism"" does go on, the director of this video fails to tell the viewer than he also exploits the locals by paying several locals $20.00 a piece to participate in this video without ever telling them the truth about what he is using them for.  What really is the difference the woman who buy them for sex or the director who is using them for his own personal gain and being extremely deceptive about it?  Having spent several years working with the poor I know these people personally and what he does to these poor people for $20.00 is shameful.  Further the title is deceptive as he is saying that everyone with locks is rasta and that is not true as rasta is a conception of the heart and not all dreaded humans live rasta.  The film actually covers very little of the true rasta livity and even the title is extremely offensive to real rasta as rasta cannot be bought or sold or rented.  It shows me that the creator of this video has very little overstanding of rasta in the first place. He also does little or no research of the economy before passing his judgment off on others.  A better title would be sex tourism of men wearing locks.  The word rasta really has no place in it. I have spoken to true rasta who were highly offended by this documentary as it is misleading to people as most rasta do not live this way at all.  Please bear in mind that the purchase of this product is encouraging the explotation of these poor people.",1233446400,3,1500,4.386281588447654
8169608,1,B000MKYK2W,"This description of this ""documentary"" is very misleading. Sex tourism of white women in Jamaica makes up less than 5% of the content. For the most part it's propaganda about Rastafarianism and rather incoherent at that. The thesis that white women paying 35-year-old rastas for sex is somehow akin to modern day slavery is absurd.",1211932800,,331,5.036363636363636
8169609,3,B000MKYK2W,"The doc is excellent for its exposition of Rastafarianism.  For that reason alone, it would be very interesting to watch, and it makes a great teaching tool.  Its narration on sex tourism (the purported main subject of the documentary) is much less successful, however.  It relies on distant shots of a few couples and interviews of a few folks from a bar.  A much more powerful teaching tool on sex tourism would be Heading South (Vers le sur) about such tourism in Haiti in the 1980s, even though it is a fictionalized feature film and thus much harder to excerpt.  Still, this doc is really so unsatisfactory on the topic - one which deserves extensive consideration, to be sure! - that I would recommend looking elsewhere.  Again, great very basic introduction to populist Rastafarianism, though....",1174694400,4,803,4.911111111111111
8169610,4,B000MKYK2W,"When white women flock to Jamaica for a little fun in the sun, the R&R they're often looking for is not ""Rest and Relaxation"" but to ""Rent a Rasta"" according to director J. Michael Seyfert. His eye-opening expose' of the same name sheds light on a barely acknowledged form of sex tourism, namely, white women who visit the Caribbean Islands to get their groove back with the help of black locals. This documentary claims that, each year, as many as 80,000 females from a variety of relatively-wealthy Western nations descend on Jamaica alone.

Most of those inclined to indulge their Island Fever with wanton abandon are apparently middle-aged and/or overweight spinsters. Ignored by white men, and afraid to date blacks openly due to the social taboo, they look for satisfaction at remote resorts amidst the anonymity offered by a virtual paradise. These decadent dames safely lure their boy toys with money, electronic gadgets, designer clothes, baubles, or whatever material item it takes to get uncomplicated sexual favors in return along with the strict understanding that like in Las Vegas, ""What happens in Jamaica, stays in Jamaica."" As one satisfied customer, a 45 year-old spinster from the Midwest explains her addiction to her hedonistic getaway, ""A girl who no one looks at twice gets hit on all the time here. All these guys are paying her attention, telling her she's really beautiful, and they really want her. It is like a secret, a fantasy, and then you go home."" While this glimpse of the lucky ladies' rationale for their no-strings liaisons is certainly informative, the picture is actually far more interesting when chronicling the history of Jamaica, winding its way from the slave days through the rise of the Rastafari to the present. Framed from this perspective, we suddenly see a persistent pattern of utter subjugation and economic inequality, with islanders providing stud service only being the latest form of exploitation.

Perhaps most telling is the desperate summation of a suffering black woman seen begging for an end to the Jamaican people's neverending cycle of poverty. She wants, ""the white world to come give us our deliverance, because it was them who take us out of our land and carry us here."" Viewed in this light, Rent a Rasta is a clarion call which establishes that sex tourism is not merely the harmless indulgence of horny white women gone wild, but a burgeoning trend which continues to wreak havoc on a Caribbean culture and family structure already in crisis.

8169611,5,B000MKYK2W,"This documentary about Jamaica reveals that men aren't the only ones who indulge in sex tourism. According to RENT A RASTA, each year 80,000 women travel to the island nation to meet a local man for a romantic rendezvous in exchange for cash and gifts from their home countries. This film examines the reaction of the Rastafarian culture to this phenomenon. Great film for Jamaica neophytes, finally someone decides to depict the latest version of slavery, sex tourism in Jamaica, with a twist. It's fat, ugly and old white broads who are the customers. A must see.",1171756800,4,565,4.835051546391752
