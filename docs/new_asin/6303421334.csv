639612,5,6303421334,"Bean and O'Mally,with great personality,lead their partial unit of ""95 the Rifles"" through great scenery,excellent story lines,and intriguing costumes and equipment not to mention enthralling accents so  thick you could hold up one of their sword bayonets (pointy end down).  This from husband of (non-violent)  Susan. I taught english at the fifth grade level for 24 years. If you are  kind,you will not grade this missive or look down on my use of words larger  than four letters.  Being a ""Johnny jump up"" is what I would  hope for my btn of inner city students.

639613,5,6303421334,"I first saw Sharpe's Rifles on PBS and found myself glued to the TV set. I didn't know that the series was on Video until I checked out Amazon.  These movies were excellent. The video is not exactly in tune with the  books, but frankly I didn't really care. Sean Bean is excellent as Sharpe,  good acting overall.",945129600,,313,4.362068965517241
639614,5,6303421334,"These are the best films of their type, ever. The writing is solid and the history only fudged where it has to be.  It's a little odd seeing them after reading all the books, since some stories have been merged and some  split apart, and some new characters appear.
My argument is with the  packaging.  Why are the films not in the chronological order of the events  in the Peninsular War, as the books are. Must be the order in which they  were made/shown?  Oh well, a small niggle with an other wise perfect film  experience.  I'll never read Sharpe again without hearing Sean Bean's  voice.",940550400,3,593,4.509433962264151
639615,5,6303421334,"How surprised I was the night I stayed up to watch some series on P.B.S. to see this fun and ""over the top"" romp! The harsh electric guitar put me off for a bit but now I see it adds to the whole mix of the  thing. I hate to seem shallow but the high points for me would be : Sean  Bean, the accents, the comraderie, the fights! Did I mention Sean Bean?  What a lark! One {well, three, six, nine} of the select movies I had to  own.",919728000,,432,3.7666666666666666
639616,5,6303421334,"If you like a blend of heroes, villains, victims and hells angels dropped into early 19th century Europe, where spies, sexy women, and a renegade soldier named Sharpe tear up Spain, Portugal and France against a backdrop  of revolutionary America, incendiary Irish and mad Scots, you will find it  here. Simple, complex, elegant and nasty, it is high drama, with a heavy  Darwinian message. Sean Bean makes James Bond look like a woos.",917049600,,435,4.931506849315069
7845804,5,6303421334,"Sharpe is the antithesis of Clint Eastwood, only in an English setting..Plenty of action
the good guy always wins plus fabulous scenery and battles. Worth watching.",1366156800,,164,5.346153846153846
7845805,5,6303421334,If you like this book series these TV shows are right up your alley.  They are well done and are a great addition to my collection.,1358812800,,131,4.038461538461538
7845806,4,6303421334,"I enjoyed watching this, and others from the series, tremendously.  The period setting is colourful and adventurous and makes a welcome change from the usual bang bang of US TV programmes.  Production quality is excellent and with Bean and other fine actors at the helm what more could you ask for.  Well worth the cost of a box set!",1010102400,2,333,4.610169491525424
7845807,5,6303421334,"From the moment Richard Sharpe saves Arthur Wellesley from 3 French dragoons, his life is changed forever. As the future Lord Wellington advises this hard bitten British soldier, ""You did me a damn good turn, now I'm going to do you a damn bad one"", and promotes the brave man to the rank of Lieutenant. However, our hero Mr. Sharpe is not what his fellow officers consider a ""gentlemen"". Not being of privileged birth in a system steeped in social stratification, our Richard must continue to demonstrate his worth by deeds of honor and valor. And, prove himself he does. Through each installment of this enjoyable series, Sharpe and his trusted Sergeant Harper lead their group of ""Chosen men"" through one difficult scrape after the other. I love the entire Sharpe series but this first batch of four videos has some truly unforgettable moments. In the tradition of ""Zulu"" and ""Gunga Din"", if you love tales of the tenacious English soldier, testosterone and Napoleon, Sharpe is your man.",1005609600,7,990,4.898809523809524
7845808,5,6303421334,"Four esisodes first shown in the US on Masterpiece Theater.  A gritty tale of Sgt. Richard Sharpe and his rise from the ranks to the title of officer.  It is a fine adaption and actually more watchable then Mr. Cornwells books are readable.  It is dirty gritty and that dirt and grit makes it real.  You also fine performances from Bean and O'Malley (and particualrly Pete Postlethwaite as his arch foe in episodes 3 & 4).  Our first glimpse of Ducos is also a winner.  (you may notice much of the same crowd with DiNero in RONIN.)  A definate winner!
If there is anything to complain about in episode (Sharpe's Eagle) the scene leading to the fist fight between Sharpe and Berry is cut.  It makes me wonder if we are missing anything else.  Beyond that great!",998524800,3,760,4.489051094890511
7845809,5,6303421334,"WONDERFUL!!  The videos are as spellbinding as the novels!  I can't take my eyes off Sean Bean - his Richard Sharpe is the kind of swashbuckling hero every woman dreams of! The rest of the series looks good, too - it draws the viewer into the nineteenth century and into the dirt, the frustration, the fear and the triumph of the common soldiers fighting for England against Napoleon.  As a fan of anything hisorical, I enjoy a show that can allow me to feel like I got a priveleged, first hand peek into another time and place and this series does just that. If you are a fan of history, adventure, or great looking hunks,give this series a good, hard look and you won't be dissapointed!",985219200,8,688,4.444444444444445
7845810,5,6303421334,"i have read all the sharpe books and seen 7 sharpe episodes: rifles eagle company enemy regiment siege mission
all are great!  i particularly like the bit in... rifles - where sharpe drinks harper's brandy eagle - when the  chosen men do quicktime and annoy simmerson company - when windham tells  sharpe about his wife and sharpie looks confused enemy - when sharpe and  the chosen men meet sweet william and his men regiment - when havercamp  gets left behind siege - when sharpe tells catherine he'd rather have the  gold mission - when sharpe knocks brand down the well",954288000,,573,4.68
7845811,4,6303421334,"This series is a must have for anyone who is a fan of the Bernard Cornwell series.  Well acted and filled with lots of actions these movies will not disappoint.  The only complaint is that they needed more extras.  At times  both armies seem a little short of manpower, but that is a minor flaw in an  otherwise stellar production.",952300800,4,331,4.45
7845812,5,6303421334,"Ever since I saw Sharpe's Eagle on Carlton TV's first showing of the Sharpe series (they were still making it too) in England, I was captivated so much that I couldn't wait a year for the next ones.  Well, I did...  and  now I keep enjoying the whole series of 11 and the novels (which are even  better that the films if that's possible) written by Cornwell.  Richard  Sharpe is brilliantly portrayed by Sean Bean, so well, in fact, that  Bernard Cornwell changed the character in the later books to reflect the  film performance.  If anyone reading this has influence with Bernard or  Carlton TV, PLEASE WRITE (or film) MORE of these.  I can't get enough.  The  action is rivetting, the women beautiful and the music snaps you right into  the action.  The best film series ever made on a shoe-string...  and the  bugdet does not reflect!",949881600,27,838,4.591836734693878
7845813,5,6303421334,"I have viewed the complete series and after 20 plus hours I find the only bad thing about it is that it ended.  Unlike so many movies and series where the sequel deminishes in quality, Sharpe retains it high  entertainment ratio.  I believe that it is due to the original author  Bernard Cornwell.  I have read his eleven books and the eleventh is as  enthralling as the first.  This is a story that gives you history and  entertainment together in a beautiful story.  Well worth the money and I am  sure that I will veiw my tapes over and over in the future.  Sudami",948931200,7,567,4.355769230769231
