8003523,5,B0000V8HYK,"I have quite a few of Bill's DVDs and this is one of the first that I purchased.  In this disc, Bill explains the fantastic business model of creating and marketing how-to and special interest DVDs.

Note that I say ""business"" model, not ""money making scheme"", so if you're looking for a get rich quick type of product, this isn't for you.  But if you'd like a practical guide to a potentially profitable business model, Bill explains all of that and more in this DVD.

I learned some great tips in this DVD and used that info (plus info from his other titles) to create my own DVDs.  Be sure to check out his Youtube videos to get a feel for what this DVD is like and stop by the companion website too...more great ways to expand on what you'll learn in this DVD.",1214179200,,764,4.277777777777778
8003524,4,B0000V8HYK,"This video (on DVD) is very professional and informative. There are one or two areas (marketing and sets come to mind) that I would like to have seen expanded, but this is a good starting point.

Pros:
Well done
Easy to follow
Very informative
Hints on how to save money during production

Cons:
Some areas a little light (see above)

I would highly recommend this DVD and look forward to future volumes.

This DVD came out within two weeks (!) of my shooting a How To DVD. The timing was phenomenal for me. The information on it proved to be extremely valuable and helped out quite a bit.
Bill is the real deal. He has done 60+ How to videos on his own and he knows intimately of what he is telling you.
Fantastic job!",1070323200,2,401,4.0886075949367084

8003528,5,B0000V8HYK,"I didn't have a clue about shooting, editing and producing a video before I watched Bill Myers ""Producing How-To DVDs for Profit"". I have now successfully completed and delivered my first video for a local company here in Colorado. Bill Myers gives you the overview and the details you need to get that first video out the door. The best news is Bill is coming out with more advanced videos and you definitely want to be on his mailing list. I'm a big fan and I don't say that about many people at all.",1069804800,,502,4.351063829787234

I AM biased. Using Bill Myers advice, I have personally been able to produce special niche videos and DVD's and made thousands doing so.
Best of all, he shows you how to do it relatively cheaply too!
If you are interested in producing dvd's, this dvd is your one-stop-shop. If you are in the business, I'd still highly recommend it, as you will learn easy shortcuts and techniques from a real wizard.",1069286400,,607,4.577981651376147
