7976159,5,B00007G1W8,"This anime isn't much different than some of the other space/harem/comedy stories out there. It's very similar to shows like Nadesico or Dragonaut. The thing that makes this anime good like the others I mentioned is the multitude of cool characters it has. There are plenty of neat characters that are fun and that keep the story interesting. The story line is pretty cool. There are 3 men stuck on a ship of women. In their world women and men live separately and do not interact. This makes for a lot of funny and awkward situations. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting isn't bad either. Vandread isn't exactly an original masterpiece, but it's pretty entertaining and lots of fun. If you're looking for an amazing and original story, then look elsewhere. If you just wanna laugh and have fun then Vandread is a good place to start.",1355184000,,848,4.66
7976160,5,B00007G1W8,"Vandread really knows how to tell an interesting story, and it is quite sad that few anime do this as successfully as this anymore. Yes there are filler episodes and yes it can seem childish as times but to be honest it does hold its own even in todays standards because we still have not gotten over the hump of what would happen if the battle of the sexes became an all out war.",1250899200,,380,4.148648648648648
7976161,5,B00007G1W8,"I won't reveal any of the stuff that happens (even though I'm a bit late now).  This is one of the best disks in the series, if not THE best.  There are many revelations (hence the name of the disk).  There is a lot of character development all across the board, particularly with Hibiki and the Paksis.  There's still plenty of the same humor, the same action, the same everything.... only it moves VERY fast.  They're really setting this series up for one heck of a finale.  Any Vandread fan, or any anime fan for that matter, will definately get their money's worth out of this disk.  This otaku has spoken.",1043712000,,610,4.441441441441442
7976162,4,B00007G1W8,"This is the third disc of the second season and Id, have to say so far it's the best one from season two. The first episode is about the crew trying to throw a suprise party for Meia (witch she despratly trys to avoid). However there plans are disrupted when the enemy attacks (betchya didn't se that one come ?=). Episode two reviels the trueth about Hibiki's past and also shows him discovering the proof of his exsistens after he is stranded on a planet inhabited by people posesing telapathic abuility's who ,to me, seem like the decendents of Native Americans. and the third and final episode on the disc shows the Nirvana and its crew finaly making it back to the home worlds only to be confronted by a defensive mined field and fleets from  both there home worlds. On top of all that thay are horrified to find out that.. well.. i cant tell you about the end Idon't want to ruine it for you but trust me I was totally shocked when i saw the ending. The creators realy leave you hanging and counting the days till the next disc comes out. All in all I'd have to say this is a must have for anyone who's been keeping tabs on the story thus far.",1043712000,2,1149,4.270642201834862
7976163,5,B00007G1W8,"The mystery of Hibiki's origin finally gets unveiled.  He is the reincaration of Ryoga Hibiki.  Just kidding.  He actually was one of the first immegriants (He was in stasis kinda like Misty).
Plus BC's secert is revield.  She aint a she.  He was a spy with a 'Faked Mask'.",1043280000,,273,4.489795918367347
