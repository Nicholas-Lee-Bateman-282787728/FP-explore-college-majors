2478162,4,B000E0OBEC,"I used to watch R&T on PBS and looked forward to the Saturday night broadcast. I've watched all of series 1 episodes and really enjoyed them, so I bought series 2 to watch on my own time. The first 2 episodes on disc 1 were good, but the other 2 disc episodes' storylines were silly and predictable. On the other hand, I still really enjoy watching the whole series because of the two leading ladies. The supporting characters  are enjoyable (some of their acting leaves more to be desired though) and the beautiful scenery is a nice escape. Now I understand that these murder mysteries are not meant to be the best, but they could have been alot more believable. I would have rated this item with 3 stars if the first 2 episodes were not included. I'm not a hundred percent sure, but from what I remember the first series was much better. I'm looking forward to the last series of this program, but I hope that the stories are much better. I've noticed that nobody has listed the names of the episodes on this series 2 so I will. Disc 1: The Memory of Water(2 part episode);Orpheus in the Underground Disc 2:They Understand Me In Paris;The Invisible Worm;The Gongoozlers Disc 3:The Italian Rapscallion;Swords Into Plowshares;Up the Garden Path",1163808000,5,1244,4.654545454545454
2478163,3,B000E0OBEC,I was disappointed in the series I bought and we have not bothered to view all of series. It relies heavily on perky females. Its tone is somewhat condescending. The stories are missing the spark and intelligence I associate with British mysteries.,1163116800,4,248,4.928571428571429
2478164,5,B000E0OBEC,"this is a wonderful, entertaining series and i just hope they will make more!",1163030400,4,77,4.571428571428571
2478165,5,B000E0OBEC,"This is one of the most entertaining series I have evr watched. you not only get to view some beautiful gardens, but interesting mysteries as well.",1162512000,,147,4.6923076923076925
2478166,5,B000E0OBEC,I love this show and can't wait until Series 3 this fall. British murder mystery without the edge. Quite good,1152576000,7,109,4.5
2478167,5,B000E0OBEC,"It is nice to see some non-extremely-stretched-mature-women staring in a mystery series.  Felicity Kendal, (as Rosemary Boxer) and Pam Ferris (as Laura Thyme) are wonderful as professional gardeners and would-be detectives in the Rosemary & Thyme series.  The aforesaid characters are savvy, knowledgeable and extremely humorous.  Season two continues the premise of season one--two mature female horticulturalist solving gardening  problems in beautiful English Gardens where murder mysteries seem to somehow be among the fauna which our two mature amateur detectives, Rosemary Boxer and Laura Thyme always solve splendidly.

I found ""The Mysteries"" in Season Two to be far more intriguing than the ones in Season One--the first two part episode is a fine example (just complicated enough to keep one alert but not too complicated that it was sleep inducing) .  Although the Season two scripts, to me, are far superior to Season One, the two lead characters (Rosemary and Thyme) are still very much the same offering much wisdom, insight and humor.  In addition, the English Gardens (there are peeks at gardens in other countries too such as France and Italy) featured are still very gorgeous--what a pleasure it is to see them! I really enjoyed this season and I DO plan to purchase any future releases.",1149638400,26,1305,5.2451923076923075
2478168,5,B000E0OBEC,i love this series and am counting the months until series 3 is out on dvd. the locations are breathtaking and rosemary and laura are a delight. i hope this series runs for a long time.very classy.,1143072000,10,197,4.351351351351352
2478169,5,B000E0OBEC,I love this show.  The settings in this set are even more beautiful than the last set.  I can't wait for set 3!,1142985600,9,111,3.782608695652174
2478170,5,B000E0OBEC,"I just adore this show!  I find the stories smart & clever, and the two main characters, Rosemary & Thyme, extremely entertaining, and likeable.  It is nice to sit back and watch a murder mystery without all the obvious gore that can come with it.

I must also mention, the background scenery is fantastic!  I feel as if the backdrops are as much a steady character in the show as are Rosemary & Thyme. With this I am learning a thing or two about horticulture which in turn is  making me want to jump into gardening with my Sherlock Holmes hat & pipe!

I look forward to Season 3 AND I am in hopes that this will continue for quite some time.  I am a youngster...(35 years old)....so it's not just for those over 50!  If you enjoy good murder mysteries with a dash of clever fun, then this is a must for your collection!",1142640000,15,821,4.251612903225807
2478171,5,B000E0OBEC,"Watch Rosemary and Thyme for a while and it's hard to refrain from garden metaphors about murder.  Public television did a wise thing when they arranged for the viewing of these gals (in our area on Saturday evening).  At long last, I feel for the first time in a while, that I am getting my money's worth by donating to my local stations when they have their pledge drive.  As a retiree, I watch the Afternoon Tea series on Maryland Public television (British humor) while I clean bird cages, but in the evenings, at least once or twice a week, I like to watch British murder mysteries, (and not the gross products showing up on the BBC channel) which I can get on my local WETA and MPT stations.

Series Two of the DVD episodes includes the recent crop of R&T shows, so if you live out in the hinterland where your local public television or cable doesn't connect you with public television, you can now own your own set of films on DVD.  Rosemary Boxer is played by Felicity Kendal, she of `Good Neighbors' fame, and Mrs Laura Thyme is played by Pam Ferris from the Darling Buds of May. Rosemary and Laura formed a gardening partnership after Rosemary lost her job teaching botany in a local university and Laura's DCI husband ran off with a younger woman. The two ""gardeners"" fell into sleuthing when bodies began appearing at the various sites they were contracted to work.

Series II includes three volumes (each DVD total time = 141 minutes) with several episodes on each for a grand total of eight episodes (one is a two part story). The stories are relatively new, having been shot in 2004 and go as follows:

1/ The Memory of Water (two part episode) - Rosemary and Laura are hired by barrister Martin Frazer to restore a walled garden of his father's museum.  Frazer has access to cheap labor from a nearby prison but after the workers arrive, events take a deadly turn when a man is seen jumping into a nearby river.

2/ Orpheus underground - Laura hopes to heal a rift with her grown daughter Helena when she is invited to construct a memorial garden near Helena's home in London's Notting Hill.  Soon a body is found in the garden.

3/ They Understand Me in Paris - Rosemary's old friend has invited the gardeners to her house in southern France to restore the 150-year old garden.  Some one appears anxious to stop the project and soon bodies appear (Mel Martin plays the old friend).

4/ The Invisible Worm - When R&T go to Stagford Lodge Prep School to investigate dying roses they soon find themselves involved in a strange school ritual involving a stag.

5/ The Gongoozlers - R&T get a taste of the cutthroat world of reality tv when they agree to act as consultants to the host of a garden show.  Belinda Lang (Agatha Troy) plays Quinnie Dorrell, the host of the show.

6/ The Italian Rapscallion - Working on the Ligurian coast of Italy, R&T are under pressure to finish a restaurant garden for a new establishment of a friend. As a perk, they visit the nearby  Giardini Tremont garden where a body appears.  Laura's affection for cats provides a vital clue.

7/ Swords into Plowshares - Why is archeologist Gemma Jackson posing as Rosemary to gain access to Engleton Park?

8/ Up the Garden Path - The picturesque village of Rowfield is a hotbed of turmoil and dissent as the annual garden show approaches.  Soon a leading contender is found dead.

This series can best be described as ""older chick flick.""  PBS has finally discovered it's demographic market segment.",1137715200,105,3490,4.584541062801932
2478192,4,B000E0OBEC,"Just al lot of fun, well except for all the poor characters who keep dropping like flies, but, in a murder mystery, that's more or less to be expected. Pam Ferris and Felicity Kendal (who, earlier in her career, was cast as ""the cute girl"", and who is still cute) are both charming and believeable. Definitely worth watching.",1486166400,,325,4.620689655172414

Good to see ladies as star of movie not looking like models but just everyday women I can identify. Will probably watch more episodes in between other movies.,1378252800,,284,4.7

2478422,5,B000E0OBEC,"I really enjoy British TV mysteries, and this one is a fine example.  The characters are real people that I would enjoy knowing.  The mysteries are complex enough to keep you guessing, but not too tangled to follow.",1377648000,,215,4.631578947368421
2478423,3,B000E0OBEC,"Rosemary and Tyme is beautiful to see. If you love plants and flowers, the gardens and floral arrangements in this series will take your breath away.

2478447,5,B000E0OBEC,"It is what American TV should be, excellent actors, great scripts, and a point to make that is not political. This and Doc Martin ARE the best shows outside of Doctor Who.  We can learn from the brits.",1374883200,,201,4.2894736842105265
2478448,4,B000E0OBEC,"I enjoyed Rosemary & Thyme, the show was entertaining, the characters were played by people more my age and easier to relate to them.  I love anything BBC, hope there is more of this show to come.",1374710400,,196,4.297297297297297

2478461,5,B000E0OBEC,"After many series full of dark, disturbing 'reality'... this one will make you smile. Everything about this series, the acting, the witty scripts, the beautiful locales, the characters with their unique stories makes a smooth, clean mystery  that you will not have to keep the children out while watching. Loved it.",1374364800,,315,5.176470588235294
2478462,5,B000E0OBEC,Enjoyable series. Wonderful acting. Beautiful scenery. Dialogue believable. Great lead actresses. Too bad the series ended.  Would have liked to see more.,1373932800,,154,6.0
2478463,5,B000E0OBEC,It's fun and can take you to beautiful places.  My mom really didn't see action like these ladies in all her years as a gardener. ha ha,1373846400,,135,4.0
2478464,5,B000E0OBEC,There really isn't anything about this series that I DON'T like.  Only wish there were more that I haven't seen!,1373760000,,112,4.6

2478468,5,B000E0OBEC,Love this show. Although plot is usually predictable it is a good series with good actresses. Rated PG so pretty mainstream for family viewing.,1373155200,,143,5.0
2478469,5,B000E0OBEC,"I wish I had a lot of time to write a review but I don't.  I will say this, I am a CSI and crime movie junkie. What I like about this series is that it is a low key murder mystery, made with lots of wit and humor, so I can relax and watch this knowing I can fall asleep without being woken up to screaming or have nightmares.",1373068800,,325,3.642857142857143
2478480,5,B000E0OBEC,"This show is wonderful, the gardens are fantastic and the story is exciting with murder under every bush!

2478482,5,B000E0OBEC,"I thoroughly enjoy this series. Of course, nobody finds a dead body every time they go out on a job, but it is TV after all. The relationship between the characters presents interesting byplay, and the characters remain true to themselves in their interactions with the folks they meet in their adventures. I have to laugh at the Land Rover - what a clunker/great old vehicle! Although nobody puts together a garden quite as quickly as these two seem to, it's fun to watch and the results shown are always beautiful. Settle back with a glass of wine and enjoy the show.",1372636800,,569,4.588235294117647
2478483,5,B000E0OBEC,Terrific British mystery that takes a lighter approach to murder & mayhem! Main characters have a great chemistry between them.,1372550400,,127,5.4
2478484,5,B000E0OBEC,I just love these gals!  I'm a huge Anglophile and this is just great!  They are such fun!  They are great mystery's without it being gory.  The scenery is absolutely amazing!  I highly recomment it!,1372204800,,199,4.571428571428571
2478485,5,B000E0OBEC,I had never seen this series on PBS  and wanted to see it.  I saw all 3 seasons on my kindle and throughly enjoyed them.  The interactions between Rosemary and Laura are so much fun to watch.  Laura reminds me of myself in her  problems with her ex-husband.  I was also dumped for a younger woman after 27 years of marriage. They make quite a pair and wish the series could have run longer.,1372032000,,390,4.202702702702703
2478486,5,B000E0OBEC,"I love the scenery, the plots & the characters.  The variation of scenes and plots leaves one wondering what beautiful mansion or resort will be experiencing next.",1371945600,,163,5.037037037037037
2478487,5,B000E0OBEC,Rosemary and Thyme is yet another fabulous series from BBC. I'm so glad I found it and have so enjoyed watching these two English garden experts unravel a murder. It's a little like Murder She wrote and Cagney and Lacey fix up the garden . Loved the Episode  in which they were restoring a 14th century walled garden with the assistance of prisoners on work furlough.,1371686400,,367,4.5606060606060606
2478488,5,B000E0OBEC,"This is a delightful show!  It's a wonderful murder mystery show that's not too graphic, and yet has all the suspense, suspects and elements of a good whodunit.  And you can learn how to solve murders and create a beautiful garden at the same time!",1371340800,,248,4.488888888888889
2478489,5,B000E0OBEC,"thought the show was very entertaining.  I really enjoyed the 2 ladies.  They were well paired and very down-to-earth.  Great show, wish there were more.  I have recommend the show to several of my fellow mystery buffs.",1370995200,,219,4.837837837837838
2478500,5,B000E0OBEC,"I'm loving every minute of Rosemary & Thyme.  Beautiful scenery, flowers, countrysides of England, mansions, along with mysterious plots--fantastic acting by all.  I'm now on the 3rd series; and I'm afraid it ends there.  I'm lingering on this one, replaying portions because I don't want it to end.  So, please bring them back!",1370649600,,328,5.132075471698113
2478501,5,B000E0OBEC,"This show was a pleasant surprise. Watching it was a joy. Love the premise and the fact it is not a procedural, just good story. Wonderful way to relax at the end of a day.",1370649600,,172,3.942857142857143
2478502,5,B000E0OBEC,If you enjoy Murder She Wrote you may like this.  Gardeners/Landscape artists working on murder.  Not overly gross or explicit.,1370563200,,127,5.3
2478503,5,B000E0OBEC,"Well made as often British series are, this is another detective series that incorporates wonderful sceneries and backdrops that just makes watching these episodes a relaxing experience.",1369872000,,186,5.925925925925926
2478504,5,B000E0OBEC,"I love this British mystery and would like to see more like this one. The ladies are so funny, but good at what they do.",1369440000,,120,3.84
2478505,5,B000E0OBEC,A little mystery and a lot of lovely gardens to look at and view.  I love their humor and their great conversations regarding plants.,1369267200,,133,4.541666666666667
2478506,4,B000E0OBEC,"The only downside of Rosemary and Thyme is that I've only been able to find three seasons of the show. I really enjoy the horticultural aspects, as well as the beautiful settings. The cozy mystery feel of the show is lovely for those times when you'd enjoy a bit of suspense without the gore featured in so many shows.",1368489600,,318,4.406779661016949
2478507,5,B000E0OBEC,"I love this series.  I had never seen this before and simply looking for things involving Felicity Kendal after loving her on ""The Good Life"" series for BBC.  I absolutely loved every show and hope to be able to watch again to see if I missed anything.",1368489600,,252,4.340425531914893
2478508,5,B000E0OBEC,I just love this series and wish they had made more. The music is especially lovely. I also wish that Jon Williams' version was available from Amazon in the U.S.,1368489600,,161,4.4
2478509,4,B000E0OBEC,"Good mystery, genuinely pleasant diversion.  Always a happy ending.  Without the BritComs, what would we do for entertainment?
(Read books.)",1368230400,,140,5.95
2478520,4,B000E0OBEC,"This could be considered the TV version of the  ""cozy mystery"" that you hear so much of in book reviews. There isn't much in the way of blood and gore, but there's plenty of suspense; not just about how the mystery will be solved, but also how different situations in the lives of the main characters will be resolved. I also love that it revolves around horticulture. You always know there's going to be a beautiful background.",1367971200,,428,4.558441558441558
2478521,4,B000E0OBEC,I recommend these shows.  The acting is really good and the scenery was really beautiful.  I truly enjoyed them.  Give them a try.,1367712000,,130,4.565217391304348
2478522,5,B000E0OBEC,Great show. Very entertaining. It is a modern day Ms. Marple. If you like Agatha Christie's works you will love Rosemary and Thyme.,1367712000,,131,4.739130434782608
2478523,5,B000E0OBEC,"I love this show, beginning to end. I  only wish there were more than  3 seasons available. Sort of Murder She Wrote but the scenery is just lovely.",1367625600,,148,4.25
2478524,5,B000E0OBEC,"This is a fun mystery series.  Not only do we get to see lots of English (and a few Mediterranean) gardens, but the mysteries will give the viewer pause.  Both Felicity Kendal and Pam Feris are so down to earth and watchable.
If you enjoy British mystery series that are a bit less procedural, these three are for you.",1367107200,,318,4.372881355932203
2478525,5,B000E0OBEC,"If you like pretty gardens and wonderful indoor floral decorating -- along with a touch of murder mystery -- then these are just down your alley. The only problem not addressed in the entire series is why anyone would hire them; it's not that their landscape and gardening skills aren't up to par. No, it's just that every time they show up on a job site, someone dies. Bummer for clients and their friends and relatives, don't you know?",1366761600,,437,4.544303797468355
2478526,5,B000E0OBEC,"I love following these spunky ladies.  Great for kicking back.  A little off the wall.
I would like to see a season 4.",1366761600,,118,4.086956521739131
2478527,5,B000E0OBEC,"This is a good series to watch just to relax after watching gore and mayhem on other ""crime"" shows. Love both characters and their friendship. Also I learn a little about gardening!",1365638400,,181,4.6875
2478528,5,B000E0OBEC,"I love this series.  The stories are well written and the actresses are wonderful. An added benefit is that they are not too long, so it is possible to watch even when you are short on time. I also liked there is no continuations except about their personal lives develope.  Each story is self contained.",1365379200,,304,4.509090909090909
2478529,5,B000E0OBEC,Beautiful settings. Likeable stars.  i enjoy this calm series.  The murders are much more civilized than some and i'm learning about flowers.,1365206400,,141,5.363636363636363
2478530,3,B000E0OBEC,"When I came across the title and read the synopsis I thought it sounded great, but I'm a bit disappointed in the actual shows.  I watch one every now and then just to turn my mind off.

I love to listen to their accents, and the garden scenery is beautiful.  The plots are just too predictable though.",1365033600,,301,4.245614035087719

2478532,5,B000E0OBEC,"More of the same in Series 2:  Good stories and lovable characters.  It is a strange mix to begin with--gardening and detective work.
But, it's really quite enjoyable and you can't wait to see the next episode.  Felicity Kendal and Pam Ferris are well suited to each
other and there is good chemistry between them.  Again, it is like visiting with friends when you watch their adventures.  They are murder mysteries for sure, but they are not gruesome in content nor is there gratuitous violence.  If you like a good murder to solve
without much horror, then this is for you!  I enjoy them a lot and highly recommend them to anyone!",1364860800,,632,4.589285714285714
2478533,1,B000E0OBEC,"The delivery time and quality was excellent. However I thought I bought the year 2006, but  they contained only 8 duplicate stories that were in the 2001 series I bought ;listed up above.
Can't understand that because there was a separation of years. The art work was different, but not the stories.
I'll have to see the titles in a set before I buy anymore of theirs.  We really like the series and was looking for more to purchase.
This one I'll give away as a gift",1363910400,,467,4.35632183908046

2478537,5,B000E0OBEC,"Rosemary & Thyme offers plot twists, ""seemingly normal"" characters, and suspense rather than a lot of guns and gore. The series tends to focus on the relationship of all those involved and piecing together the puzzle to find the murderer. And I also like the chemistry between the two main characters",1363046400,,300,4.901960784313726
2478538,5,B000E0OBEC,"This most unlikely pair of middle-aged women find themselves in equally unlikely circumstances where their garden landscaping projects often turn over murders and crazy plots.

2478552,5,B000E0OBEC,"Although, I must admit that the storylines are somewhat similiar in all episodes (a lot like the Murder She Wrote type plotlines), the banter and ""side comments"" by and between the two leading ladies makes me laugh out loud sometimes!  Very entertaining and you may actually learn some gardening techniques along the way!",1361836800,,321,5.056603773584905

2478556,5,B000E0OBEC,"I had thought that I'd quickly tire of this series, but found myself looking forward to each new episode on Prime! My favorite was Swords into Plowshares, when Laura first discovers her husband is planning to remarry (and is still married to her), then hears the announcement of Rosemary's murder on television.

I hadn't really thought I liked them as a couple that much until this one opened, and I sat along with Laura grieving.

Each episode is new and fresh, and IMHO well worth watching.",1359072000,,493,4.72093023255814

2478570,3,B000E0OBEC,"Rosemary & Thyme though endearing in their own way fall short on the mysteries associated with their appearances as hired help garden planners/restorers.

The plots are a bit silly, why does everyone wait till the gardeners show up before there is a murder?  My advice is don't hire these two or else you may perish.

If you like mindless plots with too many characters in each episode to keep track of who is who but enjoy the beautiful scenery of the locations, then this is for you.

I enjoyed it, even though I couldn't figure out why there were so many actors with very little to do.  Also another oddity was when they were in France or Italy all they seemed to encounter were British folks and the only French and Italians were the maids and the police.  Not very realistic, but simple, mindless entertainment.

I did enjoy the beautiful gardens in most of the episodes.",1340496000,,876,4.576923076923077

2478573,4,B000E0OBEC,"""Rosemary and Thyme"" is what I like to call a modern cozy -- it's set in the current day, but has lots of quaint English villages, overgrown gardens and not-too-gory murders. And the complete second season is a thoroughly entertaining little mystery series, especially since Felicity Kendal and Pam Ferris are brilliant as gardeners-cum-detectives.

The two-part ""The Memory of Water"" sees Rosemary (Kendal) and Laura (Ferris) being hired by a prominent barrister to restore an Elizabethan garden on his property. A day after arriving, Rosemary sees his cousin commit suicide by leaping into a dangerous river.... and then later she sees him strolling through the village market. Dirty secrets, mistaken identity and sordid affairs have to be unearthed.

In ""Orpheus in the Undergrowth,"" their latest job is disrupted by vandalism and a suspicious death, even as Laura tries to reconnect with her estranged daughter Helena. ""They Understand Me in Paris"" when they go to France to help Rosemary's pal Dorothy with a vast formal garden... only to find Dorothy's hubby bludgeoned to death, and a valuable piece of silver missing. And ""The Invisible Worm"" turns when they are called on to save a dying rose garden at a posh prep school... and find a teacher harpooned through the heart.

""The Gongoozlers"" hurls Rosemary and Laura into the world of reality TV -- only for Rosemary to take  a near-fatal tumble off a platform, just as a dead body turns up in the nearby pool. So Laura teams up with brusque TV host Quinnie Dorell to find the murderer. ""The Italian Rapscallion"" has the girls going to the Mediterranean to help a friend open a restaurant, and stumbling across a hotbed of sexual scandal, criminal secrets and dead bodies.

""Swords into Ploughshares"" shocks Laura with the news that Rosemary was murdered while working at the bankrupt Engleton Park... only to find that Rosemary is alive and well, and someone was using her name to investigate an archaeological dig. Finally, ""Up the Garden Path"" plops the ladies in the middle of a gardening feud, which turns out to be rooted in revenge and hatred.

""Rosemary and Thyme"" is one of those little, low-key British series that you can just kick back and enjoy without any stress. There's lots of gardening tips (who knew that about roses?), lush flowers and foliage, and sunlit English villages with pretty little cottages... and oh yeah, there's at least one corpse in whatever place they visit. Sometimes two.

The writers do an excellent job with mellow, amusing dialogue (""It's hard to sleep easy when you have been burnt out of hearth and home."" ""It's a TENT!""). And they insert plenty of clever plot twists, red herrings, and mystery plots that are just complex enough. And the best part is Kendal and Ferris -- they have the warm chemistry of old friends, and are depicted as dynamic attractive women (which you don't often see for fiftysomething actresses).

""Rosemary and Thyme - Complete Series 2"" is a nice light collection of murder mysteries, along with plenty of flowers, gardening, and the occasional family squabble.",1278547200,,3090,4.9864077669902915
2478574,4,B000E0OBEC,"I like this series of mysteries; not so much for their ability to confound, which they don't, as for the delightful characters, their very humanness, the lovely scenery both in England and France, and the fact that there is a more realistic mix of age groups and social standings than there is on US television.  Here, as in other segments of the series, the two sleuths are brought into the mystery by accident while working as landscape gardeners.  In all the murders, they solve the crime by the process of deduction and the elimination of suspects,  la Sherlock Holmes.  As in the classic age of murder mysteries, the gory details of the crime are less the focus of the investigation than are the personal characters of the victim and the suspects.  While the interest and focus of modern murder mysteries these days is the high tech forensics applied to the solution of the crime, and therefore also to the gruesomeness of the death of the victim, Rosemary and Thyme are designed more like an Agatha Christie work, the plot woven around motive and opportunity and who had them.

My particular favorites were the Gongoozlers, because the escape of the criminals was prevented by a novel means.  Here though, as with most of them, the bad guys are not quite so ruthless or dangerous as real people might have been.  As with the Mrs. Wainthorpe series, a lot of leeway has been allowed so a gentler type of sleuth is possible.  The audience members inured to the far more blood thirsty and vicious characters of most TV series may find this a little tame and unbelievable.  The stories are not our version of ""bread and circuses.""  These are enjoyable ""old fashioned"" murders!",1277596800,,1678,4.731958762886598

Both of the lead actresses are their perfect for the character parts. They are believable, mature women, the kind that could live next door. Not the hard as brass tacks, every hair in place, Hollywood female leads preferred by so many other mystery/drama series. The series is well done, keeps your attention without all the in your face gore of so many other mystery series. This series has action, suspense, and drama while at the same time keeping it light, fun, charming and believable. I only wish they had made more episodes. The fact that the characters are both gardeners is the cherry on top.",1255305600,,720,4.538461538461538
2478577,5,B000E0OBEC,"My wife and I have enjoyed British television programming, primarily on Public Television.  Now we are purchasing many of these programs such as Rosemary & Thyme, Morse, Sherlock Holmes, Midsomer Murders, Rumpole Of The Baily, Lovejoy, etc. so that we can watch them at our convenience.  Many of these are entertainment at its best.  I would recommend the purchase of this set of Rosemary & Thyme to anyone interested in murder-mystery type programs.",1247356800,,450,5.136986301369863
2478578,3,B000E0OBEC,"While I admit that I am a fan of the stylish violence that characterizes a lot of British police procedurals, I found enough to interest me in these cozy style television shows set in England and Europe.  Part of the charm is the scenery as the stories move from grand English gardens to private metropolitan parks, to France and Italy.

While the two title characters are low key they do have beautiful diction.  Really, hearing Pam Ferris say ""insouciant"" is pure pleasure. And if the mysteries are a bit lacking in complexity, they are also without gratuitous violence and horror.  The usual show involves Rosemary Boxer and Laura Thyme becoming engaged in a gardening project.  A cast of characters, many of them unpleasant, is introduced.  There is some low key sexual shenanigans going on between some of the characters.  A murder occurs.  Rosemary and Laura start to detect.  The clue that leads to the solution frequently requires some knowledge of gardening.

Two women, each have a Life changing experience just before the series starts. Soon they become friends. One a hands on gardener, with a law enforcement back ground Laura Thyme, (Pam Ferris), the other an academic horticulturist with an old four wheeler vehicle Rosemary Boxer (Felicity Kendal).

The programs are of the two trying to find out who dunnit and how. We do not get bogged down in love interests.

Each episode is unique in its approach. The only pattern I see is that it is like in the movie ""A shot in the dark"" where everyone is guilty except the maid. In this series there may not be a lit of murderers, however there are a lot of guilty people.
