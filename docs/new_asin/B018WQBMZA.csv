7559230,3,B018WQBMZA,"I watched Species II for the first time recently and I thought it was a fun watch. The first two Species movies have been enjoyable viewing for me the sci-fi, 'Alien' themes, the gore, special effects, everything played straight, Natasha Henstridge, Michael Madsen and American Horror Story's James Cromwell.

 Not sure why this got bad reviews and was a box office flop I've seen a lot worse sci-fi/horror movies.",1463702400,,414,4.9855072463768115
7559231,4,B018WQBMZA,"it's finally on blu ray. And well the other two are too on one blu ray.  I have long had the whole set and a boxset would have been nice. Still ,  I saw this at the theater and it was a worthy sequel to the first one.  In this one sil fights a infected astronaut.  So she's the good girl here  The first one was of course better and it did quite well.  This sequel did well enough but it was the end of the big budget films in the series.  The next two were made to dvd basically.  This blu ray looks very good and it's better than the dvd in quality by far. It's about time this one came out on blu it only took 18 years! But it's finally here.  And if  you enjoyed the first movie then this one will do quite nicely , the lead actress had real appeal and wasn't just a good body as well. She makes a short cameo in the next one.  which is on a blu with species four.  This one is a far better movie than the next two and it was decent performer at the theaters in 98 as well.",1457740800,,977,3.7586206896551726
7559232,2,B018WQBMZA,"""Species"" was about two things: boobs and blood. Really,it was all an opportunity to have Natasha Henstridge naked and killing people.

But while the original ""Species"" was cheesy fun for most of its running time, ""Species II"" induces more headslapping confusion than a Stephenie Meyer interview. While Natasha Henstridge is still good as a second alien hybrid (yes, they made a clone), the story is confusing and ridiculous, with a climax that is made completely absurd by a giant marionette who wants to impregnate human females.

About two years after ""Species,"" Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger) has created a more docile duplicate of Sil, who is named Eve (Natasha Henstridge). To make sure she doesn't go on a homicidal babymaking spree, she's been completely isolated from men. Around the same time, the first manned mission to Mars returns to Earth. All three astronauts are now feted celebrities, especially Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard), who is the wealthy, handsome son of a senator. And like any good future politician, he is mainly focused on bedding gorgeous women... until those women start having two-minute-long, belly-exploding pregnancies.

As more women are found dead, Laura and Press Lennox (Michael Madsen) must use Eve's psychic link to Patrick to find him. Unfortunately, the two alien hybrids are compelled to find one another and mate, in order to create new alien kids. Laura and Press must join forces with Patrick's fellow astronaut Dennis (Mykelti Williamson) -- whose blood holds the key to killing the aliens -- to stop Patrick before he and his dozens of alien kids can overwhelm humanity.

Yes, ""Species II"" has basically the same plot as ""Species"" -- an alien hybrid runs around having lots of sex in order to procreate -- but the story has been genderflipped so the homicidal babymaking alien is MALE. So instead of producing ONE creepy little kid, he can produce dozens. Yeah, there's really not much to the story beyond trying to find Patrick, and making sure he and Eve don't produce even MORE creepy little alien kids.

And honestly, the premise isn't bad on its own, but the actual movie IS. Painfully. It's pretty obvious that the writers didn't actually care about actually creating a semi-logical movie. Most of it involves Patrick killing/sexing women, including a grotesque scene where he drags a screaming woman out of a supermarket so he can rape her... and then gets distracted, meaning that the disturbing scene was entirely pointless. The rest of the movie mostly involves the corpses of his former partners being found, while Eve gets all hot and bothered by his mere existence.

And there are some moments that just make you slap your head. For instance, we're told that Eve -- who has spent her ENTIRE LIFE in a lab -- instantly knows how to drive a jeep because her favorite show is ""The Dukes of Hazzard."" WHAT?! And the climax is blindingly silly, primarily because Patrick transforms from an alien hybrid into a... marionette. Yes, his alien form is this giant gangly puppet that is NOT SCARY because it clearly has no weight.

The sole saving grace is some of the acting. Henstridge is still beautiful and gives a powerful performance despite the thinness of her character, and despite his slight case of crazy-eyes, Lazard is also pretty good as a pampered future-career-politician who becomes consumed by his alien nature. But Helgenberger and Madsen both look POed to have been dragged back into this mess; and while Williamson is charming as Dennis, his character's sole trait is that he's always horny. It's almost as funny as it sounds.

While the original movie was nothing to write home about, ""Species II"" waters down the original plot, and leaves you wondering when the exciting part is supposed to happen. Guess what: it never does.",1449619200,7,3804,4.979527559055118

8743223,5,B018WQBMZA,OK so maybe I'm in the minority but I truly loved this movie. I'm a fan of the original but I really thought this sequel was a far superior film in terms of effects and the acting was much better plus Justin Lazard is really good to look at. This dvd brought to us by Shout Factory is another superb showcase for how passionate they are in bringing us the best quality releases of some of the lesser movies that have been long forgotten. Some really entertaining special features too well worth checking out that give great insight into the making of the film,1501200000,,559,4.384615384615385
8743224,2,B018WQBMZA,"Seeing this film for the first time in maybe 15 years, I have to say Species 2 is very dated. This film was never up to par with other big budget films from the 90's but I enjoyed it for what it was. I was eager to see if Species 2 still held up after all these years. After viewing it last night I learned that this was not the case. One of the problems I noticed right off were the practical effects. In the opening scene the space craft looked just like a model. The CGI in the film looked even less impressive looking grainy and cartoonish. The image quality was also not very good I don't know if Shout Factory did a proper restoration but it looked like an upscaled DVD at times. The movie plot and dialogue is worse than I remember. Although the film can be fun to watch at times the problems mentioned earlier make the movie less appealing. Look elsewhere.",1500249600,2,864,4.210843373493976

8743227,5,B018WQBMZA,"SPECIES II is pretty Good sequel to the original classic
Species III & IV pretty average in terms of very pathetic stupid storyline's
in my opinion the story of Eve ended at the last scenes in Species II
the 3rd & 4th sequels were just money makers by the producers nothing exciting
anyway Scream factory now own the rights to release it on blu-ray
new 1:85:1 HD transfer has been given which looks excellent very nice sharp & clear picture quality
much better quality than the old MGM DVD
plus the sound quality has been boosted to 5.1 master mix which sounds excellent
there are of course new extras plus the old extras from the very old MGM DVD
new interview with Actress Natasha Henstridge 15mins
new retrospective featurette with special effects make up man steve Johnson & others
new special effects outtakes & behind the scenes footage
plus all the extras from the old MGM DVD have been carried over
which is Deleted scenes, outtakes, Directors commentary, original Theatrical trailer and more
so time to throw out the old MGM DVD and buy this new blu-ray reissue
5 stars for this new blu-ray",1470441600,4,1099,4.670103092783505
