2535608,5,B000EULSRK,The Mickey Mantle dvd showed up on time for Christmas.  It was well priced and is a wonderful movie.,1200182400,,100,4.2631578947368425
2535609,5,B000EULSRK,"What a terrific and poignant insight into the man every boy hoped to be, the man who never was, and the man he became.  It reaffirmed, and even further defined, his greatness on the field, and cast a light on the sad, tragic, wasted, and ultimately redemptive path he traveled.  Viewers will be moved anew by their childhood memories and this hero of every boy, and again by their adult realiziation of ""the man behind the myth"", and the tragic irony that ultimately led to his greatest contributions to society and himself as told by his family, teammates, friends, and fans.",1189209600,,576,4.693069306930693
2535610,5,B000EULSRK,"This is as good a video on Mick as you will find ... every true fan of The Mick should own it.  But ... due to its time limitations for obvious reasons (made for TV), there was much left out that I would like to have seen.

Surely there is more video footage somewhere showing him hitting a few of his trademark/monstrous home runs  ... or least the ball parks where he hit them and the places where the ball landed, or how about letting us listen to several radio broadcast clips by Mel Allen when The Mick ""came to bat""?  That would let us again enjoy the true excitement of those times.

Also, I would like to hear someone's thoughts on why Mick, not a huge guy at 5'11 1/2"" and 195 lbs, had so much power ""for distance"", which was his distinction, heck, anyone can plink balls out there that just clear the fence ...

I personally think his power was a combination of two things, a) his quick twitch muscles (they had to be ""quick twitch"" because he also was the fastest guy around) combined with his b) early and extensive practice at swinging a bat ... nothing technical, he just put everything into every swing ... he just had that little something extra ... even today, no home run hitters can hit for distance like The Mick, certainly not consistently or even once in a while.  I'd take The Mick over Bonds any day!  Mick could hit the ball ""over buildings""!

Otherwise, it's a fairly comprehensive look at Mick's life from his early days right up through the very sobering and sad ending ... it covers Mick's start in baseball beginning with the everyday practices by the barn with his Dad from his early youth, which Mick apparently enjoyed (though his younger brothers became ""burned out"" on baseball from it, who according to Mick, could have been pretty good ball players), thru the wonder years of when his god given superstar talents blossomed fully (MVP years and between), and his injuries and slowly declining skills leading to his retirement, then his ""aimless years"" of middle age when he was ""on-display"" through countless golf tournaments and corporate events, and ultimately to the end, a life cut short by cancer, caused by who knows what, a lifetime of abusing his body????

""The Mick"", what a guy!  I loved him and still do ... I watched him play often on TV when I was in Junior High & High School, but what a person of extremes ... a heroic & charming super athlete (who comes along once every 100 years), as well as a tragic & pathetic drunk ... self-admitedly he wondered what he could have accomplished as a player had he skipped the booze, carousing late at night, and avioded those crippling/career limiting injuries ... we miss him.

Because of The Mick, I taught my son to switch hit ... down in the barn!

2535611,5,B000EULSRK,"I grew up in Northern N.J. in the '50's & '60's. Mickey Mantle was my hero, as well as that of hundreds of thousands of other kids. I saw this tonight as a rental. I'll be buying it tomorrow. Was he perfect?

( Definitely not). Was he an alcoholic? ( Yes) Was he a womanizer? (Yes). But there was something about him that made him larger than life. He was like a god. All it took was a wave toward me from Mick at Yankee Stadium, that I caught on an 8mm movie film. I floated on a cloud for a week. This 1 hour documentary captures almost everything I felt about him when I was a kid. If you love baseball, and if you loved the Mick, you'll love this film. Two of my life's highlights were getting to meet Mick, and getting a picture of my then 10 year old son shaking Mick's hand when he was near the end. I treasure those memories & that picture.",1172102400,15,848,4.017751479289941
2535612,4,B000EULSRK,"just a great dvd biography.  if youve seen the yankeeography on # 7, i think this is a step better.  but like all say, if you're a fan of the mick, this is a must own... so buy it :)",1156723200,3,182,3.525
2535613,5,B000EULSRK,"An absolute treasure for fans and historians; for the fans who might expect alot of the same clips and stills and are thrilled to see something ""new""; for the historians who can enjoy the high quality of the previously seen and (believed to be) first time viewing of the content.
It's always great to watch a non-overdubbed kinescope and here we have one from '52 with the Voice of The Yankees calling a MM base hit. (I could watch these undoctored clips for days on end...HBO, what do you think?...).
Besides the rare clips we have a chance to enjoy rarely seen Mantle relatives, and famous co-workers such as Bill ""Moose"" Skowron, Joe Pepitone, and Phil Linz, who are not as visible as some other teammates in similiar packages, in well-produced interview segments.
I was particularly touched by a 1968 (his final year) press conference including a young fan; and what was possibly his very last public statement in 1995.
The viewer/fan might find this documentary remarkably ""frank"", in comparison with other works which glorify the Mick without mention of his long, sad personal decline, although some of the stills of the dissipated Mantle are somewhat disturbing. I think this necessary, though mildly depressing theme could have actually been balanced with some *on-field* shortcomings - I refer to the 1959 to 1960 fall from grace when he was roundly booed - his batting average dropping 61, then 80 points in two years; an insightful segment could have been wrought in regard to the infamous ""bonehead"" of August, '60 when Mickey, thinking it was two outs, not one, did not run hard to first base, and caused Roger Maris to get into a double-play break up resulting in an injury which left him with 39 homers and Mantle 40. My idea is that Mick wanted Roger to break Ruth's record the next year because of this situation. There is no mention of the Mantle late '60 to '64 ""Comeback"".
Another lesser-discussed chapter (not explored here) is his serious shoulder injury in the '57 Series, which permanently affected his uppercut from the left side.
Yes, and it looks like the author also missed a chance to expound on that ""lost"" season. Not talkin' about '53 or '63, which left a huge gap statistically. It was that 1966 season, that summer, ten years after, when the Mick, coming up to age 35, had a June-July explosion of power, which really has remained unrivaled to this day.  Hitting monsterous home-runs in bunches, it only stopped when another miserable injury sidelined him. The round-trippers slowed, but enough energy was sustained for him to end the season at .288 (the previous season was .255). To me, this a very important element of the Legend. Although, I gotta believe, that Mick didn't realy notice. The Yankees finished 10th that year.
I've been a Mantle fan since the '50s and have read many books, essays, and articles on this legend, and I can say that this DVD, despite a few missing pieces which could really have put it in orbit, belongs on the same shelf as *any* exceptional treatment.",1154736000,36,3020,4.796545105566219

2535665,5,B000EULSRK,This doc in my opinon is the second best doc about a sports figure that I have seen and I've seen alot but this falls just short of a doc I saw about Johnny Unitus called Unitus but anyway back to Mantle this is a wonderfully made doc that spans over most his life and truely worth a watch.,1364515200,,290,3.9322033898305087

2535667,5,B000EULSRK,"Excellent! This is a fully-rounded portrait of one of the greatest sports heroes ever, Mickey Mantle.  Whether or not you grew up with The Mick as your personal favorite, this DVD will increase your appreciation of the man.  He was enormously talented, and unbelievably hard working.  His country charm, along with his undeniable presence on the baseball diamond made him the idol of many.  In his later life, he proved to be a true hero, facing the effects of his alcoholic past.  He may have been at his greatest near his end.  This excellent telling of the story of Mickey Mantle brought a tear to my eye.  Highly recommended.",1351209600,,629,4.715596330275229
2535668,5,B000EULSRK,Spellbinding account of a most gifted baseball player . Great footage and commentaries by contemporaries.

2535673,5,B000EULSRK,"Mickey was far from perfect, but he was a role model for many baseball fans in the 50's and 60's, a day when stars were shown without their warts and blemishes.  This is a greatly painted portrait of a real American hero, warts and all.  He seemed to be a simple midwestern boy with great athletic ability, but in reality, he was a driven man, driven by his father and later his father's memory.  His heroism really didn't start until he recognized his faults and did his best to overcome them.  Unfortunately, he couldn't save himself, but he did show his fans what a hero he was.",1206230400,4,581,4.401869158878505
8114519,5,B000EULSRK,"Mickey Mantle was my very first baseball hero when he was in his early years as a Yankee. Yes, he definitely was a flawed hero in his private life, but when he was on the field he possibly was the greatest force in the game. This video covers the good and the bad, very comprehensively. One thing that sticks in my mind are some of the charts and stats included on this disc. For example, it lists the dates, locations, and distances of Mickey's longest home runs. Most of those homers are unimaginable; Mark McGwire's longest shot would only be Number Seven on the Mick's list! If you're also a fan of the Mick, a Yankee fan, or just want to know more about this legendary player, this disc will fill the bill nicely.",1510876800,,718,4.365671641791045

8114527,5,B000EULSRK,"Mickey Mantle was born in Spavinaw, Oklahoma, on October 20, 1931. Early on, he worked in the mines. His father introduced him to baseball, and Mickey was a natural. He went on to play 18 years with the New York Yankees 1951-68. He wore #7. He hit 536 home runs. I played baseball with C & R Colyer, a team sponsered by my father and uncle. I wanted to be like Mantle but did not have his ability. Mantle was plagued by injuries his entire career, otherwise he might have been the greatest baseball player ever. Tragically, he became an alcoholic in later life and died at age 63. This bio really exposes Mantle's weaknesses, from his early drinking days with Billy Martin and Whitey Ford in New York to the drinking with his sons later on. Bob Costas and Billy Crystal are life long Mantle fans, and they cannot praise him enough.  It is true.  It took a great deal of courage for the Mick to admit his faults and tell young people not to be like him.  He redeemed himself in the end.",1394409600,,985,4.313513513513514
