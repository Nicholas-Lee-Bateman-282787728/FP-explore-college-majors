My favorite one is the Carrares, Stratas, Scotto and Stilwell in 1982 Zeffirelli version.  I find Giordani a great Rodolfo and Gallardo-Domas a very good Mimi.  This is worth keeping in your library.  I have collected 8 different La Boheme and this is one of the top of my list.  You won't be dissappointed",1239408000,2,404,4.7
8148751,4,B000J20W70,"Nothing wrong with this Zurich mounting, but no world-beater, either.  An attractive, competent cast, with Gallardo-Domas a touching Mimi, and Giordani in fine voice as Rudolpho (although perhaps a trifle fleshy for a starving Bohemian).  The direction and design are straightforward and unobtrusive, with the usual modern updates physically.  The transition between Acts I and II is swiftly and nicely handled, but the bare-bones Cafe Momus set is too stripped-down -- many of the objects and activities referred to in the libretto are simply abandoned, in favor of general happy-villager milling-around.  And what's with those costumes?  Wayyyyyy too many bare arms, thin dresses and t-shirts on display for outdoors in a Parisian winter.  The only real clunker here is a would-be coup de theatre at the final curtain, which begins as an unnecessary flourish and rapidly turns into a major howler, with the visibly irritated cast ambushed in the curtain call by ... see for yourself.  Or not.  If you're fans of these singers, or a Puccini completist, no reason to hesitate, but not a necessary acquisition by any means.",1224547200,3,1122,5.194444444444445

Now, since this was a Zurich Opera House production, I knew it would probably be a little off the wall (different, somewhat euro trashy, not quite traditional, whatever you wanna call it...) but it was much worse than I expected. I am a big fan of Cristina Gallardo Domas and that was my sole reason for choosing this, besides that La Boheme is one of my favorite operas. I also do like Lazlo Polgar a lot. But let me say, Cristina out-shined everyone. She was the only thing that made this opera worth watching. Aside from that, I was bored and I felt the singers all had a disconnect with each other, and with that the passion was lost. Where's the passion in this opera?? And in the beginning I felt like Mimi was forced to love Rodolfo...which was strange but kind of laughable at the same time. I was surprised when she came out donning a pair of cowboy boots with an unflattering dress and sweater combo. And then in Act 2 when she is telling Marcello her problems with Rodolfo, instead of listening to her like a good friend would do, he is off staring at another woman's backside and not even paying attention to Mimi. What the hell?? This whole production was just WEIRD. All of it. Weird. Nothing made sense, especially including the scenery and costuming (are they in the 80's here??) And the music didn't seem to flow properly and smoothly like it should have, especially in a Puccini opera!

I at least expected Musetta to save the day with her dramatic wittiness and humor that we all love, but that fell through also. The singer who plays Musetta wasn't all that great in my opinion and isn't good at pulling off the humor and true spirit of Musetta either. The singer who played Rodolfo wasn't too bad, but I felt at times he was having trouble and straining to get the right notes out.

If you are a Cristina Gallardo Domas fan, you might want to check this out just to have in your collection. Her singing is in even better form than ever. To me, she is truly Mimi. But otherwise, don't waste your money. I gave this DVD an extra star because of her. Otherwise I give it one star. It's amazing to me that they thought this was worthy enough to be filmed....",1222819200,3,2274,4.396674584323041
