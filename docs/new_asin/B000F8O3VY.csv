8118979,1,B000F8O3VY,"Dat's Tite TV is the comedy equivalent of ""It's so Cold in the D"" by T-Baby.  The DVD was released with the description of ""Acclaimed director Melvin James"" directing a ""hilarious urban comedy showcase.""  Apparently the renters at Netflix do not share this sentiment, as not a single Melvin James film has managed to earn a 3 out of 5 star rating.

This DVD is basically camcorder shots of the least funny comedy sketches that you will ever see.  From the very first sketch on the DVD (""True Hollywood Bulls**t"") you're treated to a gossip televion host reporting from an apartment bedroom.  As if that wasn't bad enough, the director saw fit to add a pre-recorded laugh track to most of the sketches (I can't even remember the last comic show to do that).

The models that appear in the DVD are beautiful, but past that, I have no reason to give this DVD more than one star.  Put simply, Dat's Tite TV is painfully unfunny; if you watch it, you won't laugh once.",1264636800,,963,4.5
