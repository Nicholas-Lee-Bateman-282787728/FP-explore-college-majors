Macon, Georgia gave us The Allman Brothers Band in 1969-and, they were to the forefront of a new Southern Rock scene. In particular the golden guitar grooves of Duane Allman started to develop a budding reputation for this act; and, over a course of time the kudos of his individual dexterity and the collective forces of his playing partners mustered up a legion of followers.
However, in 1971 a horrific motorbike crash robbed the world of Duane as the Brothers were on the cusp of joining the big league where a stage reputation was to be transferred in to studio renown. The Allmans had to re-assess and re-apply their template as a major component had been removed from their armoury. The hurdles in place included the fatality and further distress but the years ahead did not see them form pioneering the movement from which they sprung and along the way their sound could seen as being representative of the bigger picture.
The major players behind the construction of the well received Song Of The South: Duane Allman & The Rise Of The Allman Brothers Band delve in to the action after the sad death that changed the face of a famed American export. The resultant DVD entitled The Allman Bothers Band: After the Crash weds archive action with incisive information gathered from pertinent players and erudite experts. The longevity of The Allman Brothers against a series of storms speaks volumes for their tenacity and also the fact that there is a fan base that still demands the presence of these transatlantic troubadours.
The ubiquitous drug problems, periods of absent creativity and the change in tastes took its toll through the 80s and this two hour documentary traces these lows while annotating the highs-so there is a nice balance. The significance of Gregg Allman to the overall tale is also pinpointed and his core contribution or lack of enterprise when difficulties dictated is brought to the fore.
The evident line up changes never detracted from relying upon the roots of these rockers-and, their aim to take this sonic style persisted until 2014. There is also a legacy that sees itself in other talent that has come through the ranks and is also helping introduce fresh ears to the sonorous South. Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes is one such example and the 2016 releases of Woodstock Sessions Vol. 3 and Through a crooked Sun offer the evidence.
ZZ Top legend Billy Gibbons said that The Allman Brothers Band ""defined the best of every music from the American South in that time and that this allegiance was a true brotherhood of players-one that went beyond race and ego. It was a thing of beauty. Check out the tale for yourself..",1461888000,3,2701,4.806451612903226

7545544,5,B018ELUCC2,"When putting together any piece on a band such as The Allman Brothers, finding a new perspective to tell their famous story from is no easy task. But this DVD accomplishes a new look at the familiar - Told through the eyes of those closest to them, including the vice pres of Capricorn, their road manager, and producer, they give us a look into the group's emotional ups and downs, their perseverance, and their ability to overcome everything from heartbreak, to drug use, multiple band member deaths, and the ever changing music scene around them as they take us on a journey from the start all the way up to their final show in 2014. This DVD is a great look at one of America's greatest bands and a must have for any true fan that collects pieces offered of the legendary group and acts as a perfect way to introduce new fans to their story.",1457481600,17,845,4.423076923076923
7545545,5,B018ELUCC2,"I watch a lot of rock documentaries of various degrees of quality. While it seems that some on here have taken issue with the title, I'd hate to see how they respond to other specifically named documentaries.

If they could get past their own bias, they'd see a rather well crafted look at how the band moved past the death of Duane. Solid work all around and well worth a purchase.",1457308800,4,382,4.380281690140845

The Post Duane Years

I am not really a fan of the Allman Brothers Band but I believe in being fair and that is not what I saw when I read the reviews of this DVD on Amazon, I was shocked. I listened to the album several times and I cannot understand where the venom comes from but it you read the reviews carefully, you will see that the people probably did not even watch the entire disk. Five of these reviewers said nothing about what was on the DVD; they only thought that the title was terrible. Try to think of how many books and/or movies you have seen but did not like the title but enjoyed the read or the film. So I say that if you have nothing to say about the content, then say nothing. Personally I am not crazy about the names Michelle, homeboy or Wildermuth, Waxman or Wilson but that did not stop me from reading their reviews and it was so easy to do because two of them only bothered to write one word and the others just kind of said how bad the title was.
The film is the story of the band after Duanes death in 1971. That death came at a time when the band was reaching its creative peak and were ready to record their life performances. It was a new chapter and some of the bands finest music came into being.
This film, from the producers and directors of the critically acclaimed Song Of The South: Duane Allman & The Rise Of The Allman Brothers Band contains contributions of past members and those closest to the band during this period and we see wonderful archive footage and classic interviews that come together to give us the fascinating history of this legendary group who continued to perform and record for almost 50 years.
I was not aware that anyone was reviewing just the title instead of the entire DVD. Maybe now they will actually watch and have something different to say---if not, they can watch Dora the Explorer on TV because that is about as intelligent as they are.",1457222400,10,1951,4.316076294277929

8742205,4,B018ELUCC2,"Once again, too much time is spent on the early part of the story, and no so much the final parts. The story of the band during the 70s, is told in exquisite detail. However, they spend so much time on the tumultuous period between Eat a Peach and Enlightened Rogues, that the movie has to rush itself for the next 25 years of the story.

The rejuvenation of the band, Gregg's final battle with sobriety, the personnel changes of the late 90s, are all glossed over quickly. The final lineup that spanned from 2001-2014 (the longest of them all), gets only a few minutes time. The Trucks/Haynes/Oteil era was the most stable in the band's history. No mention at all was made of the seminal 40th anniversary occupation of the Beacon, with a treasure trove of guests on every night. (including Eric Clapton).  Again, no mention of the Gregg Allman tribute show, that highlighted the final year of the band.

It still is a sympathetic telling of the story after Duane, steering clear of being weighed down by the Scooter Herring, and Cher era.  However, the movie appears front loaded if the whole story is taken into account.  They could have made this disc until 1986, when Dickey and Gregg got their own bands together, which would become the precursor of the 20th anniversary lineup. Than make a third DVD, for the 1989-2014 era. Anyway, none has told this part of the story so well. A very enjoyable watch.",1468886400,9,1407,4.612
