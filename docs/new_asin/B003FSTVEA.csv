4119161,5,B003FSTVEA,"Fantastic! Anything I'd write would just echo all the other reviews. I can't imagine how great it would be if HD and widescreen format were readily available in 1998. I also watch many nature shows; and while I enjoy them, I have never wanted to watch one again right away.",1429401600,,273,4.48

4119165,5,B003FSTVEA,"I loved this for several reasons.one was the spectacular footage and then I have watched a lot of nature shows but this had creatures I had never seen before so that was different.then you got not one but two shows on this show.it is very family friendly ,informative and just absolutely beautiful to watch.",1399161600,2,307,4.703703703703703
4119166,5,B003FSTVEA,"I saw this program on television years ago and recorded it on my VHS.  I ran across the tape recently after not seeing it for a number of years.  I was curious and watched some of it and remembered how much I liked it, so I went searching on the internet to see if it was available on DVD...it was!  I watched it again a few times since I bought it...very well done!  Lots of great videography and an interesting narration to go along with it.  I recommend this DVD for anyone into watching ocean life videos...it's one of my favorites and I have seen quite a few of them...",1395446400,3,574,4.181818181818182

4119168,5,B003FSTVEA,"Amazing footage.  Restful but interesting narrative. The video quality is okay, but not suitable for very large screen.  Fascinating to watch; I don't like the modern fast-cut editing, so some might find it dull.",1366416000,8,212,5.205882352941177

4119174,5,B003FSTVEA,"This was precisely what I was looking to watch.. Something that has beautiful, and rare footage of the marine ocean life that explains everything in an interesting way.  It's the kind of relaxing footage and narration that would put you to sleep unless you're like me that is utterly fascinated by the footage and information presenting in the video.",1446940800,,350,4.932203389830509

8396141,5,B003FSTVEA,"In both words and pictures, this documentary is a lyrical paean to the beauty and wonders of sea life. One small correction (a mistake I too used to make): as anyone from the Florida Keys or the Caribbean will let you know, a conch is pronounced like ""conk.""",1469318400,,258,4.395833333333333
