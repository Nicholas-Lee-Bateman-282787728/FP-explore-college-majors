1707324,4,B000065T3Y,"The yoga was very sensuous, yet funny when you're with a bunch of people that you can make amusing comments with.  The women in the yoga part were absolutely magnificent.. very natural and beautiful.

The Tai Chi part was the really funny part.  The girls had probably never even heard of Tai Chi before.  It was like the director said ""Act like a snake"".. and they did.  However, the girls were sub-quality.. some fake body parts and out of shape.  VERY funny though!",1134864000,14,468,4.578313253012048
1707325,1,B000065T3Y,"Only slightly more exciting than ""virtual fireplace"". Seriously bad, horrible, annoying transition effects - the screen goes to blinging white every thirty seconds, horrible lighting - you just don't use red gels for a relaxing yoga scene - and nearly zero action. the ""advanced weapons"" portions of the tai chi was outright laughable...a bunch of strippers posing clumsily with obvious prop weapons...

The girls are well-built, any one of them could place in a miss trailer park pageant, but not one of them knows what she is doing or even looks asian for that matter. A few of them are sporting dragon tatoos, if that counts for anything. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those martial arts purists (I've alway felt that self defense is best learned by barfighting) but even I was insulted by the performances.

I bought this DVD because I have an enormous TV I never use and wanted something to run constantly and in the background. I figured naked women was more interesting than fish, but this DVD challenges that theory. Even if you aren't looking at it, the lighting and transition effects create an uncomfortable atmosphere in the room. Everybody involved with this DVD (except the models) should be shot.

It fails for atmosphere, fails for vouyerism (get totally nude aerobics instead), fails as instructional material and fails as performance art. Just a waste of time and money.",1114041600,107,1393,4.919148936170213
1707326,5,B000065T3Y,"I know nothing about Yoga nor Tai Chi, but I do know totally naked, and this DVD's got it!  Five ""thumbs"" up!",1105920000,10,109,3.9545454545454546
1707327,4,B000065T3Y,"the first priority i found to start enjoying this dvd.was to findwhich chapters could be watched clearly, by adjusting the colour,and turning the brightness up.the yoga  one hour part consisted of a few beautifull nude womenadopting some anatomically attractive yoga poses.changes in lighting often made detail ,more shadowy than preferable. the tai chi part was  easier to relax and watch,and good for repeat viewing. the four or five girls are all beautifulland naked throughout.the second half of the tai chi matches the vulnerability of the womens bodys to  powerplay involving martial weapons.",1027987200,3,598,5.478260869565218
1707358,1,B000065T3Y,"Save your money! The Director obviously feels that covering up the nudity with blue lighting, red lighting, smoke/fog, and deep shadows is artsy, but it diminisses the whole idea of NUDITY. The women are attractive, but do not know much about yoga or tai chi. The tai chi women have lots of tatoos (possibly fake, just for the video). This director prefers the red lighting and fog, the yoga director prefers the blue lighting. There are definitely better videos like one out there.",1330819200,,482,4.819277108433735
1707359,2,B000065T3Y,"Don't buy this video if you really want to do yoga or tai-chi. You will be able to some of the exercises, but not all of them. The reason why is there are multiple girls doing the workout, and they use each other for their positions. So unless you have 2-3 naked people to work out with you, don't buy this!!!! Although I must say, I think the video was made for the sole purpose of exoticacy, and they did pull that off.",1284336000,,421,4.0843373493975905
1707360,1,B000065T3Y,"Even though I read the reviews that stated how poor this video is, I bought it anyway as a gift for my husband and me. I didn't think it could be nearly as awful as they said it was....but it was! The gorgeous bodies of the women didn't make up for the fact that there were NO exercise sequences to follow. We wanted to exercise along with the ladies, but there wasn't any way to do that. The ladies basically just pose and preen slowly while the camera pans up and down. There was a certain level of interest at first (their bodies are great to watch) but after a bit, we just laughed. It's funny to think about these women making this video; they probably had to film a bunch of 'takes' because they kept laughing.",1262822400,,716,4.233576642335766
1707361,1,B000065T3Y,"Way to cutesy, They don't have a clue about yoga or tai chi.  I wanted the real thing.  The exercise video was pretty good, I expected this one to be better .",1240272000,,158,3.90625
1707362,5,B000065T3Y,"Anytime you have naked women and hairy bush showing in a video, it is great!! Alot of bending over showing the lips and shapely butts!!",1198713600,4,135,4.44
1707363,4,B000065T3Y,I liked what I saw in both the yoga and tai chi very pretty women,1178928000,3,65,3.4
1707364,1,B000065T3Y,"Yes, the girls are naked but there is smoke and they are on a turntable that keeps moving around so it really isn't that much to see what with the plastic trees and things getting in the way of the view.

The lighting is poor. It is sort of yoga but not really. The tai chi is even worse. Partially nude women with swords dancing around. I didn't find it sexy or even slightly interesting. It's not even good enough to say it is boring. It is less than boring.",1164412800,29,460,4.111111111111111
1707365,1,B000065T3Y,"I have two motivations for picking this up. The first was to see athletic women working out in the nude. The second was to maybe be able to get my wife to use it. I'm not a hairy armpit on women sort of guy. I want to see women who are more than attractive. But these women, they aren't attractive women, they are homely women who have no flesh on their body except for the really bad ball shaped fake breasts in front. If you don't mind bad fake breasts on anorexic women my guess is you still won't be satisfied with these videos because they don't give a real payoff. It's not pornograpy, it's not art, it's not a sensual erotic tasteful workout. It's too bad, the potential for something like this done right would be exciting, but don't count on this one.",1157068800,15,760,4.284722222222222
1707366,1,B000065T3Y,"Waste of time if you are looking for a video that you can follow along with the Yoga.  The girls look OK, but not great.",1140825600,7,120,3.8
1707367,5,B000065T3Y,"First off, I am not qualified to say whether this DVD contains actual Yoga & Tai Chi.  According to the credits, it was put together by some people who knew what they were doing.  Whether that's true is not something I can vouch for.

What I CAN say is that this DVD fulfilled the purpose I bought it for.  I actually do my own workout, but I like to do it while watching this DVD.  It serves as ""motivation"" for me.  In that area, there is no doubt that the DVD succeeds.

All of the women in both the Yoga & Tai Chi workouts range between very attractive & drop-dead gorgeous.  All of them have immaculate & athletic bodies.  For me, whether it's genuine Yoga & Tai Chi or not, the main feature is its erotic approach.  The nudity is uninhibited & natural.  You never have any of the women attempting to cover / hide any part of their bodies.

So, depending on what you're after, this DVD may or may not be for you.  If you're really into Yoga / Tai Chi you may want to view it first before buying.  If you're just a fan of nude workouts in general, this one is a can't miss!",1137110400,40,1077,4.115384615384615
7961233,1,B000065T3Y,Not at all what I expected,1525392000,,26,3.5
7961234,1,B000065T3Y,"I always enjoy looking at nude women however it is evident that no one on this team ever saw Tai Chi or looked to see what it is about.
It is possible that someone on the team observed a yoga routine but forgot most of it. there are several nude yoga dvd's that actually show yoga.",1499040000,,281,4.035714285714286
7961235,3,B000065T3Y,boring...needs more graphic shots,1485993600,,33,7.5
7961236,1,B000065T3Y,Useless DVD. Whatever performed in the DVD is not real Yoga or Tai Chi,1484611200,,70,4.071428571428571
7961237,2,B000065T3Y,It was dull.,1483574400,,12,3.3333333333333335
7961238,5,B000065T3Y,A top choice for a great literary classic . I would highly recommend this for your health ! I have watched it many times and am going to order more copies for my friends .,1451347200,,171,3.914285714285714

7961240,4,B000065T3Y,The workouts feel a bit rushed but the models are pretty and the workout is for real. It's a good intro to tai chi as well!,1378252800,,123,3.769230769230769
7961241,2,B000065T3Y,"Ran it once - that was enough. Certainly not instructional, this product isn't even interesting. I'm not sure what the producer intended, but probably only to sell a product based upon the title.",1357430400,,195,4.9393939393939394
