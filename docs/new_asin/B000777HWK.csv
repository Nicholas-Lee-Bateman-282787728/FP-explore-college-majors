8045317,1,B000777HWK,"Possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Thought it was a recent (2010) film of the same name, but it wasn't!  Complete waste of 30 dollars.",1304985600,,141,4.222222222222222
8045318,5,B000777HWK,"Okay, I directed this movie, so my opinion is skewed.  To be honest, it's in no way perfect but it is interesting and is one of the very early examples of modest, indie, cross-cultural stories.  I say:  Check it out!",1242518400,5,216,4.35
8045319,2,B000777HWK,"I picked up this film purely because I am a Westerner who appreciates and enjoys well-done, high quality Bollywood films, and was also drawn to the idea of crosscultural romance between a young native Californian and a native of India.  The cover of the VHS box for this film should have been a tip-off for me.  The majority of the movie looks as though it could have been shot in someone's garage, and it probably should have STAYED there.

Vikram is a young Indian man seeking a college education at Berkley, and comes to stay with his sponsors.  Unfortunately, by a bad twist of fate, they are not there to receive him and he must seek out room and board on his own.  He ends up taking a job as a front desk hotel clerk in exchange for a room, in the seedy Tenderloin district of San Francisco.  Vikram encounters Sue, a young, aspiring Bohemian artist, with a bad mouth and a huge attitude.  Why he falls for her, I don't know.  Why they stay together, I really don't care.  What is evident is that Vikram's visitors' visa has expired and he must marry a citizen or face deportation.  Hmmm...I wonder where this is going in the plot.  Haha....

This is one of the most poorly acted, badly written films EVER.  Don't waste your $3.00 or the hour and a half it takes to get through it.",1120262400,,1287,4.379746835443038
8045320,4,B000777HWK,"This movie came out shortly before the movie ""greencard"", starring Gerarde Depardu.  The both of them sharing hte same plot, yet director David Rathod was the first with the idea. Wanting to direct, produce, and edit his first full length film, Rathod found the money to make it happend, by asking friend and artist Huey Lewis to help him out.
  The movie stars Ashutoh Gowariker as Vikram, a high school graduate come to America for a good college education.  As soon as he steps foot in America, his Visa is shortend from 6 months to one.  Putting that aside, he scouts out for his sponors home.  Finding that they had left, and were not returning in the near future, he is forced to fend for himself in Downtown San Franciso.  He soon finds a job, and a friend, Sue, a bohemian girl who is not as easy to be friends with as he hoped, and the time on his visa is running out.  The movie is set as a romantic comedy, when it would be more towards a drama.  Yes, tehre are funny parts, but alot of it is serious.  Overall, Rathod does a good job in showing us the toils of coming to America.  The music complementst the movie, a perfect soundtrack done by Sheila Chandra and Jai Uttal.  I would recomend seeing this, it is worth the price.  Final note, see if you can find comedian Gregory Proops within the movie.",985564800,3,1314,4.3580246913580245
