8315313,3,B001KMB740,"The director should've tackled less and focused on directing & producing as opposed to adding acting to his ""roles."" The movie feels like it's moving in real time; a week in ""movie time"" equals two weeks in real time. Glad he was able to salvage his movie from a distributor who went bankrupt and then, put it ""out there."" Read at imdb.com. Congrats, Mr. Anthony.",1243036800,,363,4.6
