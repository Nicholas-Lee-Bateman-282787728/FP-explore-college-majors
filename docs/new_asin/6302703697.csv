I couldn't believe the dad acted all pro-life when his daughter was going to have to raise a baby so young, but then when his wife got pregnant, his philosophies sure changed in a hurry.",1524268800,,253,4.163265306122449

8185418,4,6302703697,"This film though not on DVD yet, is a rare find on VHS.  Seldom aired on Television.  You won't see George C. Scott in uniform but you will see him in a judicial robe.  His new wife a 40ish Jaqualin Bissett finds herself pregnant by him, though BOTH vowing (due to HIS advanced age) never to have children.  She, surprising to even herself, wants to keep the child.  Scott cannot fathom becoming a father in his late 60's must make a ""CHOICE"".  Scotts daughter from his late wife, Melissa  Gilbert finds herself pregnant (from her on again off again boyfriend)  and ALL must make CHOICES.  Set in a wintery town where fur is still worn for stature, you will see that even the very rich don't cope as well as you might think. Scott makes a choice in the end with a slightly surprising finale.  A date film for older adults and one to rent or buy for those days you want a bit of dramma, romance, choices.",1066435200,,903,4.321428571428571
