1256283,4,B00002SWEK,"I got this in a two movie set on sale at a major retailer, the other movie was McLintock! These aren't actually ""official"" releases. The quality of the disc was pretty good on this movie mostly due to its being a b&w film, I suppose.

It's actually one of the Duke's best westerns. He's an outlaw, been wounded badly & is on the run. He passes out, falls off his horse & is brought home by a family of Quakers. Here is our conflict: we have a family that's adamant about non-violence & a man who lives by the gun. The film co-stars Gail Russell; she's the daughter of the Quaker parents & the love interest. She tries to convert the badman into a Quaker. Duke, for his part, makes a sincere effort. Of course, it's his past that comes back to haunt him & almost forces him to return to his violent ways. It's a stark western scenic-wise.

There's a bonus feature here too but almost aa Duke fans will know this stuff anyway. Get the popcorn, baby, we watchin' the Duke tonight!",1198627200,,977,4.304347826086956
1256284,4,B00002SWEK,"This is a classic film from the master actor. This can't be compared to the technical aspect of western films in this era, of course. It's an excitement to see a great film from the great actor like John Wayne.",960854400,,210,4.275

The story begins with a man shooting his revolver in a semi-circle, then riding away. He is chased by other riders. [The scenic background seems familiar.] A couple in a wagon see a lone rider fall. They take him to the telegraph office. He is Quirt Evans! He has a reputation for killing men and loving women. What is his destiny? The doctor removes the bullet, and advises the family to put him out. Mayhem, theft, and murder are too common in the Wild West. [Was that really true?] The delirious man speaks out. Was he guilty of some crime? ""Who cares what happens to him?"" Is realism that is untempered by humanity just mean and cold? The family offers him smoked sausages and eggs for breakfast. Donuts too! Are only the doers harmed by an evil act? [Not true in this world.]

The next morning we see four men in town, they are seeking Quirt Evans. [Can you judge a man by his enemies?] Quirt is warned about them, and prepares to meet them. They make a deal, the deed is signed. Quirt will ride away now. What about Penny? Her young brother looks up to him. [What kind of hero worship is that?] A big landowner prevents them from having water for their crops. Quirt Evans negotiates with Frederick Carson to release some water from the dam. ""How wonderful!"" [Sharing property with the community?] Did the prayers work? Are we better off sharing and looking out for each other? A man arrives looking for Quirt; he is the marshal of this territory. Randy McCall rides by. ""Keep the Commandments."" We see family life. Randy offers Quirt a deal involving a cattle herd. Will we all be happy by being friendly? Quirt decides its time to ride away. His friend Randy reads from the Bible.

Elsewhere men lie in wait for a herd of cattle. Riders attack the cowboys with the herd. Quirt and his riders attack the attackers (who we've met before). In town, Randy and Quirt drink champagne with two hostesses. Has Quirt changed? Neal sings a song to provide entertainment. Quirt wins at the wheel. The Baker brothers are upset. There is a barroom brawl for action and entertainment. ""Where would you get a Bible?"" Quirt returns to the Worth family. Penny knows about the outside world. The marshal arrives silently, asks some questions, and leaves.

Quirt must make a decision, and chooses a new life. But someone takes a shot at Quirt who is riding a wagon. Three riders chase this wagon! The wagon goes off a cliff! They are saved, but Penny needs the doctor. Quirt rides off before Penny recovers. ""I can't understand it."" A message is delivered to Laredo: come outside. The men inside the bar leave by the back door. Where is the marshal? People outside run for cover. A wagon rolls up. Laredo and his buddy fall, there is a surprise! ""Nothing ever works out right"" says the marshal.

This movie shows the classic Westerns of the 1930s and early 1940s have ended. The big landowner agrees to release water to the small ranchers upon request. The ""badman"" turns out to be a former deputy town marshal. It is somewhat sentimental, but still an entertaining movie. You can decide how plausible are some of the scenes. This story about a gunfighter reforming his life was echoed in ""High Noon"". The villains, Laredo and his men, are small-time operators, not employed by the big rancher or by any business in town. Usually, it was the owner of the saloon and casino in the older movies.",1511222400,,3414,4.590163934426229
