7954933,4,B00005UM4D,"For someone whose films are so coveted by film buffs, so little has been visually documented about the making of them and the person responsible for them. This DVD, part of The Directors series, does a good job at providing the first step to showcasing Michael Mann and his work.
All of his feature films are covered and many of the actors he's worked with over the years, from Jon Voight to Christopher Plummer, are interviewed. My only complaint is that it's too short! Clocking in at just under an hour, this documentary barely scratches the surface -- I mean, an entire hour could have been spent on The Insider alone!
That aside, this documentary is a solid introduction to the films of Michael Mann, definitely worth purchasing for the fans and worth a look for people interested in getting into his movies.",1059609600,3,813,4.6923076923076925
7954934,5,B00005UM4D,"Martin Scorsese said a few years back that Michael Mann was one of America's great film directors.  While having immense respect and admiration for Scorsese, I was elated to hear one of my movie icons saying pretty much what I've been saying for many years.  I was a fan of Michael Mann before I knew who he was and what he was capable of.  My first exposure was THE JERICHO MILE on TV - a made for TV movie starring Peter Strauss of RICH MAN, POOR MAN fame.  One thing that caught and mesmerized me was the music (I believe it was Jack Nitzsche who blended incredible instrumental versions of the Rolling Stones' SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL & NO EXPECTATIONS). But the acting, writing, etc. was so far above normal television that I couldn't stop talking about that show for years.  Then came THIEF (music by Tangerine Dream - also used for the film score of THE KEEP - an underrated and brilliant piece of work, as are all of Mann's gifts to the cinema)followed by MIAMI VICE, and with its success more TV: CRIME STORY & PRIVATE EYE (the latter an incredible show reminiscent of PETER GUNN of the 1950's but was not seen or appreciated by many).  I could write and rave 20,000 words without blinking an eye in regards to Mr. Mann.  He seems to only make a film every 2 or 3 years - but when he does, I pay box office dollars - partly to support his genius and partly to be totally entertained.  LAST OF THE MOHICANS/HEAT/THE INSIDER & ALI have all laid proof to his talents.  THE DIRECTORS is a series paying homage & respect to major and gifted directors.  I have seen each episodic look into our filmmakers' lives and works and, I just saw the one on Michael today and am speechless!  If you haven't followed his career like I have, I highly recommend seeing this one hour extravaganza.  You will see and hear some of the actors he has hand-picked for his movies, and upon completion of this too short hour, you will want to see and experience everything this gifted man has bestowed upon us, the lucky recipients of his sheer, bravado and infectious magic.  To requote Martin Scorsese:  Michael Mann is one of America's great directors!",1023494400,9,2136,4.471649484536083
7954935,5,B00005UM4D,"This DVD is excellent value for money and the 60 minutes fly by when you're watching it.
I was particularly pleased to see that Manhunter was given detailed analysis (including an interview with William L Petersen, who is clearly a BIG fan of Mann's work)
I was disappointed however, that perhaps Mann's most interesting movie - ""The Keep"" - is hardly discussed at all. Whilst it's true that this movie is somewhat obscure and unknown, it would have been useful if they had researched into that particular time in Mann's career in more detail.
Mind you, at this price I should not ask too much, and the coverage of all of his other work is excellent. ALI is not mentioned though really, because I suspect this DVD was in production before ALI filming was complete.
Overall, this DVD product is an essential purchase for any fans of Michael Mann or his movies and despite cutting a couple of corners here and there, it thoroughly deserves the 5 star rating at this bargain price.",1015545600,6,978,4.658959537572255
7954936,4,B00005UM4D,"Solid entry in the AFI Director's series.  The career of Michael Mann is (finally) profiled from his early TV days of Starsky and Hutch and Vegas, through Jericho Mile, Thief, Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, Heat and The Insider. The Keep is mentioned, but only that.  Very little info on Miami Vice or Crime Story.  Nothing on Ali.  Interview with Mann is great, if only because there are not more interviews with him available.  Questions mostly concern influences and do not delve too deeply into his filmmaking process.  Nothing about his use of music is explored, which is a missed opportunity.  But we do learn about how the story of Heat was made first as a TV movie called L.A. Takedown, and later, why Mann took his name off the broadcast TV version of Heat.  Interviews include Jon Voight, James Belushi, Diane Venora, Wes Studi, Dennis Farnia and William Peterson.  Everyone seems to agree that Mann is detail obsessed, and by the richness of his work, its hard to argue.",1014163200,,983,4.735294117647059
