648371,5,6303420648,"Bertrand Tavernier's superb L.627 bears scant resemblance to the description its UK DVD distributors put out - `This gritty police drama shows us the underbelly of the Parisian drug trade. Lulu is a tough streetwise narcotics cop who, like a Frank Serpico or a Dirty Harry Callahan, doesn't play by the rules or kowtow to his weak and/or corrupt superiors. Lulu thrives in this violent world, where sheer guts can overcome his squad's deficiencies of money and equipment.' In reality, it's much more down to earth and compelling look at the day to day realities of fighting a never-ending war, spending more time on the mundane realities of police work and its limitations. These cops aren't Dirty Harry, they're underfunded and unappreciated and never bring down any big guys. When a long-time surveillance fails, it's because of the most petty reason imaginable. When there's finally some violence it's just over a petty offence rather than a major crime. They fill in forms in a crappy prefab office, wrestle with budget cuts, play practical jokes and make no difference whatever - all of which is surprisingly gripping.

At times some of the characters threaten to stray into cop movie clichs, such as Didier Bezace's relationship with a prostitute and casual informer, and there's a subplot with wedding videos that the film could do without, but other than that there's little to find fault with. Tavernier's direction is at once convincingly observational while remaining unobtrusively cinematic and he's assembled an equally convincing ensemble cast, including Philippe Torreton, who would go on to play leading roles in Tavernier's Capitaine Conan and It All Starts Today. It's not a short movie - it's not far off the two-and-a-half hour mark - and as befits its subject matter it never reaches a grand climax but leaves its characters no better than when we found them, but you won't feel you've wasted the time you spend with them.

The French PAL  DVD boasts an impressive array of extras - audio commentary by Bertrand Tavernier, Michel Alexandre and Charlotte Kady, 3 deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage, stills gallery and theatrical trailer - but while the feature had English subtitles, none of the extras did. Optimum's UK DVD offers a different but very decent selection of its own: a different English-language commentary and lengthy on-camera interview with Tavernier and the trailer, and offers a very respectable subtitled widescreen transfer of the film itself.",1355097600,5,2492,5.1330049261083746
648372,4,6303420648,"If one were to ever question where we, as American audiences, get our prime-time television ideas, it should never be considered original, or genius, or groundbreaking - it should be simply coined, ""borrowed"".  As we see popularity with such shows as ""The Office"" or the most recent ""Life on Mars"", we seem to be gobbling up popular programs from across the pond at the speed of light, and oddly more and more seem to feel less authentic.  Sure, the actual conversations and dynamic dilemmas that occur each episode my be home-grown, but the idea - it is the original idea that should be coveted.  It would be equal to saying that you love DSL without ever experiencing dial-up - how can you compare?  Recently, I was able to scrounge around and discover a VHS that may, upon first viewing, seem like a hodgepodge of police interferences within the confines of Paris, but look deeper.  Does our heroine, a tough, never by the book-paper pushing detective whom isn't afraid to corrupt the system to get results, a cop who isn't afraid to have a wife, but also a prostitute informant on the side?  Wouldn't you agree that perhaps I am explaining the life of Vic Mackey from ""The Shield""?  Yet, I am not - I am talking about Lulu, our Parisian officer in the outstanding ""L.627"".

Lost within the conversion from VHS to DVD, this obscure title has not seen the light of day for a long time; in fact, you could probably find this at a yard sale for less than a dollar.  If this is ever the case, pick it up and buy it - it is worth viewing at least once to demonstrate the raw grittiness of police work.  It has never been a colorful position, despite the humorous depiction in ""Police Academy"", and director Bertrand Tavernier knows how to push the envelope to such an extent that our fictional officer's cause affects the reason.  They want drug off the streets, Lulu is constantly pushing his girlfriend to stop using drugs, but the means are not readily available.  With broken police vehicles, pranksters instead of officers, lacking budget with technology, Lulu and Company are forced to take measures into their own hands.  They fight crime, perhaps not the way the officer handbook suggests, but they fight crime.  One scene that specifically stands out is one where Lulu is about to bust a dealer/supplier in a nearby park, he uses a nearby school to ensure that they are able to see the transaction take place.  They are able to find an empty room, but the principal doesn't want them in the school - contradictory to the ideals that schools want drugs off the street.  There was this sense of animosity between person and officer - as if the principal didn't believe that our officers would actually do anything of value.  This was a small, yet shocking scene that defines Tavernier's central theme.

Does Lulu get the drugs off the streets?  Does he finally get the funding that he wants?  Does his personally life collide with his cop life?  These are all questions that Tavernier answers with small, seemingly insignificant scenes.  There is a perfect ending scene that resonates within my mind between Lulu and his prostitute sideline.  It demonstrates the quality of Lulu's work, and summarizes this film in a small 10-minute scene.  That seems to be Tavernier's trademark with this film.  A full range of quality small scenes that tie our characters together.  Individually, this is a rather bland film - difficult to begin and even longer to finish with nearly 2  hours of play time, but intertwined, these scenes speak about the Parisian police force.  ""L.627"" is a film that resonates within the mind.  Oddly, I recently finished watching ""La Haine"" for the first time, and could argue that this is Tavernier's counter-discussion.  Here, he shows why there may be police racism, why the law uses brutality, and why frustration between officers reigns supreme.  Kassovitz's film gives us the counter-point, the view from the poverty on the streets.

Overall, does ""L.627"" demand repeat viewing?  Is it wronged not to have a DVD release?  These are all important questions, but the answer is not readily available.  ""L.627"" demonstrates powerful acting, documentary-esque camera work, and a chilling theme, but the honesty lies within Tavernier's storytelling.  While Lulu is our central character, this isn't a story about him.  We don't have an emotional rollercoaster of a film where our hero redeems himself at the end.  This isn't a Hollywood movie.  In ""L.627"" social commentary is king, and we, as outsiders looking in, must just absorb the honest nature of the film.  It is a tale of good corruption, hard working individuals, and the hardships of control.  This will not be a film for everyone, but those privy enough to catch a viewing of this film will be impressed by every element of this film.  From the filming to the unequivocal truths, ""L.627"" is a film to absorb.  I am just sorry that I didn't see this film sooner.

Always remember, instead of WWVMD? (aka What Would Vic Mackey Do?) - try thinking of WWLD? (aka What Would Lulu Do?).

648373,3,6303420648,"Bertrand Tavernier, who directed this 1992 policier, is an interesting guy who used to be a film critic before turning to film directing in 1974 with The Clockmaker starring Philippe Noiret.  In this film, L.627, he turns to the policier, the French crime film, with mixed results.

This is a technically competent film in which the emphasis is on realism and in that the film succeeds.  The viewer unquestionably gets the sense that the dialogue and action that comprise the story could really happen.  The actors all do a fine job, no question.

What's missing here, however, is real suspense.  Rather than being a real policier, this plays out as a drama, one in which one thing happens after another with no momentum.  Please note that this is not a criticism from the point of view of being habituated to overkill Hollywood films in which bombast wins out over everything else--i.e., the expectation of a major shootout, an explosion, or something equally ridiculous.  Rather, this criticism refers to a critical element of any thriller, and certainly of a crime film--that of real danger.

The viewer never feels that any of the narcs (drug cops) portrayed are in any real danger.  They plan a bust, they make the bust--or they don't, when the dealers sense there are cops around and run away--they take in the people they've nabbed, book them, put them in jail.  Essentially this is what recurs again and again, with a few additional plot elements (the main character's relationship to his wife and an HIV-positive prostitute he befriends) thrown in to provide a meager amount of variation.

The sense here is that Tavernier, above all else, wanted to portray the lives of these guys in real life as accurately as possible.  That's all well and good, but then why not make a documentary?  The dialogue does crackle with sarcasm from time to time and even when it doesn't, it's strong and credible.  But because the danger element is missing, this is not a policier I would count in the first rank.  That honor belongs instead to the great 1982 film La Balance (interestingly enough directed by an American ex-pat, Bob Swaim, but with all French actors, French settings) and a brand new 2004 film, not released commercially in the US, 36 Quai des Orfevres directed by Olivier Marchal.  If the latter film ever somehow makes it Stateside commercially, do NOT hesitate.  Rush right out and see it immediately.  It's the best policier in 20 years.

L.627 is well thought out, well written, and well acted, but because of its very obvious lack of suspense, does not really work as a policier.  Tavernier should have done this as a documentary.",1112918400,3,2645,4.82039911308204
