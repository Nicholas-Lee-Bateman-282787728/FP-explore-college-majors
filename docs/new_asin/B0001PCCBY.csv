8015991,5,B0001PCCBY,"Sang H. Kim gives a thorough explanation of many sparring techniques as well as strategies,combinations and footwork. Each technique is shown several times and broken down into clear and simple steps, advice is given on the best situations to use the techniques and real competition footage is shown to demonstrate how these skills have been used by fighters at international level.

The material looks a bit dated nowadays as master Kim demonstrates the various techniques with old style chest protectors from the 90's. However the skills covered are very relevant as master Kim provides insight and experience from a lifetime of Taekwondo practice.

As a blackbelt I was able to glean plenty of wisdom, drills and strategies from watching this DVD. Experienced fighters and beginners would benefit from the clear and detailed information presented in this series. Absolutely superb.",1343347200,2,884,5.35251798561151
8015992,5,B0001PCCBY,"The counter-attacking video (based on a 4 video series) is a combined with the footwork video.  An epic combination!

The counters in this are fantastic.  Instructors, please get this and teach your students how to counter.  I bought this and greatly improved my sparring game.  Competitors, this is your sparring Bible!  Study it, pick it apart, learn from it, try out what you're learning.

A ton of counters are shown with a lot of variety.  Simple counters (which are always the best), intermediate counters, and advanced (don't even try these until you are awesome with the first two).

Some counters are questionable.  98% of them are great.  You'll notice that nothing beats doing a hoojin (sliding back) step round house (it's shown a quite a few times in different scenarios).

All of these counters can make excellent hogu drills (for you instructors :) )

Sang incorporates actual fight footage to demonstrate the application.  That is quite helpful.  However, some of the applications are actually not good examples of his specific counter techniques (one is even spliced weird to make it appear like a spinning technique was performed).  Too bad youtube wasn't around when these were made.  So make sure you use youtube if you want good, updated examples.  Most of the ones Sang uses are great though!

Now, on to the footwork.  Wow!  This truly changed my game.  It took me from Rocky 1 to Rocky 3 (led feet to dancing to the rhythm of ""Eye of the Tiger"").  I knew nothing about footwork until this video.  My agility sky rocketed.  Looking back, most of it is pretty basic.  If you are a competitor - check it out and study it!  Footwork should be a part of your every day training routine.

Instructors, don't teach your students to block with their arms (or body and face), give them the gift of footwork!  As an instructor, I always say, ""The best block is to not block.  Don't get hit!""

This tape will teach you how to make em' miss and make em' pay!!!",1313625600,,1972,4.678362573099415
