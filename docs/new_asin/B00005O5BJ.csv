7948322,3,B00005O5BJ,"Disc 1 was about the Whitebases struggle to get to Earth.  Disc 2 centered on Char's plans of revenge and White Base escaping enemy territory.  Disc 3 however is on the side of having no base at all say for the sole part of Char's dismissal from Dozle Zabi's command and guerilla ace Ramba Ral and his lover Crowly Hamon entering the fray to destroy the Whitebase.  With the exception to Ramba Ral's introduction (including his new Gouf mobile suit with electrified whip and shield) there is little here.  The first episode has Garma's lover chase the Whitebase with 3! carriers.  Whitebase struggles against Garma's sole carrier, here they take out three with no problem.  Next is Military Cmdr Giren Zabi speaking aloud at a funeral about the Zeons fight for independance and introduces the aforementioned Ramba Ral.  The next episode is called one of the best in the series with Amuro meeting his mom.  I think it's sad and also a little too painful for it's own good.  (Amuro races home to see mom, gets jeered at by FED soldiers and later beaten up by them and when he finally meets her, he has to defend himslef and has his mom deem him a barbarian).  It's just a little too sad to see it.  The last ep is about desperate Zeon soldiers using bombs and hoverbikes to destroy the Gundam.  Creative, but another pointless episode.  Last but not least, it is the first disc to not have 5 episodes (Kukuru Doans Island ep will not be released here due to the creator disaproving of the poor quality in story and appearance, it would have been here on this disc) but alas, that would have only made the disc even more unfoccussed.  Don't worry though after this disc, the show reaches it's middle and in my opinion it's the best part of the series.",1045440000,,1748,4.525477707006369
