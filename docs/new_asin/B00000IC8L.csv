1221022,1,B00000IC8L,"Madacy has done it again...taken what could have been decent DVD's and turned them into trash. The video transfer from film is very poor, but the worst is the audio. Madacy has a history of producing low-cost low-quality  legacy DVD's, just look at other reviews of Madacy titles (check out  Charlie Chaplin DVD's). This is a shame because younger folks who've never  seen these classics may walk away with the wrong impression.",951955200,41,428,4.916666666666667
1221023,1,B00000IC8L,I haven't seen this DVD but the reviews above don't surprise me in the least.  I have bought another Macady DVD (Laurel & Hardy double feature) which was awful - soundtrack out of sync & poor picture  quality - my advice is regardless of the film & its star(s) - if its  released by Macady - then stay well away and save your money,941932800,22,331,4.140625
7910163,1,B00000IC8L,the worst dvd i ever got so look for the w c fields festival only on ebay for a cent less than $10 including shipping which is cheaper than trying to find a low priced criterion collection version!,1462406400,,197,4.2105263157894735
7910164,1,B00000IC8L,"I was disappointed  with the video quality especially on side 2 and the Audio. On side 1 the background hum was very loud.

They should have a disclaimer stating this is crap video and crap audio put together for sale.

I'm a big fan but I found this dvd unwatchable.",1374969600,,267,4.3
7910165,1,B00000IC8L,"I chose this Fields title for this review because Amazon seems to be employing it as a business practice. I dearly love the movie of that title and would like to add it to my DVD library. So I entered it into the ""search"" field and clicked on ""go."" I was delighted...at first...to see this collection pop up and I 1-click ordered it immediately. Then I discovered the movie is not included; the set is merely the same old collection of shorts that have been issued and reissued over and over by other companies. I tried to cancel the order but was informed that it was already being processed and could not be cancelled or changed. It arrived and I returned it immediately.

Maybe some day NEVER GIVE A SUCKER AN EVEN BREAK will become available (hopefully issued in the quality restoration it well deserves). But don't let Amazon sucker you into buying this set if it's the movie you're after. We deserve an even break!",1163635200,8,920,4.542168674698795
7910166,1,B00000IC8L,"I have an old 80s VHS of this from a budget label that cost me $4 back in the day.  And it still looks better.  Heads get cut off, scratches galore.  And it sounded better--Madacy should've added subtitles to ""The Pharmacist.""  Many of the shorts can't even track the audio; people talk a beat before their mouths move.

I didn't get my money's worth, and I paid $6!",1101254400,17,366,4.323529411764706
7910167,1,B00000IC8L,"W. C. Fields's short comedies of 1932-33, produced by Mack Sennett, offer some of this great comedian's best work. However, this particular DVD edition treats Mr. Fields (and the purchaser) quite shabbily. The sound is not always synchronized with the picture, the image is often gray, and in at least one instance the film seems to be copied from a VHS tape recorded at the slowest speed. Just plain bad; don't throw your money away (we did, and we also threw the discs away).",1077840000,23,477,4.690476190476191
7910168,1,B00000IC8L,"Hmmmm....
If it's from Madacy, you will be MAD when you SEE what you paid for.
Before transferring a movie to video, these people would put a pristine print through a blender just to make sure their standards don't deviate.
Madacy=Garbage
This is one of those DVD's that doesn't deserve one star but it's as low as I could go.",1076716800,23,326,4.45
7910169,1,B00000IC8L,"I have to make this very clear: I can think of very few DVDs Madacy has produced that were good (or even mediocre). This, however, is probably the worst I've seen. The company has spat upon the great comedian's grave. Several public domain shorts have been slapped on this DVD with terrible picture and sound that is downright disgraceful. In fact, this is the worst sound I've even heard on a DVD. There are also the traditionally stinky Madacy extras (Biography, Trivia, Quotes, Filmography).
Don't be fooled by the label at the back of the box (""a must for collectors and fans of this comedy genius""). A very nice looking edition has been released by Criterion. Get it.",1046995200,14,672,4.703389830508475
7910170,2,B00000IC8L,"The six short subjects on this double dvd set represent, I am led to believe, the total short subject output of the great W.C. Fields. I did not expect a crystal clear video image, as these items are about 70 yrs old, although overall the quality is not that bad. Similarly, the audio track, while a bit ""crackly"" at times, was quite acceptable. What did make me threaten the life span of the TV, player and disc however, was the lack of sinc between the video and audio tracks. It is rather off putting to find a second or so difference between what you see ""being said"", and what you actually hear. You feel you are watching a poorly dubbed foreign film. The comedy is still very appealing, but this attention to fine detail on the part of the makers of the set leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",1004054400,58,795,4.306666666666667
7910171,1,B00000IC8L,"I am so disappointed. I love these 6 films, and have seen them on 16MM film (superb quality) from Blackhawk films, and on so-so VHS. This DVD is the worst. I only watched ""The Pharmacist"" and the soundtrack is so badly recorded that you can't follow the dialogue.",984009600,18,263,4.5
