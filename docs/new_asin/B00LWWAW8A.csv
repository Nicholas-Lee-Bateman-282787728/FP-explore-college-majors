6508994,1,B00LWWAW8A,"If I could give this zero stars, that would be the rating this deserves. I've always been a huge fan of public media but this episode of Nova is clearly as biased and one sided as it could be. Very disappointed in the lack of objectivity and the lack of presenting this painfully controversial topic from all angles, not just the angle of those who financially benefit from the ""recommended"" vaccine schedule. Shame on PBS.",1434067200,14,423,4.653333333333333

6508996,5,B00LWWAW8A,"This is a good film for starting classroom discussions. It debunks the usual anti-vaccination  theories and explains herd immunity and risk very clearly. I like the history, which is forthright about vaccine failures of the past and how self-correction works in science. The science background is very simple and would work at the high school as well as the college classroom level.",1430352000,6,382,5.161290322580645

""Our lives are linked as never before, connected every day in a thousand unseen ways.  But sometimes these connections can pose an invisible threat if the object we touch or the air we share carries a dangerous germ.

Diseases largely unseen for a generation are returning.  Today, children are getting sick and dying from preventable diseases as nervous parents skip their children's shots.  In a world of often conflicting information, parents are seeking what's best for their families while doctors worry about saving lives.""

The above comes from the introduction of this exceptionally informative documentary.

The chapters for this program are:

(1) The invisible threat
(2) Measles outbreak
(3) History of vaccines
(4) Herd immunity
(5) Dravet syndrome
(6) Polio
(7) Science of autism
(8) HPV (human papilloma virus)
(9) Weighing risk

This documentary does a good job of explaining the science behind vaccines--why they work, how they work, and how we decide to vaccinate or not.  What intrigued me is that it also examines the risks of vaccines and how they are blamed for causing harm when there's no scientific proof.

Brief comments are made by experts, parents, and even those seriously affected by vaccines.  The experts come from such institutions as:

(1) The Royal Children's Hospital
(2) New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
(3) London School of Medicine and Tropical Medicine
(4) Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
(5) University of Melbourne (which has a world-renowned immunologist on its faculty)
(6) Autism Science Foundation
(7) School of Medicine, UCLA

The only problem I had with this program is that it does not mention the ingredients (medicinal and non-medicinal) that compose vaccines generally.

Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2014) has three extras.  I found them all interesting.

In conclusion, this is quite an informative documentary that explains a controversial topic--vaccinations.

8668629,1,B00LWWAW8A,"A fairly biased piece.  I would tend to call it propaganda, using the old (pre-Bernays) meaning of the term, to promote a point of view.  It's not a dispassionate review of the science, but rather another polarized piece that deliberately only tells one side of the story.  What we as concerned consumers and parents want is something that looks objectively and dispassionately at the entire story.  That is what one would usually expect from NOVA, but sad to say this is not typical NOVA.  It seems likely that those who are heavily invested in vaccines, either due to professional affiliations, ego, money ties, or roles in the medical and/or pharmaceutical establishment perspective were the sources for this.  That holy grail, a truly objective look at things, will immediately stand out since there are so few of them...and clearly this isn't one of them.",1485043200,5,860,4.979020979020979
