When she finally gets him to marry her, she tries to be a loving wife but finds his business is his life and he actually has no room for a woman. This is a pleasant romantic comedy with good acting and a story that moves quickly. Richards daughter from his previous marriage is a talented actress stealing the scenes shes in.
