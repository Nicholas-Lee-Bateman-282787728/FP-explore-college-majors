8498681,5,B006IHBM88,"Whether your a beginner or a professional Skeet shooter, there a ""Gold Nuggets"" contained within this DVD that will make you a better shooter. Paul takes you on a tour of all eight stations and speaks to issues that begin from even prior to stepping onto the station, to foot position, break point, hold point, look point, soft focus, hard focus, starting your gun only when you see the target flash and using your legs and hips to drive to the target by matching gun speed with target speed through the execution of the shot. Our game requires good vision, good hand and eye coordination but that in and of itself will not bring success. Developing proper habits, developing a good pre-shot routine and lastly having the proper shot plan are all topics that Paul covers in this DVD. If you want your scores to improve and for the game to ""slow down"" for you, Paul Giambrone's the instructor that will help do that for you. Check out his bio, the list of honors and accomplishments in his life as a young Skeet professional, they are incredible! His method of instruction and mannerism are such that he successfully imparts his knowledge to all levels of shooters and you can't help but increase your performance and scores when applying his techniques and procedures. Good luck and ""Shoot Straight.""",1503878400,,1300,4.7312775330396475

8498683,3,B006IHBM88,"I bought this DVD as a followup to the other instructional DVD I have (Bender) and it is a good basic learning tool, but not great. I didn't like the fact that Paul always was looking elsewhere, instead of directly into the camera. I like eye contact and expect it from professionals, but it just wasn't there.
All in all this is a good DVD, but I think Paul could make it better, maybe in a 2nd edition.
thanks",1387756800,,411,4.215189873417722

8498685,4,B006IHBM88,Very good fundamentals and gave me something to work on but very basic with not a lot of specific skills at each station.,1364169600,,121,4.304347826086956
8498686,5,B006IHBM88,"This is a great DVD. I'm very new to skeet and had had some lessons, but they didn't present a comprehensive approach to skeet as Paul does. He makes very clear the importance and approach to the fundamentals - stance, gun fit, gun mount - and then proceeds, station by station, to explain foot position, hold point, look point, break point, etc. But it's not done dryly. Paul speaks clearly and succinctly about skeet and clearly loves shooting and teaching. I'd strongly recommend this DVD. Based on my appreciation of the lessons here, I took a few private lessons with Paul - he teaches clinics across the States - and they were wonderful. I'm a far better shooter because of it. Start with the DVD and apply the lessons carefully and mindfully and if you ever get the chance, get a lesson from Paul, too. You'll not regret it.",1353110400,3,831,4.583892617449664
