What impacked me was studen sensei episode I really enjoyed that one.

3841176,3,B0021R4IEE,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 15 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes one hundred and ninety-two through two hundred and five of Naruto.  The first disc contains four episodes, the second disc contains five episodes, and the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.  The set includes Ino being hired to pose as a princess to attract a prince, Lee opening his own dojo, Naruto, Hinata, and Kiba investigating a haunted castle, a group of brothers bent on revenge against Guy, a plot to destroy the Leaf Village, a clip show, and we find out some backstory for Kurenai.

The first extra is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of fifteen pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview of Naruto Uncut Box Set 16, which runs for about four minutes.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode one hundred and ninety-three.  For each storyboard, you can choose the see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.

Next in the extras menu is a selection labeled ""New From Viz Media.""  This link takes you to two advertisements for Shonen Jump Magazine, one Naruto page, and two pages featuring other Shonen Jump manga titles.  A link in the extras menu labeled as ""DVD Trailers"" takes you to a trailer for Naruto the Movie: Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom.  The final link in the extras menu is labeled as ""Game Trailers,"" and it has trailers for: Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3, Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm, Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2, Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2, and Naruto: The Broken Bond.

The episodes on this set were an enjoyable viewing experience, but we're still stuck with the cookie-cutter extras that are expected on the Naruto Uncut box sets.  With only one box left to go, I've given up hope that Viz Media would even bother to go to any kind of an effort to provide somewhat less predictable DVD extras.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then Naruto Uncut Box Set 15 would be a good addition to your DVD library.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1288051200,,2268,4.604477611940299
3841177,5,B0021R4IEE,"Moderately violent so parents should view before giving it to their children. The second to last of the first Naruto series, and as good as the rest. If you've gotten this far in the series, there's little I can write to make it sound better.",1284249600,,242,4.4
