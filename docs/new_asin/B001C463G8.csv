3503943,5,B001C463G8,saw it in VHS. a must for all jazz fans of the scene in Paris in the 1950's. There is even flamenco music shown in the movie as the guitarist in Paul Newmsn's band plays some flamenco. the movie shows a flamenco guitar master wasted by drugs. Great movie.

3503950,5,B001C463G8,"Martin Ritt, a versatile and creative director, collaborated with Paul Newman on some of his best performances, and I consider Paris Blues in that category. This is one of the finest films about music and musicians ever made, and it is so carefully executed it has ample time to deal with not one but two romantic stories. Duke Ellington wrote the score and conducts his orchestra but the peak scene in the film is an extended scene when Louis Armstrong as the Wild Man crashes into Paul Newman's club and one-on-one challenges each member of his band to counter his solo with theirs. It is simply one of the best musical events I've ever seen. I breathe to live classical music.  That will never change, but this film made me a listener to jazz. It's that carismatic!",1471564800,,768,4.605839416058394
3503951,4,B001C463G8,"I would say that you should buy PARIS BLUES BLURAY for the wonderful music and the breath-taking scenery of Paris.

The story is one of the first that had me wishing the two couples did NOT end up together which is odd because normally one wants to see ""love conquer all,"" but not in this movie.

Diahann Carroll and Joanne Woodward play ""Connie Lampson"" and ""Lillian Corning"" two American tourists vacationing in Paris when they run into Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier two musicians named ""Ram Bowen"" and ""Eddie Cook"" who work in a jazz nightclub. The two couples fall in love, but as the story progresses, one really starts to wish they would break up. Louis Armstrong has a bit part playing ""Wildman Moore"" and there's a wonderful scene where he comes into the jazz club with his band, and the whole thing turns into a big jam session.

This movie must have been very risqu back in 1961 because Woodward's character hits the sack with Newman's character about 7-hours after they first meet, which I know had to have raised some eyebrows back then.

Anyway, I only give 4-stars because the only special is a trailer that has audio issues. It would've been nice to have some featurettes about the music, which was done by Duke Ellington, or the filming on location in Paris, beautiful location shots,  because I would've liked to know more about these behind-the-scenes nuggets.

3503957,4,B001C463G8,"Shot on location in Paris, the film features a quartet of beautiful actors at the top of their game.  With the exception of Diahann Carroll who was still in her 20s, the other 3 leads were in their 30s and had already won film awards.  Paul Newman plays Ram Bowen, a trombone-playing jazz musician who hopes to become a great song-writer as well.  He leads a band which includes tenor-sax man Eddie Cook (Sidney Poitier) who also handles the arrangements.

The rest of the band is comprised of locals including Gypsy Devigne (Serge Reggiani), a coke-addicted guitarist.  Hes part of a secondary plot involving Ram trying to get Gypsy clean.  The primary story has Lillian (Joanne Woodward & Newmans wife of 3 years) and Connie (Carroll) coming to Paris for a two-week vacation.  Ram is heading to the train station to deliver a musical score to world-renowned jazz musician Wild Man Moore (Louis Armstrong).  He bumps into Connie who is struggling with the language barrier communicating with a porter.  Ram interprets and flirts.  Hmm, 1961 and a white man is attracted to a black woman.  Must be Paris.  And that theme runs throughout the film, if in subtle ways which Ill get to.  Ram invites Connie to his club.  She demurs but then Lillian shows up, having gone for a porter.  Lillian lights up immediately, even as Ram continues to flirt with Connie.  Lillian talks Connie into going to the club that night.

One of the nice things about the film is the location shoot.  The club has that underground, claustrophobic feel, perfect for the musical environment.  And certainly, the club is jammed with the ladies all aflutter with hunky Ram and Eddie up front.  The camera takes its time in these scenes focusing on the audience faces.  While the guys are all seemingly into the music, the ladies all have a slight smile.  Rams romantic relationship with the club owner Marie (Barbara Laage) is obviously one of convenience.  When Connie seems more interested in Eddie after the club closes, Lillian makes a bee-line for Ram.  Resistant at first, Ram and Lillian go their separate ways, eventually finding their way back to Rams apartment.

Eddie and Connie are getting friendly as well, but Eddie wants no part of returning to America and his second class citizenship.  As he says, the French don't care what color you are, its the music that counts.  And clearly, director Martin Ritt (Norma Rae) wants to make that point.  Still, America is home for Connie.  It is where her family is and she believes the times are changing.  Ram and Lillian are going through a similar conflict.  Ram wants to stay in Paris.  The music is his thing, and he must get his music published.  He cant be confined in America especially when Lillian tells him a bit about her situation back home.  So will the guys go with the gals?  Thats the story.

Throughout the film, Ritt provides plenty of music, all of which is extraordinary, especially the scene when Moore leads his troupe into Rams club.  The actual trombone playing behind Newman was done by Murray McEachern and Poitiers sax was performed by Paul Gonsalves.  The actors, especially Newman, seemed very comfortable with their playing.  The film is shot in black and white which certainly works with the mostly night shoots and looks terrific in high definition.  The music is great.  The film is very good.

The Blu Ray treatment is an upgrade from the DVD, although it is far from perfect.  The transfer includes a video resolution of 1080p and an aspect ratio of 1.67:1 vs. the original 1.85:1.  The film looks good but there are a couple scenes that are problematic.  In a scene near the end featuring Ram and Lillian in close up they appear very steady but the backdrop is a bit jittery.  The detail is excellent and the blacks and grays are well defined.  Film grain is evident but not overwhelming.  The audio features a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 Mono track.  It sounds fine but you might want to switch on your Dolby Surround mode to beef things up.  There is only one extra, a trailer.",1455926400,,4039,4.716332378223496

3503973,4,B001C463G8,"You don't have to be a jazz lover to enjoy ""Paris Blues""(1961), Martin Ritt's underrated film of two expatriate jazz musicians(played by Paul Newman and Sidney Poiter) who both find the freedom of ""the City of Lights"" more exciting and accepting for serious musicians than America. It's that freedom and racial tolerance that causes conflicts for both men when they meet two American girls(Joanne Woodward and Diahann Carroll) who they end up falling in love with during an intense two week period. That's about all I will say about the plot. However, music is the main theme and love of the film and that original American art form known as Jazz is front and center. Ritt constructs the film like a jazz composition which he slowly builds the events around to great effect. Filmed entirely in Paris, ""Paris Blues"" looks excellent on Blu-ray. Originally released by United Artists, MGM(which now owns all UA films) has provided an exceptional print of ""Paris Blues"" to Kino Lorber as part of their new Studio Classics releases. Although a few scenes appear soft with visible grain, for the most part the video picture is nearly pristine(Bitrate:26.99). Paris in the early Sixties has never looked better and all the credit should be given to cinematographer Christian Matras for not only capturing the city's famous landmarks but the gritty confines of the tiny jazz clubs(actually studio sets) where a lot of the film takes place. This new Blu-ray from Kino brings out the smallest details and this is especially apparent in the performances of the lead actors who are excellent in some of their early film roles. The great Louis Armstrong even has a role as ""Wild Man Moore"" and he nearly steals the picture. Blacks, whites and grays look very nice even during the many night scenes which are very clear and free of any film elements. There are no vertical lines, damaged frames and only a few of those (blink and you'll miss them) white specks. As impressive as the video is, the Audio is even better with Duke Ellington's music being loud and clear. Although it was a small and independent film and was overshadowed by Newman's ""The Hustler"" which was released the same year, ""Paris Blues"" holds up well after 50 years and hopefully will be rediscovered. ""Paris Blues"" is 98 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.66.1) and is in English only. The only special feature is the Original Trailer. During his career, Martin Ritt's best films dealt with race relations(""The Great White Hope"" , ""Conrack"") union issues(""The Molly Maguires"" & ""Norma Rae"") and the Cold War(""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"") themes that may not have been popular at the time but have stood the test of time. ""Paris Blues"" is one of his best films and now with this excellent new Blu-ray transfer from Kino hopefully will get another look.",1406937600,17,2805,4.8580375782881005
3503974,5,B001C463G8,"I remember watching this movie as a young woman in the early 60's when it was a revelation for me that in places like Paris, France, race was not an issue like it so sadly was here in the USA.  I just now enjoyed watching it once again on a local TV station specializing in old films and TV shows.  Something that went completely unnoticed by me in the 60's was the gay couple nonchalantly enjoying the show in the nightclub scene.  Apparently that was yet another nonissue there in Paris that was still totally taboo here in the USA of the early 60's.  I really want a copy of this for myself not only as a reminder of cultural differences of now and then, but the great performances by young actors (and Louis Armstrong) who later became icons because of their immense talent.",1400976000,13,778,4.381944444444445

Romance scenes were not done with blacks in those days but this was the immaculate  exception.  He and Diahann Carroll were in love in real life as well, at the time.  It shows every times his smoldering looks, touches and kisses were filmed.  Their romance continued for years, before & after they made this film.  But it finally ended because he could not bring himself to divorce Juanita and leave his children.

Paul and Joanne Woodward were married at the time and I found his character cold, bitter and unlikable but he played it to the hilt. However, I never understood the hostility he displayed.  He even learned to play the trombone to make this movie.
He and Poitier lived in Paris and loved the freedom regarding their music and the racial issues in America.  But Paul chooses his love of composing and playing over love.  I have no idea why this movie isn't available most anywhere?  As usual, Joanne Woodward turns in a spectacular performance.  She can display emotion better than almost any actress I have ever seen.

Joanne Woodward and Diane Carroll were sophisticated women that invited a blend of romance and conflict.

Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

Im sure there are people who will like watching Paris Blues. Paul Newman fans, or Sidney Poitier fans, or those who like Paris or jazz music, but even though Im 2 for 4, I found too many problems with the movie to enjoy it.

First of all, even though Paul Newman made a career out of playing the bad boy, he didn't really pull it off this time around. He and Sidney are nightlife jazz musicians. They are supposed to be seedy, bad quality, different-dame-a-night swingers. Then why did both of them look incredibly clean cut, with never a hair out of place? I just didn't buy it when theyd say, Can you dig it? It felt like they were in a movie parodying the 1960s and they didn't know what they were talking about.

Second, Joanne Woodward and Diahann Carroll play girlfriends on a two-week Paris vacation. Theyre not even off the train when Paul hits on Diahann, completely ignoring Joanne, who incidentally looks prettier than she usually does. Joanne is taken with him, so they go the low-life dive nightclub where he works and listen to him play. Once again, Paul hits on Diahann and is incredibly rude to Joanne. He pushes her away repeatedly and tells her to find someone else for what she wants. But Joanne wants to be an incredibly stupid woman. Seriously, whats her problem? She just arrived in Paris! There are nightclubs and seedy musicians everywherewhats so special about Paul Newman? Hes downright mean to her constantly. She knows where he stands. But hes the one for her?

Both romances are quite stupid. Diahann and Sidney are awkward at best; its as if they used one take to say their lines in the worst, most comical way possible, and thats the take the director kept. Joanne and Paul are mismatched; sometimes star-crossed lovers are a good plot point, but in Paris Blues its just badly written. Throughout the entire movie, shes incredibly stupid, but she comes up with spur-the-moment zingers that don't fit her character.

I told you from the beginning, Im not on the market, Paul says. With a look thats supposed to be smoldering, but just comes across as confused, Joanne says, I wasn't shopping, before leaving the room. I wasn't amused.",1499644800,,2217,4.659846547314578
