8095077,2,B000C1VAL0,"The title on the DVD case of this product is ""Step By Step Drawing"".  It covers the important topics in a introductory drawing course.  However, the presentations are too brief.  This DVD won't help the typical adult student and it certainly won't teach children.

Who would find any use for this product?  Imagine a person who has studied drawing, but not taught it.  Suppose this person finds a job as a drawing teacher and must organize lesson plans for an introductory course.  This DVD would be very helpful.  The typical ten minute segment on this DVD can be used as a basis for a two hour class.  The sequence of topics is well organized.  (The lessons on composition and on how to show depth contain important information, which is understandable by kids but often omitted from kid's classes.)

Another customer would be someone with no experience in drawing who contemplates taking a drawing class.  ""Step By Step Drawing"" would give them a quick preview of what to expect.  It wouldn't be a substitute for actually taking the class.

The presenter on ""Step By Step Drawing"", Gretchen Sankey, speaks clearly and follows a carefully written script.  (There is some faint piano music in the background throughout the entire DVD, which might make it useful as a sleep aid.)  The subjects of the drawings are still life material:  hats, baskets and so forth.  There is no instruction about anatomy, nothing about how to draw eyes, noses etc.  There are no nude models, no human figures at all, everything is perfectly suitable for children.  The DVD is professionally produced and the video is clear.

The design of the camera work is flawed.  Typically it alternates between a view of some objects and Gretchen's drawing of them.  Our view of the objects has no resemblance to her drawing.  It is taken from a different angle.

The drawings are done mostly in charcoal on (I estimate) 18"" x 24"" paper set on an easel.  Gretchen's drawings are not detailed, but they do show a convincing representation of the outline the objects in the scene and there is a hint of the highlighting and shading that would be used to refine them.  Most often, the lesson begins with the drawing already done.  She adds or modifies things about the drawing to make her point.

It is certainly possible to convey a verbal understanding of most topics without showing a drawing being drawn, but the student doesn't get any reinforcement of previous lessons.  For example, the first lesson teaches that we can  establish the initial location of the objects in a picture by using ""gesture drawing"".  When students don't see drawings done from scratch in the rest of the course,  the use of the initial ""gesture drawing"" is apt to slip from their minds.

As an example of adequate ""step by step"" teaching vs what is on this DVD, consider the topic of using vertical and horizontal sight lines.  Artists concerned with realism visualize vertical and horizontal lines on a scene (perhaps with the aid of pencil or plumb line) and they compare the alignment of objects in the scene with the alignment of the objects in their drawing.  Most teachers advise that students first draw things and then use lines to check and make corrections.  A adequate method of presenting this on a DVD would be to show a still life and show a drawing of it (taken from the same view) with some alignment errors.  Then the DVD should either show the artists view of a pencil or plumb line as alignment is checked or it should use superimposed computer generated lines to demonstrate this.  The lesson should show the corrections being made on the drawing.

Equally important as teaching the concept of sight lines is that students see the instructor using sight lines  on every drawing.  The only way to emphasize the importance and utility of a technique is to use it repeatedly.  ( Otherwise it falls into the category of  ""We covered it in class, but it's not going to be on the final exam"".)

The lessons on vertical sight lines in ""Step By Step Drawing"" don't show us the view of the still life that is represented in the drawing.  Gretchen begins with a drawing that (we assume) doesn't have alignment errors.  She draws some vertical lines and then draws on top of her drawing to show how an object could have been put in the wrong place.  In subsequent lessons, we don't see drawings done from scratch, consequently we don't see sight lines used to correct errors.

No consumer in their right mind would take the titles of non-fiction DVDs seriously, but one must guess the intent of material.  Although I could rate this DVD as five stars out of five as course outline for soon-to-be employed inexperienced art teachers, I think the intent of the DVD was to teach a drawing course to beginners.  I rate it as two stars out of five to indicate that it is inadequate for that purpose.",1271894400,7,4852,4.703087885985748
8095078,5,B000C1VAL0,"I love this video, such clear explanations for overall drawing techniques.  I have various drawing books and dvd's.  This one has been the most helpful.  Not good for kids but, great for teens and adults.",1264982400,,204,4.771428571428571
8095079,2,B000C1VAL0,"I purchased this CD under the impression that it would be just right for a beginner like myself.  What I learned was a lot of drawing jargon. This is not a step-by-step for beginners.  The young lady does not demonstrate step-by-step (from fruitition to completion) but tells you more about drawing than showing you.  It would have been better as an audio lesson.  I am keeping it because after the CD I am now purchasing, I will better understand what she is trying to teach.",1201478400,5,476,4.564705882352941

8095081,2,B000C1VAL0,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. He wanted some instruction, as he really enjoys drawing. After watching this video I asked him what he thought, he reluctantly told me that it wasn't that great. He is 14 years old. He said that the instructor talked a lot more than using practictal drawing exercises.",1168300800,9,306,4.685185185185185
