8330630,5,B001OI36SA,"This DVD includes a new technique for creating unique rag rugs from fabric. If you want the basic instructions for creating Crochet Rag Rugs, I highly recommend the Basic Crochet Rag Rug Instructional DVD.

However if you want another DVD for learning a new technique and give your rag rugs a beautiful flair, learn how to make these gorgeous plushy rugs with this DVD.

I greatly enjoyed these DVD's. It was as if grandma was sitting in my living room teaching me how to create beautiful rugs. I wish there were more DVD's to buy from this author.

Shag Rag Rugs get a lot of attention at craft fairs do to their uniqueness and softness. If you are looking for a craft to provide you with some additional money, creating rag rugs is a great craft to learn. This DVD will show you how.

The only problem with creating Shag Rag Rugs for craft fairs is they are so beautiful when they are done you might be tempted to keep them!

Shag Rag Rugs make a beautiful addition to the home. These rugs are a great way to do some home decorating on a budget. Shag Rag Rugs are easy and inexpensive to make and will add a unique touch to your home decor. You will get lots of compliments when you display these rugs especially when people learn you made them!",1300838400,,1247,4.357758620689655
8330631,5,B001OI36SA,This video is a lot of fun. The instructions are clear and the instructor shows the stitches clearly. I like that she goes slowly and lets me work with her. These rugs are thick and plushy. Love them and they sell well at craft shows.,1236124800,,234,4.222222222222222
