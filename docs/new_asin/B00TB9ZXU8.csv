8701212,5,B00TB9ZXU8,"Spoiler ahead.
I first saw this movie in the nineties and loved the wacky mix of fun one-liners, colorful characters, curious, if short, discussions, and barely-there murders. I rewatched the movie a few days ago and boy is this movie relevant now! Though the technology in the movie has not aged well, the psychological core of it has persisted and is very relevant now. I live this movie, though it's a guilty pleasure as there is a ton if ridiculous moments there.",1528588800,,467,4.7073170731707314
8701213,5,B00TB9ZXU8,"In the heartland of Iowa, five grad school liberals (Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner and Courtney B. Vance) share a house, a left-wing outlook, and Sunday suppers filled with conversation and social criticism. Allow me to say that aside from the cast which is amazing and they all do a stunning job. Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner and Couertney B. Vance all from 1995. Besides this excellent cast you will see a nice little array of guest stars. The start is when our 5 friends and roommates have their usual dinner and receive a guest, Bill Paxton who challenges their beliefs and threatens them and they do something that starts them on a path. The wit is funny, the story is excellent and very entertaining. I wholeheartedly recommend this.",1511049600,,794,4.888888888888889

8701218,1,B00TB9ZXU8,"I actually received this as a gift, purchased from Target. However, just as with this version - it is manufactured on demand, which is stated. However, it is not the original widescreen version.

The movie was released to theaters in 1995 with a ratio of 1.85 : 1.

Sure, this copy fits your widescreen TV. But instead of being the original widescreen release, instead it's a crop of a format edited to originally fit a square screen. So - not only is the movie a pan and scan version, losing the portions first cropped from the sides of the screen, but to add insult to injury, that already cropped version was then cropped at the top and bottom to remake it into a widescreen. I know this because I already have the ""formatted to fit your screen"" video, then I just received this manufactured on demand version for Christmas. I appreciate the gift, but the giver could not have known how this movie had been edited.

I am exceedingly disappointed, and am hoping to prevent others who call this movie a favorite from certain disappointment as well.

I see there are some used versions available, not just here but under the product dated 1996. I would contact those sellers first to determine if their version is the original widescreen before you buy.

Also, this version does not have a dvd menu nor does it include subtitles.",1451347200,12,1329,4.614406779661017
