640791,3,6303414028,"This is a painful yet highly effective introduction to the world of incredibly bad movies.  The best tape out of these three is something that will make you say, ""Is this a movie??  It can't be.  No movie can be this bad.  This must be something else.""

But no, these are real movies.  It's just that you don't hear much about their theatrical release history, which makes sense, because they're so bad.

Let's start with oldest of these three movies, Glen or Glenda.  This is a movie that attempts to grab your attention with the first-ever sex change operation (which was a current event at that time) before it segways into a movie about transvestites.  Why a transvestite movie?  Because Ed Wood, the man responsible for the movie, was a transvestite himself.  He wanted people to understand why he was the way he was.  The movie does accomplish Wood's desire in a way, but it's so bad that going any more than halfway through the final print is darn near impossible.  The story just stops in the middle and random music and footage arise to combine in such a wrecthed manner that the audience is hypnotized to instantly press the nearest ""off"" button they can find.  So only half of what Ed Wood wanted to show actually comes across.

Fortunately, Ed's films do get better.  Bride of the Monster can actually be viewed all the way through, but just barely.  Not much happens in it.  I think it's supposed to be one of those movies that shows us how taking science too far is ultimately destructive.  Also, it seems to put a lot of emphasis on the unsurpassed danger of lying on top of a completely immobile fake octopus.

Plan 9 From Outer Space can actually be watched more than once.  That doesn't mean it's good, but it's actually not PAINFUL painful like the others.  It's just mildly painful.  It takes the destructive science theme from Bride of the Monster and brings it a step further, saying man will destroy the universe by finding a way to explode rays of light.  The ""Plan 9"" of the title is actually an attempt by outer space aliens to stop man before this explosive carnage happens.  But all that doesn't seem to grab your attention when Ed won't even bother doing a second take after a man nearly falls over trying to pick up a freaking newspaper.

I highly recommend this as a supplement to Tim Burton's 1994 biography of Ed Wood.  Why?  Because you actually get to see the REAL footage that Johnny Depp acts out in the Burton movie.  So this set of tapes is very educational, but gosh, the movies are ever so bad.",1168905600,2,2535,4.522026431718062
640792,5,6303414028,"Passport Video presents ""The Bela Lugosi Box - 15 Frightful Films"" (1942) --- (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Bla Lugosi was the stage name of actor Bla Ferenc Dezs' Blask (October 20, 1882 - August 16, 1956) --- Lugosi was born in Lugos, Hungary, at the time part of Austria-Hungary (now Lugoj, Romania), the youngest of four children of a baker --- best known for his portrayal of ""Dracula"" in the American Broadway stage production, and subsequent film, of Bram Stoker's classic vampire story.

Late in his life, he again received star billing in movies when filmmaker Edward D. Wood, Jr., a fan of Lugosi, found him living in obscurity and near-poverty and offered him roles in his films, such as ""GLEN OR GLENDA?"" (1953) (in which his role made no more sense than the rest of the movie) and as a Dr. Frankenstein-like mad scientist in ""BRIDE OF THE MONSTER"" (1955), during post-production of the latter, Lugosi entered treatment for his addiction, and the premier of the film was ostensibly intended to help pay for his treatment expenses. The extras on an early DVD release of ""PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE"" (1959) include an impromptu interview with Lugosi upon his exit from the treatment center, which provide some rare personal insights into the man --- this was one of Lugosi's most infamous roles was released after he was dead. Ed Wood (Director) features footage of Lugosi interspersed with a double --- Wood had taken a few minutes of silent footage of Lugosi, in his Dracula cape, for a planned vampire picture but was unable to find financing for the project --- Wood later conceived of Plan 9, Wood wrote the script to incorporate the Lugosi footage and hired his wife's chiropractor to double for Lugosi in additional shots --- notice however the ""double"" is thinner than Lugosi, and covers the lower half of his face with his cape in every shot --- Leonard Maltin (Famous Film Critic) was quoted - ""Lugosi died during production, and it shows.""

Lugosi died of a heart attack on August 16, 1956 while lying in bed in his Los Angeles home. He was 73 --- Bela Lugosi was buried wearing one of the many capes from the Dracula stageplay, as per the request of his son and fifth wife, in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California --- Contrary to popular belief, Lugosi never requested to be buried in his famous cloak; Bela Lugosi, Jr. has confirmed on numerous occasions that he and his mother, Lillian, arrived at their decision independently.

640794,1,6303414028,"I am a huge fan of the Tim Burton flick Ed Wood.  I couldn't wait to see the original Glen or Glenda.  Suffice to say this is the worst movie I've ever seen.  It was pure agony sitting through it.  I really wonder how critics can call Plan 9 from Outer Space the worst.  Apparently they haven't seen this one.  The only redeeming quality it has is Bela Lugosi screaming ""Pull the skrings!""  Bizarre to say the least.  Don't say you weren't warned!",1045094400,4,447,4.301204819277109
640795,5,6303414028,"This film offers a sensitive examination of the dilemmas, fears, and frustrations facing a heterosexual male transvestite on the eve of his marriage. Daniel Davis renders an Oscar-worthy performance in the roles of Glen/Glenda, and Dolores Fuller nicely compliments him as his lovely, intelligent bride-to-be Barbara. The story in brief: after Glen drops his beads to Barbara the couple consult a psychiatrist who suggests love as the most effective remedy for Glen's transvestitism. At film's end Barbara's love has worked miracles: Glen has discarded feathers, furs, and fluff to settle down to a normal colorless life with his wife. (Ah! ... but for how long we wonder? Will Glen indulge his passion for drag when the routines of marriage settle in? Kudos to Bela Lugosi in his demanding role as The Scientist and to 'Tommy' Haynes as Alan, a radiant lad who bravely undergoes painful surgeries in order to alter his sex. Sets and costumes are a credit to the production. A dream episode mid-film contains some questionable bondage footage; the viewer may opt to fast forward without losing any of the story's continuity. I enjoyed this film immensely ... but after playing it over and over at every available opportunity I began to wonder how many of my buddies and male co-workers are wearing nylons and satin undies under their Dickies.",1030320000,2,1342,5.04954954954955
640796,1,6303414028,"I viewed this movie out of curiosity after seeing Ed Wood and Plan 9 from Outer Space (Both of which I loved). The description of Glen or Glenda in the movie Ed Wood as a ""stink bomb"" is one of the understatements of the century. Viewing Glen or Glenda was so agonizing, so excruciating, I have to admit that I was unable to watch the whole thing. I do believe that I made it through nearly all of it. But it just seemed to go on and on and on. You know how like being tortured would cause minutes to seem like hours? Similarly, every minute of Glen or Glenda seemed like an eternity. Now,Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space is considered to be one of the worst films of all time, but you see, it's WONDERFULLY AWFUL. Glen or Glenda is just horribly awful. I am left with no desire to ever see (or attempt  to see) this movie again. I feel strongly that Glen or Glenda is the absolutly most horrible film experience of my life. Nothing else even comes close...
I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to approximate the experience of delirium tremens.",1018051200,9,1058,4.29
640797,2,6303414028,"I am a fan of 'bad' movies like the one's Wood produced, but this movie is just painful to watch. Clocking in at a little over an hour it feel's like three. Bela Lagosi is just perposturous and Wood, in the title role, is no better. This was supposed to be his outing himself movie but it is just plain stupid. When Bela looks down on a crowded street and say's, with a stright face, ""People, always going somewhere"" you would be wise to just turn the film off. Woods first, and worst film Glen/Glenda is for the hardcore Ed Wood fans. Other's avoid this like the plauge.......",1016841600,,577,4.351851851851852
640798,1,6303414028,"PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, Ed Wood's ""epic"" science fiction movie may have been voted the Golden Turkey Award for the worst movie ever made, but obviously they overlooked GLEN OR GLENDA, Ed's semiautobiographical true confession of the transvestite life. It's unendurable.
The most horrifying thing about this film is that, watching it, you can't help but be convinced that Ed was setting out to make a sensitive and sympathetic pseudodocumentary about cross dressers.
Given Ed's legendary ineptitude behind the camera, the results are a boring, laughable, and painful mishmash of irrelevant stock footage, repetitious dialogue, sorta-Freudian fantasy sequences of fat women in bad lingerie spanking each other, serious social commentary, and utterly illogical horror movie filler.
Bela Lugosi stars in this thing. He plays someone (God, or the devil, or Dr. Frankenstein, or maybe just himself), and Ed and his real-life fiancee play Glen and Barbara, ""a lovely intelligent girl"" as the film reminds us at least nine times.
The movie only runs 60 minutes, but you'd never know it. Watching this film is more painful than root canal, and more exhausting than transcribing the ""Collected Speeches of J. Fred Muggs."" This one hour movie lasted at least a month of my life, I swear, and I watched the whole thing in one sitting.
This could be a really hot film, if somebody'd put a match to the 35 mm print. Unless you are a diehard Ed Wood enthusiast ..., or a masochist with time on his hands, give this one a miss...unless, like rubbernecking a car accident, you just can't help yourself!",1015027200,5,1586,5.011363636363637
640799,5,6303414028,"Michael Medved's ""Fifty Worst Movies Of All Time"" turned out to be a mixed blessing for the late Ed Wood.  On one hand Medved's self-serving book of nonsense inspired viewers to examine films they might otherwise have avoided, thus reviving the non-career of one of Hollywoods many never-made-its; on the other, the editorial preconception of ""so bad it's good"" tainted many a movie goer from watching these films with anything close to an impartial eye.
I guess it's no surprise then, that nice-guy Eddie is frequently relegated to the ""Worst Director In History"" list.  Too bad, because I always thought ""Gone With The Wind"" was a much harder watch than anything Ed Wood ever directed, and James Cameron and Cecil B Demille were far less imaginative or interesting.  Anyways, best known for ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"", Ed Wood (who's prior life experience included being one of the Marines to take Tarawa atoll in WWII) actually started his career with ""Glen Or Glenda"".
He never topped it.  It's bizarre montages (steel ingots, bison, and Bella Lugosi!), the non-acting by the water-cooler, the eccentric voice-over...  This is the film Welles might have made... er, if he'd been Ed Wood!  And drunk!  And stoned!  And had sniffed gas from he time he was six!
But seriously, it's like a David Lynch dream sequence, or a Guy Maddin short &#8211; a film from some place films normally don't come from.  Think of it as ""Erasure Head"" for 1953, ""Archangel"" as a public service announcement, an ""Une Chein Andolou"" for the masses!
Any (one) can make ""Plan Nine.."" (in fact some might argue that in ""The Abyss"" special edition James Cameron has), but not ""Glen Or Glenda"".  ""Glen Or Glenda"" comes from somewhere else.
Sure, for the rest of his career he made quirky ""diversions"".  But by accident or design, in ""Glen Or Glenda"" Ed Wood made a film that defies conventional analysis.  Don't confuse this with a ""bad movie"" or ""a movie-gone-bad"".

640800,3,6303414028,"Ed Wood's bizarre take on the world of cross-dressing and transvestites is one of the most revered (and reviled!) cult movies of all time.
GLEN OR GLENDA stars Wood himself (under the screen name Daniel Davis), as Glen, who has a secret fetish for angora sweaters and occasionally dons female clothes to become Glenda.
His fiance Barbara (Dolores Fuller) has no idea of his secret life, which is observed from afar by an all-powerful science god (Bela Lugosi), and a droll, sleep-inducing narrative by a psychiatrist.
There is also a bizarre dream sequence where Glen is tormented by plump women prancing around in lingerie, whipping and gagging other females and generally acting pretty weird.
However, Wood's most self-expressive and most controversial film is considered so bad that it's good.  GLEN OR GLENDA is a fascinating, off-the-wall cult classic.",996710400,6,857,5.2101449275362315
640959,3,6303414028,"If you've ever heard someone describe a film as being so bad it's good, there's a good chance they're talking about the ""masterpieces"" of the immortal Edward D. Wood, Jr. And if you want to see just how bad ""bad"" can get, watch ""Glen or Glenda."" It's so bad you'll alternate between uncontrollable laughter and mind-numbing, jaw-dropping amazement.
Bless him, his heart was in the right place, but his brain must have been orbiting Pluto. (Where on earth did he get the idea that wearing hats makes men bald, anyway?) Wildly incongruous montage sequences, dialogue (and acting) that wouldn't pass muster in a junior-high school Christmas pageant, and Bela Lugosi's somber ranting make this film a unique experience, if nothing else. Add to that an out-of-nowhere sadomasochistic dream sequence set to frenetic violin music, and you're off on a chaotic (and scary) journey through Ed Wood's mind. At times, the trip has the morbid appeal one gets from viewing a train wreck.
So why do I love this film? Well, being a transsexual, I have to look for sympathy where I can find it, and Wood is indeed sympathetic in his own ham-fisted way. I could have done without the loopy psychoanalysis (featuring the most implausible movie shrink in history). Did Wood, a crossdresser himself, really think that the love of a good woman was all someone like him needed, or was he simply trying to make this mess more palatable to 1953 audiences? I get the feeling even HE wasn't sure.
An interesting side note--Wood was ""inspired"" to produce his magnum opus at the urging of grade-Z movie schlockmeister George Weiss, who wanted to cash in on Christine Jorgenson's recent sex change (but couldn't get Jorgenson to appear). Not to be outdone, Wood replaces Christine's story with the story of Glen, a crossdresser about to be married, living in terror of what his fiancee might think if she knew his secret. Before we even get to this part of the story, we are treated to lengthy narration on the tightness and roughness of men's clothing. (Which makes me wonder how much time Wood really spent in women's clothes--he apparently never wore a bra for any length of time). In what was obviously a move to keep Weiss from strangling him, Wood does devote the last ten minutes or so of the film to an actual transsexual, (I think?) Alan/Ann. Miraculously, this is probably the most coherent part of the entire film, and does indeed give the audience a glimpse of what a transsexual must go through (it hasn't gotten that much easier in half a century).
Still, looking at this film, I'm not sure if it actually helped transgendered people--or set us back a decade or two.",991094400,17,2650,4.788209606986899

640961,3,6303414028,"""Glen or Glenda"" aims to make people aware of the anguish  transvestites suffer as they try to find acceptance. It is a serious, powerful, thought-provoking  drama. Or at least, that was the idea. As things turned out, Ed Wood's opus became one of the worst films ever made.
It's hard to describe a film like this. Basically it tells the story of a young man called Glen who likes the feel of women's clothes. Should he tell his fiance? While Glen is trying to decide, we see Bela Lugosi talk about nothing that makes any sense, listen to narration that is priceless, and watch a heap of stock footage interspersed with dream sequences.
I wonder if the director who remade ""Psycho""(another film with a transvestite) had seen this. He also included unrelated footage (for when the murders took place): storm clouds for the first victim and a buffalo for the second. It's quite a coincidence because Ed Wood also used buffalo footage.
This film is bad. But it's worth seeing for the performance delivered by Delores Fuller, and the sentimental music as we reach the scene where Glen ""reveals all"" to his fiance. The film alternates between boredom and hilarity. There are parts where the film is just plain dull. But seeing the devil's face was hysterical.
""Glen or Glenda"" is not as fun as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", but if you are a devoted fan of Ed Wood, you won't want to miss this.",974505600,8,1385,4.626016260162602

If you have seen Un Chien Andalou or have some familiarity with Salvador Dali, a lot of the weirdness in the film will make sense to you (well, maybe not sense, but you'll understand why it's there).  If you view this as a piece of surrealism you'll have a lot higher regard for it, and you'll wonder why Ed Wood didn't receive better regard from the critics.  This is his best film in my opinion.  Too bad Salvador Dali and Ed Wood never hooked up in real life -- Dali enjoyed people who were sexually ambiguous, and Ed Wood certainly delivered there.",969840000,,645,4.262295081967213

As an aspiring actor it is heartwarming to find that life goes on at so many levels of competence that  even a dead gerbil could make SOME kind of career in the movies. What do we  like so much about old bad movies? It's a kind of escapism to watch them.  This film is great fun, but not just to laugh AT, but because it's so  amateurish it's actually comforting - though Glen's dream sequence in the  second half of the movie is nothing short of incredible. Zombie-walking was  one of his trademarks, and you see it a lot throughout the dream sequence.  There is a cumbersome and didactic narrative, lots of stock footage with  dialogue dubbed over, the worst acting I've seen almost anywhere -  especially from Miss Fuller, Bela Lugosi in ther just for the sake of it,  and on top of that the whole thing has such a patchy and imbalanced  structure that it's almost impossible to make sense of it as a whole.

Set aside bad acting, the movie is very sincere, very warm and you have to agree it is original! It is kind of sad to see how poor Ed was so the same water dispenser was used in another movie ""The bride of the monster"". But then again, what can you expect if you are an independent filmmaker working way off the beaten trail and trying to communicate your vision however bizarre, incoherent and plain weird it is. Nevertheless I would choose this movie over ""Eclipse"" in a heartbeat.
Do not also forget that it was made in 50s! I highly doubt that even modern days Hollywood would even dare to touch this topic.
Finally as an avid David Lynch fan I'd like to remind you that nobody tries to say anything bad about David's movies anymore. I mean, have you seen ""Mulholland Drive""? Bela's rambling do not look weird at all! I also found it very interesting that Ed's ""demon"" looks very much the same as the horrendous homeless person in ""Mulholland Drive"".
So here is my verdict: Ed Woods was a true independent artist who was very poor, perhaps ahead of his time yet a kind soul and brave and sincere director.

Infamous movie that began Ed Wood's reign as ""worst director of all time"" is an autobiographic semi-documentary on transvestism (now called ""crossdressing""). Wood as Glen also boldly appears in his second self, here named Glenda. Fuller, playing girlfriend Barbara, is a really bad actress. Bela's ""puppy dog's tails"" speech and later ""Pull da string! Pull da string!"" narration over a superimposed buffalo herd are unforgettable. An extended sequence of wordless action with music track perhaps reveals the director's other idiosyncracies.

Here, as Glen and Barbara get married, a sports jacketed Satan nods his approval. The next curious segment is of an hourglass shaped stripper then a supine woman being whipped and bound by another girl. The previously tied up girl freely writhes on a couch in a sheer negligee, clearly aroused. A man enters and forces himself upon her; at first she resists but then kisses him back. All this as Lugosi watches with raised brows.

The sequence continues: a small crowd points accusingly at Glen and surround him as the devil urges them forward. He's now Glenda when they back away. Barbara slowly approaches but suddenly turns into Satan. Glenda recoils. An amused Barbara reappears in an overturned chair; she rises and mocks Glenda. A montage of laughers, plus their hands and grinning faces, segues to the devil repeating Lugosi's ""Beware"" soliloquy.

All this is preface to Glen's decision to reveal his dark secret to Barbara. Will she laugh for real and make Glen's nightmare a reality? Will she end their engagement? Before we find out, another case is presented plus there's lots more stock footage to use up! (Hint: Wood's story incorrectly concludes that love cures CDers.)",1276214400,,1839,5.181818181818182
