The opening credit guitar and harmonica combo is supposed to sound rustic but left me expecting a Tom Jones style lounge act to appear.  Twenty minutes later this is reinforced with a strange vocal bit.  The music arranger should be shaved and sterilized.",1356566400,,465,6.716666666666667
633129,3,6303386334,"I have seen Santee in the movie theatre and later on videotape. Though the other reviews are excellent, I understand that their disappointment reflects the very high level of Glenn Ford Westerns. I just went through the list which amazes me. This may me the worst Glenn Ford Western, but it is still better than many films that in Amazon pages get five stars. Ford is good here like always. The story may have some holes, but this is still an O.K. western.",1274572800,5,456,4.506024096385542
633130,2,6303386334,"Santee was Glenn Ford's last starring role in a major motion picture Western, and it is better to remember after watching it that he will always be known as one of the all-time great Western stars.

In Santee, Ford plays a hardbitten bounty hunter who kills the father of a young boy, who Santee takes home to raise as his own. You know that the boy, played by Michael Burns, wants to kill the man who killed his father, and you know that sooner or later, the boy will come to respect, and maybe even love Santee. You don't expect the boy to forgive so quickly. You also know that the boy will eventually have to help Santee round up some outlaws, but the usual excitement and enjoyment just doesn't payoff, even with an ending that is more poignant, and more interesting than a lot of older or modern westerns.

For Ford's sake, you wish that the cliches weren't so overwhelming. Ford does what he can with the role, which is more than a lot of other actors could, but Santee ends up being a pale imitation of many of Ford's other roles.",1119916800,18,1038,4.373056994818653
633131,2,6303386334,"Veteran actor Glenn Ford is bounty hunter in the 1973 movie SANTEE.  After killing the leader of an outlaw gang Santee takes in the man's son, Jody, who vows to kill Santee the first chance he gets.

  The first act begins with a delightful opening sequence, a little reminiscent of the `super posse' in BUTCH CASSIDY & THE SUNDANCE KID. Santee is seen from a distance and commented upon - who IS this guy, is he as good as they say he is, etc. It turns out he is indeed that good, and then some.  Santee is tough and terse and the bad guy is one wrong flinch away from death.

  The movie falls apart spectacularly in the second act.  Santee, for reasons unknown, guilt or distrust or whatever, keeps the kid close to him and semi-adopts him.  At least he gets the kid to agree not to do `it' at the ranch.  Domesticity can drive a stake through the toughest of action movies, and as soon as Santee and Jody arrive home this movie loses whatever chance it had.  For reasons never adequately explained, or even apparently noticed by director Gary Nelson, Jody forgives and forgets and becomes the son they never.... The rest of the film is a pastiche of half-baked, lesser tropes.  The education of a gunfighter.  Strapping them on one last time.  This movie lost me when it asked me to buy that an afternoon rounding up mustangs with Jay Silverheels would be enough to forget killing the man who shot your father.

 Old music fans might get a kick out of hearing The Raiders with Paul Revere sing the original theme ""Jody"" somewhere at the tag end of act one and reprise it at the end of the movie.

Not many movies begin with as much promise as SANTEE, fewer yet disappoint so thoroughly.",1094860800,8,1690,4.414239482200648

633351,2,6303386334,"A disappointing movie. The dialogue was atrocious and what were those horses doing inside the saloon, at the end of the movie? A classical, 1970's feel good movie that missed the target by a long shot, unless you like to suspend belief in some form of reality. I've never known a bounty hunter to chase even four badmen as if he could take them on, one against four. You take them one at a time, on your terms, not theirs? That's enough beating on a dead horse. I like Glenn Ford, but not in this one. And, as for Michael Burns, Good luck at Holyoke College. Acting as a child is a lot different from acting in an adult role. He was not believable. Good to see Jay Silverheels, again. A solid D plus!",1463270400,,700,4.231343283582089

633513,5,6303386334,"This movie was made when we Americans had greater moral strength and character.  Unlike a lot of movies today that rely on foul language and sexual promiscuity to embellish the plot,  ""Santee"" was a refreshing detour from the downward spiral of social permissiveness that has gained momentum in the last few decades.  The music was somewhat quaint, but telling on the time of production.  The story line was entertaining and the cast did a professional job of holding the attention of the viewer.  Although the  film contained violence, I believe it was an accurate depiction of some of the societal dilemmas of the time.  At the time of release, this movie may have been inappropriate for some viewers.  By today's standards, this film is easy to rate as family entertainment.

  I highly recommend this title.",1463097600,,811,4.933333333333334

The byplay between the two is the center of the film and leads to the inevitable finals against the band of bank bobbers who killed his 10 year old son 10 years before.

634156,2,6303386334,"""Santee"" is an old-fashioned Western with a very old-fashioned lead, Glenn Ford, then 57, wearing a huge black hat.  A weary-looking bounty hunter (Ford) shoots dead a foul villain and the f.v.'s kid goes after Ford in the big black hat.  Dana Wynter, miscast in almost every role she ever played, and Jay ((Tonto) Silverheels are also involved in the tedium.  Director was Gary Nelson, getting a big-screen shot after a lot of years in television lending his art to ""Gilligan's Island"" and ""Love, American Style.""",1461715200,,514,4.953488372093023

It's indicative of its era but the dialog and storyline were a level below ""B-grade."" It struck me that this might have been one of Glenn Ford's last efforts, and he took the part because he needed the money. Don't know that for certain, just speculating. I managed to watch the entire film and while it was pretty lame it didn't rise to the level of a Plan 9 From Outer Space kind of cult bad. There are tons of other westerns that are far, far better, and unless you're specifically looking for something pretty lame to watch, you'd do better than Santee.

A bit graphic for my taste - bloody shoot out scenes. This was probably the beginning of having scenes depicting the reality of gun capabilities which in the earlier decade was not depicted in such a manner, plus it is in color. Sometimes the story seemed to jump leaving the viewer to wonder how certain things came about - made me wonder if the editors edited too much. Though the viewer knows he will get the bad guy who killed his son, the ending was sad in that one of the main characters die. As a Capricorn and romantic, I like happy endings and this ending was not although interestingly done.
