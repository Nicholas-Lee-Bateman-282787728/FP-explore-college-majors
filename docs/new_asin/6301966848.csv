388956,3,6301966848,"A fast talking smart mouth cop investigates a cocaine ring who specalizes in a lethal form of cocaine and sells it to the highest bidder. Basically  what the viewer has here is the female version of BEVERLY HILLS COP With  Goldberg having the same dialouge Eddie Murphy had. The violence and  bloodflow never stops from the opening scene right to the climatic finale.  The best part was the massive shoot out in the mall. The film has one weak  point Sam Elliot, wasn;t really convincing as a bodyguard who ends up  falling for Goldberg. Whoopi Goldberg pulled off a very funny genuine  performance. The film is worth seeing and is much,much better than BURGLER  realased the same year.",967680000,14,686,4.754237288135593

389067,3,6301966848,"Fatal Beauty is a 1987 police action flick starring Whoopi Goldberg as Detective Rita Rizzoli, a street-wise cop who dresses in Goldbergs typical screen attire  jeans and baggy sweatshirts. Rizzoli is on the trail of a drug dealer who has been pushing a particularly potent form of cocaine called Fatal Beauty. Her investigation leads to drug king Conrad Kroll (Harris Yulin) and his head security man, Mike (Sam Elliott). To nail Kroll, Rizzoli sets her sights on Mike as an unlikely ally.

As a police thriller, the film closely resembles Beverly Hills Cop, made three years earlier. Instead of Eddie Murphy, its Goldberg rat-tat-tatting wisecracks, spewing profanities, and showing that a woman can be an action hero as well as a man. Theres also the fish-out-of-water slant of Goldbergs Rizzoli pushing her way into the homes of the rich and quickly letting the occupants know whos in charge. Unfortunately, the swaggering and non-stop insults and put-downs wear out their welcome quickly. The film takes a turn for the serious when we learn about Rizzolis past and what inspired her to be such a determined cop.

For Goldberg, this role is far afield from her excellent work in The Color Purple. Rizzoli is probably a more comfortable fit for the actress, as it relies on her comic delivery and flair for the stinging one-liner. What is disappointing is how much Fatal Beauty cribs ideas and situations from other films, especially the aforementioned Beverly Hills Cop. Goldbergs talent deserves a more worthy script. Director Tom Holland (Fright Night) is content to let the action and Ms. Goldbergs mouth drive the film.

Also in the cast are Brad Dourif (One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest) as one of Krolls thugs and Ruben Blades as Rizzolis partner.

There are no bonus features on the widescreen Blu-ray release.",1460851200,,1819,4.99009900990099

389427,4,6301966848,This movie has a great storyline. Whoopi Goldberg and Sam Elliott are great together. The one thing I didn't like was the sound quality where it's sometimes hard to pick up dialogue so you would turn up the volume and the next scene you'd have to turn the volume way down because the sound effects were so loud.

Hollywood please make movies intended for adults but without the R rated language, glorified violence and sexual innuendos, i.e. make intelligent, witty scripts and well thought out plots where the story and quality acting capture your attention and entertain you.

389634,3,6301966848,"This movie is not bad, but it did not have as much action as I would have wanted it too.  Whoopi Goldberg is great with snappy one-liners and she definitely proves she can handle police work just like a man.  Again, it was not my favorite Whoopi film but it was not her worst.

In her very early years she was on drugs, something happened and she got her act together.  She is trying to take down a very bad man that has friends in high places. The movie has some funny parts in it. Then there is sam Elliott who by the way works for the drug dealer as his body guard.  Things get very interesting and she straightens him out and gets the bad guys.  It isn't one of her better movies but she is a good actor and pulls it off.

Running Scared:  Has Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines as cops in Chicago.  Lot of funny stuff, they don't play by the rules.  They come up against a man who is bucking to become the first Spanish Godfather.  It's really something to watch how they wind up getting him behind bars.

I reviewed ""Nighthawks"" and commented that it seemed to pave the way for buddy cop action movies, one of which would later become ""Lethal Weapon."" ""Running Scared"" like the other two aforementioned flicks is about buddy cops, one black and one white, who are chasing a bad guy who may or may not be cute. I pointed out that in Lethal Weapon we had Gary Busey (not appealing) and in ""Nighthawks"" we had Rutger Hauer (very appealing) and now in ""Running Scared"" we have Jimmy Smits (pretty appealing.) Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines play the cops here and they are funny together. Lots of good action but nothing over-the-top. I am not a fan of Whoopi so I didn't bother watching ""Fatal Beauty"" but it was cheaper on Amazon to buy the double feature than it was to buy the movie I wanted by itself. Picture and sound are fine. No bonus features. Really kind of an underrated obscure 80's cop flick set in Chicago this time. Billy Crystal is at his comedic best. Great price too for the movie.

I have always enjoyed movies where Whoopi Goldberg portrays the heroine.  Compound that with her being a police officer and you definitely have a winning combination.

389867,3,6301966848,"Whoopi has been in plenty of good films and a very little bad films. Fatal Beauty is not a bad film but it's not the best Whoopi can give you. I loved Jumpin Jack Flash but this movie doesnt have the appeal that Jumpin Jack Flash did. Fatal Beauty is still worth a look despite its flaws.

Plot: Fatal Beauty is in reference to a drug that kills its users within a few hours of its use. Whoopi Goldberg plays Rita Rizzoli, a cop who constantly goes undercover to find crooks and bust them. She stumbles unto the lethal drug called ""Fatal Beauty"" one night during a bust and is bent on finding out who is supplying it. She has to put up with a corrupted millionaire who she believes is in on the whole operation and his bodyguard Mike Marshak(Sam Elliot) who is attracted to her.

Opinion: Fatal Beauty has its share of positives as well as negatives.
Positives: Its funny(even though the laughs are sometimes sporadic), there are serious moments in the movie that sometimes work(like Rita revealing why she does what she does), the action scenes are decent, and the movie as a whole is a decent watch. Negatives: The laughs are sporadic, there is no chemistry between Whoopi's character and Sam Elliot's character(hell, there is more chemistry between Boris and Natasha of Rocky and Bullwinkle than these two), Sometimes there are more  unintentional laughs then genuine laughs, sometimes the movie feels like a Beverly Hills Cop knockoff(Rita gets so deep into a case that it costs her her job just like Axel Foley). Other than that this movie is still worth watching. Its far from the best movie that Whoopi has been in but its also far from the worst(Theodore Rex and Burglar). Its still worth being in your Whoopi Goldberg collection.",1214179200,3,1738,4.673202614379085

I'd forgot how not since the Blackploitation movie days, had I seen an African descended woman holding her own as an action heroine. It's unfortunate that this movie didn't get the treatment Jumping Jack Flash did when released on DVD. I'd love a director's cut with the restored Whoopi and Sam Elliott in bed scene. Brad Dourif and Rueben Blades were also quite memorable in their respective roles. I always grinned at the ""Jimmy on my mind,"" refrigerator interrogation.
