8572217,4,B00BPFPJ1E,"My wife and I love this yoga, i particular the four poses in the first part of the dvd. We found her instructions easy to understand and follow.",1428969600,2,144,4.178571428571429
8572218,2,B00BPFPJ1E,I have taken classes and done a weekend workshop on the method of yoga. This  DVD did not have the shavasana or the classic guided awareness or good meditation music. Svaroopa is by far my favorite yoga method! This DVD was informational. But not relaxing or satisfying enough for a daily routine.,1397433600,7,297,4.711538461538462
8572219,2,B00BPFPJ1E,"The Magic 4 and 4 on the Floor poses are all great, but the DVD itself is not so great. You cannot navigate from the Magic 4 to the 4 on the Floor or move around the DVD (for example, when starting out, if you want to go to a specific pose to study it more, you can't just skip to it). It's all one big track, which gets a bit convoluted, depending on how much of the program you want to do at any given time. It's better than nothing though because once you learn the poses, you can do them without using the DVD. So in that regard, it's a good thing.",1394496000,6,552,3.8508771929824563
8572220,5,B00BPFPJ1E,This is a great way to unwind and release tension. Simple and easy instructions to relax at home practicing restorative yoga.,1376179200,8,125,5.0
