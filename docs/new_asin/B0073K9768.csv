5053479,4,B0073K9768,"This is obviously a low budget film.  But, that is its only major flaw.  The acting and action was decent.  The plot and storyline is very cool.  If you are used to playing video games, then you will be able to look past the CGI.  Overall, this film is better than many others I've seen with bigger budgets.",1334707200,3,307,4.224137931034483
5053480,1,B0073K9768,"This movie is a waste of time and money. The acting is poor, the special effects are poor, the plot is poor.",1334707200,4,108,3.9545454545454546
8509299,5,B0073K9768,"Why such the low rating it is a great low budget movie it was great to watch, the acting was pretty good there is not much lacking in this movie, its got just about everything.",1507334400,,176,4.057142857142857
8509300,4,B0073K9768,The acting isn't great but the plot line is very interesting.,1490659200,,61,4.636363636363637
8509301,1,B0073K9768,I can confirm what everyone else is saying.  the acting is soooooo bad.  the plot is soooo bad.  they must have spend all of their money on the CGI because the two main characters are using plastic swords from party city to fight demons.  sooooo bad.,1478476800,,250,4.369565217391305
8509302,3,B0073K9768,"This isn't as bad as some have said.  It's just an average horror movie with some decent ideas, awful special effects, and 4th tier acting.  It looks more like a video game than a film, but if you want to pick it up one night, it isn't going to bother you.  It's worth a watch.  It leans towards the upper part of an average grade.",1368403200,2,331,4.046153846153846
8509303,1,B0073K9768,"How does a movie released in 2008 end up craftily concealed behind a decent looking splash promo in a Redbox? I don't know, but I hope the cast and crew didn't quit their day jobs. Absolute dreck.",1342915200,,196,4.324324324324325
8509304,1,B0073K9768,"I tried to watch this movie and made it about 10 minutes into it before losing interest and it played another ten minutes while I got a different movie out and the suffering ended when I hit the eject button.

This is one of the most poorly done movies I have seen in my life. If you buy this movie I hope it is as a gag gift for someone you don't like.

There is nothing, and I mean NOTHING, good in this movie.",1342396800,3,412,3.892857142857143
8509305,1,B0073K9768,"This movie was just terrible. The quality of my life declined a significant amount after watching this movie. The acting was just terrible, and at times the actors just repeated what the other actor said (there was one scene where the lead chick said ""What the hell is that"" to which the response was ""Shut up! ... what the hell is that?"" in the same tone of voice. Fortunately, there is very little dialogue in the movie anyways, but when there is, its very cheesy and probably could be written by a 3rd grader. Fortunately, the action sequences made up for the terrible dialogue.......... ok that was a lie. If anything, the action sequences made me even more depressed. Had i not watched this movie with a big group of friends, i probably would have gouged my eyes out or something along the lines of that. I normally do not rate movies or anything, but i figured i would save a couple of lives by rating and reviewing this one. DO NOT SEE IT!!!!! (unless you go into seeing this movie fully expecting to come out of it depressed and wanting to just cry because some people actually thought this would be a quality movie while they were filming it.)",1341619200,5,1152,4.4904761904761905
8509306,1,B0073K9768,"I always fall for movies at Redbox. All of these actors must have been chosen off the street because the acting is terrible, I think porno's have better acting than this. Don't waste your time.",1338595200,4,193,4.542857142857143
8509307,1,B0073K9768,"Here's the scoop...... one actor standing in front of a poorly drawn backdrop.... saying something stupid, to another actor standing in front of a poorly drawn backdrop.....saying something stupid.  OH!!!! don't forget the less than video game quality animation of the terrifying demon...... garbage.",1338508800,4,300,5.818181818181818
8509308,1,B0073K9768,"Saw this in a red box and the cover looked cool, and the storyline seemed interesting. It wasn't. Wast of time, graphics SUCK. Now i'm not one to judge, i love a good B movie, but this was just...BAD. 90% is infront of a green screen, save for the beginning and end. Acting was 'ok'. do not buy nor rent this!!!!",1336694400,,312,4.131147540983607
