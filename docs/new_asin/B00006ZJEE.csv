7973880,4,B00006ZJEE,"Another event that I was able to check out due to online sources which turned out to be a memorable card in itself. As one reviewer already mentioned, this was the first WWF U.K. only event before future events like Rebellion, Insurrextion & even the original No Mercy took place with the tagline of this event being similar to the one at SummerSlam '92 in which the British Bulldog was once again in a main event title match. This time, however it was to defend his European Championship against Shawn Michaels who was looking to become the first ""Grand Slam"" Champion in WWF history. Now I should point out that this video was edited down to two hours but since I saw the whole event, I will review the whole event & mention which matches are removed.

Hunter Hearst Helmsley vs Dude Love. It's interesting to mention that Hunter is the only person to have faced all of the personalities of Foley including Mick himself. Unlike the series of matches that Hunter had with Mankind earlier in the year & would later have with Cactus Jack, this one remained a wrestling match with Dude delivering various entertaining taunts along with Chyna playing a factor throughout the match. Good & fun opener to start the show.

Leif Cassidy vs Tiger Ali Singh. It's amazing to think that Al Snow...I mean Leif Cassidy was a good talented wrestler back in '97 but WWF didn't seem to notice that & made him a jobber. Case in point, that should explain how this match was as it was the debut of Tiger Ali Singh (remember him?) & the match was nothing more than a showcase for him within that short time.
(This match is removed from the VHS copy)

WWF Tag Team Champions The Headbangers vs Los Boricuas. This version of Los Boricuas included Savio Vega & Miguel Perez Jr. & on a personal note, even as a hispanic, I wasn't big on this group (although Savio was the talented one of the group) while the Headbangers had just won the Tag Team Titles at Ground Zero. There really wasn't anything ""must see"" here but it was an average match that wasn't bad with the Boricuas actually trying to stick to the tag team formula of isolating Mosh or Thrasher while the HeadBangers took advantage of one mistake for the win.

The Patriot vs Flash Funk. WOW, this match certainly got a lot of heat here before the match even begun as The Patriot came out to his usual ""U.S.A."" entrance (I would have cheered for Funk because he is the better overall performer, lol). This was a clash of styles with Funk trying to keep this a fast paced match while the Patriot used his power to keep Funk down with the only standout moments here being the submission hold that was applied by Funk at one point & the finish before Patriot got more heat from the UK fans.
(This match is removed from the VHS copy)

The Legion Of Doom vs The Godwinns. This is the rematch from SummerSlam & just like that previous match, this was a match that was average at best but there was nothing really memorable about it when it was over.

Right around here was two sets of interviews. One was an interview with WWF Champion Bret Hart who discusses how his match with The Undertaker will be the challenge of his career before being interrupted by Vince McMahon (ironically). The other is Jim Ross interviewing Ken Shamrock about his injuries before getting into a confrontation with Billy Gunn.

Vader vs Owen Hart. This was an interesting environment for this match since at the time, The Hart Foundation were heels in America but international heroes around the world while Vader got a mixed reaction despite recently turning face in the states prior to this event. Jim Ross described this match perfectly as it was ""speed & technique"" against ""power & strength"" as Vader just kept overpowering Owen every time Owen was building an offense before Owen was able to get back into the match with his speed & even did impressive moves like slamming Vader & putting him in the sharpshooter at one point. It's a shame we didn't get a chance to see these two face off more because this was a really good match that the crowd just ate up from start to finish with Owen being a heavy favorite underdog.

WWF Champion Bret Hart vs The Undertaker. This was the SummerSlam rematch with the difference being that the crowd was split between both men. Undertaker came into this match looking for revenge & really came out aggressive from the opening. He worked on Bret's chest & back to the point that he used a different technical offense (including various submission holds to the chest) that he had not shown before including delivering punches to the heart while Bret just kept attacking Taker's leg numerous times in the match including using the figure four leglock around the ringpost & getting desperate by exposing the turnbuckle & getting the ring bell at one point. The ending was kinda of a jip with Taker not being able to control his anger & wanting revenge instead of the victory but it didn't take away from a match that I consider to be a lost classic.
(Unfortunately, not on the VHS copy but available on the Bret/Taker DVD sets)

WWF European Champion The British Bulldog vs Shawn Michaels. As I mentioned earlier, Bulldog returned to his home country to defend his title against the most controversial athlete in the WWF at the time who was looking to make his own bit of history in winning every major title in the WWF. Right from the start, it was clear that Bulldog was the solid fan favorite while Shawn got a mixed reaction & pay close attention to what Shawn does to a certain fan that wouldn't leave him alone. This was a great match as Shawn & Bulldog always worked well together with Shawn using his speed while Bulldog was relying on his power & even showed some speed in the early moments. However, it was mid-way through the match that made a difference as Shawn's ""insurance man"" Rick Rude, Hunter & Chyna got involved & took advantage of one mistake that Bulldog made that would not only cost him the match but his title as well that lead to Shawn making history in an almost riot-like atmosphere.

Overall, this was a rare event that I am surprised that WWF hasn't released in its entirety since due to the tape being edited down with removing Funk/Patriot, Cassidy/Tiger & Bret/Taker (which I am still trying to figure out why). However if you can find this event, this is one event worth checking out.",1282694400,,6370,4.565179352580928

ONE NIGHT ONLY

This was the excellent event that the WWF brought forth in England in which DX really began to get moving. It was a great event that actually had three more matches on it that were not included on the VHS release. Tiger Ali Singh vs Leif Cassidy, The Patriot vs Flash Funk, and Bret Hart vs Undertaker with the WWF title on the line did not make the final VHS cut, but the Taker/Hart match was later released on DVD. This was a great event in my opinion and still to this day I enjoy it, I have this event recorded but I really need to find it. So I ordered the official release here and thus will review it.

1. TRIPLE H VS DUDE LOVE-the first match is between two people who would be seeing a lot of each other later on. Triple H who is fresh into the original DX at this point takes on Dude love aka Mick Foley. This is an excellent match especially in the psychology department. A lot of good action in this one as well as some interference from Chyna, but Triple H pulls out the victory. The best thing about this match is how the crowd is so into it, great opening contest. 4/5

2.[WWF TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP]-HEADBANGERS VS LOS BORICUAS-the second match of the evening as far as the VHS was fro the tag titles. This was a pretty good match between these two very different teams. The action is moving along at a good quick pace with Los Boricuas controlling most of the match. But once the Headbangers make the tag it does not take long for them to dominate and keep their titles. 4/5

3. THE GODWINNS VS LOD-the third match is another tag bout this time pitting to powerhouse teams against one another. The big boys from the country named the Godwinns are full of farmer strength and match up well with the legendary tag team of Animal and Hawk. Hawk and Animal also known as the Road Warriors or the Legion of Doom are just full on muscular beat down machines [until they met the New Age Outlaws] and match the Godwinns on power. The match goes as one would think with power moves and a lot of fists and clotheslines. The match is back and forth with a lot of high impact moves until the LOD hit the Doomsday Device and take the win. 3.5/5

In the next segment the world's most dangerous man Ken Shamrock is giving an interview only to be interrupted by Roc a Billy [Billy Gun]. Of course Ken can not have that and locks on the ankle lock, I love it.

VADER VS OWEN HART-this match would see the Hart Foundation's own Owen Hart [R.I.P.] go against one of the most entertaining bug men in my opinion ever, the man they call Vader. The match is really good with Owen trying to rally against the bigger man and pull of the upset. Vader on the other hand dominates with huge power moves wanting to crush Owen. The action actually moves at a quick pace with Owen getting the European crowd behind him ready for the upset. But even after a sharpshooter and finally being able to slam Vader he still comes up short. Vader catches him mid air after Owen comes off the top and slams him down hard. 4/5

5.[EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP] BRITISH BULLDOG VS SHAWN MICHAELS-this is with out a doubt the best match on the card as two of the greats go at it including my favorite HBK. This is the legendary night that Shawn won the European title from Bulldog and the DX era really kicked into high gear. This match is full of non stop action with Bulldog pressing and slamming Michaels all over the place. HBK resorts to some quicker moves and stays a little more light on the feet, but Bulldog stays on him. After a while Rick Rude, Triple H, and Chyna make their way down to ring side, once there they interfere. It is this interference that leads to the shocking changing of the title to HBK beating Bulldog in his home town. There are some really iconic shots of DX after the match that live on in various highlight reels. The Hart Foundation make their way out after the match to save Bulldog, but my question is where were they during the match when DX was interfering. 5/5

This is a really great event and really historic especially the main event, I thought this was one of the better event I have watched recently. Now the story is Bulldog was supposed to win and dedicate the win to his sister. Some say including Bret Hart that Shawn used his pull backstage to win and become the first Grand Slam Champion, meaning the first to hold every belt in the WWF at the time. Of course some say that never happened but which ever is true it remains a very historic event.",1258329600,,4482,4.308422301304864
7973882,3,B00006ZJEE,"Thanks to an old tape I found in a box, I relived an old PPV from the then-WWF that was a rare event called One Night Only.  This PPV was history making on so many levels as it was the first U.K. exclusive PPV in WWE history paving the way for the later events of the ""original"" No Mercy, Capital Carnage, Insurrextion, and Rebellion.  This was also the first PPV in Europe since SummerSlam '92 and just like that event, the hometown hero in the British Bulldog main evented here in a championship match...only this time to defend his European Championship against a man who was out to make his own history that night.  Now it should be noted that the VHS version of this PPV was cut down to 2 hours so WWE removed the following matches: Tiger Ali Singh vs. Leif Cassidy, The Patriot vs. Flash Funk, and Bret Hart defending the WWF Championship against Undertaker...however one positive note out of this is that the Taker/Bret match was later released on both Taker & Bret's DVD sets.

Dude Love vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - This was around the period where the future ""Triple H"" was in transition from the arrogant blueblood into the degenerate while Mick Foley was just starting his singles run as the babyfaced Dude Love.  This was different than the earlier series Hunter had against Mankind & the later hardcore battles with Cactus Jack was this stayed as a wrestling match in the ring and along with various entertaining moments by Dude.  Good opening match between both men.

WWF Tag Team Champions Headbangers vs. Los Boricuas - For the record, this version of the Boricuas was Savio Vega & Miguel Perez while the Headbangers won the Tag Team titles around two weeks earlier at the Ground Zero PPV.  Neither team was really a ""tag team specialist"" so this was just an average match at best but nothing special.

Legion Of Doom vs. Godwinns - The rematch from SummerSlam here as it was just like their SummerSlam match in that it was just average but again, nothing special or noteworthy.

Vader vs. Owen Hart - Keep in mind that this match happened around the time that the Hart Foundation were babyfaces in America but international fan favorites while Vader recently turned face against the Hart Foundation but got a mixed reaction here...and it should also be noted of what happened between Owen & Jerry Lawler at ringside when that Canadian flag got a little too close to Lawler.  This was one of those matches that gives Owen Hart his reputation for being such a great worker as eventhought there was a huge size difference here (and it came into play various times in the beginning), him & Vader put on a real good match here and vibed off each other well.  It wasn't a classic but made me wish they did more here.

WWF European Champion British Bulldog vs. Shawn Michaels - British Bulldog was out to defend the championship that represents his home continent, with his sister (who he dedicated the match to) & his wife Diana Hart at ringside, against the man out to become the first man to ever be a ""Grand Slam"" champion by holding all of the active WWF championships at that time and just like the Vader/Owen match earlier...Bulldog was clearly the favorite while HBK had a mixed reaction here.  This was a great match here with Bulldog using his power against Shawn's quickness.  However, the bigger issue here was the appearence of Hunter & Chyna along with the ""insurance policy"" of Ravishing Rick Rude all getting involved in the match here & taking advantage of a match changing misstep by Bulldog.  The ending along with the inring aftermath involving the Hart family that caused an almost riot-like atmosphere with the fans that saw tons of trash fill the ringside area as Shawn Michaels became the new European Champion in his usual controversal ways at that time.

Also on this tape is an interview with Ken Shamrock that saw a confronation between him & Billy Gunn who was in the middle of his ""Rockabilly"" gimmick at that time.  In the end, the real flops here were the tag matches and could have easily been replaced by the Bret/Taker match they decided to remove from the tape but otherwise, this was a good event filled with two solid singles matches and a great main event that I'm suprised hasn't made it's way to DVD yet (would have been perfect for the DVD on the original DX).  In the end, if you can get this cheap then it's worth taking a look at.",1250812800,3,4386,4.6
7973883,4,B00006ZJEE,"This event was great even though due to time restraints they cut out the Undertaker & Bret Hart WWF Title match, but it sucked anyway and ended in a DQ. This was the only UK event I know of where a Title actually changed hands. This will be forever remembered as the night HHH/HBK/Chyna formed DX to comete with the WCW's NWO.
Here are the matches:
1.)Dude Love vs. HHH
good match with the crowd really in it 4/5
2.)WWF Tag Title Match
Headbangers vs. Los Baricuas
Nice match headbangers sucessfully defended their titles 4/5
3.)Legion of Doom vs. The godwinns
the L.o. D. are great and they showed it but not in the greatest match 3/5
4.)Vader vs. Owen
This match was great owen proved that he could go with big men although he eventually lost.
5.)WWF European Championship
Shawn Michaels vs. British Bulldog
Bulldog comes home to the UK to defend his title but loses it in an amazing match. DX was formed at the end of this match.",1087603200,6,932,4.456140350877193
