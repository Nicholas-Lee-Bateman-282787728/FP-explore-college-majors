6991845,4,B00SOPORW0,i enjoyed this series has a lot of story but when the action scenes take place it's awesome! I would have liked to see more agros fights against beta.. Seemed like the urgency of eradicating the beta was non-existent they weren't all concerned until they came knocking on their door... But the story is nice characters are easy to be attached to which makes you care about them.  that's a plus in a good story. It definitely left it open for more down the road.,1430697600,2,461,4.423529411764706
6991846,1,B00SOPORW0,One of the worst series I have ever watched - the BETA hardly ever make an appearance; most of the time is spent in love triangles and senseless side plots. You couldn't pay me to get this DVD.,1430092800,3,193,4.105263157894737
6991847,4,B00SOPORW0,"With the events of Russia behind them Argos squad prepares for the next step of the testing of their new TSF's, a battle royale between some of the best squads from around the world, including the U.S. Infinity squad that Yuuya was a part of.  However things get out of hand when a renegade group takes control of the test base and announce that they consider the BETA's as gods and the next step in evolution.  Can Yui and Yuuya lead the squads to victory of human enemies, or will their tensions and secrets destroy them and bring about a final BETA victory.

This is the second half of the series, and while the first part had its moments this one takes it up a notch.  From new rivals for Yuuya's attention, to a new threat, this story is just as good as the first part.  If you watched the first part enjoy this one and hope that they do a new season as I really would like to see how this love square resolves itself.",1422489600,5,923,4.221590909090909

8699013,5,B00SOPORW0,This is a Great Anime Series. This is the Second collection of the series episodes 13-24 and Muv-Luv Alternative Total Eclipse 1 is the first collection and I recommend watching both of them. This items description on the page paints a really good pitcher of the story line of Aliens (BETA) VS. Mecha (Tactical Surface Fighter or TSF) or at least its was suppose to be that way so enters a new and common enemy. So be ready for some surprises along the way that will have you wanting to watch more! The ending is nice but like most anime series you will always want another two season or a movie to wrap up the whole store line.,1489622400,,628,4.330508474576271

8699017,5,B00SOPORW0,"Muv- luv Alternative: Total Eclipse when I first saw this I couldn't wait for it to come out but nether Funamation nor Anime Works picked up the rights to do the English version of Muv-Luv. Well at least not right away. This is a Sci-Fi Mecha that has these aliens from space first encountered on the moon but they soon landed on Earth. The Beta as they are called invade and eat everything including people, sweep across the world in an effort to stop them the Japanese come up with a new type of T.S.F. short for Tactical Surface Fighter and a new type of experimental weapon that can kill the Beta by the thousands but the Russians see this as their chance to steal it after a successful test fire. This anime has it all beautiful art work great story line intrigue, suspense, danger and some of the most beautiful pilots. I gave this two thumb way up",1440806400,,854,4.377358490566038
