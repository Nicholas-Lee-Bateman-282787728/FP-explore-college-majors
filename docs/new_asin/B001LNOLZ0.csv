8319107,4,B001LNOLZ0,"This film is considered one of Gene Autry's favorites by his many fans over the years my self included. It is light, bouncy, energetic, fun, musical and fast paced. The plot revolves around weather or not drilling for oil is a good thing for the local cattlemen. The bad guys are bad. The heroine is attractive and spunky. But Gene is more than capable of handling her antics such as when she splashed mud all over him with her convertible. Well actually he came out on the short in of the series of events that immediately followed that act. But he was able to even up the score when he pawned her car radio to retrieve his saddle that she sold to the pawn shop. Gene eventually straightened her out and won her over in this second ""taming of the shrew"" themed Autry movie. The first was Sagebrush Troubadour(1935) in which he spanked the young and beautiful Barbara Pepper. Many will remember her from the 1960's TV show Green Acres. In the early seasons she played Arnold the pig's mother-For obvious reasons. Father time increased her dimensions abundantly.
Back to our movie. Get Along Little Doggies was perfect for small town/rural audiences of the Great Depression era. It had an uplifting quality. The performers projected happiness as they appeared to be having a very good time. This was true of many GA films of the the thirties and early forties. Less so after WWII. There is a sing-a-long section in the movie with the words on the screen so the audience can participate if so desired. In short if you want to just forget about the cares of the World and go back to a simpler time this is not a bad way to do it.

PS I would have given it five stars if it was fully restored. This appears to be a television print as it is only about 53 minutes in length. One source indicates that it was originally 66 minutes. Nevertheless it is an enjoyable experience.",1305590400,3,1869,4.497058823529412
