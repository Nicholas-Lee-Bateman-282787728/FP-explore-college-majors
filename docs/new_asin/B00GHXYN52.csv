6077266,3,B00GHXYN52,I am annoyed that this has been on pre-order for so long without a release date specified.  I keep checking back to see if a date is published.  I refuse to pre-order items because then you never know when they are going to arrive (if you don't keep checking).,1386633600,3,260,4.285714285714286

6077270,5,B00GHXYN52,"This is a must watch for any Survivor fan. Jean-Robert and Courtney are the 2 villains of the season. They start off on the same tribe and it's like watching 2 weeds that needs to be whacked. James and Amanda are the 2 heroes of the season. James isn't very bright and Amanda has trouble being clutch in critical times. This is half of the Fei Long tribe, which turned out to be casting gold. The other tribe doesn't have as memorable contestants, but become worthy of someone to root for at the end of the game.",1383696000,7,512,4.288659793814433

6077308,1,B00GHXYN52,This was a bad copy.  I had it replaced and the small episodes would not play.  I don't recommend this season until they get the master corrected.  I think those who ordered and received these season should get new versions once the master is corrected.,1394150400,,253,4.5777777777777775

6077314,1,B00GHXYN52,"I pre-ordered both of these seasons and was notified when they were ready for release. Like others, I don't understand why past seasons take so long to come out on DVD. I am a Survivor uber-fan, and buy all that finally come out.

However, both of these seasons arrived and neither would play on my DVD player. Both kept giving a ""disk error"" message. Further inspection revealed they were DVD-Rs, and a friend of mine who has some expertise in that area took a look and told me they both appeared to be high-quality bootlegs. He suggested I try playing them on my computer.

China would not play as my computer said I did not have the correct application to play it. Searching in the App store produced no results.

Decided to return China and Amazon was very helpful. Today I received a message that a replacement was on its way, but from the same distributor (Don Roy King), so I imagine the replacement will have the same problem.

Anyone have any idea where I can purchase legit copies of this season as well as Micronesia, and any later seasons?",1392681600,3,1051,4.515789473684211

6077319,1,B00GHXYN52,"The rating I am giving is for the release and production of the DVD.  There seems to be an R & P issue here.  I received the confirmation e-mail within 30 minutes of ordering it. I have ordered many times from Amazon and have ALWAYS been pleased with products and service.  The e-mail also stated that they would contact me with delivery date when they know it and that I can cancel the order at any time.  FINE.  I would have preferred to see a time estimation (release date could be 6 months from today). It has been a month and I am still waiting for word of the release date and production of this product.  I would not be surprised if I had ordered Season 27, Blood vs Water, but Survivor China aired in 2007!  How long does it take, really?  I am a Survivor fan, have watched the show since Season 2.  If I had some idea of this time issue, I would have gone to a Brick & Mortar store to choose something else for this gift.  When will I be able to give it???",1389657600,,965,4.085106382978723

8623431,4,B00GHXYN52,Amazing season of Survivor. One of my favs no doubt. Watched the whole thing through and it played just fine on my DVD player for my MacBook Air. Only downside to this set is the case it comes in. The discs are stacked one on top of the other instead of on individual flaps and it makes it trickier to get them and the chances for damage are much greater. Same problem when I bought Micronesia. Please change this and this will bring it to 5 stars!!!,1482019200,,450,4.183908045977011
