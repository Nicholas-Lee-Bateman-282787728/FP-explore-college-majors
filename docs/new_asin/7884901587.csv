This movie was ok, like I said not the best but good enough to own. You get the ever so hot Gillian Chung from Twins and the supporting cast members don't look bad themselves. This is about a group of young first year college girls moving into there dorm. And once one of them gets a weird text all hell breaks loose. A concept done many times about a cell phone but what didn't work for me is that in my opinion it was more like fantasy with the weird dreams or you think it's a dream. For horror I don't care for the fantasy like concept. Other than that it's an ok little film to check out. I can honestly say if it weren't for Gillian being on here, this would have been another horror flick that failed, but since I love my Twins this was an ok flick",1423958400,,910,4.061111111111111
