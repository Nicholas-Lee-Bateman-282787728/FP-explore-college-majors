929031,1,6304773307,How can some of those people give this movie five stars. It was dumb all it was was about a guy who moves in with a gay guy and has to practice for a gay play,930268800,,158,3.4166666666666665
929032,4,6304773307,I have seen this movie and think it's great. Nick Scotti is extremely sexy and gorgeous. He made the whole film for me. I am not gay but this movie was a tour de force. A great movie for the changing times. Let's see more  of Nick Scotti in future films. And the character Terry was super funny.  Watch this film and Enjoy!,928800000,,323,4.111111111111111
929033,4,6304773307,"This was a pretty good movie.  The characters were stereotypical, but thankfully they did seem to manage to break past their stereotypical roles and at least learn to tolerate and have fun with ""the other  side.""  Now if only there was a movie that showed that not all gays  fit the sterotypes we want them too.  A gay guido?  Not this time.  Be who  you are.  Enjoy the movie.",928195200,8,377,4.3478260869565215

930011,3,6304773307,"One of the first things that struck me was the reliance on pay phones and early model mobile phones. (When was the last time you saw someone use a pay phone in a movie set in NYC -- or anywhere for that matter?) In addition, the general naivete surrounding homosexuality is almost quaint. It harks back to even earlier times. Yes, this is a farce and the premise is that one of the main characters is clueless about gays, but if you were making this movie today, you couldn't get away with the same kind of setup. It just wouldn't be remotely believable. So it's worth seeing just to get a sense for what it was like 20 or 30 years ago. The acting is OK and very earnest. One standout is Molly Price. She gives an amazingly over the top performance as the man-starved landlady. It's definitely worth seeing, but keep your expectations low.",1381449600,6,839,4.419354838709677

930017,3,6304773307,"Kiss Me Guido is a gay-themed comedy that is fitfully entertaining. The problem is that's it's a comedy, but it's hardly ever funny. Well, except for when Craig Chester is onscreen. Nick Scotti is good eye candy though, and he's often shirtless. The music is probably the best thing about Kiss Me Guido. Most of the music on the soundtrack is dance music from the 80's and 90's.",1297209600,2,378,4.573529411764706
930018,4,6304773307,"Basically, a feel good movie with a gay foundation. Very funny! Mixing straight people with gay people in a way they're forced to come to terms with, is always a funny device. Now, doing so using the most macho of male egos, the Guido-type, is the taking of this device to the extreme. But the straight guy in this film was a good egg and willing to learn how to cohabitate as a way to better his entire life. Gay humor, more so the catty wit of the gay male, kills me and this film didn't let me down. Lotta laughs and everybody wins in the end.",1209168000,,546,4.11214953271028
930019,4,6304773307,"""Kiss Me Guido"" is titled by a single line in the film, which is heard only once. It refers to a straight Italian male, which in the gay community is not a real cool thing to be. This is a very good film about a straight guy who moves in with a gay roommate not knowing what he's really getting into. There are a lot of surprises ahead for Frankie Zito (Nick Scotti) who is searching to find a life of his own away from his Italian family. Frankie is an aspiring actor but must decide how willing he is to pay his dues to get there. This is the debut performance for Scotti who does a marvelous job portraying his character. I would love to see more from this actor who obviously decided not to persue an acting career. The casting and quality in this film is very good. Christopher Lawford and the guy who plays his new lover are the weak performances in my opinion. The rest of the cast is pretty good, especially Nick Scotti and Anthony Barrile. There are also some good extras included on the DVD, such as the commentary option you should enable for your second run through of this movie. It gives some great background on the making of the film and showcases some of the visual effects used. The commentary is done by filmmaker Tony Vitale. I felt the plot could have used a little more pizazz and I was a little disappointed that they stopped short of the films potential. I would however recommend it. Very good quality production, but don't expect it to be the best film you've ever seen.",1161648000,2,1496,4.3464285714285715
930128,4,6304773307,"Not remotely believable for even a second, this movie is still very entertaining. The plot is reminiscent of the screwball comedies of old, with misunderstandings and double entendres bouncing all over the place, with the difference that what would have been a winking gay subtext in the past is now (of course) front and center.

I think the script could have delved more deeply into the friendship between Warren and Frankie and how they become more comfortable with each other -- as it stands, it's like there's no second act. But Nick Scotti does a great job as Frankie and proves to be physically perfect for the role. (I'm not so sure that Anthony Barille completely passes as gay, though.)

This is a great movie for a rainy afternoon or a casual evening at home with friends. My only question is why Nick Scotti didn't go on to make several more movies ... he's got real screen presence and excellent comic timing.

Look for director Tony Vitale in two scenes, playing a wise-cracking pizzeria customer.",1159574400,3,1011,4.765714285714286
930129,1,6304773307,"And I liked it then, but now there is so much more to choose from that is actualy thoughtful, less stereotypical, and better written.

I empathized much more with the straight character, who was trying to make the best of a bad situation. The gay character is caddy and snippy and, frankly, not very attractive.",1145923200,4,311,4.654545454545454

It's not a bad movie like you have to stop the VCR because it's hurting your eyes but I couldn't find any attractive elements in the movie.

930131,2,6304773307,"Frankie is a slightly dense Italian working in a New York pizzeria while dreaming of becoming a famous actor. When he discovers his brother screwing his girlfriend, he impulsively decides to leave the family business and pursue his dream. He finds an ad in the newspaper for a GWM seeking a roommate. Frankie assumes GWM stands for ""guy with money"" and moves in with no questions asked. It doesn't take long for even the dim-witted Frankie to realize that his new roomie Warren is gay. The homophobic Frankie is horrified and wants to move out, but can't afford to find another place, so the two must learn to overcome their differences and get along. Can they pull it off? And could they possibly even become friends in the process?
This movie is based on so many stereotypes and rather flimsy plot premises, that I don't really know where to start. Italians and gays are both parodied in a well-meaning if unremarkable script. It's not a horrible movie; it's just not a particularly good one either.
Interestingly, CBS tried to turn this movie into a sitcom called ""Some of My Best Friends"" starring Jason Batemen as Warren, but a weak movie idea makes an even weaker TV show, and it quickly flopped.",1082678400,2,1202,4.701421800947867

930134,3,6304773307,"KISS ME GUIDO is one of those off beat movies that has a kick to it. It's funny, it's charming and it has a lot of sass to it. It stars Nick Scotti (Bullet, Detroit Rock City) as a straight Italian lover who thinks an add with GWM in it means `Guy With Money' instead of what it really means which is `Gay White Male'.
He then befriends this gay man looking for a roommate to help paying bills played by Anthony Barrile (Sinatra, Hamburger Hill) who has an ex-lover (Played by Craig Chester (Frisk, Bumping Heads)  )who has a new boyfriend actor (Played by Christopher Lawford (Exit Wounds, Thirteen Days) ) who is about to put on a play production.
Guido is an actor who has no talent in the people skills area but seems to have a natural affinity for `gay' acting roles until he realizes he must, and has to, kiss a man. The rest is pure comedy. From the straight laced strict Catholic Italian families of New York to the stereo typical `Queens' of gay New York City
The movie made me chuckle and chuckle many times. Cleverly directed by Tony Vitale (Very Mean Men, Jungle Juice) the films makes you believe anything is possible. Fun and charming - all the way around. ...",1031788800,18,1174,4.385321100917431
930135,3,6304773307,"The movies and television have stupidly believed for decades that the public is thrown into convulsive fits of laughter by any characters with heavy New York accents (or Southern accents, etc., etc.)  One result of this arrogance is this rather heavy handed look at relations between a not very bright straight guy and a rather uninteresting gay guy, with more than its fair share of ethnic stereotypes thrown in,  needlessly adding another dimension of sledgehammer-hits-thumb humor.  The characters are too broadly drawn caricatures.  Though there are a couple of really funny moments and delicious scenes, in the end I never really cared much about what happened to either Warren or Frankie, I just wanted them off the screen.",1012780800,2,729,5.1525423728813555
930136,2,6304773307,"I rented this movie thinking that as an important piece of gay cinematic history, I really should see it. I discovered that its importance lies in the fact that gay cinema has come a long way beyond this dull, predictable, badly-acted, poorly written film. The characters are also...blah. Warren (Anthony Barrile) and Frankie (Nick Scotti) are two men, gay and straight respectively who try room together. Warren needs money and Frankie wants to improve his social circle. Warren is relatively engaging and Frankie is somewhat charming at times but the other cast members bring this movie down to rock bottom. Warren's best friend (who's name has escaped me - thankfully) is painfully bad. He's intended to be the typical sardonic wise-cracking best friend but comes across as irritatingly uninteresting. There's also a sub-plot with their landlady Meryl that seems tacked on all for the sake of making the movie an acceptable length. All of this leads up to an utterly unbelievable and painfully preachy ending about the real measure of people that seems taken out of a college theatre production.

930262,5,6304773307,"This is a fun movie for all! I rented it from the public library, and this is definately one of the films I would purchase on DVD or VHS, since I enjoyed it so much!
You can especially appreciate it if you live in the Brooklyn/Manhattan area of New York City, because Guidos listening to 103.5 KTU are a pure staple of our local society. :)
One thing that's very attractive about this film is a distinct plot conflict between characters, which is eventually resolved at the end of the film, as all characters find that they need and want each other, whether they're the manhating Meryll, the homophobic Frankie, the abused gay lover Warren, or even Pino the player getting in touch with his monogamous side. It wasn't offensive, nor did it insult the viewer's intelligence, as the story kept moving along at a brisk and very interesting pace.

Some movies aren't made with Oscar in mind, and this is one of those.  It's fun, light-hearted, simplistic, but so very enjoyable.  I won't go into plotlines, as other reviewers have already done that.  Suffice to say this movie will entertain you and make you smile.
The DVD picture is crisp and clear and the audio is perfect: not too loud, not too soft (there's nothing worse than not being able to hear the dialog only to have the house rattle once the music booms in).  The widescreen format really suits this film.  The only downside to this DVD release --and a minor one at that-- is the commentary by director Tony Vitale.  It's incredibly boring with l-o-n-g moments of silence.  There are a couple of interesting tidbits here and there, but nothing deep or earth-shattering.  A bit of rehearsal on Tony's part would have helped this tremendously because he sounds bored at times.  But I won't judge this feature too harshly since it's not part of the original movie per se.

930266,5,6304773307,"""KISS ME GUIDO"" IS A GREAT FILM. WE DON'T GET FILMS WITH SUCH A SIMPLE PREMISE THAT PROVE TO BE SO FUNNY. NOT SINCE I'D SAY ""THE ODD COUPLE"" WITH JACK LEMMON AND WALTER MATTHAU. I'M ITALIAN AND FOUND THE  REFERENCES AND OTHER ITALIAN NEW YORK CITY STUFF TO BE TRUE TO LIFE AND  VERY FUNNY. I WATCHED ""GOODFELLAS"" AND ALL 5 ""ROCKY""  FLICKS AFTER FRANKIE'S HILARIOUS DIOLOGUE.

930267,4,6304773307,"Rather funny flick featuring an incredibly good-looking guy from New York City (playing the role of a heterosexual). In searching for a place to live, he comes across a personal ad with the code GWM. Thinking this means ""Guy With Money"", he moves in. The ensuing tale is cute and funny  as the two come to terms living with each other! Plays out the stereotypes  fairly well.  Mixes, Brooklyn, Broadway and ""The Sound of Music""  very well.  Could have done without the father in the bathroom scene at the  theater.  By no means the quality or intensity of ""Torch Song  Trilogy"", but a well-done mainstream movie that deals with gays and  straights very well.  If you liked ""Trick"" or ""The  Birdcage"", you should enjoy this movie (and vice-versa).",954720000,,746,4.75
930268,2,6304773307,"Frankie (Nick Scotti) is a Bronx, home-grown Italiano pizza guy/wanna-be actor who thinks homos are gross.  Warren (Anthony Barrile) was living off his boyfriend and, now that he's gone, can't pay the rent.  Terry (Craig  Chester) is Warren's (completely stereotypical) flamingly gay friend who  decides to put a roommate ad in the newspaper to help Warren out.  Frankie  answers the ad under the premise that GWM actually means Guy With Money.  And that's where the culture clash begins...and the humor basically ends.  Some of this movie is funny (see the subplot with Warren's landlord, Meryl,  a therapist's dream trying to get her lovelife in order AND trying to get  Warren to pay 5 month's back rent) but most of it manages to easily fall  flat.  Too much of the characters' behavior relies completely on  stereotypes - gay men being flamboyant and liking showtunes, Italian men  talking like uneducated buffoons and working in pizza joints - and this  results in absolutely no originality, therefore no laughs.  For some  reason, American films with gay characters manage to go overboard in their  depictions, and this is no exception.  Rent it just once to see what the  landlord has to say in her minimal supporting role but then forget about  it.  There's not much else to see.",953683200,6,1288,4.948356807511737
930269,5,6304773307,"the opening sequence sets tone for what's to come. when the macho italian sees this huge muscle guy kissing another man he gets grossed out, yet when he greets another italian in the same manner it's: no big deal. the movie  is just priceless how ""gay"" and ""straight"" lifestyles  play off each other through the whole movie. a great movie.",944611200,2,339,4.633333333333334
930270,5,6304773307,"This movie makes me laugh, think and believe that real friendship doesn't know about steryotypes. Very hilarious, full of unpredictable and real funny sequences, it has though a deep message about the power of  friendship, understanding, and the most important: acceptance.
Although  there is a main character in this movie, all the actors performed  brilliantly: the brother's ""macholistic"" attitude, the landlord  (a real woman, with a deep desire for human relationship, the father,  although he is only talking some parts at the end, he, with the mother and  the grand mother are ""needed"" in this movie.
I personally  enjoyed so much the comicity of some scenes mixed with realism (the part  when the protagonist plays at the theatre, while the family is watching;  and the dream scene was especially hillarious, mixing very beautiful  excerpts of music.
FIVE STARS. and looking forward to another film.",941932800,,907,5.236111111111111

I like how the ""guido""  eventually gets in touch with his feminine side. I reccomend buying this  movie (or renting..Whatever you prefer) So..
