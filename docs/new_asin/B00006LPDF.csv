1785432,4,B00006LPDF,"This 4 DVD set of ""America's Most Scenic Drives"" is a great addition to any nature enthusiast's collection. If you want to know what America has to offer in this area, you will find it all, including some breathtaking and amazing scenery that you might not've thought of as being in America. To imagine that all of this can easily be accessible by a drive, you will be thrilled to know that you too can cruise these very same scenic roads of America.
Although it would've been nice to watch these DVD's with no narration, it does help to explain what it is that you are looking at, which is quite helpful (Although the narrator's voice does get a little annoying at times).
The fourth bonus DVD is great also, showing timeless American culture and landscapes accompanied by great classic music. A great bonus.
If you are looking to plan a road trip, or to just see where things are in America, this is a great DVD set, and should not be passed up.",1078963200,42,947,4.448275862068965
1785433,5,B00006LPDF,"This DVD is quite spectacular. The company who released this is Questar. I was not impresed by their picture quality on a diffrent DVD of ""Yosemite"" that was an old film. I was leary about purchasing anything again from Questar Inc. untill I decided to buy this DVD.""America's Most Scenic Drives"" is a great value and I highly suggest those who like scenery with great picture quality to add this on to your collection. This film was produced from a Reader's Digest Collection. THE BEST FEATURE ABOUT THIS DVD IS that it is over 5 HOURS LONG on 4 discs and also includes the ABSOLUTE BEST TRIBUTE ON AMERICA I HAVE EVER SEEN. It is titled ""America The Beautiful"". Walt Disney did his own 360* format (one of a kind) for Disneyland back in the early 70's. This IS NOT the Disney version at first I was hoping for but Reader's Diget's version is even better than Disney's version. The picture quality is outstanding and top notch next to IMAX production high-definition. This seperate DVD (in the same set) is worth the price alone. ""American The Beautiful"" features amazing scenery of all the states, includes all our major cities, culture representations along with the absolute best of all America's theme songs representing each state. Such classics are in Dolby 5.1. Includes ""New York, New York"", ""Oaklahoma"", ""Shenandoah"", ""This Land Is Our Land"", ""Take Me Out To The Ball Game"", ""Old Kentucky Home"", ""OOl' Man River"", ""Spirit Of New Orleans"", ""Chicago"", ""California Here I Come"", John Denver's ""Rocky Mountain High"", and ""America The Beautiful"".You cannot get a better value on any scenery DVD out there. Over 5 hours long and the bonus hour long DVD of ""America The Beautiful"" is a must see!!I have a widescreen 65"" projection tv and sometimes have troubles with picture quality when I buy some DVDs because I can see so much. For those with widescreen tv's or big projection tv's, DO NOT be discouraged that this DVD is in full screen format. The picture quality is outstanding! If I was an IMAX producer, I would go to the peoepl who made this version of ""America The Beautiful"" and see about getting it up on an IMAX screen in IMAX format. Simply amazing! Buy this DVD if you want top notch scenery! This company could've released ""AMerica The Beautiful"" seperate for the same price. The value you get on this DVD is the best I've seen yet!",1059436800,119,2350,4.7201946472019465

1785483,5,B00006LPDF,"Other reviewers objected to the red Ford leading the way on this scenic road journey but we did not as this travel set depicts a road trip.  As in any travel set whether by air, on the road, or on a cruise...there will always be objections to selection of scenes, narration, or voids as expectations differ but I would not hesitate in recommending this 4 disc set of some of the most beautiful spots in America.  Overall, the scenes were just beautiful, the narration was brief and informative, and the 5 hours of travel entertainment makes this set well worth your time and money.  The last hour of beautiful scenes accompanied by patriotic music on disc 4 was a bonus ending to a most enjoyable tour.",1370390400,,702,4.555555555555555

Because of my love for our national parks and scenic byways i bought this DVD. And last year i went to 40 state and local parks, 10 National parks, saw three Zoo's and visited over 40 lighthouses. Great DVD!!",1355443200,2,375,4.1506849315068495
1785508,3,B00006LPDF,"this is a real bargain for a travel video but like the other reviewers has said,  the red car in this video is annoying.  most probably the ford motor company
sponsored this video to show off their taurus car.  another problem is that each place was only given like 5 minutes of viewing which i think is not enough plus
it only showed the scenic spots and did not emphasize the people and its culture in each place.  reader's digest which is known for good writing did not do
a good job here.",1355184000,,492,4.258064516129032

1785511,2,B00006LPDF,"It's a just an OK DVD. They gave you the route number of the road taken. Then they showed the animated route being drawn on map that is missing all other roads. It is more about destinations to see in the USA than the roads it takes to get to them. Get the Readers Digest Most Scenic Drives in America Book, National Geographic Guides to Scenic Highways or the Back Roads of New England or whatever destination IN BOOK. I bought it looking for some new roads to ride my motorcycle on. No one has produced a good compilation of great roads....Rick Seebak and Lincoln Highway is the best I've seen, but its just one highway.",1342915200,,622,4.370689655172414

1785516,1,B00006LPDF,The picture quality is terrible. Looks like it was transferred from VHS or some older technology. I'll stay away from Reader's Digest videos from now on.,1249430400,6,153,4.923076923076923
1785521,1,B00006LPDF,"You actually see more of the little red car (a Ford...did Ford sponsor the original tv broadcast, I wonder?) than you do anything that I'd call ""scenery""...lots of parades and roadside trashy touristy stuff - and the film crew has an inexplicable fascination with traffic lights in the downtown areas of small towns...I have no idea what that's about, but very little it the way of scenery. For instance, if the sequence in disk 1 about Mount Desert Island in Maine was all you had to go on, you wouldn't think the place was worth visiting, much less one of the most beautiful places in the entire country which it is. You'd have a really good idea of what that stupid red car looked like though!

I'm shocked that Reader's Digest let its name be attached to something this cheesy...stay away!",1233187200,12,793,4.624113475177305
1785522,4,B00006LPDF,"The concept is good, the sceneries are also beautiful. The only problem is that the cameras are not good. Even though they are on DVD, the picture quality is low, it has that old grainy 70's movies lookalike. With the music and the narrator's voice, i wonder when they actually filmed this? Did they just recycle some old material from the 70's?

Also they tried to avoid people as much as possible, so they rarely see tourists, etc, most of the time, you see those places without the people.",1224201600,2,492,4.52808988764045

1785526,5,B00006LPDF,"Reader's Digest really outdid themselves with `America's Most Scenic Drives'.  Where else can you see so much of the beautiful United States without leaving your own living room?  Practically nothing is left to the imagination with a 4 disc set covering 5 hours worth of material.  There are plenty of special features also that make this set even more appealing.  The first 3 discs contain maps of all the drives, a music video, a bonus program, and photo slide show.  Each of these offerings is unique for each disc.  The last disc is a 55 minute presentation called `America the Beautiful Music Tribute' and is 19 songs set to a picture montage that compliments our landmarks, citizens, and landscapes.

The video footage throughout these programs is quite distinct and it is all very nice to look at.  The narration, in my opinion, was smoothly paced and not so loud that it detracted from background music.  Also, the information described about all the visited locations is interesting in and of itself.  Having the choice of either 2.0 Dolby or 5.1 surround sound was a nice option too.

I've seen other DVD sets on the market that contain similar material comparable to this but in a much smaller scale and without any bonus material to speak of.  For the asking price and for what you receive, this Reader's Digest set is an excellent deal for sure.  If you like programs like this one, this is highly recommended viewing.",1178755200,4,1431,4.7682926829268295
1785527,4,B00006LPDF,"This is a good introduction to many off the beaten paths of America.  In fact, the real star of the show, asie from the ubiquitous red Ford Taurus, is the scenery of America itself.  The camera and narrator takes the viewers to many places that have unique characteristics.  Unfortunately there is no interaction with the locals so we do not get a truely complete coverage of each scene, but the point of the series is to give a ""Reader's Digest"" view of places people can visit.

But excellent photography and the knack for finding out of the way events are the hallmark of this series. Each ""trip"" is actually a roundabout path that is really serveral ""family vacations"" combined into a one hour program. This is a great cure for cabin fever in the midst of a winter snowstorm.",1172275200,2,779,4.58273381294964
1785528,4,B00006LPDF,"Warning: The first three discs are IDENTICAL to the America's Great Road Trips, and Scenic Drives discs (I don't mind because I always want a good backup) minus the Road Trips discs. I don't regret getting America's Most Senic Drives (even though they are repeats on the first 3 disks) as the bonus disk of America The Beautiful makes it worth while(which is real good, but has nothing to do with the popular attraction at Disneyland). I may not regret it, but you might.",1151452800,6,471,4.619047619047619
