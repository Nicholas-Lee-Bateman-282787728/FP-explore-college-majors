7455198,1,B01617NYJE,"This could have been great.  Document the artistic process.  Show how a band in their prime write and recorded their best work.  Get inside how the use their instruments.  Communicate their personalities on film.

Instead, it's alternating scenes of fart jokes/juvenile behavior and really choppy cuts of the band playing live.  The live stuff is ok, but you are far better off watching ""Bullet In A Bible"" (if you want to see Green Day perform American Idiot) or Quatro (if you are interested in their creative approach).

This really feels like it was edited together by a 12-year-old kid who wanted to see how much bathroom humor he could weave in.  Given the guy taking the video had 9 months of access to the band, I can't believe there wasn't better material available.",1451088000,,775,4.774436090225564
7455199,5,B01617NYJE,"I bought this because I am a huge Green day fan and buy everything new from them. I had already seen the movie in theaters, and it is great and fun to watch! Great if you are a GD fan or are buying a gift for a GD fan!!",1450742400,,219,3.489795918367347
7455200,5,B01617NYJE,"This one is AHMAZING. Yes, play it f*cking loud.

I'd even say it's better than Cuatro!  The footage is really great, you really get an inside peek for sure. Totally worth watching. Worth watching again. And again. And again. And again after that. I got the poster with my order but I ordered it from the Green Day store. 100% good sh*t",1449446400,2,336,4.403225806451613
7455201,5,B01617NYJE,"Hand Like A Hand Grenade is the long awaited release of the rock documentary showing a behind the scenes look at Green Day's huge album American Idiot. Directed by John Roecker, Hand Like A Hand Grenade was shown in limited release 10 years ago but now it's here on DVD for all Green Day fans to enjoy. It shows all the members of Green Day working on songs and ideas in the studio along with their studio team including Rob Cavallo the legendary producer who actually signed them to a major label back in the day. It's really cool watching the band work in the studio and especially good to see Billie Joe Armstrong testing his song and lyric ideas and then seeing them come to fruition complete with epic rock guitar overdubs! Like a fine wine, Green Day has certainly matured into a killer rock band and have transcended the punk rock genre to become a world famous band that appeals across a range of music lovers. While it might not set the rock documentary world on fire, Heart Like A Hand Grenade is definitely essential viewing for fans of Green Day and gives you a fly-on-the-wall look at a mega band in the studio creating a career defining album.",1448323200,2,1157,4.488151658767772
7455202,4,B01617NYJE,Great and recommended for Green Day fans. Shows more of the recording process than anything else; songs were already written but a lot of cool insider footage.,1448150400,,159,4.925925925925926
7455203,5,B01617NYJE,"I'm so glad this documentary finally got released. It's amazing to be able to get an inside look at one of the greatest bands of all time at the top of their game making this historic album. If you're a fan, this film is a must see!",1447804800,3,232,3.9574468085106385
7455204,5,B01617NYJE,Fantastic. But can we PLEASE get a digital version up in this piece?,1447372800,,68,4.3076923076923075
7455205,5,B01617NYJE,"A different kind of rockumentary.  No band-ending quarrels, no deaths, no drug overdosing.  It's a wonderful depiction of an incredible band, having a blast making art.  A feel-good flick, showcasing great music, and the genius behind it.  I felt like I was at a concert, with backstage passes!  Congratulations Director John Roecker on a job well-done.",1447286400,5,353,5.232142857142857

7455210,3,B01617NYJE,"To be honest, I expected more of this long-waited documentary. There isn't so much studio footage as you may expect (even more when compared to Quatro!). A good part of it is filled with the album tracks mixed with concerts and rehearsal footages. There are no extras as well.

One thing that really upset me is the absence of any subtitles, including English.

Nonetheless, if you are a fan like me, you should watch it somehow.",1459468800,,429,4.631578947368421
7455211,1,B01617NYJE,I did not even open  it's a documentary on how the album was made when you buy it you think you're buying the DVD of a concert of American Idiot by Green Day,1459036800,,157,3.757575757575758
7455212,5,B01617NYJE,Great documentary! Any Green Day fan should watch!,1456790400,,50,5.375

8735334,5,B01617NYJE,"I could watch this everyday and not get bored. I love seeing how an album goes from just an idea to a full fledged song! There's a lot of behind the scenes, cool stuff and just the guys nailing it every time! American Idiot came out when I was 10 and it changed my life. I was going through a rough patch and these guys made me feel not so alone! At 21, I am revisiting that feeling and loving them even more! If you're a new or old fan, definitely get this DVD",1505174400,2,461,3.9148936170212765
8735335,5,B01617NYJE,Green Day fans will love this! Takes you inside the process,1494460800,,59,4.454545454545454

8735339,3,B01617NYJE,"I bought this digitally through iTunes, but I don't know if I'll buy the DVD. Let me tell you, this isn't very good as a documentary. As they said in Cuatro, which is a LOT better than this, they don't just wanna give another documentary where they sit down & reflect on the songs, which seems to be the same mentality with how they made this. Now, I was expecting to see them actually recording the album that's considered to be their magnum opus. Good for me because we don't get much of that. Just Billie Joe recording a few parts for the songs, Tre doing percussion, & the female vocalist from Letterbomb, who apparently recorded her part over the phone.
There's very little you have to get for a documentary, which I feel they got, but it lacks general focus. If there's anything I'd expect from a documentary, it's focus. You'll go scene to scene without a lot of cohesion between them. Easily half the film is them doing music video-style performances of the songs, which is done on a sound stage. You'd expect them to show Billie conducting how to record the others' parts of the songs, then have them launch into the songs, maybe do a few takes before finally doing it right. You know, get right into the creative process of the album. Nope. They just perform the songs on a sound stage.
I'll cut to the chase, I was expecting them to mix in thoughts on the album with performances, but also get down to the story & production of the album instead. Instead, what we got was a film with very little focus, or cohesion. It just seems like snapshots of the wrong moments of the recording process of the album stitched together. At the end, I was looking for at least a little introspection on the band's part of the reception of the album that launched them back into mainstream popularity after a decline in the 90s, but no. There's a scene towards the end where one of the last songs of the album plays & they have cue cards with the lyrics written on them. This would be cool if it were a better film. As is, it's completely unearned because we've heard songs throughout the film & it's just another one.
As a Green Day fan, I'm disappointed. From what I've read on the album & found out from my own countless listenings, I was expecting more. As it stands, this is not a good film on that. If you're going to watch a documentary on American Idiot, watch Broadway Idiot. That film has everything I was expecting out of this. it has analyzing the album's story, casting the cast, Billie Joe approaching being on stage on Broadway, etc. It's the better documentary in every way, yet it's not even just about the album.
This is good if you turn your brain off, but if you want decent discussion on American idiot & its impact, go look elsewhere.",1469491200,,2751,4.428007889546351
8735340,5,B01617NYJE,I was super excited when I got the DVD and couldn't wait to watch it. Its hilarious by far one of the best GD DVD its so nice to see them in the studio joking around and stuff! :) if you're thinking about buying it go do it right now!,1466726400,,234,3.7
