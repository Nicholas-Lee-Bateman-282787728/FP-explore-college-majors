7945441,4,B00005MEWB,"Like most Americans, I've never been to Cuba and have mostly thought of it as just Castro's drab, desperate island, but this film opened my eyes to the pulsating rhythm of the country, especially Havana. The film follows Sissy's quest to become a dancer at The Tropicana and her romance with a young man she meets at the legendary club. Filled with intrigue and wit, this comedy hits its all its notes like every salsa musician at the Tropicana.",1337558400,2,445,4.6455696202531644
