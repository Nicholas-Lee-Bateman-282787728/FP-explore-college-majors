2205455,5,B0007939LG,"the main reason i bought this video is because the price finally dropped. i happened to be at this - my first- world series. i watched games three and four in yankee stadium after making the long trek out from colorado in late october. i'm very experiential and had to visit ground zero. every time i'm in nyc i visit the same corner. jeter's november heroics are memorable and by kim's meltdown. he never really recovered from those home runs. kim was just traded from the colorado rockies to the marlins. unfortunately, the yankees lost that one on a luis gonzalez's bloop single off mariano rivera, but there was nothing like watching president bush throw out the first pitch, the wtc flag unfurled over yankee stadium and lee greenwood singing.",1179273600,,748,4.7615384615384615
2205456,4,B0007939LG,"Being a Yankees fan, it always baffles me that the Yankees lost the World Series of 2001.  If there ever, EVER was a year they deserved to win, 2001 was it.

I enjoyed the footage of the series as well as the interviews with the team and the family members who were impacted by the series.  This documentary will make you laugh and cry.  Above all, it will make you remember...",1164067200,3,377,4.267605633802817
2205457,2,B0007939LG,"One of the most monumental events in the history of American sports, the 2001 World Series is perhaps more worthy than any other sports topic of a comprehensive, informed and inspired film document. This film is not that document.

The premise of the filmmakers is that the New York Yankees, because they chose to play after September 11 rather than abandoning the season, should be regarded as saints. They then maintain that it was the patriotic duty of the Yankees' opponents to roll over and lose in order to improve the moods of their non-playing interview subjects (all New Yorkers). Meanwhile, the players responsible for the most courageous and inspiring performance in baseball history are cast as villains, and the city that experienced the greatest moment of sports-inspired civic pride in American history is ignored.

Here are three reasons why this World Series will be talked about in 2051 that were barely, if it all, talked about in this movie:

1. There has never been a greater contrast in the backgrounds of the two participants in a professional sports championship: the most celebrated, decorated team in American sports history against one that was only playing its fourth season. The Yankees were fielding teams when Arizona was not even a state! I would make the argument that not only was this the most important event in Arizona SPORTS history, but by way of having so little traditionally defined history, this was the biggest thing ever to happen in Arizona period!

2. By virtue of becoming the first pitcher to win three games in one series since Mickey Lolich, Randy Johnson became the unchallenged star of the series. The most spectacular pitching performer since Nolan Ryan, this series marked his transformation from star to legend. While it's unfortunate that he did not make himself available for interviews that is no reason to be giving him passing mentions instead of prominent ones.

3. There is no more magical moment in sports than a bottom-of-the-ninth come from behind rally by the home team to win the seventh game of a World Series. What will place this in the realm of the greatest sports legends is that it occurred in the context of a blown save by the greatest relief pitcher in the history of the game.

For Pete's (and Pinnacle Peak's) sake let's all hope that fans from both of these cities someday get the film about this series that they deserve.",1150675200,15,2402,4.875
2205458,5,B0007939LG,"First of all, I am not a Yankees fan, nor am I a Yankees hater.

This film, although a wee bit heavy handed at times, still brings tears to my eyes...five years since 9/11.  It is wonderful to see how a simple game of baseball helped in a small way heal a devastated city and country.

What I liked is that it did not focus on the terrorists or the attack as so much as the healing.  It was a film about resolve, not vengeance.

The interviews with the families of the victims were prominently featured, as they should.  The ballplayer interviews were to add to the feeling, but the film clearly focused on the famlilies.  This ensured that the viewer knew what was truly important.

Although as an Oakland A's fan, I get to relive the moment when Jeremy Giambi should have slid over and over again, I love that I have this in my DVD collection.

*note - as a DVD there are no special features...it's the documentary and that's it...",1144540800,13,933,4.3468208092485545
2205459,5,B0007939LG,"Being a west-coast sports fan,I have always hated the Yankees. I don't know what got me into buying this dvd but I must say that I am glad I did. This documentary is the story about the city of New York and one of their most beloved sports teams getting by one of the most horrific events in both New York and American History...9/11. If this tragedy was the illness,then the love of Yankee baseball was the cure. While watching ""Nine innings from ground zero"",my hate towards this team was put aside while watching it as I got to see the side of Yankee stars that one doesn't see off the field. From the young girl who met Derek Jeter after he learned through her letter that she lost her father in the towers...to the firefighters who put on a smile thanks to a surprise visit from Yankee players...to the group of family members of 9/11 victims who got to attend the world series,I was deeply moved by this documentary. We,the sports fans,are so used to hearing stories about too many sport stars who get in trouble with the law or stars who complain about a 7 to 8 figure contract not being enough,that we seem to forget about the few out there who have alot of good in them. The documentary even has an interview with President George Bush that I am glad was included. I don't care if the war in Iraq is right or wrong nor do I care what party he is. It is a proud moment watching the leader of your country throw out the first pitch at the 2001 World Series while the crowd chants...U-S-A...U-S-A!!! I believe this first pitch is the most memorable one on film to date. After watching Nine innings...,am I still a Yankee hater? Yeah,but I love them for bringing hope and smiles to the people of New York. This dvd is recommended to both the sports fan and non-sports fan. All will not be disappointed. ""It's a hit""!",1132617600,36,1821,4.374631268436578
2205460,5,B0007939LG,"A made-for-TV (HBO) movie that is just outstanding. It captures in a very realistic manner how the World Series in 2001 related to the horror of 9/11 the prior month. The movie also shows the human side of these famous baseball athletes in a way that we rarely see. If you are not moved by Nine Innings from Ground Zero, you need to check to see that you have a pulse.",1118707200,21,368,4.197183098591549
2205470,5,B0007939LG,The dvd brings me back to those terrible early days and weeks but it also shows how a sport like baseball can help in the healing process. I'm a Red Sox fan but only for that World Series I was rooting for the Yankees.,1379635200,,218,3.977272727272727
2205471,5,B0007939LG,This is a touching tale about a horrific event. It always brings tears to my eyes mostly because it shows us as Americans not political or sports fanatics.,1361664000,,155,4.571428571428571
2205472,5,B0007939LG,"This is a great DVD for Yankee's fans, and the ties to the horrors of 9/11 on the city of New York are what make this a great DVD. I would recommend this to anyone who still believes in the power of baseball and the human heart.",1360540800,,228,3.872340425531915
2205473,5,B0007939LG,"This product met my expectations entirely. The DVD arrived on time, in excellent condition, and the picture quality was fantastic. I got exactly what I wanted from this product.",1350000000,,177,5.137931034482759
2205474,5,B0007939LG,"In September 2001, my son was four years old. On 9/11/2008 I took him to NYC for a visit to see one of the last Yankees games in the old stadium. I showed my son (a Yankees fan) this video in order to help tell the story of 9/11 and what our country went through. We went to ground zero on the day we arrived, and the video helped him to understand what he saw. It was a great way to share a dark piece of American history while showing our resilience and the role that his beloved Yankees played in it. I recommend this video for anyone who is a baseball lover, or who just wants to see a ""feel good"" story that shows what it means to be an American.",1309046400,,651,3.9393939393939394
2205475,5,B0007939LG,"This should be shown on TV every September 11th, as Jimmy Stewart's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is shown every Christmas.  It's that good.  I was emotional throughout this entire documentary.  It's reality viewing at it's best and it doesn't matter whether you love or hate the Yankees, you'll love this movie. It's about our country and the role of baseball in it.  I loved it!",1291939200,,374,4.707692307692308
2205476,2,B0007939LG,"I read the previews for this before it ever came out, and I had to have it.  As a seasonal employee of a Major League Baseball team (not the Yankees or the Diamondbacks) I saw first hand how people congregated to the baseball parks after the tragedy of 9-11.  I saw how MLB management worked hard to be supportive during this hard time.  I saw story after story in the papers and on TV about Major League clubs helping out in any way the could; especially the Mets and Bobby Valentine spending hours into the nights helping and caring for victims and relief workers at Shea Stadium.

And yet, this video didn't really document any of that.  This video is 80% New York Yankee propaganda and 20% about baseball helping heal the nation.  I was sickened to say the least.  As I said, I worked for another MLB team at the time, and I know for a fact that no Yankee player or personnel did anything during this time to help families.  Not like the Mets did in New York.  Not like the Rangers did in Texas.  Not like so many other teams and personnel.

I was hoping for a keepsake to document and remember this hard time in American history and how baseball in general, and all Major League teams in particular, helped to bring a nation together.  To remember how proud I felt as an employee of an MLB team to have had a part in that.

But what I got was not what I expected.  Next time, please title it appropriately, or at least describe it better in the description.",1285718400,2,1462,4.3076923076923075
2205477,5,B0007939LG,"Nine Innings From Ground Zero says a lot, shows a lot.  Smiles, tears, laughter, joy, and sorrow. Narration is spot on sympathetic and poignant without being overly maudlin. Lot's of stuff in here you may have forgotten, or see for the first time.  You need not be a New York Yankees fan to feel the enormous emotion as you see our former President grace the pitcher's mound in pride, defiance, humor, and care...and throw a strike right into the heart of the enemy, and our conscience.",1234137600,3,486,4.6395348837209305
2205478,5,B0007939LG,"This is one of the best made documentaries by HBO. Among many things, it shows how baseball helped New York and America survive the shocking aftermath of September 11, 2001.",1212278400,2,173,4.8
2205479,2,B0007939LG,"This ridiculous pile of maudlin crud would be funny if it wasn't so darned sad.  First, the common theme is ""New York NEEDED this World Series in it's recovery from September 11"" and ""New York DESERVED this World Series"" and ""It was America v. Arizona,"" etc.  Never mind that the Yankees payroll was three times that of Arizona and that the Yankees had won four of the previous five October classics- nope, they were SUPPOSED to win this one because...um, well, because terrorists attacked New York, I guess.

The DVD also doubles as a campaign commercial for Rudy Giuliani, who manages to appear in WAY too many segments.  One of the most unintentionally funny moments comes when the series goes back to Arizona and one of the Mayor's spokesmen talks about the ""tough decision"" concerning whether Giuliani should fly to Phoenix to be there- ""what if we were attacked again in his absence?""  Hmm, yeah, what if? I guess NYC would have had to get by without the Mayor wandering around the rubble looking for his command center with a bullhorn in his hand.

Another great moment comes when a Pwecious Wittle Girl reads a letter she wrote to Derek Jeter about how she weally, weally woves him and hopes he wins the whole thing.  I had to pause the DVD and go brush my teeth after that part.

There's a lot more, but the message woven throughout the film remains the same- the people of NYC are Heroes who were Bent but not Broken, the New York Yankees ARE the city of NY, and it was Wrong and Bad for the Diamondbacks to win that Series.  It was as if the Terrorists had Won.

Watch the DVD with some friends for a laugh, and supply plenty of booze.  But don't invite any diabetics, this will send them into shock before the halfway mark.",1193443200,11,1735,4.493630573248407
