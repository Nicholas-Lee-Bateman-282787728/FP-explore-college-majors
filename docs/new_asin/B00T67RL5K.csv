7000851,2,B00T67RL5K,"Unremarkable but I'm going to leave my remarks... lots of nudity, attractive men, stylistically acceptable but absolutely no plot. Sexually appealing cover so I'll give it a couple stars as suitable for gay wallpaper or screen saver but sans the penis and semi-erection shots its pacing is like watching people bowl without arms.",1435622400,3,329,5.226415094339623
7000852,2,B00T67RL5K,"Soft Core Pornography more or less with a thin plot and tepid atmosphere, it was not my cup of tea. LGBT horror disappoints, but this is fundamentally flawed from direction and plotting.

Only saving grace were the choreography of the sex scenes and the intense sexual atmosphere with dark lighting. Still, a higher quality porn studio could do the same or better than this indie flop.",1435449600,6,385,4.833333333333333
7000853,5,B00T67RL5K,"Ignore the negative reviews, this is a highly erotic and sensual movie. The three leads are all very sexy and there is full nudity throughout. The plot switches between fantasy, dream sequences and reality to create and engaging and weird mystery. It's an erotic thriller and it really goes for the sex scenes too. Perhaps the negativity comes from some of the themes, looking at modern gay life, now able to get married and have children only to tear it apart. Give it a watch and enjoy the ride.",1435190400,,497,4.595505617977528
7000854,1,B00T67RL5K,"This gay vampire wannabe movie is one of the most disjointed and poorly edited films I have ever seen. Anyone who gave this movie more than two stars must have seen a different version than I did.  Our story revolves around a happy gay couple - James and Andy - who live in a fine home with a lush plant filled backyard and are both personally and sexually highly compatible with an active sex life.  Finally, James decides to propose marriage to Andy who, unfortunately, has just lost his job. Any wedding plans must be postposed as the two must now plan how to manage their more limited finances. James suggests that they take in a lodger on a temporary basis in order to augment their income until such time that Andy can gain new employment.  Reluctantly, Andy agrees.  And before you can say ""SHAZAM"", an attractive young man named Sebastian (what else?) appears and is willing to rent a room.  (Is he St. Sebastian or the Sebastian from ""Suddenly Last Summer""?) Soon Andy begins to have strange dreams and hallucinations involving Sebastian (he may have even had one before Sebastian arrived on the scene - it's a bit confusing).  In any event, it isn't long before Sebastian is using innuendo and his own naked and near naked body to undermine the relationship between James and Andy.  The latter is especially susceptible to Sebastian's presence who is also suspected of being a serial killer in the neighborhood and yet to be caught.  For the balance of the film, we are exposed to constant bedroom scenes between James and Andy (which started even before Sebastian) as the two are constantly shown in a state of nakedness even while dining (at one point Andy lies on top of a metallic island/counter in the kitchen while stark naked which made me wonder if we were going to see a maid with clorox wipes show up at any moment); scenes of Andy following a hooded figure throughout the city and walking up and down a series of ramps; scenes of Andy following a strange young man and then going into his house; scenes involving Sebastian and blood which ultimately also pulls James into the picture - and all along we cannot be certain if this is an hallucination by Andy or real. Meanwhile Andy remains jobless, fails to go to a job interview set up by James where he probably would have gotten the job for sure, and mentally deteriorates - as does his entire relationship with James.  Scenes shift so quickly from daytime to nighttime and vice versa as well as the locale that we, the viewers, cannot be sure that we are not the ones who are hallucinating.  The ending of this movie is so abrupt, so unexpected, so jarring, and without any explanation that it was as if an entire reel had been lost or left on the cutting room floor.  To say any more would be a ""Spoiler"", though this movie did enough of that on its own.  Additionally, the actors and writer/director Daniel Mansfield are so self-satisfied and self-lauditory over their own production accomplishment during the Extras interviewing scene that it truly is a head scratcher. Enough said. Cheers! Gulp!",1434844800,,3073,4.659889094269871
7000855,2,B00T67RL5K,"While this movie is loaded with great full frontals and soft core, I felt myself becoming increasingly impatient for some kind of discernible plot or story to emerge. Unfortunately, when it did, it was very shallow. The picture quality is OK but the sound editor, it there even was one, was incompetent. The soundtrack is either blasting or you are straining to hear what's being said. Oh well... Since it wasn't horrible enough to go straight into the trash, I'll just put it away until I forget what it was and watch it again one of these days.",1434499200,,546,4.581632653061225
7000856,2,B00T67RL5K,"This movie merits two stars on the basis of its photographic qualities and fine acting. Where it fails lies in its unimaginative story-line consisting of dream like or hallucinative scenes which don't cohere clearly with the reality sequences. Then it all concludes in what I call ""hanging in mid-air"". You cannot rely on scenes of sensuality alone to carry a movie There has to be a measure of logic and plot variation or twists and turns, especially in a horror film to sustain the viewer's interest. The TV series ""The Lair"" is a further example in the gay horror genre that shares similarities with this movie and possibly an influence on the film maker. To sum up...this could have had the potential of being a great movie if the writing had been more ingenious.",1434499200,9,767,4.731343283582089
7000857,3,B00T67RL5K,"Extremely sexy film but since ""horror"" is not my interest, I couldn't relate, I was unfulfilled. The male nudity is abundant but always tastefully portrayed.",1433635200,12,157,5.32

7000859,4,B00T67RL5K,"A fun twist on the vampire theme. A nice story that could have had a little more drama and less nude scenes. Yes, this is a gay film but a good story will always win. The production values were there and the actors did a fine job with their roles. I would say if you enjoy vampire themed movies get this one. A good film, just not a great one.",1433289600,5,343,3.914285714285714
7000860,5,B00T67RL5K,"This is a very erotic, sensual retelling of a modern vampire. Equal parts drama, and equal parts Horror Drama. I loved this film. I think it has a truly original take on the aspects of vampiric reality, sit inside a relationship of sex, love and erotic darkness. I absolutely loved the eye candy of the feature film. You cannot help but become a part of the story.

This is a film from the UK being brought out by the one and only company, which I am a huge fan of everything they accomplish in the film world, TLA Releasing. I honor and respect TLA because they see the world through a different reality. They give outlets to important pieces of cinema, both foreign, independent, adult oriented and cult like reality. They are a company that to me is one of the greatest companies around, because of the diversity of their products.

Drink Me is another one of those films chosen for release by TLA that I found myself thoroughly entertained, in more than one way. I have always been a huge vampire horror lover and seeing the world of sensuality, with a backdrop of the vampire legend, is a total plus to me, and this film captures that reality perfect.

I mean who wouldnt want a love triangle with a vampire.

All the beautiful men, blood, sex, weirdness. This takes the beauty of the body, the desire of the flesh, the need for blood and mixes it with the aspects of the Drive-in movie atmosphere. The film comes off with the ultimate twist, of the erotic nature.

All three stars are sexy, deep and stylistically delicious.

The plot is simple. James and Andy are lovers. A gay couple that seem to have the perfect life. But sadly that all changes when everything seems to happen at once. Andy ends up losing his job. They soon end up taking in a stranger named Sebastian as a renter. Soon Andy realizes something is not right. Someone is killing men. Could Sebastian be that killer?

7000861,1,B00T67RL5K,Terrible. Starts off decently and then dissolves into utter incoherence. The director was more interested in presenting sex scenes than telling a consistent story. This is soft core porn with aspirations it never achieves.,1465084800,,222,5.5588235294117645

7000866,2,B00T67RL5K,"My guess is the ""good"" reviews are by the artsy types.  For us average Joes and Janes, it's boring and consists of not much more than soft porn with a thin, weak plot, poor direction, and less-than-mediocre acting.  Erotic - yes.  Thrilling - not in the least.  At least the guys were decent to look at.",1460505600,,303,4.357142857142857

7000869,1,B00T67RL5K,"Awful dreck. I could actually stop there but let me continue. There seems to be a lot of soft core sex in this and that isn't terrible. The editing is horrific with cuts and moves and changes where they are so visible and pointless. The acting, if you can call it that, terrible, especially by the character of Andy with his furry and distracting belly played by Darrin Munn. The other 2, james and Sebastian were eye candy and seemed to do the best they could. Awful sound and dialog. One of the conversations took place in the kitchen and we are outside????? could not hear a thing. Very disjointed. So Emmett Friel is cute and not terrible Chris Ellis Stanton is hot and not terrible Darrin Munn is nothing to write home about and a terrible actor. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MUCK. Anyone involved in any capacity should never speak of it again. Those who gave this rave reviews....I don't get you at all.",1459382400,8,901,4.466666666666667

7000871,1,B00T67RL5K,"I am not at all impressed!  This movie phased in and out, in and out, from dream and imagination, to reality, back to dream and imagination. One of the main actors kept halucinating, and you never knew where you were in the entire movie... dream?  or reality?  never knew.  i wanted to see real stufff... and it did not happen!  this sort of stuff turns me on, but i am already living in imagination, not reality.  i don't need to see a movie that delivers mixed up signals, with more imagination, than the real thing.  big deal,  You don't know where you are at??  Reality, or halucination?  The producers try (really hard) to scare you in this movie.  it did not work!  just mixed signals, is all i got from all this.  what a mess.  Half the times, a guy was walking around with a mask.  Ok, and your point?  Not well done.  Let's see the real thing!  Try that on your next movie... some erotic scenes, and go from there.

7000872,1,B00T67RL5K,"One of the worst films I have seen -- including those made by junior high school students on their cell phones.  You usually have a lot of leeway for independent LGBT films like this, but damn!  This is utterly amateurish trash with no coherent story, abysmal acting and almost nonexistent storytelling.  Avoid this film like the vampires (or whatever the hell they are) supposedly at the heart of this film.",1453766400,5,408,4.8
7000873,5,B00T67RL5K,"I didn't read the DVD box before putting the disc in the player because I didn't want to be swayed by the hype that you usually see there...and that might have been a bad thing because for the first half-hour or so, I couldn't figure out what was going on.  The first part of the film would have made more sense and been easier to follow had I known up-front about the whole vampire thing.  Despite being hard to follow, I was riveted by this movie; I was on the proverbial edge-of-my-seat from the beginning to the end.  For me, what made this film so memorable was that the abundant nudity and sex scenes were handled in such a stylish and tasteful way, yet they were UNBELIEVABLY erotic at the same time...I don't know if that's the work of the director or the writer or the person who does the screenplay, but it was a masterful job.  This film likely won't appeal to straight men, but I recommend it highly for the rest of us.",1448496000,3,931,4.3028571428571425

7000877,1,B00T67RL5K,I was very disappointed in this movie. The story line is choppy and not well put together. I usually give a lot of latitude on this genre of film because sometimes the acting and the story shine through the low budget production.

some of the other 1-2 star reviews, as they do an excellent job at describing how I feel. I did want
to add though: this movie is so convoluted, it's like reading a book that has 24 chapters,
only to discover when you get near the end, that the last three chapters are missing; and, you
are only left with the last page. You have no character resolution, only an ending that makes
no sense. It's like the director ran out of money, or time, and had to wrap up the last 10-15
minutes of the movie in 30 seconds.",1505606400,,612,4.066115702479339

8700529,1,B00T67RL5K,"This seems to be a film that doesnt know what it wants to be.  Erotica?  For sure there are many hot scenes of an erotic nature, decidedly soft-core, yet  featuring ample nude male beauty.  But for anyone wishing to view it for pure titillation, what are they to make of the rest of the film?  Ive seen it described as Erotica with a Plot, yet the only actual plot is what we are told on the DVD cover:  young  gay couple in love; one loses his job; they take in a mysterious boarder.  There is nothing more to give away, since the viewer is never given any further concrete information from which to discern a story line.  Instead, there is an endless string of scenes representing dreams/nightmares/fantasies, for few of which we are given the slightest clue as to whether we are supposed to believe they are actually happening or if they are just being imagined by some characters possibly unhinged mind.
Since not successful at being a purely erotic teaser, who else might this film be targeted to?  It seems to want  to be a supernatural horror tale, claiming to be about the vampire next door.  But don't buy this expecting to see a story about a vampire.  First, again, there is NO STORY.  And it seems that the total vampire angle consists of a 2-second view of a characters fangs and some inexplicable splashes of blood in a few dream sequences.  (And what are we to make of the extended  fantasized? -- bloody shower scene?  Some will find it hot.)
At times the film seems to be trying to be a mystery/thriller.  There is a lot of following and running and chasing,  sometimes  -- for no clear reason  in masks.  But the chance of there being any feeling of suspense is a non-starter, since we do not know anything about what is going on and therefore do not care, although we keep hoping they might find a more coherent script when they get to wherever they are running to.
Your best bet with this film:  fast forward through most of it, and use its frequent hot nude scenes to produce the only real thrills this supposed classic erotic thriller is able to deliver on.",1485734400,,2079,4.470744680851064
