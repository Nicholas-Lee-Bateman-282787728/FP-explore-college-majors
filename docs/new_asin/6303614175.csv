7851528,5,6303614175,I STRONGLE agree that this has to made available on DVD. My VHS tape of this is deteriorated and I am sick about it. I am not interested in another VHS version. If this were in DVD format I would definitely get it right away. It is my favorite version of all of them.,1137196800,,267,3.962962962962963
7851529,5,6303614175,"I agree - it needs to be on DVD!!  I own the tape, but it gets degraded more and more all the time!  This is THE best performance of the Nutcracker EVER!

I'm not sure what the hold up is....:)  PLEASE someone with the production company - make this a dvd we can purchase!!!  THANKS",1134864000,,409,4.0
7851530,5,6303614175,"Before writing about the actual performance, it must be said that while  after Yuriy Grigorovich left the Bolshoi theater most of his productions  were replaced by newer ones. This Nutcracker is an exception. It is still  regularly performed. The cast in this ballet is almost perfect. The two  leading roles are performed by Natalya Arkipova, who was twenty six at the  time of the performance (1989) and was the company's youngest  ""star"" and Irek Mukhamedov, the most famous dancer of his  generation. The other roles are performed by the dancers who are now the  leading performers like Ilze Liepa, Alexander Petukhov and Maria Filippova.  The conducting of Alezander Kopylov is on a ver high level. The production  has some humor, in which the Drosselmeier of Yuriy Vetrov is finding his  best scenes.",965692800,8,806,5.03030303030303
