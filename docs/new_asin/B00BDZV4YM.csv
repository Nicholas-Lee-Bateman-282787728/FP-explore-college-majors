5582200,5,B00BDZV4YM,"Oh my word.  I suppose if you are scared to death of nudity it might seem like a lot but honestly I barely notice it.

On to the show... I love this show.  It is intelligent and offbeat.  Obviously that is why it only had 2 seasons.  I loved it when it first aired and I have watched it regularly every chance I could since.  Like others have mentioned each episode is more like a movie so even though there are only 2 seasons there is no ongoing plot that runs off a cliff at the end of the second season.  You don't even need to watch them in order. The other nice aspect of being shot like movies is new casts and sets and a nice assortment of stars.

I wish they would remaster these for BD because the quality of the DVD video is only so-so.",1429228800,,746,3.9932432432432434

5582205,5,B00BDZV4YM,Excellent plots story lines  and actors. British Columbia  was a perfect location to film this series. I could watch  this collection of stories  along with the narration of Kris Kristopherson time and time again.  Wish they would make some more ! The best I've ever seen.,1397001600,,272,4.826086956521739
5582206,4,B00BDZV4YM,"The Dead Man. 's Gun is a fun, modern western series shot more like a movie.  We enjoyed watching it and were impressed with the quality of writing and photography. We did think the obviously gratuitous nudity in almost every episode of the first season, was unnecessary. Unfortunately, these scenes make it necessary to curtail its' viewing by your young children.  Naturally, the gun violence is part of the scenario of the show and yet it is done with as little gore as possible without ruining the impact of such violence in the storyline. Since the show appears to be filmed somewhere in Canada, it is raining a good portion of the time. This is one case of outsourcing that is common these days and it would serve the industry well to bring back movies and TV shows which are filmed in the U.S.A.",1391212800,5,802,4.5625
5582207,1,B00BDZV4YM,"I personally believe that when one has a good movie they do not need to resort to gratuitous nudity, profanity or violence. This series just throws in gratuitous female nudity whenever it can. I just gets so old. Sorry I purchased this.",1390262400,2,236,4.642857142857143
5582208,4,B00BDZV4YM,"Henry Winkler knew what he was doing with this show.
I'm not one to watch series that don't connect from episode to episode.
I'd still recommend it to us baby boomers that grew up with old west tv shows. This doesn't meet the slick Wild Wild West, nor the Rifleman.. It's kind of a mix of  4-5 'oldish' westerns with an updated filming style and quite clever writing.",1382486400,,367,4.397058823529412

8566854,4,B00BDZV4YM,"Not a bad series, but has a drawback. The things I liked about the series is that it's a Western. (Same town prop, but you have to overlook that.) The series brings moral lessons to the forefront on how one should live their life. It has a pretty nice set, good costume work, a good feel to the entire series. If you enjoy Westerns you'll probably enjoy the series, it has a lot to offer the fan of the genre. Each of the shows has unique characters and actors in them, a bit amazing that there are so many unknown actors available for each of the episodes - you'll see some famous faces too as well.

The thing I didn't appreciate about the series is basically the same moral lesson is taught over and over again. This makes the series like a set of short stories - that are only linked through the fact that the same gun appears in each story. The lesson being learned is basically the same, self righteousness, arrogance, greed; these will bring one's downfall.

The challenge for the writers was to create various scenarios, and characters, who are coming at the lesson from a different angle - one that could have hypothetically existed in the West. I'm glad I purchased, watched (then passed along) the series (consisted of Seasons 1 and 2), but I could see why it would be hard to make this a long running series. The story line tough to carry.",1514764800,,1351,4.421686746987952
8566855,5,B00BDZV4YM,I love this series.  It has been called a western with a twist of Twilight Zone and indeed it is.,1492041600,,97,3.85

8566857,5,B00BDZV4YM,"This serial is a wonderful combination of the very best 1950's westerns and outer limits.  Even if you didn't like westerns or Outer Limits, you will love Dead Man's Gun!!!",1466553600,,172,4.733333333333333

8566861,5,B00BDZV4YM,"Terrific, can't say enough about the photography, the plots, the clarity of sound, etc.  Some installments are better than others, of course, but a home run in all IMO.  You can start anywhere in the series and get the idea, season two is just as good.",1444780800,,252,4.456521739130435
