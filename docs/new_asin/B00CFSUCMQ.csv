8655820,5,B00CFSUCMQ,Love it!!!,1485648000,,10,4.5
8655821,4,B00CFSUCMQ,My daughter and I have this workout on a regular rotation. If I use a two 10 lb weights (I don't own bells) I can get in a nice well rounded toning. He often talks a bit between sets so I usually do 15-20 reps for his 1. Overall a great addition to any workout routine,1477267200,,268,3.8035714285714284
8655822,5,B00CFSUCMQ,Great workout fast moving and a really good demonstration of how you can really build muscle and lose fat with kettlebells.,1453593600,,123,4.904761904761905

8655825,5,B00CFSUCMQ,This guy is incredibly fit!  I really worked up a sweat and was very challenged by most of the workouts. I highly recommend it!,1436140800,,127,4.291666666666667
8655826,3,B00CFSUCMQ,"It's a very good workout video.  Mike is very engaging and breaks everything down very well. This isn't really a kettlebell workout though.  Most of the exercises are dumbbell exercises replaced with kettlebells. There are a few Classic kettlebell movements like swings, renegade rows, and presses.  Two words though. Man Makers.........Holy Crapola...Really...Just plain ridiculously brutal.  The Man Maker segment is an insanely high intensity workout and worth the cost of the rental on its own. The video quality is good.  The background is good.  I liked everything about this video except it lacked a lot of kettlebell fundamental movements that you would expect in a workout video.  IE: Turkish Get Ups, Snatches, Cleans, Windmills, etc.  Overall great workout but not recommended if you are looking for any type of RKC instruction.  I would strongly recommend renting this at the very least and giving it a try.  This is one of the better ones out there.",1430438400,2,962,5.148387096774194
8655827,5,B00CFSUCMQ,"This workout is incredible and tough.  Great cardio workout.  Love the NYC skyline backdrop.  I feel like I'm in New York.  Nice guy, too.",1425168000,,138,4.625
8655828,5,B00CFSUCMQ,"Wow! This guy is amazing and the NYC backdrop is so cool.  I really sweat when I do this workout.  I highly recommend it if you're into a powerful kettlebell cardio workout.  I've never done man makers before, but I'm up for the challenge!!",1421539200,,240,4.409090909090909
