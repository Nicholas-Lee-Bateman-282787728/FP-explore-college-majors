2629864,5,B000H6SXYW,"If you are a fan of Martin Clunes, you will want to buy this series, and 2,3,4 and 6 to finish!",1374796800,4,95,3.5714285714285716
2629865,3,B000H6SXYW,"Strictly for the under 16 set.  The enfant terrible is overdone.  Clunes is capable of a lot better, or maybe not.",1370649600,,114,4.380952380952381
2629866,5,B000H6SXYW,"Crude, rude and hilariously funny!!!! Its hard to sum up this series, I guess one way is you have to have an open mind to what goes on in the mind of blokes.",1360454400,,157,3.787878787878788
2629867,5,B000H6SXYW,I have every episode on tape-it was time to get them on DVD.  Quality is fine. We are now fans of Martin Clunes and have gotten into Doc Martin,1354579200,,143,3.9310344827586206
2629868,5,B000H6SXYW,I am a big fan on Martin Clunes and wanted to see the series that brought him fame. As a woman it took me a while to get used to the episodes. I really love them now and get a big kick out of the dancing at the end of each episode.,1333152000,3,231,3.4615384615384617
2629869,5,B000H6SXYW,"The humor is timeless and some of the best comedy I've seen in a while. I love British humor, but somehow never heard of this series until recently. Catch some of season 3 or 4 on YouTube if you want an idea of what it's like. Each year gets better and better!",1297123200,2,260,4.019230769230769
8137136,3,B000H6SXYW,not as good as Doc Martin series,1482883200,,32,3.7142857142857144
8137137,4,B000H6SXYW,"I love Martin Clunes, especially in Doc Martin.  This was a little silly-sort of slapstick.  It's still fun to see Martin Clunes in other things.",1471478400,,145,4.76
8137138,5,B000H6SXYW,Darling - yet bawdy - show with a young Martin Clunes.  Absolutely loved the dancing at the end credits...,1462147200,,106,4.578947368421052
8137139,3,B000H6SXYW,"It arrived in a timely manner.
Martin Clunes character was a far departure from his more recent role as Doc Martin!  Oh well he was younger then.",1441497600,,145,4.37037037037037
8137140,2,B000H6SXYW,Not as entertaining.  Quality was a disaster as far as DVD.,1425859200,,59,4.363636363636363
8137141,4,B000H6SXYW,"It was a gift.  Very well received, but haven't heard anything additional.  It arrived in perfect condition and on time.  Thank you!",1407974400,,132,4.909090909090909
8137142,5,B000H6SXYW,"How can you not love Gary and Tony - - they are such losers at times that you heart grows fond of them.  They are both just lovable in their own sort of way.  I came a Martin Clune from Doc Martin and accidently stumbled over Men Behaving Badly (UK verison) and stayed up for 2 weekends straight watching every episode ----wheew, that's a lot of watching!!  I ENJOYED EVERY minute of it.... I'm starting to re-watch them again too!",1395014400,,431,4.3625
8137143,5,B000H6SXYW,"Martin Clunes is the best no matter whether he is Doc Martin , Mr. Chips , William the undertaker or many more. This series is great but the British version is the only way to go.",1390953600,3,179,4.0
8137144,5,B000H6SXYW,"I love anything that Martin Clunes is in. He's a brilliant actor. To me he is the best! All his movies and TV performances  show how incredibly versatile he is as an actor. I wish all the series of Men Behaving Badly were in a set like most of ""Doc Martin.""",1386374400,4,257,4.03921568627451
8137145,3,B000H6SXYW,"NOT MY TASTE IN PERFORMING.  EITHER GENDER OR AGE DEMOGRAPHICS WERE
