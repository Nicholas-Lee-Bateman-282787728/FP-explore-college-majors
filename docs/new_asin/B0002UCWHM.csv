8031934,1,B0002UCWHM,"This video was a little bit weird. Not good quality and the characters are almost scary looking.
 If you are looking for a good video to help you teach your kids the rosary i recommend the Brother Francis dvd series.",1445299200,,216,4.4
8031935,5,B0002UCWHM,Item arrived in time. It comes with English and Spanish audio.,1433635200,,62,4.7272727272727275
8031936,5,B0002UCWHM,"my daughters love this! we started watching in on EWTN but recently canceled cable so I needed to find this video! At first I was surprised that it doesn't do the ""whole"" rosary. But it's great for learning about the mysteries and the basic gist of the rosary. Little ones can be lost during the meditation aspect of the rosary. One of each prayer teaches the layout without losing them in the repetition. It was easy to explain that when we say the rosary we say one Hail Mary per little bead and one Our Father on the big bead. The video quality is a bit odd but they love it anyway. They ask to watch it all the time.",1412553600,,620,4.175
8031937,5,B0002UCWHM,"I had ordered this a few years ago when my son was younger.  After much use, it got scratched, so decided to order a new one for both my daughter and son.  It arrived in a very timely manner, included the luminous mysteries, and was great for a long vacation trip in our van!  My kids love it!",1371686400,,293,4.017241379310345
8031938,3,B0002UCWHM,"While I highly recommend EWTN products for their faithfulness to the Church, this video is not what I expected.  I was looking for a kids rosary video that we could watch as a family as we prayed the rosary.  This video does not include the prayers for the full rosary, but only one Our Father, one Hail Mary and one Glory Be for each decade.  My two year old daughter does enjoy watching it, and it does a nice job introducing the mysteries of the rosary to kids, but we don't use it for family prayer as I had hoped.",1355356800,,518,4.16
8031939,4,B0002UCWHM,"This is a great way to introduce your kids to the rosary.  The entire video is too slow to hold the attention of a child in its entirity, thus I usually watch the video in segments with my children.  A great choice for Catholic homes.",1332115200,,234,4.177777777777778
