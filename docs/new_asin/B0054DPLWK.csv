4566611,4,B0054DPLWK,"****UPDATED REVIEW****
So FF a year later. I put the DVD up after his first couple viewings because he didn't like it. On his 3rd birthday I remembered it & popped it in (before his party). He LOVES it! I'll admit, even I like it now. ""Where is the cake?"" Is our favorite. I still don't like them changing some of the lyrics tho, hence the 4*'s.

*ORIGINAL REVIEW*

My son has ALL of Laurie Berkner CDs & Loves them all. I purchased ""Party Day"" for my just turned 2yo who LOVES Laurie Berkner's other 2 DVD's. He dances & sings along with the music (you should see it!) I came home & put it in our DVD player. He stood there & looked at the TV. I didn't like the movie format but it's not for me, I'm judging from my 2yo. I FF to ""This Hat"". He loved it! & that was it. He liked ""We Are The Cookie Bakers Of The Night"" (at the end of the DVD) but wondered off a couple of times during that song. They don't show a lot of kids, mostly the band which may be some of the reason he didn't get into it. For some reason they thought toddlers would prefer to watch a bunch of middle aged people dancing around instead of kids. Whatever.  After he left to play in his room I turned it off & put on ""Let's Hear It For The Laurie Berkner Band"" & he started clapping. He's now jumping around singing ""5 Days Old"". I should've listened to the other reviewer & skipped this one.

One thing I did like was that the songs are seperated by 3 categories: Costume Party, Birthday Party & Pajama Party. One thing I didn't like is that they TOTALLY CHANGED ""Last Night I Had A Dream"" vocally & tha lyrics! That was one of MY favorites! :(",1334016000,,1618,4.06269592476489
4566622,5,B0054DPLWK,"Our children love this DVD...and I admit, so do I! The songs, as usual, are catchy and unique, even for adults.  This is the 2nd LBB DVD we own and both and huge favorites at our house. We are especially excited to see Laurie perform live this weekend! I recommend her music to all my friends with young children.",1331164800,,313,4.305084745762712

4566624,5,B0054DPLWK,"I purchased this video for my 2 year old grandaughter.  I read all the reviews on various music videos and decided on this Laurie Berkner video and I couldn't be more pleased.  She loves it; the music is wonderful, the storyline hold her interest and is educational as well.  One of the best I've purchased.",1330214400,,307,4.545454545454546

4566626,5,B0054DPLWK,"I have two toddlers and have come to know Laurie and her band somewhat later than most.  I was given this DVD as a gift and felt impressed enough by it to actually throw my review on Amazon (I love Amazon).  I was blown away by the overall production quality.  Other than a few minor glitches (the CD seemed to stick at points but I remedied this by wiping with a clean towel), the music was excellent and the sound of the band was impressive.  Of special note, the orchestrally sounding Pillow Land, and Cookie Bakers - which is so imaginative. I have heard some of Laurie's earlier CDs, but the enormous wall of sound on this DVD far exceeds what I had heard.  Well done.",1328745600,2,673,4.309523809523809
4566627,5,B0054DPLWK,"Both of my 2 year olds love this DVD.  They love Laurie Berkner period and Mommy and Daddy don't mind listening to it over and over.  They have taught them to count forward and backwards.  She has encouraged them to learn body parts as well.  We got this DVD for their birthday and they instantly started singing the songs.  They love listening to it.  Infact, my daughter and I sang happy birthday all through the grocery store today as people smiled and chuckled at us.  Highly recommend anything by Laurie Berkner!",1324857600,,517,4.615384615384615
4566628,5,B0054DPLWK,"We just got this for my son's third birthday and it's a hit.  It took me a few plays to start loving it, but once the songs became familiar to me, I'm really enjoying it and so is our son.  We particularly love the songs Where is the Cake?, Party Day and Goodnight. Which works out well because those are 3 of the 5 songs on the audio CD. Yay!  My son and I laugh and laugh asking ""what are we waiting for????"" about the cake.  Which was also a hit since the DVD was presented the day of my son's party.  It all tied together well.

This is our first DVD of LB (we have some audio ones).  I really appreciate the quality of her music.  Lyrics are whimsical, tender and fun without dummying down for kids.  The melody and musical style are pleasing for adults too.  They seem like people you'd want to be friends with as a parent.  I've been playing Where is the Cake in the car even when my son is not there!  That should tell you something right there.

UPDATE:  We've had this for a few more weeks and I must say, we love it SO much!  Songs that didn't make an impression on me initially are so charming and wonderful. It just gets better and better with each play. The songs have a depth and sweetness.  We love This Hat and Pillowland.  Well really we just love it all!",1323734400,5,1273,4.109756097560975

I don't know how she does it, but she makes the wackiest songs with the best beat and you just get happy listening to her, I'm not kidding! I ordered a couple of her dvd's and a cd for the car, for him (and me :) If you have never heard her before, and you have a grandchild from 1-12, they will LOVE any CD or DVD you buy of Laurie Berkners, ANY!

4566631,5,B0054DPLWK,"My 3 1/2 year old and 2 year old daughters LOVE this DVD.  They ask to watch it daily.  They love to dance to the music and learn the songs.  My husband and I love the music on it, too.  It's a win-win for the whole family.  The short music CD that comes with it is disappointing, but we didn't order it for that, so I didn't decrease the rating because of it.",1317945600,,360,3.8767123287671232
4566632,4,B0054DPLWK,My daughter who's disabled loves to watch this video.  She loves to watch Laurie Berkner over and over. I recommend purchasing this video if your child loves Laurie.  By the way it also comes with a music CD that your child can listen to in the car.,1317513600,10,249,4.276595744680851

4566634,5,B0054DPLWK,"My 3 yr old twins (girls) and my 7 year old son have not stopped watching this since it came in the mail last week.  They have all the words memorized and sing and dance along to every single song, doing all the movements.  No other music DVD has affected them in this way! Like another reviewer, I find myself singing the songs (even when the DVD isn't playing) and too, sing the goodnight song to the kids at bedtime. Well done, Laurie and Band!",1314835200,,447,4.247058823529412
4566635,5,B0054DPLWK,Another hit video from Laurie Berkner band.  My 2yr old child loves it and follows along with all the songs/dances.  Highly recommend it.,1314662400,,137,4.913043478260869

4566638,5,B0054DPLWK,"DVD was shipped promptly in New condition.  Our twin boys Love Laurie and her band, colors, shaped, laughing and expressions.  She is wonderful and has been a great part of our boys growing.  Thank You Very Much Amazon!",1314489600,,219,4.7105263157894735
4566639,5,B0054DPLWK,"Our 2 year old daughter absolutely LOVES this DVD!  The animation is really well done, and the songs are all original and fun.  The main portion of the DVD lasts about 30 minutes and definitely holds our toddler's attention.  She sings, dances, stomps, jumps and claps through the whole thing.  She'll even sing the songs when she's not watching the DVD (to be honest, I find myself singing them too).  In fact, the Goodnight song is so cute that it's become something  we sing together before she goes to bed.  Don't hesitate to buy Party Day.  You'll have as much fun watching your kids as they do watching Laurie!",1314144000,,616,4.587155963302752
4566640,2,B0054DPLWK,"Our 18 month old grandson is a huge fan of Laurie Berkner.  We give her DVD for baby gifts, birthday gifts, etc.  So we were excited to see that a new Laurie DVD was out.  The grandson has his own remote control (non-operative, but he doesn't know that).  After about 5 minutes of watching the new DVD he was shaking his head ""no"" and clicking his remote controller.  We thought perhaps he was disappointed because one of his favorite Laurie DVDs was not playing, but as we watched it seemed that the production, the plan, the directing was not up to the same level as previous DVDs.  In fact, in the opening song it appears that the filming might be done with a hand held video camera.  The picture was bouncing and the first songs seem to be a little frantic for our little guy.  Earlier videos have us spoiled with their smooth production and softer approach.  We are still big Laurie fans, just not of this video.  Maybe this is for older preschoolers/children??",1313539200,3,966,4.5
8456594,5,B0054DPLWK,"Laurie Berkner gets a lot of air time in our home! The kids love singing and dancing to her silly songs, and she is one of the few children's artists that don't drive the adults in the house completely bonkers. The cookie bakers song is always guaranteed to leave my little ones rolling on the floor, laughing. Great video!",1522972800,,323,4.491525423728813

8456596,5,B0054DPLWK,My daughter absolutely loved this DVD by Laurie Berkner. She is only 2 years old but she has actually learned a lot from this video. I actually enjoy watching this video with her. It's not annoying like some of those other kids music dvds out there.
