8350368,4,B002498ZIY,"Good quality dvd the title tho was misleading episodes 1-30 when actually it was only up to episode 20 and only half of it was shown not the entire episode.
In the original East of Eden (Korean series) there were 56 episodes so there will be probably 2 more of these dvds that will be out to complete the series.
Some of the english subs were missing on some episodes as well otherwise it was a good show.
Thanks for the opportunity to do a review.",1241049600,,448,4.22093023255814

Excellent Drama. Considering the low price I paid for this series I was very suprise to see the quality of the sets and the english subtitles are excellent.",1239494400,,378,8.0
