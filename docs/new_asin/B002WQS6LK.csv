EVERY individual, from 5 to 110 is really missing out if they are too carless (could care less) with their lives to invest the time (and the ridiculously low financial investment) to change their lives, attitudes, and families in this timeless wisdom.  Your life, your choice, but don't let it be your loss to miss this (or ANY Jim Rohn presentation!). If you don't care about your own life, at least get it for your kids!  They might as well have a fantastic life, even if you don't want one!  Dave (in Colorado)  (And sorry...VHS excuse doesn't work.  You can find a vcr for about $5. bucks at any Salvation Army!).",1460505600,,719,4.658730158730159
