1605533,1,B00005JXZA,"I've become keen on re-connecting with 'Underdog' recently, but if I read the many low-star ratings for what is available astutely, then why would I want to be so keen ? Apparently, someone needs to re-evaluate their firm stance. I'll keep my money until something interesting comes along. Then I'm all over it !",1158451200,,312,4.796296296296297
1605534,5,B00005JXZA,"Bought this after seeing Under Dog T-shirt on co-worker.  Used the set for car ride and to keep grandchildren happy in small condo.  They giggled all through it and the parents happily reminisced about when they watched it on TV.  I (the senior citizen), loved seeing it again as well. ""There's no need to fear, Under Dog is here"" again!!!

PS It has been watched over and over again since 1st viewing.",1156464000,,402,4.541666666666667
1605535,2,B00005JXZA,"The title of the product gives the impression that the contents will be the complete series of Underdog.  Afterall, is that not what the collector would want?  However, all in all, it is about 11 episodes, which is sadly disappointing.

There is no continuity between the episodes, no obvious reason for the grouping, nothing but a quick assembly and package job in hopes of suckering an old fan into buying just a piece of what he really wants.

As has been stated here, there are none of the ""cliffhanger"" episodes, which is both a plus and a minus.  The little cartoons were most enjoyable, and the handful we are given is a sad sampling and a sorry excuse.  However, on the other hand, it is nice to be able to watch an entire episode of Underdog without being interrupted.

But again, beware of this product, as it is nothing more than a tease.  I suggest not buying it now, but rather waiting until the whole series is released on DVD, to save having to pay for the same thing twice.",1152662400,,989,4.455555555555556
1605536,5,B00005JXZA,"While I agree that it would be great to have Underdog and friends in the original format and line-up, this set is by far the best yet of the caped, canine crime-fighter. I had the VHS videos of Underdog and they were a mishmash of episodes along with what the box notes called ""cliff-hanger"" cartoons.

The problem with cliff-hanger cartoons is that they continue in multiple episodes or shows (Rocky and Bullwinkle followed that format). So VHS tapes were too short to show entire story arcs. Not so with these DVDs, which combine 'toons from the various VHS videos. Because the art looks similar, viewers often mistake Underdog for a Jay Ward cartoon (Rocky and Bullwinkle, George of the Jungle), but it was made by Total Television.

Tennessee Tuxedo, probably Total's second most successful cartoon series (with Don Adams of Get Smart and Inspector Gadget voicing the scheming Penguin, Tennessee) also appears in the ""cliff-hanger"" 'toons ""bonus"" section of the DVD. At one point Total joined with Leonardo Productions to package their cartoons together for syndication, so you also get the rare King Leonardo Show with Odie Coloney, Biggy Rat and Itchy Brother, Commander McBragg and The Hunter.

Three DVDs were produced in this series, and this is a great deal with all three in a box set. They include some of the best episodes like the multi-part ""Great Zot,"" presented in its entirety. Underdog featured a narrator and great voice actors, including Wally Cox as humble, loveable shoeshine boy AKA Underdog. Simon Bar Sinsister serves up an endless parade of diabolical devices, along with other aptly-named villains like Riff Raff. An all time classic and regardless of its deviations from the TV format, well-worth owning.",1146787200,,1733,5.0524475524475525
1605537,1,B00005JXZA,I must agree with the other reviewers that this set is awful as it does no show the episodes in the original clifhanger form as shown on TV. I will be the first in line to buy underdog when it is produced as it was ORIGINALLY shown with all the shorts like tennessee tuxedo and commander mcbragg and with the cliffhangers. Come on guys give us the original show as it should be and this set will fly off the shelves. Until then you can keep this junk.,1143158400,,451,4.136363636363637
1605538,2,B00005JXZA,"ANOTHER American cultural icon from the 60's has been

deemed unacceptable by those who would prefer to see

malice where none exists.

Not even Underdog can escape the slings and arrows of

those with the same mentality as the book-burners of

1930's Germany.

Why do we allow such obvious Orwellian ""Newsspeak"" to

edit our past? Come on... this IS a cartoon, for Pete's

sake, NOT some social/political statement.

Nothing here needs to be edited or ""cleaned up"". These

are simple ""good vs. evil"" stories with a happy ending,

and should be offered in their entirety... music/songs,

1605539,4,B00005JXZA,"I was very pleased with my purchase, a gift for my grandchildren, and found the speed with which I received my purchase as well as the condition of the purchase, excellent. The cartoons have brought a new generation much pleasure.",1128816000,,230,4.775

1605602,1,B00005JXZA,"The One Law of Marketing is ""Give people what they want."" As should be obvious from the other reviews, this release is definitely NOT what people want. The cartoons themselves are, frankly, not very good, but the show has a certain gentle charm and strong nostalgic appeal to Boomer pocketbooks.

The archival releases of Looney Tunes, the Simpsons, Jonny Quest, Top Cat and other classic animation has certainly raised the bar, but that doesn't mean that cartoons of lesser quality can't compete and sell well. But to do so, they have to (repeat after me) ""Give people what they want."" And what people want is to recreate the feelings they remember: Saturday mornings, plopped in front of the TV, slurping the flavored milk from the bottom of the cereal bowl. Bits and pieces won't do any more. If Golden don't get that, then they should hire someone who does. Then they can sit back, congratulate themselves on their extreme cleverness, and count their money.

One last note: I'm all in favor of minority opinions; sometimes important things can be learned from them. But the idea that there is racist, religionist or anything-ist sentiment in Underdog is just plain wrong. Like beauty, ugliness is in the mind of the beholder.",1105142400,,1229,4.875598086124402
1605603,5,B00005JXZA,"""Underdog"" was one of my all-time favorite cartoons back in the day, and this DVD trio has a nice sampler of the canine crusader's finest. From the three-eyed aliens on Planet ""ZOT"" to the metal-munching cloud-men in ""Silver Thieves"" and, of course, regular bad guys Simon Bar-Sinister and Riff Raff, nothing ever beats Underdog: ""I am the hero who never fails/I cannot be bothered with those details!"" Kids who appreciate a tongue-in-cheek superhero will love ""Underdog"", and adults will go for the Jay Ward-style humor and animation (with that pleasantly-crude look courtesy of the Mexican ""Bullwinkle"" artists). Eight ""Underdog"" episodes- shown as full 15-minute segments, not the original four-part format- are paired with mini-adventures and the oft-forgotten supporting shorts from the unsung Total TV stable. Of these, I loved both ""Tennessee Tuxedo""- with Don Adams as the plucky penguin and Larry Storch as absent-minded professor P.J. Whoopee, plus quick-and-witty science/history lessons to boot- and ""Go Go Gophers"", a neat little Western spoof with the two ""brave braves"", Ruffled Feathers (he's the one who talks in whoops) and Running Board, as the un-PC Indian heroes. (Was this the inspiration for ""F Troop?"") Presented in surprisingly-good color, with a great cast of New York-accented voices including Adams, Storch, Wally Cox (of course) and Allen Swift (check out his ""Jimmy Durante"" voice on King ZOT!), and featuring the most rousing theme song in cartoon history, you'll learn why I've had an Underdog magnet on my fridge for 20 years.

This is classic guilty-pleasure stuff for big and little kids alike: ""It's a bird- it's a plane- it's a frog! (A frog?)/ Not plane, not bird, nor even frog- it's just little ol' me (crashes into airplane)...Underdog!""",1103587200,,1778,5.282685512367491
1605604,5,B00005JXZA,"This is the most honestly pure woven collection of ideas for little kids. Wally Cox has got to have the catchiest tone of voice I've ever heard. Nobody else could've done it as well as him. I hope I see Underdog in heaven. It's hiphiphip and away I go. And what about the Jerry Stiller look a like with that Riff Raff guy/dog? Doon,Dototoon,Dototon,DototoonAhwhooAwhoo. Makes me think of that Frankenstein giant everytime.",1091059200,,422,4.875
1605605,2,B00005JXZA,"Did I miss something that the other reviewers saw? Or did I get a defective DVD set? This set would have been alot better if Classic Media kept Underdog as the original TV series. Each Underdog episode was initially shown as a serial with cliff-hangers. In between each cliffhanger was a short like Tennesse Tuxedo. What Classic Media did was to run each episode in one complete uninterrupted showing. This takes away from the original series' charm. The ""Cliffhanger episodes"" are banished into the features section which is a shame because the cliffhangers are classics in and among themselves. The features would have been better if they interviewed some of the actors such as Don Adams or even some of the people involved with the production such as Howard Stern's father, Ben. Instead you get co-creator Joe Harris' creepy account of a never before seen Underdog episode written for two girls.",1079740800,,898,4.953642384105961
1605606,4,B00005JXZA,"Most of the time, I cringe when I see my old favorite shows that I haven't seen in years.  After watching these DVDs, I was pleasantly surprised that Underdog still brings a smile to my heart.
These DVDs were packaged both separately and together as this box set.  They are NOT the complete series, which ran for a lengthy 120 episodes over 7 seasons.
There really isn't a single clunker in this small selection of episodes whose plots range from the standard evil-invention-of-the-week (The Vacuum Gun) to the moral tale about standing up to evil (The Witch of Picayoon, my favorite episode) to alien slapstick (Zot).
If anything, I was disappointed because each disc was over so quickly and left me wanting more.  On each disc, there are teasers to ""Episodes available on VHS"" but these either never existed or are out of print.",1076716800,,830,4.75
1605607,5,B00005JXZA,"When I was just a little boy, my heart was filled with glee whenever my friend Underdog appeared on my TV.  From lovable, humble shoeshine boy to dynamic flying hound, no better television show for childhood could be found.  Now that I am older, I find (oh happy glee) that Underdog can once again be seen on my TV.  This Collector's Set Edition, so carefully restored, can once again be purchased, to view or just to hoard. But I have a niece and nephew, ages four and six, just about the age to love this canine's cartoon tricks.  I think that they will be amazed and find it quite sublime to make friends with an Underdog who lyrically fights crime.  So let's lift a toast to Underdog, a hero for all time, and I hope you will forgive me for reviewing this in rhyme.",1070928000,,769,4.3125
1605608,4,B00005JXZA,"I have not seen UNDERDOG since it came on in the mid-60's. That theme song still gets to me.
 It is interesting that Shoeshine speaks in prose while Underdog speaks in rhyme. Yes, some of the lines could have been done a little better, but who cares? This is for the children, not editors.
 My youngest now want me to get copies of every UNDERDOG possible. They love the simple stories of how any underdog(aka any nobody) can win by doing the right thing.
 I am glad to see these things from a little simpler childhood brought back. Things are too complex today.",1063238400,,562,4.436893203883495

1605690,5,B00005JXZA,"I LOVE Underdog and i'm almost 13! My mom wached it when she was about six years old and she remembered every episode. So I was watching TV one day and I saw the episode'From Hoppless to Helppless' and immediatly loved Underdog. I love the plots in this DVD collection. I don't really mind the""Cliffhanger""cartoons
being in the DVD's at all.
I gave this DVD collection 5 stars for the best plots since Mickey Mouse In'The Brave Little Tailor'.",1054857600,,443,4.620253164556962
1605691,5,B00005JXZA,If you are someone who grew up watching the faded reruns of the courageous canine you will be stunned by the rich colors and stereophonic sound of the digitally remastered episodes of this animated classic. The cliffhangers and original episode titles may be gone but the edits are smooth making this collection of DVD's nearly perfect. A five star collection with enough pluses like the once missing and very memorable theme song and opening credits. The reasonably priced videos are also worth adding to your collection because additional cartoon adventures of Underdog are on the tapes.,1051315200,,589,5.145833333333333
1605692,5,B00005JXZA,"This has to be the best entertainment investment I have made this year. Looking at these old cartoons really takes me back to my youth filled days sitting in my grandmother's kitchen eating lunch and watching the re-runs of Underdog. The short cartoons, are also awesome to view again. This gets 5 stars for nostalgic and general purposes. My five year old nephew sits down and watches them with me, and he loves the cartoons. And this is a little guy growing up on the new He-Man, Pokemon, Digimon, and the new Transformers. This was well worth the money if you are into this type of nostalgic scene and want to be a kid again in your own time.",1040860800,,645,4.428571428571429
1605693,3,B00005JXZA,"UNDERDOG is a fun frolic for those who remember the cartoon about the shoe-shine boy who has an alter ego. The adventures on this DVD brought back a few memories. There are even special features that include episode listings and cliff hangers along with other short cartoons.
The voices are witting and the rhyming is clever but it has a few signature trademarks that once you see it, will be the start of many great memories.
A fun and inexpensive DVD with a few extras for the kids and adults. (11-29-02)",1039132800,,506,4.571428571428571
1605694,5,B00005JXZA,"WOW!
Underdog is one of those shows that doesn't get nearly the attention it deserves.  It's been decades since I've seen or heard anything about the show.  As such, I was surprised at all the little gems hidden in these classic shows.  I loved seeing things like Simon Barsinister ""The meanest man in the world"", creating machines to help him ""rule the world"".  Do you remember some of them?  Like his machine designed to shrink everyone in the world to 6 inches tall?  ""With my new shinking gun, I'll be the tallest man in the world!""
It was great re-living those great memories again.",1032566400,,587,4.596153846153846
1605695,5,B00005JXZA,"Underdog was one of the great underrated cartoons of the 60s. Until recently, it was fondly remembered only in the memories of those of us who were children at the time. Now this collection is quite good. Riff Raff (never was sure whether he was a dog or a wolf) was one of my favorite villans and the ""Just in Case"" episode is a fond memory of mine. Good choice. I just hope that other forgotten cartoons of this era (Courageous Cat& Minute Mouse, Deputy Dawg, Go Go Gophers, Klondike Kat, Groovy Goolies, Everything's Archie, Tennessee Tuxedo, King Leonardo, etc. ) will someday see the light on video. As the great Wally Cox (voice of Underdog) used to say-""When Polly's in Trouble I am Not Slow-It's Hip Hip Hip and Away I go!""",1031875200,,731,4.503759398496241
1605696,3,B00005JXZA,I thought that this one was rather bare compaired to the last 2 releases... I thought that it could have had more episodes but the one like liked the most was the one about the witch who put Polly asleep for one thousand years... Other then that I did not like this one as well as the other ones...,1031702400,,298,4.067796610169491
1605697,5,B00005JXZA,"I recall as a child watching every episode of Underdog.
my favorite episodes were the one's with Simon Barsinister and Riff Raff.
also, as a Jewish person I see nothing anti-Semitic or racist in any of the Underdog episodes.
the politically correct person who referred to Underdog as ""racist/anti-semitic"" is obviously the type of individual that probably sees everything as racist in society.
in my humble opinion, Underdog was nothing more then a very entertaining cartoon for kids that was basically a spoof of superman with Sweet Polly Purebred representing Lois Lane.",1030665600,,572,5.228260869565218
1605698,5,B00005JXZA,"Underdog was one of my favorites when I was five years old, and watching the DVD reissues brought back wonderful memories. I ordered these for my son who is five years old as a means of obtaining quality programming in the English language. We are living in Germany where Underdog is relatively unknown. My son was fascinated by the episodes, watching them with wonderful childlike awe, not bored at all. And I enjoyed the occasional references to the adult world (Lucitanic, Hopeless Diamond, etc.). I'm glad I ordered this set.
Before ordering I checked the Amazon customer ratings of the individual DVDs. I, too, think it's a shame that the cliffhanger episodes were spliced together. This takes away some of the series' charm, for those familiar with the original format. But there's so much charm going around in this that it almost doesn't matter. Therefore I chose to give five stars. If another packaged set comes out next year I'll probably order it, as well.",1030233600,,968,4.872727272727273

I would have preferred that the original titles remain, BUT at least they did put the original open to the series for each UNDERDOG episode.  All in all...a GREAT DVD set!

Not anywhere near racist or anti-semitic as cat-in-a-former-life said in her poor excuse for a review.  She clearly has deep issues that need resolving.  Its Underdog, not Fritz the Cat or South Park.  She needs to remember waaaaay back to her own youth and not be so uptight.",1016323200,,451,4.805194805194805
1605773,5,B00005JXZA,I actually bought this tape as a fun gift for my husband.  We've often spoken of watching this show as children.  He thought it was fun but it was our children who are hooked on it now.  It's classic good versus evil but without the blooshed and nastiness of today's shows.  The good guy wins and the bad guy loses and the hero is not perfect as evidended by his constantly flying into airplanes etc.  Not to mention he takes his vitamins!  The fact the a woman in the late 60s had a respected reporter job is nice too!  Have fun with it and enjoy the memories!,1009929600,,561,4.186915887850467
1605774,3,B00005JXZA,"I bought the Underdog Chronicles despite the warnings mentioned in other postings. Considering recent world events I needed some sweet nostalgia. Yes, the cartoons look fine, if a bit soft. Actually I wasn't bothered as much by the alteration of the cliffhanger endings as I was by the utter ABSENCE of the intros to the other cartoon features. The Commander McBragg episode is MISSING the intro and song. Tennesee Tuxedo is MISSING the intro and song. Go Go Gophers is MISSING the intro and song, etc. For cryin' out loud, what gives?! I can only imagine that the original ""title cards"" included names and dates that were not deemed acceptable, perhaps due to copyright reasons. Maybe the current owners of Underdog don't have rights to the King and Odie theme music, etc. It's really a shame.
This reminds me of the big Disney laser set called Mickey Mouse: the Black and White Years from the mid 90's. Some great cartoons but they are ALL missing their title cards. They have fake-computer-generated-titles, much like the abomonations on this Underdog effort.

Unfortunately, the people who made this DVD have chosen chose to deliberately ruin the cartoons. Apparently, the cliffhanger endings that were in the original require too much of an attention span for today's Ritalin addicted audience, and so these segments have been deleted. Other parts of the cartoon have also been tampered with. And what happenend to Tennessee Tuxedo and other characters that I could have sworn were part of the original show?
I love classic animation, but because of the various alterations that were made for this DVD, I cannot recommend it to anyone, in any way, for any reason.",978220800,,693,4.783333333333333
1605778,4,B00005JXZA,"Like most Collector Editions, this DVD does a hack/slash job to blend 4-part stories into one piece.  This makes the storylines easier to view in one setting, which is nice for anyone who's never seen it.  For original fans, however, it means these are not ""as broadcast"" episodes.  The DVD is pure UNDERDOG, with no segments (only a quick review) of the sideline stories that also ran on the show, like Tennesee Tuxedo.
  The quality is mostly very sharp with clear sound, but I noticed the themesongs in the Cavalcade of Characters were not the versions used on the show---they sounded like alternative takes.  It could be that no clear copies of the originals exist any more, or the sound team just didn't know which one to use.
  The interview with the show's co-creator and the UNDERDOG quiz are great extras, as are the sing-along songs with bouncing ball and lyrics!!
  Overall, the slip-ups are minor compared to the fantastic adventure and comedy of the shows!  In many ways, UNDERDOG was similar to ROCKY and BULLWINKLE---overbearing narration, character name puns, cheesy animation done in Mexico, wacky side stories galore, multi-part storylines that ran for weeks.  The UNDERDOG show was less witty and sarcastic, but more action-packed!!  Show it to your kids and let them see how cartoons warped YOUR brain!!",975024000,,1323,4.959090909090909

What were they thinking?
To top it all off, they try to pass it off as a good thing.  The Golden Books website says: ""For the first time ever, Underdog segments have been seamlessly edited together into full-length episodes.""  This is DVD, folks; you CAN have your cake and eat it too.  Get with it.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!  We have to let Golden Books know how disgusted we are with this pathetic attempt.  This DVD is a travesty; an insult to the memory of Jay Ward and Underdog. Will there ever be an Underdog like the one we used to know?

I had not seen an episode in many years, yet I would sometimes find myself singing that catchy Underdog theme song. I happened across the only copy in a music store and believe me I snapped that sucker right up!
I am quite pleased with the pristine video and sound quality. Featuring a well designed menu, the disc is also loaded with extras.
While the cartoon material is aimed primarily at youngsters, I found plenty of reasons to crack up with laughter. It made me feel like a kid again as I remembered that this was one of my favorite 'toons.
You can choose to get bent out of shape fussing over some rather miniscule details as one reviewer did. But why ruin your own day when you can choose to simply enjoy what you get, and this DVD delivers plenty. I hope they release more episodes soon!",971049600,,873,4.428571428571429
1605833,4,B00005JXZA,"When I was a kid some 25 years ago, Underdog was my favorite cartoon. It's great to see these episodes again. The DVD presentation is fine; in fact, I'd rate it 5 stars if they had preserved the episodes in their original format--you know, with short scenes interspersed with other cartoons like Klondike Cat and Go Go Gophers. As it is, though, I'd still recommend this DVD for any Underdog fan as well as any fan of classic cartoons.",970185600,,435,4.518987341772152
1605834,4,B00005JXZA,"I was about five or six when I first watched Underdog.  Until I bought this tape, I hadn't seen it in over twenty years.
The animation is bad.
 The lines are horrible.
 The plots are insipid.

But the trip down memory lane was priceless.  If you are a nostalgia buff and want to relive a part of your childhood, this tape is for you.",969753600,,333,4.140625

Wow, I had forgotton about this cartoon (except for those special appearnces at the Macy's  Thanksgiving Day Parade),  so imagine my delight when it was anounced that  UNDERDOG would be released on DVD.  This disc features a compilation of  Underdog episodes including rarely-seen episodes thought to be long lost.  And, for those dedicated UNDERDOG fans only, I heard a rumor that a $49.95  edition limited to just 1,000 copies will include a lithograph created by  Joe Harris, the original illustrator, especially created for the DVD.  For  the rest of us not willing to spend the cash, this regular edition will do  just fine.",966038400,,673,5.027272727272727

If you like good clean heroic cartoons that the whole family will enjoy, then look no further than Underdog. He may get knocked down, but rest assure he'll win in the end and Polly Purebred and the whole Earth will once again be safe from Simon's plans to take over the world.

7942473,4,B00005JXZA,"Recalling from now distant memory, the UnderDog series, although crude by modern standards, was an integral player in my basic personality traits. This especially prevails in an under girding of belief that integrity, faithfulness, determination and upright morals can result in achievement of goals and overall success in life's pursuits. Although this assertion may be scoffed at or chuckled about, every child needs to see righteousness clearly demonstrated, even if clumsily or in fantasy.",1247097600,,493,5.675675675675675
