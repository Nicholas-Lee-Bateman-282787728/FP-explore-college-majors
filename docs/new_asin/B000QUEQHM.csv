8197473,3,B000QUEQHM,"I have A Holiday Romance and I was tickled to see it in a  packaged deal.  Andy Griffith makes this show as the Grandpa.  Gerald McRaney plays a ""hatchet"" man for a Kentucky school system.  He, of course, falls in love with Naomi Judd the music teacher.  Gerald's niece is played by Alison Pill.  All music lovers will love the message of music making a difference is a person's life.  There are a few tearful scenes but Andy Griffith keeps the movie fun and uplifting!  The last song of the movie is fantastic!  I would buy this set just for this movie!!  LOVE IT!!",1229299200,4,566,4.355769230769231
