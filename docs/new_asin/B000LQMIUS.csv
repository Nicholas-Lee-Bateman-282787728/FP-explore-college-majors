This is not a big budget film, but it is well acted with amazing recreation of the storm in the scenes. The value for me is the telling of the tale. I think it is a labor of love for everyone who was affected. No chcracter in this film is trying to be super human. It's how real people would be. 5 stars.",1501027200,,419,4.121951219512195
8163706,5,B000LQMIUS,"It was one of our worst diasters affecting a whole nation that went into shock, but has given us the insight and feeling of other diasters that happen all over the world, and a better understanding  to try to help others in the same situation. When it happens. The movie has its merits but unforunately they made it a mini series for t.v. It could be a fantastic movie like Jedda was, I am only one person with a point of view but make it into a movie it could bring us up in the world in movies, and it is part of Australian history as Granville. Day of the roses. I still enjoyed the movie and great acting from the cast.",1270857600,3,623,4.10655737704918
