If you are thinking about buying this one,  definitely get it.  This one comes with the episode: Inheritance.",1358726400,,247,4.902439024390244
7922506,4,B00004TIXG,"There some interesting ideas sprinkled throughout the three episodes from early in Season Three of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" included on this videotape, but none of them result in a truly first-rate episode.  Volume 3.3 also finds each episode focusing on a particular member of the ""Enterprise"" crew, so that Geordi, Counselor Troi, and Commander Riker each get to be in the center of the action.  The third season ends with the arrival of the Borg and the greatest ""Star Trek"" cliffhanger of all-time, but things are still progressing rather slowly to that high point at this stage:

Episode 55, ""The Enemy"" (Written by David Kemper and Michael Piller, First aired November 6, 1989).  The ""Enterprise-D"" responds to an unknown distress call from Galorndon Core, an uninhabited planet wracked by constant storms. Riker, Worf and La Forge beam down and discover a Romulan craft that has crashed. Searching for survivors, Riker and Worf find a wounded Romulan and are forced to beam back before they can find La Forge. While the ""Enterprise"" figures out a way to locate their Chief Engineer, La Forge is attacked by another Romulan. Because of the struggle and the violent storms of the planet, La Forge loses his vision and the Romulan can no longer walk. Meanwhile, a Romulan ship has arrived upon the scene ready and willing to fight.

One of the standard war stories has a pair of enemy soldiers having to work with together in order to survive. The most notable example of this would be the 1968 film ""Hell in the Pacific"" with Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune marooned together on an island. Of course the story does not have to take place in a war, as Tony Curtis and Sidney Portier proved in ""The Defiant Ones.""  In this case the Federation is not a war with the Romulan Empire, but there is certainly a level of mutual distrust. Consequently, this is a rather standard version of the tale, quite predictable. The idea that the Romulans show up at a crash site and immediately start threatening to start a war is a bit over the top and loses the episode a star. After all, the planet is causing enough problems without falling back on the Romulan ""Evil Empire"" stereotype. Besides, the story is predictable enough that neither LaVar Burton or anybody else has any really worthwhile dramatic moments. All things considered, this episode is certainly a missed opportunity (Warp 3).

Episode 56, ""The Price"" (Written by Hannah Louise Shearer, First aired November 13, 1989).  What I like most about this episode is that both Picard and the audience are one step behind for almost the entire story. Things are not always crystal clear in the ""Star Trek"" universe. The ""Enterprise"" is holding the negotiations for a wormhole near Barzan Two. Apparently, both ends of the worm hole are fixed (as we find with the Bajoran worm hole in ""Deep Space Nine"") and since the Barzan do not have the technological expertise to take advantage of their natural wonder, they are taking bids for managing their lucrative galatic shortcut. The main competition is between the Federation, the wily Ferengi and the Chrysallians, represented by Devinoni Ral. A devious negotiator who is also part-Betazed, Ral explores a mutual attraction with Counselor Troi when he is not busy figuring out how to dupe both Picard and the Ferengi.

Of course, Deanna is not all that thrilled with Ral's ethics, giving the episode's title a double-meaning. Meanwhile, Data and La Forge are checking out the wormhole in a shuttlecraft.  The joy of this episode is Matt McCoy as Ral, a charming rogue in a ""Star Trek"" universe usually made up of particularly uncharming villains, which makes it much more than the Next Generation version of ""Journey to Babel."" Besides, it is always nice to see Troi getting over that Imzadi thing with Riker (Warp 4).

Episode 57, ""The Vengeance Factor"" (Written by  Sam Rolfe, First aired November 20, 1989).  Picard determines that a Federation research center was raided by the nomadic Gatherers. A century before the Gatherers had left Acamar Three during the height of the clan blood feuds that killed thousands. Marouk, the ruler of Acamar Three wants to have peace talks with the Gatherers and comes aboard the ""Enterprise"" with a small group which includes her cook, Yuta, who catches Riker's eye. During the negotiations at one of the Gatherer's camps, Yuta is talking with one of the old men. When she finds out he is a member of the Lornack clan, she touches him and he dies. While Picard tries to keep the negotiations going, Dr. Crusher works on determining how the old man died, and Riker keeps on being Riker.

""Star Trek"" has always been against the Old Testament version of vengeance that demands an eye for an eye until everyone is blind (or worse). In that regard ""The Vengeance Factor"" is another variation on a standard theme, but the story of how Yuta became a living weapon deadly only to the enemy clan that all but obliterated her own, is rather fascinating. You always have to appreciate it when the writers are really able to pull off something reasonably ""futuristic."" Of course, when it comes to Riker, if it wasn't for bad love... (Warp 4).",1141603200,,5173,4.823927765237021
7922507,5,B00004TIXG,"In ""Q Who?"" (Episode 42), Q sent the Enterprise-D 7,000 light-years away, where they first encounter the Borg. Ever since the conclusion of that episode, which heralded the coming of age of Star Trek: The Next Generation, we have known that the Borg were coming to destroy the Federation. After a year and a half (as reckoned by television time), the Borg finally arrive in the the cliffhanger season finale of season three.  Fortunately, this Collector's Edition videotape has both parts:

Episode 74, ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I"" (Written by Michael Piller, First aired June 18, 1990), finds Starfleet has been preparing for the invaders and Commander Shelby, head of the Borg Tactical Analysis Team, arrives on the Enterprise to tell everybody how to do things right, so nobody likes her. The Borg arrive and demand Picard beam over to their ship. Picard refuses and although the Enterprise escapes from the initial battle, hiding in a nebula until they can devise a new high-energy beam weapon, the Borg appear on the bridge during the next encounter and disappear with the Captain. Riker sends an away team to rescue Picard, but to their horror they discover the captain has been transformed into a Borg named Locutus. When he threatens them with assimilation, Riker orders Worf to fire the weapon and destroy the Borg cube and Locutus (to be continued).

Episode 75, ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part II"" (Written by Michael Pillar, First aired September 24, 1990), picks up where we left off and we quickly learn that because Picard has been assimilated his knowledge has been added to the collective: the energy weapon does not work. This cannot be good and indeed it is not. With the help of Locutus, the Borg annihilate the armada sent by Starfleet (one of the casualties being Benjamin Sisko's wife, as we shall find out in the pilot for Deep Space Nine). In the wake of this almost total defeat, Riker comes up with a new plan: kidnap Picard and turn the tables by using his knowledge of the Borg to discover THEIR weaknesses.

The first ""The Best of Both Worlds"" ended with one of the great cliffhangers in television history that produced a summer of intense speculations and suspense that was not satiated until Part 2 aired the next fall. With this set containing both episodes you can relive that exquisite agony all over again. This is the zenith of ""STNG"" and establishes the Borg as THE villains for the show and not even the show's final episode tops this two-parter. This is where the series fulfills the promise it first showed in ""Q Who?"", and as we shall see in future episodes, there are significant ramifications to what happens here as well, especially in the next episode when Picard goes back home to try and deal with what has been done to him (Episode 76, ""Family"").",1140652800,3,2800,4.755144032921811
