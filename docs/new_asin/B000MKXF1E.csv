8169765,5,B000MKXF1E,A superb biography of a brilliant Mathematician. A must watch if you love mathematics.,1498348800,,86,5.214285714285714
8169766,5,B000MKXF1E,"I have read this book 4 X already and have distributed it widely. This is my highest recommendation: if I die tomorrow, this will be the best book I have ever read.",1466467200,,164,4.15625
8169767,5,B000MKXF1E,"A  fascinating bio film on the eccentric but lovably Paul Erdos, A Hungarian born prodigy in mathematics. This story captures the lives  he touched and influences that he had on so many other mathematicians that collaborated with him. He published so many papers in professional journals, not sure if he exceeded Leonard Euler. Love this Guy!",1456704000,,342,5.089285714285714
8169768,5,B000MKXF1E,Highly recommendable. Great documentary about life and work of this amazing mathematician. It could be better with subtitles in different languages.,1380758400,,148,6.095238095238095
8169769,4,B000MKXF1E,I can say I thought it was well done. I came away feeling as a picture in greys would give when the colors of the man was desired.,1366502400,,130,3.6785714285714284
8169770,5,B000MKXF1E,"Paul Erdos, a Hungarian mathematician, didn't write any bestsellers, was not well known in his lifetime outside mathematical circles, and had no fixed address. And yet, there are two popular biographies of him written for a general, non-mathematical readership, as well as this excellent documentary.

Erdos did not have any one or two major discoveries or mathematical accomplishments in his career -- he is known for the quantity and consistent quality of his work. And he is known for having treated mathematics as a team sport all his life. He worked with so many people over the years, publishing so many joint scientific papers that math people talk of an Erdos Number. Erdos's own number is zero, and anyone who co-wrote a paper with him has an Erdos Number of 1, and anyone who has written a paper with someone who wrote a paper with Erdos has an Erdos Number of 2, and so on. Apparently nearly everyone in the math world has an Erdos Number of at most 3, simply because Erdos wrote so many papers with so many different people.

Once Erdos's mother died, when Erdos was middle-aged, he started visiting friends and colleagues all over the world, staying with each for a few days or a few weeks, with no permanent home and no steady job. He guest lectured often and published more often. He had few needs and all his belongings fit in a single suitcase.

An eccentric, but appealing character, Erdos was born in 1913, so it's time to recall his life on what would be his 100th birthday. This one hour documentary is a fine place to start, then follow up with two good books,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Loved-Only-Numbers-The-Story-of-Paul-Erdos-and-the-Search-for-Mathematical-Truth/dp/0786863625/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdos and the Search for Mathematical Truth</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MY-BRAIN-IS-OPEN-The-Mathematical-Journeys-of-Paul-Erdos/dp/0684859807/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MY BRAIN IS OPEN: The Mathematical Journeys of Paul Erdos</a>.",1363824000,,2134,5.833333333333333
8169771,5,B000MKXF1E,"This is an excellent documentary about Paul Erdos who is and will always be one of the most profound mathematicians of all times. This documentary doesn't show a complete picture of Erdos's life but shows the most important bits who he is and what he has done. I will watch it over and over again, every time remembering the contributions this great man has done to the world not just in terms of his work in math but also  how he has dedicated his life nurture mathematicians around the world who can continue long after he has ""left"" us.",1325289600,,539,4.444444444444445

8169773,3,B000MKXF1E,"I'd heard Erdos name come up several times in discussions of mathematics but had no real idea who he was until I bought this fascinating DVD.  If ever there was a man who could just float through life on the strength of his intellect alone Erdos is he.  He is by turns amusing, gentle, simple but undeniably brilliant and driven.  A remarkable portrait of a remarkable man, compelling whether or not you care about math.",1192147200,7,420,4.573333333333333
