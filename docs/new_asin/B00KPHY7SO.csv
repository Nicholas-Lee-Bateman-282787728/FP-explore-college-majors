Very well made, well scripted and well acted, not your typical Hong Kong cop & gangster movie. Unfortunately the movie was quite dark and could be depressing to watch.",1440979200,,265,4.541666666666667
6437651,3,B00KPHY7SO,"Although there is enough action to continue to watch the movie, the plot plods along in more than a few places. The lead character is so flawed that it's unbelievable he would be in the police force for so long. That being said, it was worth watching a ""cops & robbers"" movie for which Hong Kong is famous.",1439769600,,306,4.293103448275862

6437655,3,B00KPHY7SO,"Inspired by the real-life incident about two police officers who got shot, that happened in Hong Kong on March 17, 2006, Dante Lams That Demon Within follows the story of a dutiful police officer Dave (Daniel Wu), stationed at an emergency hospital. Dave saves the life of a heavily wounded man named Hon (Nick Cheung) by donating his blood, but what Dave didn't know was that Hon was in fact the leader of the notorious groups of criminals Demon Gang.

After this event, Dave starts to see things, and his behaviors become more aggressive. As the Demon Gang members continue to commit crimes, past traumas catch up with Dave, who keeps chasing these men on his own.

That Demon Within is part psychological thriller, part crime action and part character study. The film is really driven forward by terrific performances from Daniel Wu and Nick Cheung, and the subdued photography conveys the sense of foreboding, but the truths that are revealed at the end of the film is not really interesting, and the story about the criminal gang resolves in a rush. Also, fire plays a significant role in the story, but the fake CGI fire used here is not a very good one.

So, is the film worth your time and money? Yes. But as a Dante Lam/Nick Cheung collaboration, That Demon Within is just average, if not weak.",1424649600,2,1303,4.656521739130435

8660588,4,B00KPHY7SO,"I like Hong Kong action films a lot, my favorites being Infernal Affairs, the movies of Johnny To and Dante Lam (director of this one), This movie stars Daniel Wu as a psychologically disturbed police office who is sent from place to place because he doesn't seem to get along with his peers, although considered a good cop. This movie is as much psychological thirller as action movie (there is plenty of action thought), you find out a lot at the very end (which I will not give away). Very good effects and cinematography. Also stars Nick Cheung and Liu Kai Chi as gangsters. Various plot twists makes this movie very interesting and suspenseful.",1496275200,,649,4.701754385964913

8660595,3,B00KPHY7SO,"I consider this movie to be a psychological thriller.  It's about the psychology of a police officer who has been highly affected by a childhood experience that determines his emotional instability.  It's quite an interesting movie in that it combines a story line of gangsters vs. cops theme along with a spiritual vs. psychology theme.  The officer saves a gang leader, but is constantly haunted by the idea of saving an evil guy who killed his fellow cops and having to deal with how this conflicts with his duty to serve and protect people even if the person is a bad guy.  This is a Hong Kong film, but is somewhat different than the normal action pack gangster movies as it takes you into the mind of an unstable cop as he copes with his relationship with a killer.",1455667200,,771,4.525179856115108
