8761413,2,B01FRO6XH2,"Whole show's tone is off so much, we have a dark and dramatic side to the show that works to a certain extent that involves the Yin Dynasty and the evil temptress demon Dakki corrupting Emperor Zhou and turning him evil ultimately causing tragic deaths of a lot of people including Ki Shou, the lord of the west's eldest son and Kou Hiko who has served the Yin dynasty for years with friend and military strategist Bunchu (a big fat char clone if there was ever one) loses his wife and sister and turns away from Zhou all together.

That historical drama part is interesting enough and we then having immortals in the heavens apparently sending out a clueless idiot immortal-in-training Taikoubou to hunt down 365 spirits or souls and destroy Dakki to set in motion some big Soul Hunt project that the heavens wants completed. Basically when people die their souls go flying into a pillar of souls they have set up for some spell thing that is not explained about much.

They pair him with a obnoxious boob of a talking magical hippo and send him to earth to hunt down Dakki where he teams himself instead with a group of super powered characters including emotionless Heero Yuy/Vegeta clone Nataku who is part human and part weapon or ""paopei"", a flying vigilante hero named Raishinshi who is the Lord of the West Ki Shou's 100 adopted son apparently, Youzen who is a superior of Takioubou in the immortal world and is required to report on him and Kou Tenka, Kou Hiko's apparently all grown up son who fights with apparently a freaking lightsaber. (Disney will totally sue you Soul Hunter for that Star Wars theft)

Takioubou after teaming up with all of them and helping Kou Hiko escape with the last two sons of Emperor Zhou to the lands of Ki Shou unfortunately has to deal with Bunchu who is a big idiot devoted to the Yin Dynasty even though it is clearly nearly dead. See the drama of Kou Hiko having to battle his ex-friend Bunchu over loyalty kind of is stupid, Bunchu just kind of acts like he can get rid of Dakki or something and or depose Zhou though he apparently is taking his sweet time doing any of it.  So of course he sends assassins after our main characters that actually give the super powered immortal/paopei using main characters a rather hard time and kick their butts a lot.  This whole fight takes up a lot of episodes surprisingly and yes it gets boring old quick.

The story is really confusing to me with the rather dark historical drama happening at one point and then the silly antics of Takioubou and friends plus the fact that Dakki sometimes is doing comedy schtick in between murdering Ki Shou's son (Off Screen confusingly) and then feeding him to him as a meal, it's rather hard to really reconcile the tone whiplash.

Also the  readers of the manga based around this show will realize quickly how much of a departure it is from the storyline of of it also. It's also an anime that feels like it has at least 3 freaking climaxes to it nearly. You will see what I mean when the show nearly feels like it's going to end at one point but resumes pretty much with something else.

The animation also alternates from what looks like beautifully rendered old school animation drawings and bad looking computer animation including some bad 3D shots. And the show just kind of ends happily at the end sort of, just kind of just stops.

It's really kind of disappointing as some parts of the drama do work emotionally and the music to the opening and ending is good as well. Kou Hiko is also pretty cool, I would watch an anime around him possibly.",1527552000,,3578,4.516228748068007
