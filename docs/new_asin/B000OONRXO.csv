8185903,5,B000OONRXO,"I have taught this book for several years - it is my favorite to teach to my Honors Sophs. I availed myself of several of the accompanying essays to support/refute my interpretations. Loved it. I believe the book to be a work of genius, and, at over 70 years old, I have read a few books. Each year it continues to send shivers down my spine - and the spines of some of my otherwise apathetic and narcissistic students. Thanks",1495584000,,426,4.3375
