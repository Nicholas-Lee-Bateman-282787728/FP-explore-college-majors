8734647,3,B015UBNYP6,"A cute story of a yosakoi club at an all-girls high school. As others have noted, strictly slice of life fluff. Usually I go for concept titles because I always end up learning something about the subject, and a lot of drama and humor come out of how intense the characters can become about even the most mundane subject (just look at how Yakitate and Food Wars treat cooking!). This title was strong on the girls high school stuff, weak in the concept theme. You don't really learn much about yosakoi dance - if that was something you're interested in, you'll have better luck perusing wikipedia and googling the subject. I have a couple of friends who were in yosakoi dance troupes themselves and have seen some performances; I was hoping this would impart some of that enthusiasm. The fact that you never actually even see the girls' completed performance in full is telling about how much of a priority it is to the series. I've heard this is from a manga of the same name, so I don't know if this holds true for the source material, but for the anime, it's strictly cute girls school moe daily-life. Cute, okay, but that's about it.",1512604800,,1137,4.5512195121951216

If you like anime this is a must. It's not action, more slice of life about some pretty girls who are motivated by one girl (a foreigner), in particular. Lots of beautiful things, and the interplay between characters as each gets drawn into the yosakoi dance (central to this story) is interesting to watch. There is some very beautiful artwork/animation in this story. It has bumps and hiccups along the way, and some unexpected turns. I'd say this is a special one, and the dub cast did a great job!",1492387200,,516,4.559139784946237
8734649,5,B015UBNYP6,"If what you're looking for is a slice of life that does just about every single little thing that a slice of life should with AMAZING ability, precision, and quality, you'll find EXACTLY what you're looking for with HaNaYaMaTa.

I'm extremely critical about the anime I watch, and I don't particularly like slice of life all that much. I've always preferred mature psychological shows, like Welcome to the NHK and The Tatami Galaxy. But when I was in the mood to watch something relaxing, I came across an anime a couple of people with reliable opinions referred to as a hidden gem.

I didn't expect myself to enjoy the anime as much as I did. I thought it'd be a nice way to pass the time but I was just amazed by how well everything was handled, and how much quality there was in the entire series. From how fluid it was, to how each scenario was panned out. From the premise and execution to each scene. To how each character was presented, developed, and used in a way that benefited the plot, to how amazing the character interactions and comedy were. In addition to the incredible art and great soundtrack.

Without a doubt one of the best (if not the best, but I can't say that for sure since there are a couple other contenders) slice of life anime I've ever seen, one I recommend to anyone looking for a quality SoL.

YMMV as usual. This is slice of life, so if you're expecting something more, don't even bother with HaNaYaMaTa.",1479340800,,1438,4.477099236641221
8734650,5,B015UBNYP6,A classic. One of the best animes around,1475452800,,40,4.125
8734651,5,B015UBNYP6,"Hanayamata is one of those quiet little shows that is easy to overlook amid the overhyped shows that are the most talked about in any anime season. But once you stumble across it, you'll wish you'd seen it sooner.

Yes, this is yet another slice-of-life anime for the most part, but it's one of the better ones I've seen. You can read the basic plot off the back cover (far better than I could describe it); what makes Hanayamata stand out a bit from the usual 'school club at girls' school' show is the characters, and their various motivations for creating, and joining, the new yosakoi dancing club. Unlike so many of these shows, Hanayamata gets the balance right between the club activities and the character's lives in general -- you'll neither drown in details of yosakoi, nor be shown every detail of their family lives either.  Just enough of each as appropriate to the story, and yes there is a story and it actually reaches a conclusion (so you're not forced to hunt down the magna to find the rest of the story).

So, a nice little show, nothing earth-shattering.  But I still find the opening song will pop into my head now and again, even weeks later, and I find myself smiling.  If this is the kind of show you tend to like, you will almost certainly enjoy Hanayamata.

The Blu-ray itself is the usual package of no-frills competence from Sentai Filmworks; no extras like postcards or the like, but no mistakes or glitches on the discs either.",1470787200,6,1458,4.588461538461538
