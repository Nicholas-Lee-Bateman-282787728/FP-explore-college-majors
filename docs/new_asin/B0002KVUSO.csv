8028664,4,B0002KVUSO,There are a few factors in commentary that are more opinion than history and should be more clearly delineated as such. But a great addition to an actively homeschooling parent who knows the history and can make that distinction in lecture. Testing features in the bonus menu are fantastic. A little bit dry.. but gets the job done.,1395100800,,332,4.741379310344827
