2688965,5,B000KF0DEI,"What a fine collection of NFL films from the 60's and 70's. This was how football was meant to be played--hard nosed and with professionalism. The music of Sam Spence and the footage from these films make a great collection for any real NFL fan.  Unlike the over-paid thugs of today that call themselves professionals who have to pound their chest and make a scene of themselves after every tackle or play. Notice back in the 60's and 70's the players did their job and went back to the huddle. Sure you had a few players celebrate once in a while but not like today and these players played the game because they had a common goal--to win a Super Bowl. The players of today just follow the mighty dollar. No wonder there is no loyalty on the owners part or players. Why should the fans be loyal?? Let's keep alive the true spirit of the NFL with these fine films and music from the past.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Super-70s/dp/0977038300/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Super '70s</a>&nbsp;Also recommend The Super '70s for fine reading from this era.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Autumn-Thunder-40-Years-of-NFL-Films-Music/dp/B0002VERQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Autumn Thunder: 40 Years of NFL Films Music</a>&nbsp;Autumn Thunder for more fine music from Sam Spence.

2688966,5,B000KF0DEI,"If you're looking for a negative review, about anything produced by NFL Films, from this reviewer, you are going to be looking for a long time.  I love just about all their stuff, particularly from the 1960s and 1970s -- the golden era(s) of NFL Films and the NFL.  This 3-disc set is classic NFL at its best.  There are various highlight films from the 60s and 70s, with episodes of the popular ""Lost Treasures"" series, produced for NFL Network, provided as Bonus material.  One feature on each disc includes a ""commentary"" option, where you can play the program while at the same time listening to Steve Sabol, of NFL Films, spin stories about what you are looking at.  It's not as annoying as you might think ... :-)

2688967,5,B000KF0DEI,"When you have the Sabols and all the crew members of NFL FILMS capturing all the actions on the football field, coaches and players along the sidelines, fans in the stands, and in all kinds of ""football"" weather,
 with the music from Sam Spence, and then the naration from John Facenda,
when it all comes together ---- poetry in motion.",1194134400,20,336,4.6
2688968,5,B000KF0DEI,"If you are a fan of the NFL and football, you got to get this DVD collection.  It is an incredible collection of very old NFL Films movie productions from the 60s and 70s.  I vaguely remember seeing some of these when I was younger and never thought I would have the opportunity to see them again until now.  There is an abundant amount of game film and interviews.  It is really cool to see the old heroes of the NFL in action such as Fran Tarkenton, Jim Brown, Lance Alworth, Johnny Unitas, Gale Sayers, etc.

I also believe that the Steve Sabol introductions to each and every feature is a bit much but he does explain the purpose and intention of each film creation done by NFL Films and his father Ed.",1191801600,9,706,4.2781954887218046
2688969,4,B000KF0DEI,"This collection of NFL Films programs from the 1960s and 1970s are fantastic!

They take you back to an age when the NFL was humbler and the game was more fun.

You actually get a chance to see what pro football looked like when men named Bart Starr, Johnny Unitas, and Jim Brown played.

I have 2 very minor criticisms, though:

1. If you have the DVDs of all the Super Bowls like I do, some of the films are included in those sets. However, these DVDs make accessing them easier.

2. Steve Sabol's intros to the films are too reverential and gushing. Part of me wanted to cry tears of joy, and the other part wanted to laugh at their artificiality.",1171497600,27,650,4.295081967213115

2688979,2,B000KF0DEI,"The content in this three-disc set is outstanding...if you can view it.  The product quality is garbage. I purchased this set TWICE; and TWICE the second DVD 'The Men Who Played The Game' did not play.  Skipping, pixelation, freezing, and complete stopping is what I experienced with this particular DVD in the set.  I can keep the second set, and enjoy only two-thirds of it, or return yet a another time.  If I could find these individually......

I was probably 10 years old or so when the 1st part of this came out.
Amazon price was right at 10x cheaper than wally.
Liked it so much bought 2 more at that price to send to my brother and a friend!!

2688984,4,B000KF0DEI,"The main reason I purchased this was to hear the incredible voice of John Facenda combined with the music of Sam Spence playing over the slow motion of NFL Films. It was worth it. Some of the Lost Treasures is nice too. Amazing how clear some of the film is. If you are a big fan, of some NFL history then you will find what you are looking for. It was great to see some of these old NFL stadiums that were also used as Baseball ball parks. Good stuff.",1320624000,2,452,4.033333333333333
2688985,4,B000KF0DEI,"These DVDs are awesome, but whoever wrote the descriptions on the back must have never watched them.  I mean, it's like they are being deliberately unclear.  You literally can't tell whats one the DVDs until you put them in and then play them.  Kind of frustrating.

the pictures are beautiful and wonderful music.
incredible images of the dusty and muddy playgrounds.
the uniforms of the game were much more beautiful than those of today.
3 dvds reallly deserve to be in your collection.",1306281600,,293,4.653846153846154
2688987,2,B000KF0DEI,"Okay, not a bad documentary about the history of the NFL Film crew, but not that great  either.  I mean, they talk about the music (which is excellent) and they talk to the editor (who is obviously talented) but what about the cameramen??!!!  It's those talented group of cinematographers who framed all of this tight, dramatic action through a flickering viewfinder ! I mean how demanding of a job - shooting in adverse weather, making magazine changes, implementing camera techniques, knowing the game inside and out - anticipating plays and action - follow focusing !  I didn't see anything in the first volume in the documentary about these talented lensmen!  What an oversight!  Anyhow, it's a pretty decent package - but it's like leaving the engine out of a vehicle !",1291680000,2,774,4.870229007633588
2688988,5,B000KF0DEI,"As a kid, before I could ever sit down and watch an actual, live football game, I relished watching NFL Films.  Their depiction of football as a kind of Homeric adventure, complete with heroes, villains, thunderous music and grand prose, hypnotized me at a young age.  So naturally, this collection is a must have.

All of the material on these discs are good, but by far, the highlights are:

""They Call it Pro Football"" - the first NFL Films production to join the narration of John Facenda and the music of Sam Spence.  This film is a love letter to football of sixties.

""Legends of the Fall"" - A ""Who's the greatest"" among teams, quarterbacks and running backs.

""The Championship Chase"" - Chronicles the 1974 NFL season.  NFL Films at its best.  Great filmmaking, music and narration.

If you're a Redskin fan, you'll love ""Hail to the Redskins,"" the story of the team's 1971 season.  The ""Lost Treasures"" on each disc feature never before seen footage that looks like it was shot yesterday.  Most of these focus on the story of NFL Films themselves, which is actually quite interesting, especially the ""The Players.""

Watching legends like Johnny Unitas, Charlie Taylor, Bart Starr, and Dick Butkus take the field again; or listening to Norm Van Brocklin cuss out the officials, is a real treat.  These films show how far the game has come, and how much it has stayed the same.",1252713600,12,1384,4.7125
2688989,2,B000KF0DEI,"I am disappointed with this item. It seemed to me that less than half of the time was video highlights and instead we get a bunch of talking heads, interview out takes, etc. I won't waste any more of my money on NFL Films items unless I know for sure it's wall to wall football and not video of how Tim Rossovich lives on the beach or Dickie Post runs his clothing business, or endless minutes wasted on player interview out takes that are pointless. VERY BORING!! The best part of this DVD was the 1962 NFL Championship game. That was worth watching. Most of the rest is boring.",1244505600,11,579,4.321100917431193

8156171,4,B000KF0DEI,"When I first got these DVDs, I found that none of the three DVDs played on my DVD players that I have in my house. So that was certainly disappointing. However, it seems like this could be a chronic problem for these disks, as I have read that others have had a similar experience according to the comments here. So I sent my package back to Amazon, which has a generous return policy, and I reordered from another seller. The disks I received from the other seller work great, and the content is very enjoyable. So I don't know if there is a problem in a factory somewhere, but if you do get a set of bum desks, just re-order and try again. It is worth it. As far as the content, it is vintage NFL films. Some of the selections can be viewed on other DVDs, for example in lost treasures of the NFL, the story of the birth of NFL films can be viewed on the lost treasures of the NFL DVD series that they put out about a decade ago, and also they have the famous 1974 season recap, the classic one with John Facenda reading poetry about the black mustaches of the Oakland Raiders. Anyway it seems to be definitely worth the price, as it seems like it's not that expensive for how is generously they loaded the disks. Perfect for anybody who loves the history of the NFL, especially of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.",1465171200,,1312,4.252
