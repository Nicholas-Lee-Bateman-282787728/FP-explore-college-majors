8181428,5,B000NUJWVU,"Anyone interested in Panama, especially to relocate or to invest in property, should definetely consider get this DVD. It's non-bias approach, colorful scenery & up to the point information will help you get a better picture of what this country has to offer. It also provides with suggestions/do's & dont's on how to succeed there. Although not touristy oriented, it provides with some sightseeing of the main areas. At roughly one hour, it makes you ""crave"" for more. However it's well put together. Also it's in widescreen format, for awesome viewing on our flat screen TV. It's worth the money.
Also recommend the following: ""Living in Panama"" by Sandra Snyder, ""Moon Handbooks Panama"", ""Culture Smart Panama"" & National Geographic's Adventure Map of Panama.",1189555200,11,762,5.203252032520325
