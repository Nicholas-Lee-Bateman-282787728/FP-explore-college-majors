First off most of the talking was so low in volume that I had to turn the volume way up to hear what was being said. And then something would happen at normal volume and my eardrums would be blown out because the volume was up so high. Also it sounded like all of the dialogue from all the different people were done by the same voice actor, including the women. 3 stars for at least trying. I just wish it would be done more professionally.",1524441600,,597,4.111111111111111
