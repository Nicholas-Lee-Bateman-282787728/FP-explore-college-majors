1330534,5,B00003G1FR,"Like Big Wheels, superballs and bells bottoms, Davey & Goliath, the stop-motion three-dimensional animated television program about a boy and his dog, was a much cherished part for me growing up in the 70s. In  addition to believable characters and situations that children can relate  to, the look of the show is a big draw. The miniature sets are as elaborate  as a street parade, an abandoned silver mine, and a carnival -- complete  with a roller coaster and ferris wheel. These episodes brought back fond  childhood memories, and the children will delight in their discovery.",955670400,,580,5.0

7918827,1,B00003G1FR,"You wanted me to review the product I purched on 4/29/10 ""Davey & Goliath"" Vol. 1 New Skates/Waterfall.

I would be glad too. But have NOT received the order yet!",1275264000,,162,4.4
7918828,5,B00003G1FR,"Our family's philosophy is basically secular humanism and all five of our children (now ages 14 through 31) watched this program growing up and loved it.  So did I.  On reading the 12 reviews on this series, I am questioning them since I rarely see these DVDs or VHSs anywhere used, and never anywhere new; maybe the original producers didn't have making money in mind, but whoever is selling them used now sure does.  I would like to buy them, but think I will pass.",1105488000,4,467,4.470588235294118

7918830,5,B00003G1FR,"This is suppose to be a DVD review, so let me tell you about the ""features"" of this DVD: there are none.  (Unless you count a couple of screens of background info on the creation of the Davey and Goliath series as a ""feature."")
It is rather obvious that no work was done to clean up the picture or improve the faded colors.  In one story, their is a hair or string in the upper left corner that remains viewable for several mintues!  Sound is adequate, but you won't be needing a THX certified sound system to bring this disk to life. (Nor will you need Dolby Digital, Dolby Surrond, or even plain old stereo...mono systems will be more than adequate.)
This disk itself is just a plain boring silver affair with the ""Davey and Goliath"" logo imprinted on it.  The case is one of those cheap paper & plastic things like Warner Brothers uses for their fine films.  It is obvious that as little money as possible was spent on the production and distrubtion of this DVD.
It is also obvioius that as little money as possible was spent on the actual production of Davey and Goliath...but that's understandable seeing how this was a non-profit televisionn show.  The Lutherans were not looking to pick up a lot of ad revenue with their two claymation hereos.
So with all that out of the way, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the purchase of this DVD, especially if you are interested in grounding small children in good, old fashioned moral lessons.
Davey and Goliath wildly succeed where 90% of children productions fall down and die --it gives children valuable life lessons while still managing to be entertaining.  In the last 40 years or so, the only thing I can think of that suceeds as well are the very recent ""VeggieTales"" productions.  What's even more amazing is that these profound little lessons in morality are done without being preachy or condemming; rather, they are done in a very gentle and loving manner.  Many of these Davey and Goliath episodes would be as welcome in a Jewish or Muslim household as they would in a Christian home.
The animator, Art Clokey, and the writer, Nancy Moore, deserve a tremendous amount of praise and gratitude.  My two children (ages 4 & 6) love watching these episdodes, just as their father did when he was their age.  And while they are watching they are learing some valuable things about life and morality that no child should be withhout.
This particular disk contains the following episodes:
1. The Waterfall
2. The Parade
3. Officer Bob
4. The Dog Show
5. The New Skates
6. Cousin Barney
7. The Time Machine
8. The Mechanical Man
The total running time of all eight episodes is 113 minutes.
No home should go without a copy of this DVD.",1022371200,23,2673,4.59453781512605
7918831,4,B00003G1FR,"A nice selection of episodes from the classic series. I wish they had given some thought to some extras, but what's here is good enough. The film sources could have used a little cleanup here and there, but it's certainly better than the Gumby DVD, also from Clokey Productions.",1021420800,3,278,4.6938775510204085
7918832,5,B00003G1FR,My 4 year old really likes Davey and Goliath.  The stories are simple and wholesome.  A Christian message but not too preachy.  The 15 minute episodes make it easy to watch and keeps his attention.,1001116800,,197,4.571428571428571
7918833,5,B00003G1FR,"Both my husband and I, growing up in separate regions of the country during the 70s, enjoyed Davey and Goliath as kids.  Imitations of Goliath's voice were just part of the pop culture lingo we shared -- ""Hey,  Da-a-y-v-ey.""  Now our daughters can enjoy this, and what a blessing  the DVD has been for busy parents.  After supper, pop in the DVD to occupy  our toddler and give us time to clean up.  The great things are 1) they're  only 15 minutes long and 2) they teach great lessons.  Chloe speaks about  the mistakes or events Davey is involved with frequently.  I hope there  will be more DVDs out soon.  We love them!",962755200,10,623,4.407079646017699
