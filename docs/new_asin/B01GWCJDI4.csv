A truly wonderful story, top-notch acting with a strong romantic subplota film in which the viewer becomes totally engrossed. A perfect film. The final scene is iconictear-jerker, feel-good, uplifting. This film is not only must-see viewing, but a film that everyone should have as a part of their film library.",1509753600,4,496,4.916666666666667
