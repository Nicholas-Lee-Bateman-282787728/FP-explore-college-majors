8554642,2,B00ANCWZ1C,"One of the most pre-eminent douche-bags in recent US history oversees a debate.  WFB was, above all else, a performer.  The accuracy of his claims were almost irrelevant to him.",1461628800,,177,4.866666666666666
8554643,3,B00ANCWZ1C,"Generally I'm a huge fan of Firing Line, but this episode was a bit tedious. This is too bad as it's a meaty topic worthy of discussion, and every bit as relevant as it was in the 90s when this episode first aired.",1446076800,,214,4.0
8554644,2,B00ANCWZ1C,"This Firing Line Debate was not what I hoped it would be. First, WFB Jr takes almost a backseat in the discussions. The approach to the debates in the '90s is to have 4 versus 4 with equal time to debate and represent their cases. Very balanced, very democratic. Because there are 4 on 4, each person has less time to talk and thoroughly get into discussion about topics. As a result, people are speaking hurriedly and often punctuate their points by giving minispeeches either while answering and sometimes while questioning their opponents. Because the opposition has less time to address what's being said, they find themselves forced to interrupt. Instead of a strong civil discussion, you have something which is much more contemporary (and undesirable to many) which is a lot of loud crosstalking instead of listening and responding. This is a universal criticism of this debate format for all of the debates I've seen from this period.

The title doesn't suggest this but for the most part, this debate is about political correctness in schools and college campuses. So much time is spent considering it's effect in colleges that its appearance in media, workplaces, et al is completely lost.

The arguments for political correctness are dated as well. We've reached the point where it is politically correct to assume someone is guilty because of racial aspects of the alleged suspects and victims. It was assumed that the Duke lacrosse players were guilty of violent rape simply because the accuser was an African American woman. it was politically correct to assume this even though it was proven false. This debate touches on where PC will lead and the only comment in this regard was from Mark Green who claimed that almost exact opposite to the Duke lacrosse case would more likely become the norm.

This isn't a useful debate. It fails to address the full scope of PC in society and it couldn't predict where it would lead throughout society because it  only argues in defense of (or against) its origins.",1365465600,,2019,4.894736842105263
