8055592,3,B00083ZQCQ,"It's so hard to find any Telugu learning resources, so I purchased Exploring Telugu for my little girl to get some exposure to her daddy's ""mother tongue"". This product would be better if there were more sections to the DVD. The menu page gives an impression that there could be multiple sections of learning, but only has one. The entire video is about 30 minutes, so it's a little pricey for such a short amount of time available on the DVD. According to my husband, a couple of the words are ""old style"" Telugu which isn't used much anymore, but the rest of the content was ok. If you're like me and have no knowledge of the Telugu language but want your children (or even you) to pick up a few basic words, then this is ok.",1338508800,,727,4.313868613138686
8055593,1,B00083ZQCQ,"I just ordered this DVD from amazon and my first impression -- very dissapointing. It could not grab the attention of my toddler even for a few minutes.
Here are the few things I did not like about the video -
1. First of all the person speaking the telugu words had a horrible diction. Some of the words like 'Cheppulu' (Shoes) was pronounced as 'Chappuluu'.
2. The picture quality was not crisp. The lighting was bad in some frames.
3. There was no consistancy in the theme. Some of the words were shown using real kids and the others were shown using puppets and toys. For Eg- The word 'Monkey' was shown using a puppet and a stuffed toy.
3. The theme was jumping around between objects , colors and numbers.
4. The music was not catchy. Just some mozart music running in the background.

Overall I would not recommend this DVD to anyone who wants quality stuff for their $15+shipping money.",1242777600,,894,4.484662576687117
8055594,3,B00083ZQCQ,"I'm a second generation Telugu Indian (my parents moved to the US from Andhra) and I received this DVD as a gift at my baby shower.
This DVD would not be an effective tool to actually teach a toddler or child how to speak Telugu.  As a previous reviewer noted, some of the words they describe are very long or irrelevent (ie- not actually used in India anymore!).  This is becuase they use the same video as for the Hindi version (and the Hindi words are short and used, so they were relevant for that video), and then just dubbed it into Telugu.
But, it keeps an infant entertained, like Baby Einstein. And I like the idea that my son can see brown people, just like himself, on TV.",1225238400,,683,4.286821705426356
8055595,4,B00083ZQCQ,"This DVD goes through some basic words, including numbers and colors, in Telegu. It's almost the same thing as a Baby Einstein video, if you are familiar with them. I am learning Telegu along with my 9 month old, and we both enjoy the DVD.",1212278400,,239,4.333333333333333
8055596,1,B00083ZQCQ,"This is a very poorly designed learning program.  There seems to be no clear direction or emphasis.  The video shows a bunch of seemingly random scenes and words.  The video could almost be mistaken as a PR stunt for the kids in the video.

There is no stepping stone approach, as is expected from an effective learning tool.  For example, one of the words taught in the first 5 minutes of the video is the telugu word for Butterfly.  For those who don't know Telugu, this is one of the most complicated words (7 syllables!) that some adults don't even know !

I do not recommend this video for anyone looking to learn Telugu - let alone for kids.",1207353600,,647,4.38655462184874
8055597,4,B00083ZQCQ,My husband speaks telgu but I do not so I purchased this video for my daughter to get more exposure.  It's a great idea but I wish the quality of the video was better.,1171152000,,167,3.911764705882353
8055598,5,B00083ZQCQ,"I bought the ""Exploring Telugu"" DVD, more than a year ago and it's still my two year old's favourite! The colors, photography are so vivid, that they're so appealing even for my six year old. He watches it sometimes with his brother, and seems to enjoy it. I love the way they've incorporated day to day objects, so that it becomes a part of day to day living! I wish the Baby hindustani team would make a sequel to this DVD, for an older age group. I'd definitely buy it.",1131580800,3,472,4.2555555555555555
8055599,2,B00083ZQCQ,I bought the DVD to see if my children can learn basic words in telugu. I found that if was not crispy. The idea is great but I wish it can be redone to make it more interesting as it is intended to teach little children. My children could not watch the whole DVD even once. The idea is good but need to be more interesting.,1126742400,3,324,3.9242424242424243
