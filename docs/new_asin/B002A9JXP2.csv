If you are at all interested in Martial Arts, especially if you practice it, you will enjoy watching these top-notch competitors captured on film.  This competition was on the scale of a mini-olympics.  You can see how much the Chinese put into it!  They must have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the performances you get to see! The weapon work is phenomenal, particularly the weapons kumite katas (fighting patterns).

The film does a fantastic job of pacing itself for the most part.  My one criticism is that it can be slow in a few spots to those who want a non-stop adrenaline rush; however, if you are in it for both the skill and the adrenaline rush, you will be very pleased.  The last 30 minutes will keep you glued to your seat.

Tai Chi is also briefly discussed for those who would enjoy the philosophical angle, but if that is what you really want I actually recommend HOLY MOUNTAIN, which is far more in depth than Kung Fu Masters.

If you want, you can grab it on Amazon's Createspace for a little less. createspace.___/263698 Use the code: YP5AF4ZP for 12 percent off.

Hope this helps. Cheers.",1242604800,3,1201,4.596244131455399
