8583025,5,B00CLDOZGY,"I was saw this band open for Ratt in 1985 in Marquette, Michigan and they were a really tight solid act. They sounded excellent so that is what influenced me to buy this live DVD. Mama's Boys didn't get the accolades they truly deserved and sadly with the untimely passing of the drummer/brother they might have made a big comeback. This DVD is excellent though the singer's vocals sound a little strained. The guitar solo is amazing as I've never seen or heard a guitar player perfectly cop the musical cacophony of the keyboardist/alien keyboard solo off of Close Encounters. The acoustics are a little off on this venue probably due to the small size of the building. When I saw them they sounded really good. But all in all get this DVD....",1429574400,,744,4.601503759398496
8583026,5,B00CLDOZGY,"Awesome DVD of classic 80's metal. I remember living in England the first time I heard ""Lettin' Go"", one awesome song! It was a great surpise to find this available of Mama's Boys 80's concert. Picture is clear and the sound is great. A trio hailing from Ireland, this guys can metal it out! They never became in the status of the other UK bands (Iron Maiden, Judas Priest etc) of 80's metal, but they pulled there own weight. A collection to be had in your 80's metal collection!",1426636800,,480,4.404494382022472
