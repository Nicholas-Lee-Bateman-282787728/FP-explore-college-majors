5564963,5,B00BAGJB94,She is soo awesome!! love working out with her! she is intense and fun all at the same time!! Fun Fun Fun!,1369872000,,106,3.8636363636363638
5564964,5,B00BAGJB94,I found out about blogilates last year on tumblr. I did them on YouTube but the lag and buffering from low wifi connection would always put a damper on my workouts which is why I am so glad that Cassey made a DVD! The DVD is so nice because all you do is pop it in and follow along. The music is something that I also really enjoy. Her spirit always makes me feel happier and want to continue to work out. It makes it fun but also challenging. She has modifications for a lot of the moves if you are just beginning or you just need to work your way up because these moves are pretty advanced. Ive tried other DVDs but none are as fun or give you as fast results as Casseys DVD. I now look forward to working out and I can avoid lags. You can also take along the printed insert if you are traveling and don't want to damage the DVD. If Cassey makes another DVD I would definitely buy it!,1369440000,4,886,4.011299435028248
5564965,5,B00BAGJB94,Love thus DVD!  Been doing Pilates for over 10 years and have purchased many DVDs and have gone to Pilates studios.  I was looking for a bigger challenge and need more advanced moves and this DVD delivers.  Beginners can do this although I think it will take you a long time to work up to the moves.  This is a great DVD for intermediates and above.  Highly recommend.,1367798400,4,368,4.352941176470588
5564966,5,B00BAGJB94,"The package was suppose to come thursday the week I got it, It arrived on that monday! i turned the video on and Cassey's personality that made me love her youtube videos were prominent on her DVD. I cant wait to get better!",1365984000,,224,4.232558139534884
5564967,5,B00BAGJB94,"I love Cassey's YouTube videos, and have always found her to be so motivating and fun to work out to!  I don't use her workouts as often as I'd like to, though, since I tend to use DVDs.  I pre-ordered this directly from her when it came out, and just love it!

The workout is an hour long, and it works you from head to toe.  I've done a lot of yoga but am a pilates newbie, but Cassey gives excellent form pointers that make this easy to follow along with.  I do this in front of a cheap long mirror so I can check my form, and I always feel like I'm in good alignment, thanks to her excellent cueing.

This might not be a good choice for absolute beginners, but I think that you could still modify many of the moves if you're new to working out.  She also provides a workout card along with the DVD, so that you can replicate the exact exercises and order if you're not able to take the DVD with you.

I love Cassey's energy and enthusiasm, which are infectious and fun!  I found myself laughing out loud several times at some of her comments! She knows just when you're about to give up -- and encourages you to keep on going!

This workout was actually filmed by her parents, and I also love the idea of supporting Cassey by buying this since she provides so much free content with her YouTube videos on her blog.  This was truly a labor of love project, and I'm happy to support her!

I hope you find this helpful!",1365379200,12,1420,4.142335766423358
5564968,5,B00BAGJB94,"This is a fantastic workout!  I used to do a lot of yoga and barre (I have reviewed other videos on amazon in the past), but now I am obsessed with pilates.  I'm seeing serious changes in my body with pilates. I'm actually going to wear shorts this summer, which I haven't done in at least a few years. This workout is NOT like other pilates home workouts. I have Mari Winsor videos and they are way too easy.  This is like going to an actual pilates mat class at a studio.  You will feel the burn and be challenged!  Cassey is an excellent instructor and very motivating.  I love to workout and workout almost everyday. I do this workout and other Cassey workouts. I have never felt this motivated to workout before.  This video is still difficult for me and I have to rest sometimes.  I like this b/c I'm not bored with the workout and have something to challenge me.  I like how it is a total body workout and a good length for those who want a full workout.  Can't go wrong with this purchase.  If you are a true beginner you may want to try some of her youtube beginner workouts and work your way up to this more challenging workout.  If you are looking for an intermediate/advance routine, this is for you.  It will not disappoint! I have never been as satisfied with any workout routine than I have been with Cassey.  The only thing better would be going to a studio and paying the big bucks.  You can google Cassey Ho and find out more about her.  She is really great and can change your body :)",1365292800,22,1503,4.257950530035336
5564969,5,B00BAGJB94,"This is a very motivating DVD, I am new to Pilates, but Cassey is such a motivator and she gives you ways to alter the poses if you are new, ways to challenge yourself if you are experienced in Pilates.  Love it!",1365292800,,212,4.0476190476190474
5564970,5,B00BAGJB94,"I love this workout!  I'll admit I don't have a lot of experience with Pilates.  Moira Stott is the only other instructor that I've used.  Moira and Cassey are almost exact opposites in style.  Moira is very serious and Cassey is a hoot.  I used to approach Moira's workouts with a sense of duty, telling myself that the workout is good for me.  But, that was kind of like talking myself into eating broccoli. I know it's good for me, but there is a definite dread factor.  Not so with Cassey and Pop Pilates.

This 64 minute workout consists of 30 exercises, including some great stretches.  The set is a clean, white, modernistic room.

Why I love this workout:

* Cassey!  She is so enthusiastic, funny and sincere; I can't help but smile even though my muscles are screaming.  I especially enjoyed her comments during the ""earthquake"" move.  Boy is that move aptly named!  My entire body was shaking.  And, she is just as nice in person as she is on the DVDs.  I had the good fortune to `meet' her via my blogging.

* It's tough!  Okay, so I probably shouldn't have bought this High Intermediate/Advanced Pilates since I don't really have any Pilates experience, but I love advanced workouts even if I can't do them at first since it gives me something to work towards.

* Cassey's meticulous form pointers.  With Pilates, it is very easy to get out of alignment, especially with the harder exercises.  Cassey's great reminders help prevent that.

* The deep stretches coming at just the right time, after a tough segment.

* The DVD setup.  You can do the entire workout, or choose which exercises you want to do.

* No equipment needed.  I'm getting a little tired of workouts that require you to have a room full of equipment.  All you need for this workout is a mat.

* The enclosed workout card.  You can do this workout anywhere, using the card for reference.

I had to modify some, okay most, of the exercises.  During the core work, I supported my neck with my hands.  For several of the leg routines, I put the opposite leg on the floor.  But I still got a great workout.  How do I know?  My muscles are still screaming and it's been a few hours since I did this workout.

I love Cassey's style, but it may not be for everyone.  She does tend to chatter on and on and most of it is light ""California Valley Girl.""  You may want to check out her YouTube videos to see if you will click with her.

All said, I highly recommend this DVD.  Not only will you get a great workout, but you'll be smiling all day long.",1363910400,68,2523,4.386117136659436

5564975,5,B00BAGJB94,"I was shaking internally by the end of this workout. Seems like a very mild workout because it's mostly matwork, and I'm used to a more active session with a different trainer, but these moves seriously add up. I felt I deserved my rest by the end of it. The background was very serene and minimal, and Cassey's personality was fun and encouraging.",1481414400,7,348,4.5396825396825395
5564976,5,B00BAGJB94,This is a terrific workout.  I had to get this one too because I love her Flat Abs Fast DVD.  Cassey is motivating and fun.  It's like she is with me in the room!  I'm looking for more Cassey Ho workouts.,1480550400,,204,3.902439024390244

5564979,4,B00BAGJB94,"Cassie is great! I've watched her for a while on YouTube and Facebook.  Finally, I bought this video and I have to tell you she actually helped to enhance my form.  I have been doing Pilates for a number of years now.  Her kind and informative instructions on certain moves truly aided in the effectiveness of my workouts.  She is very perky and encouraging.  It is a great ""good morning"" workout.  Now, at 5:00 a.m., sometimes I am not so thrilled to hear the perkiness but it does give a great start to the day.  I also found that some of her moves are more challenging than most Pilates workouts.  I love that about this video.  It gives me a new goal to work towards and challenges new muscles I never knew I had.",1467417600,3,717,4.291044776119403
5564980,3,B00BAGJB94,"I did not like this as much as I like her Youtube videos. She talks a lot during this which is okay but I found it more annoying than usual. Compared to her Youtube videos which are typically under ten minutes long, this is an hour program. You have the option to skip around from the menu but I found I didn't like that layout. For someone like me I think I would benefit from creating a Youtube playlist of her short videos rather than watching this one.

As for the exercises itself, this is definitely not for beginners. I am somewhat athletic and still found myself really struggling to do half of what she does. I think this is great for someone who wants to build up their muscles and endurance, but I think for pure beginners I would suggest something a little bit easier to start you off. I will likely continue doing this but still do not enjoy it as much as her short videos.

Definitely not for beginners. I don't like this video as much as her Youtube videos. It is long and I usually don't have an hour every day to do pilates. I prefer to target a different area every day and usually only spend about 20 minutes a day working out.",1466467200,3,1146,4.252293577981652

5564985,5,B00BAGJB94,"This DVD is some serious Pilates business. I've done a lot of Pilates videos, and so far this is the most challenging one I have come across. That's my personal opinion as an active person at an intermediate Pilates level.

It is true that Cassey is quite vocal during the video, but I can appreciate her high energy because she's trying to push people through some rather difficult moves. After the first few times, I started to turn down the volume so I could just make out her cues, and then play music in the background.

This woman is sharing some pretty great moves with the public. I highly recommend.",1455926400,3,608,4.5181818181818185
5564986,3,B00BAGJB94,"It's pretty long would have been better if she broke it up into 2 workouts on the disc, she imakes a lot sounds that seam more like shes doing something else....

Her youtube is way better.",1455667200,,341,4.412698412698413
5564987,5,B00BAGJB94,"This is a fun, yet challenging Pilates video. Cassey is a wonderful, motivational instructor. I also love the 20 minute bonus 'beginners' workout.

5564990,5,B00BAGJB94,"This is definitely a challenging workout! I've never done pilates before and bought this intermediate to advanced DVD. LOL! however I enjoy the difficulty and know that I'll get stronger. Ive worked out for years and assumed Id need something more than basic. Well, it's definitely not basic. An hour seemed long but I never noticed during the workout. This will be great for colder weather when I can no longer take walks and run.",1447891200,3,431,4.76

By far the toughest mat Pilates workout DVD I've seen, and I go through a lot of workout DVD. Ive been a long time fan of the Windsor Pilates DVD set. This is Windsor Pilates on crack! Just a great, intense full body workout. I highly recommend.",1444953600,5,407,4.368421052631579
5564994,5,B00BAGJB94,"Great at home workout video. She does a great job in hyping you up, especially in the morning to workout through her enthusiastic personality. Her video workouts really help ton you up and get you in shape. Granted most of her videos are online on YouTube, what I like about the DVD is I can take it with me when I travel and use it in hotels with not-so-reliable internet.

She keeps you in the moment and cheers you on. I am 50 and and in okay shape, so I do have to modify some of the moves and I couldn't do as many reps but I think I'll be able to do it without modifications in the future.",1440460800,4,395,3.8292682926829267

5564997,5,B00BAGJB94,This is just what I needed. I love her videos on YouTube as well.  I love the fact that after this video you can go to her blogilates site and download a calendar to do the workout for the month.  I didn't know anything about Pilates until I watched her videos.  If she does anymore in the future I will purchase.  She is very funny and fun you can't get bored watching her videos.,1439251200,2,381,4.108108108108108
5564998,3,B00BAGJB94,"Good workout!  But the instructor, Cassey Ho is so incredibly annoying to listen to.
And what is with the elevator music.....you would think for a young
person, the music would be so much more inspiring and modern.

If it weren't for the annoying instructor and the music, I would have rated it higher,
because it is a good workout.....but music and likeability of the instructor
is HUGE for me!!!

Will have to mute from now on and just play my own music.",1439251200,6,456,4.536585365853658

She def gets an A+ for being a great instructor! she talks through the whole dvd and does it with smile and she's so funny!! Her honesty, enthusiasm down to earth personality comes through the dvd.  There is no distracting other people in the dvd, just her and I love that she does the whole workout with you vs other trainers stop and spot the other people in workout which can be distracting.  The background is pretty and modern and not distracting.  The music is appropriate and not boring.  So glad I purchased this and can't wait to do it more!! Thank you Cassey!

She seemed very glam princess girly-girl (no offense Cassey, I'm just a total tomboy!)  but with all the positive reviews for Pop Pilates and her incredible physique I decided to give the DVD a try. After my first workout I have to say I have nothing but mad respect for the woman! She does the whole workout, talking throughout, while I sweat my butt off, barely able to make it through each set. Her upbeat attitude and funny side comments make the entire hour pass by so quickly. Her spunk, and yes even her girly-girl factor makes the DVD feel like I'm working out with my friend and her tireless positivity encourages me to hold it longer, higher, one more, c'mon you got it, go! I've already noticed by my second workout that I'm able to do more reps and hold better form. I have no doubt that if I stick to DVD and do it 2-3 times a week like she recommends, I'm going to be stronger, leaner and definitely way more fit. I highly recommend this workout to anyone who likes pilates, no matter your skill level. Get it, try it, you'll see.",1424390400,18,1108,4.326923076923077

I'm seeing that as I do it regularly, I get better and better at these challenging moves.

5565025,5,B00BAGJB94,"Having made the commitment to get back into shape as a middle-aged woman, I took to Youtube to find videos and instructors who would help ease me back into the fitness fold.  Blogilates has been a HUGE asset in that regard.

Cassey is a fantastic instructor, but her style might be off-putting to some (she's obviously aiming for a younger target audience, which is evident through her personality and use of modern pop music for her videos).  For my part, I love it.  She's very perky, bubbly, and energetic,  and her videos are upbeat, which is a really big help in the motivation department.  If you're looking for someone solemn, you won't find it here.  If you think that personality would annoy you, you won't like her.  But if you're looking for a great motivator and instructor, you really should check out her website and video collection.

Now, if you think her personality means she wouldn't be a great instructor, you'd be completely wrong.  She takes great care to instruct on proper form and reminds you throughout her workouts to watch your breath, your core, etc.  I find this incredibly helpful because when a move becomes tough, I often forget to pay attention to these important basics.  I need the constant reminders about form.

What I find great about her videos is that she does them with beginners and advanced gurus in mind - she always demonstrates beginners and advanced methods and makes it so that even the most out-of-shape person can get in a great workout (her workouts are TOUGH!).  While I really like using equipment, her videos are largely equipment free, so as long as you have a somewhat comfortable floor, you can start her routines with absolutely nothing but a DVD/video.",1409097600,3,1712,4.77891156462585

Five stars for cassey! shes so cheerful and knows exactly what to say to motivate you!!def. a recommendation for all of you wanting to get in shape! oh and do you have a smartphone?? download her app...so many before and after pics... videos on your phone.... exchange recipes!! where do i begin section!!! and....... motivation from others working just as hard or harder!!!!! sorry about the long review! had to let you know! :)",1403136000,4,1056,4.534031413612565
5565029,4,B00BAGJB94,"I love this workout DVD. Cassey Ho is amazing! My only complaint would be with the DVD menu setup. When you go to the Interactive Exercise Library and choose a ""target"" spot, it doesn't play through all of the ones in the section that you choose. Instead, it only plays the individual exercise selected and then you have to go back to the main menu and start all over again. This wouldn't be SO bad, but the menus take a bit to load and so it's not conducive to a fluid workout. I would love to see this implemented on a future DVD. Other than that, it's great!!!",1400198400,3,563,4.222222222222222

That said, I was hoping for a more enjoyable workout with this DVD. It's all personal preference though. I just happen to not enjoy several of the pilates moves she chose for this DVD. Some of the camera angles are kind of weird, too. BUT if you love Cassey or Pilates I would recommend this. It is a very good workout and will leave you sore.",1398556800,2,479,4.217391304347826

5565032,5,B00BAGJB94,It's a 1 hour intense workout routine with the option of focusing on target areas. If you're a fan of Cassey's workouts on YouTube then I think you'll enjoy this DVD. She recommends doing it 2-3xs a week for 3 of weeks and you'll feel the difference.,1398038400,3,250,4.340425531914893
5565033,3,B00BAGJB94,"I love Cassey's YouTube tutorials, so I purchased the DVD. I hate to give it a low rating, but I could not get through this work out, not in the least. I am a runner and I do hot yoga and reformer Pilates. I have always wanted to try mat pilates. Cassey's techniques will give you results, but this should be marketed towards people with mat Pilates experience. I know that you will get results because even though I barely made it through the beginning of the workout, I was sore the next day.

I may give the DVD another shot, but my first impression is disappointment.",1397952000,7,571,4.336448598130841
5565034,5,B00BAGJB94,"I would be the first to buy it if she did. Her workouts are fun and tough. You can choose to do a total body workout or the DVD lets you choose certain parts to work: arms and upper body, lower abs, core, legs and thighs, obliques (muffin tops), and butt. The trainer, Cassey Ho, is fun to workout with because she talks to you while she instructs you so it's like working out with one of your friends. I love her You Tube videos as well but I would rather have something I can easily play on my TV...thus my DVD purchase. :)",1397865600,3,525,4.0576923076923075

5565036,5,B00BAGJB94,"I found Cassey on YouTube while on vacation and have been doing her videos almost everyday since.  I was excited to get her DVD which has a full hour of a total body workout.  Cassey is a super teacher, even through a digital medium.  She has an infectious way of positively motivating you to keep going while at the same time, also giving suggestions for modifications.  She also does the full workout with you while talking the entire time and never gets winded!  Great motivation!
The DVD has a bit of everything for the whole body.  Definitely check out the interactive section for different ways to group your exercises if you don't have time to do the whole thing or you want to focus on one area.  Great workout, great production, great teacher!  Thanks Cassey!",1397260800,4,768,4.637037037037037
5565037,5,B00BAGJB94,"This DVD is GREAT!  I'm definitely a beginner at Pilates, but I've adjusted well and quite fast to this work out. It is definitely a challenge, but it's not impossible to do. I love the fact that I can do this work out weekly without getting board with it and without outgrowing it too fast. I've been doing this workout for at least 3 weeks now, and it's still a challenge! I love that. I like the fact that my DVD also came with a 20-minute workout for beginners. I love that Cassey is very knowledgeable about Pilates and she tells you how to position yourself and informs you of alternative positions you can do if you have lower back issues or if you're just too tired to continue. I also love the fact that, if you don't have time to do the full body workout, or if you want to work particular parts of your body on a certain day, you can choose the workout that focuses on the part of your body that you want to work on. She is VERY positive and energetic. I really like this DVD. I got mine from Target. My goals is to do the total body workout up to twice a week. Lastly, this DVD is put together very well. It flows well and the set Cassey works out in is appealing to the eye. I would recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a challenge and looking to get in shape.",1397088000,,1277,4.108

I wear a HR monitor while I workout and yesterday, my HR monitor said I burned over 800 calories doing this video. The lowest my HR monitor has ever registered while doing this workout is 500 calories. Cassey is a chatty girl, though, so if that's not your style you might need to put the volume way, way down. But she really does have a bubbly personality.

The only complaint is, I liked this DVD so much I went to her website and noticed that you could get this DVD for like $15. It's also available at Target. I received this DVD as a Christmas gift so I really hope my Mimi (grandmother) who bought this for me off of Amazon didn't get hosed.",1389312000,2,738,4.197183098591549

But, I was looking for something to suplement my other workouts that was low impact, but still effective.  I hate doing a workout and feel like I'm wasting my time.  I have to say, this dvd is excellent.  I really was sore the next day, which is quite unusual for me.  It was a total body workout, with no high impact moves, so it gives my joints a break.  Because of the dvd, I have also discovered her website full of FREE videos.  If you are on the fence about this dvd, check them out.  Not only are they excellent, I think they accurately portray her workout style and personality.",1386806400,4,742,4.205673758865248

pros
-all bodyweight exercises
-lots of beginner modifications
-Casey's upbeat personality (other reviews didn't like it as much, but personally I like how positive she is).
-lots of new exercises
-Casey was fantastic with cueing and reminds you when to breathe.

cons
-duration (dvd runs for an hour. I prefer shorter workouts).
-I wore my hrm and noticed my heart rate did not ever go over 100 bpm. Granted, because this is a pilates dvd that is probably not out of the ordinary.",1383350400,3,734,4.273381294964029

5565047,5,B00BAGJB94,"I discovered Cassey Ho's workout series via Youtube, and I was blown away at her positive attitude.  Her positivity is contagious!  I started out doing her workouts on youtube, and went to her website, Blogilates and found that she was doing the DVD.  I ordered the DVD on Amazon, and have been doing it every day for the last 4 months.  The moves are challenging and tough, but if you stick with it you will see amazing results!  Cassey makes you feel like you're working out with a friend, and she doesn't make you feel bad if you can't keep up.  For any of you who are skeptical, check out her youtube series before making the purchase and stick with it!
Also, I just want to add that all of the moves definitely serve their purpose, and when Cassey says: ""You're going to feel this"", you really will!  I love the Candlestick Dippers, and the little card that comes with the DVD.  For times I can't do the DVD, I use the card and follow the routine.  Also, Cassey included a personal thank you note in the DVD!  How cool is that?",1380758400,7,1032,4.328125
5565048,4,B00BAGJB94,"I recommend this to people who have more experience with Pilates workouts.

5565050,5,B00BAGJB94,"After having checked out Blogilates on Youtube, I decided to give Cassey's DVD a try.

This is absolutely a whole body workout. Whew, I'm sore just thinking about it. I have trouble hitting my triceps hard enough, but the tricep sequence is awesome. Some other reviewers have not enjoyed Cassey's constant commentary. I normally have a low threshold for chatter, but have found that her goofy dialogue keeps me entertained, instead of focusing on how I'm feeling like one big vat of lactic acid buildup. Plus, mad props to her for being able to do this workout and talk at the same time.

Cassey is cheerful and positive, and pretty silly, all while leading an effective and well-organized workout routine. She effectively emphasises proper form and breathing cues periodically, which is important to me. All in all, I find this video to be well rounded. I have, and will continue to, recommend it to my family and friends.",1377734400,27,923,4.8354430379746836

Apparently some other reviewers found Cassey's chatter distracting (some of it was a little hokey and silly, but that's whatever for me), but I didn't mind it. Frankly, I think it's downright impressive that she can chatter while busting out some of these moves. They seem simple at first, but you repeat them over and over until you feel things burning.
