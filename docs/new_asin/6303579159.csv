7851632,5,6303579159,"I bought this set when it first came out and I remember being so excited to get it.  I use to record their shows on little cassette tapes when they were on originally.  Obviously I couldn't see the shows but I could listen to them and the songs. I lent this set to a 'friend' and when it was returned the book and watch were missing and some of the tapes did not work.  As with my other purchase, I was very, very impressed with the care that was taken of the items and with the packaging of the item when it was sent.  Although I now have their shows on DVD's - this set holds a special place in my heart.",1482278400,,606,3.942622950819672

7851635,5,6303579159,"If you were able to remember what it was like during the mid to late 60s on television, then you probably have wonderful memories of watching the classic sitcom ""The Monkees"" on NBC. These 4 remarkably talented boys (Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork, David Jones and Micky Dolenz) provided a fun and refreshing viewing experience, which was highlighted by their amazing comedic and musical talents. In its first season, ""The Monkees"" went on to score a major upset to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, besting long-time favorites ""The Andy Griffith Show"", ""Bewitched"", ""Get Smart"" and ""Hogan's Heroes"". The series ran for only 2 seasons, producing a total of 58 episodes. Over a year after the series ended, the group appeared in a one-time special entitled ""33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee"". Now, all 58 episodes and the special are conveniently packaged together in this brilliant collector's boxed set, featuring all of the shows (in original broadcast order) on a total of 21 videotapes. The handsome packaging faithfully duplicates a variation of the exterior of a television set. Also included is a special book that features written text about the series and synopsis of every episode. These episodes also feature a great selection of songs from 8 of the group's albums. Many of these songs were filmed in such a way that they could all serve as the prototypes for the music video, which were first popularized on the MTV cable channel. Interestingly, it was MTV that revived this series to an entirely new generation during a 22-and-a-half hour marathon of the show in February 1986. Among the episodes featured in this set are ""Royal Flush"", ""Here Come The Monkees"" (the series' pilot show), ""The Monkees In Paris"", ""Mijacogeo-The Frodis Caper"" and the documentary-like ""On Tour"". What makes this program so much fun is how well it still holds up today, even after 40 years. Although this group may have been made up for a television series, they went on to become music legends and pop culture icons, and this set shows why.",1235174400,5,2043,4.959183673469388
7851636,5,6303579159,This is truly a great show. The songs are super. The guys are so funny. If you love the Monkees I strongly suggest buying this box set. I have the box set and I just love it.,1049500800,3,174,3.72972972972973
7851637,5,6303579159,"This box set is wonderful! The Monkees were for everyone and for all ages. Im 20 and haved loved them since I was 7. My nephew is 3 and has learned all their names watching these episodes. His favorite is Peter and mine is  Mike. The Monkees were clean and funny. The Monkees are educational in  teaching the history of tv and about the 60's. This box set is well worth  what you pay for it. Every time my nephew comes over now he wants to watch  The Monkees. The box set is so neat, because it includes 33 1/3 revolutions  per monkee. The Monkees are something the whole family can sit down and  watch. This box set is truly a piece of tv history and should be cherished  for many generations. Urge people to buy the box set before they get gone.",963792000,9,747,4.181818181818182
7851638,5,6303579159,"This is trully a collectiors item! Any Monkees fan should have this! Even if you were a fan in the 1960's of them and want to bring back memories. Even if your children are fans of them as well. They should have it, I know. I have bothered my parents for years  until I got my own and it is fantastic. I strongly believe the numbered  ones (released in 1995) are rare. Mine is one of them (released in 1995).  If you are a Daydream Believer, you should have this. I love the entire box  set and will always treasure it!",936576000,16,519,4.108910891089109
