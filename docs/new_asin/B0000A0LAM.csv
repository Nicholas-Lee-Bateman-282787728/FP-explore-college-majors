7995178,4,B0000A0LAM,"Purchased for my 16 year old grandson who has been playing guitar for several years and now is trying his hand at song writing. He found the instructions helpful but would have liked more time spent teaching breathing and pacing.  Four stars is his rating.  Price, packaging and shipping all exceeded expectations.",1420156800,2,314,5.019230769230769
7995179,5,B0000A0LAM,"what can I say? just buy it, it's worth every cent. The man is a legend, I also purchased his other dvd with tony rice, equally as good. thankyou, from a man of few words, but not a lot needed. m.p. carroll.",1338681600,5,207,3.9523809523809526
7995180,4,B0000A0LAM,"I like the DVD, it gives some interesting advice on phrasing and singing, it is not for beginners but others might find the DVD useful. There is very little guitar playing advice but overall I like it and would recommend it to a friend.",1334620800,3,236,4.386363636363637
7995181,5,B0000A0LAM,"Another great great video from Homespun, absolute 5 stars on the singing instructions...and the only reason I am not rating the guitar instruction is I have not gotten around to working on that yet.

Peter Rowan is talented, knowledgable, analytical and communicative. Happy Traum ( ?  I think thats who it is) sits with him and asks just the right questions to help the master explain concepts to those of us ummm.... not so masterful.

I'd call this essential info for bluegrass singing and really great for thinking about expression in music in general. I am a woman learning to find my voice, and my range is similar to Peter's ( though I cant hit the lowest notes he can). Men with lower vocal ranges would probably find this extra helpful to start getting up to the higher notes used in the bluegrass style.

This video covers so many nuances of singing in this style. Vocal range, breath management as it relates to phrasing, and techniques for reaching notes are covered but the blend of practical and philosophical insight offered is what makes it special. Peter is so cool and laid back and he shares stories of his musical history with Bill Monroe,  clearly crediting and honoring him for his influence. That makes this an interesting video to just watch and listen to.",1326758400,,1280,4.721973094170403
7995182,5,B0000A0LAM,"Having played banjo and guitar for many years, I knew singing to be the most musical instrument of all. An injury keeps me from sitting straight and from standing for long periods. Applying the methods of phrasing and breathing covered by the legendary artist Peter Rowan has allowed me to greatly enjoy singing , I guess really, for the first time. I will not win any grammy's soon but I can again sing alone and with others much better than before this wonderful DVD. I am sure even pro's can learn from the many years of musical experience captured on this production.",1236124800,,571,4.607843137254902
7995183,5,B0000A0LAM,"I confess ignorance in having never heard Peter Rowan before, and that I only purchased this DVD because of Happy Traum's recommendation.  I was treated to a great surprise.  Rowan's singing is stunning, and the viewer is skillfully treated to expert guidance from Happy Traum.  Happy has the wonderful ability to slow an artist down and anticipate where a student is going to need extra help.  Like most all of Homespun, this is another excellent DVD that no guitarist and/or vocalist should be without.",1214265600,5,504,4.964285714285714
