8076008,5,B000A7ZL0M,"I have this DVD and although it comes recommended, you can spend the same amount of money or less buying the FIRST SEASON of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS now available on Amazon.com.  These episodes ultimately will be released in subsequent seasons.  Though I do recommend you get the ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS COMPANION by Wikstrom and Grams, also available on Amazon as it gives you tons of trivia about these episodes and worth the money.  Examples?

POISON - Filmed August 21 and 22, 1958.  Broadcast Oct. 5, 1958.

First episode of the fourth season.

One of sixteen episodes Hitchcock would direct for the series.

When VARIETY reviewed the episode in their papers, they accidentally called the episode ""Strange Tale of Poison"" when in fact, the episode was entitled ""Poison.""

THE PERFECT CRIME - Filmed July 17, 18 and 19, 1957.

Broadcast October 20, 1957.

Also directed by Hitchcock.  Vincent Price is guest, and recalled ""I was terribly excited about working with Hitchcock.  There were only two of us in it (Price and Grgeory), just two characters and I thought it was going to be wonderful.  His entire direction was, he came on the set one day and he said, 'Faster.'  [laughs]  And so we did it a little faster and he said, 'That's better.  A little bit faster.'  Then he went over and slept!""

DIP IN THE POOL - Filmed April 15 and 16, 1958.

Broadcast June 1, 1958.

Also directed by Hitchcock, this one is laden with in-jokes.  Hitchcock's famous cameo in 1944's LIFEBOAT was redone again in this episode by way of newspaper advertisement.  Hitchcock is seen reading an issue of his own mystery magazine, and the life preserver hanging on the wall near the end of the episode has the words S.S. HITCHCOCK printed on it.

ONE MORE MILE TO GO - Filmed Jan. 9, 10 and 11, 1957.

Broadcast April 7, 1957.

This was one of only two episodes in which Hitchcock delivered his deadpan introduction and closer in rhyme.  Usually Hitchcock filmed two versions of the opening and closing, and the different one aired in the U.K. instead of the U.S.  However, for this episode the wording he delivers does not change - instead the camera is locked in for a closeup for the U.K. version.

If you like trivia such as this, there's MUCH more trivia to be learned about these episodes (and others) so I recommend the book, THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS COMPANION by Wikstrom and Grams as it's 660 pages thick(!) and covers everything you want to know about the show.  It's also available on Amazon.com so do yourself a favor and grab that book before it goes out of print.",1154995200,,2571,4.686800894854586
8076009,5,B000A7ZL0M,"This is the only DVD in the Alfred Hitchcock Presents series in which all four of the shorts can be ranked among Hitchcock's features. Especially ""Poison"" and ""One more mile..."". Now, if you buy this, watch out for the imported Chinese edition, for the quality of the transfer is far below that of the American edition and, in the case of this specific DVD, I think it's worth the extra dollars. Plus the American edition has optional audio and subtitles  (English, Spanish and French).",1130889600,5,486,4.785714285714286
