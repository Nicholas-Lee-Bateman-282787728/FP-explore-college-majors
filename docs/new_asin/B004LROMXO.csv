4401836,5,B004LROMXO,"I am still glowing from the distinct pleasure of having watched Laurence Fishburne so thoroughly realize a very intriguing and important figure in the civil rights struggle, Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

Laurence Fishburne has indeed come a long way from Cornbread, Earl, and Me.  He made his mark in his compelling portrayal of a struggling African-American father with fierce integrity in Boyz In the Hood and since then he has more than become the consummate actor.  He has maintained an air of integrity around him and his characterizations regardless of the weaknesses seem to possess at the very least a measure of dignity.

This performance can certainly be counted as an accomplishment.  Understanding of the world then is made very personal and thus very easy to relate to. Fisburne wonderfully exemplifies Marshall's strengths and poignantly reveals his weaknesses in this intriguing, very informative, difficult, colloquial, sad, and funny one-man show. The wonderful photography and sound effects combine to make for a compelling evening of theater.  Fishburne is in his element portraying the very human and ultimately exceptional example of leadership in the fight for civil rights.  I was a teenager when Marshall was appointed in the 60s and can assure you it was indeed a VERY tumultuous time.  It was eerie trying to celebrate and appreciate the magnitude of this progress while cities were going up in flames all around you.....and on a fairly regular basis.

.....obviously this was far more than an excellent theater production for me.....but isn't this just what good art form is supposed to do?!! :0)

I highly recommend this as not only an excellent one-man show with a tour-de-force performance but as more than a worthy addition to any movie library!  It has something to say to ANY disenfranchised community.",1300060800,,1888,5.218543046357616
4401837,4,B004LROMXO,I saw part of this stage drama on HBO a must it have for my collection. It was great to hear and see a superb depiction of a great legal adovocate for equal justice and civil rights. Mr Fishburne protrayed Justice Marshall is manner that gave life to the legal reasonings of great minds to utilize the essence of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to obtain the basic freedoms and access upon which our Nation was founded for Black Americans.

4401843,5,B004LROMXO,"I seldom feel compelled to write reviews for products when I have little to complement what has already been reviewed.  This is my exception.  This writing, production and acting is so exceptional I strongly suggest you view it.  However you acquire it you will not be disappointed.  I frequently will watch 10 to 15 minutes of a movie to determine whether it warrants viewing in entirety.  I did so with this production.  I realized after 25 minutes that it was revealing and true about our American Zeitgeist, i.e. spirit of out times,  I could not stop watching.  Regardless of your particular gender, race or affiliations you will not be disappointed.  The point is this production is compelling, sad, hilarious, informative, and human.

4401849,5,B004LROMXO,I highly recommend this video of Laurence Fishburne's one man performance.  I have watched this video several times and I each time there are nuances of the performance that I did not fully appreciate during my prior viewing. Thurgood Marshall and Laurence Fishburne are icons of our time!,1416441600,,289,5.020833333333333

4401853,5,B004LROMXO,I sat in the second row center of the Broadway play and was mesmerized by Lawrence Fishburne's protrayeral of this great man.  I learned so much about Thurgood that I made sure to purchase this to share with my husband and son who are not theatre goers.  They too enjoyed the production.,1404604800,,287,4.5
4401854,5,B004LROMXO,"Awesome portrayal of a Supreme Court Justice that is overlooked in today's society.  Witty, serious, educational and thoroughly entertaining.  Fishburne at his best!",1404172800,,165,6.130434782608695
4401855,5,B004LROMXO,"I truly enjoyed watching this one-man play!  I hesitated to purchase, believing that one person on stage would be boring.  But as a fan of both history and Laurence Fishburne, I decided to take a chance.  Mr. Fishburne reminds again that he is a great actor.  He truly captured the spirit of Thurgood Marshall.  This was far from boring!  I love when I am both educated on a topic and entertained at the same time. It is what I strive to do in my classroom with my own students.  Although I will not be able to show it in my classroom due to some curse words (district policy), I do recommend that families watch and discuss it together.  The performance was outstanding, as was the insight into the life of a great historical figure.",1402876800,,734,4.425373134328358
4401856,5,B004LROMXO,"Laurence Fishburne  does a wonderful job in his performance in this one man show. He ages from youthful to an elder Thurgood Marshall. It is serious but funny, sad at times but uplifting and inspirational. It is a very real look into history that educates you without you even knowing that you're being educated.",1399939200,,312,4.777777777777778
4401857,5,B004LROMXO,Excellent portrayal of Thurgood Marshall.  For 105 minutes Laurence is able to capture the spirit of this amazing man. His one man show is well worth seeing!!,1394496000,,158,4.851851851851852
4401859,5,B004LROMXO,I was so captivated by this one man show when I first saw it that I tried ordering it before it was even available.,1392768000,,115,3.8333333333333335
4401860,5,B004LROMXO,"Someone said it was boring! I can't believe we saw the same performance. This was poignant, funny, fascinating and extremely educational. Laurence Fishburne was at his best in portraying this great man.",1392595200,2,202,5.34375

4401862,1,B004LROMXO,"Read Juan Williams' 1998 book, ""Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary' instead of trying to endure this B 'movie'.  The  so-called 'actor' presents a very long somewhat dull soliloquy full of  cursing, swearing, and profane remarks.  Not worth $9.99 or for that matter $0.99.  No acting. Just a boring monologue. Very disappointing.  Don't buy it.",1384560000,,351,5.528301886792453
4401863,5,B004LROMXO,"This work hasn't received enough press in my opinion. I wouldn't have know of it had my wife not purchased tickets to see the play at the Kennedy Center last year.  I learned a lot about this American hero during the play and later found myself wanting to see it again, so I bought the DVD.  Justice Marshall was a key player in the civil rights movement and his actions were not something I learned about in school, nor had I bothered to investigate them as an adult.  This play reveals a noble man of tremendous courage who decided to fight for civil rights within the law - quite a different approach than the civil disobedience approach of civil rights activists I did learn about in school - of course Dr Martin Luther King and Malcolm X.  I would be remiss not to comment that Lawrence Fishburne does an amazing job in this single-actor play - truly a remarkable performance.  Certainly a great family ""movie"" as well, I highly recommend buying/renting a copy to learn about a man of integrity who deserves a greater place in our history books than most of us realize.",1375488000,,1074,4.515463917525773
4401864,5,B004LROMXO,"I have been attending plays at the theatre since I was a small child. I have enjoyed many of them, but few have really wowed me like ""Thurgood."" The only thing better than this DVD is attending the play, which I have also done. One of the best plays I have ever seen, I have just fallen in love with Laurence Fishburne. An amazing performance, as during the short span of this play, you WILL believe that he IS Thurgood Marshall.  The segways are seamless as Fishburne maneuvers props and suddenly, you have entered a new scene in Thurgood's life. You will laugh. You will cry. You may even fall in love with this Shakespearean Theatre trained actor. You will not regret owning this elegant, classy, talented performance.  As a teacher, I can tell you that there is no better way to teach social studies and engage students, than to expose them to art like this!  LOVED IT!",1370563200,2,873,4.512658227848101
4401865,5,B004LROMXO,"Fishburne's acting is wonderful; he disappears behind Thurgood Marshall and makes the viewer feel as though s/he is actually listening to the Supreme Court Judge. In addition to being very entertaining, the film is also quite informative.",1369958400,,238,5.45945945945946
4401866,5,B004LROMXO,Phenomenally written and performed! Helping to communicate our nation's history in a very personal manner that helps you understand and relate to everything.,1367712000,,157,5.869565217391305
4401867,5,B004LROMXO,"This is the best insight into the Honorable Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall to date. Laurence Fishburne out did himself on this one man act. He was extraordinary in his portrayal of this great man and worthy of all and any awards that could be garnered for such an expert performance. Also, it should be mandatory that this DVD be included as part of every curriculum in every educational system's basic requirements in this entire country as it sheds ""light"" not only on the Honorable Thurgood Marshall and his struggles with racism in this country and the legal system, but just how extremely difficult it was to wade through the sinful wicked waters of hatred and unfairness in the U.S. as this country alleged its fairness and equality in the law of this land. This is a must see performance that provides an insight that is encoded only to be deciphered by those that are ""out-of-the-box"".",1365552000,,902,4.788461538461538
4401868,5,B004LROMXO,It's not the 'product' that I'm comment on - as far as quality/design - but the performance itself.  I've always been a fan of Laurence Fishburne - but this Emmy Award Winning entertainment is just magnificent!  'Thurgood Marshall' almost seems to 'age' on stage.  I would recommend this classic to all who have even the slightest interest in the life of this Supreme Court justice.,1364860800,,382,4.846153846153846
4401869,5,B004LROMXO,"This is truly outstanding.  I couldn't help thinking throughout the entire film that Laurence Fishburn has not received even 1/3 the acknowledgement of his talent as he should have.  I am buying several copies of this film to distribute to my students.  In saying this I'm not merely making the statement on the basis of his performance, but also on his depth of knowledge about the man. I feel, as someone who was around when Thurgood was in office, and who was well acquainted with the situation in the South,  during the 1950s and the restricted rights of African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement, that Fishburne is practically a reincarnation of Thurgood.  The film is funny and sad. Many of the unspoken nuances defy misinterpretation and lend a good deal of humor to the presentation. I would definitely recommend that anyone who has not seen this film, see it and live the experiences of those living in America during the 1950s,1960s and 1970s.

4401872,5,B004LROMXO,"I felt as if I were watching Thurgood himself. If you want to know the passion for law that drove Thurgood Marshal, start with this film and marvel at the life of Thurgood and the talent of Laurence Fishburne.",1359936000,,209,4.384615384615385
4401873,3,B004LROMXO,"I am a history teacher who loves this subject, however I was at times bored.  This film is in the style of a quasi-documentary, as Laurence Fishburne (who does a fine job of acting) talks about Marshall's life in the style of a filmed lecture before an audience.  I don't think this would keep the attention of a high school audience and for those very knowledgeable about the subject you may be disappointed with some of the glossed over and missing details in his lecture.  They take some Hollywood liberties with some details though it is presented more like a factual documentary.",1350777600,,584,4.705882352941177

4401875,5,B004LROMXO,"This is a very well done one-man show that I would expect is as enjoyable, important, and uplifting for those of us old enough to remember some of this history and those so young that it is seems like ancient myth.  It's funny and very human and very real.  It is important and relevant history rendered in an enjoyable and entertaining format.",1335225600,,344,4.532258064516129
4401876,5,B004LROMXO,"Thurgood was the ultimate in a one man stage show.  The super-simplistic stage set of a table, chairs, cane, and ultimately a judge's robe adds to the ""tour de force"" of this fantastic performance by Fishburne as Thurgood Marshall telling the story of his amazing life.  With only a few background slides flashed on a textured wall of the American flag behind him, the performance is spellbinding from beginning to end.

Howard University auditorium is the location HBO chose to film it and it proved the perfect locale.  Fishburne even incorporates a couple of late arrivers to the show into the performance for good effect.

History, humor, humanity and drama blend here in a way you have never seen before and may never seen again.  I intend to buy copies to donate to several local schools.",1328832000,3,794,4.801470588235294
4401877,1,B004LROMXO,"As always, Fishburne turns in great work here. However, it must be said that while Marshall has historical significance, he was an absolutely HORRIBLE Justice. It is quite clear from reading his opinions that he had little, if any, understanding of constitutional law, and no respect whatsoever for the principles supporting said law. In short, he was totally incompetent.

Yet, he was celebrated nonetheless for obvious reasons.

And here we are, all these years later, making PRECISELY the same mistake with Obama. We have a total incompetent with no respect for the country in a position of power, making a mess of everything he touches.

We'd all be quite a bit better off if men were judged by merit, mind, and act. Had that been the case, there would have been no reason whatsoever for this production to exist.",1327017600,3,817,4.863309352517986
4401878,5,B004LROMXO,"I have to admit that I've done Black History reports on many African Americans but seeing this one man stage play made me go out and read more about one of the most influential men to live. It was not just the portrayal that Laurence Fishburne presented on stage of Thurgood Marshall but the way he brought him to life. I've never been one big on stage plays but this truly gave me a complete reprise of how one man was able to show a display of talent. Watching him perform will shed light on anyone on what Thurgood had to go through to get to where he is. I'm looking forward to the DVD being release soon because this is an excellent learning tool for our youth today; to show them how hard work, determination, and sacrifice of not just an African American man but how an individual over came the odds of being one of the most important men to sit on the highest level of our justice systems.

I would also like to recommend that if you enjoyed watching Laurence Fishburne perform as Thurgood Marshall, you must see ""A Huey P. Newton Story"". This will give you a great insight on Huey P. Newton and how much of a difference he made in American history.",1306454400,,1157,4.307339449541284
