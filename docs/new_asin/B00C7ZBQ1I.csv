The story begins with a man cranking a printing press. ""General Lee Surrenders"" is the headline for April 1865. At war's end the horses and wagons were parceled out to the soldiers, allowing them to work for themselves when they go home. One man plans to move his family out west, to leave squabbling relatives behind. [This still happens.] A young boy shoulders his grandpa's rifle. The Colby's fight back. Grandma Spelvin hears the bad news. Mark Hayden will go to the law. Jed Colby gets 15 years for shooting Jed Spelvin. Mark heads west with his two children. One man has a team of oxen (the draft animal preferred for their fuel efficiency). Mark stakes a claim to his property. Fifteen years later Jed Colby is released from prison. His daughter Ellen has complaints. Joe Daggs will go west with the Colby's, they will settle in Nevada close to the Hayden ranch.

The Colby's steal Hayden's cattle until they can wipe them out. Ellen is headstrong. She tussles with Daggs. We learn about the Hayden ranch and its people. Will the Kentucky feud continue? Jed Spelvin says he will protect his property. Lynn Hayden rides by and meets Ellen, a lady. We learn about Ellen's past! Lynn shaves. [Some considered this a waster of time.] They share breakfast, then learn about their family names. Lynn learns more about the local conditions. A shot is fired at a young girl! Is this a trap? Lynn has a present for Ellen. That night cattle thieves drive off the white-faced cattle (Herefords for meat). Ellen learns the truth about ""White Cloud"", and kisses Lynn. Three Colby men attack Lynn, who wins the fight. Ellen tells her father of her plans.

The Colby men approach the Hayden ranch. The Hayden's defend themselves. Will the Hayden men arrive in time to chase the Colby gang away? Bill rides in tied to his saddle, dead. What will they do now? Mark Hayden rides in . There will be a chase. An explosion throws rocks into the canyon below. Daggs double-crosses Jed Colby. Lynn wounded, survives the blast to visit Ellen, then is hidden when Daggs appears. There is a fight between Daggs and Ellen. Lynn ends it. There will be a happy ending for Ellen and Lynn.

This was adapted from a Zane Grey novel. Did that young girl look like Shirley Temple? It is a good story about relocated families, if you can believe it. Not many Westerns used a story about feuding families. The quality of this film is very good for its age, and it is not a low budget production. The underdressed Ellen did not match the usual dress for women around the 1880s, or even the 1930s. Was her nude swimming an extra attraction?",1394755200,,2637,4.604255319148936

Action highlight of Henry Hathaway's fine Zane Grey adaptation is a dynamite-caused rockslide that kills all but one of a large group of vengeful riders.

Hathaway uses superimposed white letters to introduce characters/actors as they first appear. This goes on for almost 15 minutes. Seen in an uncredited role is adorable 5-year-old Shirley Temple, who is twice almost hit with rifle fire!

The two families in this Hatfield/McCoy feud story are the Haydens and the Colbys.

After Mark Hayden (Brecher) testifes against him, Jed Colby (Beery) is sentenced to 20 years for killing Mark's father-in-law. Jed stews in jail while the Haydens relocate from Kentucky to land near the Sierras (features beautiful outdoor cinematography of California's Big Bear Lake region).

Mark wants to end the bloody inter-family war but Jed has other ideas. Once paroled, he moves his clan west and renews hostilities with their sworn enemies. The above-mentioned rockslide is one of his ploys, as are cattle and horse rustling plus an arson attack on the Hayden property in which little Shirley is twice almost killed.

Despite its age, this PARAMOUNT western drama holds the attention. Highly recommended!

8578506,2,B00C7ZBQ1I,"This may be a fine, early Randolph Scott-starring, Henry Hathaway-directed Western.  It is hard to tell.  The original (from which this and other public domain copies derive) was obviously in poor shape with lots of splices, too-dark night scenes, film damage, and some missing frames.  It is a surprisingly brutal western for this early in the 30's.  I sought this out because of my fondness for the work of silent actress Esther Ralston.  Even in this almost unwatchable print, her verve and attractiveness stand out.  There is even a semi-nude swimming scene.  An interesting supporting cast includes Noah Beery Sr., Barton MacLane, Gail Patrick, Buster Crabbe, and Shirley Temple (!!).  We can hope for a true restoration but that seems unlikely for this B western.  Perhaps a better original exists that may show up on TCM.  TO THE LAST MAN (aka LAW OF VENGEANCE) is supposed to run about 70 minutes.  This TGG Direct copy runs at least five minutes less than that.  Other public domain copies--presumably also of poor quality and incomplete--are sold from Roan and Alpha Video.",1390003200,5,1083,4.988826815642458
