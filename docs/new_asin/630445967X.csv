883940,2,630445967X,"In this sillyass but amusing serial the Shadow does not have invisibility as he did in the radio series. This is given to the Black Tiger a peevish, prissy old fogey who fancies himself a leader of men. With numbskull underlings this fancy is not difficult to achieve and it is most amusing to hear these swaggering tough guys give out with a lot of sheepish ""Yes sirs"" to the Black Tiger's demands. As usual Horne gets a lot of comic mileage with the antics of the villains. Still one wonders why the Shadow was not made invisible so he could ""cloud men's minds"". Perhaps the producer did not want to spend the extra time and money on special effects or perhaps Horne himself felt that with his bad guys there wasn't  any minds out there to cloud. 2 1/2 stars.",997315200,,761,4.397163120567376
883941,4,630445967X,"Serial fans know that the chapterplays churned out by Columbia were seldom up to the standard of those made by Republic (compare BATMAN to THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL for proof), lacking the imagination, polish,  and furious pace found in the more famous studio's releases. THE SHADOW  comes as a bit of surprise, then, after reading some negative comments on  it. It must be pointed out that the character of the Shadow existed in  several incarnations during his time. The radio version is the most famous,  with his powers of invisibility, pretty assistang Margo Lane, and eerie  laughter. The pulp hero, by contrast, did not become invisible and was a  far more physical, though still eerie and mysterious, entity, with a vast  network of operatives at his disposal. In addition to these, there was a  lesser known version that ran as a newspaper strip and featured in his own  comic for several years. This took its cue mainly from the pulps, but made  the Shadow even more earthly and eliminated nearly all of his operatives.  The Columbia serial version takes its cue mainly from this incarnation.  Toss in radio's Margo Lane, (Harry) Vincent from the pulps and add The  Black Tiger, a villain with the radio Shadow's gift for invisiblity and  you've got an immensely enjoyable experience. Most of the faults found in  Columbia serials are certainly present, like woefully unimaginative chapter  endings (how many roofs can fall on the Shadow?), some indifferent pacing,  and a reliance on coincidence that's staggering even for a serial. However,  this one improves on Columbia's other efforts in two important departments.  First, the photography is great, frequently dark, appropriately shadowy,  and much more impressive than the ugly, nonexistent photography found in,  say, BATMAN. The scene in which the Black Tiger makes himself invisible in  order to address his (particularly idiotic) minions is very atmospheric,  and you'd better like it, because it's repeated in every chapter. Second,  this is an unusually well acted serial. Victor Jory is ideal casting as  Lamont Cranston/The Shadow. Jory was a successful stage actor who mainly  played supporting roles in feature films and rarely got the opportunity to  play the leading man. While starring in a Columbia serial may have been a  step down from his stage work, Jory clearly relishes ths spotlight, turning  in a whirlwind performance that's never less than perfect. And he looks  exactly like the illustrations of Cranston in the comics and pulps, too.  He's ably supported by a cast of serial/b-movie veterans including Veda Ann  Borg as Margo and Roger Moore as Vincent. And never has a serial villain's  true identity been more obvious than it is in THE SHADOW. This, along with  the sadly unavailable THE SPIDER'S WEB, is one of Columbian's best serials,  proving that maybe they should have just stuck to pulp characters.

883942,2,630445967X,"Radio's ""Lamont Cranston"" had a fine sense of justice, a sly sense of humor, and ""the power to cloud men's minds."" In the serial version, however, The Shadow terrorizes the underworld, takes no  nonsense from anyone, and is plainly visible in hat and cloak. Although  Victor Jory plays Cranston earnestly, the serial just barely takes itself  seriously: when the hammy villain speaks his lines with an overdone sneer,  or when Jory sneaks up on some gangsters DISGUISED AS A TREE, it's hard to  accept the film as a legitimate drama. But there are some good moments,  including very clever staging for the villain, who materializes as a  vaporous beam of light. Serial fans will enjoy this most, and Jory's  performance is the best part of the show (he's got The Shadow's trademark  laugh down cold!).",945129600,15,801,4.874074074074074

The fantastic action scenes will bring tears  to the old eyes who had the opportunity to see this movie serial at movie  theaters during the 40's and at the same time will make young eyes 'taste'  the chemistry and the excitement of a genuine classic cliffhanger serial.  Bizarre features, breathless fighting performances and explosions, old car  chasing and thrilling suspense are just a few of the ingredients of  ""The Shadow"", who is feared in the underworld and reputed to be  supernatural. Victor Jory plays Lamont Cranston, a noted scientist and  criminologist, who works in disguise in ""The Shadow"", the one who  combats a mysterious figure known as ""The Black Tiger"", whose mad  ambition is to acquire supreme financial power. The Shadow's true identity  is known only by a couple of people: Margot (Veda Ann Borg), his beautiful  secretary and Vincent (Roger Moore), his loyal ""chauffeur"".

7871932,4,630445967X,"There have been some lesser entries in The Shadow's storied past, Behind The Mask (1946), and International Crime (1938.) While on the flipside, The Invisible Avenger is very edgy, and the 1994 film is reaching another blu-ray release as a special edition this spring.

Although, with over 8 decades of pulp novels, radio programs, b-movies, and the like, this 15 part serial stands as one of the best portrayals of the darkened crimefighter to date.

The story is somewhat similar to a succesful Columbia serial from two years prior, The Spider's Web; both serials featuring an underworld crime boss targeting power stations and banks in the old depression era side streets of New York City. The speakeasy's were alive with hoodlums, Chinese rug shops smelled of ominous incense, and the streets were filled with newsies selling papers for pennies, a wonderful time of ages past caught on marvelous celluloid forever.

In this particular serial, The Black Tiger, a beast of the mind who seemingly vanishes into blinding light and orders his endless array of thugs to do unspeakable crimes, with the police in confusion, and the banks on the verge of collapse. The Shadow must do battle to protect the innocent and punish the guilty. For the message of those shady days of ages past, ""Crime does not pay! The Shadow Knows!""

This VHS home video release is in remarkable condition. The prints of all 15 episodes are in excellent shape, and actually projects quite clearly on a home theatre system. Top praise goes to Columbia Studios for preserving such a wonderful serial.

With patience, perhaps The Shadow will rise again to vanquish the forces of evil in the future. Keep your eyes peeled, because, The Shadow Knows!!!",1392249600,,1721,4.961805555555555

7871934,5,630445967X,"In the serial version, The Shadow goes into action after an attack on a radio station to save the lives of dozens attending a new television exhibit, almost becoming a victim himself from the exploding light bulbs. With The Shadow cloaked in black and the villain cloaked with invisibility, the scenario was certainly mystifying to an audience trying to associate the differences they heard each week on the program. According to the contract agreement between Street & Smith Publications and Columbia Pictures dated July 19, 1939, Columbia was granted permission to create the 15-chapter play based on the radio episode ""Prelude to Terror"" and a trio of Gibson's Shadow novels, ""The Green Hoods"" (August 15, 1938), ""The Lone Tiger"" (February 15, 1939) and ""Silver Skull"" (January 1, 1939).

John Nanovic and Walter Gibson both reviewed the screenplay for the entire serial and submitted a list of corrections and suggestions, which the studio promptly applied between the first and final draft (letter of confirmation from the studio dated July 21, 1939). The Shadow's guns, as instructed, were two .45 automatics at Gibson's request. (On the radio program, it was revealed that Lamont Cranston had two trusty automatic pistols, both Colt .45s, Model 1911A.)

The press book issued to theater managers suggested a radio tie-in with an insert of all the radio stations (complete up to press time) over which The Shadow program was broadcast. In the event that no local radio station offered the radio chiller, it was suggested the theater manager contact his local radio station. ""Impress the local director with enormous listener appeal,"" it suggested, revealing detailed promotional information could be obtained direct from Mr. William J. de Grouchy, c/o Street & Smith Publications, Inc., New York. Theater managers were also instructed to dress a street bally man in the eerie and mysterious outfit of The Shadow. The same press book offered theater managers a large number of Shadow merchandise, including masks, makeup kits, costumes, stationery and toy gun holsters -- all of which have been mistaken as promotional merchandise for the radio series.

It began on radio on the Detective Story Hour on July 31, 1930 as a character in the story.  James Curto was the voice 1930-31 and then Frank Readick Jr. (1931-37). The program became known as ""The Shadow"" on September 26, 1937.  Also providing the voice of ""The Shadow"" was Orson Welles (1937-38), Bill Johnstone (1938-43), Bret Morrison in 1943, John Archer in 1944 and Bret Morrison again in 1945-54.  The last radio program of ""The Shadow"" was broadcast December 26, 1954.
  They tried turning The Shadow into several motion pictures.  The Shadow Strikes (1937), International Crime (1938), both with Rod La Rocque.  Then Columbia decided to make ""The Shadow"" serial in 1940 for the movie theatres.  Similar to the Dead End Kids serials with Billy Halop (Junior G-Men [1940], Sea Raiders [1941], Junior G-Men Of The Air [1942]), they would show a chapter (episode) each week in the movie theatre.  Each episode was only 15 to 30 minutes long and each one ended with a cliff-hanger.  The next week, the theatre would show the next chapter.  You would see how the cliff-hanger turned out (of course, our hero survives), but in 15 minutes here is another cliff-hanger.  In ""The Shadow"" serial their are 15 episodes to enjoy and get the chills from.
 Victor Jory is ""The Shadow""/Lamont Cranston and successfully disguises himself as ""Lin Chang"".  Can you actually believe that is Victor Jory? Look at the chin closely.  It is Victor Jory.  If you notice in the credits at the beginning of each serial, the evil ""Black Tiger"" is ???.  It's Victor Jory too.
  Also in the cast: Veda Ann Borg, Roger Moore (not the Saintly 007 one), Robert Fiske, J. Paul Jones, Jack Ingram, Charles Hamilton, Edward Peil Sr, Frank La Rue, Philip Ahn, Eddie Fetherston, Kit Guard.
  Total running time: 4 hours, 44 minutes.

7871937,4,630445967X,"""The Shadow"" (1940) bears little relation to the classic radio series. Instead, this 15-chapter Columbia serial wavers between noir atmospherics and delirious physical humor. It makes sense when the director is James W. Horne  the man responsible for some of Laurel and Hardy's best films. Horne stages each chapter like a two-reel comedy, even though Victor Jory keeps a straight face in the title role. Despite its obvious padding and repetition (not to mention several lame cliffhangers), ""The Shadow"" moves at a good clip thanks to Horne's bizarre stylistics.

7871939,4,630445967X,"As a serial afficionado, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this one.  Bela Lugosi plays his role as the mysterious Dr Strang well and Robert Warwick adds a touch of professional stage in his role as the famous detective. Bob Kortman is his usual evil self as the escaped convict Slade. Lafe McKee (I love that name) will keep you guessing about his intentions.  Some of the acting is, as in many serials atrociously overdramatic, but one must remember that the film was made in 1933 in the early years of the talkies. The endings are standard, but the surprise in the last chapter is who the Shadow turns out to be. It is beyond the last person you would suspect.  And the serial contains the most oft-repeated line in serial history: ""This is the last time you have interfered with my plans!""  Hah!  Little does the Shadow know about how resilient our hero is.  The fighting is bad, the action sequences are limited, but the serial is enjoyable.",1015977600,,942,4.610778443113772

I saw this serial as an eleven-year-old (in the 50s, when it was often run on TV over several Saturday mornings).  Victor Jory was the picture of the Shadow and the voice as well.  The voice that made him such a menacing villain made him believable as a hero who could make the hair on a villain's head stand on end.  To the great credit of the actors and director, the serial was not campy or done for laughs a la the later Batman TV show.  We still needed and valued our heroes back then.  In an era when it's tempting to feel that things are out of control, that no one of us can do much to set right all the wrong in the world, it's relaxing and reassuring to return once again to a more idealistic time.  We believed then that, no matter how bad things got, no matter how strong the villains we faced, truth and justice (and real effort) would ultimately triumph.  Isn't that the perfect thing for a break from real evil?",1005264000,6,1094,4.297560975609756
