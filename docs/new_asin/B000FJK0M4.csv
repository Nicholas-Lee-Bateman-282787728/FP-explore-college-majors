In terms of bad movieness, I've hit rock bottom. I've found quite possibly THE worst movie ever made, and the worst movie ever on Amazon.

I stumbled upon the VHS in the horror section of the video store. I saw the cover and it looked pretty cool. It looked like a Tim Burton flick almost. Based on the cover alone is what compelled me to rent it. Then flipping the back, the following description was shown:

""When four people are stranded on an ancient battlefield, one of them is haunted by a voice from the past. As she tries to answer their call for help, a chilling nightmare unfolds...thus begins the 'Night Of Horror'""

They certainly got THAT right. By putting quotation marks around the title, they set the sarcastic demographic opinion for this movie. oh, but that's not all! I looked at the bottom and saw a corny looking ""Rated R"" icon. This is odd, seeing as this movie has no sex, gore, nudity, drug use, or even one profane utterance in it. I even did a search on the MPAA's website and found nothing. So now it's clear: this is a fake, and maybe even illegal, rating that the distributor slapped on to get it to sell.

Anyways, the movie is bad from the start: It begins with an opening crawl saying that this is a depiction of a real event and that its purpose is to entertain you (slight misnaming there), as well as to warn people traveling in the Virginia region. This is disproved by the credits' ""This is a work of fiction"" disclaimer. Yeah well so much for being a depiction of an actual event. There sets look like someone shot it in their backyard. The acting is lame and its obvious they stole a bunch of ragtags off the street. There is no real horror that happens. The image on the front cover doesn't even appear in the movie! The closest resemblance is when a man wears a skull cap near the end. Also, ""Creative"" lighting, alright.

Stay away from this drek as far as possible. Oh, and can someone do their best to convince me that that ""Bar"" at the beginning isn't someone's basement with a counter and stools?",1277942400,3,2068,4.428947368421053
8123600,1,B000FJK0M4,"Hands down, the absolute worst film ever to receive some sort of public distribution...NIGHT OF HORROR is so talentlessly and unprofessionally crafted that it becomes an almost surreal, otherworldly experience. The eventless odyssey of an entirely nondescript group of friends traveling various intersates in a motor-home culminates in the unearthing of a figural ceramic skull, a guy in a Civil War uniform whispering things you can't even decipher, and a lengthy home-movie insert depicting a battle reenactment. There is no bloodshed. There's not a single [...], preky or bodacious, to be seen. There is not a fleeting moment of suspense, terror, or humor of even an unintentional kind.

 So jaw-droppingly horrid, it's actually worth a look...you *WILL* be astounded.",1252281600,4,771,5.470588235294118
