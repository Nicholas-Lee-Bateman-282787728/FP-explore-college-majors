1930466,4,B0000E1WK0,I have taken numerous private sessions with Romana in New York City at Drago's Gym.  These tapes were super.  I felt as though Romana was in my house with me giving me a private session.  They are Terrific and I highly recommend them!,1085443200,3,234,4.395348837209302
1930467,2,B0000E1WK0,"I totally love Pilates and enjoy working out. I have been taking lessons with Pilates equipment because it feels so good. Because of wishful thinking, I bought this video because I'm a little overweight. And because I heard the woman featured teaches traditional Pilates. From my experience, no type of exercise can help you lose weight, because you must be eating a healthy diet---regularly. But, as I said, wishful thinking led me to buy this video.
Well, I was disappointed because this seems to be yet another video that capitalizes upon our desire to loose weight. The Pilates method is great, there is no doubt about it. But this video cannot help you achieve the implied message of weight loss.",1079049600,4,701,4.85
1930468,1,B0000E1WK0,"I am a certified instructor who trained with Romana Kryzanowska during the 1980s and 1990s. I revere Romana like thousands of other hard working and talented instructors. I feel we share a special bond by experiencing the Pilates method through her greatness. There is no other individual in the world (who actually trained with Joseph Pilates) who is as creative as Romana, and who preserves the true method with beautiful musicality and authenticity.
Having said these things, it is seriously discouraging to know Romana is casting the Pilates method as a weight loss approach. It's hard to believe that Romana actually approved this video, and it's suggestion of weight loss through Pilates.",1078358400,6,694,5.205357142857143
1930469,2,B0000E1WK0,"When I heard the famous Romana Kryzanowska was going to make videos I jumped for joy! I live on the West Coast and have been fortunate enough to study with teachers who were students of Romana's.
The strange thing is that I've never heard my instructors talk specifically about weight loss as related to Pilates. One day, however, I asked my teacher about this subject. She told me that tradtional Pilates should never be thought of as a weight loss strategy. That Pilates is a complete cross-training system within itself. And that if you study the classical Pilates method, then your body naturally changes and becomes slimmer as result of good form.
This video is OK, but weight loss doesn't seem to be part of the traditional Pilates technique that I studied. I wonder what Joseph Pilates would think. And I wonder what Romana would think.",1077753600,3,843,4.780821917808219
1930470,2,B0000E1WK0,"As a student of Romana Kryzanowska's for many years, I was surprised that she allowed production of a video titled ""Optimum Weight."" Anyone who knows Romana is aware that she would not attempt to sell Pilates videos using terminology associated with weight control.  When practiced properly, of course, the Pilates method can help people achieve a better balance of strengthening and stretching. To include weight control as a goal within the principles of the Pilates method, however, is something outside the original technique.
Like another viewer, I was also disappointed with the name ""Romana's Pilates"" because this extraordinary method is not Romana's; it is the sole creation of Joseph Pilates. This follows a marketing trend of ""Winsor Pilates"" and ""Polestar Pilates,"" which is unfortunate. I'm sure Romana would completely agree with this.
As for the video itself, I don't think it showed Romana's remarkable talent, wisdom, and humor. The workouts are interrupted by some akward titling, and the number of repititions of each exercise are not shown on screen. The demonstrators are certainly professional, yet I didn't see the joy, the passion, and the thrill that is often part of taking a wonderful lesson with Romana.",1077580800,11,1231,5.280612244897959

8001570,1,B0000E1WK0,"I cant say how disappointed  I was with this video. I bought this because of Romana Kryzanowska, one of the leading pilates experts in the world! My 5 year old could do it! This workout (if you want to go that far to call it that) is for extreme beginners.",1374192000,,256,4.12
8001571,1,B0000E1WK0,"I'm fairly new to Pilates and I had a difficult time keeping up with this exercise program. There provided little instruction on how to perform the motions correctly. Before I had a chance to understand a move, they were going on to the next move. It was hard for me to keep up.

Also there was a 9-minute information segment at the beginning of the DVD that I forwarded past. It appeared to be about Romana's Pilates experience and the history of Pilates. I wasn't interested.

This DVD is probably good for the people who are familiar and skilled at Pilates. I'm not one of those people. I wouldn't recommend this tape for beginners.",1349222400,,635,4.56140350877193
8001572,5,B0000E1WK0,"I never expected Romana to be so warm and approachable. I'd heard of her, and expected she'd be intimidating. She's lovely.
  The instruction is very good. Romana explains some postures, the voice-over I think is very useful - giving additional instruction.
  I feel inspired to use this CD a lot - and actually feel grateful that I get to take a bit of class with a wonderful teacher.",1301443200,,385,4.617647058823529
8001573,5,B0000E1WK0,"This video is part of a series by Romana Kryzanowska a student of Pilates founder Joseph Pilates and in fact the heir to his original teachings.  Now in her 80s, Romana is simply amazing--a guru, a diva, and an inspiration all rolled into one.  This DVD offers documentary footage (including ""History of Pilates"" and ""Romana: Keeper of the Flame and Force of Nature""), and it is incredible to watch both Romana and ""Uncle Joe"" at work.

Of course, this is also an exercise DVD, and to me, the workout did not disappoint.  In the main practice, ""One on One with Romana,"" Romana leads a female student, Petie, through a Pilates mat series.  This is a flowing segment which I would rate at a low intermediate level, with the most challenging exercises being the neck pull and the jack knife (oddly enough, though, the rollover is omitted).  Romana sticks mainly to the classical Pilates sequencing, going from the hundred, roll up, leg circles, and rolling like a ball to the single leg stretch, although she skips the rest of the series of five to move into the spine stretch forward, open leg rocker, corkscrew, saw, swan dive, single and double leg kicks, neck pull, jack knife, an abbreviated side series, teaser series, hip circles, swimming (which she makes a point of saying that she does not like!), the rarely-seen leg pull (face down and face up), kneeling side kicks, mermaid, seal, and final stretch.  Romana is quite humorous in her instruction, and I loved the little tips she provide here and there (although her comments sometimes resulted in an uneven number of reps being performed from one side to the other).  Overall, I thought the workout had a very similar feel to Winsor Advanced Body Slimming; Mari Winsor, one of the many Pilates instructors interviewed for this video, was clearly influenced by Romana.  In addition to Romana's coaching, there is also occasional voiceover commentary providing additional information, and a graphic comes on screen announcing each upcoming exercise (I thought that both of these techniques served to break up the flow of the workout a bit; I would have preferred listening to Romana only).  The entire sequence is about 20 minutes long.

A second workout option is ""Workout with Petie.""  Here, student Petie repeats the above mat series on her own to voiceover instruction only.  The transitions between exercises flow more quickly here, and the workout time is a bit shorter, about 16 minutes total.  Although the reps are even here and it is a well-designed workout overall, I definitely missed Romana's presence, and so I will turn to this version only when I am short on time.  Finally, the DVD offers a few bonus exercise segments, including ""Wall Alignment Warm Up,"" which has three students demonstrating some simple stretches at the wall, and ""Around the Clock with Kathi,"" in which student Kathi performs the double leg stretch while revolving in a circle (ie, the outline of a clock).

I'm not sure that I'd want to collect all the DVDs in this series (this is the only one I've tried so far), but I'm definitely happy to have acquired this one.  Although the workout itself probably only rates 4 stars, working out with Romana is definitely a 5-star experience.",1165795200,6,3229,4.873857404021938
8001574,5,B0000E1WK0,"I have been doing Yoga daily for close to 10 years and have been doing Pilates every day before my Yoga practice for a little over a year. Pilates has made a huge difference both in how my body looks and feels and is a great compliment to a Yoga practice.

I currently have 35 Pilates DVD's and over 100 Yoga programs (between VHS, DVD and CD audio), so I'm a person whose practice is home based (aside from the weight training I do at the gym in addition to home). I just mention that to show my familiarity with using media for my Pilates and Yoga practice.

There is a session led by Romana which is longer and more detailed and then a separate one with Petie (led by a voiceover) which flows more and is only about 16 minutes long (it's the same session but much shorter because of the way it is paced). In the Romana led session (which is a ""live"" session, not a voice over) she points out certain details that helped me further work on my form in the exercises and I also thought her personality was very encouraging. She certainly knows her stuff and yet has a light hearted and joyfulness regarding the Pilates method.

I'll probably use the voiceover session more frequently because of the flow and the shorter length of time and use the Romana one on one session occasionally just to keep my practice in check.

As far as the whole ""weight loss"" thing, that certainly seems to be a marketing deal. Of course a person who is sedantary who does this should have some weight loss just by virtue of not being completely sedantary anymore. Still, I don't find Pilates to be a calorie burning practice as much as it is a strengthening and coordination (neuromuscular) practice.

I would rate this as an early intermediate practice though some of the exercises are treated in a more advanced manner than most of the other intermediate programs I have (such as lifting off in the ""corkscrew"" and her treatment of the ""Teaser"" in which she has you lower and raise the legs).

For me the documentary section w/ footage of Joseph Pilates himself was really interesting. In fact, when I saw that was included when I read the cover of the DVD it was what made me make the final decision to purchase it. I was also intrigued by seeing how Romana led a session as well.

I guess depending on what you are looking for in a Pilates program will determine if you think this program is for you.

I tend to like to mix my Pilates practice w/ more ""classic"" Pilates one day with a more Pilates ""inspired"" practice the next, this seems to work best for me because it keeps things interesting and my body doesn't do the same exact movements day after day.",1162080000,3,2642,4.421810699588478
8001575,4,B0000E1WK0,"I really enjoyed the challenge and fast pace of this video. The work out is only about 20 min but it never fails to make me sweat. It took me a few times to catch on to all the moves (even though I've been doing Pilates for a few years) and to keep up, but now that I know the sequence, I hardly look at the tv.

 Some reviews didn't like all the intro's and history...but if you buy the DVD you just go to menu and go right to the workout each time. I have about 8 Pilates DVD's and this is my favorite one!",1142553600,4,508,3.7830188679245285
8001576,5,B0000E1WK0,"I'm a beginner/intermediate to Pilates and had been going to a local studio in AZ for about 2 months. My instructor just opened her studio so she was green too. At her studio, she teaches mat and Reformer. What I noticed is that when I left class I often hurt for days. Some things about the workouts just didn't seem right to me so I decided to check 'other' Pilates material: books, DVDs, etc. I even read material Joseph himself wrote. What I found was my instructor was one of the many that's churned out from some instructor-over-night certification class---and she didn't know much more than I did. She certified under Stott and I trusted they wouldn't certify them if they don't know what they're doing. Not true! Once I asked, ""how should I be breathing?"" I was told by the instructor...""I really don't think it matters that you breathe as long as you breathe."" WRONG! In Joseph's writings he preached breathing is essential and is always done through the nose, never the mouth. He spent a lot of time going over the dynamics and impact of breathing to get the optimum results from the workout.

After purchasing Romana's DVD, I am certain I'd be headed for life long back pain and injury if I continued to let some just-certified(incorrectly)-instructor teach me poor technique. I feel that Romana's DVDs teach the proper techniques safely and that they help you execute each move to get the intended and maximum results. By doing the moves correctly, you're gaining strength, flexibility and a better body.

I read the reviews where people complain...""oh there's only one workout."" You want variety....don't be cheap---buy another DVD. For my $15, it's the best money I've ever spent and it will take me time to master it. If you went to her studio to learn this very session, you'd be paying a lot more than $15--so what really are you complaining about?--the fact that you can't do the workout? Stick with your $15 DVD; it'll come. Romana has saved me from injury and given me a better workout. After all, Joseph Pilates only created so many moves to be executed in a particular order on the mat. True Pilates is done exactly this way and took he and his pupils, like Romana, years to master. Hell....if you're bored or have outgrown the mat, get a Reformer or advance to another apparatus. This is pure common sense! When you passed the first grade you didn't stay there....you went to 2nd grade.

Oh and by the way, for those who complained about it not being a weightloss program. I was a size 14 two months ago and now wear a size 10. Go figure...my doing the ONE workout helped me lose weight. I concentrate on the moves and apply myself each day I play the DVD. I improve DAILY. I plan to continue use of Romana's DVD, master it and move to the next level.

I think people should have realistic expectations and want to do Pilates for all the right reasons. It's seems that many of the poor reviews that were written came from people who either already worked out with Romana or are practically instructors themselves. Give me a break! The rest of us millions of average everyday people haven't been to Drago's gym or had lessons with Romana. You should consider yourselves blessed. The majority of the population would get GREAT benefit from this DVD, so your viewpoints were found biased and downright unimportant. If you're dedicated to your form and the workouts 3-4 times a week, you CAN change your body and the way you feel about yourself. I am emerging a better me thanks to THIS DVD! I recommended it to anyone desiring better health, strength and above all attitude. I have chosen Pilates and it is a lifestyle change for me. I am so excited about what's to come for me for integrating it into my everyday routine! My only wish is that I could one day meet Romana and share a workout or two under her instruction. She is truly an amazing lady!",1093132800,34,3871,4.605797101449276
8001577,2,B0000E1WK0,"I love Pilates. I do the mat routine everyday. To keep it interesting, I go to different instructors and own about 15 DVDs. I do the different workouts on alternating days. I was excited to see a Romana DVD come out. However, it is clear that they put Weight Lose on the cover to get people to buy it. I bought it to see how the workout would differ from other styles. It doesn't really differ at all. It is really just an intermediate workout, but a good one at that. There is absolutely no mention of weight lose at any time on the DVD. Romana never talks about it and there is no indication, besides the title, that this will help you to lose weight. Clearly a marketing ploy. Not all bad though!! Even though the Romana DVDs only have 13-18 minute workouts, it is nice to be able to experience working with her when you don't live in New York City. I find that this workout and the Powerhouse Mat workout provide quick morning routines before jumping in the shower and heading off to work. If that is what you are looking for, buy this DVD. If you want to lose weight don't be fooled. My overall choice, Anna Caban, all of her DVDs, including the Cardio Pilates, which is a great overall workout.",1091059200,5,1200,4.314159292035399
8001578,1,B0000E1WK0,"I've studied Pilates at Drago's Gym where Romana Kryzanowska has taught for many years. And I've taken some lessons from Romana herself. I never heard anyone talk about Pilates that suggested it has weight loss benefits.
From my understanding, Pilates was not created as a weight loss method. I'm curious why Romana Kryzanowska released a video that promotes Joseph Pilates' legacy as a way to lose weight. Romana is a one-of-a-kind teacher who embraces the brilliance of Joseph Pilates' tradition. Romana is clearly one of the most important communicators of the method.
The Pilates method is awesome because it can transform your body and mind into better health overall. When Pilates is practiced properly in the original ""East Coast"" tradition (Joseph Pilates started his studio in NYC in the 1920s), you actually evolve into a more complete and satisfied human being.
So, this video leaves me disappointed.",1086912000,5,911,5.204081632653061
