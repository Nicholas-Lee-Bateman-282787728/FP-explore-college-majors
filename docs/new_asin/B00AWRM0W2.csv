8558534,5,B00AWRM0W2,"This DVD is part of Cathe's Xtrain series. It's all leg work, using both new and traditional leg exercises. This is more of a metabolic/endurance type leg workout, so you don't need to use heavy weights.

This has quickly become one of my ""go to"" workouts. These are special workouts that I love to do when I'm feeling lethargic or out of sorts. After doing the workout, I feel energized and happy. I am ready to take on the day!

The basic workout is 51:42 minutes. Bonus workouts are:

*Barre - 15:25 minutes
*Rear Delts - 13:35 minutes
*100 Rep Challenge Hip Thrusts - 6:09.

Equipment needed:

*Dumbbells - Cathe uses 5, 8 and 10 pounds
*Stability ball
*Slide & glide discs
*Dixie cups
*Firewalker loop
*Chair.

The workout is broken down into sections of standing leg work, stability ball work and floor work exercises. It's very easy to mix and match the basic sections as well as adding in the Bonus workouts. I especially like doing the basic + barre workout, which clocks in at about 70 minutes.

STANDING LEG WORK

The walking lunges aren't too bad, nor are the forward leaning lunges with the Dixie cups. My legs start to burn with the plie wall squats and by the low pulse lunges, they are screaming. I am talking back to Miss Cathe at this point.

We end with the firewalkers. I use the green band, which is the easiest. It sure doesn't feel easy at this point. I'm half hoping my band will break so I can continue the exercise without the band.

BALL & CHAIR

I will admit it; I hate hamstring rollouts on the stability ball. I hate them because they are hard and my muscles scream. I can't even use the excuse that I think they are unsafe and that's why I hate them. I need them though because they work my hamstrings like nothing else.

I'm glad the rollouts are the beginning exercises so they are over before I know it. We end with doing glute bridges with your foot on a chair. Compared to the ball rollouts, these seem almost easy.

FLOOR

This is another series that sneaks up on you. Or should I say it quickly catches up with you. Those weighted pizza presses get me every time, even when I use teeny weights like 3 pounds, instead of the 5 pound weight that Miss Cathe uses.

BARRE

I have a newfound love of barre work. This section is not as hard as Cathe's LIS Turbo Barre workout, but it's a nice addition to the other leg exercises.

You can certainly make this workout harder by using heavier weights and by going deeper with the body weight exercises. I will mix things up and when I do my next Xtrain rotation, I'll do my one rep max and really hit the weights hard.

I definitely recommend this workout for those looking for a fun and different workout that will leave you feeling energized for the entire day.",1364515200,7,2743,4.398019801980198
