7749248,5,B01F6QR4CO,Even though some bone-headed ninny-muggin spoiled the meat and potatoes I watched it any way and ended up in the emotional ICU for a month.,1480118400,3,139,4.6
7749249,5,B01F6QR4CO,"What can you say? This anime has quickly gained a well founded reputation as one of the best made. More than just a romance, it's a story of two people, one pulling the other up from despair, the other pushing the first to great heights of achievement. Each unknowingly dependant on the other. Each achieving more than they ever could have without the other. It's also a story about the complex relationship among four long-time friends, the dark past of one, and their amazing talents. If you've heard that a lot of the movie is about classical music, don't let that put you off. The classical music is merely the stage on which the passion and drama (personal and professional) unfolds.
The visuals are well done, both animation and background art, and don't distract from the story. Although there is some aliasing on the introductions, I didn't notice anything similar in the main videos. This set comes on two DVD9, double layer, region free disks, so it should be playable on most DVD players. It comes in Japanese only, but has English, Chinese, and Malaysian subtitles. Also, it's shipped from Malaysia, so expect it to take several weeks to be delivered. Mine arrived in an envelope with bubble wrap, completely undamaged.
A bitter-sweet story. Highly recommended. Be sure to bring tissues.",1473206400,9,1299,4.882352941176471
7749250,5,B01F6QR4CO,"I just finished this series, and I'm still not sure why I did that to myself. I've seen a lot of anime, a lot of tv shows, and a lot of movies...none have managed to be more emotional than this (for me) has. This easily makes it to my top 5 favorite list of every category (Both American tv shows/movies and Japanese anime) and I highly suggest watching it. I watched it online and HAD to buy this box set afterwards. This show is nothing short of amazing!",1471651200,,456,4.193181818181818

7749252,5,B01F6QR4CO,"I happen to stumble upon this show on Hulu one day, in the Japanese version, and I was instantly glued to it. People have told me that Romeo and Juliet is the saddest story, and I laugh at them and tell them CLEARLY YOUVE NEVER SEEN YOUR LIE IN APRIL!! Great classical music and you fall in love with the two main characters instantly. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone. Even one of my friends, who's also into anime, thoroughly enjoyed it. Great story and about being brought back to the light when all they have known is darkness",1465603200,6,537,4.38
7749253,5,B01F6QR4CO,"I have always watched shows with real actors. But one day I decided to try watching anime for the first time. Who knew that I would try to watch this show every chance I got, I mean, it was that good. This show is a work if art and its especially good if you are a musician because you have something to relate to. I still would recommend this to anyone, I can't express myself enough .  JUST WATCH IT !!!!",1464998400,4,406,4.012345679012346
7749254,5,B01F6QR4CO,"So much better than I expected.  Very adult themes here.  Not sexual, some violence. Mostly because of the drama involving one of the main characters.  Leaps and bounds better than anything available from American media.  It is an animated adult drama, wonderfully drawn.",1464652800,3,271,5.232558139534884
7749255,5,B01F6QR4CO,"First off I would like to say that this anime is truly amazing and beautiful. Although, I am going to focus on the product itself beings that I noticed not much of these reviews focus enough on that. When I first ordered this I was a little hesitant because I don't know much about third parties and it didn't have many reviews, but I did some research and I looked at the sellers overall reviews and went for it. And I couldn't be happier.
  It took 5 days to come in which isn't bad, but I am a very anxious person so it felt a lot longer. When it came in it had plenty of packaging protection around it, it wasn't the best packaging appearance wise, but it holds up so who cares.
  The product itself seems very durable. The artwork on it is a lot better than what I expected. The artwork is very clear.
  I put in the disc into my PS4 and it works fine and it has Japanese and English AUDIO, I heard people saying it only had japanese audio but it has both (in my case at least). The video quality isn't the clearest and looks a little outdated, but its still visible and nothing to worry about in my opinion.
  I got this product for a couple of reasons. First off the anime is one of my favorite and I was so emotionally invested I had to get it. Secondly for collection purposes. Its waaay cheaper and so much more of a better deal than what aniplex is offering.
  One last thing, to do with the case itself, the case doesnt close. The case is designed like a foldable, so it doesnt close all the way, but I put it on a shelf in between two other movie cases.
  Overall I am pleased TREMENDOUSLY with the product.",1512086400,3,1620,4.140575079872204
7749256,5,B01F6QR4CO,"Read the manga over a year ago. Saw the Anime and had to purchase for my library! This anime follows a young boy who through adversity, sorrow, and loss has his world go from a monochrome life to the richness of color only to be once again challenged through adversity. It's ""slice of life"" and ""school life"" is very realistic and the main characters are well developed. I have this one in my ""Top Ten"" best anime!",1505692800,,414,4.3896103896103895

7749259,5,B01F6QR4CO,"Just finished watching this on Netflix and it was so good I felt compelled to give it 5 stars, and since Netflix only does thumbs up or down, which didn't seem good enough, here you go.

7749262,5,B01F6QR4CO,"Your lie in april is one of the best anime I have watched in a long time. I just loved how music played a part in all their lives. I would, however, understand I you didn't like this series. This is a series that is definitely worth watching if your into classical music, but if classical music isn't your thing this might be a skip.",1490140800,,333,4.138461538461539
7749263,5,B01F6QR4CO,"I kind of expected there to be an English dub option kind of like when I bough another anime previously, but guess not. Good thing I know Japanese and my friend I got this for can read English subtitles quickly.",1490054400,3,211,4.3
7749264,5,B01F6QR4CO,"Since the story is already out of the bag I won't touch on the quality of the anime itself.

The packaging of the anime is poster board and hard plastic. The graphics are nice and decorate the interior and exterior but you will need to be cautious jarring the package once it is open so the disks don't slide out of the end. My experience with hard plastic cases is not the best, once one tab breaks the DVD will never seat in the case properly, so I would recommend replacing case at some point.

The subtitles appear a little grainy around the edges but are clear enough not to be an issue. The translation quality is decent, I say decent because there are just some things that don't translate well from Japanese. There was a little lag on the subtitles but that could have been a codec on my PC.

The only real complaint I have about the disks is the lack of book marks per episode. You will end up doing a lot of fast forwarding after you watch the first episode.

The seller delivered very quickly and the packaging was adequate to prevent any product damage.

Overall, I am extremely happy to have this series in my collection, as so many people have pointed out this is a wonderful anime.",1489622400,2,1196,4.345291479820628

7749266,5,B01F6QR4CO,"WOW!  Beautifully done, excellent music, excellent writing.  Binge watched the last four episodes--had to--and am still in shock, even though one can see the ending coming from the middle of the series.  Awwww!!!!

Bought the English DUB version DVD.  It worked pretty well but had some surface damage which stopped things around Episode 11.  A newer DVD player sailed right through it all.  There was a brief lip-sync problem around Episode 12 or so.",1488240000,3,451,5.013513513513513
7749267,5,B01F6QR4CO,This is one of those diamond in a hay sack situations.,1487980800,,54,4.0
7749268,5,B01F6QR4CO,"First, I just got to point out that I am not one who gives out 5 star ratings lightly, it's a rather rare occurrence for me. However, it is quite rare to come across such beautiful and poignant stories such as this period, let alone in an anime. I found this to be more inspired than anything I have ever seen on American television, so in my mind this truly deserves 5 stars. You really get deep inside the minds of our rather richly rendered main characters. Plus, you get a chance to experience music though the eyes of musicians. In such a way that any artist, regardless the medium should be able to appreciate. For there are certain common truths about motivation and driving passions that seems to transcend to all creative genres. Including how artistic medium can be the creative person's true voice. How sorrow can be just a potent a muse as joy can be. Plus the concept of how what the artist creates can touch the lives of others, not just those we consciously reach out towards, but those that we may not even be aware of. It may even transcend to non-creative people as well, if they are truly open to the experience, and want to better understand such enigmatic people as artists.

As I type this, I have watched this show all the way through five times, and I'm sure I will again in the near future. I have also read through the manga version as well. I must say this 22 episode series captures the 11 volumes of manga very well. Often, when an anime is based off a manga, it is a pale comparison to the written work. Many important details are compressed, changed, or just plain left out. They often stop short of the true ending as well, which does not happen here at all. If anything, actually being able to hear the music, and see the inner monologue all come to life in full color and motion may make this one of the few adaptations that is superior to the original written work. However, I still recommend reading the manga, there are a few tiny details that make a few things clearer, plus there are the footnotes that help explain some of the cultural references. If I were to make one complaint about the anime, it would be leaving out Emi Igawa and Takashi Aiza's reaction to Kousei Arima's performance in the final episode.

Currently, this show is readily available via many streaming services, which is how I have seen it most often. Which is a good thing since the home video versions are so hard to come by. The blu-ray edition is insanely expensive, If I had the money at the moment, I would pay it though, I love this show that much. While this region free Asian DVD edition is reasonably priced, it was never officially made available in the United States. Most of the copies you see here on Amazon marketplace ship from somewhere in Asia. However, if you bide your time, you may manage to score one closer to home as I did. While a good edition, in some ways it may even be better than the streaming version, but not in every way. There is no alternative audio track with dubbed English, which may be an issue for some, but not for me. While the subtitles are obviously a different translation from the streaming version, it is not so different that you would find it bothersome. Since the translation originates overseas it's bound to be more literal and word for word, rather than Americanized. A perfect example is when Miike asks Nagi about Kousei in episode 18. On the Asian DVD, she replies ""Don't you dare drop the honorifics for Arima-sensei!""That can be stated literally since this translation actually preserves many of the Japanese honorific suffixes, not all but most, which I personally approve of. Where in the American streaming version all the suffixes are dropped, so they must use the functionally equivalent phrase ""How dare you say his name so lightly.""

The subtitles are very legible, and not too small, which is a must for me. However, the timing of them could be a bit better in spots. Perhaps the worst detail, is that the on screen text, like signs or even the episode titles, are not always translated. I may not need to read all the banners at the music competitions. I may recognize that is the music room sign, and know who is listed on the winners lists from seeing the streaming version so many times. But for a first time watcher, it would not be the best option. Overall, I am glad to own this edition, and would never part with it. Even if I managed to score the blu-ray edition some day. I want everything tied to this wonderful story.",1485907200,12,4506,4.492682926829269
7749269,5,B01F6QR4CO,"Absolutely loved this anime!
This has to be my 2nd favorite anime to Darker than Black. This anime does a good job of setting up the main character so you know him better and feel for him whenever anything bad or good happens. WITHOUT SPOILING: even though the ending can be seen from a mile away, I thought the anime did a great job of keeping me attached to the story and characters. And of course, the music is great since it's all classical.
I bought this because half of the show on blu-ray is $130! Fair warning: This anime is subbed, so if you prefer your anime dubbed then you can watch this on Netflix.",1485388800,,611,4.275862068965517

7749273,5,B01F6QR4CO,This series has so many different elements to it and has such a rich and uniquely played story not commonly found these days.  It also introduced some great pianists.  I started developing envy wishing I was able to have the level of talent these characters had.  This story also started developing in me a sense to want to start playing the piano.  I have no musical background but shortly afterward I bought a nice keyboard.  What truly amazed me about this series was house they infused the feeling not only in the story but in the music.  Something extremely powerful to me.  Would highly recommend watching this series.  I feel you will not be disappointed.,1481673600,,662,4.695652173913044

8760351,5,B01F6QR4CO,"I can assume whoever is thinking of purchasing this product has already watched and enjoyed Your Lie in April.  Therefore, I haven't written this review for the show itself but rather the DVD box, packaging, etc.  First of all, the discs and box set came sealed and brand new.  Where there are not discs in the flip/fold package, there are cute pictures of the main characters from the show.  Not to mention, there are options in the main menu for English subtitles with English sound and even Japanese sound with English subtitles (for those who enjoy the sound of the Japanese voices better than the English ones).  Have to admit, it's expensive but definitely worth it.",1529539200,,672,4.758620689655173

8760353,1,B01F6QR4CO,"Your Lie in April is easily one of the best stories I've ever had the pleasure to know. This rating is not a reflection of the show in any way. Rather the rating is for this particular product.

This DVD set is produced by authorised distributor ""Glorious Media Sdn. Bdh."" If you're not familiar, they are based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Video quality is atrocious, even by DVD standards, with obvious artifacts throughout the episodes. The blocky, oversized subtitles are for spoken language only, so good luck deciphering the listings of the piano competition winners if you don't read Kanjinot that the subtitles that do exist are anything special, the translation is pretty amateurish.

I watched a single episode and the first few minutes of another hoping these issues would clear themselves up. They did not.

Do yourself a favor if you're a serious collector: Run. Find something better.",1526688000,2,897,5.0
8760354,5,B01F6QR4CO,"Rarely does a TV series do everything right.

This is one of those rarer than rare times every note was perfect, and in its place, and the totality of the series actually made it better than any of the parts.  While music appears to be the story being told, the real inner story is the relationships we form with others, and how we make mistakes, bad assumptions, and blunder our way through things, but still can survive and grow stronger doing that.

Boy and girl one have been friends forever, then boy meets girl two, and girl one finds that the very, very strong friendship with the boy is not enough-- but even though boy B appears to be the partner for girl two, she has to watch boy one grow up over a period of less than a year, and watch girl two boy develop something that is beyond her understanding.

Very cliched, but like the music used, classical work has a life of its own, and this is a great story.",1525305600,,917,4.283236994219653
8760355,5,B01F6QR4CO,"Very cute kids show, excellent inspiration for kids who study piano or violin.  Beautiful classical soundtrack with many famous favorite pieces, plus a lot of Japanese modern music which I just ignored but might appeal more to kids.  It does not have a happy ending, so be sure your kids can handle that.",1522454400,,304,4.716981132075472
8760356,3,B01F6QR4CO,"It's a fantastic show, so that's not what's at fault here.  It's the presentation in the product.
The packaging is fantastic, a great little fold-out case holding both discs with a nice print-out behind the clear disc holders.

But the DVDs are really lacking for video quality.  22 episodes on 2 discs, so there's plenty of video compression going on here.  For such a good looking show, it's somewhat a shame that the compression muddies the look.  With bright pastels and a painterly style look, the visual artifacts are a glaring problem.  It's not unwatchably bad, but certainly detracts for the experience.",1521244800,3,612,4.950980392156863

8760360,5,B01F6QR4CO,"Your Lie In April is one of the best anime I've ever watched. I rarely feel the sort of emotion that I felt while watching this show. It has a great story, bittersweet, but great. The show gives each character a back-story and a purpose for doing what they are doing so you can relate to them and try to understand their struggles. Each musical scene is also very intense and I feel gives a glimpse into an artist's emotion when they are creating said art and expressing themselves in it. All in all the show is amazing, you should definitely watch it! This last part is about my experiences with the seller, BLG World. I ordered and got the shipping notice on January 3rd. Amazon said the estimated arrival date was the 9th-12th. I wasn't expecting to get the show in on January 6th. The case was wrapped in bubble wrap and sandwiched in-between two small pieces of cardboard to make sure that it didn't get any damage done to it in the slightest. I would absolutely recommend buying from BLG World",1515369600,,999,4.46448087431694
