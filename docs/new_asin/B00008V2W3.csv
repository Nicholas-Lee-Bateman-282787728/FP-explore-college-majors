a must have for any fans of the 'girls with guns' genre and moon lee in particular..",1485907200,,210,4.146341463414634

7987049,5,B00008V2W3,"Great old school, last of the 80's movie. Looks like it was dubbed from a VHS but considering the movie is 25 years old It looks good. Jetpacks, shotguns, nunchucks and knives one strings. Oh so much fun.",1445040000,,204,4.394736842105263
7987050,2,B00008V2W3,"I purchased this dvd so as to have a sample of Moon Lee's work and I want my money back. Well, maybe half of it. Moon Lee, who started as a ballerina, took to Kung Fu extremely well and can deliver some of the best Kung Fu action and she does dominate the early going. The climactic scene in the early going comes whe she is discovered coming out of a room where she isn't supposed to be in and a massive battle takes place between her and about a hundred guards and she is superb. (She also does the Bruce Lee thing from 'Chinese Connection' where Lee has a climactic battle requiring extensive agility and flexibility and then suddenly, from out of nowhere, he has nunchakus- like where was he hiding them? Moon Lee has a wild battle and then reaches into her belt and has nunchakus. How do you flex with those things in your belt behind you?) She then escapes- after throwing he nunchakus at her pursuers with no ill effect- and jumps through a window maybe 50 feet off the ground but of course, she's unharmed. This was fine action and I waited for more but then Moon Lee disappeared. The rest of the story focused on the others in her group and I found that I couldn't care less. This is not a Moon Lee film but rather Moon Lee opens the film and then moves out of the way. Buy it so as to enjoy maybe the first 20 minutes of it but then say 'Goodbye' to Miss Moon and sadly at that.",1383350400,,1388,4.163568773234201
7987051,2,B00008V2W3,"I've seen the first two movies in the series and while the martial arts action is pretty good, the gunfights are just ridiculous. They make the A-Team's tongue-in-cheek gun battles look serious by comparison. With movies like this I can't see how asia can complain that American films are too violent.",1368316800,,301,4.921568627450981
7987052,5,B00008V2W3,"FIRST I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE BONUS FEATURES, YOU WILL SEE PREVIEWS OF SOME OF WU TANG'S CLASSIC KUNG FU FILMS. YOU WILL ALSO SEE A REAL MASTER IN ACTION IN SECRETS OF A YOUNG MASTER, HE IS A REAL MARTIAL ARTS MASTER AND HES TALKS ABOUT A NEW STYLE HE CREATED, ITS REALLY AWSOME HE IS LIKE A YOUNG VERSION OF JIM KELLY CHECK IT OUT. LAST BUT NOT LEAST AS A PLUS YOU GET A MUSIC VIDEO BY ONE OF WU TANG'S GREATS AND ALSO MY ALL TIME EAST COAST RAPPER GHOSTFACE KILLAH, IT DOESNT GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT. NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE... I HAVE BEEN READING ALL OF THE REVIEWS AND SOME YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT. ANGEL # 12 GETS CALLED FOR A ANOTHER ASSIGNMENT TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE TERRORIST THATS HAPPINING IN THAILAND. THE PERSON BEHIND THIS EVIL SCHEME HIERD TWO ASSASANS ONE FROM JAPAN AND ONE FROM THE STATES. MOON LEE RUSHES TO CATCH A TRAIN BECAUSE THE JAPANESE ASSASAN IN ON THERE AND MOON LEE WANTS TO GET MORE INFO ON THE CASE. MOON LEE FIGHTS WITH THIS WOMAN FROM JAPAN AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS FIGHT IS REALLY GOOD. MOON LEE WINS THE FIGHT AND KNOCKS HER OUT AND WEAR HER CLOTHES SO WHEN SHE GET OFF THE TRAIN THE PEOPLE THAT WAS SUPPOSE TO MEET WITH THAT JAPANESE WOMAN THINK ITS HER INSTEAD. SO SHE FINALLY ARIVES TO THE PALACE AND THE WOMAN FROM THE STATES THAT HIRED HER THINKS SHE IS THE WOMAN FROM JAPAN SO SHE IS PUT TO THE TEST, SO SHE HAS TO FIGHT SOME OF HER GUARDS TO PROVE SHE IS WHAT SHE CLAIMS TO BE. SHE PASSES THE TEST BECAUSE MOON LEE CAN REALLY FIGHT. FASTS FORWARD TO LATER ON IN THE MOVIE, MOON LEE SNOOPS AROUND THE PALACE TO LOOK FOR CLUES AND SHE OVER HEARS  A PHONE CONVERSATION THAT THE BOSS HAS CAUGHT ONTO HER NOW MOON LEE HAS TO FIGHT HER WAY OUT OF THERE. I WILL END IT HERE BECAUSE THIS REVIEW IS WAY TOO LONG TO WRITE AND WAY TOO LONG TO READ LOL. I WILL ADMIT MY REVIEW WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER IDEAL OF WHATS GOING ON. THE ACTION IN THIS MOVIE IS AWSOME, MY ONLY COMPLAINTS ON THE FILM THAT ITS NOT WIDESCREEN AND A FEW SCRAMBLES IN THE PICTURE BUT VERY WATCHABLE. I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED THAT MOON LEE DID NOT FIGHT IN THE FINALE. HERE IS WHY I WAS DISAPOINTED EARLY ON IN THE FILM AFTER MOON LEE FOUGHT ONE OF THE GAURDS THE EVIL BOSS SAID I HEAR YOU ARE VERY GOOD WITH WEAPONS... I WOULD LIKE TO CHALENGE YOU ONE DAY. NOW THAT WAS THE PERRFECT OPERTUNITY TO LET MOON LEE FIGHT THAT WOMAN IN THE FINALE.. OH WELL IT WAS A GOOD RIDE ANYWAYS YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD LOL. LOVE- PEACE- AND KUNG FU",1318377600,2,2472,3.9738430583501008
7987053,5,B00008V2W3,"The blurb says, inter alia: ""In the third and final installment of the 'Midnite Angels' series, the girls go after crime boss Lo Lieh (fist of White Lotus). Covering his back is the Blonde Fox, ready with both barrels. The showdown is the best thing since Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. Fists, kicks, nunchakus, and shotguns rain heavy and furious"". COMMENT: This is the second movie featuring Moon Lee as the principal actress (The first one is 'Kickboxer's Tears'). When I saw 'Kickboxer's Tears', I fell in love with Moon Lee completely and immediately because she looks so lovely, lovable and like a baby. In fact, I find it very difficult to take Moon Lee seriously as a fighter. This is not to say, however, that I do not find Moon Lee highly entertaining. The fact, I find this small actress highly entertaining. This is the conundrum with this movie. At one stage watching her playing is like watching a baby entertains herself. On the second, this movie does a great service to me by stabilising my depressed moods. I am happy to give this movie 5 star.",1260230400,2,1058,4.632978723404255
7987054,3,B00008V2W3,"i agree with the other reviewer on this film. even though it has its share of good fight scenes (the last fight being a pretty brutal smackdown) it really wasn't as good as the first 2 films. i also own the first movie on dvd and that one has one of my favorite one on one female fight scenes. its a bone crunching fight between moon lee and yukari oshima.  although it was great to see moon lee back in action in the 3rd movie, the fight scenes don't quite have the same visceral impact as the first 2. the picture quality was decent for this dvd but definitely not remastered.  one other thing caught my attention on this movie though... was that panna rittikrai in the thai kickboxing match scene?  he is tony jaa's mentor and personal trainer.  what a cool little bonus huh!",1239580800,,778,4.344827586206897
