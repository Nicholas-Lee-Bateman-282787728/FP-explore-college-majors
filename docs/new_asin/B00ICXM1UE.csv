6257225,5,B00ICXM1UE,"This movie is the hardest movie I have ever had to rate.  By way of background, I am LDS and have two sons who will leave on missions in a short time.  Having that background, this movie was profoundly disturbing to me.  I honestly wondered how to rate it.  The experience these young men went through - absolutely no stars - it was every mother's worst nightmare for her son.  The way the young men handled the situation - countless stars.  The movie features - 4 stars.  I have just finished the movie and I am left stunned at the experience I just watched.  The reason for the five stars is that this movie left me how any good drama based on disturbing events leaves you feeling - like you were part of the story.  I am in no way saying I know what these young men or their families went through, but after watching a strong movie on human suffering, you are left having to ""get over"" the experience.  That is exactly how I feel about this movie.  To me, that is the mark of an excellent drama.  I am profoundly disturbed by what happened, amazed that they survived, and humbled to witness their courage.  As so accurately depicted in the film, it is one thing to say you believe in Christ.  It is totally another to be in a trauma situation and survive with real faith in Christ - no matter the outcome.  This movie does depict LDS missionaries, both age 20.  While it is somewhat LDS specific, I think that it would be moving for any person who has served others - meaning that you don't have to be LDS to relate to the story or subject matter.  I would not recommend this for children under 13.  The true story, as depicted, is very traumatic.  I am adult and I am profoundly saddened by the events.  As a mother, I cannot even begin to imagine what all involved experienced.  May God bless these special missionaries and their families.  I do not know if I could watch this movie twice.  I don't know that I could bear to watch all that these young men experienced again, but I will say my life is better having watched it.  It reminded me of the miracles that happen when people of all faiths come together to petition God for His divine help.  It reminded me that real faith isn't something out of a book or a Sunday School answer - it is true to faith to the end - regardless of the outcome.  These young men and their families will long stand as an example to me of real faith and courage.  It was an honor to be part of their story and have it become a part of me.",1395705600,20,2477,4.226012793176972
6257226,5,B00ICXM1UE,Our whole family loved this amazing and inspirational true story. It is very suspenseful and gripping and so touching. Highly recommended!,1395532800,2,138,5.619047619047619

6257228,5,B00ICXM1UE,I attended the premiere and was blown away with the story and very impressed with the quality of the acting and film making.  Definitely a must have!,1395100800,2,149,4.518518518518518
6257229,5,B00ICXM1UE,"I really liked the film.

It's hard for me to be objective about it, since I was really closely involved with the events as they unfolded in Russia back in 1998 (ie: the guy who received the ransom note came to me with it afterwards). For me, watching the scene where they get kidnapped shook me physically -- it was just so close to home, and so close to the way things actually happened. The strength of this film is that it tells a fascinating true story, and tells it in a very intimate, personal way.

While this film WAS NOT produced by the LDS Church, it is an independent film made by people who ARE members of the LDS church and the religious overtones are obvious. It should be no surprise that a movie about LDS missionaries features dialogue about the church and its teachings -- since that is what missionaries do all day long. When we went to see it in the theatre I worried a bit at first if I should invite friends, since it might be a bit too ""churchy"". In the end, I did invite quite a few people and they all really liked it. I think they were able to look past the politics of religion and just see these as a couple of boys in a tough spot, trying to make the best choices they can in the middle of a bad situation.

The camera work is really shaky at first, to the point of being distracting and almost dizzying (apparently they shot all the outdoor scenes on the fly in Kiev on an informal basis to minimize costs); however, once the action moves indoors the camera settles down and lets you engage with the actors. The four leads do a really good job, although the stateside scenes are a bit hit or miss. All in all, it's a great story and I recommend it. You don't have to agree with the doctrine to admire these boys (and their parents) for their courage.

I think most people who are sympathetic to (or at least, not antagonistic towards) the LDS Church will really like The Saratov Approach, as this is just as much a human-interest story as it is a faith-affirming story. I can assure you that the story is true to the facts, and that is what makes this film so powerful.",1395100800,41,2100,4.2556390977443606
6257230,5,B00ICXM1UE,"This is a fascinating true story about 2 Mormon Missionaries who are serving in Russia and are taken captive and held for ransom.
It shows the difficult decision faced by leaders of the Church and parents as they have to consider the implications of either paying the ransom and opening the flood gates for other kidnappings, or paying the ultimate price if they don't.
It is well written and the acting and camera work are good. Even for those not of the Mormon faith this is an incredible story.",1394668800,18,497,4.595505617977528
6257231,5,B00ICXM1UE,"I'm used to Mormon-produced movies being sappy.  I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.  This isn't sappy.  This is professionally made.  It's professionally acted.  It's a movie about two missionaries being kidnapped.  It doesn't matter to the audience, or shouldn't, what religion the missionaries are.  Missionaries are kidnapped.  Missionaries interact with their kidnappers, with each other, and with their God as they progress toward the incident's eventual conclusion.  The missionaries could have been Baptist or Catholic.  The film has universal appeal.  Potential viewers shouldn't be put off that the missionaries happen to be Mormon.  It's an excellent film.  Period.",1393804800,81,677,5.65
6257232,5,B00ICXM1UE,"Sometimes I cry in movies, but rarely do I cry beyond the first time I see it. That is not true for The Saratov Approach, which is the most moving movie I have ever seen (I sobbed all three times I saw it in the theater). Everyone--LDS or not, and even if you don't have a faith--should invest the time in seeing this beautifully made film. It inspires faith by showing the miracles it brings and shows the profound goodness of people.

Why is it so powerful? Because it's a true story about two Latter-day Saint (Mormon) missionaries who were abducted and held for ransom. Their trust in God and the faith their families and friends--and thousands more--exercised is astoundingly inspiring. It is truly moving.

I promise you won't regret seeing it. Do your heart a favor and make the investment in something uniquely worthwhile.",1393632000,35,830,4.7172413793103445
6257233,5,B00ICXM1UE,"When you see this movie, you think, wow what a great made up story.  Nope! It is all true, I have actually meet the two former missionaries and heard their story.  The movie is not based on events, but they were actual events.  I do not know what was going on the parents side, since the two men only spoke of what they were feeling and experiencing, but I know the filmmakers said they wanted the movie to portray the actual story of what happen and not rely on made up version.  With this story of intensity, action, thriller, spirituality, faith and accepting Gods plan, there was nothing to make up, this the actual story had it all.  It is an amazing story and shows the power to faith, prayer, and excepting what God wants of you, no matter what happens, His hands are in your life and will do what He knows is best for you.  God has a plan for all of us, no matter what religion, what color or creed.  He loves us and bad things happen, but He never leaves you.  This movie is wonderful and spiritually uplifting.",1393632000,21,1020,4.276041666666667

I have a daughter who just left on a mission to Hungary, so I wasn't so sure I should watch it - especially given how nervous I was about her going there. After watching this movie, I no longer fear for her safety at all. It was truly inspiring! Very well written, well acted, and well shot. I was surprised really. I expected a B-list movie and got a A-list premier. (So, this is what happens when the gospel meets Hollywood?) It's a beautiful thing and would be a great missionary tool as it is faith inspiring, but doesn't slam any one religion down your throat. It just makes you think about who we are, a person's personal convictions, and what we would or would not do to hold true to those convictions. The best part is, indirectly the movie gave me a snapshot of how Heavenly Mother must have felt when her son Jesus Christ was sent to die for our sins. God retreated to the corner of the universe, but what about her? How was she feeling? What thoughts might have gone through her head? A portrayal of one of the mothers of these missionaries answered that question for me.",1412553600,3,1128,4.350710900473934

6257405,5,B00ICXM1UE,"Great movie. You don't have to be Mormon or even religious to get drawn into and impacted by this movie. it has a lot of great elements that drive the movie the the tension of a hostage negotiation a lot of faith and a little bit of humor.

When the movie premiered I went to a showing in Arizona that after the movie had one of the Elders in the film Travis Robert Tuttle had  Q&A after the movie. He said that a filmmaker approached him and initially he was hesitant because most ""Mormon Movies"" cheesy and low quality. Tuttle spoke with the Director and the director said that he didn't just want to make a movie that appealed to Mormons he felt that the story was universal. A little while later he decided to tell his story to the filmmaker.

When they started to make the movie Elder Propst and Tuttle really hadn't spoken in 10 years. He explained that they both had lives and families and other priorities. Also he said ""It was before facebook"" Elder Tuttle  said.  They sat down and for hours recorded on audiotape what happened.

Elder Tuttle said that most of movie was true to life, but there were a few dramatic license that they took. The first one that he brought up was that he was a Utah Jazz fan which isn't true he was a Phoenix Suns fan. While they did talk about basketball while they were there I got the feeling that saying he was a Jazz fan kind of bothered him but he understood the need to tell the story. Another thing he said was the entire time they were held hostage they were blindfolded they couldn't see each other and only when they were released were the blindfolds removed.  If you can't see a persons face it's really hard to act and tell the story so they changed it. In the movie the younger Russian was the nice one and the older one was the mean one. In real life the younger one was a lot meaner and a lot more evil than he was portrayed in the movie. He was asked do you ever wondered about what happened to your captors? His reply was something with a little more tact but it was something to the effect of I really don't know what happened to them and I really don't care. After he was released Elder Tuttle was given the opportunity to return home but he decided to stay on his mission and he was transferred to England. It was kind of a secret on where he was transferred to. Elder Tuttle was really bothered that he had to leave Russia. He had spent a year learning the Russian language and now he wasn't able to use it.",1410566400,6,2468,4.238297872340426

6257442,1,B00ICXM1UE,"ok. Spiritually and Biblically the movie was somehow inspirational. I have no doubt that these men gone through though a lot while they were held captive. The truth is, throughout the movie we are talking about forgiveness and the redemption of the cross, but yet at in the movie these two so highly spiritual men did not forgive the perpetrators? So why do they preach about forgiveness and yet the perpetrators spend some quality time in prison. They forgot to put the verse from the Bible when Peter cut the soldier's ear in the garden of Ghetsemane yet Jesus put it right back and healed the soldier? What if their captivity would have save these two poor men and they be saved as it has been preached throughout the movie. The movie had a message...the captors were two hurt people very deep in their spritual and daily life. One lost a great friend while the other meant good to start with by trying to provide for his family but ended up kidnapping two strangers. yet the so ""religious missionaries"" forgot that being a part of God's plan includes forgiveness!!!!
I am a Christian and to look at the end of the movie and not see that the two captors were saved, it really asks the question,,,,wasn't God's plan for the two kidnappers to be saved, rather then them ending in prison? They would probably look at the missionaries and say ""how come we got no forgiveness from the two when they were in fact only preaching just that!"".
On the other hand, poor acting from the two captives. The captors played better and they tragically send a message out that they were truly in need of redemption...their souls were the one that need be saved, yet no message of that is seen in movie.
The message of God's love is seen more in the captors releasing the captives and then seeing some forgiveness from the missionaries.
i cant stress it enough how dissapointing the movie is when there is preaching about forgiveness and yet the missinaries are failing to do that in return.",1407456000,,1975,4.597733711048159

6257471,5,B00ICXM1UE,"Words defy me but I shall try. Well, Ive come to the conclusion that this splendid independent film comforted this future mother of Mormon missionaries. Yes, you read that correctly, it comforted me. Why on earth did this story of a horrific kidnapping comfort me? It did so because it reinforced my faith in the promised blessings of serving God. The outcome may not always be what we want it to be but in the long run there will be an enriching gift from God for the service. In other words, Im under no illusion that missionaries will always be safe, thats why Church members pray for them often. Rather, I was reminded that there is a strengthening power in the testing of faith, both for the missionaries and for those love ones they temporarily leave behind. Hence, this film showed me that trusting God leads to growth.

This heart pounding film was based on a true story about a couple of Mormon missionaries that were kidnapped and held for ransom in Russia in 1998. I had some anxiety about watching this movie since I have high hopes that my children will serve a mission for the LDS Church one day. I worried at the level of danger the film would show and concerned how that would affect me as a mother of potential missionaries. Knowing the good outcome did ease the concern but I still braced myself for the account that would befall the young men and curious how they would come out of the frightening experience.

Wow! I was drawn in from the get go. The initial scene was of the missionaries visualizing an escape plan that involved violence, something hard to imagine a missionary would do but to me suggested the desperation of the situation. Then the movie takes you back to the days leading up to the abduction. At this point, beautiful scenes of the missionaries doing typical service was being portrayed. Then the anticipated terrifying abduction scene fell on screen. Oh my heart. The moment I feared that my children (any child for that matter!) would not go through was up front and center. The dark lighting helped to soften the image of the beating that was happening but the intensity was felt by this alarmed mother. Here we go! The film then continues with the account of the experiences that the missionaries went through leading back to the first scene. We got a good taste of the thought process of their families, community, and the world as well. My particular favorite scene was the empathetic call from the adult character, Mark Larsen, who was kidnapped while he served in Argentina. His words were consoling. At this point I was able to exhale because it foreshadowed a resolution. Later, we come to find a great peace to the tone of the movie. A spiritual enlightening that wrapped up the intense drama.

By the way, the musical score was amazing and fitting. The acting was great, particularly the captors. But, I found Tuttles character a bit overdramatic a few times. Finally, the camera presentation was fantastic even with some shaking. It got you up close and personal and therefore invested in the movie.

Brilliant film! I highly recommend.

6257481,4,B00ICXM1UE,"I vacillate between 3 and 4 stars. I suspect that If I watched it again I'd pick 3 stars. But seeing it once and letting it work on me, 4 stars.

There are a few awkward moments, mostly when the film focuses on the families of the kidnapped missionaries. And some of the religious content ever so slightly crosses into the ""preaching"" arena, but not pushed in your face.

The dialogue, cinematography, acting, characterizations, accurate story/plot (by all accounts), authentic shooting locations, are all first rate. The musical score is mostly seamlessly woven in, adding rather than detracting from the visuals.  It is the best ""Mormon"" film I have seen.

The redemption moment, where the missionaries stop trying to interfere with ""God's plan"" and simply allow their fate to happen, I found to be moving and powerful. The implied future redemption of Sergei (a first-rate bad guy) is wordlessly written on his face as he has a metaphysical experience that he cannot explain or deny. Humanity, brotherhood, and something Infinite, ambush and amaze him and he cannot pull the trigger. That was my favorite moment.",1401840000,3,1115,5.010810810810811

6257539,5,B00ICXM1UE,"This is one of those movies that I knew the ending before I started watching it, but that didn't make it any less suspenseful. It was interesting to watch the gamut of emotions the missionaries went through--shock, fear, anger, survival, compassion and peace.

Two missionaries, Elder Tuttle and Elder Propst, go to a teaching appointment and are attacked and beaten, then tied up and moved to a remote location. We get to see what's happening with their families during this time as well, which was quite emotional. This is every parent's worst nightmare, no matter how old your children are. The missionaries and families know the ransom can't be paid because then kidnappings would become commonplace. The missionaries quickly figure out what they need to do in order to stay alive.

There are lots of touching moments in this movie, and I cried a few times. Faced with death, the missionaries go from thinking about themselves to praying for the hearts of their kidnappers to be softened. The nation comes together in prayer, regardless of religion, for the safe return of the two missionaries. There is an outpouring of love shown to the families of the missionaries.

This is an inspirational movie and there is some humor in it as well. I enjoyed this movie a lot and will definitely watch it again and again. I recommend The Saratov Approach to everyone!

But I soon found it impossible to hit the stop button. What a riveting, powerful story! And brilliant acting from all four main characters. I give this one top marks for faith-promoting suspense. Its a movie I will never forget.",1396051200,,396,4.925373134328358

When I saw that ""The Saratov Approach"" was available for review.  I jumped on it.  Could it be that I am experiencing a little bit of motherhood rebelliousness?  It is possible.

I am glad that I watched this DVD.  It is well done and illustrates the power of faith and prayer.  Elder Tuttle and Propst were put in a difficult and dangerous situation.  They could have given up at anytime, but they didn't.  They continued to listen to the spirit and with faith helped each other through the ordeal.  I loved watching how they related to each other and showed compassion for their captor.

This DVD didn't make me worry about my son any more or less.  It did increase my faith that my son is watched over.  It strengthened my spirit. I  intend to show how rebellious I am by watching it again.

I received a complimentary copy of the DVD in exchange for an honest opinion.",1396051200,,1061,4.282828282828283

I'm going to be really upfront here and tell you that I debated for a while about viewing this movie. I knew it was going to be an emotional one. That it would probably upset me, at least a little. I didn't know if I wanted to deal with those emotions. I actually knew one of the missionaries (well was acquainted with him from church, but more of knew his sister for a brief period of time) the movie is based off of. I remember vaguely about this happening, but it was a long time ago and people move away and grow up. I didn't remember most of the story. I just remembered that it had happened, but I wanted to know more about that and what he and his companion learned.

Let me just say that even if you're not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that I would recommend watching The Saratov Approach. I have watched other movies based off of true stories of those in different religions and cultures and I believe that there are things that are universal. Things we can all learn from each other and that can inspire us regardless if we agree one hundred percent about everything or not.

This story was so sad. These two young men who are out on religious missions and trying to just serve and bless the lives of those they come in contact with are taken and held for ransom. I knew that their ransom wouldn't be met. The United States never does, nor do churches, ever pay ransoms. The effect of doing something like that would be too damaging. To watch as these men struggled with their fear and their faith, while their families did the same, was very heartbreaking. I definitely teared up a few times. I am a mother who will eventually send my boys and maybe my girls out on missions. It is scary for anyone to let their children go like that for any reason and trust that they'll be alright. This is pretty much a parents worst nightmare to have happen.

I thought that the movie was done really well. The acting was decent and I was definitely engaged in the story. They showed enough and balanced all the different aspects of what was going on so that the viewer could connect and understand without being overburdened. I have a deep respect for these two men. I'm sure their experience has been a huge influence in their lives.

It was definitely worth watching and I am planning on recommending it to my family and friends. I hope this story continues to inspire others to have faith.

I did not know this story till I heard a little about it when in theaters last year. I waited to see it when my daughter was home. Watching it with my daughter was special. I recommend seeing it with tissues close by.

This is a moving story about two LDS Missionaries serving in Russia who were kidnapped and held for ransom.

The missionaries were targeted because they are from the US. They belong to a big church. I can understand why you can not pay kidnappers because more missionaries or other church leaders would than be kidnapped. I can also understand how tempting for the families to pay it.

I want to make comments about different scenes in the movie but I would be giving away too much of the story.

The faith in God the missionaries and their family showed was touching and uplifting.
How people of faith all come together to pray for them brought tears to my eyes.

This is a movie that I would watch again and again if I can get the DVD back from my girls.

My daughter and a bunch of her friends from her singles ward watched it and enjoyed it too. Yes tissues were used again.",1395705600,2,1106,4.288461538461538

8640905,4,B00ICXM1UE,"LDS film often gets a bad rap for being hokey, cheesy, cheaply made, overly preachy, or some combination of all of the above.  However, some films truly stand out among them, and manage to be good films in their own right... and even films that people not affiliated with the LDS church can appreciate.  ""The Best Two Years"" and ""Mobsters and Mormons"" were the best examples of such films for me... but ""The Saratov Approach,"" a film based on the real-life experiences of two Mormon Missionaries serving in Russia, could probably top them.  It's a well-made film that manages to be both inspiring and an excellent thriller, with well-done cinematography to boot.

""The Saratov Approach"" follows two young American men serving two-year proselyting missions for the LDS church in Russia in the late '90s.  Their plans to teach a young man about the church go horribly awry when the appointment they've set up turns out to be a trap -- the two men are beaten, abducted, and held for ransom in a grungy apartment.  Chained to a bed and terrified for their lives, the two missionaries argue with one another, struggle to befriend their captors, and plot how to escape.  In the meantime, their terrified families back home struggle to cope with the news, the media firestorm that follows it, and a government that's frustratingly slow to respond to the crisis.  But both the missionaries and their families cling to their faith even during their captivity, and rescue from their situation comes from the most unlikely source of all...

""The Saratov Approach"" is an independent movie, but didn't feel cheaply made to me.  While there's some ""location doubling"" going on (Ukraine stands in for Russia, while a lot of the indoor scenes are filmed in Utah), it wasn't noticable to me as a viewer.  The camera work and editing are well-done, and the acting, while it has some questionable moments, is fairly strong as well.  Often religious films are quick to descend into either camp or melodrama, but ""Saratov"" handles itself remarkably well, allowing some much-needed moments of humor but knowing when to remain serious as well.  And while some liberties are taken with the original story (in real life the missionaries were kept blindfolded for most of their captivity, but that's left out for ease of filming), these aren't bothersome and don't interfere with the story.

Also, the film resists the impulse to be overly preachy.  It's obvious that these young men's faith helped them through a horrific experience, but the film is more concerned with telling their story than preaching to the audience.  This helps make it relatable to many viewers, not just to the LDS audience.  It helps that the young men act realistically given the circumstances -- they ARE two men barely out of their teens in a terrible situation thousands of miles from home, of course they're going to be scared -- and that their captors are not painted as sheer sadistic villains but have their own motivations for their actions and even their sympathetic moments.

Probably one of the best LDS films out there, ""The Saratov Approach"" is a good indie film, and one that people of all walks of life can enjoy, not just the LDS audience.  Recommended.",1512777600,,3220,4.875229357798165
8640906,5,B00ICXM1UE,"I was visiting my grandma in Salt Lake a while back and decided to use some of the time to get caught up on my Latter-Day Saint (LDS) cinema. I watched ""The Cokeville Miracle"" one night, and this movie the next night. It's an interesting contrast.

""The Saratov Approach"" is one of the best-done movies in the genre. Part of this is in avoiding the usual clichs of LDS cinema: the stock characters, forced spiritual lessons, etc. that are too common. Instead, the movie gives a realistic portrayal of the events. It follows the age-old rule of ""show, don't tell"": communicating a nuanced and ultimately inspiring message, but without trying too hard to force it down. It can be enjoyed by a wide audience, not just Latter-Day Saints.

The other part is the strength of the characters and the well-charted spiritual trajectory they pass through. From the beginning, we're introduced to the two missionaries: one is confident and decisive, the other is timid. Naturally, we as the audience gravitate towards the first and root for him, at the expensive of the other missionary. This is the set-up, pulled off subtly enough that we barely give it second thought. Yet, without giving away too much of the movie, let's just say that we gradually come to realize that things are not as simple as they seem. Both missionaries are important. The result is a thoughtful, organic exploration of themes like suffering and how to respond to adversity.

The only downside is that... not really that much happens in the movie. The subtitle ""abducted, ransomed, delivered"" already summarizes the whole story---the bulk of the movie is a more intangible spiritual journey. So they do have to really work to stretch out their material to fill out the movie. That being said, I appreciate the intention they were going for: to make a thoughtful, realistic, modern entry in the body of LDS cinema. For that I'll give it five stars.",1506816000,,1912,4.840978593272172
