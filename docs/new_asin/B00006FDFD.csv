7967791,5,B00006FDFD,This was the Monday night movie on tv when I was like 11. it does have the feel of a sexploitation 70s grind house movie. I love it I just watched it again as a 43 year old adult . As a kid it scared me so bad I said I'll never hitchhike ever. I guess it made its point.,1427760000,,270,3.5166666666666666
7967792,4,B00006FDFD,"I have wanted to see this movie for years and just watched it .  The 1979 made for TV movie Diary of a teenage Hitchhiker is the story of teenage girls who are friends and all hitchhike in the small town where they live near the beach.  The main characters are Julie played by Charlene Tilton, who is best known for her role as Lucy in the original Dallas.  Julie's friends Dana and Cathy who is played by Dominique Dunne.  Julie has just graduated from High School and wants a car.  Her father wants her to pay for part of it so Julie gets a job at a restaurant on the beach.  The problem is it is 8 miles away.  So to get there Julie must hitchhike.  This town seems to have a rule that you must be young attractive and female to hitch, because the only people shown doing it in this film are teenage girls who look like they could be models.  Maybe this was to get teenage boys to watch.  First Julie gets a scary ride by a man trying to teach her how dangerous hitching can be.  Then Cathy gets into a car with a man who has a box full of sunglasses and makes her where them.  Then the man rapes and beats Cathy.  When the girls go to see  Cathy in the hospital their reaction is very strange.  Julie is the only one sympathizing the other 2 girls blame Cathy for making dumb choices.  So do these girls learn a lesson by what happened to their friend? No they hitch right after seeing Cathy in the hospital.  Cathy says that she also was pregnant and had a miscarriage after the attack.  Dana winds up in the car of the man who attacked Cathy.  Later Julie gets in trouble when she gets in the car of a man who raped and killed 4 other girls.  There are a lot of famous faces in this movie including Dick Van Patton and Craig T. Nelson who would later star with Dominique Dunne in Polterqeist before her death when she was killed by her boyfriend.",1418860800,,1852,4.1344537815126055
7967793,5,B00006FDFD,"I purchased this at the request of a resident of the NH I'm employed at. He knew exactly where I would find it and what it would cost. Each day he came to my office to check on it's arrival. When I saw him today, having given it to him a few weeks back, he was ecstatic! It brought him back in time, to a better place in his life. It was awesome!",1315353600,,346,3.7534246575342465
7967794,5,B00006FDFD,"I remember seeing this movie when it premiered as the movie of the week back in 1979.  Charlene Tilton of ""Dallas"" fame plays a teen that has a job down at the beach.  She is saving for a car, but in order to get to the job she must hitchhike.  This movie wasn't very violent, but it had some strong images.  The image that sticks out the most is the bikini/haltar top clad girls getting into the murderers car laughing, and oblivious to the news reports, then the next scene is the girls clothing being slowly driven over after the murderer has killed his victims.  A pretty strong message, without being graphic.  There are a lot of recognizable faces in this classic too, like Dick Van Patten from ""Eight is Enough"", and Christopher Knight from ""Brady Bunch"" fame.  Dominique Dunne also stars in this unforgettable made-for-tv classic!  If you like movies from the '70s, especially made-for-tv movies, then this one is a great choice!",1032134400,9,937,4.670731707317073
