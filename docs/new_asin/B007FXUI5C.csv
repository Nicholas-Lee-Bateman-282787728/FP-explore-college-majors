5083993,5,B007FXUI5C,I have been section hiking the AT since 2009. I've seen a lot of films about the trail and this one captures the essence of the trail for sure! Scott really has a great sense of humor. Lots of laughs. All I can say is WOW when is your next film? Loved it!,1359504000,,255,3.830188679245283
5083994,5,B007FXUI5C,"I really liked this documentary because it was loaded with interviews of hikers, and lots of wildlife. I highly recommend watching it.",1353024000,2,134,5.136363636363637
5083995,5,B007FXUI5C,"I've seen a lot of documentaries about the AT. They tend to talk about the history, the statistics, and general regional attractions of the trail. While this is all important awesome stuff it is rare to find a film that captures the essence of the most important part of the trail; the people! This film is inspirational to those who hope to hike it and nostalgic for those who have. A must see for anyone who has an interest in the Appalachian trail!",1331769600,2,451,4.445783132530121
5083996,5,B007FXUI5C,"Scott has made some great long distance hiking movies, but this one is special. By the way he designed his hike; to flip flop back and forth along the trail in order to intercept as many hikers over and over again, he gets into the characters and the essence of hiking the AT better than any other film on it that I've seen. He captures the camaraderie of sharing a shelter in a storm with a bugle player, he captures a lot of the beauty; flowers, trees, salamanders and other wildlife. He captures Trail Days and shows the passions of the people on the trail.  This one is special.  Get it and enjoy!

5083997,5,B007FXUI5C,"What you come to realize while hiking long trails is that it is more about the people you meet and the journey itself than the destination.
The people make the trail what it is whether they are: fellow hikers, trail angels, townsfolk or complete strangers.
Squatch has succesfully captured the personalities and sometimes eccentric ways of the people that make the AT so special.
Whether you are a hiker yourself or just interested in what the Appalachian Trail is all about, this movie will surprise and delight you.
Having hiked the trail myself i can say it accurately depicts the unexpected elements of trail life, and captures the sublime moments as well as the hilarious ones.
You know those moments when something great happens and you wish you could go back and experience it once again? Well Squatch has caught some of those magic times here for us to see.
Watching Flip Flop Flippin' makes me wish to be back on the AT again, sweating and panting up the hills, sharing a laugh at a shelter, and catching a glimpse of Appalachia through the trees once again.
Trust me, get this film, it will make you happy!",1330646400,2,1116,4.67005076142132
5083998,5,B007FXUI5C,"Every day most of us make flippant purchases that do nothing more than to drain our bank accounts.  Occasionally however you make a purchase that makes you glad you spent 2.78 hours working to acquire it.  This is one of those purchases.  Flip Flop Flippin captures the zeitgeist of the trail and the characters and lives of those who inhabit it in a way that can only be accomplished by one who has walked the walk.

If you've ever considered hiking or even looked at a trail leading off into the woods and wondered where it went, or felt the yearn to keep walking a little further to see where you might end up, do yourself a favor and buy this film.",1330646400,2,652,4.319672131147541
5083999,5,B007FXUI5C,"If you've ever wondered what it would be like to hike the 2,180-mile Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine or ever wondered why a person would endeavor to do such a thing, Flip Flop Flippin' is for you!  Scott Herriott's documentary captures the essence of an AT thru-hike like no other film about . . . an AT thru-hike.  Do yourself a favor and add Flip Flop Flippin' to your DVD library.",1330646400,3,391,4.416666666666667
5084000,5,B007FXUI5C,"What would compel a person to leave modern conveniences and real bathrooms behind to set out on a trek of 2000+ miles and walk for months, no matter the weather, through glorious but often rugged terrain, to the point of sheer exhaustion while risking possible injury and failing miserably to keep up with world news, or the Kardashian's?

Now I know.

In ""Flip, Flop, Flippin',"" Herriott overlays gorgeous views of the mighty Appalachian Trail and its inherent challenges with funny, personal cameos of the varied characters that bump into one another along it. What you can count on from any film on the AT would be a look at the splendor of nature, but Herriott gives us something less obvious -- an irresistible, sometimes-goofy, always-inspiring look at how the trail effects the interesting people that walk it and the community that develops within and because of it. It's a beautiful thing! Without overlooking the injuries, the hazards, the overgrown trail beards, the ripe smells (even a disgusting spider that can eat a fish), ""Flip, Flop, Flippin'"" is a thoroughly entertaining and surprisingly moving film. I was charmed and absorbed. Minutes into it, I was admiring the people in the film who had walked this trail, and envious of the unique happiness that dedication and experience had brought them.

As one hiker in the film put it, ""Go now."" Well, I'm thinking about it.",1330646400,3,1387,4.944206008583691
5084001,5,B007FXUI5C,"This is a great documentary about the culture, the characters and the experience of thru-hiking the long distance of the Appalachian Trail.  The Appalachian Trail is approximately 2180 miles long and takes months of hiking to complete it.  This documentary definitely captures the fun vibe and determined energy of those that attempt the journey and those that serve in supporting both the trail's existence and the logistics of the hikers.
I highly recommend to anybody contemplating the hike or anybody who wants to vicariously experience such an adventure. You'll be entertained and inspired.",1330560000,5,595,5.387096774193548
5084002,1,B007FXUI5C,"No concrete information about the trail, very few trail shots, made me rethink hiking it. Very random story telling but I see now why he entitled it flip flop flipping.",1467590400,,168,4.633333333333334
5084003,1,B007FXUI5C,A video of a bunch drunk misfits.  Little or no content that relates to hiking. Garbage from a once good videographer.,1467331200,,118,4.619047619047619
5084004,4,B007FXUI5C,This was a great film. It's all about the fun.,1465689600,,46,3.7
5084005,4,B007FXUI5C,"These videos are entertaining. He has done a few series on trails. I watched some of the PCT and AT series. They provide an interesting look inside the trail life for sure. If you like to hike, especially backcountry stuff, you will enjoy these videos.",1465430400,,252,4.622222222222222
5084006,4,B007FXUI5C,Great look at life on the AT.,1465257600,,29,3.2857142857142856
5084007,5,B007FXUI5C,loved it,1465171200,,8,3.5
5084008,5,B007FXUI5C,Loved meeting all the characters on the trail,1464998400,,45,4.75
5084009,4,B007FXUI5C,I loved this. I recently visited Damascus the day after trail days was over.  I hiked a few miles on the AT and meet a few thru hikers.  It was like going to a family reunion.  This film gives you a glimpse of the awesomeness that IS the AT.,1464134400,,241,3.877551020408163
5084010,4,B007FXUI5C,Fairly interesting.  Skips some major portions of the trail.  Much more of a focus on the hikers than on hiking or the trial itself.,1463616000,,132,4.458333333333333
5084011,5,B007FXUI5C,"Love 'em! All three of them to be exact. So much, I bought them all. Scott Herriot does an excellent job capturing the people, sights and struggles you'll find walking the AT. Informative & quite funny at times.",1463011200,,211,4.578947368421052
5084012,5,B007FXUI5C,Great Film,1462406400,,10,4.5
5084013,4,B007FXUI5C,"Great video for watching people on the trail and their personalities, which was the purpose of it.  I was hoping to see more of the trail as my brother-in-laws is now hiking the AT.",1461715200,,181,4.323529411764706
5084014,5,B007FXUI5C,"I'm starting the planning now of my dream to do the AT in a few years. I'm reading and watching everything I can about it and this video really grabbed my attention. It helped to really see how the trail works, the characters you meet, about the trail angels. Definitely recommend!",1460419200,,281,4.529411764705882
5084015,5,B007FXUI5C,"Rent it, you won't regret it!  I love all of his films, and this one is no exception!",1459900800,,85,3.7222222222222223
5084016,5,B007FXUI5C,"My son left to hike the AT and I wanted to know more about what he was going to experience so I rented this documentary and it was really fun to watch! For anyone curious about the Appalachian Trail and the hikers themselves, this is a great film.",1459814400,,247,4.166666666666667
5084017,3,B007FXUI5C,"Not bad, but it does go to show how much more crowded the App Trail is now than back in its hayday when I hiked it in the '70s and '80s.",1459209600,,136,3.4193548387096775
5084018,4,B007FXUI5C,"I enjoy these in the series... they do jump around quite a bit, but still good stuff.",1458518400,,85,4.0588235294117645
5084019,1,B007FXUI5C,The movie did not hold my interest. It just seems very random and with out any semblance of a story.,1458259200,,100,4.05
5084020,5,B007FXUI5C,Nicely done and a fun story to watch.,1456963200,,37,3.75
5084021,2,B007FXUI5C,"I'm not sure what this video was supposed to be about, I lost interest after about 5 minutes. I made it to the 25 minute mark and couldn't watch any more. I was on the trail in 2011 and thought I'd see a few people I met on the trail, and I did. Other than that I don't think it's really worth the time.",1456876800,,303,3.75
5084022,3,B007FXUI5C,Ok,1455840000,,2,2.0
5084023,4,B007FXUI5C,entertaining and the producer's personality comes through with a light hearted assessment of life on the trail.  Camera work could be a lot better.,1449360000,,147,5.125
5084024,4,B007FXUI5C,"Great movie. Better than I expected, and FUNNY!!",1447459200,,48,5.125
5084025,4,B007FXUI5C,I've never attempted the AT but watching this gives me the bug. The journey with the people you take it with makes the trip!!!,1444608000,,126,4.291666666666667
5084026,3,B007FXUI5C,Showed too many large group sights.  Would have been better with more small quiet camp sights.,1444176000,,94,4.875
5084027,5,B007FXUI5C,I really enjoyed this movie.  I am a section hiker and have only completed 200 miles on the AT so far but I have encounter many characters when hiking in the spring as the thru-hikers were on the trail.  It was great to follow some of them through to the end!,1443139200,,259,4.0588235294117645
5084028,5,B007FXUI5C,One of the more interesting AT videos.,1443139200,,38,4.571428571428571
5084029,3,B007FXUI5C,"Not what I expected, was hoping for more in depth personal stories and personalities, What I've seen so far is very surface level and shallow. Guess I was hoping for some deeper introspection from folks on the trail.",1441238400,,216,4.7105263157894735
5084030,4,B007FXUI5C,A nice documentary about the great people who have chosen to experience the wonder of hiking the AT.,1440979200,,100,4.611111111111111
5084031,4,B007FXUI5C,A great Appalachian Trail hiker saga. Well worth the time.,1440028800,,58,4.9

5084033,5,B007FXUI5C,"First off I'm also 52 ( age the film maker was when he started the AT) so I began inspired . I plan to do the AT next spring & this just made me very happy & excited .
I've read a lot on the AT but this film shows all sorts of hiker "" feeds"", trail day celebrations, etc I have read nothing about! I wish I'd purchased instead of rented bc I found myself pausing to take notes of great stops, special inns, etc.
I've seen several films on thru hiking & this is different - you get to see the "" personality"" & love on the trail- I highly recommend this for anyone ( especially us older people that aren't in our best shape!) planning to thru hike . I even saw an alternate thing called "" Aqua blazing"" (??!!) that substitutes kayaking part of trail which I did not know anyone could do ! There's loads on info on here & I recommend buying not renting bc u can get great resources on this film I now am buying the next one ( he's made 3 of this title!)",1433289600,6,950,3.9274611398963732

5084038,5,B007FXUI5C,"There's a saying that ""everyone must walk their own trail."" Thank God the Scott ""Squatch"" Herriott lets us walk with him. I heard about this film trough a backpacking podcast, as I am an avid backpacker and section hiker. I have since watched Wayfaring, the Walking Series of films, and both current Flip Flop Flippin films. This one is BY FAR my favorite and puts the Hollywood attempts at depicting trail culture to shame, in my opinion. For me, he touches on my favorite part of hiking an backpacking: the people you meet. As much as I love the solitude (and he does show this aspect as well), my trail is walked from character to character.",1420848000,,644,4.560344827586207
5084039,5,B007FXUI5C,This is a great video if you like hiking adventures and you like to see real people doing real things. It is not a movie with actors or a dry documentary about hiking the AT. It is well made and captures the personality of many real hikers that have the drive to Through Hike the AT. It is interesting and comical due to the people that tell their stories about the trail. I loved it enough to watch both and will be watching the third when it is available.,1419811200,,457,4.146067415730337
5084040,4,B007FXUI5C,Typically spontaneous doc of the trail and those who hike it.,1419033600,,61,4.636363636363637
5084041,1,B007FXUI5C,"Definitely agree that this was thrown together, choppy, and all with a constant, unsteady camera.  Total waste of money. Trailer looked excellent, but actual movie is a big disappointment.",1417564800,,188,5.482758620689655
5084042,5,B007FXUI5C,Pretty funny; makes u wanna get out there on the trail,1416355200,,54,4.0

5084044,4,B007FXUI5C,Good sampling of personalities on the trail in a humorous presentation.,1412640000,,71,5.545454545454546
5084045,4,B007FXUI5C,"I've heard about hiking the AT but had absolutely no idea what that meant.  The film leaves me informed, charmed, inspired and I can now pronounce Katahdin.",1412294400,,156,4.777777777777778
5084046,4,B007FXUI5C,"I didn't give it 5 stars because, while initially interesting, it became repetitive. The maker is funny and the people interesting, but I
honestly don't see how there was enough to make a second episode.",1408233600,,203,4.828571428571428
5084047,1,B007FXUI5C,"Boring.  If you want to watch a movie about a bunch of people, including lots of hippies, you will love this.  If you want to watch a documentary about the AT and the beauty and wonders, don't get this.",1404691200,2,202,4.153846153846154
5084048,4,B007FXUI5C,I really enjoyed the people that he met on the AT. It is a fun look at the characters on the trail rather than a look at the trail,1401148800,2,130,3.5172413793103448
5084049,3,B007FXUI5C,Kind of sloppy and thrown together.  Too broken up.  Feels more like he wanted to try to justify being on the trail and to recoup some money for it.  I loved Walked but they kind of went downhill after that one.,1399507200,,211,4.097560975609756
5084050,5,B007FXUI5C,"I thought the film was really enjoyable. I liked the jokes/cracks that Scott makes at the various people he meets. It kind of reminds me of ""me"". If I don't tease you, I don't like you. I felt that he captured the essence of the thru-hiker and interviewed people that have a decent vocabulary. Definitely worth the buy. If you still want the adventure of the thru-hike with some enjoyable humor mixed in, buy it.",1367193600,,412,4.506666666666667
5084051,5,B007FXUI5C,"I laughed. I cried.  It was better than cats.
Seriously, this is a fantastic film.  My only complaint is that it wasn't long enough.  But then I guess that's why there's Flip Flop Flippin' 2!",1364774400,,191,4.4

8515980,5,B007FXUI5C,It was an excellent mix of real life on the trail from the Narrator (Squatch) and a series of interviews with then current hikers. It was funny but also showed some of the tougher serious aspects of the trail.,1473465600,,209,4.384615384615385

8515982,3,B007FXUI5C,"Interesting film that examines the variety of people one might expect to meet while hiking the AT. Videographer skips around on the AT and interviews hikers, as well as trail angels (people who provide food and/or shelter for hikers). Spends a lot of time off the trail at pit stops and gatherings.",1471651200,,298,4.75
