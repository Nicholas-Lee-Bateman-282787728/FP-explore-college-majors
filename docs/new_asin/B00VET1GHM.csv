8709893,4,B00VET1GHM,"This 1942 Italian film is set in Florence at the time of the Medicis. Without giving away too much, it is basically a revenge story that backfires. Directed by Alessandro Blasetti and starring Amedeo Nazzari, Osvaldo Valenti, Clara Calamai and Valentina Cortese, the film has sumptuous productions values with just the right scale, and wonderful b&w chiaroscuro photography by Mario Craveri. The print offered here is decent enough, but youd better be well versed in Italian as the rapid fire subtitles provided are rather dim and the tiniest ever, by this I mean minuscule. You would need a telephoto lens installed in your eyeballs in order to make them out. Maybe they would be legible on a theater screen, but on a 60 inch flat panel it is absolute torture. And though I detest dubbed movies, in this case I would have welcomed that option, but unfortunately it is not offered on this DVD. Nevertheless, this film is a worthy and most welcome offering. I just hope that any future releases of old European classics from this company provide better subtitles. Only 4 stars for the DVD and not the film.",1435968000,2,1105,4.790575916230367
