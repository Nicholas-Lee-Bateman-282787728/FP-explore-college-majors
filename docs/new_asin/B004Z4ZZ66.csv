Using her own horse for demonstration is very helpful. Deb Bennett is vastly knowledgeable and makes that knowledge clear and practical for the rest of us. I'd take her genuine, home-made dvd over any highly polished, highly produced one any day because the quality of the content beats all. Some may grouse because she takes aim at many widespread practices that actually harm the horse. But she explains clearly the why and how if you're willing to take on board that you and/or your trainer may be doing something dead wrong from your horse's perspective. If I hadn't already moved away from my old show training, I probably would have been resistant myself. But now I get it. This is important stuff if you love your horse(s).",1430611200,,890,4.823529411764706
8449417,3,B004Z4ZZ66,"Deb Bennett may know the building blocks of conformation, but her presentation was very blah and boring. The topic is something I've very interested in, but I found myself trying hard not to fall asleep. She just stood beside her horse and talked most of the time. Very poor presentation. A book would be more interesting.",1356393600,,322,4.767857142857143
