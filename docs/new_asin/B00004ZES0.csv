7928598,4,B00004ZES0,"I had Super Gang to arrive in the mail on yesterday, I was anxious because of all the Bruceploitation flicks that I'd seen from early childhood, this one seemed to have been one of the few I'd missed. And looking at some of the earlier critiques, I was anxious(the only other Bruceploitation flick to get a 5 on CDnow was Chinese Connection 2 w/t Bruce Li...and it turned out to be a true classic). I already knew that the movie would be an attempt to cash in on Bruce Lee's legacy, and it WAS a classic, lots of action and lots of structure...but I didn't see any Bruce Lee footage blended in a la Game of Death style as described earlier, all we see is Bruce Le(the 2nd best Bruce Lee clone to Bruce Li in my opinion), who isn't even the star of the flick...and he gets knocked off before the end. LOL! This film would've gotten a 5 from me if they hadn't tried to pass it off as a Bruce Lee film(because it just so happened to feature a Bruce Lee clone in a supporting role), but it's a keeper, and Bruce Le isn't trying to dupe fans into thinking he's the real deal...he's being himself. Also, the movie is well put together, considering most of Bruce Le's flicks are without plot and look like they were shot in someone's back yard(ie Enter the Game of Death). SUPER GANG IS HOTTT! BUY THE MOVIE!",1139875200,2,1301,4.271255060728745
