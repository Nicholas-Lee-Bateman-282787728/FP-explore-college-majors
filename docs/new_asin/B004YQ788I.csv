4503127,5,B004YQ788I,"Very informative glimpse at the beginnings of Protestant Christianity in North Korea as a portrayal of the life and martyrdom of of one young missionary.

Few Americans are aware that South Korea is one of the most Christian nations on Earth. Or that socialist North Korea is one of the most vicious persecutors of Christians. Estimates are that over 30,000 people are held N Korean prisons for the crime of being Christians, and they are tortured, starved, and used as slave labor, and few if any of them will ever leave those prisons alive.

North Korea is aided in its persecution of Christians by China. For example, when Koreans escape across the border to China, the Communist Chinese return them to Korea to be tortured to death. Without the aid of China, the North Korean regime would fall, and its people would be free.

To learn more about the barbarity and scale of the persecution of Christians in North Korea, google:

4503129,4,B004YQ788I,"Interesting story of a very brave, devoted man who endured many hardships himself; yet he held on to this faith until the very bitter end and died a hero in the eyes of many.",1397088000,,174,4.147058823529412
4503130,5,B004YQ788I,"I get inspired reading biographies so it was very interesting for me to learn about the beginnings of the Korean Christian Church through this simple documentary.  It would make an excellent entry in the Christian Film Festival held every year in San Antonio. I wish Amazon would consider putting the winners of this Film Festival on Amazon Prime, or more Christian movies in general. Christian movies are getting better all the time, and the Servant of Christ is one example.
Thank you!",1395878400,5,487,4.939024390243903

8448726,5,B004YQ788I,"As a believer, I am thankful for all the sacrifices of those who came before us. Korea would never have been a Christian nation without these martyrs. It is by the grace of God and through His love that we have many believers in Korea. After watching this short documentary, I repented a lot because I lack love. There are yet so many that do not know Jesus. Specially, in the US, there are many new comers (immigrants and students), they do not know Jesus and yet I do not do much. I don't have the love or the courage to give the bible and really pray for them. However, now, I must repent and gather my heart so I too can play a role in God's plans.

Lovely documentary and I will share with other believers :D",1466035200,3,713,4.166666666666667
8448727,5,B004YQ788I,"Being a Korean,  I was touched to see that the seed of christianity was planted by a man who traveled to the foreign land in faith over 100 years ago.  Even though he did not see the fruit of his devotion, the gospel spread throughout Korea regardless of the circumtances.  It shows God is truly alive and the Holy Spirit is working in us!",1447718400,3,339,4.265625

8448731,3,B004YQ788I,Educational with info I did not know.  But quite simplistic in style.  Presentation seemed to move somewhat slowly.  Not one of the better documentaries I have viewed via Amazon Prime.,1433721600,,184,5.066666666666666

8448734,5,B004YQ788I,"I knew that something remarkable happened in Korea and that finally when 30 percent of the people were Christian, the dictator just quit and said take over.
