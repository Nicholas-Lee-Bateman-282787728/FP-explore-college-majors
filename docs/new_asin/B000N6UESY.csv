2757003,4,B000N6UESY,"Everything you can ask from a great group of comedic writers - yes, they are fixated on potty humor and sexual innuendo, but hey, its MXC!  Just wish they would leave out the multiple previews at the beginning of each DVD.  This is a DVD that leaves you laughing - and can be viewed multiple times.

Keep the seasons coming!",1183680000,,324,4.366666666666666
2757004,5,B000N6UESY,"Great show! I couldn't stop watching these when they came to me, perfect for any MXC fan, or for those who just like a rather pointless and very humourous TV show.",1181174400,,163,4.290322580645161
2757005,5,B000N6UESY,"Easily as funny as season one, if not funnier. New games, new groups, and new laughs. The behind the scenes footage was very inciteful as well. Wouldn't have pictured the group of people putting this together as they are. Definitley a must buy.",1180483200,,244,4.6976744186046515
2757006,4,B000N6UESY,"Don't let the edited version of Episode 12 keep you from buying this set as the remaining 12 are here in their entirely. In terms of special features, it's a lot like Season One, there yet another episode of ""Takeshi Castle"". While they made impovements on ""Kenny Blankenship's Top 25 Most Eliminations of the Season"" over the season one set, the ""Behind the Scenes of MXC leaves something to be desired as it doesn't really us how they put the show together (most of it is shows the voice actors in the recording room). Hopefully, we'll see more seasonal sets of MXC.

A note about the edited show: Episode 12: Real Monsters Vs. Commercial Mascots has been edited by 45%. unlike the other reviewers, I don't really like this show. Those giving these this set a low rating just because of that edited show should be pointing their fingers at the copyright holders of the monsters that's been cut out.",1178582400,6,900,4.625
2757007,5,B000N6UESY,Made the mistake and bought this from another place - never again.  Bought this from Amazon and got the complete 2nd season (not a partial season my former online dvd source).  Check here first - always!,1178496000,3,203,4.611111111111111
2757008,5,B000N6UESY,"If you ever seen this show it speaks for itsself.  Having them all on one collection is terrific, and every bit as good as season 1.

This show is abslutely hilarious.  If you haven't seen it you are truely missing out.  Sometimes the commentary is a little lame but the action and extreme eliminations of the day more than make up for it.  Add in a couple beers and a couple friends and max out the comedy of this one!",1178409600,2,419,4.1875
2757009,4,B000N6UESY,"Like all the other reviewers stated, the monster vs. mascot show is completely butchered up.  It seemed to be the unanimous favorite, as it is also my favorite episode, and one of the reasons I bought this DVD.  I was really looking foreward to seeing Queerwig and Inoperable Tumora again, but sadly, neither is present.  I don't feel that it detracts so much from the other content, as the rest of the episodes are extremely funny and entertaining.  Another episode of Takeshi's Castle is also included along with a behind the scenes special feature.  The commentary is sexual as ever, and the names and job descriptions of the participants are hilarious.  I don't know where these guys come up with this stuff, but is sure is great!  4 out of 5 stars for the circumcised version of monsters vs. mascots, but still, if you're a fan, don't be afraid to buy it.  **Just a note:  The original version of monsters vs. mascots is viewable on youtube.  You'll have to watch it in separate sections, but it's all there if you search.",1177891200,8,1027,4.624309392265193
2757010,2,B000N6UESY,"Although MXC is a great show, I sadly have to give the DVD only 2 stars for editing the best episode on the set.",1177718400,2,112,3.7083333333333335
2757011,4,B000N6UESY,I love this show and am so happy it has been released on DVD. Like the other reviewer said though it totally sucks buying a DVD of a tv show and have scenes edited out. Piss N Boots and the Queerwig were two of the funniest characters in the episode.,1177286400,,250,4.02
2757012,3,B000N6UESY,"I was waiting for this one, because it would hold my favorite episode, MONSTERS Vs. MASCOTS (aka The Monster Show).

Got it home, & I see on the INSIDE packaging ""HIGHLIGHTS"" - Edited from Broadcast version. NOOOOOOOO

Pop it in & sure enough, EVERY rubber-suited monster scene is edited OUT. The beginning, where Vic & Ken gather the monsters, sinkers & floaters cut up, Muddy Balls cut up, and Stones of Mount McKidney COMPLETELY cut.

The only thing I can think of is it had to get cut due to copyright problems. The monsters are mostly Ultraman & Dynaman critters, and an ARMY of Ultramen fight them off at the end. The character dubbed ""Piss In Boots"" is actually an Astroboy-like costume, so that's why HE's out. Ah well.. At least I have it on VHS from broadcast. So word of warning - if you HAVE it from broadcast, DON'T ELIMINATE YOUR TAPE!!! INDEED!!!!",1176940800,23,862,4.584415584415584
2757023,4,B000N6UESY,"It's not terribly politically correct, but it's funny as hell. A Japanese game show from the 80s dubbed over by American guys making inappropriate comments, as the players haplessly fail and almost injure themselves.",1394755200,,216,5.382352941176471
2757024,5,B000N6UESY,"My husband and I love this show! They used to show it on Spike TV, but they since discontinued. I'm glad I found it on here and it arrived just in time for Xmas!",1391385600,,161,3.764705882352941
2757025,5,B000N6UESY,This is the show to watch when you feel down.  It'll pick you up and make you feel good about life,1389571200,,98,3.6666666666666665
2757026,5,B000N6UESY,"Like all of the MXC dvds, this one made me laugh so hard the entire time it was playing that I had to pause it every now and then just to catch my breath. Previous to coming across MXC on Spike, I had seen this show on TV in its original Japanese form as Takeshi's Castle while staying with friends in the UK. Even having no idea what was being said, we were laughing our heads off. It is many times funnier with commentary by Vic and Kenny. I'm 60 years old and I've never seen anything this funny on TV. However, I only recommend watching one episode at a time lest you accidentally asphyxiate yourself.",1389052800,,605,4.224137931034483
2757027,5,B000N6UESY,"If you want a good laugh MXC is for you.  Each time you watch it you hear something you missed.
Not for kids or wives without a sense of humor.",1388620800,,143,3.7666666666666666
2757028,5,B000N6UESY,"Loved this show when it was on tv and glad to see that the seasons are available on DVD,  would prefer bluray but not really necessary since the actual Japanese show that's dubbed over is from the early 90's so no high definition available.  Great price as well I plan on building up the collection of seasons. Arrived quickly and exactly as advertised.",1378771200,,353,4.587301587301587
2757029,1,B000N6UESY,The first season DVD skips! This was priced high and too forever to deliver. I doesn't even play. So dissapointing.,1378166400,,115,4.8
2757030,5,B000N6UESY,"A great collection, minus the altered 12th episode. Stupid copyright laws and even more stupid prudishness... ALMOST makes me downgrade it two only 4 stars. Meh.",1377993600,,161,5.230769230769231
2757031,5,B000N6UESY,My husband started watching these years ago and then Wipeout came out.  You can't beat the humor of the Asians that participate in the challenges or the American dubbed commentary.  My husband is so glad I found these DVDs.  He could sit there and watch for hours!,1357516800,,264,4.574468085106383
2757032,5,B000N6UESY,"The product I received was great! (which was a season of MXC) It was everything I was expecting, in perfect condition, and it got to me in a timely manner. No complaints, was a very easy transaction. I'm very happy with my purchase! Thanks!",1314835200,,240,4.4772727272727275
2757033,5,B000N6UESY,"I was on this show in Japan.

(  The Japanese  title is .......""Fuun takeshi Jo"" )

_____________________________________________

I have been looking for some time now to find this  MXC  episode that I am on.

The episode  is .......... ""Former Olympians ...... USA vs World""

It is funny to see myself renamed  as .......... "" American Actress --  Tony Davis""
&  to have  my voice dubbed over as well.

The humor is fast & sharp

I love it!!

2757034,5,B000N6UESY,"This stuff is great. A'la Mystery Theater 3000, these guys overdub a Japanese contestant show and it is really a hoot. It's worth getting for some great entertainment that I'm sure will make you laugh your butt off.",1250726400,,215,4.684210526315789
2757035,5,B000N6UESY,"I actually prefer this season to the first because it has more high impact crashes and they show a larger variety of stunts from the original show.  They both are great, but if you are looking to decide between one or the other, I would start here.",1242345600,,248,4.276595744680851
2757036,5,B000N6UESY,"This is a great show. It's really stupid which makes it really hilarious. Some of the jokes themselves actually take some thought so it's not all just people injuring themselves in embarassing and painful ways. Search for better prices elsewhere on these MXC seasons or look on the Amazon Marketplace for ""New and Used Items,"" they're almost always as good as the brand new items sold directly by Amazon.com.",1225756800,,408,4.927536231884058
2757037,4,B000N6UESY,"this is a very funny dvd! I love the whole series all seasons!
if you like people falling then this is for you!
real funny commentary too.",1212969600,,138,4.148148148148148
2757038,5,B000N6UESY,This is a great show and they need to keep the episodes coming! It is hilarious!,1206230400,,80,4.0625
2757039,5,B000N6UESY,"Ever since i saw it awhile back on Spike TV.  I saw the dvds available and it was not even a question.  The show is funny and yes the stunts might be unbelievable, but the contestants and announcers, voice actors bring something else to this show, fun.  There are some painful eliminations in here and all of that but nothing extraordinarily outrageous.  Its just a cool show to watch and enjoy.  I like the Log run and the one where contestants try and cross a bridge while getting blasted by brass balls from the other folks in the show.

Great value and all around enjoyable show for all.",1197417600,,591,4.425925925925926
2757040,5,B000N6UESY,"If you have the 1st season you will love the 2nd. The crew is back and with some new fun stuff for others to do.  Just watching how people can put themselves thru to win braggin rights is funny.

Get it and you will enjoy it.",1190764800,,225,3.869565217391304
2757041,5,B000N6UESY,we love this show.  so funny!  it's great to have it on DVD.,1189641600,,60,3.5384615384615383
2757042,4,B000N6UESY,"Watching other people get hurt has never been this funny.  Apart from the edited episode, this collection is the pinnacle of MXC hilarity.  I look forward to the upcoming collections.  Hopefully, we will get to see the ""Monster"" episode in its entirety once again.",1183680000,,264,4.954545454545454
8175127,5,B000N6UESY,"MXC is one of the funniest shows ever to be found on TV. If you have seen it, then you need to buy these discs. If you have not yet seen it, then you need to buy these discs.",1512604800,,174,3.4871794871794872

8175129,5,B000N6UESY,"I love this show, and it's great to have it on DVD.  A great collection, awesome quality and sound on these discs.  It evens contains one of the shows from the original Japanese broadcast, showing just how different it is from the American version.  A great DVD collection.  Will be buying season 3 soon.",1454630400,,304,4.574074074074074

8175131,5,B000N6UESY,"This has got to be the best DVD I've ever bought! I got Season 2 because all the characters are familiar with each other and the obstacles are all new and different. Unfortunately there is one edited-from-broadcast episode and I don't understand why it was edited so severely, but the other 99% of the season is great!!!",1427500800,,320,4.631578947368421

8175134,5,B000N6UESY,"I watched this series on TV years ago and what makes it so funny is the English speaking commentators who speak for the Japanese presenters and contestants, it has that South Park comedy style that people get such a kick over.

The best Jerry the best.",1398902400,,252,4.478260869565218

8175136,5,B000N6UESY,"While this is an awesome show, several episodes on either disc refuse to play(same is true for my season 1 set). It's obviously an error within the disc itself, not due to the condition(near perfect). Also, all my other dvd's and games play fine so it's not my hardware. Episode 5 and 6, and 2 more on the second disc flat out will not play, they freeze, skip, etc. Just a heads up to anyone viewing this item.",1397433600,,410,4.269230769230769
