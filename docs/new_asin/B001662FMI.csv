8260993,5,B001662FMI,"Arika and Mashiro are reunited in the valley of cyborgs. They learn much about themselves and the meaning of life. All of the Otome are on the run from Nagi's army. Nagi still has the Major and Nina under his control. The world is banding together to stop him, but with the awesome power at Garderobe. Arika's mother is at the center of that power.

This is a pretty good DVD all of the pieces are falling into place for the coming final battle. This series started off weak, but is getting better as it moves toward the end.",1356307200,,525,4.303030303030303
8260994,4,B001662FMI,4 STARS because most of the fun declined after the take over .But there is still action/adventure there still of course. It is still well done & creative as before. But what i do not like is the wars. But the theme of creating peace is what i like a lot.,1355961600,,254,4.0
8260995,5,B001662FMI,"I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.
In its way as good as the original My-Hime. Buying from sellers of good used dvds I bought this collection for a price a little less than a collection box set would normally cost. The shipping cost can be reduced if you go directly to the sellers web site when ordering more than one item. Make sure you can trust them.",1253577600,,510,4.322916666666667

8260997,5,B001662FMI,"My-Otome continues to be an enjoyable viewing experience with the release of the Volume 6 DVD. The English track, though, is marred by some poor performances by the English dub voice actors, particularly Tracy Sutton as Tomoe Marguerite. Ms. Sutton sounds wooden and monotonous delivering many of Tomoe's lines in Episode 22 ""Song of Destruction"" (""Horobi no Uta"") of My-Otome, especially in comparison to her Japanese voice acting counterpart Rie Tanaka, who voices Tomoe Marguerite and Fiar Grosse in My-Otome. (Tracy Sutton voices only Tomoe Marguerite in My-Otome.) Japanese viewers just about universally praised Ms. Tanaka's performance as Tomoe Marguerite on My-Otome threads at Japan's 2-Channel, or 2ch, message boards (the world's largest) back in early to mid 2006, during and soon after My-Otome's initial broadcast run on television in Japan. For those who can read Japanese or who can have someone translate it for them, on Page 115 of the My-ZHiME / My-Otome Anime Perfect Guide (ISBN: 425313016X) published by Akita Shoten, in the COMMENT section for Episode 22, My-Otome director Masakazu Obara mentions the ""extraordinary acting performance of Rie Tanaka,"" while My-Otome series writer Hiroyuki Yoshino ""takes his hat off"" to ""Rie Tanaka's acting in the role of Tomoe."" If you have enjoyed My-Otome Vols. 1-5, then you should enjoy My-Otome Vol. 6.",1217808000,3,1366,5.358139534883721
8260998,5,B001662FMI,"My-Otome is one of the best anime series I have watched in a long time.  I love it because it excels in so many ways: The art, the story, the characters...the music!  The music of My-Otome is simply beautiful.  I think My-Otome is much better than My-Hime because it focus more on the sacrifices and the choices that the characters must make in order to achieve their goals, whereas My-Hime focuses more on romantic themes.
I'm not gonna spoil the story for anyone, but you should really check out volume 6.  It doesn't dissapoint at all.",1214956800,4,538,4.572916666666667
