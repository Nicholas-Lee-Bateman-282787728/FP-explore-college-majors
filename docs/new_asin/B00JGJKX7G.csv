8650680,5,B00JGJKX7G,Love the films of Norma Shearer. Have a large collection of her films. This 1929 films starts of slowly like a stage play. Sound was still quite new in MGM films.  As the movie goes on it gets better so by the end it is very good. A happy finish. Had many shots of the classic Shearer poise. The story was simple like most of the early sound era. The Sets had the quality that was the MGM style. The acting was good with a fine cast. A fine Norma Shearer movie with all the little things that she would perfect in later films. Which made her a legend. Her style acting has gone out of fashion in today's Hollywood. Yet she makes her films come alive with her beautiful way of making her characters come alive. Which is why I love her films.,1471910400,,740,4.138888888888889

8650682,5,B00JGJKX7G,"This is just a true gem of an early talkie! I love this version; the 1937 remake just doesn't compare (although I like that one, too!) The cast is really what adds a gritty aspect to this film that makes everything feel more real, not so glossy and over worked as the second one tends to feel.

Basil Rathbone is in a rare lead... He could always play a snake in the grass so well, but here you have a touch of sympathy for his character. He is very elegant, too. His way of delivering lines is just superb! Quite a handsome fella, I think.

I have never been a big Norma Shearer fan, but here she shines like I had never seen her before. She was wonderful, and her hair was absolutely adorable here. Just the fashions alone in this film keep me captivated. She really gives a wonderful performance here as the lady thief.

The other supporting characters are just as charming. And as for the quality here... Once again Warner video offers a wonderful print and the sound! I watched this film for the first time on TCM and the scratchy audio was just about enough to driver you batty. Problem solved here... Still some static but for the year? A noticeable improvement! Thanks Warner archive!!",1459209600,,1193,4.438356164383562
8650683,3,B00JGJKX7G,This is one case where the remake was ever so much better than the original.  Basil Rathbone as a dandy doesn't do him justice.,1455235200,,127,4.291666666666667
8650684,4,B00JGJKX7G,"This is Norma Shearers 2nd sound film, an elegant, sophisticated drawing room comedy based on a successful stage play by Frederick Lonsdale. Fay Cheyney {FC} {Ms. Shearer} poses as a wealthy Australian widow cultivating various well heeled suckers sapiens in order to loot them with help of confederates posing as servants in her employ.

 She meets a wealthy widow, Mrs. Webley {Maude Turner Gordon} and sets her sights on stealing a valuable necklace. Mrs. Webley is captivated by FCs charm and invites her for a weekend house party at her country estate. BUT even though its bad for business, FC has fallen in love with Mrs. Webleys suave, handsome sardonic nephew  Lord Arthur Dilling {Basil Rathbone} who after catching her in a huge indiscretion {stealing the necklace} then engages with her in a cat versus mouse battles of the will and sexes but who is the cat and who is the mouse ?

The complicated plot machinations that follow are enhanced by the pithy and amusing dialogue that make up for the static camerawork with the filming being confined to {basically} one set. In 1929 sound films were still in the process of learning how to work with and around} the primitive sound equipment that made so many of the early sound films stage-bound productions.

 Ms. Shearer is excellent in playing an assured women of the world and handles her dialogue with confidence and humor.  Mr. Rathbone is smooth and supercilious in his role as an aristocrat who is not above stooping to blackmail to get what he wants  which is Ms. Shearer of course!! A very British sounding cast lend able support, in particular Hedda Hopper {Lady Maria} and Herbert Bunson {Lord Elton}.

 MGMs top behind the scenes talent  cinematography  by William Daniels, set design by Cedric Gibbons, gowns by Adrian and direction by Sidney Franklin all contribute to this films overall excellence. Sporting her trademark shiny, sleek bobbed hair, using an elegant cigarette holder as a prop and modeling superb gowns by MGMs resident costume genius Gilbert Adrian  Ms. Shearer never looked better. Despite its age and stagy mounting this a entertaining film well worth viewing and I give it between 4 and 4 1/2 stars especially for fans of Norma Shearer  Recommended.",1443312000,3,2241,4.941333333333334
8650685,5,B00JGJKX7G,"A well done comedy of manners is an art form that seems to have gone by the wayside in this day and age.  This performance combines the fantastic comedic and acting talents of Basil Rathbone and Norma Shearer in a really well written play with great badinage and repartee flawlessly delivered.  It was a total pleasure to watch from beginning to end.  A real pity that Rathbone became typecast as either a villain or Sherlock Holmes, because he was capable of so much more, especially as a romantic lead and as a comedian.  Anyone who likes sophisticated, well written, and well acted comedy should definitely enjoy this immensely.",1408665600,7,631,4.814814814814815
8650686,5,B00JGJKX7G,"Frist I must tell you that I have been trying to find this film on DVD for 2 years.
It was on TCM early one morning in February 2012. I just had time to slip a blank VHS tape into my combo television, and was
so glad I was able to record it!
This is really a vintage find since it was filmed in 1929.
The dialogue is a little slow at times but I was fascinated to see Hedda Hopper in a small role as a guest at the country home of
Mrs Cheyney (played by Norma Shearer). Norma plays a thief that is part of a band of thieves fronting as a head butler and several
minor players as the chauffeur and jr. butler. Norma entertains the local gentry and plans to steal the pearls of one of her overnight guests.
The plan is foiled when another overnight guest (Basil Rathbone) smells a rat when he remembers recognizing her butler from a trip
he had taken several years prior when his watch had been stolen. I won't give away the rest of the story, but if you love the early talkies and can appreciate watching great stars such a Basil Rathbone and Norma Shearer in their heyday, this film will not disappoint.
I have probably watched it over a 100 times and now I will watch it even more times since I will have it on the DVD disk.
My VHS tape was cheap and the quality of the picture varied from time to time.
Enjoy your purchase, I know I will!",1403222400,8,1340,4.079545454545454
