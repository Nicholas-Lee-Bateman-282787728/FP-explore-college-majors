Regional coding laws promote cultural supremacy which I am against! This show does not stick to just Germany! They've filmed in Hungary as well, if I remember correctly. This is awesome! Why? It promotes world PEACE instead of the evil ""hate"" that the Regional coding laws inadvertenly promote.",1520726400,,427,4.944444444444445
