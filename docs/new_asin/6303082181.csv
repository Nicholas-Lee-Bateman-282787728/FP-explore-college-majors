7836578,5,6303082181,"This was the first episode of SOAP that I ever saw. When it first came out my local ABC channel did not show it, but they did show the commercials for it. Surprisingly,the commercials were just as funny as the show. The next season, my local channel (as well as others) began to show it. I have a feeling that is why this show was created in order to introduce us to the show and, of course, to the Campbells and Tates. Each member of each family is a suspect in Peter's murder (yes even the butler). And Jessica Tate and her brother in law, Burt Campbell, carefully ""profile"" each character and at the end the narrator narrows it down to five suspects. And believe it or not, you  may be more confused about who done it after the show than before. Which is a good thing because it keeps you coming back for more.

 SOAP is the story of two families,the Tates and the Campbells and the matriarchs thereof, Jessica and Mary. Jessica lives in a huge house and enjoys the privileges of wealth. However, her husband suffers from chronic infidelity, has two daughters who always pick the wrong man, a teenage son who she constantly shelters from everything, and a father who is still fighting World War II using her house as a permanent base camp.
At first she appears to be naive to her husband's affairs, but as the show evolves, we find out that she knew all along (including her wedding night), but was simply in denial due to her love for him.

Mary, on the other hand, is not quite as rich and is constantly seen doing housework. Her husband is loyal to a fault, but has a dark secret that causes him to think he is invisible and unable to perform his marital duties. She has two sons, one in the mafia and the other likes to wear her clothes. And one stepson with a split personality with his alter ego voice coming out of a ventriloquist's dummy named Bob and ironically Bob may know more than what he is saying.

Confused or sorry?  You won't be if you buy this video!!!

The VHS tape that I got was of great quality and it was nice to take a trip down memory lane despite being a little, well you know, ""soapy"". It would be nice to see a DVD version of this one episode.",1395360000,,2175,4.290243902439024

7836580,3,6303082181,I didn't enjoy the snipit version of this video.  I would have rather seen whole episodes.,1037232000,2,90,4.625
7836581,3,6303082181,I was disappointed in the snipit version of this video.  It recaps past episodes that involved the characters inolved with Peter but doesn't really capture the essence of any of the episodes.  I guess I would have preferred to see a few episodes in their original form.,1037232000,8,269,4.702127659574468
7836582,5,6303082181,"I can't say enough good things about this show or this 90 minute movie which is really a recap of everything that happened in the first season.
Jessica (katherine Helmond) and Burt (Richard Mulligan, God bless him!) are what made the sitcom what it was in addition to many others who went on to do great things after the show was canceled in 1981.
If you want a movie that has a lot more going for it than just your typical cookie cutter Father Knows Best clan. The Tates and The Campbells are for you.",1016064000,3,502,4.294736842105263
7836583,4,6303082181,"Soap was is a classic. Written by the Witt Thomas Harris team (who also wrote The Golden Girls, Empty Nest, Nurses and Benson to name but 4) this video contains Beatrice Arthur as a guardian at the gates of heaven, it  really is funny!, I won't tell you what happens it this video, and what  other clips are shown as it will spoil it. Buy it! it is well worth it!",963100800,4,363,4.098591549295775
