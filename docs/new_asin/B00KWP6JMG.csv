6452559,5,B00KWP6JMG,I have Season 1 & 2 and now with the third season I have a lot of watching Dr. Kildare. Great watching.,1412035200,,103,3.727272727272727
6452560,4,B00KWP6JMG,"Even though this was on TV in the 60's many of the stories are timely.  I enjoyed watching a series I grew up with and I am a big fan of Richard Chamberlain.  Many well known actors appeared in this season and the episodes are well done and well acted if somewhat predictable.  My favorite program had to be ""Tiger, Tiger,"" I was a kid when I first saw it and I have never forgotten it. The regulars on the series are not as self indulgent and whiney as characters in todays medical dramas are and the shows are not as gory, for me this was a plus.",1410220800,6,548,4.055555555555555
6452561,4,B00KWP6JMG,So glad that they release these have been waiting for decades worth the wait.,1409356800,3,77,4.571428571428571
6452562,5,B00KWP6JMG,"Big fan of this show so I might be bias, but loved the transition from Intern to Resident. Love the historical significance of the diseases that existed then that were potentially fatal, but today are curable. Also wonderful episode with the late Lauren Bacall.",1409184000,5,261,4.954545454545454

6452564,5,B00KWP6JMG,This DVD is in excellent condition for a TV series in the early sixties! I used to watch Dr. Kildare all the time when it was on TV! Now I am glad it is on DVD! Can't wait for the next season number 4 to come out on DVD! I recommend this TV series to anyone who loves doctor shows!,1408060800,3,281,3.7
6452565,5,B00KWP6JMG,I just love season 3. Great episodes with so many famous stars included!,1406332800,4,72,4.615384615384615
6452566,3,B00KWP6JMG,"It is an excellent DVD, but the third disc in the first case was dislodged from its base and is scratched quite a lot. I have not watched it yet but I anticipate problems.",1406246400,,171,4.0588235294117645
6452567,5,B00KWP6JMG,"This fantastic MOD release made available by Warner Archive thru Amazon is yet another prime example for fans of such contemporary tv shows as ""Grey's Anatomy"" to step back and trace the evolution of the medical drama genre.  This season contains the compelling 2 part ""event"" story ""Tyger, Tyger"", which served well to inspire further multi-part ""event"" stories in Season 4, including ""Rome Will Never Leave You"" and ""She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not"".

I so look forward to the Season 4 dvd release of this ground-breaking series (hopefully a Christmas 2014 street date!!!!) Leaving only Season 5 for a release date in 2015 to tie in with television's celebration of 50 years in ""Living Color"".  I highly recommend this title.",1404691200,8,726,4.934426229508197
6452568,5,B00KWP6JMG,"When the first episode starts out it's Dr Kildare's last day as an intern, and by the end he becomes the Chief Resident!  He's always running into challenges, and it is fun to watch him come up with the solutions with his best interest to his patients. If it becomes too difficult, theirs always wise, old Dr Gillespie!  Another thing I like about this show is the guests, many who are TV and motion picture personalities. I've only watched the first four episodes and have already seen: Charles Bronson, Bob Denver, Barbara Eden, Pat Hingle, James Whitmore, and John Anderson. The second episode threw me for a loop, he has a malpractice suit against him, I only wish I was on that jury. This is released as a MOD product, but Warner Brothers has released the first batch as replicated discs, which is what I got. I know some people don't like the price, but if you can wait it will probably drop some. Enjoy the show!",1403308800,12,919,4.497005988023952
6452569,5,B00KWP6JMG,I enjoyed watching these shows as much as I did 50 years ago. I am so glad these shows are available.,1422662400,2,101,3.857142857142857

6452571,1,B00KWP6JMG,"Sad to say that once again i'm ecountering defects... (Season Two had an unreadable disk sector on disk#7, episode 27 rendering it unviewable - fresh out of the box)  Now the first episode on Season 3 Disk 2 is likewise defective...  As I did with the prior issue, I examined the disk surface (again, untouched, fresh from the box) with a jeweler's loupe and see no scratches or dust/dirt.  I should add that I am using a brand new external dvd drive.  I even tried rechecking my season 2 disks on this new drive to eliminate the drive as a possible trouble source, but it plays all fine except that same S2 ep. 27 previously reported.  Whoever Warner has pressing these disks is doing a very shoddy job of quality control!!!  I work unusual shifts and may not be able to arrange for a return within Amazon's warranty period, so I'm afraid this will be the last dvd set I ever purchase from Warner Home Video!",1420848000,,909,4.445783132530121
6452572,5,B00KWP6JMG,"These shows are fabulous.  They are well written and acted, with each episode including guest stars that either prior to this show or later had important careers of their own.  The episodes address the same topics we deal with today (child abuse, euthanasia, drug and alcohol addiction, among others), and it is interesting to see the similarities and differences in the ways these issues are dealt with now vs. then (Season 3 was filmed in 1963).  Not to mention the incredible visuals: clothes, cars, charm bracelets, etc.!  We purchased all three seasons in September, which included enough episodes to keep us entertained for 3 months.  It was a sad day when we reached the end of the last season - wish there were more . . .",1420675200,2,729,4.708661417322834
6452573,5,B00KWP6JMG,OMG some of the best television ever. I highly recommend!!,1420416000,,58,4.9
6452574,5,B00KWP6JMG,"Dr. Kildare was a great series for its time.  This was done in black and white so it black and white is NOT your thing be warned.  Dr. Kildare was even more awesome in the third season because he is finally a First Year Resident.  He is finally helping interns learn.  The third season took more risks.  Dr. Kildare as a character is better fleshed out as a living breathing human being in this season.  Many of these episodes have depressingly tragic if realistic endings.  The first and second seasons were far more upbeat and uplifting than season three.  Season three is not all bad or sad endings but their are far more hard endings than in seasons 1 and 2 combined.

Video quality was first rate from what I saw on my 65 inch Samsung with a 240 refresh rate.  The grayscale was excellent and the sound never dropped out or faded.  Sound was constant at all times.  There was no hiss or hum associated with the DVD playback.  The Menu system was very straight foward and easy to use.  There are no special features that talk about the making of Dr. Kildare which would have been nice but I can live without them.  The price while steep for such an old show was not cost prohibitive for me.

The medical science in Dr. Kildare is obviously dated in some parts of the show compared to what we know in 2014.  Unfortunately somethings suffered by fictional patients in Dr Kildare are just as ugly and deadly today as they were in the early 1950's early 60's of Dr. Kildares time.  Cancer of the Pancreas because it hides so well till discovered too late is just as devistating today as it was over 50 years ago.  It is said that Steve Jobs the Apple Computer visionary was taken from us early by that evil known as metastatic pancreatic cancer.  So in some ways Dr. Kildare is as relevant today as it was at production time many years ago.

Most notable in Season 3 is Dr. Kildare takes it on the chin hard when his doctor girlfriend is raped while as he watches being held back by a small army of thugs.  While daring for the time this is the most unrealistic Dr. Kildare ever.  The raped doctor behaved like a Star Treak Vulcan female escaping into the logic of not letting her attacker destory hersense of self.  More interesting Dr. Kildare has his much wanted showdown with the rapist of his doctor girlfriend and does not kill him or at least leave him horribly mamed as I would have loved doing in such a situation.  the only realistic portrayal in that whole episode was the Beast which was this installements namesake.  It was daring and couragous at the time for a mainstream media outlet to even talk about rape in the frank if extremely minimalist way done here.  Back then rape was our cultures dirty little secret and very bravely Dr. Kildare shone a bright light on the subject even if the effort is considered half hearted and insufficent by todays far more liberal standards.

The best thing about watching Dr. Kildare is for what it says about how the USA saw itself as a culture in the long ago 1960's.  The surfer culture, beatnik culture and alcoholic housewife is well represented here.  The story on Epilepsy shows in brutal realistic detail the horror of seizure management in those olden days.  Thankfully 2014 era drugs and surgery offer todays epileptics far greater options for a better life than those depicted on the show.  Still it is nice to watch Dr. Kildare practice what was considered cutting edge medicine at fictional Blair General Hospital.  Oh and I loved the Blair General Hospital Main Building since it looked like a smaller version of LA County General Hospital a design I find timeless in its size, execution and beauty.

For so many reasons I think Dr. Kildare should be part of your collection.  The Dr. Kildare Season 3 is on the dreaded blue disk that are not as forgiving to mishandling or abuse like the silver disks we love.  I am generally very careful with all disks in my collection so it is not so much an issue with me.  I include reference to the fact this Kildare collection is in the blue on demand CD+R disk format because; some people hate and avoid buying shows recorded in this cheaper format.

6452575,5,B00KWP6JMG,"In Germany I'd never heard about this famous american TV-series. Several months ago I saw some clips from the Dr. Kildare show on you-tube and was thrilled. Purchasing of the Third Season was a must do. What a wonderful entertainment, so well written, including extraordinary and exquisite performances, espacially from Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Massay. Almost all of the storylines are very touching and still able to be aplied to our days. What a plenty of ethic values and social rules you can watch and feel within - since tears!  What a bedside-manner from Mr. Chamberlain, but mostly his impeccable diction is for me as an English-learning german very convincing and supporting. Also the looks of the sixties (furniture, facilities, suits...) are interesting zu see. Best purchase I ever made from Amazon! Now I hope to get the First and Second Season too. - The discs are running very well.",1417737600,,895,4.966666666666667
6452576,5,B00KWP6JMG,"I've been waiting for this show to be released for years.  The third season, like the first and second, arrived in great condition. I rationed myself to one episode each evening, but have been out of episodes for several months.  Get with it and release the fourth season (and the fifth).  I check almost every day.",1417478400,2,315,4.589285714285714

8662250,5,B00KWP6JMG,They don't make television medical series like they used to.  Back in Dr. Kildare's day the shows were about the people.  Today its about medical marvels.  Nothing wrong with that but I am more a character person.  Again bought the third season because my hero Jack Lord guest starred that season.  Richard Chamerlain wasn't too bad either!,1461542400,,340,4.894736842105263

8662252,4,B00KWP6JMG,"This is vintage tv, and those who are fans of Dr. Kildare will like Season 3 as much as the seasons that preceded it. It has good writing, very good guest stars, good acting and interesting stories, mixed with medical practices that are not exactly 2015 state of the art.  I have two quibbles which is why not the 5 star rating.  1.  one episode is a 2 parter (guest starring Ruth Roman and Tony Dow) which was completed on ""The 11th Hour"", a production company companion show.  This disc only gives us the Kildare half of the story.  Granted,  it ends,  so that part 2 isn't essential, but the ending here is very downbeat and I would bet the second half had a lot more to offer.  The story line is unintended teen pregnancy which certainly is relevant today.  Warner, you should have included it.  My second quibble has to do with packaging.  Season 2 and 3 have been packaged in much more flimsy containers.  I have learned to open the box while at a table or seated in my easy chair  because 2 or 3 of  discs tend to fly out when it's opened; at a table or while seated, at least I don't have to pick them up off the floor.  Warner, talk to somebody and see if you can't get a better vendor for disc boxes -- companies like Mill Creek offer better containers with their product , which sell for much less, and, presumably,  at a profit,  so the better ones can't be that expensive!",1442361600,2,1385,4.265384615384615

8662254,5,B00KWP6JMG,"Aside from Richard Chamberlain never looking better, the series has been great.  A real trip down memory lane.  I have watched it alternating between Dr. K and Mad Men - totally amazing.  Everyone drinking and smoking, with the doctors even lighting their patients' cigarettes.  The clothes, so 1960s, pre- flower children dressware.  The most interesting thing about Kildare is watching the recent history of forming medical opinions in the general public.  These writers were not afraid to address tough issues.  A lot of what baby boomers think today about health issues is informed by the Kildare series.",1435708800,,608,5.206185567010309
