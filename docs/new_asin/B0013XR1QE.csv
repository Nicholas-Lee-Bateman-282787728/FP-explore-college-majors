8253524,4,B0013XR1QE,"So this is the movie that taught me that to stymie a witch you put her in a barrel. And that's good to know. 1967's MORE THAN A MIRACLE (released in Italy as ""C'era una volta"") was well-received domestically but failed to find an audience internationally. And while I enjoyed watching it, I could see where viewers may be left scratching their heads. Set in 17th century Italy, MORE THAN A MIRACLE is a somewhat bizarre, somewhat surreal, absolutely fractured Neapolitan fairy tale. It's strong on whimsy and farce, and for sure a peculiar imagination was in play behind the scenes.

I knew Sophia Loren was, like, va-va-boom. But I wasn't aware that Omar Sharif, back in the day, was actually a good-looking dude. Sharif plays Rodrigo, an arrogant Spanish prince who prefers taming wild horses to settling down to a dull marriage. Except that seven beautiful princesses have come to the castle, and Rodrigo is being pushed to pick one for a wife. In a tiff, Rodrigo storms out on his unruly stallion and, out in the countryside, is thrown off his saddle. He wanders into a monastery and chances upon a flying monk who informs him ""The woman you love will have an impossible character - just like yours."" Rodrigo protests that he doesn't want to marry and that he does what he wants, all the time. In lieu of useful advice on matrimony, the monk gives the prince a sack of flour and instructs him to have someone bake him seven dumplings when he gets hungry. The monk challenges Rodrigo to eat all seven dumplings, a challenge Rodrigo sneers at. Still, you can feel the fairy tale mechanics being set into motion.

Some time later, the prince espies his horse in the care of Isabella (Loren), a spirited peasant girl picking turnips in the fields. And even though instant rancor develops between the two, Rodrigo demands that the girl cook him seven dumplings. Except that, later, the starving Isabella hands him a plate with only six dumplings on it. Somewhere, the flying monk is smugly going ""Aha!""

And some more stuff happens.

It's a cheerful fable, despite the underpinnings concerning class-consciousness. There's a bawdiness threading thru, thanks to the earthy sensuality Sophia Loren brings to the table. Your eyes feast on cinematography that captures the spectacle of this period fantasy. The film was shot in the countryside near Naples, and these rolling landscapes lend a timeless feel and almost convince me to consult my travel agent. But make no mistake, Sophia Loren, dialing up the sultry, is the film's most sensational visual element. She's such a classical beauty and, as always, she's in dire need of more buttons to retain her modesty in those uber-tight blouses. I love her wilfulness and her fire as Isabella, who doesn't hesitate to trade barbs with the roaring prince. Omar Sharif turns in a magnetic performance, although I'm still not sure I actually like his bullying role. But it's fun watching him rage and barnstorm his way thru the film.

There's a whiff of Cinderella, but only a whiff. I guess they could've called it CINDERELLA, ITALIAN STYLE, only that smacks vaguely of pornographic connotations. Mostly, MORE THAN A MIRACLE steers its own course. What undermines it is the blithe unconcern that seems to dictate the meandering plot. There's a lack of focus, a disjointedness, that maybe a tighter script could've remedied. I guess if you're in the mood for a leisurely fairy tale romp, then you should absolutely hit this up. For me, it's 3.5 out of 5 stars. There are things to like about the film, not the least is that heat between the two leads. Where else can you take in fanciful sights of flying monks and benevolent (but creepy) old witches and prophecies concerning apple dumplings and a rambunctious dishwashing tournament contended by the seven princesses (and a disguised Isabella) to determine who gets to marry the prince? And, yes, Sophia Loren makes washing dishes a very sexy activity indeed. And for those sick puppies out there (raise your hands), there's always that notorious urine as panacea scene at the nunnery.",1349568000,6,4078,4.870317002881844
