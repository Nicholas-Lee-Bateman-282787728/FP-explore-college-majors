8523142,4,B007Y92RRY,"When Ghostbusters hit theaters in 1984 and was closely followed by Back to the Future in 1985, NBC premiered Misfits of Science to tap into the surging popularity of sci-fi comedy. Several aspects of the show were lifted directly from Ghostbusters and Back to the Future, but Misfits of Science quickly found its own voice, due largely to the camaraderie of the central characters.

The two-part premiere episode, being the origin story, is the most engaging. Gloria, a telekinetic teenager, is arrested for inadvertently trashing a mall, while Johnny, an electrically charged lightning thrower, has exiled himself to living in the desert. Gloria, Johnny, and Gloria's probation officer are brought together by scientists Dr. Billy Hayes and his friend Dr. Elvin ""El"" Lincoln (who shrinks) at an eccentric research facility, the Humanidyne Institute, where they are able to use their powers to help others and be accepted for their ""weirdness"".

Misfits of Science is pure 1980s. As the theme song puts it, ""It's like science straight from the heart"". References are made to Indiana Jones, E.T., Cocoon, Miami Vice, even Desperately Seeking Susan - all hugely popular at the time. Optimism and teamwork are incessantly promoted. Dated fashions and big hair abound. The cold war even plays a role in some of the episodes. The dated stuff can be fun, but storylines that follow the A-Team/Knight Rider template (innocent victim bullied by stock baddie seeks help from our heroes who solve a mystery and wrap-up with a chase scene) can test your endurance.

Where Misfits shines is in the comedic asides from the main cast and original touches like Boy Clarence the strength enhanced lab mouse. Plentiful sight gags, wacky special effects, recurring Invisible Man jokes, and general sci-fi lunacy make this show a treat to watch. It's great to see that Misfits of Science is so fondly remembered, despite its short run so many years ago. It was particularly popular in Germany where it's known as Die Spezialisten Unterwegs (roughly: specialists on the move).

This is the region 2 format set released in Germany in 2008. The original English audio is included as an option. Viewing this set requires either a region free DVD player (which you can get for less than $100), or changing the region setting on your computer's DVD-ROM drive to United Kingdom.* Most, possibly all DVD-ROMs will let you change the region setting up to five times before the change becomes permanent.

It's also worth checking Amazon UK and Amazon Germany for alternate prices on this DVD set. They'll accept your current account and convert prices to US dollars. Links to these sites are under the Amazon logo at the bottom of this page.

As for the set itself, the sound quality for the English track isn't as sharp as I imagine it would be on an American DVD release and there aren't any Special Features, but all 16 episodes (both seasons) are here on 5 disks, including ""Three Days of the Blender"", the last episode of the second season, never aired in the US.

8523143,5,B007Y92RRY,It was a great buy for any of those that remember this series. Has a very young Courtney Cox in it. Downer was that if you live outside Europe you need to have an all region dvd player to watch it. Other than that - Great!,1355270400,4,222,3.847826086956522
