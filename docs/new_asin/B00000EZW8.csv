These comic actors were popular from the 1930s to the 1950s. Children laughed but did not realize the bad examples they set. Would they be allowed on TV today? Is there market for their humor? Moe Howard played in a movie of a Shakespeare play. He did not have the looks of an Olivier or Gable. He earned more and worked steadily in these series. And that's what actors do.

Brideless Groom, 1947
Shemp is a Teacher of Voice, we hear his student sing. He learns his uncle died and left him $500,000! [A lot more then.] But only if he is married. Can he get hitched? There is humor in a telephone booth. [Is this still funny today?] Shemp is prettied up. That woman greets Cousin Basil, then rejects him. Shemp finds a woman, they go to the JP for more comic action. Then five women arrive to be the bride. ""You wouldn't hit a lady with that.""We're married."" What will Shemp do now?

Malice in the Palace, 1949
Men enter a restaurant. Three waiters serve them, then must clean up the mess. The conspirators will need three men to do their work. ""Rabbit or hot dogs?"" Curly chases a cat then a dog! Shemp and Moe sample the meal. Curly enjoys the meal. ""These three will get the jewels for us."" A message arrives, are they too late? We learn more about those two men. They are not what they seem to be. They study that map. [Note the names.] ""There ain't no Santa Claus."" Can they get that diamond without any trouble? [Then it wouldn't be funny.] I heard that cats are supposed to taste like rabbits, and dogs taste like pork.

Sing a Song of Six Pants, 1947
The boys have a tailor shop with new and second hand clothes. They get a bill for overdue tailoring equipment. The radio tells of a reward for a robber. Curly gets a spot out of clothes.

Later that man returns to his flat. Moe finds a paper in those pants. A customer gets brushed off. A woman wants her dress dyed, and buys a jacket and slacks.

7906355,4,B00000EZW8,"The Three Stooges Chronicles contains 3 videotapes, each with 3 films. The rare finds are the classic lineup of Larry, Moe & Curly in the pre-Columbia shorts, BEER & PRETZELS, NERSERY RHYMES and PLANE NUTS - these are all with Ted Healy, and that's a shame. Healy brings no humor to the Stooges at all. When he slaps Curly or Larry, you want to jump thru the screen and smack this guy in the head with a shovel. At least when Moe slapped the others, you know he at least CARED for them in his heart! Healy shows none of that in any of the films he did with the Stooges. Of course, this is only my opinion. Healy was a hack that couldn't cut it on his own, and it was proved when the Stooges escaped from this no-talent and succeeded on their own without him....but hey - these are rare Stooge films and ya gotta get 'em if you collect 'em. There are also a few Curly and Shemp solo films and the remaining 3 films are Stooge shorts that have been released over and over and over again, ad nauseum.  But the remaining 6 films are worth getting this collection. If it weren't for Healy, I'd give it 5 stars instead of 4.",984182400,5,1118,4.175925925925926
