8142441,4,B000HXDWYG,"A teenager orphan girl, Jennifer ran away from a whore house.  She was cross-dressing as a boy Frank, in this escape.  Lucky to her, she was picked up and adopted by a French nobleman.  Her face and body could no way deceive her master for long.  Although this wealthy man had a girl friend in London, he also kept Jenny as his sexual playmate.  Whipping, piano playing, candle lighting romance, full frontal nudity and ...  These
love and torture scenes are all soft core today.
However, this erotica was set in the 18th century.  Passion of love - giving or receiving - was the focus of this wonderful movie.",1482278400,,610,4.541284403669724
8142442,3,B000HXDWYG,"Man who owns manor meets a young boy along the road. Guy has plucked eyebrows, long lashes, full lips and a bubble butt. OMG! It's really a girl! Didn't see that coming!  Guy makes ""him"" his girlfriend and also has one in London. Get flashback of girl's life at a brothel for more sex and nudity scenes.

Full frontal nudity of Jennifer Inch would be the only real reason to watch this film. About as much as a romance as ""The Story of O."" Yeah, there's some there, but I can't imagine that is why one would watch it.  3 stars for Inch parading around in birthday suit.

8142446,5,B000HXDWYG,"This elegantly produced film set in the late 1800's features the lovely Jennifer Inch as a 16-year old orphan girl running away from a bordello where she had been sent, disguised as a boy. She is found by a wealthy landowner who takes her in while continuing to be duped by the disguise. That is totally incongruous, there is no way Jennifer Inch could be confused with a boy, as we shall clearly see as the movie moves on. When the truth is discovered, a romance is kindled, and you will recognize the rest of the plot from Pygmalion. The lavish settings and costumes--and lack thereof in some cases--coupled with good acting, make this a good bet.",1351728000,3,649,4.555555555555555
8142447,2,B000HXDWYG,"This is a pretty bad movie. Basically it's a kind of historical soft porn, set in some vague time between maybe 1780 and 1900 (and towards the earlier, I think) - I can almost hear some brainless enthusiast saying ""You know, the olden days..""

Others have commented on the ridiculous plot, where the young woman dressed as a boy wouldn't fool anyone with normal vision. The face alone is totally feminine, never mind any other imperfectly concealed geographical features.

And I don't even remember what the erotic episodes looked like!  Had to resort to fast-forward in the more boring parts.

So why two stars instead of one? Because there are some really attractive scene settings, quite enjoyable to look at, and for anyone who likes elegant clothes, the men's wardrobes are a treat! Sometimes I wish we could dress like that today. Of course, it implies a large servant class to track of all the different items - the vests, cravats, lace, ruffles, buckles, etc etc. not to mention the perpetual cleaning and ironing. Also, you'd want to be a person not harried by the pressure of time, since you would not get dressed in the time it takes you today to pull on a pair of Dockers and a polo shirt.

As you may have gathered, I am one who somewhat regrets the spread of ""business casual"" in the office. Not one of those who harbor a deep animosity against that pleasantly colorful item, the tie. I have 30+ hanging in my closet that never see any use...seems like a waste. Oh well.

If this review seems to have rambled rather far from its subject, it's simply because there isn't much there to write about!",1230336000,4,1610,4.611888111888112
8142448,3,B000HXDWYG,"The Victorian novel this flick was based on was better done, and the central theme, of the main character's ""love of the rod"" was played down, but it was pretty, and the actresses beautiful, certainly. In fact, when the character of Frances was presented as a woman, she looks exactly like a sober Britney Spears (though the film was shot about the time Ms. Spears was born.)",1197158400,3,375,4.611940298507463
8142449,1,B000HXDWYG,A brainless T&A flick that demeans women.  See-through plot devoid of motivation.,1164758400,4,81,5.75
8142450,5,B000HXDWYG,"The novel on which this movie is based is widely regarded as a classic of Victorian erotica, which mostly seems to be focused on whipping, with other activities as a sideline rather than the main course.

This movie, on the other hand, qualifies as the modern term ""romantica"" - romantic erotica. Jennifer Inch shines as ""Frank."" New to the world and shy, we get to watch this young lady as she discovers the joys and sorrows of being a woman and finally arriving at love with a man who cherishes her. Jennifer is charming and beautiful, making every scene she's in a delight.

This is a ""couples movie"" without a doubt. The ladies will appreciate the growing regard ""Frank"" and Charles develop for each other, and their menfolk will enjoy the ""skinemax."" I'm absolutely thrilled this one is finally out on a superb quality transfer to DVD.",1163635200,27,840,4.707482993197279
