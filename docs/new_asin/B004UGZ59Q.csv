8441531,5,B004UGZ59Q,Fun Flick. I think Turfseer missed some of the political humor and inside jokes. Having lived in Israel and speaking some Hebrew will make this way funnier than if you totally rely on the subtitles...I used it to practice Hebrew. Great fun.,1410307200,,240,4.738095238095238

Caught this Israeli Biblical spoof at the 25th Annual Israel Film Festival. It's in the tradition of Monty Python's farcical ""Life of Brian"" but here the focus is on an 'Old Testament' tale, the story of Lot. The story is filled with many anachronistic elements. We begin with God who is dressed like an insurance salesman carrying a briefcase which doubles as a TV monitor and a device capable of causing a nuclear -like explosion (the briefcase features an LCD timer, connoting the hours and minutes to Sodom's eventual destruction). God pays a visit to Abraham who he demands accept the offer to become the founder of the new one-God Jewish religion. Abraham bargains with God, insisting that he must save the city of Sodom's only righteous man, Lot. God sends two goofy motorcycle driving security agents to Sodom in order to extricate Lot before the city blows up.

We meet Lot who's a lottery ticket vendor in the central marketplace. His goal is to sell enough tickets to open up a community center. The evil Mayor of Sodom wants to clear out all the vendors so he can have real estate developers build fancy condos at the location. When Lot is brought before the Mayor and he refuses to give up his booth, he pricks Lot's big toe and then 'tortures' him by dumping him continuously in salt water. Soon, the Mayor gets wind of God's plan and decides to switch places with Lot, hoping that when God's security people find him at Lot's house, he'll be the one who is saved when the city is destroyed.

In the mix is Tal Friedman, a male actor who plays Lot's wife. She's a one joke character who wants to revive her singing career (we get to view snatches of her inept music video from her 'younger' days) and she's later set upon by Sodomites when she attempts to belt out the tune at her daughter's wedding to Prince Ninveh, the Mayor's lovestruck elder son. Ninveh's comic claim to fame is that he's lactose intolerant and he goes to great lengths to win the heart of Lot's daughter who is often seen singing mawkish Israeli pop tunes.

I can't say that there are really any 'laugh out loud' moments in 'This is Sodom', but there are a few amusing bits. For example, God flips through TV shows on his briefcase, cuddled up next to a goat. One of the shows is an American Idol takeoff featuring a contest for Israel's top eunuch. Another amusing scene which features more black humor than straight out farce, is when Lot's wife attempts to select a 'human sacrifice' for her daughter's upcoming wedding. The store salesman tries to dissuade her from selecting various candidates, primarily because they either take too long or too short a time to burn to death. Lot's wife ends up selecting the God's newly imprisoned security people who are then escorted through the city encased in plastic wrap.

Not all of the bits are that funny including one of the security guard's obsession in filming a documentary of their travails. In the end, 'This is Sodom' scores points not as much for the humor but its irreverence and generally being good-natured. Instead of God actually destroying Sodom, he merely causes a big fireworks display (although we're led to believe that a nuclear-like explosion has taken place). Even better is that our good guy hero Lot survives and becomes the permanent mayor of Sodom. The bad guy Mayor along with Lot's wife get to leave the city (before the mock explosion) and of course Lot's wife can't resist turning back and looking at the explosion despite being explicitly ordered not to by God. Instead of turning into a pillar of salt, a large rock formation breaks off and squishes her. The evil Mayor begs to be taken in at Abraham's door and the Patriarch tells him there's always room for more applicants in the tribe. The final exterior shot of Abraham's tent implies that the Mayor undergoes the pain of circumcision so that his wish not to be left alone in the desert, is fulfilled.

The main object of 'This is Sodom's' satire is pop culture, exemplified by the TV shows and music video takeoffs interspersed throughout the narrative. Those who are enamored more with slapstick type farce and straight out black humor, 'This is Sodom' will probably be your thing. For those looking for a deeper satiric, political edge, you might come away a bit disappointed.",1305331200,,4343,4.692913385826771
