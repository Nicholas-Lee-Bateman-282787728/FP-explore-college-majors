4405185,4,B004LWJ6RG,"This movie was fun to watch from beginning to end. I haven't seen any of the cartoons yet, so I couldn't compare it. This is a perfect summer movie, and clean fun for the whole family. Yogi and Boo Boo are adorable and hilarious. They live in Jellystone Park and often cause trouble for Ranger Smith when they try to steal pic-a-nic baskets. When Mayor Brown orders Jellystone to shut down, it's up to our heroes to stop him. Along the way, Ranger Smith falls for a woman named Rachel who happens to be a documentary filmmaker. I highly recommend YOGI BEAR!!!",1292976000,2,559,4.490196078431373

4405206,5,B004LWJ6RG,"First I will start by saying that I never give spoilers in any of my movie reviews. I keep it simple and say whether it is good or not.

I pretty much purchased this movie just to add another 3D title to my movie collection. So needless to say I had it for quite a while before ever viewing it. However after viewing this movie, We wish we had watched it sooner! Our entire family found the movie very well done. The story line was whimsical and at times a real treat. I would consider this to be a great movie for the ENTIRE family, including the very young ones.

 The 3D was done very well. I have seen better, but this by no means was poor. There where a few times when the 3D was a little underwhelming and I may have noticed a slight ghosting here and there but all in all a pretty decent 3D rendering is what you can expect. Please keep on mind that not all 3D Televisions are made the same and some 3D TV's just aren't any good at 3D - period. Luckily we have a good 65"" 3D TV that does a tremendous job at rendering a great 3D image. So when a great 3D movie is played on our television, it is a very special treat as we can expect it to play just as good as any theatre can provide us. So you can trust my advice when I say that this 3D movie is a good one

I will sum this review up with this advice. If you are at all on the fence about whether you should buy this movie or not, I would suggest you do, and enjoy it.

4405256,4,B004LWJ6RG,"I'm amazed at how critical people are sometimes. This is not Citizen Kane. The plot is clich and paper thin. You pretty much see what's coming in each scene. There's no deep message or surprise ending. It's meant to be light, family friendly fluff.

I loved the cartoon as a kid in the 70's. I was very wary of this when it came out. I was afraid we were going to see a new, modern, snarky, cynical Yogi to fit in with how so many other ""family"" movies are written these days. However, I thought they did a nice job generally staying true to the original, simple, 1960's era persona that the cartoon Yogi had. Everything is simplified enough so that younger kids can follow. The movie felt like it kept a brisk enough pace that it never got overly slow. It kept our 7 year old's attention the entire time, and gave me a few chuckles too.

I'm sure the kids will want to watch it again, and since it's made for kids, and my kids liked it, that's good enough for me to give it a thumbs up.",1451433600,,987,4.189473684210526

4405266,4,B004LWJ6RG,"Live-Action / CGI hybrids are a dime a dozen.  While technically all movies these days use both live-action and CGI, this term is used to describe films in which main characters are played by both live actors and voice actors on CGI creatures.  This kind of film is generally frowned upon, as they're most of the time a cheap way to release a known-franchise cash-in film for kids with very little work and lots of revenue.  These films are generally based on old cartoons, in order to attract more people using the nostalgia factor.

Yogi Bear is one of those films, and it just might be the exception.  Sure, it's a comitee-made film by executives who just want a quick buck by spending little, but there's no denying that at least part of the production and filming team intended to actually entertain their audience.

The film, based on the eponymous old Hanna-Barbera cartoon, follows the adventures of the eponymous antropomorphized bear, who spends his life in Jellystone Park with his friend the, um, height-challenged Boo Boo, stealing pic-a-nic baskets from unsuspecting visitors and generally making Park Ranger Smith's life a pandemonium, even as he tries to woo Rachel, a naturist who's studying the park.  As the story progresses, the unnamed city's Mayor Brown has bankrupted the city and decides to sell the park to make a quick buck and help his campaign for Governor.  So Yogi and Ranger Smith are forced to put aside their differences and work together in order to save the park, which you'll recognize as the plot you instantly thought of the moment a Yogi Bear movie was announced.

Yes, the plot is generic to the core, as these movies go, but this one has the bright idea of sidetracking the main plot in order to focus on the details, where it shines.  Unlike, say, The Smurfs, this movie doesn't feel the need to unnecessarily change the locale to the big city, instead focusing most of its time in the park, so you'll be treated to beautiful visuals.  Unlike Garfield, this film doesn't change the characters' personalities to fit cliches, so they have to work the plot in their favor and not the other way around.  And, unlike other films of this style, this doesn't turn into a potty-humor-fest, despite having ample opportunity to do so (I'm still amazed that no one farts here, even the 2014 TMNT film did that).  Also, the resolution doesn't rely on Deus Ex Machinas or ""forgetting"" previous problems.  The film actually does a good job of correctly establishing everything.

Another important thing is that this film has genuinely funny moments.  Sure, there's a lot of slapstick around, but for the most part is not forced or annoying, or simplistic (no crotch kicks, for instance).  This is actually a very good adaptation of the original show.  Granted, such a thing isn't HARD to do, but notice how pretty much every other film in this style completely fails at this simple task by unnecessarily introducing changes that do more harm than good.

This film manages to be funny without insulting the audience, and it does so in part because of the writing, and in part because of the cast.  Dan Aykroyd plays Yogi and Justin Timberlake plays Boo Boo.  Timberlake does a pretty impressive job, but Aykroyd sounds less like Yogi and more like, well, Dan Aykroyd doing a Yogi impression.  You get used to it in the course of the film, but it's a bit off-putting at first.  That being said, they both manage to give emotion to their characters.  Ranger Smith is played by Tom Cavanagh (aka Dr. Harrison Wells in The Flash TV show), and he's definitely the best part of the film.  Props to the filmmaking team for giving a big role to a character that actually had a big role in the source material and not just make ""original"" characters take the spotlight.  His love interest Rachel is played by Anna Faris, who's her usual charming cutie.  Mayor Brown is played by Andrew Daly (you know, that guy who looks like a somewhat squashed Christopher Reeve), and Ranger Smith's second in command, Ranger Jones, is played by TJ Miller, which, like every other character played by TJ Miller... is TJ Miller.

So yeah, the film is hardly original, but it's fun.  It's not life-changing, but it's harmless.  It's corny, but not insulting.  So I recommend it.

Word of advice, though.  If you're getting the Blu-Ray, find the two-disc version.  I got the one-disc version, not realizing there were two, and the extras are a joke.  There's two ""Jellystone Park Jewels"", which are short videos made as if they were instructional videos for park visitors.  They're short but amusing (though I feel there should be more of these).  The other extra is ""Yogi Bear Mashup"", which merges the cast talking about the characters while scenes of the film and show are compared, and you can see where they got their inspiration for many scenes.  It's cute to see actors describing the characters in one short sentence each, and you have to realize if they had more time they wouldn't have anything else to do because, let's face it, those were pretty one-note characters.  Again, short but fun.  There's nothing actually wrong with these extras, but you will have seen everything in less than 10 minutes, maybe even 5.  The two-disc version is the way to go, as it has many more extras, at least according to the box picture.",1445558400,,5332,4.745928338762215

4405354,4,B004LWJ6RG,"My kids really enjoyed this film. Although it's not exactly like the original cartoon, they did a very good job of capturing the likeness of the original characters.

4405355,4,B004LWJ6RG,"After watching about six various 3D Blu Ray discs over the past couple of days, I'm pleased to announce that YOGI BEAR 3D is one of the best (if not THE best) in terms of 3D effects.  The beautiful setting of this movie with all the mountains, rivers, trees, trails, and cabins is really brought to life by the depth quality of the 3D.  Some shots are simply breathtaking.  This is some of the best depth 3D work i've ever seen.  And if you're looking for the pop-out in your face effects, this movie has a fair share of those too.  One scene in particular has a large display of fireworks blowing out of the screen that will make you flinch a time or two.  If you're looking for a nice combo of depth and pop-outs, I would definitely suggest this movie and ""Final Destination 5 in 3D"".

The story of the movie is straight out of a cartoon, but that's part of the fun.  If you are looking for a Live Action version of the Yogi Bear cartoon, you're gonna be very happy with this movie.  If you're not intro Yogi-Bear's goofball antics and silly dialogue, then this probably won't be your cup of tea.  This is a great family movie to enjoy in 3D!",1388448000,3,1144,4.25462962962963

4405361,5,B004LWJ6RG,This is a very good-natured and genuinely funny family comedy with some really enjoyable performances. It does not overstay its welcome nor rely excessively on vulgarity.

4405386,3,B004LWJ6RG,This movie is done well if you are looking for the 'believability' of the interaction between real and computer generated characters.  My 6 yr old liked it ok but it was lost on my 3 yr old.  Probably best for kids 7 and older otherwise you spend half your time explaining the plot.,1372636800,,282,4.30188679245283

4405406,5,B004LWJ6RG,"This is the greatest talking bear comedy of all time, and a cinematic masterpiece of innovation.  The hybrid live action cartoon major motion picture filmed entirely in 3D, it is a triumph of filmmaking.  It has been loved by millions of families worldwide, and it is by far Justin Timberlake's best impression of an actor impersonating Boo Boo.  All of the cast stood out, and each character's arc in an analogy for many of the trials of the human condition that are universal.  I love it.",1365638400,,490,4.662790697674419

Look, it's two animatronic CG bears and a turtle (No, Touche Turtle is not in this one, Hanna Barbera fans), deal with it.

Anyway, it's light entertaining fun. I had a few giggles with the old ""pic-a-nic"" basket lines. Throw in the dopey ""save Jellystone Park's trees"" enviro cause with Anna Faris (who seems to be in every B comedy made) with Tom Cavanaugh (hey, it's Ed!) and it worked for me.

It sounds hokey but it actually came together nicely. The plot doesn't require close attention and it follows the usual dilemmas and resolutions common in the original series.

4405442,5,B004LWJ6RG,"This review is based on having watched the film at home on Blu-ray with my family.

Warner brothers, with Dan Aykroyd voicing Yogi Bear and Justin Timberlake voicing his sidekick Boo Boo, have done a magnificent job of recreating the old Hannah Barbara cartoon series about the rascally bear of ""Jellystone Park."" This 80 minute film is very true to the spirit of the original and had both the adults and children in my family in fits of laughter. The human characters are shown in live action: the animation of Yogi, Boo Boo and special effects is so well done that you have to watch the extras if you want to work out where live action stops and computer generated images begin. Even in High Definition I couldn't see the joins.

The film starts with Yogi up to his usual tricks which will be familiar to anyone who watched the original, trying to steal ""pic-a-nic baskets"" from the visitors to the park, with the head ranger (Tom Cavanagh) trying to stop him. Shortly thereafter a wildlife film maker, Rachel Johnson (Anna Faris) arrives, wanting to film the unusual creatures who live at Jellystone. And then a cartoonishly evil politician, Mayor and Gubernatorial candidate Brown (Andrew Daly) comes up with a plot to close Jellystone and cut down all the trees. It will need all of Yogi's daft ingenuity and the efforts of the Ranger and Rachel working together to save the park ...

Even more than the original this film is silly but exceptionally entertaining fantasy. It was like watching a cartoon in live action, and although the film piles layer on layer of impossibilities it was extremely easy to suspend disbelief while watching the film and just enjoy it.

Quality of the visual images was superb, and the acting was excellent. Aykroyd and Timberlake wonderfully brought the talking bears to life, Cavanagh, Faris and T.J. Miller as the assistant ranger were excellent as supporting characters and Daly, with Nathan Corddry as his sycophantic assistant, made an effective villain.

A treat for both present day kids and forty or fiftysomething ""big kids"" reliving their childhood.",1345939200,,2096,4.892957746478873

I get excited to see a movie that we all can enjoy and I especially loved the politician and his assistant.  They were so terrible and the politicians commercial towards the end is hilarious.  A very good spoof on today's politicians and their self serving agendas.  We will definately add this to our collection! BTW Justin Timberlake does a great Boo Boo!",1341446400,,533,4.688172043010753
4405445,3,B004LWJ6RG,"Why do I think that this movie is okay?  Because it is lighthearted, inoffensive stuff.  It really doesn't have a lot to draw on so it is pure slapstick of the doofy kind.  Harmless stuff.  Safe for kids.  Bland for adults.  Except if you're an Anna Faris fan.  I kinda like her.  She's ditzy bland here but I still like her.  The voices of Dan Aykroyd as Yogi and Justin Timberlake as Boo Boo are unplaceable (you probably wouldn't know, and shouldn't know, unless you were told).

The blu-ray has a lot of bonus features, many of which are informational for the younguns and there are several games if you're into that sort of thing on your DVDs.  Get this cheap and the value just goes up and up.",1340668800,,699,4.341085271317829

This I think is way better then the couple Yogi films from the 80s, and although I like everything Yogi, they were far from the best of the lot. This film in a HUGE improvement. I actually seen it on the big screen which is a rarity for me. While it was mostly kids in the theatre, I met a couple other old farts like me that went to see if just cause, you know, it's Yogi Bear.

4405454,4,B004LWJ6RG,"Having only watched a few episodes of the original cartoon, I wasn't sure exactly how Hollywood was going to treat Yogi. As it turns out, they actually did a decent job with him.

Pros
- Followed fairly close to the original cartoon. This was evident in the ""Yogi mashup"" which was actually quite entertaining to watch. A 7 minute segment switching between the movie and cartoon series.
- Good story line. Again, nothing blockbuster here, but it could have been much worse
- Corny, funny jokes for all ages. A few snickers for everyone.
- Anna Faris. She is hilarious and added a nice bit of comedy in this role without even really trying.

Cons
- Short. It didn't even hit the 1 20 mark on my DVD player (unless you include credits).
- Some things that were meant to be funny weren't. The limo window is a prime example, although maybe this gag was geared towards a younger audience.
- The rivalry between bear and ranger could have been built up more.

Overall, great family movie that I wouldn't mind watching more than once if the kid(s) liked it.",1327881600,,1051,4.521052631578947

It was fun to enjoy it with my grandchildren since I grew up watching Yogi Bear and Boo Boo cartoons on TV.  It's pretty silly but I didn't expect it to be an epic film.  If you don't have children or grandchildren then you probably wouldn't buy this dvd.  It's a pretty silly but sweet love story featuring the ranger and is based on the need to stop a greedy politician from ruining Jellystone Park.

The animation and live footage did not mix well together, the scenes with both humans and animated bears were obviously fake.  Would have been better as a completely animated/human-less film.  Since its one of the first live action/computer animation mixed film that I remember seeing, I suppose it was a noble attempt that will surely improve with time.

Loved the animation, hated the voices, didn't enjoy the live action(which most of the movie was).  Might be ok for kids.

Movies are supposed to be entertaining, with ups and downs, not boring.  I enjoyed two  scenes--the waterskiing one, jand the flying/turtle scenes, which didn't last nearly long enuf and actually included some excitement.  If the rest  of the movie had been more like the whitewater scenes, it would a been a good movie.

4405481,4,B004LWJ6RG,"Yogi Bear is a pretty good film.  While it's definitely intended for children, adults can enjoy it on a nostalgic level perhaps.  Then again, maybe not.  Do you really feel like you've been missing Yogi Bear all these years?  Nah, didn't think so!

Before going into it, I was asking myself ""How in the world can the writers come up with a storyline that will last 80 minutes?"" and... they somehow do.  They do it by having the plot mostly revolve around the crooked, greedy mayor with his sarcastic demeanor and superiority complex- he takes up about as much space as Yogi does.

Yogi never goes anywhere without his pal Boo Boo (the little adorable bear).

I was also interested in how Yogi and Boo Boo would communicate with the people (not really remembering how it was done in the cartoon- hey it's been at least 15 years since I watched the cartoon).  It turns out the people understand Yogi's voice, but label him as a clueless moron always attempting to steal picnic baskets (and just food overall) but never managing to accomplish it for some reason or another.

On a sidenote, I was almost expecting Yogi Bear to reach major fortune and fame when it was discovered by thousands of people that he's a talking bear which would have transformed the storyline isn't something else entirely, but it never occurred (perhaps an idea for a sequel?)

I find it funny that Yogi constantly gets criticized as an idiot and yet, he has this special talent to create flying devices and other things.  Yeah I'm sure just any ol' person can do that (sarcasm!!)

Anyway, the storyline.  The mayor wants to rip down the forest and make it more like a city park.  This guy is a real jerk- it's all about rolling in the green stuff (money) to him, and nothing else.  It's up to Yogi and Boo Boo (and the Ranger who's just as skinny and dimwitted as I remember) to stop the mayor, save the park, and everyone's happy.

My feelings with the way the storyline develops is that it's slow at first, but as the story moves forward the adventurous aspect takes over (especially when a raft ride down the Yellowstone waterfall segment makes an appearance) and this is when the film finally wins me over.  However this particular scene doesn't come until nearly 50-60 minutes into the movie, which means the first half of the film is mostly occupied with clever attempts at stealing food on the part of Yogi and Boo Boo, or with the mayor continuing forward with his evil, unsympathetic scheme.

Overall, Yogi Bear is pretty good.  A few underwhelming scenes thanks to a slow beginning aside, the rest of the film makes me a supporter.",1316217600,,2616,4.5969827586206895

Well the concept of yogi bear and his side kick booboo (bobo?, whatever...) was fun to revisit. They could have made this a ""MUCH BETTER"" movie by having better actors play the two leading human roles, the park ranger and the girl. Too bad they did not get more well known actors, better actors for the human parts. Dan Aykroyd would have been good for the park ranger, and he could have played both the yogi voice and the human ranger part as well. But beyond poor leading human roles, the movie has great 3D. When they were standing in the water waist deep, you felt like you were in the water too. That was a very good 3D effect. So yes! this movie is worth getting. And more so if you have kids or children. PLUS... almost as good as the movie itself is the bonus feature 3D cartoon THE ROAD RUNNER. Now THAT was a good ROAD RUNNER (beep beep) cartoon. AND IN 3D TOO !!! We never got that at the kiddie saturday movies in our youth, a """"3D"""" road runner cartoon!
I'd love to see more ROAD RUNNER 3D cartoons. Even a movie would be great!

This movie, like other modern family movies, pokes fun at commercialism, big business, politicians, while celebrating the outdoors, conservation, and a can-do attitude.  The special effects are good, as both Yogi and Boo Boo look, move, and sound very real as they interact with the live actors.

There's something about it, that doesnt get old. I have watched it about 15 times and still feel like I'm watching it for the first time, whenever I watch it again. It's like taking a fun trip to Jellystone over and over again.

What's not to like?

The movie is about forever friendship: Yogi and Boo Boo are charming, a great team, and compliment each other better than Abbott/Costello, Cheech/Chong, Laurel/Hardy, etc, and those were great teams.

The movie is about fun and adventure: Yogi and Boo Boo stop at nothing to swipe a pic-a-nic basket. If they have to fly, they will. If they have to hook up pic-a-nic tables themselves, to a vehicle and get the baskets that way, they'll do it.

They never give up, and there's a good natured lesson to be learned there.

The film is full of scenes of a sunshine filled Jellystone Park, it is a happy movie, a movie meant to entertain and provide fun to the audience and it hits a home run in doing that.

 The scene where Yogi and Boo Boo dance and shake their groove things: Cute and Great.

 The fireworks scene: Hilarious.

The ""limo window challenged"" Mayor: A riot.

  The so called movie ""critics"" and less than stellar box office numbers notwithstanding, this is a great movie that the whole family will love.

It brings Yogi and Boo Boo to life like never before, and I love this movie more than the cartoons.

I hope there will be more movies.

 Throw in a nerdy but funny Mr. Ranger and a funny, cute ""Movie lady"" played by the lovable Anna Faris, and what do you have?

 A pic-a-nic basket full of goodies, and dreams that come true.

The visual effects were also pretty good. I've got to be honest, had I had not seen the 3D version I would have likely given this movie 3 or 4 stars. But, the 3D in this movie is pretty amazing.

It was the second movie of 2010 that featured some animated animals and a message about protecting the environment, but it still wasn't as bad as the other movie which WAS the worst movie of 2010 -- ""Furry Vengeance"". Any movie that is so awful throughout AND ends with a lame musical dancing number showing off Brendan Frasier in ill-fitting women's message-on-the-butt pants earns a remarkable level of suckage.

The premise is that two super smart bears who wear accessories like to steal pic-a-nic baskets in Jellystone Park. Head Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh) and Ranger Jones (T.J. Miller) attempt to keep the peace around the park. Anna Faris arrives as Rachel, a documentary filmmaker who wishes to film the bears and serves as Ranger Smith's love interest. Oh no! Enter corrupt Mayor Brown (Andrew Daly) and his Chief of Staff (Nathan Corddry) who are trying to shut down the park! Can the Rangers, Rachel, and the bears team up to make the 100th anniversary awesome and keep the park running? Fat chance. Lucky for them there's a cute turtle involved.

I originally boycotted ""Yogi Bear"" on principle. I loved the cartoon and was afraid to see what would happen to it like with ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"", ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"", ""Garfield"" and other cartoons of my youth (I look forward to the ""Smurfs"" movie with utter dread). This movie? It's pretty lame, feels fake even for an audience of young children, and the only mild enjoyment one can get out of it is, ""Awww, look at how cute the frog-mouthed turtle is!"" This is a cartoon NEVER meant for live action interpretation. A smart bear and his sidekick that steal pic-a-nic baskets? I don't even know anyone that owns a pic-a-nic basket. Just like the other cartoon movies turned live action, this is just taking something successfully established and nostalgic and trying to translate it to a new audience while roping in the old one out of curiosity and doesn't take great care in doing so. Why else would Yogi and Boo Boo dance to ""I Like Big Butts""? It's a one off joke meant to make people laugh but totally doesn't fit with their original characters.

I will give props to Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake for voicing Yogi Bear and Boo Boo because they do sound VERY similar to the original character's voices. I can't fault any of the actors for joining in a poorly written project for a paycheck, but I can blame some of the live action actors for playing down to the audience so far that it never feels honest. Of course, there are challenges in playing to CGI characters that you don't see, but that has never stopped other better films like ""Paul"" from succeeding in that regard.

Christopher Lloyd over at The Film Yap called this movie the worst of last year. I think the only reason it beat out movies like ""Furry Vengeance"" for him is his secret doppleganger, Andrew Daly. Daly's Mayor Brown is a villain so dastardly that he is willing to demolish a protected national park to put in a design your own donut shop or something. I first came across Andrew Daly watching ""Eastbound & Down"" and nearly spit out my food when I saw the resemblance to our friend at the Film Yap! Plus he is a blond villain and Lloyd has spoken out time and time again of the cliche that blond guys are villains and never heroes.

Bonus Features:

A typical animated kids' movie Blu-ray complete with exploration of the Jellystone National Park that leads to interviews with cast and crew members talking about their love for the original cartoon with clips from it (though if I'm being perfectly honest, a few of them look spaced out like they might be on something...).  They talk about how they got the location for the forest, the development of the turtle, working with bears that weren't there, outtakes from a commercial for Mayor Brown, the full song for Rachel, an ad to come visit Jellystone Park, and T.J. Miller's audition with a real bear. I found this animated menu difficult to navigate as an adult and had to keep playing with the arrows to get to the right place on the screen to get back.
Yogi Bear Mash-up is a mash-up of clips from the cartoon, interviews with cast members, and music. The quiz ""Are You Smarter than the average Bear?"" is a matching game where you match foods under plates to put them in the picnic basket before the time runs out. The CG animated Looney Tunes Road Runner cartoon is pretty fun and would have been great to see in 3D.",1300924800,4,4552,4.6041923551171395
4405557,1,B004LWJ6RG,"And my daughter hated this too.  This is rather depressing actually.  I loved `Yogi Bear' as a kid and so I was kind of excited to see they were making a film, but the trailer looked disappointing and so I was weary, but my daughter really wanted to see this and so my wife and I took her.  The film was a complete disaster.  None of the gags land, the humor is so childish it doesn't even remotely come off as funny and the acting is horrendous throughout, especially from the humans.  Anna Faris lacks any and all charisma, Tom Cavanagh is bland and defines `bad acting' and Andrew Daly plays `stock character' like, well, a stock character.  T.J. Miller (a regular on `Chelsea Lately') is funny, but no where near enough to resurrect this DOA.  The plot is generic and the execution is amateurish.  It didn't even make me smile in that awkward `this is so bad it's good' kind of way.  This film is just flat out awful.  Lazy, uninspired and forgettable; `Yogi Bear' is a giant mess.",1300924800,4,985,4.4222222222222225
4405558,4,B004LWJ6RG,"Don't let the 1 Star review from SKAR scare you off from purchasing this movie. While the movie itself is nothing incredible, the 3D Blu Ray looks absolutely incredible. I watched it on a 50"" Panasonic Viera GT25 with my PS3 and this is one of the most eye-popping 3D movies I've had the pleasure of watching from the comfort of my couch. Those of you starved for more 3D Blu's shouldn't hesitate to pick this one up.",1300838400,2,417,4.358974358974359
4405559,4,B004LWJ6RG,Ok good stuff first 3D good not much in your face 3D but good. Ghosting not bad color good story line a little lame but I would still recomend it for the kids. Comes with a roadrunner cartoon takes you back a few years.,1300838400,,219,4.0
4405560,3,B004LWJ6RG,"An evil mayor wants to shut down Jellystone Park for his personal gain.  Ranger Smith and Yogi come up with a plan to save the park.  Going in I was expecting pretty much one of the lamest movies of the year.  It wasn't nearly as bad as I expected.  Although this is geared toward kids and is extremely predictable it does have enough funny parts in it to keep adults entertained (an 80 min run-time helps).  Much like ""Garfield"" the voice of Yogi (Aykroyd) is a strange choice at first, but after hearing it you can't think of anyone else doing the voice.  As much as I don't want to say it Timberlake, as the voice of Boo-Boo, is actually a really good choice too.  Adults will be able to stand most of it, kids will love it.  I say B-, my kids say A.

Would I watch again? - I wouldn't, my kids did.",1300579200,4,802,4.122580645161291
4405561,5,B004LWJ6RG,"Well made funny movie! Been a fan of the cartoons while growing up and it's nice to know a new generation of kids will get to know Yogi and Boo Boo now!

4405562,5,B004LWJ6RG,"Just as I expected. Yogi takes me back many many years ago. More of a fan of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Road Runner, Tom and Jerry, ...but I also did like to watch Yogi Bear. With his wise cracks, and friend Boo-Boo. This movie did not disappoint. CGI has become so incredibly good, the characters are so so so real. Watched it with the family. There are many fun scenes. We had good laughs from start to end. Especially our 6 year old son enjoyed it immensely. I think it's more appealing to the young ones (5 to 8?) but the whole family will enjoy this movie.",1298592000,2,558,4.224299065420561
4405563,5,B004LWJ6RG,"Yogi Bear is a fun and corny kids movie. I never really watched the show, I've seen an episode or two but that's it. The main reason I saw this was because Anna Faris was one of the main actors in the movie. I love all Anna Faris movies so I knew this one was going to be a good one. I thought this movie was actually really good. Okay, I know why the movie got bad reviews, but it was awful. I liked it.
I preordered the Blu Ray and it was well worth the money spent.",1298246400,4,468,3.7857142857142856
4405564,5,B004LWJ6RG,I took my 9 year old son to see this movie! But I have to admit that I really liked it also! This movie was funny and very entertaining! I expected it not to be so good but I was proven wrong!,1297987200,2,192,3.5952380952380953
4405565,5,B004LWJ6RG,"Well, I went to an advanced screening of the new Yogi Bear movie and I loved it. It is a very funny film with lots of laugh-out-loud moments. I took my 11 year old son with me and he enjoyed it just as much as I did. As we were leaving the cinema, we were both going back and forth over all the lines from the movie. I think the animators did a great job with Yogi and Boo Boo. Dan Ackroyd did a good job with Yogi and Justin Timberlake was fantastic as Boo Boo. Speaking of the little buddy, in the commercials Boo Boo seems a little smarmy but in the film he is the same ol' Boo Boo that we all know and love. The story line is pretty weak but the antics of Yogi and Boo Boo help make up for it.

As a matter of fact, the weakest part is the human actors. Yogi and Boo Boo were always dead on perfect and funny during their scenes. However, Tom Cavanagh is weak as Ranger Smith. Instead of chasing after Yogi and getting all upset at Yogi's antics, Tom took the opposite approach: Yogi will be Yogi and there's nothing I can do about it. Anna Faris is a good love interest for Ranger Smith. The first twenty minutes of the film, when they are setting up the plot, is the slowest part of the film because it is mostly Cavanagh, Faris and the villain, Mr. Mayor. Once the set up is done, though, it is pure antics and hilarity throughout the rest of the film.

I am very biased because I have been a big Huck and Yogi fan all of my life and it is great to see an H-B character in a big budget film that works. After the film, I turned to the guy next to me (not my son) and said, ""What did you think?"" His reaction was the same as mine that it was a great film and a terrific Yogi Bear movie. Everyone in the theater were laughing uproariously at the film and gave the film a huge applause at the end, so it wasn't just me.

I loathe the three TV films from the 80's (Yogi's Great Escape, Yogi Bear/Spruce Goose and Yogi/Space Bears). They were awful. Yogi's First Christmas is a just a step above these three but not by much. However, this film is probably the best Yogi Bear showing since ""Hey There, It's Yogi Bear"" and this is no exaggeration. I enjoyed every minute and my hat is off to Warner Brothers Pictures for making a terrific Yogi Bear movie.",1297728000,10,2255,4.062921348314607

4405567,4,B004LWJ6RG,"I loved Yogi cartoons when I was a kid, many moons ago. Wasn't sure what they would do to wreck that with an ""updated"" movie. Fortunately, they pretty much stuck to the original formula and produced and thoroughly predictable but thoroughly enjoyable movie.
We took our grandson and I expected to drift off or spend more time concentrating on the popcorn bucket than the actual movie. However, despite a massive headache at the start of the show, halfway through, I was back to the screen and had a great time. The live actors were a vague mystery to me. I have seen them all somewhere, someplace, but couldn't put my finger on who they were. When I got home and looked them up on IMDB, I had that ""aha"" moment. Anna Faris was the most recognizable.

I'll have to give Kudos to Dan Aykroyd as he really nailed Yogi's voice. I'll also give A for effort to Justin Timberlake, who did an admirable if slightly off Boo Boo.

I was able to predict virtually every single scene and event well in advance, yet it didn't bother me at all. I think the filmmakers delivered the spirit of the cartoon show from so long ago.

Wasn't perfect, but still not a bad way to pass time while I ate popcorn. All I know is Baby loved it. Highly recommended for kids and young at heart.",1293494400,18,1264,4.3931623931623935
4405568,3,B004LWJ6RG,"Yogi Bear the Movie is a good movie but not a great one. I would recommend people to see it,but only once. The jokes are kind  of childesh and the story is ok. The Movie is about Yogi Bear and Boo Boo trying to steal pic-a-nic baskets and they always fail. Ranger Smith finds a love in an animal loving girl named Rachel. Rachel films a documentry about Jellystone park. The bad guy of the film is this guy whos running for mayor. He wants to close Jellystone shortly after its 100th anniversery. Jellystone is failing to make alot of money. Ranger Smith has a traine named Ranger Jones who dreams to soon be head Ranger like Smith is. Could Yogi,Boo Boo,Ranger Smith,and Rachel save Jellystone Park or will it close down forever?
