1247602,5,B00001ZWBA,"You need some background in Buddhism to appreciate this series.  I have other films by Robert Thurman and find him captivating. This series is sort of an historical account of Tibetan Buddhism, is not as deep as Thurmans ""Buddhism"" and more centered on why, who and how the Dharma was spread in Tibet.",1005523200,7,301,4.679245283018868
1247603,1,B00001ZWBA,"This ""On Tibet"" should be renamed to ""About Tibet"". If your purpouse is to enjoy beautiful landscapes of Tibet, its religion, buddhism, rituals, sacred places and so on, you'll make a mistake buying this video. ""On Tibet"" is a 4-hour speeches about Tibet, Mr. Thurman standing in fornt of you like a teacher at school. It is boring and if you don't mind it is less expensive to buy an audio cassete or CD. Attention !",982108800,28,417,4.5
7915083,4,B00001ZWBA,"Robert Thurman is infectious when it comes to these topics.  However, even though he knows his stuff and I personally find him extremely entertaining; you might find yourself alone in the TV room after the first twenty minutes.  If that does not bother you, then by all means.

What you will see is a man (Robert Thurman) standing behind a lectern and talking (giving a lecture).  I find the man absolutely fascinating and for me he made the subjects of Buddhism and Tibet alive and vibrant.  But others might not feel the same way; if they are waiting to be entertained by other visuals or action.

The DVD is a rich and wonderful compilation of a vast amount of knowledge on the subject matter; but it is not like watching a History Channel documentary or entertainment TV [so be forewarned].

If you want to dive in deep and discover a wealth of knowledge about Tibet and Buddhism; then this DVD is for you.  I know of no other US based scholar who is more relevant to the Tibetan cause or is more of a leading expert on Tibetan Buddhism.  Robert Thurman is a personal friend of the Dalai Lama and has been for over 40 years.  He is the Jey Tsong Khapa Professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies in the Department of Religion at Columbia University.  He has been ordained a Tibetan Buddhist monk.  His education background includes a B.A.. A.M., and PhD degrees from Harvard and he has also studied in Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in India and the United States.

As a personal aside, his daughter from his second wife is Uma Thurman.

I would highly recommend this collection for those who are sincerely (in a scholarly way) interested in finding out ""a great deal"" about Tibet and Buddhism.

7915084,5,B00001ZWBA,"I rented this from Netflix and wanted to call it my own.  Strictly in lecture format, it is not a scenic movie.

I enjoyed the extensive knowledge given by R. Thurman and appreciate his brilliance and personality as he ""owns"" the material. His enthusiasm is contagious and he seems delighted to share his knowledge with others.

I expect to watch this over and over.",1240876800,,366,4.6875
7915085,3,B00001ZWBA,Very accedemic. Like going to a lecture. Robert does a great job but my family was bored and left the room. I found the information quite interesting. Expect to be educated an not neccessarily entertained.,1218499200,2,205,4.885714285714286
7915086,5,B00001ZWBA,"Three 90 minute tapes. A bargain price for three lectures from a professor from Columbia U NYC.  However, one thing to bear in mind, Thurman has an irreverant sense of humor that people either love or hate.

If you think he is funny, you will find these tapes a wealth of information about the history of Tibet, the arrival of Buddism and its growth there.",1199232000,2,356,4.461538461538462
7915087,5,B00001ZWBA,"I love this DVD and for my kids this new DVD Baby Sambhota Songs! which is so cute.  I have Thurman on my computer and Baby Samhota on the TV for the little ones, Tibetan culture support engaged!",1194393600,,195,4.131578947368421
7915088,5,B00001ZWBA,"What this DVD is:

Robert Thurman standing at a podium lecturing for nearly 8 hours.

That's it!  No pictures or landscapes or anything else.  Just a few cameras pointed at Dr. Thurman as he lectures (at the New York Tibet House, I assume).  Thankfully, the way he talks is enteraining.

If one is casually interested in Tibet or Buddhism, one will want to claw his/her eyes out!
If one has a sincere interest in the above, this is awesome!!

Thurman really knows his stuff.  His language is clear, and not overly academic.  His explanations on Buddha and what is a Buddha etc. are fantastic!  He also does a wonderful job explaning the history of Tibet--no prior knowledge is needed.  Because it is almost 8 hours of lecture, one will need repeat viewings to get everything he says---this is a lot of information!!

Recommended for the serious student, NOT to someone with a mild interest.",1189987200,4,890,4.707792207792208
7915089,5,B00001ZWBA,"These are lectures at the The Tibet House in New York. To me, Robert Thurman is the finest teacher, either Eastern or Western, that I have ever come across. He loves his subject and he makes it exciting and real.

Tibetan Buddhism is very complex. He does a lot to clarify many of the hardest concepts and brings even greater richness to an already rich tradition.",1174780800,3,364,4.515151515151516
7915090,5,B00001ZWBA,"For what this DVD is - a lecture series, not a documentary, it is truly a great buy.  I bought this to watch with a friend of mine, and she ended up wanting to watch all four hours on Tibet in a single afternoon!  We did just that, and didn't get bored once (although we did have to use the ""pause"" button to go to the bathroom!)

Professor Thurman is a very knowledgeable man, and it is amazing to watch him rattle off a two-hour lecture while hardly ever referring to any notes.  I know my friend was somewhat disappointed that there weren't any pictures of Tibet in the lecture, and maybe Professor Thurman might consider doing a ""combo plate"" of pictures and lecture at some later date. All in all, excellent if you are interested in learning about Buddhism in general (obviously Professor Thurman's major interest is with Tibetan Buddhism), or about the history of Tibet.",1143417600,13,876,4.560509554140127
7915091,4,B00001ZWBA,"Robert Thurman is passionate about tibet and buddhism and it shows.  He is easy to listen to, articulate and intelligent.  He has so much information in his head and I wish he had fleshed out his myriad of diatribes.  He often veers off telling a great side story and then stops himself to stay on point.  It's a big tease as I would like to hear the rest of the story! (most likely he was pressed for time as this was a live lecture) I hope he puts together a more in depth dvd series such as a set of 12 or 24 (hehe) but in the mean time this set is definitely worth owning.",1125705600,20,576,3.982608695652174
7915092,5,B00001ZWBA,"There is so much information in this DVD that I am sorry for the actual persons at the lecture.  The DVD is great because you can listen to it many times. Each time you pick up more and more and finally you realize what an incredible journey he takes you through.  Robert is a wonderful lecturer, funny, happy, and has a lot to give.  It is one of the definite best buys.",1081036800,40,371,4.125
