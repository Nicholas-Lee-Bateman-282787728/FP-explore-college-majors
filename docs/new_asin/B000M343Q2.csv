* This is an awesome video for everyone who loves snowboarding or skiing
* The characters in the movie make it fun to watch and I keep wishing the movie was longer!
* The movie is edited very well with a good amount of funny, scary, pretty and awesome sceenes.
* The jumps and tricks that the snowboarders in the movie perform are stunning, I wish I was as good as they are!
* Don't miss the additional scenes in the DVD option. They are as fun and are at least 5-10 min each!

The annoying:
* The movie is not in High Definition as I expected. Some scenes would be so much more beautiful and effective if only this was in HD.
* When you play the movie, the japanese captions turn on automatically, and it takes a bit of time to turn them off (didn't know I was buying a Japanese version).

I bought it as a gift and we all watched it together! Amazing inspiration! Would buy again!",1330560000,,892,4.1502890173410405
