4261113,5,B0044FEZBM,"This ballet is somewhere between classical ballet and folk dancig. The costumes are theatrical clothes accordng to the charecters. This ballet is from the Soviet era about the french revolution and it has been reconstructed in order to reduce the political agenda and add love stories. The sound and image are very good. The dances are partly classical and partly folk dancing. Celebrating their love affair, the principal dancers had out of this world performance near the end of this ballet. What bothers here is the frequent audience shouts and applauds that disturb the dancers.",1299974400,2,582,5.136842105263158
4261114,4,B0044FEZBM,"Bolshoi Ballet - Flames of Paris

To break it down into simplest terms, this is a beautiful and exciting ballet, and with Vasiliev and Osipova in the starring roles, there is really no way you can go wrong.

As a ballet, Ratmansky's choreography combines the best elements of contemporary and classical into one. At first glance, you won't notice really any contemporary elements in the ballet; the dancers are all in classical costumes, girls in pointe shoes, and men performing their typical feats of virtuosity. However, the pace of the ballet is moved along significantly by the flow of scenes from one to the next. In the first half of the ballet, there are no divertissements, no grande pas de deux, no time consuming entrees or variations. Everything flows quickly, moving the story along and creating a clear exposition.

The only possible flaw in Ratmansky's beautiful and sweeping choreography is the loss of pace in the second half of the ballet. After experiencing the torrential whirlwind of movement in the first half, it's a bit surprising to see things slow down after intermission. However, the divertissements are so brilliantly danced and choreographed that it seems almost a crime to dislike the change.

Natalia Osipova, petite pistol of the Bolshoi, is made for the role of Jeanne. Her dynamo technique and absolutely unrestrained passion convince the viewer immediately that she is indeed a strong peasant girl with the fires of youth burning brightly. Any entrance Osipova makes onto the scene is immediately noticeable; beyond her incredible jumps and technique, she emits a magnetism that is difficult--if not impossible--to ignore. Her technique shines brightest in the final act's grande pas de deux; Osipova seems to not only match, but outshine her partner's incredible jumps. My only regret is that we do not see more of Osipova in the ballet. Granted, ballets ought not be transformed to be vehicles for star; but I found myself wanting more of Jeanne.

Lead ballerina aside, the other three stars of this production do a fantastic job of displaying a smoothness and plasticity of technique and pulling you into their stories. Denis Savin plays the fragile and emotional Jerome with a tenderness often difficult for male dancers to portray. Nina Kaptsova matches him beautifully, and the love story between Jerome and Adeline is, as a relationship, more interesting than that of Jeanne and Phillipe (Osipova and Vasiliev.) Perhaps the scene stealer of this particular production is the nimble and dazzling dancer portraying Armida in the grande divertissement of the party scene. Seldom can a divertissement so long and detailed not feel like an interruption in the story; however, the stunning spectacle of this one makes it one of the brightest and best parts of the ballet. Where Osipova and Vasiliev dazzle with virtuosity, the spirit of Russian ballet and its delicacy and Imperial heritage shine through in the divertissement.

Overall this DVD is one absolutely worth owning for all ballet lovers and watchers. It is also, in my opinion, a fantastic way to introduce someone to ballet. The story is bright and quick, the dancing exciting, and the setting well known.",1299542400,22,3205,5.106870229007634
4261115,3,B0044FEZBM,The dancing is very good in particular the pdds. The staging was only so-so; mainly mobscenes. Also was not very keen on the storyline.,1298246400,,135,4.666666666666667
4261116,5,B0044FEZBM,"I first saw this performance in a local theater, then kept searching for a BD version of it until it appeared on amazon.uk, then waited months until it finally made it to amazon.com in the States. Why? Because the lead ballerina's technique is totally amazing - so fast and precise that her performance needs to be seen to be believed. Most dancers visibly initiate movements and end them; she seems to avoid these transitional phases, going apparently instantly from one position or path of motion to another without those visible connecting moments of acceleration and deceleration.

As a former amateur male dancer (primarily ballet) wih martial arts training, who performed in minor roles with local and sometimes visiting professional companies, I seldom have any interest in watching male dance technique. However, I found myself intently watching the lead danseur in this performance - he's that good.

The sumptious staging of this ballet and the high skill level of the entire company are apparent in this performance, but not unexpected of the Bolshoi company, trained as it is in the classical Russian Vaganova technique. Still, it is very pleasing to see such precise limb placement, without the sacrifice of beauty of form for speed of movement that accompanies so much of the Balanchine technique.

This is by far and away my favorite ballet recording, so much so that I bought a second copy as a gift for my local professional ballet company so that their dancers, choreographer and staff also could appreciate the performance.",1298246400,16,1542,5.086956521739131
4261117,3,B0044FEZBM,"Alexey Ratmansky managed to re-vitalize an old Socialist propaganda ballet. His choreography builds on classic steps and has enough bravura to show the spectacular technique of the dancers yet it looks modern, with intriguing characterization. The story is still a bit much about the revolutionary masses to my taste, though a love story between a young aristocratic girl a peasant boy, improbable as it is in historical context, adds a lot of lyricism.  Dancers are great in typical Bolshoi style: bombastic and lacking in nuance and restrain ( with some exception), but with spectacular technique bordering on acrobatics.
Ballet is also well filmed: dancers shown full lengths so one can appreciate the dancing, just like Fred Astaire who insisted on being filmed in full height in his dancing sequences. It is overall a delightful Blu-Ray.",1298073600,4,842,5.237037037037037
4261118,5,B0044FEZBM,"The wait is finally over.  Natalia Osipova is, at long last, the featured performer in a full length ballet that has made it to DVD. For those of us who haven't been able to make it to New York, or Europe--to see her in real life--this is cause for celebration, and it's not likely that many will be disappointed.  The Flames of Paris is quintessentially Russian, although, of course, it utilizes the French Revolution of 1789 as an exemplary reflection of its 1917 Russian equivalent;  apparently, the ballet was a favorite of Stalin's (ugh).

Be that as it may, the brilliant young Ukrainian choreographer, Alexei Ratmansky, has put a fresh stamp on the storyline, and his creative flair, coupled with the ensemble dances (especially in Act II) that have been retained from the original 1932 Soviet production (choreographed by V. Vaynonen) give the ballet a powerful vitality that should propel it onto more stages around the world.

Some of this version's solos, especially by the daring Ivan Vasiliev, are astonishing, and the thoroughly rousing rendition of this balletic example of social/political realism has a very strong heartbeat, highlighted by Osipova's dynamic presence.

[For what it's worth, I recently ordered the ballet from Amazon uk (before I knew that it was going to have a U.S. distribution), and paid (for the standard DVD) more than it would cost to get the Bluray here in the U.S..  As you would expect, the BD's video (and audio) is clearly superior to the DVD.  I would also note that because of my enthusiasm (sparked by youtube) for Osipova, I also ordered a set of three DVDs from OsipovaBallet, which it turns out had some of the choreography done by her, but does not feature much of her, except for a couple of youtube-like clips].",1295308800,5,1766,4.863333333333333

4261120,5,B0044FEZBM,"This is not really a review. There is nothing to review. This is a great buy. It is more of a message towards the visual arts companies, theaters, ballet companies and maybe Ivan Vasiliev himself. Ladies and gentlemen, do you realise that this Ivan Vasiliev guy  is ARGUABLY THE GREATEST DANCER we have seen since the times of Nureyev and Barishnikov?????? I watched him on You Tube on the advice of a friend and I said to myself ""What the hell is this???"". I was speechless. And then I decided to enter the Amazon site and buy everything that there is on him and with him. AND I FIND JUST THIS!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS??? Give this guy and us a SPARTACUS, a CORSAIRE, a DON QUICHOTE, a LA BAYADERE. AND FILM HIM FOR GOODNESS' SAKE! ON BLU RAY! I hope you realise your responsibilities towards the public and the art of ballet itself.

4261122,5,B0044FEZBM,"This new remake of Flames of Paris is near perfect.
The changed story adds a better dimension of the humanity part of the French Revolution.

4261123,5,B0044FEZBM,"I knew nothing about The Flames of Paris but considered that any performance by the Bolshoi should be good.  I was right.  The story, set during the French Revolution, is strong and the music enjoyable and commonly better than that, very dramatic at times.  One number gets stuck in my mind for hours.  But were the costumes quite authentic?  No sans culottes except for performers in two classical Greek interludes!  Variety is also provided by some folk dances.  The dancing is superb, especially in several numbers near the end, and scenes of rampaging revolutionary mobs were very well done.  I'm glad I bought it - I recommend it to all ballet lovers.",1364342400,3,656,4.794642857142857
4261124,5,B0044FEZBM,"I saw this ballet for the first time at our local ""Opera Club"". I found the production to be delightful and the dancing is tops.  I am so glad that more and more Bolshoi Ballet performances are starting to be distributed and shown at small town venues.  The series ""Ballet in Cinema"" from Emerging Pictures is facilitating this process; I wish their productions were made available for purchase shortly after they have had their theaters run.",1362873600,,442,4.802631578947368
4261125,3,B0044FEZBM,"The amazing, heart pounding sound from the strong orchestra will send shivering to your spine.

The dance is fast paced and full of energy, with amazing precision, dazzling jumps and endless whirlwind twisting. It can't get any better on the technical part.

With that being said, sometimes I felt the pace is uneven, the ballroom dance is, frankly, quite boring.

Natalia Osipova is such a strong character, she is confident, decisive, sometimes I feel that part is little overdone. She definitely looks like a dancing machine, instead of a human! In some dances she jumped ahead of the partner. I wish she has more opportunity to show more emotional skills.

Comparing to Natalia, Nina Kaptsova is very delicate, and I find she shows the deep emotion beautifully. She also did a fantastic job in the Nutcracker performance.

I do wish they put a bigger picture of Natalia on the cover, as Natalia is as good as Ivan.",1361491200,5,918,4.821656050955414
4261126,5,B0044FEZBM,"Outstanding. Natalia Osipova is right at the top of her game and an absolute joy to watch. Despite her stealing the show the corps de ballet and other principals are by no means overshadowed. Ivan Vasiliev also performed magnificently and the pair were perfectly matched.
The story of the French Revolution is well told in dance and the haunting music so evocative of the time and place. Folk tunes are picked up and of course La Marseillaise is showcased.
This will appeal to all, both newcommer and connoisseur alike. An outstanding example of the genre.
Budding dancers can learn a lot from examining the finer detail and the bonus section interviews are riveting.",1350172800,,667,4.911504424778761
4261127,4,B0044FEZBM,"This issue continues the recent series of new Bolshoi Ballet recordings now available in high definition and Blu-ray. This follows a gap of a few years of refurbishment and where recordings have not been made. Suffice it to say that the Bolshoi Ballet has returned on very top form with interesting new productions as well as items of more traditional fare.

The current issue is set at the time of the French Revolution and is essentially a story of love formed on either side of the political divide and of human sacrifice in the name of love.

There can be no doubt about the mastery of the dancing in this production which is a technical 'tour de force'. The quality of the setting is also effective and makes good use of the large expanses of stage to create spectacle and a strong sense of speed. I personally find the music serviceable rather than of great note - not in the class of Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky or Prokofiev for example to name but three of Russian lineage. It is for these musical considerations rather than those of dance that I have withheld the fifth star. Clearly ballet has to be seen as a whole art form bringing together an amalgamation of dance, music and staging to create a total experience and a reviewer must therefore consider all of these factors when deciding upon a fair grading and this I have attempted to do.

Nevertheless, and regardless of the above, it is likely that this issue will be of particular interest to those who are interested in the extraordinarily athletic abilities of the Russian superstar dancer, Ivan Vasiliev. Allegedly he is known to almost fly and indeed he does seem to defy gravity. There is little to add except that he fully lives up to his reputation and will not disappoint. The other three star dancers, Natalia Osipova as Jeanne, Denis Savin as Jerome and Nina Kaptsova are all fine dancers in their own right and the four stars make an impressive team. The corps de ballet are all that one would expect from the revitalised Bolshoi and the supporting solo roles are also good. This is a very impressively danced ballet which is presented with excellent costumes and sets in the finest of Russian traditions.

There is an interesting 21 minute bonus featuring interviews, rehearsal sequences and some historical information presented by the choreographer, Ratmansky and the two main dancers, Vasiliev and Osipova. This has subtitles to help with the rehearsal sequences and the dancers however Ratmansky speaks fluent English during his interview extracts.

The Blu-ray recording is very successful and delivers crisp and detailed imaging without motion blur even at times of fast action. There is a fine DTS surround sound option supplied as well as stereo. The extra bonus is in the form of 21 minutes of interviews and rehearsal extracts featuring the choreographer Ratmansky and the fine two leading dancers, Osipova and Vasiliev.

So in my opinion this earns a clear 5 stars for the dancing, much of which is spectacular, coupled with a fine production which is recorded well and generous bonus. My doubts about the long-term quality of the music is the reason for the reduced level to 4 stars. This is a personal response however and those with more dance-based priorities may well prefer a higher overall grade than me.",1342742400,2,3297,4.836879432624113
4261128,5,B0044FEZBM,"As my previous colleagues have gone into some depth with their respective reviews, I will keep this short & sweet.
A wonderful concept for a Ballet to start with and brilliantly danced. The staging was brilliant & scene changes were smooth & effortless.
The music was a little too repetitive I felt, I could hear the same themes returning many times through the piece. But in hole a good score.
The dancing & choreography  were out of this world not to mention the soloists.
Natalia Osipova & Ivan Vasiliev were brilliant in their respective solos & pas de deux's. Vasiliev just tore up the floor with his athleticism & the height of his elevations. I have to agree that the second half dropped a little pace & I felt that the story-line wandered a little, which probably didn't help. But! Overall a brilliant ballet danced to perfection.
For ballet lovers out there, grab it, you won't be disappointed.",1309564800,6,903,4.715189873417722

8416087,3,B0044FEZBM,"This production has been performed by numerous Russian casts, and the present one by husband and wife Ivan Vasiliev and Natlia Osipova was chosen for video release.
Flames of Paris is not a love story. So it may justify that the leads are dancing more as acrobats than traditional ballet dancers.
On this basis, it appears that Vasiliev and Osipova are ideal choices.  But this is ONLY when you have not seen other Bolshoi versions.
Vasiliev is about the same age as the other Russian principal Vlaidslav Lantratov.  However, I would wie for the latter as Philippe than Ivan owing to the fact that Lantratov owns a better (much cleaner) style of dancing.
When the story plot is simple and the show belongs almost wholly to dancing, lack of elegance in movements can be magnified. I do not mean to ay that Osipova or Vailiev are not top dancers.  They both are, but watching this production as performed by them makes my unsatisfied: as and when the Basque dance was being done, what were on the minds of these two top leads?  They seemed, both, to have been engaged in a robotic sort of hyper-enegery movement.  Savin is better, dancing with a soul. THE MUCH MIORE SOULFUL AND ELEGANT  Kaptsova simply could not fit in the style of Osipova and Vasiliev's compulsive robotic movements.
This is one of the less successful Bolshoi ballet DVDs released in recent years (the other is Sleeping Beauty with Hallberg and Zhakarova).",1434931200,,1424,4.744939271255061

8416089,5,B0044FEZBM,"Ca ira!... let the Rein of Terror begin. This last part of this exceedingly active ballet depiction of a moment in history for tells the sequence of unforeseen events that leads to unforeseen consequences of any revolution; the American less so but the French and Russian more so. This last movement of the crazed, victorious people charging wide-eyed and armed at the audience is fearsome and awe inspiring.  But a truly great moment.
However the real hero of this present production (2010) and reassembly of the Flames of Paris is choreographer Alexei Ratmansky. He has taken the turgid paean of ""art in the service of Socialist causes"" of the Stalin - era 1930s and remade it into a satisfactory love story of two couples (four excellent dancers: Natalia Osipova, Ivan Vasiliev, Denis Savin and Nina Kaptsova). There is also time for scenes of 18th century elegance in the Baroque scenes and dances, a beautiful court-ballet of Armida and Rinaldo and a brief visit by King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. The next act brings on some very athletic regional "" peasant or folk"" dances. Stomping feet let you know this is not classic ballet. Heels and boots and athletic jumps and tosses let you know this also. It is great fun! This allows the dancers of the Bolshoi to show off their athletic prowess. (Osipova and Vasiliev are superb!)  At this point the action becomes serious again. The crowds attack the palace of the monarchy and it is taken. The war is won! But now the madness begins. The people bring in the guillotine. There are betrayals and revenges, symbolized by the old women in black, Jarcasse with the pointing finger, as the strain of evil among the good intensions intensifies. Then the ""Ca ira"" and the rein of terror begins. Great ballet!
The original ballet music was by Boris Asafiev, a favorite of Stalin, is serviceable but mediocre at best. The old choreography of Vasily Vaynonen was interested in emphasizing the revolution had no love story or relief from the political. Both of these were ""remastered"" by the brilliant Ratmansky and the product is a very capable and enjoyable ballet. The final frightening ""Ca ira"" is the original by Vaynonen.",1411776000,,2174,4.857142857142857

I wish there would be more DVDs like this. Natalia Osipova is being acclaimed one of the best ballerinas for five or six years now (only 2 DVDs), Ivan Vasiliev one of the best male dancers for four years (only this DVD!). And Diana Vishneva? And Marcelo Gomes? And so many others? And all the new ballets?
Amazon offers, for example, 1 DVD from ABT (American Ballet Theater) released in 2011, before that ABT has only one that was released in 2004! I'm talking here about the real thing, not the-making-of/the-life-of/the-training-of.
It is sad, because just like me, 99% of the ballet fans - those that live far away from the ten or so big cities where new ballets and great performances happen -, have no other way to see them, except in those terrible jumpy, out-of-focus, two-minutes illegal videos uploaded to the web.
Is it bad business to record ballet? Distribution/tax issues maybe, that raise too much the costs? I payed A LOT of taxes in my country when I imported Flames of Paris - it there were download versions, I could buy more. Still, I would gladly pay it again, and also  whatever price needed to see new ballets from ABT, Bolshoi, Mariinsky, Eifman,...",1409788800,,1419,4.586614173228346
