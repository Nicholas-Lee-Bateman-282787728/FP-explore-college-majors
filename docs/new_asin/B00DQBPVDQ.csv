8596254,5,B00DQBPVDQ,"This two-for-one blu-ray is the best available version of two low budget movies that didn't look or sound that great when they were new: THE DOLL SQUAD (1973), in which an Anita Bryant look-alike leads an all-female assault team against a supervillain who plans to take over the world with plague-infected rats, and MISSION: KILLFAST (1991), in which martial arts master Tiger Yang is forced out of retirement to recover two stolen nuclear detonators.

The Ted V. Mikels signatures are all here: cardboard characters, action scenes filmed in near-total darkness, cheap video ""explosions,"" bad synthesizer music. MISSION: KILLFAST has the added bonus of a totally incomprehensible plot involving a terrorist camp, a softcore porn magazine publisher, a revenge-obsessed daughter, the world's ugliest supermodel, and bad guys who wander in and out of the movie at will, one of them in eyebrows and sideburns so fake you'll be laughing yourself sick. All this and big '80s hair, too! DOLL SQUAD, by contrast, is a model of clarity, albeit silly enough for Cinematic Titanic to lampoon it in their final shows. The villain, played by Michael Ansara as sort of a fey Warren Oates, keeps giving Squad leader Sabrina every opportunity to kill him, which she just can't seem to get around to doing.

Nevada's most celebrated filmmaker, ladies and gentlemen, and two great, cheesy slices of cinematic fun for your enjoyment. The blu-ray inlay card, by the way, is reversible to give either movie top billing.",1431993600,4,1498,5.110204081632653
8596255,4,B00DQBPVDQ,"Beautiful copy of The Doll Squad.  Unfortunately this movie is dull and unbelievable, but is a great artifact from the era of drive-in exploitation. Haven't gotten around to the other movie, but if you're into quality reproductions of this type, you can't go wrong.  After all, if Tura Satana is in a movie, it can't ever be called a waste of time, can it?",1383350400,4,356,4.546875
