2389706,3,B000ALCRKU,"This is sort of a Romeo and Juliet type love story. It's ridiculious at times with the ""white man"" hates ""Japanese"" story line.  Perhaps there was some truth to it at the time, the picture quality is bad, and the ending made me roll my eyes.  However it was a tolerable love story, and it was interesting to see the perspective of that generation.",1301270400,,347,4.40625
2389707,5,B000ALCRKU,The movie was great and the product received promptly and in excellent (new) condition.  Thanks.,1203292800,5,96,5.4
2389708,1,B000ALCRKU,"THIS MOVIE SUCKS.  COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY SUCKS.  ITS LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING PUBLIC ACCESS TELEVISION.  IT'S DEFINITELY RIPPED ON SOMEONES COMPUTER IN THEIR BASEMENT.  THE DVD MENU IS TRASH.  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T BUY IT. EVEN IF YOU LOVE FRANCO TO DEATH, SAVE HIM THE HUMILIATION AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE LIKE SONNY, WHICH IS EXCELLENT.",1141430400,46,337,4.946428571428571
2389709,4,B000ALCRKU,"I'm not a big fan of television movies - they're cheesy, badly acted, and the stories are usually very predictable.  But this movie is THE exception.  It captivated me from the beginning (it was aired as a 3-part mini-series) and even when I watched it again over 5 years later, it still held its own.  It is cleverly written, superbly acted, and the scenery (both the people and the places) couldn't have been better chosen.  I give it two thumbs up and never get tired of watching it over and over again.  It is truly one of a kind and probably the best 'to catch a thief' film (both made for tv and big screen) that has been produced in a very long time.  Kudos to everyone involved in making this spectacular film!",1090540800,,718,4.360902255639098
8078786,1,B000ALCRKU,Pirate copy. Not a genuine disc. Was charged full whack for a disc that does not have the official emblems or holograms on it and didn't play. Don't waste your money. Even the cover art is fake.,1503100800,,194,4.27027027027027
8078787,1,B000ALCRKU,"Literally the most spectacularly poor production I've ever seen. I'm inclined to think student films aren't even this bad. The picture quality, even the sound -- beyond amateur. It seemed like some key element of filmmaking was missing from this. A cinematographer, maybe? Terrible acting, but then, probably almost anyone would look terrible with such poor camera work, sound, and a shoddy script like this. The main lead, Adam, was so bad that the best of everything would've made little difference for him, though. Just -- too painful to sit through.",1500854400,,553,5.087912087912088

8078789,2,B000ALCRKU,"An OK movie, but given the choice, find something else. Must have been Frank-O's first movie. NOT three stars, maybe one and a half.",1486166400,,132,4.541666666666667
8078790,1,B000ALCRKU,What a terrible film. The acting is bad and It looks like it was filmed in someones backyard. I barely made it through 10 minutes before i turned it off.,1484179200,,153,4.133333333333334

8078793,2,B000ALCRKU,"Lots of character involvement. Very grainy footage. Interesting story line, although you feel no empathy for the lead actor who portrays an adult film ""actor"".",1372118400,3,159,5.4
8078794,4,B000ALCRKU,"As the only way to obtain this early James Franco movie, this copy is great. A pity it, and other early vehicles, is not available on a conventional dvd.",1323129600,2,153,4.310344827586207
8078795,3,B000ALCRKU,"I so wanted to see this film again as I remembered it from many years ago and it was a great story, although very tragic.
It was good to have the dvd but I was very disappointed in the picture quality which spoilt the movie a bit, but I am still glad that I purchased it. Lizasaurus",1322092800,,282,3.9649122807017543
