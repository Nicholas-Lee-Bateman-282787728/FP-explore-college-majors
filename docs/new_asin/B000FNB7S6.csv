2577193,5,B000FNB7S6,I'm not even pregnant and I love this DVD.  The workout is exactly what I need to stay in shape for tennis.  I've taken yogo from five other instructors - yet none give me the workout I'm looking for - except Sara.,1156723200,,214,4.071428571428571
2577194,5,B000FNB7S6,This workout is a nice and easy way to start out the day.  I did it in the morning to stretch and ease into my day.  My mind and body feels great after this short workout.  Definitely a must try!!!,1154217600,3,197,3.875
2577195,5,B000FNB7S6,"I am not yet pregnant but wanted to get my body in the best shape possible in preparation.  I found the postures and stretches easy to accomplish and the workout relaxing and refreshing.  I do work up a sweat doing this yoga workout and feel great afterward.  The background scenery is very peaceful and tranquil.  I would recommend this workout to any woman, pregnant or not.",1150848000,4,376,4.651515151515151
2577196,4,B000FNB7S6,"I got this dvd the day I hit my 3rd trimester. I didn't pay enough attention to realize that there was an actual 3rd trimester dvd (which I will probably now order). I enjoyed doing the work-out. I have Shiva Rea's prenatal yoga dvd as well. Sara Holliday's is much shorter and I feel like I've worked a lot harder. I have 2 little ones to chase while pregnant with my 3rd, so anything longer than this is too long for me to get thru. I was surprised at how long some of the positions were held, but of course I'm further along than most users would be, so it's a little more challenging for me. I do recommend this work-out.",1179964800,,625,4.1735537190082646
2577197,5,B000FNB7S6,I love this DVD because I can do it in the morning before work. It's short enough and easy enough to do at 5:30 AM. I would not advise doing this DVD while pregnant with a full stomach. That's why I prefer this in the morning on an empty stomach.,1178582400,2,246,3.94
2577198,4,B000FNB7S6,"This video is great for the morning or when you are a bit tired.  I am used to 60m ashtanga yoga so this video was a bit slow and basic for me.  However, this video is incredibly relaxing.  The birds chirping in the background are peaceful.  Sara looks wonderful pregnant.  But if you are looking for a little more intensity, I do not suggest this video.",1175731200,2,354,4.303030303030303
2577199,5,B000FNB7S6,This video has really helped me in my second trimester! I have strengthened my legs and my hips and definitely become more flexible! I love how she stretches because it has helped with my stretching stomach muscles! I have been pretty sick during this pregnancy and these videos are great because i can do them in my living room and not have to leave the house and i feel great after i am through! It has really helped with feeling good not only physically but also mentally! Thank you!,1170288000,4,486,4.47191011235955
2577200,5,B000FNB7S6,"I really enjoy doing this 35 minute routine. Afterwards I feel stretched and relaxed, and also like I got a bit of a strength building workout. Sara is easy to follow. I will continue to use this DVD after my pregnancy is over.",1168819200,,227,4.3023255813953485
2577201,5,B000FNB7S6,"I began practicing yoga several months before the conception of my first child and have been a faithful yoga follower ever since.  I was disappointed during my first pregnancy when I switched from my intense power yoga routine at about 4 months into my pregnancy to the Shiva Rea prenatal yoga routine.  There was no comparison.  I was not challenged and lost most of the strength I had acquired in the months before.  I'm 4 1/2 months into my second pregnancy now and was looking for something more challenging; something that would help me retain and build the strength I need to carry and deliver this baby while being safe and comfortable.  I popped Sara's routine into the DVD player last night for the first time and was surprised that my muscles were even fatigued after some of the poses!  It was a short enough routine that my 2 year old was able to entertain herself (mostly by watching me) while I practiced.  It immediately relieved the back pain I've been starting to have and made me feel more energetic, flexible, and stronger than I have in weeks.  If you are looking to stay fit during your pregnancy, I highly recommend trying this workout.",1167955200,14,1158,4.642156862745098
2577202,5,B000FNB7S6,"I first heard about Sara Holliday's prenatal yoga DVDs on the podcast Pregtastic and was intrigued from the start. This is my first pregnancy and though I hadn't done yoga before, I thought it would be a good low-impact work-out. Turns out that it was all that and more! The posses are very challenging and focus on core, back and lower body strength. The work-out really gets my heart rate up while strengthening and stretching my body. I've had some back pain on and off and I find that after this work-out the pain is completely gone. I'm so happy I found this DVD and definitely plan to get the 3rd trimester work-out too!",1165622400,3,626,4.5
2577203,5,B000FNB7S6,"I have Sara's first trimester and second trimester videos, I'm not pregnant and I love both of them.  This one is very relaxing in a peaceful lake setting with Sara doing voice-over instruction.  Sara's soothing voice and the background noises really give you a sense of calm.  This video emphasizes the use of breath and it provides some very intense stretches for your legs with the pyramid and triangle poses.  Overall, this is a short video (35 minutes) that will give you an intense stretching yoga workout.",1159833600,,512,4.850574712643678
2577204,5,B000FNB7S6,"Sarah was recommended to me, even thought this is for those who are pregnet,I am 50 years old, and I was looking for yoga to help my lower back and streching.  This DVD, is very helpful, is was easy for me to use, and understand.  The Frist trimester was a bit hard, so once I get this DVD down, I'll go back to the first one!!

Thanks Sarah for your workouts!",1158883200,,360,4.042253521126761
2577205,5,B000FNB7S6,"I am a student of Sara's and enjoy her yoga class immensely. I recently received the yoga dvd and have found that my enjoyment of the class has continued while viewing and participating with the dvd.  I'm not always able to make it to class so having the dvd makes a world of difference.  It's very relaxing, enjoyable, and easy to follow.  I love this yoga dvd!  Thanks Sara.",1158624000,,376,4.405797101449275
8124797,5,B000FNB7S6,"This DVD carried me through my pregnancy and was a welcome intro to yoga for me.  I do not have much yoga experience so I can't speak for whether this would be great for more experienced yogis.  As someone without much yoga experience, this DVD helped me fall in love with yoga, at least the Sara Holliday way!",1503360000,,310,4.327586206896552
8124798,3,B000FNB7S6,"I like the DVD, but thought it would have wished to have more than one short workout on it, for variation. Not much on it, honestly , was it 35 min?",1352937600,,148,3.806451612903226
8124799,5,B000FNB7S6,"Great video. It is very easy to follow yet hard and rewarding. I did w first pregnancy all of her dvds and while it did not help weight gain i had no pregnancy symptoms, pains, and i had a very easy labor.  I have been working out at the gym this pregnancy and it has helped weight gain but late in second trimester having tons of back pain and just pulled out dvds again to prepare for delivery n help w back, shoulder, rib pain.",1312848000,,430,4.0588235294117645
8124800,3,B000FNB7S6,I had been practicing both Vinyasa and Slow Flow for about a year before becoming pregnant and this DVD was simply too slow paced for me.  I didn't really feel like I got a good workout.  I also didn't really like the fact that there was no music at all in the background.  I have since purchased the Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga by Jennifer Wolfe and absolutely love it.  It's much more aligned for someone who has yoga experience.,1218931200,,425,4.410256410256411
8124801,5,B000FNB7S6,"At age 41 and in my 2nd pregnancy, I started experiencing severe hip pain at just 15 weeks. Scary. Walking made it worse, and the yoga videos I swore by during pregnancy #1 (Shiva Rea and Kristen Eykel) just didn't help. Sara Holliday's 2nd trimester video provided significant relief on the first time through. (It's rare for me to even get the hang of a yoga video on the first viewing, but I was about 90% successful in following Sara.) My other prenatal yoga videos are focused on flexibility and balance. Sara's is all about strength and movement. Lots of squats and lunges plus some excellent stretching through the shoulders and upper back. It will take me a while to build the strength to keep up with her completely but it feels like a good, healthy challenge. You will need yoga blocks, although I was able to get by for a few days by substituting two small accent pillows. The lack of background music was a bit startling at first but I think it actually may help me tolerate this video a bit longer. I was also a bit put off by the need to buy another video for third trimester, but then again, who can stand the same routine over and over for 6 months? I am very very enthusiastic about this yoga video and can definitely see myself continuing to use it after my pregnancy.",1212796800,,1286,4.430379746835443
8124802,5,B000FNB7S6,Generally I am not a huge yoga person and I only do it every once in a while (less than once a month)! However after receiving this prenatal yoga video I can tell such a difference in the way I feel! The video takes me thru a range of motions and stretches that helps to strengthen my body for the drug free natural childbirth I am preparing for. In the next couple of weeks I WILL be ordering the third trimester dvd as well. Some people are bothered by the lack of yoga music but it doesn't bother me at all.,1208908800,,510,4.0594059405940595
8124803,5,B000FNB7S6,"Great workout, but some days a little too much to handle.
She goes at a brisk pace.  Have your Mat, Blankets, and Blocks ready - you will use them.  Also, dress lightly - this one tends to work up a bit of a sweat.",1203638400,,214,3.840909090909091
8124804,4,B000FNB7S6,"I tried this video for the first time in my 23rd week after having not exercised consistently for several months. I'm not new to yoga but this video was challenging and just the right length. Although I would have enjoyed more ambiance(calming music, interesting scenery), I felt very good and stretched out afterward. Most importantly, I felt like I got my money's worth.",1186099200,,372,4.920634920634921
8124805,1,B000FNB7S6,"I have many workout videos and bought three for pregnancy.  This one I would not recommend.  It is not a comfortable enjoyable workout, you are upside down most of the time and when you are pregnant that is not a good position and it makes it hard to enjoy the workout.  Also my new DVD came with Sara's voice going at a high rate of speed, it is weird and annoying.  I would however, recommend Leisa Hart's Fit Mama prenatal workout for fun salsa dancing cardio and yoga segments as well as stretches and relaxation.  And Quick Fix Pre Natal workout, which is three 10 minute workouts, so you can do them anytime, even when you don't have much time or energy!",1181779200,5,660,4.377049180327869
8124806,5,B000FNB7S6,"My compliments to Sara Holliday's. This is the best prenatal yoga dvd that I found so far. And I'm actually so happy with it that I stoped looking for any others. Sarah gives you a 30 mins of very relaxing yoga. Her voice is beautifuly soothing and the natural setting are so wonderful. First she works out the upper body, stretching shoulders and relaxing all the shoulder/neck area where the tension sets. After she concentrates on the lower body part, working lots with the harmstrings, stretching and strenghtening those muscles. She encourages everyone to follow its own rythm, to follow everyone's breath and their own pace during the asanas (yoga postures). I love that the workout takes 30 mins as it can perfectly fit into most people's schedule. Sum up, you will strech, strenghten and relax all your pregnant body :). I highly recommend this DVD to any pregnant woman. Thanks Sara!",1180828800,2,892,4.875
