8529737,5,B008QOH1C2,"Sure it's obsolete fuzzy kinescope B&W TV from the 1950s, but those of us who fell in love with The Lennon Sisters still get hot now in Old Age.  The king Welk is still funny, has to wear glasses later hidden or directing given to others.  The in-line commercials still look idiotic, transitions awkward, and lots of musical and acting flubs appear.  But this is Big Nostalgia.  Hard to see why Welk fired Pete Fountain for playing too jazzy on his clarinet, but Welk eventually also fired his Champaign Lady Alice Lon for being too sexy.  Hmmmm.",1430870400,,546,4.587628865979381
