This set contains two movies that were adapted from one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyles stories. They have lessons as part of their entertainment. Doyle was interested in criminology and used true crimes as inspiration for these stories. Human nature (greed) continues. These movies are not copies of the original stories, but used parts and adapted them to modern times. They are worth watching as entertainment and about the culture of that era. The original stories are always worth reading, especially when you are older. Read the individual reviews for more information on each movie.

Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror (1942) tells about an enemy broadcaster who accurately predicts sabotage and terror in war-time Britain. Sherlock Holmes is called by the Inner Council to solve this problem. He is aided by denizens of the Limehouse District to catch the spies. His Last Bow inspired this story but the plot echoes The Great Impersonation.

Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon (1942) tells of a plot to steal a bombsight to aid a foreign power. Its four parts are produced in separate factories (as a security measure). Will foreign agents be able to steal this secret weapon? The Six Napoleons inspired this story.",1453852800,,1276,5.037914691943128
