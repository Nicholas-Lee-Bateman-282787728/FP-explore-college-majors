4082612,5,B0037Z96BO,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When an avid horror fan like me thinks of Horror Icons, the name Lucio Fulci immediately pops into mind.  Fulci is probably one of the Grand Masters of Horror, in my opinion, and he is responsible for many classics that will forever influence filmmakers of the genre.  A LIZARD IN A WOMANS SKIN is a fine example of this excellence, even if it is a bit different from Fulcis trademark gory style.  If youve never experienced a Fulci film, now is the time to start.

A LIZARD IN A WOMANS SKIN is a very strange name for this atmospheric piece, but I suppose the symbolism fits into the plot.  The story is almost a fever-dream of epic proportions, and sometimes I had a hard time deciding whether or not Carol was dreaming.  This didn't detract from the film at all, and it actually heightened my enjoyment.

A LIZARD IN A WOMANS SKIN is shot well and looks excellent, particularly on Blu-ray.  The HD transfer is great, and I greatly enjoyed the picture restoration that was done.  Ive never seen the film on DVD, however Ive been told the picture degradation was pretty bad in spots.

The acting in the film is very good, although I have to confess I did not recognize any of the cast members.  Still, theres no denying the talent involved with this picture.

Special effects aren't a big part of A LIZARD IN A WOMANS SKIN, which is almost strange for a Fulci film.  Gore was a big part of Fulcis later films, and he gave me some of my first introductions to onscreen carnage.  But this film does not need it.  The story and the atmosphere it builds are enough to carry the film where it needs to go.

A LIZARD IN A WOMANS SKIN is another big win for me, and I highly recommend it.",1460332800,5,1755,4.350769230769231

4082614,5,B0037Z96BO,"A Lizard In A Woman's Skin is one of those rare Giallo films that goes waaay out there in a good way.  Many people know Lucio Fulci for his Horror Films.  Not many people know that Fulci originally started in filming comedic films.  After his wife's death, he went through several phases.  Westerns, Giallo, & finally Horror.
  This film is during his Giallo phase.  This is an AMAZING film.  I dare say it equals, if not surpasses, Dario Argento's Giallo work.  No Offense to Dario Argento (He is an incredible filmaker in his own right).  For all of those who are squeemish with animals, there is a brief scene with dogs that is fantastically real (No dogs were harmed.  These are fake).  Fulci was subject to a lawsuit concerning this.  And had to bring in his Special Effects Person to prove that the dogs in his film were really fake.",1458691200,8,839,4.513333333333334

4082616,5,B0037Z96BO,"Lucio Fulci's shining moment: better than ""The Psychic"" last thought to be his best achievement.  Florinda Bolkan is quite good here and the whole production is well thought out for such a complex tale.  Really impressive.  Stanley Baker, Leo Genn and Anita Strindberg co-star.  Brought to blu-ray by mondomacabro which is really scary.  1971, color.",1457481600,7,350,5.290909090909091

4082618,5,B0037Z96BO,"Just released by Mondo Macabro is one of the Italian Godfather of Gore Lucio Fulcis giallo masterpieces, A Lizard in a Womans Skin. I first saw this film more than five years ago and it totally blew me away. Ive been planning on checking it out many times since then and Im glad I waited because I had forgotten much of the film and also because this new Blu Ray is a such revelation, both in quality and for its wealth of extras.

Florinda Bolkan plays Carol Hammond, the daughter of a rich lawyer, who also employs her husband Frank (Jean Sorel). Carol is plagued with strange, sensual dreams which frequently involve her neighbor Julia Durer (Anita Strindberg). After one of these dreams turns violent, Julias body is found murdered in the same way as in Carols dream. Police Inspector Corvin (Stanley Baker) is assigned the case and has to determine what role Carols dreams play in the murder. Did she do it? Is someone trying to drive her crazy and frame her?

A Lizard in a Womans Skin is one of the most vivid, artful and gory giallo films that I have seen, and also one of the best. As soon as you think you know the killers identity, a new plot device is revealed, throwing your assumptions out the window. Ive seen Bolkan in many Italian films and she is easily one of the most diverse actresses of the genre. Just watch this alongside Fulcis equally twisted giallo Dont Torture a Duckling and youll see what I mean. Fulci doesnt hold back when it comes to gore here (those damn dogs!), but beyond that he lets his technical abilities shine more than probably any other film Ive seen from his oeuvre. The dream sequences are so well shot, its hard to believe its Fulciat least if you are only familiar with his low budget gore films. Plus there is a well developed story (which actually makes sense) that many of his later films (even some of his classics) lack. I cant forget to mention one of the absolute greatest scores Ennio Morricone has ever written. Its funny because I have listened to the soundtrack many times over the past couple years and even included a song on a Morricone mix I made, so its neat to hear the songs along with the film now that I am more familiar with them.

Mondo Macabros new Blu Ray (which was first released as a limited edition of 999 and sold out very quickly) is a dream come true for genre fans. It features one of the most beautiful restorations Ive seen in a long time. The disc is also packed with extras including interviews and commentaries. Full list of extras below:

-Complete version of the feature, 104 minutes 11 seconds, with alternative English and Italian audio tracks with newly created English subtitles.
-Documentary Shedding the Skin, with optional commentary from director Kris Gavin. (34 minutes).
-When Worlds Collide - Interview with Stephen Thrower author of Beyond Terror: the film of Lucio Fulci. (30 minutes).
-Dr Lucio Fulci's Day for Night: An interview with Lucio Fulci. (30 minutes)
-From Burton to Baker - interview with actor Tony Adams about his experiences of working on the film. (11 minutes).
-Feature Length audio commentary with Pete Tombs and Kris Gavin.
-Radio spots for the Schizoid release of the film.
-Alternative Italian title sequence.

8390908,4,B0037Z96BO,"Honestly, I hyped up this movie in my mind far too much for far too long. Because my expectations were so high I was of course a bit dissapointed. However, had I seen this movie first like the rest of the world did, before Fulci's other classics than I feel I would have been very pleased and the movie would have held a nostalgic place in my heart. Therefore in retrospect of this being Fulci's original giallo masterpiece and all things considered I give it four strong stars.",1527379200,,478,4.443181818181818
8390909,5,B0037Z96BO,"Finally a superb transfer of this terrific Giallo!  Mondo Macabre's Blu-Ray blows away both crappy Shriek Show releases (the first of which should never have seen the light of day).  For me this was like seeing the film for the first time.  And a ton of extras too.

This giallo alone puts Fulci right up there with Argento and Bava.  A must buy for any giallo fans.  Finally you can throw out those awful Shriek Show disks!",1521936000,,424,4.441558441558442

8390913,5,B0037Z96BO,"This is one of those reviews that'll begin, ""I never write reviews, but,"" a phrase signaling that something has actually happened. I purchased Lucio Fulci's A Lizard in a Woman's Skin sight unseen, on the strength of what had been written here and elsewhere. That might even be the best way to encounter the film, because the first frame to the last is an ongoing revelation. Technically dazzling, sonically arresting, so challenging to the senses and so consummately controlled that Fulci, whose name mainly conjures up a set of B-grade gore flicks, comes across here as nothing less than a master of atmosphere and style. It's surreal, hypnotic, photographed in an often baroque way, and would play well next to either Fando and Lis or Vampyros Lesbos. This was a great, unexpected find.",1501718400,2,789,4.93984962406015

8390917,4,B0037Z96BO,"One of the best Giallo films made.  Some people have complained that the drug scenes shows that Fulci doesn't really understand drugs--but the trip sequences are vivid and feel like a real vision or nightmare.  The film builds to an especially powerful ending--but then the producer's wouldn't allow Fulci to have a final trip/nightmare scene and the ending they enforced on the movie is a let down.  The usually good Stanley Baker is rather stiff as well--though the ending also hurts his character as well.

There were several dvd releases of this film, some of which were the edited down version--which is to be avoided--this has the complete cut.  Too bad about that ending but a must see for anyone interested in Fulci and Italian cinema of the period.",1471824000,3,757,4.837209302325581
