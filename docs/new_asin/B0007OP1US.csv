8049649,4,B0007OP1US,"This movie has an annoying sound track which many early films had and the transfer is not the greatest,but if you consider it was shot on old style of film stock that degraded and not modern acetate it is not bad. If you like to see some old sailing vessels then this DVD is worth the money. The story line is typical formula,the acting is good for the time and it reflects the times. Men were men,bad guys wore black hats but the real story is the actor George O'Brien. He is a real life hero,a much decorated litter bearer in WW1,after the war he became an actor. When WW2 started he joined the Navy,attaining the rank of Commander and was recommended for promotion to Admiral,his service was rated Superior and he was again decorated,but he was turned down because he had been an 'Actor' this was a dirty word to the top brass. As a side note many top Hollywood actors joined the military to see combat and serve their country with honor,God Bless Them.",1377388800,,956,4.4375
8049650,4,B0007OP1US,"RKO Radio Pictures presents ""WINDJAMMER"" (6 August 1937) (60 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- George O'Brien was an American actor, popular during the silent film era and into the talkie era of the 1930s, best known today as the lead actor in F. W. Murnau's 1927 film Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans --- American leading man of classic silent films who became a different kind of star in B-Western talkies --- The son of a policeman who later became police chief of San Francisco and then California Director of Penology, O'Brien was raised around police stables and quickly became adept at horsemanship --- He was a star athlete in school and intended to study medicine, but with the advent of World War I, he joined the Navy and volunteered to serve as a stretcher-bearer with the Marines.

Following his discharge, a chance encounter with Tom Mix led to a job as camera assistant with Mix's production company --- O'Brien takes on small jobs as a prop man, extra, stunt man, and finally bit player --- John Ford spotted the husky young man and cast him in the lead role of his early Western The Iron Horse (1924) --- He continued to work for Ford and became a popular leading man for a number of top-flight directors --- With the coming of sound, he moved almost exclusively into Westerns and became a popular star of low-budget oaters --- George remained popular until sound came along --- By that time, his popularity was sliding, but he did make the transition to sound --- With his rugged looks and physical size, he was soon a Western Cowboy Star --- He was in some of the best stories ever written, Riders of the Purple Sage (1931),

George O'Brien became a popular star of Westerns and rarely took parts outside of the Western film genre --- Throughout the 1930s, O'Brien was a consistent Top Ten box-office draw appearing in scores of Westerns, often atop his horse named Mike.

Our story line and plot, Bruce Lane (George O'Brien) as a state attorney general's right hand man sent to serve a subpoena on a tycoon, only to find himself a prisoner along with the millionaire Commodore Russell P. Selby (Brandon Evans) and his daughter Betty Selby (Constance Worth) aboard the ship of an arms smuggler, bound for Macao --- The action is pretty good, along with the characterizations - particularly William Hall as the roguish, mad-eyed Capt. Morgan (there even seems to be a tongue-in-cheek reference to the pirate Henry Morgan!) --- Constance Worth is very cute as Betty, playing the she-hates-him/she-loves-him clich for all it's Worth --- O'Brien is at his best with all of the action and final scenes giving it all he has.
