8183210,5,B000O75VD0,"I bought this DVD because I never could understand the game. Two dealers who are listed as some of the ""best in the world' modest huh. They do explain the game well and finally I understand the come out roll and the pass and don't pass. The DVD explains every bet on the game. It actually shows the procedure for the first roll through the completion. I bought those  'crap' DVDS from  that one professional gambler guy. These guys are real professionals in terms of the way they speak and handle themselves . They aren't actors they deal the game who better to learn the game from.
They include some simple strategies as well. So I learned stuff from the DVD. I am glad I bought it.",1248825600,4,683,4.3700787401574805

8183212,1,B000O75VD0,"This video gives virtually no instruction in HOW to play craps. It spends the majority of time showing how the casino PAYS each bet. Very confusing for a new player...not at all instructional as to how to play, or strategy of the game. Never shows an actual example of a player going to the table and going throught the rolls, etc. Total waste of money.",1236297600,,353,4.446153846153846
