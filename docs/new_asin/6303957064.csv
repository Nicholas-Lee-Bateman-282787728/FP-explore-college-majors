771878,5,6303957064,"A beautiful, terrifying film that frightens with suggestions of horror rather than with gore -- its portrayal of poor Miss Kerr's inevitable  disintegration into madness is so elegant that you wonder what on earth  happened to sophisticated, ""scary"" movies and why they aren't  made today.
What lurks in our own unconscious is so much more frightening  than anything that Freddy or ""Scream"" could possibly offer us.  Perhaps Wes Craven ought to read more Freud; he might make something worth  watching.",919296000,2,502,5.2125

772014,5,6303957064,"Along with The Haunting (Robert Wise's wonderful adaptation of Shirley Jackson's Haunting Of Hill House classic), THE INNOCENTS presents the best of classic ghost stories on the big screen.  There have been many, many disappointing advents along the way, between then and now, but there have also been surprisingly good films (The Changeling, 1980 with George C. Scott; and more recently The Others, 2001 with Nicole Kidman, and of course M. Knight Shyamalan's modern classic The Sixth Sense in 1999 which seems to have started the trend back towards ""smart horror"" and away from over the top CGI, gratuitous violence, gore, and jump-scares).  For many in my younger days, the bar was set with The Haunting and The Innocents as being the standard and pinnacle of good scary ghost stories which messed with your mind as well as your eyes.

THE INNOCENTS of course, if you have read anything about it, is a film adaptation of Henry James classic The Turn Of The Screw and the screen play does not wander too far afield from the original novel written just before the turn of the 20th Century.  The main thing you need to know is that the ""horror"" in this film is the classic use of black and white cinematography to trick your visual senses and the dense use of perfect ominous musical orchestration.  Add to that, the impeccable acting talent of Deborah Kerr and the two incredible children who are her charges as governess, and you have one of the best ghost stories to ever go on film.  I first saw this masterpiece 10 years after its initial release, in 1971, in a small theatre which specialized in screening older classics not in wide circulation and not being televised very often.  When the scene with Ms Kerr making her way down the long hallway corridor began and the ""tapestry"" at the end of the hallway suddenly became the dark figure of a woman walking across, the goosebumps were monumental, my spine shuddered and my cerebellum did a quantum double take.  Those were not days when you could pause and rewind.  It was decades before I would be able to enjoy all of the subtle nuance this film has to offer.

For under $10 this is an amazingly inexpensive ride you will enjoy more than once.  If you are classic film fan and you have never seen this, or you have seen and forgotten it for years, I seriously urge you to avail yourself of what a true ghost story should be.  Couple it with THE HAUNTING and you will have two of the greatest classic films in the genre.  And if you are a younger film fan, and have greatly enjoyed The Sixth Sense, The Others, Mama, and other cerebral horror films, check out their genesis!",1492387200,3,2632,4.610278372591006

772073,5,6303957064,"One of my favorite ghost stories ever!  A miracle of adaptation from the written word.  If you read the short book you'll see what I mean I believe.  James is never more ambiguous.  Giddons is pretty normal and this is her first placement as governess so I'm guessing she's in her early 20's.  Has no history of mental illness.  I say that because theres a lively debate among fans of this movie that there may be no ghost in the movie at all - they are all a creation of the heroines sick imagination which eventually turns deadly.  I disagree in the strongest terms!  To begin with James and everyone I'm aware of always refers to this as a ""ghost story"", something you certainly could not have merely with a madwomans ravings.  There is a huge discrepancy - at least one I'm aware of now - between the movie and the book.  In the movie they've conveniently planted the image of Quint in the miniature portrait of him Giddons finds shortly after her arrival in the home.  Thus she knew what the man looked like even though at the time she didn't know he was dead.  In the book Giddons begins seeing the apparitions without benefit of seeing any portraits of either one - she is certainly unaware of their appearance and when she describes the man to Mrs Gross it is Gross who quickly determines the person Giddons is saying she has seen.  I don't know why the movie decided to do it differently, but obviously since Giddons saw and described someone accurately who has died it gives every indication that she in fact has seen a real ghost.  Just makes the story so much more compelling to me and yet many people argue that Ms Giddons is simply a lunatic and this whole story is the product of her diseased mind.",1480118400,8,1713,4.431309904153355
772074,5,6303957064,"In the early 60s there were several very special black a white movies made.  To Kill A Mockingbird is one and The Innocents is another.  The cinematography in this film is incredible.  A visual feast.  Deborah Kerr's character is so delicately beautiful and so terribly cruel.  The two children are so eerie in their very adult mannerisms.  I love the way Flora singing, humming or playing the music box with 'O Willow Waly becomes a part of the score itself and haunts you with its simple melody.  In the fifty years since I first saw this movie I think about it now and then as one of the great films of my life experience of loving movies.  Interesting note:  the children were never allowed to read the whole, very adult script but were given only what they needed to learn for each scene as it was shot so they literally were innocents",1476835200,,840,4.473684210526316

772079,4,6303957064,"The film is a marvelous black and white film. It Has the magic of black and white; It has the depth of buildings, inside and outside, only seen in shades of grey, particularly dark grey. It has the perspective of shade and shadow and the menacing, awesome, fearful, fathomless profundity that implies some gravity in the drama. Cast in this partly old Tudor and partly old Georgian mansion this black and white coloring or absence of coloring is frightening, disquieting, perfect for the atmosphere that is expected from the story. We are entering a horror story.

The film chooses to emphasize one aspect of Henry Jamess story. The absolute paranoia and even maybe worse, something like psychosis, of the main character who is given a name she never had in the novella, Miss Giddens, giddy indeed from even before the very start. This naming the unnamable makes it more normal whereas the whole film is going to show she is absolutely berserk, from the very first instant we see her. I will regret the age of the actress. This governess is supposed to be hardly 20 or over by one or two years maximum. The actress does not fit that assumption. She cannot be in her first job just out of her family. She is too old and she behaves and acts too old, and her immature psychosis in front of some fear that is her own and she turns into a fright, a panic, or even worse, does not fit with this too obvious age.

Apart from that, right from the beginning she seems immature and emotional, like for example having the coachman stop at the gate for her to proceed on foot is absurd when you know everyone is waiting for her at the door of the mansion, servants and children (even if only one child at that moment). The fact that she finds the girl in the park around the mansion though she should have been at the door waiting for the arrival of the new governess is unacceptable even for a house where there is no master, except a housekeeper. The governess is at least surprisingly unaware of what she does not do right, but there is something wrong in the general picture.

And sure enough the film insists on her becoming more and more deranged by all kinds of noises and fears she develops in an old mansion she is convinced is haunted in a way or another. The two dead members of the personnel become her fixation: the previous governess who killed herself in the lake, which is not the original version, and the valet turned house manager whose death is not made explicit in the way it happened. But the innuendo about an unacceptable pregnancy is pushed aside. It is even hinted that the previous governess was old and not so beautiful.

The insistence on the relation between the children and these tow people is excessive and at the same time meaningless because the cause of the two kids coming under the guardianship of their uncle is not clarified enough and the two kids are not shown as they should: traumatized by the death of their parents, traumatized by their uncle sending them to this country mansion in some sort of exile, and traumatized by the death of the two people they had built a transference relation with. All that counts for nothing because it is not used except to build the phantasm of some haunting ghosts in the mind of Miss Giddens. And anyway what is wrong with a man teaching a boy how to ride a pony? You have to be particularly perverse to see some evil in that kind of action.

As for the children being possessed by the ghosts, the film does not show it really. They are close and that is normal since they have survived together at least three traumatizing losses, and they feel Miss Giddens is not entirely sane from their very first encounter. Miles will even say so and Flora in her final temper tantrum says about the same thing. In fact the children are just at first testing the woman and then playing with her when they find out she is haunted by some fright of some ghosts she imagines around her. They may be cruel but they are not haunted. Miles is depicted as cruel as cruel can be when he pushes the woman into her most vulnerable unacknowledged mysterious psychological layers by kissing her on the lips. Note this game is maybe a little bit too strong for a ten year old boy, and it is not what the original novella says: Henry James showed in details how the nameless governess was emotionally attracted and that this attraction was sexually haunted by the belief that anything physical was wrong, especially for children, and yet at the same time this nameless governess was physically attracted by the boy she kisses and hugs at least profusely.

Then the final death of Miles, rejecting Miss Giddens who is insisting on the presence of Quints ghost, remains unexplained really. It appears as if it were a way to protect himself against Miss Giddens but that is overreacting really and the final scene of Miss Giddens kissing the dead boy on the lips is just absurd. She likes her children dead so that they run no risk to be perverted . . . by her, and yet she desecrates Miles with a necrophiliac kiss.

The psychology of these two traumatized children is overlooked and the perverse desires of Miss Giddens are underrated, so that the film seems to have no real explanation: we are dealing with some unexplainable events, though these events can be entirely explained with a little of help from the first psychiatrist we can come across in the underground. The film is of course from the very early 1960s and that was a time when we considered psychiatry as a science of psychological diseases and we refused to consider non-clinical psychiatry explaining the behavior of people in a more meaningful way than behaviorism. And unluckily thats the final explanation that floats on top: the mansion is haunted and it took possession of its inhabitants, the children and the new weak and very obtuse governess.

Miss Giddens accepts a post as governess to Miles and Flora, a couple of children in a large Gothic mansion. Immediately she falls in love with her job and assumes the role of a doting mother. But after a few weeks she notices something is not quite right with their behavior. Their speech and mannerisms--especially Miles'--are more suited to an adult than a child. When he comes home from boarding school, she discovers he was expelled for foul language. Then she sees ghostly figures of a man and woman floating around the house. The housekeeper tells her the tragic tale of the previous governess Mary Jessel, who fell in love with the abusive valet Peter Quint. Their trysts were not very discreet and the housekeeper fears the children may have seen them.

Miss Giddens realizes this is where Miles and Flora have picked up their bad habits. Fearing the ghosts seek to control their minds so they can continue their union, she vows to expel them from the house.

Deborah Kerr is not only extremely beautiful but commands the screen at all times with her tall, imposing figure and strong, powerful voice. She adds several nuisances to her magnificent centerpiece performance that paint Miss Giddens as an ambiguous but wonderfully layered character. Are the ghosts real or is it just her imagination? Was their really a case of spiritual warfare or was everything fine before she came and stirred things up?

She has so many great moments where she doesnt even have to say a word--just an expression here and there is enough--the scene of her wandering through the corridors with a candelabra with the ghostly voices growing louder and more intense is a highlight.

What I like best about Miss Giddens is how she learns what it takes to be a good teacher. How at first she overlooks the childrens occasional brattiness and tries to smooth it over by playing games with them but slowly becomes the embodiment of tough love when she seeks to cast Peter out of Miles forever, even if costs his life. She urges him to confess where he learned to curse, steal and behave lecherously and he evades the question over and over. But then she gives a heartrending speech which encourages him to be strong for just a little longer.

Miles, Im not a cruel person. Im sometimes very foolish and I do make mistakes but Im not cruel. My father taught me to love people and help them. Help them even if they refuse my help. Even if it hurts them sometimes. Whatever youve done, Im not against you.

Jack Claytons direction is absolutely flawless. He needs no blood or guts or monstrous creatures to pop out at the audience. Instead he employs simple sounds--the echoing of a creaking door shutting, a gust of moaning wind or even just the tapping of the blind strings on a window--and the effect is perfect.

Jim Clarks editing contains slow dissolves and overlapping images which further adds to the ethereal essence of the film.

The cinematography is magnificent with its long sweeping landscapes and striking shades of purest white and darkest black in the night scenes and the costumes and sets are wonderfully detailed and sumptuous, appropriate for a period drama.

The Innocents is a spellbinding film that will keep you on the edge of your seat to the end.",1464134400,,3471,4.815126050420168

772174,5,6303957064,"I would want to begin with saying this is more of a psyco drama then a thriller.

This movie was shot in widescreen format black& white with mono soundtrack. They tried to fake the stereo for the dvd but all they got is flat sound after all. The picture quality was quite good but sometimes I see the line on the picture which is a major defact but not so much bothering me since the entire movie was so beautifully shot. It was forgivable.

Deborah Kerr was not a gorgeously beautiful but she is pretty enough to make me love her through the movie. She starred from the movies like <THE KING AND I>and I think you know it already.

In this movie she starred as a governist and just came to this lovely huge house with two children and a housekeeper.

From the first day, she sees the dead ghost from the house and from outside the house. They happen to be the children's parents who died for years.

The ghosts doesn't seems that scary in this movie. They more remined me of the other movies like <Wuthering Heights> or even Alfred Hitchcock's <Rebecca>. Meaning, it's more like mental drama. If there's a word like that.

Deborah's seriousness makes this movie heavy and she seems the only one who is actually make the movie go on.

The children and the housekeeper are just not that concerned about the ghosts that much.

But at the ending part we seem to understand that maybe the son and the daughter were haunted by the ghost and the ghosts are inside their body.

The lightening was beautifully arranged and the candle shots are more beautiful then  Stanley Kubrick's  <Barry Lyndon>.

People are saying that this movie is a milstone of  thriller but I would say this is a milstone of psyco drama.

Children are good actors and you will like them acting.

This movie makes Psycho look like Bambi!!!!!!! It is infinitely extremely spooky, creepy, terrifying, and frightening to Kingdom Come. The  beginning credits will already frighten you to death; will already send chills behind your spine with the hauntingly and ghostly voice of that creepy little girl singing ""Oh Willow I Die"" and especially the picture is just pitch black and then you see a creepy candle flickering. If you think The Haunting (1963) is the scariest movie of all time--wait till you see this one. The Innocents is about a governess played by Deborah Kerr who takes care of two orphaned children; Flora and Miles. They only pretend to be ""The Innocents""!!!! They seem like very sweet and fun children but don't let that deceive you. They are possessed by evil spirits or ghosts of their late governess and her lover. At first Deborah or Miss Giddens doesn't find anything wrong with them and befriends the nice old maid Mrs. Gross and both just watch the children play in the beautiful garden of their creepy English mansion. When Deborah Kerr or Miss Giddens  first arrives at Bly Mansion; she already encounters a spook; she wanted to walk through the beautiful lake and rose garden and as she was walking by the lake, she hears a haunting and ghostly voice softly callling ""Flora, Flora..."" (just gives me chills and goosebumps remembering that voice) then Ms. Giddens finds Flora looking at her reflection on the lake. Flora sweetly and cheerfully greets Ms. Giddens and takes or pretends to take an instant liking to her. Flora and Ms. Giddens go into the house to meet their maid Mrs. Gross and Anna and their butler. Ms. Giddens and Mrs. Gross have fun playing with Flora and decide that it is time for her bath. The two women bathe her together and all three of them are having fun but suddenly Flora blurts out that Miles is coming home soon and Mrs. Gross says ""Don't be silly child. Miles is away at school."" Miles is away at boarding school. That night as Ms. Giddens was falling asleep the windows frighteningly just burst open and the candle burned out which scared the daylights out of her. So anyway, Flora, Ms. Giddens, and Mrs. Gross are having tea in the terrace and Ms. Giddens is looking at the mail; then suddenly she has a look of terror in her face and becomes pale as if she's seen a ghost; (even though the movie is black and white you know she turns pale with fright). Anyway, she asked Flora about that thing about Miles coming home soon the night before; and Flora nonchalantly says yes, he's coming home. The letter said that Miles was expelled due to strange behavior; that he injured a lot of his classmates. Things get infinitely darker from that point. The next day they pick up miles at the train station and he seems like a nice boy so Ms. Giddens just shuts her mouth about the matter of him being expelled and just plays along with him and Flora and is charmed by his sweetness and flattery. But that night; as Miles was in bed; she confronted him gently and sweetly about his being expelled and Ms. Giddens begged him to behave better and not do those awful things again. A tear streamed down his face and Ms. Giddens wiped it tenderly and motherly and begged him to TRUST  her and all of a sudden the windows burst open again and the candle light flickered out. And he creepily and chillingly says ""It's just the wind my dear. it's just the wind."" Creepy!!!!!!!!!!!! The next night things got infinitely more frightening as Ms. Giddens and the children were playing hide and seek before bedtime. (It was their trick for her to encounter the two apparitions) So she joyfully plays along and roams through those dark, practically pitch black spooky hallways of that creepy English mansion with only an oil lamp (this is set in 19th century England--no electricity yet) and suddenly Ms Giddens comes across a ghostly woman at the end of the hallway just wondering aimlessly and Ms. Giddens thinks that it is just Anna but looks to the direction that woman walked to and discovered it was just a wall and couldn't find a trace of that woman anymore. She was infinitely terrified and yelled at those children to come out from hiding and she comes to the attic and finds the music box of the dead governess and in it a picture of her lover and the tune is ""Oh Willow I Die"". She was buried under the willow tree in the garden of the estate. Then the attic door slowyly creaks open and Ms. Giddens sees a hand and almost faints with fright and sees that it is only Miles then he laughs wickedly and hugs her so tightly as if he were about to stangle her and demands that he let her go and yells at him that he is hurting her. She then sees the ghost of the late governess' dead lover standing on the terrace and looking at her with cold eyes and a terrifying look. She screams to Mrs. Gross and exclaims to her that she saw the ghost but she does not believe her. Then the next night Miles and his sister walk creepily down the stairs in fancy clothes with an oil lamp and Miles reads this chillingly macabre poem about the dead. Mrs. Gross finally tells Ms. Giddens that the lover died one wintry night as he was coming home because he walked up the icy slippery stairs and fell and cracked his skull and died instantly and Miles found him with the deceased man's eye's open. From then on, Miles has been possessed by the dead lover's evil spirit. Mrs Gross then tells Ms. Giddens that shortly after his death; the late governess just sank into utter infinite misery and deep depression and killed herself one day by drowning herself in the lake of the estate. That Sunday as the four of them were about to enter the church for Sunday service; Flora goes to the graveyard in the back of the church and Ms. Giddens hides herself and quietly observes her  and once Flora entered the church; Ms. Giddens ran to the grave that Flora visited and it said the dead governess' name. The next day is the most frightening point of the movie. Flora is dancing in the gazebo beside the lake and Ms. Giddens is disturbed of why she has that creepy music box with that creepy song ""Oh Willow I Die"" she demands that Flora tell her where she got it but Flora screams and screams and cries ""Leave me alone!!!!! Leave me Alone!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE YOU!!!!!!!! I HATE YOU!!!!!!!!!"" Then the sky suddenly turns black and scary thunder emits; and it rains terribly hard and all of a sudden Ms. Giddens with an infinite look of terror on her face and eyeslooks across the lake and sees the infinitely frightening apparition of the late governess; all dressed in black and just horrifyingly staring at Ms. Gidddens!!!!!!!! Ms. Giddens decides that it would be best to tell their uncle about the strange frightening things going on in the estate. Before she leaves, she goes to the library of the mansion to get some books to read for the train ride to London and another frightening moment happens; as she chooses three books to take with her she hears a book drop but knows she didn't drop anything and especially that no one is in the library but herself and she suddenly has a look of terror on her face and eyes again she slowly turns her head and sees the ghost of the dead governess dressed in all black again sitting in the main desk of the library. Ms. Giddens decides to finally and bravely confront the ghost and walks slowly to her but with her heart beating with terror. But the ghost disappears as Ms. Giddens gets next to her. She decides to not go at all to London but just write to the Uncle. Then she orders that everyone except Miles leave the house because she wants to privately spend time with him and finally rid him of the evil demons. Miles destroys the letter of Miss Giddens to the uncle. She becomes angry at Miles for doing that. That night when everyone was gone except for only Ms. Giddens and Miles now, she confronts him and asks him to tell the truth of why he has been behaving so evilly and then he runs and to the creepy statue garden and they see the ghost of the dead lover. Then Ms. Giddens screams and Miles says i'm sorry to her and tells her that he loves her but  falls on his forehead and Ms. Giddens says to him you are finally free my darling I love you too but then finds out that he's dead with his eyes open just like the dead lover. WARNING: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ALONE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE LIGHTS OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Infinitely spine chilling; spooky, creepy, macabre, frightening, terrifying, and horrifying. If you love or at least think that my synopsis of this movie is frightening and terrifying, wait till you actually watch it yourself and see my frightening synopsis come to life. This movie infinitely scared me to death; I couldn't even sleep that night after I watched this because I was looking around all over my bedroom if there were any dead apparitions staring at me of people I know who have died. I was so infinitely frightened that I slept with the lights on that night and the T.V. on with a bunch of comedies on. I always thought that The Haunting was the most frightening movie ever made but not anymore when I watched The Innocents. The Haunting is #2 now in my book for the most frightening films; what would have made it tie with for #1 with The Innocents  is if they could have had an apparition of Abigail Crane standing in front of the nursery door. The Innocents: The most frightening film ever made in the history of cinema. Oh!!!!!!, this is definitely a great movie for Halloween night!!!!!!!!!!",1437609600,,9666,4.495449374288965

772275,4,6303957064,"""The Innocents"" (1961) is directed by Jack Clayton (The Pumpkin Eater, The Great Gatsby). The Innocents is a psychological drama about a governess (Deborah Kerr), and a couple of children whom she is caring for, who seem to be playing games on her. Based on Henry James's novella ""The Turning of the Screw"", with a screenplay cowritten by Truman Capote. This black and white film, shot on location at the Gothic mansion of Sheffield Park in Susses, slowly reveals the unhinging of the governess as she tries to unravel the secrets around her. Genuinely creepy and haunting this film leads us down into a dark place where one's imagination may be one's worst enemy.

This film is a new 4K digital restoration which has an audio commentary by cultural historian Christopher Frayling. There is also a interview with cinematographer John Bailey, a featurette about the making of the film, and an essay by Maitland McDonagh.",1435017600,2,919,4.929032258064516

It's Henry James by way of screenwriter Truman Capote, which explains why the two young actors (Pamela Franklin and Martin Stephens) utter dialogue far too arch and knowing to be issuing from the mouths of children, which is precisely the point. It's another dream project for director Jack Clayton, one of the seven films he completed in a thirty year, hard luck career. It's a tour de force for actress Deborah Kerr, whose character's actions are balanced on a knife edge of heroic resolve and utter insanity.

772415,5,6303957064,"It's a wonderful, classic film. Deborah Kerr was not only a great beauty, but a terrific actress. And she was at her best when she had a role that suggested repressed emotion quivering beneath the apparently calm surface, like this, 'Black Narcissus' and 'The King and I'. Freddie Francis's stunning black and white widescreen photography, and the astonishing performances by the two children, add up to a great film version of the disturbing Henry James story. It's wonderfully low key, and the tension, thanks to Jack Clayton's restrained, brilliant direction and the fabulous Miss Kerr builds so slowly that you aren't aware of it until it's all over. The impact it had when it was first released was incredible, and that's diluted a bit over time, but it's still a cracker. This is one of the great ambiguous ghost stories that suggests  much more than we see. It's a keeper. There was a follow up film which elaborated on the relationship between the two servants, with Marlon Brando and Stephanie Beacham called 'The Nightcomer's which doesn't come close to this.

Are two innocent children being possessed by the spirits of their former governess and gardener, or is their new governess a victim of paranoid delusions? With a remarkably dark and potent script bearing the unmistakable fingerprints of Truman Capote (particularly in dialog), the work becomes a gothic masterpiece. Particularly impressive are the performances of Kerr and the children, and the relationship between the three itself becomes more and more unsettling by each scene. Meanwhile, the dark, shadowy shots within the country house with its lofty staircases and candle-lit rooms is creepy good fun. Jack Clayton knows just how to pace such a film to bring an eerie sense to the whole work. Enhanced by a particularly chilling score (and the song ""O Willow Waly,"" a brilliant piece composed for the film), The Innocents chills on multiple levels.

772651,5,6303957064,"A brilliant realization of the Henry James story ""The Turn of the Screw"", Jack Clayton's 1961 film is a mini-masterpiece.  Totally absorbing with a potent screenplay written mainly by Truman Capote mixing a fair amount of Southern Gothic with the classic Victorian English ghost story.  Deborah Kerr is simply unforgettable as the governess Miss Giddens trying to ""save"" her charges from the sins of the past.  It is reported that Kerr considered this as her best performance and that's really saying something considering her extremely illustrious career.  She is supported by two remarkable child actors, Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin, who are brilliantly chilling in their roles and the main reason why this film is so convincing and believable.
Director Jack Clayton was at the peak of his powers and this was the second of three excellent films he made between 1959-1964; the others being the Academy Award winning ""Room at the Top"" and ""The Pumpkin Eater"".  A huge factor in the success of this film was its ""look"" mainly achieved by the stunning black and white cinematography of Freddie Francis.  Francis had just come off winning the first of his two Oscars: ""Sons and Lovers"" (1960).
As to be expected, the Criterion Collection edition is exemplary with lots of first rate extras.  The highlight is an excellent and very informative introduction to the film by Christopher Frayling who also provides the audio commentary.  I don't always take a great deal of notice to film intro's but I suggest you watch Frayling's as he provides a remarkable and invaluable insight into the history of this film.",1412553600,11,1614,5.041353383458647

772654,5,6303957064,"""The Innocents"" is effective because of its restraint.  If this were filmed today, it would be ruined by endless CGI effects, propane explosions, windows blowing out of high-rises, cars flipping over and ghostly cyclones sweeping up entire neighborhoods.  In other words, it would be over-produced farce.

But in 1961, when this was made, storytelling still took a front seat in motion picture production.  The whole point of a movie is to tell a story, not dazzle you with plotless, computer generated B-roll footage.

Marvelous sets, costumes and fine manners make this film a veritable recruitment tool for the 19th century, which appears indescribably beautiful.  The performances are excellent and one can't help but think you'd never find a child actor today who could handle the dialogue as well as young Martin Stephens does here.  In 1961, children were far better educated (especially in upper class England) than they are today; so finding an actor who could present adult dialogue with such subtlety and sophistication wasn't the problem it would be in 2014.

The only point on which I disagree with this film's producers is the use of birdsong in the opening and closing scenes, as well as in a few other places.  It seems far too cheery and somewhat out of place, especially when used at night.  Were I the film's director, I would have ordered the sound of wind blowing through the branches instead.

772879,5,6303957064,"""The Innocents"", Jack Clayton's masterful adaptation of Henry James' ""The Turn Of The Screw"" (artfully scripted by William Archibald and Truman Capote, and photographed by Freddie Francis in beautiful Black and White) is a rare thing you don't find these days; a first-rate, intelligent chiller in the Gothic ""haunted mansion"" genre. It's all very moody, atmospheric and ultimately unsettling.
  Deborah Kerr is Miss Giddons, a governess in sole charge of Flora and Myles (Pamela Franklin and Martin Stephens) at Bly Mansion, a large country estate. Their Uncle (Michael Redgrave) has no interest in or time for the children. He tells her that if any problems arise, she must deal with them by herself and never bother him. All is pleasant enough until little Flora, with a seemingly psychic sixth sense, starts gleefully screaming that ""Myles is coming"" home. Odd, since Myles is away at school. Next day, Miss Giddons receives a letter stating that Myles has been expelled from school for being an ""injury"" to others. As she begins to delve into the dark history of Bly Mansion, Miss Giddons suspects that the children are being haunted/possessed by the ghosts of Miss Jessell, their deceased governess, and Peter Quint, Bly's gardner and Jessell's sadistic lover. One evening while playing hide and seek, Miss Giddons is convinced that the ghost of the menacing Quint is outside the windows. The kind and plainspoken housekeeper Mrs. Gross (Megs Jenkins) is not given to supernatural speculation,  and advises her that it is not good to go on and on about things that are ""over and done"" with. Nevertheless, Miss Giddons is convinced that something ""secretive, whispery and indecent"" is going on; and she alone must save the children's souls from ghostly influence and possession.
  Deborah Kerr gives a brilliantly modulated performance; skillfully moving from a gradual fear to an almost religious, zealous conviction. Clayton gets excellent performances from the children as well; particularly Martin Stephens as Myles. Stephens simultaneously suggests innocence and a frightening poise and knowledge well beyond his age. Are Myles and Flora influenced/possessed by the ghosts of Jessell and Quint, or is it all a figment from the mind of their repressed governess Miss Giddons? The  genius of Clayton's style is suggesting that both conclusions are entirely possible and logical.
  Megs Jenkins played Mrs. Gross again in a 1973 TV version opposite Lynn Redgrave.  Unfortunately, Redgrave's spooked governess, unlike Deborah Kerr, becomes shrewish when she becomes frightened.

772976,5,6303957064,"This fim is based upon a Gothic ghost story ""The Turn of the Screw""  by Henry James, so it has been around for awhile. I had to do a term paper on this story, when I was in high school maaaannnnyyy years ago. The topic was, were there really ghosts haunting the  children or were they in the governess' imagination. It was a hard paper to write as you can make a good case for either of these. The story begins with a new governess, Miss Giddens, arriving at ""an old, dark mansion"", as most of these stories do and the time period seems to be Victorian.. She is to care for a girl, Flora, of around 7 years old, but, soon after she arives, Flora's brother, Miles, arrives home from school. He has been expelled for reasons that are never made clear, but one imagines is for saying things which children are not allowed to say.  It is apparant from the beginning that the children have a secret life and they behave in a more mature manner than is normal. Miss Giddons starts seeing the previos governess and horse master, even though they died before she arrived. These appearances often coincide with peculiar behavior of one or both of the children. She makes it her primary duty to make the children admit to seeing these ghosts and being influenced by them. To say more would ruin the rest of the story and the outcome. This film is very well acted by a wonderful cast of 4. The book is just as good, but most people enjoy seeing a film these days.

773091,4,6303957064,"The scariest horror film I've seen in some time. It follows all of the elements of your typical Gothic horror feature (spooky old house, creepy kids). What makes this one so striking, however, is that in this movie, things go bump in the night, day, and everything in-between. We never get a moment of rest.

From the very first scene, the exposition detailing the film's premise (an uncle's niece and nephew need a new governess in his house in the country), we can immediately tell something is wrong. The dialogue is all rather twisted (co-written by Truman Capote), and the plot goes in a disturbing, semi-incestuous direction.

Additionally, all of the scares are well-thought out and built up. No cheap ""jump"" moments in this classical horror movie. We don't even get many close-ups of the scary action (so to speak) going on, which almost makes it scarier; it makes the events that much more objective, making it that much more plausible that you could also be watching it live, but from slightly afar.

Beyond simply the solid storytelling, we also get some stellar performances, especially from the two children. (And I usually hate kid actors, so that's saying something!) The film is also shot beautifully and rather strangely; as seen above, we often get shots with characters in the foreground and background, both in focus. This is a fairly uncommon technique, rooted in medieval artwork, giving the film an additional layer of other-worldliness. Which, for a house full of spooks and spirits, fits perfectly.

While it is a bit of a slow build-up, this is a wonderfully effective and genuinely creepy horror movie. The ending was so shakingly haunting that I actually re-watched the last half hour or so. This is not as good as some other classic horror from this era (one could make countless comparisons to The Haunting, which came a few years later) but this certainly helped set the stage for a newer, smarter style of horror.",1369440000,,1945,4.884848484848485

I grew up on Dark Shadows and books by the Brontes, so my pre-conceived notion (need that latitude again, please) of what a Gothic-tale governess is like doesn't mesh very well with Deborah Kerr. The main issue I have may be her age, I'm afraid. (She was forty at the time). I have not read ""The Turn of the Screw,"" but I understand that the position is the first for this governess.

773097,5,6303957064,"The Innocents, is, despite being made over 40 years ago, one of the most disturbing and frightening horror films I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot, coming from someone who has seen as many scary and ""disturbing"" films as I have. I guess it's mostly because it's so unexpected. I mean who would expect a black and white film from the early 60's that takes place during the Victorian era in England and focuses on Upper Class characters to be so creepy and unsettling? And for anyone who has yet to see this masterpiece of horror, don't let the rather pleasant setting, polite characters, and old fashioned clothing fool you. The Innocents is no lighthearted period drama with a few eerie scenes thrown in. It's a full-blown atmospheric, gothic horror film which takes place in an English manor in the country. The film itself is just one adaptation of the classic Henry James novella The Turn of the Screw. And as I have never read the novella before, I have no idea how close or far it is from the movie. However I have heard that it is quite good, maybe I'll give it a read one day? Anyway back to the film, it follows a woman named Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr), who travels to a country estate in Bly to look after the niece and nephew of a young rather handsome, popular gentleman who lives in London and is too busy to concern himself with two orphaned children Flora (Pamela Franklin) and Miles (Martin Stephens). Giddens accepts her job as governess to the two children and seems to get along well with them, however right from the start there are ominous signs that something is wrong as Giddens hears disembodied voices calling in the garden and the girl Flora makes odd, somewhat disturbing remarks at times, even foretelling Miles premature return from boarding school where he is expelled for ""corrupting"" the other boys. Eventually after learning more about the history of the manor and the tragic deaths of two former lovers who, in addition to working at the manor, were in an abusive relationship and very close to the two children, she begins to suspect that the children are in fact possessed by their souls, which would explain the very ""adult"" language and knowledge they both occasionally  use and exhibit. The film never makes it explicitly clear whether or not the voices and apparitions Miss Giddens hears and sees wandering the corridors and grounds of the mansion are real or not, making this film very psychological in nature. The Innocents is a fantastic, suspenseful, mysterious film which has aged remarkably well and continues to be as engrossing, spellbinding, and terrifying as it was when it was released back in 1961. In an age where horror films increasingly rely on gore and special effects for their scares, it's refreshing to watch a film that doesn't rely on cheap jump scares and buckets of blood and guts to scare you out of your wits. I mean there are a few cheap scares thrown in, but overall, it's the creepy atmosphere, use of shadow and light, strange behavior of the children, and other more minor details, such as a large insect crawling out of the mouth of a statue in a rose garden, that will prove far more effective and memorable after your done watching this total creepfest!",1362528000,2,3235,4.695422535211268

773183,5,6303957064,"Well, I finally saw this this past weekend and I must say that I was really taken aback by how intense and how effective every frame was.  The story reminded me a lot of 2001's `The Others' and was, essentially, just as effective (maybe even more so in parts) and developed a truly engaging and mystifying `ghost story' with truly etched out character development that took me by surprise.  While nothing is explained in great detail, we are left with a pretty obvious understanding of the truth behind all the scares.

`The Innocents' centers on Miss Giddens, a single woman sent to take care of two children in a devilish Victorian mansion.  She meets Flora and is instantly smitten and then she meets Miles and is instantly concerned.  News of his arrival from school preceded him, and it was obvious from the tone of the letter that he was trouble and yet his countenance and his approach to Giddens was so soft and sincere and soon she is taken by his charm and convinced that the caution in the letter was a pure misunderstanding.  But then things change.  Giddens sees things that bother her and she hears stories that scare her and soon she is about as unstable and manic as she is fervently determined to `save the children'.

What she does is anything but.

Deborah Kerr is one of my favorite actresses to have ever lived.  She built such an immense body of work that was so vast and varied and engrossing.  This is yet another astonishing turn by the star.  She embodies the depth of fear and pain in Giddens' voice and mannerisms and truly etches out her mental instability for the audience to endure and embrace.  She is aided by some sublime supporting roles, especially by young Martin Stephens who shades Miles to perfection.

It is brilliantly faithful to James' novella.  It has never been topped at the ultimate haunted house film in which the horror is beautifully sustained with masterly cinematography  and flawless responses on the part of the governess who sees the ghosts and is terrified for the fate of the two children in her charge.  It just doesn't get much better than this.  The old dark house is engulfing and beautiful; its spaces are perfect backdrops for its four lonely and vulnerable occupants; the grounds are as haunted and forlorn as the structure itself.  And two of the scariest ghost scenes take place outdoors in broad daylight.  What drives the film of course is the governness, and her extraordinary bravery (if that is what it is) as she confront the horrors she is seeing and their threat to the boy and girl in her charge.  Is she mad? Or are there two powerful spirits seeking to commune with each other through the hapless children?  ---- James himself would never reveal whether this was a story about psychological breakdown or an actual haunting.  One dead give away, that it is about madness, for me, is that there is no good reason for the ghosts --- if they are ghosts --- to be revealing themselves to the governess.  But then again, perhaps they cannot help it or have an agenda involving her that I have not understood.  ----- But for me, this film and the novella itself work best as classic ghost material.  ----  There is not only terror here --- which is so common today in such movies --- but true horror.  And I recommend this to anyone who wants to be royally entertained by all the classic elements we expect from English ghost stories.  Deborah Kerr gave a magnificent performance in this; the supporting cast is perfect; and the children exceptional.  This will be around as long as movies are around.

I either read the book or saw a different version of this movie years ago, but I think I read the book  ""Turn of the Screw""  and saw a different film than this one.  I remember when the teacher and the ghost and the boy had a sort of threesome at the end, and the teacher kept trying to get the boy to admit he was seeing some ghost of a former employee. She nearly scared him to death.  Well, she did.  He died.

I also remember at the beginning there was a discussion around a tea table of people recalling the story.  It must have been eons ago that I either read it or saw it.  I didn't care much for the Deborah Kerr version.  Though it was boring and silly.

I think the best ghost story I ever saw was ""Ghost"", because it was kind of was eerie but mainly funny. Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg.  I really liked that one!  I also liked Rebecca, which wasn't exactly a ghost story, but just one of those really spooky flicks, that took place in a great big mansion in England.

773189,4,6303957064,"Directed by Jack Clayton, and starring Deborah Kerr, Michael Redgrave, Martin Stephens, and Pamela Franklin, ""The Innocents"" is a dark and eerily disturbing film of psychological horror. Set in Victorian England, and based on the novella ""The Turn Of The Screw"" by Henry James, with its Freudian screenplay written by Truman Capote, ""The Innocents"" has long been a favorite of fans of the genre.

Cinematographer Freddie Francis' skillful lighting and Clayton's direction give the film its eerie atmosphere -  the beginning is completely black, with only singing heard (which confused projectionists of the time), for almost a minute, before the credits begin.  This sets the tone for the entire film, in the manner of another masterful black and white film of the genre - Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" (1963).

The uncle (Redgrave) of orphaned Flora (Franklin, age 11 at the time in this her first film role) and her brother Miles (Martin Stephens, an extremely popular child actor of the 50s and 60s) grants Miss Giddens (Kerr) her first position, as governess. He gives Miss Giddens full rein with them, as he is busy and does not want to be bothered.  Her repressed sexuality begins to be evident in her scene with Redgrave, and is brought to the surface more as the film develops, especially in a couple of particulary unsettling scenes with Miles.

Miss Giddens is convinced soon after she moves into the estate (the film takes place on location in a gothic estate in England) that the spirits of the former governess Miss Jessel and valet Peter Quint (Peter Wyngarde-  who fans of ""The Avengers"" TV show will recognize from the most popular episode of the series, ""A Touch Of Brimstone"", have possessed the children, and she strives to free them of the dead lovers' influence - resulting in unforeseen consequences.",1321660800,4,1821,4.99009900990099

Reviewers who have asked the questions: ""Is Miss Giddons losing her mind?""  ""Are the children possessed?""--believe it or not, YOU GOT IT!  That's the point.  It's a study in the character of Miss Giddons (played with livid yet contained emotionality), a woman raised by a minister, impressionable, trusting, responsible, yet innocent in the ways of the world.

773286,5,6303957064,"I remember when I was 9 years old and saw an article on the film, The Innocents, in Life Magazine. I wanted to go see it but my mother thought it wouldn't be a good idea. This is an adult horror story with all the ambiguities of adult life and longing. As such, it is probably the best of the adult ghost stories. The film is an adaptation of Henry James's short novel, The Turn of the Screw, a novel I read in collage which gave me the shivers with its wonderful and subtle descriptions of the evil apparitions that population the story. Henry James trusted in the intelligence and imagination of the reader and thus he under describes terror so that the reader can fill in the horror with their own imagination. Well, this film is much in keeping with the spirit of Henry James because it never tells too much or reveals too much, thus keeping the viewer on their feet for the full 100 minutes of the film. The film is full of ambiguity for we are never certain as to whether the film is about two evil spirits of the dead come back to take the souls and bodies of two innocent children or whether the entire film is about the over excited imagination of a sexually repressed preacher's daughter who sees sexy ghosts where there are none.

Deborah Kerr is perfect as the governess, Miss Giddons, pretty and yet proper who professes to love children even though this is her first job as a governess. The child actors who play Flora and Miles, Pamela Franklin and Martin Stephens, are superb at being loving bright children and yet having just enough ambiguity in their actions to make the viewer uncertain as to whether they are not also in the power of evil forces. Martin Stephens is actually fantastic as the brother Miles for we are uncertain if he is precocious or sometimes inhabited by an adult spirit.

The black and white format for the film with limited sets and effects are used to maximum advantage. Truman Capote and William Archibald wrote the screenplay and the lines of al the characters are intelligent and double meaning. Director Jack Clayton is to honored for such a great adaptation of one of America's greatest ghost stories.",1291507200,13,2148,4.547803617571059
773287,5,6303957064,"Beginning with black frames accompanied by one of the most melancholy melodies ever heard on film, you are led into a sense of disquiet rarely equaled in cinema. Having just seen this recently, I feel almost shameful that I spend decades without ever giving this a fair shake. It is an absolute work of mastery. Deborah Kerr is wonderful to watch. Many compare this to ""The Haunting"", and while that film has its moments, it cannot hold a candle to this. This should be rolled out every Halloween, every rainy Sunday afternoon, every teatime. The opening credits alone boggle the mind. I hope this was put on the master list of best films ever made- if not, there is no sense in having such a list.

773288,4,6303957064,"First of all, that ending is totally messed up. Second of all, this is a pretty terrific exercise in subtle horror film-making. Or, hold up, is it instead a psychological fender bender? Deborah Kerr has gone on record, stating that she played her character as if insane in the membrane. Except that it's up to you, really, to arrive at your own interpretation. Is it all in virginal Miss Giddens's harried mind? Is it malevolent supernatural forces at work? Henry James' original novella ""The Turn of the Screw"" certainly isn't forthcoming in that detail. THE INNOCENTS is regarded as one of the finest cinematic adaptations of a literary work, and with one of the most ambiguous endings. That final scene, it certainly made me burst out with one of them ""What the fudge?!"" expletives. Gee, I love me a good British ghost story.

THE INNOCENTS scored well with me from jump, with its blanketing restraint and pervasive 19th century gothic atmosphere. One knew something was up with Miss Giddens, the parson's daughter, as soon as eyes are set on her. Deborah Kerr plays her with an understated nervousness, like a ticking civilized bomb, with mannerisms that are just slightly off-kilter and which communicated a sense of unease. It's not helping that the grossly inattentive uncle (Michael Redgrave) stays so aloof as he lays down the rules which would frame Ms. Giddens' new governess position, of minding his young orphaned niece and nephew. Her new job takes her to the Bly House, a sprawling isolated estate that at first seems exquisitely bucolic and welcoming until, you know, all the spooky scary. Michael Redgrave won't be joining her at Bly House. He, in fact, wants never to be bothered about anything regarding the children. He's a champion of a guy.

At Bly House it's not long before the creeping horror manifests. Except it seems that only Ms. Giddens is seeing things out the corner of her eyes or hearing strange noises, and being exposed to ""something secretive and whispery and indecent."" From the well-informed housekeeper, Ms. Giddens learns of the Bly House's past history of murder, obsession, and sexual predation, elements which does a woman's repressed nature all kinds of good, yes. Did news of these sordid goings-on set the governess's fragile mind a-flutterin', one wonders. Is it demons or is it dementia?

Deborah Kerr heads a superb cast and she is truly excellent. Her ambivalent turn keeps you wondering. Michael Redgrave only has a tiny part in the opening moments, and yet the detached, slightly sinister thing he's got going on - along with Kerr's tightly wound performance - helps to set the proper mood. You're never comfortable from then on. Young Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin are unsettling as the precocious angelic children who increasingly give you the creepy crawlies and who finally convince their governess that they must be possessed by foul spirits.

Mostly, the chills are suggested rather than fleshed out, although there are Boo! moments that jump out at you. Disturbing apparitions haunt Ms. Giddens in the lake and just outside the window, but these shades don't do anything other than look sinister. But THE INNOCENTS isn't aimed at the gorehounds, anyway. It's for those who crave literate, intelligent, stylish horror. Sometimes, that's me. That haunting melody, by the way, has always spooked the bejesus out of me. It's always those songs sung by children that raise the hackles, isn't it?

Not that I can prove it definitively, but I agree with Deborah Kerr's take. I think Giddens is a nutter. That ending... yech...",1284422400,5,3585,4.998324958123953
773348,4,6303957064,"In The Innocents, Miss Giddens takes on a job as governess of a majestic house in England. She has received the job after interviewing with the children's uncle, who didn't want to be involved with the burden of responsibility in caring for the children. Once at the home, there are indications that something is amiss, as the children act strangely and the governess begins to feel--and see- various apparitions. Are these only in her head, or is there something about this house, or its past, that is conjuring up spirits? Miss Giddens comes to a firm belief that the spirits of the former governess and the valet, Quint, are taking over the children. As she learns more and more about the former employees, she is convinced that there is an evil entity lurking that must be exorcised. However, there may be more variables to the story of the house, and its former inhabitants, that give clues to what is happening.

The Innocents is part supernatural mystery, part psychological suspense. It is a well-crafted, spooky tale which uses creepiness and atmosphere to keep its watchers unsettled. It might not resonate as well with those who need gore for a good fright, but the movie is a fantastic ghost story. The Innocents works on a subtle level, and it has an ambiguous feel to it because the story is told through the new governess' eyes. Therefore, you see what she sees. Undoubtedly, this is a film which can be interpreted on more than one level, and it raises several questions during and after its viewing. How sane was Miss Giddens, before and during her stay there?  Is the stately house being haunted from its former employees? How much do the children affect Miss Giddens emotional state? Are they are innocent as they seem?

This is a visually stunning film, and really is a superb interpretation of Henry James' The Turn of the Screw. It also employs fantastic camera shots when Miss Giddens' anxiety is at its height. Oftentimes what Miss Giddens is seeing is off in the distance, barely perceptible. Sometimes she sees what others cannot. One of the best scenes is when Miss Giddens first explores the house during the hide and seek game with the children, and sees what she seems to belief to be someone outside the glass. Scenes like this really make for creepy atmosphere. Also, The Innocents uses the repeated playing of a melancholy song to add to eerie feeling, heard at the beginning to set the ominous tone.

If there is one drawback to the DVD itself, it is the lack of extras. It would have been great to see some more background about the story, or James' novel to which it is attached.

Still, this is a definite collector's item for those who like a good ghost tale. If you are a fan of the films like The Haunting, then you will be sure to like The Innocents.",1281657600,5,2791,4.653144016227181
773349,3,6303957064,"I love the beauty of this movie; it's very pretty. The movie is a bit trite in motivation. Given that I'm from a more modern perspective, I find it really hard to swallow that the lady (who exhibits no irrationality or depression for most of the movie) just becomes ""convinced"" that the kids are possessed. Having said that, the creators do a good job of making the start of the film feel very ""off"": everything is overly perfect and sugary-great, but there's a definite undercurrent of something-not-quite-right. I loved the little girl's ultra-creepy lullaby, and she has a pretty voice. They use the song throughout the movie too much, though. I must admit that I'm a little spoiled-I was hoping for a movie as creepy as the old b&w ""Haunting"" or the extreme weirdness of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"".

773354,5,6303957064,"""The Innocents"" is one of the most atmospheric and creepy psychological horror movies ever made. The plot of the movie leads the viewer to believe that either the spinster nanny heroine of the movie, Miss Geddens, is having a nervous breakdown or the behavior of the two children she cares for is being psychically influenced by the murdered, low life, sadistic servant Quint and the masochistic, pathetically suicidal former nanny Miss Jessel. Apparently the deceased servant and the former nanny had a sado-masochistic relationship that was whispered about among the staff of the mansion. Quint and Miss Jessel ""kindly"" took the two children of the house, Miles and Flora, under their wings and acted as surrogate parents to the orphans, but it is rumored that Quint and Miss Jessel also had sex in the mansion with the doors wide open and possibly exposed the children to their kinky sexual encounters. The movie also implies that the one or both of the children may have been sexually molested by one or both of the deceased. Miss Geddens sees menacing apparitions of Quint and Miss Jessel in the presence of the children, but the children say that they don't see anything....or do they?? Were they so traumatized by the memory that can't see the apparitions, or, are the ghosts manipulating the children's behavior, or, is the Miss Geddens losing her mind?? This film doesn't reveal the answer, it's up to the viewer to figure it all out. Which is one of the reasons why the movie is so great. My personal opinion (SPOILER): the house is haunted by Quint and Miss Jessel, Miles is being controlled like a sock puppet by Quint, Miles and/or Miss Jessel killed Quint, and Miss Gedden is a freaking kook! And the kid that plays Miles deserves an Academy Award.",1249948800,5,1762,4.818481848184819
773355,5,6303957064,"This black and white 1961 haunted house classic is a winner all around.  Set in 19th century England, The Innocents has a haunting, gothic atmosphere throughout the movie that is perhaps unmatched.  This movie is based on the novel ""The Turn Of The Screw"" by Henry James.

This is a ghost story that stars Deborah Kerr, who plays a governess named Miss Giddens who is caring for two orphaned children (Miles played by Martin Stephens and Flora played by Pamela Franklin) in a huge Victorian mansion.  Throughout the movie there are ghosts that appear once in a while, such as a ghost of a woman who walks down a hallway, a ghost of a woman in a field (the previous governess Miss Jessel, played by Clytie Jessop), and the ghost of a man who appears on the roof of the house and outside a glass door (Peter Quint, who is Miss Jessel's lover).  As the movie progresses and the ghosts continue to appear, the childrens' behavior changes to the point of being strange and obnoxious.  As a result, Miss Giddens starts to wonder about what happened to the previous governess and her lover.  The governess feels that it's possible that the ghosts of these people are trying to destroy the childrens' innocence by possessing the children.  On the other hand, the haunted happenings could be just her imagination.  The children really get angry with the governess when she insists she's seeing ghosts and wants the children to notice them, but the children don't see them.  The only thing I don't like about the movie is all the yelling and screaming by the children.  It occurs a little too often.

One of my favorite scenes occurs when Miss Giddens is walking through the house with a candelabra in hand, investigating strange things that are happening.  It is such a spooky scene with perfect lighting, shadows, background noises, and innovative camerawork.  There are some classic haunting situations throughout the movie that are eerie and will scare you, some familiar, some innovative.  The musical score by Georges Auric is good.

Just like The Haunting (1963), this movie's atmosphere benefits from and is enhanced by the black and white filming because to me, black and white makes it darker and spookier.  There's just something about black and white that works.  It elevates the creep factor by bringing out the shadows and darkness.

This movie is always compared to The Haunting by horror fans and critics.  Why?  It's because both films were released around the same time (1961 and 1963), both are black and white films, both are ghost stories set in haunted Victorian mansions, both are based on novels, both are extremely creepy, both have innovative camerawork, and both have good musical scores, although I think the score for The Haunting by Humphrey Searle is superior.  I often have a hard time deciding which of these two films is better.  Of course, the books these movies are based on (Henry James's ""The Turn Of The Screw"" and Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting Of Hill House"") are night and day different.  The movies, however, will always be compared due to the above reasons and simply because it comes down to what a person looks for and prefers in a haunted house ghost story movie.  When it comes to comparing haunted house movies, I personally put the movie's atmosphere first and the story second.  The next person might do the opposite.

Deborah Kerr is one of the greatest actresses of all time.  How this woman didn't win an Oscar for her performance in this movie is beyond me.  In fact, she never won an Oscar in her entire career, even though she was nominated countless times (though she did receive a Lifetime Achievement Oscar).

If you're up for a good ghost story, buy The Innocents.  You won't be disappointed.  It's one of the all-time great haunted house/ghost story movies.",1249171200,4,3810,4.79601226993865
773356,5,6303957064,"Anyone who has read my review of 'Village of the Damned' on the MovieKids site, will have gathered that I do have a bit of a 'thing' about Martin Stephens, the young child star of this film.  Hardly surprising, when having experienced that totally controlled, (for such a young actor), icy malevolence he brought to his role there, and then to discover that he is only just one year older (13) in 'The Innocents', I find that he is exhibiting a massive and almost adult, but certainly highly mature understanding of his role as the haunted boy, Miles, who is apparently possessed by the spirit of his dead mentor, (or tormentor!), Peter Quint, the former gamekeeper.
This man, according to Henry James, the author of the novel,'The Turn of the Screw', from which this story is taken, 'made free' with the boy!  What are we to deduce?  Is this the way things are or were?  Who knows!  Is Miles truly the 'wicked boy', sent home from his boarding school for 'being a bad influence' on the other boys, or is he just a sad, tormented youngster who is being led to believe, by his possibly misled and obsessive governess, that he is indeed evil?  Are he and his sister even the victims of paedophilic abuse?  Or - the willing partners in an adult game they are consciously embracing and desperately want to be a part of?
Whatever conclusion we come to, Martin Stephens, with his intelligent understanding of what he is portraying, coupled with huge acting skills gained from his previous, equally demanding two roles, provides us with a character of a boy who is both charming and extremely bright but who is also secretive and devious - and yes! - certainly highly sensual - and who is almost playfully leading the somewhat gullible Miss Giddins, (his Governess, played by the brilliant Deborah Kerr - watch out for one of the most famous - or infamous - screen kisses of all time between an adult and a child!!), a merry dance, along with his equally charming and seemingly guileless girl co-star, Pamela Franklin - young star of 'The Lion', - with his game of 'Am I - Aren't I?', `Will I - Won't I?', down the path of, for her, almost demented paranoia.
Have I whetted your appetite for this unique production?  I hope so! Get it - see it - and you will almost certainly be beguiled by this, the first outing for its young Director, Jack Clayton - (very soon after to be showered with accolades for his subsequent oeuvres) - in a work of dark suspicion, adult moral dilemma - or - childhood fantasy games, playing up to the adult gallery?  Or - is it?  See for yourself!
The memory of my first viewing of this brilliant movie, in a darkened cinema of 1961, and presented by what was certainly a highly imaginative cinema projectionist, will never leave me.  However, the very same haunting experience is still there on the smaller screen and I, for one, would most certainly not be without it in my vast collection of classic movies.",1238976000,3,2931,4.58508604206501
773357,2,6303957064,Not a great movie. I suppose it was considered good for its time. The acting was horrible as were many movies in 1961 I suppose. I was bored with it halfway through. I love old movies...but this one's not on my list of favorites. I don't recommend it.,1229385600,4,251,4.25
773507,5,6303957064,"[This review is part of my 31 days of Halloween series.]

There are certain aspects of this b&w puzzler that remind me of THE OTHERS with Nichole Kidman. The audience is presented a landscape with many undertones linking between the world of the living and the shadowland of those who have passed over. Deborah Kerr is outstanding as the repressed Victorian type governess. She is hired to take complete charge of 2 children who live in an appropriately gloomy mansion in the country. The man who hires her is the very reluctant guardian (Michael Redgrave) of the pair. He makes it clear that he is not interested in any future personal involvement. So, Kerr finds herself more or less stranded with the rather odd (and uncomfortably close) brother & sister. There is only a rather nice--and rather simple--housekeeper to provide any kind of adult companionship.

But are they really alone?

What unfolds is an extremely intelligent script & expert direction crafting a subtle yet gripping story of love, betrayal, psychic manipulation, death & suicide.

When this film was initially released in Great Britain it did so with an astonishing ""X"" rating. Apparently the movie earned this repressive tag because of one scene where the boy displays seductive behavior to his confused governess--or is it really the boy, or a spirit acting through him? Anyway, the scene was considered so forbidden that the child actor was not allowed to see the entire script & was given very little in the way of motivation. Surprisingly the scene is very effective--and really isn't ""naughty"" at all.

This is a b&w classic--and the fact that it is black & white sets up the atmosphere of shadow & light, misty gardens & an all round gothic sensation.

Valerie Bertinellie produced & starred in a 1980's YV version that was extremely good on all points. Of course it was in color, but this version maintained the atmospheric ""feel"" of the story.

Anyway, I was quite surprised to see that this movie succeeds in preserving that ambiguity, and in fact is one of the best translations of novella to screen I've ever seen, in terms of fidelity to the source, both its plot and its more amorphous literary qualities.

We begin with an announcement that this was shot in cinemascope, and boy, it sure was. What a wide screen--and it's going to be well-used throughout. We note that Pamela Franklin--who later went on to be in Bette Davis' The Nanny, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, and Satan's Scool for Girls--is here as one of the children, Flora. This is her first film. We also see that the screenplay here was co-written by Truman Capote! The direction is by Jack Clayton, who went on to do the horrific Something Wicked This Way Comes. During the credits we see a woman's praying hands, later moving up to see her face as she seems to be in a kind of ecstasy. She says ""What I want to do is to save the children, not destroy them."" Hmm, I guess that is a good principle for any new babysitter to keep in mind.

We join this woman, Miss. Giddens [sounds like a giddy kitten? Such are the strangely evocative name choices of Henry James] as she is interviewed for a position as a governess to a boy and a girl, Miles and Flora. Their Uncle suddenly inherited them, and, being an actively ""social"" man on the London nightlife scene, he has no place for his life for children. He makes it quite clear that if Miss Giddens is to take the job, she will effectively become their parent, and that she should ""Never trouble me. Never! Never! Never!"" She will be replacing the last governess, Miss. Jessel, who died. Giddens accepts.

She is taken to the house, and is surprised to find it an enormous English manor, with beautiful gardens, woods and lakes, and massive rooms. She meets Flora in the middle of a stream, and takes to her immediately. Miles is still at school. She also meets Mrs. Grose, the housekeeper, and the only other person at the house. The first time Giddens arrives on the grounds, she is hearing a mysterious voice that no one else hears. As she's putting Flora to bed, she hears something again, and Flora tells her ""We must pretend we didn't hear it. That's what Mrs. Grose says. That way we won't imagine things.""

SPOILERS > > >
Giddens receives word that Miles is to be expelled from school and will be returning home. It appears that he has caused injury to others and some other kids are afraid of him. Soon he arrives, and is as seemingly well-behaved and articulate as Flora. He is quite frank that he understands his Uncle doesn't care in the slightest about him and Flora. During this time Giddens has continued to ask questions about the former governess, Miss Jessell and learned that Flora loved her. She's also found out that there used to be a man about--a low-class caretaker or some such--Mr. Quint.

Giddens is out walking one day when she enters a long reverie--she becomes aware of certain sounds, certain visions around the gardens draw her attention, the sun flares--and then suddenly she sees a man atop the tower of the house. It is quite noticeable how the flare of light leads into her seeing the man. Later she is snooping and finds a photo of a man. Not long after, she sees him right outside the window! She describes him--and it's Mr. Quint! But he's dead! It's interesting to note that in the novella, she actually finds the photo after she sees him, but it's reversed in the film.

Now, I have my own interpretation of the film and novella, so if you venture on I'm going to describe that way of looking at the story. I think it's all in Giddens' head. I don't think there are any ghosts. One of the ways that is conveyed is the long reverie and light flare that leads into Gidden's first vision of Quint--the director is telling us that she isn't seeing clearly, that we are entering her subjective state. The reason it was smart of them to put her seeing the portrait before she ""sees"" Quint outside is to suggest that she spun it out of her imagination. She tells Mrs. Grose that she saw Quint, and makes the simple woman believe her--we are starting to have a case of mass hysteria.

Grose tells Giddens that Miles used to love Quint, used to ""trot after him like a little dog."" She has another vision--I think again introduced by the flare effect--of Miss Jessel standing across the pond. She tells Grose that Flora saw her too--although it's important to note that upon questioning, it turns out Flora never said so, but Giddens just ""knows"" it. Before you know it, Giddens is sure that the ghosts of the former caretakers have a conspiracy, and that the kids are in on it. If you are paying careful attention--it's the same way in the novella--she has no evidence for any aspect of the whole elaborate story she tells, it's just something she ""knows."" Still, if you're not paying very close attention to either, it can seem like she's telling the truth, and that there really are ghosts. There are many, many people out there who think there are ghosts in the book. This was the reason for the essay we had to write on this book in high school: this was my introduction to the unreliable narrator.

Giddens worms out of Grose that Jessel and Quint had an affair, and that Quint beat Jessel, but she loved him, and would come crawling on her hands and knees. They would leave the doors open during broad daylight and there were ""rooms used as though they were dark woods..."" which I think we're supposed to take to mean that they would have sex during the day with the doors open, the implication being that the kids probably saw. See, and you thought Henry James was so stuffy. Every new detail Giddens learns about the former caretakers adds new corners to her story about what the ghosts want, which is to ""reach each other by entering the souls of the children."" In every instance, she just whips this stuff straight out of her mind; we never see any instance of any of it happening, and no other character ever sees [or, to Gidden's mind, will admit to seeing] the ghosts. The tension continues to mount [hence the title The Turn of the Screw] and soon Gidden is convinced that the two kids are allied with the ghosts against her and Grose, and are ""calculating liars."" It's not too long before she tragically gasps ""the children are possessed.""

By now Giddens is certifiably looney, and if you get what's going on, it can start to become a little tedious and repetitive. I found this to be the case with the novella as well. She's always leading the kids into saying something, asking ""Who were you talking to? Who were you thinking about? Say his name!"" It, as James would say ""comes to a crisis"" when Flora is playing outside in the rain and Giddens sees Miss Jessel. She terrorizes Flora is demanding that she acknowledge that she sees the ghost. Of course she doesn't, but the kids and Mrs. Grose have been trying to be polite and open-minded. By this time Mrs. Grose has had enough and told Giddens she's flippin' crazy and more of a danger to the kids than anyone, but Giddens pulls rank and sends her and Flora away. She thinks that if she and Miles are alone together he will admit to the influence of ghosts.

HERE COMES THE ENDING: It reaches a climax in the greenhouse and back yard, where Miles, who is through being polite, says ""you try to make us admit things that aren't true,"" and that she's ""a damned hussy! A dirty-minded old hag!"" Miles hits his head and apparently has a heart attack and dies--evidence to Miss Giddens that his life was destroyed in the struggle for his soul. She believes that in death he has been saved--she killed him, and believes that she set him free! You will notice that the film ends with the sound of birds singing, after it began with the sound of children singing.

It was one of the best literary adaptations I've ever seen, in that it retains not just the events of the book, but the ENTIRE subtext and ambiguity. It also precisely captures the way I visualized the novella when I read it. It's limitations, however, are the limitations of the story: if nothing is happening, then nothing is happening, and nothing happening can become a little wearying after a while. But it's still a diabolically clever idea and is done extremely well here.

The trailer for this film is breathlessly hysterical and contains the description: ""the most controversial concept in human relationships ever presented on screen!"" It's a little funny, as I would think most people would walk out having no idea that they had just witnessed a controversial concept in human relationships--let alone THE most controversial one. The disc also includes an amusing trailer for The Phantom of the Paradise that doesn't even include the name of the film, one for Legend of Hell House [looks uber-trashy] and a modern movie called Cabinet of Caligari. They're presented in the context of ""if you liked The Innocents..."" but they all look to be of radically different sensibilities. Maybe what they mean is ""if you like movies that are on DVD, you'll love....""",1192406400,12,9417,4.565680473372781
773514,3,6303957064,"I read Henry James's book, ""The Turn of the Screw,"" for extra credit in high school, and since longed for the day I could see the film version, which at the time was unavailable.  Then, one lucky day I was flipping channels and was able to catch the tail end of the film, when Miss Giddons has her alone time with Myles.  I was really impressed by the creepiness, the impact of Deborah Kerr's acting, and the rather shocking content, which I'm sure was wild in '61, and suprising to me.  So, I was able lately to see the film in its entirety, and I remain convinced of its creepiness; the way it never chooses a side as to whether Miss Giddons is crazy or there really are ghosts; how it builds up tension and never really gives a moment of relaxation.  I remembered, ""The Others"" when I saw this film, and can see how much influence it must have had on Amenebar's film, most notably Nicole Kidman moving down a dark corridor by candlelight in nearly the same way Ms. Kerr does here.  I find fault more with the story than with its adaptation, which was always a little too suggestive and never overt enough for me.  I wanted there to be some hint in the way of whether or not the kids were in on it.  But as far an adaptation goes, this is definitely one of the strongest, and far more entertaining, for my money, than James's book.",1191801600,14,1333,4.286852589641434

Does the houskeeper know more than she lets on? How about the uncle? Where, if anywhere, does he fit in.

I was wrong as this movie creates such an atmosphere of horror that I was on the edge of my seat throughout my viewing even though I knew full well where the storyline was taking me.  The film is perfectly cast particularly in regard to the children who play Miles and Flora.  Deborah Kerr is perhaps quite a bit older than the young governess James wrote about but her restrained proper prettiness is perfect for the role.  Michael Redgrave has a brief part at the beginning as the children's charming, selfish uncle and one has to wonder if guilt and/or fear instead of just pure self-indulgence make him so eager to completely give up responsibility for his niece, nephew and his family's incredible estate, Bly.  The magnificent house and grounds of Bly are almost another character with the estate's vastness and beautiful statue laden grounds used to spooky effect throughout the movie.  We, of course, just get glimpses of the actors playing Miss Jessell and Peter Quint but their appearances are so perfectly presented that in each of these glimpses I felt a chill down my spine.  The sound design is superb as bird calls, the squeak of chalk, children's laughter and disembodied voices enhance the mood and the music box song Flora sings and dances with is truly haunting.  Like the novella the movie is very ambiguous as to whether this is a ghost story, a tale of possession or simply a portrait of a repressed woman psychologically unraveling.  Worth watching more than once to catch all the subtle sights and sounds of horror as well as to help clarify your view of what this story is really all about.",1189209600,3,1819,4.677115987460815

The song that the child sings in the beginning of the film (about a weeping willow) still haunts me. It is sweet and disturbing at the same time.

The ending devastated me. I finished this movie frightened and sad and shaken up. That's the magic of the movies: to move you, and take you to unexpected places.

This film makes a good companion with the equally excellent 1963 film ""The Haunting"", which always makes the hair on my neck stand up. (I never, ever want to know what is behind that door.)

The dvd ""The Innocents"" provides a crisp, clean widescreen image, and great sound. (If you prefer your picture shrunk to a square fullscreen, that version is on side two of the dvd.)

773616,5,6303957064,"Jack Clayton's ""The Innocents,"" an adaptation of Henry James' ""The Turn of the Screw,"" must be ranked as one of the greatest cinematic ghost stories of all time. There are two essential keys to its greatness. One is that Clayton and his screenwriters, Truman Capote and William Archibald, understood totally that in telling a ghost story, less is more--that is, a truly horrifying story is created not in gore, but in the audience's minds. The second, and more important, key is that Clayton, Capote and Archibald maintain James' delicate, uneasy balance, so that the audience is never sure whether the ghosts are appearing in truth, or solely in the imagination of Miss Giddins (Deborah Kerr). From the beginning, as the wealthy, self-centered uncle played by Michael Redgrave interviews Miss Giddins for the post of governess, you notice the breathless, ever-so-slightly neurotic replies she gives to his questions, particularly when she stresses her love of children, and wonder precisely what kind of woman she is. In the same vein, the behavior of the children Miles (Martin Stephens) and Flora (Pamela Franklin) can be taken as innocent or all-too-knowing. Meanwhile, the apparitions of Peter Quint and Miss Jessel occur just often enough, and just unexpectedly enough, to keep our hearts pounding at top speed. Every aspect of ""The Innocents"" can fairly be described as perfect, from Kerr's delicately calibrated performance, to the cinematography of the great Freddie Francis, to the haunting music of Georges Auric, intimate of Satie and Poulenc. The extras on the DVD are almost nil, but the film itself is more than worth the price. ""The Innocents"" is one of those chilling, mesmerizing cinematic masterpieces you can watch again and again.",1180310400,3,1751,5.212765957446808

Before long, Miss Giddens begins to see ghosts of the previous governess and her lover, the groundskeeper. She learns of the house's dark past from the maid.

What is interesting about this movie is that none of the characters tells the same story. The viewer is solving the puzzle right along with the actors on the screen. This makes it all the more interesting and chilling to watch, because one is so invested in the plot.

In some ways, this is just another old scary house thriller. In others, it stands on its own as an example of how great a horror movie can be. It uses history, psychology, and very simple tricks to create the suspense. However, the tricks used are not typical. There is no loud pulsating soundtrack, only simple melodies like a humming child or a tinkling music box.

Sheesh, this thing was all ambiguity (which I endorse, but at some point, there has to be some clarification as to what's going on) - the 'end' of the film is not an ending - it jus' stops - and one of the children has dropped dead - why? Ms. Kerr's (by other reviewers much 'lauded') performance is overly theatrical in the extreme - is she losing her mind? is she completely normal? she acts far too convinced of herself to hint at the possibility of the former - the result being that the viewer is left scratching his/her head, wondering what the hell's going on... and the soundtrack (also described as actually frightening) was laughable - apparently reverb was something the sound feller had just discovered for himself and went all out - to be fair, I don't know what kind of an impression the film would've made on me had I seen it for the first time back in 1961 - no doubt numerous members of the film audience then were indeed 'Innocents' compared to these days of explosions and gore. And there were moments of high suspense - definitely - but to have the film simply be cut off, like a slice of salami... Impertinence! *G*

- apparently, the original James' tale leaves unresolved as to whether the governess was losing her mind, or were the children indeed 'possessed'...?

And where's the ending? (say, another 5-10 minutes to tie up any number of loose ends... what happens to Flora after she went to London? what role does the uncle play really? what does he really know?) - an incomplete and frustrating work... but I can imagine that back in 1961, seeing this in a movie theatre, this could cause some chills... I was born in '68, so am a 'latecomer' in that regard...

An interesting cross-reference that I see - some elements that appear here, even specific questions, are used (I think) to much greater effect in Peter Medak's 1979 intelligent 'chiller', ""The Changeling"" with George C. Scott - the search for the source of mysterious sounds up up up through an old house - finding a music box in the attic - the question: ""How did she/you die?"" ---

Befriending the well-meaning housekeeper Mrs. Grose (Meg Jenkins), Miss Giddens soon discovers that the seemingly harmless relationship between bother and sister is much, much more serious and sinister than meets the eye.

The first and most satisfying aspect of ""The Innocents"" is the undeniable quality with which every aspect of the production is handled. On the acting front, Kerr, Stephens and Franklin give powerhouse performances, whole and plausible and thoroughly riveting. I won't even refer to the latter pair as 'child actors' - these kids are so good that they equal in every respect the performances given by their adult costars. Kerr is a beautiful, winsome and righteous-without-indignation Miss Giddens, and her skill at keeping the viewer guessing while maintaining the Julie Andrews-like facade of goodness and kindness is consummate.

Direction by Jack Clayton (who, as a Joan Crawfordophile, I had only ever come across directing ""The Story of Esther Costello"" before - a good movie, sure, but simply not in this league) is superlative - in his hands, the screenplay, which could have been filmed at a much slower pace, becomes an energetic and charismatic locomotive of thrills and genuine scares. His use of audio is extremely remarkable for the period, too - and the experimental nature of the mixed dialogue samples and the haunting theme tune make a perfect, perfect accompaniment to the starkly gothic visuals.

The screenplay is great, the dialogue comes thick and fast and keeps us quite literally riveted from start to finish. Of course, the powerhouse performances by the three lead characters could have made up for most things, but William Archibald, in adapting Henry James' classic tale ""The Turn Of The Screw"", has created an enthralling script with a minimum of dull moments.

And here's the real kick: this is one of the most effective, genuinely frightening films I've seen for years. The last movie I remember seeing that unsettled me this much was Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"", and that's real praise: I'm a huge fan of horror, and have seen so many movies - but ""The Innocents"" will stay with me forever. I can't give you examples because I might give the plot away, and I really want for you to experience this movie for yourself, but please, trust me: this is well worth your time and money.

DVD conversion is very good: although the sound is simply mono the print is crisp and clean, and picture quality is very high. Special features don't amount to much but what the hell, the feature itself would be cheap at twice the price.

773724,5,6303957064,"Produced and directed by Jack Clayton (Room at the Top, The Great Gatsby), The Innocents (1961), based on the short story ""The Turn of the Screw"" by Henry James, was adapted for the screen by William Archibald (I Confess), Truman Capote (Breakfast at Tiffany's, In Cold Blood), and John Mortimer (""Rumpole of the Bailey"") and photographed by Freddie Francis (The Elephant Man, Dune).  Starring in the film is Deborah Kerr (From Here to Eternity, The King and I, An Affair to Remember), the only actress, to date, to have been nominated for six Academy Awards and never to have won (she received an honorary Oscar for her achievements in 1994).  Also appearing is Megs Jenkins (Oliver!), Martin Stephens (Village of the Damned), Michael Redgrave (The Lady Vanishes), Peter Wyngarde (Night of the Eagle), and Pamela Franklin (The Legend of Hell House, The Food of the Gods), in her silver screen debut.

As the film begins we meet a middle-aged woman named Miss Giddens (Kerr), who's in the process of interviewing for a position as governess for two, young orphaned children left in the charge of their rather well to do uncle (Michael Redgrave).  Seems the man, a somewhat dedicated bachelor, has neither the time nor desire to look after the children, so he's looking for someone he can give complete authority of the children to, removing himself as far from the burden as possible.  Miss Giddens accepts the position and soon finds herself whisked away to a large, lonely country estate in the English countryside, populated by a handful of servants including Mrs. Grose (Jenkins) and the man's niece Flora (Franklin)...turns out the nephew Miles (Stephens), is currently away at boarding school.  After Miss Giddens settles in, she learns Miles is coming home after having been dismissed (i.e. expelled) from school under curious circumstances, but after finally meeting him, he, or his sister for that matter, seem hardly the type to cause any trouble.  As time goes by one can't help notice a subtle weirdness in the children given the fact they're constantly whispering to each other and they, especially Miles, seem to speak and act beyond their years.  As the strangeness persists, Miss Giddens begins asking questions about the previous governess, a woman named Miss Jessel, and learns of an `improper' relationship Miss Jessel had with a valet named Quint (who was described as being handsome and obscene), both of whom were close to the children and both of whom died under mysterious circumstances.  She also learns Quint, an abusive sort, had complete control over the estate while his master was away, and often abused his authority in various ways (no one seemed all that broken up when Quint was found dead, except for Miss Jessel).  Anyway, Miss Giddens soon comes to believe the children, given their close relationship to Miss Jessel and Quint, have become corrupted in someway, and their increasingly odd actions not necessarily their own...

As far as gothic ghost stories, The Innocents is one heck of a humdinger.  If you're looking for atmosphere, this film has it in spades...a huge, lonely Victorian house complete with creaking doors, clattering windows, squeaking floorboards, flickering candlelight, ethereal voices wafting in on the wind, shadowy corners, and so much more.  From the moment we first enter the house there's a persuasive sense of creepiness, one that continues to grow as the story goes on...throw in a couple of spooky children and the occasional apparition and you've got most everything you need for a frightful cinematic experience, the kind rarely enjoyed in this day and age given the heavy reliance on computer generated effects.  There are a number of aspects about this feature I thought immaculate, including the performances, the direction, the photography, eerie music, and the writing.  I thought both Deborah Kerr and Martin Stephens (who played Miles) did a wonderful job.  I really appreciated Kerr's character in that she was fleshed out enough for us to understand why she didn't get while the getting good.  In another film we, the audience, might find it questionable why a character wouldn't remove herself from a situation she thought fraught with peril but here it's clear Kerr's character's motivation, along with her belief that the children aren't to blame for their situation or held accountable for some of their wicked behavior.  Both the children came off as spooky, but Miles more so as his manipulations and deceitful ways were less obvious (and more sinister).  I think what bothered me the most about his character was the way he'd talk to Miss Giddens.  His tone felt a little condescending at times, as if it was all some sort of game, one that he was orchestrating, his sister more or less a pawn following his lead.  The story is actually pretty simple, but that doesn't make it any less frightening (there's no, cheap `pop out' scares here).  The pacing may appear slow at times, but I found it appropriate to the creepy nature inherent within the material.  As far as flaws apparent in the production I really couldn't find any, but then I wasn't really looking.  I suppose someone could make the argument some aspects of the story weren't fully explained but I felt everything in the story, including the ambiguity, were intentional.  The best ghost stories, in my opinion, often leave one feeling unsure, asking questions that may never be answered...and it's not like anything within the story came out of left field, as if it didn't belong.  As far as endings go, this one featured a real doozy.  All in all, if you're interested in a fantastic chiller reliant heavily on solid storytelling, strong performances, and excellent production values, The Innocents will definitely fit the bill.

I thought the picture, available in both widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1) and fullscreen (1.33:1), came across clean and clear, and the audio, available in Dolby Digital stereo in English and Dolby Digital mono in Spanish, came through well.  There's not much in the way of extras except for subtitles in English and Spanish, a goofy theatrical trailer for the film, and trailers for The Cabinet of Caligari (1962), The Legend of Hell House (1973), and Phantom of the Paradise (1974).

Before long, Miss Giddens becomes convinced that the spacious estate is inhabited not only by her and the children, but also by evil spirits that mean to do harm.

The Innocents is a brilliant adaptation of Henry James's novel, The Turn of the Screw. It is one of the greatest haunting films ever made and is a movie that everyone should see. Unfortunately, it has been unavailable on VHS and DVD until this year. I've been waiting for the day it would be available since the first time I saw it in a theater in college in 1996.

The Innocents is a very scary movie and I wouldn't show it to small children. The language is clean and there is no violence, but it's terrifying nonetheless.",1161129600,2,843,4.503267973856209

If you're a foster parent, adoptive parent, teacher or therapist of a child with Reactive Attachment Disorder, this movie lays out all the triangulation, manipulatiion and ""craziness"" that comes into play.  Though the abusive caretakers are dead, they continue to ""haunt"" the children and the children channel or are possessed by them.  This is symbolic for how abused children continue to recreate the chaos and abuse they experienced from their birth parents for years and years after removal.  I could go into greater detail, but this movie would certainly make an excellent subject of study and analysis for a graduate course in psychology or social work.",1160265600,6,854,5.350746268656716
773727,3,6303957064,"The Innocents (Jack Clayton, 1961)

Jack Clayton didn't direct many films over the course of his life, but it seems as if every one of them has developed at least a cult following over the years. The Innocents is one that continues to keep its director's name alive. Based on Henry James' ""The Turn of the Screw,"" The Innocents is the story of Miss Giddens (the mighty Deborah Kerr), who takes a position as a governess to Miles (Village of the Damned's Martin Stephens) and Flora (Pamela Franklin, who went on to be a familiar TV actress, guest starring in a number of shows) after the death of their previous governess. The childrens' behavior gets somewhat odd, and Miss Giddens, with the help of her only real friend, Mrs. Grose (Oliver!'s Megs Jenkins), must determine whether the children are simply being malicious, or whether supernatural elements are afoot.

This is good stuff, a mystery/horror film that relies mostly on atmosphere to get its point across. There are some times when it crosses the line into cheesiness-- the ""eerie"" reflection of a ghost's face in the window, for example-- but there's been far, far worse in the ensuing forty-five years. Clayton did this one up right, and it deserves to be seen. *** ",1156377600,,1230,4.7924528301886795
773728,5,6303957064,"In Henry James' classic ghost story, ""The Turn of the Screw"", which has been aptly titled ""The Innocents"" for this screen version, one has to ask, who are the ""innocents""? Is it the  children, who are truly remarkable children; the new governess, the  inexperienced Miss Giddons, daughter of a Church of England vicar, in her first work outside of her home; or maybe even Mrs. Gross, the housekeeper who stays in a state of seige from the other three?

This is the best adaptation of ""The Turn of the Screw"" that I have seen and I've seen several.  It seems to have been written for Miss Kerr's talents which are considerable. She is a true innocent set down in a house where some unusual things have happened several months before.  The children are so young and innocent.  Are they being haunted by the former valet and governess, or is this all in the mind of the admirable Miss Giddons, who seems to see things no one else does...or do they?

It's all psychological...and excellent.  Beautiful scenry, wonderful costumes, edgy music and black and white cinamatography make this an excellent movie...and a whacking good ghost story.",1155168000,,1135,4.7846153846153845
773729,5,6303957064,"Take two brilliant child actors, an isolated and bewildered nanny, a spooky old house, and a lot of bone-chilling suspense, and you've got a winner.

So what does this movie lack? Gore, for one. You don't need blood and violence to scare people. What's frightening is what may or may not be around the corner, or upstairs keening in the old schoolroom, or what those children may or may NOT be talking about, secretly among themselves. What is going to spring on us out of nowhere? We stop breathing as we wait.

Technicolor, for another. Black and white makes for a spooky feel.

This movie also lacks an overused tool - an abundance of background music. There is mostly silence, which makes it eerier. The final scene is made more tragic and sickening by the lack of music, except for the birds twittering as the sun starts to rise, ironic in their idle cheeriness. What do we see as the light dawns? No violins tell us how to feel. We simply see the finality, the horrible mundaneness of the tragedy with unclouded ears.",1147478400,6,1023,4.579234972677596
773730,3,6303957064,"This will be a good movie for people who like nice locations (castle on estate), people dressed in fancy clothes, etc..

This lady is supposed to be a nanny taking care of two spoiled kids but every day her hair is meticulously arranged and she wears dresses that are 12 feet in diameter.  When she moved in she must have needed a tractor trailer just for her wardrobe.

I will admit the two child actors are very good, especially the little boy Miles.

However the lines are recited in such a way as nobody in real life could ever talk so perfectly.

There's a lot of symbolism in this movie.

The two kids had apparently been exposed to two adults who lived in the castle before but who are both now dead.  What exactly went on between the kids and the adults I don't know.

But somehow either the adults did something to the kids or their spirits are still lurking about trying to possess the kids' bodies for their own perverse desires I guess.

The nanny is sexually frustrated I guess as most nannies probably are.  So they tie this in with the male spirit taking over Miles' body and he starts kissing the nanny on the lips.

Then the nanny wants to be alone with Miles so she somehow has the authority to kick everyone else out of the castle even though she's just a nanny.  Then they are having tea and Miles puts out his hand to take the nanny's hand in his.  But instead he gives the jello rabbit on the table a nice jiggle (see the symbolism there ?).

I don't want to ruin it for the viewer but just let me say it also brings in aspects of necrophilia.

773731,5,6303957064,"""The Innocents"" stars Deborah Kerr as a governess to a wealthy Londoner's mysterious young niece and nephew in a country manor.  Their uncle leaves everything in her hands and refuses to be bothered with anything.  She soon sees apparitions, and suspects the spirits of the former governess and valet are haunting the mansion with the foul intent of possessing the children.  The children and the maid can't see the ghosts, clearly visible to the audience through Kerr's eyes, so it's ambiguous, through much of the film, whether the spirits are real or the governess is cracking up.
At the end I wasn't 100% clear on whether the horror was real or imagined, so I read the short novel it was based on, ""The Turn Of The Screw,"" by Henry James, and found that the movie was very faithful to the book, as book-to-film adaptations go.  The book also maintains some ambiguity until the end, but the end is much clearer.
At any rate the stark appearance of ghosts is effective and seems to me, in this 1961 film, a forerunner of the technique that made several modern horror films effective, such as ""The Ring.""  I also liked the way they never say ""ghosts"" or ""spirits,"" but always refer to them as ""horrors,"" or ""abominations,"" or some other indirect reference like ""the others."" This is also consistent with the book, and the latter phrase, among other things, aroused suspicion that ""The Innocents"" indirectly inspired ""The Others,"" and perhaps a few others.",1141603200,3,1456,4.808

What a dolt!  This movie did not scare me.  Neither did ""The Exorcist"" nor ""The Haunting"" (the version with Julie Harris, I never saw another).  But it was fascinating, interesting, a work of great imagination.  The time (100 minutes) just flew by, there wasn't a slow or dull place in it.  Except, though she was as interesting as everything else in this flick and very warm and believable in both capacities, a good actress, the housekeeper's part was I thought rather badly written.  Her sudden conversion to total belief from total skepticism and then back again was kind of dumb.  I found Miles unconvincing.  And I only liked him as a character, as an actor, as a person during the confrontation.  ""The Turn of the Screw"" (and ""The Haunting of Hill House"" for that matter) is one of my favorite books, and I thought this movie did it justice to a gnat's whisker.",1140912000,4,1081,4.583333333333333

773857,5,6303957064,"Total darkness, a child's sweet voice begins to sing a nursery rhyme like song, hauntingly beautiful, yet somehow disturbing. This is how the ghostly 1961 classic ""The Innocents"" begins.  Deborah Kerr took the role of child loving governess, Miss Giddons, and makes it her own.  The children, Flora (Pamela Franklin) and Miles (Martin Stephens) are especially chilling as the possessed innocents, who are under Miss Giddon's care.  Arriving at the estate on the heels of two deaths of the estate's grounds keeper, Quint, and the children's former governess, Miss Jessel.  Eventually Miss Giddons discovers the two were not only lovers, but were dementedly open with their acts of lusts before the children.  The children speak with grown up attitudes and are always whispering and acting in odd and mysterious ways.  Childhood games become sinister and compelling, such as the hide and seek game which produces the ghostly apparition of the deceased Miss Jessel, floating down a darkened hallway.  The discovery of a music box in the attic unveils the ever-familiar tune that the children are humming, singing, or playing on the piano.  Miss Giddons tries reaching out to the children, especially Miles, but is taken aback by the extreme possession that the dead lovers have seemingly taken them.  There are two memorable scenes that will haunt you after you've viewed this gothic masterpiece.  The first is the ghostly appearance of Quint, outside on the terrace, with a demonic scowl on his face as he stares through the glass paned door at Miss Giddons.  The second is the haunting tune of the music box playing as Flora dances to the audience of her dearly departed Miss Jessel, whose dark figure can be seen out on the lake.  ""The Innocents"" is dripping with a haunting atmosphere, dark and mysterious apparitions, and loaded with a sophistication that is sorely missing from today's cinema fare.",1137715200,10,1901,5.077170418006431
773858,5,6303957064,"THE INNOCENTS is based on Henry James' classic gothic novella ""The Turn of the Screw"".  The story recounts one Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr), a young governess who has just been offered her first big job, as teacher and companion to two young children at a country estate.  Their mysterious Uncle (Michael Redgrave) makes the offer too good to resist and Miss Giddens excitedly travels to Bly House, to start her new job.

At first everything seems too good to be true; Flora (Pamela Franklin) and Miles (Martin Stephens) are wonderful children, displaying a level of maturity and temperament which belies their age, and Mrs Grose, (Megs Jenkins) the housekeeper, is a wise and friendly aid.  But life at Bly House takes a sinister turn.  Miss Giddens begins to see haunting images and ghosts.  The children also begin to act strangely: Flora becomes distant and Miles begins to flirt with Miss Giddens, at one point kissing her forcefully on the mouth.  Everything seems to hark back to the previous governess Miss Jessel (Clytie Jessop), who died under mysterious circumstances, and the strange relationship she had with the deceased former squier Alan Quint (Peter Wyngarde).  Miss Giddens becomes convinced that the children have been a party to this evil, and attempts to save them - and herself - from the same fate.

If one wanted a Freudian analysis, one could say that the seductive Alan appeared to help the repressed Miss Giddens confront her long-buried sexual urges, but you can glean whatever you wish from the ambiguous material.  The performances from the entire company are superb.  I agree that the performance of Martin Stephens is amazing (and it must have been difficult for him to have played the confronting kissing scene with Kerr).  The scenes between Stephens and Deborah Kerr are eerie and full of tension.  Likewise, young Pamela Franklin (who would later make acclaimed appearances in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" and ""The Legend of Hell House"") makes the role of Flora one that the audience completely falls in love with.  Deborah Kerr, attired in a beautiful wardrobe of Victorian hoopskirt creations by Motley, delivers one of her greatest performances, wonderfully-plotted and realised as Miss Giddens slowly becomes transformed by paranoia.

The new DVD edition from Fox presents the DVD in it's original CinemaScope ratio, capturing the moody and innovative photography by Freddie Francis (a fullscreen version is featured on the flipside).  Extra features are limited to the trailer, as well as trailers for other thrillers from Fox: ""The Legend of Hell House"", ""Phantom of the Paradise"" and ""The Cabinet of Caligari"".",1134864000,13,2655,5.111111111111111

The child actors are amazing and quite convincing in their parts.  It is never completely clear whether the children are intentionally wicked, totally innocent, or the victims of supernatural evil.

Sets, cinematography and costuming are used to utmost advantage (Note in the beginning of the film Kerr's dresses are frillier and prettier while as her character is sucked deeper and deper into the mires of psychosis her dresses resemble mourning weeds.)

Deborah Kerr stars as the governess who becomes convinced her young charges are possessed by evil. Spooky, yet based on hard-earned Freudian fear, the film possesses an eerie old estate, haunted gardens, thunder and lightning ravaged nights, and ghosts so alluring, it seems a waste to write them off as imaginings. James' novella of sexual repression and conflicts between science and religion, is brought to the screen in all it's psychological intelligence while never abandoning it's haunted house appeal. The movie was filmed with subdued shadowing around the edges, giving it a spacious, ghosts-in-the-attic cinematic effect. The screenplay is by William Archibald, who wrote the successful Broadway play this film is based on, and Truman Capote, ( Breakfast at Tiffany's, In Cold Blood). The bad news is the shabby presentation of this classic movie finally available on DVD in 2005. Double sided disc offers both wide-screen and full screen versions, but the sound is terminally television, and the extra feature consists of one, (one!) insulting theatrical trailer which touts the movie as if ""It Came From Outer Space"".

773975,5,6303957064,"""There has never been a ghost story created especially for the adult movie-goer until 'The Innocents'."" .... That's a direct quote from the Original Theatrical Trailer of ""The Innocents"", which is a black-and-white spook-fest from the year 1961 that ranks very high on my list of ""Best Scary Movies Of All Time"".

Deborah Kerr is simply magnificent as ""Miss Giddens"", the newly-hired governess who has been assigned the task of looking after two young orphaned children (""Flora"" and ""Miles"") at a large, remote country estate in England.

Strange occurrences begin to manifest after Miss Giddens takes charge of young Flora and Miles, with the governess gradually beginning to sense that evil forces are surrounding the children.

""The Innocents"" is filled with a level of eeriness and mystery that should satisfy any lover of horror flicks. It's an eeriness and creepiness that seeps in through the cracks, instead of having the viewer being hammered over the head with CGI-created shocks and overdone amounts of bloodshed. No gore is present here -- just a good old-fashioned type ghost/horror tale from the pre-CGI days.

The two children in the story are portrayed exquisitely by Pamela Franklin and Martin Stephens. Pamela was age 11 when she filmed ""The Innocents"". This was her very first motion-picture appearance. And quite an impressive debut it is.

The 13-year-old Martin Stephens had already been seen in several movies by the time he made ""The Innocents"" (a total of ten pre-1961 film roles dating back to his first, ""The Divided Heart"", in 1954).

Martin, as ""Miles"", fully embodies the part. During several of his scenes, it's fairly easy to believe that this young boy has been possessed by some evil outside force of some kind. I'm always quite amazed when I see young children playing very complicated characters in motion pictures. And it's all the more impressive when a child actor can give a performance that any Hollywood veteran could very easily be envious of (as Martin Stephens has done in this film).

How the movie's producers and writers are able to extract such a rich, multi-layered performance out of a 13-year-old or an 11-year-old is something I've always had quite a bit of admiration for.

At one point in the film, ""Master Miles"" recites several stanzas from a macabre poem. He speaks the following lines with a certain ominous quality that fits the film's underlying supernatural tone nicely. It's one of my favorite scenes in the film, and normally good for at least a replay or two when watching the DVD. I just love this poem:

""What shall I sing to my lord from my window?
What shall I sing, for my lord will not stay?
What shall I sing, for my lord will not listen?
Where shall I go, for my lord is away?

Whom shall I love when the moon is arisen?
Gone is my lord, and the grave is his prison.

What shall I say when my lord comes a-calling?
What shall I say when he knocks on my door?

What shall I say when his feet enter softly,
Leaving the marks of his grave on my floor?

Enter my lord, come from your prison.
Come from your grave, for the moon is arisen.""

The final act of the movie is likely to take some first-time viewers of the film by surprise. In my opinion, it is the perfect dramatic ending to a very good motion picture.

""The Innocents"" premiered in movie theaters on December 25th, 1961, and made its most-welcome debut on DVD-Video on September 6th, 2005. The DVD version from Fox Home Entertainment is a million times better than the VHS videotape variant that was issued by Fox several years earlier (mainly due to the fact that the VHS contained only a dreadful Pan-&-Scan print in Full-Frame 1.33:1). The DVD is two-sided, and also has a Full-Frame copy of the film on one side. But anyone wanting to see the whole, beautifully-photographed film in its intended Widescreen ""CinemaScope"" ratio of 2.35:1 will want to watch Side B, which contains a nice-looking Anamorphic Widescreen DVD print of ""The Innocents"".

(But just exactly why the far-superior Widescreen version has been relegated to the ""B"" side of the disc is, indeed, a bit of a mystery to me. The P&S edition should always rank second, IMO. But, I suppose it's not really a matter that's worth getting all bent out of shape over. At least there's Widescreen on the disc someplace.)

A few blemishes still occupy this disc's Widescreen print; but the video anomalies are kept to a minimum and are not a detriment to the overall viewing experience at all. I had never seen this film in its original Widescreen format before getting this disc. It's a genuine treat to be able to own it now via such a well-rendered Widescreen DVD version.

DVD-Video has been a godsend for so many motion pictures -- movies that had only been available on home video through inferior ""modified aspect ratio"" abominations for many years. But DVD has rescued a lot of old films from the dustbins of movie-studio vaults -- restoring many old-time favorites and making them look nearly brand-new once again (and in the proper Widescreen ratios where applicable).

I recently read where it could easily have cost the avid movie collector, in pre-DVD days, upwards of $20,000 to build a movie library consisting of just a handful of films by purchasing duplicate film prints of certain motion pictures. While today, thanks to these compact little devices called DVDs, the same film library can be obtained for a mere fraction of that exorbitant price tag -- and with the films looking just as good as they did when they debuted in theaters decades ago (sometimes even better). A remarkable Digital era we reside in currently....isn't it?

This DVD features two different soundtrack options -- an English Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo track (which was re-mixed from the film's original Mono); plus a Spanish audio track as well (in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono).

It would have been an added plus if this disc could have also contained the original English Mono soundtrack as heard in theaters back in late 1961 and early 1962. Instead, a Stereo re-mix has been employed here as the only English audio track.

Optional subtitles can be shown on screen in either English or Spanish.

The DVD Menus are simple, easy, static, non-animated, and music-free. Perfect. .... Choices from the Main Menu screen (on both sides of the disc) offer up: ""Play Feature"", ""Scene Selection"" (28 Chapters), ""Language Selection"", and ""Special Features"".

Bonus supplements take the form of some Theatrical Trailers only. The trailer for ""The Innocents"" is along for this DVD ride (always a welcome addition to any movie release on Digital Disc). This trailer, which sports a run time of 2:50, has survived in excellent condition for its premiere on DVD. It is presented here in its original Widescreen ratio of 2.35:1 (Anamorphic too). The audio is a tad scratchy though (in DD 2.0 Mono).

Plus: Fox provides three Bonus Trailers as well (via a separate Menu selection from the ""Special Features"" Sub-Menu, marked ""Fox Flix""). There are trailers for a trio of other spooky (and ultra-strange) pieces of cinema: ""The Cabinet Of Caligari"", ""The Legend Of Hell House"", and ""Phantom Of The Paradise"".

""Caligari"" (a 1962 flick), which I had never heard of prior to seeing the trailer on this DVD, looks like a really bizarre film indeed. Off-the-wall antics abound, per this trailer. It was written by Robert Bloch, who wrote Alfred Hitchcock's masterwork, ""Psycho"", which was released two years previously. I can tell just from the 2-minute trailer, however, that some very nice B&W cinematography went into that movie (which was filmed in a 2.35:1 Widescreen format, with the trailer being shown in that ratio here as well). Darkness and shadowy images are abundant and readily-noticeable just by viewing the trailer. Whether or not the whole movie is worth sitting through, I cannot say. But the trailer is intriguing at any rate.

""Hell House"" (from 1973) is a darn good film, though (written by horror master Richard Matheson). It stars, coincidentally, an all-grown-up Pamela Franklin (who plays little ""Flora"" in ""The Innocents"").

""Phantom Of The Paradise"" (1974) takes first prize for ""weirdness"" among this batch of three movie trailers. If you like really strange stuff -- ""Phantom"" might be right up your alley. It stars songwriter Paul Williams, and was directed by Brian DePalma, who went on to direct two top-notch scare-fests in ""Carrie"" (1976) and ""Dressed To Kill"" (1980).

To tell the truth, after watching this trailer for ""Phantom Of The Paradise"", I still don't have a really good grasp of the plot of the movie. But there's some really freaky stuff going on in that picture, that's for sure. :-)

Fun bonus trailers, though -- all three of them. I like it when the studios decide to add a few extra theatrical trailers to their DVDs. They're usually pretty fun to watch, even if the films being advertised appear to be a tad bit on the 'subpar' side. Many times, however, some very good films are presented as ""Bonus Trailers"" on DVDs -- films that I might not otherwise have ever been exposed to.

-----------------

A Final 'Innocent' Word........

""The Innocents"" is likely to reel you in with its tale of ghostly images and otherworldly happenings -- not to mention the above-average cast as well. In the same grand ""old school"" tradition of spooky suspense-laden films like ""The Uninvited"" (1944), ""The Spiral Staircase"" (1946), and ""The Haunting"" (1963) -- ""The Innocents"" works hard at keeping the viewer firmly on a bed of pins and needles throughout its 100-minute duration. And, in my mind, it succeeds admirably in that endeavor.",1128384000,11,9633,4.88296568627451
773976,5,6303957064,"...only Henry James knew for sure! Miss Giddens, a rather ""sheltered"" governess, is convinced that her two young charges are possessed by the spirits of her predecessor Miss Jessel and her lover, a cruel valet named Quint, in a lonely and sprawling mansion in the English countryside. Written in 1897 and set in 1850s England, Henry James' ""The Turn of the Screw"" is a cleverly written (tho somewhat torturous) novella which was required reading for schoolchildren like myself in the 1960s. James never divulged whether his bedeviled heroine actually SAW ghosts, or if they were simply the externalization of her own neuroses. Scripted by William Archibald and Truman Capote, a 1950s TV production of ""The Innocents"" starred Ingrid Bergman (I would love to see that!), and then filmmaker Jack Clayton (""Room at the Top"") filmed his version of the tale in 1961. Stunningly photographed by Freddie Francis in black and white, ""The Innocents"" depicts its disturbing visions of ghosts often in bright, broad daylight, such as a rose garden, or in a gazebo by a lake. The lovely Deborah Kerr plays the role of Miss Giddens with a slightly edgy self-consciousness (perfect for a sexually repressed daughter of a country parson) that grows into an absolutely manic frenzy that could either be absolute madness (which I think she was), or terror at the fact that her 2 young charges are indeed housing the spirits of dead (and sexually quite active) people. Strong and very Victorian stuff, this is! The supporting cast are wonderful, which includes a short and very telling scene with Sir Michael Redgrave as the children's disinterested roue uncle, Megs Jenkins as Mrs. Grose, the longtime housekeeper, the cruelly handsome Peter Wyngarde (later TVs ""Jason King"") as the dead Quint, and, of course, Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin as the children, Miles and Flora. Director Clayton deliberately did NOT tell these youngsters too much about the motivations of their characters, so their performances have a certain ambiguity to them that could be interpreted as simply childish precociousness or dark, sly deviousness. Stephens had played the leader of the monstrous children in ""Village of the Damned"" a year or so earlier, so he was no newcomer to dark-themed stories, and Miss Franklin appeared in numerous horror/thriller-themed films after this, well into her young adulthood, including Clayton's ""Our Mother's House"", and ""The Legend of Hell House"". Georges Auric's atonal music lends a great deal to the uneasy tone of the film. There's not a lot of music, but what's there is quite effective. Miss Kerr was asked what HER interpretation of the story was, to which she replied that she felt that Miss Giddens was a sexually repressed and frustrated woman, and this was HER way of dealing with her inner demons. ....and what do YOU think? The DVD is certainly an excellent addition to a horror/ghost story lover's collection, and is very reasonably priced. The picture quality is excellent, with just a tad of graininess here and there, and one has a choice of watching it in widescreen (is there any OTHER way to view this?) or full-screen. The sound is good. There aren't many 'Extra"", unfortunately (I wish that a ""making of"" short could have been made), just the original theatrical trailer.",1127865600,9,3298,5.064338235294118
773977,5,6303957064,"The reviewer of September 14, 2005 implies that there is only a pan-and-scan version on this DVD and that a key scene is omitted. Both statements are untrue as it seems the reviewer has not yet discovered that there is a widescreen version on the 'B' side of the disk.

The film is a truly inspired masterwork by both Director Jack Clayton and honored actress Deborah Kerr. This is what real movies are all about and hopefully the popularity of this DVD release will spark a rejuvenation of gothic suspense done the right way.",1126656000,9,526,4.595744680851064
773978,5,6303957064,"Deborah Kerr gave her finest performance as the repressed spinster in this adaptation of the Henry James novella ""The Turn of the Screw."" Ingrid Bergman once tried it but she brought robustness to the role that didn't quite fit. Kerr's interpretation, like the film itself full of light and dark, to date is definitive, and now we can see it on a DVD that definitely is not. A pity, too, because some of the principals are alive and could have enlivened this poorly produced disc, one that cries for a commentary. The only ""extras"" are a trailer, a bad pan-and-scan version and other film promos.

So dominating is Kerr's presence that she is able to hold the screen while sharing it with two children (no mean feat) who  are charming actors, Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin. Their governess learns that the ""sprits"" of her dead predecessor and a groundskeeper seek to reclaim the children. As their uncle, Michael Redgrave's cameo opens the film. In other support, Megs Jenkins dusts off the housekeeper with aplomb. Is the governess hallucinating or is the horror real? The answer ranks this  ghost story right up there with ""The Haunting"" and ""The Uninvited.""

The anticipated release of this DVD comes just as Universal announces another turn of the screw, this one a contemporary remake called ""The Turning"" in which the governess becomes an estate caretaker. It will be made by the gentleman who gave us  recent remakes of ""House of Wax"" and ""The Blob."" If ""The Innocents"" doesn't scare you, that news should. This is one of the classiest and most subtle ghost stories ever written. It's the very antithesis of the blood-and-gore movie shockers being promoted on this disc.

William Archibald adapted it for the stage and Truman Capote helped midwife it to film. Given the overt Freudianism and covert pedophilia that quicken their script, it is odd to find a key moment missing on DVD, one in which the boy plants a lip-to-lip lover's kiss on the governess. You wonder what other ""modifications"" (as the full-screen version warns) have been made. Jack Clayton directed and Freddie Francis photographed it in widescreen black-and-white ill-served in this transfer. You'd do well to wait for the special edition. Surely there will be one.",1126569600,4,2247,4.946949602122016
773979,5,6303957064,"Jack Clayton's film of Henry James' ""The Turn of the Screw"" is second only to ""The Haunting"" as the most effective and eerie ghost story put on film. Brilliantly photographed by Freddie Francis and superbly acted by Deborah Kerr, Pamela Franklin (""Hell House"") and Martin Stephens (""Village of the Damned""), Clayton's film starts off as an idyllic glimpse into the life of a new governess Miss Giddens (Kerr) taking care of two children Flora and Miles(Franklin and Stephens)for an indifferent uncle (Michael Redgrave). Isolated on the uncle's country estate, it soon becomes clear that something is not right with the children and that Giddens wasn't told everything about the death of their previous governess. Giddens begins to suspect that the children are being guided or possessed by two spirits but to what end she's not sure. Or is it all in her head and due to her repressed Victorian sexuality? Director Clayton and writers William Archibald (who worked on Hitchcock's ""I Confess"") and Truman Capote keep you guessing.

Updated for Blu-ray Review (German Import):

The Blu-ray is region A and B compatible.

The Blu-ray of ""The Innocents"" looks exceptional good and, with the exception of one shot, is an immaculate transfer (the one scene has a hair that inexplicably appears at the bottom of the frame). Blacks are rock solid and the detail is remarkably good with nice depth as well.

The audio is presented in its original mono. The only issue with the German import is that you have to choose English as the audio option as it defaults to German. Subtitles are in English and German.

Where the disc shines are the special features. We get an audio commentary track from film scholar Sir Christopher Frayling that covers a wide variety of material from the original source material to the details of shooting and reception of the film.

Only the anamorphic scope presentation of the film is on the Blu-ray (not the full screen and widescreen like the Fox domestic DVD).

Frayling also holds a nearly half hour featurette that focuses on much of the same material and includes Frayling shot on the estate where the film is set.

Some of the special features played with a bit of difficulty at first (which surprised me)but, if you hold the enter button (longer than usual) you'll be able to get access to them. Don't be discouraged the first time if, when you hit the enter button, it just restarts the main menu. The interface is a bit awkward at times.

There's also an audio reading of the original book by Henry James (but in German) as well as a featurette on the costume designers and trailers for both the film and other titles put out by Capelight Pictures the label responsible for the release. There is also reversable cover art with a replica of the original German poster.

Overall, this is a well done release with a very nice looking transfer of the film (the BFI UK transfer of the film) as well as numerous special features.

It's a pity that Fox thinks so little of this release that they won't put it out in the U.S. on Blu-ray.

Original Fox DVD:

Fox has done a nice job in transferring this classic to DVD. ""The Innocents"" appears for the first time in an anamorphic widescreen transfer. Curiously, the pan and scan version (which is what I originally saw on TV) is on the A side of the flipper while the superior anamorphic widescreen transfer is on the B side. The film shows quite a bit of wear and tear at the beginning but be patient as the image quality improves at the film moves along. The rich grays, black and white imagery look marvelous throughout most of the presentation. I am disappointed by the extras. Fox has provided commentary tracks for many of their film noirs. Since Franklin is still around (and, at the time of this writing so is Kerr)as is Stephens, I'd think that they would consider adding a commentary track for the film. A featurette on the making of the film would also have been nice. Unfortunately, it seems that no one at Fox values this film in the same fashion as the folks at Warner Home Video did ""The Haunting"" a perfect companion piece to this classic. We do get the original theatrical trailer as well as Fox Flix recommendations for other ""horror"" movies. Remade at least at least four occasions (with the 1999 TV version a solid entry as well), this is the best of the films made from James' novel.

Like Robert Wise's classic film ""The Haunting"", ""The Innocents"" is disquieting. The strong performances by the British cast and visually stunning direction keeps the film interesting throughout the production. The pacing is slow like many ghost stories creating tension and a sense of unease due to the unusual camera angles and visuals. Unlike many thrillers today, ""The Innocents"" doesn't resort to simple tricks like gore or violence. Instead Clayton uses sound effects and unusual camera tricks to create the tension that drives this thriller. If you come to this film expecting ""Scream"" you'll be sadly disappointed. The film that is nearest to this classic in tone is Alejandro Amenabar's ""The Others"" which was clearly influenced by ""The Innocents"".

Now the only other film I'm waiting on to show up on DVD is Robert Mulligan's film of Tom Tryon's novel ""The Other"". It's a good of example of how creepy thrillers used to be made with intelligence and style. Sadly, there's no DVD release announced yet for ""The Other"" or another film I admire (although it's flawed)""The Fool Killer"".",1126483200,7,5470,4.773544973544974
773980,5,6303957064,"Movie: *****  DVD Transfer: *****  Extras: ****

An excellent and suspenseful screen adaptation of Henry James' classic ghost story ""The Turn of the Screw"", featuring a magnificent tour-de-force performance by Deborah Kerr.  She plays the spinsterish and repressed Miss Giddens, a Victorian-era governess who journeys to an isolated English country estate to care for two young orphans whose only surviving relative (Michael Redgrave) doesn't wish to be involved in their upbringing.  Shortly after her arrival, Miss Giddens begins to be see the ghosts of the mansion's former stableman and the woman who was in sexual thrall to him, a woman who also happened to be the children's previous governess.  Soon enough, the children begin to show signs of being possessed by the spirits of the dead lovers, evidencing a disturbing level of carnal knowledge.  Are the children truly ""innocents""?  And can Miss Giddens possibly preserve their souls?  Or is she herself somehow tainted?  With grim and grisly certainty, the truth begins to unfold, leading to a genuinely terrifying and unexpected climax.

Fox Home Video's presentation of this mature and hauntingly eerie movie cannot be faulted.  Transferred in glorious black and white, the DVD offers both the widescreen (Cinemascope) and pan-and-scan versions of the film (my review is based on the original widescreen presentation).  The print is sharp and clean, and the creepy sound effects are crisp and clear.  Although the DVD package fails to mention it, the DVD also includes the film's Original Theatrical Trailer (which I found inappropriately hokey considering the subtlety of the film itself), as well as trailers for three other Fox Home Video horrors of negligible distinction.  Supremely well-acted (especially by Miss Kerr and Martin Stephens & Pamela Franklin as her two young charges) and intelligently directed, ""The Innocents"" is a bona fide classic worthy of a place in your home video library.",1126310400,3,1961,5.342019543973941
773981,4,6303957064,"I was delighted when I saw that Fox was planning a digital release of The Innocents; it's rarely run on TV--even on the Fox Channel--and is most often in its pan-and-scan incarnation when it appears. A (now former) friend was nice enough to burn a DVD from the old laserdisc release, so at least I had a copy in the correct format that didn't look bad at all.
However...
Fox, which has done such stellar digital transfer and release work on so much of its catalog (and has made it available at unbelievably low prices), has chosen to include this subtle masterpiece as part of its shlocky ""horror collection."" Don't get me wrong, I love some of the titles that are included, but they're being given the low-budget treatment and it looks as though a number of them are colorized (a deplorable process which I thought had mercifully expired some years back). So instead of being given the standard Fox treatment that I've come to expect--insert with chapter listings and some history of the feature, commentaries, newsreels, etc.--we're given next to nothing. The original trailer is included (reminiscent of the one for The Thing from Another Planet), and that's IT...unless you call trailers from some of the ""horror series"" titles ""extras."" The only inserts are ads for other titles in the series, including a three-for-two mail-in offer that postdates my Amazon order by two days, rendering my purchase ineligible. The other ""extra"" is the inclusion of the pan-and-scan print...ON THE A-SIDE, no less (perhaps lack of colorization can also be construed as an ""extra"").
Sigh.
The print itself looks pretty good (the widescreen print is anamorphic), although I doubt that much restoration has been done. It appears somewhat sharper than my laserdisc copy, but I suppose that's to be expected under the circumstances. The captions are in yellow, which means they're easy to read, and they appear on the matted area of my standard-screen TV. The stereo audio track sounds fine, and there's a Spanish audio track (mono) and subtitles for those who care about such things. And that's all.
Fox's handling of this release is a disgrace; someone over there doesn't appreciate the value of what they're holding in their hands. This is one of the finest, most disturbing tales of the supernatural ever committed to film, right up there with The Haunting and The Uninvited. I'd have to say that this one is my favorite of the three; I find it much more enjoyable than the James novella on which it is based. Deborah Kerr, although somewhat distractingly long in the tooth to be playing a naive, early-20-something parson's daughter, gives a brilliant performance and has equally stellar support from the rest of the cast, the children in particular. Truly, one isn't sure if the children are in fact possessed or if the governess is going mad as the result of sexual repression; things aren't as clear-cut here as in they are in The Haunting, despite the fact that we see through the protagonist's eyes in this film, too. And there aren't too many scenes captured on celluloid that are more disturbing than little Martin Stephens' lust-bloated face as he lies in bed after...well, I don't want to give anything away to first-time viewers. Buy this release at a discount, but if you're as much a fan of this film as I am, take the time to let Fox know that they goofed.",1126224000,3,3358,4.8417391304347825
773982,5,6303957064,"This movie, after so many years, still holds it icy grip on one's psyche. The filmmaker has proven here that with a good story, superb acting, simple but effective sets and effects, a movie can live for years.

Deborah Kerr is excellent in the role of governess as well the children who play Miles and Dora. They deliver their characters to believeable levels and play well against each other.

 The story, one of Henry James', is a classic and treated as such. It is filmed in black and white, excellent for ghost stories. What this story lacks in special effects is easily made up for in the plot and acting. Showing that glamor doesn't always make a movie.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone... especially those who like thrillers. There hasn't been a movie yet to capture how this one leaves you feeling, although the original 'Haunting' with Julie Harris comes very close.",1125705600,4,889,4.716129032258064

If you love gore, blood, sex, and all the 20th century crap, then you will hate this movie.  If, however, you love suspense, terror and truly imaginative horror, then you will love this movie.

774147,5,6303957064,"Jack Clayton's masterful film ""The Innocents"" is a superb and chilling adaptation of Henry James' ""Turn of the Screw.""  What makes this version so much better than any others is the film's ability to maintain a true sense of ambiguity as to whether the ghosts are real or figments of the governess' vivid (if not borderline hysterical) imagination.

Deborah Kerr gives what is, I think, her best screen performance ever in very difficult role.  Also remarkable are the two child actors who play Miles and Flora: Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin.  Stephens - who had appeared as the leader of the alien children in ""Village of the Damned"" a year earlier - is particularly impressive, his line readings worthy of an actor much older and more experienced. It's pity that Mr. Stephens gave up acting not long afterwards and later became a lawyer. Director Clayton proves his mastery of directing children both here and in his later film ""Our Mother's House"" (which also starred Miss Franklin).

It helps that the actors are served by co-scripwriters Truman Capote and William Archibald, who base the script on James' original story and Archibald's stage adaptation.

Also worthy of note is the cinematography of Freddie Francis, who creates some of the most haunting (and widely imitated) images of ghosts I've ever seen on film.  His overall work, on films like ""Sons and Lovers,"" ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning,"" and more recently in ""The Elephant Man"" has been criminally overlooked.

What happens when children who are, at the very least, eerily precocious cross paths with an intuitive but emotionally frail adult?  It's a fascinating theme, rarely explored with any depth today and still more than a little bit dangerous.  Deborah Kerr, an uncommonly intelligent actress, tested the theme's limits in a way that it would be hard to imagine anyone else of that era being able to do.  The child actors (Martin Stevens and Pamela Franklin) were also particularly well cast, although the direction left me a little confused about why Miss Giddens (Kerr) seems to care about them.

774154,5,6303957064,"While I have not read Henry James' novella, this 1961 version of his story is absolutely superb. It ranks right up there with the 1963 version of The Haunting (a version that was MUCH more truer to Jackson's novel than Jan DeBont's VERY horrendous loosely based 1999 remake). Psychologically, this film starring Kerr is a gem to behold.

Like with the 1963 version of The Haunting, The Innocents conveys an unsure or uncertain sense about our unconventional protagonist or heroine. Is Miss Giddons really seeing the ghosts of the former grounds keeper and previous governess Peter Quint and Ms. Jessel? Or is she simply imaginging seeing the two because of her sexual repression of having to take this job in order to leave a man she loved, but couldn't be with due to class (societal) separation? All I can say is is that Freud would have loved reading a story like Henry James' novella and seeing this 1961 version just to add his Freudian views on if Miss Giddons truly is a sexually repressed spinster. These questions of course differ slightly from the conflicts that are found in Eleanor in The Haunting with Eleanor's struggles with her own demons of loneliness.

Whether you wish to believe that all this is in the mind of Miss Giddons is up to you, but the sense of possession (if any at all) seems to lie mostly in Miles. The possession in Flora is present, but it is with Miles that Miss Giddons appears to get through to (if only very briefly) on numerous ocassions and as a result finds Miles torn with how to handle what's happening. The climatic confrontation between Miss Giddons, Miles and the ""supposed"" ghost of Peter Quint at the end is truly bone chilling as well as the nearly lingering, smoldering and passionate kiss she gives the lifeless Miles.

To say anything more would give away (as far as whether or not Miss Giddons is sane or not in what she's hearing and seeing) pivetol plot points, but overall if you're looking for a good scare this movie along with the 1963 version of The Haunting is the best thing to pick up a t video store.

So I was very surprised tonight when I happened upon The Innocents on PBS earlier tonight.

I thought I'd seen every type of movie in that genre.

Surprise, surprise.

The Innocents was a real treat. Im gobsmacked by how very sinister and thought provoking this movie is !

And Im very happy I got to see it in letterbox for my first time viewing.

I can't decide if the Governess was the mad one or the children were.

In the movie Miss Giddens appears to see a female figure by the lake and later the housekeeper tells her that Ms Pressel offed herself in the lake.

When Miss Giddens appears to see Ms Pressel in the schoolroom crying over a desk, Miss Giddens walks to the desk afterwards and swipes her finger on the desk and lifts up wetness apparently from a tear.

And at the end of the movie what instantly stops Miles heart ?

Simply from his wacky governess telling him that a ghost is there ?

To me it appears he catches a brief glimse of Quint and dies.

And for the past hour I watched this movie, The Innocents, and thought it was one of the scariest, provocative, and absolutely just fantastic movies I've ever seen. _Wow_.  So much so that when it ended, I went online to pbs.org to check to see what was just on.  And thank goodness pbs is so wonderful, because now I can own this movie  :)

774310,4,6303957064,"I don't celebrate Halloween in a big way, usually, but I do usually try to watch at least one or two fright flicks to mark the occasion.  In recent years, I've gone from campy (HOCUS POCUS, DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS) to artsy eccentric (DEAD RINGERS).  This year, I opted to go with something a little more elevated. THE INNOCENTS seemed to be just the thing: literary source material, of course (Henry James' TURN OF THE SCREW): prestigious screenwriting crew, including Truman Capote; accomplished director (Jack Clayton, though not well known did ROOM AT THE TOP and went on to do THE PUMPKIN EATER and other prestige projects); classy casting (well, anything with Deborah Kerr has got to have an element of class). And of course, it's one of those movies that film buffs everywhere seem to rave about.  Along with THE UNINVITED, THE HAUNTING and a scant few others (maybe THE SIXTH SENSE to include a more recent example), this is widely viewed as one of the most artistically successful horror films ever made.

By and large, the movie lives up to its reputation. It is indeed subtler than most ghost stories, relying on atmosphere and mood more than special effects and shock.  And it manages to retain something of James' literary sensibility (no mean feat there, since the temptation to turn this subtle story into more of a spook show must have been very real in 1961).  ""Ambiguity"" seems to be something of a buzzword in the discussion of this film.  Psychodrama or ghost tale--or both?  There's subtext enough here for 50 doctoral dissertations.

THE INNOCENTS is not a masterpiece, but it's solid, intelligent filmmaking--horror at its psychological best.  I could have done a lot worse for my annual Halloween pick--and have.",1099180800,4,1732,4.8805460750853245
774311,5,6303957064,"""Do you have an imagination?""

""Yes. You must have an imagination if you work with children.""

Thus begins Uncle's interview with Miss Giddens who later serves as Miles' and Flora's new Governess. And it's her beloved imagination which turns against her. Drives a wedge between herself and everyone else at Uncle's estate.

There are so many reviews posted on this site concerning The Innocents, it seems a bit pointless to rehash the plot. You already know it's a spook story set in a large English countryside mansion. That's all you need to know.

But, I must say - there's a duplicity of logic in this movie, as in all great supernatural stories. There's ""reality"" and then there's Miss Giddens' ""imagination."" Believe whichever you like. They're in perfect synchronicity with each other.

But, dare not believe both at the same time. If you try, this movie will unnerve you, and make you slightly mad. Slightly schizophrenic. There are parallel worlds here - Giddens is unable to discern between the two. Like going cross-eyed in the mind. Are the dead among us? Is it all a trick set up by devious children? Or is it nothing at all?

One could qualify The Innocents as the best ghost story ever filmed. Frankly, I don't like superlatives - and I haven't seen every movie ever made to be able to argue that point. But this IS a beautiful film, and psychologically skewering, the like of which I've never seen. ""Turn Of The Screw"" is an apt title. Each inexplicable incident tightens that vice of fear - click - click - one quarter turn.

Truman Capote co-authored the script - if that means anything to you ""In Cold Blood""/""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" fans.

Re the VHS version: There's an eerie effect in the film print - and I doubt it was intentional and probably just due to age - but occasionally some of the shadows get washed out in a wavering light. It's very slight - and I'm sure with new digital restoration technology they could fix that, but it adds an extra aura to this film.

This movie is over 40 years old, and film images themselves are ghosts, when you think on it, windows into the past - or are they just shadows and light playing tricks on the mind.",1092960000,15,2173,4.608808290155441

The high school horror crap so readily churned out appals me when I watch a film like The Innocents, and I'm reminded what a good scary movie is really like.
Although I'm not 100% sure about Deborah Kerr's performance in The Innocents, it certainly didn't tarnish my respect for this film. Miles and Flora are played by two outstanding children, who truly are stars. Miles' character was just the most eerie thing I've witnessed in a movie for a long time - he indeed had the air of an innocent, but there was definitely an adult, almost sexual side to the boy. Very creepy.
The lighting effects, multitude of mirrors and spooky Miss. Jessel filled me with fear from the moment I started watching this - and I was hooked until the closing credits. My favourite part of The Innocents was the governess's bizarre dream sequence - spinechilling stuff.
I'll be sure to recommend this film to all my friends in the hope that it'll get the recognition it deserves.

 Without going into the allegory specifically I didn't find the ending horrifying, though of course it was quite tragic.

774402,4,6303957064,"(...)It would be wrong to contribute this film to a long list of ghost stories per se, for these ghosts as we perceive them, are far removed from the 'boo' variety that so many of us are aware of. Rather, perceptions that slip over the edge of the abyss and into the realm of the psychological variety deepen with each frame that the film presents.
Giddens is our guide into the unknown and it is through her eyes that we begin to see this as more than just another ghost story. Rather it is the door into Victorian society and the social caste system that was readily used. Levels were to be maintained and one was never to stray from their station in life. Is Giddens a reliable storyteller, or are we living through the frustrations of her own life and how she intends to project herself onto the rest of the world around her? Would we tend to call this tale a ghost story or would we see it for what it truly is -- one of a repressed and irrational person who has created this entire story to make up for her own sense of personal and professional failure in her life?
Sex, as we are well aware, was a taboo subject in the Victorian era. Are we witnessing the sexual meltdown of the spinster governess, Miss Giddens, or, are we a party to a real ghost story? The Innocents turns the screw on the viewer and thrusts the choice into our minds. We see what we want to see and perceive it as thus.
Performances by Deborah Kerr and Martin Stephens are chilling. Her nervous, wanting to please governess and Stephens' Stepford/Village of The Damned child lob off each other as they draw us ever closer to a masterful denouement. They have equally created a sense of evil that allows us to see the horror of the situation from within the story.
Jack Clayton, the director, has captured the atmosphere and darkness in The Innocents, which is based on the novella, The Turn of The Screw, by Henry James. The use of an all black screen at the beginning and the end of the film makes you wonder just what precisely is going to happen, and the showing of hands in prayer remains a puzzle until the very end.
The screenplay by Truman Capote and William Archibald encompasses the spirit of James's book, and it is held tightly in check, with an understanding of what is required and what is not.
Cinematography by Freddie Francis, in glorious black and white envelopes the tale by issuing forth the lights and shadows that are such a base requirement for any story claiming to have even a minute hint of terror about it. The blazing light of day, the play of light off water, the ebony black of night, the supposition of ghosts upon the living; all masterful and elegant touches that echo suppositions of eerie and otherworldly things and events.
The Innocents is chock full of horror. The supposed pureness of the children and the requisite combination of evil in the appearance of the apparitions and Miss Giddens behaviour, fathoms a nightmare quality that stays with the viewer long after the movie has ended. Giddens pursuit of truth as she wants to believe it, must wade through a quagmire of lies that will continue to mislead her until she has no further ground to trod.
This film is to be commended for its non-use of a lot of silly special effects that would have ruined the desired response that it sought to convey. Just try to forget the gossamer representation of Miss Jessel on the lake or the appearance of Quint on the tower top! It joins the club of psychological thrillers that need only the power of the mind to relay the subtleties of the story without a caravan of pyrotechnics to mar the proceedings. The Sixth Sense, The Uninvited and The Haunting (the Robert Wise version and NOT Jan de Bont mess!) are part of a special club indeed, and The Innocents joins them.
This film was overlooked when it was first released. It's such a gem as to beg to be seen for what it is -- an effective tale of not necessarily what you see or don't see, but what you almost see. . .",1074643200,5,3979,4.4520547945205475
774403,5,6303957064,"I saw this movie for the first time on cable last week; I was about to go to bed when I caught this from the halfway point, right when Deborah Kerr as the Governess, is playing hide and seek with the children and sees through a window, the ghost of Peter Quint. Beginning as a silhoette, he slowly glides into the reflected light from inside and fixes her with his dead stare. Then he glides away again, with only the light in his dead eyes shining in the darkness. It literally sent chills up my spine and made my eyes water!  And I bow to any movie that can do that! I was completely transfixed from that point on and stayed up until the very end. You know a good movie when you're sad that it's over, and I was.  I wanted it to go on and on! I think I would have watched it til dawn if it had lasted that long. Rare is a movie this affecting and atmospheric. It was literally a sensual pleasure, albeit a tension filled one--to take it in!
All of the ghost sightings are handled in a powerfully surreal way. The sight of Miss Jessel's ghost on a distant bank is inexplicably terrifying, maybe because her blank stillness is so incongruous with what we're used to in this genre, which usually depicts ghosts as being in various stages of raging histrionics.  Somehow, the stillness of this one terrifies more. Her stillness creates an unbearable tension. You feel on the edge of your seat with the idea that she may suddenly look at you, or scream, explode somehow into violence, so that finally the very idea that she may move at all is unbearable, and it's  a relief when the camera cuts away from her and she's off the screen. (Although as with any good suspense, you want it to come right back and scare you again!)
I was taken aback by both the unusual ending and the adult nature of the story; they both give this film an ""ahead of its time"" distinction. In addition, it's so artfully filmed and conceived, almost like Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"", and definitely a sister to ""The Haunting"" which, up til now, had been my favorite ghost-themed film. (Not anymore! Much as I love ""The Haunting"", it looks like an episode of Scooby-Doo next to this masterpiece! ) Likewise, ""The Others"" which had been another favorite, doesn't shine quite as brightly now that I've seen this. Good as it is, ""The Others"" is really just a remake of this much earlier film with a few plot points tweaked and a new title tacked on. It's effective, but I think ""The Innocents"" is more so.
 I was immediately obsessed enough with the story to buy the book it was based on (""Turn of the Screw"") which I thought it served very faithfully, and the screenplay, co-written by Truman Capote, even managed to enhance and improve the original story.
Having purchased this film on VHS, I can attest that it's one of those rare films you can watch over and over without getting tired of it. There's always something new it it, and although it's sad and suspenseful, there's a lulling quality to it that is strangely comforting to curl up to with a bowl of soup and a blanket.

774404,5,6303957064,"This is one of my favorite films.  This movie excels at what I think makes a movie haunt you for life, and that elusive thing is called atmosphere.  The black and whiteness is crucial in acheiving that, as is the minimal use of a music score.  Add to that a humdinger of a plot, the torturous urgency of Deborah Kerr's smashing performance (one of the best ever on film)--and the subtle eerieness created by the magnificent child actors--and you have a perfect piece of cinema.  Usually ghost stories provide skimpy or cliched reasons for all of the hooplah (like revenge).  This is an exception.  The Freudian subject matter behind the hauntings is fascinating, not to mention pretty daring for its day.  And the title says a lot about that.  This woman believes in the innocence of children, but she also realizes that innocence gets lost and the truth must be faced at any cost.  And the movie explores this without making it a ""message"".  The final sequence is one of the most haunting finales ever.  The way she screams out ""Miles!""--gives me chills just thinking about it.  And then that great fadeout to ""The End"", showing her hands in prayer.  There are many brilliant touches and flourishes that make this outstanding cinema.

774405,5,6303957064,"""The Innocents"" is one of the world's finest films.  The source is Henry James' ""Turn of the Screw"", a gothic ghost story depicting a conflict between mysticism and reality within the mind of a spinster governess in Victorian England.  This theme is hinted at during the opening credits.  What is to follow is 100 minutes of beautifully photographed incidents and scenes, facts and half-facts, distortions and gossip with no line between reality and delusion to ground us.  As the confusion within our minds grows, shadows and distortions create shadows on the sides of the film, each and every frame of which is a black and white work of art with an accompanying soundtrack enhancing every frame.  Orchestration, nature, voices, intonations, fragments of sentences, laughter, tears, screams, whispers all create an unsettling, atmospheric mood-character as haunting as any ghost.  You sit and wonder if anything is really there or is it ""only the wind, my dear""?  Is she just ""imaging things""?  If there is no answer to that question, is it worth noticing?  Is it worth making decisions about?  The governess thinks so with disasterous results.
You will think about this movie for days after seeing it.  Was Mrs. Grose telling the truth, or spreading lies?  Does the governess have a loose screw?  When was she sent over the edge?  There is enough evidence to support any view you choose to take, the movie plays beautifully whichever way you choose to look at it.  You'll benefit from the therapy of being forced to think, forced to choose, forced to contemplate reality confronted with mysticism.  The movie starts at the end and ends at the beginning.  If the governess isn't insane after the opening credits she is insane at the closing credits,  trapped forever in a self-created hell, forced to remember and remember in an eternal, vicious circle which becomes the film ""The Innocents"".  For us the film is over, but the governess is locked inside it for eternity.  And that's when the horror takes us.  This should be seen alone and in the dark and in letterbox/widescreen format.

774407,5,6303957064,"Adaptation of the story The Turn of the Screw, I really fell in love with this film and was totally hooked on watching it over and over.....
Deborah Kerr's character is hired as a Governess to care for two young children. Both children were mainly in the care of their very well-to-do Uncle that is not so great at taking care of anything but his own needs but his niece and nephew are looked after well inspite of his ego. Kerr's character is interviewed by the Uncle to care for his young family and was somewhat persuaded to take the job because of his flirtations win her over.
Little did she know that upon entering the job, the new Governess was quickly hurried to a mansion in the country away from everyone and anything. The children had a house-maid that watched over them but she couldn't be a Mother like the job entitled her to be. The children lost their parents when they were very young and they both went through two prior tenants that Kerr was instantly replacing as Governess. She was told that both tenants had died but not how within year of her new job.
Kerr fell in love with the children and quickly noticed how much they both loved one another as siblings. So much love, that they took on strange and frightining personalities that began to scare the Governess. Obligated to find the answer for the behavior, Kerr nearly met her own death and termination of her job while trying to take hold of the forces that were around her and beginning to take shape physically.

The more recent ""The Others"" comes to mind, and ""The Sixth Sense"". But nothing compares to Henry James' tale of horror in Turn of the Screw, aptly named THE INNOCENTS for film. Deborah Kerr is perfectly cast as the governess of two children who seem to be possessed by two tragic ghostly figures that only the governess can see. Creepy, haunting, a movie you probably don't want to watch alone, though I have. Great cast. Director Jack Clayton has the perfect touch. Though I am giving the film itself 5 stars, I wouldn't give the VHS version a high mark at all. The audience is forced to watch this magnificent film in the dreadful 'full screen' mode.

Calling Ms. Kerr, the governess, ""Miss Giddons dear"" and faintly mocking tones, they dominate the movie; their haunting and possession by the dead servants, Quint and Miss Jessel, are something to see. One of the scenes that scared me the most was the one where Flora is dancing, in the little stone gazebo, to the haunting music box theme, by the lake, and the dead Miss Jessel appearing, watching her from the middle of the lake, seemingly suspended on some water plants, looking sad in her black mourning dress. Flora seems to be dancing for her, and the effect is chilling. The entire movie has a neverending undercurrent of terror, albeit quiet terror, and you never know, literally, what is around the next corner of the vast house. Quint appears to Miss Giddons, outside a window, during a game of hide and go seek, and Miss Jessel glides eerily by a hallway, in her requisite black mourning dress. The housekeeper, Mrs. Gross, stands by the children and refuses to believe they are anything less than ""innocent"", while Miss Giddons adopts a more pragmatic (and accurate) view of how damaged and under the influence of these two entities the two children really are. Miss Giddons has a dramatic showdown with Flora, by forcing her to acknowledge the existence of Miss Jessel in the scene by the lake, and afterwards the traumatized Flora is taken away by the housekeeper and Miss Giddons is left alone in the house with Miles. The final scene was, and is, still shocking even by today's standards, as Miss Giddons kisses the dead child, Miles, on the mouth, with disturbing passion, but the scene fits perfectly into the story and underscores the complicated and turbulent relationship Miss Giddons has with the children, expecially young Miles.

774512,5,6303957064,"""THE INNOCENTS"" is the best ghost story ever produced.  As a dramatic visualisation of Henry James' timeless and enigmatic novella ""The Turn OF The Screw"" it is a perfectly realised and brilliant evocation of Victorian sexual repression, innocence perhaps corrupted by perversity, and the power of suggestion.  The palpable atmosphere of loneliness and dread that permeates Bly, the remote country estate that is the setting for the story, is gorgeously rendered in black-and-white Cinemascope that evokes the famous Eugene Atget photos of Versailles.  This is a hauntingly beautiful film, with a sad and mournful quality that deepens it power to terrify.  Sensitively and astutely written and directed, and superbly acted by the four principals, it also features a sophisticated and multi-layered soundtrack. The whispers, echoing footsteps and music-boxes, distant stirring of leaves and gusts of wind and hypnotic silences are extraordinarily effective at drawing the viewer inexorably into the dark and fearful world of the film, with the sinister spirits of its two dead servants beckoning to the children from the shadows, or perhaps gradually possessing them...
 This movie scared the crap outta me when I first saw it, and its power to chill and terrify remains undiminished with subsequent viewings.  However, having just once been lucky enough to see it on a movie screen in its proper aspect ratio, I gotta tell you, it MUST be seen in a widescreen format to be fully appreciated.... so many thanks to 20th C Fox for finally making the DVD release a reality!

But there is a scene in the film, not in the novel, which seems to me to lend credence to the governess being out of her mind and the ghosts imaginary. During the game of hide and seek she hides in the attic from the children. There she comes across a picture of Peter Quint and Miss Jessel and studies it. It is immediately after this she sees Quint close up, for the first time, at the window, and recognises him from the photo. His previous appearance had been up on the tower and was not very distinct. However when she describes this latest appearance to Mrs Grose, the housekeeper recognises the apparition as Quint, which weighs in favour of the governess being stone cold sane and the ghost real. There simply is no way of knowing which point of view is the truth, and this ambiguity increases the sense of menace in the film. Kerr is outstanding, as are the two children.

The two childrens' growing personalities and mannerisms eerily reflect those of Miss Jessel, the governess, and Quint. Soon, Miss Giddens begins seeing the specters of the two around the estate. The housekeeper (Megs Jenkins) claims she doesn't see them but is aware that the children are troubled. The housekeeper becomes alarmed when Miss Giddens tries to confront the children as the governess suspects the ghosts have returned to possess them. It becomes apparent that something horrible is happening. Many have speculated that the governess is sexually repressed and transferring her guilt and fear onto the children which means the ghosts only exist in her mind. I don't quite buy that theory. I believe the supernatural does indeed come into play here and that this is a ghost story of the first magnitude. Some people have the ability to see ghosts and some don't. Some believe and some don't want to. In any case, ""The Innocents"" is a beautiful and disturbing thought provoker with an unforgettably tragic ending. Deborah Kerr is excellent as Miss Giddens and the entire cast is remarkable.

Kerr plays governess to two children one of which may or may not be the victim of possession.  Anything more would be giving it away.
Certainly in the top ten list of Horror/Ghost story films of all time, The Innocents compares favorably with ""The Haunting"" (the original '63 version).  Kerr's spectral visions are as solid as the furniture -- they're just harder to find, and lot scarier; the film is an example of how little one needs to resort to SPFX when one knows how to make drama.
On the down side the original was photographed in lush monochrome cinemascope, and the only version released to date (that I'm aware of) is pan-an-scan, so you're missing about 40% of the image.

Where it works is as a human-relations drama detailing the complex relationship between the governess and the children. She is shocked by Miles' overtures, but not altogether averse, seen most clearly in the bedtime kiss. Deborah Kerr is great at registering her ambivalence, something she also did well in Black Narcissus.
In an art-book, I saw two paintings by Bronzino (c. 1545): ""Eleanora of Toledo"" and ""The  Exposure of Luxury"" - one depicting a sombre and sedate mother, the other a lascivious embrace. And these seem to be the contrary states of the governess' soul.

As the person with some rationality (in theory) and control Ms Kerr's character acts very irrational and as someone without control.
My wife believes the main adult character played by Ms Kerr is nuts to start with, and that may explain the rest of the film because the entire story is told from her point of view.

Deborah Kerr stars as Miss Giddens, a timid governess who believes that the house she is in charge of is being haunted, and that the two children in her care are being corrupted by the evil ghosts. Based on the short novel ""The Turn of the Screw"" by Henry James, the film manages to successfully tackle the pivotal mystery of the story, which is that the viewer cannot be sure whether the ghosts are real, or just a figment of the governess's imagination. The scenes in which Kerr sees the apparitions are extremely well done. On one occasion, a sombre figure in a black dress is seen standing on the far bank of a lake, in another, the evil face of a man appears through the gloom outside of a window. The ghosts appear for just long enough and just indistinctly enough to scare the pants off poor Miss Giddens, not to mention the viewer! Shot in stunning black and white cinemascope, and beautifully showing every period detail, the film has some amazing scenes utilizing very deep focus, which is used to great dramatic effect. Deborah Kerr gives an excellent performance, depicting the governess's slide into hysteria, as do the two children; you can never quite tell if they are behaving perfectly innocently, or are in league with the spirits, which is just what is intended.

774619,5,6303957064,"""The Innocents"" is the definitive ghost story on film, but then it has the advantage of being based on the best known ghost story ever written, ""The Turn of the Screw"" by Henry James.  The setting is Victorian England and Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) is employed for the first time as a governess by ""Uncle"" (Michael Redgrave"" to watch his orphaned niece and nephew.  Arriving at the lavish mansion to take care of young Flora (Pamela Franklin), Miss Giddens is almost immediately confronted with strange goings on revolving around the somewhat sinister young girl.  When Miles (Martin Stephens) joins them, having been expelled from school, Miss Giddens begins seeing ghosts.  Eventually the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose (Meg Jenkins) tells her the tragic story of the previous governess, Miss Jessel, who was having an affair with Quint, the valet.  After he was killed in a drunken accident, the heartbroken governess drowned herself in the pond.  Miss Giddens becomes convinced that the unhappy lovers are the ghosts and that they are reenacting their affair through the children.  Vowing to save the children, Miss Giddens takes steps to confront the evil in the house.  When she forces Flora to admit to see Jessel's ghost, it is only the beginning of a truly terrifying climax.
""The Innocents"" is a first rate horror drama, directed by Jack Clayton and filmed in glorious black-and-white by Freddie Francis.  Although others are credited with the final screenplay, Clayton has long declared that Truman Capote authored virtually all of the final shooting script.  Deborah Kerr turns in one of the finest performances of her storied career, while the work of the two child actors is as good as you will ever see (think Henry Thomas in ""E.T."").  Ultimately the success of this 1961 film as a work of horror comes from the absence of a truly cathartic release at the end.  The growing sense of unease that builds throughout the film does not find a complete release at the end, and we are shaken that bad things can happen to such innocents.",989712000,7,2039,4.9298245614035086

Deborah Kerr gives the performance of her life (with the exception only, perhaps, of Sister Clodagh in BLACK NARCISSUS) as the beautiful and hysterical governess brought to a gigantic mansion to care for two odd children, who may or may not be communing with the ghosts of Kerr's predecessor and the manor's manservant. The uncertainty as to whether the ghosts are real--or products of the governess's repressed fears and insecurities--is the famous crux of the James novella, and beautifully translated into the film. There are teasing moments of narrative uncertainty, such as the classic sequence in the schoolroom, that capture all the mystery of the original source, and the great sequence with Kerr trying to restrain a hysterical Flora from joining what looks to be the ghost of Miss Jessel out by the manor's lake in the pouring rain is authentically creepy.",983059200,25,1161,4.989690721649485

When Victorian governess is persuaded by the children's uncle and guardian to replace her dead predecessor she is confronted by two evil children, at the very least, precocious and displaying disturbing behaviour. When the governess arrives at the stately manor despite it's opulence and tidiness it exudes a disturbing quality. Before she meets Flora the unseen voice that calls the child's name suggests that the governess, Flora or both of them are in danger. Flora presents as both enchanting and strange suggesting that she is possibly under the spell of a supernatural influence. When Miles is sent home from his exclusive boarding school and the children are reunited they display a Poe'esque otherworldliness and corruption challenging viewers preconception of childhood innocence. Despite the governess's shock at the children's behaviour, she is intent on caring for them and exorcising the menacing demons who seem to have control over them. On one level The innocence is a classic ghost story the deals with the struggles against good and evil. On another level the film explores sexual taboos between the children themselves and the governess. The slow burning quality of the film initially works well, but as the story progresses this quality seriously weakens its capacity to frighten and maintain viewers' interest. However, classic features, such as the smouldering atmosphere, stormy weather, unseen voices and the transient appearance of the spooks work well with this film.

At first, she is delighted to care for Flora while Miles is away at school. When he's expelled and returns home, both children have bouts of odd behavior. Unexplained noises and visions of a man and woman haunt Miss Giddens, increasing in intensity as time goes on. She is convinced the children are possessed by spirits of the dead and vows to save them.

The Innocents is first and foremost a beautiful film. In a time when color was the norm, the black and white color sets the mood of the story as well as the dramatically lit scenes, crumbling statues, and mysterious figures. Miss Giddens is the story's unreliable narrator who grows convinced that the children she cares for are possessed by the ghosts of a valet Peter Quint and the previous governess Miss Jessel, who were in love and had a very public affair. She sees their figures and Quints face clear as day, but no other character acknowledges them. The film never confirms or denies the existence of the ghosts and cases can be made for either side. I personally find it a little more interesting if the ghosts are merely figments of  Miss Giddens' imagination.

The title could refer to the children, who are by definition innocent. The odd behavior that puts off Miss Giddens is in Miles' almost flirtatious manner and both children's acting as if they have a secret. Flora nonchalantly described a spider eating a a fly in a creepy manner. These can be fairly normal children's behavior. They imitate grown ups, spontaneously kiss people, describe things without being aware of the connotations, and have their own secrets. Miss Giddens may be coloring the situation with her own meaning that comes from someone fairly innocent herself as a spinster in the suppressed Victorian era. Whether the children are possessed or just precocious, the tragic ending is the same and equally heartbreaking.

The Innocents is a beautiful movie that is a gothic horror classic. The atmosphere built and maintained is masterful at capturing Miss Giddens mental journey as the house and spirits grow more and more oppressive. Miss Jessels figure on the edge of a river is iconic. The scene occurs in broad daylight, but her face is slightly blurred. It amps up the tension and has been copied over and over in film.

7860569,1,6303957064,"The creators of this film opted to make a simplistic ghost story where the two children, Miles and Flora, are possessed by the ghosts of their previous chaperones. Deborah Kerr, the new governess, makes it her mission to exorcise the two demons. Throughout, the filmmakers use cheap tricks to make the atmosphere eerie, such as creaking floor boards, whispers, crying, and other haunted house stuff.

Unfortunately, this adaptation takes out all the nuance and subtext of its source novel, The Turn Of the Screw. Most crucially, what's missing is sex. The novel is mainly about the sexual awakening of the governess to both heterosexual and lesbian desires. It is also about sexual taboos, specifically the demon of homosexuality which was regarded as a serious crime in Great Britain. Deborah Kerr, who I think is a sensual actress, is oddly frigid here. She doesn't exude any sexual vibes throughout the entire film. In what should have been the seduction scene between Miles and Kerr, there was nothing. Moreover, the ""corruptness"" that got Miles expelled from school, that he hurt the other children, is, in fact, his homosexual activities. None of this is even hinted at in the film. We're only told of the illicit love affair between Quint and Jessel.

The problem in making the children possessed by ""ghosts"" is that they aren't acting under their own volition. However, as I see it, in Henry James' novel, the children are still children but with sexual knowledge and experience. The filmmakers, including Truman Capote, made a gross error in opting for the former interpretation.",1496880000,,1588,5.057251908396947
