At least for me, the movie made me think a lot about my own personality and how one comes across to others.  You think they see you as bold and decisive, but really they just see you as an arrogant jerk.

Watched a few times, it'll really help you do a lot of growing up.

Many reviewers here have given it positive reviews due to the material as you see  someone bury their career, and unfortunately, schadenfreude is a big part of our society.  However, it's told from only one point of view, probably due to access issues; there's no interviews with the studios that dropped the project (Miramax mostly).  The final product, The Boondock Saints, wound up being a pretty terrible movie anyway, although Troy says about 100 times in the movie that he's the best in the business.  There's probably a good reason the studios passed on it.  They probably realized it wasn't going to fly, so they dropped the deal.  Welcome to the real world Troy.

It starts with his story being bought by Mirimax, then goes to trying to cast the movie, and suddenly it's falling apart and the movie isn't being made. Then they try to get someone else to make it, but nobody wants to for some reason. We jump from milestone to milestone, but there isn't a good explanation of why things are happening.

Smaller nitpick, and admittedly I don't have the best hearing in the world, but this documentary is in desperate need of some subtitles or closed captioning.",1300233600,,617,4.609090909090909
2260420,4,B000929VTU,"I watch Intervention for comedic value. I call the show ""An Incomplete List of the People I'm Glad I Don't Live Next Door To."" Getting to watch a delusional life splatter against the unflinching retaining wall of reality like so much self aggrandizing excrement fired out of a howitzer is one of precious few things that keep me going. If you even partially identify with this view, have I got a movie for you, and also might I say I look forward to someday joining you on one of the endless, fiery racks of hell.

Schadenfreude: The Movie, aka Overnight, is nothing more and nothing less than watching someone being offered every single thing one could possibly desire from a financial or career standpoint, and then, having it all taken away. It's all okay though, because it happens to the worst human being. Ever.

What's really uniquely beautiful about this film is that, if this same story of rags-to-riches-to-right-back-to-being-rags-again had happened to an equally offensive, evil, yet fictional individual, it would have been wholly unbelievable, and unremarkable. Such a one-note morality tale would've been a highly tedious exercise to all but the mouth-breathing Disney crowd. As a documentary, however, it is awesomeness of a ""He is risen"" magnitude.

Other reviews on amazon are critical of reviewers who comment solely on Troy Duffy, and less on the movie overall. Though the filmmakers here do have some less than compelling footage occasionally, and one could question the artistic validity of composing what is essentially a cinematic hit job, I do not, because I still recognize fun when I see it.

Imagine a version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" where, upon receiving his golden ticket, Charlie proceeds to set fire to his family's house and watches it burn while throttling the life out of an entire litter of newborn kittens before Willy Wonka runs up and just curb stomps the little bastard.

2260422,4,B000929VTU,"This documentary on legendary screenwriter, director, musician, entrepreneur Troy Duffy (Who?) was such a joy to behold. As far as films go, it's wasn't the most well produced documentary, as it showed little more than a narcissistic control freak berating and bragging his way through the whole film with little insight into the thoughts of those around him. I guess they would have to ask his permission to have an independant thought concerning his groundbreaking, never been done before project. As inadequate as the actual film was, the message came through loud and clear. This guy blew it and has no one to blame but himself.

 Early in the film, a friend of Duffy's says something like, ""He deserves everything he's gonna get"". At the time, he was commenting on how hard Troy had worked to kick doors down and live his dream, had signed a million dollar production deal to direct and cut a movie based on  his own screenplay, and would deserve the success from his efforts. These words proved prophetic, but for entirely different reasons related to karma. Mr. Duffy abused everyone, convinced that he was the biggest thing Hollywood or the music industry had ever seen. I wish there had been at least some coverage of the band recording their album so I could see whether any of his feelings of grandeur were in any way justified, but with all the priceless footage of him being a total tool, there wasn't time for much else. The band was dropped from their label after selling only 690 copies, so I'm assuming they aren't the next Beatles. He managed to make the movie and it played in a few theatres before ending up on DVD. I felt guilty that I had bought a copy of Boondock Saints and Overnight and payed this A-hole a royalty, until a graphic ran at the end of the movie that said his deal with William Morris agency did not include a percentage of TV or dvd sales, so he got squat! I know this guy was doing all the work to promote himself and the band while most of the other guys looked on like deer in the headlights, and felt entitled to all the credit for breaking the band, but he basically told his own brother (the guitar player in their band) he could go to heck and would never have any input in anything. He then told the ""friends"" filming the documentary that they weren't entitled to one red cent and they were just hangers-on, lucky to be in his presence. Note to self: if I'm ever in this situation, wait until AFTER the documentary is done before pissing off the guys in charge of cutting the tape together. When guys like this crash and burn, it's hard to feel sorry for them. He accomplished more than most people are able too, but that makes the fall from grace that much harder and the regrets that much more intense. What a shame.

2260437,4,B000929VTU,"Overnight (Tony Montana and Mark Brian Smith, 2003)

If there is one thing that this movie conclusively proves, it's that you can be right and still be a jerk.

Overnight is a documentary about the rise and fall of Troy Duffy, the writer and director of indie smash hit The Boondock Saints. Duffy's script was originally optioned by Harvey Weinstein, and Miramax were slated to finance and release the picture; the trials and tribulations of getting the picture made after Weinstein bailed are the stuff of Hollywood legend. Montana and Smith were there the whole way, charting the fascinating story of The Boondock Saints and Duffy's band, The Brood, who landed a deal with Atlantic for the soundtrack.

While much of the blame for the shenanigans here can be placed solely on the head of Harvey Weinstein, there's no denying that Duffy, in many ways, made his own bed. There's nothing here that shows him as a very likable guy, even though the statements he makes throughout the documentary about the quality of both The Boondock Saints and its soundtrack are dead-on; the man simply has no tact whatsoever. Combine that with a hair-trigger temper, and it's pretty easy to see why no one in Hollywood wanted to work with him, even once he had a brilliant film in the can. (The filmmakers do insinuate, though, that Duffy's charge that Weinstein blacklisted him in Hollywood is not unwarranted.) Once again, we learn the lesson that art cannot overcome politics, at least not in Hollywood.

This is a must-watch for any Boondock Saints fan, especially those of us who have been wondering why Diffy has been having such a hard time getting financing for All Saints' Day. Now, unfortunately, we have an answer. ****",1189987200,,1714,4.839590443686006

Applause to the man behind the camera who recorded it all and made some money...the current ""National Enquirer+The Soup+Consumer's Report"" way. It's a winner.",1189209600,,561,4.793814432989691

Slimey agents, musicians, wannabees & others.

There's no need to berate, downgrade, badger, mentally abuse others in order to inflate your own
(rubber doll) ego. Life is short. Movies don't matter. We're here for a short while...and then, guess what? they stick us six feet below. Why cause grief and unhappiness to others--for no real reason at all?

And that's what Troy Duffy does throughout the doc. Watching this wet-behind-the-ears fool chain-smoke, curse, chew-out, attack and humiliate family and friends (FOR NO REAL REASON or even anything that comes close to excusing this kind of chicken-s--t behavior) is enough to cause you heart-burn.

By the way, Duffy--keep pulling on those cancer sticks (no matter how cool you think you are doing it) and you won't reach 50.

You'll also learn this: success (should you ever get there) without having anyone to share it with means nothing.

Sadly, all I can finally say is this: in a doc full of ""people,"" the only one who looks human, acts human & is human, is the waitress (while serving motormouth Duffy and his crew of fools proclaiming every step of the way about their movie deals and record deals and mag covers & how great they are)) when she says: ""I'm a waitress...and waitress.""

I loved her for it. Decent. A woman with class.

What she did for a living (serving people their chow and/or drinks) was far more important (to me) than any movie or record deal--no matter how much money is generated. Explain it to the Hollywood morons. Chasing money and fame is for fools.

2260441,5,B000929VTU,"The directors of this documentary have every reason to make this film and take out all of the good things that Troy Duffy, did for them, but they didn't.  They show him in his confident, no frills best to show just how disappointing and sad it is that he never had an ounce of humility in his body.  You see Duffy making great music, you see Duffy getting along famously with his friends, you see him making his one claim to fame, Boondock Saints (which isn't a work of genius in anyone's mind, but entertaining on a basic level).  What Troy would have you believe and what the filmmakers don't even have to argue for is right here in the film.  You have the egomaniac not taking responsibility for his own actions, being tactless when confronted, purposely ruining relationships he started long ago.  You see some of this come out before he gets the contract and you see that people just shut up because they believe in him, and don't want to make him anymore mad than he is. Then, he takes over and doesn't allow anyone else collaborate about how things are going to work out (including the filmmakers). He tells them not to mess up and then he doesn't allow them to. There's no way that Troy Duffy was made to look bad by means of editing.  Look at the scene near the end when his brother and the rest of the band have meeting.  It follows these things: Troy lost all of his initial contracts for the band, movie, bar, etc., he makes the movie and takes it to the festival only to get scant distribution that doesn't make the money back. They get a record contract and release it, but it doesn't sell.  The band comes to him after the movie doesn't get distribution to tell him his focus must now be on the band and that they don't like the way he treats them and should change his ways, they say in the most loving way possible, and he doesn't listen to them. He just doesn't listen...that's what this movie is about: you need to listen to others, they aren't worthless.",1169510400,,1974,4.3743169398907105
2260442,4,B000929VTU,"He's pretty gross, but something got cut out of the movie, something that might have given it some balance.  As it stands you just get bored with seeing Troy Duffy attack anyone who dares criticize him.  Twice, three times, four times, that would have been enough to establish his character as a sociopath.  But directors Montana and Smith just play it over and over again, maybe forty-five times.  Enough!  I guess working with Troy didn't teach them anything about restraint.

Naturally the documentary makes me curious to see BOONDOCK SAINTS.  Most of the actors glimpsed in the movie, hanging out at Duffy's bar and grill, seem to be auditioning, like Patrick Swayze, a legend in Hollywood but a man who badly needs a shot of adrenaline career-wise.  When it comes to actually making the film, BOONDOCK SAINTS behind the scenes footage shows us more extended interviews with Willem Dafoe and with Scotland's Billy Connolly, who comes across as an honestly swell guy, not to mention a living legend, who must have been either momentarily blinded to Troy's faults, or he's big enough to forgive him.

Yes, life in Hollywood is surreal, like something Salvador Dali and Bunuel cooked up together on a slow Spanish afternoon.  And Harvey Weinstein seems like slime.  But Troy, did you have to be so condescending to every human being on planet earth?  Your mom should have told you, when you were a little boy, that you can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar.  Watching OVERNIGHT leaves you with a headache but I can't imagine anyone not profiting from watching at least 20 minutes of it.",1157673600,,1607,4.821167883211679
2260443,2,B000929VTU,"I don't agree with all those reviewers so eager to applaud the downfall of a ""blowhard.""

The filmmakers (his former friends) were clearly angry and out to make this man the biggest of *ssholes onscreen. I, in fact, felt very uncomfortable and depressed watching scene after scene depicting his egomaniacal fits and raging outbursts. You mean, there was NEVER a time when he was decent? How did he ever manage to maintain friends in his life? You mean he had NO good qualities? EVER? Hmm, I don't buy it.

This is the problem with nonfiction works, in general, which are highly susceptible to manipulation and ""being shaped"" via the process of editing. Just follow anyone over a period of months and you'll have enough raw material to make anyone out to be a monster. Crop out the good stuff, and leave in the bad; then pile up the bad: scene after scene of the subject being neurotic and fearful and losing control. Hey, every human being on earth has at one time or other behaved very badly. In the artworld, it happens more than you think. There's a basic insecurity driving all artists and writers and filmmakers. And artists in general are subject to failure and contempt and ridicule on a daily basis. All of 'em are a bit crazy, is what I'm saying. That's just the truth. Some folks are just better at hiding their ""illness"" than others.

If you've read the famous Vanity Fair article on Harvey Weinstein and Miramax, which depicted him as a true monster, continually threatening people with physical violence and casually throwing objects (like ashtrays) at his executives, you might decide to shift some of blame for this man's project, and his life, crashing and burning as it did, on him as well. Talk about a beast. It made me sick to see Harvey Weinstein make all these empty promises -- even going so far as to ""buy the bar"" for him -- and then just leave the man to hang in the wind, delivering on NONE of his promises. And blocking all future attempts by the filmmaker to make a go of it. What a bully, man. I'd like to see a documentary on him! In fact, that could be the title: BULLY.

Unlike other reviewers here, I felt no particular joy seeing this man's hope and dreams systematically crushed, one by one.  It's a miracle he didn't lose his mind. But then I guess he did.

The whole documentary was very depressing and sad and self-serving, I thought. And the filmmakers have now gone on to produce other work, flat-leaving their former friend, which is okay I guess (since they're ""the good ones"") and only goes to prove that everyone has a selfish agenda.

There's an unpleasant quality that human beings have: that of always seeking out an external ""villain"" -- which is in effect a projection of the nastiest aspects of themselves. The *ssholes are ""out there,"" right? We're always the good ones, the deserving ones. Uh, wrong. Hate to break the news, but we're all culpable; we're all sinners. So just be thankful that no one makes a documentary on YOU!

2260445,4,B000929VTU,"I'm surfing on the TV, and I came across this film on Sundance.  The first thing I see is Troy Duffy screaming into a cell phone with a torrent of profanity.  I thought it was a parody of a Hollywood #$%#$%.  It turns out it WAS a Hollywood $#%#$# named Troy Duffy.  While watching this, I was just amazed.  Troy Duffy sold a script to Miramax, got to direct it, plus a record deal for his band, The Brood.  Yet, he blew it all and so spectacularly.  I have heard it said and written that when you are successful, that brings out the real you.  Well, Troy is the biggest #$%#$ on the planet.  He screams, he yells, threatens people, keeps reminding everyone that he's the greatest artist on the planet, and that everyone around him should be fighting over who gets to lick his #$%#% (many actors stop by Troy's bar, and start fawning all over him, especially Mark Walhberg).  He says the right things in interviews, but behind the scenes his true personality is coming out.  It's kind of a shame because his film, The Boondock Saints, is a decent film.  It is not a Citizen Kane like debut (quite frankly, I'm surprised that Troy didn't compare his film to Kane), but Saints was entertaining.  It's pretty much a product of the 1990's, violent, profane, stylish, but no substance.  But since Troy is/was so difficult (to put it mildly), he has yet to make another film, and there's a good chance he won't.  Contrary to popular belief, you cannot get away with everything in Hollywood.  It is very similar to any other kind of business.  Duffy hadn't even had a track record yet, and started acting like a major jerk.  Miramax ended up putting Troy's script in turnaround, but he did secure financing for Boondock from other sources (at a fraction of the original budget).  A very small independent distributor picked up Saints, and it played a week in theaters and died.  Some have suggested that this film is very biased, and it never showed Troy's good side.  For my part, I can't possibly see any good from him, other than The Boondock Saints is a decent film.  A lot of directors nowadays expect to be treated like Spielberg and Kubrick right away.  They forget that Spielberg and Kubrick EARNED their power by being great filmmakers.  As for the actual documentary itself, it has its share of faults.  It doesn't really flow as a film, and it never actually explains why Harvey Weinstein and Miramax dropped Troy so quickly.  Was Troy really rude to Harvey?  We never get to hear and/or see that phone call.  Did Harvey just realise he made a mistake, and that the film ultimately couldn't live up to the media hype it was getting?  Harvey actually appears in the film where Troy is at Cannes trying to get distribution for his film, but there is no attempt to contact Harvey and ask him his opinion.  Considering Troy and his cohorts do nothing but trash Weinstein (and many other Hollywood heavyweights), it wouldn't surprise me if Troy told Harvey to kiss his rear.  None of these questions are ever really answered.  Troy has been playing the ""matyred artist"" card since his film debuted, and many people have bought into it (Saints has gotten some cult status on DVD).  I just think Troy suffers from the usual hubris and megalomania that #%$#% always do.  Troy never apologises to anyone, and seems to think he's perfect, and has done nothing wrong.  It's always someone else's fault, not his.  Well, has he learned anything?  Who knows?  There were rumours that a sequel to The Boondock Saints was in the works, but that's been a rumour for years, and nothing has come of it (so far).

It's amazing how little self-knowledge some people have; apparently novice filmmaker Troy Duffy had no idea how megalomanical and obnoxious he came off to other people.  This DVD really does restore your faith that some justice does exist.

There are a couple of mysteries that the film leaves unanswered.  One is why Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein dropped Duffy in the first place; another is whether Harvey really did blacklist Duffy's film, ""The Boondock Saints"".  There is an interview with a ""Washington Post"" reporter who describes Harvey's reactions.  Some more interviews with some objective sources, or with Harvey himself, might have added some needed perspective.  As it is, ""Overnight"" is a richly subjective look at the art of self-sabotage.

2260449,4,B000929VTU,"This movie and the accompanying rise and fall of Troy Duffy just goes to show that detached, narcissistic people can come from all social classes. Miramax pictures gives the blue-collar Duffy everything he ever wanted out of life by offering him a bar, a band contract, and the permission to make his own movie. He's got the world by the orbs but somehow he manages to bring about his own doom. Which brings us around to the only thing missing in an otherwise excellent documentary, not enough is revealed about the exact nature of Troy's decline. We are made privy to Miramax's change of attitude towards him but why did they suddenly hold him in such low esteem? What did he say? Who did he torment? I wish I knew. That would have made for a wonderful extra sequence in the movie.

The offensiveness of Duffy's personality is a major reason why this film is so fascinating. This fellow never seems to get tired of listening to himself talk yet he never has anything to say. He loves to pontificate but is work averse. The protagonist offers up a fine lesson for the young as he is proof that nothing good is ever produced by a negative attitude. A toxic personality is warmly received by no one. Duffy is a sadist who tortures his band, brother, and friends by making their life revolve around his. He forces his bandmates to live in poverty just to fulfill his lust for control. His paranoia leaks out onto an audience of students at Boston University, and one almost feels sorry for him due to the fact that those present have to know he's as mad as a hatter. Ultimately, Duffy is an important case study for those wishing to learn about narcissism. He also makes a fine subject for a documentary and I recommend this one wholeheartedly.",1139875200,,1741,4.544585987261146

It has a similar setup to that 9/11 documentary, in the sense that the film-makers - friends of Duffy, in the sense that Beast Man was a 'friend' of Skeletor - were originally going to make a straightforward documentary about an up-and-coming director, but disaster intervened and the film-makers ended up making a good egg out of a bad chicken.

You will notice that all the other reviews are actually about Troy, they are not really about the film. The film-makers have not made any other films, and although Overnight has nothing overtly wrong with it, it doesn't really tell us about anything except Troy Duffy. We learn almost nothing about the film he is making, a film which I have not seen, and have no desire to see. A top-quality documentary would have tried to put Troy into context - how did he get a film deal? How was he different from the other, similar, post-Tarantino movie brats such as Gary Fleder (""Things to do in Denver when you're dead"") or Alan Taylor (""Palookaville"") or a dozen others? Granted, those people are still working today, mostly in TV or direct-to-DVD, whereas Troy is not working at all, and so Troy must have been unusually crap, but it's hard to tell how unusually crap he must have been from the documentary.

The key thing for me is that, although Troy comes across as mindbendingly loud and profane, I was under the impression that all Hollywood producers and directors were like that. It is as if Troy is acting out a part that he has learned from watching documentaries about Hollywood film producers; for someone who had never directed or written a film before, he nonetheless manages to recover from a major setback (Miramax dumps him) and assemble a cast and direct a film which is released. That's more than I have done. We learn very little about this process - how did Troy make the film? Why did people put up with him? If he is capable of alienating his own brother, how did he direct actors? How come Willem Dafoe - an actor with a career - did not tell him to pip off? What stopped Billy Connolly from punching him out?

Troy is like R Lee Ermey in ""Full Metal Jacket"", in that he is a monster, but he is an entertaining and engaging monster. Eventually he becomes tiring, although there are a couple of memorably extended tirades (he is at his worst on the telephone), and the ending almost leaves you feeling sorry for him. He does have an odd charisma, and at the very least he gives the impression that he knows what he is doing. I can understand why people might follow him, even though he is not a Good King. The documentary leaves me wondering firstly what happened to Troy, and secondly how has Overnight itself affected his career? I only knew he existed because of this documentary, I imagine film producers are fully aware of it. I also wonder why the filmmakers themselves have done nothing since, not even on cable television.",1139097600,,3088,4.530465949820789
2260451,3,B000929VTU,"This is a documentary about the Director and creator of the movie Boondock Saints Troy Duffy. It is basically the documentarian following Duffy around from the time he gets a contract to produce his movie to his eventual crash at burn at his own arrogant hands and big obnoxious mouth. This is a classic story of a guy from nowhere who is handed the golden ticket and instead of being grateful and capitalizing, he becomes (or who knows he may have already been) a complete overbearing, obnoxious, egomaniacal jerk and blowhard and manages to alienate everybody around him including Harvey Wienstien the man who seemingly was giving him everything and who then subsequently realized what an ingrate this guy was and took it away leaving him with nothing. The best part of this movie is watching this arrogance run amok and out of control knowing that in the end that Duffy was going to get his just do and lose everything because of his own self centered abusive ego. This guy is so unpleasant and such a jerk that you can't help but feel good when he gets the carpet ripped right out from under him.",1138579200,,1100,4.61734693877551
2260452,5,B000929VTU,"I just saw this film on the Sundance Channel last night and I was simply amazed at how much of an arrogant moron that Troy Duffy is.

The guy gets a film deal and a record deal without any major experience in both fields. Instead of being grateful to the people who helped him achieve his dreams he is rude and obnoxious to them. Continuously he badmouths people who try to help him and keeps talking on and on about how famous he's going to be and how everybody in hollywood is going to kiss his arse. The thing about this documentary that really boggles my mind is that his friends let him get away with this behaviour. They just sit back and let him call them names and humiliate them.

Every film student should have to watch this film and learn exactly what not to do. Just because you get a movie deal doesn't mean that you are going to be famous or make money. Instead of making more films all Troy is now is a professional barfly.

I love The Boondock Saints but Troy Duffy is nothing but a bully who deserves what he got.",1134950400,,1030,4.218274111675127
2260453,4,B000929VTU,"What if your dreams of success, creative affirmation, and financial stability were about to come true?  Well, ""Overnight"" is a cautionary tale of what not to do if you find yourself in this rare situation.  There's a difference between a toe in the door and a seat at the table.""Overnight"" shows flash in the pan Hollywood sensation, Troy Duffy, as the man who never gets the concept.

Troy Duffy is a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking, cigarette puffing guy with no citable academic or career accomplishments.  Yet he fell ass backwards into the type of situation people dream about:  A movie deal (writing and directing), a record deal, and co-owner-ship of an increasingly popular glitterati drinking/slumming hole.  While doing an excellent job of showing Duffy plow into the ground with his engines still pushing harder, ""Overnight"" fails to capture exactly what event turned Troy's Midas touch into a sewage plant.  (Although I can understand that more than one or two meetings with this guy could turn just about anyone off.)  The addition of that angle is understandably hard to obtain considering the various players, yet ""Overnight"" still manages to engagingly chronicle Duffy's briefly rising star followed by his rapid descent into ego-driven self-destruction, paranoia, and sour grapes.

It would be instructive for an ""Overnight"" viewer to see Duffy's one and only movie ""The Boondock Saints"" beforehand (the nearly-straight-to-cable effort that he both wrote and directed).  The Boondock Saints is a genuinely enjoyable dark violent action movie, and it's particularly amazing when you consider that it was Duffy's first crack at anything remotely cinematic.  Overnight briefly shows Duffy on the set of ""TBS"" working as a director; one of the few sequences when we see him happy, affable, and accessible.  It's just too bad that this Troy Duffy completely disappears in almost every other aspect of his life.  (Interesting note:  The Boondock Saints DVD commentary track lays all the blame for the lack of mainstream marketing of the film on the Columbine shootings - an assertion almost completely erased by the events shown in Overnight.)

One bad play after another, one more verbal exchange carried to the limit.  The working class, boozing, smoking, urban toughie clich carried way to far, way to often.  Duffy doesn't burn bridges, he carpet bombs them and screams at the edges.  Whether he's alternately toadying, then threatening to play hardball with Harvey Weinstein, or working on his master plan to pit studios against each other to pump up his paydays (almost pathetic as Duffy straddles a 2nd-hand chair in a chintzy primer-coated office while chain-smoking in his bib overalls), or berating his friends and relatives as untalented hangers-on, he displays a supremely misplaced confidence in his own judgment in all matters.

Even as a potential source of information for others, he still can't quite stoop to their level.  Asked to discuss his particular path through Hollywood with some film students, Duffy dismisses them as mere dilettantes unable to understand the depths of his pain, the scale of his disappointment at the world's failure to revere his singular genius.  (Yes, even in the depth of his sorrows, Duffy's capacity surpasses the conception of all those around him.)

And it is a shame, there was some talent there.  At least for a while.",1129593600,,3380,5.195571955719557

There was a 5 second shot- from so far away they had to put a caption telling you it was Vincent that Troy was speaking to. If you enjoy listening to self-centered, lying, cheating people like Troy, then this is for you. If you want to see a real movie with real actors actually performing meaningful tasks, look elsewhere.

2260456,3,B000929VTU,"This documentary is about so much more than a character study of one big jerk.  It's also about an unspoken exchange by those so impressed with celebrity that they put up with that jerk's abhorrent behavior.  Troy keeps his abusive hold on his cohorts, so long as they perceive that they are also on their way to ""the big time"".  You see a look on their faces resembling hapless puppies ...too intimidated to speak up to Troy Duffy, the incipient Director maverick --that is, until his house of cards completely folds.  Then normal human boundaries resume and grievances are tabled.  That's the other side of the story.  That's the sickness of the whole system.

Within a cultural vacuum of values, a guy like Troy really COULD and usually does go far. His only mistake was that he revealed his ego-maniacal behavior too fast to the power-brokers that ""made"" him.

Again, Hubris like Troy's is alive and well in Hollywood.  His is a familiar personality-type that does set things in motion and gets things done.  As much as I hate to say it, it's true. Had his gestation into the entertainment world included a modicum of tact, we'd all be celebrating Mr. Duffy today as some sort of American treasure.  His story is much closer to the norm, vs. being an anomaly in terms of type.

Interestingly, even after experiencing a promising directorial career turned to shambles, the mechanisms of denial only enlarge.  Troy,  brimming with resentment for ""the system"" (a result of his self-inflicted travails), is invited to speak to a group of university film school students.  There he presses his advantage and systematically degrades the aspiring filmmakers in the most predatory question-and-answer session this side of the Jerry Springer Show.  The result could be comedic, except that you see each innocent soul being laid open like raw meat, as Troy gladly applies the salt.  This spectacle includes shots of the bow-tie-wearing, shrinking and silent professor.  Once again, all is tolerated because Troy's ""been to Hollywood"" and that's what's honored.

There's a lot to recommend here as an instructive example of the seedy edge of Filmland's deal-making (and breaking), as well as operant illustrations of sycophantic behavior.  It's a cautionary tale..  An old cliche is given new life:  Be careful of what you want.",1124582400,,2321,4.989583333333333

2260458,3,B000929VTU,"A Boston bartender (Troy Duffy) writes a screenplay with his band supplying the soundtrack and almost overnight, Harvey Weinstein (Miramax) gives him a chance at stardom nobody could ever dream of.  Bartender Duffy is portrayed throughout this documentary as a maniac intent on conquering the Hollywood world of idiots and proving that he is a genius of major proportions that will never be appreciated.  He is right - he never gets the appreciation he thinks he deserves.  It is an amazing film showing Duffy as a relentlessly driven person, who burns every bridge he can, insults every person he can and systematically destroys everything anyone could hope for.  His vulgarity and arrogance has no limit and it grows tiresome within minutes.  Initially, he is seen as crazy, then perhaps a person with a personality disorder and finally, in the last few scenes as a paranoid schizophrenic muttering to himself in an alley.  It is a story of a man who destroys himself and the people around him.  Unlike any other `car wreck' story, Duffy and his friends (the band ""Boondock Saints"") go from very modest beginnings to the heights of Hollywood, the Cannes Film Festival, the Palm Springs Film Festival and eventual destruction.  The band's record sold only 690 copies in the first year.  This documentary is more of an exercise in portraying a troubled man who unknowingly destroys everything and everyone around him, rather than a band with a film that had a great chance at stardom.

2260461,4,B000929VTU,"Troy Duffy was on the fast-track to become a Hollywood legend-while working as a bartender, he sold a screenplay to Miramax head Harvey Weinstein, got permission to direct it, and secured a recording deal for his band.  Unfortunately for himself, Duffy was an egotistical control freak who insisted on claiming all the glory and credit for the good things that happened to him and assigning blame for all of the bad.  This documentary chronicles his downfall as he disrespects and mistreats nearly everyone he encounters, ultimately losing all of his great opportunities.

When I first heard about this film, I wondered if anyone whose actions don't affect the public really deserves this kind of treatment.  I was also leery about the honesty of the filmmakers; after all, you could probably make anybody look bad with selective editing.  I still have some reservations, but after having seen the film, it's kind of hard to see how they could have edited it to make him look good.  He makes some stunningly unkind statements to people to whom he claims to be loyal and seems to revel in the chance to put others down and force them to acknowledge his ""superiority.""

This film serves as a cautionary tale about how not to treat people.  I imagine that Duffy will see this film someday if he hasn't already.  I wonder if being an observer will allow him to see his responsibility for his own downfall, or if he continues to see himself as the genius auteur who was brought down by foolish hangers-on and duplicitous studio people.",1118966400,,1530,4.787072243346008

I use the word ""friends"" losely, because as it becomes obvious in the film's opening minutes, Duffy is so rude and unlikeable that I truly doubt he can have actual friends.  When given a golden opportunity, instead of working 24/7, Duffy chooses instead to drink and drink and drink some more, all the while publicly mouthing off about half the powerplayers in Hollywood.  This is so the text book example of how NOT to behave.  Duffy becomes truly delusional by the end of the film, talking as if he were the most brilliant musician/filmmaker of all time, and mouthing off how no one understands his genius.  His abusive treatment of his brother and the two guys who co-managed his band (who were also the two who made the doc - brilliant move there!) is especially telling.  He treats everyone around him like crap, and it comes back not only to bite him, but to rip out his jugular.  Talk about a satisfying ending!  This is a GREAT MOVIE!

Working as a barman and member of a rock band, The Brood, Troy Duffy writes a screenplay and sells it to Miramax. They LOVE it, and give Duffy a 15 million dollar budget to make the movie. Here's the problem ... Troy Duffy. Obnoxious, loud, chain smoking, hard drinking Duffy has a wonderful way of giving himself all the credit for good things and outsourcing all the blame for bad things. His critical eye is incapable of being turned inwards as he micro manages his new world, and the new world of the band, into total ruin. Talk about not knowing when to shut up, Duffy absolutely refuses to listen or play the game despite the best advice of people who've moved in his new world for a long long time and know the players.

One by one the newly opened doors get slammed in Duffy's face but he insists he's the guy who knows what to do. His band members get shouted down by Duffy as they try to object to his decisions and his personality. Truly his own worse enemy Duffy disappears back into nothingness along with his band. As one of the voices in the documentary says ""He could have been the next Tarantino""

Honestly, as much as you squirm while watching Duffy throw water on his drowning self you will enjoy this and find yourself rooting for his demise. It's just a shame he had to drag his whole band down with him.
