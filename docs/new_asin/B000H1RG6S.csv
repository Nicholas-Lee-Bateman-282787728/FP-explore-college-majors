2625557,4,B000H1RG6S,"Ok, so I don't actually own THIS set of DVDs. I own YBB Total Toning Basics & Advanced Fat Burning, Cardio Caberet: Burlesque Style and Hip Hop Abs. I saw these on an infomercial and ordered the set. I was a little concerned because they are based on dancing, which I cannot do. I have no dancing background and have never danced at all (not even prom or school dances) so I wasn't sure I would be able to follow these. But Gillian and Teigh make it so much fun that you forget about not being able to dance and just do it anyway. After a few times you get much more comfortable with the routines and just let go and have fun. You'll feel like you're in class with them.

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because it's not really quite as much work or as much dancing as I would have liked. Because I don't know how to dance and I found the dancing parts of these videos to be so much fun, I would have liked for them to be longer. All in all, a great set. I love it.",1160438400,34,966,3.953846153846154
2625568,2,B000H1RG6S,"I bought the entire set and it is pretty difficult to do (if you don't have any experience with yoga like I do). It really should be marketed to those who already have extensive yoga experience. Also the ballet moves are simple but require lots of flexibility (so if you're not flexible, it will not be as useful). The hip hop part takes some getting used to and is so cheesy that I cringe! This series is way more complicated then they make it seem. I rarely use this set and would recommend going with another, less complicated series.",1271289600,3,537,4.434343434343434
2625569,5,B000H1RG6S,"I love YBB, I am a big time runner and i do this on my off days or days i just don't feel like running and sometime i do both. I look forward to doing my YBB workout and they give me peaces and energy. and even if you are way into working out, you will love these DVD. They are great for eveyone and anyone will enjoy them. They are fun!",1267833600,3,337,3.6944444444444446
2625570,5,B000H1RG6S,"I don't like working out...but I love yoga and dance. This is a fun but challenging work-out that I actually look forward to doing....it is inspiring, energetic and they have a range of class takers so that you can focus on different people for fun. LOVE IT!",1262131200,3,258,4.51063829787234
2625571,5,B000H1RG6S,"I love these workouts. They are easy to learn, they make me break a sweat, and the instructors are really fun and make me laugh. I've been doing them six days a week for over a month now and I have seen some amazing results- the best one being that I can now do TWO real push-ups! Yay! I'm not following the diet they included and I have not lost much weight but I've lost several inches, even still eating whatever I want. I dropped a pants size already! I'm also getting nice and firm, I can really see a difference in the muscle tone in my abs and my arms especially. I've gone on to buy some of their other YBB workouts as well.",1256342400,6,632,4.064
2625572,4,B000H1RG6S,"The videos are challenging and not as ""out there"" as I was afraid they would be.  The videos are actually inspiring.",1252540800,,116,4.523809523809524
2625573,5,B000H1RG6S,"I really like how they divide up the workout into 10 or 15 minute segments, it goes really fast.  Also the ladies are really likable and have very motivating physiques themselves!  It's actually inspired me to get back into yoga, so now I rotate between YBB and full on yoga--love it!!!!",1250726400,,287,4.607843137254902
2625574,1,B000H1RG6S,"I have never submitted a review up until now but felt compelled to warn others to avoid this ridiculous video set. I have a large collection of fitness DVDs and always workout at home and this one is by far the worst. I like to have fun and workout at the same time so I thought I'd give this one a try. Not only are the instructors some of the most annoying I've ever seen (constantly making weird noises ""Wah wah"" and giving useless instructions ""make it funky""), it seems like a crime to call it a ""workout"".
The main video has several extremely short segments with spastic dancing, simplistic ballet moves, and weights. Unfortunately, just as you felt you were starting to workout, it switched to a new segment. Plus, they don't tell you when purchasing the DVD that you will need a special ""squeeze ball"" that doesn't come with the kit (you have to send away for it).
The other two DVDs are Live dance segments that are very unrefined. The only way I can see anyone getting any type of workout is if you don't normally do much so a bit of bouncing around does the trick.
All in all, I would say don't waste your money.
A great other option that I love for a fun workout day is Dance off the Inches: Hip Hop Party w/ Jennifer Galardi - much more what I was looking for.",1247702400,16,1273,4.286307053941909
2625575,5,B000H1RG6S,"Yoga Bootie Ballet, instructions are great easy to follow. I lost over 5 inches first week. Works all areas of the body. Only CD you'll need. Men and woman both can use.",1239062400,3,169,4.3125
2625576,5,B000H1RG6S,"I first borrowed this DVD from the library.  I had seen infomercials before, but never thought of using it.  After two trials, I went out and bought the system for myself.  It is a great, non-impact workout.  When I was ready for the each portion to end, it did.  In the basic toning workout, there are about 10 minutes of each, yoga, booty exercise, and ballet.  Just enough time to feel it, but not too long where you get burnt out.  I would recommend this workout to anyone - seriously!",1238803200,3,489,4.366666666666666
2625577,4,B000H1RG6S,"I've read a bunch of the reviews here and feel like I have to chime in.  I feel this pack is a bit of a mixed bag.  I have a lot of YBB dvds.  I hardly ever do Total Toning Basics.  I only occasionally do Advanced Fat Burning.  These are the two dvds that people complain about when they say there is too much ""mumbo jumbo."" I somewhat agree... They spend quite a long time at the beginning speaking about setting intentions and breathing. But, once these two begin, they both have a good mix of cardio, yoga, and ballet.

The YBB Live! dvds, though, are another story because they are *so*, *so* fun!  I can't rave enough about these. (In this set, you will find Hip Hops Abs and Cardio Cabaret.) While not as intense as some other workouts I do, I will pull out any of these on days when I want to do some good cardio with a touch of toning.  They are definitely go-to dvds on days when I don't feel much like working out. They get the blood pumping and CC has a nice ballet section.

And did I mention they are fun? :) I brought Hip Hop Abs to a Master's class I was taking and showed a clip. Everyone, I mean everyone, absolutely loved it, wanted to borrow it. I know that some people here find Gillian (the blonde one) somewhat annoying, and I can understand how she might grate on some. But she moves well and, in the end, both instructors are motivating and affirming. I always feel great when I finish their workouts--not worn-out, but energized and centered.",1237161600,5,1467,4.2671480144404335
2625578,1,B000H1RG6S,"this is the worst exercise dvd i have ever wasted my money buying.  The girls are total dorks and annoy the crap out of me, the whole exercise program was unbelievable i can't describe how bad this dvd is.  Save your money and buy Brian Kest instead, yes he can be abit of a dork too but his workout are awesome.  The dancing section they have on their dvd prove that they are not dancers the choregraphy is terrible.  I absolutely hated this product that i threw it away.",1230940800,3,472,4.269662921348314
2625579,5,B000H1RG6S,"I am a 17 year old, looking for a way to lose wight but make it fun. I hate going to the gym and other excerizing tapes like Billy Blanks Bootcamp are not fun either. For awhile I did billy blanks ,and was not happy with the results, because it seemed like all my muscle turned out really bulky and the other thing that really annoyed me was that Billy Blanks made if harder for me to want to work out with him because he would do 1 or 2 squats with you and then shout at you to do like 6 more sets of 8. It just got tiring really fast, and it was hard for me to wake up each day because it was such a dread to workout.

Then I saw the informercial for Yoga Booty Ballet. It looked like a lot of fun, and I had to try it.

I am happy to say that this is a faboulous workout system! It has really worked for me. My whole body is getting toned and shaped everyday it seems. I feel the burn each time I do the workouts and sweat up a storm ( which was a big concern of my parents becauset they were afriad I wasn't going to get enough of a workout). In this set you get 5 different dvds to workout to.

In the Guided Meditaion, it is pretty simple . Mainly Gillian and Teigh show the safe way on how to do squats and plies so you don't hurt a bad back or bad knees, they also show some meditions that they do in other films so you can familerize yourself with them. 10 minutes total.

Next in the seris is the Total Toning Basics. You start off by doing some medition,and then move into a warmup/dance workout. The Ballet section is a short section however it really works on toning the abs,arms(for you hold your arms out to balance your self ,and you hold them in many differnt postures)and it works really well on the outter thigh and booty. You then do some cardio with 2-3 pound weights in your hands so you can tone your arms. Yoga poses come next and it's a workout, not the gental yoga poses. Next you do so ab work,with the siquishy ball( you can use a pillow if you wish) it really does workout the abs and inner thigh. Then you meet Teigh and Gillian for the cool down section( which don't ignore the cool down for it really help strech out your back)then finally you see teigh and gillian together for some medition. 45 mins in total.

Advanced Fat Burning is another workout that makes your body feel amazing. Start off with Teigh and Gillian in meditions, then into a blend of warm up's and cardio, next is a good 15 minute segement on ballet where you tone your abs,arms,booty,calfs,and thighs (helps with your center of balance too)Then you do some gental yoga poses and then you go back to medition with gillian and teigh. 60 mins total.

With this workout system you get two YBB live sets , the first being Cardio Caberet and the second being Hip Hop Abs.

Cardio Caberet starts of with a warm up and some medition. Then you do a cardio workout that makes you feel oh so sexy, and then you do some ballet and cool down and then end it off with medition. 35 mins total.

Hip Hop Abs starts off with once again medition and warm ups (please note that each warm up and medition is diffent in each dvd. I just can't repeat the names of the excersizes because I can't say them or spell them) Then you do the cardio section which is dancing and working up a sweat, and in this one you do ab work , some push ups, the plank and tiny bit of yoga, you don't do any ballet steps in this workout. 45 mins total.

Each workout is so unique and so much fun. Now some people may think that the instuctors are too out their and are annoying. I personally like them for their personality because they truly had/have inspired me to do the best I can do. Another thing people find annoying is their breathing when they do to the medition section because they breathe loudly, but they are only doing that , so you know when to inhale and when to exhale. Teigh and Gillian workout with you and don't just shout out orders like Billy Blanks does. They make you feel so sexy and like a goddess.

The dancing might be way out their for people too, but don't be so shy. You can do this workout in your living room  and nobody cares , and eventually if you do the workouts over and over again, you will get better at the dance steps, and become dancing machine.

Please be open minded to this product and try it yourself to see the results. You won't be dissapointed.",1230508800,20,4357,4.14319526627219
2625580,2,B000H1RG6S,"I bought this because I have turbo jam which I love.  I thought this would be good too because it's by beach body.  I was wrong - I didn't like this one at all.  I thought the instructors were as cheesy as the title, the moves were weird and not easy to follow.  I've taken many different yoga classes and this seemed like they made up they're own version.  Would NOT recommend.",1228176000,3,378,4.194444444444445
2625581,1,B000H1RG6S,I am so sorry I wasted my money. The cover is so decieving. It looks all clean and up beat and fun. It is nothing like the cover. It seemed a bunch of religous mumbo jumbo. I tried to watch it several times but finally threw it away. I could't get to the exercise though the junk! I wouldn't have given it one star but the rating system had to start some where. Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.,1223856000,4,406,3.9634146341463414
2625582,5,B000H1RG6S,"Fun, easy workout that you actually don't want to stop. The mix of the yoga and ballet movements (which you don't have to be an expert on) along with the meditation makes this workout physically powerful and relaxing at the same time. Definitely a way to loose all the stress and escape from your daily craziness.",1222041600,3,313,4.607142857142857

2625585,3,B000H1RG6S,"Like the other reviews, I have to admit it's super corny. I had a hard time getting through some of it because I'm pretty much the opposite of perky. However, I'm not one to say without dedication this wouldn't work. I know I broke a sweat everytime I used it. It's not crazy high impact but it does get your muscles going. If I couldn't give anyone who bought this and hates it any advice, it would be to just see it as a personal challenge. Forget the ladies and their perky moodra stuff, and focus on mastering the moves and the technique. Learning the moves is all that reall matters.",1218499200,2,588,4.306306306306307
2625586,4,B000H1RG6S,"My wife has lost a total of 12 lbs after eating better and starting Yoga Booty Ballet. She has become more tone and energetic. She likes the way that it combines cardio, ballet, yoga and weights in one package. It is definitely a total body workout.

2625587,3,B000H1RG6S,"I can't speak for the quality of the workout itself, because I didn't last that long. The women leading the workout were just so annoying I couldn't take it, so I turned it off. It could be the greatest workout ever for all I know. But I have a low tolerance for over-the-top bubbly/goofy too perky types. And some of the moves were just plain silly. I just kept thinking ""what drugs are these chicks on???"" Anyway, if that type of personality motivates you, by all means buy it. It just doesn't motivate me. All I was motivated to do was climb through the tv, tie them up, and put tape over their mouths. haha!",1215648000,,611,4.321739130434783
2625588,5,B000H1RG6S,"I bought this at a garage sale and just love it! I mostly do just the first DVD for now as I am a beginner. The basic training has moves that are easy to follow and give my muscles a great work out. The cardio cabaret and the hip hop workouts are much harder to follow as the moves change very quickly, but as I said I am a beginner.

What I like about this workout is that I only need a couple of small weights, which I already had, and the ball that comes with it. That is a big change for me since I bought two different workouts from ""The Firm"" only to open the box and realize that I needed to buy a bunch of other stuff that needed to be moved around every minute during the workouts. By the way I can already see results and it has only been a week (I worked out every day)",1213401600,2,780,3.8447204968944098
2625589,3,B000H1RG6S,"This isn't as good as I'd hoped it to be.  For me, the music is distracting, just too much, not my taste.  I like the hip hop abs and the burlesque dance workouts the best; they are fun.  I was hoping for more ballet too.  It seems like its got way more yoga than ballet.  Also, this doesn't come with the squishy ball, you have to order it separately from beachbody, though they do give you a free coupon for it.  You will still have to pay for shipping though, about $5.  Overall, this video series is just OK.  Maybe I'll like it more the more I use it and get the hang of it, but for now, its just OK.",1212192000,,605,3.9421487603305785
2625590,5,B000H1RG6S,"I really enjoy the workouts and the style of these DVDs.  The instructors are fun and a little funky!  I also like that they start all thw routines with an ""intention"", or goal, for the workout and for yourself.",1210291200,,211,4.384615384615385
2625591,5,B000H1RG6S,"I love my Yoga Booty Ballet!

To preface, I'm a person who doesn't work out very much, although I'm in decent shape. I don't have much in the way of a yoga background, and I've seen some reviewers who come off as having more experience with working out than I do (maybe?) who don't like their style. I can see that it might seem a bit lame for more advanced folks. However, as a laid-back beginner, it works for me. I usually have trouble sticking to workout routines and don't normally like exercise videos (I'm not what you'd call coordinated and most go way too fast for me). After a doing this one a couple of times and learning the names for various moves, I had no trouble following along because they are good at giving advance notice of the next move. I like that it opens and closes with self-affirming meditations and keeps things mixed up in terms of the workouts. I appreciate that they have an advanced section, so that when I get bored with/used to the basics, I can up my game. They are cheesy at times, and Ravi on the drums makes me giggle, but I like their chatter--it's encouraging to me to not have a drill sergeant at the helm, but someone who figures I might fall over during the ballet routine and is perfectly okay with that. :-)

Practically speaking, it's not that strenuous of a workout, but it gets me toned all over and I feel it when I'm done. I'm losing more inches than weight, and that's more important to me. I'm really toning up my abs, which is my worst trouble spot--they're looking awesome, by the way. :-) Also, I feel great when I finish and other people have noticed my physique has been getting more fit.

I highly recommend this for people who are just looking for a fun, low-stress, low-stakes way to get fit and be healthy, possibly easing into a more serious routine.",1207440000,4,1813,4.405970149253731

I've moved on to Women Health's DVD's and they are without a doubt a  superior workout if you're looking for something more challenging in terms of cardio and sculpting.",1202515200,,653,4.396694214876033

If you are expecting a mostly dance workout or a workout where you won't need to get on the floor and do situps then this is not the workout for you.  This could have been my mistake, but I didn't think I would be spending long periods of time sqatting, doing leg lifts, and doing situps while squeezing a ball. Those are all the same exercises I've been told to do for ages and I hate them but they're here in Yoga Booty Ballet. One of the DVDs is more of a herky jerky dance dvd, but it all leads back to the same old exercises at the end.  On top of it all, the music is dull and rather off beat most of the time.

I believe this workout will produce results if done continually because it IS filled with a lot of the moves we already know to be affective, but this is not a fun, innovative, energy filled dvd. It is just another exercise tape.",1200528000,3,1047,4.898305084745763

I rented and am so glad I did.  My eyes were rolling the whole time and many of the cardio ""booty"" workouts are just awful--literally ridiculous. The changes they make to moves and the speed they start at in the intro video might actually injure someone less limber.

2625606,2,B000H1RG6S,"I've heard people say this is a great workout for when they don't want to work out.  Is that supposed to be a selling point?  These DVDs are best for beginners as far as cardio (aka, WEIGHT LOSS) goes. The cardio is corny, over-choreographed suburban-housewives-trying-to-be-hip style foolishness, and is simply not going to challenge you for long because despite all the bopping and vogueing, you're using almost no muscle strength to execute the moves. On the other hand, most of the yoga seems geared to the intermediate level, and little is offered to those lacking the flexibility, strength, or desire to hold ""down dog.""  The ""ballet"" part consists mostly of a zillion standing rear leg lifts and 2 or 3 calf raises and plies.  And this shapes your legs how??  The ab workouts are too short and easy to make any difference.  I resent it when I'm doing a series of DVDs and I KNOW this is not what the instructors do to look the way they do.  Even if you find Yoga Booty Ballet entertaining, I wonder how you'll feel after a few months when you're not getting the results you want, and if you'll get turned off exercise because of it.  If you like simple dance moves that make you feel cool and actually work your body, I suggest the Turbo Jam DVDs.",1188604800,7,1254,4.542222222222223

I am really only using the first DVD (basic) I really haven't tried all the dancing moves yet, they look like they are doing a broadway musical on the advanced. Great toning and goes by fast. My favorite tape so far. and great ab series",1188172800,2,315,4.180327868852459

Disk 1: Rehearsal/Meditation, Beginner & Advanced
disk 2: yoga booty hip hop abs
Disk 3: yoga booty ballet cabaret

I love Teigh McDonough from her Yoga Fusion Abs & Power VHS that incorporated dance & Qi Gong with pilates & yoga. She has great body awareness & knows what stretches, poses, moves feel great in what order to keep you inspired to keep opening up your body. I always feel very energized & positive after doing any of their DVDs & it makes me want to exercise even more! Their positive words of encouragement are empowering & were helpful to make me want to do this again & again. Gillian & Teigh have great body awareness and have great focused energy while still reminding you to always have fun & have the correct intentions as great as any great guru yogi master. (Teigh studied studied Kundalini yoga and meditation under Siri Sat Nam Singh for over 8 years & Anusara yoga with Desiree Rumbaugh and John Friend.) This is not fluff or woo-woo but a spiritual connection to your own body & nature w/o sarcasm or fear.

Disk 1: Beautiful perfect colors/nature backgrounds, high production value, great worldbeat, new age music w/great beats
Rehearsal & Guided Meditation:
Intro -  3 min - of telling you about what the system offers & what they focus on.
Teaching -  6 min - of them teaching you uji simple deep breathing, proper posture for toning section, how to do downward facing dog, proper posture for ballet plies & squats, recommend barefoot except toning sections, to be relaxed & enjoy the workouts, a mudra & positive mantra to end. Ravi plays drums several yards behind them.
Guided Meditation -  5 min - of female narration w/watching a mostly paused by occasional moving sunrise over high altitude mountain tops & clouds guiding you to relax your body & be more aware of it.
I didn't learn that much, they could have taught more, what they taught was good, but they have great energy & true good intentions.

Beginner Workout: 45 min
Intro - 1 min - of disclaimers, short mudra to bring your focus to your body.
Warm up -  8 min - w/Teigh, Gillian w/1 guy & 1 guy in great shape & 1 girl who's about 40 lbs overweight w/Ravi playing in the foreground.  They are outside by mountain side w/ocean behind them. Breathing, step touches, zig zag, hip circles, torso roll down & ups, side stretches/hamstring, torso 360 circle stretches, squat stretches, more leg stretches in a dance flow style. Very fun & easy & felt stretched out & refreshed.
Ballet - 7 min - of Gillian & Teigh alone w/Ravi in the back by small man made waterfall & nice trees. Raised single leg & pulsed forward & behind, repeat on other side, 1 legged squats that are a great stretch for the glutes, repeat leg lifts, glut stretch again, side leg lifts w/turn in instead of turn outs to focus on glutes, repeat on other side, stretch glutes, repeat side stretches. A little boring, but not too bad, my legs & butt felted more toned & increased balance.
Toning/Sculpting - 9 min - Teigh & Gillian & guy outside with beautiful greek/roman white columns & steps ala coliseum look w/beautiful red fabric draped on either side of columns. Ravi is sitting on top of columns playing drums. Basic 2-3 lb weights, squats/plies, squats w/arm raises to shoulder level, step touches w/same arms, squats w/same arms, step touches w/arms, squats w/arms raised to the sky, step touches w/those arms, standing oblique side torso bends w/weights in hands, squats/plies & step touches w/arms tight to ribs to chest, squats & step touches w/weights behind head for tricep toning, tight knees together squats w/arms outward to join together in middle & up close to chest for biceps, then weights dropped for a few seconds of light dancing flow for stretching out arms & legs. I don't do weights, too boring for me, so I skipped this section.
Yoga - 7 min - w/Teigh, Gillian & same other people as before w/Ravi playing to the side. They are outside by mountain side w/ocean behind them. Simple arms, standing fwd bend, downward facing dog, upward dog,  beetle squat (move up/down a little, very good stretch good for reproductive organs), down dog w/alternate knee bends, single leg downdog, knee to chest from that 1 leg down dog & repeat 2x, child's pose, swimming up/down torso for stretch, swimming to side to side while down for side stretching, then raise to knees from side to side & kneel to end.
They move at a fairly fast pace, this is not for anyone who doesn't already know yoga by their names & can do the poses in only a single breath. I felt good stretched out & refreshed, could have been a little more varied. The guide book (I didn't see it) may spell out more detailed information about the yoga poses for those new to it.
Toning - 6 min  - Gillian, Teigh & guy w/same location as the sculpting workout, using squishy ball, but a pilates circle or pillow is fine between knees w/crunches, then ball between thighs & more crunches, ball behind knees w/reverse sit ups w/upper torso relaxed & then upper torso crunching at same time, rest by just squeezing thighs, rest w/legs in butterfly, knees in chest, roll like ball & done.
Cool Down - 5 min - outside same beautiful place, w/all the people from before, reclined on elbows, knees in circles, butterfly stretch, sitting wide legged side stretches & fwd bend, kundalini torso circles, standing fwd bend, wide 360 torso circles
Ending Mudra - 2 min - Gillian & Teigh alone again by koi pond & pool for last positive affirmations.

Advanced Workout: 52 min
Intro - 6 min  min - Gillian & Teigh alone again by koi pond & pool for mudra/affirmations w/kundalini torso circles w/breath, torso back/forth w/breath.
Dancing - 24 min - Teigh & Gillian, same guy from before, 2 in shape women, 1 from before who looks 40 lbs overweight, outside with beautiful greek/roman coral now columns & steps ala coliseum look w/beautiful white fabric draped on either side of each of the columns. Ravi is sitting on the top step playing while women on the bottom below the 4 steps. On hands/knees go to downward dog w/bended knees & heels up/down & some kinda squats, then standing w/arm stretch dance flow, more dance flow stretch arms, hip circles, hip bumps, standing wide leg fwd bend, side angle pose, hamstring/thigh stretches, plies, dancy arm & shoulder moves/stretches, walking backwards w/back kick, snake, couple small jazzy stuff, hint of hip hop, v step, mambo w/cha cha, etc., ends with some cool down plies. Very easy movements, but very fast paced, not much teaching, but you'll be able to get it.
Ballet - 15 min - Teigh & Gillian w/one in shape girl outside on hillside w/ocean background again. Backup girl using a pole/bar for balance. Side single leg lifts up/down on both sides 3x, then holding it steady up both sides, then side single legs lifts both sides like 5x, then single leg squat that stretches glut well, hip circles, glut stretch, yoga tree pose, dancing shiva pose (single leg lifted), knee to straight leg forward kicks & then with tightened belly, small plies, small plies w/on relieve (tip toes), tandu? (simple toe stretched touches & foot slide backs) both fwd & back on both sides, then simple leg lifts forward & back, simple plies & glut stretch, other side leg lifts fwd & back, repeat again 2x, standing leg glut stretches, ends w/deep plies. I felt it pretty well, not boring, love the glut stretches.

Starts w/pigeon stretch & goes to advance form grabbing back leg as well, regular sitting torso twist, indian style, but on top of each other simple fwd bend. Very nice deep stretches don't normally see on most yoga dvds except that torso twist is pretty standard.
Mediation - 3 min - outside again on hillside, narrated voice over, reclined butterfly & lying star pose
Mudra/End - 1 min - Gillian & Teigh alone again by koi pond & pool for last positive affirmations of self-love.

Look to the yoga booty hip hop abs & cabaret pages for my review there. I actually like those better then the beginner/advanced here since there seems so much focus on it looking beautiful & great fade in/outs & perfect camera angles & close ups that I don't get the same positive feel I felt from the hip hop abs, cabaret, light/easy, Latin, & Master Series - Goddess Booty/Yoga Core. I love the Master series the best with Teigh & Gillian alone w/o all the distractions. They have such great energy. Yes, they can be a bit too corny, mostly Gillian, but she CAN dance & wish they would keep the dancing more cool latin, sexy, bellydance, ballet, jazzy, hip hop... nothing purposely corny or silly/embarrassing. (The Latin & Light/Easy are the worst ones, the rest doable.)",1187222400,22,8960,4.651926721415035

They may be frustrating if you don't give yourself a break... you can learn some fun dance moves to use elsewhere, too!  The women on the videos have beautiful bodies worth aspiring to, they are strong and lean.  Since this system contains 5 workouts, by buying this product I have had several weeks of workouts that I haven't gotten bored with.

There is a weight lifting segment, dance technique for arms, buns, thighs, and cardio dancing.  You can work every part of your body in 1 video.

2625622,4,B000H1RG6S,"I use this workout at home when I don't have time to go to the gym. It's sort of a guilty pleasure because the infomercials (and the workout) are so cheesy. The dvds are really fun and I love the instructors.

I have done both yoga and (a little) ballet and the moves they use are quite good. The ballet is basic and effective (they also tell you when they're doing a turnout that's not normally used in ballet, and you can tell from their movement that the instructors are experienced dancers). The yoga is good, could use better cuing in one of the videos (I spent an uncomfortable amount of time in chattaranga before realizing others had moved on).

The thing I like best is that they try to get your heart rate up during the toning videos, which makes those workouts very satisfying. I felt like the basic and advanced toning videos were of similar levels of difficulty (perhaps because I used heavier weights in the basic video), so if you can do one, the other is worthwhile too. Make sure you have a couple of levels of weights handy because the toning videos are more effective if you're using more weight on biceps and less weight on triceps. I used 10 lbs for some of the easier stuff, 5 lbs for most of it, and 3 lbs for the harder stuff.

The reason I docked them a star was because of the squishy ball. I guess if you have a nerf ball you can use that but I have been trying to use a medicine ball and it just isn't a good substitute. I pulled some kind of weird muscle in my butt after using a medicine ball and ended up doing other ab work instead during their abs sections. They suggest a pillow but maybe my pillows are too soft to be effective. It's probably worth it to pay the extra money to order the version with the ball -- the one I got had a coupon but you'd still have to pay extra for shipping.",1178928000,10,1822,4.2

2625625,4,B000H1RG6S,I added this routine into my workout library and I have quite a collection of workout dvd's and find it great for days when I need something that is more fun and uplighting. I always have a good time when I use thses videos. The instrutors are great and they make you feel good about yourself. The dance steps are taught a little fast at first but after a few attemps it is not hard to follow. I like the yoga sections that are incoporated into the routine. I have found that if you want to  make the ab section more challenging substitute a weighted ball for the beach body squishy ball used and you will increase the intensity. Over-all this is a good series. I have already bought several others and have a fun time when I use these videos. As far as weight lose goes I am not sure because I do other programs as well and I am in good shape and do not really want to loose wight just tone and stay that way.,1178496000,3,910,4.112359550561798

I bought the tapes and i have already lost inches and 5 pounds.  I love the fact that it involves dancing and ballet.  I am a pilates lover so i knew this is something i would like.  It is a great workout and keeps you moving constantly.

I love the fact there are 3 tapes and you can pick which one you want to choose.  I also like that you can add your own moves and techniques with some of the dances.  The tapes work on your buns, thighs, and hips..and that is where i really need it.

I will say the only thing that i do not like on the tapes is when they start talking about different gods and spirits. The instructors do alot of meditating and i do not involve myself with this.  I just press fast forward to get through those scenes.

I have given it 5 Stars because it has gotten the job done for me.  I would like to lose 10 more pounds and i know if i continue with this workout i will lose more!!

2625627,5,B000H1RG6S,"I've been doing The Firm, pilates, and yoga for years. I also run regularly. What I love about this workout is that it reminded me of what it's like to move around as a kid...it's not serious business, it's fun.

I do think you get out of it what you put in. For example, I engage my abs the entire time, which I could feel throughout the workout. I doubt people without yoga or dance training know what it means to work from the core so they're not going to get it.

Because I really enjoyed it, I wondered if I'd get results with it. I hope so, because it sure beats killing my knees and other areas of my body pounding away with other boring workouts.

Growing up I was in dance (ballet and cheer) and so I love working to get the form of the dance moves just right.

I could see how someone who didn't have any dance, pilates, or yoga technique training wouldn't get it, but for those of you who do, it's fun to reconnect w/ the moves. I love light-hearted approach. I think it's good to workout with your head in a happy space. I'm convinced you'll get better results.

2625628,2,B000H1RG6S,"I bought this workout series directly from Beach Body after succumbing to the informercial, which made it sound like a combination of dance and yoga. basically I was expecting good choreographies for the cardio part, ballet-inspired moves and maybe power yoga for toning and yoga stretches for the cooldown.

Boy, was I wrong.

What I got was this strange mix of new age, odd ""dance"" routines with lots of silly moves (supposed to be fun but I felt riduculous), boring old weight lifting but ""light weights and high reps so you don't bulk up"" (boy I didn't think anyone fell for that anymore) with a few short segments featuring good moves, but way too short and too few. On top of it, the style really didin't appeal to me: it was the overly-perky, constant chatter, Denise Austin-style that some find motivating but others (like me) find just annoying and distracting.

I don't doubt that this will be of help to some, especially someone who is just starting out and doesn't want to feel like she's working out, but for everyone else, I'd recommend you look elsewhere.",1177372800,33,1070,4.741935483870968

Then I decided to try it once before getting rid of it, and I was SO wrong.  The instructors are fun and fabulous and the whole workout makes me smile.  I then ordered the complete workout, have since ordered YBB Light & Easy/Latin Flavor, and I just pre-ordered the newest one.  There's just something about it.  They are all good workouts that are also somehow empowering and centering.  Like others have said, unless you are a dance master, you will not get the moves down perfectly even after 2 or 3 times, but, as long as you keep moving, it's a good workout and fun even when you don't get it.",1176681600,10,862,4.277777777777778

The stars of the video are a little dry but the moves and exercises definitely target what you need to target.

You will need small weights for some of the sculpting sections, as well as a squishy ball for others (although a small ball or pillow will do the trick for those exercises)

My one negative comment is that the ""how to"" part is a bit overlooked for a beginner; often going quickly from one pose to another without good video footage or verbalization.  I found this a bit frustrating to keep up, but hopefully after a few weeks, it will all come more naturally and the routines will go more smooth for me.",1175731200,3,870,4.481012658227848

The workouts are fun, and I must admit that even though I work out regularly, my muscles were sore after the first couple of workouts. I've been doing it for about two weeks, and I feel stronger and more connected to my body.  Cardio Cabaret and Total Toning Basics are my favorite workouts from the series.

This workout series is probably not for everyone. The ladies use a lot of yoga terminology and meditation, and if you're the type of person who likes to jump right into it, this might annoy you. However, I figure that since mind and body are connected, a little motivation and ""spiritual"" connection can't hurt. The yoga meditation actually forces me to leave the 'real world' and focus more on the exercises. My mind doesn't wander like it does with other workouts.

I've read some of the other reviews here, and I do agree that cueing could be better. Also, some of the camera angles are so artistic that you can't see what the instructors are doing.

2625641,5,B000H1RG6S,"I have several yoga and pilates videos but have found them very difficult to follow.  I am recovering from a knee injury and was looking for a way to stay in shape while being out of action in ballet.  I regularly take 5 advanced ballet classes a week, plus rehearsals, plus strength training and pilates after every class .  Even for someone who has the ""dancer's legs"" these workouts are a challenge.  You definitely feel the burn with these videos.  The workouts also do not bother my knee at all so I would say they are pretty low impact.

I didn't really read many reviews of the product before purchasing it so I didn't know that there is quite a bit of focus on meditation.  Being Buddhist I personally like the guided meditation sessions provided.  I feel they are an excellent way to bring yourself down after an intense workout.

The only thing I don't really like is there is not enough time given on the cool downs.  I regularly find myself stretching for a good 20 minutes after the workouts to feel adequately stretched out and cooled down.  Other than that I would definitely recommend these videos to anyone.",1171670400,17,1124,4.57
2625642,5,B000H1RG6S,"As a dedicated user of exercise videos since the mid-1980s, I've found that the newer ones are getting more & more effective.  YBB is the best yet.  The results are phenomenal -- a really pretty flattening of the abs, similar to Pilates but without the neck strain.  My upper arms & thighs (always heavy) are thinning out too, after only 2 weeks.

A few warnings:  the dance steps may be tricky for beginners.  They move fast.  Also, this is one workout that works the back as much as the abs.  If you already have back problems, you should probably stay away from YBB.  Finally, the instructors are ""California goofy.""  If you can relax & enjoy that, fine.  Their emphasis on the spiritual side of yoga might irritate some.  I figure what the heck, it couldn't hurt.

I spent years convinced that the only way to change my shape was with weights.  Unfortunately one of those changes is a certain bulkiness that I don't like.  The Firm comes to mind:  they're always saying weights won't give women big muscles, like men.  Well, they do thicken you, and after more than 10 years of using The Firm, I backed away.  I much prefer the look of a yoga/pilates/ballet body, and YBB incorporates them all.  Other advantages:  a stronger back (I can finally sit up straight in a cross-legged seat without bracing myself), better balance and an energy boost.",1171411200,64,1349,4.635593220338983

I'm a fairly advanced user, very active with a lot of cardio and yoga experience.  I would not recommend this for beginners - it's hardly a workout, but the moves are confusing.  The camera work is terrible, with narcissitic close-ups when they should be showing you moves.  You often can't see what they're doing & the verbal cues are useless.

The video portions of the techniques and poses could be of better quality.  The shots of the drummer don't really help in the instruction and seem to be more for artistic affect.  The backdrops are beautiful, but I've have a Yoga DVD where the room is just a studio with solid lighting, and simple furniture and it was beautiful as well, and the video quality better.

The instructors know what they are doing. This I expected.
They give clear direction at points that if  you need to take your time, or slow down, or go at your own pace you were encouraged to do so, which I appreciated.  People need to know this.

The packaging and leaflets mentioned nothing about needing weights, which I find is a very important oversight that people should know about. What other props or accessories do I need to follow along in the video.

The daily guide to using the 3 DVD set was good. Without that I would have been lost as to how to arrange the usage of the 3 DVDs.

8135884,1,B000H1RG6S,"I bought this years ago, worked out to it some, and then set it aside for a long time.  (I got a set that included these DVDs and also the little ball.  More on that in a moment.)  I recently picked these DVDs back up again, tried a workout, and have now decided this is going to Goodwill on my next trip there.  (For reference, I consider myself an advanced exerciser.)

First off, I wouldn't call the yoga sections ""religious,"" but I can see how they might be off-putting to people of certain religious backgrounds who are mostly in this for the exercise.  There's all the ""set your intention"" stuff.  I skip these parts because setting intentions is not really my cup of tea.  I'm not a ""new age"" sort of person.  Just hit ""next track"" on your DVD remote and a lot of that problem is gone.

My main beef with these is that they are not particularly good exercise.  The idea is that you are combining some cardio, some yoga, and some ballet-style toning moves into one workout.  Theoretically, that sounds promising.  But you don't do any of those things for long enough to actually feel it.  I kind of remembered being challenged by the cardio section (with hand weights) from the beginner DVD, way back when.  So I tried it again last week and it is only 8 minutes long!  8 minutes of cardio is not going to burn nearly enough calories to make it worth my time to even put in the DVD.  (I have been counting calories all year so I have a good sense of what I need to do, to fit into my calorie goals.  And it is not this.)  It didn't get my heart rate up and didn't make me break a sweat.  At all.

The yoga can be challenging if you are new to yoga.  But it is pretty much just vinyasa (so, flow yoga).  I have never really been a fan of vinyasa.  But if you are, there are tons of other options out there.  Even the yoga DVDs from P90X and P90X3 are better workouts than this, and Tony Horton isn't even a yoga instructor, as far as I know.  (I also highly recommend Ana Brett and Ravi Singh kundalini yoga DVDs!)

The ballet part is also not very long.  I don't have a ton of experience with ballet-style workouts, but if that is your thing, the New York City ballet workouts (there are two volumes that I know of) and anything from the Bar Method would be more challenging and more effective.

Then there are the Live DVDs.  Eek.  These are awful.  Like modern dance classes but with a lot of silliness added in the name of ""fun.""  (On the other hand, at least you are doing the same type of exercise for long enough that you *might* feel it.)  I felt so dumb with these (not uncoordinated, I could follow the moves, but I can't think of an alternate word to use that won't get censored) that I know I will never be doing them again.  (For cardio-style dance DVDs that are more fun and less silly, try some of the Bollywood ones from Hemalayaa or belly dancing with Veena and Neena or with Rania or Cardio Dance Fusion from The Firm.)

The other thing that might be off-putting to a lot of people is the ""personality"" of the productions, for lack of a better term.  I don't doubt that the instructors are very nice people, and the sorts of people I could hang out with in real life.  They give off a very friendly vibe.  But that seeps into the instruction and it feels more like they are trying to make me giggle (or roll my eyes) than to get me in shape!  (By way of comparison, I have no doubt Shaun T. is a very nice guy, too, but he is all business when I am doing like the umpteenth burpee.)  All the time they are like ""make it FUNKY"" and I'm like ""please stop already.""  The camera work is atrocious.  There are many times when you can't actually see what the demonstrators are doing because the camera has zoomed in on someone's abdomen (when they are doing ARM movements) or on Ravi, the guy who constantly plays drums (when he is sitting on a piece of scenery in the air, 20 feet above the people doing the actual exercise).

It is a mystery to me that this is from BeachBody, the same company that produced P90X, P90X3, Focus T25, and Les Mills Combat, all of which I have done (more than once, in many cases), and Insanity, which I am working my way through now.  Any one of these other programs is excellent, challenging, and leads to real results.  I would definitely not want anyone to go thinking that just because this comes from the same company as those other programs that it is of the same quality.  No, it is a different animal entirely.

Regarding the little ball, you don't absolutely have to have the ball that they use in the DVDs.  Most any little Pilates ball will do.  Even some children's toys would probably do.  Get something like 6-8 inches in diameter that's not super squishy (air inflatable, not foam) and you should be good.  If you have a Bender Ball around somewhere, that would work.  (Goodness knows I have tried just about every gimmicky piece of exercise equipment...)

So, in the end, this is definitely NOT for the advanced exerciser.  Not even for the intermediate exerciser.  With respect to beginners, it *might* work for some people.  If you don't mind all the ""setting intentions"" stuff and the silliness, you may find these less irritating than I did.  The other thing is, if you are super new to exercise and you have trouble completing more than 10-15 minutes of the same type of exercise, this could get you started.  (Alternatively, just try Walk Away the Pounds -- or go on an actual walk -- or Tae Bo with a slower pace or Urban Rebounding, which is gentle on the knees, and look for beginner-type yoga DVDs from someone like Rodney Yee.)",1478044800,2,5604,4.337824831568816

The workouts themselves are deceptively simple. They look easy as they movements are usually slow and controlled (especially in the ballet parts) but they are really difficult if you are new to the program. These are certainly not for those brand new or returning to an exercise program. They are much too involved. They are also on the longer side, coming in at closer to the hour long mark.

I liked the idea, the settings, and the music, but the instruction quickly became annoying after the first few viewings. I tried watching it on mute but then I missed things and that was annoying.

8135889,3,B000H1RG6S,"Disc 1 (still waiting on the others):  This DVD is high on the cheese factor (are the people in the video all high?  Their ""O"" faces as they were working out was a bit much.)  Fortunately, it does give you a good workout--the weights/cardio workout was especially challenging and the ""basic"" workout was long and varied enough that you could do this DVD multiple times without getting bored.  However, it was more ""aerobics"" than yoga or dance and I don't know about the booty part other than it will give that part of your anatomy a workout.

I actually thought the bonus ""advanced"" workout was easier than the other one and more boring and monotonous.  At one point I was so bored that my ADD kicked in and I went to the fridge and started eating fudge, then I remembered I was supposed to be working out.  The second ballet workout was pretty much the same as the first.  Even the music and stoned-appearing drummer got tiresome after awhile.  The Advanced workout included some of the most terrible ""white-people"" aerobic dancing I have seen since the ""Elaine"" dance from Seinfeld.  Extra cheese!  The botox-y blonde lady of indiscernible age's started to really annoy me by this point--I couldn't stop staring at her fake-looking lips and I couldn't tell if I was just mad at her because she skinnier than me and I wanted the workout to be over or if she was just kind of annoying until she started shouting, ""Say hallelujah!"" and clapping during the workout--that cemented it.  This is one for the ""rent, don't buy"" column.
