6094495,5,B00GO55Q72,"A very large view of emotions and consequences we could at any point in life be facing.  Seize the moment while you can, for there may not be a tomorrow.  Change in life is inevitable, you cannot run from it, but you can choose the direction.  This movie goes down in my notes as one of the best chick flicks I have seen in a while.  Slow to start, and then by complete surprise a veil is lifted and clarity enters through the gaps in the walls we call life.",1405555200,16,458,4.055555555555555
6094496,4,B00GO55Q72,It was a really good movie.  Just one curse word in it.  I didn't agree with it having a curse word in it and some other things in it but I can't tell because I don't want to give away the story.  No sexual content.  it's an okay movie for young adults and older adults.,1404864000,,270,3.8545454545454545
6094497,1,B00GO55Q72,"The acting is bad. The dialogue is bad. The music is bad. The pace is too slow. With so much drama, four damsels in distress, I should have felt something but I didn't. I only saw four unconvincing cliches that bored me. At times they were embarrassing to watch. I hung in there but ended up quitting with less than ten minutes to go. I didn't expect there'd be anything to see.
I don't recommend this movie, not even free with Amazon Prime. Waste of time.",1404518400,7,456,4.313953488372093
6094498,4,B00GO55Q72,"This was a surprising little find.  The acting and dialog are uneven (to put it gently) and the characters are not really deep, but the different intertwined stories are touching and the message is a good one.  I would not recommend it for a movie night, but as a little something to watch while doing other things, this one worked for me.  (Just to be clear, the acting and dialog could seriously bother you if you aren't prepared for it to be weak. I definitely had moments when I considered shutting it off, so only watch if you are prepared for some pretty sub-standard performances.)",1404086400,12,588,4.580952380952381
6094499,5,B00GO55Q72,A very inspiring story that makes one think about their own life and the situations we are currently facing. One line that C.Thomas Howell says is very powerful!,1402790400,5,161,4.785714285714286
6094500,3,B00GO55Q72,"The story was about several women in what I would describe a life crisis. One woman was dying of cancer, one was a young troubled woman who found out she was pregnant, another in a unsatisfying relationship and finally and actress who was trying to figure out her life.

The story was a little difficult at first to get into but eventually you could see how the lives the people were just a bit connected.  The movie had many sad points and it was clear that this movie was more about finding people's voice rather than the relationships.  The difficulty for me was that the characters were a little shallow for the crisis they were going through. I felt I wanted a little more depth to understand the characters but since the main emphasis was on where they were going it made some of the situations seem less pivotal.  There is quite a bit of death in this movie which made me cry several times. I also kept thinking that the casting just didn't seem to fit that well, enough that throughout the movie at several points I had a hard time believing that several of the characters would be involved in the relationships or situations in the storyline. The best part of the whole movie to me is the piece of wisdom given by the man in the beginning and written on the book shown at the end of the movie.",1398211200,,1302,4.367768595041323

6094607,4,B00GO55Q72,"People normally watch t.v. and movies in order to escape from reality especially movies with plots that one must hold a willful suspension of disbelief so that you can totally submerge yourself in drama that is far from your own.  This movie is more about real life situations with a heavier plot that could be anyone's story.  You will not find a sunny outcome as in life the guy does not always get the girl and life will eventually give way to death.  However, the point of the movie as its most memorable tag line suggests is to make the most of the opportunities you have today.  ""The thing about regret is that it either has you living in the past or in the future where either place you have no power.  That is why if you want to do something, accomplish something you should take steps toward it today in the here and now or life will pass you by.""  This is actually a very powerful message to take home with you and let marinate in your mind for how many things do we put off because of past hurts or put off with the idea that tomorrow is another day.  The thing is that we not promised a tomorrow and if we do get to see the dawn of a new day it is meant as a gift what you do with that gift well, is up to you.",1436140800,5,1222,4.045643153526971

6094631,4,B00GO55Q72,"""Don't Pass Me By"" (Director:Eric Priestley. Writers: Katy Kvalvik, Rachel Noll)  The second time I watched this movie it was on a 32 inch HD computer monitor. I observed the color, the lighting,the actions used to bring the characters alive and believable. The cinematography and acting were excellent. Hannah (Rachael Knoll) has terminal cancer;Danielle(Katy Kvalvik) is a movie star whose success is devouring relations with friends and family;Jill(Nancy Karr),married to an ""all me"" idiot, who blocks her own ambitions of becoming a ballet dancer; and teen Brooke(Elizabeth Izzo), who gets pregnant by her drug dealer/friend. This is a movie about life,about choices that may entrap us,but if there's a key, open the door. That's what these characters did. They turned the key. The writing is cohesive. You won't have trouble following the storyline. As their first Indie,I look forward to future works by Ms. Noll and Ms. Kvalvik.",1422921600,12,935,5.3175675675675675

This is how it's done, Hollywood, and I appreciate this movie so much for departing from Hollywood's norm - that of the overproduced, seizure-inducing, thinly acted offerings in film today.

I would have enjoyed this more if each character's speech and actions had been more distinctive. Each of the main characters has someone in their life who takes and takes and never gives back and the movie never reveals anything to show why the main character keeps putting up with it.
