8180161,4,B000NOK20G,Purchased this DVD for my husband - and he thoroughly enjoyed the retelling and story sharing of Delbert McClinton and his fellow musicians over the years.  It's a 'reality' type taping - and one I think will be watched and re-watched !,1390262400,,236,4.619047619047619
8180162,5,B000NOK20G,"I don't write many reviews, but not enough people have given Delbert the respect he should have in this business.  This is a great video and I didn't have any sound problems as mentioned in another review.  This is a delightful combination of music and conversation - just like I would expect if I was on one of Delbert's cruises.  This has helped me discover some artists I had not known before, so if you like a good time and can't get to see Delbert and friends live, this is a good alternative.  If your feet don't move to the music, you must be DEAD!",1235174400,6,555,4.257142857142857
8180163,3,B000NOK20G,"I have been a Delbert McClinton fan for over 25 years. Having seen him live twice and if not mistaken I have all of his CD's and early cassettes.  I love his various stlyes of music, especially the way he intrepets the lyrics.

I thought the interviews on this DVD were great.

My complaint is that I didn't like the sound mix for most of the musical performances.  I thought I was having trouble with my surround sound system until I put in another music DVD.  During the Clay McClinton interview his voice was so low it could barely be heard.  It's like no one did a final quality control on the sound mix prior to releasing this  DVD.

I expected much better sound quality for this product.",1231459200,4,693,4.359375
8180164,5,B000NOK20G,"I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEW THAT THIS IS SOME AWESOME ENTERTAINMENT. ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS DVD IS THE TALENT ASSEMBLED. ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS PAUL THORN. HE HAS A LIVE DVD OUT AND IT'S GREAT MUSIC.CHECK IT OUT. I WISH JIMMY HALL WOULD DO A LIVE DVD AS WELL. DON'T WAIT, BUY THIS DVD TODAY.................",1223078400,7,320,4.35
8180165,5,B000NOK20G,"Short of being there,this film offers viewers an exceptional look at one of America's musical treasures and best kept secrets, Delbert Mclinton, who's been wowing audiences around the world with his own unique blend of blues,rock,country and blue eyed soul since the late fifties. Fifty years and three Grammys later, fronting the tightest band in the business in venues large and small, there is no doubt he leaves fans both exhilarated and exhausted, wanting more. I cannot strees enough, this movie is about the music,not the cruise. If you are looking for a travelouge,look elsewhere. If you are looking for three hours of some of the best musical performances available on land or sea from Delbert and his like minded musical cronies,all at the top of their game, buy this film. Producer/Director Jay Curlee's labor of love,expertly crafted visually,and,presented in Dolby 5.1 surround sound and DTS deserves to be played loud and often. Do yourself the favor. You won't be sorry.",1216944000,16,985,5.124223602484472
