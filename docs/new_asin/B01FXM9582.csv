7752139,1,B01FXM9582,"By far one of the worst animes I've ever seen. I would never recommend this to anyone because of 3 main reasons.
1.) The story so bland and generic you already know how the story will play out by the 2nd episode.
2.) The characters are all so bland and plain the girls aren't even cute!
3.) The ending like the hole story is grabage.
Just warning all you harem fans this series is literally trash. Watch Highschool DxD or something.",1472083200,2,432,4.345679012345679
7752140,1,B01FXM9582,"Prior to this debuting, the source material was described a as a paint by numbers harem series. Paint by numbers usually turns out better than this.

It's more like someone read about harem tropes on allthetropes, and made a series without watching one. The setting and plot are a complete mess. Absolute Duo in universe is apparently some bs combat Bodhisattva pairing. Which you can also achieve without a partner and following a lobotomy. Or something. It makes even less sense than most of the character's actions throughout the series.

Probably didn't help that it ran in just about the only season where there actually were 5 harem series on at the same time, and this one was bringing up the rear the entire time.

On the plus side, the OP and ED are cool. The art looks good, if not terribly original.",1468972800,2,810,4.65034965034965
7752141,4,B01FXM9582,"The anime is not without its problems, it does have a feel of been there, done that with animation that can be hit or miss. Yet even with these issues and for its short length, and taken in isolation as almost every anime based on a light novel series must be, it has an interesting take on a vaguely familiar story that has been told many times before, girl and boy with superpowers team up as only they can to do good and be the guardians of peace.

There is also something so very innocent in how Absolute Duo does everything with a story that feels so familiar, that at least to me, Absolute Duo is a guilty pleasure type of anime worth more attention and praise then it has so far been given by many viewers.",1468368000,9,713,4.204379562043796
7752142,2,B01FXM9582,"I found this to be very bland and unoriginal compared with other anime (Infinite Stratos, High School DxD, Fairy Tail, Linebarrels of Iron, etc). The animation as well as the story was unremarkable, except what the heck was up with the eyes!?!",1467676800,4,243,4.809523809523809
7752143,2,B01FXM9582,"I really wanted to like this anime but I just couldn't. It starts out pretty good and you think it going to be a decent anime but then the story just falls apart. I would definitely recommend not wasting money on this anime, if your curious about it watch it online first and more than the first couple episodes then decide for yourself.",1466812800,,337,4.365079365079365
7752144,5,B01FXM9582,Saw it  on Youtube. I like the story. it could be little better and it could be longer. Artwork and voice actor was good.,1465603200,,121,4.041666666666667
7752145,5,B01FXM9582,Yes a must watch,1465257600,5,16,3.25
7752146,4,B01FXM9582,"This anime does seem a bit generic but I find that it has more likable characters than a lot of other shows. The animation isn't anything special, but for most episodes it's serviceable. The music is fantastic and though the main character does seem a lot like the generic dude, but he actually does have a goal unlike some other protagonists. He also is somewhat affected by his past. The anime also has a lot inappropriate humor, but I personally enjoyed it. The story did have a few problems near the end, and I'd personally say I want there to be a season 2. I say at the very least you should try it.",1464825600,14,605,4.315789473684211
7752147,1,B01FXM9582,had a cool first episode and great opening soundtrack but the series just falls apart after that espcially with its main character. there are better anime series to buy a 100 times better than this one i suggest waiting on yuri kuma arashi or even wait for prison school to finally come out eventually,1464652800,,301,4.592592592592593
