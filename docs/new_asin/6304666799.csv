931659,1,6304666799,"After seeing Bourne's NYC performance a number of years ago I knew I needed this DVD for my collection.  I read the reviews and learned that the earlier version came with a fat booklet, which I wanted.  The later version lacked that detail, reportedly.  It was shipped promptly, but I was unable to find time to view it for maybe six weeks and by that time the shipping papers had been recycled.  The version I was sent is intended to be played in ""Western Europe, Japan, and South Africa"".  Not Maine, USA.  I can play it on my laptop, but not my home theatre.  My advice?  Go ahead and order this, but don't wait to see if it is playable on your equipment.  Try it right away.  I shall order another version, but there's no way I can play this copy.  I know it didn't come FROM Amazon, but it did come VIA Amazon.",1305504000,2,815,4.2272727272727275
931660,1,6304666799,"A big dissappointment: I expected powerful male dancing as for example Jorge Don delivered in Maurice Bejar's choreography of a Swan solo in the 70's- but instead the male corp dances like Dude's neighbor in the ""Big Lebowski"". Thuddy hairy amateurs costumed in lamb skin.  Riding pants hopping about doing hump backed arabesques. The Prince is a jazz dancer doing ballet steps.
The women involved in the court scenes are real ballet soloists and the only honest dancing in the production. Without the strong hype and art-political support this production received on opening this ""Mutton Lake"" would have been dismissed out of hand as tacky twaddle.",1293408000,3,650,5.132075471698113
931661,5,6304666799,This is one of my favorite ballets and I would suggest it to anyone with an appreciation for ballet and a passion for true art. Speedy delivery and great quality DVD. Check it out if you haven't seen it!,1288051200,,203,4.230769230769231
931662,5,6304666799,"Even if you have never been able to sit through a complete ballet, this production of Bourne's version of Swam Lake will hold you to the end.  The cast is superb.  Especially of note is Adam Cooper whose raw masculinity creates a truly memorable swan.  Bourne adds enough humor to let us know he is laughing with us all at life's imperfections and at those who cannot help seeing a gay in every closet. His interpretation of the movements of water birds is genius; his story moving. And the music is Tchaikovsky; what else could you possibly want.",1248566400,,547,4.561224489795919
931663,5,6304666799,"To be perfectly honest I'm not a huge fan of ballet, nor do I have a great deal of experience where ballet is concerned. Nevertheless, I have never been more transfixed or entranced by a work of performance art than by Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake. It's truly provocative on so many levels. Every time I watch I get lost in the beautiful music, choreography, and above all the acting. The Prince's despair at the emotional and often physical distance of the people around him; his sheer, unabashed joy at finding that depth of love and acceptance in the Swan; and the tragic frenzy that is the story's end really make this a great thematic piece. Your eyes can't help but follow Adam Cooper's every movement, whether he's portraying the graceful majesty of a swan or the seductive villainy of the character's dual opposite. And the ending--simply breathtaking. At this point, it would be rather difficult for me to go back and watch a traditional version of the ballet, because I'd probably spend the entire time waiting for men in feathered knee-length trousers to appear :) I recommend to anyone who loves a bittersweet tale and dancing that does it justice! Beautiful!",1248480000,2,1169,4.82089552238806
931664,4,6304666799,"Act II where the prince meets the Swans is the highlight of the entire production. The story is about the prince of course, who is so wretched that he was entranced by the Swan King. But then, who wouldn't be, as danced by the magnificent Adam Cooper? Unbelievably agile, graceful, with arms truly the span of wings, he glides and floats and utterly seduces anyone who watches. The Swan was a reason for the prince to live, but the black swan was the reason for his downfall. The black swan was also danced by Cooper, with a sadistic, dangerous roguish energy, completely different from his role as the swan.
Skip all other parts except the ones with Adam Cooper in it. The Royal court scenes, like all British Royal related matter, are an utter bore.",1228867200,4,751,4.57037037037037

931832,5,6304666799,I found the DVD of Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake excellent material and I have some friends queuing up to borrow the DVD. It arrived on time as promised by Amazon and the DVD was well worth the cost and the wait.,1179619200,2,209,4.121951219512195
931833,4,6304666799,"Bourne's swan lake is an interesting twist on the traditional version. The choreography (especially for the swans) is very modern. Theatrical choreography is used throughout the show, which does have many good moments...but I can't say that I'm an overall fan of Bourne's choreography in this show. His Nuctracker is simply amazing though! When I saw Swan Lake live, I had the same feelings about it as I do about the video, but the ""live"" aspect at least allowed me to watch what ever I wanted to watch in the seen, and just made things more exciting all the way around.",1179360000,3,571,4.663366336633663
931834,5,6304666799,"I saw the live version of this production in Brisbane (April 2007) and it was truly magical and amazing. I did notice a couple of changes since the filming of the DVD. I love that Matthew Bourne's male swans portray the strength and well-known aggression of real life swans (not always easy to watch) and thoroughly enjoyed the DVD performances. It is good to have the traditional version of Swan Lake to turn to as well though, as I believe that it is important to preserve the original classical masterpieces that have inspired generations of lovers of dance.",1179014400,4,561,4.73469387755102
931835,5,6304666799,"If you remember the movie ""Billy Elliot"", Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake will be a great follow up.  The last scene in Billy Elliot is of the Swan in this performance.

What Gilbert and Sullivan set out to do a century ago was to make opera popular with people who thought opera was above them.  Bourne's work will have same effect on Ballet.  It is truly wonderful and highly recommended.",1178928000,4,385,4.536231884057971
931836,5,6304666799,"Having seen this production both live and on TV it was a must to purchase the DVD.  There are some critical points but, in the main, the dramatic power of Matthew Bourne's chorography coupled with the performance of Adam Cooper and his corp of male swans it is a frightening depiction of what could have been if Pepita had dispensed with his tutu's and shocked the world with a production which would,I am sure, have met with Tchaikovsky's approval.  I found some of the movement a little ghose particularly the assemble work in the early scenes but the par de dur between Cooper and Scott Ambler must be seen to be believed.",1173744000,3,625,4.571428571428571
931837,1,6304666799,"I bought this recording for my 5 & 3 year-old grandchildren who love ballet. There was nothing in the Amazon literature to indicate the homosexual slant of the production. The kids and I were half-way through viewing it when I realized what was being passed off was truly counter culture. The principal women (mom & girlfriend) were evil and stupid respectively. The ""hero""s"" true love was an undisguised male swan (all the swans were male). There was no hiding the passion between the male lovers. Good grief!! [...]",1173052800,9,517,4.886363636363637
931838,5,6304666799,"Words cannot express how glad I am the Adventures in Motion Pictures company made available Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake on DVD. The clich thing to say is it's ""amazing"", ""genius"", ""sexy"", ""masterful""... but it is all those things and more. You've never see anything like this.

To me this ""modern"" Swan Lake is now the definitive classic of a classic--I can't nor do I want to imagine the swan roles as anything but manly now. The leads Adam Cooper and Scott Ambler are not only great dancers, they are great actors. Their chemistry is enjoyable to behold--and just as believable as the chemistry the traditional Swan Lake man/woman pair conveys. In fact, a male swan is more provocative *because* it's not the typical sad, delicate princess from all other versions. Instead we see something new and wonderful--a true creature of beauty, power and majesty who utterly captivates the Prince (and the audience) in every way. The male duets and solos in this show are just...wow.

I brought this DVD to my best friend's house and I was unsure what she would think, she'd never seen any ballet let alone one so un-traditional as this. My fears were put to rest in Act II. Once the Swan appeared she didn't take her eyes away the rest of the night. We both watched in silence as if mesmerized. It was a fantasitc feeling to watch it with someone else and see them be amazed. The music helped too, Swan Lake has by far some of the best music ever written for the stage. Surely many people who aren't normally ballet watchers would appreciate this show--its humor, universal themes of forbidden love, the unique way the swans look and act like real birds, and above all else powerful manly dancing--definitely something for everyone! Share this with someone you love, quick!!!",1172102400,10,1768,4.755700325732899
931839,5,6304666799,"This is such an amazing new take on Swan Lake, a must see.  Matthew Bourne's choreography is exciting and thrilling.  A fresh modern remake of the classic Swan Lake with a male cast.  Adam Cooper is hypnotic, and beautiful.  Words can't explain how much I enjoyed this ballet.",1170115200,4,276,4.6875
931840,4,6304666799,Matthew Bourne's rendition of swan lake was wonderful.  The movement of the swans was wonderfully birdlake yet still very graceful.,1169856000,,131,5.55
931841,5,6304666799,"I bought this based on reading reviews of it on Amazon and elsewhere.  It was a curiosity item, and I am very familiar with the original traditional interpretation.

It seemed to start out rather slow, and in fact I almost decided to put it off altogether.  However, the more I watch it, the more it draws you in.  It has a very different feel and intensity missing from the traditional versions.  This is not a fluff piece.

By the time it was over, it had actually moved me emotionally more than I had expected.

I am impressed enough to have subsequently purchased two more copies for people I love.",1168300800,3,602,4.467889908256881
931990,5,6304666799,"I saw Swan Lake my first time at City Center in New York, the Balanchine production of the 1950s.  I was awed, captivated, swept away.  I was about 6 years old.  I've seen many productions since, and they've often felt like museum pieces, stiff and starchy despite the best dancing. They haven't felt new or vital. This production left me gaping in wonder, even though the choreography wasn't always brilliant.  In fact, it was sometimes awkward and jarring, and that's a good thing. The music, the dazzling, shimmering, lustrous music, stood out in all its genius because the dancing made you listen as opposed to tapping your fingers one-two-three one-two-three.  There's nothing automatic or received here.

Then there's the dark psychological story line of repression battling psychic freedom, a story that doesn't always have a happy ending despite American expectations. I loved the male swans, especially Adam Cooper who was sensuous, powerful, hypnotic.  Have you ever been chased by a swan?  They are huge beasts, not merely lovely gliding figures on a lake or river.  This production captures them in all their danger and even ferocity, while offering a 50s version of a royal family too much in the public's eye.  This may not be the tidiest Swan Lake I've ever seen, but it's the most alive.

Terrific sets and costumes rounded out performance and an interpretation that left me tearful and stunned.  This is no war horse, it's a race horse.  And one more delightful note.  People here have complained about the cameras not always focusing on the dancing, the feet--but what that does is replicate one's experience in the balcony with opera glasses, watching feet, faces, hands, shifting to try to take it all in.",1132185600,15,1725,4.965156794425087
931991,3,6304666799,"After an initial viewing, I sat down and wrote a review for this and gave it five stars. It was a fascinating new look at an old warhorse of the ballet repertoire, the sound was beautiful, the acting ability of the dancers impressive. But for some reason I didn't submit that review, and now, several months and several viewings later, I find that I no longer agree with it.

I should hasten to write that I still think the acting is very good, the music is still beautifully performed, and this is still a fascinating new interpretation of an old warhorse. But I find this version to be sort of like a flashy and abrasive new friend, and it turns out I'd prefer to spend time with my old warhorse of a friend. This performance impresses, but it just doesn't wear well.

By now you're well aware of the plot of Bourne's reimagined Swan Lake. Young prince has overbearing and emotionally distant (but sexually vibrant) mother, the Queen. The Queen has a manipulative and ambitious secretary who sets the young prince up with a woman who will help kick the weak foundations out from under his shaky emotional equilibrium, resulting in a near breakdown for the prince. Enter the swans, who offer him a taste of freedom. Alas, that taste isn't enough to shore up his emotional edifice for long, and the secretary's son (the same dancer as the principal swan) arrives on the scene to help bring that edifice crashing down. The principal swan arrives at the end to try to save him, but the other swans are no more accepting of swan-human relations than are humans.

This is all very interesting material, and the dancers are all very good at presenting it. Especially fine are the Queen (beautiful, icy, and passionate) and the swan (handsom, aggressive, tender, and dangerous). The swans are male, and they're danced with the aggressive grace of the real birds (real swans, if you've never gotten up close enough to interact with them, are mean and scary birds).

So what's wrong with this production? First and foremost, there's not really very much dancing in it. It's more like a pantomime theatre production with musical accompaniment. As other reviewers have noted, Bourne's choreography is really very basic. If that doesn't bother you, add another star, but I'm traditional enough to want some serious dancing in my ballet. Second, the camera angles tend to demphasize what dancing there is. They emphasize the theatrical elements over the dance. Again, if that's what pleases you then you should read another half star into my review. It pleased me at first, but no longer.

I think this is a performance worth watching. I just don't think it's one that bears up well to repeated viewings. It starts to seem a little more flashy and a little less substantial than it did at first. I like to see something new and flashy come along to shake up our perceptions and our prejudices, and Bourne's staging does a good job of that, but there's something to be said for old warhorses. After watching this DVD I can watch a more traditional version with new appreciation, and I'll undoubtedly pull this one out from time to time.",1131926400,12,3123,4.722935779816514
931992,5,6304666799,"I'm not usually a ballet person.  I haven't seen anything since ""The Nutcracker"" when I was six.  But this was absolutely brilliant.  The concept for it is completely bold and original and Adam Cooper as The Swan blew me away.  How can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop?  Tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this, but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet.",1127692800,10,425,4.5394736842105265

931995,1,6304666799,"Please, save yourself the money and bother.  This is a very misguided production.  I can only blame myself because I didn't read the description carefully.  It appears that Mr(?)Bourne is hoping to normalize some abnormal behavior by blaming it on abnormal behavior, which he must consider normal. Follow that? Is this an autobiographical piece?  If my only gripe were the ridiculous content I would keep quiet, assuming that maybe I'm just a prude.  But fluffy pantaloons on sweaty bare-chested BIRDS!  Oh, please.  And the choreography looked like a lame effort at West Side Story meets Swan Lake.  My adult children and I sat and laughed until we cried--skipping ahead when we were completely disgusted, of course.  Stick to playing gigs at pubs, Mr. Bourne.  I ordered another version.",1120521600,5,789,5.09375
931996,5,6304666799,"Radical and wonderful and exquisite!  A totally different take on the classic ballet in a powerful homoerotic dream world of powerful male swans, mother as madonna/whore, forbidden desire, lust and irresistable force.  Left me breathless.",1120176000,7,238,5.771428571428571
931997,5,6304666799,"As a hard-core classical ballet fan, I didn't know what to expect out of this ""modernized-yet-it-isn-'t-quite-ballet"" performance.  I got the first glimpse of Adam Cooper -- who danced the lead role of the male Odette/Odile in this performance -- in ""Billy Elliott"" (where Cooper made a cameo role as the adult Billy).  Naturally I was curious and wanted to see more, so I got this DVD. Wow -- I am very impressed.  Adam Cooper's performance is ASTOUNDING. He, and him alone, is reason enough for me to watch the performance.  I wish I could say the same for the rest of the cast -- they were pretty good, but none had the charm and stage presence of Cooper. But that's why he has the lead role, right?  This is one performance where I can watch over and over again.",1112313600,11,766,4.482014388489208
931998,1,6304666799,"Oh my goodness, I was so glad I did not buy this!! I have always been enchanted by Swan lake and have seen the ""original"" ballet.  I was moved to search out this version because of the movie ""Billy Elliot"".  At the end of that movie we catch a glimpse of the adult Billy, played by the lead swan, Cooper. I was almost tempted to buy the DVD sight unseen based on the reviews, but decided at the last minute to rent it first. I was so bored, it was unbelievable.  I am pretty open minded, but i thought this was really cheesy. The choreography most of the time was bad, and I found myself fast forwarding through to see some actual dancing, not filler.  The story did not grip me and the music was awful.  What makes Swan Lake so hauntingly memorable, is the music's correlation with the dancing.  With Bourne's version, I felt that the music was almost wasted.  At times when it was cresting, the Prince was sulking in the dark.  Anyway, judge for yourself, but I caution...do as I did...rent from Netflix first before you buy!",1111190400,8,1027,4.368421052631579
931999,5,6304666799,"If the usual ballet corps in productions of 'Swan Lake' are about the poise and gracefulness of a swan's movement, then this version is certainly about the virility, strength, and - to be honest - obnoxiousness of wild birds (this is coming straight from someone who's been attacked by ducks while throwing crumbs!).  I am in full agreement with Matthew Bourne when he says that swans can be a very masculine and aggressive animal.  This corps portrayed it quite well, especially toward the last two scenes.

Adam Cooper makes a magnificient Swan and a dangerous, sexy Stranger.  The ball scene reeks of virtuousity and should have been a debilating dance.  Instead, he smokes at multiple points while the scene is still going on!  Quite impressive.

While watching the Prince, I felt a dreadful sense of loneliness, explaining his wretched behavior.  Unloved by his mother, forcing an unexpected and emotionally-laden pas de deux, used by his courtiers and abused by a tramp...poor man, small wonder he would be enchanted with visions of a Swan!

If you get hung up on the fact that two men are dancing the pas de deux, you're missing the point.  It's not unreasonable to assume that the Prince is gay, and you'd be hard pressed to miss how affectionate the Prince/Swan interactions are, or even the brutal sexuality of the Prince/Stranger scenes.  But the ballet is more, much more, about the power of 'touch', and how big a role affection can, and should, play in one's life.  For my money, that's far more entertaining - and accessible - than the concept of princesses under enchantment.

I recommend this version to anyone - especially those who are burning out on the traditional Swan Lake.",1108857600,6,1696,4.867595818815331
932173,5,6304666799,"There were so many reviews of this version of Swan Lake that I had to really make a bold decision when purchasing this item.

The music is not good.  Be warned.  Something to do with the actual recording I suspect because on my system at least, the orchestra sounded like it was playing in a cardboard box at the back of the room.  No amount of adjustment seemed to help, apart from winding up the treble to gain brilliance and winding up the subwoofer to gain presence.  But the poor quality of the music was soon forgotten as the performance moved along, then brought back as the audience applauded from thier coffee can - somewhere near the orchestra.

I don't particularly like ballet - nor do I dislike it.  But I love a story with substance and I love new versions of old works which provoke thought.  And this version of Swan Lake certainly does that.  It could have been 10 minutes shorter, but then opinions such as that tend to be subjective.

The performance was iniitially a little heavy handed/footed.  The prince almost seemed to be having problems dancing in the boots provided for him.  He seemed flat footed and a little clumsy.  But this too seemed to come right as the performance warmed up.  And there was the obvious problem of seeing all those male swans when you have been used to the normal cast of female swans. I guess it was more of a change than I expected to see - the normal graceful performance translated into virile stregth.  But it worked for me. The makeup was well thought out and so were the costumes.  Both worked superbly.

The story is strong - the undertones of two societies unable to forgive that ""something different"" about thier leaders.  The tenderness, passion and strength are all there - in abundance. It is a tear-jerker for those of us who are tender hearted. The performance was sensual and provocative.

Will you like it?  Who knows?  I am not privy to your likes and dislikes - I am only giving an opinion.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I suspect it is something I will tend to watch alone rather than share with friends.  It will probably end up being one of those discs I will play infrequently on a rainy Sunday afternoon.  But having said that, my collection of nearly 1000 discs is made up entirely of discs which I play infrequently and many I have never played at all.

My suggestion - try it.  If you don't like it you can give it as a birthday present, albeit with some though as to who you give it to.",1094428800,9,2465,4.446428571428571
932174,3,6304666799,"This is a very new twist on a very traditional ballet.  It is very well done in most regards except for one thing: the choreography by Matthew Bourne is disappointingly insipid and not up to modern standards.  It is a pity to have some of the best dancers in the world and a good concept and waste it on inferior choreography.

  The music is, of course, some of the best thematic music written, but it was prerecorded for the performance and suffers from lack of presence.

  If you must have something different in a 'Swan Lake"" and you want a meager sample of Adam Cooper, this will do.",1093392000,4,589,4.388888888888889
932175,1,6304666799,"In my time I have seen hundreds of performances of Swan Lake by many different companies. Bourne's version is by far the worst rendition of Swan Lake I have ever seen. It is a perverted parody and any resemblance to Swan Lake is purely coincidental. It must be shocking to any true lovers of ballet.
Unlike performances by the Royal Ballet or the Bolshoi or Kirov which fit the music like a glove, the music in this ballet is only incidental. There is no grace or precision in this performance. Just a bunch of unsynchronized apes prancing and at times just stumbling around. The filming is a disaster. The camera does not stay focused on the ""dancing."" Perhaps that is because the ""dancing"" is so bad that Bourne wants to divert the viewers attention away from it..
People have a good taste in music and particularly in ballet should avoid watching this sickening and disgusting version. I wish I had.",1079222400,9,902,4.64375
932176,4,6304666799,"Matthew Bourne transformed this beloved antique of a ballet into a parable for our times. Set in the early 1960's (I think; judging from the costumes, anyway) it follows a little prince as he grows up surrounded by the paparrazzi and discovers his own sexuality in the form of a swan prince. Just the fact that Swan Lake was given an involving storyline is a vast improvement over previous versions, but the complex themes of the prince's homosexuality, his relationship with his mother, his failed relationship with a ""bad"" girl, and the constant presence of the media add multiple dimensions to what was once a loosely structure story. The costumes, the sets, and choreography are all amazing--the DVD gives a scene-by-scene synopsis of the new version, but it really isn't necessary because of the creative use of pantomime and focus on the dancers' expressions tells the story for itself. And although it does contains more false endings than the third Lord of the Rings movie, it is definitely worth watching. It is certainly not your grandmother's Swan Lake, but this is surely for the better.",1075939200,7,1099,4.945945945945946
932177,5,6304666799,"Swan Lake is one of the most representative pieces of the ballet. With wonderful music by Tchaikovsky and a good story it is one of the great pieces of ballet in the IX century.
In this new version of Swan Lake Matthew Brooke gives it a few new touches,the main one is off course the fact that the swan are males. This is, in my opinion, a refreshing touch to a classical with one of the best dancers of ballet in the UK,that is Adam Cooper, the great performance by Scott Ambler and one of the best choreographies I've ever had the fortune to see.
The other cast is also great, Fiona Chadwick is not a bad dancer at all, Emily Piercy play the girlfriend very well and gives an amazing turn to the story later on. Barry Atkinson fit perfectly for the part of the cynical old man and the company of swans give a touch of humanity to the swans, making them not just a decoration.
In this production there's also the change of time,as the story is now presented in a modern era and not in an old time with carriages, crossbows and old-fashioned castles. This is also a good change, its a touch of delicacy in the way of making this  a sort of ""fairy tale"" in a modern time,in a modern city,among the ""jungle of metal"".
So what I'm trying to say is don't be a fool, master works like this are not produced in every generation, and the chance to see Odette/Odile perfom 32 fouetts,I bet Cooper is still cursing Pierina Legnani, is not seen everyday.
So buy it,you won't regret it.",1068595200,3,1475,4.305755395683454
932178,5,6304666799,"At first I was skeptical about watching this DVD, but once I saw the first act I was glued to the screen. First of all, you get a feeling that there's a real story being told, not just a bunch of dancers hop, skip, and jumping around. You grasp emotions behind concepts otherwise buried in a lot of pirouettes and whathaveyous, not that the original is bad, I'm a fan of Swan Lake, but this version knocked my socks off. The fact that the swans are men fits entirely; swans are proud creatures with power and strength behind their elegance, and this is shown very well in the choreography, not frail sickly creatures. The themes appeal simply because many people can relate to them, rather than the classics which very few people in this day and age can learn to appreciate. But even fans of the classic can find something worth watching in this production, be it the innovative style, story-line, or the 40's-50's theme.",1060387200,6,921,4.587878787878788
932179,1,6304666799,"This is one of the best shows I ever seen and meanwhile the worst of all!!!
Matthew Bourne&iexcl;s choreography is daring and marvelous. Adam Cooper is simply irresistible. What a super star!
One man just ruined everything - the edit and director of this movie C Peter Mumford.
This man obviously knows nothing about ballet. Half of the times, you can&iexcl;t see the dancers&iexcl; legs. The director seemed more interested in focusing on their facial expressions! He missed the white swan&iexcl;s first entrance just for the prince&iexcl;s thoughtful eyes. He used several cameras for the shooting and enjoyed switching from one to another every 3-6 seconds! So, everything was broken into thousands of pieces. There&iexcl;s nothing to enjoy at all.
Actually I think this director was obsessed. Every time when there was a body contact between two dancers, he zoomed in to their faces, then again you missed everything. Should he go see the shrink?!
The other strange thing is that the show was performed on an awkwardly small stage. So small that you keep wondering how the dancers managed to avoid kicking each other. Why?
The only good part didn&iexcl;t affected by this man was the music. It&iexcl;s great.
The end of the show was so moving that even with this director&iexcl;s distraction it&iexcl;s still that great. But you will not cry for it. You cry for Matthew Bourne and Adam Cooper and you pray for someone else to shoot it again. How about Alexandre Tarta? That director knows how to make a ballet movie.",1059091200,36,1520,4.94140625

Few productions, with the exception of the act 1 pas de trois, the second act, and the Black Swan pas de deux, use the original choreography.  However, there has never been such a vulgar, tasteless prodcution as this.  Not only is the score and libretto butchered into a pretentious quasi-homoerotic, quasi-Oedipal fantasia but the choreography is boring, ugly, and cold.  Anyone who loves Swan Lake (or just good art period) should steer clear of this monstrosity.  Frankly, I can't possibly think of enough bad things to say about it.",1034812800,11,593,4.89
932324,5,6304666799,"This production is artistically brilliant and imaginative. I was inspired to see this production after seeing ""Billy Elliot"" and being held spellbound with Adam Cooper's brief appearance. The choreography manages to capture the breathtaking beauty, grace and contained ferocity of male swans. In spite of reading other reviews, the ""gay"" aspect of this production never presented itself to me. The subtle symbolism of a lost soul seeking his own identity and yearning for freedom was clear. While the symbolism may have been subtle, the animal magnetism and masculine power of the all male ""corps de ballet"" was not. All I can say is WOW!!! I'll never think of Swan Lake the same way. If you were looking for something truly innovative, and thought ballet was for ""wusses""...think again.  Bravo, Matthew Bourne...and as for Adam Cooper...there are no words!!!",1016928000,12,859,5.22463768115942
932325,3,6304666799,"Firstly, although the technical side - the camerawork, editing and sound - are excellent, this isn't Swan Lake.  It might have a relation to Swan Lake just as West Side Story has to Romeo and Juliet, but why call it Swan Lake when it isn't?  Secondly, evidently through lack of research on my part, I bought it not realising it was a gay adaptation.  That in itself is no problem - however, I found the dancing to be less sensuous than one might expect of males in modern dance (e.g, Alvin Ailey, Merce Cunningham (in particular, 'Pond Life', 'Biped' and of course, Points in Space) and the Royal Danish Ballet with works like Firebird (Stravinsky).
To that extent it was a disappointment.  There were moments when I was reduced to near laughter, particularly around the Dance of the little swans (or whatever it is in this adaptation) which echoed Monty Python in my view.  If one is to have little male swans, surely they can be LITTLE.  One should not expect full-sized males to carry off the delicacy and airy lightness of young female ballerinas.
In short, a nice try and no doubt inspirational and appealing to those not already immersed in modern dance.",1016496000,8,1160,4.661764705882353
932326,4,6304666799,"this is a great production of Swan Lake! the reason that attracts your attention is the fact that the story line has been changed (from the classic myth of the swan and the prince), and the fact that the swans are male swans instead of the ladies in tutus' we've been used to! the second act (where the swans dance) is a unique choreography! i honestly must say that i'm facinated! the dancers move as gently as you would expect swans to move, yet rretaining their masculinity.. Adam Cooper, in th role of the male swan, is fantastic! the only problem is the story line, and maybe acts 1,3,4 aren't as good as act 2... but still it's more than worth it to own this tape! the second act is something no one should miss!",1012176000,3,718,4.325925925925926

Its very inspirational! I know that everyone would enjoy it! It gives you a different look at a timeless classic.
In this version it shows how someone just needs to be loved, its not ""man and man"" its ""man and animal""
We see how even a royal family can have its problems! The queen (the mother) is so cold to her son the prince, but in each act she changes her characteristics, shes a great role to pay attention to. The prince has psychological problems but feels warmth when he finds his swan, later on when you come to the last act we see the swans as their wild nature, Mathew Bourne did this thing that (he meant for this) resembles the movie BIRDS. When that woman is not paying attention to the cage and all these birds keep building up in the cage, she finally turns and realizes that its too late for her now, the swan (cooper) and the prince (ambler) get into the same situation as the swans pile on to the bed and you can only guess what happens after that! It has similar vaslav nijinsky moves, like the conecting of the arms but not really touching. Very beutiful.
This is a MUST see for all! not just fellow dancers, but for anyone who felt ""alone"" at any point of their life!

932330,5,6304666799,"I was amazed when I saw this preformance in NYC and I'm so glad it has been preserved on DVD.  I'm equally impressed that the way in which it was filmed really makes you feel like you're still in the audience watching it and not just watching a music video.  Close ups and camera movements are used but I never felt like I was missing something happening off camera.  Also, audience applause, coughs and laughter can be heard throughout.  That's right, you read that correctly, laughter in a ballet.  There are many instances where comedy has been inserted into the piece and I couldn't be more delighted.  It's handeled effrotlessly by the cast and story and adds to the human connection I feel for the production.  It never feels forced.  And comedy is not the last ime you might be caught off guard durring this ballet.  There are political overtones, fantastic sets, an outrageous bar scene, and of course, the male swans.
By changing the swans to males, Mathew Bourne has infused this tale with overtones never imagined.  The swans here are very athletic and much more bird-like in their movements.  It's a daring move and one that adds many new overtones and a raw energy to the story.  It's the single most daring element in a production that's all about taking risks and trying new things.
The DVD comes with a small bookett that includes, credits, a synopsis, an interview with and biography of Mathew Bourne.  I can't imagine someone who likes dance not being completely swept away by this incredible production.  Watch it once and you'll want to see it over and over again even though it's magic will stay with you forever.",997401600,40,1634,4.687719298245614

932467,5,6304666799,"Finally, Matthew Bourne's innovative production of Tchaikovsky's SWAN LAKE is available on DVD. This is not a camp send-up of the balletic war horse,  but a modern, freshly imagined telling of a tale of enchantment, betrayal,  disenchantment, and release. What most people already know about this  production is that the swans and cygnets are performed by male dancers,  that the choreography emphasizes the aggressive rather than the graceful  movements in swans' repertoire, and that the story is heavily freighted  with Freudian implications as it shows a young prince's efforts to break  free of his mother's hold (she's part Merry Widow and part Cruella deVil).  The viewer who tries to analyze plot points too carefully is heading toward  frustration and confusion. (For those who just can't let it alone, there's  a helpful on-screen synopsis you can jump to whenever you need it.) The  best way to enjoy this production is by focusing on the choreography and  the dancing itself. Adam Cooper's nameless Swan is powerful, persistent,  and unapologetic. He could be the prince's alter ego, his embodied desires,  the id, or just about anything else you'd want to ascribe to him. He woos  son and mother with equal conviction. Besides the moments when Cooper is on  stage/screen, the choreographic hightlight of this production for me was  the dance of the cygnets (pas de quatre). This is a moment of levity in  every production of SWAN LAKE, but more so here where the mischievous  antics and curiosity of the cygnets are played for all they're worth.
The  other thing worth commenting on is the quality of the filming of this live  performance. I have usually been disappointed by ballets on  film--presentation is often static, or feet and hands get cut out of the  picture, or the camera goes in for a close-up at a point when something  significant is happening in the choreography. Given the trade-offs,  Adventures in Motion Pictures has done an excellent job of capturing all  the key choreography while creatively managing close-ups, transitions, and  montages. The colors are rich and expressive (the dance of the swans by the  lake is bathed in a haunting nocturnal blue). And best of all, the film is  completely free of the annoying halos and bizarre shimmerings that always  seem to make their way into filmed stage productions.",964828800,90,2348,5.0390625
932468,5,6304666799,"This is a filmed version of a widely-acclaimed production of Swan Lake done by London dance company Adventures in Motion Pictures, as staged in both London and New York. It was filmed at a live performance, but other than moments at the curtain calls, and during one specific scene in the ballet, where the live audience can be seen (appropriately in all cases), it could easily have been filmed in a studio. The camerawork and editing are the best I've ever seen of a live performance, coming as close as I can imagine is possible to conveying the sense of being present at the performance. The soundtrack, a slightly edited version of the full ballet score, is full-blooded, well played, and of studio quality. (It is identical to the sound on the separate audio CD release of this version of the ballet.) The packaging contains extensive liner notes, including an interview with Matthew Bourne explaining how he came to this re-visioning of a classic ballet. High marks for technical quality of this DVD.
It is fair to warn people of the content of the performance: this is *not* the traditional ballet most people would be familiar with, and does not contain the original Petipa choreography. Instead, it is a wholly new ballet, retaining the Tchaikovsky score. Bourne has abandoned the traditional ""beautiful maidens trapped in a spell by an evil magician desperate to be saved by the handsome prince"" scenario. Instead, we have an exceptionally moving depiction of a young man, a prince -- in an unidentified land, though its monarchy, class structure and mores suggest a 1930s Britain, albeit one with jazz-den waterfront dives -- who is forced to live a life for which he is ill-suited and who finds himself increasingly unhappy, until the spirit of the life he could or should have had, the one that was denied him by the fate of his birth, bursts into his consciousness in the form of a vibrantly-male swan, smashing his equilibrium. A note here: just ignore the alarmists who gasp at the fact that all the swans are male; there is a reason for them being so, and this is not a gay love story. It is a powerful depiction of a man trying to come to terms with his own true self, and it contains wit and beauty, some remarkable dancing and often breathtaking imagery. It owes a great debt to Jung and is better suited to a modern world far more oriented to psychotherapy and internal vision than to the romantics of Tchaikovsky's time.

The finale is a masterpiece of heartstring tugging and will leave  you clutching a kleenex and sobbing. Superbly directed and danced, this  show has won many awards on stage and justly so.

No longer does the male dancer stand around awkwardly waiting to do something with the ballerina or else for no apparent reason suddenly start doing leaps about the stage. Here he is a seamless part of the story. Bourne remakes each story he does and frankly I believe he generally improves it. His ballets are much more about real people and engaging stories than traditional ballets. Besides the humor what I notice and enjoy most is the constant smooth moving of every character. No one stands around waiting to do their part. They are busy all the time. The lifts always just flow from the movement in progress.
