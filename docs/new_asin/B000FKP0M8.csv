I really appreciated the  demonstrations of some of the games that were played and the rules. In general there is sparse info available on how they actually played the games back then, so this episode helps to fill the void. My only regret is that there isn't more. Perhaps one day they'll produce a Gambling Tech II and just focus on the games themselves. 5 stars may seem like a high rating, but I've looked and there is really nothing to compare it to. As far as I can tell, this is a one-of-a-kind product for the subject.",1239321600,6,648,4.445378151260504
8295009,5,B000FKP0M8,"In this episode of Wild West Tech you learn about how the gamblers tried to cheat other players and how the casinos tried to cheat their customers by using devices and tools that would give them the upper hand. You also find out what happens to you if you get caught cheating and you learn about some famous gamblers and  some famous people who liked to gamble like Wild Bill. They go into detail about the inventions they used and how they worked.

This is a good show and I wish that they sold it in a set but hey what can you do? Anyways if you're a fan of the show or the wild west then you should get this.",1181174400,5,611,4.041322314049586
