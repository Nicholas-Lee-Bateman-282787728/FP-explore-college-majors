Bravo!",1433289600,3,153,5.6521739130434785
6789234,5,B00P816A82,"Well done profile of a wise economist and man of integrity who fearlessly and objectively expresses himself regardless of the political flack that may come his way.  If our politicians don't start listening and heeding his warnings, our constitutional republic will cease to exist to the detriment of people worldwide.",1427673600,5,318,5.36
8686834,1,B00P816A82,"The minimum stars allowed is 1.  0 is what he deserves.  I wasn't impressed.  I'm not a Jesse Jackson or an Al Sharpton fan, but I would not denigrate them by calling them hustlers or pimps.  To attack African American mayors and police chiefs for the conditions of large cities is appalling.  It's amazing when we move out and up, we still manage to look down on the place we came from.  Some of the donors that funded this documentary look familiar.  That being said, it doesn't surprise me why Mr Williams share some of the views he have.",1532995200,,541,4.404040404040404
8686835,5,B00P816A82,"Buyer should be aware that this consists largely of Professor Williams' biography, rather than extended musings from his brilliant mind. Would have liked more of his philosophy included onscreen. A worthwhile purchase focusing on a grand thinker and teacher.",1531267200,,258,5.641025641025641
8686836,5,B00P816A82,"I read Dr. Williams' column every week and find his style very easy to understand.  It's a gift to break down seemingly complex issues and show that they are not all that complex after all. This documentary was a welcome insight into the life of Dr. Williams from birth to present day. I learned much about this man during this film, and highly recommend it. There is just the right amount of historical context added to each segment - perfect. I'll never forget how Dr. Williams' paints army trucks!",1525910400,,500,4.617977528089888
8686837,5,B00P816A82,"Should be a required watch for all kids in junior high , and high school . Excellent,  inspiring man.",1507593600,,101,4.315789473684211
8686838,4,B00P816A82,"Don't share all his political views by any means, but nonetheless really enjoyed this documentary and can find much admiration for the man.  I am more of a ""liberal,"" but do agree that so much legislation was ""good intentions"" (and some was even stupid from the beginning).

Just for example, I am still a believer in affirmative action, but think it shouldn't have been race based, but rather, based on socio-economics.  The analogy I love is sport-based, because if there is one thing Americans understand it is sports: You are a college track coach.  You need to replace some graduating sprinters and have one last scholarship to give.  There are two candidates.  The one (A) has a PB of 10.1 in 100m.  He is coming from a high school with a great tradition of excellence in track, with the finest coaches and facilities. Candidate A comes out the blocks near perfectly and runs with textbook form.  The other candidate (B) comes from a high school with no such success in track,  His PB is 10.25.  His form is absolutely abysmal. Who do give the scholarship to?  Candidate B, because A has already had the great coaching etc., but he is only marginally faster",1506556800,,1163,4.679802955665025

8686841,5,B00P816A82,"Fantastic.  Wonderful biographical documentary of Walter Williams.  Fun and revealing clips of him, remarks by Charles Murray, Manny & Willette Klausner, Judge Douglas Ginsberg and others.

Some great lessons from his life that are very applicable to parents and those who want to improve themselves.

Loved his discussion of minimum wage laws, welfare, civil rights, etc.

Well worth the time and modest fee.",1457308800,,409,5.428571428571429
