It is simply one of the finest TV series of all time.  It is criminal that it has been ignored by the powers that be.",1347235200,,251,4.681818181818182
7941614,5,B00005JOXY,"I just want to add my full support to those who are urging a DVD release for ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.""  This is one of the best of the classic TV comedies and deserves a box set for the many fans who want to see it.

Please release it, Fox!!",1315958400,,249,3.769230769230769
7941615,5,B00005JOXY,"As a bonafide BABY BOOMER knee deep in heart-warming nostalgia I want to say to the ""powers that be""...I consider the omission of the entire DOBIE GILLIS series from active and current availability to be AN ANTI-GENERATIONAL MALEVOLENCE...HOW DARE YOU?",1242777600,,252,5.325
7941616,5,B00005JOXY,Maybe now that Bill O'Reilly (Fox News) has called this show his all time favorite TV Comedy the resulting publicity will help this series finally get released in a DVD Boxed Set.  I can't wait to see Tuesday Weld in high def.,1242604800,,226,4.380952380952381
7941617,5,B00005JOXY,"The Many Loves Of Dobie Gilis is a unique series that broke a lot of ground.  Especially with the narative and Dobie's relationship with the audience.  It also captured and documented a point in time that wasn't exploited much, the ""intellectual beat poets"" (Beatniks)who were the beginnings of the counter culture, who became socially conciencious, and questioned the justness of the establishment, then later transformed into the Hippies.  Although Maynard, was more of a prop than a social statement as he symbolized more of a ""wannabe beatnik"".  He said he was a ""protest cat"", but didn't know what he was protesting about.  The writing and the show's format was unique and the casting was excellent!  Although the Gillis family was dysfunctional compared to the likes of Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best and Leave it to Beaver, in the end they were very close and loving.  The only low point in the series was when Dobie and Maynard enlist in the army and the characters and writing became more one dimentional during that period. This is a Great TV Classic that needs the attention of REMASTERING and EXTRAS that the DVD format can offer!  I hope who has the rights to this GEM of a TV series will do it the JUSTICE it DESERVES!!!",1211500800,,1240,4.761682242990654
7941618,5,B00005JOXY,"I can't argue with those who consider I LOVE LUCY to be the greatest sitcom ever.  However, I feel that THE MANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS is a close second, and I would love to be able to purchase the entire series on DVD.  Dwayne Hickman is still active in the business, and I bet that he would happily contribute an audio commentary or two.  The supporting cast was one of the best ever, with actors like Doris Packer, Steve Franken, William Schallert, Jean Byron, Tuesday Weld, and of course all of those gorgeous late fifties/early sixties babes (Yvonne Craig, Yvonne Lime, Lynn Loring, Anita Sands, and many other young actresses of the era who appeared as various romantic interests for Dobie).  The word on the street is that Fox would like to release it (or perhaps at least season one), but the Max Schulman estate is asking for a great deal of money.  So, the material remains unreleased, and nobody is earning any money on it at all.  Meanwhile, pressed DVDs (of vintage material) appear to be going the way of the Dodo, so I'd opine that the ""window of opportunity"" for this series is shrinking rapidly.

MAJOR 2013 UPDATE:

In January of 2013, the Shout Factory DVD label has announced the acquisition of this series for DVD!  There have been poor quality bootlegs floating around, but this will be a legit, remastered release of the entire series!",1200614400,,1358,4.648535564853557
7941619,5,B00005JOXY,"UPDATE: TVshowsondvd.com has confirmed that Shout! Factory will be releasing the complete series of Dobie sometime in 2013.  Great News!
Original Post:
I've called Fox & asked them several times to release Dobie Gillis on DVD.  If you want to see Dobie released on DVD, call Fox Customer Affairs toll-free at 1-(888)-223-2FOX.  Tell them that you'd like them to release ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"" - the Complete Series, on DVD so that you can buy it.  You might want to also remind them of the undying popularity of Bob Denver as Maynard G. Krebs.  I also suggest that you go to  [...] & vote for Dobie to be released.  Together, we can bring back Dobie, Maynard, Zelda, & company, for ourselves, & younger generations.",1176854400,,725,4.7063492063492065
7941620,4,B00005JOXY,"A great 50's show, perhaps the prototye for ""The 70's Show"" and ""Happy Days"", a series with the TV's most beautiful, golddigging goddess Thalia Menninger (Tuesday Weld), beatnik Maynard G Krebs (Bob Denver, aka Gilligan), clothes-hound Milton Armitage (Warren Beatty), dwarfish Zelda Gilroy (propinquity) and let's not forget the rich Chatsworth Osborne Jr with his watercress sandwiches (Family motto ""Never dip into Capital"").

Another member of the cast was Rodin's ""The Thinker"" statue in the park. Dobie would sit in the same attitude as the Thinker and then philosophize about his (mostly girl) problems. Maynard, the unemployed, bearded,  buddy (model for Kelso), would scream everytime the word ""Work"" was mentioned. Dobie was lusting over the untouchable Thalia, who was brought back over and over, for more laughs. She remains one of the most beautiful women ever in Hollywood, here the eternal teenager (See the cover of Matthew Sweet's classic album ""Girlfriend""). Zelda was in love with Dobie, who ignored her. She felt that if she hung around him enough he would eventually like her, (that never happened). Chatworth Osborne would show up in a polo outfit, hat, rediculous pants and mallet, looking for his string of polo ponies. Thalia liked Dobie, but he wasn't rich enough for her and she was repulsed by Chatsworth but attracted by his money.

Series created by Max Shulman (who wrote ""Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys"" with Paul Newman). Archie? The DG series was edgier and funnier than Archie, I think. There are over 120 episodes out there in limbo, this was a popular series for years.

Let's hope this version is better than the one previously available. New Review to follow.",1175644800,,1695,5.108303249097473
7941621,5,B00005JOXY,"When you look at some of the t.v. shows, old and new, that get DVD releases, it seems a crime that this brilliant sitcom has largely been ignored.  For the uninitiated, DOBIE GILLIS followed the unlucky-in-love title character (Dwayne Hickman)  through four seasons of comic misadventures from 1959-1963.  Dobie and his beatnik buddy Maynard G. Krebbs (a pre-Gilligan Bob Denver) led a cast of zany characters.  There was Frank Faylen as Dobie's long-suffering father (""I gotta kill that boy...I just gotta""), Sheila James as his unwanted pursuer Zelda Gilroy. . .plus early roles for Tuesday Weld (as Dobie's ultimate fantasy, the unattainable Thalia Menninger) and Warren Beatty.

DOBIE's premise and its characters have been likened to the popular Archie comic books. . .and that's probably a valid analogy.  While Maynard's interests lay primarily in listening to jazz and avoiding work, Dobie was steadfast in his pursuit of the elusive ""perfect girl.""  He was a dreamer who was given to poetic gestures and philosophic observations on the nature of the opposite sex.  These weren't just acted out, however.  At the beginning and end of most episodes, Dobie addressed the camera directly with his observations and endless questions.  It's just one of many characteristics that set the show apart from its competition.  That. . .plus a flawless cast of comic actors and sharp, fast-paced writing.

I appeal to whatever entity controls the rights to this almost-forgotten gem of classic television:  Please bring Dobie back to our living rooms with a DVD release!",1154131200,,1566,5.216
