1093189,2,6305951624,"This was the movie I was most eagerly awaiting in 2000, the film based on the long-running manga series by CLAMP (Card Captor Sakura). Not usually  known for their serious comics, many people had doubts whether or not CLAMP  would succeed with X/1999. However, it became a great manga and among my  favorites.
I then had doubts about X: The Movie. My fears were realized.  First of all, many volumes of intense and dramatical manga were crushed  into an hour and a half of special effects and great animation. The script  went wrong somewhere, because at the very beginning we are winded with an  enormous amount of information that unfolded nicely in the manga. The  viewer is then subjected to our main character, Kamui, being projected back  and forth from dream to reality, and honestly, it didn't create the effect  intended. There were so many new techniques tested in this movie, that it  seemed more like an animation demo than a film. Events pass too  quickly.
Now, onto the good. The drawings were excellent and so were the  coloring. Music was powerful but not exceptional like Yoko Kanno's works.  This is the equivalent of MI2. New techniques in filming, but a pretty dull  movie (no offense to fans of MI2). Remember, this is only my personal  opinion, and others may have enjoyed this movie very much. If it had been  made into a long-running series with the same techniques and animation, it  would be among my favorites. But, unfortunately, CLAMP opted for a 90  minute movie instead.
Let's all keep our fingers crossed for an X/1999 TV  Series or OAV series to be released in the not-so-distant future. If you  want to see what this movie really should have been like, read the manga by  CLAMP.",967075200,,1712,4.712837837837838

1093191,5,6305951624,"Oh yes! If you loved Akira, yer gonna go nuts for X. However, if you've  seen the manga you might be a little dissapointed with it, but the  animation in this film has no equal here on in Japan. I will say this. Buy  it! Its definetly worth it. And if you were one of the few lucky people to  actually see it in theaters, I envy you. Maybe I'll be a little more lucky  when Manga Enteretainment brings End of Evangelion to theaters.",965865600,,432,4.095238095238095
1093192,4,6305951624,"X is probably one of my favorite anime movies of all time. It's based on a  manga of the same name by CLAMP. However the movie version tells a slightly  different story than the as yet uncompleted manga (which is currently  compiled in 10 tankabon).
The shojo animation by CLAMP and the character  designs by Nobuteru Yuki are absolutely beautiful and are far better than  the animation in some of CLAMP's earlier OAVs (i.e. RG Veda and Tokyo  Babylon). The music is also excellent with the dark and gloomy soundtrack  complementing the gothic feel of X perfectly. However the movie's plot  suffers from two major problems. Firstly, the plot is rather slim in  comparison with the X manga, sacrificing a lot of the character interaction  and backstory to fit the whole manga series onto one 90 minute video.  Because of this it also suffers from the same problem as RG Veda, in that  there are a few parts of the movie which are seemingly unrelated to the  rest of the film. It would have been much better if X had been made into a  series of OAVs instead of a single movie to preserve the manga's story in  its entirety. The only other problem that I had with X was that the main  character, Kamui, came off as a wimp because of his voice actor. The other  characters were voiced excellently but Kamui seemed to lose a lot of  resentment against his fate and because of this the feeling of angst that  pervades the manga series in less evident in the movie version of X.",965779200,19,1471,4.483018867924528
1093193,4,6305951624,"I'm sure you've heard this many times before, but X was originally a very long series...  and the movie seems kinda strange on it's own.  I know nothing about the series, so some things didn't seem explained well-enough.  The visuals were very nice, but the whole movie was pretty much in the  dark, which was somewhat annoying, although I guess it was just the  atmosphere of the movie.
Other than that though, the movie didn't have  really any flaws.  It's the story of a young man named Kamui who controls  the fate of the world.  It eventually just ends up as a battle of 7 on 7.  The Dragon of earth versus the dragon of heaven.  These ""dragons""  are really clans.  The Dragon of earth is a clan that wants armageddon, and  apocolypse so that the Earth can have a fresh start.  The dragon of Heaven  wants to try to stop the Dragon of earth, and try to keep the same earth.  Kamui sides with the dragon of heaven, so the dragon of earth is  essentially the bad guys.  I'm not going to spoil anymore of the story for  you though.
I bet that this movie would done much better if it was 2  and a half hours or something, rather than 1 hour and 40 mins.  I'm sure  they could've made everything much clearer for the viewer if they'd done  this.  I still thought the movie was very good, and had plenty of action  and nice animation, but It just seemed like I didn't even have the chance  to ""meet"" some of the characters before they died.
There is  lots of explosions, and Akira-like actions...  where enemies use their  minds to make the ground fall beneath their opponent or something of the  sort.  There's also a lot of blood.  There're swords going through people,  and heads coming off.  The violence isn't gratuitous, but is fairly  graphic.  That would probably explain the ""R"" rating.
In the  end, I was very satisfied with ""X"" and thought it was a worthy  effort at changing a series into a movie (even though I never saw the  series), but it could've used some more explaining and background  information...  and some character development.  But the stunning animation  and character design made up for that...  If you like action-sci-fi type  anime movies with some ninja and Akira-style fights, check this one out,  you probably won't be disappointed.",964828800,2,2265,4.533665835411472
1093194,4,6305951624,"When I heard about this movie I had to buy it, I'm an avid X manga fan and I love clamps work.  The way the weave stories and plots with dramatic twists.  But when I saw this I couldn't help but to compare it to the manga  with which I love.  That was my first mistake.  This is a movie which tries  to condense a series of graphic novels into 100 minutes or less.  It leaves  out characterization for action and gore, alters the story from the  original too.  I went in expecting an animated version of the manga, what I  got was good, but not what it could have been.  I've heard that theirs work  on a tv series based on X, maybe this time they'll stay with the story and  not change it for time constraints.  Oh, and the ending in the movie is  different then that of the manga, the movie was made before the manga even  had an ending written.  If your a fan of the manga and just want to see  your favorite characters animated then watch this, but if your expecting  something as great as the manga you'll be sorely disappointed.  Don't get  me wrong, this movie ranks up their with Ghost in the Shell and Akira, and  even Vampire hunter D, but that's if it's viewed as a seperate entity then  the manga.  So enjoy, but as with most books turned into movies it could  have been better.",964483200,3,1290,4.163265306122449

X The Movie is a very quick summary of the anime series. It takes hours and hours of drama and emotion and tries to pack it into a quick little film. The whole idea isn't bad, but there is just way too much story to rush like that. The whole movie doesn't make a lot of since. They couldn't fit everything into it. So being a fan of the X series and all CLAMP anime, I have to say that this movie is a failure. If you are thinking about watching the movie and haven't seen the series.

1093362,2,6305951624,"Alright. I read the manga, watched the anime, and felt it was time to watch the movie. Probably one of the worst things i could have bought frankly. Although, admittedly, i am a bit prejudiced, as one of my favorite characters died within the first 5 minutes(which he was not supposed to)...with only 10 or less seconds screen time. As much as I hate it though, i can see why they did the things they did, and they could have done a LOT worse. On the flip side, they could have done better too. I guess it's just really hard to put a complicated(read:long) plot into movie length...still....

ART: was good for it's time....but pretty bad by today's standards. Not horrible, jut kinda bad. Not exactly something that makes you go ""wow, that good"".

MUSIC: Eh. Sometimes it was kinda annoying, but not horrible. It was like it wasn't there most of the time, which means for each scene it fit pretty well. Again, it is pretty old though...

VOICE ACTING: eh... defiantly seen better. There were a ton of ""Haaa!""'s, and while i could see why they did it...it annoyed me. And the screaming. Oh the screaming. It was...really, really high pitched. Almost ""is that even possible"" high pitched.

PLOT: What plot? They took out a lot out of even the anime, which is 24 eps covering 18 volumes of manga....the movie tries to shove all that into the length of about 4 episodes. Tried is the keyword. Although they could have done a lot worse. The plot itself was alright, i guess. I don't know if anyone who hasn't read the manga or watched the anime would get it though...there were quite a few plot holes and everything happened so fast.

CHARACTERS: oh god, where to start....They just, you know, added a whole new character, took out some entirely(although there are a ton of characters in x, so i knew they couldn't have them all and a good plot), and for Subaru...poor Subaru...he only got about 10 or less seconds screen time. Which is sad because they only mention his name once, but he was an extremely important character in the anime and manga. Although that might be because he has his own manga, Tokyo Babylon....but still. He was one of my favorites, and they all but took him out. You don't learn anything about him. At all. And the rest of the characters don't get hardly any development. Well, actually that's an understatement. They don't get any at all hardly. Fuuma did, more so than any other character (even Kamui, the main character), although Kamui got a little too. I guess. If you want to call it that. By the end, it was still hard to gauge anyone's personality.",1332028800,,2579,4.573593073593074
1093363,4,6305951624,"The movie ""X"" is based loosely, and I mean LOOSELY off of Clamp's former flagship title of the same name, or internationally in some markets as ""X/1999"".  The plot centers mainly around the protagonist Kamui, who has returned to Tokyo after a long absence to participate in a battle to determine the fate of mankind.  Including Kamui, 14 people split into groups of 7 have taken sides as either a Dragon of Heaven or a Dragon of Earth.  The Dragons of Heaven seek to preserve humankind, while the Dragons of Earth seek to destroy mankind in order to allow the Earth to heal itself from the damage and pollution that mankind has caused to it.  A battle of biblical prophecy ensues when all the members have come together.

The movie was made in 1996 when the manga was roughly 4 years into its story, meaning that there was not much material to work off of at the time.  Consequently, the story became extremely convoluted and hard to follow and characters had to be altered or cut out completely.  Thankfully, the alterations were relatively minor and the characters that were cut out had little to no influence on the course of events that would unfold.  This movie felt like it moved too fast to absorb everything thanks to the 91 minute runtime.  This film could have been better paced if it was extended by a least 30 more minutes. Thankfully, the lack of content is balanced out with amazingly beautiful artwork, literally some of the best I have had the privilege to see. This film is a visual masterpiece that in my opinion is without equal even today.  My advice, watch the anime and/or read the manga first before viewing this film so as to learn the backgrounds of all the characters and ultimately, fill in the many gaps of the story this film ignores. Overall, a worthy viewing but it is a love it or hate it type film, take caution.",1330646400,,1845,4.546827794561934
1093364,3,6305951624,"I was very excited when this movie came in ... I had been wanting to watch it for several years, as I had read the manga series and watched part of the anime series.  But I have to say, I am a bit disappointed with the movie.  It is impressive that they crammed so much into roughly 87 minutes, but it loses a *lot* by so much cramming.  The anime series deviates from the manga a bit, but this movie deviates a LOT from both for no apparent reason other than they just didn't want to introduce yet more characters into the movie's plot.  Basically, you're getting the wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am version of the series from this movie.

If you just want a quick run-down of X/1999 and are in the mood for some action-oriented, violently bloody anime, then I'm sure you will enjoy this.  But if you are a purist and prefer your anime to stick to the original storyline as much as possible, you might want to skip it.  I have been a big X and CLAMP fan for years, so I was curious and glad to at least give it a try ... so if you do plan to watch it regardless, just don't expect a thorough story here.",1323648000,,1097,4.195238095238095

*Spoilers*

First off, if you're not familiar with the X manga, I can honestly say that it is essential for you to brush up on the basics before attempting to watch this movie or you will be completely lost and confused. Unfortunately, the problem with this movie is that once you've brushed up on the manga (say, by reading the Wikipedia entry on it), you've already reached the level of immersion this movie offers. The beginning of the movie sets the scene - the main character's nude and dead (dying?) mother shows up in a dream and explains that the apocalypse is coming, he's the chosen one to prevent it, and a list of the seven trustworthy heroes that will fight along side him is as follows...etc., etc.

And that's fine as far as it goes - bland but standard scene setting focusing on avoiding character development as much as possible and cutting straight to the action. Unfortunately, the seven heroes are almost immediately reduced to ancillary support characters, where ""support"" is loosely defined as ""die as quickly and as stupidly as possible"", which is a shame because the battles are really the only thing this movie has to hang its hat on.

Well, that's not entirely true - the one other driving plot point in this movie is that the main character and his childhood friend are destined to oppose each other - whichever side the main character chooses to aid (humanity and technology vs. extinction and nature, basically), his friend will be compelled to oppose him from the other side. While this particular aspect is interesting, intriguing, and potentially tragic, it breaks down in two major respects. Firstly, the main character is so poorly characterized that it is difficult to feel any real resonance with him. He repeatedly protests that he absolutely *will not* fight to save the world because, he says, he ""only want to protect my friends!"" The problem, of course, being that he never puts together that the end of humanity will eventually entail the end of his pals as well.

Indeed, as an aside, I have to say that this anime seems unique in the sense that I actually ended up rooting for the ""bad"" guys - even though I strongly got the impression that I wasn't 'supposed' to - because they generally seemed more good than the ""good"" guys. The bad guys at least threw themselves into their work, rather than passively reacting constantly like the good guys did. They'd put thought and preparation into their training and strategy, while it seemed that the good guys had sat around on their thumbs all day. And the bad guys seemed to genuinely believe in their cause - intending to wipe out all humanity, including themselves, for the good of the planet - as opposed to the lackluster enthusiasm of the good guys who basically said (and I'm paraphrasing) ""Things may not be so great nowadays, but my kids don't seem to know the difference."" There's a rallying cry.

Which brings me neatly to the second problem with the ""Destined Tragedy"" plot. The writers seem to realize, about half-way through the movie, that the hero's foil is intensely more likable than the cardboard cut-out main character and decide to remedy this by immediately switching the foil character over to an insane, homicidal madman who kills friends and allies alike with a single blow. And it is this character shift - a desperate attempt to steer the story back on track and explain *why* the two characters can't just sit down and talk it out over a latte - that completely kills the movie because it's a gimmicky contrivance that removes drama (as well as all the remaining ancillary characters) instantly.

Tragedies aren't tragic because someone we don't care about dies - if ""X"" had truly wanted to be tragic and thought provoking, then the two foil characters should have both chosen a side they truly believe in and then fought for that side with a heavy heart (a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suikoden-II/dp/B00001X50L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suikoden II</a>). Instead, the writers try to have their cake and eat it to by making the hero a soggy ""I don't want to be involved"" cardboard cut-out and the anti-hero a stereotypical madman on a murder spree, thus allowing them to dodge any moral questions about the nature of mankind and our affect on the earth. Unfortunately, if you want a tragedy, you can't dodge moral questions like that.

Having said all that, I have to now admit that I still found the movie oddly interesting - enough to maybe watch it again, hence my rating. One of my guilty pleasures is the ""Dragonball Z"" series, mostly because I think the subtext behind the writing is genuinely interesting, but I will admit that the spectacle fighting can be pleasant to watch. And that's kind of what this movie feels like - like someone took a manga about two opposing groups with super heroes, paired them all off, and told them to have at it. If that was all ""X"" was, I would have likely enjoyed it on those merits alone, but it still shoots itself in the foot by having the fights be terminally short and by making the characters die for stupid, suicidal reasons.

To wrap this review up, there's two more things worth noting. First, there's definitely nudity and violence in this movie, so be forewarned if that sort of thing bothers you. Second, there is something rather 'off' with the English subtitles for the hearing impaired - not only do they not match the actual English dialogue (something I've come to expect from most anime), there are huge stretches of dialogue that isn't subtitled *at all*. I can't say that the lack of subtitles would hamper your understanding of the movie, but that's mostly an indictment on the bland dialogue itself rather than an excuse.

1093440,2,6305951624,"The film X is based off of an apocalyptic manga series.  However, unlike the manga, the film focuses on the roles of Kamui, Kotori, and Fuma, and the roles they play in the Apocalypse.  But this abbreviated story reduces the Dragons of the Heavens and the Earth to minor characters that the viewer never really gets to know.  And since so little character development has been done for the Dragons of the Heavens and the Earth, it's hard to feel any sense of loss as each of these characters are killed off during the film.  There is also very little done in the film in the way of plot development, which can make the film hard to follow if you don't already have some familiarity with the property through the manga or the X anime series that was produced several years later.

The DVD contains five special features.  The first is labeled, ""Tarot Cards.""  There are three sets of cards: The Seven Dragons of Heaven, The Seven Dragons of Earth, and The Dream Watchers.  Under each section, you select a name, and you see a picture of a character in a ""tarot card,"" and information about the character is provided.  For many of the characters in the film, you get much more of their backstories through this feature than you ever get in the film.

There is a photo gallery, which is made up completely of stills from the film.  The ""Director's Interview"" is twenty-three pages of text that the viewer reads through.  There is also an English theatrical trailer for the film included.

X is an R-rated film, and it earns this designation primarily from all the blood that's shown during the film.  While there is some nudity, it is overshadowed by the blood.  With this rating, I cannot recommend this film to anyone under the age of 17.  If you like blood and gore and very little in the way of plot or character development, then you might find some enjoyment in this film.

I have never seen the series or read the manga, so this was fresh for me and the story works just fine. It makes your brain work a little bit, but that's ok and one of the reasons I watch anime flicks from time to time.. most of then usually have a plot that requires some mental interaction on the part of the viewer.

The animation and imagery are well done and extremely cool, the story - as mentioned - definitely holds your interest, the fight scenes are awesome, especially the finale.

Realizing, of course, they are seperate entities in themselves and the main story hasn't been changed, but much of the story has been distorted. I cant help but feel a grave sense of loss and ""WTF?!"" when watching this... The main fights, how certain character's die, even one of the Dragons of Earth is completely different! Alas, yet another reason for Kakyou to wallow in his corner of woe.
This movie could have been better, but condensing such an immense story line into two-off hours isn't a task to be taken lightly- Seeing as it's the fate of the world and all. Unfortunately, this might have been a task better unattempted. On that note: rent it, borrow it, but I don't recommend buying it unless you need a coaster.

I knew it would not compare with the beautiful art by the CLAMP artists but the movie was horrible. The sense of plot you can get by reading the Manga was destroyed harshly, though the frame work of the idea is still there vital details are missing and so it misleads you about the entire goal. There is utterly no character development and its a dispassionant episode that is hastily thrown together. The art is still beautiful, but that is all.

The ending is different, and some of the characters have changed slightly, even parts of ths story have changed a bit.

The overall feeling of this movie, however, left me feeling disappointed. It ended so suddenly and seemed too quick for the seriousness of what this is based around. This was released a year before the first X series DVD was released, which leads me to believe X the series ws a result of this to deepen the story where this one lacked it.

I was disappointed with how this seemed to be rushing through everything to get to the final ending which was lacking.

The animation itself is pretty good i think and the ending song is great. But really the ending pretty much sucked, and as for the end of the world?

(some that died in the movie ended up not dying in the series and vica versa) the tv series basically gives each charicter an in depth story so you better relate to them and explains things like ""barrier fields"" in a understandable fashion. if i had not seen the tv series in its entirety before watching the movie, i wouldnt understand much of what went on. but as i said, some things were changed. for instance 2 charicters that end up falling in love and living in the seires... .actually hate and fight each other in the movie and end up dying. i prefer the story the way the tv series did it, but the movie for what it is is its own masterpiece. i see it as a loose adaptation of the manga/tv series with alot of creative changes implied. but this doesnt make it a bad movie, this is definately one of the better animes",1114041600,,1635,4.193650793650794

If you HAVE NOT SEEN the TV series and want to know why everything happened the way they happened(yeah, I know, you tried your best to figure it out...), PLEASE GO SEE THE TV SERIES (24 episodes).

The movie's plot was simple, which is good, but it was made complex by ""dreams"" of the potential future thrown in at random times throughout the movie.  This made it hard to guess what was reality and what was the dream.  I think the movie would have done better if it were to stick the hardcore action and skip the overly-melodramatic dreams.
The basic premise of this movie is good versus good.  Humans have been raping the planet for their entire existence.  Now the earth is about to crack; Mother Nature needs a rest.  The group that supports the Dragon of the Earth advocates wiping the human race out to accomplish this.  The group that supports the Dragon of the Heaven believes humans must achieve the greatness god planned for them.  That they will return Mother Nature to her greatness we just need to get over ourselves first.  We can accomplish this through love and all that other jazz.  Convoluted?  Yes but each argument has a leg to stand on.  With this being said you would think that one would be torn about whom to root for.  But this movie makes this choice for you by weak character development and those stupid dreams mentioned earlier.  The bad guy is this evil sadistic psycho and instead of empathizing with him you just want to see him dead.
Overall the movie was simple but was made complex by useless scenes.  And on top of that the ending was predictable and frustrating.  See it for the sake of seeing it but don't buy.  It will leave you frustrated making you want to hit the drawing board and come up with a better script and more cool characters.",1059436800,,1722,4.429936305732484
1093659,2,6305951624,"From the very beginning of X - an animated movie based on the manga by Clamp and animated by Mad House - you know that this is going to be gory and graphic. Rintaro, of Astro Boy fame, directed this one.
It's also very clear from the beginning that the movie, made in 2000, was created for the fans of the complex Manga series. You get a quick scene of a boy - Kamui - being given a sword drawn from the stomach of his naked mother. She then recites a laundry list of ""These are your friends, these are your enemies"", showing each one briefly. While manga fans will instantly connect with them, newcomers to the series will be completely lost.
Kamui is sent to Tokyo to face the Final Battle of the Dragon of Heaven vs the Dragon of Earth. He and the ""good guys"" are on the side of Heaven. The ""bad guys"" think the city is full of corruption, pollution and slime and needs to be cleansed so there can be a rebirth. We start with a personal battle beteen a pair of enemies, which apparently is the overture. And on the battles go ... well, in between all the flashbacks and dream sequences and meandering. There's lots of religious symbolism, from angels and devils to pentagrams and people being crucified. Kamui, the hero, is told his name mean's God's Power.
The ""good side"", the Dragon of Heaven, gets power from the 7 stars of the big dipper. They are defeated one by one. Kamui is told the 7 Dragons of Earth solely wish to destroy the earth. He refuses to care and just wants to protect his friends Fuma and Kotori. As it turns out, the final battle is between Kamui and his best friend, Fuma. Whatever side Kamui chooses, Fuma must be the other. And just as Kamui got a sword from his mom, Fuma pulls one from his sister.
Interestingly, even though the original Manga's creators, Clamp, is made up of all women, I was disappointed to see either banana-brained girly-girls or lap-dancers. The two main girls - sisters - fall on the two sides of that coin. The two other main females both die gruesomely in order to 'birth' swords for their guys. The guys on the other hand are strong, intelligent and complex. It's a pretty bizarre vision to come from a smart group of women.
I'm sure it was really hard to fit the complex Manga story into a 100-minute movie. But there are so many ways that it COULD have been told well. As it is, you have a hero who doesn't seem to really care about or do anything for the city. He decides to protect his 2 friends instead, but doesn't even do that. There are many battles between sides that we don't care about, and teammates just 'stroll' along when their friends are in danger.
As far as the main sides, all we know is that there are the ""earth cleansers"" and ""earth savers"".

When he comes back to Tokyo, he isn't as friendly with them, and they are both worried. Kamui's destiny is to either become a Dragon of Heaven or a Dragon of Earth. The Seven Dragons of Heaven want to protect mankind, but the Seven Dragons of Earth want to destroy it. Kamui chooses to become a Dragons of Heaven. When he does that, his Twin Star is supposed to be a Dragon of Earth. A Twin Star is like Kamui's equal, whom he will battle. Ironically, Fuma, his childhood frined, is his Twin Star. Fuma, when he bocems and Earth Dragon, forgets all his past. Kamui doesn't knwo who his Twin Star is, thought, and is sad and surprised when he finds out who it is. Kamui, along with the six other Dragons of Heaven, Yuzuriha, Karen, Subaru, Sorata, and two others that I forget (sorry :(), battle the Dragons of Earth, and everyone dies excpet for Kamui and Fuma.

1093721,3,6305951624,"I don't have the DVD for this anime, but I have seen the anime itself a couple of times. Hey c'mon now, the anime's DVD features isn't what's important here, but rather, the anime itself overall.
What can we say about, X? I'd say, it's definitely not for the discretion of the weak. Everything in this anime is geared towards adults. The story-telling, the character personas and the art/scene portrayals. This is one animation that is truly sadistic and depressive...in a great point of concept and perspective. It's just like watching your favorite day-to-day soap opera or a full-length romance film, only it adds a sinister twisted elements of betrayal, agony and violence.
X, tells the story about a young boy who must decide the fate of Earth and of humans; He could either destroy it, or spare and save this corrupted world. Kamui Shirou, the protagonist, has been away and hasn't seen the only 2 people (and closefriends) he ever cares about for 6 years. He made a promise to protect and love them no matter what through eternity. And just who are these 2 individuals Kamui loves? Fuuma and Kotori Monou, 2 siblings who has known Kamui ever since they were little kids.
6 yrs. later, Kamui returns to Tokyo to fulfill his destiny and to prepare for this menacing threat he was foretold about. But that's not the worst part of it... For Kamui Shirou, it's himself. It's his soul's matter of 'fate vs. faith', being thorned apart by his own will and destiny...leading to his eventual loneliness in the end. Along with Kamui are these other psionic characters who also wields the vigorous potentials of psychokenesis, being able to come into people's mind and their dreams, freezing time and so fort. Definitely cool and unique fictional characters with super-unatural powers.
The movie version from my opinion, only summarizes what the anime's storyline/plot is really about. But there's a few missing puzzles there and you can only understand it by watching the television series (X/1999) including characters not in the movie and an even more detailed story. The movie isn't that bad, except maybe for the bad English-dubbing part?",1039996800,,2139,4.911602209944752

1093723,3,6305951624,"I saw X first on a fansub, then I saw it on the big screen (in English) when it was released in the US.
ANIMATION------
Overall, I loved the detail, motion, and setting.  It was elegentaly done and very realistic.  Most of the symbolic imagery was handled fairly well. Unfortunatley the manga goes into a bit more detail, or better handles some of the symbolic imagery. For animation however, it was the best the animators could have done.
TRANSLATION ------ (Subtitle vs. English)
The subtitling I felt was closer to how the manga was written. However, it only gave you enough detail to progress the story in the movie. A lot of little details were left out. The english version is a bit more basic, and I think anyone of the age 13+ could easily understand it. (It was TOO basic, and almost treated the audience like they were dumb)
STORYLINE -----------
The manga's ending hasn't yet been revealed in the American released comics. However, the basic underlying storyline is the same for both. A young teenage boy is chosen (by fate perhaps) to become the one who will decide the future of the earth. The future can follow two paths, the path where mankind is dominant (yet does not overstep his boundaries by destroying the earth), or where earth tries to reclaim herself (man is removed through the picture through certain events).  The outcome in the movie was pretty quick, and brutal (I'm not saying which one it is :P ).
WHERE THE MOVIE SUFFERED THE MOST --------
1) The gradual build of suspense...  it isn't quite there. The movie is a 2 hour rush of 12+ (graphic novel) issues. The pace of the movie has a few slow scenes where some of the emotion and symbology are shown, and then rushes through other scenes (some combat scene's that's expected, but they don't leave you time to think during some of the more intellectual momements).
2) Character developement.  The ""cast"" of characters is enormous. Excluding one or two small differences, the characters in the movie are essentially the same as the ones in the manga.  In the movie you are introduced to them in bunches and too rapidly to form any kind of attachment or understanding of them. Only one or two key traces of their personality shine through, but that's not enough to make you really feel for the good guys.  In the manga, there is more than enough time to see the humor, sadness, and profound impact of the potential future within the characters expressions and interactions.  Sorata is extremley charasmatic and funny, but other than one or two quick-witted comments, you don't see that in the movie.
------- WHAT THE MANGA SUFFERS FROM -----
It's a bit too drawn out. As much as I love any forms of symbology (which they were all well done), they are repeated too many times. Instead of balancing the repetitive symbology with weight according to its depth/importance, the symbology for most everything is repeated so much it numbs you to the stories depth.  This is especially with Kamui, and Fuuma.  The foreshadowing is almost as blindingly apparent in the manga as in the comic. The storyline had some heavy overtones, but with this foreshadowing they take away some of the impact of Kamui and Fuuma's situation.
Other than that, I love the manga (and its Kabbalistic comparisons & allusions). I also own every issue released here in the US.
Lastly.....
I RECOMMEND THE MANGA.  HOWEVER IF YOU LOVE ANIME, WAIT UNTIL THE OVA IS RELEASED IN THE US. I only recommend buying the movie for die-hard Clamp fans, or ""X"" fans.",1031097600,,3502,4.715220949263503
1093775,3,6305951624,"INTRO:  When I first bought this DVD, I was kinda' diving into a show that I had not read the manga of, and I half and half regret and am thankful for that.  The reasons why are:
--Regret:  I didn't get to hear the whole backstory and learn about the whole plot before hand.
--Thankful:  I'm glad I didn't get attached to the characters who died in this as much as I already did.
----------------------------------------
DVD:  To start, the DVD itself is average.  Nothing too special.  Has bios and some trailers and such.  I can't complain but can't praise it either.
----------------------------------------
STORY/PLOT:  The movie (and series) seems extremely well-done.  Usually I don't mind these types of shows (severely depressing).  Its just this one seemed to go a little bit too far.  Which isn't totally bad, its kinda' a twist from the normal ""Hero saves princess"" routine.  I would watch it a few times actually.

OVERALL:  I know this isn't the ""main"" review to read.  You should obviously read someone else's review before mine (or after).  The only advice I can give is that you should probably see the manga first since its far better from the many Otaku I've heard from.  Second, if you are hardcore into this series, you might want to check out the TV version that is coming out.  It details the events before this movie (the final chapter in the series) and gives the lengthy manga new light.",1029801600,4,1452,4.881147540983607

This is where the problem comes in we have such a lack of charecter depth.  If you do not go to the special features and read the backgrounds then you will be at total lost.  The story could have expanded on more of the charecter's background such as the main charecter's relationship with his mother, or the connection between the two best friends could have been explained more.

Is there a plot somewhere in this piecemeal mish-mash?  I looked hard and came up emtpy handed.  The movie suffers from far too many characters that are utterly insignificant and weak.  The dragons of heaven die off like doughboys in the wrong trench, without a thought given to their character development.  Once the dragons of earth start dying, the movie just becomes laughably bad.
At least the action sequences are half-decent, but they don't even deserve to be compared with the edge-of-your-seat battles in Neon Genesis:Evangelion.  To conclude?

I'd heard a lot about it, so I decided, 'hey, why not?' and ponied up the 20 bucks for the priviledge of taking it home.  My first impression?  Perhaps this was the weapon the Pied Piper of Hamlin used to chase the children away (or did they go with him?), because after seeing this film, I was certainly left with a few vivid impressions, namely #1: Anime fans who like this [stuff] are into violence, and #2: those same said fans probably smoke...quite often.  The entire movie is vulgar and disgusting, going from bloodbath to bloodbath, with forgettable characters like ""that chick who gets blown up"" and ""that chick with weird super powers"" and ""that evil guy who thinks he's the good guy for reasons that I really don't want to know.""  Of course, it's not all blood and violence, thankfully, our beloved and benevolent animators decided to put in a bunch of Kamui (main character)'s hallucinations, which probably can be enjoyed best ...while listening to Pink Floyd.  These hallucinations make no coherent sense, nor are they explained at all throughout the flick, making me increasingly itchy that I spent [money] on the stupid thing.  Thankfully, the movie ends, though to no one's satisfaction, if you're into that silly thing about ""happy"" or ""sensical"" endings.

1093782,2,6305951624,"I have several of the graphic paperbacks from the X/1999 clamp production.  I've read and puzzled over those, and now I have spent several hours with this DVD.  There comes a point in the quest for value where one has to finally ponder why a work is the way it is.  I don't expect every DVD or book to be a work of art, but I do expect that each such effort have some sense of its purpose or potential value.
In the case of 'X', I confess I am mystified.  On the surface, a young man (Kamui) returns to Tokyo at the behest of his dying mother to defend those he loves.  But he fails to defend Kotori, who loves him, and forces his friend Fuuma to make impossible choices.  On the layer below this Kamui and Fuuma are doomed to become the primary antagonists in a struggle over whether the human race should be allowed to survive.  In the ensuing fight, shared with the other dragons of heaven and earth, the destruction is sufficient to wonder whether the cure is worse than the disease.
In truth, the plot is a pre-ordained ballet of opposing forces driven to a tragic conclusion.  I am not familiar with Japanese literature, but 'X' reminds me of a Greek tragedy where anyone could stop the inevitable end, but no one does.  Kamui's tragic flaw is his inability to act until it is too late.  Fuuma, supposedly the villain of the piece, seems to be the nobler of the two, simply because he throws himself into his role.  All of the characters are disjointed archetypes, but despite all of the symbols and portents, nothing really gels.
So this becomes an apocalypse in search of a cause.  Harumitsu Shimuzu as put together an excellent score, which seems to capture Kamui's perpetual agonizing and the film's ambivalent perfectly.  The film's theme, 'Forever Love' by Yoshiki, is worth keeping as well.  But good music and interesting artwork are not enough to overcome a skeletal plot that never moves in any direction for long.  A glance at the final credits reveals that this was a production with a cast of hundreds, and perhaps that is the problem.

Kamui must decide between becoming a Dragon of Heaven, or a Dragon of Earth, and his best friend from childhood, Fuuma, is destined to be his enemy.
The story is wonderful and the art is gorgeous, however, the movie was actually based on the X/1999 manga that was (I believe) 8 volumes long. The movie was abridged to fit into the space of 90 or so minutes, so you don't get the same feel for the characters.

The story revolves around a boy who returns to tokyo to protect his two friends from childhood.  His mother is dead (in a very gruesome manner) and he si destined to become one of two dragons, the dragons of heaven (white) or the dragon of Earth (red).  the dragons of heaven want to save mankind while the dragons of earht want to destroy them.  Neither one is really a villian because both have their good and bad qualites.  Each also has a good argument for their cause.  However there is piece of the puzzle left out, and that would be that the boy has a double that would counter his every move, and take up the other form.

1093880,2,6305951624,"I rented this movie last week, just to see how it looked and sounded on DVD. I picked up the cover and thought ""Whoah cool! A movie made out of one of my favorite mangas!"". X (X/1999) is one of Clamp's best mangas to date and I was hoping that the movie version would do the manga enough justice. Unfortuantely, it didn't. And now that I've seen the film in it's entirety, I kinda wish I didn't waste the $[money] I payed to rent this garbage. I didn't know an anime movie could really [be] this bad ~_~. *Never judge a film by it's poster* will have to be my slogan for now on.
I was really disappointed by the time I got finished with about half of the movie. It was moving at the pace of a snail. I groaned at the fact that I had about another 30 minutes to go. As the movie went on though, it did get better. But overall the movie  [stinks].
However, the film does have it's good points.
The video quality on the DVD is just superb though. Every visual aspect of this film is excellent. The animation , fight scenes, and backrounds are all lush, complex, and filled with color. The score for the film is effectic but forgetable. The dub is absolutely horrible, but the sub is decent and actually has some occasional good diolauge.
The main thing that really made me cringe though, was the movie's plot. The plot itself is okay, but the way it's executed just totally blows. As mentioned in previous reviews on this site, you have this epic battle for the destiny of the Earth between the Dragons of the Heavens and the Dragons of the Earth. Our hero, Kamui, barely does anything in the movie besides dose off and have trippy (but nicely animated) dream sequences about Kotori dieing in some gruesome manner or just the future in general. Kamui doesn't actually *do* anything until the last 30 minutes of the movie, right after Fuuma pulls that sword out of Kotori. He doesn't seem to care about the fate of the city either, even though he was warned in a dream sequence of how it would end up if the Dragons of the Heavens failed. He looked concerned then. I suppose protecting Kotori and Fuuma is more important? He can't even do that, the dumb[bell]!
Kamui's allies also have the most horrible tactics and battle strategies ever. It just doesn't even seem as if they know that a battle for the fate of the world is brewing up. Everytime one of their numbers dies, the remaing guy just weeps uncontrollably (leaving him/herself totally open) or just tries to assist. About half of the movie's heroes die in the first 30 minutes of the movie also. I could barely remember any of the guys' names before they died! I mean, aren't these ""Dragons"" supposed to be highly skilled? I could do better than these idiots.
There are also the horrible plot devices. Like in cheesy horror movies, people just stand around instead of running away. Also, what was the point of Satsuki and her mega-computer? Was there really a point to that? I also didn't like how they introduced the characters. They did all in just one big clump where everyone was introduced at the same time. One of my favorite characters in the manga, Subaru, was killed within the first five minutes of the movie as well!

The story is a bit like Wedding Peach and Sailormoon but more serious and more violence....well at least to my point of view.
I just love watching Earth and Heaven Dragons fighting with all their strange powers...such as the swords came out from body, ribbon flying...the best one coz it reminds me to chinese movie and etc. And the special part is that they don;t even have to transform like Sailormoon to fight. 24 hours prepared for a fight.

One thing that is not known about 1999 is that the city of Toyko (Not actually happened) was levelled in an apocalyptic battle between the dragons of earth and heaven.
X is an excellent example of Manga converted to Anime like Akira but only made for the fans of the Manga and not taking into consideration. The story line is confused and even more so in the Japanese version of the anime. Although it has these downfalls X is an excellent anime and all fans should get a copy as it's religious undertones and excellent battle sequences lead to a jaw dropping results.
X is an anime of the ages and the confusing story line can be forgiven because the battles and animation is close to overtaking the great Akira.

Personally I think they tried a bit to hard on this film, sometimes simple is better.  Hear they just made everything complex and really hard to swallow.

First off, your basing a movie off of material (CLAMP'S X/1999) that was STILL IN PUBLICATION when the movie was made.  So of course A LOT of stuff was cut out.
Second, the plot was reduced to a 90 minute ""[fight] fest.""  People appeared and dissapeared for no reason whatsoever!  And there's a lot of the ""what the hell's going on"" factor.  We never have time to dive into the characters, so when they die...we don't care.
Third, it is poorly scripted.  The first act, Kamui spends deciding which side he should join.  The second act, everyone is offed one by one.  Where's the middle?
Fourth, one of the worst endings ever.
Fifth, bad BAD voice acting.  Both Japanese and English.
Well, I've said it.  The only plus this movie has going for it is the animation.  Everything else is crap.  Avoid this one.  Or better yet, try to find a bootleg copy of the OVA or the TV series.  At least then you get some more substance for the style.

Unlike the other reviewers, I'd say there WAS a plot(if you know CLAMP very well, you'd understand)  The story is sooooo CLAMP-like. Nanase Ohkawa - one of the CLAMP members, who creates the stories and plots, likes putting twists and turns you'd never expect and fate plays a huge part in the stories of CLAMP.

Just as the amazon.com reviewer stated, the plot of ""X"" is so simple, yet it is made extremely complicated by back and forth scene shifting, similar to a Quentin Tarantino film and too many characters. ""X"" is a rather dark film which has the overused, and generic plot which pits a man against the destruction of the entire world. The ""dragons"" are superior beings who battle each other throughout Tokyo. The dragons from earth, do not want to destroy the earth, but destroy the human race which they feel is destroying their earth. The dragons from heaven are sent to stop the earth dragons. The battles are often quick and become too repetitive. Many of the beings a.k.a. dragons have their own special power. The dragons from heaven create a shield each time they battle so the rest of the city does not get damaged. As the film slowly moves along, the last 20 minutes are a bloody mess, where most of the chracters parish in quick sequences. But by then I didn't care, I just wanted the film to end. The last scene is a sentimental sequence between a man and a body-less head! It supposed to be sad, but I found it rather amusing. Don't get me wrong, ""X"" isn't the worst Anime film, it's just average. My review may have pointed out all the negative, but the film did have it's positives. The animation production is by Mad House who did the classic ""Ninja Scroll."" My theory: rent this before you think of buying it.",1010361600,,1527,4.457142857142857

Before I talk about how awful this movie was I tell you what's good, beautiful artwork and design, in-fact if your an art student your the only person I might reccomend getting this because of the great artwork.
Now onto the bad, where to start......ahh yes, a plot, which X tries to have but ends up failing. There are two groups, the Dragons of Earth and The Dragons of Heaven, The Earth dragons want to destroy Earth to restore it back to how it was before we ""evil"" humans ravaged it and the Heaven Dragons want to protect us for Earth Dragons. Inbetween it all is a boy named Kamui who doesn't know what the hell is going on. He came back to town to protect his friends but, ends up joining the Heaven Dragons, too bad one of friends, Fuma, is swayed by the Earth Dragons and becomes the all powerful ulta-enemy, Kamui has to face at the end of the movie.

And that how it goes until we get to great big battle, that they been vamping the entire time, and IT ONLY LAST ABOUT 30 seconds!

It's a real pity those same characters don't make much of an appearance in the movie.  Oh, sure, they have the same faces and names, but sometimes that seems to be about it.  But that's not the worst.  The worst is that the movie makes *no sense at all,* and like I said, I've read the manga.

It's not that the plot is not understandable; it's that everything happens so quickly that you don't even really meet the characters.  For example, take all those human-dragons.  Just by the way they are presented, you can guess that there's a lot of backstory behind them.  But in the film, they just get killed very quickly.  Also, for two groups that are supposed to be somewhat equal, everytime a good guy faces a bad guy, he gets his but kicked.
Finally, my biggest grip is the more-or-less friend of the hero who, for no sufficient reason I can remember, decides to join the 'evil' side, and in a matter of days, becomes as powerful as the hero who seems to have been training since childhood.  Hellooooo!?  I'm all for suspension of disbelieve, especially in anime, but this is ridiculous !

1094038,4,6305951624,"An interesting question X tries to answer. Before I start my review here's a little warning:
DO NOT WATCH THIS WITH THE ENGLISH DUB!!!
I saw it twice in japanese and understood everything. Then I saw it once in english and I was totally lost. Everything is different in English! The brief moments of humor - gone. The tragic element of impending doom - completely missing. Any sense of compassion or sympathy for Kamui, Fuma or Kotori - simply not there. But rest assured that in their places we find a) bad acting b) a lot of words and pointless explanations that were NOT in the original version c) Some of the most incredibly stupid translations and pronounciations of names.
People said ""Kotori"" and I thougt they were talking about ""cutlery"". And somehow they made ""Kamui"" sound exactly like ""Kanoe""
My favorite moment in the english version is when Kotori cuts her hand on the magic rain and as she starts bleeding Fuma brilliantly points out ""You're hurt!"". In the Japanese version he says nothing.
So, anyhoodelidoodely: my review
I like it. The anmation is great. The interaction between the good guys (however brief) lets us know exactly what they're like and what the chemistry between them is like. The two bad guys (the one who control water and the one who has that long scarf thingy -I forget their names) are sooooo cool. I only subtracted a star because I would have prefered to see less people die from suicide/selfdestruct/two for one kind of thing where both fighters perish together. The best deaths are the individual ones. And while the end is no surprise I love it. It's short, sweet, to the point and completely inevitable. The whole movie plays out like a greek tragedy. Their destinies foretold the brave warriors try to alter fate but find in doing so they actually end up making it happen. Great stuff. Yes, Tragic but great. Everything can't be a Disney cartoon!
And don't worry about not understanding the plot. Anyone who knows anything about anime should catch on to the storyline pretty quickly. It's quite straight forward and should certainly not stop anyone from enjoying this fine piece of work and its gorgeus art and stunning animation.

Transitioning it to a movie though, leaves too little time.  There's a slew of characters, most of which simply aren't developed at all due to time constraints.  Mind you, we do have beautiful art and good music, and the underlying story is a good one.  But this anime, like many, fails in the budget department.  It would have been better released as a long OVA series.  Instead, we're left with 5-star potential, 4-star production quality, and a 2-star transition to the screen.

Not for the normal reasons I have (bad voice acting being one) but because whoever wrote the script for the English track must have assumed that American audiences would have no clue what was going on.  Most of it is such overkill.  I tend to think Kanoe gives off the evil creepy vibe but it was explained within the first five minnutes that she was not the one to trust.  Come now, if Kamui's mother did tell him such a thing do you really think he'd be that mean to the one he was told he could trust?  The whole plot is a bit grim and with how little time there is between battles it can almost be summarized in saying ""You're going to die.  Face the fact.  Your only choice is are you going to make your death a memorable one?""  In closing the manga gives more to the story than just fighting and death.

What was inside was definitely far different from what I perceived it to possibly have in it.  The plot line was disjointed, but very intriguing, though the messiah image is a bit cliqued, even though it works superbly into this movie.  The messiah plot did have some of its own quirks in this movie that are fairly original.  The whole mood and tone of the movie was oppressing and brooding, the animation surely made a proper set-up for the end of the world.  The characters were excellent, the ones that actually spoke and did not die randomly, especially Fuuma and Kamui.  The visuals were remarkable, definitely better than most animation out there.  The ending was kind of drawn out with a quick conclusion, and a time of mourning.  This is one of the most depressing animes I have seen, even more so than Akira, or the finale of Cowboy Bebop.  Well cheer for the Dragon of Heaven, but weep for the Dragon of Earth and watch something funny after this movie, because it really is depressing.

This leads to some amazing fight scenes between the unbelievably powerful members of each group as they both want to recruit Kamui for their cause.  I don't want to give away much more of the storyline but as it progresses, you definitely notice a yin-yang type atmosphere.  This is a extremely dark/gothic type anime that has the best art since Ninja Scroll.  Had the plot been more straight forward and less jumbled with confusing dream sequences and constant cutting between the various characters it would be a masterpiece of modern animation.

The premise was good, the visual were good...but any background details about the characters were virtually nonexistant. We have three friends, two guys and a girl, and we have some superheroes in the typical anime fashion: larger than life (which I like, don't get me wrong). You have a large corporation, you have bad guys, and you have magic and technology. All good stuff. What you don't have, unfortunately, is any depth to these characters. The final bad guy seems to go almost instantaneously, and without any provocation, from a best friend to worst enemy. They never touch on why he changes, or really get into the psychology of it all. I'm willing to bet anything that the manga itself goes real in depth with this, but in the anime it's just plain unbelievable. I almost didn't finish the movie, but did and went away with it leaving a bad taste in my mouth.
My suggestion: if you've read the manga you need to watch this movie. I love having my favorite mangas spring onto the silver screen, it's so awesome to watch them. However, if not prepare yourself for a mediocre anime with zippo in the way of character development. They introduce the characters, then systematically begin to kill them off. It's not the happiest of endings either, let me just warn you.
Why 3 stars then, if I don't have anything nice to say? Because it's good if you actually know the background info, and I loved the animation. Simple as that. :)",982022400,,1955,4.509859154929577

Good animation, though i think the dubbing took away part of the quality of the film. the only reason this film is receiving a mediocre rating is because of the strong contrast of opinions, on one side there's the people who like the ""happily ever after"" film, and the other's that either appreciate the film overall and don't rate it for the ending, or the people who are naturally dark and appreciate the film for its gothic perspective.  I think the film would have been more appreciated (or less) if it were a little bit longer, the only thing that truly disappointed me was the sword fight at the end, it wasn't nearly long enough as it should have been, almost as if the animators got tired of drawing. and some small feeling nagged me that there was something missing, i haven't seen the magna yet so perhaps if you feel as i do that you can find answers there, as for the happily ever after people, i say take a hike! you want happy?! watch disney!",981849600,,1093,4.400990099009901

The storyline was a little confusing, but in the end, the movie pieced together very well.  I love this movie!",979516800,,369,4.462686567164179
1094220,4,6305951624,"Ok, first off, if you really enjoyed the manga comic of this, you are really going to be dissapointed in this movie. First off, my favorite character, Kakyo, has been replaced with this pony-tail guy named Shugo who controls water. It was hard for Rintaro to direct a movie based on a Manga that hadn't ended yet at the time. But you have to realize that this is the way Rintaro works (just look at Galaxy Express 999). However, he does do a fare job of making the movie. I would of liked to see just one of the dragons of the heaven actually win a battle without commiting suicide. The battles were still terrific and the animation is as beautiful as that of the manga. The dubbing was a little off a times (too noisy). The ending had a little too much hype surrounding it. Through the whole movie, everyone talks about how Kamui and Fuma must fight with both swords. Well, they did get to it, but the battle only lasted about 2 minutes and that was it. At some points in the movie, it seemed real boring, but it explains a lot. This is not a movie for everyone. In fact, some will dislike the movie completely. It's for those who like unhappily ever after movies. There is a 30 minutes sequel to it called X2 (Which really just a music video featuring the earth being destroyed). But don't worry. If you wanted fan service, theres an X series in the works. Anyway, not a movie for everyone, but why don't you pick it up and see if you like it. You might be surprised.",978393600,,1469,4.287769784172662
1094221,4,6305951624,Very stylish but unfortunately the American dubbing and the compression of the plot didn't do justice to this wonderful manga.  It's definetely worth watching if you've read the manga but if you haven't the plot tends to leave the viewer floundering.,974678400,,250,5.097560975609756
1094222,5,6305951624,"i'm a big fan of CLAMP's work, especially X.  so i've read all 15 volumes released so far, know the characters in detail, and came prepared in general to see the movie.  i knew they'd have to sacrifice a lot of the plot to fit the time constraints, and i knew enough to fill in the sketchily-drawn characters.
so i was free to enjoy the epic series of gorgeously rendered battles that unfolded. . .  and able to feel genuinely sad as characters died.  because i felt i understood them, they had meaning to me that they wouldn't have to the casual viewer.
and it didn't matter that the movie didn't stand on its own.  just to see the incredible detail in characters, in backgrounds, in incidental movement was enough reason to watch.  five years after its creation, the movie's artwork still is almost unsurpassed in my opinion.  ^_^
it has severe weaknesses.  it wasn't made for people not already familiar with the characters.  but from where i sit, it's a fabulous movie.",974592000,,973,4.578034682080925

I'm not going to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but those who have will probably agree with me. To me, the ending was quite dissapointing, you feel like ""Gee, all that for nothing."" But other than that, it was a great movie. Fantastic animation, excellent battle scenes, and an awesome storyline, but the ending should have come out differently. But hey, it's still worth it.",974419200,,460,4.554216867469879
1094224,2,6305951624,"This movie is very different from the manga, but it's supposed to be, because the makers wanted to be sure the movie had an ending, even though the manga is yet to be completed. It is very well done taking that into consideration and I found some of the fights scenes intriguing, because they moved slowly. Unlike fight scenes that I'm used to, which are very fast and furious, at least the first fight with Kamui against Nataku and the other man (Gomen, his name escapes me right now) was very slow and had a very strange but very interesting feel to it that I enjoyed a LOT. It can be very depressing, but still is an excellent movie and worth looking into.",973209600,,659,4.365853658536586

I read the manga series first, so i was dissapointed by  the lack of character development, and 2. (WARNING: SPOILER. READ AT YOUR  OWN RISK) EVERYONE dies!!! Either by fighting their opposite number, or by  fuuma. by the end of the movie, Kamui is the only one alive!- but other  than that, it is amazing. Oh, and for those of you who've seen the movie,  but haven't read the manga, the art is the best animation i've ever  seen.... but it doesn't even compare to the manga art.

The  powers unleashed by the characters in this movie are awesome to behold! The  visuals and animation of these powers are  vivid, extremely colorful and  mind boggling!  This movie has scene after scene after scene of  descimation!  But don't get me wrong, this movie also has an intricate plot  and an apocalyptic  undertone that creates a gothic and engrossing  experience like no other anime.  The only area  where this movie falls  short is the ending.  Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil it for you, but  most Japanese anime films leave the viewer with something to think about  (like a moral or a lesson or some mind boggling idea that fries you brain  if you  think about it too hard (i.e. Akira)) but this movie lacks that.  The end kind of leaves the  viewer with a feeling of hanging or a ""so  what"" feeling.  Ohter than that, the animation, the  powers of the  characters, the gothic and engrossing plot and the descimation (crank your  subwoffer if you have one) will leave you speechless!

1094229,1,6305951624,"Pretty pictures.  Yup, lots of pretty pictures.  That earns one star for Clamp's ""X"".  But in all conscience, that's all I can give it  (and that's just 'cause I've had my morning coffee, so I'm in a generous  mood).  What were they THINKING?  I admit, I had my hopes up:  while I'm  not necessarily a huge Clamp fan, I did get a kick out of Clamp School  Detectives.  (Cute vids with interesting characters; I'd recommend you pick  'em up if you haven't already.) I've read a couple of the ""X""  graphic novels, and I was hoping this movie would reflect some of the  story's suspense while providing the audience with a more concise  resolution to the plot.  But nooooooo...... What we get is an awkward,  tangled MESS of real-time and dream-time images that only serve to further  confuse an already complicated storyline.  It's sad, really: some of the  characters had the potential to evolve into interesting, 3-dimensional  personalities... if only Clamp wasn't so dead set on making a few quick  bucks off of some pretty pictures!  You'd almost think they were  American...  Anyway, highly disappointing, and definitely not recommended  by this viewer.  If you're looking for action, beautiful animation,  interesting characters, and a plot you can follow without heavy medication,  try ""Escaflowne"" or ""Rurouni Kenshin"".

7898154,4,6305951624,"A strong example of how awesome anime can be. This full length film based on the manga series of the same name is a lesson ,in arstitic and stylistic mastery.

 I will sum up the plot as a story of light versus dark, basically. I found it intriguing over all, and though the source material ( graphic novels/manga ) is rich with detail and insight into the characters and events, this movie stands on its own as a force to be reckoned with outside of any deeper narrative the manga books offer.

This film clearly shows the hardwork everyone involved put into it, with animation that is truly outstanding. A true study in modern japanese art is what this is, in my humble opinion.

The soundtrack is just excellent. X not only looks top notch, but sounds great as well. And the voice actors ( the English dub ) are all solid in their dilivery and acting abilities. Because this isn't some dumbed down version of the manga, its evident the people behind this took the project seriously and placed great talent behind the scenes.

X, the movie, is a beautifully haunting experience with a good dose of epic battle scenes between the opposing forces. After watching it a multiple times, I only think it lacks something in the category of character development. I want to know more about these characters, and we're given just enough to know whose fighting for what side.

So in no way is X the movie, the beginning and end. It's an open invitation to read the manga, and also watch the X anime series that's also available. But enjoy the movie!",1460764800,,1541,4.5451263537906135
7898155,4,6305951624,This was a pretty cool film. Like most of the people who reviewed this film on this page I do feel the story was rushed and a kill fest. There are a lot of players in this film who you meet and then they are dead. Film goes into the 7 Angels of Heaven v. the 7 angels of earth. One group wants to save the people and the world and the others want to destroy it. Both sides want this one guy that can turn the tide. The movie mostly focuses on  the main guy and friend and the choices they make and how it will affect this war. Reason why I like the movie is because the action is on point. Fights scences and effects were good. Movie you should see but you need to watch X-The series as well. That explains who most of the other players are and they do so much more.
