5791070,2,B00DCRE590,"Started out ok then began to need magic to keep it interesting. These actors must be inbetween good scripts. Do  not advicate magic or story  about witches or pagans to be a good example for children or young people to think they can become healers. Poor taste in subject matter, even for adults.",1382140800,,296,4.566037735849057
5791071,5,B00DCRE590,"I loved this movie. It's one of those movies that the whole family can sit down and enjoy and not just the kids. The writing was great and the actors did a very good job with it. There are a lot of books and movies in this genre, but this one stands above those mostly because it goes beyond the superficial and lets you really get to know the characters and their struggles.",1381363200,20,375,4.1506849315068495
5791072,4,B00DCRE590,This is a nice little coming of age movie about a girl and her family who have special gifts. I happen to like all the stars in the movie and the premise of a heritage of gifts of the spirit was a good movie to curl up to on a cold and cloudy day.,1381104000,25,247,3.5925925925925926
5791073,3,B00DCRE590,"This is a fairly simple story designed to appeal to young teen pagan girls. Rhea (Zosia Mamet) is our teen raised in a pagan family who worship the goddess in all her names. She is starting to develop special powers according to an ancient prophecy... and discover boys.

Zosia Mamet is made to look plain looking to appeal to ugly duckling teen girls. She is about as ""homely"" as Hollywood would dare to go. She goes from being a picked on kid, to one that might save the world, but would really rather go to art school. Her boyfriend Oliver (Sam Underwood) is good looking, understanding, opens up to her, writes poetry about her, and supports her. He is clearly out of her league, but in these pop teen fantasies, life is a romance novel.

In the film there is a celebration area of concentric circles. Concentric circles, circles, mazes, and even string is all part of womb imagery of the goddess with the inner lines representing the umbilical cord. This is true with ancient stories and myths.

The film incorporates big name stars who toil with the pretentious script. The movie struggles to achieve a decent climax. The special effects were minor as one might be able to deduce by looking at the film outtakes on the reverse of the DVD cover.

Not for old guys like me or people who might have a hissy fit about a film showing magic and witchcraft in a good light.

5791075,3,B00DCRE590,"Beautiful scenery, good performances by Dukakis, Quinn, and Madsen, and a family who really love and care about one another are the reason I gave this movie three stars.  The acting by the rest of the cast was barely adequate, the dialogue was poorly written, and the plot had a couple of big holes in it.  I think this movie could have been wonderful if it had focused more on the magical history of the grandmother, mother and daughter and less on teenaged angst.",1379548800,7,465,4.523809523809524

5791090,3,B00DCRE590,"This was an entertaining movie. However, character development and plot development had some holes. We are not told why these are the last keepers or keepers of what exactly. The main character is in one scene telling a guy to stop doing a creepy stalking thing and in the next, for no reason, falling in love with him. The ""prophecy"" in the movie is not fleshed out and we don't know what the fulfiller of the prophecy is supposed to do.

Demonic high school witch girl meets dorky guy and falls in love. He doesn't find it scary or odd that she could move heavy objects with her mind. Typical high school rebellious bull-ish ensues. She starts to act out like a trashy ho and then feels bad about it by the end and accepts that she is the special witch who will birth a special witch spawn that will save the earth from the bad polluting humans... watch at your own risk. You will not get those 2 hours back.,1514851200,,628,4.277310924369748

I guess I'm okay with that. People trying hard to find themselves and help each other. I'm okay with that.

5791113,2,B00DCRE590,Incredibly boring. The plot line fell very flat. It kept feeling like it was building up to something which never came and felt like pieces were missing. Oliver's character was way over the top and essentially unncessary.,1508457600,,221,5.0

5791121,4,B00DCRE590,"This movie was both entertaining and heartwarming as it depicted familial relationships in a family that was very much not traditional in it's beliefs and practices.  All families are unique to varing degrees, and this family was the extreme case.  The bottom line, was that love is the most important aspect of a family, an individual and society; along with the need to take care of our planet and all of nature.

5791123,3,B00DCRE590,"Well made film that clearly suffers from an identity crisis. It's sort of all over the map from a story perspective. It's a family that celebrates pagan earth rituals, but there's also magic involved, but it's also a teen drama, but it's.....oh I give up. The really confusing part of everything is that the cast is outstanding. From the leads to the supporting players, there are some great performers in this, and they do a great job of handling material that really doesn't make sense most of the time. This is coming from an avid fantasy movie watcher so trust me when I say, I am more than willing to check logic at the door. I wish they had just picked a theme and gone with it. My other issue was the ending. It felt extremely abrupt, but I suppose that makes sense because the story didn't seem to know where it was going anyway. Safe movie for the whole family to watch, if you can keep them in front of the tv long enough.",1506816000,2,932,4.331428571428572
5791124,3,B00DCRE590,Thought it was rather dumb and overreaching. Everyone has gifts of one sort or another and the biggest is the ability to love. nothing new or disturbing there. Didn't find it political or offensive. That would be giving this movie way too much credit.,1506816000,,251,4.7272727272727275
5791125,3,B00DCRE590,"This is a cute movie. My wife and I enjoyed it. However, I could easily see it coming; man made global warming propaganda. If you watch this movie you will see it coming, too. They only stay on it for a short period of time, but, liberals being what they are, cant help themselves...they don't miss a chance to try to advance their ideology on the rest of us.

5791128,1,B00DCRE590,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen. While the premise showed a lot of potential for a good modern fantasy, the actual plot left everything to be desired. The characters were stale, the teenage romance was hokey, and the unnecessary slaughter of a baby goat was extremely obscene (and unnecessary). The Last Keepers lacks everything required for good story telling while keeping everything required for being a terrible movie.

5791133,1,B00DCRE590,This movie clearly has an environmental agenda. I also did not like all of the Paganism. Basically the movie is about a girl coming of age and learning that she is a part of a prophecy. It was a bastardization of God choosing Mary to be the mother of Jesus.

The actors were all great and definitely picked well for each part. They did a great job of telling the story. I wish that this would have a sequel. They make sequels out of some of the worst movies but this one actually deserves one. Yes, this story has been told in so many ways but this one felt so natural and not all covered over with fake CGI to sell it. They have enough to do a prequel and a sequel. One that tells of the women's ancestors and how the little girl really did survive and how this new girl goes forward with her new powers.

However, this story had seriously weird pacing, a generic premise, character development that followed what the script called for rather than what made sense, magic and prophecy that was pretty much entirely unnecessary to the plot, and an ending that seemed abrupt and rushed. It's like the writers panicked and had no idea where the plot was going and just gave up.

Four good actors struggled mightily to breathe life into it, but many of the scenes were wooden, the emotions inauthentic, the plot developments abrupt and unbelievable. Save for the first few scenes, Virginia Madsen came across like a commercial for a PMS drug! What a pity.

The cinematography was gorgeous, each scene compose like a painting...but it ended up feeling like a daytime soap, or a made-for-TV movie.

5791305,5,B00DCRE590,"This wasn't well acted & storyline could have been so much richer w/ better writers, but I LOVE that the topic of transpersonal, mysticism, psychic experience is addressed. As someone who had a near death experience (& totally freaked out over being to talk to people ""on the other side"",) it's great to see attempts (even poorly executed) to bring awareness to & cut the scary witch crap. Way time to de-demonize this truly awesome dimension. Too many movies guys. Time to stop feeding the fear & be flippin happy.  Expand your drone-like beliefs & open your heart to POSSIBILITIES!!! It's thrilling. And a hoot. Relaxing the mind relaxes the gut & Belly Laughter Abounds.

Plus, every single one of us is Psychic. It's called Intuition. Only thing missing is Trust.

Topline: If you only believe what you can see & find woo woo weird & just plain dumb - Do Not Watch. If however, you know just bc you can't see, explain or understand it, it would be way arrogant to conclude its not there -- OR POSSIBLE -- Sit back & enjoy the magic of a child's mind.",1433980800,,1054,4.536842105263158

5791337,4,B00DCRE590,"This was a delightful film I was very glad to have seen. I was drawn to it because I am a fan of Olympia Dukakis. Aiden Quinn and Virginia Madsen also are great together.

The story is about a New England family who hold a deep family secret. The mystery unfolds in a way that makes for strong character depth and demonstrates family bonds that oftentimes seem to be lacking and rare nowadays. Some may not like the supernatural tones delved into here but then, if that sort of thing bothers you, this is not a film you will care for. If, on the other hand, you like stories that show familial bonds and sticking together through adversity, you will like this. It is a story about being different and learning to use caution with outsiders and protect those close to you. A common feeling for many young people who feel like an outcast and want to escape who they are by running away.

Zosia Mamet gives a pleasantly surprising good performance. I would have liked to have seen more interaction between Dukakis and Quinn but it was enough to see them perform together. Quinn and Madsen are naturals and give a very touching performance together and a committed and loving couple.

I recommend this movie highly.",1410566400,3,1211,4.571428571428571

Eventually, her mother and grandmother tell her about her heritage, specifically, her maternal lineage. We get to feel her subsequent reaction to the news as she walks the audience through what she's feeling.

The acting is alright, nothing spectacular, mind you, but  it's good enough. In the final analysis, this movie is quite beautiful in a quiet and gentle sort of way, and I'd watch it again.",1397606400,4,706,4.9576271186440675

This is a skewed perspective, and regardless of the charming characters and the hollywood healing, it remains a story to invite the audience to consider that occult powers given to humans will always be good and beneficial, and ignores all the contention and ugliness that accompanies those powers, or the negative after effects.  It was entertaining, and the characters did a good job of portraying their ""gentle personas,"" but witchcraft is a practice that invites evil spirits who abuse and use people for their own ends.

5791352,3,B00DCRE590,"A girl finds enjoys being different. Then she finds out she is different. She does not want to be different. She learns that different is a positive thing. We leave her contemplating her options at being different.

The movie is cute at best. We have a lot of talented contemporary actors such as Olympia Dukakis and Aidan Quinn. There is a plethora of contemporary songs. Lots of nice pictures of the woods. We see some blood and guts but nothing gratuitous.

The program hits us over the head with messages such as tolerating the differences in people and their ways, don't drink and drive, there's time enough for love, be happy with who you are, and be happy in your work.

If you have the opportunity to see it for free it is worth the time spent.

This is a coming of age movie for a young Wiccan girl that is foretold in a prophecy. That is as much of a spoiler as you will get.

This movie is nice, well done and has a peaceful tone to it. I liked all the actors especially the young girl that is the lead actress. She does a fantastic job and seems so perfect for the role.

If you are expecting a bunch of magic and spells, you will be disappointed. There is some magic but it creeps into the young girl's life slowly, It is also about family, young romance, growing up.

Family friendliness: Family friendly as long as the subject matter is ok with your family. There is one animal death scene that I found a bit unsettling. It is brief and may be too much for younger kids. If you want to know where the scene is located, go to the comment section.
