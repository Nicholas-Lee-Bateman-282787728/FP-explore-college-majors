2302854,5,B0009NSE8S,"If you want decent acting, a plot, special effects, or coherent dialogue look elsewhere. This movie has none of that but it does have a huge guy walking around being awesome. The movie is so great I have to take a few years break between watching to calm myself down. Can't wait for the blu-ray!!!",1325635200,7,297,4.418181818181818

2302868,1,B0009NSE8S,Absolutely a garbage of a movie...don't waste your time...just go to sleep,1455580800,,74,5.25
2302869,5,B0009NSE8S,Amazing film. Such masterpieces in life should never go ignored or unrecognized. Every day I battle with my gf on what to watch. And all but last night. We decided to give time barbarian a chance. Mind was blown. Such a creative work of art. All night my gf wanted to pause the film to have hours of coitus. This movie was so well done that my attention couldn't be taken away. Must see for the family.,1455580800,5,402,4.233766233766234
2302870,1,B0009NSE8S,Unbelievably bad. I can't believe Amazon has this in their selections. It doesn't deserve one star.,1455580800,,99,5.25
2302871,2,B0009NSE8S,"Perfect movie for a running dialogue or to make fun of with your friends, so bad its almost good.",1451779200,,97,4.157894736842105
2302872,2,B0009NSE8S,Conan meets late 80's/early 90's fashion in bad areas of LA.  Sorcery & swords with time travel.  Bad acting all around.  Just what you expect from these guys.,1445385600,,159,4.607142857142857
2302873,1,B0009NSE8S,Ugh! Couldn't get through the 1st 5 minutes. Really lowbrow.,1444262400,,60,5.1
2302874,2,B0009NSE8S,"Stupid, stupid and really stupid, although they had incredibly beautiful women, stupid. There was so much potential for a mixture of good fighting sequences ( not the ones in this film) and good story telling even if it wasn't the greatest of plots a simple one would have worked. The acting was atrocious and the direction was worse. This is a horrible movie the only saving grace, so to speak was the beautiful women.",1441670400,,419,4.675675675675675
2302885,1,B0009NSE8S,Not my type of movie,1441238400,,20,3.2
2302886,1,B0009NSE8S,Not worth the time. Too cheesy.,1440892800,,31,4.333333333333333

2302888,2,B0009NSE8S,Wasn't impressed,1440115200,,16,7.5
2302889,4,B0009NSE8S,"I can count # barbarian movies on 3 of my hands, there are not many, this is one of them. McBee, Ayers & crew delivers . solid period piece from Troma Ent",1438992000,,154,3.84375
2302890,2,B0009NSE8S,Worse than any B movie,1438905600,,22,3.6
2302891,1,B0009NSE8S,Could not for the life of me figure out what was going on. Basically terminally confused.,1438819200,,89,4.625
2302892,2,B0009NSE8S,"In TIME BARBARIANS, the warriors of a forgotten age wander the land. Doran (Deron McBee) and Lystra (Joann Ayers) spend their time having deep discussions, while sporting mysteriously clean bodies and perfect hair. Their village is an idyllic wonderland of peace, harmony, and very fun bath time. Unfortunately, a nearby meany-pants named Mandrak (Daniel Martine) has decided to ruin the placid loveliness of it all. He and his odious ogres attack the topless women unawares, causing havoc and much despair. With the women crushed, and their secret amulet stolen, Doran and his faithful sidekick set out to exact vengeance. Many poorly-choreographed sword battles are fought, while Doran miraculously maintains his huge 80s hair. TIME BARBARIANS is TROMA's version of a CONAN clone. As such, it's pretty bad. The ""action"" is sluggish, the story-line is infantile, and the characters are absurd. Things only get worse when The Wizard (Ingrid Vold) appears in a fog bank. She wants her amulet back, and she's mad as hell! We can discern this due to her pout-y histrionics. Of course, she gives Doran a magic sword, he's transported into the far-flung future, and the rest is one silly fight after another. Yep, it's CONAN MEETS TERMINATOR MEETS HIGHLANDER, as Doran arrives to fight street thugs and save reporter, Penny Price (Ayers again). Can Doran find Mandrak and the stolen amulet before The Wizard gets testy? Lovers of this type of movie will probably enjoy this. All others will feel their brains de-wrinkle!...",1437955200,4,1518,5.149797570850202
2302893,4,B0009NSE8S,Fun movie,1436054400,,9,4.0
2302894,4,B0009NSE8S,"first thing's first, for a HUGE chunk of this movie the right audio track is all of the dialogue, the left audio is simply foley sounds, grunting and music. for the rest of the movie, it seems that these tasks are swapped where the right audio is foley, music & grunting while left takes on dialogue.

this makes the movie even MORE hilarious... just amazing fun.

the rest of the movie?  total sword and muscle crap fest, and i love it.",1412380800,2,437,4.37037037037037
8063618,3,B0009NSE8S,It's an okay movie though the sound quality is god awful.,1503100800,,57,4.2727272727272725
8063619,4,B0009NSE8S,"I wish Deron McBee had made many more superhero/muscleman movies....he was much better than some who took the parts (Kellan Lutz, etc.)",1502841600,,135,5.181818181818182
8063620,3,B0009NSE8S,"The best thing about this film is the presence of Timothy O'Sullivan, who is a great classical actor.  he is also a great opera singer, who could have created a titanic Conan figure.",1496102400,,182,4.515151515151516
8063621,3,B0009NSE8S,"A low budget knock-off of Conan the Barbarian and He-man: Masters of the Universe. Though not the worst Iv'e scene it's not the best either. We saw plenty of virility, boobs, poor acting and a few special effects but, that was it. Some of the lines were pretty good. for example- Doran says this after the three gang bangers whip out their switchblades. ""Your swords match your manhoods."" then he pulls out his claymore. Dad and I laughed.
In short; I gave it three stars solely because it was as entertaining as it was cheesy.

If you're into B-movies it's worth watching; if not...don't.",1483401600,2,589,4.663461538461538
8063622,1,B0009NSE8S,Terrible.,1483401600,,9,9.0
8063623,4,B0009NSE8S,Kind of fun to see the genre again. Has an extended boobage scene,1473552000,,65,4.076923076923077
8063624,1,B0009NSE8S,"When the movie writers can't even spell 'sorcery' correctly in the scrolling introduction...  About every achievable flaw in film making is represented in 'Time Barbarians'.  Acting, dialogue, continuity, direction, sound track; you name it, it's bad. About the only feature that might appeal to some viewers is scantily clad young women doing strenuous things.  In that case I suggest watching women's beach volleyball. Real action, solid eye candy, and no dopey dialogue.",1473206400,,473,5.541666666666667

Dramatic score, loin cloths, 80's feathered hair, topless chicks fighting with swords, muscles, sweet kicks to the face, special effects, revenge, beards, severed limbs, i could go on and that's just the first forty minutes.  Imagine had i paid attention to the rest of the movie!",1464134400,,308,5.14
