8209754,5,B000TJBN8A,I'm so glad to finally watch a movie where you don't know who will make it out alive in part 2. Both movies were good though and does not disappoint.,1417478400,,149,4.0
8209755,3,B000TJBN8A,A good horror double feature but nothing great still a must for gore hounds,1417046400,,75,4.428571428571429
8209756,5,B000TJBN8A,The original Wrong Turn is worth the price alone son it is as if your are getting Wrong Turn 2 free. That being said Wrong Turn 2 is not very good.,1360281600,,147,3.774193548387097
8209757,4,B000TJBN8A,"I usually hate writing reviews because I don't wanna force my opinion on others, but the rating on these movies is so unfair I had to do it. In an age where remakes are running rampant and PG-13 is the standard (the awful Prom Night remake for starts) it's nice to look back a few years and watch a nice R rated horror flick for adults and not stupid tweeners like Wrong Turn.

Is it new? No. Is it the greatest ever? No. Is it fun, enjoyable, and stands up to repeated viewings? I think so. Sure, Eliza Dushku is running around in a tight white tanktop and that's worth noting, but the movie is slick in its execution, at times suspenseful, and has some meaningful deaths in it (as well as one great ""surprise!"" death).

Part 2 isn't as good, but it's by far the best Direct-To-DVD horror flick I've seen. It's really silly in the beginning, but it's so enjoyable I can't help but love it. There's even a nice little ""Father/Son"" moment between the mutant killers where the dad lets his killer mutant son score a kill to make his mutant papa proud. There's also a nice bit of confusion about who the Final Girl is that I thought was a nice surprise. And then there's Henry Rollins, who always owns whatever role he plays.

Both movies are worth watching and worth buying especially if you can get them for a good price.",1245024000,,1320,4.357723577235772
8209758,4,B000TJBN8A,"im a huge fan of the original wrong turn, and the sequal is way better, one of the best dtdvd horror movies recently, not as good as hatchet but better than wrestlemaniac( pretty fun b-movie) if u like horror comedies, b-horror and good gore def. for u ( look for the greatest/most bloody cutaway death in the beginning of the movie!)",1205280000,,334,4.491803278688525
8209759,1,B000TJBN8A,"Compared to Wrong Turn 1, I thought this movie was terrible. It seemed like the writers just threw it together. Then when the nudity was put in, I knew the movie was going to be bad.",1196380800,2,182,4.083333333333333
