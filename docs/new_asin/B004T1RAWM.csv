4465120,4,B004T1RAWM,Must Watch like Gasland it is very informative about how Gas & Oil companies don't care what or who they kill or injure,1402099200,,119,4.217391304347826
4465121,5,B004T1RAWM,"This video reveals the greed, ignorance, and stupidity of industry and politicians.
Raping the planet so that a couple generations can live like there is no tomorrow.
The damage we are doing to our Planet is soooo sad.
If only people can become passionate about Mother Earth, as they are about the Kardashians?",1370908800,,310,4.867924528301887
4465122,5,B004T1RAWM,"This can happen to anyone living in the west, before you buy real estate, check to see if you own your mineral rights!",1363564800,2,118,4.173913043478261
4465123,4,B004T1RAWM,"Arrived quickly. Well written  on a topic that everyone should learn more about.
We showed it to 2 groups of friends already.",1354233600,,125,4.681818181818182
4465124,5,B004T1RAWM,"Split Estate is an in-depth look at the legal issues individual homeowners face with respect to the oil/gas industry's rapacious pursuit of natural gas by hydraulic fracturing (or ""fracking"").  It puts a face on the toxic legacy on a problem threatening almost every state, Europe and the world.",1353369600,,295,5.145833333333333
4465125,4,B004T1RAWM,"The title of the 2009 documentary SPLIT ESTATE is explained on the film's web site:  ""The concept of Split Estate dates back to English law, which reserved the mineral rights of all land, public and private to the king. Over time, Split Estate has come to be defined as a situation in which a property owner is not the same party who owns the rights to extract minerals from underneath the property.""

Nothing's changed over time, though, except who rules as king.  Back then determined by birth, today kings are the corporations the United States government serves.  As we see in SPLIT ESTATE, that royalty is the oil and gas industry, which through the ""Halliburton Loophole"" of the Safe Drinking Water Act legally mines - and pollutes - land literally next door to private homes in Colorado and other rural area, destroying both the health of locals and the value of their properties.

Ah, the Bush-Cheney legacy.  F.D.R. may have left us with those post office murals, but George W. Bush leaves behind benzene contamination.  In service to the people, in service to the kings, respectively.

I live in New Jersey, the subject of Colorado Senator Gary Hart's joke about toxic waste when he was running for president in 1984.  Today, Gary Hart would not have to look east to crack pollution jokes.

See SPLIT ESTATE.  I've heard of scratching the surface, but in Colorado that's come to mean the land you thought you owned is only as deep as the topsoil.",1349481600,2,1456,4.738095238095238
4465126,5,B004T1RAWM,"I have many concerns about hydrofracking. This documentary addressed many of them, and even ones I hadn't considered.

Its hard to make informed decisions about fracking when we only hear the ""big corperations"" side about the pro's of fracking.  This documentary gives a voice to many people who were in a town where fracking took place. You get to hear their ""real life experiences"". Some of which are very troubling...

A must see documentary if fracking is getting close to your town.",1345161600,4,487,4.914634146341464
4465127,3,B004T1RAWM,"The disastrous results of big oil and gas invading Colorado in the 90's are documented here. The industry had every right to do what they did, and now everyone is surprised that public safety and cleaner ways of doing things got in the way of profits. Lets all vote to build a pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast next; it creates jobs and only later will probably screw up a few lives and environments. Surely we can count on these large corporations to be fair, honest and careful the next time.",1340928000,4,499,4.434782608695652
4465128,5,B004T1RAWM,"This is a must see for everyone,it is abit inteimdating to know the truth but we must all open our eyes. The seller was very professional and sent the product straight out.",1330387200,4,172,4.40625
4465129,5,B004T1RAWM,"I am involved in the anti-fracking movement in our area.  Have shared this with
a group and they were moved to understanding and action.  There is no way to
fake these moving scenes of sick people, bubbles on fire, etc.
A great companion piece to Gasland.  This one focuses a bit more on health.
Highly recommended.",1316908800,9,315,4.589285714285714

8440443,5,B004T1RAWM,"Disturbing must watch journalism about the impact of fracking on, primarily, western Colorado. This should be a calling to the people to demand their rights back despite the lack of response by the elected representative class.",1461888000,,227,5.333333333333333

8440447,5,B004T1RAWM,"Wonderfully explicit, truthful and troubling.  How is this going on in our backyards?!
I hope this documentary gives this very serious issue the voice it deserves.",1433721600,,163,5.269230769230769
8440448,5,B004T1RAWM,"Anyone that thinks hydraulic fracturing is a good idea should be required/forced to watch 'Split Estate'.  While watching, they should be supplied with ample amounts of water that has come from a well or other source that has been polluted by the 'fracking' process and forced too drink at least two pints of that water.",1408924800,,320,4.818181818181818
