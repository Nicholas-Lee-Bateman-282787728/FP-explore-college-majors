2045935,5,B0001Z4P6O,"I just got the DVD version and looked at the first two episodes this evening.  It is as good as I expected it to be, from what I had heard.  I see that the tone of the Steve Martin film was very similar to the original version.  The actresses in the latter were obviously chosen to resemble those in the television series. Bob Hoskins has ""Got That Certain Something"" that nobody could imitate, lower keyed but just as fanatical and delusional as Martin.  I was a fan of the movie and of course the television series is even better.  Just don't expect to see another version of ""Singing In the Rain!""",1091836800,12,600,4.36936936936937
2045936,5,B0001Z4P6O,"Fabulous.  Magnificent.  How impoverished we Yanks have been, not to have known this series before.",1091836800,8,99,5.533333333333333
2045937,5,B0001Z4P6O,"Late 1970s Britain was not particularly accustomed to campaigning graffiti, but in 1978, there was an explosion of slogans on railway bridges etc declaring that 'George Davies is Innocent!' It says something for the power of this TV series that a few wags wrote 'The Accordion Man is innocent!' in public places.
(For those unaware of the plot, the accordion man is a key character in this six-episode series. When a blind girl is raped and murdered on the road to Gloucester -- the plot was conceived long before the Fred West crimes, by the way -- the accordion man is the principal suspect. Another suspect is the music salesman Arthur Parker, who we know to be a liar, cheat and two-timer with slightly unusual fetishes.)
If you haven't seen this series before, you'll be startled by the lip-synching. On several occasions each episode, at the end of a dramatic piece of dialogue, the lighting will suddenly change, and the characters will start to mime and dance to a piece of 1920s/1930s music. When the song is finished, the characters return to precisely where they were before the musical interruption. It's a strange device -- quite different from conventional musicals or operas -- but extremely powerful in showing how music transports people to another world. Tolkien uses a ring to transport Frodo to another world, Pullman uses the Subtle Knife to transport Lyra, and Dennis Potter uses song. There is a very powerful speech in episode #2 where Bob Hoskins, playing Arthur, describes the impact of love and song as ""pennies from heaven"", very much as a religious experience.
For me, this is Potter's masterpiece. It's less polished than the Singing Detective, but I think that this helps to frame the principal issues of love, sex, death, music and spirituality more starkly. Many of the settings come from Potter's own experience -- the Forest of Dean, the village schoolroom etc.
There are two very beautiful actresses in this production -- Cheryl Campbell and Gemma Craven -- and it's difficult to convey the shock created in 1978 by the scene in which Craven bears her rouged nipples. (Previously she had been known only for appearing in the children's film of Cinderella, and she played her Potter character in a very child-like way until this scene.) It's all very tame now, but the scene still has some power, provided you can overcome any disbelief that the Craven character would ever marry Hoskins!
The 3-DVD set comes with precious few extras -- just a photo gallery and a commentary on episodes #1 and #6 -- and as you would expect, the production is in a 4x3 frame and monaural. Picture quality is cleaned-up 70s standard, and the sound quality is OK. Many of the records that the characters mime to are presented with all their scratches. (Curiously these scratches aren't so audible on the 2-CD collection that used to accompany the series.)
This is a fantastic series, but I don't pretend that it's for everyone. It comes from an era when TV playwrights aimed to produce more than just entertainment.
George Davies, by the way, may have been innocent of whatever he was originally jailed for. But he was back in prison several years later on a totally separate conviction that people didn't seem to dispute.
As for the Accordion Man, well ... you'll just have to watch the series!
From his early days, Dennis Potter was obsessed by the nature of the religious experience, particularly the Christian version. The black and white 'Son of Man' play for the BBC examined the earthly life of Jesus. 'Brimstone and Treacle' examined the possibilities when the Devil visits one home.
'Pennies from Heaven' took elements from the gospel story and mixed it with a Bonnie and Clyde story of a man and his lover on the run. Thus Arthur Parker tries to evangelise the world with his musical message -- he gets very few takers, at least initially. In the end, he is tried by a Pilate-like figure and executed for a crime he didn't commit. Having been hanged, he then appears to the Mary Magdalene figure (Cheryl Campbell playing a prostitute). The analogy falls down with the Accordion Man, a key character in the play who has no direct biblical equivalent -- although he may be a Judas Iscariot figure who, burdened with guilt, commits suicide. But the most heretical aspect of this analogy is that Arthur Parker as a Christ figure is such a duplicitous liar and cheat.
The casting in this magnificent production is excellent. The part seemed tailor-made for Bob Hoskins, and it's hard to imagine Steve Martin playing this role in the American film version. The two leading ladies are outstanding: Cheryl Campbell a superb actress whose dancing improved immensely, and Gemma Craven a great dancer whose acting ability surprised many critics at the time.
I don't doubt that this is one of the most important musicals yet made, and along with 'The Singing Detective', it's a fitting tribute to the genius of Dennis Potter. Just before the hanging in the final episode, there's a hint that pennies from heaven are nothing more than the arc of urine created by schoolboys competing to see who can aim highest. That at the very last gasp Potter tries to trivialise the entire concept with this joke is a mark of his mastery of the dramatic form.",1086480000,98,5259,4.81858407079646
2045964,5,B0001Z4P6O,"Much like Steambath (previously reviewed) Pennies from Heaven with Bob Hoskins is like running into another old friend.  I really like the transistion into song and dance that seem relevant for scene and action.  The story line is plausible, though it reminds me of the transistions from old movies that had Busby Berkley dance numbers woven into them - a stretch sometimes but enjoyable none the less.  I would not watch it all at once.  Pace yourself and see one episode per day - don't want to OD on cake.",1402531200,2,508,4.611111111111111

2045968,4,B0001Z4P6O,"The most notable and poignant thing about Pennies from Heaven is the big crack that runs through it.

Parts 1 through 3, and most of 4, are absorbing, haunting, original, unforgettable. But the breaking of the records signals the exit of Potter's muse. Parts 5 and 6 are banal, cliched and superficial. I wish I knew what happened.

I also wish I knew why the words ""Cheryl Campbell"" appear nowhere on or in the packaging of this DVD set. A strange omission, since she is the best thing in the show. Are you reading this, Cheryl? You sent me where the pennies come from.

It is a little slow at times and requires some patience to see it through. But the mixture of fantasy and cynical realism is utterly unique and fascinating. The series was shot at least partially on video and the lighting is often flat. It doesn't look nearly as good as the even older series ""The Prisoner"". But technical shortcomings aside, the series is so impressive creatively that I could overlook this.

I would recommend another Potter series ""The Singing Detective"" rather than ""Pennies"" for an introduction to Potter's work.",1356480000,2,666,4.893805309734513

2046007,4,B0001Z4P6O,"Dennis Potter is perhaps not a household name in the US, despite notable successes like his two landmark miniseries, namely Pennies From Heaven ($49.98; BBC Video) and The Singing Detective ($39.98; BBC Video). But he towered over the UK TV industry with the combined genius of, say, Steven Bochco, David Lynch and Joss Whedon. In fact, his last work was shown by both the BBC and Channel 4, which is like ABC and FOX airing the same TV movie, which is unimaginable. Despite overwhelming acclaim, far too few of his films have been seen here. So I'm chomping at the bit to watch Dennis Potter: 3 To Remember ($39.98; Koch), which contains three TV films shown on consecutive weekends in 1980. Stars include Donald Pleasance, Peggy Ashcroft and Denholm Elliott. But I doubt any of them will equal the extra included: the riveting final interview with Potter that aired on Channel 4 in 1994 just three months before his death, with the deeply ill Potter literally drinking a morphine cocktail while talking about his life and work and desire to finish one final teleplay before he died.

2046008,5,B0001Z4P6O,"If you like psychological drama and music from the 1930's and 1940's, then you will love The Singing Detective.  It never got much air play in the United States but was quite popular in England.  The story takes place in a hospital ward and there are frequent flashbacks to the author's childhood and frequent forays into the writer's imaginative world.  There is a brilliant blurring of fantasy and reality that keeps you guessing about the outcome right to the end.  This was a miniseries so it is over six hours long but worth every minute.

We have yet to watch Pennies from Heaven but expect it to be good too.",1221436800,,615,4.554545454545455

I'm a fan of the period music which forms the soundtrack, so perhaps that prejudices me, but I think that, even if you don't know much about hot dance music of the '30's, you'll find yourself loving it very soon.  The concept of the series is quirky, but it doesn't take long to find yourself mesmerized by the stunningly drawn characters, the dark plot line, the amazing production values and.....the music.  It may be one of those things that you're passionately for or against, I'm firmly in the former category and would recommend this piece highly.",1217635200,4,630,4.709090909090909
2046010,5,B0001Z4P6O,"A long time ago, television stations would take great chances and produce TV that was intelligent, thought provoking, and profound.  This is one of those examples.  Dennis Potter's Pennies from Heaven is one of the greatest TV miniseries ever made.  While not as good as The Singing Detective (which is Potter's masterpiece), this is still magnificent and worth investing all 7 hours or so.  This is far superior to the film version.  The film isn't terrible, but taking a 7 hour miniseries and condensing into a 108 minute is a big mistake.  The characters' motivation in the film version is questionable, because they've taken out big chunks of story.  But we're here to review the miniseries, not the misguided film version.

The performances here are absolutely first rate, from Hoskins and Campbell, to Kenneth Colley as The Accordion Man, to Freddie Jones as a headmaster, and Hywel Bennett as a deeply cynical, cruel man who uses Campbell.  The miniseries has a rather disturbing tone to it for many reasons.  The songs that Potter uses are the cheery songs of the depression, which were in major contrast to what was really happening.  The songs are at first quite jarrring, but soon you get used to it, and realise it's a great narrative device.  Hoskins plays a sexual obsessive man who feels neglected at home, and the language is rather frank for its time.  The miniseries features an abortion, prostitution, murder, and just plain old fashioned cruelty of life.  One of the most memorable scenes is the farewell that Freddie Jones gives to Cheryl Campbell in the film.  Campbell teaches at a rural school, and she becomes pregnant by Hoskins.  Jones learns of this, but instead of doing a Puritannical thing on her, he is quite moving in his speech to her, realising that he cannot have her teaching at the school, despite the fact that he knows she's really a beautiful woman and a gentle soul who just made a stupid mistake.  The miniseries takes the viewer on quite a journey, and it's really one of the most unique experiences in TV ever made.  Potter was as much an auteur as any director, and he was one of the greatest teleplay writers the U.K. ever produced.  This and The Singing Detective are his legacy, and it's a great one.",1193875200,5,2249,4.75
2046011,5,B0001Z4P6O,"I've been looking for this series on DVD for YEARS!  It's finally available, and it was definitely worth the wait.  Dark, poignant, and funny all at the same time, this series uses poopular music from the 20s and 30s -- often inappropriately -- to express the inner heart of the characters.  A young Bob Hoskins plays the lead: a sleezy traveling salesman who is hard to love, except that he does such a wonderful job of playing this character.  Writer Dennis Potter is at the top of his form.",1179273600,2,493,4.50561797752809
2046012,5,B0001Z4P6O,"Great acting, great soundtrack, great reissue.  God, if only there were another mini-series in the world like this.  It's better than you can imagine.",1171756800,9,150,5.208333333333333
2046013,5,B0001Z4P6O,"This decidedly different 'musical' ain't gonna be to all tastes--but if you appreciate a genuinely offbeat concept superbly realised by a first-rate cast, this is for you.

The principals, Bob Hoskins (as the loutish, megalomaniac Arthur Parker), Cheryl Crawford (as the at first winsome, then increasingly hard-boiled Eileen) and Gemma Craven (the hapless and resentful Joan) couldn't be better cast. The bizaare stylisations of the lip-synched musical numbers look positively effortless as handled by them. One can hardly imagine American actors being able to handle this kind of material with their level of ease and versatility.

For me, the real test of this type of production isn't simply how well the leads carry it off--the secondary actors have to be equally good, or the whole thing comes apart. In this respect, especially, ""Pennies"" excels. Among the most notable of the supporting cast are two British character actors whose work I've admired for years, and who are sadly largely unknown to most audiences in this country. Hywel Bennett as Tom, a sleazy, yet oddly attractive pimp, brings the perfect aura of guttersnipe sexiness and low-bred self assurance to the part. He also, without ever once doing or saying anything overt, convinces the viewer that his character is a menacingly nasty bit of work--it's not at all hard to believe that Eileen would take it on the lam with Arthur rather than risk facing Tom once she's reneged on her deal with him. But for me, the most touching performance comes from the marvelous Freddie Jones, as the headmaster of the school where Eileen teaches. Initially introduced in a manner that suggests a typically English comic Dickensian villain, he transcends the viewer's expectations by being revealed as one of the few--possibly the only--decent characters in this story. Forced to dismiss Eileen over a compromising circumstance that has become known to the school's directors, he shows the sadness of his own disillusionment that has pushed him to treat his young charges with a certain brutality; and in a moment of beautifully underplayed pathos, almost inadvertently reveals his love for Eileen--a love he is well aware she could never(for any number of reasons) reciprocate. All he can do is offer her enough money to help her leave and re-establish herself elsewhere, and wish her good luck. As with Bennett, it's what's left unsaid and underplayed that makes his Headmaster Warner so painfully convincing.

And there are any number of other small gems of performance; Ronald Fraser as a Blimpish member of Parliament who proves himself to be a lot cannier at the blackmail game than the hapless Eileen and Arthur is among the most notable. I can't think of a single poor performance by anyone in the cast--and in a cast of this size, that's no small feat.

If you can get past the initial oddity of the concept, and if you're a fan of truly top-notch, fully realised acting --as opposed to the average histrionics that pass for acting in most American television performances--this strange (and strangely compelling) series is one you will not want to miss.",1170374400,15,3120,5.06420233463035
2046054,5,B0001Z4P6O,"The late Dennis Potter's writing (as it was in The Singing Detective) is both intelligent and searing.  The characters are heartbreakers and the acting, especially by Bob Hoskins and Kenneth Colley is peerless.  This is what television could and should be, but almost never is.  Compare this to the abominable remake with Steve Martin.  Hail Britannia!",1168300800,5,352,5.232142857142857
2046055,5,B0001Z4P6O,"In 1979 Margaret Thatcher was elected prime minister of the British parliament, she had in her sights reform of many institutions, the coal miners were one and the British Broadcasting Corporation was another, throughout the 1980's various Director-Generals came and went and so did a lot of creative programming staff, deals that were once concluded on a handshake would eventually need a committee to close. I only mention this because some might argue that the heydays of British television resided in the 1970's, if one needed any proof of this you could do no better as an example than the BBC's production of Dennis Potter's drama  ""Pennies From Heaven"" a six part serial or what would now be termed a mini series, it contained many innovating set pieces whereby the cast would mime to records of the 1930's period that had been especially chosen to be cued into the soundtrack to enhance the plot, I think it would be fair to say that nothing quite like it had been seen before (or since for that matter,) Starring Bob Hoskins working as a sheet music salesman between the first and second world wars who fantasizes about the songs that he sells and through his infidelity gets caught up in events that eventually overtake him. If  ""Pennies"" were being made today no doubt it would be ""cut"" a little tighter but the production values and originality still hold up well. Bob Hoskins shot to fame after this and indeed he was quite brilliant as the main protagonist winning a BAFTA nomination for his role as Arthur Parker, In its year of broadcast, ""Pennies"" won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Award for Most Original Programme, leading lady Cheryl Campbell who was also BAFTA nominated for her roll as Eileen Everson and Gemma Craven playing Hoskins wife were both superb as was the direction of Piers Haggard a BAFTA winner, however one of the main ingredients and stars of this serial was the choreographer Tudor Davies, who created wonders in one confined space after another.

I sold sheet music myself during the period ""Pennies"" was made but one can only imagine the business before television when most people had a piano in their front room and writing songs was still an art.

In it's usual brutish way Hollywood having made a flop movie of ""Pennies"" in 1981 supressed this BBC version for ten years, this reminded me of similar antics in the 1940's when a studio in tinsel town having remade the film Gaslight in 1944 attempted to have all prints of the previous British version of Gaslight (1940) destroyed. These efforts were eventually unsuccessful, though the film was rarely seen for several decades, don't you just admire their business ethics?

But I digress; ""Pennies From Heaven"" at almost eight hours long means you are going to need more than a few buckets of popcorn plus a case or two of beer, a personal unexpected bonus for me was how I grew to admire the early recordings used in ""Pennies"" in fact I bought the double soundtrack album on CD it's a real treat. The BBC have recorded a commentary with the director Piers Haggard and producer Kenith Trodd on episodes one and six which I found to be very interesting, from a technical point of view regarding resolution, I do wish the BBC would have used 35 millimeter film instead of their usual choice 16 mill for their external shots, also from time to time the sound levels appeared to be somewhat uneven on my DVD, having said that this should not spoil your enjoyment of what I consider to be a real gem and probably the most original programme ever to come out of British television.",1153526400,8,3587,4.71451355661882
2046056,5,B0001Z4P6O,"This is largely a response to Gavin Wilson.  Is it possible that Arthur did kill the blind girl?  I can't remember the timing of his visit to the music shop, his encounter with the blind girl, and his return to the spot where he met her the first time.  But if he did, then I would suggest that a Christian framework would indicate Arthur as Adam---Everyman--- and The Accordian Man as the Christ, freely taking Arthur's sin upon himself in death.  And that Arthur is tried and hanged as people sometimes (wrongly or rightly) are, and then resurrected because of---what? His ability to love?  His hope?  God's love for him?  Who knows.  And how would this relate to Rapunzel?  The Accordian Man doesn't seem to fit into Rapunzel.",1142294400,2,729,4.6328125
2046057,5,B0001Z4P6O,"By the time Pennies From Heaven was first broadcast in the spring of 1978, writer Dennis Potter - the enfant-terrible of British televisual drama - had already attracted a fair share of positive and negative criticism for his preceding works, Moonlight on the Highway, Double Dare and Casanova.  This troika of bleak works, all of which were deeply self-referential and used the subtext of popular songs as an underpinning for the dark themes lurking beneath the polite veneer of normality, would very much define the style and concept of Pennies From Heaven, with Potter being awarded a greater degree of control over his material for the first time, following the success of the three plays listed above and, of course, the mass tabloid controversy surrounding his previous piece, Brimstone & Treacle.  Despite the greatness of those plays (Double Dare and Brimstone & Treacle in particular), it is safe to say that 'Pennies...' was a definite turning point for Potter, and a work of unbridled and undiluted creativity that would go into the creation of later classics like The Singing Detective, Black Eyes, or the earlier hit, Blue Remembered Hills.

The plot, as covered in more detail by other reviewers, seems fairly simplistic.  Arthur, a amiable working-class Cockney, is trapped in a sexless marriage with staunched middle-class wife Joan, works long hours as a travelling sheet-music salesman, partakes of the occasional affair and, indulges himself in bouts of wild exaggeration amongst the other familiar-faced salesmen that he meets on his weekly rounds.  For Arthur, this isn't just a job, but also an escape (both literal - in the sense that it gets him out of the house and away from the watchful eyes of polite society - and metaphoric, also), as he takes solace in the words and music of the romantic ballads that he foists upon local music shop stockists for the odd bob or too.  The way in which Potter uses the songs and the way in which they have been integrated into the action is superb, and still seems revolutionary some twenty-six years after the programme's initial conception, as that opening scene, in which Arthur gazes wistfully into the bathroom mirror before suddenly breaking into song - or maybe not - as the rough and very much manly Arthur is merely lip-synching to some heartbreaking ode sung by some delicate young woman!!  This first instance of musical underpinning, as Potter not only hints at Arthur's state of mind through the contemplative lyrics, but also hints at a deeper fragility and sensitivity that is often lost in the pursuit of ladish bravado, is still one of the most astounding TV moments, with Potter and director Piers Haggard setting a scene that is surreal, fanciful and fabricated, but also overflowing with pain, angst, longing and degradation.

It is important for us to remember that Arthur, although out of step with the repressed, stiff-upper-lipped society in which he inhabits, is a creature desperate for love and physical understanding.  His actions throughout the series might suggest otherwise (the frustration, sexual tension and occasional bouts of misogyny), he nonetheless is capable of moments of real warmth and tenderness, which is best illustrated in his growing relationship with Eileen as the story progresses.  Although very much about Arthur and his journey, Potter also offers us two very complex female characters with Joan, Arthur's prim and proper wife of traditional middle-class values, and Eileen, the nave yet passionate schoolteacher from the sheltered reaches of the forest of Dean (a continual point of influence in Potter's work).  Both women love Arthur despite his actions and the reactions of those around him, and yet, we are left questioning throughout as to whether or not Arthur is the mind-mannered, though sexually frustrated dreamer we originally though, or if he is, perhaps, something much darker, and more predatory?

It would be wrong to go into any greater detail regarding the deeper implications of the plot... not least for those who've yet to see the programme, but also, because I'm not entirely sure I've grasped everything that Potter was getting at.  Like his later masterpiece The Singing Detective, Pennies From Heaven is a series that works on multiple levels.  On the one hand, it's a character piece... a journey for the character tied neatly into a format that has an almost ""road-movie"" quality to it.  On top of that, it's a morality story... a play on the notion of fidelity and infidelity, love and lust, longing and perversion.  On top of this we have a police story blurred by elements of self-referentialism... and then we have the music.  The music is perfectly chosen, not only fitting the mood of the scene that it accompanies, but also revealing more about the characters and their situations through the lyrics and the tone of the singer's delivery.  Sometimes the use of music can be comedic (or, darkly comedic), like, for example, in The Bad Man number, or it can be quite sinister... like the piece with the accordion man in the homeless shelter.  More often, however, it evokes the sadness and longing at the heart of the characters.

The choreography, lighting, design and direction is impeccable throughout, with the crew using the limitation of having to combine studio filming and location filming to their advantage, by further juxtaposing the real with the bizarre.  Although it's not as great as the Singing Detective, Pennies From Heaven is no less a work of genius.  Though at times it can be quite frustrating, it is, nonetheless, a series that benefits greatly from multiple viewings, with each new viewing revealing a further interpretations that we may have missed before.  The performances from the three leads are all great and help to carry the emotional weight of the project well (special mention to the supporting actors, dancers and technicians too) although it's Bob Hoskins lead performances as the complicated Arthur that is the real draw.  Like most of the work of Dennis Potter, Pennies From Heaven is a rich and complex musical parable that has stood the test of time perfectly.",1136764800,9,6149,5.047384007897334
2046058,5,B0001Z4P6O,Everything Bob Hoskins does is briliant and this is no exception. I have never seen the American movie because I knew no one could possibly play a part correctly after Bob Hoskins. I have waited 17 years (that was the first time I was even made aware of the BBC mini series) to see this and it was well worth the wait.,1111622400,8,318,4.145161290322581
2046059,5,B0001Z4P6O,"Don't waste your time on the Steve Martin movie version, which is a simplified, bowlderised version re-worked for 'American tastes'.

Watch this BBC mini-series which is a British television masterpiece. OK, it will not appeal to all, but if you fancy something completely original, superbly produced and performed,

and with a unique and very British 1930s atmosphere, this is for you ! This was the series that made Bob Hoskins a major star, and launched his movie career, and he is superb! Intelligent viewers will love it - idiots won't !",1105401600,11,542,4.945054945054945
2046060,5,B0001Z4P6O,"Comparing Bob Hoskins to Steve Martin as Arthur in 'Pennies From Heaven' is like comparing Champagne to Lemonade or Caviar to Cod's Roe. This production is atmospheric accuracy compared to Hollywood hyperbole. It is the original version of Dennis Potters masterpiece and everything about it soars miles above any television drama I've seen for years in terms of production values and pure entertainment. The casting, the acting, the choreography, the photography, the lighting, the dubbing, the editing and above all the directing of Piers Haggard represent a rare coming together of absolutely pure professionalism. It is a shining example of that elusive quality which helped to make the BBC the envy of the world in the 1970's.

It is long but you don't have to watch it all at one sitting. Treat yourself to a seven-course feast over a few days or weeks while Potter serves up this glorious vintage wine!",1105315200,22,908,5.013245033112582
2046061,5,B0001Z4P6O,"Viewers who compare ""The Singing Detective"" to ""Pennies from Heaven"" are missing a point: ""Pennies"" is much earlier, written at a time when Potter was turning from conventional stage plays to the experimental, multi-part and mixed-genre mode that others came to call ""Telly Novels."" He invents this form in ""Pennies"" and refines it further in ""The Singing Detective,"" which is undeniably his masterpiece. Viewing ""Pennies"" is like reading an early Dickens novel, before you tackle ""Bleak House.""

The choice of a story that has a tragi-comic arc to it is appropriate, considering the fact that it's about the Depression, which hit the UK even harder than it did the USA. Arthur is the eternal dreamer, and note that much of his cheesy idealism stems from his affection for American, Tin-Pan Alley, schmaltzy music. I mean, his favorite song is ""Roll On, Prairie Moon,"" and folks, there are no prairies in England! So we have to consider that American consumerism and pop culture are part of the satiric target here, as they should be.

I don't understand the compaints about Bob Hoskins or Cheryl Campbell; in my view they are well-cast and very talented throughout. It could be that their features and body-types don't appeal to American viewers used to seeing surgically-perfected faces and physiques; but to me they were absolutely right in appearance, manner, and performing style.

The other element in ""Pennies"" that is so interesting to a Potter fan is his use of autobiographical reference: The Forest of Dean, on the border between England and Wales, is where he grew up; and several of the characters are renditions of people he knew, sources that complement his story-telling method, to develop several threads of action/character and then cut between then, very much like a novel.

Finally, the use of song/dance as a counterpoint to the drama is brilliantly satirical, somewhat in the style of Brecht, but those sequences are not supposed to be smooth musical stage comedy; they are amateurs imitating pros and not for the sake of entertainment, but to point out how hollow all the sentimentality is, given the banality and emptiness of their daily lives.

I am buying the DVD because its price is 1/3rd what I paid a VHS bootlegger a year ago for 6 tapes of the series. At the time, that was the only way ""Pennies"" was available. Now the BBC has re-issued it in a more permanent format, and if the transfer is a little muddy, that's because the master tapes are 25 years old and BBC apparently could not afford the expense of a digital cleansing.

Even so, this is a high-quality television classic and a collector's item, and I hope potential buyers will not be turned away by the not-very informed reviews already posted.",1095292800,54,2737,4.9006479481641465
2046062,2,B0001Z4P6O,"As one of the previous reviewers notes, this is not the ""Singing Detective"". Nor is it ""Lipstick on Your Collar"". It is a precusor to both - many of the characters from ""Pennies"" showing up in the ""Singing Detective"". The miniseries is about twice as long as it needs to be which was probably okay when it was shown weekly on BBC TV - but not good on DVD. The songs are obscure, the dance routines accompanying them decidely amateurish (no ""Bones"" routines here) and the overall effect is DREARY. The abundance of songs provides many  oppoportunities for snacking.

The picture quality is mediocre and apart from adding noisy previews to the rest of its DVD catalog to the beginning of the DVDs in the set, Aunty seems to have done little to improve the transcript - but then Criterion might have problems with this one. Bob Hoskins is embarrassing as Arthur - totally out of character - his apologies for wife beating make you cringe. Sound like diction classes for the BBC World Service. (""But Joan.........."")

""The Singing Detective"" and ""Lipstick"" are vibrant (when will we see the latter on DVD?) and maybe Karaoke/Cold Lazarus were good although these verged on the soporific, especially the latter and neither is available right now - but ""Pennies' is downright awful.",1094342400,9,1276,4.8173515981735155
2046063,3,B0001Z4P6O,"This is not THE SINGING DECTECTIVE, which I liked very much. Although I watched PENNIES FROM HEAVEN straight through all six episodes, I did not find the storyline or the conclusion satisfactory. In fact, I can't think of a redeeming feature about the series. Some of the songs are familiar, because my folks had many of the recordings from that era, but many of the tunes were not familiar at all. The series probably appealed to viewers in the 1970s, because many of the folks who survived the Depression were still alive and tv was a relatively new phenomena. The actors are superb. I am a fan of Cheryl Campbell, and Bob Hoskins has a nice mouth, but in the end as far as I am concerned, they didn't carry the day.

It's difficult for me to imagine the generation that enjoyed `Sex in the City' and `Coupling' would find much of interest in this series.  How can the younger generation get the fact that in the ""old days"" women who enjoyed sex (let alone had sex outside marriage) were wanton? It's all so depressing.

Maybe there is one redeeming feature.  As always the shots of England are grand.  There are plenty of lovely country roads and great old automobiles for car afficionados.",1091923200,3,1193,4.582159624413146

8018863,5,B0001Z4P6O,"This is probably not everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy moderately-paced, dry British humor, a quietly bizarre concept, and 78-RPM era music, you might just love it. This series was the basis for the Steve Martin movie of the same name, and because of a marketing agreement tied to that film, it did not see the light of day in the US for many years. It follows the exploits of an unhappily married sheet music salesman (played by the wonderful Bob Hoskins), his wife, and an otherworldly homeless accordion player. The scenes are frequently augmented by the musical daydreams of the characters, where they lip-synch to some wonderful old recordings that comment on the current action or situation. Some of the anachronistic music videos are hilarious, and some are quite touching. The program is subtle in ways that American TV series are afraid to be; it never hits you over the head, you actually have to think sometimes, and it's not afraid to be quiet at times. If all this sounds good to you, give it a shot. I haven't recommended it to all my friends, but to those whose tastes run to the subtle-yet-bizarre, I highly recommend it.",1456790400,6,1143,4.691542288557214

8018865,5,B0001Z4P6O,"The Amazon review in the Amazon Product Description gives a good overview of the plot and the nature of the program, so rather than repeat those here, I'll just add that this is one of the best things ever done with television, innovative, involving, with superb actors portraying people you care about.  If the idea of a tragedy incorporating lip-synched old songs sounds gimmicky, all I can say is try it, it works.  This is one of the rare TV programs you'll think about and remember for a long time.  The DVD quality is very good, considering the series was produced in 1978, and though visually it still has something of the stagey, studio-like qualities of 1970s television, in this case even that is an asset, giving the series a sort of Brechtian deliberate artificiality.  Advisories: occasional sex, violence, and language, all of which are fairly mild by current standards.",1439164800,2,884,4.873333333333333
