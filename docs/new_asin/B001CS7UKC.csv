The dialogue was spot on, so much to the point the riffing and jabs at Creationist theory is perfectly laid out for the dead pile of coprolite it is! Well made by the creators and good on them for tackling this touchy subject!..... Wait, you're saying this wasn't a joke?!",1479600000,,418,4.662162162162162
8352210,1,B001CS7UKC,"If you're not big on understanding science or natural history, this might be right up your alley.  It's somehow even less accurate than Hollywood's Dinosaurs, where you can somehow get an entire genome out of a mosquito.  I'm Commander Shepard, and this is the most idiotic piece of nonsense on the Citadel.",1475712000,,307,4.884615384615385
