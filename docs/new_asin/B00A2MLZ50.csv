5379475,5,B00A2MLZ50,"Now I know why true nature won so many indie awards. Thrilling and suspenseful with an ending that will surprise you. For her first major film, Marianne Porter was intense and believable, outstanding job. I highly recommend this movie.",1367625600,,235,5.051282051282051
5379476,4,B00A2MLZ50,"Definitely more of a suspense thriller than a horror film ""True Nature"" has some chilling moments albeit a predictability where you'll find yourself figuring much of it out far too early.

Independent films have a special place in my heart and I imagine if you're reading this review - yours as well. I applauded the effort and it's always refreshing to watch a little gem of a film that wasn't cranked out of the big Hollywood movie machine.

True nature has much of the above working in it's favor.

Director Patrick Steele who has previously only directed shorts steps up to the plate of a full length picture with a definitive style and competence. The production value is dark and eerie and I would add that the performances are quite stellar and rise above whatever flaws lay in the script.

Stand outs are Carolyn McCormic as the mother and  Marianne Porter as the daughter who let's just say isn't quite right. Despite it's flaws it's an admirable thriller and although chances are you won't feel the need to sleep with the lights on ""True Nature"" is a creepy way to spend an hour and a half.",1366848000,,1100,4.591836734693878
5379477,3,B00A2MLZ50,"I found the movie to be suspenseful, although I guessed the outcome half way through.  It was a movie that could be called ""supernatural"", but basically it was about the corruption of the soul.  Nothing hair raising, just a character study of a well to do family that was bankrupt where it counts the most.  Some family members were rather nasty.  The acting was pretty good, but I would not actually buy the movie.  Renting it was the best choice for me anyway.",1366416000,5,462,4.518072289156627
5379478,1,B00A2MLZ50,This flick was totally predictable and very slow moving. I kept waiting for ANYTHING to happen. It was one of those movie that you keep hoping the director will tie everything together and make you feel like you haven't totally wasted the last hour and A half of your life.....but that never happens.,1365292800,4,300,4.679245283018868

Kept waiting for something to make sense.  Kept waiting for something, anything to happen. Daughter goes missing after going for a run. She returns a year later covered in dirt, dehydrated, thin, malnourished and unable to remember where she has been.  Most of the movie goes on and on with her digging in dirt, smelling like dirt, flashbacks of dirt, etc.  Her mother, the only one that makes any sense at all, tries to comfort and help her daughter.  The daughter appears to be going mad. The father has business problems that he doesn't seem to be able to resolve and is of no help to his daughter or his wife.  A few spooky moments of ghosts in the corner, dead birds, things breaking and then finally, revenge. The first 10 minutes and the last 10 minutes is the entire story.  And that is pretty much it.",1365120000,5,949,5.2105263157894735
5379480,5,B00A2MLZ50,This movie keep me on the edge of my seat.  I found myself wishing I had waited for someone to watch the movie with since I kept jumping out of my skin.  Marianne was great.  You could see her love for her father yet I could not figure out his feelings for her.  I really never did.  I changed my mind several times about their relationship. All characters did a great job but Marianne was outstanding.  I plan to watch the movie again when I have someone available to watch with me.,1363651200,3,483,4.195652173913044
5379481,3,B00A2MLZ50,"TRUE NATURE ---a really weak title by the way --- is a slow moving tale of retribution that ultimately suffers from its lethargy and predictability.
In a rather condensed nutshell, the plot follows a young girl who vanishes one night and shows uo a year later, not knowing where she's been.  Thanks to some early hints, it's fairly obvious where the movie's heading.  The sole recognizable actor is Law & Order;s Dr. Olivet (Carolyn McCormick) who plays the victim's over-protective mother.  The overall performances are typical of this kind of flick and it does manage to hold your attention although its abrupt predictable ending is disappointing.

Beautifully shot and skillfully directed, this independent film has competed and won awards in film festivals all over the world, and gotten rave reviews from genre critics.

I had to do quite a bit of ... stop the movie, go back a bit to be on the same page as this movie and, I still sat at the end with a neon question mark over my head! I appreciated the suspense the movie had, there were some good suspenseful moments. I am uncertain why they even had the mother character. Her role in the movie was in my opinion, useless, disconnected, and a waste. The money used on her character could have gone into the movie itself to make it better. Please do not think I am bashing who played the mother, I am not. I really enjoy her in other movies, just not this one. The male roles, well, ill go with the old saying that ends with, don't say anything at all. I like the story line and the main character.

5379494,2,B00A2MLZ50,"Interesting idea but badly executed. I began suspecting something was not quite right about the young woman, right away. My main issue was that the people who made the movie took way too much time to get to the point of what really happened. I was getting VERY bored during most of the movie. Not a good thing for a supernatural movie. And since that was not enough, I figured out very early that what I was seeing was all fake. The first dead birds, told me. It has been used in many movies. By the time I found out exactly what kind of low life the father was, it was too late. Lots of trying to tricking the audience, what you see is not what you get.",1526774400,,654,4.1171875

5379499,4,B00A2MLZ50,"Better than I expected and filmed in such a way that it comes together nicely in the end if more predictable than I'd have liked. I have to disagree with some of the other reviews here. True Nature isn't scary, there isn't a scene in the film that was frightening to me or inspired a jump. It's a stretch to even call this a supernatural film as the ""super"" part of it doesn't really come into play until the last 15 minutes of the film. But the reason True Nature deserves 4* IMO is because the acting is very well done.

Marianne Porter played her part really well and I was surprised to learn that True Nature is the only full length film she's been in. Reg Land is also good in this film as Marianne's father as well as Carolyn McCormick as Marianne's mother. The pacing is well done and but there is one Reg Land scene in the film that's a dead give away to the twist to the plot. I think this could have been better played to keep the ""guess who, guess what"" aspect going longer. The visual cues to show the results of the central plot were a bit too subtle for my tastes because, in this regard the dots don't connect that well until the very last scene. By then, it's easy not to care.

When it's all said and done though, I enjoyed this film for Marianne's performance more than any other. I have to agree with a reviewer that said this film isn't original and is a take on a plot used in a cult classic from over 20 years ago. In not spoiling it, I won't say which film it is either but that film handles the plot device much better than True Nature even though True Nature is still a good film.",1525910400,3,1605,4.141025641025641
5379500,4,B00A2MLZ50,"It's refreshing that there are still thought provoking films like this. Unfortunately, schools don't teach kids free thinking, because so many of them don't get it.

I'm sad for the modern generation of people who can't enjoy something unless it's hand fed. Too bad.",1525910400,4,384,4.579710144927536

I kept waiting and watching because it was obvious ***SPOILER ALERT*** that she was dead but there was no explanation as to how she came back. There was the symbolic falling apart and breakage of things in the house but that wasn't explained, either, except that their world was falling apart. I don't know, were they all dead? Didn't seem like it. This film is one big mess. Don't waste your time. Spend 90 minutes doing laundry or washing dishes. Much more productive.",1525737600,,611,4.614678899082569
5379502,4,B00A2MLZ50,I liked it. For about half the movie I was convinced it was a suspense/thriller genre with an occasional odd happening then it turns into a supernatural movie which I thought it was to begin with.

5379507,4,B00A2MLZ50,"Pretty solid supernatural / thriller...  I don't think I would go so far as to call this a horror, although there are a handful of scares...

The majority of the aspects of the flick were done fairly well...  acting, audio, camera work, lighting, special effects, etc...
( small caveat on the acting - some of the lines were a bit cheesy, but I thought still delivered ""o...k...""...  I think a couple minor tweaks, and maybe an extra run through the script could have polished some of the sketchy areas... )

The level of suspense throughout the movie is actually quite good...  ( or at least I thought so )...  however as others noted, the ""twist"" is given away awful awful early...

I'd also point out that the ""twist"" itself really isn't nearly as original as some other reviews are letting on...  Even before it was blatantly obvious, I had pretty hard core suspicions about what was going on ( in fact, the concept was essentially stolen from one of my favorite movies from 1994...  won't tell you which one as that would be a mega spoiler )...  That said, it was still done well...  just could have been better...

So...  is the movie extraordinary or anything?  Nah, not really...  but for a rainy Sunday afternoon, I'd consider it a pretty solid thriller to sit back and enjoy...  I did...

( one side note...  just thinking back...  10 to 1...  I bet if they worked on the soundtrack a bit more this movie could have been a LOT better...  Some of the faster ""thrill"" scenes could have really used some kind of killer music to really get the heart going... )",1523750400,11,1566,4.517857142857143

5379510,4,B00A2MLZ50,"Regardless of how much I love zombies and creature-features, Im still a sucker for a good supernatural thriller.  I love movies with original concepts, especially when they are in the horror genre.  TRUE NATURE, a 2013 release from Monarch Home Entertainment, is one of these great films.  Chocked full of intensity and intrigue, this film will keep you enthralled right up to the end.

Before I continue, I have to state that I will not be going into great detail about the plot.  If I do, I will give certain key elements away, and discovering what is actually going on is part of what makes this film so enjoyable.  So, I am going to be very vague when I discuss the actual story.

TRUE NATURE is shot well and looks excellent onscreen.  Im not sure what the budget was for the film, but they used every bit of it wisely.  From the sets to the lighting to the special effects, everything looks great.

The acting is also top notch as well.  I enjoyed the entire cast, although actress Marianne Porter,  who portrays the main character, steals the show.  She only has a couple of credits on her IMDB page, but wowshe gives a staggering performance that will leave you in awe.  I hope to see more of her in future projects.

The special effects look good as a whole, even if they are CG.  Theres not much gore here (a couple of gunshot wounds and some blood-tears), but what we see looks good onscreen.  I particularly enjoyed the CGI Effects feature in the Special Features.  This shows how they did certain shots and the layers that were used.

But the story in TRUE NATURE is the real winner here.  It is very original and suspenseful.  I can honestly say I did not see the ending coming.  It wasn't what I was expecting at all.

My sole complaint about the film is the very final scene.  I will not go into specifics, but it didn't make much sense to me.  Maybe I simply misunderstood it.

5379516,4,B00A2MLZ50,"I've commented before about what I call the MTV generation. This is a group of film goers who have no patience when it comes to movies. They want the information thrown at them immediately, they want it NOW! Because of this attitude they don't have time for movies that offer what I call the slow burn. These are films that give you pieces of the story, that take their time in allowing you to absorb what is going on rather than just rush into it in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The best thing about these movies is that when done well they are quite enjoyable.

Consider the films of Hitchcock. Even in a film like PSYCHO, his most popular film, you don't have the true gist of the story until 30 minutes into the film. You get glimpses of what is to come, you get set up for what is going to come, and you get involved with the characters. He did this in most of his films. Alas I don't think today's generation would have the patience to sit through an entire Hitchcock film. That's sad. Because not only will they miss some of the greatest films of all times, they'll more likely than not complain about films like TRUE NATURE which deserves more credit than that.

The film opens with college student Marianne who goes for a jog one night only to disappear. To stop there would make a short film. Instead the movie takes us to a year later with parents Becky and Reg are still grieving over the loss of their daughter. Miraculously she suddenly shows on the front doorstep caked in mud and filthy though wearing the same clothes she had on when she disappeared.

Questioned by the police Marianne offers them little information about what happened to her. She seems to have a mental block about events and possibly is suffering from memory loss in an attempt to retain her sanity. She's given time to recover and go home with her parents.

But things remain strained at home. She gets glimpses of what happened but never quite the full story. She wonders why her father didn't come searching for her while we viewers believe he did everything in his power to find her. And beneath it all there is a tension between these family members that makes you wonder if things were as proper and peaceful as they seemed when the film began.

The movie offers clues as to what's going on, lets you see bits and pieces of the past and current time lines to try and figure out what happened and what will be. I thought I had figured it out but found myself surprised by the end of the film. It does a good job of bringing together the complete story together and offering a tale that is most satisfying.

Complaints I've read about the film have made me think I am correct about that MTV generation. Poor remarks almost seem uniform in complaining that not enough is explained or that it doesn't jump in fast enough. These are obviously written by those who have yet to understand the beauty of the slow burn. They cheat themselves from enjoying a movie that tells a story rather than blows things up.

One thing about this movie that should give film makers a boost is that it was shot in Dayton, OH and not Hollywood. This proves that you don't have to go to California to make a good movie. The acting on hand makes the characters believable, enough so that you care and are concerned about all involved. The production values are equal to anything seen from out west. With that in mind I for one hope to see more quality films being made here in the Midwest. I also hope that enough people begin to see that a slow burn film can be enjoyable.

5379518,4,B00A2MLZ50,"Some people here and on Netflix give this movie low marks -- claiming that it is both boring and confusing. Ignore them. This is a great indie movie!

The film isn't told in a linear fashion. So, you will get a lot of flashbacks. But you will soon become comfortable with the structure, and when that happens, the movie becomes nothing but suspense all the way through. The only bad part -- and this is minor -- was the rushed period of time during the year when the daughter was missing. But, by reducing the time on this issue, the director was able to keep the film at a reasonable length.

The acting is very good - even if the characters are a bit one-dimensional.  The lead actress shows versatility; she is not always the petulant, needy girl. I wish they would have used the boyfriend character a bit more. The actor was very capable.

As the movie winds down, it becomes a bit gory - but not too much. Also, while the ending does not answer every question, we find out why she went missing (which is the most important issue).  It is easy and interesting to fill in the blanks with imagination.

If you like suspense with a supernatural twist and do not mind working with a flashback structure, you will like this movie. I would not describe the plot as complicated to understand or as confusing (as others have done). Maybe some people just aren't that savvy or do not watch closely enough.

8546304,1,B00A2MLZ50,"It did not make sense. If she is a ghost, then it doesn't make sense because she is too real or human to fit the characteristic of a ghost.  If she is real, then it still doesn't make sense because she has demonic supernatural abilities which doesn't fly with being human. You are led to the conclusion that she is dead but came back a year later to seek revenge? Make her dad feel suicidal? I don't know. In this story, the character is better off dead and leave it alone. The most disappointing part is as you watch the beginning you are led to believe there is this great mystery unveiling and just as you are trying to figure out the mystery, there really is not one--one that makes sense. Why did dad owe money to those other CEO's? CEO's acting like mafia sharks? Why hire a man to kill? Why does the daughter come back expecting her father to have saved her, when his ""back was to the wall""? None of the events of plot add up or logically make sense.  This was a waste of movie watching time",1528675200,,998,4.219895287958115
