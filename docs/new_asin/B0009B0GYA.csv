2275560,1,B0009B0GYA,"I have really enjoyed almost all the recent superhero movies over the past few years. This was such a disappointment! Ben Affleck's acting is abismal and Mark Johnson's directly is equally horrible. There is more character development in the comic books. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the special effects used to show how Daredevil ""sees"". Otherwise this was an absolute waste. Not worth watching even if Amazon paid me!",1512259200,,435,5.055555555555555
2275561,3,B0009B0GYA,This movie isn't the best but it brings back good memories,1511049600,,58,4.363636363636363
2275562,1,B0009B0GYA,"The only good things about this movie are the few lines Foggy Nelson is given and the fact that the reoccurring rain trick actually came into play at the end of the movie.  But a few one-liners and a reoccurring gimmick do not a movie make.

The movie starts with Matt ""philosophically"" narrating his origin story, followed by him promptly murdering a guy and it only goes downhill from there.  The character motivation makes no sense and most of the acting is subpar at best.  Bullseye does this odd, grunting breathing thing throughout the movie that's supposed to be intimidating, but ends up coming off as goofy more than anything else.  The cinematography choices are the mark of an inexperienced movie maker and the soundtrack is often in direct conflict with the tone of the scene, distracting the viewer from any emotional connection to the characters.  My main complaint about this movie is that Matt Murdock seems to spend the entire time desperately trying to expose his own secret identity.  Almost everything he does in his day to day life shows he has superpowers.  And for a lawyer who's being paid in fish by one of his clients, he somehow manages to afford all kinds of Batman-esque gadgets and an isolation tank.

The movie is constantly in conflict with itself, leaving the viewer confused and unsatisfied.  This is honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  If you're a Daredevil fan, just save yourself the trouble and go watch the Netflix show.",1510272000,,1473,4.782608695652174

2275567,3,B0009B0GYA,"I feel like Im in an interesting position seeing this movie after the original theatrical release (which I heard sucked) and after seeing the first two seasons of Daredevil on Netflix. Its definitely not as bad as the theatrical cut from what Ive heard and read, but its not as good as Netflix. The movie had good effects with Matts radar (or sonar), and they had a decent cast. I also liked the dark and violent themes of this movie because it provides and interesting contrast to other super heroes like Spider-Man. I felt they didn't go far enough with it though, or explore enough. Matts loneliness and doubts about what he did were interesting watch. Once or twice he actually chose not to help someone. I feel like they really tried to convey that he was a complex and tortured character mentally and physically. I appreciated that. Daredevil is a little similar to Batman in that way. Funny that Affleck played both. He was a decent Daredevil though, and that was cool.

As for the whole Electra thing: jeez. Cringe worthy. I didn't like her character and the plot revolving around her in this movie much at all. I didn't believe Garner as elektra and the spontaneous playground fight scene made no sense on multiple levels. Wow that was corny. The whole relationship was rushed and I didn't feel for her or her relationship with Matt. They shouldve saved that for a sequel if they were thinking of making one. They couldve used that time to have more of the kingpin instead of making it like oh hes some big rich and mysterious crime boss; thats it. Colin Farrell really went nuts with bullseye too. Over the top. I know his character is crazy but come on. Tone it down a bit lol. Finally the music... eh some poor choices of music and at weird times once or twice.

Overall, its a cool super hero movie. Decent characterization, plot and action. Shouldve been better though. They tried to fit too much in and made some poor choices with Elektra.",1508803200,,1954,4.58

2275610,1,B0009B0GYA,Rented this directors cut of daredevil sucks. It is extremely slow moving  boring compared to the PG-13 version which I feel is much better and I had a much more detailed story line  Do yourself a favor skip this one and just see the PG-13 version of this movie.

2275621,4,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil Director's Cut is a much-improved version of the movie that was released in theaters. Being R-rated it added more time, violence and bone crunching moments in the major fight scenes. The film's overall tone was more consistently dark and gritty but still having a heart. You see more character interactions. This cut also adds a major subplot that not only fleshes out Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson characters as lawyers but fills in major plot holes the original movie had. This made the Final Act with Daredevil and Wilson Fisk more satisfying and meaningful.
 The movie still has its issues. The playground fight scene is over the top and hard to watch. When young Matt Murdock discovers his powers he acts more like Spiderman than Daredevil when jumping around in midair. The obvious signs of young Matt Murdock becoming the Daredevil were a bit ""on the nose"" at times. And Yeah Colin Farrell's Bullseye is a bit exaggerated, but I kind of liked it (Is that weird?)
 Overall the added 30 minutes of this movie made this ""diamond in the rough"" very enjoyable and fun. Is it on the same level as Iron Man or Batman Begins? No, but it's better that all of The Amazing Spiderman (1&2) and Fantastic Four movies. The more I watch this version of the movie, the more I appreciate how great it is. Had this version of the movie been released in theaters more people would have liked it. But it seems time has made this Directors Cut an instant Cult Film. So pass the Cool-aid around because I'm a fan. Cheers!

2275683,4,B0009B0GYA,"Batfleck. Ben Affleck: he who is now famous for donning the cape and cowl of the bat in Superman Vs. Batman: Dawn of Justice.  Like Ryan Reynolds who played Green Lantern in that much maligned film prior to striking proverbial comic book gold with his rendition of Deadpool and also like Chris Evans who played the Fantastic Fours super-hothead the Human Torch before making it big as the iconic Captain America, Ben Affleck followed suit.  Only his poor mans superhero was Daredevil and though it too was often reviled the film gets an unfair spanking methinks in that earlier time before the superhero film took off into stratospheric heights.  Affleck, who plays Matthew Murdock, a.k.a. the costumed vigilante Daredevil who brings a dark justice to the unrighteous abusers and criminals within the seedy New York suburb of Hells Kitchen, is stiff and awkward and even Frankenstein-ish as our hero.  But he also conveys a charm and warmth amidst his Catholic conflictedness as he metes out brutal beatdowns to those thugs and butchers who aren't served justice within the courtrooms.  Oh, and hes blind though he has all of his other senses incredibly enhanced to compensate and now has a superhuman radar sense (think of it like a bats echolocation ability).  Daredevil locks horns with the main officer of organized evil, the Kingpin of crime (played by the late Michael Clarke Duncana very large man who drew fanboy cries of foul because he wasn't the right, er, white skin color as his comic book counterpart), who sets the insane bounty hunter Bullseye (played with unconvincing verve by then It boy Colin Farrell) onto ol hornhead.  With some dicey CG to enhance their agile acrobatic fights the two take after each other with some ferocity but the film still maintains an almost kitschy comic book feel.  Jennifer Garner (who ends up marrying Affleck outside of the movies) is also along for the ride and plays Elektra Natchios, a love interest for Murdock while also being an adversary for Daredevil when she believes that hes responsible for her fathers death (shes, like, a specially trained ninja).  The scenes between the two are fun even if a little hokey (they have a romantic fighting moment in a kids playground as they fight around and balance on a two teeter totterswhile the local children watch).  Its cool to see Murdock see Elektra on a rooftop when it starts to rain and he can read the individual splashing droplets on her face.

One thing that this film nails is a great leather Daredevil costume.  Say what you want about the other aspects of the film but that costume is pitch comic perfect.  The film pulls most of its comic book cues and storyline from writer/ artist Frank Millers seminal run on the series (hmmnMiller was also responsible for one of the big Batman/ Superman clashes in his The Dark Knight storywe could do a fun 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon game with all of this).  This R rated Directors Cut adds a lot of violence, especially gunplay, in an early bar fight scene.  Beyond this theres not a lot added thats really memorable from the standard version of the film, and this flick has got to be considered a light R in the rating category compared to what else is out there.

All in all this is a rather safe but moderately enjoyable comic book drama whose first half works better than its second half.  Directors Cut only necessary for the fans.  3.75 stars.",1472342400,,3403,4.758503401360544

Now he is a caring lawyer and a man who is at odds with what he does and his religious faith. As Murdock the blind lawyer he is a devoted Catholic (he doesn't sleep around, one of the reasons his ex girlfriend breaks up with him) who cares about his community and the people he defends. But as Dare Devil he is often a killer (executioner) when the law fails the innocent.

Pros:
-I hear the directors cut is better (I am NOT going to pay money to find out)
-Special effects were ok

Cons:
-Acting is horrible (I really felt like I was watching a souped-up middle school production and I don't know if there was a decent performance)
-The script was bad (silly silly dialogue)
-Fight on the playground
-Bullseye catching glass

The only defendable part of this movie was that I believe it was made before Disney got a hold of Marvel.  The acting is so bad I almost laughed out loud a few times.  I have never read the comic books and so I am not prejudiced in that way.  The Directors cut is unrated and I really don't want to recommend trying that if it is more violent than the Theatrical release.

In fact I enjoyed it more than those films because it introduced me to a great new superhero character that is now one of my favorites. I think the negative criticism this film has received is mostly due to teenagers/young adults jumping on the Ben Affleck-bashing bandwagon. With Affleck having turned his career around so impressively (and it looks like he may give a stellar performance in Batman v Superman, although we'll have to see) hopefully this film will be reconsidered by critics.

2275912,2,B0009B0GYA,"I was beating my head against the wall trying to come up with a movie to review when my friend and fellow blogger/writer James Butler mentioned the new Daredevil series. I haven't seen it yet, but when I have the time, I plan to sit down to binge watch as many episodes as I possibly can without destroying my marriage.

My first thought was, ""Maybe I should review the first episode."" And then I thought, ""Wait. Wasn't I feeling guilty about something? Certainly I did somebody wrong some time in my life. Why don't I rewatch Daredevil the movie as penance?"" That's exactly what I did. Not only are my sins forgiven, I may have actually made myself a virgin again in the process. I can even perform miracles. I can't walk on water yet, but I've been practicing on rain puddles, so any day now.

And yet, still not as bad as Fifty Shades. Congratulations, E.L. James. You've lowered the bar. You've lowered the bar.

2275931,3,B0009B0GYA,Daredevil was a great movie. It kept my attention through out the while movie. Good story line. It is a wonderful experience.,1432944000,,125,4.7272727272727275
2275932,4,B0009B0GYA,"The main reason I went to see Daredevil when it was in the theaters in 2003 was because of Jennifer Garner.  This was in the middle of her run on Alias, and I will admit to having a crush on her.  I remembered enjoying it at the time, but I've heard complaints about it since.  So when I decided to watch it again, I thought I might see those issues.  Honestly, I still enjoyed it.

The movie tells the story of Matt Murdock.  As a boy (Scott Terra) he is blinded in an accident involving toxic waste.  But the toxins make the rest of his senses super strong, so he is more than able to compensate.  He can even use sound vibrations to ""see"" what is around him.  As an adult (Ben Affleck), he becomes a lawyer, fighting for justice.  And when justice doesn't happen in the courts, he takes matters into his own hands as Daredevil, a masked superhero/vigilante.

Things get really interesting when he meets Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner).  Through her, he winds up facing off against crime boss Kingpin (Michael Duncan Clark) and he hired assassin Bullseye (Colin Farrell).  Who will be left standing in the aftermath?

Now I'm not saying this movie is perfect.  The prolog, while important to the overall story and the character arc, certainly takes a long time.  This is part origin tale and part regular story, and that makes the pace slower than it should be.

Frankly, I also didn't care much for the soundtrack most of the time.  In keeping with the darker, gritty feel they were going for, there is plenty of rap and hip hop, genres I can't stand.  That was annoying at times, but usually the songs weren't on for very long.

Now maybe it's because I know nothing about the characters portrayed here, but I liked the story overall.  Even when we have the extended flashback to Matt Murdock's youth, I was pulled into the story.  The entire movie kept me engaged, even though I remembered the broad outline of the plot.

The character growth for Matt as we watch him from beginning to end is actually rather amazing.  I don't much care for him at times at the beginning, but by the end I actually do like his character and how he's matured.

The acting is really what anchors things.  I found Ben Affleck believable as Matt/Daredevil.  Fanboy that I am, I will admit that a scene or two from Jennifer Garner doesn't quite ring true, but I found most of her performance believable.  And Colin Farrell is appropriately creepy as Bullseye.  Michael Duncan Clark isn't given much to do as Kingpin, but he makes the most of his scenes as well.

They actually created the ""images"" that Matt can see based on sound, and it's pretty well done.  I can believe that this is what it would actually be like.  And those images also create one of the most emotionally powerful scenes involving Elektra and Matt.

Frankly, I found all the effects to be believable, although I wasn't paying close attention to them.  Maybe that's the highest praise I can give - they didn't get in the way at all.  I also enjoyed the stunts.  At times I had to turn off my brain and believe the premise that a blind man could do everything we see Matt doing, but when I did, I had fun.  And there's a fight scene in a playground that has to be the most fun I've ever seen.

The tone of this one is darker than many superheroes.  For some reason, I found that darkness to make the film even more intriguing.

I honestly don't get how this is considered so much worse than much of today's superhero movies.  It was certainly one of the darker films in the genre for that era, but in the days of Batman Begins and especially The Dark Knight, I don't find it as dark as I did originally.  In many ways, I think it laid the foundation for those films by showing us a darker superhero.

So I say give the movie a second chance on its own merits.  You might just find yourself enjoying Daredevil more than you originally did.",1432771200,,3894,4.431593794076163

2276002,1,B0009B0GYA,"I got this movie for free with the fantastic four dvd set years ago. i was never interested in seeing it until after watching ""the trial of the incredible hulk"" where bixby teams up with daredevil. I was expecting something good along those lines for the character. Boy was i wrong. This movie would break the mst3k crew. Its worse than manos the hands of fate or cave dwellers. It is so stupid and boring i couldn't make it all the way through. The acting was hokey, the special effects were more along the lines of special education, the action defied all laws of physics and common sense, scenes supposed to be important just made me want to cry of boredom, the dialog was idiotic like kids wrote the script and the music is as irritating as babies screaming or beating pots and pans together. I couldn't even riff it fast enough to make it funny. The weird scenes showing how daredevil sees the world will induce a headache if not a seizure. The beginning of the movies shows daredevil is not only a pill popping drug addict but he also enjoys his bath salts. When daredevil first meets electra she walks into a coffee joint. He cant see her, has no clue what she looks like other than his friend describing her as hidious but singles her out to harass for no apparent reason. Chasing her around demanding she tell him her name which finally leads to the idiotic fight at the playground. That brings me to my next point the way the characters can bounce around, kicking, punching, blocking(which looks totally fake) but when they finally get hit you could see it coming and i had to wonder how did these super skilled martial artists not see that coming. Like electra doing karate fighting daredevil while balancing and bouncing around on playground equipment. Supposedly so skilled but then later she is somehow stupid enough to try to catch a slow moving blade ( which was hers in the 1st place) thrown from 20-30 ft away and gets it stuck through her hand? Why not move when you can tell she saw it coming with the camera showing her staring at it the whole way in slow motion? Or when daredevil throws a vase thing at bullseye and with bullseye staring right at him still gets hit from 30 feet away?  If he can catch Electras small blade out of the air but couldn't dodge a large shiney object? When daredevil is running it looks like they used cgi for it? He looks like he is constipated when he is running. Why not just record the actual actor running? When they jump you can tell its fake and they are being hoisted up on cables. Then there's daredevil outfit. A red skin tight leather catsuit? He looks like he fell out of a gay bar and hit every pe%#s on the way out. Catwoman wears catsuits not dudes. I have to say this is the worst movie ive ever seen, worse than wrath of paul bunyan, killer shrews, giant leeches any movie i have ever seen. the people who created it must have been popping pills and eating bathsalts with daredevil? I really hope they do alot better with the remake  but i am almost to afraid to find out after seeing this. It was like watching the sound of someone rake their nails across a chalkboard and i couldn't even make it more than an hour before my migraine from the weird camera angles, idiotic dialogue, annoying music and cheap special effects became too much.",1428710400,,3308,4.448105436573312

2276020,4,B0009B0GYA,"Recently went back and watched Daredevil: The Directors Cut and it is seriously underrated.  Yes, there are some early 2000s quirks to it that have aged the movie poorly:

- annoying nu-metal alternative rock songs
- some awkward cgi-acrobatics
- unnecessary obvious ripoffs of Sam Raimi Spider-Man imagery
- leatherso much leather

But it does so much right.  For my money, the actors deliver highly enjoyable takes on these characters.  Michael Clarke Duncans Kingpin is menacing and large, Ben Affleck and Jon Favreau have great chemistry as Nelson and Murdock, even Colin Farrells scenery chewing rendition of Bullseye lines up with the more unhinged, unpredictable portrayal of the character in more recent comics.  From a story perspective, I was also impressed with how many iconic storylines from the comics they were able to weave together successfully in just over 2 hours.  You get shades of Frank Millers The Man Without Fear and Elektra stories, more exploration of the toll Daredevil takes on Murdocks life, physically and spiritually, better subplots for iconic Daredevil supporting players like Ben Urich and Foggy Nelson, and even a healthy amount of fan service (double check the names of those boxers in the beginning and watch for a cameo by Marvel Knights Daredevil writer Kevin Smith).  I also thoroughly enjoyed the way his hyper-senses and blindness are handled in the film, both as Matt Murdock and in battle as Daredevil.  It is visually compelling and really brings you into Murdock's world in a visceral way.

In terms of construction, the directors cut surprised me in how much it echoes the much praised The Dark Knight of years later in its Heat-like way of featuring various characters fighting over the fate of Hells Kitchen.  There's a methodical patience in the plotting of this cut that reminds me of Nolan's film.  Its not as balanced an attempt as The Dark Knight; Ben Urich and Wilson Fisk are not given nearly enough focus to succeed in that regard, but as I watched the film I could see the potential for a trio rivaling the Wayne-Dent-Gordon triangle of The Dark Knight.  Im not trying to put Mark Steven Johnsons admittedly flawed Daredevil on the same pedestal as Chris Nolans Batman masterpiece, but theres a sort ofkindred spirit between the two films that I couldn't help but notice.  It makes me wonder what kind of Daredevil movie Johnson might have delivered if he had the same budget, technology, and studio support Nolan had with his Batman sequel.  At a minimum, I wonder if they had released this directors cut theatrically instead of the butchered studio version would we consider Daredevil in the same league as Bryan Singers X-Men movies or Sam Raimis (first two) Spider-Man films of the same time period.

2276024,5,B0009B0GYA,"I heard this was a bad movie. But, having enjoyed Daredevil comics as a kid, I knew I had to give it a fair chance. I really liked the way the story explained the part where young Matt went blind and go superpowers of athelicism and super hearing and balance at the same time. The fact that the Kingpin had killed his father gave him rather a dark edge to him, which agreed with the original Marvel characterization. I really like the relationship between Matt and Foggy and the banter between them. And Jennifer Garner as Elektra? I thought the playground scene was especially slick. Marvel puts enough trouble into the character's lives to get the fans to relate, and this movie is no exception. I appreciate that when the movie was being made, that they made the suit a darker shade of red to differentiate feom the shade in the Spiderman movie. The color was better, IMHO. The reporter trying to uncover Dardevil's identity was a nice touch. Ben Affleck did a good job playing the character Daredevil. Michael Clarke Duncan played a very convincing Kingpin. Sorry to see that he has passed away. Colin Farrell was an excellent villain and fun to watch as Bullseye. All in All, I did not agree with the public criticisms of this movie or Affleck's performance.

The movie producers brought this Marvel character to life in a convincing way. Great job.",1425859200,,1354,4.665271966527197

2276028,4,B0009B0GYA,"I hear so many bad reviews about this movie and it makes me sick to my stomach. There is some poor acting on Ben Afflecks part. Especially the scene where he is on the playground trying to keep up with Jennifer Garners character, Elektra. Jennifer made Ben actually look like he belongs in a youth martial arts class. And after watching the ""Jay & Silent Bob"" movie(s), IT IS KIND'VE HARD TO TAKE ANY OF HIS MOVIES SERIOUS. That is why i think the new Batman charactor will be ruined. And that is the only reason Daredevil came up short. Colin Farrel did an amazing job with villain ""Bullseye"". Michael C. Duncan shined as the ""Kingpin"", also. And of course, who wouldn't enjoy seeing a sexy Jennifer Garner wield around some sai knifes like she was the ""Raphael"" of the Marvel universe?!? Forget what the haters say. Much respect goes to Mark S. Johnson for writing and directing a GREAT film. If only it didn't have Ben Affleck in it. PS- the directors cut is about 4.5 stars.",1423526400,,978,4.5

The story could have been a lot stronger and I was really mad when one of the characters dies at the end. But the rooftop scene between Elektra and Daredevil was the most romantic thing I've ever seen. This movie definitely has some great moments, including Daredevil's origin story. Definitely worth watching at least once.",1420156800,,405,4.8
2276041,1,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil resides in an elite group of superhero movies that include Batman and Robin (1997), Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007) and Catwoman (2004) as one of the contenders for worst comic book based movie ever. Yes this movie fails to rise up to even the mediocre standard of watch-ability set by Nicholas Cage's Ghost Rider or Ryan Reynolds's Green Lantern.

Ben Affleck stars as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer with a super-sensory radar and ninja fighting skills. By day he represents New York's downtrodden in court, while at night he kicks their asses and beats them with billy clubs.

A big problem with this movie was that the writer/director seemed unfamiliar with the character. In the comics, Daredevil was always a kind of ambiguous character. He was created by Stan Lee as a Spider Man light, but came into his own when he was re-imagined by master comic writer Frank Miller. As written by Miller, Daredevil was the kind of good guy who would resort to the kind of violence that Spider Man or Captain America would never consider...like Batman if Batman actually broke people's knee caps. Writing a heroic character who defends the weak but sometimes resorts to unethical is a tricky matter. For that reason Daredevil has always had more of cult following than a general following.

A lot of this was lost in the movie adaptation. The biggest problem with the movie was casting. Ben Affleck was more wooden than usual in this role, and Jennifer Garner was (to be charitable) less than convincing as a Greek aristocrat secretly trained by Ninjas to be a ruthless assassin. One of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes in all of cinema is Affleck and Garner in civilian clothes engaging in a fight scene that would make the average Karate white belt cringe. Michael Clark Duncan, who always struck me as about the nicest guy in Hollywood, seemed terribly miscast as one of the Marvel Universes most ruthless villains, Kingpin. Colin Farrell was cast as Daredevil arch villain Bullseye.  For the movie the all-American Bullseye was turned into an IRA assassin with a bulls eye shaped scar on his forehead...because every IRA assassin needs a distinguishing characteristic. With all the horrible acting on display its hard to tell if the screenplay was really as truly awful as it seemed.

But I'm willing to give the screenplay a lot of credit for the awfulness of this movie. For example, in the first courtroom sequence we see Matt Murdoch cross examining a rape suspect. Except, Matt isn't a prosecutor with the DA's office, he's a lawyer working for a client. I never went to law school, and have never been chosen for jury duty, but even I know that the crime victims privately hired lawyer doesn't get to cross examine the defendant. Hell, nobody gets to cross examine the defendant, including the prosecutor, in most cases. A competent screen writer might actually have called is lawyer and asked a couple of questions about how criminal courtrooms work...but not the writer of this steaming pile. Anyway, neither the plot not the action gets much better than the courtroom scene.

I expect Ben Affleck to bring the same high standard of super-heroics back to the big screen as Batman.",1420156800,,3259,4.873646209386282

2276135,5,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil, in my opinion, is a much underrated superhero film and film in general.  Plus, Ben Affleck gets much undeserved hate for this film, which I do not understand.  I admit, when I first saw this film years ago I did not like it either.  I think the reason why people (myself included) reacted negatively when they saw it is because the film when through many changes from its original version before coming to theatres.  Many scenes were cut out and a few scenes were put in a different order making the film very disjointed.  What most people do not know is that the original version of the film that the director wanted was released to DVD and is called the Directors Cut.  Unfortunately only diehard fans really know of this version.  I wish that this film was re-aired in theatres in its original version.  If that happens people might see this movie in a new light.  The Directors Cut is the definitive version (in my opinion) and is the version I will be reviewing.  I have not seen the theatrical version in a very long time and do not remember it much at all.  I am also not too knowledgeable on the Daredevil comics so I will not be making too many comparisons.

I have almost no problems with this film.  I have a couple issues but they are minor.  First of all, the cast is top notch.  Despite the popular opinion, I think Ben Affleck does a great job as Matt Murdock/Daredevil.  Playing a superhero is always hard for anyone because you are essentially playing to people.  Affleck has to capture Matt Murdock in his normal life and his normal job and when he is in the costume.  I do not know how accurate he is to the comic version, but in terms of the film itself he really sold me.  Jennifer Gardener was the perfect choice for Electra.  However, one of my issues has to do with her.

The villains were also very well cast.  Colin Farrell killed it as Bullseye.  I think this is easily one of Farrells best performances if not his best.  Plus, Bullseye is one of my favorite characters in the movie because he is just so fun to watch.  Michael Clarke Duncan also plays a great Kingpin.  He may not be accurate to the comic version (in terms of the look), but he does such a great job that I do not care.  May he rest in peace.

The film also looks great.  The style and atmosphere of the film really draw you in.  The score and soundtrack are also well-done.  The fights are exciting especially the ones involving Bullseye.  However, some of it looks a bit fake, which is mostly due to the effects.  The majority of the effects look good but some look a little dated.

For the most part the film is paced very well.  Although there is this one subplot about this guy on trial being framed for murder and Murdock trying to bail him out that went on a bit too long.  I know it is to show more of Murdock in his job as an attorney, but I still think it went on a bit too long.

I do have a couple issues.  Most of them I have already stated.  I stated how some of the effects looked dated and the subplot of the man being framed going on too long.  However, my biggest issue is with Electra.  (SPOILER) Electra dies near the end of the film.  My problem is that you see very little of her fighting.  For most of the film her character is just the love interest for Murdock.  It isn't until the end of the film that we finally see her fight like she did in the comics.  She has a short fight with Daredevil and then dies.  Thats it!  I know she dies in the comics, but I wish they would have saved that for the sequel (if there was one).

Overall, Daredevil is probably one of the most underrated superhero movies out there.  I highly recommend this version of the film.  Do not see the theatrical version.  If you can pick up the Directors Cut.",1402790400,,3763,4.266666666666667

2276151,3,B0009B0GYA,"In any review of a Comic Book Film, it must be understood that there is the impossible task of attempting to satisfy legions of rabid fans who have loved and read about the character for years, even decades. There are always going to be those who complain about one aspect or another that the filmmakers overlooked or that the actor wasn't the right one.

In spite of all this, there are a great many things about this film to like. The chemistry between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, for example, is amazing (small wonder in light of the fact they later married). The action sequences are pretty impressive, and Garner's performance was enough to spawn a spinoff.

OK, the portrayal of Daredevil's sonar wasn't like it is in the comics... yet, it works for me. It would be rather hard to demonstrate it the same way. But there is at least one place where the movie falls short of the comic. It seems to be a bit confused as to whether it's a comic book movie about a comic book character, or if it's a gritty realistic film about a comic book hero functioning in the real world.  This is most blatantly evident the character Bullseye. The performance is all right, but he doesn't have a costume. He asks for one, but doesn't get one.

To be honest, I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to movies. It's been a while since I've seen it, and I ordered this as a part of my collection. It's a good film, not a great one... the films licensed to Marvel Studios will ALWAYS be superior because they have a greater stake in making them quality movies. Part of the reason I purchased it was for my collection, but another is to compare the Marvel character films with the later Marvel Studios films. It's not just horrible the way than many seem to suggest. It's watchable, even fun at times.

If you're new to the character or if you can turn off your internal critic, you'll find this a fun watch.",1400112000,,1893,4.443804034582133

It's not a perfect film. The love story in the original, the Coolio scenes from the director's bog it down. But. there's more going for it than against.

Daredevil was the first comic movie (or one of the first) to show realistic tolls of being a hero. The scene where Matt Murdock climbs into the bath sore and battered comes to mind.

2276197,3,B0009B0GYA,"I was late to the party when it came to this Daredevil movie and most of the people I had spoken with about it said it was a bad one.  I see why they said that: generally poor writing plagued the movie.  I don't mind tweaks to canon (as in Jack ""The Devil"" Murdock), but they don't mention ""Foggy"" Nelson by name until about 30-40 minutes into the movie which leaves outsiders in the dark for too long.  Sometimes it was hard to tell the action going on in a few scenes as the lighting was way too dark, like in the seedy bar scene.  Elektra and Matt breaking out randomly into a duel on a playground of all places is one of the most awkward action scenes I have ever seen in a movie and the pace of them getting into a relationship is way off.  And what was up with the out-of-place musical number during the funeral scene?  That drowned out the dialogue that was taking place which didn't help matters.

However, there were points that I did like about the film.  The acting was generally competent: Ben Affleck did well as Matt Murdock/Daredevil.  The movie did successfully show things Matt Murdock struggled with: his image, his religion, his physical pain from years of action and the drawback of his powers.  Matt having to sleep in a sensory depravation tank, even if it was a little grandiose looking, was a nice touch.  The special effects with the ""radar sense"" scenes were a good touch in giving the viewer an image of how Murdock ""sees"", especially in the rain.  Bullseye's fight with Elektra was faithful to the comic depiction, which helped make it more familiar.  And in the end, Daredevil (and Matt) both triumph despite all the things he goes through because he's the Man Without Fear.

Aesthetically, there were no problems streaming the movie; it looked great.  So kudos to Amazon Video for that.

So Daredevil wasn't the greatest movie ever, but it's a way to kill some time if you want to watch It once.  If you decide to watch it yourself, just look for things to enjoy, because there will surely be a thing or two that you won't like.",1382400000,,2058,4.459893048128342

2276199,2,B0009B0GYA,"Trying to be a darker version of a superhero movie, `Daredevil' gets points for trying something different (well, at the time it was different), but sadly the execution cannot meet the intent and leaves us with an uneven and unsuccessful outcome.  The cast is not really up to the task, with Colin Farrell going more hokey than intense and Ben Affleck's brooding becoming a distraction.  Jennifer Garner and the late Michael Clarke Duncan fare better, but not by a huge margin.  Sadly though, it was the construction of the film that falters the most and fails the actors, giving us a messy and unfocused product.  This is long considered one of the worst superhero films, and I have to agree to a degree.  It tries, but it fails.  There is no real originality, and while the stunts here are impressive to an extent, they are redundant and ultimately underdeveloped and lazy.

The extras on the theatrical release are worth the purchase alone and now with the Director's Cut we get a much improved version of the film, plus a whole new bounty of extra material. It appears that the Blu Ray of the Director's Cut has carried over all the extras from the Director's Cut DVD (for once!), but I'm not positive about that. If so, keep the theatrical cut for the extra material and to revisit the theatrical release once and a while and buy the Blu Ray Director's Cut for the superior version and the new extra material.

Daredevil, first struck as awesome due to, the father and son relationship. It was a pairing I truely cared about and I was really sad when Matt's father died. The dark tone of the movie, was perfect for me, negative, real like and identifiable. Unlike most I didn't fully understand the character of Daredevil and this movie and Ben Affleck helped me to achieve that understanding, both as a lawyer and as a superhero. As you probubly guessed I enjoyed Affleck's preformence.

The other actors I felt all did their roles perfectly, though most lost some of their best scenes in the theatrical cut. Duncan rocked as the Kingpin and I personally feel, making him black made the character smarter and more menacing. Jennifer Garner was amazing as Elektra, the chemistry between her and Affleck was amazing. This was the first superhero romance that I actually wanted to be together (unlike spiderman, superman, most batman movies and captain america). Bullseye truely was evil and I got lots of menace from him. Everyone else I loved.

Many parts of the movie really affected me, the funeral, the death scenes, the church fight, the final battle and the ending. A movie that can make it so I feel stabbed when Elektra gets stabbed, is definutly a powerful movie. Also the film introduced me to Evanescence and a few of their best songs.

I won't mention weakness's with the theatrical cut, but I will mention the DC's problems. Removing the confussionals between Matt and the preist, one weakenss the preists character and makes him a nobody, two makes Matt's vigilante arch les meaningful along with Matt's 2nd to last speech ""I also saved myself"" and finally makes his knowing of Matt's identity useless.

I feel the order of Bullseye's scenes should be changed, first the airport metal detector, then the plane ride, the bar, throwing a pen into Frank Miller's head and then the battle. Doing the bar first now doesn't work, as he still has the beanne on at the airport, when he didn't pick it up.

With parts of his vigilante arch removed, I feel Daredevil's sparing of the Kingpin, makes less sense in this version, instead of the theatrical, where that arch was the main focus.

Also the bitts dealing with Matt's religion or the scenes that try to mention his mother, I feel shouldn't be here.

But those aren't that much of a problem for me, as this movie will always hold a soft spot for me, due to how powerful it was. Even though I bought the blu-ray I'm keeping my dvd's, as the commentaries are different (it was actually the first commentary I ever listened the entire way thorugh).

Of course my enjoyment doesn't completly overhsadow the faults this movie does have so I'll give it 4/5. And also this movie has a novelization. I own that also.",1356048000,,3332,4.67235494880546

2276294,3,B0009B0GYA,"This movie takes you through a interesting situation of a life of a man. I found the ""superpower"" of Daredevil - his unique heightened ability to sense things as one of the most interesting superpowers. His way of fighting is most entertaining as he cannot see. His way of ""seeing"" also is cool - he sees almost the full form of a person through through the presence of surrounding rain, as he can sense some sort of image when the drop hits.

Ben Affleck played his part well - very natural and believable. Thus I command the actors and how creators came up with the idea of Daredevil's disability (or superpower).

I give it three stars because I thought the plot of the movie itself was not great. The way the radioactive just spills in his eyes, was not very exciting. If he had fallen into a vat of radioactive substance and had to climb out would or something along those lines would be better.

Also, while his ability is cool and unique, I find his weakness a turnoff as a superhero. Superheros have a human side, yes, but I feel like his inability to withstand noise is a little much. He could be too easily defeated.

Not up to par or at the same level with Marvel's other movies, but nonetheless, decent.
I actually enjoyed watching Elektra more, so I recommend that one after watching Daredevil.",1344384000,,1307,4.5021097046413505
2276295,3,B0009B0GYA,"Though Daredevil is one of the more obscure figures in the pantheon of superheroes, he was nevertheless one of my personal favorites as a kid.  When the movie came out in 2003, I was basically pleased with the outcome.  Affleck is passable as the blind lawyer with superhuman senses.  The chemistry with Jennifer Garner's character, Elektra, works.  Good supporting performances from Joe Pantoliano and Jon Favreau, though Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin and Colin Farrell's Bullseye are both over the top, especially the latter.  The soundtrack is kicking, headlined by a couple of well-placed songs by up-and-coming (at that time) Goth band, Evanescence.  The special effects need some help in places, most noticeably the fight scene between Daredevil and Bullseye in the church, which is almost cartoonish.  All in all, it was a worthwhile movie.  Not the greatest superhero movie of all time, but worth watching.

When the Director's Cut version appeared, I was interested.  It contains 21 additional minutes of footage, along with a number of special features.  Sadly, the longer version was disappointing to me.  It makes the film darker and grittier, but also slows it down.  The quality of the blu-ray transfer is fine, and the sound seems okay as well.  But it is a shame that the theatrical release was not included in this edition.  I would have liked the option of seeing it in hi-def.

2276298,5,B0009B0GYA,"with any luck it will serve as a lesson to filmmakers: let the Powers That Be demand changes only if said changes constitute an improvement.
i've always prided myself on not being swayed by the critics. i've seen them denigrate too many winners (Spaceballs, UHF, The Shadow) and, worse, applaud too many losers (Saturday Night Fever, Dead Poets Society, Forrest Gump). the blind superhero was an intriguing concept, and it was as well-cast as any film i've ever seen. so i ready to judge the film on it's own merits and completely ignore those idiots.
only the critics appeared to be right. the pace was too breezy, the tone was inconsistent, and the plot had holes you could fly a 747 through. there was a time when it's only saving grace seemed to be that at least it wasn't Ang Lee's execrable Hulk movie (which came out around the same time.) it looked as if i would have to concede...at least for a year or so.
in time certain highly extenuating circumstances came to light. it seems that studio muckety-mucks - who apparently didn't understand the character and were expecting a more ""commercial"" movie - browbeat writer/director Mark Steven Johnson into, basically ripping the guts out the film. so Johnson (admittedly under duress) deleted an entire subplot and filmed a few hastily written new scenes in order to spackle what was left together. in the process what was supposed to be a highly personal odyssey ended up a textbook revenge-for-killing-my-girlfriend yarn.
(this situation reminds me of that scene from Amadeus. the King tells Mozart that his new opera would be perfect if he'd just ""cut a few notes,"" but stumbles when asked what notes to cut. Johnson found out the hard way that, unlike that hapless monarch, some will have an answer.)
the repair job makes all the difference. Matt Murdock's problems go from an intermittent nuisance to full-fledged ""issues,"" and we get to glimpse his previously glossed-over personal mission as lawyer to the downtrodden. the Kingpin's activities go from what seems like minor larceny to full-blown white collar infractions. in short, what the Powers That Be had removed was everything that would've given the film a shot at being unique.
as a comedy fan i'm particularly gratified to see some good courtroom scenes for Jon Favreau. it seems only fair as Favreau would further serve the Marvel machine by directing Iron Man.
as a rule i'm cynical of the ""director's cut"" concept, because it's so often little more than a director's narcissism and/or sour grapes. so it's good to see it used to salvage a film from the jaws of mediocrity for a change.

[NOTE: as i type The Avengers is in theaters and pretty damn good by most accounts, but one thing gives me a certain pause. why was Daredevil, who is an Avenger in the comics, not invited? this is especially confusing as being in an even worse film didn't get The Hulk removed from the guest list. and anyway, what's the point of even bothering with The Hulk, since Bill Bixby is dead? what a world, huh?]",1339977600,,3016,4.788867562380038

2276320,3,B0009B0GYA,"Beyond its dramatic opening shot of the titular character clinging to a church cross, the movie offers nothing of substance. There isn't one actor in this film who isn't miscast and the flashback storytelling is pointless.

STILL, although this isn't the greatest of Marvel's hero flicks, it's not the worst either--though it's Elektra spinoff just might be. Daredevil offers some dark and gritty fun that's not just stylized action for the kiddies. Though there isn't any major profanity, gory violence, or sex, the content of the film is much more mature, and its metaphors and character archs are probably beyond the understanding of most kids and teens.

On a technical level, this movie fails. On a faithful adaptation level, this movie fails. In many other ways, this movie fails. But I can't help but enjoy it because it's simply so different from all the other kid-friendly stuff that Marvel has made thus far.

To my surprise this version also has a sub-story with the rapper Coolio. This entire storyline was originally cut from the movie. Coolio plays a strung out drug addict. His acting in the movie is absolutely HORRIBLE!!! That is why his section was cut from the theatrical version.

This version is 30 minutes extra-long, but you are getting 30 minutes of complete garbage, that would normally be in the ""Deleted Scenes"" option. You know, that menu option that you might click on after you have completed watching the regular movie.

I HIGHLY ADVISE that you purchase the regular widescreen DVD version of this movie. It tells the story in a much better manner that makes sense.

Ben Affleck plays a good enough Matt Murdock and his costume looks better than the ones in the old comic books. The fight scene at the bar needed some editing but most of the other scenes were somewhat good to very good. Garner delivers an average performance as Elektra. One of the problems with this film is that there were several logic holes. See spoilers at the very end if you want to read about some of them. Good choice with darkness and lights. Pretty good soundt rack fitting the themes of Daredevil even if some of the lyrics are a bit too much on the nose. Jon Favreu plays the beloved sidekick Froggy, Colin Firth plays Bullseye, Michael Clarke Duncan plays the Kingpin, Erik Avari plays Elektra's father and Joe Pantoliono plays the intrepid reporter. Small appearance by Ellen Pompeo, as the secretary of Murdock and Froggy's firm, who would later star in ""Grey's Anatomy"". The Razzies nominated Affleck for worst actor but the nomination was unjustified. The budget for this film was $79M and made just a tad under $180M at the Box Office. Even though it did well there were a number of attempts to continue with the franchise but too many obstacles have yet to produce Daredevil 2. All said, a refresh to Daredevil is in the works and that's the main reason I watched this film again. SPOILERS: Elektra should have known she was fighting Matt long before she removed his mask; the fight scene between Matt and Elektra looked cool but a blind guy fighting it out publicly in front of a ton of kids is going to get passed around and then the secret identity is revealed.

For me a man who hunts down and tortured criminals by crippling them and then taunting them before a train hints them, just because the person was lucky enough to win against them in a court of law, is no hero at all.  Also wouldn't someone have noticed by now that anyone who wins against him in court seems to die about a night later?  I miss when Mat Murdock defended the innocent, not stalked and killed like a sadist like The Punisher.

Another issue I have is with Electra.  We're talking about a woman who started to beat up a blind man in a playground in front of children just because he followed her and was apparently crushing on her.  That's not even remotely sane.  What if he had just been some random blind man?

I laothe Collin Ferrell's acting, he was part of what destroyed Fright Night's remake (besides a terrible script).  This Daredevil movie was just horrible, pointlessly dark and twisted.

2276325,5,B0009B0GYA,"Where to begin? Well, first of all, as many others have already stated: Yes, the director's cut of Daredevil really is a vast improvement over the theatrical cut! I personally didn't hate the theatrical cut, but I did find it to be kind of mediocre. But that's not what we're here for, is it? The following review is for the Director's Cut blu-ray of the film:

VIDEO
I found the video quality to be absolutely stunning. I was especially surprised by this as it was only encoded at a bitrate of 20 Mbps. Whoever authored this disc did an excellent job. It's worth noting that while much of this film takes place at night, every scene in this movie still looks very crisp and clear. It's a 50 GB dual layer disc, and it's been used to its full advantage to deliver excellent video quality.

AUDIO
The audio options for this disc are: English DTS HD 5.1 Master Lossless Audio and English, Spanish and French 5.1 Dolby Surround. It sounds great to me, even though I don't own a fantastic sound system to play it on. I have no doubt this will sound amazing on a high quality sound system, but I will update this review if I ever find out otherwise.

SPECIAL FEATURES
This disc contains plenty to keep you occupied, mostly behind-the-scenes documentaries and other supplements of that nature. I haven't gone through all of them myself, but here is the Special Features list, as it appears on the box:

- Audio Commentary by Writer/Director Mark Steven Johnson and Producer Avi Arad
- Enhanced Viewing Mode - Takes You Behind the Scenes as You Watch the Film
- ""Beyond Hell's Kitchen: Making Daredevil"" Documentary
- ""Men Without Fear: Creating Daredevil"" Documentary
- ""Daredevil: HBO First Look"" TV Special
- Jennifer Garner Screen Tests
- ""Featured Villain: Kingpin"" Featurette
- ""Moving Through Space: A Day With Tom Sullivan"" Featurette
- ""Giving the Devil His Due"" Featurette
- 3 Music Videos, 5 Photo Galleries and More!

If I'm not mistaken, this release lacks some feature(s) that the Theatrical cut DVD has. That shouldn't deter you from this version though, because here you are still getting a pretty good amount of features with an arguably better version of the movie. I definitely see the special features as a huge plus for this blu-ray.

MISCELLANEOUS
- Subtitle options include English, Spanish, Cantonese and Mandarin.
- Closed-captioning is available, if needed.
- This is a minor detail, but it bugs me: On the back of the box, the year of release is incorrectly listed as 2002. The movie was actually released in February of 2003. This is honestly the only con I can think of for the entire disc.

CONCLUSION
This is a great release! Feel free to leave a comment whether you agree with me or disagree with me, or (especially) if there is something I have missed in this review.",1322092800,,2793,4.699386503067485

Here are some obvious comparisons
The Crow: Brandon Lee gets revenge on one of his killers and leaves a flaming crow as a calling card

Dare Devil: Ben afflac (yes the spelling is on porpose)kills a thug by tossing him into the tracks of an on coming train then a police detective throws a cigarette and lights up a flaming DD to reveal Dare Devil's calling card.

Then we see Dare Devil on a church roof top (clearly a tim Burton moment here folks!) How can you go from New York City by day to a fantasy Gothic city by night? Please explain this to me?

Why is Dare Devil sleeping in a coffin type chamber? Since when is Dare Devil a Vampire?

Why is Colin Farrell a lame Bullseye with a really bad irish accient?

Jennifer Garner (poorly casted)makes for a lame elektra with a lame back history. She's not a good actress anyway like EVERY ACTOR IN THIS POOR EXCUSE FOR A MOVIE!!!!!!!!!

Michael Clarke Duncan another miscasted actor in the role of the Kingpin.

The fight scene between Dare Devil anf Elektra is slow, predictable and unbelievably stupid. (when DD throws up his stick in the air then fights Elektra and after they pause he catches his stick! Give me a break!)

Another lame scene. When a young Matt discoveres his powers and magically knows how to do flips and know how to fight. REALLY?!!!!!

I can go on and on about this lame film but I digress. Don't waste your time or money on this lame excuse of a super hero movie.

I have to say that it is a way better movie than the released version but it still doesn't hold a candle to say Batman Begins, Spiderman or Iron Man. The main problems I have with this film are pretty obvious ones. First I was expecting more of a legal drama, second Daredevil has hightnened senses not super human abilities and last his cover identity as a blind man wouldn't be doing flips on a seesaw in the middle of a park in front of everyone.

2276333,5,B0009B0GYA,"Whenever people talk of the Daredevil Movie they talk of the average comic book action movie they saw in theaters quickly followed by a half witted Ben Affleck joke. The directors cut of Daredevil is a movie I would liken to Equilibrium, a really cool movie that almost nobody knows about. The Directors cut is a vastly superior movie to the average theatrical cut and nearly eight years later Marvel studios has yet to come up with a story that tops the plot of the Daredevil directors cut. most marvel movies concern black and white good guys and bad guys where Daredevil operates in the morally grey area of comic books. in fact if you watch the beginning of the movie you see a hero that is starting to go over the edge and might actually turn into a murderer type vigilante. when Matt Murdock meets Elektra it sets into motion a series of events that not only saves him but actually redeems Daredevil as a hero. so if you never actually have seen the director's cut I implore you to check it out, the story is improved and the action is ratcheted up and you may come away feeling you have seen a really good movie.",1293580800,,1119,4.4106280193236715
2276334,4,B0009B0GYA,"Superhero movies have become one of the highest-grossing genres in the moviemaking business and for good reason.  They provide fantastic escapism and bring the fantasies from the pages of comics to life.  One such film was the 2003 adaptation of Marvel Comic's character Daredevil.

Now, I'm sure I'll take some heat for this from fans of the comic, but I've never really enjoyed the Daredevil comics all that much; a red-horned wearing Stan Lee/Marvel rebuttal to DC's Batman.  This kept me from being interested in the comics, but I always enjoy a good superhero movie so I gave the film adaptation of Daredevil a shot.  Like many, I found the product disappointing...but then I discovered there was a Director's cut many claimed to be drastically different from the theatrical release I had witnessed...

That is correct.  The Director's Cut is indeed a whole other film that stands on its own as an engaging superhero flick.  I'll just have to summarize both versions without giving away too much- just so you can understand the differences.

Theatrical Cut: 2.5/5 Stars

This is the version of the film most people have probably seen and found to be severely disapointing.  It clearly tries to follow up Spider-Man with wall-to-wall special effect fights with gravity defying, Matrix-influenced fights.  The only real highlight is Colin Farrell as assassin Bullseye, whose over-the-top antics and remorseless killing make for quite a show.  Matt Murdock's (Daredevil) daytime career as a lawyer who stands for the little-man is totally glossed over in order to increase the action percentage and the Kingpin (played outstandingly by Michael Clarke Duncan) is so underdeveloped and unintimidating that he seems more like a glorified CEO than a prominent crime lord.

In its theatrical format Daredevil is a fairly typical superhero movie.  Wall to wall fantasy action with minor character development, but little soul; only good thing to be found here is the soundtrack which features some contemporary songs and a stylish directing style.

Director's cut: 4/5 Stars

Most of the flaws of the theatrical cut are resolved in this grittier version of the film.  This isn't one of those director's cuts like Alien Vs. Predator where they splatter some CGI blood but the final result still blows chunks.  No, this Director's Cut truly is an alternate cut that bears only a vague resemblance to the theatrical cut.

Allow me to list some reasons why this cut is vastly superior to the edition many of you saw in theaters back in '03.

1. Character development:  Matt Murdock is developed as a character and a lawyer instead of being simply the man in the red costume.  He is a conflicted individual who doesn't quite know yet what he wants to be; only that he wants to take down crime in whatever manner possible. The Kingpin is shown as a brutal crime boss who rules without remorse.  Electra is cut-back in this version, but this version of the film she really is only a supporting cast member (which I prefer because her character was the weakest part of the theatrical cut, in my personal opinion).  Only character without improvement is the over-the-top Bullseye, but this is for the best seeing as Farrell's character really does work best as a whimsical enigma (Farrell does however get to drop the film's single F-bomb).

2. New Scenes:  An entire subplot cut from the theatrical cut involves Matt Murdock represented a drug dealer (Coolio) who has been framed by the Kingpin for the murder of a prostitute.  This entire subplot works in developing a reason for Daredevil to want the Kingpin while in the theatrical cut it turns the hunt for Kingpin a simple revenge story of Daredevil getting angry over his murdered romantic lead.  Because of this the film takes on a new emotional depth.

3. Alternate Scenes:  Scenes such as the love scene between Affleck and him in confession have been removed from this cut of Daredevil .  Those tacked on, crowd-pleasing moments that seemed to drag down the pacing of the film have been removed from the director's vision of the film creating better flow along with giving the hero a more tragic story.

4. Fight Scenes:  Now, if you hated the Matrix/Spider-Man fight scenes from the theatrical cut I'm sorry to say those are still here.  I liked most of these fights (except the unnecessary one between Matt and Electra in the park which is just worthless filler) but the one that improves the most in this version is the climatic fight between Daredevil and Kingpin.  In the theatrical cut Kingpin is a pushover (in the theatrical cut you might as well turn the film off after Bullseye is taken out).  In the Director's Cut Michael Clarke Duncan takes the opportunity to remind us he was a professional bodyguard prior to breaking into the acting scene.  This is a brutal fight between a David and Goliath that doesn't let you down considering the way the film has built it up.

5. Tone:  This film is no Spider-Man.  Action scenes might be similar, but the tone of this Director's Cut makes a fine attempt at following the footsteps as such greats as The Crow.

6. Humor:  Even though this cut is far darker than the theatrical cut it also manages to insert a fair dose of brisk humor.  This allows leveling out the tension and making for a more exciting experience.  Action scenes are fun, but without interludes they just become boring, which was a primary problem with the theatrical cut.
Now, the Director's Cut is not without faults (hence why I only give it Four Stars).  It still suffers in the believability of its action scenes and the weak performances from Jennifer Garner, but overall it wins my approval.  Does that mean you'll like it?  Well, to put it in perspective I didn't necessarily ""hate"" the theatrical cut.  I just found it generic and dull.  Now, if you absolutely HATED the theatrical cut for its unbelievable action scenes, and the presence of Ben Affleck simply for being...Ben Affleck, odds are you will still detest this film.

 If you thought the theatrical cut was only a missed opportunity?  I suggest you pick up a copy of the director's cut and prepare to see this film in a whole new light!  It isn't perfect, but it is a magnificent improvement!",1276560000,,6232,4.829245283018868
2276335,4,B0009B0GYA,"Based on Frank Miller's run on Daredevil, Affleck plays Matt Murdoch, a lawyer who lost his sight in a horrible chemical accident. Out of that tragedy, all his other senses began working at super human levels. He also has the ability to see via sound, like some advanced sonar. The story begins with Daredevil badly injured and near death, as his life flashes before his eyes the story unfolds. As he recollects his tough childhood, the murder of his father and the death of his love Elektra (Garner), he realizes they all tie back to the Kingpin (Duncan). The masked avenger must find his last ounce of strength to face his toughest foe yet.

This movie will please any hardcore fan. Some of the images in this movie are ripped right out of the comics. I have seen both versions and the Director's Cut is far superior. A story arc is added that not only shows in detail the friendship between Matt and Froggy (Favreau), it also defines him as an attorney and provides a better sub plot to the Kingpin's control of all the crime in the city. The relationship between Elektra is also changed slightly. I don't provide more because I hate spoilers!

NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: It looks very good and the sound is excellent. All the special features of the Director's Cut are carried over. FINAL VERDICT: Hardcore fans should upgrade because the picture and sound are better. Casual fans, this is not upgrade worthy.",1275609600,,1415,4.633466135458168
2276336,4,B0009B0GYA,"An A-plus report card brings young Matt Murdock to the docks to show his father. All he ever wanted was to please his dad and, as per his father's advice, ""be a doctor, be a lawyer."" Except, stumbling upon his alcoholic, washed-up ex-boxer father as a leg breaker, Matt takes off on his skateboard in a hurry, only to accidentally run into a truck with barrels of radioactive liquid that--due to the forklift that just avoided him--has sliced the barrels open, the stuff inside spraying Matt in the face, causing him to go blind. But all is not darkness because he also mysteriously inherited a strange ""radar sense"" that enables him to see in a sort of X-ray way because of his newfound ability to convert sound waves into sight.

Him and his father vow to fix their relationship and their life, promise to never give up and be fearless, and embark on a journey to perfect themselves and hit the comeback trail--Matt via the books and honing his senses and disciplining his body; his father to enter the ring once more. With Matt by his side, Jack ""the devil"" Murdock makes good on that promise, but a fateful night in the ring changes everything and Matt promises from then on to stick up for those who can't defend themselves and watch out for the long shots like he and his father were.

Now, all grown-up, he's a lawyer by day and masked crimefighter by night. His name: Daredevil.

And he's not the only one who wants a piece of New York. Crime boss the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) is on the rise, as is his hired goon, Bullseye (Colin Farrell). Adding to matters, Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner)--a shapely martial arts master--has her sites on Daredevil (Ben Affleck) as well, leading us into a battle for New York, for vengeance, and for those who have been a victim of crime.

For some reason a lot of people didn't like this movie. I thought it was great. I liked the overall story; the costumes (except Bullseye's); the atmospheric New York City; the sense of darkness Matt Murdock carried within himself; Elektra's close relationship with her father; Foggy Nelson (Jon Favreau) and his being a ""come-with"" guy--very enjoyable. There was a sense of humanity about this version of Daredevil that I was able to relate to on a lot of levels.

The fight scenes were nothing short of amazing, especially that barroom brawl where Daredevil clears the room. I remember seeing that in the trailer and just being absolutely stoked.

Who cares that Kingpin was black? So what? The dude's one of my favourite actors and it was interesting to see him play the bad guy as he's usually the nice, innocent one, but for some reason people didn't like the character being black in this. It doesn't matter, folks. He did a good job.

The whole Matt Murdock-Elektra/Daredevil-Elektra relationship was well-handled, in my opinion, and I particularly enjoyed how those elements intertwined with each other throughout the film.

If I was going to criticise a few things--and while I enjoyed Daredevil's gallivanting throughout New York--his spinning jumps and aerial movies were very similar to Spider-Man's (who made his feature film debut the year before Daredevil came out), and some of the stuff Daredevil was able to do was pretty farfetched. I mean, I don't care how awesome you are at acrobatic stuff or if you're more fit than Bruce Lee on his best day, but falling face first toward a window washer's station at lightning speed won't get slowed down by doing a somersault in the air so you could land on your feet. You'd break your legs and die from the impact. But whatever. It's superheroes, so I overlook most of the impossible these guys accomplish. Just goes with the understanding superheroes can do things we can't, whether realistic or not.

That's really my only critique. I liked everything else. Wasn't crazy about Bulleye's costume. Would like to have seen him as more of a stealth assassin. I also don't read Daredevil comics so I can't tell you if this is a faithful adaptation or not. I know Daredevil's back story and a bit about some past adventures, but that's about it.

I haven't seen the director's cut of this either, so need to get around to doing that.

Still a good movie and I'm proud to have it in my superhero movie collection.

If you like superhero flicks, you'll like Daredevil.

2276338,1,B0009B0GYA,"Honestly, I don't think that there was a single person in the production or studio that was not completely drunk or high on cocaine. Compare this film with any other Marvel film (Except Punisher w/Tom Jane) That was crap too! Stan Lee is getting older and there seems to be a necessity to pump out as many of the comics with little or no disregard to the true and factual story-lines. This film was put together with names vs. characters. Ben, Jen, and Michael were all the hype to watch this film. Had this movie been released in the 80's or 90's I would have cried at the disgrace, but seeing as how anyone who owns anything worth any substance sells it like a Prostitute, I am not surprised.

2276349,2,B0009B0GYA,"I love superhero movies, but Daredevil is pretty mediocre. The character is much more violent than in the comics too.",1273708800,,117,4.9
2276350,2,B0009B0GYA,"First, let me clarify my preferences so the reader can understand where I am coming from in this review:
1) I like DD as a comic character, but don't follow him regularly. I do have a bunch of the Frank Miller books and love them. The DD Noir stuff is dead-onto the character, in my opinion.
2) I hated the theatrical version of this film. Boring, without plot, and seriously lacking in character development. The film is a giant pop-rock music video with PG-13 violence for the kiddies.

Okay, that said, I found this director's cut to be a bit of an improvement over the theatrical cut (T-cut from here). For one, there is a bit more plot which almost makes the characters interesting. There is a lot more Foggy Nelson and Ben Urich, two characters that were sorely missed in the T-cut. The majority of additions are a sub-plot that ties Kingpin to a supposedly open-and-shut murder case. It ultimately serves two purposes: a) to showcase Matt's talents as an attorney, and b) to show how the Kingpin's hand reaches into all aspects of the criminal justice system in NYC. Those are both worthy foundations for a better plot. We also get to see a bit more drama between Elektra and Matt, which is nice since the T-cut made it look like a love story instead of an inamourada tale.

Unfortunately, despite the improvements made in this cut, the film still suffers from its most fundamental flaw: Writer/Director Mark Steven Johnson. His ""ultimate vision"" of Daredevil is still a giant music video with no basic understanding of character. These are the problems that plague everything this man touches. He simply is a mediocre-at-best director and a terrible writer. Daredevil purists are going to have problems with the origin stories (or lack there-of in most cases), and general viewers are going to wonder how Elektra is a spoiled little rich girl and still a martial arts expert. Bullseye is still under-done and the Kingpin is never given the reverence he deserves. He is little more than a very wealthy bully in this film. Too bad.

Overall, I give this 2 stars. 1 star for the film itself, and 1 star for the effort to turn a piece of trash into a slightly less disgusting piece of trash. Mostly, this last star comes from the fantastic on-screen chemistry between Jon Favreau and Ben Affleck which is revived by this extended cut. I recommend this version of the film to anyone who liked the T-cut and also to those who feel the need, like I did, to try and give it one more chance not to be terrible.",1270080000,,2509,4.621076233183857

Surprisingly Ben Affleck Did A Great Portrayal of Matt Murdoch/Daredevil. and Collin Farrell As ""Bullseye"" is really good too. The Director's cut is just Coolio Added as a Story which could explain alot. Both versions are good. Buy both.",1263859200,,482,4.682352941176471
2276354,4,B0009B0GYA,"Okay, bad news first...  As much fun as the Daredevil character is, he isn't really a character that is suited for the silver screen.  Why?  Because his premise is admittedly far-fetched... even for comic books.  While most people would agree that the original PG-13 version of this film wasn't all that great (Colin Ferrell probably should have changed agents after that one), the storyline is actually reasonably fitting for the characters being used/abused.

Now the good news.  The rated R Director's Cut is actually a marked improvement from the theatrical release.  While it still isn't fantastic by any means, it is definitely a far more enjoyable and in-depth film.  Ben Affleck still can't act, Jennifer Garner is still little more than eye-candy, and Michael Clark Duncan is a much more intimidating Kingpin... but the added character development actually makes the little idiosyncrasies a little bit more fun to watch.  If you are considering giving the Daredevil movie a shot, do yourself a favor and get the director's cut.

2276356,5,B0009B0GYA,"I reviewed the theatrical cut of this movie a while back.  I didn't like it, to say the least.  I thought it was badly written, badly acted, and badly cast.  I stand by that review, but Amazon will only let me put up one review of this movie.  This movie and the theatrical cut are two different movies.  This movie is a huge missed opportunity, and it shows just how idiotic studio execs can be.

Daredevil is one of my favorite comic book superheroes.  He is a very unique and interesting character.  He is a crime-fighting vigilante by night, and a lawyer by day.  That is the cool thing about him.  You can have good Daredevil stories with super-villain fights, and good Matt Murdock stories that take place in and around the courtroom.  Personally, the Matt Murdock persona was always more interesting to me than Daredevil.  And this movie is a Matt Murdock story.  The plot of this movie was cut out of the theatrical cut.  Not a subplot, like it says on the back of the box.  THE plot.  The only thing left in the theatrical cut is a couple of subplots.  Matt Murdock agrees to defend Coolio (I don't remember the character's name), who stands accused of murdering a prostitute, Lisa Tazio.  That's the thing about Matt Murdock, he defends the people that no one else wants to defend.  He finds out from Ben Urich, a reporter, that Tazio had access to one of the Kingpin's men.  She was selling Urich information about Kingpin, and they killed her to shut her up.  Murdock realizes this and realizes that not only does this lead back to the Kingpin, but that Fisk is the one who killed his father years ago.  And it makes sense when Daredevil tells Fisk that ""the word's out on the Kingpin.""

Now that I have seen the actual movie, I have a completely different outlook on the casting.  Ben Affleck is an alright Daredevil, but a perfect Matt Murdock.  And to me, that persona is more important.  I like Jennifer Garner as Elektra, which is surprising because I did not like her in the theatrical cut.  And role was not cut down a whole lot in that version.  Fans have complained that this version of Elektra is not enough like the comic book character.  In the comics, Murdock and Elektra dated in college.  When her father was murdered, a torn Elektra left Matt.  He next sees her years later, when she has become a vigilante.  The film version of Elektra is partly based on Maya Lopez, aka Echo, from David Mack's run.  The similarities are unmistakable.  Her father is killed by the Kingpin.  She is manipulated into believing that Daredevil is responsible.  She also has a flirtatious relationship with Matt Murdock going on.  When she confronts Daredevil, she realizes that he is Matt Murdock and that he could not have killed her father.  Elektra in this movie is not exactly the same character she is in the comics, but at least they pulled her characterization from somewhere in the comics, not just out of thin air.  The biggest casting problem I had before is Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin.  Kingpin is my favorite Marvel villain, and second favorite comic book villain of all time.  He is a lot more suave in the comics, and he is a lot more in control.  This characterization of Kingpin is okay, though.  It is a new take on the Kingpin, while he still has certain elements of the comic book character.  His two best scenes were cut out of the theatrical version.  In his introduction scene, he sees in the paper that someone has been selling information about him to the papers.  So he kills both of the nearby bodyguards.  Most of his fight with Daredevil was cut out.  In that scene, Daredevil punches him in the face seven or eight times, and he isn't even staggered.  Probably the best casting are that of Foggy and Bullseye.  Colin Farrell was the one thing I liked about the theatrical cut, probably because none of his scenes were cut.  Jon Favreau, current director of the Iron Man movies, is a perfect pick to play Foggy.

There were some re-shoots for the theatrical cut, namely the confessional scene and the love scene with Elektra.  The latter scene is probably the worst thing about the theatrical cut.  In that cut, he hears someone getting beat up and wants to go help them, but opts to instead stay and have sex with Elektra.  In the Director's cut, he leaves her on the roof and goes to help the guy getting beat, showing that his role as Daredevil is more important to him than anything else.  When he talks to Foggy the next day, it finally makes sense why he is does not want to pursue a relationship with her.

I love this movie.  If you are a fan of the character, or just the superhero genre, check this out.  Sadly it was not released to theaters because of a pretty crappy producer who felt the movie needed to be cut down, and did not need a comprehensive story.",1261094400,,4817,4.501734104046243

I think this movie is more in line with Frank Miller's take on the character (which obviously a lot of reviewers either never read or don't remember) thats why its so dark and may remind some people of Batman (another character Miller took on).

The BluRay transfer is a good one and I like the Directors Cut (though I also did like the original version as well).  My only complaint is that we don't get to see Elektra in action that much. I think they really didn't do as much with her character as they should have which is why for some, her death didn't do much for them.

2276386,4,B0009B0GYA,"First off, this was a more complete version of the DVD which came out earlier. In this edition, about a half-hour of new material was added to the disc (and what was shown at the theaters.) Most reviews I read said it elevated this film from ""fair at best"" to ""good."" I agree. It made the movie much, much better.

Yeah, it's more far-fetched than the other superhero movies because here, the hero is a blind guy who, because of his blindness, has extraordinary hearing powers along with the rest of the usual Batman/Spiderman-type athletic skills.

As in most of the Batman films, this is a dark film. I think it would have been better had it lightened up a bit with a few jokes and a more wholesome female lead. Jennifer Garner is another one of these latter-day skinny chicks who is made to be tough-looking, tough-talking and tough-fighting. However, I will say she comes across a little more likable on the extended version. One more negative: the fight scenes go on a tad too long and are outlandish.

On the positive side, this may be the best-sounding DVD I own, at least up to ones I had heard up until this came out in January of 2005. Since the hero (Ben Affleck) has super hearing, this is emphasized in this movie and so you, if you have a 5.1 surround system, hear sounds from all speakers at almost times. It's awesome!

Affleck, meanwhile, is likable as the superhero and I liked the message he gives at the end about shunning revenge. Wow, you don't hear that much in movies. Kudos, too, to villains' Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan. They are fun to watch, especially Farrell.

So, if this superhero film interests you, make sure you get the ""Director's Cut"" edition. It's far better than the original, and, I believe, the same price.",1233705600,,1759,4.571428571428571
2276387,2,B0009B0GYA,"This film stinks. Ben Affleck stinks. Jennifer Garner stinks. The script stinks. And the director's really stinks up the place like a frat boy using your toilet after a particularly nasty chili cook-off and all-night micro-brewery tour. The difference is that this movie can't just be flushed and waved away with a potpourri-scented Glade plug-in. The only thing I like about this movie was the basic costume design and the fight scene in the bar. What's left is something like two hours of awful dialogue, stilted story, nightmarish melodrama and asinine posing. One of the few bright spots in this film, Colin Farrell, actually seems to channel the spirit of a vicious hit man who is extremely eccentric but falls down and hits his head on a toy bullseye from a Lego archery set....over and over and over..... Thankfully, this all takes place before the movie begins.

I sincerely believe that everything was taken out of this movie for it's the actual theatrical release was for the betterment of pacing, character and to reduce the embarrassment of all involved. Unfortunately the director after failing to convince the studio to release his cut by throwing a hissy fit, reminded them that releasing another version of the movie might squeeze a few hundred thousand dollars more out of the sad comic book fan market, and so they gave their blessing to the director's cut. Perhaps the studio heads should have considered the obvious threat of eternal damnation of their souls, but I suspect that at least a few of them had already had that part of their spiritual anatomy cut out and used to make CGI sparkles to enhance the next 200 million dollar Will Smith blockbuster. I hope it earned them a few points on the back end.

The film tells the ""story"" of a boy raised in hell's kitchen who is blinded by radioactive waste being driven through the streets on its way to being buried in drums in an even poorer neighborhood no doubt. Surprisingly instead of a horrible disfigurement and a lifetime of highly increased cancer risk, the boy develops the kind of abilities that human beings have spent thousands of years dreaming of attaining through hard work and understanding of their bodies, minds and spirits. If only those hard-working chumps had developed nuclear waste and gone skateboarding crazily like Bart Simpson through the streets of the inner-city they would have achieved their goals much faster. The boy chooses to grow up and be a superhero. But not just any superhero. A melodramatic, whining, emo chump of a superhero. When Bullseye turns up he at least has the good sense to be who he is without any drama-queen neuroses. One is almost tempted to root for Bullseye and end our suffering, take our hand, and lead us into a much cooler and less self-obsessed movie.

Unfortunately in the end of the hero wins. He beats the crap out of the bad guy and finally learns to ""love himself"".... at least until the next movie where he will be sure to find new reasons to mope without actually crying, which would probably be too much for the homophobic viewing audience to take; though they seem perfectly content with guys running around in leather outfits, making grand entrances, decorating their apartments with butch implements of war.... You get the picture.
In the end we are treated to an invitation to join daredevil leaping across the rooftops of New York City and have our hearts soar with him in triumph. I chose instead to purchase a wood chipper to Frisbee the DVD into with a flick of my wrist, and I must say that my heart did indeed soar in triumph.",1231804800,,3577,4.766129032258065

And why -- leaving aside the crappy script, muddled direction, abysmal acting, murky scenery and sound design -- do they have to muck around with the original plotline so much? Why not just tell the character's story the way it was originally written? It's a shame, really.

I wish Hollywood would quit writing and producing these things by committee, and let someone with real talent and vision take on the comicbook ouvre... The prefab, market-tested, throw-in-the-kitchen-sink-too approach simply does not work. Hey Hollywood: keep it simple. (Axton)",1228694400,,683,5.26605504587156

Collin Farrel was absolutely perfect as Bullseye.  His preformance was the best part for me.  I have some reservations regarding the decision to cast Ben Affleck as the lead.

The main thing lacking is back story.  They needed to show some more of Daredevil's training and explain about how he got his powers.  What they did show was just insufficient.  I don't buy that a 12-year old boy could train himself like that, even in a comic book.

I also did not like the obvious CGI effects, and there were too many gymnastics in a lot of the fighting scenes.

There is nothing special about the DVD.  Over all the film is entertaining and worth seeing and/or owning.",1226707200,,808,4.465753424657534
2276390,3,B0009B0GYA,"This film didn't have much of a chance when it came out.  Fans of the comic were disdainful of the casting choices, Ben Affleck was in a paparazzi mess with J-Lo, the theatrical cut was hacked up to appeal to a younger audience..

and yet, 5 years later, the director's cut is out on BluRay, and does not include the original theatrical version, a silent admission that Mark Steven Johnson's vision was the better of the two.

'Daredevil' is an unusual superhero movie.  It is a truer film-noir than most. The essential aspect of film noir not being just a dark visual palette, but a main character becoming more tightly ensnared in a web of tragedy that he can't escape from.  Matt Murdock loses his sight, his father, his love, and as the violence escalates, finds little but faith to console him, and asks if it's enough. In the opening shot, he is bleeding, clinging to the concrete cross of the catholic church, and the film backtracks from his origin to his character's 'Dark night of the soul'.

This reviewer found the vulnerability of the character, the fact that he's not 'super' much more interesting from an acting standpoint. Ben Affleck did get alot of bruises doing the stunts in the film and his performance has a true humility in certain scenes that hasn't been seen from him before or since.

It's not perfect, though.  There are many scenes that are meant to lighten the mood that seem sophomoric, Colin Farrel as Bullseye comes off as a psychotic irish clown rather than the smug, gritty villain he was on the page, Elektra gets nearly no backstory here that would add depth to her(though Jennifer Garner is certainly no slouch on the athletics). The restored plotline of the murder of prostitute Lisa Tazio makes the final fight between Daredevil and Kingpin alot more meaningful, but it lacks oomph... the film is trying to sell you the idea that by looking out for the little guy, you can beat the big guys.. and the origin scene punches this theme.. as does the finale.. it just stumbles a little with it in between.

Blame Marvel for the issues, though. You can glimpse brilliance all throughout this picture, if only they had let the director do his job without burying the whole thing in marketing.

As for the transfer, this film has never looked or sounded better, the night scenes are perfectly lit, very sharp, and the sound design, particularly in the 'radar sense' sequences is stunning in 5.1.

Like the comic book character himself, this film is flawed, yet has hidden excellence(I privately add one star).",1225843200,,2541,4.713318284424379
2276391,4,B0009B0GYA,"Director Mark Steven Johnson truly explores the shadowy aspects of justice and vigilantism in the additional 30 minutes added to the film, along with some other tweaks.

The scene which didn't make the final cut from producer Gary Foster and 20th Century Fox studio is attorney Matt Murdock (Daredevil) - portrayed by Ben Affleck - defending a murder suspect, who is played by rapper Coolio. The violence is also amped up which earned the revised film an ""R"" rating, a path not taken to movie theaters by comic book super heroes and movie studios.

Colin Farrell (Bullseye) and Michael Clarke Duncan (The Kingpin) are excellent in their roles as villains, with Jennifer Garner (Elektra Natchios) able to show a different side of the character in this grittier version. Director's have to be daredevils at times in the editing process and this Director's Cut aptly shows - again - who knows best when it comes to delivering a solid film.",1225411200,,936,4.880503144654088

If one complains that the bass is ""boomy"" it is because their SUB cannot handle the volume of EXTREME lows. From the opening credits and all throughout this film my concrete foundation shook with clean powerful gut-punching bass. The 24 bit DTS HD MA sound is reference quality. The sound design is reference quality. The use of surrounds is in a word ""involving"". It draws one into the action. Subtle (and not so subtle) surround usage brings the action aggressively into your room. You will find yourself ducking as Bullseye works his evil, deadly aim. If you can, engage the EX on your system, you will add another dimension to this excellent soundtrack. (In addition to my system sub, I have a 15"" sub dedicated to the ""surround"" channels that thunders with this track)

And while the video is not quite up to the audio standard, this film, which is shot mostly at night, reveals very good shadow detail and exhibits inky blacks without black crush. Day shots can be soft, but not enough to distract. The FX of Daredevil's ""radar"" sound produces a CGI visual explosion as it details what his visual mind extracts from his ultra sensitive hearing.

The director's cut explores more character development than the theatrical cut. It makes the storyline more personal on all levels. It reveals the ""story"" behind the story. The pace is somewhat slower, but that slower pace raises the tension in the action scenes. Getting the detail on a character's motivation simply makes for better story telling. If you're looking for non-stop slam bang comic book action, then you might want to stay with the theatrical cut, which unfortunately is not available at this time on BD.",1224633600,,1830,4.843450479233227
2276393,1,B0009B0GYA,"There are rumors circulating that the director's cut of Daredevil is much better than the theatrical version.  Further, they say this fixes many problems in the movie.  The theatrical version was poor because the bad studio execs made bad decisions about the final cut.

On the strength of these rumors, I bought a copy of this Blu-ray.  I wish I hadn't.  I am hear to tell you that all these reports are nothing in the world but a bunch of codswallop, poppycock, blarney and balderdash.  In every respect, the director's cut is worse than the theatrical version of the movie, not better.

The movie does not benefit at all from the extra thread including the trial of Coolio.  The studio was correct in discarding all those scenes.  It was a totally unnecessary plot thread, containing a lot of bad scenes full of bad dialog, badly delivered.  Including these bad scenes of bad dialog does not help resolve anything.  Rather, it creates a cheap, ""made for TV"" feel that was common with CBS movies in the 1970s-1980s.  It is paced like a snail, and feels way too long with this extra 34 minutes of footage.

The movie failed because Colin Farrel sunk the picture.  The quivering and shivering idiot he played was not Bullseye.  Also Michael Clark Duncan was a poor choice for the Kingpin.

After viewing the director's cut, I can say I categorically agree the studio's decision to cut all those scenes.  It was better before.",1223424000,,1425,4.704453441295547

I liked Daredevil because he was different with his disabilities (blind and mortal) and strengths ('radar-sense' and martial arts style of moving and fighting). I thought the film was a great version of my favorite underdog hero. There's a dark feeling in the look and story of this 'early wire-swinging' hero. A earthy cross between Batman and Spiderman with a realistic approach that is almost noirish. The picture and sound are BluRay bests! Basically, Daredevil is a blind stick fighter, who is so hyper-sensitive, that he has to medicate himself and get into a isolation tank, to get any sleep. And he's got a girl. Give DAREDEVIL a chance.",1223164800,,683,4.896551724137931
2276395,3,B0009B0GYA,"That title is not a question; it's a statement, because I'm going to tell you what I think ruined this movie.  It wasn't Ben Affleck.  As far as well-known actors go, he performed quite well in a niche role.  It wasn't Michael Clarke Duncan.  Even thought the Kingpin is white in every other version, what big white guy are you going to get to play the role as well as Duncan did?  Turning a white character black is not a concern for me; they're doing it with Nick Fury for the Ultimate Avengers, and it works.

No, the problem with this film is two-fold: Jennifer Garner and Colin Farrell.  Or maybe it should be Jennifer Garner and Mark Stephen Johnson.  Well, whoever's responsible for the crap-tastic versions of Elektra and Bullseye, they're responsible for the lameness of ""Daredevil.""

Jennifer Garner is just not a good actress.  She looks nice, but that's it.  Her portrayal of Elektra was such a deviation from the original character; she's too outgoing, too nice, too kind-hearted.  She's Greek, but she can't even speak to her father in their native language, even when he speaks it to her?  She also talks too much.  And couldn't they have at least dyed her hair black?  This is like making Jean Grey a blonde; you don't do it.

Maybe Colin Farrell isn't to blame for Bullseye's failure; maybe he was just doing as directed.  Either way, he took an already cinematic character from the comics and made him so incredibly generic.  Bullseye's cocky and talkative; Farrell was soft-spoken and had an accent (Don't try to tell me he can't fake an American accent.  ""Phone Booth"").  I understand that the comic book version of Bullseye wore a silly spandex outfit that wouldn't look good on film, but couldn't they have done better than a trench coat?  Go play ""The Punisher"" video game that came out in 2005 to see a perfect representation of Bullseye that would have worked for the film.  To bad Garth Ennis didn't work on this film.

I'm interested in seeing Director's Cut, but I see no way it will change my opinion on the failings of these two characters.  Maybe I'll just skip around their scenes.",1222646400,,2113,4.648648648648648

2276397,4,B0009B0GYA,"It certainly is this time around.

Daredevil - the Director's Cut, is what the theatrical release was intended to be, when the film was being made. Contractual obligations kept the film from being released in theaters as R-rated, opting instead to cut out many key sequences to achieve a PG-13 rating. This version carries a good deal more weight behind it, with a greatly expanded-upon story and adding back in character development scenes. The movie still struggles through the awkward and out-of-place playground fight scene which is so very out-of-character for Matt Murdock, but the rest of the film hits much closer to home for the horned protaganist.

Ben Affleck makes a surprisingly good attempt at portraying Murdock/Daredevil, in this action-adventure film. His scenes as Murdock w/the affable ""Foggy"" Nelson are a pleasure to watch, but he's able to make the transition to the grim and all-too-breakable vigilante, as well. Michael Clarke Duncan's turn as a street-grown version of the Kingpin is interesting and works well enough within the framework of the story, that the departure from the character's origins is negligible for all but the truly hardcore. More-involved fight sequences and fewer romance scenes give this version of the film better pacing and help to center the viewer on the character of Murdock/Daredevil, rather than his relationship w/ hum-drum Jennifer Garner and her less-than-stellar tv actor-quality performances and fight scenes.

Overall, this film is still flawed and an uninspired take on the character of Daredevil and the stories of Hell's Kitchen, but it is a far cry better than the theatrical release. In comparison to it's theatrical release, this film is on a whole new level. Fans of Daredevil and comics in general will be able to enjoy this film, despite it's numerous flaws.",1222128000,,1829,5.193220338983051
2276398,5,B0009B0GYA,"Finally!

Having grown up reading the comic from the Frank Miller era it would be fair to say I was a fan long before the film arrived. Having seen the studio release when it first came out I enjoyed the film but certainly felt it was missing something. That something that was missing has been judiciously amended in the Directors Cut of which this review comprises.

The Directors Cut proves yet again that studio's don't know as much as they think they know about the movie going audience. The decision to cut important character development, sub plot and themes which serve to enhance and underpin the Daredevil story merely reveals this flawed 'think tank in a bubble' aspect of the industry. What is put back into the film is a crucial 30 minutes of footage that was initially deemed superfluous to the action - not by the director it must be said but rather the studio heads.

The difference between Daredevil the Studio release to the Directors Cut is glaring and in the case of the latter what we are presented with is a Marvel superhero film of great depth and action combined. This is the way intelligent audiences always want their Marvel films - the studio's seem to miss this at times and assume we all just want action without storyline or character development ... how wrong they are!

A great deal of what initially fell to the cutting room floor was the story of Matt Murdock's ( Daredevil by day ) legal business partner Foggy played by Jon Favreau. It would have been criminal for this footage to never see the light of day as Jon Favreau brings a much needed light and contrast to the darker aspects of the films mood which also serves as exposition for what passes for Matt Murdock's normal day to day life as a lawyer. Through Matt's exchanges with Foggy we are also able to witness a more three dimensional and human side to Daredevil. Without Foggy we'd have a 2D superhero that not even the comics presented but which the studio's saw fit to provide us with in their chosen release! Are you listening film makers?

The treatment of Daredevil overall is pretty well spot on as we get to see his origins as a young boy growing up in New Yorks Hell's Kitchen, the son of a working class single parent who is a boxer down on his luck.
There are plenty of clever nods to the Comic reading audience with the various names of fighters being the names of artists in Marvel who worked on Daredevil over the years. We get a nice cameos from Stan 'the man'Lee and one other absolute classic appearance from a Daredevil artist later in the film in a scene with Ben Urich, played by the great Joe Pantolano.

Ben Afleck does a great job playing Matt Murdock as does the stunning Jennifer Garner who plays what must be the ultimate film version of Elektra. Both of them put a great deal of work into training martial arts with the likes of Jeff Imada ( Bourne Identity ) and Wu Ping ( Crouching Tiger et al ) but I did feel the fight scene with Murdock and Elektra in the school playground was the weakest of the fight scenes in the entire film ... frankly it looked very stiff and not particularly fluid as it should have been. In the 2 disc version of the Directors Cut that I have we see the Chinese wire crew performing the fight scenes as they worked them out in Hong Kong using only handycams. What we see in these rough cuts is the difference between Martial Artists/Athletes and actors! Having said all this the rest of the fight scenes in the film were excellent and very well choreographed and performed.

Michael Clark Duncan is superbly well chosen to be the giant mob boss King Pin and the director was absolutely correct in ignoring skin colour and instead making sure that the spirit of King Pin was served through the right man playing the role ... he does indeed bring the gargantuan quality to King Pin to the big screen.

Colin Farrell as Bullseye is actually very good indeed and as he says himself, he 'camps it up' as that is exactly what we would expect from a complete psychopath like Bullseye. Having Farrell play himself as Irish was the best move yet and he brings something very nasty to the role even though his character is so over the top. When we finally get to the crucial Frank Miller scene with Elektra and Bullseye it really is quite gut wrenching and Farrell delivers a kiss of death that saw the film elevated to an R rating based on this act alone! Not that I felt an R rating for this scene was justified but I agree that for younger audiences it is quite a powerful scene and can see why they may have given it an R.

Jenifer Garner as I said earlier is absolutely stunning as Elektra and is certainly not just a pretty face. She brings a visceral quality to Elektra that certainly brings her to life in way Daredevil fans could have only hoped for - her weapons work in the film is very well done and is to be commended.

All in all Daredevil the Directors Cut builds beautifully as it was supposed to have done and runs in at 128 mins which for me was not overly long at all. I will say it again, an audience would happily sit through an extra 30 minutes of footage that brings essential character development to a film and adds depth to the storyline. Rather than sit through a dissatisfying action film which runs in 30 minutes shorter and makes little sense of the overall theme it should serve as testimony to the fact that this kind of thinking from studios is a false economy.

We can have our popcorn and eat it too ... the Directors Cut gives you exactly that!",1219622400,,5523,4.420845624385447
2276409,4,B0009B0GYA,"First of all, I was never a reader of the comics, and didn't know much about daredevil before venturing into the cinemas to see the original when it was released. At the time, there wasn't much action out and i like most of Ben Affleck's movies, so though i would give it a go. Although i liked the theatrical release ( but didn't love it) i still bought it when it came to DVD...and to be honest, when i watched it the 2nd time on DVD, i didn't think as much of it, as when i left the cinema.

So when i heard the directors cut was out, and people who hated the first release, but liked the 2nd one, i thought wow, i didn't mind the first, perhaps i will really like the new version. and guess what? I did ! Its absolutely fantastic. After the characters were fleshed out more, the storyline was more involved and filled in the plots- you actually cared about what happened and got more into the feel of being apart of what was going on in hell's kitchen.

If you watch the ""featurette"" : giving the devil his dues, you will understand that Mark Johnson the director, absolutely loves this material, loved the comic, and was disappointed himself with the theatrical release. He understood why the critics & fans alike didn't support it, and really wanted to fix the problems with this DVD. When will Hollywood studios & executives learn, a 100 minute movie, does not mean a better movie - and when will they learn that audiences DO want more than just action - we can think, you morons! And can hold our attention for more than 100 minutes. Here's a simple plan for your money making schemes - and this goes to Gary Foster ( producer who still says the theatrical version of daredevil is better) If you make a GOOD MOVIE, that gets good reviews, and that fans & critics enjoy, then more people will see it, more people will see it a 2nd time, more people will recommend it to friends, and that means a bigger audience, a repeat audience and bigger dollars for your pockets ! So while the first was a quick paced movie that made quick bucks, a longer - more thought-out MOVIE, would have garnered longer life at the box office.",1219190400,,2127,4.3686868686868685

2276411,5,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil has been in the Marvel Comics Universe since 1964. In that time, he's gone through many changes. (The same can be said for just about any comic super hero.)

It's a great challenge to create a Super Hero movie. The movie must appeal to a wide range of viewers, ranging from those of us who were there in the beginning, to those who've seen the comics in the decades since, and those who've never read the comics.

In my opinion, the best super hero movies honor the comic book image of the character. Again, that's not easy if the character has changed over several decades.

When I heard about this movie, I was skeptical.

Ben Affleck as Daredevil?! Isn't he too thin?! (I remember the Johnny Romita version of Daredevil.)

The entire cast was well-chosen. Ben Affleck & Jennifer Garner were great together as Daredevil and Elektra. Michael Clarke Duncan was great as Kingpin, and Colin Ferrell was great as Bullseye.

Affleck having to do fight scenes with her. The ending just isn't your  ""Kill Bill"" blood everywhere revenge. It is a sad story with an kind of upbeat point of view with a mystery of the Mother's necklace.
From a Marvel comics point of view, it is an upgrade for the second line superhero, the Daredevel, to put him in the ranks of Spiderman and Batman.
Ben Affleck is too gentle a fellow for this type of role and probably shouldn't have been cast for it: he is more a Gary Cooper type ""reluctant hero"" than the revenge crazed blind man.

No more wishy-washy morale and illogical sex scene in this one. And all the elements of the theatrical releases are actually put in the right order as well, so that you aren't left wondering why on Earth did Matt wear a grey suit in the morning and is shown later in the evening in a black one when he leaves office.

And for those who like me felt that Jon Favreau's role as Foggy got really truncated and should have been more, well the director's cut deliver, he is brilliant in his comical relief role and will have you laugh all through that otherwise dark and intense movie.

2276415,4,B0009B0GYA,Daredevil is by no means a perfect film but when it comes to eye candy films I take them for what they are which is eye candy. Ben Affleck plays Matt/DD very well he actually surpised me with his performance. The film has a dark tone and isn't all colorful like Spider Man was. Colin Farrel and Micheal Clarke Duncan as the villians do good jobs but Colin steals the show as Bullseye. In my opinion Farrel did one of best comic book villain jobs since Jack as The Joker. When it comes to Jenifer Garner as Elerkta she did a good job she's sexy as always. My only complaint with the film was I feel it needed more action but I'm guessing since this wasn't a hit then we won't get sequel with loads of action. It's a fun film just don't take it seriously.,1206489600,,753,4.164383561643835
2276416,4,B0009B0GYA,"Marvel comics has launched an assault on moviegoers with a line up of films that are about to undue the bar set by DC comics' BATMAN and SUPERMAN. The success of SPIDERMAN set about a bidding war that resulted in several of their titles being picked up and work is in progress on a number, including IRON FIST and THE PUNISHER. But before those two ever hit the screen, anther title made its way and did well- DAREDEVIL.

Ben Affleck stars as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer who has abilities that offer him more sight than any other mere mortal. As a youngster, Matt was injured in a freak accident that left him blinded. But the chemicals that robbed him of his sight also gave him greater gifts, a sharper sense of hearing and a sort of radar sense.

When his father, a boxer who refused to throw a fight and lose in front of his son, is murdered, Matt dedicates himself to fighting for justice. Developing his senses, his mind and his body, Matt becomes a lawyer who defends those without hope. And at night, he becomes Daredevil, donning a red leather costume and disguise as he tracks down those who evaded justice by twisting the law.

In his daytime guise, Matt meets and falls for a woman named Elektra (Jennifer Garner), the daughter of a wealthy man who is a cohort of the infamous Wilson Fisk ( ), an underworld leader known as the Kingpin. It is the Kingpin who has been moving into the neighborhood Daredevil protects, the Hell's Kitchen area of New York, Matt's childhood home.

When Elektra's father is murdered by Kingpin's assassin Bullseye (Colin Ferrell), the hit is made to appear as if it was done by Daredevil. Trained in numerous martial arts herself, Elektra sets out on a course for revenge against Daredevil, never realizing who he is or how innocent he might be. And while she pursues him, Bullseye sets his sights on her.

More story involving Kingpin and Daredevil in one rivalry and Bullseye and Daredevil in another keep the plot going and offer a chance to find out the character motivations of the man beneath the mask.

Filled with religious icons aplenty and morals not often found in most stories today, DAREDEVIL offers plenty of action but with something solid beneath it all. Affleck does a great job in the lead role, offering a caring daytime persona and a fear influencing sight to see at night. Garner is superb while looking the part of the object of Matt's infatuation one minute and the avenging angel of death the next. The standout performance here though is Ferrell as Bullseye, a maniac from top to bottom with a wry sense of humor that will have you laughing while being glad he doesn't really exist at the same time.

Perhaps the most important aspect of this film, at least for comic fans, is the fact that this movie looks exactly like a comic book come to life. The images seen are sometimes used from the actual comic, including some created by Frank Miller and Joe Quesada in their runs as artists on the book. Daredevil standing atop a church, arms around a cross in the dark of night are both eerie and offering a glimpse of the motivations of the man without fear.

If you're looking for a fun movie, dark and light, filled with story as well as action, then you'd be hard pressed to find one more filled with both than this one.

A large number of fans and critics alike pounded on this movie when it was released. I challenge them to go back and watch it again. To me this movie holds up better than the last two Spider Man flicks. See what you think.",1205366400,,3511,4.5078616352201255
2276417,3,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil, the Man Without Fear, should probably be described as one of Marvel's lesser superheroes; at least, nobody has yet penned a Complete Guide to him, as they have to Spiderman, X-Men, and the Fantastic Four, who have also been given filmic incarnations.  And on the whole, so far, I think their versions are better than his.  DD, like Spiderman, calls New York his hunting ground, and like Spidey he is perceived as a vigilante.  But when DD is ""at work,"" he's all business--there's no humor or lightness to what he does at all, and unlike Spidey, he often sets out specifically to kill those he sees as transgressors against justice.  His motivations are to some extent understandable--his alter ego, Matt Murdock, is an attorney whose father, a boxer trying for a comeback, was murdered on the night of his great triumph, and Matt himself, as a boy, was often a target for bullies--and even laudable to anyone who has grumbled about people ""getting off on technicalities"" or ""beating the system.""  And, as is shown in an early courtroom system, Matt's superpowers, which include greatly enhanced hearing, serve him as a kind of biological lie detector: when an accused rapist claims on the stand that his victim ""enjoyed it,"" Matt knows by the rate of his heartbeat that he's lying.  Still, this is a very dark, violent film, and not one that I could really enjoy.  To be sure it has its moments: the early flashback to Matt's boyhood, showing his strong bond with his father, how he got his powers, and how he began to train them; the beautifully choreographed ""fight"" between Matt and the love of his life, Electra Nathios, on the day they meet; Daredevil's heart-stopping leaps from New York's towering buildings.  And villain Bullseye is a very creepy psycho--just the kind of person you don't want to meet in a dark alley.  At the end, though, I found myself wondering about questions that weren't addressed.  How did an orphaned kid from a poor neighborhood find the money to go to college and law school?  Why and when did Matt/Daredevil confide in his local priest regarding his secret identity?  How does an attorney whose partner gripes (good-humoredly) about their heavy load of pro bono cases afford Matt's sleek, high-tech, almost Fortress-of-Solitude-ish apartment?  Why, when he wants to go to sleep (as opposed to sleeping *with* somebody), does he submerge himself in what appears to be a coffin filled with water?  How did Matt explain the wound drilled through his shoulder by Electra's sai?  Any of these questions could have been answered very simply with a line or two of dialogue.  It's the business of a movie to make its ""world"" real to its viewers, to be plausible within the parameters of the universe it's set in; if it's fantasy, that's one thing, but the Marvel movies are supposed to take place in a reality only a step or two sideways from our own.  When the filmmakers don't seem to care enough about their reality to ""make it real,"" they spoil the movie for me.  So this is a DVD I *won't* be buying, and not one that I can recommend.",1203033600,,3078,4.74296435272045
2276418,1,B0009B0GYA,A world where Ben Affleck is a superhero could only be Sesame Street.

2276429,5,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil The Director's Cut is kind of a redemption film for me.  I know Mark Steven Johnson wishes he released this film into theatres instead of the ""cut & stitched"" abridged version that didn't impress most.  After seing this film, I treat it as the original faithful artwork, while the theatrical release is just an imposter.
So many great elements were lost from this film.  All the extra material definately raises the movies credibility and worth.  And all for what? We cut it out to save bathroom breaks?  And we added a sex scene to appeal to lovers and perverts?  In my opinion, some of the artistic bits were cut from the film, in attempt to ""Hollywoodize"" the flick.
The Director's cut is the fan's movie.  I may be biased being a fan of comic book movies, but I think anyone could agree that the pieces taken out were not only to satisfy fanatics, but they were important building blocks to these characters and stories.
Every character has more meaning: Dardevil has a stronger relationship with her father, Elektra shows more of her Greek culture, Kingpin displays more cruelty, Bullseye becomes a better villain.  And did anyone say ""Hey I saw Coolio in the trailer! Where the heck did he go?""  Well he's in this film and he's actually not a bad actor at all.  And finally, for those that wished there was more humourous dialogue between Foggy and Matt, your dinner is served.  I think the old/new jokes are funnier than the originals.

Bottom Line: See Daredevil in an entirely new movie.  If you were dissapointed by the '03 film, then pick this up and I guarantee it will show itself as the ""better"" film.",1201737600,,1625,4.63986013986014
2276430,2,B0009B0GYA,"The theatrical cut of Daredevil is garbage compared to the director's cut.  If you watch the Director's cut you will see that many great pieces of the movie were robbed by the producers.  Important chemistry between young Matt and his Father was lost in the final cut which was essential to the development of both those characters.  Catchy dialogue was cut out that remained in the Director's cut, like ""Time to give the Devil his due.""  Pieces of fight scenes were cut out for time, which any fan would be displeased with.  Also, a whole sideplot with the Lisa murder and Coolio's character did not make it to the final cut.  This whole sideplot was very important to Daredevil's character as a lawyer and the audience was robbed of their movie.

So what did they add to the theatrical cut?? A love scene.  That's it! Someone guessed that millions of fans and the general audience would need a love scene to survive through a superhero movie.  When actually this scene ruined the pace.  In the director's cut, Daredevil says ""I have to go,"" because he hears someone getting beaten in an alleyway.  In the theatrical version he decides ""Well sleeping with Elektra sounds better than fighting crime.....so why not?""

When I look at both films I think the theatrical version is the movie that deserves bashing from critics, because the Director's cut has so much more to offer.  It's not some UNRATED marketing scheme.  It's really an attempt to save the cut of the film that Mark Steven Johnson meant for his audience.  The Director's Cut is a honorable and loyal adaptation, while the Theatrical cut is Cut & Pasted in an attempt to appeal to more audience and pump more money in.

See the movie the way it was meant to be seen.  Get the Director's Cut.  It is NOT a scheme to just obtain more money.  It actually has around 30 minutes of additional scenes.  Don't cheat yourself.  Get the better version.",1201564800,,1906,4.6467065868263475

Affleck & Garner are great together. Michael Clarke Duncan is strong. Whenever life is walking all over me, I just watch any scene with Bullseye & laugh my a** off, get back in the groove. I have no idea why this movie didn't sell more tickets. It is a super great presentation of the comic!",1199664000,,555,4.398058252427185
2276432,2,B0009B0GYA,"Before I go into any kind of criticism I wanted to make sure I pointed out the good in Daredevil, because there's really a lot there to enjoy.
I LOVED ... I mean ... LOVED the origin story in the beginning. It was PERFECT absolutely perfect. I can't say it enough, although a character or two was missing, they perfectly captured the spirit of what made Daredevil such an appealing character.

The casting was pretty good.  I know I'm going against the grain on this one, but, in my opinion, I thought Ben Affleck was a terrific Matt Murdock/Daredevil. I felt that although Jennifer Garner looked amazing as Electra, her performance came across a little rigid, as if she couldn't relax into the role. Colin Ferrell was hysterical as Bullseye. Ferrell was clearly having the time of his life making the movie. Michael Clarke Duncan was OK as Kingpin, he certainly brought the correct physical presence to role role, if nothing else ...

The stunts and 'shadow-vision' and effects, I enjoyed them all. I also LOVED all of the little nods to the comic book readers such as Frank Miller and Kevin Smith's cameo, seeing long-time artist John Romita's name as Jack Murdock's opponent.

I loved the coy interaction between Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson or Matt Murdock and Electra. I ate it all up, I just couldn't get enough.

But of all the things they could have possibly slipped on, how did they actually slip on the character of Daredevil? They turned him into Batman for God's sake! Daredevil isn't a dark brooding anti-hero and he certainly isn't a murderer. He's the guy you see leaping off of a twenty-story building without a net with a big grin on his face. He's Spiderman without the Spider.

I was actually heartbroken that they had built up this insane amount of positive momentum and then lost it all when they turned Daredevil into a cold-blooded killer. I know they incorporated it into the storyline of Daredevil ""finding himself"" but it was just so far out of his character it bordered on being unforgivable for me. Try as I might I really had a hard time getting past it; especially in light of how much they got right.

It is as if they found a bad compilation cd on the ground in a highschool parking lot and decided, hey, lets use this instead of some composer and his crummy orchestra. I bought this movie hoping they would have cut out the horrible electra love scenes and changed the music but they hadn't.

2276436,3,B0009B0GYA,"Several years ago, it is quite likely that you were one of the millions who bought a ticket to see X-Men or Spiderman in the theater. The massive success of these two movies convinced studio execs that the public was desperate for any and all things Superhero. In short, it is because of you, yes you, that the film Daredevil darkens our world.

Daredevil tells the story of lawyer Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), who due to a childhood accident involving toxic chemicals has no fear. He is thus able to leap off of skyscrapers and land on the ground without shattering his tibias. Along the way he encounters Elektra (Jennifer Garner), who he fights on a teeter-totter, Bullseye (Colin Farrell), who embraces every stereotype about the Irish, (namely that they have really good aim) and Michael Clarke Duncan, who plays against character for once, in his groundbreaking role as A Really Big Guy.

Only a fool would choose to leap headfirst into such a world of second tier heroes on his own, and Mike, despite voluntarily spending hours of his time watching Daredevil, is no fool. So his good friends Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy, (who are both also Men Without Fear) are all along for the ride.

2276437,5,B0009B0GYA,"Now that Amazon has finally created a separate page for the Director's Cut I can finally go ahead and review it without running the risk of this review being pooled with the reviews for the inferior theatrical release.

Okay, moving on. I didn't know anything about the Daredevil character when I first saw the theatrical release of this movie, and while I found the premise of the character quite intriguing, the movie left me lukewarm, at best. Having said that, it was still better than I had expected in light of the poor reviews. However, being a fan of the genre (I was ""raised"" on the Superman movies of the late seventies and early eighties), I decided to check out the Daredevil Director's Cut when I heard about how different it was from the original. My first reaction? Well, not until I actually saw the DC did I realize just how badly the powers-that-be managed to butcher this movie for its theatrical release. I, in fact, found the DC to be such a vast improvement that I started reading the comics. And now, after having read through almost the entire run of Daredevil, I can still say that I remain a fan of this movie, and have become a huge fan of the character.

People who absolutely hated the theatrical release will not like this cut, but they will certainly hate it a little less. People who found the original to be ""okay,"" will most likely be impressed. This doesn't mean that this movie is perfect (my five stars are a reflection of my enjoyment of the film, not its actual merits). There are many scenes that make me cringe, and the infamous ""playground scene"" is as ridiculous in this cut as it is in the original. The acting is a little uneven, even though I generally like Affleck's take on the character. The fact that he is stellar in some scenes lets you forget about the scenes that are not as well acted. While many of the things I find goofy about this movie (such as the mandatory ""trying-out-my-weapons warm-up scene"" and the silly catch phrases) are very typical of the comic book movie genre, the strength of this movie lies in its ability to transcend said genre and become something more. The action scenes are pretty good, for the most part, but this movie is ultimately not really an action movie. People looking for straight action should look elsewhere.

Instead, this movie is the best combination of action, drama, comedy, and crime that I have ever seen. It actually manages to be both funny and tragic at the same time in a way that is actually believable, in part due to the inherent contradictions of the main character. He's the lawyer who is also a vigilante, and a man haunted by tragedy and guilt who also manages to be a witty romantic and optimist. There is also the unusual (though doubtlessly successful) premise of a superhero with a disability.  The blindness angle is actually played up a little bit more in the movie than in the comic book, even though the difference lies more in how they have chosen to present the character than in his inherent abilities.

To sum up a long review, if you want to see an unsual comic book movie that is so much more than a comic book movie, this is the one for you. If you are looking for straight action, look elsewhere. I, for one, love this movie - warts and all.",1187568000,,3267,4.521150592216582

2276492,4,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil is a better superhero film than most people give it credit for. The direction isn't outstanding, but it's certainly more than competent, and the special effects are quite novel. Ben Affleck, once you get past the personal baggage the actor brings to every role he plays, is an effective Matt Murdock. Jennifer Garner is also strong as Elektra, just please remember to skip that horrid spin-off movie she did. The rest of the cast is an A-list of stars: Colin Farrell, Michael Clarke Duncan, Joe Pantoliano. All are great, and help ground the story emotionally.

The problem with Daredevil is that Fox, like with X-Men, fudged the film by cutting out a lot of footage. There's a whole subplot that's missing here, as well as small character moments that give the movie a stronger edge. They don't bring the film to X-Men or Spider-Man levels, but they do raise it significantly. And if you haven't tracked down the director's cut dvd, it's worth a look as well.

Otherwise, this 2-disc theatrical edition comes loaded with extras. As appropriate for a movie about the visually impaired, there is a descriptive audio track included among the commentary and enhanced viewing mode options. Lots of documentaries and featurettes on disc 2. The best cut of the film isn't here, but the extras are, so it might be worth your money to view both.

Daredevil really started to get hot when Frank Miller and, later, Ann Nocenti wrote for the comic in the 80s (Nocenti's run started out unimpressive but slowly became outstanding).

With this understanding I was naturally excited to see the film rendition of ""Daredevil"" that debuted in February 2003. After seeing the movie I thought it wasn't bad. They got a lot right -- like Daredevil's costume, the mood and the casting (this was my first exposure to Ben Affleck so I had no beef with him playing Matt Murdock/Daredevil). Still, there was something wrong with the picture; it was too light and brisk. Yes, it certainly had pizazz, but it was mostly superhero fluff with little depth -- a perfect example of style over substance. Plus the cutesy playground scene where Matt first meets Elektra was out of place.

The Director's Cut reveals what went wrong: Some studio dork made the idiotic decision to cut out the meat of the story, which naturally dumbed down the film. In plain language: THE FILM WAS GUTTED.

All I can say is: Thank God for director's cut DVDs! Two years after its theatrical release I picked up the Director's Cut of ""Daredevil"" and was blown away. The director, Mark Steven Johnson, took out some unnecessary fluff, like the premature Matt/Elektra sex scene, and added over 30 minutes of material that was integral to the story and SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN CUT in the first place. This new material centers around the character-defining subplot of Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson working on a case that ties into the whole Kingpin storyline. Many say the fight scenes are also superior in the Director's Cut, which is hard to tell unless you view both versions back-to-back.

WHAT WORKS: Everything about this film magically works. Colin Farrell is entertaining as the crazed Bullseye, Jon Favreau is splendid as Foggy, and Michael Clarke Duncan is outstanding as The Kingpin; yeah, I know they deviated with the skin color, but who gives a hoot anyway? The soundtrack, which includes selections from various heavy bands, is stupendous. The touching scenes are truly touching, like when Matt & Elektra share intimate moments on the roof and Elektra's solo workout, and the kick-axx parts are really kick-axx. Two great songs by Evanescence are featured: ""Bring Me To Life"" and ""My Immortal."" There are a lot of great lines in the film as well, in particular from The Kingpin and Bullseye (""Tell me, how do you kill a man without fear?"" ""By putting the fear IN him"").

Daredevil's origin story is also perfect -- emotionally charged but not over-long or needlessly complicated like ""Hulk"" (2003).

One of the greatest successes of this film is simply the mood. It's dark and reverent at the same time. Daredevil is perfectly portrayed as the tortured loner; Affleck does a fantastic job.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The aforementioned cutesy playground scene was obviously included for fun and to liven things up at that point, but it doesn't belong; it destroys the believability of the picture and characters. It should have been omitted from the Director's Cut. Still, it's not that bad. I can tolerate it, and admit that it is a fun scene, if nothing else.

Jennifer Garner is good but she doesn't really fit the character of Elektra from the comics. She has a quality to her disposition that's simply too innocent, pure and likable. Not that these are bad traits, of course; they just don't fit the character of Elektra, an assassin. Kelly Hu, who played Lady Deathstrike in X2, would've been the perfect choice. Still, I personally don't mind Ms. Garner in the role; it's an acceptable deviation (one must allow some latitude in comic-to-screen adaptations).

BOTTOM LINE: ""Daredevil: The Director's Cut"" ranks up there with the best superhero films of all-time. In fact, it's my personal favorite. If you haven't yet seen the Director's Cut get a copy and see for yourself. I encouraged a friend who's in the comics business to view the Director's Cut. His appraisal of the theatrical cut was (understandably) a mediocre 6/10 Stars, but after seeing the Director's Cut he raised his rating to 9.5/10 Stars! Like me, he was stupefied that the decision was actually made to gut-out such important story elements in the theatrical release.

Ahh, but all is well with the Director's Cut. Be sure to check it out if you haven't already.",1151798400,,4662,4.926114649681528
2276494,5,B0009B0GYA,"I first saw Daredevil in the cinema and to be fair to it, its not a bad film. But it is particularly average, nothing really special. In fact to me it was a bit of a dissapointment, I'd really wanted more from it.

Fast forward to now and anyone in the same position as me really really should watch the directors cut. Why this wasn't made the theatrical release I don't know! It improves on the original in every possible way.

The film is generally a lot darker, showing the real price Matt Murdock pays for being Daredevil. Theres an amazing scene expaned upon where he comes back from dealing with a rapist and he reveals his back to show many many scars and you get a great sense of his unhappiness. Also added is a new sub plot that deals with a man falsly accused of murder and Matt's defence of him as he follows the trail all the way back to the king pin. All of this helps build the finale up to more than just vengence for a lost girlfriend but for all of hells kitchen.

On top of that the completely redundant sex scene is removed which doesnt detract from his relationship with Electra, far from it, instead it builds it up into something purer and more special than it was before and more tragic when he loses her. The end fight with the kingpin is expanded uopn in a way that feels natural rather than forced, as if thats exactly how it should have been first time round.

On top of this there have been lots of small touches included into the new edit, the emphasis on the catholic influences upon Murdocks life as well as a reference to his mother that fans of the comic will love. The parts of Ben Urich and Matt's law partner have been new and expanded scenes that all benefit the film.

I really cant stress enough how much of an improvement this is, even if you loved the first cut you should watch this, I'm sure you'll be amazed! The darkness and humanity of the character have been brought to life superbly, and the end result is all the better for the changes.",1150934400,,1986,4.285333333333333
2276495,4,B0009B0GYA,"It's SO hard to review this disc fairly.  I mean, if there was EVER an argument over the studios wanting to maximize the profits from one movie by releasing several versions of it, ""Daredevil"" makes a compelling piece of evidence for the trend.  (George Lucas himself would be the clincher for the plaintiff, but I digress).  As the talking heads say for themselves, there will always be praise and dirision for both versions.  I actually LIKED the cinema cut, despite some rather huge plot holes, but there is a case for telling what amounts to be the real story of ""Daredevil.""  The theater release was on the receiving end of some scathing reviews, and most of them were dead-on:  too little story, too many arty jump-cuts and ""cutsy"" bits (particularly in the playground ""fight-dance""), and too much buildup for too little payoff (the ""Kingpin Showdown"").

So why was all the primo story sequences and extended fight stuff cut?  Demographics, my friend.  And I get the feeling most of the creative crew weren't involved with what went out, as the story only benfitted from them being left in.  THIS was a necessary rerelease.  Yes, the first disc is still a must have, but one must wonder as to why, if the memory was chock full with the first DVD, wasn't this movie WORTH a 3-DVD treatment the first go-round?",1150675200,,1314,4.719298245614035
2276496,4,B0009B0GYA,"Many who denounce this movie I guarantee you did so solely on the basis of Ben Affleck's casting.  I used to be one of them, until I saw it in theaters.  Aside from Changing Lanes this was his only starring role I've ever liked.  Then, of course, this version was released and I've come to like it even MORE.

Those who may have seen the theatrical cut (TC) and didn't like it may wanna check out the DC.  It's darker with longer and more brutal fights, a new subplot to show how Murdock & Nelson really works, more badassery for the Kingpin and less of the forced love story between DD and Elektra.  This is NOT the same movie, despite how familiar scenes look.

Mark Steven Johnson was pressured by the studio to deliver a PG-13 movie, meaning a lot was cut from this R-rated movie to fit that mold.  That only proves that sometimes the directors know a tiny bit more than the studios when it comes to the stories they're crafting.  About the only thing that really plagues this movie is the miscasting of Jennifer Garner as Elektra.  On a personal note, I never liked how Matt and Elektra met in the movie.  I would have preferred a reunion from their college days like in the comics, but that's just me.

The DVD IS a little light on features, but that's because it's meant to COMPLIMENT the other release.  In reality, this was supposed to be included with that release, but they decided to push it to the following year.  However, what it lacks in the features it makes up for in design.  Gone are the cheesy menus of someone walking around an alley with a camcorder poorly edited to resemble DD's shadow world.  No, this time we get an animated menu with a shifting cityscape and images of the stars from promo posters included.  That only further shows the care attributed to this version of the movie.

If you like Daredevil comics, get this version.

If you didn't like the Daredevil movie, get this version.

If you don't like Ben Affleck, get over it and get this version.",1150070400,,1984,4.443213296398892
2276507,1,B0009B0GYA,"Mark Steven Johnson's Daredevil is nothing like the great Marvel comic it claims to adapt itself from. This terrible film has characters named after Matt Murdock, Daredevil Bullseye, Elektra and Kingpin but none of the story and spirit of its source material. An incoherent collage of comic book panels come to life, this movie is just for diehard fanboys of the comic only.

The movie starts off in a church with DD falling off a rooftop onto the floor then flashes back to the past. I tell ya, when a movie starts off with a flashback that's NEVER a good sign. We see a young Matt Murdock growing up poor in Hell's kitchen. A good kid, he honors his dock worker/former boxer father by doing well in school, He's about to show him a straight A report card, he sees his father roughing up some guys for the mob. Ashamed, he runs away and the last thing he sees is a toxic chemicals spraying him in the face. It actually happened differently in the comics, but you'll just have to pick up a copy of Daredevil # vol. 1 no 1 or The Essential Daredevil for those facts.

Later on in the hospital (how'd he get there? And how'd we get there) he learns his senses are so enhanced he's about to go crazy from sensory overload. He gets control of himself and-well- this isn't explained to us. After his father is killed by the mob, The movie cuts to years later showing us him in a red suit and mask as Daredevil with no explanation to why he has decided to become a superhero or what motivated him to do so. You know, it would have been very helpful for us to SEE those HELPFUL frames of him dedicating himself to becoming a lawyer as a promise to his Dad, training with his sensei Stick, or working towards the goal in law school, or meeting up with Foggy Nelson in law school like he did in the comics and planning to work together in a law firm then hiring Karen Page. I'd also like to have seen Murdock doing some investigation into his father's murder along the way like he did in the first issue of Daredevil. This would have built up the weak story that goes nowhere.

Well, we see finally Daredevil in action. He's chasing down a criminal and fights him in a subway station. After beating him up a train passes through the station causing him sensory overload. DD soon recovers and knocks the guy on the tracks another train (I wish trains came right after each other like that here in the city. It would really be helpful during rush hour) comes by and runs the guy over. That's when I knew this wasn't a real Daredevil movie. Daredevil NEVER KILLS. NEVER.

We get some scenes introducing reporter Ben Urich and cops investigating the Daredevil sighting. Urich lights a ""DD"" left on the subway platform. Like any dark brooding hero would leave a highly combustible calling card to go along with the guy who he just murdered. We now see Murdock going to work after attending church Confession. He's at the trial of a rapist. He says something about justice being blind but can see and I start thinking about Ramy Zada and the old Dark Justice TV show. The guy gets off and DD goes after him and kills him. But he's one of kingpin's men. We learn of his murder as Natchios is trying to break away from the mob run by Kingpin. Kingpin enlists Bullseye to kill Natchios. Instead of explaining things we see his daughter Elektra (The first Red-haired pale skinned Greek woman I've ever seen) run into Matt Murdock and Foggy at a coffee shop. Playa tries to get those digits and that leads to a fight in a park. The worst scene in the movie. Just fast-forward through it. A convoluted romance leads to and an invitation to a ball. After meeting up with Elektra, he soon surmises that Natchios is in danger after she leaves abruptly. He suits up as Daredevil. Tell me, how do you get a bulky leather jacket pants, and biker boots under a tux and have it look so neat? As Natchios limo drives off, Bullseye rolls up on his motorbike and goes into action. DD tries to stop the hit, but Bullseye gets his man with DD's own weapon.

Blaming DD for her father's death Elektra decides not to go into witness protection-but to become a costumed vigilante. We get some frames of her working out then on her way to going after DD with no build-up. Bullseye just shows up and kills this highly trained fighter in less time it takes to butter some popcorn. There's some drama and DD gets his mask taken off. He puts it back on and then we have our big fight between DD and BE which takes us back to the beginning of the film. The priest takes off his mask then puts it back on and scurries out so the final battle begins. DD kills Bullseye then shows up for his final battle with Kingpin. Beating Kingpin, he decides to have a change of heart and not kill him. Instead, he leaves telling him saying the cops know who he is even though this was never shown to the audience! The movie ends with some soliloquy about being the defender of Hell's kitchen or some nonsense.

Mark Steven Johnson's Daredevil fails because of its director's inability to tell a story with pictures. Scenes don't transition into one another; stuff just happens because he wants it to with no clear explanation of why they happen. All of the frames don't come together seamlessly to tell a complete story. I really wish the director of this film had THOUGHT of the general audience of moviegoers instead of pandering to diehard comic book fans. Everyone isn't a comic book fanboy and doesn't know the origin of Daredevil by heart. If you never read the comic you'll never understand this movie. Then again, I've read the comics and I STILL don't understand what this movie was about.

Ben Affleck is a horrible Murdock/Daredevil. He only has one facial expression throughout the movie. Jennifer Garner is decent Elektra, but doesn't fit the part She would have been more believable as Natasha Romanov, The Black Widow though. Jon Faverau is a solid Foggy Nelson. Colin Farrell is a dull Bullseye. He gets the crazy part of the character down perfect, but tones things down too much. Bullseye is over the top evil like the Joker, and I didn't get that from him. Michael Clarke Duncan struggles with the Kingpin; I think he could have done more with the role, but the writing wasn't there. Joe Pantliano is a perfect as Ben Urich the reporter.

2276509,4,B0009B0GYA,"When I was a lowly college freshman, having my interest in my childhood pastime of comics reignited by a renaissance in the industry that improved the standard of art and  writing, making them more mature reading, I remember not liking Daredevil all that much. His book seemed like a long, drawn out soap opera where nothing much happened. In fact, ol' DD seemed like a bit of a wimp! One particular cover that irked me was of a blank white field, with Daredevil in the center saying ""Please...Please stop it!"" This was supposed to be a hero?? YUCK!

However, I must say that this movie handles the character nicely! I never really read ""Daredevil"" after the mid-seventies, consigning him to the ""mediocre"" file I had reserved for characters like The Hulk, The Defenders, The Warlord, etc., but this film redeems him somewhat.

The mood, editing, acting, and action all come together to produce a movie that I feel is everything that both Batman I and Spiderman I should have been. The first Batman movie always bothered me as to how empty and cobbled-together it seemed. The miscasting and all was pretty horrendous! I still think Michael Keaton was a bad choice to play both B-M AND Bruce Wayne! Kim Basinger had almost NO on-screen appeal as Vicki Vale, and Jack Nicholson's Joker was way off of the mark, as far as I was concerned. Same with Spidey I....I remember feeling for Spidey/Peter massively when the character was introduced and first delineated in the comic book....feeling empathy for this put-upon fellow, who had to live with his caring aunt and uncle, putting up with obnoxious Flash Thompson and generally being the goat of his entire high school. Not to mention putting up with Jolly Jonah!! OUCH! I didn't feel one thing for him in the movie! Not-a-thing! Aunt May isn't the sweet, bent-over old love she is in the book...Uncle Ben wasn't the smiling bundle of good-naturedness he was in the comic, and Toby McGuire's Peter didn't seem especially put-upon.

HOWEVER, you would have to be made of stone not to feel sorry for Matt Murdock: 1) He lives alone with his father, a palooka prizefighter, MIT beer-belly, who goes through all the classic ""you ain't gonna be like me, kid!"" histrionics in the beginning of the movie. 2) Loses his father to one of the villains he will have to deal with in the future and 3) gets blinded just BEFORE losing him! Zut! The poor little guy's CURSED!

Zip ahead to the ""present"", and Matt, who was about to show his father a straight ""A"" report card just before he found out how he REALLY paid the bills, is a pro-bono lawyer in New York, along with his buddy Frank ""Foggy"" Nelson. discussing the odd way their clients pay for services, when Elektra herself walks into the cafe they're eating at. They meet cute, have a little embroglio in a nearby playground, and develop a mutual admiration for each other. And so the seeds are sown for a very good action movie with top-notch performances all around from everybody concerned. Ben Affleck is actually pretty good as both Murdock and DD, Jon Favreau is EXCELLENT as Foggy, a character I always liked in the comic, if for no other reason but that he was the one what was always the best fleshed-out. Colin Farrell is a true menace as Bullseye, Michael Clarke-Duncan is appropriately massive as Kingpin, and it is believable when, as DD confronts him in his office, Kingpin throws ol' Hornhead clear across the room.

Joe Pantaliano is good as a character who, if he were where he was SUPPOSED to be, would be the sinister character ""Patch"" of the ""Spiderman"" franchise.  I like this movie! It's beautifully edited, though I don't like the bluish cast that hangs over everything, but otherwise, the darksome look works just fine. The action scenes are downright balletic, with DD moving as BATMAN should have moved in all five movies...like an adept kung fu dervish! It's actually very hard to tell where they're using CGI in the movie, as everything looks very natural! The special effects used to show the audience what Daredevil is ""seeing"" with his ""enhanced"" senses are done well, too. Things are just very efficiently done and we are left with a tidy, satisfying action flick, where the hero isn't TOTALLY unbelievable in his abilities. (Who knows, some blind people could very well SEE things like he does!)

I remember Roger Ebert saying he thought ""Spiderman 2"" was the best superhero movie he ever saw....well, with the possible exceptions of ""Batman Returns"" and ""Forever"", and even though I haven't seen ""Spiderman 2"" yet, I would definitely put ""Daredevil"" right up there with the better ""Bat"" flicks as the best superhero films.

2276510,4,B0009B0GYA,"When Daredevil originally came out in theatres in 2003, it seemed like a mere plot by Marvel to cash in on the success of Spider-Man and act as a buffer until the release of Spider-Man 2. How fitting that Daredevil be thrown onto the silver screen and receive little critical acclaim and much dislike from fans--reactions to the Daredevil comic books were very similar for the longest time, with people complaining that his character was simply a Spider-Man knock off. The 2003 theatrical release of Daredevil was a simplistic, fast-paced action flick complete with generic grunge-metal soundtrack made for the sole purpose of raking in cash from curious teenagers. The director's cut, however, is a completely different affair. A whole subplot was introduced in this version (featuring Coolio's character on trial for the murder of a prostitute) along with extended scenes and fights which greatly added to the depth of the characters, gave the film a few more laughs, and gave a look into what Daredevil was really about when Frank Miller came in and rewrote his character in the early 1980s. As a result of these edits, Bullseye and the Kingpin come off as a lot more menacing and Matt and Elektra's love affair isn't nearly as shallow as it was in the PG-13 version. The reason Daredevil failed so miserably upon its release in theatres never made sense before considering how director Mark Steven Johnson loved the source material and just what he had to do to let Avi Arad give him the job: it was the PG-13 restriction that became the undoing of Daredevil and the 30 minutes of additional footage, along with an appropriate R rating, reveal the director's cut of Daredevil to be a far more interesting and accurate take on the classic story arcs--in short, it's the way Daredevil was meant to be.",1144800000,,1803,4.8381877022653725

The director's cut is a significant improvement over the theatrical release which I found one of the worst superhero films ever made.  Ben Afleck is a disaster as an actor and the plot was not even there.  This release restores to audiences what was meant to be seen in the first place.  It's a much better representation of the darkness of Daredevil.  One of my favorite parts of DD was Matt Murdock and he becomes a real character in it.

Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner (who is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, allowing for a highly entertaining movie.  On the negative side, Colin Farrell as an Irish (???) raving lunatic of a villain was ridiculous to say the least, and takes away from the overall enjoyment of the movie!

I love Daredevil in the theaters and when I walked out I gave it a 7 out of ten - a bit above average, and wasn't Jennifer Gardner fantastic.

Then on a whim, I bought the Director's Cut and found the layers I was missing.

Marvel Comics used to be known to the turns, the layers, the inner darkness of their heroes. XMen kept that, Spiderman held on tight.  But somewhere along the way, other Marvel Heroes became anemic.

In this Daredevil, Mattie's accident is all the more tragic because we find out more about his father's work as an enforcer.

As a lawyer, his near psychic senses are outlined even more.

The great line of ""Because I'm not the bad guy."" makes ever more sense as we see how close he gets to becoming what he truly hates.

Bullseye is even more frightening.  As he passes through metal detectors in the airport, we see exactly how devious he is and how frighteningly well armed he is.

The characters are given more depth and we actually are allowed to see subplots.

In short, this version fixes some problems I had with the original, leaves some the way they were, and introduces others.

I liked the initial violence of the Kingping, which served to increase his threat level considerably. The choice of removing the love seen with Elektra seemed to turn into cliche, where the original version was a nice change from the usual all-sacrificing hero. The sub-plot of the murder, while showing more of the lawyer side of Matt Murdock, didn't seem that inspired and didn't seem to serve the core story (just complicate it).

It would have been nice to see Bullseye introduced while breaking out of prison, headaches and all, and to have saved a Kingpin showdown for a sequel, letting the Bulleye showdown really serve as an immediate climax to the events with Elektra.

The cast was excellent and I found myself enjoying Affleck as Daredevil -- definitely my favorite role of his to date. Garner, while not particularly Greek, did a good job, and Favreau was simply outstanding. Farrel was neither here nor there, over the top but not particularly dangerous.

The CGI problems with the virtual Daredevil remain from the theatrical release, but the movie looks great as a whole, and while I didn't find this version better, I found it overall to be just as good as the theatrical release and definitely something worth adding to the collection.",1136419200,,1596,4.831501831501831
2276516,3,B0009B0GYA,"I am a huge fan of Daredevil Comics and was so disappointed when I saw the theatrical release of Daredevil the movie. I understand that the producers were trying to market it for a broader audience but I disagree with their ""fast pace/all action"" product. The movie was LAME! It wasn't even entertaining for its badness, like ""Batman Forever"" or ""Batman and Robin"" were. The movie was so abysmal that I felt like stabbing myself in the eyes. The producers forgot that appealing to a broader audience should not mean loosing the story and strong character development.

However, despite this fact, when I saw that there was a re-release of the film in a director's cut I thought I would give it a try. To my great shock, the movie is 110% better! A much stronger story (if you could even say the original release had a story), and a lot more nods to the Frank Miller comics that made me a Daredevil fan in the first place. I like Daredevil the film now. I do hope that someday Chris Nolan and the folks responsible for ""Batman Begins"" will look to do a Daredevil movie the way it ought to be, until then this director's cut is pretty decent. Yes, you must still get over the bad casting (and acting might I add) of Ben Affleck, Colin Farrell, Coolio (why does Coolio need to be in this film--who the hell thought that was a good idea? Fire him immediately!) and Michael Clarke Duncan (and why was he cast as the Kingpin???

2276537,4,B0009B0GYA,"'Daredevil',`Fantastic Four', and `Spiderman' make a very interesting trio of superhero movies, especially as they are, all three of them, based on a Marvel Comics character. To my mind, they exemplify the three levels of quality of `watchable' superhero movies, as opposed to those that are derivative and lacking any spark of imagination.

Although many have rated it fairly well, I would put the newest, `Fantastic Four' at the bottom of the list, along with `Hellboy', which I happened to like, but which shares with `Fantastic Four' some serious difficulties to our suspending disbelief. These movies are simply made for fun. You can almost sense the tongue in cheek attitude of the writer and director, let alone the actors. The situation which creates the superpowers is simply too improbable to accept. How is it that a single physical phenomenon would have five totally different effects on five normal, healthy humans? I know just enough about genetics to know how this may be explained, but the film narrative touches on none of this. We are just meant to swallow this story whole. In contrast, the transformation of Matt Murdock is totally plausible. Enhanced senses following loosing one sense are very real. They just posited a bit more than normal ability in that direction. The genesis of Peter Parker's superpowers is a bit more sci fi, but totally believable, given the chance to believe a genetically enhanced spider species.

`Daredevil' is probably the least popular of these three movies, and the first time I watched it, it didn't do much for me. On second watching, especially with the extras on the DVD, I appreciated that the moviemakers really accomplished something here. The premise behind both hero and villains is totally plausible and the director, special effects crew, and actors increase this verisimilitude by using very few CGI effects and stunt doubles. Most of what you see on the screen is really Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, and Colin Farrell, enhanced with a few wires to accomplish some of the more adventuresome gymnastics. The filmmakers also enhance the picture by doing a lot of the key scenes at night. This is totally logical, as the sightless Daredevil would have the advantage when his sighted rivals would be almost as visually handicapped as he is. `Daredevil' also has the added value of at least three very human relationships. Along with some of the `Batman' and `Superman' flicks, this holds the penultimate spot in superhero quality films.

`Spiderman' is easily on the top tier of superhero movies, based not only on the believability of the premise and the humanity of the actors, but also on the relatively effortless special effects, lightly applied to great effect. I also think the actors contribute much to the quality of this film, where with Toby McGuire, there seems to have been just a bit of casting against type, the way Michael Keaton was cast as Batman in the first Tim Burton `Batman'. While I never read `DareDevil' or `Hellboy' comic books, I am familiar with the original `Fantastic Four' and `Spiderman' comics, so I think the relative merit of the films has a lot to do with the relative merit of the comics, since `Spiderman' is the traditional champion among strong comic book fans. I should add a plug for performances by Michael Chiklis in `Fantastic Four' for his comic relief and by Ben Affleck in `DareDevil' for taking the role so seriously, possibly through the influence of his good buddy, Kevin Smith, who appears in a cameo role as the medical examiner.",1135036800,,3545,4.974704890387859

The Director's cut adds the excised bits that help the movie make more sense, as the theatrical release had holes that left you wondering; and now you have that missing info. It's too bad that such a solid effort got bashed so relentlessly. The only thing you could say was ""wrong"" with this movie was that it didn't have that extra sprinkle of soul that would have pushed it to 5 stars, a la Spiderman 2. That would have come with the sequel, which we will probably never get because of all the crybabies.",1134345600,,684,4.436507936507937
2276539,2,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil is another of those supers I just never really cared much about.  But this film does him absolutely no justice.  It's a prime example of non-comic writers trying to adapt material they don't understand.

I knew I was in trouble when they showed DD getting into a sensory deprivation tank.  In the comics, DD has perfect control of his senses.  He doesn't get overwhelmed easily.  It's just logical, folks.  I mean, Superman has far better hearing than DD, but you don't see him screaming and clutching his ears when a fly buzzes his head.  BAD SIGN#1

Next, DD fights a bunch of goons in a bar full of gunfire, screaming, and music.  That's a lot of noise, and it doesn't bother him then.  But minutes later a subway train whisks by and it throws off his senses.  That's contradictory and just silly.  Superheroes who get startled by loud noises are not particularly heroic.  BAD SIGN#2

In another scene Matt Murdock fights Electra on the street.  ON THE STREET.  IN PLAIN VIEW OF EVERYONE.  He's supposed to be blind for crying out loud.  Won't that draw some unwanted attention?  Superheroes with secret identities should know better.  Bruce Wayne doesn't throw batarangs at board meetings.  Clark Kent doesn't fly to work.  BAD SIGN#3

There's more, but why bother?  There's also precious little action in this film, and most of it is rather poorly executed.  And why in every @#!$! superhero movie do heroes always take off their masks?  Superheroes NEVER take off their masks.  But then again, I guess we wouldn't get to see hunky Ben Affleck, so what are you gonna do?

The story was a bit rushed and the supporting characters were, well, you wondered why they were even in the movie at all. They didn't do anything. That being said, the Daredevil: Director's Cut remedies all these problems. The story, while still no work of art, is much deeper and interesting than the theatrical, taking the focus off superhero action and bringing it back to Matt Murdock, how he fights crime not only as Daredevil but as an attorney who stands up for the little guy. Those wasted supporting characters now contribute to the story. All those things that just happened for no reason, now we see the reason. There's a lot of things going on in this movie, which all feel a bit random at first, but they all tie together nicely in the end. As for extras, there's not much here.

*1 big-name actor (regardless of whether or not he actually fits the role)

*1 hottie for a female sidekick/femme fatale/love-interest-who-becomes-a-weakness-for-our-hero

*1-3 bad guys with over-the-top powers, at least one of which must be able to construct an evil empire without anyone in law enforcement noticing

*a mild-mannered sidekick with little actual ability, yet who manages to provide a pivotal role in saving the day

Combine all ingredients in a city with less daylight than Anchorage in January, add a few well-placed spotlights to allow our hero to scare muggers with giant threatening shadowpuppets, and toss in a pinch of dark, industrial music.  Done.  Easier than making Nachos (which go great with any film, by the way).

Understand though, the director, a practical no-name, was bullied by the studio during the entire filming.  It was HIS mistake for picking Ben Affleck, yes, but in his favor he DID try to get a more comic book accurate costume, to which the studio said, ""too much like Spider-man"".

Instead, they gave him a pleather track suit with a dog collar and said, ""now that's dynamite baby!""

Some secens were changed to make our hero more of the guy who just can't seem to get a break.

2276546,1,B0009B0GYA,"The Curmudgeon is a hard-hearted fellow at times, but even he can be crushed, his hopes and dreams scattered into tiny broken fragements on the floor. The US remake of Godzilla was one such disappointment, as was Star Wars Eps 1 and 2 and now - this.

For those that don't know - The Curmudgeon is a comic book movie collector. I get everything; movies, TV shows, 50's serials.. anything. Which means I have a fair amount of crap, and that's fine. I can usually tell if they're going to be awful, but I really didn't think Marvel's Man Without Fear would join the cream of the crap.

For the record, I really do enjoy reading Daredevil comics. Great character, some decent villains, nice ""blind man"" gimmick.. so when the news came out that there was going to be a Daredevil movie.. well, your ever-lovin' blue eyed Irresponsible Hate Monger was going to be front row centre.

And so, where to begin? OK, Daredevil certainly LOOKS the part. His costume and the effects are great, if nowhere near as jaw-dropping as (the earlier) Spider-Man. Bullseye, sans costume (a big shame) is the best thing in the movie, in that he's, what's the word? Ah yes - interesting. He's not anything like the Bullseye from the comics, but he's still the most watchable.

Elektra's in here too, and is about as interesting as watching bathwater pour down the plughole. As is Daredevil. In the comics he's brooding, but still funny. In this he's not even brooding - he's just boring. Ben Affleck really can't add ""depth"" to his actor's CV, because other than, well, doing what Ben Affleck does (do let me know what that is), he doesn't do much else.

The Kingpin is black, which is a bit of a weird turn but fair enough. And guess what he is, too? Yup - you guessed it - BORRRRRRING. He smokes a big cigar and throws a rose on his victim's chests (wrong villain, dumbasses) and that's about it. The Kingpin is a huge powerhouse of a man, very literate and, done right, could have been a brilliant villain (even the cartoon series has more depth than this version). Michael Clarke Duncan is a superb actor, but he's given nothing to work with here. It's a waste of an actor and a character.

So, we've got boring hero, boring love interest and boring villains. Uh-oh. What else?  Oh yeah - the boring story makes NO SENSE. Matt Murdoch is blind but has a secret radar-sense that gives him abilities above that of a normal man. You get that word there, Matt? SECRET? Isn't it a bit of a giveaway to your powers and stuff to be staging a mock fight in a park with Elektra (that'll be an attempt at trying to build up some chemistry and interest in their romance - that failed), with backflips and running up ramps and God knows what else - in front of about 100 people watching?  And not ONE person thinks ""that guy isn't really blind"", let alone, ""oh, well - that'll be Daredevil, then"".

Just one in a series of howlers that makes for one depressing mess of a film. I haven't seen the Directors Cut of this yet (it'll be bought one day). Unless the Director ""Cut"" the entire film I really don't know what improvements could be made. Come back Howard The Duck, all is forgiven.

2276557,4,B0009B0GYA,"First i have to say this. If you are expecting a story or hero like Spider-Man, you are in for a shock.

The directors cut of Daredevil is one of the best directors cuts i have ever seen. Not only does the plot have more substance with the addition of deleted scenes, but also ties up plot holes as well. There was also a whole subplot about blind lawyer Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) and Foggy Nelson (Jon Faverou) defending what looks like a guilty client, played by the 90s rapper Coolio.

In this cut, you see more Matt Murdock, and you can actually see why Mark Steven Johnson chose Affleck to play the blind vigilantie. When i first saw the original version, i htought that Affleck was ok. But after this, i can say that Affleck was the perfect choice for Daredevil/Matt Murdock.

But still i have to say that Collin Farrell as Bullseye steals the show. Not only did he play him to a tea, but he also made Bullseye a more interesting character than he is in the comic series.

The R rated director's cut also has a more grittier, dark edge to the film, compared to the PG 13 rating that the original version has. Expect more graphic fight scenes, and plenty more swearing by the characters.

Overall, I must say that this cut definitly does justice to fans of the comic. If you don't have this in your collection, get it.

This DVD also has a good mini documentary about how the directors cut was made.",1127347200,,1405,4.384615384615385
2276558,3,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil, the Director's Cut should satisfy every action hero buff, except for one thing:

no charisma. Smoldering away in a stew of hatred and revenge, he is not

someone you'd care to invite for dinner. Some may take a liking to his illegally punishing

hoodlums, all ethics aside. Civic minded citizens, however, will no doubt naysay his shooting the defendants

he prosecutes when losing the case. As far as brooding is concerned, the same argument might be made against

Batman--- except that Batman does not kill his enemies outright. Besides, he is much more engaging when not

wrapped up in his alter ego. Outside of the flagrant flaw described, the movie is a fast paced, visual delight, to

be taken with generous helpings of popcorn.",1126828800,,745,4.912
2276559,5,B0009B0GYA,I don't agree with the reviews that claim that the director's cut is just a longer version. It's a much better cut that makes more sense than the theatrical cut. GREAT MOVIE!,1125360000,,174,4.46875
2276560,3,B0009B0GYA,"Longer and slightly more violent cut of Mark Paul Johnson's 2003 cinematic adaption of the hit Marvel comic series adds more detail to the story and characters but is not likely to convert any of those unimpressed with the original cut. Ben Affleck is blind lawyer/superhero Matt Murdock who battles evil in the court-room by day and on the streets by night. His biggest opposition is criminial master-mind, Kingpin, and his hired assassin, Bullseye, who frame him for the murder of a business associate who happens to be the father of Murdock's love interest, Elektra (the stunning Jennifer Garner). Of course, this sends sweet Elektra over the edge and out for revenge.

The R-rated cut of the film has a few extra curse words and some more intense fight scenes but overall, the movie still plays out like a ""PG-13"". The most noticeable difference is the addition of a subplot involving a murder suspect played by Coolio who calls on Murdock's firm to represent him. A romance scene between Affleck and Garner has been removed and replaced with a more appropriate post-fight conversation. There are a number of other added scenes which fans will more than likely enjoy but as already mentioned, it really doesn't change the end product much aside from making the movie longer.

""Daredevil"" is neither the best or worst of the countless comic book adaptions. It's nowhere near as good as Tim Burton's ""Batman"" though its far better than a good deal of the films being made as of late (i.e. ""Hulk"", ""The Punisher""). It has a lot of the same over-produced CGI action sequences that are all the rage and a good portion of its all-star cast seems to be content with their phoned-in performances. It does have its share of entertaining moments but even with the extra character moments included in the ""director's cut"", the film still seems to lack depth in its storytelling. Where superhero films like ""X-Men"" possessed a dramatic undertone and commentary on society as a whole, there's not much of that to be found here. It's by no means, a mediocre film but even with the added thirty minutes, it still leaves a lot to be desired in certain areas.",1125187200,,2146,4.797297297297297

to grasp what the comics are about.

I also have seen some filmmakers tarnish what is held

dear to some people. I have to say, This is how a

comic book movie should be done. Everything is not

perfect, but it gets its point across and makes sense

and makes the film enjoyable to watch. Also, even

though there were some horrendus actors, I have to

say, that Ben Affleck pulled off the performance of

Matt Murdock decent enough. I also thought that

Jennifer Garner was just eye candy and Colin Farrell

was wasted as Bullseye.

There were humongous plot holes in this. I

was absolutely questioning how some of the things were

being done and why. Some stuff felt out of place and

and didn't really gel with what was going on in the

film. It really made the experience of watching the

film less enjoyable. I do not like point out plot

holes to myself when I am watching a movie. I want the

director to make sure the film has no plot holes. When

a film has plot holes like Daredevil had, it makes you

question the writing of the script and the screenplay

by whomever wrote it. It really ticks me off when a

writer makes such mistakes when he is writing a movie

and trying to insert plots. What the writer did here

was a failure to express what was going on. The only

thing that I liked about the writing/screenplay was

that he kept it dark and grimy and evil and good.

The acting by Ben Affleck barely impressed me because

Ben Affleck isn't that great of a actor and in his

other roles, he has failed to impress me with his

chops. The only movie that I actually liked him alot

in was Good Will Hunting and he was very impressive in

that. Mainly, I prefer his counterpart, Matt Damon,

who by far is a more accomplished actor than he is. I

hate to say it here, but Colin Farrell was wasted

here. He was basically the best performance out of the

bunch and I was satisfied with his performance as

Bullseye. Jennifer Garner is just eye candy, plain and

simple. She was there to provide the steamy part of

the movie when she has the part of Matt's crush,

Elecktra. I cannot believe they decided to make a

spin-off of a eye candy character. Micheal Clarke

Duncan is, in my opinion, a decent actor at best. I

feel that he has had one great performance in his

career and that was in The Green Mile. Again, he

failed to impress me as the Kingpin and I was left

unsatisfied after the movie ended.

The movie has its flaws, its sometimes

good performances  and sometimes not so good

performances . But it was still a entertaining movie

2276578,3,B0009B0GYA,"I, thankfully, was not one of the unfortunate many to see the Theatrical Cut of Daredevil. The numerous bad reviews, luckily, steered me away from, what I've been told my many, is quite train wreck of a film. I had absolutely no interest in it. Fortunately however, Fox Studios were smart enough to release the Director's real Daredevil vision. Originally, I had little interest in this edition as well. DC (Director's Cut) or no DC, Daredevil was just a plain bad movie, I thought. But then, as the weeks passed after its release, and I was barraged with positive remarks and outright raves for the DC, I decided to give it a go. And 2+ hours later, I was certainly glad I did.

But first, before I move onto the more positive points of the movie, let me start with the bad, which is, rather simply, any damned scene with Daredevil in it. This may seem quite odd. How can a movie be successful when it's title character is the largest detriment to the film? I'm not quite sure of it myself.

Affleck just doesn't cut it in costume and during action sequences. The wirework is also quite hokey, the fight choreography is second-rate, and even the cinematography and lighting of the scenes look cheap and B-Movie-ish (in a bad way). All in all, a quite bad addition to any film. Thankfully, Daredevil the film is hardly about Daredevil the man. Rather, it's about a guy called Matt Murdock. And, in this area, the film works splendidly.

We start with My Biggest Complaint AKA Daredevil, but we quickly flash back to Matt as a child, and the events that would lead up to him being given his power and his decision to use it. This part of the film is maybe my favorite. Scott Terra who plays Young Matt is solid in performance, as is David Keith who plays Matt's ex-boxer father Jack. This act of the film is heartfelt and enjoyable, and both Keith and Terra work well together as father and son.

After this good-sized origin, we are flashed forward to Matt Murdock and Daredevil in the present. We get glimpses of Daredevil fighting crime, and Murdock also fighting crime. Albeit as a lie-detecting lawyer instead of a leather-glad demon. While, as I said previously, Daredevil leaves much to be desired, the characterization of Murdock, simply put, it quite excellent. Shame, all of that is, basically, flushed down the train by casting Ben Affleck in the roll. To be kind, all I'll say is, I've never been a fan of Affleck's, and his performance in DD hasn't changed my opinion of him one bit. I WANT to understand Matt, I WANT to like him, and I sort of do, but with Affleck in the roll, the character is hurt greatly. In any case, during this time we're also introduced to the supporting cast. Matt's tubby partner in law Foggy (Jon Favreau), the beautiful (and dangerous) Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), as well as the slightly-pesky New York Post reporter Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano). Garner is forgettable as Elektra (how E ever got a spin-off movie, I'll never know), and her entire subplot as a burgeoning superhero is rather lame and out of place with the rest of the film. Foggy is, well, fun. But, despite having been based on a comic-born character, he just seems to harken back to the comical supporters in other superhero movies such as Knox in Batman or Otis in Superman: The Movie. Urich's roll is strong, but slight. This supporting cast is, sadly, more than a bit weak, and they do hurt the film slightly. As a supporting cast, they hold together pretty well, and, at worst, they're ""watchable."" Affleck however, is a much different story, sadly...

The villains are both introduced rather late. And, sadly, have little screen time. They are Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Bullseye (Colin Ferrell). Duncan does an extremely good job of bring the formidable comic villain of Kingpin to the screen. While the character lacks some of the sophistication of its comic book counterpart, Duncan lifts it above that bit of poor writing, and really makes Kingpin a menacing and enjoyable villain to watch. However, as I said, his screen time is slim, and that damages the development of the character to great extent sadly. Ferrell also does a strong job of bringing his character to the screen. But in a slightly different way. He hams it up. A lot. His walk and movements are greatly exaggerated movements of forced Bravado and Cool. He's trying so hard...and you can tell. But, amazingly, this bit of ridiculousness doesn't hurt the character much, but rather gives him very comic-booky feel. Something that's lacking from most adapted villains. It's not a great show, but it's fun. As with Kingpin though, Bullseye's character development is almost non-existent.

The direction overall, I found to be a bit mediocre. MSJ's vision seems lacking in both cinematographic value and storytelling expertise. Making it bluntly obvious Daredevil is not blockbuster material. But for the small-scale film it is, and as a fair adaptation of its character, Daredevil succeeds rather well.

As stated previously, the fights are all rather unimpressive, the CGI-enhanced areas of the film are all poorly done, as well, and the final ""showdowns"" with Bullseye and Kingpin are, at best, hokey. At worst, they're horrible. But, luckily, the film isn't about that. The fights, the villains, or even the supporting cast. It's about Matt Murdock, and his life, his struggle. And in this area, Daredevil shines.

However, as hard as Matt/Daredevil tries to protect his city, it seems he is fighting a never-ending battle as more and more criminals are being loosed onto the streets. The more villains' Daredevil encounters, the more he begins to come to the realization that someone else may be orchestrating his city's descent into darkness... a man known as The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan).

When ""Daredevil"" was released to theaters I was instantly excited to see it after waiting for so long for comic books to once again have their time to shine on the silver screen. With the excellence found in the ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" series of films, I had very high expectations that Marvel would not let me down with their next heroic film. In my opinion, after seeing both the theatrical release and the Director's Cut, released later on DVD and Blu-ray, I have to say that Marvel has once again successfully made another of their famous heroes come to life for comic book fans the world over to enjoy.

Writer and director Mark Steven Johnson (""Ghost Rider"") found himself in a rather unenviable position in my estimation, having to write the screenplay for Daredevil, and also helm the film as well. I'm surprised that Mark chose to tackle both jobs, after all here's a man who by all accounts was an experienced screenwriter with such hits as ""Grumpy Old Men"" and ""Grumpier Old Men"", but as a director he was mostly untested. Not to mention when it came to the realm of superheroes, the films he had previously written and/or directed don't exactly scream ""Experience!"" Even though he was lacking experience (in my opinion), I would have to say Mark Steven Johnson did a surprisingly good job of crafting a semi-realistic version of a blind superhero, not the easiest task as I said a moment ago. I enjoyed that Mark chose to make this a darker superhero film, not going for the light and family-friendly feel of ""Spider-Man"". Daredevil is a hero that is much more violent, and at times willing to come awfully close to crossing the line between hero and villain, more so than many of the other heroes in Marvel's comic books. So, I appreciated that when all was said and done, Mark chose to have ""Daredevil"" remain reasonably loyal to the source material, something that many others before him had failed to do, which is why so many other comic book movies of the eighties and nineties never worked out as well as they could have.

As much as I enjoyed ""Daredevil"", I must admit that it is far from being a perfect movie. Although the problems that I have with the movie are not the biggest, or come close to ruining the experience, I feel they do merit at least a mention. For starters in the early portion of the movie, it seems as if Mark wasn't sure exactly how he wanted to handle the movie, whether he wanted it to be a serious, dark exploration of a more tortured hero (similar to ""Batman Begins"") or if he wanted to play up the humor and more comic book-like feel of superhero movies of the early nineties (in the vein of ""Batman Forever"" or ""Batman & Robin""). Also a few times it seemed as if Mark couldn't resist the use of cheesy feeling close-ups during pivotal line readings, for instance when Matt tells Foggy that he can't go out and drink because, in his own words, ""I have work to do."" With those words you just imagine the director saying, and ""Cue close-up on Ben... perfect!"" As I said earlier, these moments are nothing but pure cheese and prove to be ultimately unnecessary to drive home the point that Matt's a hero with a mission. Thankfully, these annoying close-ups disappeared after the first thirty minutes; however, there were a few other gripes I had sprinkled throughout the movie's duration.

The other set of gripes I had with ""Daredevil"" centers around the overuse of wirework for many of the action sequences. I know that wirework is commonplace on movie sets for action set pieces; however, when the work is either too obvious or too exaggerated it tends to take away from the scenes. This occurs numerous times in the film, first when Matt and Elektra have their confrontation/conversation in the park. While the scene is a lot of fun, the wirework was obvious during several moments within the scene. Later on in the film when Daredevil confronts Bullseye in the church both men make impossibly large leaps throughout the entire fight. Now, I understand that this is a film based upon a comic book series, and yes, Daredevil does have superhuman abilities which may allow for him to be able to jump higher (which is kind of discussed early on in the film). However, Bullseye, as far as I can tell, is nothing more than an experienced marksman, and doesn't have any kind of superhuman agility or anything of that nature, so for him to make the same size of leaps as Daredevil causes a problem for me, and draws attention to the far too exaggerated wirework being employed.

With my gripes out of the way, I will now move onto the actors performances within the film. Ben Affleck has never been one to be considered one of the finer actors of his generation; however, in this film he does surprisingly well with every facet of the character. Not to mention the fact that he's playing a blind person, which cannot be easy for an actor, because no longer are they allowed to use their eyes to assist them in communicating what they may be feeling internally or just to connect with the other actor(s) within the scene. Personally, I still find it surprising that so many people chide Ben for his performance here; I think it's a good performance, and for him it's one of the better ones in his career. Alongside Ben, actress Jennifer Garner (""13 Going on 30"") was an excellent choice for Daredevil's significant other, Elektra. Elektra's arc was similar to that of her comic book counterpart's, and without going into any detail (for those that haven't seen the movie), the sort of ""transformation"", as it were, that her character goes through over the course of the film was very well done, and Jennifer handled the two different aspects of her character perfectly.

In the supporting cast we have Jon Favreau (""The Replacements"" and director of ""Iron Man"") as Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson, Matt Murdock's partner at his law firm. Jon was hilarious as Foggy (as he's commonly known in the comics), providing the lion's share of the humor within this otherwise gritty, dark superhero film. Thankfully, the Director's Cut of ""Daredevil"" featured even more of Jon as Foggy, which made him a more rounded out character, rather than someone that just pops up every once in a while to provide a little comic relief. Academy Award nominated actor Michael Clarke Duncan portrays the film's primary villain, The Kingpin. Although in the comics Kingpin is generally a Caucasian male, for the film the decision was made to go with Michael due to a couple of factors. One, the sheer size of Michael was a good match for Kingpin's, and secondly, because Michael had the acting chops to be able to convincingly make such a large, somewhat heavy set man appear even more menacing than some other actors may be capable. Kingpin's role was another one that benefited greatly from the Director's Cut, as several portions of his storyline were cut for time and rating constraints. After watching his additional scenes that were added back in, Kingpin's story works so much better in the grand scheme of the film, and doesn't feel nearly as tacked on as it once did. Lastly, Colin Farrell as Bullseye was absolutely perfect. Colin played Bullseye the only way he could be, as nothing more than a cold-blooded killer with a semi-obsessive compulsive approach to murder. You could tell when watching the movie that Colin was relishing every moment he had onscreen, and while Bullseye isn't exactly heavily featured in the film, his scenes definitely stand out as favorites for me within the movie. I would have liked for Bullseye to have been the primary villain for either this movie or a sequel, as he has carried many issues within the comic books easily as the lead villain. Basically, a little more detail on both Bullseye and Kingpin in this movie or a sequel, would have been nice.

All complaints aside, and for the record my complaints didn't really take away too much from my enjoyment of this film, ""Daredevil"" is still among my favorites for superhero movies. While it's not a perfect film, ""Daredevil"" makes a very strong effort at bringing one of the more difficult comic book characters to life on the big screen.

""Daredevil"" is rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, and sensuality.
""Daredevil: The Director's Cut"" is rated R for violence and language.",1120694400,,9715,4.774538964901844
2276580,1,B0009B0GYA,"...this is the worst comic book movie I've ever seen. I don't know much about the comic book itself, but the movie was quite boring and lame actually. Batman, Spider Man, X-Men and Superman movies are far better. Well except for the exception of Batman and Robin which was terrible. Arnold SCHWARZENEGGER as Mr. Freeze?! WTF? Kind of like Ben Affleck as any comic book character. I enjoy him in Kevin Smith films and that's about it. Especially Chasing Amy (His best performance). His acting in Dare Devil was just kind of dull.

The action is not very exciting. The scene where he flips around slowly was copied off of Spider Man. This movie just didn't excite me very much. I couldn't get into it at all. For a comic book movie it didn't really have that great of special effects. The main villian (Played by Michael Clark Duncan, who is a pretty cool actor) wasn't evolved very well.

As a film it wasn't enjoyable at all. Maybe if I was a fan of the comics...",1120521600,,963,4.465909090909091
2276581,5,B0009B0GYA,"I loved this movie! I want to get that very clear, and jump-start the review with high praise.

I didn't really know what to expect at first with Daredevil. I've watched the trailer and read some reviews about it, but because it was another comic book story turned into a movie, I didn't have much anticipation of seeing it. Also, I really liked Spiderman, and in my mind, I figured Daredevil would just be another copy cat image of that success, and not do it very well either. I was so wrong; Daredevil is pretty close to being just as good as Spiderman.

I appreciated the look of the movie, how we saw what Daredevil was seeing. It was a very imaginative and interesting concept, especially during the rain sequences. Daredevil is also much darker and more intense with violence and death.

So, on a final note, I will not have to be dared to go and see the sequel. In fact, I can't wait!",1120262400,,892,4.393939393939394
2276582,4,B0009B0GYA,"Well let me start off by saying that I haven't seen the most recent DVD release of the Director's cut so I can't give you any information on that.

I do want to talk about the film's moral content but that will probably be last.

So let's start out with the story.

Matt Murdock (played masterfully by Ben Affleck), the man without fear, begins the story with his father being a out of luck boxer.

Matt grows up in a rough neighborhood called Hell's kitchen, after an accident he finds that he has special abilities.

He has a hightened sense of smell, touch, taste, and feel.

After several tragidies accur to him, he grows up, becoming a lawyer, and also (in the darkness of the city) becomes Daredevil.

Matt fights for justice, but if he loses a case (and justice, in his own version, is not fulfilled) he serves it with ultra-violent style.

Matt's love interest Elektra (played by Jennifer Garner) comes into the picture eventually, but their relationship, though trying to be emotional, feels forced.

There is a lot more to the plot (and I've really hastily scanned over most of it) but I think that I will focus more on the moral content in my review.

Matt Murdock is a complex character.

He is a man who is trying to do what he feels is morally right, but he often allows his own emotions to drive him.

His only confidant, a catholic priest, guides him and directs him in the proper way of justice.

Matt tries to listen but again, he is driven by emotions.

His relationship with Elektra is immorall, they sleep togeather premaritally (and a side note, the sex scene is not immensely bad but get's the point across).

The priest, while providing the moral basis for the film also has some quotes that don't ring true.

For instance, ""A man without fear is a man without hope."" That may be true in a wordly sense but not a spiritual sense.

God has not given a spirit of fear, outside of the respect of him.

The violence: Considerable, prolonged and at times bloody.

The mood of the movie is overall very dark so I wouldn't recommend it for people who are sensitive.

The foul language: Present throughout, for most Christians it will probably be enough to drive them away.

This is definately not a movie for children and sensitive teens.

I know I keep giving warnings but whoever is to watch this should be able to emotionally handle it.

Overall: Daredevil is a great movie, it does have many positive messages, but parents should be warned that there is plenty of content to keep the youngsters away.",1119916800,,2521,4.541019955654102

OBSESSING over it. It is my ultimate fav movie ever. ANYONE who can sit back and enjoy a movie, without picking it apart, will enjoy this. Sure it doesn't have the best effects, so what? It's not suppose to be Spider-man, it's just the story of how a man set out to save a city. It's got some memorable characters, like Bullseye, and Foggy. (Franklin Nelson) Bullseye is deliciously evil and twisted, and Foggy a wonderful comical character. And of cource the talented and beautiful Jennifer Garner playing Elektra is an intriguing character, enough to get her own Moive. (Which might I add is also amazing)It's got it's good action sequences, and tough fights. The story is stunningly true to the comic books. Alot of little details, like the way Bullseye kills, things they say are straight from the comics...pretty amazing. If your a comic book nerd, like me, you'll enjoy these aspects.

2276586,4,B0009B0GYA,"Americans these days talk of something they call `a guilty pleasure'. Something they shouldn't enjoy - often due to so-called political correctness - but nonetheless do. When I see Daredevil, I understand the feeling. This film contradicts many values I try to stand for. There is brutal, gratuitous violence - including a murder played for laughs in one scene - a brash, flash superficiality and much else besides, which smacks of what John Paul II called `the culture of death'.

Yet I've found the film strangely compelling. At one level, I grew up with American superheroes - and my inner teenager finds something `cool' about a Catholic superhero. Yes, here we have a superhero whose origins are not only explicitly Catholic - but who continues to practice as an adult.  (He goes to confession twice in the film).

Moreover, the film is filled with Catholic imagery. The iconography of a neo-Gothic church dominates the movie. A church bell restores the tormented young Daredevil to a sense of peace - and so forth. All of this is perhaps more important than it first appears. As I wander through modern culture, I increasingly feel the poverty of the sacred. There are so few visible reminders of life's mystery and depth. So much of what we see only proclaims a utilitarian efficiency and functionalism. Not to mention, countless exhortations to consume, consume, consume. Here in Daredevil we find a world significantly more replete with the kind of visual and aural reminders of the sacred that has always been distinctive to the Catholic vision.

Alone, none of this would suffice to redeem this dark comic-book film, did it not offer something else. That something else - in spite of everything - is heart. On a second viewing, I was surprised by how much human-ness breaks through the admittedly crass modernism and violence. Arguably, the central message of the film turns out to be: mercy. There is also something very touching about Daredevil's commitment to the innocent. And, as opposed to other superhero films, which promote infantile ideas of grandiose power, we have here a human being who visibly suffers. In conscience, psyche and a pain-wracked body. Here, Ben Affleck as Daredevil gives a moving performance.

Despite everything, the film has feeling. The film also appears to be less the product of a Hollywood assembly line and more the personal vision of one man: writer-director Mark Steven Johnson. On a second viewing, I couldn't help but think: in many ways, Mark Steven Johnson may have succumbed to the harsh commercial culture of modern Hollywood - yet underneath it all, something breaks forth in his film that is tender, very human and points in surprising ways to the power of the Catholic Mystery.

Postscript: I'm going to sit on the fence here. Elsewhere on Amazon, I've provided reviews, which speak to the possibility of a Catholic renaissance addressing the increasingly soulless robot-icisation of our culture. To recommend a brutal and in some ways, vacuous mainstream Hollywood movie in the midst of this, doesn't sit entirely comfortably with me.  I wrote the above review some time ago in another context - never used - a time when I was younger and less serious than I feel today. Looking at it now,  I'm not entirely sure how I'd feel about this film. But I do believe, as Benedict XVI has emphasised, that `the action of Christ and the Spirit outside the Church's visible boundaries must not be excluded' and that testimony to the redemptive power of mercy, humanness and Christ must not be overlooked - even in the most unlikely of places.

Also - this review refers to the theatrical version, not the director's cut, which I believe is more brutal and may cut some of the Catholic aspects (at least one of the confession scenes for example).",1117929600,,3795,4.9171875

2276598,5,B0009B0GYA,Take a look at the DIRECTOR'S CUT! It's a much better film than the edited theatrical cut. Too bad they didn't release this version on the big screen. It seems they've pulled the same trick on Elektra and put out a mangled version instead of the R rated Director's Cut. It's no wonder these films get such mixed reviews. I'd like to see the R rated version of Elektra one of these days. The Director's Cut of Daredevil is the way to go. It's an excellent film.,1115856000,,460,4.2988505747126435
2276599,5,B0009B0GYA,"Okay, I'll admit that the only reason I went to see this was Jennifer Garner. Isn't she great? Anyway, I'm glad to report that, unlike what most critics say, it's not a cartoony version but a dark story driven movie ala the Crow. The way Daredevil's radar sense is protrayed is quite genius and Colin Farrell is superb as Bullseye (Even though, I don't care much for Colin.). He uses a mixture of insanity and pride to bring him to life. And the use of John Favrou and Foggy Nelson brings just the right amount of humor to it. The Director's Cut improves over the theatrical version in so many ways that I recommend it to those who have never seen this movie. Now, I'm sure someone will ask ""Is the Director's Cut that good?"", and the answer is that it's like a completely different movie. The theatrical cut is 103 minutes. The director's cut is 133 minutes. That half hour of extra footage makes a huge difference. Just rent it -- trust me, it's good. The relationship with Elektra isn't as big and there's much more focus on Daredevil, the Kingpin, and the world they exist in. The Director's Cut was 20 times better than the theatrical version. It added a whole subplot that really wove together the entire story. Plus, there is a cool scene in the first of the movie with the bar fight scene where Daredevil walks across these burning pool tables and crouches down to look at the bad guy. ""It's time to give the devil his due."" Awesome!! Had this been released in the theatres, it would have blown everything away. Too bad the producers punked out.",1114905600,,1553,4.491166077738516

The new scenes are interesting and fun, but certainly aren't integral to the story in the way that, say, finally getting to see Saruman's final fate in the extended cut of ""Return of the King"" was integral to that film.  However, if you haven't seen the film before, this is probably the version to check out.  It sacrifices some of the fast pacing, but in return delivers a more novelistic, introspective, and thoughtful story, nicely appropriate for one of Marvel's more introspective, thoughtful heroes.",1113350400,,740,4.943548387096774

It was funny to hear the director's commentary talking about how the movie executives wanted to shorten the fighting scenes - in an action movie?  How ridiculous.

There are so many great stories that could have been told about Daredevil, but instead, the movie made an unorginized (and unsuccessful) mish-mash of all the favorite Daredevil plots.  But, after seeing the director's cut, all I have to say is that it's a shame this version didn't make it to the theaters.  This is more along the lines of how Daredevil should be.

As you probably already know, the movie is 30 minutes longer, scenes are rearranged, expanded and even cut from the film entirely.  So I won't go over what other reviewers have already done, with explaining what's new and what's not in anymore.  Instead, I'll go over what I liked and didn't like about the new material.

The new subplot with Coolio was what I probably like most about the entire movie.  It did a wonderful job showing Matt's life in the courtroom, and how Foggy handles himself when Matt doesn't show up.  Like any scene with Foggy, it's all very funny.  The director's cut also spends more time exploring Matt's faith (and often times, lack of).  It's an echo of the story that Kevin Smith wrote (and actually finished!) called ""Guardian Devil.""  It doesn't add up to much, and the scenes involving a mysterious nun watching over him will leave those not familiar with the comics confused.  Perhaps the true nature of who she is was meant to come through in a suquel.

To put it simply, the director's cut is the version of the film worth watching.  It's a shame that most won't watch it because they were so unimpressed by the original.  The movie still isn't great, and feels uneven (going from dark to light so frequently).  But whether or not you've seen the original, watch this.  I wasn't sorry.",1109894400,,1848,4.5963302752293576
2276616,4,B0009B0GYA,"I didn't care too much for Colin Farrell's obnoxious one-dimensional character, Bullseye, nor Michael Duncan Clark's unconvincingly cruel Kingpin.  The script short changes the dialogue for the villians but more than makes up for the intimate interactions between Ben Affleck's and Jennifer Garner's characters.  This is the movie's saving grace.  Affleck plays a convincingly somber Daredevil who serves justice to the common man by taking the lives of the guilty.  Despite his physical blindness, his other senses have become extremely amplified and gives him the perceptive powers to fight crime.  He lives his life through revenge and violence.  His alter ego is a lawyer who defends only innocent people or people he knows to be innocent.  This biased character flaw is was makes his dark nature so convincing and deeply touching.  What he cannot see, he feels very strongly.

Besides his late father, there is a strong love for Elektra, the lovely socialite aptly played by Jennifer Garner.  And definitely not to be outdone by her secret superhero lover, Elektra seems to hold her own as a martial arts expert (gotta give tribute to the Alias complex).

So what is it about Affleck's somber nature and Elektra's survivalist instincts that brings this pair together and make them feel strongly for one another?  A chance for hope, maybe? Whatever it is, the chemistry works well between them and very convincingly, with or without the superpowers.

Don't be fooled by the trailers.  There is less action going on in the story than appears, but this is still worth a watch. I give a C for the action, but A for the romantic intimacy.",1108944000,,1638,4.996309963099631

Here is a  superhero I can truly identify with.  I like Matt Murdock because he's a working class boy who made good. But whom at the same time has not abandoned his roots and defends the under dog whether as Daredevil or as a lawyer.

It was my love and admiration of the comic book character which led me to rent and Daredevil the Directors cut. I have to say that this is a MUCH better version from the first. Where I found the first one annoying and un-watch able. I find the DC much more engaging and true to the character.  This film is not merely the original movie with added scenes. Scenes have actually been taken out from first movie (ie. the bedroom scene with Elektra) new scenes inserted and scenes shifted around to make more sense.  I find that the directors cut enhances who DD is, a hero who looks after the little guy. As opposed to the first film which sort of was nothing but a grown man playing masked hero.

I really think that the creators short changed the movie going audience with the extremely poor film version. Because I think that if they had released this one it would have pulled in a greater crowd and done much better.",1107993600,,1603,4.305647840531561
2276620,5,B0009B0GYA,"I saw the Theatrical version and I thought it was good. I couldn't understand why so many hated it. But after watching the Director's Cut, I understood. A lot of things were unexplained and it did lack story. It was more about everyone wanting to kill DD. The Director's Cut is almost like a different movie altogether. It was more about DD defending the innocent and protecting his territory like it was supposed to. Another reason I think people would hate it is Ben Affleck who I don't have any problems with. You might have seen Gilgi or Raindeer Games and desided that he sucks. Well, he was great in Daredevil, and I hope if a sequel is made he reprises his role. The bar fight scene is awesome and he did his own fight scenes. Micheal Clarke Duncan to me is the only guy who could play Wilson Fisk, who is white in the comics. But that's really the only thing he lacked to play the character and I feel it doesn't matter. He's got the size, the deep voice, and the charisma of the Kingpin. Colin Ferrell was perfect as Bullseye. He was as sadistic and egotistical as the comic book Bullseye. He didn't wear the costume from the comics but it would have looked goofy. Jennifer Garner was great as Elektra and her fight scenes were beautifully done. I feel that Ben and Jen also had on-screen chemistry and you want them to be together, at least I did. Also I feel that people overlook the performance of Jon Faverau as Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson who gets more screen time in this version. He's a welcome source of comic relief from all the gloom and doom in the movie.

It depends on what you want from a comic book movie. If you want an ""in-and-out-in-80-minutes"" movie that's all about quick action, get the theatrical cut. But if you want to see story with developing characters and take a journey with a hero and see what his dark world is like get the Director's Cut. Or get both. I have both versions, and I placed the Director's Cut disc with Disc 2 of the Theatrical Cut and created a sort of an ""ultimate edition.""",1107734400,,2026,4.402666666666667
2276621,5,B0009B0GYA,Daredevil struck me as an ejoyable movie that got chopped down so they could get in more showings over it's opening weekend and make it a PG-13. I didn't mind and found it to still be entertaining if not completely what I wanted. The Kingpin seemed far less impressive than I had hoped for and that was that...or so it seemed. While watching the theatrical cut on DVD I was struck by the director's comments which made it sound as if the director's cut would be more to my liking. I wished it was available and you have no idea how excited I was to see the director's cut released! The Kingpin is far better now and really rocks! Other reviews have covered the benefits of the director's cut. I'll just say I'm glad I have both cuts on DVD and that the director's cut is sweet!,1107216000,,777,4.292517006802721
2276622,2,B0009B0GYA,"I'm not a big fan of comic books to begin with, though I can appreciate the artform, and I find this recent trend of taking old Marvel serials and transposing them onto the big screen to be uninspired and annoyingly unoriginal. In this pic, the Daredevil is a mild-mannered attorney by day, crimefighter by night, who leaps and soars and pirouettes with the greatest of ease despite the fact that he's blind. In this film, our hero decides to pick a fight with the local crime syndicate's kingpin, and the ensuing battle of good v. evil plays out to it's predictable conclusion, with lots of leaping about rooftops and breaking of glass [and you have to have the obligatory sharp cocktail party along the way, where all the characters, good and evil, dress up and insult each other while maintaining good manners]. The visuals relating to the way in which the Daredevil ""sees"" the world around him [using his acute, overly attuned other senses to create images in his mind] are really fabulously done. That's the high point of the film. The low point is Affleck, who is stiff as a board and inexcusably hollow. His co-stars are a little more useful - Jennifer Garner certainly is nice to look at, and Colin Farrell seems to be having more fun than anyone as the weasly assassin Bullseye - but they can't make up for Affleck's non-compelling lead. Whereas the original comic books deal with complex, paradoxical characters - superhuman on the outside, fragile on the inside - directors of these big-budget flics seem to be way, way, WAY too interested in special effects and style, and almost any film where style trumps substance is bound to be mediocre, at best. The Daredevil keeps insisting ""I'm not the bad guy,"" and Daredevil is not a bad movie. But it's close.",1107129600,,1766,4.718446601941747

2276624,3,B0009B0GYA,"I like Daredevil comics and the original movie, and I felt Ben Affleck was fine in the role. I wanted to register though that I preferred the first version of DD over this director's cut. I really appreciate M.S. Johnson's dedication to this character and working so hard to make this movie true to my favorite comics hero, and after watching the interview on this version, I can see and appreciate what he wants to do. After watching it though, I believe the original cuts amounted to a better movie. For example, MSJ mentions wanting the violent extra scene of the Kingpin killing his own bodyguards to really illustrate how bad he is, but you already know and subtlety is relative, especially in comic book movies, but for me that scene was gratuitous, or at least unnecessary. And the courtroom storyline was okay, but again, to me it didn't improve the movie and I found Coolio's acting, well, not good. To me the first version is tighter storytelling and it's the one that I prefer.

If you already have and enjoy the original, I recommend renting this one first to make sure that you prefer it. I assumed that I'd like the director's cut better and was going to sell my other second-hand, but I ended up selling this one instead.

Also, the first DVD version comes with a great second disc of extras that will be interesting to anyone who enjoys the movie or comics and great fun for DD comics fans--great interviews with Frank Miller, John Romita Jr., etc. So to me the first version is the better movie and the better deal.",1106870400,,1532,4.567272727272727
2276635,4,B0009B0GYA,"This is the true Daredevil movie.  It is grittier, more intense than its PG-13 version (added scenes of violence, nudity, and profanity earn it an ""R"" rating!).  Scenes are added, rearranged, or discarded all together, the end result being a better film (the best example is Matt's relationship with the priest).

I can understand why the producers would have been hesitant in releasing an ""R"" rated Daredevil.  After all, the Daredevil comics are aimed at a juvenile audience and such a rating would keep them from the movie leading to a loss in revenue.

Fortunately, the director's cut gives adults a Daredevil they can truly enjoy.

Then I started reading the reviews of the Director's Cut so I took a chance and bought a copy. Now here is something juicy and memorable. I think the DC version really does justice to the Daredevil stories of Frank Miller from the early 80s - the whole Electra-Bullseye-Kingpin arc, as well as some of the elements added much later such as Matt's mother being a nun. It was really a joy to see those stories brought to life and done right. Also, while this version is darker it was also funnier as well due to the added scened with Foggy Nelson. This version really allowed you to see more of and therefore care more about the different characters.",1106524800,,783,4.444444444444445

2276638,3,B0009B0GYA,"I would like to start this review off by asking, perhaps the question of the century, why the heck did they cast Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock? He doesn't look like Matt did in the comics, he doesn't act like Matt did in the comics, and he acts the same in this movie as he has in his last five billion movies. I would have to say the only good performance in this movie was the guy that play the Kingpin (his name isn't coming to mind right now). As for the screenplay I loved it. The way it is filmed is beautiful, probably most beautifully filmed superhero movie. But those things don't make a good movie. Besides those things there wasn't much to this movie. The only people Ive talked to who like this are immature preteens who love to see Jennifer Garner in skin tight clothes and love accessive violence. There is a lot of talent in this film but it is wasted with poor acting and action getting in the way of plot. If you want to watch a movie that is candy for the eyes you can get it with the beautiful camera work.

And Ben Affleck shows again he's not an actor. Why everybody seems they can fly when they jump? Jennifer Garner is not great either, that's a sin.",1106352000,,358,4.523076923076923
2276640,5,B0009B0GYA,"I know the common belief in Hollywood is that all action movies should be an hour and a half because Americans have really small attention spans. Well, I thank God for director's cuts. Especially for this film because when I saw the original version it honestly seemed rushed and I left feeling like I saw something that looked cool but who the heck was that guy in the red suit?

I was so glad to see more emphasis put on Matt Murdock. Because of the extended and new scenes I got a clearer picture of why he became a lawyer and Daredevil in the first place. The supporting characters also get more filled out in this version. I adored the scene with Bullseye going through airport security. Now that should have been in the original version but I'm glad it's here and that I got to see it.

This Daredevil Cut is longer but the extra time allows for not only more plot and character development but, surprisingly, more action. Yep, even the action movie's fight scenes were cut down in the original version. I was especially impressed by the extended Elektra/Daredevil/Bullseye rooftop fights and Daredevil's bar room brawl.

2276642,5,B0009B0GYA,"Here it is! The Darker, grittier, edgirer, but better version of Mark Steven Johnson's adaption of Stan Lee's comic book character Daredevil. Having being  30 minutes longer than its crappier theatrical release, This 133-minute Director's Cut of Daredevil offers more story, better preformances by actors and actresses (especially by Joe Pantoliano [Ben Urich], and Jon Favreau [Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson]), and a whole subplot that was cut out by the executives at 20th Century Fox (wanted to keep a PG-13 rating and wanted it under 100 minutes).

Personally, I thought Fox was being stupid by cutting out the subplot in which Matt Murdock (Daredevil) agrees to defend a man (Coolio) framed for murder. Here in this cut of the film, it shows you how Mr. Murdock deals in the court of law more efficently.

I can see how parts like the confessionals and the love scene were not included in the Director's Cut. They were needed to make a crappier theatrical release of this movie, which could have been bigger and better. Althought it's rated 14A in Canada, an MPAA rating of ""R"" dosen't really go with me. I mean it's not a graphic cut, but it is a darker cut. And there is really only two or three parts of language (especially the part of Bullseye saying ""I want a f***ing costume"" rather than ""I want a bloody costume"").

Despite the negative remarks about the rating, and the lack of special features (which only has a commentary and a 15-minute featurette), I still give it a 5-star rating. It's a much better film adaption of the comic book. At least Fox was smart by releasing this Director's Cut (or better version of this film) of Daredevil.",1105747200,,1648,4.751748251748252
2276643,5,B0009B0GYA,"This director's cut, which was the original version the director Mark Steve Johnson wanted, is amazing!  This version elevates the Daredevil movie to Spider-man 2 levels!  While I'd give the theatrical version about three stars, the director's cut is easily 4 1/2 to 5 stars.

  The character of DD was almost completely neglected in the theatrical cut.  Not to spoil much but this director's cut reveals DD's keen detective skills, superhero ethic and sense of humor that were ignored in the theatrical.  (i.e. in one part when Foggy questions Matt about scars he sometimes gets, Matt replies ""I'm in Fight Club.  The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club.  So, I can't talk to you about it.""  It's funny!)

  Futhermore, the director's cut story actually makes sense!  You'll see how the police actually caught onto Kingpin, why Ben Urich gives Matt his number at the party, etc.

  The bottomline is that the studio were idiots for messing with the original cut of DD and coming up with the relatively pathetic theatrical cut.  If this were the version released in theaters, in 2003, DD would be infinitely more popular and I have no doubt the movie would have made much more money.  The difference in the two DD cuts goes to show that business people have no clue about how to make a good movie.",1105574400,,1317,4.697368421052632
2276644,5,B0009B0GYA,"The original theatrical cut of Daredevil comes across as exactly what people have come to dislike about comic book movies. Much of the plot and character development is sacrificed to further box office revenues, leaving much of the intrigue that drew comic fans to the characters to begin with as nothing more than subtle inference. Thankfully, the DVD format has the cure for this illness.

In the Director's Cut of Daredevil, we not only get the action and special effects work that everyone's come to expect from movies based on comic book properties, we also get genuine characters and a more engaging storyline. The new subplot not only explains more about the final downfall of the Kingpin, it also gives greater focus on the characters that were pushed to the background in the theatrical cut of the film. The new storyline gives viewers a better view of the characters of Ben Urich and Foggy Nelson as a questionable murder trial points them to the true Kingpin of crime.

If you're only interested in the action sequences and a nearly naked Jennifer Garner love scene, this might not be for you. However, if you are a fan of the comics (or just a fan of good storytelling) and felt a bit cheated by the theatrical cut, you should check this version out. If this cut of the film had been the original release, I firmly believe that it would have received as much praise as the original X-Men movie.",1105401600,,1406,4.665322580645161

2276656,5,B0009B0GYA,"Don't get me wrong, I like the theatrical version of this movie.  But, as a lifelong fan of Daredevil in the comic books, the Director's cut is not just more faithful to the source material, it's also a more cohesive film.

The added storyline with Coolio puts more focus on Matt (Ben Affleck) as a man, and how precariously he balances his life as a lawyer and as a vigilante.  The toning down of the Matt/Elektra romance makes the the love affair all the more tragic.  Jennifer Garner comes off much more believable as Elektra this time around because the love is unfulfilled.  The subplot with Fisk's lawyer lends more depth to how insulated Wilson Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan) really is, and some added footage, really lends to the Kingpin's cruel and violent nature.  The fight sequences have a much better flow now, Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano) is more fleshed out as a character, and Foggy (Jon Favreau) Nelson's sense of humour is given more room.

All in all, this is a more satisfying version of the movie.  If you felt let down by Daredevil with the old version, give the Director's Cut a try.  As both a movie fan and a Daredevil fanatic, I am more than pleased by this release.",1105056000,,1188,4.566037735849057

Anyways, they were right.  It's much better than the original.  While I felt the theatrical cut was so-so, this one has some edge and bite to it.  The characters are fleshed out a bit more, and more screen time is given to the stronger actors in the cast such as Colin Farrell and Jon Favreu.  While, some of the weaker actors such as Jennifer Garner have their scenes trimmed a bit (the love scene for one).  The subplot involving Coolio is good, and adds a bit of mystery to the whole Kingpin connection.  Plus Joe Pantaliano is giving some screen time and has more of a relationship with Matt Murdock, and you can begin to see some mutual respect emerge between the two characters.  This cut turns an average film into a good solid film, that I would still rank quite a bit behind films like Spider-Man 1 & 2, Superman, Blade 2 and Batman, but a bit ahead of films like Hulk and the original Blade.",1104710400,,1068,4.305

2276663,4,B0009B0GYA,"You know, Superman ain't that brave - short of kryptonite knuckledusters, the average criminal can't hurt him at all. And Batman, at least on the big screen, is wearing bullet-proof armour - that shows a certain level of ""caution"". What does it take to be ""The man who knows no fear""? I'll take complete invulnerability, thanks. Some super-strength would be nice, too. No? I don't get any of that?

Daredevil, the man who knows no fear, isn't invulnerable, isn't bullet-proof, and isn't super-strong. He's blind. I'm not kidding - he lost his sight as a child in an accident. Admittedly, his other senses were heightened to a remarkable level - his hearing, in particular, is extremely acute. So acute, that a resonant sound will bounce off things and give him a radar-like image of his surroundings (I gotta say, even though the movie and the comics talk about radar sense, it is actually SONAR, as used by submarines - would it have been so hard for them to get that right?). The catch is that he has to sleep in an isolation tank, because all the sound in New York keeps him awake.

Daredevil, like every good superhero, has a secret identity - his is Matt Murdock. Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) is a lawyer who will never make the big time because he insists on working for the innocent, and prosecuting the guilty, much to the despair of his long-time partner, Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson (Jon Favreau). Matt is a man for the ladies, and he's not above using his blindness as a ploy to pick them up. It doesn't work with the latest gorgeous, but mysterious, woman (Jennifer Garner, who looks really good with green eyes) - she brushes him off. When he follows her, she gets physical, and is astonished that he can fend off her attack. Their sparring gets more serious and becomes a form of foreplay - this is one of the sexiest fight scenes you'll see, as well as being an impressive use of playground equipment. (The extras show how it was Affleck and Garner doing all the wire work for this sequence - quite impressive).

For an action movie like this we need a villain, or two, and we have them in Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Bullseye (Colin Farrell). Both are absolutely fabulous in their roles.

This is a dark movie, much darker than Superman, and even darker than Batman. And that's right, because Daredevil isn't a light-hearted character, fighting for truth, justice, et cetera. He's a vigilante, seeking revenge more than justice, revenge on a world that killed his father. His is not the shiny world of Metropolis, or even Gotham City supported by the Wayne Foundation; he lives in Hell's Kitchen New York, the ghetto. He doesn't dress as an angel, come with heavenly justice - he dresses as a devil, come to punish the wicked.

I have never read the Daredevil comic books, so I was surprised when I saw this film. It's a very cool movie, and they've done a superb job of it (and they are proud of it - check the extras). Strongly recommended, especially if you thought Batman wasn't dark enough.",1104537600,,3013,4.634831460674158

The director's cut gives all the extra story and info, after seeing this cut i feel like i had read a really good graphic novel, except that the story had played out in full motion before my eyes. As much as i enjoyed the theatrical cut, it didn't give me that. great dvd!",1103587200,,668,4.61344537815126
2276677,5,B0009B0GYA,"Let me start by saying that I love Daredevil in all his comic book incarnations (see my other reviews) and I love both Frank Miller and Brian Michael Bendis, so I'm open to different interpretations of the character.  But I thought the movie as shown in theatres was 'da suck.'

The big problem was that it felt like the guts of the movie were missing.  It felt like it jumped jarringly from his childhood to his injury in the church and then back around again.  By contrast, this movie takes its time in his childhood, giving his experience with his father more emotional weight.  The church scene still seems out of place but at least you care more.

The best addition is that the subplot of Coolio's trial has been added back into the story.  I didn't know it when I saw this movie in the theatre, but practially every scene in the second act of the movie ended with someone moving this trial along.  You should watch this just to know how much you missed!  The trial was actually a well-done murder mystery, and it gave Jon Favreau and even Ben Affleck more of a chance to be actors.

Another plus is that the sex scene with Elektra has been axed.  Instead of going home with her, Daredevil has to leave her to help a stranger in trouble.  The scene is very well done and feels much more like Matt Murdock.

Also, the fight scene with Kingpin has been extended and feels much more significant.  The breaking of the knees makes more sense and therefore no longer feels cheesy.

This movie is still flawed.  Ben Affleck is better but still not quite right.  Jennifer Garner is a lovely actress but she still looks silly kicking sandbags with little devils painted on them.  And I still get taken out of the story every time a minor character is named John Romita or Joe Quesada (famous Daredevil artists).  Most importantly, I DO NOT BUY DAREDEVIL AS A KILLER!!!  Why would he practice law and then go out and kill people?  But there is so much that is better about this version that I have to congratulate them for releasing it.",1103500800,,2031,4.4498644986449865
2276678,4,B0009B0GYA,"My first impression of Daredevil in the theater was that of a confused, poorly edited yet energetic and moody look at the Daredevil character. I didn't like it much but I have liked the character since I was a kid and enjoyed enough of it to avoid  seeing the whole experience in a poor light.

The director's cut of the film fixed a good 50% of the problems I had with the theatrical release. There is around 30 minutes of extra footage involving a subplot that showcases the character of Matt Murdock. This cut also retells the relationship between Elektra and Daredevil and makes it a lot more involving and a lot less gratuitous. The action scenes are extended and more violent and there are even a few more snipets of things you may have missed in the theatrical cut as a fan of the character (like Matt's mom).

I still won't give it a perfect score as the scenes that didn't work for me still don't but the director's cut moves the film from an average yet faulty attempt to a legitimate vision of the character.",1103414400,,1019,4.438502673796791
2276679,5,B0009B0GYA,"The previous reviewer, who has a foggy memory and admits to not remembering various scenes of the film at all, insists that Daredevil is a bad film. It's filled with moments that could never happen in reality so it's not a good film. I don't agree. It's a superhero movie and super-hero movies are never strictly realistic. Don't watch this type of movie if you want strict realism. You'd be better off not watching movies at all. Superman has been fooling people with a pair glasses for 70 years. It's classic stuff, and entertaining, but it doesn't make any sense from a strictly realistic perspective. And what about that scene in Batman Returns when Batman punches a hole in the floor of his armored Batmobile with his fist? He's just got human strength! Spiderman has super strength and yet Doc Ock has no problem taking his punches? And there's just no way MJ's hair would blow like that when the taxi cab crashes through the window but IT'S A COMIC BOOK MOVIE not a physics class. Comic book movies are filled with this sort of stuff. Trashing Daredevil, a comic book movie, for not being realistic is just plain foolish. Daredevil if an entertaining superhero movie and the director's cut is an even better version for fans of the film. As for the claims that you can't introduce a superhero with other superheroes: The Punisher first appeared in an issue of Spiderman. Wolverine was introduced in an issue of the Hulk. His introduction to the silver screen was with the X Men. Elektra was introduced in the pages of Daredevil, appeared in the Daredevil film, and now has her own movie.

I loved daredevil. i used to have the toy long ago, used to watch his chararcter on X-men that time he starred in an episode, i even read many of his comic books.  But this man was virtually flying in the movie.  He's jumping off of tall buldings and not breaking any legs.  I understand he got ultrasonic hearing but from that accident, but the other things were just unbelievably fake.  The worst part in the movie, was when he met the female character in the movie and out of nowhere they just start arguing  and then fighting each other in business-casual clothes. they didn't even know each other. Then if I can remember, I think they kissed, or were about to kiss. U can't introduce a superhero in his first movie and have another superhero in it with him. The movie was terrible.

This is not the kind of ""director's cut"" where they just add more screen minutes.  Whole scenes that were in the theatrical release are gone, and good riddance.  I have always hated the ""must work in a love scene"" mentality, whether the story being told needs it or not.  Of course Elektra is an important part of the story, history, and legend of what makes Daredevil who he is, but good lord, do I HAVE to see 'em smooching and stuff???  I digress...this version has what anybody going to see a superhero movie wants and expects: action, a respect for the traditions of the characters involved, and action.  Did I mention action?

They made him actually scarier than Bullseye, which the theatrical cut failed to do... Bulleye's dialogue was also trimmed up, and his intro was extended as well...

I bought the theatrical cut of Daredevil on DVD a few weeks ago and I was very entertained by it. Good cast and the director knew what he was doing. There were a few minor things that I wasn't crazy about but the director's commentary made it clear that he wasn't crazy about them either. I enjoyed his comments and his passion about this project. It made me want to see the director's cut of the film.
Now I have.
I was just a little worried that maybe it might be a waste of cash but have no fear. I enjoyed it and I'm more than happy that I bought the director's cut since the additional scenes are all entertaining and it's a great alternate version. I liked many of these additions more than scenes included in the theatrical cut.

I enjoyed the dark theme of DareDevil, and the Director's Cut goes even darker by adding more violence and language. The violence tending to be new scenes and extentions to fights already in the movie. Important to note, perhaps, is that due to the addition of the new scenes, the story is done somewhat differently, though ultimatly leading up to the same conclusion. Example..(do not read next fews lines if you've yet to see DareDevil) when Matt and Elektra are talking on the rooftop, in the threatrical, Elecktra asks Matt to ""stay with me"", and so he does and it leads on into a romantic scene. However in the director's cut, Matt does indeed leave. Thusly, less romance. (end spoilers) That is perhaps not the best example of how the story changed, but how some scenes will have been changed. To conclude, I found the darker story of the Director's Cut to be better than the theatrical version and highly recommend anyone who enjoyed DareDevil to pick it up, and even people who have yet to see it.",1102377600,,1146,4.650246305418719

Yes its a super hero movie that shamelessly apes Tim Burtons Batman and Raimis Spider-Man.
Daredevil has allways been to me Marvels answer to Batman which isn't bad just obvious so it becomes a matter of preference which hero you like better and since Batman has gone through so many makeovers whilst DD has stayed allmost the same over the years im more likely to side with DareDevil.
The movie looks and feels like a comic book but is brave and flawed all the same.
I don't like Ben Afflec or Jennifer Garner or Micheal Clark Duncan or that idiot who played Bullseye so Daredevil should have been the worst movie ive ever seen but it wasnt.
The above actors chew scenery here like termites on freshly cut oak but despite the uneven pacing and unlikely choice of actors it serves as a culty bit of goodness that I enjoyed watching.
Enter the directors cut a much longer Daredevil with a tad more violence but the big difference is the subplot of a murdered prostitute and the man accused of killing her(Coolio?!?) who Matt Murdock(DD)is convinced didn't do it. Sadly this bit does make the movie drag a little more and it really doesnt work once the crime is solved towards the end of the film.
All in all Daredevil is a noble attempt to give the devil his due and Marvel has done worse lately don't even get me started on The 2nd failed Punisher adaptation so enter with an open mind and lowered expectations and you should be all right.",1102032000,,1551,4.542857142857143

2276715,4,B0009B0GYA,"Ben Affleck turns in a brooding performance as ""Daredevil,"" a blind hero that is attorney by day; judge, jury and executioner by night.  Typical of comic book yarn, father, giftedly played by David Keith, is murdered.  Young son Matt is left alone, blind, and vengeful.  He uses his other senses to ""see"" with sound vibrations.  He becomes skilled in martial arts and acrobatics.  Suprisingly believable.  I enjoyed the PG13 version, but felt this version is much tighter and darker.  There is a whole scenerio involving Coolio that got cut originally, and felt it added to the story.  I do feel that Kingpin, brilliantly done by Michael Clarke Duncon, was underused and was worthy of having the villainous role all to his own.  Bullseye, played smartassy by Colin Farrell could have been a chief villain as well instead as a supporting player.  Electra was in the film far too short, but will be spun off to her own movie.  On a side note I was a little disappointed that there was no ""Electra"" trailer considering the film comes out in January.  It would have been nice to include a free pass for it too.  After all Fox, we did buy this film a second time.  All in all though the sound is great, the new scenes are added seemlessly.  It is well worth owning both versions.",1101859200,,1274,4.6

And believe it or not, former rapper Coolio was actually quite funny, especially in the court scene when he mentions he uses only shotguns (you'll know what I mean when you see it). If this was the version released in theaters I think most people would have this one at the top of the Superhero film lists right beside Batman, X-Men 2, and Spider-Man 2.

2276717,4,B0009B0GYA,"This director's ties together loose ends and fixes some flaws that the original version had. Plus the original needed more humor and this version has a lot more due to more scenes with Jon Favreau and Coolio being added to this version. Coolio plays a man that might or might not be innocent and that is defended by Matt Murdock (Ben Afflick). This version also shows even more how this is no doubt Afflick's best work in awhile. I thought he was good in the original version but here he has stronger scenes that take the character further. It's a shame I hear he doesn't want to do a sequel because he is really good in the part. Plus doing a sequel would've been a much better choice than doing Suviving Christmas. Wasn't that in the movies for like 2 days ?

  Anyway there's a lot of strong scenes added that should've stayed in the original. Plus some things change in this version. In the original Afflick stays with Garner's character on the roof in the rain and ignores someone screaming. Then that's followed by a sex scene. Here he says sorry he has to leave and actually leaves and there is no sex scene. So their romance is trimmed down a little but this version also shows that the sex scene wasn't needed. That sex scene was a flaw in the original I realize after seeing this version too. I mean think about it, Murdock is obsessed with justice so he wouldn't just stay with her on the roof and ignore someone in trouble. So this version is much smarter and stronger. If they released this version in theaters I think it would've been compared to Spiderman 2 and X-Men 2 as one of the best super hero movies.",1101772800,,1622,4.4

Ben Affleck, an actor I normally loathe, actually delivers a multi-layered performance as the blind activist-lawyer by day, masked crusader by night.  Jennifer Garner is simply luminous as Electra.  The sky is the limit for Garner.  Colin Farrell, another actor who normally doesn't impress me, is charismatically comicly menacing as Bullseye.  Michael Clarke Duncan is fearsome as Kingpin.  This film didn't get great reviews on initial release and had kind of lukewarm box office.  ""Daredevil"" is definitely a film in serious need of re-evaluation.",1101686400,,819,5.097744360902255
2276719,4,B0009B0GYA,"A marked improvement over the previous version of the film, ""Daredevil"" (Director's Cut) allows director and co-writer Mark Steven Johnson to adjust his film to the darker aspects he originally wanted to portray on screen. I won't be reviewing the previous edition in this review at all (since amazon.com inadvertently combines all editions into one pool this may end up under the previous theatrical DVD release), but will focus on what makes the ""Director's Cut"" unique and worth picking up for fans of the movie and the comic book.

Sometimes ""Director's Cuts"" are a mere attempt by the studio to make more money or the director to create something successful out of a disaster. That isn't the case with ""Daredevil""(Director's Cut). Director Johnson originally intended to focus as much on Daredevil as he did on Matt Murdock and his career as a crusading lawyer fighting for the underdogs. The 30 minutes of additional footage adds an important subplot about the murder of a hooker which is pinned on street thug (Coolio). The fight sequence at the end between Kingpin and Daredevil is longer and more involved. Many of the fight sequences are cut with an ""R"" rating movie in mind (and that's what this DVD version received as its rating). Some of the love story between Elektra and Daredevil gets shortened here as well in favor of developing Murdock's character and for some truly interesting (and occasionally funny) courtroom scenes.

Johnson was required by his contract to provide a PG-13 movie and, as a result, he had to reshuffle the movie a bit cutting out much of the subplot as well as trimming down the more intense fight sequences of the film. There's also a number scenes related to character development that got lost along the way most notably the reporter that follows the Daredevil and Murdock himself. Restoring these sequences improve the film and add strength to a narrative that had a number of holes in it and was too simply resolved. Additionally, it gives more substance to Matt Murdock's character creating a much more complex person. We also see much more about Kingpin and scenes that demonstrate how dangerous he can be.

The transfer here actually looks a bit sharper and with slightly better clarity the the original DVD. Like the previous edition, this one has been transferred in the anamorphic widescreen format which translates to better image quality than a standard widescreen transfer. The sound is also top notch with nice use of the surround sound format.

This ""Director's Cut"" doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the previous edition (in fact it is a single disc release). The only extras are Johnson and producer Avi Arad's commentary track for this edition (which was in preparation for DVD before the movie was even released to theaters) and a 15 minute featurette on the director's intension in creating this edition. While it lacks the extras on the previous edition, it more than makes up for them with a stronger film. My only complaint is that this should have been released at the same time as the original DVD and/or in place of it with a second disc of extras. Unfortunately, Fox has participated in the old double dip.

Overall, ""Daredevil"" is much improved with this special edition. It's a pity it came out so long after the original (much like the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies). Johnson points out in the featurette that he considers ""Daredevil"" to still be flawed movie and while he may be right, restoring the first R rated version certainly makes this film stronger. The ""Director's Cut"" is far closer to Frank Miller's comic book vision of ""Daredevil"" than the previous edition. Fans of the movie will definitely want to pick this up.",1101513600,,3705,4.874603174603174

2276722,4,B0009B0GYA,"I always thought this movie was underrated and on the receiving end of too much flack. There was absolutely nothing wrong with Ben Affleck's performance and the rest of the cast did an amazing job.

Daredevil had an edge to it more so than Spiderman which was mainly focused at a child/teenage audience. This movie offers darker themes and covers greater areas. It explores the fine line between justice and vengeance, brutality, revenge, corruption, love and religion.

This movie did have a lot ground to cover in 90 mins such as Daredevil's origin and setting up the rest of the characters involved: Bullseye, Elektra and the KingPin. So you did grasp this understanding through the course of the film.

I thought the costumes were faithful to the comics although I didn't think much of Daredevil's mask which lacked a neck. It looked more like a ""cap"" and earlier on in the film (Subway Scene) more like a bandana. It does get a little anoying watching this especially since Spiderman's costume was so dead on with his comic book roots. They mentioned they didn't want Daredevil's costume to resemble Spiderman's but come on how can they possibly mistake Daredevil's image for Spidey???

The final scene with Daredevil and Kingpin was a little rushed but they were trying to set up the sequel by ending the movie in this way. I honestly hope we do manage to get a sequel as there are just too many unanswered questions left over from this film that need to be resolved.

2276724,2,B0009B0GYA,"Another flick brought out to ride the current wave of comic book hero adaptations - parallels with the Spiderman series are too obvious to point out, but Daredevil has a darker edge to it. Young Matt Murdock (Scott Terra -the best actor in the film for my money) is blinded by radioactive waste and witnesses his father being murdered for refusing to throw a fight. So he grows up (elder Matt played by Ben Affleck) to become a blind pro bono lawyer by day and violent avenger of justice by night, following up gruesome revenge killings by visits to the confessional box. He meets Electra (Jennifer Garner), a beautiful martial arts expert and they fall in love. They combine to fight the forces of evil - Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan, excellent and under used) and Bullseye (Collin Farrell - ludicrously over acted).

Potentially a good comic book adaptation, but disappointing for the following reasons. Affleck in the lead doesn't act out the role with nearly as much charisma as the comic book hero Daredevil requires. And the film treats his blindness in a slightly too surreal manner- Matt can see people by hearing raindrops fall on them- to be realistic. At other points, he seems to be able to manouever just as well as a sighted person with only the occasional concession to his blindness, as if the director is conscious of the need to highlight Daredevil's handicap but unsure exactly how to go about it.

The dialogue is often cliched 'They say when you die your whole life flashes before you' type thing and, at other times, curiously baseless. Such as the priest telling Daredevil during one of his confessions that 'Those who live without fear live without hope'. What does this mean exactly?

The fight scenes are often unispiring and at times yawn inducing and the score is too intrusive - often introducing characters to bad rock soundtracks.

Is the film enjoyable? At times, yes, there are good scenes. But these are outweighed by the weak ones. As comic book adaptations go, I prefer Spiderman.",1099612800,,2018,4.806916426512968

The funny thing is, although it only made around 130 million in US theaters, this was one of the top selling dvd's in 2003. I prefer the darker tones in this film as well as the Blade series.

But, in all seriousness, it's a decent movie for what it is attempting to accomplish: a slightly dark take on the comic-book story of Daredevil and Elektra, with Bullseye and the Kingpin as the major villains.

We have action-packed fight scenes that, while some may argue there is a bit too much wire-work in some spots, manage not to go too far beyond the bounds of super-hero physics. Anyone complaining that it goes to far? I point you to some of the jumps Daredevil makes in the comics, or his recent epic battle against 100 drugged-up yakuza in a recent Brian Michael Bendis-penned issue.

This release (referring to the Director's Cut) promises to fill in a few holes from the movie, add an extra layer of depth with the addition of a small sub-plot, and extend one or two action scenes to give them a more ""whole"" feeling. It wasn't absolutely necessary to enjoy the movie, but I feel it'll likely please a few more people.

All in all? A good effort, and a worthy addition to any action-movie or comic-book fan that can get past the Affleck-hate or detail-obsession... but not a movie classic.",1099180800,,1345,4.638655462184874

Regardless of a dislike for Affleck, he nailed the character and Michael Clark Duncan makes an awesome Kingpin. The only thing missing? No mention of Stick (Matt's boyhood mentor), but it looks like that will be (sort of) fixed in the upcoming Elektra flick.

I thought this movie was a much better introductory film than Spider-Man or X-Men, and brought a character who's not as widely known as Peter Parker or Logan onto the big screen. And now with an extra 30 minutes and an R rating? Bring it on!

Yeah, there are plot holes a mile wide. Yes, the costume could have been better. But up until now, there hasn't been a closer adaptation from comic book to movie, which puts it a cut above the first Spidey and X-films.",1099180800,,860,4.541935483870968

So I figured the Crow was done so long ago that no one would remember.""  Hack.  Affleck?  That cheesy fight scene in the playground?  Garner(who just finished filming the Elektra sequel)looks lost?

2276770,3,B0009B0GYA,"I really didn't think I was going to like DAREDEVIL all that much. I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck and when I heard he had been cast as the vengeful Matthew Murdock, I thought ""Well, the movie is doomed."" Fortunately, this is one time where Affleck rises to his potential and adds to a film's value instead of decreasing it.

Matt Murdock (Affleck) is a powerful lawyer who has given up all opportunities to make a fortune in corporate law and instead has returned to his boyhood neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen in New York City to mostly work on pro bono cases. As a child Murdock was left blind in a bizarre chemical accident. However, the accident that took his sight has heightened all his other senses to a supernatural level. At the end of his work day as a lawyer, Murdock goes home and changes into a costume and become Daredevil, the man with no fear. Daredevil is really starting to clean up the crime in Hell's Kitchen and New York's biggest crime boss, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) doesn't like it one bit. So, he sends an Irish assassin, Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to get rid of Daredevil. Along the way, a female vigilante named Elektra shows up on the scene and gets in the way of everything. She falls in love with Matt, but doesn't like Daredevil that much because she believes he's preventing her from killing the man who was responsible for her father's death, Kingpin. And so as the world turns, these are the days of comic book heroes' lives.

DAREDEVIL is a very entertaining movie. It's full of action, lots of pretty stars who do a decent job at acting, witty humor, cool special effects, awesome sets, and sweet costumes. However, there is one component that keeps the movie from rising above an average comic book movie: a plot without any holes. Overall the movie moves along alright, but every once in awhile there is a scene and the audience goes ""where did that come from."" Somebody either screwed up in editing or the writing left too much to the imagination. Either way, you can't leave too much to the imagination in a comic book movie; a little, yes, but not a lot and there's way too much missing in DAREDEVIL. Still, if you can overlook the occasional plot holes, DAREDEVIL is a thrill to watch.",1098057600,,2232,4.5497512437810945

2276772,2,B0009B0GYA,"""Daredevil"" deserves credit for effort.  The director, Mark Steven Johnson, loves the character dearly, gleefully throwing old images from the comic book onto the screen and going out of his way to create a logistically sound ""radar sense.""  But it's all so reverent to the Marvel strip that it doesn't explore any new ground; Johnson almost seems afraid to add any idea of his own.  The film is beautifully designed and photographed, incorperating elegant blues, reds, and blacks, but the surface sheen can't gloss over a movie that's starved for imagination.  It's all standard action-film fare, complete with the requisite computer-assisted fight choreography of post-""Matrix"" cimema, and a cast that knows that it's not as important as the special effects.  Indeed, the cast is a special effect, one created to sell tickets to an otherwise apathetic audience; Daredevil isn't a household name, so the movie provides us with actors who are.  They do serviceably, but more thoughtful casting would have added much-needed depth to this bland production.  This movie dares very little.  Features Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, and a tweeking Colin Farrell.",1097625600,,1155,5.3076923076923075

2276774,5,B0009B0GYA,Daredevil the theatrical film had tough obstacles to rise above: how do you combine the original Bill Everett/Stan Lee Daredevil as well as the Frank Miller Daredevil as well as the Daredevil's of Colan and Bendis etcetera? I liked that approach but it caused some criticisms and hopefully they were dealt with to some degree by the bonus disc in the DVD set which presented the history of Daredevil and the aritsts and writers who had been involved all incarnations of the character. The bonus disc did a nice job of explaining the background of the comic and made it clear that the film tried to embrace the whole history of Daredevil. Other major obstacles the film faced were cuts to make it shorter and PG-13. Relaeasing an alternate cut should help improve things. The Daredevil Director's Cut DVD will no doubt further improve an already great film.,1097107200,,856,4.79054054054054
2276805,3,B0009B0GYA,"You can tell this movie was written and directed by a fan. There is no doubt in my mind that Mark Steven Johnson is a DareDevil fan and I know he meant well. However, just because you're a fan doesn't mean the movie you make will be any good. Though he does stay very true to the dark Frank Miller version of DareDevil, which is a good thing because, in my opinion, the Stan Lee and Bill Everett version had zero appeal. Since DareDevil is a lesser-known character it would have been more appealing to do a comic book movie that wasn't your typical comic book movie. However they just chose to take bits and pieces of other comic book movies and put them together. Don't get me wrong, the stuff they took from other films is interesting but we've seen it all before in other comic book movies. For example the look of the movie looks very much like Alex Proyas's version of James O Barr's The Crow. But to me DareDevil should look and feel more like something a long the lines of Taxi Driver. A DareDevil movie shouldn't be like Batman, or Spider-man or any other comic book superhero movie. It should be like The Godfather, or Good Fellas, or Taxi Driver, with a Superhero thrown in the middle of it all. However, looking pass the facts that this is a typical comic book movie it has its good and bad points. Most of the acting in it is pretty good. I liked Ben Afflecks performance a lot, despite what others say. I also highly admire the fact that he took a pretty big pay cut to do the film because he's actually a fan. Colin Farrell plays his part well and you can tell he had fun with it but you're left wishing he had more lines and a bigger part. Michael Clark Duncan isn't my ideal Kingpin, but not because he's black but because he's not that scary. Michael Clark Duncan seems more like a big puppy dog than he does a villain. Another thing is Kingpin should never smile, Michael Clark Duncan smiles way too much in the movie but that's also partly the fault of Mark Steven Johnson. Jennifer Garner plays her part pretty well but not with much flavor. She's very sweet in the movie but Elektra should have more appeal than just sweet. What made her character in the comics so appealing to DareDevil was that she was an equal. Not just some pretty girl with a nice smile. They do play up the fact that she is DareDevil's equal but they do it in such a corny and stupid way. There's a seen in the park where Matt and Elektra start to fight but it makes pretty much no sense. Matt is trying to get her name and all of a sudden they start doing all these flips and kicks. If Matt is trying to hide the fact that he has powers, he isn't doing a very good job of it. That part aside, Ben and Jennifer actually have pretty good chemistry on screen but what's more amazing is the chemistry between Ben Affleck and Jon Favreau. Mark Steven Johnson really rights some great dialogue between the two. I would actually love to see Johnson write a buddy movie staring Ben and Jon. Another thing I liked about the movie is all the little ""inside"" stuff only comic book fans will get. Like when Jack Murdock (Matt's father) is approached by Fallon and he mentions three other fighters names ""Miller, Mack, Bendis"" are all the last names of more or less recent writers of DareDevil. And some obvious stuff like Kevin Smith's appearance because Smith wrote the comic back in 98. And I thought it was really cool that they had the fight between Elektra and Bullseye from DareDevil 181 that is legendary. Overall I wouldn't say this is a bad movie just they could have made it so much more interesting. They could have made it more like an actual movie and less like a comic book movie. Though I must say that the second disk is worth the price of the DVD alone. There is a REALLY good documentary on DareDevil with interviews with some of the greatest DareDevil creators out there.",1097020800,,3873,4.350828729281768

2276807,5,B0009B0GYA,"It's usually a shame to realize that when you watch a film, the product brought to the screens was not the originally intended version meant for audiences, but due to the pressures of the film companies, the directors are often forced to remove certain things from the film in order to speed things up or even to shorten the running time.

I guess that's the reason DVDs were invented, to allow us a chance to view what was removed from the original film or even allow the directors the chance to put back into the film what they originally wanted to be in there in the first place.

This in itself can be double-edged because it all depends on whether or not the deleted scenes add anything to the original film or not.  sometimes upon viewing the deleted scenes you can see why the scenes was shortened or deleted outright in the first place because it was not necessary and didn't add anything to the film as a whole.

I myself am looking forward to this new director's cut version of Daredevil.  I loved the way the film was initially, but upon hearing that there were things removed from the film, it got me quite curious as to what the film would be like with the deleted material reincorporated back into the film.

They also battled quite a bit with the MPAA to keep their PG-13 rating.  (It's difficult to be true to the darkness in the comic book series while marketing it for the most optimum revenue returns.)  Hopefully, they've taken the time to sensically incorporate the extra fight footage into the story and brush up on a few of the painful CG shots (amidst many good ones).  Marketing ploys aside, I think there's added pressure for directors these days to ""get the product out the door"" that they have to make various artistic compromises ( la LOTR).

Speaking of Elektra, the negative reviews that critique her name and claim the film is a bad adaptation of the comic have me perplexed. Elektra's name in the comic is the same as in the movie so they adapted that correctly. If it's good enough for Frank Miller it's okay by me. If they had changed her name for the movie picky people would have still complained.
Jen is cute when she's funny so let's back off attacking the humor in this movie too. It's a comic book movie. Cheese is part of that recipe. It always will be and if you hate cheesy comic book stuff you must be having a coronary over Sky Captain.

2276864,1,B0009B0GYA,"I loved the Daredevil movie... more than Spider-Man for that matter. However, I find it extremely insulting that there is a Special Edition for this movie. The original was released not even a year ago, and that one was supposeably loaded with ""Special Features"". My quarl is not just with Daredevil SE, but the slew of other SE DVDs (Hellboy, Jersey Girl, Matrix Reloaded) that are being released. The only purpose for SEs is when there was an older movie that wasn't properly released on DVD (released without any features, example Top Gun and Fasttimes). The distributer is just trying to sucker a few more dollars out of consumers hands. It would have been fine if they released this ""Director's Cut"" when the theatrical version was released (Like Riddick and Van Helsing will, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre did) You know give the opportunity for choice...

Anyway just as a heads up, this DVD will probably feature no more special features than the first edition. To be honest the only things different with the director's cut of the film is that there's a few words/utterences that were removed so that the film could be rated PG, and brief seconds of violence - it's more like a Producer's Cut. It is also worth noting that this DVD is going to be released the same week as Spider-Man 2 (an attempt to spounge off it) and is a marketing ploy (expect a free ticket offer or some coupon) for the Electra movie due out this Feb.",1095465600,,1430,4.6521739130434785

2276866,4,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil fans all have their favorite rendition of the Daredevil character and their favorite issues of the comic. I'm a Daredevil fan who appreciates the entire run of Daredevil comics since the early Stan Lee and Jack Kirby days. Daredevil has had his ups and downs but I've loved 95% of the issues of the comic that I've read. As a fan of various forms of fiction I always like it when newer versions of a story go back to their roots. I also like the way a story or character changes over the years and I want to be introduced to new revelations about my favorite character. Daredevil the movie does all of these things.

The movie Daredevil brings back some of the light fun of the original Daredevil comics when comics were often comic, vibrant, and far out. Director Johnson is clearly a Daredevil fan and I think he worked the names of every artist and writer who ever worked on the Daredevil comics into this movie! The film moves fairly quickly from Matt going blind and discovering his heightened senses to Matt training himself and that's a point of controversy for some. Not for me. That's just the way Stan Lee told that part of the story in the original Daredevil issue that spawned the comic series in the first place. This doesn't mean that there aren't new twists or other versions of the origin of Daredevil also used in the film. The film's origin tale derives from various issues of the comic and even parallels the origin given when Daredevil appeared on the animated Spiderman series.

I was impressed with the way the film mixes in classic Daredevil with later takes on the character. There's far more character development and angst in the movie than there ever was in the original Daredevil comics. This will be a plus or a minus depending on which Daredevil is your cup of tea. Some have complained that the character's flaws are a weakness and they like their super heroes ""super"" like in the old days. Others wanted less classic comic booky action and more character development. I thought the film did a fine job of showing all the diverse interpretations of the character which have kept me hooked over the years.

Johnson knows and loves Daredevil and it shows. His movie includes not only the original version of the character but the edgy tone of later Daredevil comics and various characters and storylines from Daredevil's 40 year run. You get the fun and funny side of the character as well as the angst and anger. The film also reveals a Daredevil so angry with criminals beyond the reach of the law who prey on the innocent that he takes matters into his own hands and punishes them himself. Daredevil then struggles to keep his rage and hunger for justice from making him the very thing he hates. These moments make him something different from the usual comic book movie super hero and I was shocked and impressed. That's a pretty ballsy move for a comic book movie.

I wasn't impressed by a lot of the CGI in the film. From his DVD commentary it seems the director didn't like a lot of the CGI scenes I didn't care for either. Many of the scenes Johnson filmed for this movie sound like winners but they ended up on the cutting room floor due to decisions made from his higher ups. I'm extremely eager for the release of the director's cut. It's also clear from the commentary that Johnson worked hard to bring Darededevil to life. I admire that. The commentary and DVD extras are very well done and I'm very happy to have this DVD in my video library but not all Daredevil fans will like this movie.

There are fans that dislike the character development of this movie because they wanted more classic comic book styled moments and ""super"" stuff. Others want more character development and dislike the ""campy"" and classic comic book elements and ""super"" action. Some will want to see their favorite issues brought to life and not other aspects of the character's 40 year run. There will also be those who like the film. I suspect that those who have enjoyed the entire run of the comic might enjoy it the most. I also think those who don't read Daredevil comics at all might enjoy it since they won't be expecting just their favorite issues of the comic.",1095292800,,4198,4.577127659574468
2276867,1,B0009B0GYA,"Please note that this review is for the original theatrical release (which is, in fact, what this (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition) DVD is. If you want the director's cut, you need to go to the entry which says, ""Director's Cut""). I have not seen the director's cut, because I'm not sure if I can stomach more of the same movie, and I doubt that the cut could possibly fix the biggest glaring flaw in the theatrical release.

What's wrong with this movie, you ask? Well, let me start with a summary of just who Matt Murdock is in the comics:

MATT AND THE LAW:

Matt Murdock is a highly intelligent defense and civil attorney, who truly believes in the law.

As Matt Murdock, he largely defends people who are down and out. And, with few exceptions, he will even defend guilty people. This is because, more than putting criminals away, he needs to believe in the system.

As Daredevil, he always operates just on the right side of the law (unless one counts assault and battery, of course). He's a highly skilled martial artist (more on this later) - which is a good thing, since this means that he doesn't need to kill his opponents in order to win. Which is good, because refuses to kill. EVER. He doesn't believe he has the right to decide who lives or dies. He beats people up, sure. Sometimes (especially lately) he will even seriously maim people. But, no matter how much pain he's in, no matter how much grief and anger he's going through, he always stops short of killing, because he believes it's wrong. Always. Even when it comes to Bullseye.

Just to reiterate: Daredevil. Does. Not. Kill. EVER. No matter how much he may want to. If it seems like I'm harping on that fact, it's because I am. Aside from his tremendous compassion for strangers, the biggest thing that makes DD a *hero*, is his tremendous sense of justice and fair play, his willingness to hold himself accountable for his actions (even if he sometimes has to compromise ethically, he has to be dragged into it kicking and screaming), and his recognition that, no matter how much it hurts, he does not have the right to play judge, jury, and executioner. And I am absolutely APPALLED that the moviemakers did not recognize this.

If DD were to encounter a rapist who got off scott-free (which, incidentally, is a case he would never prosecute as Matt Murdock, since he is not a prosecutor, and even if he did, he would never give a closing argument so lame and devoid of logic), he would keep an eye (or an ear, as the case may be) on the guy, and wait for him to break the law again, and then pounce, and present the evidence to the authorities. He would NOT chase the rapist onto some subway tracks and then stand by and jeer while the guy gets run over by a train!!! GAAH! He didn't even do that in the comic when it was Bullseye on the tracks, and he had good reason to truly *hate* Bullseye! In one scene, the moviemakers managed to take every single thing that makes DD a hero, and turn it upside-down.

And I will never forgive them for that.

MATT AND HIS BLINDNESS, SENSES, AND MARTIAL ARTS SKILLS:

In the comics, Matt was hit in the face with a canister of radioactive waste, and woke up in the hospital blind, with all of New York screaming in his ears. This, actually, was well portrayed in the movie - for all of about 20 seconds (before he miraculously learned how to interpret and use an essentially completely alien set of senses).

In the comics, this was somewhat more realistically handled - Matt was terrified for weeks, before a rather abusive blind sensei by the name of Stick basically whacked him over the face and told him to grow up. Then he basically put Matt through months (or years, the comic isn't very clear on this) of boot camp, constantly pushing an eager-to-please Matt to higher skill levels. Matt EARNED those martial arts and acrobatic skills in the comic. They weren't just miraculously given to him.

MATT AND DARKNESS:

As far as I know, in addition to losing his father and finding his body after he'd been shot point-blank in the face (and keep in mind that blind people recognize their loved ones by touching their faces)...

Matt has lost at least 4 girlfriends (to death, as opposed to the countless girlfriends he lost because they left him or turned out to be psychotic killers). Two of them he loved with all his heart, and they were both slaughtered by Bullseye, right in front of him. Also, recently he's been placed in jail and forced to stand by, helplessly, and listen while Foggy got stabbed (apparently to death). Every time something like this happens, Matt goes through a dark, depressed period (which gets darker each time), where he withdraws from his friends and becomes overtly hostile to the people who want to help him. Each time, his actions become progressively more self destructive... and sometimes, downright bizarre, as he struggles to make sense of the chaos and pain inside his head.

...and yet, at the same time, he also becomes somehow *more* self-sacrificing, *more* compassionate to the strangers he helps, *more* determined to spare everybody else the pain that he's been through, and *more* heroic, with each new trauma. And then, through sheer force of will, he works his way through it, always keeping his actions on the right side of the law, and struggling to forgive the idiots who make his life a living hell.

-----

In other words, Matt Murdock, as portrayed in the comics, is a true hero, even though he's dark. A person who proves that even if you have darkness inside of you, you can, if not overcome it completely, at least keep it pushed down. He is a person who is worthy of tremendous respect... the kind of respect that many fans reserve for Captain America.

In contrast, Matt Murdock, as portrayed in the movie, deserves no respect whatsoever. He's a sadistic playboy who feels no accountability for his own actions. He is the exact opposite of the real, deep, tortured, generous, compassionate, intelligent, ethical champion of true justice that's portrayed in the comics.

And that is why I hated the movie. Dislike is far too mild a word. I HATED this movie.

Aside from the complete character asassination of one of the greatest heroes out there, there were a couple of other issues, many of which I imagine were fixed in the Director's Cut:

 - The CGI which ignores little things like the laws of inertia and gravity (in real life, if you take a running leap, the leap will carry you forward. Not 15 feet straight up).

 - The absolutely moronic playground fight, conducted in front of kids, out of costume, apparently because the fighters *liked* each other?

I've said it before, and I'll say it again... I wish so badly that the moviemakers had just used Frank Millar's ""The Man Without Fear"" as a script.

I liked all three of these films and especially Daredevil. It's an introduction to the character and his world that makes for a good movie and has me wanting more. I don't think that's a bad thing. It doesn't give all the best stuff away and paves the way for more to come. Elektra is on the way. I'd love to see Daredevil 2.

And, despite the backlash Ben Affleck endured because of his romance with JLo, he was terrific in the role. In fact, this film worked so well because of the care for the characters and material from everyone involved in the movie. Yet, while watching Daredevil in the theatre and later on DVD, it was more and more obvious that there had been a lot of rampant editing going on for the sake of trimming the film down, which ultimately gave the storyline a choppy, almost throwaway quality that, you could feel by watching, had not been the director's original intention.

I loved a lot of what was done with the character at some of the better points in the comic book, and this maintains the tone of those parts of DD's history. The story is good, Daredevil should be somewhat tormented and his world is dark and gritty (in contrast to Spider-man.)The action is good, but when will moviemakers figure out that CGI just doesn't convincingly replicate people yet? (I had the same problem with some of Blade 2's action sequences.)

The acting is what kills this movie for me. Affleck is OK as Matt Murdock, but pretty awful as Daredevil... DD should be fluid and graceful, and yet in most of the action sequences he looks stiff and wooden. Garner did a great job on the action, but her acting was weak. Farrell as Bullseye was great, very over-the-top (as Bullseye should be.) Duncan did a good Kingpin, too. Unfortunately, good performances from the villians and supporting characters can't overcome the two leads, at least for me.

If you're a big Daredevil fan, give it a shot, but don't have very high expectations. I went into this wanting to love it and came away finding it merely somewhat entertaining. Maybe the forthcoming Electra movie will get it right...",1093996800,,1314,4.6594827586206895

Alright, the main problem, and this carries on throughout the story, is that I expected Morpheus and Neo and Trinity from ""The Matrix"" to show up at any moment.  Or, at least, to see Batman go flying by overhead and pausing ever so slightly to cover the Moon.  Where o' where did Daredevil's super-abilities come from?  Okay, for the sake of comic book fantasy I can buy into a blind superhero with the ability of echo-location.  It makes for some interesting and often cool special effects shots mixing sound and visual action.  But at no point does it make clear why he can suddenly jump off a building, fall for ten stories, then bounce athletically from scaffolding to scaffolding until he lands without a scratch.  By the end of the film Daredevil is jumping from rooftop to rooftop, across four-lane streets!  Also, there are so many moments that rip off ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" that this film is really nothing more than another contrived superhero flick.  Also, contrary to my earlier statement which involved specific special effects, most of the other effects are horrible, looking more like computer game characters battling one another, then editing in close-ups of the character's faces.  It all makes for some surreal continuity and requires a serious suspension of disbelief.  Overall, this is a lame superhero movie with a flat script, bland performances, and ideas stolen from previous blockbusters in the feeble hope at repeat success.

The tone of the film was dark which is what made this film even more enjoyable because it is on par with what the actual superhero comics are. The director of Spider-man could have learned something from this.

Also, I thought some of the violence was gruesome for a PG-13 film. But that goes to show ya how much you can get away with in the movie business these days.

The action scenes were great and the story was very enjoyable and could even possibly rival the first two Batman films (which I still find to be the best comic book-to-movie films to date).

Overall, I find Daredevil to be one of the better comic-book-to-movie films. But Hellboy proved to be a good rival to the film as well. In the end, it just goes to show you that, if handled correctly, comic book heroes can be in great films.",1092960000,,1008,4.317460317460317

I really enjoyed this film and I recently found myself in the graphic novel section of the bookstore picking up Daredevil reprints. The comics and the bonus material on the DVD filled me in on Daredevil's history and it seems that he's been both a devil-may-care 60's comic character and a more dark hard-boiled character. This film tries to bring both versions to the screen and it works. It's a great intro to the world of Daredevil.

 MY CURRENT RATINGS:

 ROTTEN: 5/10 5/10 Movie: Daredevil (2003)

 It seems like every time I watch this movie, I find more things that I like about it, and more things that I hate.

 I like the characters, and the interaction between them. I think the director did a good job with symbolization and art design. I think overall the story is great also, and most of the dialogue is pretty good, but there are just a few things about it I just can't stand.

 * The kid that is supposed to be playing Matt Murdock at the beginning of the movie does great, until he goes blind and gets his superhuman senses. After that, it just seems kind of stupid.

 * The scene where Matt chases down Elektra, and the two people who had never before met, bust out into a fight in the middle of a park for no apparent reason.

 * Michael Clarke Duncan looks way too nice to be the Kingpin.

 There are some other little things that bother me about this movie also. Like where did Matt Murdock get all the money needed to buy all the little gadgets he has? Why does Matt always take off his sunglasses or open his eyes to ""see"" things, when he doesn't even use his eyes to see?

 Bah, why does almost every comic book movie that comes out have to be crap?",1091577600,,1258,4.214285714285714

2276927,2,B0009B0GYA,"I had high hopes for this movie; the cast is great (at least for the female lead, and Kingpin, even though it took me a while to get used to that).  I usually like comics, and the movies they lead to, but this was developed too slowly and overall it was too dark, and I wasn't able to see the Daredevil character as anybody to look up to.  I was extremely unhappy on my first viewing (I may have even fallen asleep), but after my expectations were lowered, it wasn't as bad on future viewings.  I think this was made with the hope of making a franchise, but they really blew it.",1090627200,,578,4.142857142857143
2276928,4,B0009B0GYA,"I'm not a real big Ben Affleck fan. The guys is just way to hyped for my taste, but I must say he was pretty dang good in this movie.

Matt Murdock(Affleck) is blind. He's been blind since he was 12 when chemicals were spilled on his face. However, the chemicals changed him. While his sight was gone all of his other senses were strengthed to compensate for the loss of his eyes. Shortly after his accident his dad a boxer was killed after a fight for not throwing it. Matt had promised his dad to do something with his life so Matt does. He goes to law school and becomes a lawyer.

Matt runs his own firm in Hells Kitchen with Frank Nelson(Favreau). They look out for the little people and are best friends. Matt fights crime by day as a lawyer, but at night he is the superhero Daredevil who is bring down crime and trying to stop the Kingpin(Duncan).

One day Matt comes across a beautiful woman. After a short physical engagement he finds out that the woman is Elektra Natchios(Garner) daughter to a billionaire shipping heir. The two quickly fall for each other, but the Kingpin has declared war on the Natchios family and they aren't safe. The Kingpin has hired Bullseye(Ferrel) to kill them. Know Matt must save the woman he loves before time runs out.

The acting in this movie is great. An all star cast was put togther for it. This movie had one of the biggest casts for a movie in 2003 with Affleck, Garner, Duncan, Favreau, Pantoliano, Ferrel, and cameos by Stan Lee and former Daredevil illustrator Kevin Smith. All of them are great in the movie and there isn't anything  to dislike about them. I can't believe Michael Clarke Duncan put on 20 more pounds for his role as the Kingpin. The guy is huge. I liked Jennifer Garner a lot. This woman is gorgeous and I could watch the movie for her alone.

The special effects are pretty good. They rival the first Spiderman movie. The costumes are pretty good as are the sets. This really was a well made comic book movie.

Daredevil isn't your normal superhero. He's a much darker character. This movie is no Spierman or X-Men but it's good. If you like Superheros or action movies then pick this one up. It's pretty cheap and you won't regret it. It was a surprise hit grossing ove a 100 million in the U.S. so come enjoy what millions of other people have.",1090627200,,2318,4.427230046948357
2276959,5,B0009B0GYA,"I resisted Daredevil, because, frankly, there is such a glut of ?super hero? movies.  Not they are bad, but there are Xmen, Hulk, Spiderman?seems there is always another one, but nothing really that stands outs.  But I must say this movie surprised me.  With engaging performances by Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner in the leads, nice support from bad guys Michael Clark Duncan and Colin Farrell and as the nose-for-news reporter Joe Pantoliano, plus super effects, it?s a fun movie.  There is a driving soundtrack that really sets the mood for the movie,

music that will cause you to go out and buy the soundtrack.

It?s a tight rope act to bringing a comic book story to the screen, too often a movie will take itself too serious, or it comes across as too cartoonish.  Davedevil manages that balance.  You have enough seriousness to keep you hooked, but it has that ?stretch the boundaries? feel to retain the comic book flavor.

The store is the typical line.  The young idealistic kid witnesses his father playing muscle for the local hood.  Shock by the ?fall? of his hero, he runs away and ends up losing his sight to a chemical spill.  The kid fights back and takes the

advantages his other senses now give him and won?t give into the tragedy.  The death of his father, later sending him down the road as the avenger for the downtrodden, the defender of justice.  Garner plays his love interest, but she is a pawn sacrificed by her fathers misdeed.  The romance between Affleck and Garner is solid, the chemistry very believable.  Great fight scenes.  All the mix to make this just a very enjoyable movie in this genre.",1090281600,,1629,4.656140350877193

Lets get the mistakes out of the way first.
1. There was not enough time spent with the Kingpin, we should have gotten his back story as well. [he was white in the comics, but Mr. Duncan did a good job.
2.some moments wee very cheesy. [see foryourself]
3. And finally.....that's it.
The film was actually better then I thought it would be, I mean after the Hulk came out I thought Marvel was slippin. I now see that I should have seen this in theatures. I can just imagine what it would have looked and sounded like on the big screen.
The effecs in this film were off the hook as well, as well as the camera angles courtesy off Ericson Bore. As far as dialouge goes that could have been a little better at times but over all good, that would be credited to mark steven johnson. I also liked the fact that one of my favorite filmmakers shows up, Kevin Smith. That right there alone makes me want to buy it, oh wait I already did. Casting was on point with this on, putting Ben Affleck as Daredevil was like putting Tobey as peter parker it's a perfect match. And Michael Duncan did a good job as The Kingpin Wilson Fisk. I think the addition of Colin Ferrell as Bullseye was key, he did an excellent job. And Jennifer Garrner did an ok job as Elektra, could have been a little better.

2276964,2,B0009B0GYA,"This was clearly a counter-product of Spiderman. Hollywood sees the sucess of a super-hero film, why not shove another down the public's throat?
This film lacked the storyline, slick coreography and indeed general direction of Spiderman. In an attempt to depict another kind of hero: the dark, brooding hero who gets swift and brutal justice, the director failed to give the film any heart, or audience appeal
Only a few things saved my from giving this film a single-star rating:
1) The soundtrack was picked excellently, with great contributions from Evanescence and The Calling
2) The acting talent was far superior to Spiderman (special mention to Affleck - a superb performance, and Matthew Clarke Duncan as the evil Kingpin.
However, it must be said the Garner (though undeniably similar to the cartoon character, beautiful and seemingly deadly), just doesn't manage to shine in this film
A film to watch if nothing else is really available. There aer some moments when the director really seem to get things right, and the actors really bond together well, but those moments are few and far between.

I had kids to raise and stopped reading comics and started working more. The ads for this movie brought back memories of my younger days with Daredevil. I also had mixed feelings and didn't want Hollywood to screw up my hero. I've now watched it on DVD. When the movie ended and the credits rolled I was left feeling pretty damn good.

Affleck surprised me with a good performance, particularly in his non-Daredevil scenes; Garner was gorgeous, but it was hard to swallow her kung fun antics; Colin Farrell was very good as Bullseye--he's the only one who looked like he was having a good time; Duncan is wasted as Kingpin; although a good actor, he was woefully miscast in this one.

The movie is not dark in a Gothic sense at all in my opinion, like an Underworld or something of the sort, the romance was too cheesy and pathetic to give a dark undertone to the movie.  The costumes and martial arts moves were laughable (oh my goodness let me just do a few backflips which will somehow make me avoid dozens of glass shards being thrown at me).

2277000,4,B0009B0GYA,This movie grew on me.  i saw it twice in the theater and many more times on the dvd.  i took objection with some of the liberties the director took with the original story and characters.  i have read every issue of the original comic and know the history and development of the character very well.  i initially recoiled at a black kingpin but eventually conceded that his performance and physical presence was more important than his pigmentation.  jennifer garner looks really sexy but is too campy and silly in portraying what was a very dark character in the books.  i was cringing during the playground dual with matt murdock.  colin farrell was inspired as bullseye.  afleck has stated little desire to do a sequel.  fine.  who needs him.  let someone else zip up the leather and have at it.  foggy was great!  the frank miller born again saga is screaming to be the storyline of the sequel so get on with it.  maybe a spidey crossover?  so many possiblities.  the dvd is very worthwhile with wonderful bonus features.  daredevil is 40 this year.  long live daredevil!!!!!!!!!,1085788800,,1084,4.705882352941177

Yet, I don't believe it was as good as Spiderman or the other Marvel characters. However, this movie is in relation to Daredevil and knowing that movies made by Marvel is worth seeing, I took a chance and watched the DVD. I have no regrets or second thoughts about the movie. It wasn't exactly breathtaking or exhilirating, but the story and plot was well stated and shown. The story of a 12-year old boy being blinded by biohazardous waste, losing his father at 12, becoming a successful lawyer, and New York's vigilante hero is an interesting story. Showing the different periods of his life, the movie made smooth transition through time. Overall, the movie was well made and is a worthy collectors item for Marvel fans.",1085011200,,842,4.73469387755102
2277003,4,B0009B0GYA,"Another dark figure haunting since Draclinghood from the shelves of comic book fane, Dare Devil {played by Ben Affleck} travels high above through the night like some red demon, casting his fearsome shadow upon criminal wastrels throughout the concrete jungle.
Dare Devil is blinded by nuclear waste as a child, although the very same chemical which plunged him into eternal darkness also embued him with heightened senses. He derives his nomenclature and inspiration from a wrestling mentor who was murdered in a back alley by a sore-loser after a match, which then placed him on the road to the dark justice of vigilanteism. He subsequently becomes a lawyer, earning his degree by using braille to excel, and sets out to avenge a rape victim against a lowlife who gets away scott-free...or so he thought. He eventually meets up with ""Elektra Nasches"" {which in the movie sounds rather like ""electric nachos""}, and after a spirited battle after exiting a restaurant in which he desires to date her, she marvels at his skills despite being a blind man, and eventually do begin to date.
""Bullseye"" eventually appears, a bald hoodlum-type with target scarification on his forehead, who utilizes deadly metal spikes to make his point. Under the aegis of The Kingpin {who appears here as a muscular black man, not as the original obese caucasian}, manages to implicate DD as the murderer of Elektra's father, so she embarks upon avenging him, but is dispatched by her own sai by Bullseye {what a waste!}, who of course himself bites the dust.
I loved the effects in this film, displaying microscopic processes and the dynamics of Dare Devil's sonic sensibilities in action, which quite literally do provide him with vision and full awareness of the environment.

It shows he has soul. He's not heartless. He's got conscience. Some people are waaay too serious and stuffy. This movie is supposed to be fun. It is. I liked the action. Bullseye is a trip!

2277006,4,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil comes to life! Rex Smith's take on the Daredevil was okay, but Affleck really nails it. The DVD contains an interview with Frank Miller who says that Superman should go after Wonder Woman not Lois. He's got a point. I never bought Heather Locklear's attraction to the Swamp Thing (then again, she was a vegetarian), Kilmer and Kiddman in Batman Returns, or Dr Who's fling with Grace. Relationships in these kind of things are often crappy, but I must admit that Jen and Ben fit well together. Daredevil and Elektra ""click"".
The dark side of Daredevil is handled well in the movie too. His anger issues are understandable. His religous side is shown too. Some wanted more, but I lked how it was presented. True, we don't hear the entire confession when he tells the priest he was wrong, but I don't think we have to. The scene is left open ended for a reason. The point that he confesses is clearly made.
It doesn't always make sense that Daredevil is as gymnastic as he is, but logic can kill the fun of most fantastic fiction so why bother? Bad guys often steal the show in these types of movies. Nicholson's Joker did it in Batman. Treat Williams' Xander Drax did it in the Phantom. Hackman's Luthor stole the show from Superman, and then General Zod and his crew did the same in the sequel. It's a tradition going back to the days of Charles Middleton's Ming the Merciless. He always stole the show too. Bullseye is no exception. Kingpin is a good baddie, but Farrell takes the cake.
The bonus materials are outstanding. The outtakes from the playground scene are a riot. The interviews with the likes of Stan Lee and Kevin Smith are informative. The director provides great commentary too. All of these, and much more, make for an enjoyable movie experience. While it's not Birth of a Nation, the double disc Daredevil provides plenty for fans of popcorn, action movies, and superheroes to enjoy.",1084406400,,1910,4.653846153846154
2277027,2,B0009B0GYA,"A friend of mine loaned me his copy of ""Daredevil"" a little while back, and I was actually quite excited to watch it.  I knew next to nothing about Daredevil, save that he was blind and that his other senses worked extra-well to compensate for that fact ... beyond that, I was totally in the dark.  I had recently come off of seeing a pair of comic book adaptations not too long before trying out this one: the excellent ""X2: X-Men United"" and the pretty good-but-not-quite-as-much-fun ""Hulk"", so I was pretty sure I would enjoy this one too.  I was sadly mistaken.
To be fair, this film did have a couple things going for it, though one of them is admittedly entirely subjective.  First off, I was interested immediately by the use of Roman Catholicism in relation to the main character.  To be clear, this both interested me and set me on edge ... while I appreciated seeing a character in a movie have the Faith play a notable role in his life, just as it does with mine, it also set me on edge ... I didn't want the church to be portrayed in the wrong way, as it tends to be in movies that I have seen (not in the fact that the Church is insulted, but that the writers' understanding of the Church is sometimes mistaken on a particular point or attitude, which leads to the Church not being properly represented.  I felt the same way when I saw Nightcrawler praying the rosary in ""X2"".  Gladly, I had nothing to worry about from him, and Nightcrawler definitely came out as my favorite character of that film).  I felt the Church itself to be well represented in this film ... Daredevil's actions contrary to her teachings, such as the things he does motivated by revenge, were his own choices.  Good enough for me.
There were two more things I liked about this film, which helps to merit it two stars rather than just one.  First, the whole childhood of Matt Murdock/origin story episode of the film was enjoyable.  Second, I have to say that Colin Ferrell stole the show as the villainous Bullseye, hamming it up to a most entertaining degree and becoming a true bright spot amid the mindless chaos which surrounded him.  If he had been the star, I would never have considered the movie to be a perfect one, but it would have still been incredibly fun to watch ... like seeing a movie just about the Kurgan from ""Highlander""!
Now that I've got the good things out of the way, let's take a look at the stuff I remembered most: the bad.
First off, there's our main characters.  Murdock and Elektra have got to have the worst possible scenes together out of any cinematic couple I've seen in recent history.  Their meeting in the coffee shop or wherever it is is just awful (and he comes off looking like a major creep, if you ask me), and their little fight on the playground was downright embarrassing (made even worse by the awful one-liners they were forced to spout).  Things don't get any better, and there was certainly no sympathy to be found from me when Elektra ... well, let's not spoil it for those who have not yet seen the movie (though I should still tell you not to bother).
I was majorly bewildered and frustrated by Murdock's confession scene after he had 'a bit of fun' with Elektra.  It's one thing not to confess something you aren't sorry for, but if you aren't ... well, shouldn't you be telling the priest about that?  I find it truly distressing that he could be such good friends with a priest and so familiar with the Church and all her practices/disciplines/beliefs and not mention or even think twice about that little detail.  If he had been a non-religious character I wouldn't have given this matter a second thought.
What else is wrong with this movie?  There's the awful music (I eagerly await the day when the world realizes that rap is cra ... crud and stop subjecting us to it), hearing the phrase ""lawyer by day ..."" repeated over and over ad nauseum, the incredible stunts that Daredevil is able to pull off (I actually had to double-check and make sure that he didn't have other superpowers besides his hyperactive senses) ...  If that's really true, I'd like to be able to jump off of buildings the same way he does, and a heck of a lot more.
""Daredevil"" was a complete waste of time, and has soured me from seeing any more comic book adaptations until the third ""X-Men"" film comes out in a year or two.  You know it's a bad sign when you find yourself rooting for the bad guy, which we all know will only result in disappointment if we do.  If you haven't seen this yet, give it a miss and do something else, like go to the library or clean your bathroom sink.  You'll have a better time of it, and if you knew what you were missing you would thank me.

2277028,3,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil is yet another brilliant creation from the bulging brains of Stan Lee. As a kid, Matt Murdock witnesses his father beating up a shopkeeper, and runs away in horror. However an accident leaves radioactive waste covering Matts eyes, turning him bling but boosting the power of his remaining senses.
He becomes more agile, more stronger but the most amazing of all is his radar sight, the ability to 'see' by using soundwaves. But that's a long story.
Daredevil is a good movie. Ben Affleck plays a brilliant superhero, and the performance Colin Farrel gives as bullseye is truly amazing. Even Stan Lee makes a very brief appearence.
But despite it's promising story, Daredevil does have it's flaws. There are certain parts of the film which make you think to yourself...
""Hey, that's just like spider-man"" and other similar thoughts. It just feels like some peaces weredeliberatley ripped from Spider-man. Daredevil is a good film.

2277029,4,B0009B0GYA,"Im an avid reader of Daredevil and enjoyed the film. The writers got a great deal straight from the comics. They also changed the character and his mythos, but that's par for the course. It has changed in various ways in the comics. DD went from a happy ""devil may care"" character (check out the 1964 origin issue and read from there) to a darker brooding character filled with rage and self pity. DD didn't just develop into a darker person, but his new traits were ""retro-fitted"" into his history. In other words, Daredevil has various ""true"" pasts and incarnations.
The character of Stick was a later addition to the DD mythos. Look at the first issue of DD. There was no Stick. DD developed his skills on his own. Stick isn't in the movie, but then it took something like 15 years for Stick to show up in the comics. Elektra was another later addition to the comic. DD's intense rage and insanity weren't there at the start either. Matt's brother has been long forgotten. There are other things that aren't there in the original comics, and ideas from the older comics that aren't in later ones. Many of the retro-fitted ideas into DD's history don't match the original character, but they've kept DD alive.
The changes in the film serve the same purpose as those which have taken place in the comics. DD in the film is much darker at the start. He's more Punisher than Daredevil, but what makes him ultimately not like the Punisher is demonstrated as the film plays out. I think it's a good explanation for why DD is who he is. Given a character that has changed a great deal since 1964, the makers of this movie did very well. There isn't just one way to tell his story or one story to tell. I'm happy with the results and can't wait for more.",1084233600,,1749,4.451713395638629
2277030,4,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil has some very memorable moments. I won't give too much away, but Matt Murdock's medicine cabinet will make it clear that Daredevil isn't the typical superhero. Scenes involving his deep soul searching are striking and memorable. There's plenty that made this movie a must have. The DVD extras are top notch too.",1083801600,,321,5.0754716981132075
2277031,3,B0009B0GYA,"Have never read one single Daredevil comic book in my life I guess my review is kind of unbiased. Okay, I am certainly NOT a fan of Ben Affleck but his presence in this film was an indifferent one rather than an aggravating one.
For those of you who are unfamiliar Daredevil is also known as Matt Murdock, the blind lawyer. But though his eyes do not work his other 4 sense do to a superhuman degree. Sounds, smells, touches and tastes go together to form a bizarre sight that has pros and cons over normal vision. It's pretty cool concept and it's reasonably well done.
But Daredevil has NO plot! It's a swift 90 minutes of practically nothing. The most involving part of the film is the romance between Affleck and Garner but it's cut short with the arrival of Colin Farrell who plays Bullseye, a paper-thin but funny character. Many have been annoyed at the fact that the Kingpin is played by a Black-American actor. But what does THAT matter? Who cares if he's white in the comic book? Michael Clarke Duncan brings some formidable integrity to the role but does come off as a bit too cuddly at the same time.
A tiny bit of story is set up but it's over very soon. I guess the best you could say is that Daredevil doesn't outstay its welcome. But you'll not remember it 5 minutes after seeing it. And I don't like the fact they chose to separate all Daredevil and Spiderman links just because they were licensed to different studios.
The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a very powerful DTS 5.1 track. Plus a bunch of extras I don't care about.",1083369600,,1558,4.43205574912892
2277032,1,B0009B0GYA,"If you thought Hulk and Spiderman were bad movies, then you ain't seen this one. To say it clear and soon: This is the worst super-hero movie ever made. Even Lou Ferrigno's Hulk tv series is better.
And it's not a small feat. The movie is based (or so it seems) on probably the best comic ever published by Marvel, Daredevil as written and drawn by young Frank Miller and Klaus Janson in the early 80s. But the only thing they kept is the character's names (Daredevil, Elektra, Kingpin, Bullseye, etc). Their aspect, personalities, relationships, and the whole plot itself bears no similarity with its source (so I doubt it was ever the source), and the changes are only for the worse. The movie is just too bad to waste time going into depths about how they transformed a great, dark, violent, ambiguous comic into a floppy, puerile, idiot film. It's just the modern hollywood formula: make everything as simplistic, senseless, edgeless, and infantile as possible. And with this flick they reached bottomless depths of derision. Really, it's THAT bad. It's hard to believe that the same industry (well, but not the same studio) spawned the excellent X-Men movies.
I rated it one star because it was the lowest available. But five stars below zero is more like it.",1082246400,,1264,4.776255707762557
2277033,4,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil took the bright vibrant New York City the we all saw in Spider-man, and turned into a Tim Burton style Gothic wonderland.  Ben Affleck did a wonderful job (no matter what any critic may say) in cinematically portraying the comic book hero. The finest performance comes from the girl-next door kick but superwoman, Jennifer Garner.  She played her role with passion and brute toughness. Colin Ferrel also played his role well, but the other villain in the film was too defeatable and he really disappointed me.  The effects were great and so was the drama.  See this if you are a fan of comics or popcorn movies.",1081900800,,621,4.722222222222222
2277034,5,B0009B0GYA,"This is a great movie. Affleck is added to the 'Marvel's comic superheroes list'. Okay so it isn't 'Tow towers' or even 'X-men' but it's still good. You'd think Ben Affleck was a rather odd actor to play a role of a superhero but he actually played it really well. SO is it entertaining? Yes, it is. It's worth it. The fight sequences are fascinating (not exactly the final X-men movie battle though where all the characters reveal their best powers to us). It is funny too. But the main question people ask themselves when a movie like this is made is that is the character true to the original idea? The X-men were perfect, the Archie comic cartoons weren't exactly right, Spider-man was good, Asterix and Obelix was good, Lord of the rings/Two towers was also perfect, and the Harry Potter flicks were also excellent. And so did Daredevil. It was just like the comic. It's important to have some huge fan of the original creation to make the movie a success. In Spiderman's case it was the director and in Daredevil's case it's Ben Affleck. But Affleck and Garner didn't exactly form a great onscreen bond. It may be hard to have that in a superhero flick but 'Jean Grey-Cyclops' and 'Peter Parker-Mary Jane' didn't really have trouble doing that. But the bottom line is that true fans will probably be pleased with this creation. From all the comic book superhero flicks being made, X-men is (hands down) the best of them all. Every character was perfectly chosen, more than I can say of other superhero movies. The movie is in short sinister and an action-packed adventure.
The story revolves around Matt Murdock (played by Affleck) who was blinded as a child by a radioactive accident. But he got great senses, excellent fighting abilities, and other superhuman powers. In the morning he is Kitchen defence attorney. At night he is known to many as 'Daredevil' a superhero that fights crime in the streets of New York (common to all superhero comics/movies except Batman). He leaps from skyscraper to skyscraper. Daredevil's opponent Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), and his deputy-murderer Bullseye (Colin Farrell) also play major roles of difficulty in Affleck's life. Daredevil fights their prevailing forces unaided, until he meets Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner of ALIAS fame), a trained martial artist and super heroine who is after Bullseye and Kingpin for assassinating her dad.
Actually overall the movie is pretty good but there aren't really any 'phrases' and 'scenes' that you would start mentioning over and over again. I mean unforgettable stuff like the way Uma Thurman says 'Poissssson Ivyyy"" in Batman and Robin or the way Robin always said 'let's get to the bat mobile' etc. But you can't have it all. You can't just wait for X-men 2 to come out without watching other superhero flicks. Well you can but it's a bit of a wait so I recommend you see this!
Rating out of 5: 4.5 so I rounded it up to 5
Best scene: When Matt and Elecktra fight eachother
What's the best thing about it? It stayed true to it's comic book!
Worst thing? The cast wasn't all that great. Compared to other comic book movies, it was a lowdown. The casting should have been done by the X-men casting person. The movie (X-men)was so perfect that you actually felt like you were reading the comic books, watching the cartoons, or playing the games! --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title",1081728000,,3420,4.7592592592592595

That's why I like Daredevil. The writers used the comics and animated stories as source material and I was impressed with their research into the character. The origin is different from the book, but true to the one given in the animated Spiderman.

Daredevil is a true Marvel classic. It really is better that Spiderman.",1081382400,,466,4.8375
2277067,3,B0009B0GYA,"First of all, I'm a little disappointed with this movie... Scratch that... I was completely disappointed with it...  The Origin was NOT accurate with the comic book, as Daredevil lost his sight saving an old man from a truck in the comic books.  Additionally, his father's name and boxing nickname was ""Battling"" Jack Murdock, not ""the devil.""  Daredevil's nickname came from the neighborhood kids who used to call him that MOCKINGLY because he was such a frightened, timid little kid.
Also, there was little to no mention of Karen Page, Daredevil's secretary and original love interest, Elektra wasn't originally murdered because of her father's involvement with the Kingpin, but really because of her own (Bullseye wanted revenge from her for taking his job as Kingpin's #1 assassin).
Now, for the positives.  I hate Ben Affleck movies, in general, but his attempt to portray Daredevil was fantastic.  The lighting and mood of the movie were good, and the subtle little items were good, such as the use of Classic Daredevil (and/or marvel) creators as character names in the movie (bendis, mack, quesada, Kirby, etc), and the cameos of Daredevil writers Kevin Smith, Stan ""the Man"" Lee, and Frank Miller (watch the scene where Bullseye steals a motorcycle, but don't blink... you'll miss him).
The other little details are also great... Foggy was cast perfectly, and I'll admit that Jennifer Garner IS good with the Sais, even though I don't think I like her as Elektra.
Overall, this movie makes me think they treated it with the ""second-tier Spiderman"" treatment, in that it's a very similar style of adaptation, and less believable then the Spiderman movie.  I'm not completely disappointed by it (I bought it and haven't put it up for sale on Amazon or Ebay), but wasn't as happy as I could have been (I'm just too much of a purist... I didn't like the Spiderman movie all that much either).  If you liked the Spiderman movie and aren't a complete purist, then you should love this movie... the story and plot follow close enough to the comic book to make it a fun little watch.",1080777600,,2084,4.853521126760564

Ben Affleck NAILED Matt Murdoch. If you disagree then you don't know the character, history, or story of Daredevil that has been in print for so many decades. Matt's brooding, especially when alone. This movie hits it better than Bulls-Eye could hit his target. That made the whole move fantastic. Right, the interaction between Matt and Electra was silly in places (why does she so easily accept his blindness and yet accepts how well he fights and defends himself after knowing him 2 minutes???), and the politically correct move to make Kingpin African-American instead of white which he's been since the beginning was simply a move to garner PC support and DOES detract from the movie for those who know the real storyline of Daredevil and his nemesis. On this DVD, the Producer discusses how nobody could be cast better than the actor who played Kingpin and that may be true but it doesn't excuse the fact they they pandered. If I was African-American, I'd be upset they made the BAD guy black but Hollywood thinks they are being so progressive.

I knew he was a Daredevil fan from when he was a kid so I had high hopes. I wasn't dissapointed. Sure Daredevil isn't Citizen Kane, but it is Daredevil and Elektra, Kingpin, and Bullseye are all here. They also included one of the most interesting things about Daredevil: his faith. What other superhero goes to church?
I also liked how they dealt with Matt's romantic life. In the comics he's had more lovers and tragedy than many comic characters over the years: Heather Glenn, Karen Page, Elektra, Echo, Typhoid Mary, and Glorianna O'Breen to name a few. It's not easy being Daredevil and that point comes across in the movie.
There's plenty of humor in the film too. It's dark, but also fun like a classic comic. The DVD contains plenty of great extras and the movie was obviously made by people who understood the character and I think that's great.",1077840000,,999,4.58659217877095
2277094,4,B0009B0GYA,"""A man without fear is a man without hope.""
Okay, it's not Shakespeare, but for a baby boomer who lost track of Daredevil back in 1969, it's great fun to see my favorite hero at his CGI best.  Back then I preferred Marvel over DC comics, simply because I preferred two-fisted action over complex plots.  Trying to figure out what Lex Luthor and Braniac were up to in Superman dramas just wasn't any fun.  I also thought Marvel's writing and artwork were far superior.  Although I religiously read several Marvel titles, including Ironman, Spider-man, and Doctor Strange, I especially looked forward to the Fantastic Four, which was written and drawn by two Marvel legends, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.  At the time Lee wrote just about everything, while the FF4 was clearly Kirby's flagship.  His massively muscled super beings and fantastic layouts were in stark contrast to Gene Colan's frantic free-style panels featured in Daredevil and Dracula.  I found his sketches oddly appealing and a perfect fit for DD, who's bizarre double-life seemed more than a little sketchy at times.  But, let's face it.  The built-in pathos of a blind super heroe was just too irresistable, and DD quickly rose above the others as my number one super guy.
So, after 35 years, I was anxious to see if the movie would do anything for me.  And, I'm happy to report, It did.  I thought Affleck did a fine job, going from naive ""save the world"" pro bono lawyer to a masked vigilante with action-star ease (even though it seemed out of character at the time)  While the Kingpin was a regular villain in the 60s, Bullseye was new to me.  I thought the ""man without fear"" versus the ""man who can't miss"" subplot was great.  Farrell is another UK actor who can do it all.  I thought Garner did well as Elektra, although I had a hard time seeing her as a master assasin.  I guess I was looking for a more menacing figure, larger, more powerful, etc...  The soundtrack, although not my genre, seemed to add some spice to DD's patented sky-scraper swan dives.  Speaking of which:  Just like in Spider-Man, there were a few instances where the real actor and the CGI counterpart were not exactly seemless.  We can blame Lord of the Rings for raising our perfect CGI expectations.
Anyway, I think it worked.  Sequel?  Jeez, I hope so.  I just don't know how they're going to top Bullseye.  That was right up there with the Joker, minus a ton of dialogue.  Superhero fans have to love this stuff.  Of course, some will like their fare and bit more lighthearted.  I, for one, lean toward the dark side.  Let DC work out happy endings.  Just make mine Marvel!",1077840000,,2623,4.616883116883117
2277095,4,B0009B0GYA,"It was in the 70's that I read my first Daredevil comics. I obtained two back to back issues and was struck immediately by the unusual dark art that created a very different world than most other comics. I believe it was drawn by Gene Colan who also provided the art for Marvel's Dracula.
I was also struck by Daredevil's personal life. Heather was Daredevil's girlfriend, but he was also crazy about a red haired spy/super-heroine named Blackwidow. Reading Daredevil at the age of 9 was very exciting. It was really fun because it was something different, dark and unusual. The passion between Blackwidow and Daredevil drove her boyfriend Hercules (yes THAT Hercules!) crazy and had Captain America and the Beast whispering gossip in a corner!
Daredevil was hospital bound at the time and that was a very different twist too from most super-heroes. He still wore his mask in the hospital, but he had the top of it cut away and the top of his head was bandaged and he was hooked to an I.V. and wearing a hospital gown! He was also tormented by nightmares involving his father. That's all that I recall about those issues, but the idea that Daredevil was something different from the typical super-hero stuck with me over the years.
25 years later that still remains true. All the things that I remember from those comics 25 years ago are in the Daredevil film. Some love it and some hate it, but to me it's definitely Daredevil. The movie lives up to my expectations. Sure the action is far fetched and the bad guys are silly, especially Bullseye, but it's a comic book.",1077753600,,1570,4.630824372759856
2277096,2,B0009B0GYA,"I used to be a big Daredevil comic book fan.  I probably have books ranging over a period of 10 years, though there are some sparse stretches in there.  I haven't read it in the last few years.  If this movie is any indication as to where Daredevil has gone, I'm glad I didn't waste my money on the comics.
In the books, Matt Murdock is a highly-capable, blind lawyer who, much like Clark Kent, is a humble individual.  In the movie, he's cocky, volatile and a show-off with his super-normal abilities.  In the books, he's almost flawless in his Daredevil guise.  In the movie, he's flawed in virtually every aspect, not just demonstrated through his on-screen antics, but by the scars that cover his body.  Makes you wonder how he's survived.  In the books, he's not afraid of commitment and has had several romantic involvements.  In the movie, he apparently just keeps moving between one-night stands.  Never even had a girl over to his place.  In the books, as with most Marvel characters developed in the 60's, he uses violence only to bring criminals to justice.  In the movie, he is judge and juror and uses violence to execute the criminals.  In short, Daredevil and Spiderman were always sort of cut from the same cloth.  But the characters portrayed in the two recent movies couldn't be more different.
Now, had this been a Punisher movie or some other comic character, I would've found it quite entertaining.  But as a Daredevil movie, it was very disappointing because it had almost nothing in common with the Daredevil I remember.",1077753600,,1543,4.705223880597015

The costume were OK, the photography fine, even the first quarter of the film was watchable but once Aflecs character starts matching the girl Electra's moves in the play ground it takes a turn down stupid street and never comes back.
That scene is laughable and sets you up for the equally ridiculous Bullseye sequences.  The character looks like a shlemiel with that insignia on his forhead and acts like a two legged chihuahua. His dispatching of a bartender by hurling paperclips into his throat is mind bogglingly idiotic. I don't even want to know why the Elektra character decides that before she goes out to find her fathers assassin she must first change into  leather haute couture.  Lucky for us she's somehow got Ninja Turtle grade skills with those two extreme daggers. Her brutal killing including a shot of the knife blade lifting away her halter back is tasteless and gratuitous. Characters leap and wall ride just like all the twisting leaping ones we've already seen a hundred times before them.
Bullseye falls off a building onto a car and - you guessed it -survives (because a car can break your fall?)
The cast is weak all around. The script wouldn't even make a good comic book.
Don't see this on the strength of SPIDERMAN. That was a fun movie that built on itself scene to scene. This 80 million dollar work of art falls in on itself instead.
The only thing I can imagine being worse is a DVD released with extra material.

2277099,4,B0009B0GYA,"Exquisite characters and actors abound in this super-hero flick. Farrell steals the show as villians often do in movies. As Bullseye he is one of the very best comic book movie villans of all time. Jen Garner is electrifying and Michael Duncan brings menace and even humanity to the Kingpin. Duncan's Kingpin is a villan, but a human one which makes him more intriguing than most comic book movie villans. Just what made this guy what he is? Ben Affleck nails the lead role perfectly and shows he can be darker than I ever suspected.
As for the supporting cast, Joe Favreau is excellent as Foggy, and it's nice to see Joe Patliano as Ben Urich. Patliano plays the role with great integrity. David Keith is thoroughly believable as Daredevil's dad, and Derrick O'Connor does very well as a priest.
I like the performances and the characterizations in this film a great deal. There are a lot of realistic touches in the performances and the writing that are more human than what I've seen in most super-hero movies. Extremely cartoony moments are plentiful, but the movie is also very human at times and that's something I really appreciate about Daredevil.",1077667200,,1155,4.78

if that movie had been made like Daredevil, we could have all been spared a lot pain and disappointment.
first off, the casting is spot on, especially Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan in the bad guy roles. Ben Affleck plays the Daredevil character well and makes a decent fist of the action, though he is at times outdone by Jennifer Garner.
The fight scenes are well choreographed, taking a few tips from the Matrix, and the special effects are good.
The main thing is the story. if the people behind the last Batman movie had gone for a simple revenge story like this, the movie could have been a lot better.
my reason for constantly comparing this to Batman is that the only main problem with Daredevil is it strives way too much to be ""Marvel Comics Batman"" with the rain soaked look, the moral conundrum about good and bad and the secret room with costumes and weapons. it doesn't stop it from being one of the best comic book movies of the past two years (definitely on a par with Spider Man) but you can't help but feel the memory of the Batman movies gnawing at the back of your mind.",1077667200,,1194,4.45662100456621
2277101,1,B0009B0GYA,"Probably the worst comic-to-film adaptation in a long, long time.  The good news is that Jenifer Garner is well-cast as Electra.  Also, the costume is a well-designed version of the comic book uniform.  The bad news is pretty much everything else.
Ben Affleck is a badly miscast as the lead.  It plays against his strengths as a cocksure young man.  Worse, it exposes his weakness when playing introspective.  Also, he and Garner have about zero chemistry.  That is a liability when their romance is so critical to the plot.
Neither Colin Farrel, not Michael Clark Duncan, are exactly scary as the villans.  Jack Nicholson set the bar fairly high as the Joker, but these characters fail to acheive the more modest menace Willem Dafoe projected from behind that piece of plastic in ""Spider-Man"".
The action is very poorly staged and the adapted plot does not have much in the way fo suspense.  Like a lot of folks, I read the Frank Miller originals and they were much, much better.  My sense is that the film-makers were too devoted to the source material to really adapt it.  They tried to simply transpose it from one medium to another.

2277128,1,B0009B0GYA,"Maybe not the worst ever, but definitely close. How they could have such a huge budget for this film and accept such a horrible story is beyond me.
I've been a pretty big comic book fan for 20 years. While I never got into Daredevil too much, he made numerous guest appearances in my favorite comics, and I was looking forward to this film. Yes, it's a comic book movie, but the level of camp in this film was unreal. There must have been hundreds of cheesy lines in almost every line of dialog during this film, you'd almost think Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote the screenplay. Add to that the ridiculous amount of blind jokes and it was painful to sit through. Okay, Daredevil is blind, and yet has insanely high perception in his other senses, we get it. No need to show endless shots of him doing amazing things with his other senses to hammer this into our skulls. Bullseye has perfect aim and can hit anything he wants to, we get it, no need to show 20 scenes of him using this skill either.
This film takes ""ridiculousness"" to a new level. Daredevil is human. Unlike Spider-Man, he has no genetic mutations. He simply has heightened senses from being blind. The story never proclaims he has anything other than human abilities either. However, there are literally hundreds of stunts that Daredevil does that are humanly impossible, I don't care how great he can here, there is no way he can jump 50 feet in the air, or vault off a 50 story building and land on a fire escape and not break his legs. This guy could give Spider-Man a run for his money for all the advantages they gave him.
By letting Daredevil achieve insane stunts, it creates no sense of weakness for him. You are never left feeling like there is a battle this guy can't win, which is a mistake in film making. Daredevil can scale a 20 foot wall, yet he gets stabbed in the shoulder and that knocks him out for half the film? He can't summon the energy to help out Elektra, his love, yet right after that he can make his way a couple miles across town and get involved in the fight of his life?! This film is FILLED with inconsistencies, mistakes, and just absurd events that would require a complete suspension of belief reality in order to enjoy this film. I expect comic book movies to take some license, but this film makes ""Armageddon"" look like it was taken straight from the film vaults at NASA. And with all of this absurdity, there is no way to enjoy this film as a campy popcorn movie. I would consider ""Tomb-Raider"" a masterpiece in comparison.
Perhaps the biggest flaw with this film is the CGI. For a recent movie, this is some of the worst CGI effects I have ever seen. None of it looked realistic. I can't think of a single special effect that I would believe. Remember that scene in Spider Man where Toby Maguire gets his new powers and starts jumping 50 feet in the air from roof to roof? Imagine an entire movie of that. They may as well have left the blue screens and wires in. At least Mark Steven Johnson admits on his commentary that the CGI is crap.
Did I mention that Bullseye (with a horrible performance by Colin Farrell) actually cuts someone's throat with a playing card in this film and kills a man by throwing a paper-clip into his neck?!
That being said, if you like this film, the DVD is loaded with bonus features. The audio and video come across very well, and the featurettes are fairly well done. This DVD has everything you could want if you're a fan of the film.",1077321600,,3471,4.416536661466458

I caught it on cable the other night, though, and I've got to say that despite the film's many flaws, I enjoyed watching it.
The flaws:
The first thing that struck me as silly was the scene where Daredevil and Elektra fight in a playground.  Well, the silly thing was that it was Matt Murdock (sans disguise) and Elektra fighting.  I couldn't help but think the man has no clue about what it takes to preserve a secret identity.
I also felt that the daredevil costume was poorly tailored.  The mask didn't look right, and the rest of it seemed to bunch up in weird places.  It was distracting.
Also, while the action was well choreographed and often creatively shot, the director (or somebody) didn't know when a move or a stance looks right.  When I see Jennifer Garner fight on ""Alias"", she's totally convincing, but here, both she and been Affleck often seemed to be off balance or moving awkwardly.  Better direction or editing could have fixed that.
Oh, and the dialogue was kind of weak all around. That's actually pretty forgivable for a comic book movie, but I don't like that it was bad enough to notice.
The good stuff:
The plot wasn't bad at all, and Ben Affleck did a pretty decent job with the substandard dialogue.  The visual style of the film worked pretty well, and the special effects were solid.  The action choreography and cinematography were solid, too.
Plus, hey, it's got Jennifer Garner...  That's almost enough to make up for any flaws.

It's never boring! I guess the playground scene would also have to be cut to make this a slightly better movie, but as unrealistic as it is I still like the playful mating dance between Elektra and Matt Murdock/Daredevil in that scene. The movie soundtrack is great. Bullseye and Kingpin are a little different, but no less cool than in the comic.

Those who got it know, it's a fun way to show Elektra's fighting prowess and the compatibility between Elektra and Matt.

This movie was just so vapid- especially compared to Spiderman which took pains to develop the characters and bring out their humanity, building an action movie that was also emotional. Daredevil was just missing something essential and epitomized Hollywood blockbuster film at its worst. The only thing I can say is the bat-style sonar effects were well done.

Parts of this movie will just have you scratching your head.  For example, shortly after Matt (Affleck) and Elektra (Garner) meet, they somehow start fighting.  Why?  As Matt says, ""Does every guy have to go through all this just to find out your name?""  The dialogue is poor, the story lame, the plot devices almost unbelievably cheesey, and the fight scenes ridiculous.
That said, Colin Farrell is one of the best and baddest villains ever as the maniacal Bullseye.  Farrell steals almost every scene he's in by portraying a fascinating balance of fear, awe, and laughs.  The movie is *almost* worth seeing just for the sheer genius he infused in his part.
Oh, one other thing - Jennifer Garner really needs to put some clothes on in this film.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of comic book romance.  But she reveals so much physically and has so little depth as a a character that it's distracting, almost to the point where it feels like she's being prostituted for the sake of making guys watch the film.  To be effective, she should have been more more than just a sex object.

Daredevil the movie borrows liberally from that timeframe, after developing the lengthy back story of Matt Murdock's `blinding and awakening'.  I frankly didn't mind Affleck as Matt Murdock.  He certainly played him a lot more tortured than I remember from the Miller era. Duncan as Wilson Fisk aka the Kingpin, also interesting but manageable.  Colin Farrell as Bullseye and Jennifer Garner as Elektra round out the cast nicely.  The final death scene of Elektra is hauntingly familiar to fans of the comics, Bullseye uses the same dialogue leading up to `but me, I'm magic..' and who can forget that impaling on the sai with the tip extended through the body but not the clothes, making a small tent.  Yikes.  Garner doesn't bring the darkness inherent in Elektra out, but she actually did a pretty good job if you don't bring any preconceptions into the theatre.  I actually thought it was a pretty good film within in the confines of what it attempts to do.",1076544000,,1299,4.789237668161435
2277150,1,B0009B0GYA,"I don't even know where to start with this one... This is one of the worst movies I could have ever imagined being created, and this is one major blow for the entire fad of making comic books into movies.
First, I'll start with the ""plot"". It is terrible and unbelievably thin. The love story makes the one in ""Gigli"" look stunnungly realistic. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner meet, she makes fun of blind people, she leaves. They have a cheesy kung-fu fight in a park, and then they're in love. Happens all the time, right? The rest of the story is not even worth mentioning.
The acting. Affleck is the worst super hero of all time. Every line he utters is completely laughable, but I guess some of that has to be placed on the heads of the writers. Even Jennifer Garner, who is beautiful and actually a decent actress most of the time, is wretched. Colin Farrel really only gets to utter one line throughout the film , and his character of Bullseye is one of the cheeziest villains of all time. He makes Mr. Freeze look pretty cool. Michael Clarke Duncan comes in and out of the movie at such strange intervals, that his unimpressive performance is nothing worth noting.
The fighting and stunts here are nothing special. In fact there are at least a dozen movies out right now with better fight sequences, none of them involving a blind man who can actually see, you know, as long as it's raining.
All this said, isn't it great that they are probably going to make a sequel to this filth?",1076544000,,1490,4.461538461538462

Ben Affleck tries to incorporate the magic of the Spider-man movie into this steaming pile of crap, but everything about it is awful.  Jennifer Garner's character has no depth, Jon Favreau is annoying and does not make the film any better, and Affleck is not believable as a super-hero with great fighting skill.  Cuba Gooding Jr. would have been GREAT as Daredevil and is a much better actor than Affleck ever was.  Even Silent Bob would be a better Daredevil than Affleck.

2277152,4,B0009B0GYA,"I can't believe I'm writing this:  I enjoyed this movie.
I normally don't get into comic book plots about superheroes.  The ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" movies convinced me to stay further away.  As to the Incredible Hulk, if I want to see a giant green man I'll pick up a can of peas.  So with great trepidation, wailing, and gnashing of teeth (all six of them) I sat down and watched this DVD.
Knock me over with a feather.  DAREDEVIL entertained the daylights out of me.  From the predictable set-up of the story, to the rock 'em sock 'em action, to the great special effects, to the one-dimensional villains, this movie had me grinning like my cat after the goldfish disappeared.  I like to think the film succeeded because I sensed a tongue-in-cheek satire of all the other superhero yarns that clutter the Marvel Comics playground.  Looked to me like everyone involved with the production of this movie had a good time making it, primarily because no one took themselves too seriously. They just went with the flow, which is what the viewer should do; let the story suspend your stodgy sense of disbelief and take you for a ride with the blind, red leather crime fighter as he frolics and flies around Manhattan's skyscrapers.
I can't believe I'm writing this, either.  I actually liked Ben Affleck in this movie.  (But not enough to suffer through ""Pearl Harbor"" again.)  Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan are superb menacing, grimacing, bloodthirsty villains.  And Jennifer Garner adds admirable buns of steel.  Enhanced by a fantastic soundtrack, DAREDEVIL delivers a solid entertainment punch.  Clark Kent would be jealous.

2277153,4,B0009B0GYA,"I just watched this last night on the cable premiere, & was surprised because it wasn't exactly like I expected.  First of all, like some have mentioned, it is very dark (maybe that's what I liked about it).... the background itself, & the subject matter.  I'm not familiar with the comic book, so this is totally based on viewing the movie.  It's certainly not as happy-go-lucky as Spiderman, so if you're expecting that, it might disappoint.  There are some rather sad things that happen in the movie, but afterwards, I'm thinking, well, I did keep watching it.... & even though most people like & expect happy endings, the fact is that life is not full of them.  You can actually feel the pain of the characters... so in that respect, I didn't mind so much that it didn't have a totally happy & predictable ending.  The visual effects are cool of course, & the music is good too.
As far as the acting, I don't think you have to be a huge Ben Affleck fan to appreciate it... I'm saying that cuz yah, I'm REALLY sick of the whole J-Lo thing, but don't let that keep you from seeing him act.  He's not bad... I've only seen him in Kevin Smith movies like Dogma, so it was nice to see him do another character.  And speaking of Dogma, it's interesting that Kevin Smith was involved in this... I'm sure that contributed to my appreciation for this film.  I haven't even seen Garner & Farrell at work, & I think they both did a good job too.  They made Garner look really lovely, & I thought her outfit she wore on the cover/fight was really cool.  Farrell was a really good villain, & he fit the part almost too well.
A few downsides:  yah, the playground scene was kinda too Matrix-ish like someone said, but I think it can be overlooked.  And like I said earlier, some of the events that are down right sad might be aggravating to some cuz sometimes they were a little drawn out...even I was thinking at times ""geez, could his luck get any worse?""  But it kinda reminds me of listening to depressing music, as I often do...if you don't mind the reality of it, it might actually make you feel better... or maybe I'm just weird like that.  All in all, I actually agree with the reviewer rating here of 3 & 1/2 stars, but since I had to pick, I give it a 4... just going with the majority, & I'm in a good mood.  If you like other super-hero/vigilante movies like Batman, Spiderman, & The Crow, you'll be able to appreciate this as well.  I love fantasy/action movies like this, so I would definitely see this again.  Cheers.",1076198400,,2522,4.375536480686695
2277154,4,B0009B0GYA,"This movie was a lot better then I expected (just goes to show you that you cant always trust what reviewers have to say).  I watched this with my wife and son and all three of us enjoyed it.  True it was a little silly in parts but it was a lot more believeable then say ""Charlies Angels"" or ""The Hulk"".  This was a fun movie to watch and unlike a lot of movies in this genre I never got bored watching it.  It had some very nice camera work and some really good special effects as well as some of the most interesting villains Ive ever seen.",1076112000,,543,4.0
2277155,4,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil is a more satisfying comics based action movie than I had expected.  Like all Marvel heroes, he is troubled and battles his internal demons as much as he fights the bad guys (in fact, they all have more success with the bad guys than their personal problems).  This movie has a pervasive sense of loss even greater than Spiderman or Hulk.
Ben Affleck is pretty good as the sightless hero who aches over his murdered father (very well played by David Keith).  Jennifer Garner is beautiful and athletic - a fine choice for Elektra Natchios.  The rain effects that allow Daredevil (Murdock / Affleck) to ""see"" her are neat and touching (although one does wonder why wind currents wouldn't do the same thing).
I also enjoyed Colin Farrel as Bullseye and Michael Clark Duncan as The Kingpin.  It does seem to me that the whole conflict with Kingpin is a bit underdone.  The big fight in the movie is with Bullseye, but he is just a paid assassin.  Daredevil has an even greater reason to hate Kingpin and yet that fight is fairly simple and over in a few minutes.
Jon Favreau is terrific as Murdock's law partner and comic foil and Derrick O'Connor adds a lot as Murdock's priest, confessor, and father figure.  Joe Pantoliano is always good, and here he plays the smart reporter who is trying to figure Daredevil out.  Good acting.  All of this could have been so much less than it ended up being, but the quality of acting adds some depth to these characters that makes it more enjoyable.  My youngest son wants there to be a Daredevil II and I wouldn't mind seeing it with him.",1076112000,,1585,4.545774647887324
2277166,4,B0009B0GYA,"This well-cast movie packs a lot of story into one film.  I remember growing up that Daredevil was always different than other comics after all what other hero was sightless?  Also, the artwork of Gene Colon was much more like the artwork of the Dark Knight versions of Batman that come out in the mid-80's.  The movie had the same feel.  It was a heck of a lot better than the Val Kilmer/George Clooney Batman films but nowhere near the Spiderman movie.
As in the comic, Matt Murdock grew up in Hell's Kitchen in lower Manhattan.  His father was a fighter that went against a mob boss and decided not to throw a fight.  He winds up murdered as a result.  Matt is involved in a street accident where some radioactive waste gets in his eyes, removing his sight highly enhancing his other senses.
Matt graduates law school and becomes a Legal-aid lawyer for the people of the neighborhood with his pal Foggy Nelson.  The neighborhood crime is being controlled by a powerful mob boss nicknamed, The Kingpin.  Matt, using his enhanced abilities trains himself to become a masked vigilante named Daredevil who tries to thwart the Kingpin's activities (the Kingpin was behind Matt's father's murder).
With his business seriously wounded, Kingpin employs a hired assassin called Bullseye.  Bullseye can make a weapon out of any object by throwing it with pinpoint accuracy at his intended victim.
Matt meanwhile meets a Greek heiress named Electra.  The two begin dating.  During a business squabble the Kingpin has Bullseye kill Electra's father, causing her to become a vigilante herself set on getting revenge.
There is one corny scene where Matt and Electra mix it up in a battle in a children's playground.  It looked like the director wanted to just throw in a scene from The Matrix.
I don't want to give too much more of the film away, but if you had followed the storyline in the comics you probably know how the film will turn out.  I know I highly enjoyed this film.  Colin Farrell is phenomenal as Bullseye and Jennifer Garner looks hot as Electra.  The actor who plays Kingpin has been in a lot of movies lately and he had to gain weight to play a convincing Kingpin, which he does well.  The movie will probably not appear to smaller children because of the blood and violence but anyone that liked The Matrix films should really like this one!  It is one of the films that is better to own than rent because you can watch it over and over.",1075939200,,2446,4.622685185185185

Ben Affleck is terrible, as always.  Jennifer Garner, who only looks like she does on the cover after she gets mad, fights a bunch of sand bags that miraculously fall from her ceiling and goes out and almost gets instantly killed by Bullseye. (so I heard she's not really dead, I just hope there's not a sequel so I can find out)  The effects were so AWFUL. Does anyone realize that CG effects are almost never well done? (Except in LOTR and anything that Spielberg uses them in)  And the character of Daredevil...so when you're blind you can jump real high?

Daredevil is an acceptable movie equivalent to a comic book and it packs plenty of punch. It's fast paced, and maybe too much happens too quickly, but it's never dull and entertains.

Not GREAT but definitely worthy of your hard earnd $ if you factor in the behind-the-scenes footage of the film and the history behind the Daredevil saga.
I think Jennifer Garner radiates as Electra not only in her beauty, but her brawn. She kicks butt in this flick and Collin Farrel is a convincing pysco.

2277172,5,B0009B0GYA,"Boasting an all-star cast, killer soundtrack, an amazing DVD, Daredevil truly delivers on all cylinders here.
Ben Affleck plays Matt Murdock, a man who was blinded in an accident as a child, and because of this incident, his other senses adapted and grew stronger than sight. By day, he is a lawyer in a business with college friend Foggy Nelson (Jon Favreau); by night, he is a vigilante seeking justice through any means--the Man Without Fear, Daredevil. Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano) is a reporter who is seeking the scoop on Daredevil, and believes he is not just a New York urban legend, but a true vigilante. Matt's life changes when Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner, the hottest actress on Earth), steps into his life, becoming Matt's girlfriend. Unfortunately, Elektra's father has just stepped out of connections with the crimelord Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), and Kingpin hires an Irish assassin with perfect aim, Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to kill Mr. Natchios. This all leads to chaos, and when things go awry Matt and Elektra must seek justice in their own ways, against the evil Bullseye and Kingpin.
Bringing to life another of Stan Lee's fantastic Marvel Comics creations, Daredevil is an amazing movie with a good score by Graeme Ravell (The Negotiator) and soundtrack with such bands as Fuel, Drowning Pool featuring Rob Zombie, and Evanescence (this movie really got them off the ground).
The only thing I have to fret is casting Duncan as the Kingpin. Nothing against Mr. Duncan or black people, but the Kingpin is a huge, hulking Caucasian man, fat, not muscular. They should've kept it that way. But I thought he played the part given to perfection. Garner, of Alias fame, is also amazing as Elektra and may be one of the best parts of the movie alone.
The action scenes are also tremendous, and the ""radar"" Daredevil possesses is greatly brought to screen.
The impressive 2-disc DVD collection brings the picture quality in 2.35:1, and audio soundtracks in Dolby Digital 5.1 & DTS 5.1, both amazing soundtracks.

2277186,3,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil is a good comic book movie with some great moments. Affleck is better than I thought he'd be, Garner is beautiful, Duncan is great as Kingpin and Colin is fun. Some say David Keith's character was totally wrong, but that's how his character is in other versions of the story. Check out the Spiderman Vs Daredevil DVD. How DD goes blind is the same in that version as in the movie so they drew from existing DD lore.
The fight between Elektra and Bullseye was right out of the comic! Unlike some, I don't think waiting ten years before Bullseye and Elektra's big scene would have been too practical and don't mind that they gave it to us up front. I can't wait for the Elektra movie! I also thought that scenes like the return of DD's strength in the church was the type of superhero stuff that has a place in a superhero movie, and liked the way DD heard Ben's car with his super hearing and used it. It didn't contradict DD's scene with the Kingpin at all.
The movie paints with a broad brush Murdock having fun with his powers more than he should if he want's to keep his secret identity, but DD's secret identity has been revealed in the comic and he always shared his identity with too many people anyway. The playground scene was so much like the one with DD and Echo in the comics and I thought it was so over the top it was fun. Stan Lee often made things over the top.
Ben Urich, Bullseye, and the Kingpin may not look identical to the characters in the comics, but that's often the case when comic books are turned into movies. I wish the DD costume had been a tiny bit closer to the comic book type, but it wasn't bad. According to the DVD DD almost ended up wearing a sweat shirt with a hood and some of the other costumes tried are awful! The director makes it clear he wanted the comic styled costume and even put in a reason for DD to button the top button of his movie costume towards the end of the film so he could look even closer to the way he does in the comic and I thought that was clever.
There's room for improvement, but Daredevil is a good superhero movie. I'll be in line for DD2 and look forward to an Elektra movie. Amazon also has Spiderman Vs Daredevil and DD's best comic adventures too.",1074038400,,2229,4.247058823529412
2277187,4,B0009B0GYA,"just watched the movie Daredevil two nights ago and can say that I'm very impressed with how good it was. I wasn't really looking forward to watching it after hearing how bad it was from so many people (and because it had Ben Affleck in it), but I soon found out how wrong they were after watching this film.
Daredevil is just very entertaining from start to finish. It has good acting from everyone in it, with some actors owning their roles and really impressing me. The story is told nicely and progresses very well throughout the film.
But with every good movie, there always has to be something bad in it. One thing that most fans of the comic are quick to point out is the fact that Kingpin was white in the comics, but is black in this movie. This didn't really bother me, seeing as how Michael Clarke Duncan is excellent in the role and also for the simple fact that I have never read the comic before. I also didn't like how the CGI and live action of the movie would constantly switch back and forth so quickly; it gets very annoying sometimes. Most of the problems here, though, are just minor details that most likely will not affect your view on the movie.
Overall, the good weight out the bad in this film, as it has to be one of the best superhero movies I've seen in awhile(YES, I even think it's better than X-Men, but not as good as X-2). Strongly recommended for both fans of the comics and fans of good movies.",1073865600,,1430,4.319702602230484

I don't even want to mention how many novels Ive read that have gotten mangled into movies. Daredevil isn't exactly everybody's favorite character so I never thought I'd see anything this close to the comics on a mainstream movie screen. It could have been so much less dark and gritty and kiddie oriented. They made some changes, and there are flaws, but it's still very good.",1073865600,,609,4.922330097087379
2277189,4,B0009B0GYA,"The last time I saw a live version of Daredevil and the Kingpin was in Trial of the Incredible Hulk and it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for (sorry John Rhys Davies). After that I wasn't sure what to expect from a Daredevil movie, but this time around I was pleasantly surprised. I imagine that Daredevil was a tricky hero to capture on film since he began largely as a Spiderman copy and then as time went on developed into something much more interesting. I suppose they could have gone with the earlier version of him, but I'm glad they chose to focus on the darker devil instead of the incarnation of the early days (sorry Stiltman). Despite the fact that he was too much like Spiderman and thus a second stringer, I enjoyed Daredevil's classic 60's adventures and there was always a certain amount of fanciful moments and villains that were far from realistic, but provided much needed escapism. This film entertained me in the same way while drawing on the more recent version of the character to make him something different and more individual.
I liked this film a lot and thought it got far more right than wrong. It's too bad they jumped the gun in order to get the Elektra movie off the ground while Jen Garner is hot (and how hot she is) instead of saving some of these characters and situations for later films, but I still thought this was a vast improvement over the version of the characters given to us in Trial Of The Incredible Hulk and far closer to the characters in the book than I expected. Despite some changes I thought the dedication to the comic was obvious and darned impressive and it was a lot closer than most super hero films I've watched. I do have mixed feelings about the fight scene where Murdock basically gives away his identity by flaunting his abilities in order to woo Elektra, but I must admit I enjoyed it even if it is silly. I have to give Daredevil it's due for providing me with an entertaining few hours and bringing some of my favorite characters to the screen in an entertaining way.",1073865600,,2036,4.490566037735849

Duane Thomas gave an excellent review of the differences between the comic reality and the movie reality, and how stupid were some of the changes made in the movie. Suffice it to say that nearly every change they made led to a vastly inferior product. But there was another flaw that I think is important that I didn't see other people bring up, which is the notion of ""compression."" In the original Miller series, the Elektra - Bullseye - Kingpin - Daredevil relationships were built up over about a YEAR of comic issues. There was a LOT of background information given about all the characters before the battle between Elektra and Bullseye, so that when Elektra got killed, it was a really big deal. In the movie, it was like ""easy come, easy go!"" Or ""Elektra, we barely knew ya."" And the best part of the climactic comic issue was that it was told from the point of view of Bullseye, allowing the dark comedy to be played up to its fullest. In contrast, the movie was so rushed in character introduction that we had very little clue about why anyone was acting the way they did. In the comic, the Kingpin is actually a very interesting character. In the movie, he barely makes any sense. Not unlike the closing battle scene between him and Daredevil. It was all just a very amateurish attempt to take one of the great comic book story lines and stuff it into too small of a box. It's unfortunate, because if they had built up to this climax in say the 5th movie, they would have had a real franchise. This is the way the X-men movies are going with the Jean Gray / Phoenix saga. In a couple of years, the movie rendition of X-men #137 is going to knock people's socks off. The movie rendition of Daredevil #181 *should* have knocked people's socks off, but they diluted it with too many other plot lines and inane, made-up stuff like Matt Murdock giving his identity away in front of 30 people.

2277192,3,B0009B0GYA,"In Brief
Based on the Marvel Comics character created by Stan Lee and Bill Everett in 1964 Daredevil focuses upon a man blinded as a child in a freak chemical accident but whom some may say can see better than those with sight.  He dwells in a world of eternal darkness that is filled with scents, tastes, textures and sounds and his keen awareness allows him not be hampered by the fear that sight may induce.  By day, Matt Murdock represents the downtrodden from his shoestring law firm, while at night - haunted by the death of his father - he stalks the streets, relentless in his pursuit of justice where the guilty often find, there is hell to pay!
Review
Opening with a credit sequence that sees a CGI recreation of a Manhattan skyline at night swept through with ease by a free flying camera that discovers various nightlights that merge to form Braille print that subsequently morphs into the various names of Daredevil's stars, one is instantly given the theme of the movie.  Ben Affleck's portrayal of Daredevil sees him create a distinct variation on the shadow play and angst that generally drives the superhero desire to vanquish all evil.  This is a man who has learnt not to fear, bullied as a child he has overcome his physical weaknesses and learnt to use his inflicted blindness to his advantage.  Yet the death of his father haunts him and his search to discover the Kingpin's (Duncun) identity propels him to fight crime whatever the cost may be.
While similarities can be seen between Tim Burton's original Batman, as we witness our crime fighter destroy both thugs and powerful villains alike, from the darkness of an alley to the airiness of a corporate environment such as a courtroom, there is something distinct in this reworking of the little know Stan Lee classic.  Indeed, I must admit to being surprised at the enjoyment I felt in watching Affleck and indeed the powerful Elektra (Garner) defeat a steady flow of bad guys.  Like Xmen, there isn't a rush to thrown an audience into a comic they know nothing about as the story is built apace, with both intelligence and a believability that one generally is not accustomed to in such a film.
Like John C. Reily and Steve Buscemi manage to steal their films with very little screentime so does another character actor, Joe Pantoliano, succeed as the hidden star of Daredevil.  Playing New York Post investigator Ben Urich, Pantoliano brings a credibility to this superhero fable that very few actors could have.  But his chance at the title for stealing the show is knocked clean out of the room by Colin Farrell's Bullseye: an Irish villain that never misses.  It may be surprising that a character with a target tattooed on his head does so well to both entertain and create a believable threat to the hero of the piece but then again anyone that flicks a peanut into an elderly lady's mouth to shut her up on his long haul flight has got to be evil enough to possibly defeat Daredevil, even if he is flying economy class!
The Verdict
While it did have one continuity error of note involving a clock on a subway platform, Daredevil is a competent action movie that relies more on old-school storytelling rather than OTT CGI.  Besides any film the cameos Kevin Smith has got to be worth your time.  The bottom line is that Daredevil doesn't patronise and is satisfyingly entertaining without pandering to the merchandise friendly 12A kids market it instead opts to tell a dark tale that will excite and thrill, just try to forget that Affleck is dressed in red leather.",1073433600,,3549,4.688102893890675

2277194,4,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil is a good film that get's trashed by various people including comic fanatics who are not happy that elements of the comic were changed when the story was brought to the screen, and by people who wanted Daredevil to be Spiderman 2. Those who felt that Daredevil was not enough like Spiderman are right, but I prefer it when Daredevil is much more than just a clone of Spidey. Stan Lee may have made Daredevil very similar to Spiderman when the character was introduced, but as the years have passed various writers have made DD his own man.
  Daredevil's origin has been altered in the film so that things are not as simple or clear cut as in the original Lee origin. Some complain that since Matt doesn't become blinded while saving somebody it reduces him as a hero, but Spiderman getting bit by a spider isn't a heroic act and there are so many other examples where super hero's gain their powers and then evolve into the hero they become and Daredevil is all about evolution. One evolving character is Jack Murdock who is a much more complicated character in the film and reflects the more complex nature of characters from the last two decades of the Daredevil comics. The irony of Matt saving a blind man only to become blind has been replaced with the more moving irony of Jack becoming a better man after his behavior played a role in Matt becoming blind and being killed because of his rediscovered morality. I thought that was a nice touch which echoed throughout the film as DD struggled with his own morality and the choices he made.
  The number of elements in the film directly inspired from the comic are astounding although it seems it was a struggle to use the DD suit in the movie and I applaud the director and those who fought for a suit that was very close to the one in the comic. Also Bullseye's appearance is different from the comic, but then so is Wolverine's costume in the X-Men films and I personally think Bullseye's look in the film is great and he's been portrayed that way in the comic book lately. One reviewer on here is unhappy that the Kingpin is African American in the film, but where in the comic does it say he belongs to the Mafia and has to be white? I'll never forget complaints about Mystique looking different in X-Men so you can't please everybody.
If you are not a stickler for minute details these changes will not interfere with your enjoyment of the film and similar differences can be found in the X-Men or Spiderman films from their comic roots. It's not easy distilling decades of a comic book story into a feature film, but Daredevil does a great job. It makes Daredevil a more complex character than Lee first presented, but he's grown and changed a lot over the years and the film tries to convey that to an audience who may not be familiar with the comic while staying true to an astounding number of elements from it's source of inspiration and obviously being made by a fan of the comics for other Daredevil fans.",1073001600,,2982,4.506469500924214

Great cast, great action, and despite some less than stellar digital moments it's far better than many critics would have you believe. Daredevil isn't flawless, but then that's the beauty of the hero and the movie.",1073001600,,356,4.666666666666667
2277196,4,B0009B0GYA,"I have to agree with Mauricio J. Heilbron Jr, MD in that this film gets slammed more than it deserves. While nothing mind blowing, I have to say this story was better than Ang Lee's HULK. My only real knock on it is there was spots that should've been explained like how did Matt Murdock get through school and into college? Where did he live during that time between his lawyer/Daredevil days and the days after his father's death?

Still, I believe this film is the victim of the ""Spider-Man"" shadow. Don't get me wrong, I loved Spider-Man but it seems that every film based on a Marvel Character (with the exceptions of X-Men and Blade) gets compared to Spider-Man and I think that's so unfair. DD especially gets it because despite his own great history, most in the mainstream remember him as a on/off partner of the famous wallcrawler (though I would love if one day they did a film with those two teaming up).

Anyway, Ben Afflick is okay as Daredevil. Jennifer Garder did surprise me as Elektra. Colin Ferrel is excellent as Bullseye and Michael Clarke Duncan does a very believable Kingpin!

I recently bought the blu-ray version of this film and it is great! It features the director's cut of Daredevil (which is the superior version in my view) and all the special features from BOTH the original 2 disc theatrical release and the original director's cut release! This improved film along with the bonus features make this THE version of DD to own!

On the D.C. version, it goes from basically a hero looking for revenge for the death of his father and lover (Elektra) to a darker, more brooding anti-hero who seeks redemption. It also shows the Kingpin as more of a threat than the original theatrical release did and it features a subplot that makes the film make more sense and ties it together better! In one of the bonus features, it is revealed the reason the subplot was removed was for 1. time and 2. to make it PG-13 so that younger viewers could see it.

While I know you have to do what the studio wants (and it wanted a PG or PG-13 film), DD is best told as an R-rated type film. While he isn't The Punisher, he isn't Spider-Man either. I personally wish this would've been the film that would've gotten released.

Well, I digress and say that if you want to see this film and have a blu-ray player or a machine that plays blu-ray discs, GET THIS VERSION!",1072915200,,2378,4.505800464037123

2277198,4,B0009B0GYA,"20th Century Fox has had tremendous success with a previous superhero film, so it was no wonder that they decided to go ahead and start up another franchise. In 2000, X-Men, based on the famous Marvel comic-book superheroes, opened to $54 million and finished with nearly $160 million at the domestic box office. With this success, the trend of superhero films began. Fox has decided to create a film based on another superhero after the tremendous success of Sony's Spider-Man in 2002. Though the character of Daredevil is one of the lesser known comic-book superheroes, Fox is hoping that big names stars like Ben Affleck and rising star Jennifer Garner from ABC's Alias will help bring in a big enough audience to recoup the film's $75 million budget. The studio is also hoping that by placing the film in the month of February, there will be very little competition against the action flick. But will the film version of Daredevil be accepted by the American audience or will the film be blinded by its own hype?
The story centers on the life of Matt Murdock. His father, Jack Murdock, is a famous boxer who has fallen from his golden days. One day Matt finds his father robbing a man to make a living for his son and runs from his father. As he runs, Matt gets involved in an accident that robs him of his ability to see. But the chemical that took his sight gave him in exchange a radar-like super sight and heightens the abilities of his other four senses above most normal human beings. Despite his handicap, Matt helps his father rise back to his old form but when his father refuses to take the fall during a fight, he is killed. From that moment, Matt dedicates his life to protecting the innocent and creates the secret identity of Daredevil. Matt's life is complicated enough as a lawyer during the day and Daredevil at night but things become more complex when he meets the beautiful Elektra. As things begin to heat up between Matt and Elektra, the Kingpin has plans for both Elektra and Daredevil as he hires an assassin Bullseye to take care of them both. The story for Daredevil is probably one of the most well-developed comic-book adaptations in quite awhile. It was a wonderful idea to start the film off in the middle of the story then back track to see what events led up to the opening sequence then finish the film off from that moment. It is so rarely done so well in most films today that it was a great delight. The only problem that can be seen with the plot is that some moments can only truly be understood if one was a fan of the comic-book series but those moments are few and aren't of huge importance to the overall effect of the film.
The cast for Daredevil is very well put together and most, if not all, seem to work exceedingly well portraying their character within the course of the film. Ben Affleck, who has starred in such action flicks as Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, and The Sum of All Fears, is definitely becoming a rising star in Hollywood especially as he seems to be taking more serious roles such as this film. Affleck portrays the character very well and seems to have fun with role as well. Jennifer Garner, who appeared in Catch Me If You Can in December 2002, does a much better job at showing her acting ability on the big screen then the previously mentioned role. Some would prefer that there be more character development with Elektra but outside of that, there really isn't much to complain about. Colin Farrell, who is making appearances in a lot of films throughout 2003, is absolutely amazing as the villain, Bullseye. He does a wonderful job at creating a character that will freak out the audience, which is what his character is supposed to do. Farrell creates a wonderful character that is humorous and frightening at the same time. Despite some criticism, Michael Clark Duncan is great as the Kingpin. It can be said that there could have been someone else better for the role but Duncan, who is usually know for his dramatic roles in such films as The Green Mile, does a delightful job despite that.
Overall, Daredevil continues the trend of delightful film adaptations of comic-book superheroes and rises above all its predecessors. The story was fabulously well done and ends in a way that leaves the audience guessing at what happens. The ending should build much anticipation for a Daredevil sequel if there is to be one. With the good there is also the bad. The slow motion techniques used in the fight sequences of the film got annoying after awhile and seemed pretty pointless and unnecessary within points of the film. Another problem with the film was the time length. The feature felt too short and more could have been explained with the course of the film but better to leave some things unanswered for the sequel. In the end, though, those small problems with Daredevil seem trivial. Daredevil is delightful treat and goes beyond the expectancy of most films released during this slow period at the box office.",1072569600,,4990,4.633182844243792
2277199,1,B0009B0GYA,"In the pantheon of American superheroes, Daredevil (alias Matt Murdock) resides somewhere between Captain Planet and Danger Mouse (translation: total loser). He possesses enhanced senses and extraordinary strength and balance, but he generally uses his powers to battle a barrage of cranks and mobsters who could easily be dealt with by local police forces. He claims to represent justice and honor, but he has no qualms about recklessly slaughtering anyone who rubs him the wrong way. He is forced to endure blindness, mass ridicule and the deaths of loved ones, but he never manages to exude the vulnerability that make heroes like Spiderman and Batman such enduring icons. And unlike Spidey and Bats, he has been granted a film so joyless, tasteless and unappealing that only a fringe group of comic book fanatics and action junkies will find themselves exiting the theater with feelings other than disgust and dismay.

After a maudlin prologue establishes the title character's unique situation (the usual equation of radioactive material + murdered relative = pissed off superhero), we are introduced to a lawless city where only the vigilante Daredevil (Ben Affleck) stands between order and chaos. Chaos is pitifully represented by Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin, who commits his evil deeds and enjoys his stylish designer clothing in cheerful ignorance of his lack of personality and motivation. When he requires assistance he calls in Colin Farrell's Bullseye, a marginally more interesting fellow who gets his kicks by stabbing people in neck with items you can buy at Staples. As our hero confronts these diabolical forces and engages in a mind-numbing romance with the feisty Elektra Nachios (a beautiful but boring Jennifer Garner), director/writer Mark Stephen Johnson combines a penchant for unimaginative special effects with a love of gratuitous, sickening violence. Innocent people and minor scumbags are stabbed with walking sticks, thrown in front of trains, beaten within an inch of life and even choked with peanuts, often without regard for the plot or the sensitive stomachs of the audience. The carnage is so intense that it diminishes any joy in seeing good triumph over evil and mires the film in gloom and hopelessness.

At the center of this travesty is Affleck, an actor whose incredible popularity still remains a mystery to me. In film after film, he comes across as a smarmy, mumbling dolt who can barely keep his eyes open long enough to grasp the plot at hand. As Daredevil, he lacks the basic charisma, passion and intensity that the character requires to succeed, and is ultimately as dynamic as the cardboard cutout of himself that advertised the film.",1072137600,,2691,5.1981566820276495
2277200,5,B0009B0GYA,"You've probably seen many super-hero movies, and now you're thinking: ""Should I see one more?"" In my personly opinion: sure. Daredevil is a super-hero like Batman, Superman and so on, but just one thing separates him from them and makes him so human. And that is the fact that he's blind. The same bio-hazard which blinded him make his other sences super-human. By day he's a lawyer Matt Murdock who seeks justice in courtrooms of New York. When night falls on the city he becomes vigilante who do the same job, but this time on the streets. And for guilty people he has no mercy. Atleast until he mets Elektra, beautiful and misterious woman who shakes his world from top to bottom.

2277214,1,B0009B0GYA,"I think I should address the few good things about this movie:

GOOD THING #1: Numero uno would be David Keith's portrayal of Jack Murdock, Matt's boxer father. No longer sporting the lanky build we saw in An Officer and a Gentleman, in the intervening 20 years it looks like Keith has put on 100 pounds, most of it muscle. He was just perfect as the big, beefy Irish brawler.

GOOD THING #2: The scene where Matt uses his radar sense to ""see"" Elektra's face in the rain was just beautiful, so well and sensitively done it seemed to have wandered in from another movie.

A MAJOR MISSED OPPORTUNITY: In the transition from comic to movie, Matt's origin was changed from heroically pushing a blind man out of the path of a speeding truck, from which fell a radioactive isotope, striking him across the eyes, blinding him and granting him super-senses. (Appreciate the irony: saving a blind man turns this heroic boy into a blind man himself.) In the movie there's no heroism involved, he simply runs into a spray of toxic waste.

Later in the movie the newly ""blinded"" Matt stops a man from stepping out into the path of a speeding car. He raises his cane across the man's path because obviously he ""saw"" the car coming when the sighted man did not - and because, in this movie, Matt cares not a whit, apparently, then or later, for hiding the fact he's not an ordinary blind man. In fact, he flaunts the fact. The man he stops from being run over is played by Stan Lee, Daredevil's creator back in 1964.

So we have a grossly altered origin leeching from it any hint of heroism, and a throwaway moment with Daredevil's creator that underlines how lightly Matt takes the ""secret"" of his powers. What if, instead, they'd taken the best of those two ideas, the origin of DD's powers and Stan Lee's cameo role? We have the scene where Matt's racing to save a blind man from an onrushing truck....AND THE BLIND MAN WAS STAN LEE. Creation saves creator, in the live action version of the origin scene Lee wrote 39 years before. That's just....perfect.

What might have been.",1070323200,,2067,4.543010752688172

This is a fine superhero action movie. Period. The opening ""origin"" vignette actually is one of the best of its' type put to film. From casting to cinematography to editing...it's a beaut.
Yes, Ben Affleck is a bit smug, but as a serious longtime comic geek, my big beef was that his hair wasn't red. That's it. That's all. No big deal.
Jennifer Garner, as Elektra, is luminous. Perfect casting. They shoot her in a manner that elevates her from ""very pretty"" to ""absolutely stunning"". Her intro works perfectly within the plot, and Murdock's ""superpowers"" are creatively and often poetically demonstrated.
Colin Farrell joins the list of simply awesome movie villains. With a few quick scenes, you know all you need to know about Bullseye. His psycho-manic performance electrifies the screen.
The story neatly encapsulates a chunk of the Elektra saga from the Frank Miller era in the comics. The winks toward the comic book audience were greatly appreciated. There are hundreds of not-so-subtle nods to the significant creators of Daredevil...Stan Lee's cameo, DD's dad fighting John Romita, name-dropping ""Miller, Mack and Bendis"" as fighters, ""Joe Quesada"" as a bad guy, Kevin Smith showing up as a guy named ""Kirby"".
But I particularly loved the angles and shots that recall specific classic images from those old books, especially the ending of the fight between Bullseye and Elektra (Frank Miller covers come to life), and the swirling cable around a plummeting Daredevil, evoking the cover of the most recent relaunch of the series.
It's a ""dark"" movie, emotionally and cinematographically. The former didn't bother me, but the latter sometimes had me squinting trying to discern details.

2277221,3,B0009B0GYA,"Before I go into any kind of criticism I wanted to make it a point to point out the good in Daredevil, because there's really a lot there to enjoy.
I LOVED ... I mean ... LOVED the origin story in the beginning.  It was PERFECT absolutely perfect.  I can't say it enough, although a character or two was missing, they perfectly captured the spirit of what made Daredevil such an appealing character.
The casting was pretty good, Ben Affleck (I though) was a terrific Matt Murdock/Daredevil.  I felt that although Jennifer Garner looked amazing as Electra, her performance came across a little rigid, as if she couldn't relax into the role.  Colin Ferrell was hysterical as Bullseye.  Ferrell was clearly having the time of his life making the movie.  Michael Clarke Duncan was OK as Kingpin...
The stunts and 'shadow-vision' and effects, I enjoyed them all.  I also LOVED all of the little nods to the comic book readers such as Frank Miller and Kevin Smith's cameo, seeing long-time artist John Romita's name as Jack Murdock's opponent.
I loved the coy interaction between Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson or Matt Murdock and Electra.  I ate it all up, I just couldn't get enough.
But of all the things they could have possibly slipped on, how did they actually slip on the character of Daredevil?  They turned him into Batman for God's sake!  Daredevil isn't a dark brooding anti-hero.  He's the guy you see leaping off of a twenty-story building without a net with a big grin on his face.  He's Spiderman without the Spider.
I was actually heartbroken that they had built up this insane amount of positive momentum and then lost it all when they turned Daredevil into a cold-blooded killer.  I know they incorporated it into the storyline of Daredevil ""finding himself"" but it was just so far out of his character it bordered on being unforgivable for me.  Try as I might I really had a hard time getting past it; especially in light of how much they got right.

2277225,1,B0009B0GYA,"When I popped in the Daredevil DVD, I had no idea what I was in for, and now I know why they say Ignorance is Bliss.
  Apparently the casting agent knew this screenplay would need all the star power it could get its hands on to give it even midget legs.  And they were right, Ben Aflek, and Colin Farrel are just some of the people in this movie that I hope were paid really well for what they had to go through on camera.  The movie starts out with a kid and his boxer dad living happily together, but one day, the kid gets toxic stuff in his eyes.  He wakes up blind, BUT sounds he hears produce images in his head.  Later in the movie, the kids dad is paid to throw a fight by ""The kingpin"" wich he fails to do.  The dad is then beaten, and killed, so now ""Daredevil"" has sworn to avenge his father by killing everyone who commits a crime.
Colin Farrel on the other hand, plays and even MORE stupid charactor.  A man who is deadly with anything he can throw, ""Bullseye"".  There is a scene where bullseye actually chokes a 90 year old woman by bouncing a peanut off the back of an airplane chair, into her throat and choking her.  Now, I like alot of violent movies, but is it just me, or is that unnecesarily sick?
In conclusion, a blind superhero who uses sonar to fight people, In my opinion, is just kind of a bad idea.  On top of that, the writing tries real hard to be witty, but really just doesnt cut it.  And the bad guys, are just lame.  So, I give it 1 star.  Now, there are people I know who did like it, so maybe I'm being to harsh, but I'm telling you just from my own expierience, the movie, which I watched with another friend, gave us alot of unintentional laughs, and we found ourself cought in alot of ""What the heck?"" and ""Oh come on!"" moments.  I personally, would not recommend it to anyone older than 13, or anyone who isn't a big fan of comics.",1066348800,,1870,4.0989010989010985
2277226,2,B0009B0GYA,"Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan owned this movie. Ben Affleck doesn't convince me as a hero for a moment, and Jennifer Garner -- a martial arts assassin? What, was Britney Spears unavailable? Please. She looks about as legitimate as a killer as she does a spy in Alias. Which is to say, not a all. She got this job (and her Alias job) with her _____. Period, end of story. Fight scenes are OK, other than that though, this blows.",1066348800,,437,4.407407407407407
2277227,4,B0009B0GYA,"There is no hero quite like Daredevil. I will not say that he is the best super-hero that is out there today but I will say he is one of the most real.
Daredevil has always been different than the other heroes in comic books because his disability is what GIVES him his power. He is proof that anything is possible and that anyone can overcome anything if they really have to.
Daredevil is worth your time if you like super-heroes that are more human and full of flaws. Ben Affleck does a excellent job as Daredevil and he prooves that he has what it takes to portray a hero in the Marvel Universe. Mark Steven Johnson does an awesome job as the director and the writers are great at re-creating some of the best issues of Daredevil. Daredevil is slightly different from the comics but you feel like you are re-reading the best of Frank Miller's run on the comic once you view the film.
Daredevil is not perfect (I can see why some of the comic fans would hate the adaptation) and it has some parts that are really lame but it is a good film if you really like the red hero that we all love. I would be bold enough to say that it is the best solo super-hero movie since ""Batman.""
The Daredevil film may not please all of the Daredevil comic fans but the DVD is set up in such a way that the Daredevil comic fans will find the extras well worth the price. The DVD has really awesome interview's with all of Daredevil's best writers and artists. You really learn more about Daredevil as you hear what the creators have to say about the comic and the film.
This DVD is great for fans and non-fans. It is a really cool film that is well worth the price.",1066262400,,1649,4.2215189873417724
2277228,3,B0009B0GYA,"this was better than Spider-man last year. Ben Affleck is really grat as Daredevil and Jennifer Garner is sexy in leather ad Elektra. Michael Clarke Duncan is huge as Kingpin and of course theres Mr. Colin Farrell whos brilliant as Bullseye, he steals the whole movie. there are cameos in here by Stan Lee and Kevin Smith too and David Keith adds spark as the little devils dad who gets killed in the beginning. great action scenes but some are corny as hell, like that fight between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner when its daylight out and by the kids playground.",1066089600,,565,4.603960396039604
2277229,5,B0009B0GYA,"15 years ago I used to read every MARVEL/DC comic book I could buy,and one my favorites was the DAREDEVIL.I have watched this movie 3 times - and the more I watch the better I think it is . Daredevil has incredible stunts and fine CG effects. The fights are cool and the characters are very interesting. Some people say FRANK MILLER should have written the script / directed it ,but they keep forgetting that ROBOCOP 2 & 3 stories were penned by him. I like these ROBOCOP films whereas  critics and most movie watchers hate them. So,I'd say DAREDEVIL is a nice film because Miller's & MARVEL's vision is there - the essence was preserved. Ben Affleck did a great job and deserves to come back,as well as C. Farrell, Duncan ,J. Garner and the original cast and crew. Perhaps a story which tells of Elektra's mysterious life and her training in the East,her involvement with a criminal organization ( If I am not wrong it is called the Tentacle ) ,master/sensei Stick,Kirigi ( the zombie/living dead ninja ),the Beast (from the GRAPHIC NOVEL) , and even the participation of  criminals like Mary Typhoid,Stilts,...could certainly make a good story. The double DVD is filled with documentaries,screen tests,featurettes,3 videoclips,enhanced viewing mode,interviews with the best MARVEL writers,pencilers ,etc... - one of the best DVD sets  ever launched. If you like superheroes,sci-fi,action ,adventure ,then this is the movie for you. I am looking forward to part 2.",1066003200,,1465,4.9714285714285715
2277230,3,B0009B0GYA,"When I saw the movie I just couldn't get too excited over it. I didn't mind the plotline of 12 yr. old Matt Murdock being blinded by a splash of Industrial waste and soon after developing sonic vision, I just couldn't get into the story.
Ben Affleck was all right as adult Matt but I think I liked the young actor who did Matt Murdock at 12 better. Jennifer Garner was good as Elektra but you can see her doing much the same every week on TV in Alias,for what she probably cost they should've given her more screen time. Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin was pretty good although I think he gave up too easily in the climactic battle with Daredevil.
The best fight scene in the movie, if you could call it that, was when Elektra and Matt Murdock had a sparring match on some teeter-totters in a playground.
The extra's are what I'd most likely buy this one for.",1066003200,,860,4.314814814814815
2277241,3,B0009B0GYA,"I hate to say it, but I didn't really realize how good Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Spiderman was - until I saw the movie Daredevil!
In Daredevil, Ben Affleck's character is blind.
He has but one extraordinary power - his supernatural hearing - which makes up for his lack of sight.
He traverses around New York - and fights -- using a blind man's cane which converts into either a bungee-corded grappling hook, or a bladeless sword and nunchucks.
He gains purpose by killing street thugs - which is a punishment far in excess to the crimes they commit.
And he gets his lady friend to fall in love with him, unbelievably - by brawling with her on the playground!
On all levels, Spiderman is so much better!
Tobey Maguire - as a nerd - creates sentimentality in a much more engaging way.  His use of a web to trapeze around Gotham - and to entrap his opponents - is simultaneously much more graceful and humane.  His ""spidey sense"" and superhuman strength are infinitely more believable as comic hero tools.  And he wins his love's heart the old fashioned way - by saving her life.  Which, unfortunately, even the Daredevil fails to do!
Colin Farrell as Bullseye (Daredevil's nemesis) only adds to the movie's callousness.  He murders with pencils and paperclips, as though using innocuous devices somehow makes it ok.
And even Jennifer Garner, as Elektra Natchios, is unable to save the day.  Sure, she's gorgeous, and the sonic image of her created in the rain is easily the coolest special effect in the entire film.  But it didn't thrill me to see her stab the man she loves; or to take it herself in the gut!  And you really know something's wrong when the sexiest picture you can remember of her comes -- not from the movie itself - but from the leather-wrapped, rear view photo of her which appears on the DVD's box!
According to other reviews I've read, the original Daredevil was only a second-rate comic book superhero - and this movie really shows off why!
This is a great film for fans of the genre.  But for the rest of us, Spiderman is an infinitely better ride!  Enjoy.",1066003200,,2083,4.575268817204301
2277242,2,B0009B0GYA,"Weak acting, bad casting and poor storyline are the three nails in this film's coffin.  Affleck doesn't bring anything to his role and did Jennifer Garner just phone her performance in?  Was she heavily medicated?  Or does the woman just have no personality to speak of?  I don't know and this movie didn't make me care, either.
Sadly, the most entertaining feature of this film is actually Colin Farrel as Bullseye.  This is sad because the character as presented in the film is utterly preposterous and non-sensical (even for a comic book movie) and Farrel hams it up above and beyond the call of duty.  I guess that's a good thing since Affleck and Garner both provide the most uninteresting superheroes ever put to film.  Even the action in the movie was weak, which is what you get for putting Affleck in a big action role, I guess.  The fight choreography was dull and less inspired than what you're apt to see in a Saturday morning cartoon.  Bad, bad filmmaking.
I'm sure this joke has already been made, but this movie left me wishing I was blind too, so I wouldn't have had to watch it.",1065657600,,1095,4.545918367346939
2277243,4,B0009B0GYA,"This is a very dark superhero movie.  Ben Affleck plays Matt Murdock, a pro bono lawyer by day and an avenging superhero by night.  Murdock was blinded in his childhood.  After suffering that tragedy, he discovered that his remaining senses had become much stronger.  His sense of hearing became so powerful that he could see with a kind of radar sense.  As a child his father was killed by gangsters.  He vows revenge, so that is why he has become a superhero.  He wants to find his father's killer.
In this movie Murdock runs into the beautiful but dangerous Elecktra.  After an initial battle, they become fast friends.  The trouble starts when Elecktra's father wants to back out of a deal with the Kingpin.  The Kingpin hires an assasin, Bullseye, to get rid of Elecktra and her father. Can Daredevil save them?  Watch and see.
At first, I was a little worried about the casting of this movie, but after seeing it, I have to say everyone turned in a solid performance.  I particularly liked Colin Farrell's performance as Bullseye.  Also there are some spectacular fight scenes in this movie.  In particular, there is a super fight scene in a bar that is a must see.  The reason that I gave this four stars is that sometimes the CG is a little too much.  For example, in the opening credits, they use a CG rat, as if it was difficult to get a rat.  However the CG isn't as bad as in the recent Hulk movie.",1065484800,,1410,4.4453125
2277244,1,B0009B0GYA,"First of all, this is not my type of movie at all, but Colin Farrell was in it and my Husband was interseted so I decided to give it a try. UGH. This movie was sooo bad. The acting(if you can call it that), the plot....(was there one?)....the whole thing was so cheesy I cringed with discomfort while watching...I eventually fell asleep towards the end ..I honestly feel that being passed out on my couch was better time spent than witnessing the conclusion to this mindless mess of a movie. All I can say is that this just further reinforces my belief that if you want a GOOD story, skip the movies and read a book instead.",1065139200,,624,4.3418803418803416
2277245,1,B0009B0GYA,"I'm not really familiar with comic book superheroes. The only superheroes I can think of I've read about in comic books are SpaceMan Spiff and Stupendous Man from ""Calvin and Hobbes."" I never got into Marvel Comics and that whole genre...I only read the funnies. With that in mind, I'm going to try to review the new movie ""Dare Devil."" Bear in mind that I know practically nothing about the whole ""Dare Devil"" comic strip, and I don't know the background or anything like that. I went into the movie as a practically blank slate (except for my predisposition to not liking Ben Affleck).
The movie started out sort of interesting, with the opening credits starting out as Braille. I could easily see the irony of watching Braille on the screen as the opening for a movie about a blind man. The movie went downhill from there.
I flat out didn't really like this movie. Yes, there were a few funny one-liners that I found amusing but possibly offensive to blind people...but basically everything else about the movie I didn't like. I'll just list the things I didn't like first, and then list the thing(s) I did like so we'll end on a positive note.
The dialogue (which reminded me of Spiderman), was horribly cheesy. The acting matched the dialogue (though there were a few good performances mixed in the bunch). I'd have to say that Affleck actually did a half decent job with the character he was given, despite the skin-tight leather outfit he wore.
In action movies like this, generally the action is the redeeming part of the movie...the part that makes up for the poor dialogue and plot (I can't complain about the plot...it was based on the comic books...). Unfortunately, in this movie the action seemed to be direct copies of Spiderman...just a different outfit and Dare Devil had to do the same stunts without web...instead he used a cable that he could shoot out and retrieve at will. Basically the action was just your basic fluid CG action that defied gravity...and my attention span. The worst part of the fight scenes was the weird pseudo crucifixion scene in which ""Bullseye"" (played by Colin Ferrel...the same guy that plays the Detective in Minority Report), gets shot through both hands and stretches out his arm while in a large cathedral. Yeah, it was a little weird.
Walking back from the movie, the guy accompanying me (we'll call him ""Dan"" to allow anonymity) made several remarks on the simplicity of the soundtrack and how it really had no depth. I'm not the music diehard he is, but I agree that the music never really seemed to fit the scene...but the lyrics that I heard seemed to sort of fit (A few lines I caught included ""Open your eyes"" and ""Can't you see"" etc). I'd probably have to watch it again and pay more attention to that portion to give any real clues on what that was about (but I'd rather not see it again...).
I don't really want to give away the plot...but it does mostly fit into the plot of most superhero movies (good guys vs. bad...), and fits even closer into the plot of Spiderman (I guess Stan Lee wasn't as creative as we thought). Anyhow, I don't really want to complain about the movie anymore, so I'll mention the good point(s).
The good points: Ummmm...I thought it was really amusing that Joe Pantoliano played the reporter in the movie. I sort of enjoyed his character (he's Cipher from ""The Matrix""). Also...KingPin was sort of interesting...I would never, ever, EVER fight that guy. Man, he was HUGE. I'm not sure whether that's a good point or not, but I had to make it. Oh...and the whiz bang special effects were neat-o. Basically, I walked out of the theater thinking that I had just enjoyed the movie. Then I realized I paid money to see it and I realized I really didn't enjoy it that much.",1064707200,,3757,4.617339312406577

2277247,1,B0009B0GYA,"I thought Affleck was great in ""Phantoms"".  He's horrible in this role. He wasn't a very convincing blind person.
It actually started of pretty good but went downhill quickly.
When the Jennifer Gardner character was introduced it went from dumb to dumber. She is a lame actress. I guess she fit the suit.
Don't let Hollywood fool you by putting a couple of big names in the movie and trying to pass it of as a legitimate effort.
The movie is horrible. I couldn't finish it.
I left 3/4 of the way through it to mow the yard, in the dark.",1064534400,,536,4.306930693069307

2277260,4,B0009B0GYA,"There are several reasons why this movie is such fun. Unfortunately, none of them is named Affleck. Everytime I hear him listed as an Academy Award winner, I wish they had to say that it wasn't for his acting abilities.
Jennifer Garner as Electra is perfect. Colin Farrell as Bullseye is right on target (sorry, couldn't resist). The effects work is first rate.
This is the epitome of a popcorn movie. Just sit back, relax and enjoy it for what it is. As a translation of a comic to screen, it stands up fairly well. Unfortunately, the only thing that didn't translate from that two-dimensional world was Ben Affleck. The rest of the movie is exceptional.",1063670400,,655,4.655172413793103
2277261,4,B0009B0GYA,"The critical and public reaction to Daredevil has been predictable:  this is yet another case of a movie that primarily has been panned by people who don't care for its genre, and praised by people who do.
I found the movie itself to be very watchable.  Other than the ""park battle sequence"" between Elektra and Murdock, which was just too over-the-top, the film is old-school super-heroics presented with such confidence and visual flair that anyone who enjoys comic-book superheroes should get a kick out of it.  Affleck's performance as Matt Murdock is especially good (easily as believable as Toby Maquire's much-ballyhooed turn as Peter Parker in Spider-Man).  As recent superhero movies go (IMHO), this is one of the best, much more entertaining than Hulk, just as engaging as Spider-Man, albeit not quite up to the standards of the two X-Men films.
The extras are rather more of a mixed bag.  I cared little for the features dealing with the movie, but the longish ""Men Without Fear"" feature, a series of interviews with the writers and artists of the Daredevil comic book, is wonderful.  Stan Lee is as likable as ever, and I found Frank Miller surprisingly chatty and funny.",1063670400,,1183,4.919597989949748
2277262,5,B0009B0GYA,"The above words were spoken by Ben Affleck in this, one of his newest releases-Daredevil.
Daredevil is yet another superhero film that is sure to win the approval of it's viewers. Unlike most superhero films, this movie is about a boy who learns how to deal with the world around him after tragicly losing his sight due to an explosion of dangerous chemicals. Why is it any different than other superhero films? Because he didn't feel sorry for himself, but decided to help those who were in need.
As for this version(widescreen edition) I would reccomend it because as you know, widescreen allows you to see more of the movie than fullscreen does and this is a movie you definatly want to see all you can.",1063670400,,706,4.611111111111111

This film, however, is a total mess and unbelievably boring.  In a nutshell:  Awful, painfully dark cinematography, absolutely atrocious acting by the two leads, and a startlingly inept ""screenplay.""
It's just too depressing.  Hollywood:  stop already, you're killing me.

Ben Affleck give a better-than-expected performance as Murdock/Daredevil, and Jennifer Garner does a solid job as well.  There are a few plot holes, but the movie is worthwhile.
On the technical aspect, DVD's don't get much better than this.  The picture quality is perfect and the Dolby Digital 5.1 track is outstanding.  Definitely a good one to show off.

The basic concept is that when he was young, his eyes were damaged, but by a radioactive material, and he was blinded.  However, in its place his hearing is greatly improved, and he is still able to ""see.""

2277273,5,B0009B0GYA,"This Film was greatly underrated due to the fact that it came out in when there was a plethora of sci-fi and comic book movies to choose from. Did anyone really expect it to get much attention when X-2, Tomb Raider 2, The Hulk, etc. were coming out?
That being said, I was very surprised by this film. I myself never saw it until it came out for rent.
In my opinion, it is one of the best comic book films made. Granted, Ben Affleck really shouldn't dye his hair red, and the branded Bullseye was a touch hokey, but the rest was pure comic book gold.
The movie gets points for showing a superhero with scars and missing teeth. I was personally amazed that Ben Affleck could actually portray Daredevil as a real character instead of just a guy running around in tights.
The hero has flaws, the villians have flaws, the supporting cast has flaws. It makes the film more realistic to show that this guy is going to confession or that he thinks he can't handle a rich girlfriend.
Be honest, most guys would freak if they found out their new girl had bucks in the bank. Why is it so hard to think that a superhero would?
Props for the special effects in this film. The costuming was actually well done. It did not look hokey like it so easily could have.
While I personally don't care for the style of music of the soundtrack for simple listening pleasure, it fits incredibly well with the slightly darker tone of the flick.
The extras on the DVD are actually good. The free game was a nice touch, and the hearing impared description track is a great addition givent he subject of the film.",1062288000,,1585,4.358108108108108
2277274,3,B0009B0GYA,"Eye-popping visual effects, a great score...and...Jennifer Garner zipping around the screen in tight clothes...that sums up the high points of Daredevil. While not as coma inducing as Spiderman (a film that I felt was way overhyped and unjustly overpraised) Daredevil falls woefully behind other Marvel films. While Ben Affleck is adequate as the masked superhero, he seems very uncomfortable in the role. I can't exactly say why, but it just appears that he is not ""having fun"" kicking [booty] and taking names. Colin Farrell is absolutely hilarious as Bullseye, actually stealing most of the scenes he is in. Jennifer Garner it appears was placed in the film for one reason and one reason only, eye-candy. Michael Clarke Duncan spends most of the movie handing out roses and ordering people to do all the dirty work. In fact, so inconsequential is the supporting cast in this movie that the screenwriters apparently felt that a literate script was not even needed. Visually, Daredevil is top notch. The fight scenes are kinetically charged with flying fists and jittery camera work, and the prog/rock soundtrack fits the mood very well. The ""comic book"" spirit is adequately portrayed, and I guess that is all that matters for this type of film. While not the best of the Marvel pool, Daredevil is still a guilty pleasure film.

2277287,4,B0009B0GYA,"A Film by Mark Steven Johnson
Daredevil is based on the Marvel comic book character.  Matt Murdoch (Ben Affleck) is a blind lawyer by day, but by night he is Daredevil, a vigilante crime fighter.  The movie opens and traces the origins of who Matt is and how he became blind, and later how he became Daredevil.  While this is not the main thrust of the story, it is essential storytelling to show us who this blind guy who runs around in a costume fighting bad guys is and how he got that way.  When he was a child, Matt was blinded by some toxic chemicals (aren't they all).  It took away his sight, but his other senses were heightened so much that Matt developed a sort of radar (sound waves reflecting off objects gives him a sense of where they are, much like bats).  When his father was murdered, Matt dedicated his life to helping those who could not protect themselves.  In the real world, this led to him becoming a lawyer and fighting for justice, but when the law does not work, he becomes justice himself and fights as Daredevil.
It is after this exposition that we get a chance to see what the story of the movie is going to be.  We meet Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) in a caf and Matt is interested enough that he tries to follow her.  Elektra doesn't want to be followed and they get into a little fight that is pretty much their courtship scene.  It is very well done and it gives us clues on how they get interested in each other.  While Elektra and Matt are getting more and more acquainted and friendly, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) has put out a hit on the life of Elektra's father (Erick Avari).  Kingpin sends out Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to kill her father and in the process Bulleye ends up implicating Daredevil.  Elektra doesn't know who Daredevil is yet, and now Daredevil wants to take down Kingpin.  This is the major conflict of the movie.
Bullseye steals pretty much every scene he is in, but I don't feel that there is any exceptionally weak part of the movie.  Daredevil (the movie) isn't great, but it is a solid comic book movie and despite the backlash against Ben Affleck he actually does a credible job both as Matt Murdock and Daredevil.  Solid casting all the way through the movie. As a film, it was a little bit better than Spider-man.  It isn't as good as X-Men,  but this movie has been unfairly bashed.  Like I said, it isn't great, but it is a decent little movie.",1061942400,,2422,4.414414414414415
2277288,5,B0009B0GYA,"Admittedly not as good as X2, but could you really expect that from a film that is based on one character alone?  It does an excellent job of taking the Frank Miller storyline and streamlining it with a modern twist to give it flair.  Jennifer Garner, Michael Clarke Dunkan, and Colin Ferrel all shine as their characters, which sort of makes me wish the movie was about Elektra instead of the somewhat miscast Ben Affleck.  Of course, it did take Ben's interest to get the ball rolling on the movie, so one should be mindful of that favor.
The rock music track, slammed by so many, is actually poetic and upon reviewing or after acquiring a deeper knowledge of the DD universe is an amazingly well-done substitute for the back stories which would be expensive and probably boring to the average viewer.  The special features are also great.  I hope to see more discs like this!",1061769600,,878,4.602564102564102
2277289,4,B0009B0GYA,"Teenager Matt Murdock is blinded in a freak accident.  After the accident, Matt loses his sight, but his other senses become super-humanly enhanced.  His father, played perfectly by David Keith, is an over-the-hill prize fighter with ties to the local mob.  With his career back on track, Matt's father is ordered by the local crime boss to take a dive, but he refuses and goes on to win his fight - much to the crime boss's chagrin.
Matt pushes himself physically and mentally in honor of his father, and becomes a top attorney during the day, while taking advantage of his heightened senses to become the mysterious vigilante Daredevil during the darkness of night.  Everything seems pretty normal (if you call leading THAT kind of double life normal!) until...
Matt meets and falls in love with Elektra Natchios (unconvincingly played by Jennifer Garner - although she sure looked tasty!), the daughter of a billionaire businessman.  Elektra's father is murdered, which leads Matt and Elektra down a collision course with the city's Kingpin of Crime (Michael Clarke Duncan - man, was he convincing!) and his hired hitman, Bullseye (Colin Farell).
Once Matt meets Elektra, things move very quickly.  Unfortunately, the film-makers had to develop the relationship between Matt and Elektra quickly, too.  Unlike another dark ""super hero"" movie, The Crow, in which the writers and directors made the love Eric Draven had for his fiancee almost palatable, one never truly gains an understanding for how deeply Matt and Elektra are in love.  The chemistry between Affleck and Garner just really isn't there, and the fact that the two of them are mediocre performers certainly didn't help matters much.  This is too bad, because this story is about the love between Elektra and Matt as well as Daredevil vs. Bullseye and the Kingpin.
The movie's soundtrack rocks, and I was pleased to find that the DVD came with DTS sound in addition to the Dolby 5.1.  Jon Favreau was a good Foggy Nelson, Joe Pantoliano was fine as Ben Urich, and Colin Farell made an interesting, albeit somewhat different from the comic book, Bullseye.  Affleck did an OK job as Daredevil, and Garner, as mentioned previously, really is not a very talented performer. I'll give Affleck credit for not messing up Matt Murdock or Daredevil.  I think the fact that he is a huge Daredevil fan helped out tremendously.  His performance had a little more juice and depth than some of his previous stuff - like the over-rated Pearl Harbor fluff.
The best performance, hands down, was Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin.  Yes, yes...  I know that the comic book Kingpin was a literally larger than life white guy - a muscular version of Toughman Competition fighter Eric ""Butterbean"" Esch.  But when you finish watching the movie, challenge yourself to find an actor who could have done a better job than Mr. Duncan.  I tried to think of others that could have done the job, but I kept coming up empty.  The people doing the casting nailed this one perfectly.
Marvel Comics has scored big with X-Men, Spider-man, X-Men 2, and Daredevil.  Of the three that I have seen (I've missed X-Men 2), Daredevil fits in between Spider-man (that movie was GRRREAT!) and X-Men (Cool, but again, not enough time to develop characters).  If you are unfamiliar with the comic book, this DVD is worth renting.  If you are a fan of the comic book, do not hesitate to purchase the DVD.",1061769600,,3427,4.864027538726334

Colin Ferrel did a decent job as Bullseye. But Affleck and Garner... not even worth wasting words on. I really wish I could give this steaming, stink pile of dung a negative rating. It's one of those rare films that truly deserves on. I can honestly say I felt like turning it off during the first 20 minutes. The only movie I ever felt like turning off or walking out on besides this was Battlefield Earth. Now these two films aren't completely worthless. They do raise thought-provoking ethical questions. Is it ok to want a refund at the dollar movie? Is is ok to claim the DVD is defective just to exchange it for a new one and take the new one to another store and claim it was a gift and get your money back? In the cases of Daredevil and Battlefield Earth, the answer is a simple ""duh."" It's sad to see that actors with talent such as Colin Ferrel, Joe Pantoliano and Michael Clark Duncan stoop to the level of Daredevil.

The problem? I think ""Daredevil"" is not a character that can become popular such as its counterpart ""Spiderman"" and some people aren't moved by the ""darker"" side of a superhero but still this is what makes DD an interesting hero.
The extras are quite good, specially if you get the 2 DVD Special Edition. The only thing missing is that they should throw a couple of deleted scenes into the mix. There was a scene on the trailer with Coolio and they should put that on the DVD. The audio commentary of the director with one of the producers is so-so, somewhat funny actually, it's the first time I heard a director somehow bashing his own movie...""here comes the crappy CGI..."" you can't get more honesty than that.
The movie itself rocks...if you love action movies this one will be entertaining...Where else can you get actors like Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan in the same movie!!! And Farrell is superb as the cold blooded assasin ""Bullseye"". Duncan nails the part as the Kingpin very good (specially since the Kingpin is white, but Duncan gets the ""spirit"" of the character). Joe Pantoliano and Jon Favreau are also in it and they give an excellent performance. It's strange that Garner wasn't even the 1st choice for the role (that was Bridget Moynahan from ""The Sum of All Fears"") but Garner nails the part perfectly as ""Elektra"" and she deserves her own movie (some say it's in development). Affleck is not perfect in the main role but still manages to get the job done.

The movie is dark and reminiscent of the original Batman movie.  Affleck is believeable as Matt Murdoch, a lawyer who as a young boy is blinded by a toxic chemical spill.  The character turns to a vegilanti after seeing his father killed by hired thugs.  The movie is slow to start, has not predictable wire fight sequences, and lacks a concrete story line.  Or more importantly tries to tie too many loose ends up in one story.  Murdoch discovers the man that kills his father is the same man that is running the cities organized crime ring and hires the hit on his love Electra.  Again reminiscent of Batman.

Going into the theater, I felt slighly excited, I have been a long time fan of the Frank Miller version of Daredevil, and I had heard that director had brought Miller in to help with the film's visuals. So I settled in, and watched. The movie starts fast, and quickly moves through daredevil's origin, which I enjoyed - then they have a very good scene of the boy daredevil being woken by a booming drip and we see his radar ""vision"" working. Then it went downhill fast.
  Some of my major problems with the film was I just didn't belive daredevil did those crazy moves. He jumps at least 10 feet down, falls another ten feet, and then again.. I expected him to be at least a few inches shorter when he hit the ground. And there is one more thing at the end that bugs me... but I won't give that away.
It does fullfill as an action movie, and you gotta see like 40 million dollars in action flyin across the screen. But don't think too much.",1061251200,,977,4.247311827956989
2277308,5,B0009B0GYA,"I'll be honest, I have nothing against Ben Affleck but when I first heard he was going to don tights and play a super hero I thought it sounded ridiculous. However Mr. GOOD WILL HUNTING would soon prove me wrong.  DAREDEVIL is anything but ridiculous. It's a helluva a good time and Affleck is very good in the role of the red-horned avenger.
Knowing pretty much nothing about DAREDEVIL from the comic books and not caring much for the over hype that was SPIDER-MAN, I didn't have very high expectations when I sat down at the theatre to watch this one. That soon changed. Fifteen minutes in I had already declared this the best super hero film I'd ever seen. This isn't SPIDER-MAN. It's much more real, much darker. Not to mention that it has one of the best villains to grace the screen for the past decade in the form of Bullseye who is brilliantly played by Colin Farrell. Farrell just seems to be having so much fun with the role. You want him to get what he has coming but at the same time he's so much fun to watch.
Anyone who hasn't seen DAREDEVIL should definitely give it a look no matter what their reservations may be. Director Mark Steven Johnson has done an amazing job. I've seen a lot of movies this year (of all types and genre) and DAREDEVIL still stands out as one of the best. I can't wait for the sequel. Excellent!

It never soars, and it stumbles on a few occasions, but at the end it emerges as well worth the time.  My main comlaint would be that the movie is too short; it could have been, and probably should have been, a half hour longer.  That way, there might have been a bit more time for real characterization.  As is, the characters just sort of move from one scene to the next, and we are expected to sort of fill in the blanks for ourselves.  That the characters manage to live and breathe at all is a real testament to some fine acting.  Ben Affleck, whom I expected to suck in this role, is outstanding as the conflicted title hero; Jennifer Garner shows Elektra's soft side as well as her angry, vengeful side; Michael Clarke Duncan is largely wasted as the Kingpin, but is believable as a crime lord; and Colin Farrell is truly psychotic as Bullseye, although I'd like to have some idea of why he is so nuts.  Another complaint I'd like to register is that some of the wirework and CGI is awful.  On the other hand, some of it is very good.
The extras are pretty good.  There are two nearly hour-long documentaries.  My favorite was the one that focuses on the comic-book history and development of Daredevil.  It's a shame that more movies adapted from other media don't pay this much reespect to their source material.

Daredevil is a story about Matt Murdock, an attorney by day and a masked superhero by night. When he was twelve he got into an accident with hazardous chemicals that took away his sight, but in return gave him a maximum level of superhuman strength, which helps him to bring justice to anyone who has been a criminal of injustice.
I was really surprised to see Ben Affleck be a superhero, since he doesn't fit the role of one, but after seeing the movie, he brings the character to life with great dramatic and action persona. Jeniffer Garner is a scene stealer and looking very hot, as the tough and sexy Electra, who is Matt Murdock's love interest. Michael Clarke Dunkan is great as The Kingpin who also fights in the movie, which I didn't expect; and Colin Farrel as Bullseye is perfect, bringing in that Irish toughnest that he has to his great character, which is very cool to see.
Honestly, I haven't heard of a superhero called Daredevil, until the movie arrived. I didn't get a chance to see it in theatres, but I'm sure it would have been amazing, but it was still a treat for me to see it on DVD, with all of the 'daring' extras.
The movie is great in giving us a background on Murdock's life from when he was a young boy to his accident up to his present day life as a blind man in New York City. Everything in this movie is cool especially when we see the Shadow World scenes. It was a great technique that I haven't seen before and it just adds a great visual feast for the eyes.
Another thing to point out is the soundtrack, it was AMAZING, particularly the songs. There are songs in the film that adds a great storytelling techinque between what the characters are really feeling inside without even talking. It will really get your emotions. Very well used.

2277330,3,B0009B0GYA,"The Daredevil of the comics has thrilled readers for decades.  This Daredevil was a pre-politically correct visually challenged crime fighter who did not allow his constant exposure to riffraff affect his inherent moral compass.  The conversion to the movie Daredevil by director Mark Steven Johnson gives a glooomier red-costumed figure who has to deal with a continual need to re-evaluate just why he needs to swing from rooftops to catch criminals.
In DAREDEVIL Ben Affleck is Matt Murdock, lawyer by day, and Daredevil by night.  The first fifteen minutes sets the basic philosophical tone about the need for vengeance.  The 12 year old Matt is bullied by his peers (One of whom is Robert Iler, a teen actor from the Sopranos who in real life was arrested for mugging) and has to run from them.  After he suffers the loss of his sight, his other senses compensate so that when these bullies return, Matt thoroughly thrashes them.  Matt could have simply absorbed their taunts, but as they were walking away, Matt manhandles them, thereby setting in motion an emotional kinetic force that demands blow for blow.  When his father, an unretired boxer who refuses to throw a fight is killed for his lack of co-operation, Matt again is faced with choosing vengeance or allowing the law to handle matters.
  Unsurprisingly, Matt chooses the former. To this unhealthy desire for vengeance, he adds vigilantism.  When a rapist is unjustly found not guilty, Matt as Daredevil chases him down and throws him in front of a train, killing him.  Finally, when his girlfriend Elektra (Jennifer Garner) seeks revenge, first on him for thinking he was the killer of her father then on a hitman Bullseye (maniacally played by Collin Farrell), the entire question of the justness of seeking revenge is muddied by the glee of those who find it and their sorrow afterwards.
Fortunately for the audience, DAREDEVIL is not a visual tract on philosophy or ethics.  It is, instead, a visual feast that presents the viewer with nonstop action sequences that are so over the top that their logical flaws get lost in the shuffle.  Director Johnson would have you believe that the ability to make astounding leaps and impossible dives is not limited to the hero, which in any case is hard enough to swallow.  Both Bullseye and Electra have no problem performing the kind of aerial stunts made popular in HIDDEN DRAGON, CROUCHING TIGER.  It is this trio's ability to fly on command that stands at the core of viewer interest.  This other nonsense about the need for vengeance is window dressing, tossed in only to give a break between action sequences.  On that visual basis alone, DAREDEVIL is worth the price of a rental, but for more substantial filmed analyses of introspection, this will not do.",1060214400,,2775,4.895299145299146

I know this didn't do great at the box office, probably because everyone went in expecting it to be another Spiderman. Somehow people can't seem to go in with an open mind and let it stand on its own merit. If you do you will find this movie well worth owning. The key characters and supporting cast were solid. The music was great and the sets gave a real feel of New York. The choreography was as good as I have seen on any movie including the overly hyped Spiderman. Personally I think Ben Afleck made a better DareDevil than Tobey Maguire made a Spiderman. The real scars of a ""human"" superheroe was a nice touch.

2277332,2,B0009B0GYA,"I originally expected more from the movie ""Daredevil"", but as I watched it I realized that this film was an attempt to cash in on the comic-book-becomes-a-movie craze. I will admit that there are some moments in the film that were pretty good, like the fight sequences between Affleck's and Garner's characters. Other than that, I didn't really find the movie all that interesting.
The ubiquitous Colin Farrell gives an odd performance as Bullseye, a killer who never misses his mark. After a while I became a little annoyed with his character's fidgeting. I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and just tell him to be still! I also was not impressed by Michael Clarke Duncan's performace as Kingpin. Duncan usually always gives a great performance in his other work, but it seemed as though he was merely cast in this film because of his size and the fact that he can be scary just by taking off his jacket. Ben Affleck gave a sympathetic performance as Murdock/Daredevil, but most of the time he seemed mostly wooden.
All in all, I would suggest this film to comic book buffs who like a good dose of action from their favorite stories. All others can skip this one.",1060128000,,1167,4.642512077294686
2277333,3,B0009B0GYA,"When I first saw Daredevil months ago in theaters, I bashed it as much as I could.  The idea of taking such a great comic character and trying to package it for global appeal just really grated my nerves.  However, after watching it for a second time, I have come to grown a bit of a liking for it.  Ben Affleck isn't bad at all as Matt Murdock who is lawyer by day and Daredevil by night.  Jennifer Garner is nicely cast as Elektra, and Colin Farrell nearly steals the entire film as Bullseye.  Director/screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson is a self admitted fan of the Daredevil comic (as is star Affleck) and it shows; the showdown between Elektra and Bullseye is almost directly taken from the classic issue of Daredevil #181, plus Marvel comics trivia knowledge is peppered all throughout the film, plus cameos from Marvel icon Stan Lee, writer Kevin Smith (yes, it's Silent Bob himself who goes by the name Jack Kirby in the film, named after another Daredevil alumnus), and the man who forever re-defined the comic series (and whose run on the series the film is seemingly mostly based from) Frank Miller.  While Daredevil does have it's share of good qualities, the film seems to have an uneven flow sometimes, Michael Clarke Duncan is miscast as the Kingpin (and no, it's not because he's black), the computer generated visual effects seem half heartedly put together, and the way the film ends just opens the door for a sequel and an Elektra spin off.  All that aside however, Daredevil didn't deserve all the bashing I gave it earlier, and longtime fans of the comic will appreciate most of the heart that went into the film, but might not like the complete package.  The DVD itself is nicely put together and the bonus featurettes featuring interviews with Stan Lee, Frank Miller, Brian Michael Bendis, Kevin Smith, and others is a must watch for long time Daredevil fans as well.",1060041600,,1889,4.685800604229607

Watching DAREDEVIL is like watching a montage of BATMAN, THE CROW, and SPIDER-MAN, but just the uninspired scenes. The violent and clever comic book (especially episodes written by visionary FRANK MILLER) has been pillaged to a degree of crime. ELEKTRA is suppose to be thirty-something exotic assassin (think MONICA BELLUCI) not a nineteen year old boy. The characterization in this rubbish is non-existant, and the acting even worse.

The witty comments attempted are just so common that its no longer ""witty"". I also think certain characters were a waste of time...such as Ben's lawyer-friend sidekick. He's there for laughs, but I wasn't laughing. Plus, I HATED the way Jen and Ben meet. He's so anxious to find out this woman's name that he chases after her for really no reason and then they engage in a fight slash dance scene that was sooooo cheesy. I was expecting music from ""Flashdance"" and ""Fame"" to pop on anytime. The main villain...NOT scary. I had absolutely no feelings for the character whatsoever. They didn't really spend much time exploring that character. I'm not familiar with the comic book. I was more of a DC comics person growing up (though I LOVED the spider-man movie!).

2277346,4,B0009B0GYA,"""Daredevil"" has always been one of my favorite Marvel characters.  It truly was a surprise to me when I first learned that a film was actually going to be made about him.  He teamed up with Lou Ferrigno's ""Hulk"" when that TV series was used to crank out a few TV movies, but that particular flick was wretched.  It did no justice to the ""Daredevil"" character.
This ""Daredevil,"" however, stays fairly true to the comic book, although I felt the story dragged somewhat.  The worst part of the movie was when Murdock and Elektra first meet.  The scenes with the two of them ""play-fighting"" came across as too rehearsed and just downright sugary.  Too sugary for a complex hero like ""Daredevil.""  Other than that, the movie is very good.  Comic faithfuls and general movie-goers alike will not be let down by this film.  It contains enough action and humor for anyone, and seems to flow in the same vein as Michael Keaton's portrayal of ""Batman"" in the first of that series of movies.
The film is very dark, and very violent, which stays true to form when compared with the comic book, especially during the Frank Miller era.
Whenever I watch ""Spiderman,"" I get this happy feeling from when I was a child still growing up.  It takes me back to a time when superheroes were clean cut, patriotic, and all-around good guys.  When I view ""Daredevil,""  it takes me to my teen years when I thought the world was against me and no one was ever going to help me through.  At that time, superheroes were no longer the good guys, they had become as complex as normal human beings and fought with themselves more than against an enemy.  This type of hero is closer to the real deal, he has problems, both physical and emotional, and there are no defined enemies anywhere.
One other small note, if you have young children, I don't suggest letting them watch this film.  ""Daredevil"" was geared more toward adults in the comics and so is this film.",1060041600,,1930,4.553623188405797

2277348,3,B0009B0GYA,"Reactions to this movie can go a lot of ways, because there are a plethora of positives and negatives to be found.
The Good:
The action is decent and has the added creativity of using computer enhanced shots for Daredevil's sound wave enhanced sight during the fight scenes.  I liked that the characters had the ability to receive visible, even brutal injuries because it forces them to remain grounded in reality.  The villians are another strong point.  Colin Farrel steals every scene with over the top charisma and hilarious facial expressions, while Michael Clark Duncan just has the perfect head bad guy ""look"" about him.  Another cool part is a rather innovative first kiss between Daredevil and Electra that comes together as a genuine and unique moment in an otherwise mundane script.
The Bad:
  The film seems choppy at times, and all of the interesting characters are wasted as the movie doesn't seem to have much time for development.  The script is little more than ""servicable,"" which means that conversations are frequently bland.  The main problem here is that of the title character, Ben Affleck.  He has been on and off in other movies, but here it seems like facial expressions and any kind of emotive acting has been thrown out in favor of a performance without substance and feeling.  When I think of Daredevil, I think of of three major characteristics that Affleck doesnt appear to have.  One is athletic ability.  Tobey Maguire became toned and muscular for Spiderman.  Here, Affleck looks to be surrounded by droopy putty with no muscular definition at all.  Secondly, the Daredevil character is supposed to have an intense drive.  Affleck exudes a passive, take things as they come vibe, and his expressions are usually vacant.  A third thing I would expect is some form of fire or passion that makes Daredevil do the things he does, but here, I can only sense that he's tired.
Other than that, the movie moves at a reasonably good pace and is entertaining enough to be enjoyable.  I would have to recommend seeing it on the basis of the excellent villians, some good action, and the innovative kiss.",1059955200,,2126,4.8448753462603875

I liked the dark and gothic view of Daredevil rather than the chipper happy Marvel induced Daredevil. I liked how they added the tale of the BULLSEYE vs. ELECTRA bit in this film from issue #181 of Daredevil comics. And to go off track for a sec...... Spiderman stinked to me. It wasn't dark, had hardly any action, the movie mistakes were easily spottiable and it was too happy. And Daredevil had no movie mistakes, more action and a rather decent plot. The only complaint is that the action needed to be a bit more stylish (hence MATRIX or BLADE).
Some (or alot) of people seem to dislike this film cuz they either hate BEN AFFLECK or the Daredevil movie was not like the comics at all. Well WAKE UP! This is the 21 CENTURY! Me and alot of others want anti-heroes and darker and cooler movies. Not happy crap! If you want happy movies, watch BLACK & WHITE FILMS. So this is a good film.

2277352,3,B0009B0GYA,"I skipped seeing Daredevil in the theatre, thinking it looked like something that should definitely be rented. I was right.
I had never heard of Daredevil before the movie came out, because I don't really know much about superheroes other than the standard spiderman, batman, superman, etc. But even though I had never heard of him before, the story seemed strangely familiar.
Boy is exposed to toxic waste/radioactive materials, gains super powers, then a close family member is killed by a Bad Guy which fills the boy with anger and hatred toward the Bad Guy. Then boy gets a costume, brings justice to rapists and muggers, and eventually has some showdowns with super villains.
I guess thats just the way comic books are, however.
The movie was farely entertaining however, with some good fight scenes and a cool radar effect which shows how Daredevil can see like a bat by seeing the sound waves bounce off of objects. A lot was left unexplained however, such as why Daredevil sleeps in a tank of water, and why he has scars all over his back and is taking a ton of medication. I didn't really understand what that was all about.
The love story part of the movie is also farely cheesy. Daredevil meets a lady and sleeps with her the second time they meet, immediately falling in love with her, only to have her die about 15 minutes later in the movie. I guess it was supposed to be love at first site or something, but it still felt really fake and rushed.
The supervillains, Bullseye and the Kingpin also felt much more comic booky than the main hero did. Their acting was over the top and exaggerated, whereas Ben Affleck seemed to take the part way too seriously. Bullseye stole the movie in my opinion Colin Farrell seemed to have fun with the part and he also had some really great lines.
The ending of the movie was kind of depressing though. Daredevil loses the girl and doesnt kill the bad guys so you don't really get the feeling that he won at all. Maybe they were just hoping for a sequel so they decided to leave all the main characters alive or something.",1059868800,,2072,4.542780748663102

Colin Farrell. A little over the top, but he looks like he is having a ball playing Bullseye, and brings some life and energy to an otherwise pointless and boring superhero film.
 Now with the bad. Ben Affleck is miscast as the title character Daredevil. First of all, he looks rediculous in the costume. Second, he is so boring in the role, that it seems obvious he did not want to make this film, and only wanted to capitalize on the success of Spiderman. Michael Clarke Duncan, so amazing in The Green Mile, is laughable as the villain KingPin. The stunts are nothing spectacular. They are choppy and slow, and are not exciting at all. The sets look fake, and the story is just pointless. The only thing that makes this film redeem itself is Jennifer Garner and Colin Ferrell. See the film for them only, but if you want to see a great Superhero film, then watch Spiderman again. Extremly disappointed in this film, and I was so excited to see it. The trailer makes it look amazing, but it is certainly not.",1059868800,,1187,4.470046082949309

It was like after Survivor, one after another a new reality show came out and it's still going. Then came a very good adaption of Spiderman. Then came this. Well this...eh.
Matt Murdock is 12 or so with a prize boxer fighter of a dad. After witnessing something a bit troubling that his dad is doing, he runs off and gets blinded by toxic. Only instead of being permanently blinded, his other 4 senses actually are heightened and his vision becomes like a radar using sound. In one scene, a train makes his vision go all screwy, a simple tap on some bars creates a wave which ""clears"" the vision and keeps it normal.
Murdock now grown up, is getting a bad name on the streets and also meets the gorgeous Elektra, the daughter of a wealthy tycoon. Due to some bad timing, Elektra sees Daredevil escaping, thinking he killed her father. Not only dealing with Elektra's revenge, he must tend with Bullseye, a psychotic who has extreme accuracy with anything he throws, and Kingpin, the head honcho and a massive man.
After watching this film, I didn't really have desire to watch it again, unlike the first 2 Batman's or Spiderman.

2277356,4,B0009B0GYA,"Marvel Comics' ""Man Without Fear"" was a moderate box office hit in theaters (no SPIDER-MAN or X-MEN, it performed a bit better than BLADE, and did far better, profit-wise, than the dismal HULK), but it is a natural on video, where it's claustraphobic, dark story seems better suited. The tale of blind lawyer/masked Hell's Kitchen protector Matt Murdock, it gives Ben Affleck his best performance to date (why a mask seems to improve his acting, who knows?), but the film is stolen by Colin Farrell's WAY over-the-top villain, Bullseye, and Jennifer Garner, as the elusive and naturally sexy Elektra. Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin is less successfully realized; while he has the height and bulk for the role, he is far less threatening than he seemed in THE WHOLE NINE YARDS, and his lack of menace makes his final confrontation with DD less impressive than Bullseye's.

Just as Spider-Man is Marvel's parallel to DC's purely heroic Superman (meek nice guy with glasses becomes superhero, with elderly adopted guardians; works at a newspaper, and has a 'girlfriend' who prefers the superhero), Daredevil is a superpowered variation to the darker, more justice-driven Batman (his parent's death triggers a need for revenge; the police deny his existence, initially, although a reporter guesses his secret identity; he prowls at night, his goal being to rid the streets of scum and vermin). Both the first BATMAN and DAREDEVIL feature churches, prominently, in climactic scenes (DD's showdown with Bullseye, Batman's with Joker); BATMAN RETURNS and DAREDEVIL both feature leather-clad female ally/adversary/love interests who supposedly 'die' by film's end. The analogies were even more obvious in the original DD comic, in the sixties, when Daredevil's sonar-like senses were the result of intense training, and the technology of the Billyclub he carried, and not the later explanation of being blinded by radioactive chemicals that heightened his senses. The bottom line is, movie critics who complained that DD was just a minor league variation of SPIDER-MAN weren't paying enough attention!

The CGI scenes of DAREDEVIL aren't quite as obvious as in SPIDER-MAN, which is a plus (having most of the acrobatics at night helps!), and director Mark Steven Johnson keeps the story moving, never allowing an occasional continuity lapse (Elektra and Matt's playground contest, which is pretty illogical, if Matt's trying to keep his powers secret!) from bringing the film down.

All-in-all, DAREDEVIL is a winner, and has me looking forward to both the DD and Elektra sequels being planned!",1059868800,,2587,5.304878048780488
2277357,3,B0009B0GYA,"I had low expectations for this film, and watching it didn't do much to change them. I did however catch the directors cut, and it was a little better ........ I said a little.
Problem number one - casting Ben Affleck in the lead role for any movie is a bad decision. But the casting of a great supporting cast including Colin Farrell, Jennifer Garner, Joe Pantoliano, and Michael Clark Duncan, more than makes up for that mistake.
Problem number two - The amazing ability of anyone in a fight scene to do unbeleivable acrobatic moves. Daredevil was given powers, Bullseye may have had special powers (his character wasn't really explored), but Electra (Garner) was a normal everyday human. When she ""lept a building in a single bound"", I felt that the movie had just taken a dramatic turn for the worse.

The positive aspect of this film? The storyline was good and easily followed (except the mystery behind the most intersting character - Bullseye). The acting was solid. The special effects were good, they didn't go overboard (George Lucas, are you listening?).

I'd not seen this film in the theaters, and I was certainly aware of all the unfavorable reviews.  That said, I purchased this DVD sight-unseen primarily for the Fuel and Evanescence music videos.  The 2-disc DVD set is very reasonably priced for what you get.  I won't list all the extras here because they are included with this product's listing and in about a hundred other customer reviews.  But any reservations I had about dropping the $$$ to buy this were alleviated by the wealth of bonus materials and that the film wasn't as terrible as I'd heard.
Granted, it is not a terribly exciting or engrossing film.  It feels like we've seen too many films just like it (except better) recently.  But at the very least it is very competently made, and Colin Farrell steals every scene he's in.
So if you are a fan of the bonus features that come with Special Edition DVD's, you could do a lot worse than to buy this selection.

That was Frank Miller's motto and that is what you get here.  Ben Affleck turns in a romantic and vioent turn as Matt Murdock, the first blind superhero in the Marvel universe.  And despite stunt celebrity casting somehow the rest of the cast is well matched.  Jennifer Garner does not have the Greek look or even the red costume of Elektra, but she can kick the [stuff] out of anybody and still look beautiful doing it.  Michael Clark Duncan plays Kingpin, and despite the white version found in the comics ... he's more than perfect.  And Collin Farrell as Bullseye is a joy to watch!

But I was relieved to realize it was one hour and forty minutes, and not the bloated 2 hour plus running time of most comic book movies.  This is one the girls can get behind too, because Elektra is beautiful and deadly and the equal of any fighter in the movie.  It's fun, it's entertaining, and it moves like a runaway train!  What more can you ask for?Well... the DVD is tricked out with more features than you can imagine!  Two discs, commentary, documentaries, text commentary, behind the scenes branching, music videos, making of the movie and the history of the COMIC!  Each documentary runs as long or longer than the movie!  It's powerfully well done by Fox who always sets the bar and raises it.

Despite being based on a very interesting comic character, and following one of the better story arcs in that character's universe, the movie simply fails on just about every level, except for set design and cinematography.  It wasn't even that successful at the box office, which makes this 2-Disc edition that pulls out all the stops so surprising.  FOX does a much better job with this release than Columbia did with ""Spider-Man"", which was a MUCH better film.
First, the movie.  Ben Affleck plays Matt Murdoch, blind crusading lawyer by day, superhero crusader in NY's Hell's Kitchen by night.  The movie does a very good job setting up the origin story, and then collapses in it's own bloated storytelling.  See Murdoch was blinded by a freak toxic spill as a boy, which has enhanced his other four senses in such a way that he basically sees better than those with functioning eyes.  He became a lawyer to right the wrongs of the world, apparently, though he's not a prosecutor per se, which would seem ideal for a young man out to see justice done, though the first time we see Matt he appears to be prosecuting a rapist.  Why?  Maybe he moonlights at the DA's when not working at his own Law Firm.  It's a tad confusing.  He even lets up on the rapist in court specifically so he can kill the guy later.  So he's a different hero-he kills people.  (Batman was never supposed to be a killer, by the way).
Anyway, one day he and his law partner are eating breakfast when Jennifer Garner walks in.  Matt smells her perfume so he knows she's a hottie, and proceeds to try and find out who she is.  Her name is Elektra, and he father is a big Corporate type.  This is important because dear old dad has ties to the Kingpin, played much too genially by Michael Clarke Duncan.  Kingpin is the source of all crime in New York, sort of like Professor Moriarty was the source of all crime in the world of Sherlock Holmes, only Matt Murdoch is no Holmes, and the Kingpin breaks people in half.  He's connected to Murdoch's past in a way that is so obvious you aren't sure if the filmmakers are trying to be clever and failing, or just being sloppy.  Anyway, Daredevil starts messing around in Kingpin's business, so he calls in Bullseye, an Irish assasin played by talentless Irish actor Colin Farrell who can hit just about any target and has a bulls-eye scar in his forehead.  Colin Farrell must have made some kind of classic deal with the devil, in which he gets to be in a lot of movies, but they all stink, as he in NOT a talented actor but the press loves him.  Anyway, Elektra gets involved through a dumb plot contrivance and becomes an assasin.  All of this leads up to...not much.  As I said before, not a whole lot really takes place in this movie.  It's trying to be about bigger things than action, like love, duty, honor, and justice.
These characters do talk alot, which is a mjor mistake when you cast Affleck in the lead.  Garner displays almost none of the charm she has in ""Alias"", or even in her brief but impressive cameo in ""Catch Me If You Can"".  The makeup people have also found a way to make her look unatractive, which I would have thought impossible, but they do.  The talks between Murdoch and Elektra are poorly scipted attempts at serious romance between too hurt souls, and come off as trite.  Colin Farell hams it up enough to keep him from being too annoying.  The biggest waste is Duncan as Kingpin, who is not writen nearly menacing enough and seems more like a genial tough guy than a criminal overlord.
The film was written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, a Daredevil fan, he claims, who's only other credit is Simon Birch.  He shows very little action skill here, as even the potentially excellent set pieces he sets up in a church organ are sloppy and he uses CGI effects like a crutch.  Plus, he seems to have given Murdoch powers he never had in the comic, such as flight, or so it appears.  The film does look good and dark, stealing a page from Burton's ""Batman"", who is very similar to Daredevil in motivation, so your eyes may have a good time.  But as a movie, ""Daredevil"" is a resounding disapointment in story, acting, and executuion.
The DVD itself is surprisingly excellent, with in depth looks at the creation of various aspects of the film, music videos, some comic-to-screen transfers, and a Jennifer Garner Screen test that lets you see her natural beauty in a way the filmmakers chose to hide for some unkown reason.  Anyway, X2 redeemed FOX's Comic book film hold, so wait for the big edition of that one.  This film is a dissapointment.",1059696000,,4646,4.5035799522673035

Aside from Colin Farrel, the cast proves itself to be very untalented.  (Although Jennifer Garner is nice to look at.)  The action sequences are tolerable, but the climactic fight between Daredevil and The Kingpin was a very big disappointment.",1059609600,,387,4.803030303030303

I have never been so annoyed in my life, you cant hear the actors talking all you can hear is the punching,fighting, and background noises of the city. I cant believe it, they do have a visually impaired version which you can hear them talking,but over them talking you hear some guy talking about what everyone is doing(which is for the visually imparied,which is ok but its still annoying)I wish they would have made version for people who want to see it with the actors talking and don't need the visually imparied. I have not even watched half of it because its just so darn maddening trying to hear. I don't even know if I can watch the rest of it. I don't know what they were thinking a marvel comic made into a movie with NO SOUND-its the stupidiest thing I have ever heard of. So if reading subtitles don't bother you and hearing another guy talking over the acters doesnt, then I am sure this is the movie for you.",1059609600,,1028,4.25
2277381,4,B0009B0GYA,"Matt Murdock lost his sight to a chemical accident as a child. But the chemicals that blinded him also heightened his other senses, especially his hearing, which became so acute that he could distinguish objects by the sound that bounces off of them. After his father was  murdered by local gangsters, Matt vowed to use his preternatural senses in the cause of justice. He grew up to become a lawyer who refuses to defend any guilty person. But by night, Matt (Ben Affleck) watches -or listens- over his neighborhood as Daredevil, clad in a red devilish suit, ready to intervene should any citizen be victimized and to meet out justice when the court system fails. One day, when he tries to talk to a pretty woman on the street, Matt meets his match. She is Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), the daughter of a prominent and very wealthy man, and nearly a match for Matt's fighting skills. Matt is taken with her at once. But the man behind all of the city's crime and corruption, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), has targeted Elektra's family. And he has called upon an assassin named Bullseye (Colin Farrell), to do the job. Matt is determined that Daredevil will protect his new love, but things don't go entirely as planned.

""Daredevil"", the movie, is based upon Marvel's ""Daredevil"" comic book series. I am not familiar with the comic books, so I came to this movie without any preconceived image of the characters in my mind. I can't comment on how faithful it is to the original, but the movie definitely won me over. ""Daredevil"" is somewhat reminiscent of Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" movies in its dark themes and visuals that harken to comic book roots. James Tocci's art direction and Ericson Core's cinematography are fantastic and quite beautiful. They establish the film's mood, place, and suck the viewer in in the film's first couple of minutes. The fight sequences are surprisingly original considering the abundance  of recent martial arts action movies. Daredevil is the most convincingly human superhero that I've ever seen. He's scarred and in pain and pops painkillers like tic-tacs to get through the day so that he can exact more ""justice"". He is also morally ambiguous. Daredevil is a vigilante who presumes to know who deserves to be punished and how. The irony of killing and wreaking havoc in the pursuit of justice is not lost on him, and Ben Affleck does a really good job of communicating Matt Murdock's pain and moral turmoil. The cast is terrific all around. Michael Clarke Duncan is a pleasure to watch as the very large and violent, but somehow almost jovial, villain Kingpin. Colin Farrell is wonderfully entertaining as the colorful and gleeful killer Bullseye. ""Daredevil"" is one of the best ""comic book"" movies I have seen. Director and screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson is to be commended for his ability to extract the essential elements from the comic books and pack them into a 1 hour and 45 minute movie. Please note that this movie contains graphic violence which may disturb more sensitive members of the audience.",1059609600,,3079,4.872137404580153
2277382,1,B0009B0GYA,"I found this movie to be a complete disappointment.  Ben Affleck is good at chasing lesbians, but being the infamous Daredevil.... I think not.",1059609600,,143,4.958333333333333
2277383,4,B0009B0GYA,"I saw Daredevil in the theaters and I must say it was very different then the other Marvel movies that I have seen, such as X-Men, X2:X-Men United, and Spider-Man. This movie was much darker and had a more serious story than the preveous Marvel Comic Movies. Ben Affleck plays the role of Matt Murdock/Darevil very well, much better than I expected. Jennifer Garnner plays a very good Elektra. She portrays the comic book charactor very well. Overall there isn't that much bad acting in the film, which makes me wounder why it didn't do well in the Box Office. The 'Special Features' on the DVD are not as good as they sound. I was very disappointed with that part of the DVD.
Overall: This would be better for a weekend rental rather than buying it.",1059609600,,750,4.522058823529412
2277384,4,B0009B0GYA,"When I saw this movie in the theaters, it didn't impress me as much as I wanted it to, but seeing it again, it's starting to grow on me.  While having a few issues with the movie, I think it was fairly well done.  Being an avid comic book reader in my youth, I was very familiar with the characters, so I did have preconceptions of how I thought the movie should have been, and maybe that was the problem.
The movie tells the story of Matt Murdock, a blind, idealistic lawyer who does a leather outfit and seeks justice at night, played by Ben Affleck.  As a young boy, Matt is blinded in an accident by biohazardous material, but his four remaining senses are subsequently augmented to superhuman levels.  This includes hypersensitive hearing to the point where he can visualize sound waves reflecting off objects allowing him to 'see'.  We also learn how his father, a professional boxer by trade, was murdered because he refused to participate in a fixed fight by taking a fall.  This sets up Matt's motivation for becoming a superhero of sorts, using his special abilities to help those who can't help themselves, both in and out of court.
After all this origin stuff is laid out for us, we fast forward to the present, where we see Matt in court involved in a case against a particularly nasty sort of fellow who manages to get acquitted of a rape/abuse charge.  Later that night, Matt dons his outfit, and begins to seek his own justice against this fellow.
We also get to meet Matt's future love interest, Elektra, played by Jennifer Garner.  We find out her father is involved with a major crime syndicate run by Carlton Fisk a.k.a Kingpin, played by the ever enormous Michael Clarke (The Green Mile).  Her father wants out of the business, to which the Kingpin decides to set him up for a fall and make it look like Elektra's father is really the Kingpin.  Fisk calls in a hire assassin, Bullseye, played by a baldheaded Colin Farrell.  He goes after Elektra's father, and ends up getting into an altercation with Daredevil.  During their fight, Bullseye manages to kill Elektra's father and make it look like Daredevil was responsible, so this sets up a fight between Elektra and Daredevil.  I don't want to go further into the story than I already have as not to spoil anything, but, as you can probably guess, Daredevil and Bullseye end up having a climatic fight at the end of the movie.  Oh yeah, and Kingpin gets his due, also.
There were some major and minor differences between the comic book and the movie.  The biggest was Kingpin.  In the comic book, he's a fat, bald white guy while in the movie he's a large, muscular black guy.  Was this a good or bad change?  It didn't make a big difference to me, but I didn't feel like Michael Clarke's character could have been the head of a major organized crime syndicate.  Ben Affleck played his role well, but his performance always seemed a little off the mark.  He just didn't seem to really get into the character to me, like a puzzle piece that doesn't quite fit.  Jennifer Gardner was probably the best in this movie, as she seemed to really fit in with the character I remember from the comic, although the comic book Elektra had black hair and seemed a little more ethnic in her Greek background.  And her fight with Bullseye...what was up with that?  She was an expertly trained fighter, and Bullseye's main ability was to be able to turn almost any object into a deadly weapon by way of being able to throw it and always hit his mark.  In the comic, he was not an amazing fighter, but in the movie he was able to hold his own against Elektra and Daredevil.  Whatever....Colin Farrell did all right, but just didn't seem right in the part.  And that bullseye brand on his fore head...man, that was goofy.  Also some of the music just didn't seem to fit the scenes...like the scenes were filmed to fit the music, and not the other way around.
I guess if you liked Spider-man, then you will probably like this movie, as the formula is the same, but the chemistry just doesn't seem to work like it did in Spider-man.  This movie is a little darker, and doesn't have the whimsical element of Spider-man, but it seems to try and stay true to the comic book, which I appreciated.
As far as extras go, there are tons.  Like 8 hours worth.  There are some extras on the first disc along with the movie, and then the whole second disc is all more extras.  One extra I thought was pretty cool was the running visual commentary, like the old Pop Up video show on VH1.  There is also an enhanced audio track for the visually impaired, of which I am not really sure what it is, but reminded me of that Python bit on the Holy Grail movie where they had a guy shouting things for the hearing impaired.
Oh yeah, once the movie ends and the credits roll, keep watching as there is a bit more of the movie about half way through the credits.  I missed it in the theaters, but caught it here.  It's worth it.",1059609600,,4962,4.446408839779005
2277385,3,B0009B0GYA,"I have a good friend who has been addicted to comic book heroes since childhood, and as he has matured into becoming a superb radical painter, he has been inspired by them to create his own pantheon of superheroes on canvas, with one loosely based on me, called the Rhino. So of course I had to go see this latest dramatization of one of the Marvel Comics stable of sixties and seventies action heroes, an essential part of that latest twist on the genre, with complex anti-heroes replete with a variety of twisted and tormented pasts, each trying to resolve their inner demons even as they wage a war for truth, justice, and the American way. Well, sort of.
The new Daredevil movie remains true to the original comic book concept, but whoever decided on the cast of this project must have being `doing lunch' out in La Jolla that afternoon that they discussed character requirements. Instead, it appears as though someone did a hasty demographic scan of the potential audience for the project and then decided to cram as much eye candy onto the screen as possible by way of the leading roles. Ben Affleck could have phoned in his role, so underplaying it that we're left wondering if perhaps he doesn't suffer from aphasia as well as loss of eyesight here. He looks and acts the part, but seems to be walking through the paces without much enthusiasm of conviction. Ben, phone home! Jennifer Garner, in her first movie since stirring in the runaway TV series, ""Alias"", fills the screen with charisma and sex appeal, but lacks the believable love connection to th Daredevil's alter ego to convince us she digs the guy. And Colin Farrell is so badly over the top as Bullseye that we wonder if he doesn't need a quiet vacation somewhere.
Yet with all this said, this is a well-executed action movie, with some terrific and sometimes quite ingenious sequences and knockout fight scenes. The special effects are also well done indeed, and what can only be called the choreography of all this spectacular violence so well punctuates the other scenes, providing such an exciting and eventful rhythm to it that we often forget just how marginal the actors are in executing their roles. Almost...yet the movie works well enough and the actors are now becoming enough of a box office draw that we can expect a sequel or two to pop out of the woodwork in the next movie season or so. This is a good movie, but one that missed an opportunity to be much better had they given Ben Affleck some No-Doze and encouraged Farrell and Garner to restrain themselves a bit.

First, the action sequences are great but can get extremely confusing due to the lack of lighting or confusing camera angles. Second, some of the dialogue and backgound information on the characters is a little rediculous. For example, why Daredevil becomes fearless all of a sudden just because he cant see. Other than that the movie is a great superhero follow up to the amazing Spider-man flick. I recommend it.",1059523200,,566,4.67
2277387,3,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil is the kind of superhero movie that Batman was.  It's dark and engaging because of it.  It draws the viewer in to the action by making it realistic in its own surreal-ality.
Since every other reviewer will give you a synopsis of the film, I won't belabor that issue.  Rather, I'll address the film and its actors directly.
Ben Affleck is a good choice for the role of Daredevil/Matt Murdock, although I sure do wish that for this movie (and for him in everyday life) he'd had a better toupee, because it looked like a bad rug from the beginning and never changed its ""fake"" look.
Also, Jennifer Garner was a great choice for Elektra.  She's lithe and muscular all at once.
Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan are also excellent choices for their roles.
A few of my gripes are the fact that the fight sequences seem to be badly shot.  I'm not familiar with this director.  As I understand it, the second director is the one who actually directs the action and filming of fight sequences.  Well the producers need to get the guy who was in charge of the fight sequences for Blade, because those scenes were well shot and directed - in Daredevil, it's as if we're not privy to the full action, by virtue of the way the sequences are shot.
The story moves along quickly enough, but in earnest the finale of the film is something of a let down.  I'll admit that I'm a bit jaded by most film's use of action to the very last minute, but here it could sure use a dose of that.
All that said, Daredevil is a winner of an action film and a great winner in the superhero categorty.  Marvel may have been late getting to the game with its roster of superheros to film, but once they did, they've done a really great job on the whole.

2277389,4,B0009B0GYA,"I rented this movie yesterday when it first came out, and wasn't expecting much but I'd have to say I was impressed.  I'm in the younger generation so I didn't have the comic books like Spiderman, The Hulk, Daredevil or X-Men available to me so I rely on the movies to tell some of the great stories.  Director/Screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson did a wonderful job of that.  He made it clear what had happened to Matt and how he lived his life afterwards.  The action scenes were superb also with great fighting and matrix type slow motion.
12 year old Matt Murdock is a kid that gets picked on at school.  His father (David Keith) tells him not to fight because he is going to become a ""lawyer"" or a ""doctor"" when he's all grown up.  One day he takes a shortcut home from school only to see his father mugging and bullying a guy in the alley.  Devastated from what he's seen Matt runs the other way only into a chemical drop off.  He causes a semi to hit a barrel of chemicals and a spray shoots off into his eyes.
He wakes up in a hospital with bandages over his  eyes, and able to hear everything around him, even through the walls.  Obviously his other 4 senses have grown stronger with losing his sight. His dad comes to visit him and says a couple important things, ""I'm sorry"" and they made a promise that neither of them would ever give up.  Keeping their promises the father goes back into his old profession, a prizefighter. Even though Matt is blind his other 4 senses create a radar type vision so he can see some things.  He makes a promise to himself that he would live without fear for the rest of his life, and starts practicing martial arts and fighting.  One night his father is visited by a guy named Falon or Vallon before a fight.  He tells him to take a dive in the fight but keeping his promise to Matt he doesnt give up and wins the fight.  Afterwards out in the street the father is beaten up by 2 guys and then killed and a red rose is left on the body.
Years later, when all grown up Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) is a lawyer during the day and Daredevil at night, being a lawyer helps him pick out his victims for the night.  All he wants is justice.  He sleeps in this coffin type thing with water filled up to his ears, because if he were to sleep on the outside he could hear everything going on outside.  He wakes up and goes over to his shelf and takes a 10 dollar bill out of a box and folds it lengthwise and then pulls out a 5 dollar bill out of another box and folds it the other way, so he can tell which one is which.  He goes to work that day and goes to court to defend a purgery victim.  Matt ask him a question and because of his advanced hearing he can hear his heartbeat and can tell if he's lying by his heartbeat speeding up.  Later that night Matt has his justice against this guy and leads to a great action scene.
The next day while at lunch with his assistant (talented Jon Favreau) he smells this woman from outside the diner.  She walks in and Matt follows her and just wants to know her name.  He grabs her, she says ""I don't like to be followed and I don't like to be touched,"" then they pull out the martial arts on each other.  After they're done she says ""Elektra Naccios"" (played by Jennifer Garner).  She is the daughter of a billionaire that is in trouble with the Kingpin (Micheal Clarke Duncan), the king of crime in Hell's Kitchen.  He has been squealing to the papers about the identity of the Kingpin.  The Kingpin hires Bullseye (Collin Farrell) to assassinate Naccios.  I won't tell the rest.
Ben Affleck and Collin Farrell hand in the best performances, while Jennifer Garner seems out of place but still is great to look at.  Micheal Clarke Duncan hands in a worthy performance also.  Also love the cameos by Stan Lee and Kevin Smith, great.  Mark Steven Johnson does a great job adapting the comic to the movie.  Darker than previous comic book movies, including more violence and murder.  Not as good as Spiderman in my opinion but a must have DVD.  Daredevil is a badass.

In this case the answer is yes. Somehow watching the two documentaries  breathes new life into both the film and the character DareDevil. I gained a new appreciation for this project which I found to be an OK film in theatres but overall a dudd compared to X-Men or Spiderman. I appreciated that it was far more darker and reminded me of the way Spawn was made. A darker hero with more guts and they weren't afraid to show that this story was not gonna end like Peter and Mary Jane. Despite it's many flaws (The use of rock music, it's short 90 minute span, the playground fight scene) it seemed to get better as the movie went on. In the end I enjoyed it enough to buy it. This DVD surprised me because this movie was alot less embarassing on TV then in a theatre. Some really bad lines are now just funny and entertaining where in theatres we all seemed to share the cringe of a badly read line by Mr. Ben ""Can't Act"" Affleck. Such as when he tells a villian ""The light at the end of the tunnel, thats not heaven. It's the C train""
The casting of Collin Ferrel must have put everyone to shame when he stole the show as the maniacle villian Bullseye. The rest of the performances are enough to fill the cliche of each character but never do they ever break the mold or bring anything new to the table. I loved the shot if ol' horn head on the cross at the beginning (stolen from Spawn btw) and their were many great ""hero"" shots. It was deep enough to not be stale or  boring and in the end I think Hollywood could have made a far worse film. I have a soft spot for seeing Comic book characters come to life, even in a flawed film it's still a thrill. I hope we see a sequel and just like X2 it could surpass this movie in every way.
The features in this set are so fulfilling those who have doubts should really check it out. Theirs enough to wet any fans appetite and it really gives the movie more of a back bone.

2277405,2,B0009B0GYA,"Since ""Blade"" came out in 1999, Marvel Comics caught a big one with the super-hero movies. A year later, Bryan Singer proved with ""X-Men"" that comic book adaptations could be both ambitious and succesful, then... a monster was born. ""Blade 2"", ""Spiderman"", ""X-Men 2"" and ""The Hulk"", all hit (and smashed) the box office, and many more are on the way. Of all these flicks, only ""Daredevil"" was a financial disapointment, and I have to say that 10 minutes into the movie you can see why.
First of all, and I think most people agree on this, the main problem of ""Daredevil"" is its lead star. Ben Affleck is an actor that just doesn't seem to make it . He is very good as Matt Murdock, the pro-bono lawyer, and you even like the guy when he talks to his buddy in the Seinfeld-like coffee shop. However, once he puts on his superhero costume, the magic runs out. Affleck just doesn't have the dark sex appeal necessary for the nocturnal vigilante (anyone who has seen Tim Burton's Batman knows how important this is), therefore his character fails to deliver the necessary empathy or connection between the audience and the hero. You would think that with such a problem, the supporting cast should make up for the rest, but you're wrong. The movie has some beloved Marvel characters like Elektra (Jennifer Garner), Bullseye (Colin Farrell) and Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan), but none of them is crucial to the story. NONE OF THEM! I swear to God that if you add up all the scenes in which they are, none of them is on the movie for more than 20 minutes. Or at least, it doesn't seem so. Elektra, especially, was thought to be the best thing in the movie. At least, in the trailers it looked like she was. She sort of is, but she only has two (I repeat, TWO) fight scenes, and her character is pretty much wasted. So is Bullseye, who is little more than a cartoon in Colin Farrell's hands. As for Kingpin, well, I don't mind that they changed his looks dramatically, but he's the least developed character. A stupid plot twist makes him Daredevil's archenemy, and the end is just silly and pathetic.
Another problem is the plot. Or better yet, the ""plots"". A lot of things happen in the movie, but none of them are central. There comes a time when Elektra is out to kill Daredevil, believing he's her father's murdeder. THAT should've been the movie, but it is resolved quickly and without consequences. Anyway, in plot, character and performances, ""Daredevil"" takes the plunge big time.
The edition is another story. It is by far one the best I've seen. It would be easier to say what doesn't have. Of all the documentaries, featurettes and other features, some are dedicated to the comic book, others to the movie. Both are great. It seems like this time New Line Cinema really went for the money, which makes me think that they hope ""Daredevil"" to be a hit on DVD more than it was on the theaters. If you're a fan of the comic book, then these features should be more satisfying that the movie itself.
There isn't much more. I really can't say that I liked ""Daredevil"", but I've seen worse. However, of all these superhero fever, I advice you to stick with ""The Hulk"" or ""X-Men 2"". This goes to show you that for a comic-book adaptation to be good, it's not all about big budgets and special effects. There's something more, and this one doesn't have it. I've heard that they are preparing new superhero movies, including a second ""Spiderman"", a third ""X-Men"", ""The Fantastic Four"", ""Elektra"" and ""Catwoman"". Somehow, I don't think that Ben and his blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen are making a comeback.",1059264000,,3604,4.5978260869565215
2277406,2,B0009B0GYA,"**1/2 Matt Murdock is a mild-mannered, pro bono attorney by day and a high-flying, crime-fighting superhero by night.  The one thing that separates this costumed do-gooder (who goes by the name Daredevil) from his comic book brethren like Superman and Spiderman is that Murdock/Daredevil happens to be blind.  The same accident involving radioactive chemicals that, as a boy, deprived Matt of his eyesight also had the bizarre effect of heightening and enhancing his other senses, most notably hearing and touch, to an astonishing degree (it should be pointed out that little is done in the story with taste and smell).  The accident also appears, inexplicably, to have given him the power to defy the laws of physics and gravity.  Like any superhero worthy of the title, he uses these preternatural skills to right wrongs and bring justice to the imperiled and helpless citizenry living in the urban jungles of New York City.
The hero's handicap seems to be about the only element, in fact, that distinguishes the movie ""Daredevil"" from the earlier films based on those other characters.  As conceived by writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, the tone of this film is a few shades darker than the one in ""Spiderman"" and a few shades lighter than the one in ""Batman"" and ""Darkman.""  Since there is nothing particularly fresh or groundbreaking offered in this film, one begins to wonder why Hollywood feels such a compelling need to drive this particular genre into the already over-saturated ground (even adolescents, the target audience for this type of film, seem to be tiring of all these offerings lately).  ""Daredevil"" provides all the requisite scenes of its superhero soaring through the air, jumping from building to building, and karate-chopping his way to victory over a plethora of bad-guy enemies.  But it's all starting to feel a bit old hat by this time, so much so that, even in the moments when ""Daredevil"" is good, the film doesn't feel innovative and fresh enough for us to really commit to it.  Ben Affleck, with his earnest and stolid seriousness, does manage to bring a certain gravity to the main character - and his relationship with Elektra (Jennifer Garner), a young woman with some ""superhero"" moves of her own, is genuinely charming and touching at times.  There is a lovely scene in which Matt envisions Elektra's beauty by hearing the raindrops falling on her face.  It is in rare moments such as this that ""Daredevil"" rises above the conventions of its genre, but such moments are very few and far between indeed.  Most of the running time seems to be spent on characters performing acrobatic kickboxing moves on tops of skyscrapers (all of which are decked out with statuary in places where nobody would ever be likely to see it).  Colin Farrell invests the implement-wielding villain, Bullseye, with an air of sly menace that makes him a worthy foil to the lovestruck boy wonder of the piece.  I must say, in way of a caveat, that some of the violence in the film is uglier and more mean-spirited in nature than is, perhaps, justified by the material.
""Daredevil"" tries for a little thematic richness by dramatizing the internal conflict being waged inside Matt's psyche between the need to let the legal system runs its course and his own desire to achieve a little vigilante-type justice for the victims when the court system itself fails.  But that theme is never dealt with at any great level of depth.  The art direction, action sequences and special effects are generally impressive, but even they contribute to the generalized feeling of dj vu that hangs over the work.  Maybe it's finally time to outgrow our obsession with superheroes who come out of nowhere to fight our battles for us - and time to stop always thinking of ourselves as some sort of defeated underdog in need of protection.  There are certainly enough life-sized heroes living and working in our own communities and neighborhoods to serve as our inspiration.

Colin Farrel and the other villain (sorry, I don't know his name but he does lots of tv commercials) have fun-and when they are on the screen it is fun to watch. Unfortunately the camera focuses on Affleck and his inability to emote.

The movie is about Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), blind Lawyer by day and Crime FIghter by night.  HE is trying to clean up the city but unlike numerouse comic book heroes he seems to have no qualms in killing his target, not that he always does, but if they die, they die.  His main goal is to find the man who murdered his father and put him to justice.  When he gets involved wiht a lovly woman named Elecktra (Jennifer Garner) he gets involved in a war with the Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan) who he has been after for a while, and his hired hand Bullseye (Colin Farrel).
OVerall the movie is decent.  There are great action sequences and the Radar that Daredevil uses is pretty cool.  Colin Farrel proves why he is one of the future stars of Hollywood and Ben does a very convincing job as the Blind Lawyer.

Its work that must be done, even if the results are very little.

2277422,2,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil tries to be the big blockbuster movie of the year, evident in the recruitment of young 'hot' stars Ben Afflek, Collin Farrel and Jennifer Garner, but fails miserably.  The plot is weak mostly because it is rushed so much.  The writers attempted to base the plot and movement of the movie only on a few lines and fill the rest of the time with fight scenes that look like 10 year olds trying to imitate the Matrix.  All the characters are not only one dimensional but also stupid, with motives based on confusion, ""Elektra,"" or in the case of ""Bullseye,"" capriciousness.  The ending is the capstone of disappointment in a fight that seems ridiculously easy for the difference in strength and size between Michael Clark Duncan and Ben Affleck, as if the Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan) just says ""oh you are right, I'm sorry.""
The relationship Daredevil has to the journalist could be interesting, but is, instead, thrown into the movie for the ""last line's"" sake.

2277423,2,B0009B0GYA,"Another Marvel Comics character makes it to the screen. DAREDEVIL is co-produced by creator Stan Lee, which raises the viewer's expectations. This isn't the first movie to feature the character: Daredevil was previously played by Rex Smith (from the short lived TV series STREET HAWK) in the 1991 TVM, TRIAL OF THE INCREDIBLE HULK.
Ben Affleck plays Ben Affleck, who is trying to play Matt Murdock: a lawyer, and former Hell's Kitchen resident blinded at age 12 by toxic waste (that happens to fall off a fork-lift) after witnessing  the death of his prize fighter father Jack ""The Devil"" Murdock (David Keith) at the hands of thugs (phew!).
As always happens in comic books, this toxic waste may have deprived Matt of his sight; but has heightened his four remaining senses. So of course Matt does what has to be done: He dons a silly costume and becomes a vigilante fighting for the rights of the little people and keeping the city safe from crime.
But Matt/Daredevil appears to have met his match when he crosses paths with Wilson Fisk, a.k.a crime boss The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan, who gained 18kgs for the role) and his henchman, Bullseye (A shaven headed Colin Farrell with a bullseye tattooed on his forehead, hence the name).
However, Daredevil gains an ally in the karate kicking superbabe Elektra Nachios (ALIAS's Jennifer Garner), daughter of multi-millionaire Nicholas Nachios and together they join forces to try and topple the Kingpin (After she nearly beats the heck out of him, in an admittedly good fight scene). But tailing Matt is tabloid newsman Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano) who is trying to uncover the truth about the urban legend of Daredevil. A weak attempt at adding a subplot.
DAREDEVIL steals elements of BATMAN & THE HULK TV show; and when you combine this with a cliched script and a wooden lead, it all adds up to 100+ minutes of wannabe- hip; two- dimensional Hollywood drivel.
Good production design is one of DAREDEVIL's few redeeming features; but the movies ""Special Effects"" include a camera tilt of Daredevil's feet splashing in a puddle! What a suspense builder! Even BLOOD FEAST (1963) had visuals superior to this!
Also, check out this brilliant dialogue exchange when hero and villain finally meet face to face:
Kingpin: ""Daredevil!""
Daredevil: ""KINGPIN!!"".
Wow.
DVD extras include both audio AND text commentaries by the producer and director, and an ""Enhanced viewing mode"" function with a Behind The Scenes featurette narrated by the Visual Effects Supervisor , as well as popup factoids you can watch during the movie.

2277424,4,B0009B0GYA,"Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet says, ""All the stunts are done like in Hong Kong with concealed wires pulling the stars up as they do their high kung fu kicks. In real life, no true martial artist kicks high. The lower the better. However, in the movies where the bad guys are paid to fall down a la the script, the more fancy and stylish the moves, the better. Notwithstanding all that, I liked the movie. Colin Farrel is great as Bullseye, the lunatic killer who loves to throw lethal objects like Ninja Shaken and other such missiles at people. He is a totally different person from his character in The Recruit where he has a perpetual frown plus 5 o'clock stubble but looks much better. The scene where a young Daredevil puts an end to the school bullies really made my day. A super duper scene! I love too the scene in the plane where Bullseye kills the chatterbox old lady next to him. His weapon of choice, a humble peanut from those small packets the air hostess gives you with your martini. He really stops her inane and boring chatter with a single move. Personally, I really dislike people who talk too much. Jennifer Garner is very good. Muscular, craggy and curvaceous and, she is not beautiful in the classic sense, BUT has that sex appeal or 'je ne sais quoi' as the Frenchies say that most men find completely irresistable. She can kick my butt any time. Her martial arts moves are smooth although it is clear she has no background in the martial arts. The love scenes sizzle! There is a very obvious ""chemical attraction"" between the two lead actors and it shows. A Comic strip hero is brought to life as only Hollywood can do it, complete with computerized special effects. I could do with a cane like Daredevil's cane. It has as many weapons as James Bond's briefcase in ""From Russia With Love"". All hot blooded Daredevil fans must be wondering where they can get one just like it. The movie is so fast and SO exciting, don't see it if you want to sleep after the movie, you might dream of jumping up all over the place and beating up a few dozen baddies with your collapsible cane! The message is the same as in the ""Death Wish"" movies with Charles Bronson, namely, when the law fails, take matters in your own hands and just 'waste' the baddies. Simple and basic. Ah, if only life in the 21st Century were so simple. But there again, what about Iraq? Bush and Blair were real Daredevils there and they did one hell of a job! I'll vote for them anytime.

2277426,3,B0009B0GYA,"First off, let me state, that most of you won't agree with this review. Especially, if you're fans of this movie. But I simply want to make my opinion heard. This DVD has already been released in Australia so I can give a fair review about it.
The story revolves around Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck...Ugh!) who loses his sight at a very young age when chemical waste is sprayed onto his face due to a work accident. From there, his father (inspired by his son) goes back to his boxing past time. Where he then declines to take a dive and is ultimately killed by the mysterious Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan).
Matt Murdock realises that even though he is blind, his other senses escalate to a point where he can practically see again. Matt Murdock, then fights for 'Justice' over the death of his father. Matt Murdock is DareDevil, a street smart vigilante crime-fighter who falls in love with the beautiful martial-arts master Elektra (Jennifer Garner).
The DVD itself is spectacular with DTS 5.1 and over 5 hours of special features. We are also given an excellent video transfer where the world of DareDevil really comes to life. The menus are also exquisite, with DareDevil's soundwave vision setting the scene. The DVD also includes Director's commentary with an 'Enhanced Viewing Mode' which is 8 multi-angle behind-the-scenes segments.
The documentaries give a great inside look to this 80 million dollar blockbuster. The second disc comes close to 3 hours of featurettes which is great for the up and coming film makers. All in all a great DVD.
Now, onto the movie. The movie is very Clich. And when I say Clich...I mean CLICHE. For instance, Matt Murdock is a lawyer and when a rapist gets away he walks out of the courtroom and his best friend asks if he wants to go out that night? Matt Murdock replies 'I'm busy' and then we pan in on his face showing him get into his DareDevil get up and go after the rapist. Another moment is when DareDevil is up on the rafters of a bar and a man asks him what he wants. DareDevil replies 'Justice' to which he goes and attacks all the criminals.
It seems as though the director didn't try and steer the Marvel superhero franchise into any new direction (unlike Ang Lee) but instead just tried to capitalise on the success of Comic book heroes of late. With a movie named 'DareDevil', you'd think that they would try and do something daring to the actual franchise to at least differentiate itself from Spiderman. But it does nothing of a sort.
The screenplay is dismal, it has an unoriginal plot and really is just a filler for 99 minutes. Mark Steven Johnson tries to pull out some biblical allusions spliced with how the Law is juxtaposed to it. Johnson also tries to recreate the gothic setting that Burton used so well in Batman, though it just seems as though the production crew ran out of ideas.
One of my biggest qualms with this movie is that there is absolutely NO character development. It just jumps from one scene to the other and assumes the viewer knows what is going on both story wise and character wise. And CGI seems to be overused in this film, I mean honestly, to CGI a rat walking through a gutter is just taking it too far.
In summary, the DVD is good with a score of 8/10. The movie though is just bad. Plain out, a film that relied on its budget and franchise name to get viewers. It gets a 4/10.
Get the DVD for the features....not the film!",1058400000,,3414,4.53484602917342

Affleck and Garner fumble through every fight scene relying on editing to mask their ineptness. Just look at there playground confrontation, they are both sluggish and Affleck seems completely lost in the choreography.
Stick with HongKong films, they have being making superior action flicks for like the last three decades. If you can read comic books, then subtitles shouldn't be a problem.",1057708800,,699,4.882352941176471

The special features are excellent. My favourite is the hour long series of interviews with the various writers and artists who have worked on the comic since its creation in the 1960s. It was great to see artist Gene Colan have his say as I have been a fan of his work since the mid-1970s. Equally interesting are the interviews with Frank Miller, Kevin Smith, John Romita and his son John Jr (a really great guy who I had the pleasure of meeting in the early 1990s).
The obligatory making of documentary is well worth a look too, especially the early costume fittings and talk of uncertainty amongst studio executives about the look of Daredevil. Not the usual PR puff-piece and a good insight into the making of the film.
There are loads of other worthy features, and the film itself ain't too shabby either...so take my advice and order this film now, true believers! Excelsior!",1057622400,,1150,4.698019801980198
2277439,3,B0009B0GYA,"An awful lot of people spit blood. Even the hero wrenches a bloody loose tooth from his mouth after one bout of fisticuffs. Daredevil is an orthodontist's dream.

But for fans of the comic book, Daredevil is more of a nightmare. Conceived initially as an adult flick, the R rating was trimmed to PG-13 before hitting theaters -- but still, the movie that remains is darker and more brutal than I expected from the optimistic Marvel hero.

As is expected whenever Hollywood borrows a page from the comics, Daredevil is very different than his four-color counterpart. Filmmakers got the hypersenses right, but they also gave the hero the inexplicable agility, strength and acrobatic tendencies of last year's superhero blockbuster, Spider-Man. And, unlike the comic-book Daredevil, this one has fewer compunctions when it comes to killing bad guys. His moral code is shaky, his outlook cheerless. Director Mark Steven Johnson's take on Daredevil is meaner and moodier than Tim Burton's Batman.

Daredevil was never counted as one of Marvel's top comicbooks although it has been around for some 400 issues.  When the movie came out I wondered how Affleck would do as Daredevil, and to be honest he didn't let me down.  He was just dark enough to bring the feeling of angst and guilt to the audience but not so dark that he would come across as evil or crazy; he left that to the bad guys of the film.  Speaking of which, Duncan (Kingpin) and Ferrel (Bullseye) did a fantastic job!  The Kingpin had all the aura one would expect the leader of the mob to have and Bullseye was, well the psychopath that he was made to be in the comics.  And to add to all the fun, Garner (Electra) does hot, sexy, stunning and awesome all in one fell swoop.  I don't think anyone could have played Electra better.  Combine all of these terrific efforts with a decent story and some outstanding effects and it comes out as a comic book fans dream...a comicbook come to life for two hours.",1057449600,,1135,4.266355140186916

This year, we have had (or will have) ""X2,"" ""The Hulk,"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.""  But buried beneath them, is ""Daredeveil,"" a frenetic, eye-catching spectacle, but with enough heart and humor to help rise above it rumored shallowness.  Key to the movies' success is Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, who hits the right amount of brood and anger as ""The Man with no Fear.""  I would say that ""Daredevil"" reasserted my confidence in Affleck as a good actor.
As a boy, Matt Murdock is blinded by a chemical waste accident, but his other senses functioned at superhuman levels, more than making up for his lack of sight.  As a man, he is a determined lawyer representing the downtrodden in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York.  At night, he wages a secret war against crime as Daredevil, a red-leather clad superhero.  His new enemy is the rumored Kingpin (an imposing Michael-Clark Duncan), one man who controls all the crime in New York.  At his disposal, Kingpin has a legion of criminals, most dangerous is the gleefully evil Bullseye (a delicious Colin Farrel) who can turn any object into a lethal projectile.  Caught up in the middle is Elecktra (a beautiful Jennifer Garner) who develops a relationship with Murdock and her doomed father (Erik Avari).
Even though ""Daredevil"" is a satisfying action movie, it does leave room for improvement for its inevitable sequels.  The characters could use a little more development, and the story could use a little tightening.  Also, was the play-fight between Murdock and Elecktra in the playground necessary?  I don't know.  To me, it seemed a little shallow as it balantly goes for eye-filling candy, instead of a little substance.

But I was really disappointed.  There were a lot of good thing.  For instance, the movie did a very good job of showing you what Matt Murdock ""sees"".  It was also good to have the three main characters from the comic book in the storyline.  The Kingpin was portrayed faily well, Bullseye was WONDERFULLY done (he really hit the mark...), and Electra was okay (she didn't really seem to catch the spirit that the Electra from the comic book had).
But what killed me was how wrong they got the story.  When I saw how Matt went blind, all I could think was, ""Oh, no.  They couldn't have been more wrong!""  What, did they think that the original story was just too unbelievable or something?  I can see them discussing it now, ""You know, we've got Ben Affleck running around in rubber supposedly blind as a bat but able to do backflips and jump roof to roof with the greatest of ease.  But, come on, is anybody really going to believe that THIS is how he went blind?""  COME ON!!  If you are going to adapt a great story, how about sticking with what made it great.  More can be said on this, but they didn't take too many liberties with Spider-man, and look how well they did.
The story and plot didn't keep me too interested.  The emotion between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner didn't leave me convinced.  All in all, I wasn't that impressed with the movie.

Ben Affleck, Colin Farrell, and Michael Clarke Duncan all give wonderful performances that play on the characters perfectly. The only blemish is perhaps Jennifer Garner's character. She seemed kinda out of place in nearly every action scene. She did a fine job in the more sentimental scenes though, with feeling but without making it overpowering or sappy.
Her story of training under a different master every year is pathetic and the brief woman power non-victim speeches are kinda ridiculous. There's also a brief rage scene where the character seemed all but blind to the situation around her. She serves her purpose rather nicely in the film though, and it had me cheering they had the guts to write the role and the story right.
All in all this is a great superhero action flick with a darker side. Leaps and bounds above the horrible ranks of Spawn, yet not quite as good as X-Men. I'd say the darker, more realistic story and the lack of anything truly corny puts it slightly above Spiderman.

but there were a few gripes i had with DD,  I.E. he was gifted with super hearing/radar via chemical spill, but how do you explain him leaping from building to building he's not spiderman, hell he's not even captain america who is at least 5 times stronger and can withstand  landing from a high rofftop with less bruises, then there's gardner's silly dialogue when she faces off with the man without fear..""liar"". ok....
i didn't care much for her acting or lack thereof, micheal clark duncan proved that you can play a character regardless of race or creed as long as he does a respectable job at it and that he does.colin was MARVELous as bullseye. but his costume came straight out of st.marks pl near the new york's grenich village.
(geez, ok the original bullseye costume was a bit corny, but the leather look is reminiscent of THE CROW (BRANDON LEE)
Then there's the corny alternative soundtrack, i'm glad danny elfman didn't do the soundtrack because he's typecasted to score every superhero movie nowadays. but the songs  on DD was just to [weak]?)
however the fight scence's were great except for the final confrontation with the kingpin. it left much to be desired.

And many people went to see the movie with high expectations because of the amazing job done with the Spider-Man movie and seemed disappointed by this darker tale of vengence and justice.  And while the performance of Ben Affleck does somewhat leave something to be desired, the end product (thanks to the vision and passion of director Mark Steven Johnson) is well worth watching.  Like X-Men before it, Daredevil is partially hamstrung by setting up the characters for the audience, leaving less screen time for the antagonists (and in particular Colin Farrell who does a dead-on Bullseye).  But the back story is important to set the stage for the true lesson being learned by our protagonist; namely, the difference between vigilante and hero lies in the difference between vengence and justice.  And what better character to learn this through than a lawyer, tasked with placing justice above all, even at the expence of vengence.  Yes, the movie has its flaws and slip-ups, but the characters are true to their comic book roots, the character interactions are handled well, the romance played with the proper amount of tragedy, our hero learns his lesson (and truly rises to the ranks of ""hero""), and best of all, at the end of the day, the players are all in position for the next chapter in the drama.

So what do they do?  They go out and hire pretty boy, Ben Affleck to play this role.
Jennifer Garner as Elecktra.  GEE DO YOU THINK SHE GOT THE ROLE BECAUSE SHE'S HOT?  'Nuff said.
Colin Farrell was the main highlight (not much competition) of this flick.  He was unstable and deadly.  Michael Clarke Duncan was a bad choice for Kingpin.  Although he's a good actor, Kingpin IS NOT BLACK.  Sorry, folks, but he just wasn't convincing in this role.
The plot was promising, especially at the beginning, but the action sequences just don't compare to the Matrix/Star Wars/Lord Of the Rings/Hulk movies as of late.

The direction was such that one might believe Mark Steven Johnson is himself blind.  The acting was laughable, with the exception of Colin Farrel, and the see-gee-eye was par at best.  But what really struck me was the writing.  I once met a rabid squirrel with seven different brain disorders who could have put together a better story than this.

It wasn't that Mark Steven Johnson wasn't loyal to it or just made a bad movie, but it was the relative mediocrity/obscurity of the Daredevil comic book.  For the fans of Daredevil, myself included, this movie was perfect.  It plays exactly like an issue of the comic book.  Exactly.  In fact, Mark Steven Johnson set up many of the movie's scenes to look exactly like panels from the comic.  My contention is that Daredevil's script was somewhat intentionally written with cliches, because it is written much like an issue of Daredevil.  Unfortunately, like the comic book, the movie is now experiencing obscurity.  Did you ever wonder why you'd never heard about the Daredevil sueprhero?  Well, now you know after seeing this movie.  Rest assured, though, if you have an appreciation for comic book superheroes, you'll find the intrigue of Daredevil.  I find the conflict of his blindness and his super powers an interesting angle, but it is not enough to maintain the movie for those who do not care so much about the hero.  The action is great, the effects are pretty good, and the actors are excellent.  Particularly Colin Farrell, who pulls off a perfect, and especially entertaining version of Bullseye.

Yes, the characters, story arcs and even some of his powers have been altered for unknown reasons, but if you watch it for what it is, it's pretty good.  No where near the statis of Spider Man, or Xmen (1 or 2), or I suspect even as good as the upcoming Hulk.  But Daredevil was never a wholly mainstream book and it's readers were not always faithful.  Changing writers made the books appeal dip up and down like a rollercoaster.  In turn the cutural consequences of messing with the character didn't carry the weight that it would if characteristics were changed for Spider Man or Xmen.  I liked the movie as a whole, but some aspects were foolishly changed and I cannot understand why.  It's action packed, the chemistry between Garner and Affleck is good, but not great.  Affleck actually plays the character well, and accuratly.  It's strange that with his hollywood status, and his well known liking of the character, that he let this inconsistancy happen.

2277471,1,B0009B0GYA,"Quite possibly the worst adaptation, of any medium, in film.
Many have claimed that this version of Daredevil is, in fact, a true depiction of the character.  This, more than anything else, is an insult to one of the few complex characters Marvel has managed to produce.  Although there were a number of scenes that were taken straight from the comics, ala Spider-Man, unlike said movie the spirit of the character was lost.
For those of you that are not familiar with the character, Matt Murdock is a New York lawyer granted heightened senses and a ""radar sense"" from the accident that left him blinded.  Dedicated to an ideal of justice, Daredevil struggles in a hopeless battle - to effect change within his own microcosm, the section of New York known popularly as Hell's Kitchen.  In such a hopeless situation Murdock lives purely from his ethics, an unshakable belief in the legal system and a faith in man's ability for redemption.  He adopts the guise of the devil to remind man what waits for him if he doesn't change his ways and even after stopping criminals he defends them in court - to ensure they recieve fair treatment, even if they're the worst murderers, rapists and scoundrels.
Although the character has lapses in this unrealistic ideology as he's constantly barraged with proof of the meaninglessness of his struggle, the corruption of the legal system and the crumbling of his personal life, he heroically continues to strive for a better world.  The archetypical struggle of man's ethics vs. his enviroment.
Now, let's face the reality of this movie.  Matt Murdock is a prosecuting attorney that, when he can't win a case against criminals he knows are guilty, murders them.  He's motivated by a hatred for the ""scum"" who run the streets and is a cold, passionless man who hides out in his secret headquarters waiting to gain revenge on his enemies.
...  Is this what I waited years for?  The acting is dismal, a supporting cast of complex characters reduced to one-dimensional laugh-offs and senseless violence.  Some of comic's best scribes (include Miller, Nocenti and Bendis) have spent years creating a symbol for Everyman, and we get this.  ...",1054598400,,2173,4.875

What blind guy can balance on a pole on a rooftop, or fight kung-fu in a public park? Realistc? get a dictionary!) But neither here nor there, the thing that, for me, really made this movie, was Collin Farrel's portrayal of Bullseye. He was so darn cool. He drank a lot, killed people without a second thought, heck, this is the first movie where Collin lets his true Irish accent show, and it works perfectly with the image of this obnoxious punk/rebel who happens to have a great arm/aim. Basically all the scenes with him (except when he's throwing glass at DD, that was too repetitive and reminiscent of SM), and especially the ones between him & Kingpin, were pretty funny, and really cool. So in summary, if they were to put Bullseye in his own movie, or at least a better movie (perhaps the next Spider-Man?) the movie would rule all, because he is what makes this movie at least enjoyable.",1054512000,,1221,4.529411764705882

A year before, millions of people worldwide embraced the film ""Spiderman."" While Spidy's film was, in itself, quite good, it had a different atmosphere altogether. The mood fit the comic's style and story. Unfortunately, with a hero like Daredevil, the general 'comic fan' is unaware of the mood of the DD comics - dark, gritty, and ultimately quite realistic. I loved comics as a kid, and one of the books I had a subscription to was Daredevil. I liked the fact that although he was a good guy, he played by his own rules. DD would rather kill the bad guy than bring him into the cops like Spiderman would. This fact turned off a large number of viewers who were looking for another Spiderman-esque kid-friendly film. The sadthing is that the viewer is treated to the most faithful comic book adaptation since Tim Burton's magnificent ""Batman"" film. The only thing about this film that I didn't like was the choice of its villian. True Bullseye was a good choice, and Colin Farrell did the character justice, I would have rather seen the film focus on the Kingpin...or even Typhoid Mary, my personal fav DD bad guy. Regardless, the film is an amazing introduction to those unfamiliar with the DD universe(believe me there are quite a few!), and hopefully will spawn a GOOD franchise. This might be one that the kids who loved Spiderman want to stay away from - the film is dangerously close to an 'R' rating with its dark violence.",1054425600,,1598,4.690391459074733

Colin Farrell is terrific as Bullseye; he knows that fans of the book, as few as there are, as well as illiterates who read less than the contents on their Happy Meal box need to see a well-rounded character. He delivers. Jennifer Garner is hot stuff. TVs ALIAS chick can kick the [stuffing] out of DD, but in this terrible, terrible condensed cream of comics, Frank Miller (who cameoed in Bullseyes bar scene) should have beaten the writers with the stupid stick; there is no character progression for Elektra at all. The character, no fault of Garners excellent look and portrayal, is cut to minutes, not years, of face time. What the [creators] at 20th Century Fox and Regency Films SHOULD have done was to develop her alias alongside of DD from minute one, but they were probably jonesin for their own cashcow like Spider-Man.
Alas, too many kooks spoil the sloth: lazy writing and too many whacky characters cut this down way, way too much. Superficial and with less depth than a Rolaids commercial, try as I may as an old DD reader, I didn't hate it, I was bored by it, and thats worse.
Ben Affleck looks the part and does a [heck] of a job as Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil, but we never can figure out what exactly he can see and what he cant: in the comics, DD could read ink on a page and had sonar-like abilities. Affleck has some of that and none of the other; not his fault, just...a writing team who should have received a remedial course in writing effective narrative. There are so many... unexplained element s...of DDs life that we wonder who the nimrod was who thought that this was brilliant... and why.
THE CGI was dismal stuff: even a sleepy kid in the back of the theater could have caught the same Daredevil moves twice, and they pretty much [stunk]: cmon guys, not even Jackie Chan can run across buildings like that. And howd DD get all of those powers from a can of toxic waste instead of the original truck full of radioactive materials? And howd DD get those cool weapons? And if DD really could move like that, he didn't get hit much, so howd he get all of those scars on his back and only a little shmear around the eyes? The back scars are lifted, thats right: [borrowed] from Alex Ross artwork for the book BATMAN: WAR AGAINST CRIME in which we see Bruce Wayne undressing after a night as Batman and we see his scarred back: same scene, different medium.
The CGId cityscape is flat. Everybody seems to know that blind Matt is really DD except Foggy Nelson, his law partner.
Marvel references: Kevin Smith as a coroner; Stan Hairplugs Lee as an old guy about to cross the street, Matts boxer dad goes up against John Romita, artist for Marvels best years and Matt goes to trial against a guy named Quesada which is all cute and good for a wink among comic geeks but one too many references to the new old boys club.
Bringing X-Men to the screen worked, so did Spider-Man, but not the Golan-Globus CAPTAIN AMERICA or some of the other quickly-buried comic book adaptations. It seems almost oxymoronic that a multimillion dollar movie could be based on a 12, 24-page pulpy series of pictures, but for a nation that paid to see KANGAROO JACK and JACKASS: THE MOVIE no better is apparently needed, but it sure would be appreciated.",1054339200,,3464,4.570739549839228

Personally, I didn't like the movie from the lead actor on down. For me the only bright spot was Collin Farrell and Michael Duncan's characters who acted with the type of over the top emotion that is needed for the way the movie felt. It really made Affelck's minimalist acting stick out all the more.
Yes, it tried to have a dark, brooding approach to itself, but it failed miserably mostly because of Affleck's minimalist acting. I do like him as an actor, but the role required someone harder and with a greater range of believable emotion. When he acts an emotion in this movie, you SEE him acting it. One of my favorite acting quotes is from James Dean. ""Don't act like your drinking a drink. Drink the drink."" In almost every scene it seemed like he was ACTING with someone, and not there doing the things himself.
And to those that say it sticks closely to the comic, I'm going to point these facts out. Matt Murdock was a GOOD lawyer in the comics. The way it's portrayed is that he acts as the Daredevil because he isn't a good lawyer. Not to mention the fact that he never questions himself in the comics (this Daredevil asks ""Why me?"" so many times you start wondering yourself if he should be doing this). I could get more into the innaccuracies, but I won't. It was a special effects movie, plain and simple. If you're looking for good acting, look else where.
In all, A for effort, but it falls very short as far as the lead character goes. When you can feel wheels turning in the actor's head, it makes the movie long and tedious.",1053388800,,1620,4.403333333333333
2277494,2,B0009B0GYA,"DAREDEVIL is a film that needed a lot of fixing up. One of the main and most interesting characters gets the kicked out the picture half way through. Conceptually it kept close to the original comic but it lacked the story. The film's visual style was also a little confusing in parts. It is one of those films that tells the origins by starting with an event at the beginning that isn't explained until the end. Very disappointing when you realize it was nothing special.
Directed by Mark Stephen Johnson (Jack Frost, Ghostrider) the film is a little slow and dark in the beginning. The story doesn't start to get interesting until the main temptress played by Jennifer Garner (Pearl Harbor, Catch Me If You Can) shows up and has some great fighting sequences.
The most interesting character is Collin Farrell (S.W.A.T., Phone Booth) interpretation as Bullseye. He is exciting and evil and really seems to be the only one who is having fun in the film. He is energetic and exciting.
The story is that of the making of the Vigilante known as Daredevil. The beginnings are shallow and short and the accident not really explained much and the father is played by David Keith (Office And A Gentlemen, Firestarter) who gives a short but meaningful performance.
Now as for Ben Afflect (Sum of All Fears, Pearl harbor, Armageddon) as Daredevil, he was week. He was more interesting as the alter-ego Matt Murdock. Even that was a a little shallow.

I don't like to be insulted about my intelligence but a 13 year old blind kid jumping roof to roof to train himself to be a super hero was a little to ridiculous for me!!!! I know people can't fly like Superman or climb walls like Spider-Man but the scenes with the kid doing all those stunts on the roof was just a little to much stupidity for me to handle,yet some of the action was pretty cool. I definitely liked the fact that they got Michael Clarke Duncan to play King Pin, I couldn't think of anyone else to cast for that role, but some hardcore fans of Daredevil disliked the fact that King Pin was a black guy in the film since all the years king Pin has been white in the comic books and cartoons, but sometimes it's good to have changes.

I would recommend to add this film to your DVD collection and i would also recommend to go and watch it in the theater just not with your hopes high thinking it's going to be the best Comic Book movie of the year!!",1052611200,,1570,4.219269102990033
2277508,3,B0009B0GYA,"out of all the comic movies coming out, daredevil ranks about half way.  it is a very entertaining movie with some really cool moments.  the down side to the movie is its far fetched aspects.  i know this is a comic book movie, but you have to understand that the characters of this comic book are all human and have no special or mutant powers.  daredevil's enhanced senses make sense because he is blind and everyone knows that all other senses become keener when one is lost.  the story is a good one and has its interesting elements.  affleck does not disappoint, and does a good job, not great but good.  jennifer garner does a great job and fills elektra's shoes very well.  she has a great presence and has the right attitude for the role.  the real standout is colin farrel. (i can never spell his name right.)  he anils bullseye to almost perfection.  to me it does not seem like much of a stretch for him to play that type of character considering his personality in real life.  however, i really don't care because i feel that he is one of the best actors to come along in a very long time.  he has charissma to spare and has the acting chops to back it up.  michael clarke duncan does make his presence known, but for a man his size, its hard not to make his presence known.  but any man of size could have played that role, so he does not garner a lot on attention.  like i said, daredevil was good, but the fact that at the end of the movie charcters start jumping distance and scaling walls that are not humanly possible are the only real detractors to the story.  the action is great and the fight scenes are worth going to see the movie or at the very least rent it.  i recommend this movie but not strongly, its good for a friday night watch.  but i am still torn as to whether i will buy it on dvd or not.  who knows.",1052611200,,1836,4.206303724928366
2277509,3,B0009B0GYA,"Enough has been said concerning the movie, we are quite familiar with male super heroes, and this one was very good. But I would agree with other reviews concerning the heroine in the picture. They had a gold mine with her as this character. The part was perfect for this actress. Very few female heroes look totally convincing as butt kickers. But this one blew me away. She really looked as though she could take on any man. It was totally refreshing to see the addition of this character to the story. I was really prepared to be blown away with the rest of the story. The romance was to quick I thought but then I thought this is not really a love story. The chemistry between the 2 was very noticable right from the beginning. Even when he was totally beaten in a fight scene with the main bad guy, the last words she said to him made you believe that she was here to stay. ""NOT"" she comes to his rescue in a very convincing display of martial arts and bravado and is quickly dispatched in a very abrupt untimely end. My whole adrenalin rush just took a nose dive. Why even bring her character into the picture to begin with. They literally had a gold mine with Electra. The perfect compliment to a blind super hero. She had the looks the body the costume of a great female super hero. I saw another Sigourney Weaver emerging in her character. I gave this movie a 3 only because the action and effects were top notch. The storyline had a lot to be desired. What could have been an excellent movie is now only ranked as mediochre.",1052524800,,1534,4.329861111111111
2277510,4,B0009B0GYA,"""Daredevil"" is AWESOME if you like the comic, but it doesn't shut out those that just want to see the newest Affleck, J. Garner, or Farrell pic, either.  The film does a decent enough job of showing DD's origin without dwelling on it (i.e. EVERY Batman film), though adding training by Stick would have been a nice touch.  Affleck is very convincing as a blind man. Farrell does a great job with Bullseye, really playing him over the top.  Jennifer Garner holds her own in the fight scenes, and looks AMAZING from start to finish.
DRAWBACKS:  too many people know Matt Murdock is DD by the end of the film, the Affleck-Garner relationship develops too quickly, Kingpin's character is thrown at us and not introduced or developed enough, and some of the DD/Bullseye sequences are too obvious in the use of computer generation (climbing the organ pipes looks like a playstation game).
ON THE PLUS SIDE:  Affleck, Farrell, Jon Favreau, KEVIN SMITH!!, and Joey P. straight outta the Sopranos into a great reporter role.  Loyal readers of the DD comic will recognize several shots right out of the comic book which added to the movie's appeal for my friends & me.
Overall, you will enjoy this movie if you like the genre, but you'll love it if you read the comic. GREAT DIRECTION!!!!  I just want to know how they'll pull off the sequel since all of Hell's Kitchen knows who DD is now????",1052524800,,1383,4.64344262295082

The film is true to the spirit of the comic, and interpreted very well to suit live-action.  The effects are cool and convey the hero's world well.  It's a good choice if you like action movies with a bit of humor.
Some have complained that it is too dark.  What do you expect from a movie about a blind vigilante working in Hell's Kitchen and motivated by vengeance?  It is a little dark...and amen.
If there is a weak point, it would probably be in the performances.  Although all of the characters are portrayed fairly well there was room for improvement for each of the actors in the film.  It seemed fairly obvious that Ben Affleck was a tad uncomfortable with an action role, and Jennifer Garner's action/drama boundaries weren't really pushed--after all she does action scenes weekly.  Colin Ferrell played his character a little over the top, but he wasn't really given enough screen-time to properly develop his character, so...
If you like comic/action movies you might get a real kick out of Daredevil.  If you want absolute realism and high-drama, buy the Pianist.",1052179200,,1107,4.778947368421052

Okay he's strong, how'd he get so strong?
DareDevil has developed other senses ok cool, but he's a regular guy so now he's suddenly a great gymnast with super-strength??? Now I know you're not supposed to look for much plot in these movies but you gotta have some better action than that to distract me. Last thing, Nobody's going to bother to explain why Bullseye has a Bullseye on his head huh?

2277513,4,B0009B0GYA,"I agree with the loyal Daredevil comic book fans who say this movie is only a commercial tribute to the blind Superhero. The Daredevil character on film is only slightly related to the powerful comic book hero. This is unfortunate because the non-comic book fans would think the two characters are the same. I admit it is difficult to create the complexity of comic book heroes in only two hours. For the film maker, what needs to be done in two hours is make a profit. If the profits are good then a sequel will follow. To do this there is nothing like exploiting a successful Marvel comic book action hero like Daredevil.
If the movie Daredevil is compared independently of the comic book Daredevil character then I would have to admit that the movie was worth it. Jennifer Garner made this movie worthwhile with a look, which can only be described as ""dangerously sexy."" I am not surprised that her character, Electra, is being given her own starring role in an upcoming movie.
The movie is visually dark but still stunning at times. In some cases the scenes were a bit too dark and some might even say depressing. The darkness is in keeping with the comic book feel but certainly not the depression.
This movie is worth a look and even a DVD purchase but it is not the classic that I hoped it would have been.",1051574400,,1313,4.497907949790795

And after seeing critics divided, and audiences divided, I have come to believe that this is one misunderstood film.  I think that many came to it thinking it was going to be like Spider-man (blame Fox marketing).  But, thankfully, the filmmakers clearly had a lot more on their mind.  Instead, Daredevil gives us the world of the superhero.  What it would really be like to devote your life to fighting crime.  It's dark and unflinching.

This could show the director of spider-man what to do in it's upcoming sequal.
 I gave this movie four stars because it has raised the bar for all other marvel comic to movie productions that will take place.

Speaking of powers, Daredevil only has heightened senses, not the ability to jump from a skyscraper and land feet-first without becoming the Human Accordion.

What a great cast it has. I watched this film at Village cinemas southland with my mum and my little brother and i enjoyed it alot.
The film is about young Matt Murdock has just learned a horrible truth. His father Jack is not the man he thought and the discovery wounds him deeply. It also spurs a terrible accident where the young man is doused with radioactive waste.
The disaster leaves Matt blind, but his other senses develop a superhuman acuity; his newly acquired 'radar' allows him to 'see' in ways no other can.

Its one of those rare comic vehicles that attracted the cream of the crop: from Frank Miller to Harlan Ellison. It is still a great read, but how is the film compared to the comic? Well, it is so-so. Ben Affleck did a decent job as Matt Murdoch, the costume looked good, but the character who played Electra did a poor job (I forget her name).
  Colin Farrell stole the show (as expected) as Bullseye; the fight scenes were OK but some of them were poorly filmed, the lighting was insufficient and you couldn't really tell what was going on. However the movie was pretty faithful to the original comic story. I say ""original"" because none of the Frank Miller storyline was used: Matt's mentor, Stick, or the Hand. That was disappointing but the storyline focusing on Daredevil's origin and his father was compelling.
  Will they make a sequel? Probably, the producers should make one, maybe next time they'll have Frank Miller help with the script.",1050537600,,1054,4.650537634408602

The casting, the storyline, and the photography is all very well done here, and the soundtrack deserves some praise too. Ben Affleck plays the darkest and most fascinating comic book character ever brought to the silver screen!  As a matter of fact, his character is so dark and complex that it's hard to refer to Daredevil as an actual ""super hero"".  That's what helps this movie so much... It isn't sugar-coated for the kids, it's actually more for the parents if you ask me.  The reason I decided to give it a full 5 star rating is because it's the kind of movie you can enjoy over and over again.  Ebert and Roeper gave TWO THUMBS UP!!

Daredevil was a great surprise to me. To begin with, I'm not a fan of Daredevil, Ben Affleck, nor Jennifer Garner. Not that their stuff bores me, it's just I'm not big fans of their work. Daredevil changed that.

 The story is simple. Murdock is a blind guy who has enhanced all of his abilities through his handicap. He uses these abilities to revenge the death of his father by giving justice to the city he lives in. When he meets Elektra, a new sort of justice comes into play.

 Our leads give a fantastic performance and their chemistry was awesome. The rooftop kiss in the rain scene is - in my opinion - one of the best kiss scenes. Colin Farrel gives a hoot of a performance as a co-villian and Michael Clarke Duncan rocks as usual.

 The action in this movie is high. There are a number of great fight scenes and action sequences. A bunch of adrenaline here.

 I only have one complaint with this movie, and it seemed it moved too fast at times. I need a little bit more character development (partially with Elektra) for me. But other than . . .

 Daredevil was a fun adrenaline-filled movie with the right amount of a side love story to settle it.",1050364800,,1411,4.388461538461539
2277523,4,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil is my first superhero film. No, I didn't see X-Men, Batman, or Spiderman, but from the moment I read the synopsis of Daredevil, it was the only choice for me. I come from the school of tortured souls: Louis from Interview With the Vampire, Nick Knight from Forever Night, Father Kiernan from Stigmata. I want my hero to be both powerful and remorseful. Daredevil is both.
Blinded as a child by a freak accident, Matt Murdock's other four senses are hypersensitive. As an adult, Matt is a pro bono lawyer in Hell's Kitchen, but despite his best efforts, his clients don't get justice. By night Matt dons a red leather costume complete with horns and doles out the deserved justice to rapists, murderers and thugs. But he is a tortured soul and seeks spiritual relief in a nearby church, the priest being one of the few that knows of his dual identity as Daredevil.
Matt views his gifts as more of a curse: tormented by the extreme noise of the everyday, he sleeps in a sealed chamber. His cupboard is stocked with Vicodin and assortment of painkillers. His body is covered with scars, showing all too well that he is only human. And his life gets more complicated when he meets the beautiful (yet lethal) Elektra. Both Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner bring chemistry and believability to their roles, and there is definitely onscreen chemistry between the two. Matt's faith is tested as he is faced with losing everone and everything he's ever loved at the hands of Kingpin; it's a bitter fight to the finish.
The storytelling is at times disjointed, the camera work seizure inducing (made me think of MTVesque Stigmata), the music an ear splitting blend of rock, alternative, and Rob Zombie. The visual and stunt work is incredible, with superhuman leaps, suspended kicks, and weapon trajectories (never knew that paper clips could be lethal weapons, did you?). There are moments of dark humour, most provided by pottymouthed Colin Farrell as Bullseye and Jon Favreau as Matt Murdock's sidekick. Sadly, the love story between Elektra and Matt didn't really play out much, and the film is short (103 min.). I found the ending unsatisfying, although it obviously sets up a sequel. In spite of a few hiccups along the way, Daredevil is one heck of a wild ride.",1050278400,,2267,4.785714285714286

The script is so poor and redundant it may aswell not be there. You could watch this movie with ear muffs and know exactly whats happening, which i probably recommend anyway since you won't have to hear the teen metal ridden soundtrack either. So anyway, Ben Affleck is Matt murdoch, a blind man who gains super human senses as a kid when radioactive waste is splashed over his face (how original). Other than being a superhero, he is also a kind hearted lawyer, which is ridiculous as his daredevil persona is a ruthless killer, although he keeps reassuring himself that he is ""not the bad guy"". This brings up the moral dilemma of does revenge = justice? who cares? The story doesn't flow very well at all. Characters almost force thier way into the lack luster script. There is absolutely no development of King Pin who has about 3 scenes in the whole movie, even though he is responsible for nearly all the crime in the city and also murdochs fathers death. Elektra played by Jennifer Garner is Murdochs love interest, and also becomes a ninja fighting superhero to exact revenge for her fathers death. And then theres Collin Farrel who overacts as the crazy Irish assassin Bullseye, who throws projectiles with deadly precision, and doesn't seem very scarey at all. The movie only really gets going after Bullseye is hired by King Pin to kill Elektra's father. We see lots of over the top computer generated fight scenes between daredevil and bullseye and you could probably guess the rest of it. All the events in this movie are tied together in a shallow and haphazard manner and the storyline plays more like a backdrop to the fighting scenes.

2277539,4,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil was a good action movie although I did expect more and for it to be better then Spiderman.  When we take one look at this movie, we wonder; Why is Spidey better?  After all this movie has a cooler hero, a more realistic story, a much hotter chick, but you want to know why Spiderman is better- BECAUSE SPIDERMAN HAD A PLOT AND THIS MOVIE DIDN'T.  All this movie was a 1hr full of memories and then 30 minutes of him battling bad guys and that is it.  Usually the bad guys would have some big plan for domination or just to mess with good guys mind but this movie didn't have any of that.  The only time Daredevil had a conflict with Kingpin was at the end.  And not only that, the hot chick Electra didn't get alot of action in this movie.  Anyway, here is what I can make of the plot.
When Matt Murdock was a child he was accidently blinded when some chemicals hit eyes.  But after that incident: he managed to gain some super radar sense and was known to be fearless.  After taking advantage of this gift he was able to have less chances of getting hit by a car then a person who is not blind.  His father was a pro boxer who swore to make it the top after Matt was blinded and fought his way to beome champ.  But it seems that Matt's dad was expected to lose on purpose in his match against the champ but refused and was murdered by a mysterous man.  When Matt grew up he had become a lawyer but during night he had some other thing to do-become Daredevil.  Both Attorney Matt Murdock and Daredevil fight for one thing- justice.  If things do not go perfect in court, then Daredevil will make sure that things change.  That is how things go for matt and a reproter named Ben Urich tries to get the inside story on this daredevil and somehow finds out who daredevil is without reasonable explaination.  Then Matt's life may start to change when he meets a women, Elektra, and they boith grow to fall in love.  And then later, Kingpin wants to have electra killed and Daredevil just gets in his way.  That is pretty much it.  Sounds nuts.
So that is pretty much of what I think the plot may be.  Overall this movie is OK and I would've given 3.5 stars if possible but I wouldn't have given it 3 cuz that it too low.",1049241600,,2226,4.18075117370892

Full marks to Joe Pantoliano, Jon Favreau, the boy who plays our hero's younger self, Colin Farrell (though he could stand to cut out the overacting) and especially Jennifer Garner.

2277542,5,B0009B0GYA,"There are a lot of people, including myself, who hold their breath each time a comic book film comes out.  We all remember how the recent Batman series turned into a big joke, and eventually died out about two films too late.  If the same thing happens to the most recent wave of Marvel-character films, it would be a big tragedy.  Some of us have been waiting all of our lives for these characters to be portrayed correctly on screen.
Well, with ""Daredevil"", we now have three extra-base hits in a row after ""X-Men"" and ""Spiderman'.  And the scenes to X-Men II look very promising.  An I've got my hopes high that ""The Incredible Hulk"" might even take it to a new level.  The current proprietors of Marvel deserve a standing ovation for insisting that the true spirit, and most of the rules regarding the characters are strictly kept.  In some ways, ""Daredevil"" may be the best of the bunch so far.
Possibly the best part of the movie is that it does not dumb it down in any way.  In my opinion, the accelerated dumbing-down of the Batman and Superman movies were the biggest reason they died out.  By taking the attitude that these were basically stories for kids, the greatly underestimated the intelligence of the audiences.
The people who have filmed the Marvel heroes have figured out that the people who spent their childhoods with these characters have now grown up.  Yes, there remains a childlike innocence, but there literally are millions of people who take these stories as seriously as anything in movies, and they don't like it when what they like is messed with.  ""Daredevil"" presents a pretty bleak world, where the bad guys seem to win more often than the good guys, and good guys do get killed.  Yes, we know Daredevil will live to fight another day, but he pays a big price along the way.
And Ben Affleck is back on my good list again after a decent performance as Jack Ryan, and a perfect one here.  If I don't watch myself, I may actually start thinking that Hollywood might occasionally care about putting out a good product once in awhile",1048636800,,2062,4.570652173913044
2277543,3,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil, the first taste of the blitz of comic book adaptation to hit the big screens this year, X-Men 2, Hulk and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen are all on the way.  Of all those four films this was probably the one that I was the least excited about, but still being a die hard comic fan I had to go and catch it on the opening weekend (well here in Australia anyway).
I think a lot of the other appraisals here on Amazon pretty many sums up my views on the pros and cons of this movie.  Firstly the story once again sticks pretty close to the actual comic story, which is always a plus for comics fans.  It gives you good grounding on the origins of the characters, well except maybe Elektra's which deviates slightly from the comic book cannon, an understanding of Daredevil's motivations and what drives him to do what he does.  Marvel obviously wants this movie to spin off into a franchise  (Jennifer Garner has already signed on for the Electra sequel) and Daredevil definitely gave you the right mix of satisfying story and unresolved plot lines / opportunities to expand on plot that a believable sequel should be easy to develop.  Just like a good comic book issue / story line this movie's story is very episodic in nature allowing for most of the major players to return in the future.
The movie is also peppered with enough comic cameos (Stan Lee & Kevin Smith) and enough name dropping of famous Daredevil creators (Frank Miller, John Romita, David Mack & Joe Quesada) to give comic fans a rye smile.
A lot of people have been hard on the dialogue and performances in this film, I can't understand why.  The interaction between Matt Murdoch and Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson has some great moments and really serves as a great counterpoint to dark and moody action sequences dominated by Matt's alter-ego.  Michael Clark Duncan delivers a stylish, imposing and intimidating performance as Kingpin and Colin Farrell brings just the right amount of psycho madman to Bullseye.  And of course Jennifer Garner is perfect as Elektra.
Graeme (the Crow) Revell's score really adds great depth and establishes the mood and texture of the film as well.
I do agree with some of the criticism about the fight scenes and effects sequences in the film.  There are just too many of them!  How many shots do we need to see of a rainy, gloomy Gothic Hells Kitchen skyline?  When it comes to the fight scenes, there's only so many times you can see some one do a kick flip or some other wire stunt before the novelty wears off.  The action sequences could have had much more impact without all the unnecessary bullet-time effects and snap close ups and tracking shots.
Overall this movie is a great high action, ""dark"" hero story more in the line of say Blade or The Crow than Xmen or Spiderman but it's still a great piece of escapism if you want an enjoyable, no brain action movie.",1048550400,,2880,4.590643274853801
2277554,3,B0009B0GYA,"Based on the MARVEL comic book series, DAREDEVIL is a visually stunning adaption, but it lacks the good-natured fun of the recent CB movies like X-MEN and SPIDER-MAN. Mixed reviews haven't dampened it's commercial output however, seeing the latest film in the long string of superhero movies being one of the more succesful. Directed by Mark Steven Johnson, Daredevil centres around a young boy who loses his sight in an accident. Ben Affleck plays the title hero who uses his other over-developed senses to fight criminals. Whereas Tobey Maguire was perfect for the role of Spiderman, Affleck fares less well, playing a visually-impared superhero. The villians including the up-and-coming Colin Farrell who does an excellent job as the lethal Bullseye. Michael Clark Duncan does little more than order people around and while Jennifer Garner (Elektra) provides eye candy but little else.

2277555,3,B0009B0GYA,"""Daredevil"" can stand its ground in the teen-action market with ludicrously choreographed fight sequences, an ear-flaying soundtrack, and a visual style boasting more flair and realism than ""Spider-Man"". But when it comes to plot, characterization and the inevitable love interest, it's an entirely different story. Or, rather, it isn't one. And that's a problem. Hamstrung by repetitve romantic and 'character' scenes, the plot never gets off the ground. While this may have been a deliberate choice - a movie-length Act 1 to an endless series of sequels - it just isn't interesting. Rather than coming up with a character-establishing adventure which is thrilling in its own right (as Brian Singer did so well in ""X-Men""), writer/director Mark Steven Johnson opts for a more schematic, episodic approach, yoking it all together with tenuous motivations and a ponderous explanatory voiceover. Perhaps aiming for a broader demographic than under-25 males, romance is over-emphasised at the expense of the edgier, darker undercurrents which could have been more interestingly explored. But maybe that wouldn't have helped. For me, there's always something a little silly about these comic book superheroes violently working through their childhood traumas. It works on the page, but on the screen it feels false: perhaps increased fidelity to visual reality demands the same at the emotional level. Ironically, without the antidote of much deliberate humour (used to great effect in ""Spider-Man"") we end up laughing anyway. As he so often is in other roles, Ben Affleck is spectacularly unconvincing as Murdock/Daredevil. Jennifer Garner makes an appealing heroine as Elektra, so it's a shame she won't be back. Colin Farrell as Bullseye finally gets to release the inner Irish wildman the tabloids keep telling us about, and is the only one who seems to be having fun. Michael Clarke Duncan booms his way through another scary-big-guy performance as the utterly superfluous villain (can anyone even remember what he wanted?). And John Favreau? I just pray he packed on the pounds for the role.",1048204800,,2093,5.345454545454546

Yes it is dark, and some viewers won't get it, but this is a superhero movie not another Citizen Kane(overated, but good). After the success of Spider-Man, Daredevil was destined for runner-up status. Darker than Spider-man (and has better special effects), this $80 million extravaganza was packaged for maximum global appeal, its the plot beginning when 12-year-old Matt Murdock who is accidentally blinded shortly before his father is murdered. Later an adult attorney in New York's Hell's Kitchen, Murdock uses his remaining, superenhanced senses to battle crime as Daredevil, the masked and vengeful ""man without fear,"" pitted against dominant criminal Kingpin and the psychotic Bullseye, who can turn almost anything into a deadly projectile.

But once this movie got itself into the main plot with all the DD character staples it was just great. The movie went by in no time and I found myself wanting to see it again, which is abnormal for me. While it may not be as good as Spider-man, if only for its slow beginning, this film is easily one of the most fun I've seen for a long time.",1047686400,,562,3.8119658119658117
2277559,3,B0009B0GYA,"OK--so there was X-Men, Spiderman, and now, Daredevil, the blind superhero who has an enhanced sense of his surroundings due to biochemical material splashed inside him.  When the future hero's father, a boxer on a comeback, defies orders to take a fall, he is killed, and from then on, Matthew becomes a fighter for justice, basing his costume on his father's red cape and his nickname of ""devil.""  Costume-wise, think of Batman in a brick red outfit, with a cane that has a grapple attachment.
By day, Matthew Murdock becomes a struggling lawyer whose kindheartedness is causing a cash-flow problem.  He took a whole bunch of fluke from a Chinese merchant whose case he won, and that drives his partner crazy.  By night, he is Daredevil.
So, as this is the era of CGI and digital technology, in what areas is this used?  Answer:  the glowing blue outlined forms that serve as Daredevil's perceptions of his surroundings.  That works best when we see his view of Elektra, the daughter of billionaire Nikolaos Natchios who is about to be set up by the villainous Kingpin, the city's crime boss.
As much as I liked Ben Affleck in Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Good Will Hunting, he fails to plow any new ground here.  Jennifer Warnes as Elektra--she's the one to watch, playing a tough, hard-edged beauty who shows moments of charm when it's brought to the surface.  The scene of their martial arts demo in the playground is supposed to make the viewer go ""Ooh!"" but so what?  And Colin Farrell  as Bullseye would be more enjoyable if he didn't look so much like Andre Agassi.  His response to an irritating airline passenger is laudable, however.  Michael Clarke Duncan plays the Kingpin with a menacing edge, made so with his bass voice and enormous bulk.
Oh, and there are two guest cameos.  One is by Stan Lee, who is an old man at a crosswalk.  The other, playing the pathologist on duty, is a big Marvel Comics fan, and he has a few lines more than usual in his screen appearances.  Hint:  can anyone say Silent Bob?
Maybe much of the film's appeal was based on the fact that I didn't read much Marvel Comics when I was young.  Anyone who has no previous knowledge of the character would see this as another boy becomes superhero, undergoes great loss, fights villains, falls for a girl, etc.  In the end, Daredevil's not the film it could have been because of a lack of appeal, not much action or character development, and that while dark, it lacks the stylish goth of Batman.  All I can say, let's hope this summer, The Incredible Hulk and X2 will surpass this misfire.  Overall rating:  2.5 out of 5, rounded to 3.",1047513600,,2617,4.594827586206897

2277561,3,B0009B0GYA,"Studio execs knew exactly what they were doing when they gave this mediocre film it's unpopular February release date. At least it now has a chance to tread water for a while before drowning.
I just don't get it. Why is it that Hollywood still can't get it that comic book adaptations don't need to be mucked with to have a chance on the big screen? It's no coincidence that the most successful comic book adaptation (and 5th highest grossing film of all time) was also the most faithful to the comics. There is not one instance of a mainstream (or non for that matter) comic adaptation that was anything beyond mediocre when Hollywood twisted it from it's original pages into the barely recognizable mutants that we end up seeing on the big screen. Why? Why didn't Spider-man teach them a lesson? Why if they have so little respect for the original do they want to adapt it in the first place?
Daredevil the movie isn't just different than the comics, it's also far less interesting and far more shallow. One knows that this movie isn't going to be great when the creators found it fit to change every single character they extracted from original pages. Making main nemesis the Kingpin black was the most obvious, but pulling off the lame Batman-rip-off and making him the killer of Matt's father was worse than being innaccurate. It was unoriginal. Next was making Bullseye a crazy-on-the-verge-of-silliness irishman who's bald but otherwise dark haired, has a brand of a target on his forhead, and doesn't have a costume, though he wants one. Bullseye in the comics is none of these. Then Elektra, Daredevil's foe/lover is reduced to nothing but a daddy's girl who happened to train with sensei's from all around the world soley so she ""wouldn't be a victim"" only to become a victim. Hello? Where's 'Elektra: Assassin' in this movie? Why does Matt have dark hair but Elektra have blond highlights?
The director finds it fitting to put in subtle name references to famous artists and writers of the original comics. Kevin Smith and Stan Lee actually have cameos. It's a worthless ploy to please fans because fans would much rather you show respect to those creators by capturing their work in the film. Indeed, the biggest insult is when the film copies direct scenes from Frank Miller and John Romita's masterwork Daredevil story, ""The Man Without Fear"" only to completely omit or worse, rewrite what happens in between. In Daredevil's true origin, he is tought by a mysterious mystic martial arts master known only as Stick (who is also blind). The movie completely rewrites him out of the story and expects the audience to believe that Daredevil mastered martial arts completely on his own. And in this movie, Matt Murdock, the hero who doesn't take lives, is turned into an aggressive vigilante more reminscent of The Crow than Daredevil.
The problem with movies like Daredevil, is that they try to downplay the fantastic in favor of realism. Superheroes in their skin tight costumes would look silly in real life which is why Daredevil is the only one who has a costume. Even it looks more like a leather sport bike riding suit than anything else. When your trying so hard to create a world where costumed heroes are silly, how can they look anything but?
Besides all these problems that will annoy fans, people who haven't read the books will still find nothing more than a mediocre action movie with poor fight choreography that's all too often hidden in close-ups and that will remind you of a Batman sequel. The Wachowski Bro's and Sam Raimi showed everyone how to make superhero movies, and Hollywood still hasn't listened.",1047427200,,3636,4.800637958532695
2277562,4,B0009B0GYA,"Daredevil.  Another famous Marvel Comics character, now brought to life on the big screen.  Many saw this as a ""cash-in"" on the SpiderMan fame.  Before you judge this movie, I would like to make a few points.
1) Stan Lee appears in a cameo.  Some saw this as a .... of SpiderMan, but keep in mind (for those of you that don't know about the comics at all) that HE IS THE CREATOR OF MARVEL.  This was probably his decision anyway.
2) Yes, Daredevil is blind but with enhanced abilities as the result of the accident.  This is where people get put off and think it's stupid; I really thought that this was a unique idea.  Even if I wasn't a fan of the comics I would still be intrigued.
Was this a good movie?  I really thought it was.  Sure, the screenplay could've used a bit more tightening, but the film was helmed exceptionally well by Mark Steven Johnson.  The film is dark and brooding, almost like Tim Burton's Batman.  The cast was good, with special notability to Michael Duncan as the Kingpin.
I was especially surprised at how close it is to the comic.  Sure, there were some differences (like Ben Urich reporting for New York Post, whereas in the comics it's the Daily Bugle---connecting to SpiderMan) but they were good all the same.
Overall, I was very impressed.  When you watch it, keep an open mind and judge it by its own terms.",1047254400,,1345,4.41869918699187
2277573,3,B0009B0GYA,"I liked this movie a lot; I have to say that before I start picking it apart. This movie had a lot going for it; it just didn't take it as far as it should have.
 I'm a huge Marvel Comics fan. I am fiercely loyal to the brand, and I seldom, if ever read comics published by other companies. As such, I have been very happy with the majority of movies based on Marvel titles. X-Men was fantastic, Spider-Man could have used a little more polish in the CGI arena, and Blade 2 was at least good for a laugh.
 Of the Marvel movies I always imagined that Daredevil would be one of the most difficult to do as a live action movie, simply because Matt Murdock is so deeply tortured, and the characters around him are so deep that it would take the perfect cast, the perfect director, and a good solid script to pull it off... the same with any other Marvel comic-turned movie. So far so, good, right?
 Daredevil did not have the perfect cast. While Affleck was perfect for Murdock (I know not everyone agrees, but I think he did great) and Farrell turned the cheesy villain Bullseye into something really cool, Jennifer Garner's Elektra left much to be desired... especially since she looks nothing like the comic character, not even remotely close, and as big of a fan as I am of Michael Duncan Clarke I was not impressed with him as the Kingpin, but that's the script and director's fault. I sincerely believe that this flaw in the film was the result of lacking screen time. Daredevil did to Kingpin what Star Wars did to Darth Maul.
 The plot was also a bit shallow in some regards. The movie did a great job in focusing on Matt Murdock, and his tortured soul, and presenting the world from his eyes... it did not do a good job of presenting the world around him from any other perspective. We do not get to know Elektra, we do not get to know Foggy, we do not get to know the Kingpin, or Bullseye. That's where this movie goes wrong.
 Spider-Man did a great job of allowing us to get to know both Peter Parker and Norman Osbourn, as well as Harry Osbourn, Mary Jane Watson, and even Aunt May. Spider-Man was a little on the long side, but that's a plus. I can sit through two and a half, or three, or even four hours of a good movie no problem. In contrast, Daredevil seemed too short for me, and the only hope I had by the end of the film was that they sequel wouldn't take long because I was not happy with the way the film ended, I was left hanging.
 I think that this movie should have left the audience, and Matt with a bit of a mystery to solve. Who was the Kingpin? Did he even exist? Elements of this mystery were there, but should have really been played upon. Perhaps we should have seen Wilson Fisk as a Philanthropist, someone that the uninitiated audience, as well as the community of the film would be shocked to find out turns out to be the Kingpin. Or at least the community of the film if we HAVE to have the interaction between Fisk, and Bullseye. Maybe Bullseye could receive emails instead just to ad to the mystery?
 What this movie did right was beautifully done, however. We got to know Matt Murdock very well, and for that I have to say kudos. I just wish that the movie had developed the other characters of Hell's Kitchen as well. The movie would have been a lot better that way. Instead it left me wanting.",1047254400,,3331,4.277777777777778
2277574,3,B0009B0GYA,"In order to appreciate the comic book hero movie genre, a viewer must be able not only to suspend disbelief regarding the superpowers of the characters, but also to expect certain forgivable clichs.  For instance, we all know going into this that our hero will have a passion for vigilante justice inspired by some childhood tragedy involving the death of his parent(s).  He will necessarily have to keep his identity secret, thus the tight leatherette costume.  He will have superpowers that are triggered by some freak accident (Batman is the only exception that comes to mind), and the villains may as well.  There is always a reporter lurking, waiting to expose him and pop the story of a lifetime.  And according to all good postmodern comic book superhero bylaws, he must be dark and conflicted; no more squeaky-clean, cheery, optimistic Superman types, no sir!  Yes, I expected these clichs and more, and I was even prepared to embrace them.  I was not disappointed there.
Daredevil delivers the expected elements, no question.  There is plenty of action and excitement as he leaps across rooftops, takes swan dives straight down skyscrapers and generally kicks ... like an uber-blackbelt.  The art direction and special effects are of course cutting edge (I ask you, could Ben Affleck sign on to a movie with second-rate special effects?).  I was particularly impressed with the sequences in which we are treated to a glimpse of the world our blind hero lives in; a vision of figures and objects rendered by his sonar senses into a sort of topographical light/shadow pattern.  The film noir look of New York City at night completes the mood nicely.
Where Daredevil failed for me was in the conspicuous logical flaws popping up throughout the film.  For instance, it was quite a stretch to believe that a childhood accident involving biohazardous liquid spraying across his eyes could impart supersenses while at the same time blinding Mr. Murdock:  but how does that translate to supernatural strength and reflexes?  And how would that protect him from being pulverized when landing on a fire escape from a head dive 40 stories up?  There was no freak accident to explain how archrival Bullseye and girlfriend Elektra came up with similar roof-bounding, gravity-defying abilities, either.  In a movie specifically billed as adult-oriented fare, I found these and other plot holes to be downright insulting to my intelligence.
This film would certainly have been condemned straight to video if not for the casting coup of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner in the leads.  Still, their star qualities could not salvage a contrived plot, unbelievable martial arts moves (note to director:  this was not Crouching Tiger!) and corny dialog.  I for one hope that it doesn't finish Jennifer's budding career, or ruin Ben's.  That being said, at least it was entertaining enough to sit through at the matinee price.

2277575,2,B0009B0GYA,"Having already detested Spiderman, my hopes for Daredevil, seemingly a lesser relation and a complete cash-in, were not high. I hated it just as much as Spiderman, but for entirely different reasons.
Daredevil features a blind lawyer who takes the law into his own hands by murdering criminals who haven't been brought to justice within the judicial system. Were this not a superhero film, that could be a fascinating study of a flawed character. However, because it is a superhero film, he has to be presenting as the hero whose actions are right and are helping to save the city. I find that kind of idea absolutely appalling.
Where Spiderman was overly see-through in its aims and jarringly imprinted American family values onto every scene, Daredevil is tremendously under-ethical, promoting the idea of taking the law into your own hands and acting as a justification for murder. In other words, the ""hero"" administers the death penalty. Now, I'm not in favour of the death penalty even within the judicial system, let alone for individuals to make up their own minds about when its necessary and to take it into their own hands to kill.
If the title character was really on a mission to truly help people, there'd still be no reason to dress up in that kind of costume. Because he's played as such a real person he just isn't right as a superhero - why does he want to dress up in a cape like that? Anyone who did in real life would be seen as a nutcase still playing out their childhood games. I just dislike the whole superhero ethic which promotes violence and suggests its justified this way.
When Matt does take off the costume, there are some touching and enjoyable scenes (otherwise I'd have given it 1 star) but the superhero sections are atrocious, immoral gore-fests which niggle so much that I can't possibly endorse this film.",1047168000,,1844,4.729813664596273
2277576,5,B0009B0GYA,"""Daredevil"" brings to the big screen Marvel's Red-Suited Horned protector of New York's Hell's Kitchen.  Action and FX enthusiasts will be pleased with this flick and fans of the comic books, despite a few discrepancies from the comics, should also be pleased with Hollywood's rendering of their hero.
THE STORY:
As a child Matt Murdock is blinded in an accident.  After losing his sight his other four remaining senses become razor sharp and he acquires a type of ""radar sense"" that helps him ""see"" his surroundings.  (All of which are awesomely depicted in the film!!)  After  his father's murder Matt grows up with a strong sense of getting justice on the evildoers in the world.  He grows up as the dichotomy of justice, working as a lawyer by day as attorney Matt Murdock, and by night as the costumed Man Without Fear, the vigilante Daredevil, who seeks to obtain justice from those who sometimes slips through the legal system's cracks.
THE FILM:
Many will naturally compare this film to Horn-Head's (more popular) colleague Spider-Man.  Matched against Spider-Man, action and comic fans will be equally pleased with Daredevil.  The story in this movie is infinitely darker than with Spider-Man (Daredevil is actually better compared to his DC rival Batman) but the action and effects are (arguably) perhaps superior to the Spider-Man film.
THE COOL THINGS:
The depictions of Daredevil's ""Radar Sense"" are just way cool and the action scenes with Elektra and Bullseye are among the best anywhere.
The filmography of the movie was also awesome.  One of the coolest scenes was actually the opening credits which featured the New York skyline morphing into Braille which then morphed to the cast and crew names.  Nice touch!!!
As a fan of the comic I was very pleased with the portrayals of the characters.  The scriptwriters did a nice job of capturing the dichotomy of the Matt Murdock character and the pure sinisterness of the Kingpin and Bullseye characters as well as the troubled soul of the Elektra character.  Hats off to the cast and crew for putting together a fine movie.
NITPICKING:
The big obvious flaw to the movie was the casting of the Kingpin character.  Any Marvel fan can quickly tell you that the Kingpin was a huge White guy and not a huge Black guy.  In the end though, this detail becomes minor as Michael Clarke Duncan did a SUPERB job with the role.
BEST SCENES:
1. Matt's duel with Elektra
2. ANYTHING with Bullseye (his scenes stole the show,  hilarious as well as action packed)
3. Matt and Elektra in the rain (something about superheroes, women and rain huh?)
4. Anything with the ""Radar Sense""
THE VERDICT:
The Jury says you should definitely check out this flick whether you're an action fan, comic fan or just a movie fan in general.

First of all, nothing in this movie lasts long enough for anyone to enjoy it. Longest part of the movie is a fight between DD and Bullseye and it lasts about 1- minutes. I don't know what the rush was, but every scene of this movie was over before I had a chance to get into it.
Second, these days with all the technology available one would think that visual effects would have been better. It was not all-together bad, but difference between computer-generated character and a real person is just too obvious and fight scenes are pretty ....
Third, filmmakers seem to concentrate on DD's inability (or ability) to see little too much. For the most part we all see everything the way DD does. And although visually it was pretty cool, there was no reason why we had to watch half the movie as if we were blind.
....
All and all, I do not recommend rushing to theaters to see it. There are much more superior movies based on comics we can watch, Spider-man, X-man, Batman.",1046908800,,1205,4.2894736842105265

With the added subplot, a lot is explained for that wasn't in the theatrical. There's way more of Matt Murdock lawyer by day stuff. You see Foggy and Matt a lot more in the court room. You really get the feel of lawyer by day, vigilante by night sort of thing, like in the comic book,  which really makes it a great Daredevil movie.

2277581,2,B0009B0GYA,"I finally saw DAREDEVIL and it is a mixed bag at best. The movie ""looked fine"", presenting us with a welcome dark tone and serious nature which we have come to expect in today's super-hero themed movies. It was bogged down with a few Matrix style fight scenes, but not as many as the trailer implied, thank goodness! Ben Affleck gave a fine performance, as did Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin. He didn't have much character development, but he did really great with what was there. Edit the horrible love story and the movie would be MUCH better. Get rid of the [bad] songs and the love story would at least be bearable! The whole ""glimmering angelic beauty"" of Elektra in the rainstorm was absurd, give me a break! I wasn't the only one rolling my eyes over this sequence, but more on that later. This movie is nothing more than a borderline chick-flick as it stands! I do wish that the main characters wouldn't have started exhibiting super human abilities for absolutely no reason. During the climax of the film, Daredevil literally ""became"" Spiderman, climbing effortlessly all over the surfaces of the church! I thought he was just a human with heightened senses! For that matter, Elektra and Bullseye were also rather ridiculous in a movie that strives to be so **believeable**, what with their abilities to do super-human stunts and high flying leaps. Utterly ridiculous to be sure! One question, why in the world does Matt Murdock sleep in a sarcophagus????????????????? Why was this never explained???????????????????
Colin Farrell actually gave an entertaining performance as the villainous Bullseye, though not neccessarily accurate to the comics. Whether or not that is good or bad point is a matter of personal taste, but he served the purpose in the film. It would have been nice to see the film stick a bit closer to the comics as far as character design though. Daredevil looked OK, but I think his outfit could have been better. Nice mask though! Bullseye had a horrible costume that in no way reflected his comic book counterpart. Kingpin didn't really look the part either, other than his diamond headed staff. Even Elektra was changed, though very beautiful none the less! A little more design work would have yielded better results without resorting to people running around in tights!
I understand that about twenty minutes of character driven story elements were cut from the film to quicken its pace and shorten its length. This move may have ultimately hurt the film, seeing that it is rather lacking in character development overall. If anything should have been left on the cutting room floor, it would have to be the ""dance routine""......er....I mean stand off between Elektra and Matt in the park. I HATE to call this woefully choreographed dance number a fight! That was the single dumbest thing I have seen put to film in years! Did the director think this part of the film needed some sort of silly action sequence....... ""Hmm, the movie is dragging in this stretch.....where can I put an action scene to liven it up........ AHA..... a dance number in the park...PERFECT!"" I cringe thinking about this low point in the film, yet it makes me want to laugh that the filmakers actually thought it would work or be taken seriously!
Now, back to Matt's raindrop vision of Elektra! I like the way in which we (the audience) are brought into the blind world of Matt Murdock. He operates via 'heightened senses' and 'sonar', which is a fine idea lifted directly from the comic books. This would enable him to use sound to detect where objects and structures are located and at what distances they are from him. The visual effect that basically flashes waves of light (to represent the sound waves) is intended for the audience and is not actually what Matt ""sees"". Keeping this in mind, his being able to ""see"" Elektra in the rain is a very contrived and ridiculous sequence in the film. All the rain should do for Matt is enable him to know where she is standing and nothing more. Did the radioactive chemicals give Matt the power to utilize what is only there for the audiences' benefit in addition to his other heightened senses? Just another example of the lack of logic used when making decisions on this film.
With lots of fine tuning, this could have been an excellent entry in the world of live action comic book films, but as it stands it is a lackluster effort that has the words ""LOOK WHAT I COULD HAVE BEEN"" plastered all over it. That is a real shame, but hopefully the inevitable sequel will right the wrongs presented to us here. Go ahead and see the film and judge for yourself!
It has been officially confirmed by Twentieth Century Fox that a solo film based on the character of Elektra is in the works. I ask the question ""why""? What is there about her that sets her apart from any other generic female action star flick? DAREDEVIL is a success because he is a generally well known super hero, not on scale with Spiderman or Hulk, but still generally well known. Judging from what is given to the general audience like myself in the DAREDEVIL film, there isn't very much there to inspire anyone to want more of her character other than in a DAREDEVIL sequel. I want to see her reunited with Matt, even though the film's love story failed to ""hook"" me like it should have, but if not with him then I am not interested at all. I am willing to bet a large part of the paying public shares these feelings. I am not bashing Jennifer Garner's performance or anything, I just don't see the appeal of her going solo and doubt that an ELEKTRA film will share in the success of DAREDEVIL.",1046563200,,5625,4.677093844601413

The dialogue continually tried to be serious in tone, but sometimes was so badly written and delivered that half of the theatre was laughing in places that the director probably didn't intend.  The playground combat scene between Ben Affleck and Jennifer was a joke.  Colin Farrell and the KingPin were the only redeeming elements of the movie -- they did a great job in their roles.  Ben Affleck was terrible.  Even his superhero costume of red leather made him look more like the Catwoman than Daredevil. It's worth seeing if you really really love the superhero genre, but prepare to be disappointed.",1046476800,,735,4.785714285714286
2277594,4,B0009B0GYA,"I do not know who was responsible for what in terms of the finished script of ""Daredevil"" between screenwriters Brian Helgeland and Mark Steven Johnson (who also directed), but somebody put some serious thought into how Matt Murdock functions in the real world.  Each night he sleeps in his own sensory deprivation tank and when it starts raining there is a magic time when he can see the face of the woman he loves (arguably the most beautiful scene ever seen in a comic book superhero movie).  But the former begs the question as to how Murdock and Daredevil function in the real world, and the later raises a whole bunch of questions regarding his radar sense (I mean, I am thinking it is basically CAT scan quality 24/7, right?).  This basically sets up the way I feel about the film: every step forward is counterbalanced by another step backwards.
We start with the beginning, when young Matt Murdock (Scott Terra) is hit by a canister of radioactive material, which blinds him but heightens the rest of his senses to super-human levels.  As is usually the case, fate intervenes and changes Matt's life so that he grows up to become both a lawyer and a superhero, not to mention Ben Affleck.  It is Matt who first meets the beautiful Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), who for reasons that are never really explained is about at good at martial arts as Daredevil, as they prove on a playground.  She is named for the daughter of Agamemnon in Greek mythology who sought vengeance for the death of her father, which turns out to be prophetic for her unfortunate father (Erick Avari).  He is murdered by the psychotic marksman Bullseye (Colin Farrell), but as often happens in these cases Elektra jumps to the conclusion it was Daredevil who did the deed.  Meanwhile, behind it all is the mysterious Wilson Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan), and Daredevil has the gauntlet he has to run through the remainder of the film.
What stops ""Daredevil"" from being a great film?  I would argue two things.  First, the fight sequences mostly take place at night.  Now, at one extreme we have ""The Matrix"" model will its ultra-slow motion approach to fight choreography.  Here we have the other extreme, moving really fast in the shadows and if you can connect the dots in your mind fast enough you might have a clue as to what is going on (I am old and my eyes are going, forgive me).  Second, Daredevil has three big fights in this film with Elektra, Bullseye, and the Kingpin, and the quality of those fights is in the reverse order of what they should be.  The best, baddest, biggest fight should come last and that is not what happens here.  If anything the fight with the Kingpin is rather anticlimactic, especially after the way DD dispatches Bullseye, but more importantly it is probably a fight that should be put off until a future movie (did Luke face down Darth Vader the first time out?).  Not being able to touch the Kingpin would have provided a great ""to be continued"" ending to the film and setting up the question of who will finally bring the crime boss down: Daredevil or Matt Murdock?
Obviously the idea here is to go with the Frank Miller conception of Daredevil, with the martial arts emphasis and the psychotic villains he fought rather than the original Stan Lee and Bill Everett version (Picking up Stan Lee's cameo in this film is a piece of cake, but see if you are good enough to pick up Frank Miller's).  At least Karen Page gets mentioned in the end credits, where you also want to pay attention to the name of the lab assistant played by comic book fan and sometime writer Kevin Smith (also catch the name of the opponent in Jack Murdock's final boxing match).  Which reminds me: DO NOT LEAVE THE THEATER DURING THE FINAL CREDITS; YOU SHOULD STICK AROUND OR YOU WILL MISS SOMETHING.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  Like last summer's ""Spider-Man"" movie, ""Daredevil"" has a healthy respect for the original comic books: the opening shot is lifted from a Frank Miller cover.  The big opening for this film should mean a sequel down the road, giving Affleck a pair of franchises to take turns doing, and if director Mark Steven Johnson or his replacement continues to think through the character the way they started to in this film, this series can get a lot better.  I hope so, because when I cut back big time on the comic books I read ""Daredevil"" was one of the two Marvel titles I continued to read.",1046390400,,4412,4.607918263090677
2277595,4,B0009B0GYA,"Before watching ""Daredevil"", i didn't know much about it, except that he's a comics hero and that Ben Affleck (ugh!) was to play him.
I watched ""Daredevil"" because I'm a movie addict. I wasn't expecting much. And I didn't get much. It's an OK hero movie, with lots of action, fight scenes, the eternal battle between good vs. evil, a tender love sub-plot, etc.
There are some things that got my attention, though:
1) Ben Affleck wasn't that bad, but there are many other actors, more talented than him, that could provide for a better performance. But maybe I'm impartial on this point.
2) Jennifer Garner stablishes herself as the top actress on action performances. She's pretty, skilled, and seems very comfortable during the action scenes.
3) Michael Clarke Duncan and (specially) Colin Farrell, as the ""bad guys"", are very good. It's a pitty, though, that Bull's Eye (Colin Farrell) didn't get more time on screen, and his character wasn't more developed or explored.
4) There are some obvious jokes, lines and scenes during the movie, but the script writers apparently restrained themselves, so those jokes, lines and scenes don't happen too often.
5) Unlike ""Spiderman"" or ""Superman"" this is not a colorful comic-hero movie. In fact it's dark, played almost every time at night (when the Daredevil goes ""hunting""), and one important characters dies. ""Daredevil"" 's tone is rather Batman-like (obviously, I'm talking about the Tim Burton-Michael Keaton Batman, not the trash-movie Joel Schumacher made us swallow), even with some gothic touches...",1046390400,,1553,5.142292490118577
2277596,2,B0009B0GYA,"I guess I would rate this about 1.8, but I still feel I'm being generous.
I'm a comics fan, not too into Daredevil, the new books are pretentious and empty and the film is much the same. It has some of the most atrocious editing I've ever seen. Every death is a joke, and then we're supposed to feel sorry for the lost character. Hell's Kitchen's roughest looking gang seems to be a group of 12 year-olds in the daylight, whoa, tough neighborhood! I think I heard some [...] chirping birds in there! Elektra is gone as soon as she's in the picture, she's the average girl, which is much more boring (but easier for the teen audience to identify with) than a silent assassin. Michael Duncan is barely in the film, hardly set up and the ending battle isn't even a battle. Bullseye is kind of funny, which was their intention. How is Affleck? Kind of passable, actually. He has his smirk and says heroic lines with an unnatural, soft, gruff voice but he doesn't do damage like the director, Mark Steven Johnson. I liked seeing Daredevil come home and spit out broken teeth. The film was shot in such complete darkness that you can't see most of the scenes with clarity. It is dark, but is so thematically chipper and goofy at the same time which detracts from whatever mood that might've had. Foggy Nelson, Matt's assistant was amusing with his alligator comments. Thankfully the cameo from everyone's favourite overrated idiot, Kevin Smith, did not detract from anything, in fact, his cameo had more personality than we got from Matt Murdoch in the entire running length of the film. This is only true to Frank Miller's story in that there are people who die, there is no Stick (Matt trains by punching bags and sliding down rails) and Elektra doesn't even exist like we know her. This is a short, empty film, and if I praise it, I feel like I'm contributing to lower standards. It's a very short kiddie flick, and it should not have been. It has a watered-down Matrix wannabe feel. At least Batman and Robin was funny-bad, this is crushingly average-bad.",1046390400,,2053,4.5967302452316074

2277599,5,B0009B0GYA,"There is something extremely deep, dark and foreboding about Mark Steven Johnson's ""Daredevil."" In many surface ways it is like the Tim Burton ""Batman"": with even the daylight scenes taking on a muted, smoky, fuzzy ambience probably as a way of showing how our blind hero views the external world.
Daredevil is like no other Super-Hero of recent memory though, for his human traits out number his extraordinary ones: he is first and foremost a feeling human being searching for a way to avenge the death of his father and doing it in the only way he knows how...by killing off all those who have done his father wrong.
Ben Affleck plays the Daredevil as a vulnerable man prone to all the usual human foibles even though possessing super-human traits: hearing, smelling and interpreting voice and motivation. Affleck is a conflicted hero, prone to seek the guidance of his priest and feeling flummoxed and unsure by all that he does.
Jennifer Garner plays Electra, Daredevil's love and ultimately his nemesis with a physicality and sexual allure only hinted at by her TV series, ""Alias.""
Garner and Affleck are like Superman in that they are above reproach in their behavior in the world that they inhabit. It is up to Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to throw a wrench in the proceedings with his over-the-top prerformance. He kills as sport and stands for everything that Daredevil and Electra do not: rampant humanity gone berserk. Farrell is disgustingly assertive, aggressive and repulsive: a great, physical performance.
""Daredevil"" is a success because it takes itself very seriously and does so without the least amount of adherence to any known code of ethics. It creates an extraordinary world and inhabits it with characters that have the ring of truth and substantial humanity that strike us as reality, though perhaps jaded, in our world as it stands today in this year, 2003.",1046304000,,1880,4.9714285714285715
2277600,2,B0009B0GYA,"Growing up reading Daredevil, I gave this movie a lot of slack. There are some great moments and when they work they really work. Those of you familiar with the Elektra/Bullseye storyline will not be disappointed. The directors use of radar is very well used and went beyond my expectations. He even manages to convey Matt's acute sense of smell. And the fight are the best so far in a comic hero adaptation. Check out the duel with the motorcycle. Some great tension between Affleck and Farrell.
However the script is appallingly bad. Director/screenwriter Johnson is not satisfied establishing certain elements once and treats the audience as if they were 12 by continually beating you over the head with character revelations, plot points, repeated dialouge and gimmicks (yes, we understand that the scar on Bullseye's head is in fact a Bullseye and that he has the same name.) The fight on the playground is coreographed nicely, but is awkwardly placed and campy. Johnson should stick to the direction and instead of Kevin Smith making a cameo, have him write the next one. Wait a minute! Diddn't the star Ben Affleck win an Oscar for writing? This is a great matinee movie and I am looking forward to the sequel. If at all to see what they improve upon.

2277601,5,B0009B0GYA,"With the New Year's arrival, there was bound to be a new comic book movie. Luckily for us, Daredevil has taken the spot. Upon its release people often wondered, could it take the place of Spiderman? The answer is most certainly yes and it has proven to live up to Marvel's reputation for making great movies. Daredevil presents an amazing display of animation and as well as superb acting to make it an overall stellar movie. Besides that, viewers can be awestruck by its touching story line. The story begins with 12 year old Matt Murdock, portrayed by Ben Aflek, losing his vision. From this he gains a super strength in his remaining four senses as well as a sonar type vision. After being harassed and bullied by other children in the area he begins to hone his skills and becomes extremely strong. Shortly after this after a boxing fight, an event occurs that will forever change his life. Next thing you know, Murdock is posing as a poorly paid attorney by day and super hero Daredevil by night. As the hero he watches over the city and commits acts of violence against those who deserve it.  Later on he becomes involved in fighting with crime-lord Kingpin, actor Michael Duncan and his deadly assassin Bullseye. Bullseye who is portrayed by Colin Farrell has the ability to accurately throw anything precisely such as darts, paper clips, and pencils all of which he uses to kill.  Alongside of Daredevil, whether she knows it or not, is the attractive Elektra played by Jennifer Garner. Elektra's idea for revenge is because of several unnerving deaths in her family. The animation shown in Daredevil is almost frightening, it's that good. When Murdock uses his sonar vision to see Elektra for the first time you can almost feel the emotion. Besides that, the acting portrayed by all of the main characters in the story is remarkable. In the final fight scenes the viewer will most certainly be awestruck. The actors that were chose for their parts proved to all be perfect matches. Although some of the movie seemed to be far fetched it is important that you realize it is based on comic book. Overall, the movie seemed to have a touching story line and great acting. If you have the chance to see it, you would be a fool to pass it up.",1046304000,,2245,4.63819095477387
2277602,3,B0009B0GYA,"If the entire run of Daredevil comics is viewed as a grocery store, this movie consists of a shopping trip where the sweetest, juiciest offerings are snapped up and tossed into the cart with little regard for how they will complement each other.
Everybody in the movie does a pretty good job, and you get a sense that this film was made by people who really liked the character and wanted to make the coolest Daredevil movie possible. Very little of the origin story is changed, and the loss of the heroic feat that resulted in young Matt Murdock's blindness is quickly compensated for by the good boy behavior he exhibits as he learns to make his way in a dark world of overwhelming sounds, smells, touches, and tastes.
Most people probably don't notice that 3/4 of the movie is a flashback--the ""life passing before my eyes"" framework is quickly forgotten as we're captivated by Matt's tragic tale. I really would have preferred the sort of origin story that Miller presented in the comics series when Ben Urich discovered Daredevil's identity, but this approach was serviceable.
And that's my real problem with the movie: the highlights are great--special moments that any DD fan will be familiar with--but they're pasted together with a lot of ""serviceable"" material that just barely bridges the gaps.
The casting is solid, but not incredible. Colin Farrell is great as Bullseye, Jon Favreau is an ideal Foggy Nelson, and Joe Pantoliano does nicely with a not-very-special version of Ben Urich. Ben Affleck is, well, serviceable, and Jennifer Garner, while delightful to look at, is sadly miscast as Elektra Natchios, who was always depicted in the comics as much more mysterious and exotic: Garner's just too whitebread for the role. Michael Clarke Duncan seems to have taken the spirit of the Kingpin to heart, but his clumsy handling of almost every prop they put in his hands (and he's always holding something) makes this great, mountainous, powerful figure look a bit hesitant and shaky.
A lot of this movie works very, very well, and there are some magnificent moments that are right up there with the best the movie superhero genre has to offer. Overall, though, it doesn't quite hold together. A notch below X-MEN, two notches below SPIDER-MAN, but, fortunately, good enough to wash away the taste of the wretched ""Trial of the Incredible Hulk,"" which introduced Daredevil to TV audiences back in the 80s.

I don't want to spoil the movie for people who haven't seen it, but Elektra and Dare Devil do not team up to fight evil like the previews suggest.
Visually, the movie was good. The fight scenes were very well well choriographed and the special effects were above par. It's no Matrix or Lord of the Rings, but then again, what movie is? Visually it was about equal to Spiderman.
As for the casting, Michael Clarke Duncan plays a very good Kingpin, and was a very good actor to pick for the role. I don't think Ben Afleck is someone I would imagine as Dare Devil, though he does play the role well.
I would not recomend seeing this movie, especially if you are expecting an equivelent to Spider-Man. Dare Devil fans might enjoy it though.
One other thing to note, especially for people who think the movie is like Spider-Man: this is a rather violent movie, especially for younger audiences. Compared to other Action movies, there's not as much killing, but it seems that everyone who dies or is injured is brutally stabed, not just shot or punched/kicked.

It didn't stop me from enjoying the cool characters and style of this comic book turned film. Ben Affleck was surprisingly effective playing a super hero. I didn't picture it at first. He plays the title role. And causes no room for complain here. Colin Farrell plays the villian Bullseye. And although he wasn't on screen as much as you might think, he was quite a presence when he was. Now Jennifer Garner was a scene stealer as Elektra. She was worth the price of addmission alone.

Well he is a great actor in my opionion and I thought he played the role very well. Once again not on screen as much as I expected. The main thing that DD does right is that the hero is the main focus like he should be. One complain about the Batman films was that the villians always outshined and over shadow'd the hero.

I consider the original film pretty bad, but the new scenes really make a difference.  I don't want to spoil anything, but there's a scene with the Kingpin that is much better in this version.  One thing that you just can't escape though, is the producer's obsession with unmasking Daredevil to basically everyone.  It's like some movie writers just can't grasp the idea of a secret identity.  More of it probably has to do with making sure the main actor's face isn't covered with a mask as much as possible.  Makes no sense to me, but whatever.  This movie would definitely get another star if they could remove one of the worst fight scenes I have ever witnessed.  Yes, the blind lawyer fighting with an expert martial artist in plain view of many witnesses.  Yeah, what better way to protect your identity than by giving a very public martial arts demonstration.

2277609,4,B0009B0GYA,"""Daredevil"" is an excellent action movie circling around the story of Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), who was left blind as a child when radioactive waste sloped over his eyes - but the same waste which took his eyesight granted him superhuman sharpness - and all his other senses are haywire. He eventually learns to adapt to his new gift, by ""kung-fooing"" and learning to defend himself with the use of his other senses. As an adult, he's a successful lawyer in the small neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, by night, he's the dark, aerobatic vigilant known as Daredevil, who silently brings justice to the streets of New York. He meets and falls in with love with the lovely martial arts master Elektra Natchios (Excellently portrayed by the very talented Jennifer Garner) - who thinks not so highly about Daredevil after she comes to think that he killed her father - when it was really the assassin-for-hire Bullseye (A wonderful performance by Colin Farrell), who was sent by the evil Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan, who, unfortunately, is badly cast), who has also sent other people to be murdered. Once Daredevil finds out that Kingpin is the culprit, he must face him and Bullseye in a final showdown - in an attempt to complete his vow of bringing justice to his city.
Personally, I enjoyed ""Daredevil"" a lot - and I was quite surprised because I really expected it to be like ""The Phantom"" with Billy Zane - a flop and a cheap imitation of ""Spider-Man"". And it wasn't like that at all! I also didn't have much anticipation for Ben Affleck's performance, and it wasn't bad - it was actually very good and he had a lot of physical potential. Oh - and I loved Jennifer Garner. She was a great leading lady. She's definitely bringing on the girl power to the movie. Colin Farrell was so good, I think he stole the show. He was evil. Pure evil. Though I can't say much of Michael Clark Duncan, it really looked as if he wasn't really enjoying the role. He didn't sound or even look evil. The special effects were a teensy-weensy too fake for my taste, but they were fine. I also think that they should've laid off the rock music. It was just annoying to hear people talk and hearing some rock band singing in the background when there isn't even a radio in the scene. This movie was not for that type of scenario. The story and directing were great! It was orginial, on track and very darn good- - bravo for Mr. Johnson.

Anyway, there where a lot of problems, but most of them come from a tired cliched super hero plot line and very poor direction and editing. The man who killed Owen Meany needs to make a few more movies before he can handle the action genre. Didn't have a fraction of the fun and excitment of Spider-Man, or the mood of Batman.
Decent performances by the cast, a little campy on Colin Farrel's part, but what can you do. Jennifer and Ben did the best they could be expected with such a briefly scripted romance, another weak point.

I thought it was gonna be like spider-man a little bit but it actually turned out to be different from spider-man, it was more hardcore and had its own style, it was also a dark movie too. This is a movie worth seeing right here and everyone will enjoy it and this is the year of marvel since they have X-men 2 and the Hulk coming later this year. I like comic book movies and they're entertaining and next year in 2004, Spider-man 2 will be out and i hope they make a punisher movie now that ill pay to see!.",1045958400,,614,4.040983606557377
2277622,3,B0009B0GYA,"After hearing much hype on Daredevil, (""It's better than Spiderman, dawg!!!"") I decided to check it out.  After watching it, I felt it was essentially good, but still missing something.  I can't argue with SOME of the fight scenes, but movie critics anywhere know that other scenes were just wanna-be Matrix.  Affleck gave a solid performance, but the error was in the plot, as I never felt it was going anywhere during the movie.  Basically, there wasn't enough content to satisfy the plot.  If you want to check out an excellent comic book hero movie, watch Spiderman.",1045958400,,570,4.835051546391752
2277623,2,B0009B0GYA,"I saw ""Daredevil"" on opening day, against my better judgement.  I had read the scathing reviews in the Boston Globe and Entertainment Weekly, but I was willing to give it a shot.  I mean, it's Ben Affleck in leather...
However, I was ultimately disappointed.  Not because of what the Globe and EW had mentioned but for other reasons.  Ben Affleck plays the tormented Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer (who somehow subsists on only pro bono work) out for venegance as his alterego Daredevil.  Ever since he witnessed the death of his father as a child, he is on a serious rage streak (oddly reminiscent of his character in ""Changing Lanes""), and he is out for blood against the city's evil-doers.  However, his superhero status is not so black hat vs. white hat.  In fact, at several points in the movie, he questions if his vengeance is actually making him a bad guy as well.  Very interesting, right?
Well, let me just say here that these attempts to make Murdock interesting just make the Ben Affleck even less effective in this role.  He just lacks the sincerity to pull off the tormented superhero.  In addition, the way the story is written doesn't establish any of the characters very well to begin with.
This is especially true of Elektra Natchios, played by the svelte Jennifer Garner.  I admit, she has a great physique and killer moves, but her character just seems like a fluffy side-story.  For some reason, she has been raised as some sort of Amazon martial arts warrior woman.  But why?  ""My father never wanted me to be a victim.""  OK, MY dad doesn't want me to be a victim either.  Doesn't mean they'd have sent me to army training maneuvers over Camp Horizons.
However, the movie wasn't ALL bad.  Colin Farrell makes a comical but deadly foil as Bullseye, and Daredevil's arch-nemesis Kingpin (played by Michael Clarke Duncan) is sufficiently evil as the criminal mastermind of the city.  The action sequences are good as well.
So, to sum it up, Daredevil is all action, no talk.  The characters are poorly developed, and you just can't get very interested in them.",1045872000,,2077,4.703601108033241
2277624,1,B0009B0GYA,"Nothing happened in this entire movie. Do you know who the Kingpin is and why he does what he does? I don't, and I've grown up reading about the character! Atrocious acting (Michael Clark Duncan is WAY overrated, Ben Affleck is emotionless) and a terrible non-existent script make me ashamed for Hollywood in general.",1045785600,,317,4.888888888888889
2277625,4,B0009B0GYA,"I must say that upon entering the theater, I was expecting a great show, one that could rival last spring's amazing Spiderman. The previews had certainly led me to believe such a thing, not that I was totally dissapointed when I left. There were some great aspects to it, and I, being attracted to movies with lots of romance coupled with great action sequences, did get what I had hoped for. The only difference was that the happy ending (or that which would be reflective of later happiness) was not at all what I was left with. ...The movie itself was also rather dark. It was made to be that way for a reason as the ending explains, but it is not to be recommended to those who wish to experience the uppity atmosphere that Spiderman held. Overall, it was a good movie but I was mortified at how they finished it off. For the last 20 minutes or so of the film, I admit I was hoping that the deceased person would somehow rise from the dead, and those thoughts prevented me from fully appreciating (or paying attention) to the finale. My impressions of Daredevil are as I have just previously explained and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fun action sequences and lots of romance.",1045699200,,1195,4.461187214611872
2277626,5,B0009B0GYA,"I just saw the movie tonight and I must say, while I did enjoy the film in many aspects and I think it's EXTREMELY well done, the movie has a very dark and quite morbid tone.  And I'm not saying that this kind of movie is not a crowd pleaser, but it's definitely not what I expected.  There are no shiny bright happy moments and cute little plot twists or such.  This is NOT in any way shape or form ""Spiderman.""  ""Spiderman"" was fun-loving and happy bright colors and funny humor all the way.  In fact, I'd even go as far to say that it's quite ""adult.""  Now, a couple of kids were sitting behind me and they couldn't stop making exciting action comments and after the movie they trailed away non-stop talking about the movie.  So I'm sure kids will love it.  But as I said, it's quite dark.  Oh, and by the way, a someone dies early in the film and that's very sad for the audience because we really liked this character (this event alone makes up most of the morbidity of the film).
Now, onto the actual production aspects.  The concept of this computer-generated sense of hearing/sonar deal was done MASTERFULLY.  And there's also the matter of the costume.  The Daredevil costume looks SOO ugly.  It's on my top ugly super-hero outfits list.  And I'm sure it was hot and uncomfortable as anything.  Especially his legs; they look the worst.  Colin Ferrel is SOOO good.  He's really amazing in this role.  I mean REALLY!  He should receive some kind of award for this; and it's a shame because the big awards are very rarely ever given to actors in Superhero flicks.  Between his costuming and this cool motorcycle he's so cool.  He has such incredible energy and flair for this role.  You can tell that he's really taken this seriously.  Jennifer Garner, another amazing visual sight.  They have her with this long curly hair and these tight cute outfits and she's SO naturally beautiful.  There's this fun fight scene between Murdock and Electra that's just wonderful.  It's the only ""fun"" scene in the movie.  There's nothing really terribly exciting about Affleck's performance.  In fact, I think another actor might have improved the film.  Now, don't get me wrong, he was very good and very dedicated.  But I think maybe someone a little smaller.  Also, Affleck is a very large man.  He's gigantic.  He's too big.  No one is that big.  Especially a super-hero.  They're all normal sized.  He's so large that he's almost clumsy.  And it also occured to me that I'm sure all of these wonderful back-flips and stuff are done by a stunt double.  Do I care?  Yeah I kinda do.  Was there no athletic agile actor that who we can at least think he did most of his own stunts?  That's movie magic too.  I'm sorry to be a Ben Affleck basher.  He's actually one of my very favorite actors in Hollywood.  But the role just left more to be desired.  Michael Clark Duncan as the Kingpin is so fun.  He's large and in-charge!
 I would kill to see a Daredevil/Spiderman combo movie.  And that's not such a bad idea.  Don't they meet in the comic books?  I believe they find out each other's identities and stuff.  That would be sooo cool.  They should actually do that!  A Tobey Miguire Ben Affleck flick.  They'd probably make it bad though.  They always do that when it's exciting like that.
The film really is very good. It's extremely accurate and sure not to let fans down (unlike X-men -- DOCTOR Jean Grey?  The messed-up Rogue story? hello?!!)  Daredevil is definitely worth seeing.  When it comes out on video I'm definitely renting, if not buying.",1045612800,,3550,4.5516693163751984

2277628,4,B0009B0GYA,"Included on my list of ""things I like"" are ""live action movies based on comic-book superheroes"".  Well, this movie makes the cut.  Although I haven't been a big fan of either the Daredevil comic, Ben Affleck or Jennifer Garner, this movie didn't disappoint me.  It had all the elements of a comic book come to life on the big screen, including a star-crossed romance (think ""Blade"" and ""Spider-Man"").  And just as ""Spider-Man"" gave us a new perspective on Tobey Maguire, I now understand the sex symbol appeal of hunky Ben Affleck.  Go get 'em, tiger!  It's obvious Ben lost some weight and gained some muscle mass in all the right places, because he's doing that daredevil costume much justice in the movie.  Jennifer Garner's role as Elecktra needed a little polish, I thought, but her effort filled the requirement.  And frankly, I'd watch Michael Clarke Duncan do a Rice Krispies commercial.  That man can do no wrong!
I treated myself to the movie for  Valentine's Day and left the theater with a big smile on my face.  I will await the sequel patiently, and I will pay to see it too.",1045612800,,1089,4.649214659685864

If you like action movies with at least some depth, this is your movie.

Instead of relying on just special effects,-- don't misunderstand me; it had a lot of action-- it was also character-driven. Unlike ""Spider-man,"" which I happend to like, and other recent comic-book movies, we got to know the characters. Daredevil was also reminiscent of the first ""Batman"" in its dark tones. The movie also had really good acting, which is rare in most big-budget action movies. As in all the other superhero movies, the bad guy stole the show-- this time the culprit was Bullseye, played by Colin Farrel. Ben Affleck did a good job, too; I was skeptical about him, but he was actually good. Jennifer Garner was also good--then again, is there anything bad about her? The movie also had some very funny lines, most of which came from the banter between Ben Affleck's character and John Favreau's character.
  This movie is perfect for men and women; it has both Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck. Definitely go see this movie for action, wittiness, and romance.",1045612800,,1054,4.85
2277641,4,B0009B0GYA,"No, it's not as good as Tim Burton's Batman, nor the original Superman or the recent Spiderman movies. But Daredevil still is a good comic book film that wins much of my praise by being true to the page in creating a very dark character in a harsh world
Still, it is not without its flaws, and if it weren't for some very unique traits I would rate this film as only mediocre. But what works here works exceptionally well. Beginning with the traditional origin story of Daredevil (Ben Affleck), a blind superhero whose remaining senses are greatly heightened, the movie shows how he became a vengeful vigilante who kills the bad guys rather then turning them in to face a potentially corrupt court system (Daredevil's alter ego Matt Murdock is a lawyer by day). This world is mean, and so is its superhero. But he wrestles with his conscious and wonders if he is a bad guy too. In this comic book world, people die. Including those you don't expect to. In other words, it more accurately depicts real life while still in a superhero world.
One particular unique thing about the film is how it illustrates Daredevil's radar sense. The vibrations he picks up are shown in a fantastic visual effect that has to be one of the best film realizations of a superpower in history. From the origin scene when he goes blind to a wonderful scene with Elecktra in the rain where he first ""sees"" what she looks like from the drops of rain on her face, the technique is used for characterization and ""film moments,"" and never just to show off a cool special effect.
Unfortunately, the movie isn't perfect. There isn't enough development of Elecktra and Daredevil's relationship, and bad guy Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan) doesn't have enough screentime to villainify his presence. All the characters could have benefited from further characterization as well. But this is a comic book movie, after all, and in the end what matters most is how much fun it was. And Daredevil is a blast.",1045612800,,1971,4.68299711815562
2277642,3,B0009B0GYA,"This year, many comic book based movies will be coming out in the theaters. A few examples are X-men 2, The Hulk, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. If you're going to see one comic book based movie this year, I'd honestly wait for one of those (X-men looks REALLY good) but if your content on seeing them all Daredevil is not a complete waste of your time. It tells the story of comic book hero, Matthew Murdock (played by Ben Afleck), who at twelve, lost his sight after being exposed to radio active chemicals. Strangely enough this incident not only left him blind but with amazing powers. His other senses are so strong that he can experiences the world around him better than we do. Years later he is semi-sucessful lawyer who only defends criminals who are innocent. But by night he is Daredevil, a superhero who takes down villains who manage to slip through the justice system.
Although I have never read the comic books, I find the story line to be fascinating. Our hero is not a very admirable person. He takes it upon himself to be the living embodiment of justice, meaning he will take anyone out who he thinks is guilty enough. If portrayed the right way Daredevil could be seen as a very dark hero who struggles with himself more than he struggles with his villains. Unfortunately either due to bad writing or Ben Afleck's mediocre acting, you find you know very little about the character of Matt Murdock. Unless you read reviews or were familiar to the comics you would have no idea on why he sleeps in that strange water filled chamber. How does the priest know of his alter identity? There are many more questions that need to be answered. Although Afleck does a good job you don't feel as if he really gets into the character as much as say, Tobey Maquire did with Peter Parker in Spiderman. This is very odd because Afleck is supposedly such a big DD fan.
Another complaint I have is the lack of development of the romantic and vengeance storyline involving Elektra (played by Jennifer Garner). Yes, Gardner does just fine with the acting thing, that's not the problem. The problem is you never feel as if the two main characters had the time to really fall in love. Another problem I had is I, going into the movie, I suspected the plot to be very much based Eletrka wanting revenge for her father's death, who she blames on Daredevil, not knowing that it is the man she has fallen in love with. This story line is very minor and isn't really brought up until the end. In fact the end is so rushed that you feel as if they didn't care about tying up all of the lose ends in the plot. All they wanted to do was prepare for the possible sequel, which I kind of doubt will happen.
My last problem with this movie is with the villains. You can tell Colin Farrel, who plays the evil Bullseye with deadly aim, really had a lot of fun with this role. He just seems to ooze comic book villain. Unfortunately he is character is given so little screen time that you never get to learn anything about it besides, as my friend so eloquently put it ""he likes to throw stuff."" Still he's the only actor that when you look at him in this movie, you think about the character he plays, not the actor that plays the character. Michael Clark Duncan (yeah the guy from Green Mile) who plays Kingpin, the crity's crim leader, does an okay job but to be honest the scariest thing about him is his voice, not his character. That's not too good when he's supposed to be the big villain of the movie.
Now that I'm done complaining (never thought I'd be done did you?) here's what I liked about the movie. The visual effects are stunning. It's probably one of the most visually pleasing movies I've seen so far in 2003. They manage to really let you see what Daredevil is seeing, even though he is blind. My favorite part would have to be any scene where Matt uses the rain to help him see. It really emphasizes the romance in this movie without making it seem cheesy and boring. Also they do a very good job explaining the background off Matt which gives some real insight into his character. The action seens are incredible and you can't help wondering, what will happen next?
So that's how I feel about this movie. If I were you, I would rent it on video. It's a decent movie and if they make a sequel (which I have my doubts on) I'll probably end up seeing it as well. It's not a bad movie but it's not a very good one either.",1045612800,,4435,4.383495145631068
2277643,1,B0009B0GYA,"I went to see Daredevil, hoping that it would capture and repeat some of the magic of last year's Spider-Man. However, instead of getting Spider-Man one and a half, this movie is more like a fractional Spider-Man, one-half. The movie suffers from fitful direction and an absolute lack of pacing.  It's enough to make one wonder if it is simply the result of poor editing or if for lack of time there was not enough suitable material to make a complete film. It could be both.  Unfortunately, all I know is Daredevil fails to make a meaningful whole out of the sum of its many, promising parts. Eager to make a quick buck, it seems the studio pushed an unfinished script into production to capitalize on the last couple of years' successful comic book adaptations. Don't let that ill-gained dollar be yours.
What is truly unfortunate is that the concept is not devoid of potential. But the story is unfinished and the resulting performances show it. Mark Steven Johnson's participation as both a screenwriter and the director, means that a great part of the blame could be attributable to him.  Despite his reported passion for the material, and with the exception of the scenes covering the origins of Daredevil, there is almost no attempt made to make any emotional connection to the characters whatsoever.  Notable actors such as Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner and Michael Clarke Duncan are all ill-used in this charade.  From their delivery of the clichd dialogue, it doesn't even sound like the actors in this film know what they are supposed to be doing.  With the Daredevil material having been around for so long, and with any number of potential story lines, it seems the director simply failed in successfully choosing a concept and fleshing it out as a complete story for the audience.  So what we are left with is a group of shallow characters, poorly shot fight scenes, and perhaps the the laziest film adaptation possible from such an existing, richly imagined world.
This is not to say that the movie is without its moments. The special effects are decent, if derivative, but not up to the standards of similar films in the same genre.  Fortunately the world of Daredevil is a dark one and so the audience doesn't get much of a chance to see the visual shortcomings.  I imagine most of the effects shots won't stand up so well under DVD-viewing scrutiny.  Jon Favreau and Joe ""Joey Pants"" Pantoliano both do a great job.  But the best moments in the film are reserved for the entirely over the top performance of Colin Farrell as the villainous Bullseye. But even he is not enough to salvage this misbegotten project from the over-abundance of unimaginative, uninspired dialogue.  Which brings me to a word of warning. Daredevil is a violent film and I would not suggest it for small children. The brand of vigilantism that the protagonist practices results in a body count only exceeded in violence by the villains.
Ultimately, there is nothing so obvious here as the fact that a better script and director could not have made this a much better film. But Johnson seems at a loss as director to control the action whether shooting the typical fight sequences or the typical on-screen romance between Garner's Elektra and Affleck's Murdock.  Even the soundtrack fails to make this film a more meaningful, cohesive whole. Never, besides 'The Phantom Menace', have I left a movie feeling so unfulfilled.  What escapes my comprehension is how Spider-Man was done so right when the conceptually similar Daredevil went so terribly wrong.  I rarely write reviews, but I feel I would be doing the general public a disservice if I did not express the lack of craftsmanship represented by this film.  I'm sure this film will do well at the box-office.  I even suspect there will be a sequel in the works, but as it stands, Daredevil leaves the viewer seeing the characters just like they would appear in their source material comic books: flat, two-dimensional, and derived from wood.",1045526400,,3987,4.82258064516129

2277645,4,B0009B0GYA,"Last Summer's Spider-Man reeled in mass amounts of dollars for Marvel, and that's not where it stops. More movies are coming out, and the most recent one is Daredevil. Not as mainstream to non-comic fans as Spider-Man and Batman (more than likely because DD never had his own show), Daredevil is a very dark comic movie, unlike X-Men and Spider-Man, but like the original Batman and Spawn.
Now, I am NOT an Affleck fan. I don't have anything aganist him, but I'm not a fan, and I wasn't as excited about this movie as I was for X-Men and Spider-Man, because I'm not used to Daredevil (for reasons suggested above), and because Ben Affleck. He seems like the last person to do Daredevil. Let's just hope Seann William Scott isn't really The Hulk...
Now the story, even though I'm not sure how true it is to the original comic: 12-year old Matt Murdoc lives with his pro-boxer father in Hell's Kitchen. Well, one day Matt takes a short cut through a chemical site, and sees his dad harassing a man. In a state of confusion and anger, Matt runs off, and is blinded by a chemical spilled out of a can into his eyes. But, frm his blindness, gains super-human powers to his remaining senses. His dad is killed later by Kingpin, the man who seemingly runs all crime in New York. He vows to keep the city safe for the rest of his life, and becomes Daredevil.
Now, in Daredevil there are two main villians: the highly entertaining Bullseye (who dies way too soon), and a black Kingpin, who I can remember from an appearence in a Spider-Man cartoon.
I reccomend this if you are just looking for a good action movie, or are a comic book nut, or if you're overly obsessed with Ben Affleck. And there's a cameo with Kevin ""Silent Bob"" Smith in here as well...",1045440000,,1746,4.459375

2277647,5,B0009B0GYA,"For us who are ""Daredevil"" enthusiasts, I am sure there will be much debate as to the films re-telling of Daredevil's orgins.  Regardless, in essence, this movie stays pretty true to the Daredevil mythos.  Johnson's movie explores Matt Murdock's (Daredevil) tortured soul as he fights for the oppressed by day as the lawyer Murdock, and at night by Hell Kitchen's savior, Daredevil.
Johnson's strength is that he jumbles most of the major Daredevil characters (Kingpin, Electra, Foggy, Urich, and Bullseye) without loosing sight of the central character - Daredevil.  The Batman movies missed this important step in developing the four Warner Movies.  Johnson does this masterfully, as he brings the comic book to life.
Secondly, Johnson could have taken the easy way out, and not bring up Matt's religious struggel between being a good Catholic and living in the realities of this world.  Johnson handles this well by interweeving Matt's faith and struggel without being preachy. He struck a great balance.
All the actors pull their parts off and Afflect, who has the hardest part in selling Daredevil, does a good job.  Especially well acted is Michael Clarke Duncan portraying the Kingpin.  Further, Foggey is played perfectly.
The action/fight scences are also very well done.  Johnson's familarity with the martial arts shows and it is another superhero movie that excells in this area (the fights are far superior to the Batman, X-Men, Spawn,and Spiderman movies, only Blade rivals the movie in this area).
Daredevil has always been my second favoriate hero  (Batman is first), but this movie is superior to the Batman films as the plot and charcters are handled extremely well.  See DAREDEVIL the Movie, even if you are not a comic book fan, this movie is downright entertaining.",1045440000,,1786,5.127586206896551
2277648,1,B0009B0GYA,"To be honest I'm getting a little sick of these comic book movies, and the worst part is my friends don't care so I'm constantly being dragged to see these bad movies.
 If movies like ""X-Men"", ""Spider-Man"", & ""Daredevil"" had been released 10-12 years ago I would be having a blast at the movies, but that's not the case. And I'm not interested in comics anymore, and I don't remember the story-lines concerning the characters.
 One of the many reasons I didn't like ""Spider-Man"" was because I didn't feel Toby Maguire was a good choice for the lead. I don't think of him as a heroic leading man type, Affleck on the other hand is liked by the ladies so he stands more of a chance at pulling off the role despite the fact he has no talent as an actor. And in all honestly I could of liked this movie more than ""Spider-Man"" or ""X-Men"", but, here's why I didn't.
 First of all Affleck seems a bit to smug to me in this movie. He acts too much like a know it all. I didn't like his interruptation of the character. My second problem acting wise has to do with the ""Bullseye"" character played by Colin Farrell. A person I think has been OVER-used in Hollywood in just a short amount of time. Already in the past year has has appeared in ""Minority Report"" (Which is a good movie) and ""The Recruit"" (Another good movie) but here he plays ""Bullseye"" like a vilgilante gang member. Not at all what I was expecting this character to be like. I pictured the character to clearly be evil a little disturbed, but, smart, slick, sneaky and sly as a fox. Colin Farrell plays him like yes he's evil, insane, and a biker. Totally a wrong choice. But who's to blame? Farrell or the director? Also, I can't understand why Michael Clarke Duncan was chosen in his part. It all seemed wrong.
 I did some reading when I went home about the daredevil character. I read my old marvel comic trading cards and read that daredevil and Elektra (played by Jennifer Garner) meet while in college. Which doesn't happen in this movie. I also never read anything about daredevil's dad being a boxing, but, that may just be my fault. Going back to Garner though, she just isn't given a good role. Infact no one really is well written in this movie. And Garner doesn't really make the character believeable.
 I have one question for everyone, this was never explained in the movie, why does ""Daredevil"" sleep in water? That confused me.
 For those who liked ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" I really doubt you'll be coming out of ""Daredevil"" enjoying it. It's a film I think so far, is one of the worst of the year (and I'm sure that opinion will stick).
 Bottom-line: A silly poorly written comic book movie that didn't seem to bring it's characters to life, the way ""Spider-Man"" did. We really don't believe in what we're seeing. A missed chance at what could of been a good movie.",1045353600,,2839,4.458574181117534

2277651,4,B0009B0GYA,"Following the success of both X-Men and Spiderman, Marvel brings us yet another succesful comic to film transition. Daredevil, while still maintaining a comic book feel is a much grittier film than both of the previous Marvel releases. In fact, I feel that this film is oriented more towards adult movie-goers than younger ones, although it should be a perfectly acceptable film for older children.
 THe casting in this film was superb. Ben Affleck was a perfect selection for the part of the Dardevil. As well, the gorgeous, Jennifer Garner, portrayed a very sexy and lethal Electra. The other supporting characters were also played well by their respective actors/ actresses.
 Overall, I give this film a 4. I also highly recommend it to any older fan of the comic hero or action junkies.",1045353600,,790,4.932330827067669
2277652,4,B0009B0GYA,"For those of you who know Ben Affleck as a lesbian-chaser/comedy-only guy, you just may be slightly shocked with his performance in ""Daredevil"".  In this comic-based film, Affleck assumes the role of Matt Murdock as well as the ""justice to be served""-minded Daredevil.  But, as in many other comics, his character of Daredevil is hidden from the real world.  And his everyday disposition is portrayed through Matt Murdock, a lawyer.  But what is interesting about Matt is the fact that when he was a kid he was blinded; yet what blinded him only made him stronger in his other four senses.  Then soon after he lost his sight, someone killed his father.  But as he searches for revenge, he becomes more and more insecure about his role.
You must understand that this movie is based on a comic book.  And a comic book is meant mainly for kids to be able to understand.  So if you're thinking to yourself, partway into the movie, that the plot is kind of bogus--you're right.  It's meant to be that way.  As I don't want to spoil any of the movie for you, I won't tell you much of what happens.  But as you can imagine, Daredevil runs accross many foes and a few friends.  One of those friends is played by Alias' (on HBO) Jennifer Garner.  She (as the beautifully strong Elektra) becomes, after a impressive fight with Ben, friends with Matt.  But the life story of Elektra is not quite favorable, to say the least.
What really makes this movie excellent is not the plot.  It's the direction.  Mark Steven Johnson did an awesome job with, as I said before, a guy who didn't have much of an action background to support him.  But from what I saw on a VH1 All Access show, Affleck and a few others took around two months of training for their roles.  And it shows.  You don't have to be a genius to see that.  And if you're thinking to yourself that the scenes look too fake, you just don't understand.  Another big plus for the movie was the supporting cast.  It features, aside from Garner, Michael Clarke Duncan of ""The Green Mile"", Jon Favreau (who gives us some much needed comedy--without him that would've been something the film lacked), and Joe Pantoliano (""Memento"" and ""The Matrix"").  There is also a cameo appearance by comic enthusiast and Ben's lifetime friend/co-worker, Kevin Smith.  And if you're a Kevin Smith fan you'll love his appearance as a forensic assistant.  I think Kevin was the only person to use a swear word in the movie.  And fitting it was.  Being that his movies are mostly curse words and vulgarity (not to say that's bad).
Although I did not see ""Spider-man"", I'm going to assume that ""Daredevil"" is somewhat similar to it.  I think that's a fair assumption.  The reason I gave this movie 4 stars, and not five, has to do with Kevin Smith.  Being the big Smith fan I am, I was disappointed to hear that his next project ""Jersey Girl"" was to be delayed.  It was delayed because Affleck wanted to play the parts in ""Daredevil"" and ""Jersey Girl""; yet this one came first.  Call me shallow or call me stupid, but I don't think that's a way to treat a friend, or a girlfriend (Jennifer Lopez will be co-starring with him in ""Jersey Girl"", out this summer).  Anyway, you should see ""Daredevil"".  If you enjoy Ben Affleck, action or comics, then this movie is definitely for you.  It's a great action-packed movie with a great cast; and it's one of the best comic book stories I've ever been a part of.  Honest.",1045353600,,3436,4.521103896103896

2277654,5,B0009B0GYA,DAREDEVIL is a great movie. The Effects are good and the stunts are excellent. I thought it was better that Spiderman and X-men. I thought it ranked up there with the first Superman and Batman. It confused me how Daredevil fought and after I saw this movie now I have an idea. This is a great comic book flick.,1045267200,,310,4.271186440677966
2277655,4,B0009B0GYA,"Let me get this out of the way now; I am a huge comic book fan.  So in that context, my view maybe somewhat biased.  From talking to other people who saw the late Thursday showing, I was expecting the second coming of Spawn (a very murky, dreadful movie).  I'm glad that my feelings didn't stop me from seeing this very dark but wonderful movie.
Without giving away the basic plot, here's what I thought was the good and the bad about the movie:
The Good
* Affleck held his own as Matt Murdock/Daredevil
* Great shots of Hell's Kitchen gave off a great mood of murkiness
* Jon Favreau was hilarious and ate up whatever little screen time he had as Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson
* Colin Farrell was great as the zany Bullseye
* None of the major characters dies (unlike the Batman series or the more recent Spider-Man movie)
* Tons of inside comic book references for geeks like me to appreciate
The Bad
* Daredevil actually allowed a criminal die when he could've done something to save him - Way out of character and took me out of the movie for a couple of minutes
* Not a fan of the sensory-deprivation chamber
* No Stick (character introduced by Frank Miller in the comics and helped Murdock adapt to his new powers)
* Although necessary, Electra's sais training seemed somewhat forced and disjointed
Overall, it was a very enjoyable movie and will go to see the sequel, if there is one.",1045267200,,1385,4.44488188976378

Daredevil is at least five times better than Spider-man, and there are very few similarities between the two other than the color of their costume. ... Forget about spider-man, block out thoughts of every other superhero movie and watch this film, a very close adaptation of the comic books, with good acting, a good storyline, well choreographed and interesting action scenes (unlike the other red wonder's little diddy) and an enjoyable, satisfying finale. If you look at it that way, it won't disappoint.",1045267200,,672,4.9035087719298245

The movie ends in a very unsatisfactory way. Of course we know there will be sequels to the sequels but show us something in the meantime to make us want to come back. The end leaves you feeling somewhere between a commercial break and a season finale but without any actual cliffhanger even, just an 'I'll be back' cliche equivalent. Very disappointing.",1045267200,,630,4.952830188679245
2277658,5,B0009B0GYA,"Being a comic book fan, I was a bit skeptical on how good this movie will be. Boy, this movie does not let me down at all. The film is quite true to the comic itself while it will not let newcomers out in the dark. Daredevil is not your regular superhero, he does not hesitate when giving bad guys their due(whether it be killing them or severely breaking their body parts...). Even the villians are a bit more evil than your ""regular"" villans(lets just say an senior citizen gets killed by a peanut).
Ben Affleck plays a convincing Matt Murdock(Daredevil). It was also enjoyable seeing one of my favorite Marvel character, Elektra, come to life on the big screen.
The film itself basically starts off with Daredevil's origin and leads you to how Daredevil gets a sticky situation between Elektra, Bullseye and Kingpin. The fight scenes were expertly done(thanks to a Hong Kong crew). I was never disappointed in this film. I reccomend it highly!",1045180800,,946,4.704819277108434
2277674,5,B0009B0GYA,"I went into this movie not expecting much based on the previews, and came out of the theater thinking it was the third greatest comic book movie ever X-Men and the first Batman being the top two, but this one may tie in my book with Batman. This beats Spiderman which  I feel wasn't as good as people made it sound. I liked it because it was not the typical comic book movie it was dark and had more of an R rating edge to it. The best performance would not be Ben Affleck, but Colin Ferell his part was shorter then I thought it would be but in a few scences you almost root for his character. Michael Clark Duncan is well fitted for the roll of Kingpin, Jennifer Gradner is sexy and dangerous as Electra, and Ben Affleck is not my pick for the roll but is ok as Daredevil. The special effects are no different from Spiderman for the most part of movie, but the fight with Kingpin at the end is one of the best special effects fights ever. If your a fan of the first two batman movies before their dwon fall with the two you should check this out, lets hope with the sequals it won't go the same route as Batman did.",1045180800,,1117,4.100456621004566

I was laughing the entire time; the corniness was unbelieveable, the ending completely sucked.",1045180800,,396,5.140625
2277676,4,B0009B0GYA,"After the hugh success of SPIDER-MAN, it was obvious to many film observers that superhero films were back in vogue in a major fashion.  DAREDEVIL is the first film since SPIDER-MAN to test that theory and, while the film isn't perfect, it doesn't disappoint.  This movie tells the story of Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), who lost his sight when his eyes are exposed to toxic waste in childhood.  However, his remaining senses are amplified to a superhuman degree.  When his father is murdered by mob enforcers, Murdock decides to fight injustice in his own unique way.  By day, he works as a lawyer while he metes his own dark brand of justice nightly as the red-garbed vigilante, Daredevil.  Eventually, he meets and falls in love with the shipping heiress, Elektra (Jennifer Garner).  However, both of them are drawn into tragedy when they become unwittingly involved in the schemes of the city's crime boss, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and his half-crazed assassin, Bullseye (Colin Farrell).
At first glance, Affleck would be an unconventional choice for a superhero lead as he tends to play affable, yet somewhat bland, leading men-types, but he pulls it off quite well. You can believe that this is a man who is driven to fight crime while fighting his own inner demons. Also, with so many other characters competing for attention, Affleck succeeds in making and keeping the character as a major focus in the film.  This is opposed to the Batman films where the hero was lost among the villians and supporting characters. Garner is both beautiful and lethal as his love-interest. Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin doesn't have an awful lot to do, but he does make the most of his appearances as the man-mountian behind the crime syndicate.  Colin Farrell is probably the only actor in the film who camps things up a bit as Bullseye, but he succeeds in making him a character to be feared even when we chuckle at his quirks.
Director and screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson obviously has a love for the material, having adapted it from the classic Frank Miller-written comics.  He also keeps the film going at a good clip, keeping the film at just over 100 minutes.  However, it would've been nice to see some character motivations more fleshed-out.  The plotline where Joe Pantoliano's newspaper reporter is looking to expose Daredevil is practically glossed over and it would've been nice to see more of the Kingpin's motivations. But this is mere quibbling on my part.  Johnson and his cast treat the material with respect and the film is never allowed to drag. Indeed, it succeeds where the last 2 Batman films failed in presenting its dark hero.  While DAREDEVIL probably won't reach the heights achieved by SPIDER-MAN, it is still a worthy entry in the superhero derby. Definitely one to recommend.",1045180800,,2809,4.89873417721519
2277677,5,B0009B0GYA,I was wondering how long it would take to see Frank Miller's version of Daredevil to become a major motion picture.  Although some things have been changed and Bullseye has no costume it's a very good film.  It is more realistic than Spiderman and I'd like to say much better. I think this would make a great TV series because DD fights contemporary criminals like the Kingpin and other parasites of society.  Let's hope we see them again in some type of series.  Daredevil like Spiderman deserves a sequel.,1045180800,,507,4.662921348314606
2277678,2,B0009B0GYA,"Most of the reviews I had read already here were actually based on viewing the trailer of Daredevil, and ended with the words ""I'm sure the movie will be great.""
Yeah, i saw that trailer too.  It ....
In a way, it's sad.  I spent the first hour thinking ""it'll improve soon. Really.  Just as soon as the flashback stops/ Jennifer Garner turns up/ Bullseye appears.""  How can i put this - it DIDN'T.
The first warning is the title sequence (yes, it's that bad), curiously reminiscent of.. Spiderman! Surprise. Not the last time I would be thinking that, either.
OK, nice first image; gothic, creepy.  That red leather isn't *quite* working, but it's early days, right...?
Wrong. Cue a, what, 20 minute flashback that exists purely to pile sentimental ... upon more sentimental ....  I'm not caring already.  The trailer sold me cool fights... um, don't expect a ... thing until the childhood trauma is well and truly driven home with a sledgehammer.  And the really sad thing?  It's nothing new. It's nothing we haven't seen a billion times before, better acted, and most definitely better scripted.
After the sentimental stuff, a couple of flashes of how good this could have been, given a little talent: the rendering of the 'radar' sense (whilst entirely illogical) is clever and cinematically works. It's new, it's *different*.
Here, the plot departs from logic with screaming haste.  Yes, we understand little Matt has the radar-sense-thingy.  We do not understand, and are never offered any explanation for, why he is suddenly as agile as Spidey. Only, y'know, lacking any visible webslinging powers. Note to the cack-handed scriptwriter/ director: THIS MAKES NO SENSE. It so obviously exists purely to provide 'cool' visuals in the fight scenes that, quite frankly, aren't even done very well.
Moving swiftly on... I don't remember Ben Affleck ever being quite this dire. After an embarrassingly bad courtroom scene, the first action set piece is.. yup, pretty dire. The leather outfit gets worse by the moment. The requisite cool visuals are completely obscured half the time, which left me blinking in confusion as to who or what was supposedly getting their ... kicked.  I was still blinking in confusion a minute later, when I realised someone had been watching the subway scene from The Matrix a little too often... and then comes a little character development that makes me wonder why this guy is our hero, exactly.
Still, that little spark of hope remains... the script perks up with the entrance of Jon Favreau.  The guy's funny, he gets a couple of decent lines, and hey, Elektra's about to turn up...
*shudder*  Jennifer Garner can act. Jennifer Garner can fight convincingly on screen. I know this, having sat through a season of Alias.  Guess what?  This script (and fight choreography) doesn't seem to agree.  I kept expecting her to break into one of Sydney's tortured speeches (anything being better than the drivel that passes for character development in this) but no.  The initial showdown between her and Matt in a kid's playground is so barkingly nonsensical that I was staring at the screen in disbelief.
And so on and so forth.  It's not even enjoyably bad; it just keeps setting up potentially cool scenarios, only to fail to see them through.  In some ways, it does perk up when Bullseye shows up.  A barely recognisable Colin Farrell gurns his way through as a manic little leprechaun who can't miss a shot to kill anyone with *anything* (old lady with peanut was a classic.  In a completely amoral way...).  Kingpin is, frankly, a bit underwhelming.  On the plus side, some fairly decent songs are used to drown out the bad acting most of the time.. the soundtrack looks half decent, considering...
The Valentine day opening means one trailer campaign focuses on the romantic pairing of Matt and Elektra, which is ironic given that this is one of the least convincing screen romances I've ever seen.  She likes him because.. um, well, cos he's blind? He likes her because, hey, she's hot. And she can kick .... For Absolutely No Apparent Reason. I'm guessing a whole chunk of backstory got ditched along the way, but what is unforgiveable is the waste of the only source of tension this plot has in their relationship.  Far as I can see, this should have been what the plot hinged upon. As it is, it's meaningless and shallow, aiming to set up a sequel far too lazily.
That's a prospect that really irritates me: a sequel to a film that managed to spend this much money on such an awful script and bad direction (the same guy being responsible for both should give you a clue).  I spent half the plot wondering if anyone had bothered to proofread the script before they went into production, as it unashamedly and amateurly ... half a dozen better movies without drawing breath (mainly Spiderman and the Matrix).  Sure, girls may go to drool over Ben Affleck, but the guy has never looked less attractive (get that flabby, unshaven chin beneath the halloween mask. *urgh*). Sure, guys may go for the action (hmm. Could do much, much better.) They'd all be better off staying home to watch Spiderman again, unfortunately.

But I did know who he was and who the characters are. This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be. The thing that shocked me the most was how dark this movie is. I can't believe it got away with a PG-13 rating. There's one scene in a bar where the music in the background uses very foul language while Bullseye is murdering a guy. This comes as a pleasant surprise to me as an adult but I worry about parents who take their young kids to see this movie about a super hero is a vigilante. The only thing I really did not like about DD was some of the action scenes. They used wire to help balance the actors and also allow them to make jumps that are not possible. That's fine but they did a horrible job making it look realistic. When a character jumps from one building to another it's as if they are landing on a cloud and they just keep on running before their feet even touch ground. They might as well have left the wire in the movie it's that obvious. But other than that I loved the story and can't wait for Daredevil 2.",1045180800,,1173,4.082251082251083

However, Ben looked pretty good in the DD costume! I guess red is his color. Another A+ for the movie. Instead of molded black rubber that show nipples and abs like the motion picture Batman & Robin (a tragedy in the superhero movies line up)Ben sports a garnet red leather jacket complete with pants boots and nightstick! Then theres Elektra played by the youthful Jennifer Garner who stars on ABC's Alias. Clad in a tight black clevage revealing outfit, Jennifer make a good villainess wielding two sharp daggers! Colin Farrell has his fame rising ever so more because he makes a great Bulleye. The fight scenes between him Elektra and DD should be pretty good. Bullseye's weapon of choice: little throwing stars not to be confused with Batarangs! And rounding up the bunch is Mr. Micheal Clark Duncan. And he is The Kingpin. Now in the comics Kingpin is a caucasian, but Mike isn't bad as the Kingpin. He can play a pretty mean part despite what others may say. That DEEP voice does it all! So basically in this movie you can expect, daggers,hi-tech nightsticks that can turn into grappling hooks, throwing stars and a man with a DEEP voice! Waalah! The potential of a good movie. With an all star cast, a love scene, matrix type fighting, and dark setting, Daredevil should certainly be a great movie! I cannot wait to get it on DVD!",1045180800,,1510,4.5962962962962965

Anyway, I gave this movie three stars because it was not fantastic, but it didn't completely blow.  Just go into this movie looking for lots of fun unrealistic action.  Two things save this movie.  1) Jennifer Garner, who looks amazing,
2)Colin Farrel, who is pretty funny as bullseye.  I won't tell you much about the story because you probably already know it, but there's really not much to tell.  Bad guy versus good guy.

2277682,4,B0009B0GYA,"First, I have to state that I am a bit of a comic book freak for more than 20 years now; so, it's kind of hard to satisfy me in comparison to a ""normal"" viewer as far as comic-adaption movies are concerned...
Nevertheless, ""Daredevil"" was a surprise to me! Yes, I did NOT want to have Ben Affleck as the title hero, yes, I think that J. Garner is NO Elektra, yes, I want to see Bullseye with his mask and NOT with a scar on his forehead and yes, MY kingpin is a white meatball (or -mountain rather)!
BUT: the guys did a pretty good job! Not only is the Daredevil of the movie the kind of hero who is dark, full of hate and longing for his kind of justice (=revenge), but B. Affleck really (yes, really) plays him quite well. If you are able to forget the blonde Matt Murdock of the comics, you will see a well-drawn character!
About the coustumes? I hated them when I first saw them on pictures and even more when I saw the trailer!! Guess what? You're getting used to all the leather and the attempts to connect the (old style of the) comics to the new century.
And the story? Well, it seems to me like the pilot episode of an ongoing series... and that doesn't has to be bad after all as long as you've seen enough to yearn for more!
So, and for all the comic-books fans out there: besides the cameos of Stan ""The Man"" and Kevin Smith, watch out for the names of some of the characters mentioned in the movie: does ""Bendis"", ""Romita"", ""Quesada"", ""Miller"", etc. ring a bell??!! ;-)",1045180800,,1482,4.203508771929824

Like many superheroes before him, Matt Murdock leads a double life.  In one of those lives, he defends the innocent in court.  In the other he is known as the Daredevil, a vigilante who takes the law into his own hands and punishes those that take advantages of the loopholes in the justice system.  The unique thing about Murdock is that he is blind, an unfortunate result from a childhood chemical accident.  To compensate the loss of sight, the rest of his four senses are consequently heightened to help him navigate his environment, acting like radar that works in a similar way to the bat sonar.
""A man without fear is a man without hope.""
Surprisingly, Daredevil isn't a simple crime fighting fare or a showcase of good vs. evil.  Beneath those familiar themes is a struggle with the meaning of justice and revenge.  As expected, the obligatory introduction for the protagonist is there for the benefit of those that are not familiar with the comic.  Even though one can't really fault these sequences for being formulaic (i.e. guy gets hurt, guy obtains superhuman abilities, and guy learns how to perfect these skills), suffice to say the movie does an adequate job of presenting the character of Daredevil to the audiences.
I admit to having doubts when hearing Ben Affleck is to don the costume as Daredevil, he just does not look like the superhero type to me.  However, as the film progressed, I became more and more convinced that while he may not be perfect for the role, he did a fantastic job with it.  Affleck was able to translate Murdock's loneliness, his playfulness and his inner struggles to the screen.  He is a complex hero filled with the most basic of human needs, he is as fallible as you and me, and he does not always make the right choices.  The lovely Jennifer Garner plays the tough and resilient Elektra, Murdock's love interest in the movie.  I really appreciate the time taken to develop their relationship with each other, and the chemistry between the two leads is definitely there.
The characterizations of the villains, on the other hand, were rather weak.  This is not to say that the performances by Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin and Colin Farrell as Bullseye were bad, but little screen time were devoted to them to flesh out these personalities, which could be the intention of the director for all we know.  Nevertheless, the supporting cast is a strong one; I especially liked Jon Favreau in the part of Murdock's good-humored partner, Franklin Nelson.
The veteran Hong Kong master Cheung-Yan Yuen (brother to Woo-Ping) provides the action choreography, evident in the amount of wirework present in the movie.  Personally, I think the film benefited from such collaboration, and it certainly made the fighting sequences much more exciting and stylish to watch.  However, some of the editing of the said scenes left a lot to be desired, for example, the confrontation in the bar at the beginning was hectic and poorly lit, it is hard to appreciate what you cannot see.
Not a comic reader myself, I cannot say whether Daredevil is a faithful adaptation of the source material, but I can tell you that I enjoyed every minute of it.  The movie is not without faults, yet I truly believe that it is everything Spider-Man was and more.  It has action for the guys and romance for the women, come to think of it, Daredevil may not be a bad choice to spend part of your Valentine's Day.  It is fun, charming, and a touch sinister.  I really think Marvel has another success in its hands.  Be sure to sit through the credits, there is an additional scene you don't want to miss.",1044921600,,3664,4.702660406885759
2277684,5,B0009B0GYA,"Forget Ben Affleck, the guy is getting married--soon.  Well, maybe not so soon.  Anyway, just see this movie to check out the spankin' new Hollywood Golden Boy, Irish heartrob Colin Farrell.  The man is as hot as chili wings in Palm Springs.  Grindin'!  Plus he has the acting abilities of a seriously talented actor (STA), as you can see in 'Tigerland' and 'Minority Report'--come on, how many people can actually stare down Tom Cruise and take on Ben Affleck?  With moves on big blockbusters like 'Minority Report' and 'Daredevil', you have to figure the guy is gonna end up in the stardom slot.
To give 'Daredevil' its due, however, the movie does look pretty good.  Ben Affleck, a DD fan himself, seems to be a convincing choice for the Man Without Fear, and 'Alias' chick Jennifer Garner's moves on the big screen come off pretty well.  Overall, this movie is built like a serious blockbuster, with lead Affleck and spy chick Garner doing the usual karate action (See how 'The Matrix' has everyone trapped inside it! 'Reloaded' & 'Revolutions' 2003!  Whoo-hoo!).  It's obvious that this movie wants to become the next 'Spider-man'.  Who knows?  Perhaps it will, through the loyalty of DD's fans + Mr. Affleck's rabid fan club + 'Alias' groupies + at least one person in the world who goes to see Colin Farrell make his argument for super-stardom (that would be me, for all those with the seemingly low IQs).  Add these elements together, set the temperature for smoking hot, and 'Daredevil' will find an audience...and perhaps a franchise.",1043884800,,1544,4.847328244274809
2277685,5,B0009B0GYA,"I have been a fan of Daredevil since the age of 7. I went to the local comic-book store and picked up the Born Again TPB and had my mother buy it for me and I have read over 50 times since. I have collected everything I could find on DD ever since. I mean, I would save my lunch money and birthday money to buy DD comics. I have a treasury full of DD TPBs, back issues, and Volume 2 issues. As well as toys, mags featuring him, and the Daredevil Vs. Spiderman animated DVD pre-ordered. Get this, I payed 7.15 for a matinee to ""Just Married"" so my girlfriend and and my friends could see the new DD trailer.
  So, you could imagine how much I want to see this film...a lot! Everything about it (except the slow and dismal marketing campaign) amazes, it is how I would make a Daredevil motion picture. Ben Affleck=DD fanboy=perfect Matt Murdock. Colin Farrell is perfect as the coolest villian ever: the  insane Bullseye! Jennifer Garner is sexy and smooth as a cool and leather-clad Elektra. Skin color does not matter to me, even though the Kingpin in the comics was a white guy, I couldn't think of anyone better than the inspired Michael Clark Duncan. Duncan is an electrifying, yet terrifying, actor and should light up the screen with intensity and menace.
  We have a devil, a psycho, a kingpin, and ninja all in one film! And the trailer showed us so much, like Scott Terra in the role of a 12 year-old Murdock. He shows great promise. The story is rumored to be based on the Elektra/Bullseye saga, which is a lot to squeeze into one film, which kind of worries me, but who cares!
Best lines from the new trailer:
Kingpin:""Is there anything else?""
Bullseye:""Yeah....I want a costume!""
-and-
Daredevil:""Time to give the devil his due!""

The actors were okay, but I liked those on the series better. And a film can give you only so much back story.",1525305600,,271,3.9454545454545453

8058946,5,B0009B0GYA,"Where to begin? Ben Afleck is comically gifted beyond is acting years (at this point in his career)  and delivers a peak early 2000s clinic on Hollywood heros. Combined with the dry sexual tension of a quickly written love affair with at the time soon to be wife Capital One lady this movie screams future power couple. The late Michael Clarke Duncan provides the role of exposition baddie but is over shadowed by an over the top performance by Colin Farrel's insane irishman version of bullseye. Now departures from comic book cannon not withstanding (Daredevil actually killing a common street hood, slightly different take on the aforementioned love plot, minor creative liberties on origin story) this movie brings all the lack luster glow of ones childhood of that era. Over the top violence that dosent actually meet the spice contents level due to sanitization by the studio, that one scene from the matrix where time slows down and the hero limbs past projectiles,and all the teenage angst of a sound track heavy on 2000's staple Evanessence, not to mention an even worse train wreck of a spin off that followed in Elektra all go to make this a solid piece of nostalgia to ten if you comic book movies are in a better place now. 5 stars.",1520985600,,1245,4.7373271889400925

8058949,3,B0009B0GYA,"The acting and cinematography were excellent.  The story was okay but the superhero origination story was SO glossed over it made it  pointless ... even painful.  Introducing Electra in a first Daredevil movie took up valuable Daredevil time and didn't leave enough time to build her character.  It was Daredevil but at the 50,000 foot level.",1519516800,,342,5.053571428571429

8058952,5,B0009B0GYA,"I liked the original version, not the best movie ever, but enjoyable enough.  This cut definitely makes it much better compared to the theatrical cut.  I would definitely recommend it to Daredevil fans, who were not happy seeing it when it originally came out.  It just provides more to the story and character development to bring everything together.  At the same time, I'm not gonna pretend it's as good as the MCU Daredevil show on Netflix, but there've been many versions of comic book characters over the decades (ie - Hulk, Superman, Spider-Man, Batman, etc.) and this is a version worth checking out.",1513036800,,608,4.87378640776699
