7861760,1,6304040091,"You can add a star if for some reason you like this director's work.  However, this movie was very weak.  It was more-or-less a ""made for TV movie"" with occasional nudity.  Even that isn't fair, as many of today's TV movies are MUCH better than this.  Adrienne Barbeau?  She has a handful of over-acted, poorly-delivered lines.  And no; she isn't disrobed at any point in the movie for all of you Adrienne Barbeau fans who were hoping.",1381190400,,435,4.584415584415584

7861764,3,6304040091,"Quick to be buried in my collection that is. I pick this up a while back on used VHS thankfully. I was a fan of Stoker's other works. But this was just beyond weird. The story centers around a group of ""Rat Women"" who, of course, hate men. Who use rats to kill men. They take a young Stoker captive, try to execute him, fail and put him in the dungen. So what is a man to do in a place filled by women who hate men? Join them and fall in love with one of them of course. What do the women do for entertainment you ask? Have a group of women dance around top-less backed by classical music, wrote by who? Men. Well the queen has Bram write about there explots and because of his eagerness to write has them raid a brothel where his love is captured, and that is the point where the movie starts to come to a close. The fight scences are way below par, the women fight better that the trained army. The story sounds promeseing but in the end is roiting with plot holes, and fails to delver. The three stars is for the queen the actoress does a good job as ""The Pide Piper's twisted sister"" A rental is sugesed unless you want to watch a movie where women run around in thongs or less throughout the whole movie.",1157587200,,1209,4.084033613445378
7861765,3,6304040091,"Adrienne Barbeau plays a scantily-clad dancer who can control the minds of rats and calls herself The Queen of Vermin. When aspiring author Bram Stoker (Kevin Alber) is kidnapped by her secret cult of (also scantily-clad and dancing) women, he agrees not only to write of their exploits but also to aid in the killing of ""piggish"" males. Men aren't the only ones targeted by the evil queen: When a rodent with four left feet can't keep up with her flute music, she puts the rat's head in a tiny guillotine and ruthlessly severs it. He's like the Marie Antoinette of rats. Need I mention that Burial of the Rats was produced by the infamous schlock-meister Roger Corman? Based upon a short story by Bram Stoker.

7861766,3,6304040091,"Last weekend I saw a strange film called Bram Stoker's Burial of Rats.  This is a film that at first seems like a cross between Lair of the White Worm and some of the newer Lovecraft films.
Burial of Rats opens with Bram Stoker and his father riding in a coach and arguing Bram's future.  Bram wants to be a writer.  Before their argument can develop too far, their carriage is waylaid by bandits and rats.  Bram saves his father by shooting one of the bandits.  Bram is captured and the father is left behind.  While Bram's father goes to the authorities and is told to consider his son dead, Bram is taken to the secret lair of the bandits.
The bandits are women.  They are under the slightly-mad leadership of their queen who is quite well played by Adrienne Barbeau.  The Queen is described as the Pied Piper's twisted sister (she has a flute with which she can control rats).  Because he killed one of their number, Bram is slated for execution.  He only survives because one bandit realizes that he only acted to save his father.  This touches her deeply as she was unable to save her own family.  She then goes on to aid Bram's cause.  When the Queen learns of Bram's aspirations of writing, she commands that he chronicle their raids to better sow fear into the hearts of men.  Thus Bram becomes a part of the raids.
Through some plot twists and clever arguments, the rat women are led to greater victories and ultimately to their demise.  In the end only Bram and his father escape alive.  Then just as the film is closing, Bram's father gives Bram his blessing to become a writer.
A pretty fun movie all around.  Adrienne Barbeau does an excellent job of playing the Rat Queen.  Visually the film is quite odd.  The rat women tend to wear fur bikinis complete with little tails.  The Queen presides from an opulent throne room located beneath the ruins of a palace.  There are several scenes of celebration where topless dancers perform for the Queen.  Just how these displays fit in with the women trying to end male oppression is only vaguely hinted at.  While this film does much to promote the cause of women, it also pokes fun at men in power but the film was obviously planned with a male audience in mind.",1088380800,6,2222,4.472636815920398
