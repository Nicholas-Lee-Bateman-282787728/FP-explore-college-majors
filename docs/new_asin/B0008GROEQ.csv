8056308,4,B0008GROEQ,"Based on a review I read somewhere on Amazon I purchased all three Rough Rider DVD's in Critics Choice ""Digitally Restored"" versions to replace my Alpha copies. It was a waste of money, I can't tell a bit of difference in them. Some of the movies are a LITTLE better than others but none of them are great. These are super westerns, well written, acted, directed and deserve much better than this. The ""Digitally Restored"" is very misleading. The Hopalong Cassidy films by Platinum are still the best I have seen, clear, sharp, bright and good sound.",1260576000,,550,4.680412371134021
8056309,4,B0008GROEQ,"This Critics' Choice DVD of the famous Monogram trio Series, The Rough Riders, contains the last
two (of eight) features starring Buck Jones, Tim McCoy, and Raymond Hatton.  If not the best two,
these were certainly up to the high standard maintained throughout, and in this case the CCD edition
has decent sight and sound--not always the case in Triple Feature #2.
  ""Dawn on the Great Divide,"" the third western in this set, also features Buck Jones, who died in a
terrible night club fire before it was released.  Tim McCoy had gone to war, to be replaced by Rex Allen.
But even though the character played by Allen, Jack Carson, entered the story independently, Sandy Hopkins
(Hatton) was now Buck Roberts' (Jones) explicit partner from the beginning.  More important, the scenes
shifted from the familiar Monogram Ranch to broader and more richly timbered settings, the usual writer and director came forth with a more adult and complex story, and the result was a sincere effort at an
A-western. There are several important women in the story, including one who dies in childbirth, and
another who aims to establish a gambling house. The marauding Indians turn out to be white thugs in
disguise.  And ""Buck Roberts"" shows serious symptoms of falling in love.  In this edition we are treated
to two musical numbers, both sung by the youngest of the heroines, ""Rock of Ages,"" and ""Beautiful
Dreamer.""  I bought this and Triple Feature #2 to see if I liked the Rough Riders as much as I did over sixty years ago; as expected, I do.  But ""Dawn on the Great Divide"" proved something quite different--a fine bonus.",1186963200,2,1614,4.79783393501805
8056310,1,B0008GROEQ,"Very bad resolution - Buck Jones was my boyhood idol and it was a shame to see this movie of him in a film in such a bad condition. Box said ""Digitally Restored"" - but I very much doubt that -  due to the terrible resolution.",1171238400,5,225,3.891304347826087
8056311,5,B0008GROEQ,"If you like old westerns, you'll enjoy this movie, they always have plenty of action. You don't have good western movies anymore hardly, these old one's are always in style. You will enjoy this one.",1168300800,,198,4.685714285714286
