616920,5,630329328X,"Very enjoyable update of the classic Lassie film, even if the villain of the piece is so stereotypical it's laughable (he uses guns and chews tobacco, so he must be a bad guy, right?). Gorgeous scenery filmed on location in West Virginia and the kids aren't goodie-goodies but reasonably real children. Richard Farnsworth is wonderfully warm as the grandfather. A big plus is the score by Basil Poledoris, which I enjoyed so much I bought it on CD after the film was released.",1069459200,10,476,4.746987951807229

Maybe some acting lessons to get rid of that awful New Jersey accent?!  PLEASE?!  Seriously though, this movie is filled with actors who show no emotion, it's set in such drabness that I can not imagine viewing it with it's targeted audience... CHILDREN.  A child would have to be comatose to watch this (OR this film could make a child comatose!).  Please do your child a favor and leave this one on the shelf!!",985132800,,560,4.4411764705882355

Even though his stepmother(Helen Slater in one of her best performances) tries to be there for him no matter what, he finds a true friendship and love with a dog named Lassie! With this very new version of Lassie, they treated the legend very fair, and showed us a clip from the old Lassie TV show! You will love this film!",984441600,3,544,4.396039603960396
616924,5,630329328X,I have to say I am not a fan of dogs. But Lassie suprised me. I promised myself that if I was ever forced to have a dog I would choose Lassie. Lassie is my favourite movie.

617191,5,630329328X,This movie was filmed in my county near my home here in Southwest Virginia. I found out when our town recently started doing movie night and chose this movie as the first showing since several of the extras in the movie still live here. We lived in another state when it was filmed so I had no idea. We ended up not being able to go see it at the town's showing so I bought it on here. My kids loved this movie. I love the scene when the family wakes up in the morning after having arrived in town on a cold rainy night and they all look out their separate windows and are taken aback by the beautiful view. We have that same view of the mountain range behind our house and it is one of the many reasons we enjoy living here. If we did not live here we would still love this movie. It has a really great plot. There are moments when I was crying like a baby. This movie is very underrated. It should have been a new classic yet I had never even heard they did a remake of Lassie. Just such a great story. The only think I did not like about the movie was how unbelievable the bad guy in the movie was for this area. He seemed like he rode in from Texas or something. lol,1450137600,,1170,3.961864406779661

617305,4,630329328X,"In a throwback to the first Lassie film and the early TV series, Lassie once again adopts a young boy and positively affects his life with love and loyalty.

Sure, nitpickers will say it's not an original plot, but the tried and true formula works well here.  The scenery is beautiful, the human acting competent (with one exception), and we see the most cosmetically beautiful Lassie to date.  Knowing that this dog is a direct descendant of the original, being handled by the original trainer's son, is just icing on the cake. The overall effect is heartwarming and sentimental.

The one character I found to be poorly acted was that of the villain, a neighboring rancher.  His portrayal is a cheap caricature in a part that could have been made much more complex.  Fortunately, his impact on the film as a whole is minimal.

If you love Lassie, you'll be in good hands and familiar territory.",1420588800,2,895,4.698717948717949

617547,4,630329328X,"This is the best of the Lassie movies I have seen, probably because it is modern (1994) compared to the old Lassie movies I watched on TCM. There is a few scenes that have mild language, so you may want to preview this movie before you show it to your family. For most teens and adults, I think this movie is OK. The plot was good, except the bad rancher along with his sons who stole the horses should have been showed to get some kind of punishment for their crime. The acting was better than average. I liked the kid played by Thomas Guiry and the grandfather, played by Richard Farnsworth. The DVD video quality is good. The DVD audio quality is good with no noticeable distortion on my stereo system.",1285718400,2,705,4.348484848484849
617548,4,630329328X,"I wouldn't call this movie one the family will enjoy over and over again, because there's no such thing, but it's a movie that younger kids will like. I watched it a couple years ago, not really expecting much, and it's got more heart than you think. Okay, so it's painfully predictable and cheesy at parts, and not to mention corny. But it's pure fluff. It's meant to be an innocent feel-good film, and it's not half-bad at that.

The acting is fine, and the scenery is beautiful. And naturally, our main character, the dog, is gorgeous. What Lassie isn't? So a basic plot, a predictable ending, but touching at some parts, and good enough to keep your screaming toddlers and younger kids occupied. A little bit of language, if you're a prude, but hey, if your kid watches this and says, ""Faggot"", it's not worth getting mad over.

Not really worth the buy, but worth the watch to decide if your kids like it enough. Just remember: pure fluff. Nothing more.",1274659200,2,958,4.563953488372093
617549,5,630329328X,"I always loved Lassie as a kid, we even had a collie named Lassie. Anyway, my daughter who is 10yrs loves dogs, stuffed animals, books, movies you name it. When she heard that Lassie was a show and movies I use to watch she wanted to see them. I know this is a more updated version but she really enjoyed it.",1274486400,,308,4.065573770491803
617550,5,630329328X,"Many critics have said this movie doesn't stack up to previous Lassie films.  Well, certainly nothing can compare to the original ""Lassie Come Home"" and its several sequels.  While the Lassie in this 1994 movie was not trained by Lassie's original trainer, that does not take away from the quality of the movie.  The classic elements of a boy and his dog are still there.  Lassie helps his young companion adjust to life in the country and not surprisingly becomes his new best friend.  There is plenty of action, adventure and excitement as Lassie helps bring together a widower, his two children and his new wife while they move to the childhood home of his deceased wife who also owned a Collie named Lassie.  Overall a wonderful and fun movie to watch.

Hopefully this movie will inspire reading more of the classic Albert Payson Terhune Collie novels and watching the old classic Lassie films as well.  They simply don't lose their appeal!  I guess that's why they're classics :)

617551,1,630329328X,"Beautiful scenery and a decent family movie except that we're returning it to the seller because we can't imagine showing our kids a movie with ""go to hell"" and ""faggot"" spoken by child characters!! Also several fistfights, a scary wolf scene and lots of guns and death. Beware all you parents of sensitive, empathetic children like ours. Who rated this movie PG?!!",1229904000,10,365,4.903225806451613
617552,4,630329328X,"It is somewhat dishonest to call this a 'Lassie' film. This film never excited in me the same feelings as many of the older Lassie films. However, there are some positive aspects to this film.

  First, Lassie (1994) is considerably more contemporary than most 'Lassie' films yet has a collie as the hero. (This might interest children ages 8 through 13 who enjoy action and dogs.)

  Second, the film has a theme I appreciate - a theme of reaching out to others when others treat you cruely or degradingly.

  Third, the film kept my attention more than other Lassie films or films with canine stars.

  [While I enjoyed Old Yeller and Air Bud (1998), many dog films such as The Shaggy Dog (both 1959 and 2006), Where the Red Fern Grows, Shiloh, Far From Home, etc. either were incredible unrealistic or failed to keep my attention for long.]

  However, there is merit in the response, ""This film is too violent and uses foul language."" While this Lassie film is no Stand By Me or Jaws, it isn't Mr. Roger's Neighborhood either. Some words are included in this film that parents may not appreciate their five year olds hearing, and some scenes (while not very violent) have undertones that are more likely to 'scare' parents than children.

  I do not desire to give away the plot to the reader. However, the film begins with Lassie's real owner being killed in a tractor-trailer accident on wet roads. Based on this description, it is possible for the reader to further realize this is not a ""sugar-coated"" motion picture.

  Overall, I would recommend this film to parents who have allowed their children to view 101 Dalmatians (live action) and/or films such as To Kill a Mockingbird. However, for parents with young children, Lassie films such as Lassie Come Home (1943) and Lassie (2006) might be more children friendly.",1196380800,15,1827,4.754777070063694

617626,4,630329328X,"Matt is a journor high student who's family is moving from Baltimor to the country farm in Virginia where his late mother grew up. The bitterness and resentment, as well as the goodness, deep inside of Matt's heart, are realisically portayed as he relates to his Dad, his sister, and Laura, his step-mom. Lassie, a stray the family takes in, soon finds her way into the withdrawn boy's heart, and helps him change into the responsible, intelligent, and warmhearted young man he was meant to be. But their new-life in the country threatens to unravel when the construction job that Matt's Dad moved there for falls through. But Matt encourages his Dad to hold onto the farm, and try raising sheep on their pasture land (which is the best for miles around), with Lassie's help. A touching family movie, with convincing and crisp acting, emotion, and drama. Makes you laugh and cry. The slang has changed a lot since the 90's, however, giving this movie a slightly out-moded feel. Is it just me, or do teenagers really say ""cool"" anymore? I'm a teenager and I still do, but I think most teengers say ""awesome"" or ""rad"". But even if this isn't a classic, it's a show I'll always like.",1155772800,5,1180,4.650717703349282

So a new version of the movie has helped carry the tradition on some.  This isnt' a great movie, but it is enjoyable and heart warming at times. The scenery is beautiful where it was filmed, which is what makes it very special to me. I grew up in the area - the old country store in the movie was about 2 miles from my home and I went to school for a year at the school used in the movie (it's no longer used as a school).  The movie also says something to young folks about living and growing up in a more rural area - it is quite different from the city and the family discovers this in the course of the movie.  As always, one wishes there was in real life a dog like Lassie who knows everything and always survives the disasters that strike.
