6997147,5,B00SZ0ANSG,"Stylistically, the film recalls the early 70s cinema of Nicolas Roeg (Walkabout, Man Who Fell To Earth) and perhaps one or two of Altman's more obscure classics (Images, 3 Women). It also recalls some of the lower-grade European art films of the time (that dealt with similar subject matter).

The film is set in no particular time or place, however, judging by the fashion and mode of transport I think most would say this dream of life is situated in 1890 or early 1900. This strange film world is populated only by well-to-do middle-aged women who ride around on bicycles and spend their days studying the regions moths and each other. Each woman seems to live alone in her own ancient chateau (or with one other woman). And whenever the women of this region attend one of the lectures given by one of the local moth experts they
all sit very still and listen intently to the scientific data but also stare lasciviously at each other as they do so.  Its like they are all wild creatures barely contained by the restraints of the world in which they live (even though it does seem that it is they themselves who have very carefully crafted these restraints).  Everything about this world (from dress to social behavior) seems to be codified/ritualized in a way that is designed to extract the maximum degree of pleasure from each thing.  Even the intimate relationships between pairs of women seem to have
been codified/ritualized/scripted to such an extent that there is almost no room for spontaneity.  On the surface it is all very beautiful
(exquisite houses and gardens and clothes), but on some level it is also utterly suffocating.

Several times throughout the film one of the characters mentions that she is living the life she has always dreamed of living (a life wherein she writes the script and has complete control over every aspect of the world she lives in from wardrobe to story.... a life wherein she controls
what everyone does and says.....). There is something triumphant about this but there is also something extremely melancholy about it as
 well as the film points to how isolated the self becomes as it tries to forge a world (a fabricated reality) apart from the everyday one.

Ultimately, the film offers us two entwined metaphors that comment on the artist temperament and artistic pursuit.  The study of moths that is threaded throughout the film highlights the need for an obsessive focus and the dominant/submissive sexuality highlights the need for both utter control and utter surrender to that singular focus/vision.",1444694400,2,2553,4.877598152424942
6997148,4,B00SZ0ANSG,"This highly atmospheric British drama follows the very quirky yet erotic D/s relationship between a weak dominant and her bossy little sub.  It is set primarily at a Gothic estate somewhere in Europe long ago (where no men or even automobiles are ever seen)... where these two women seem to spend all their time attending butterfly/moth lectures and role-playing their D/s fantasies.

I was taken within the first five minutes by both the beautiful cinematography and the very excellent score... both of which brought me back to some old 70s horror and old Euro-erotica, lol. Loved it. Not to mention my first introduction of these two. They give quite the initial impression that they've got this lifestyle down. Cynthia (Sidse Babett Knudsen) is an aging beauty with a lovely derrire, stunning legs, and just the right sternness to intimidate as a sexy Mistress. And little Evelyn (Chiara D'Anna) is very believable as her vulnerable and frightened little submissive as she goes about screwing everything up as the house maid in hopes of being punished.

But we soon find that things are not as they seem. These two have issues, lol. It seems the Mistress would rather be in a more conventional relationship where she doesn't have to be so perfect and in control... she'd much rather wear comfy clothes, tend to her bad back, and have her lover in bed beside her (and not in a trunk as punishment lol) while she snores unattractively away. But the slightly sinister little sub isn't having any of that and is more than a little obsessed at encouraging these roles. Ultimately, her ""Domme"" only wants to please, lol.

Not exactly sure WHAT the butterflies meant, lol, but the Duke of Burgundy is a type of butterfly.  Between the kooky and ever-present butterfly imagery and the long, lingering camera work tryin' to be all artsy (it was lol... but it kept making me laugh)... there is some interesting commentary here about power dynamics and role-playing... and the oddities and dysfunctions that might arise in a D/s relationship.  It's very sensual and erotic, but there is no nudity or graphic sex... it's all blurred and obscured in artsy camera work, which was fine by me... some things I did not want a visual of anyway, lol (e.g., the bathroom scenes, ack).

Enjoyable and engaging but darkly humorous and strange, even surreal.",1444521600,,2338,4.888888888888889
6997149,3,B00SZ0ANSG,"What could be more erotic than a tale about two women entwined in a Dominant/submissive relationship?

Well, since you ask, pretty much any episode of The Simpsons. Because this is actually about how not to enjoy a D/s relationship. There's a term in the community called ""topping from below"" which means a situation in which the nominal submissive is actually controlling the show. And that's what we have here to a degree that is actually both very funny and poignantly anti-erotic.

So the movie is a sort of bait-and-switch. The come-on is the promise of erotic D/s and the reality is.... the tedium and banality of a situation in which the submissive calls all the shots and the ""dominant"" partner is not really into it at all. But it's the submissive who owns the lovely house and who has all the money so the ""dominant"" has to dance to the tune the submissive sets out in hand-written prompt cards.

As the movie unfolds we develop quite a sympathy for the ""dominant"" partner. Suffering from a bad back, she's forced to wear a variety of uncomfortable clothes and totter around in high heels so that she can appear suitably Mistress-like. She also has to consume endless glasses of water so that the submissive partner can enjoy the thrill of being used as a human toilet. So the reality is that the ""dominant"" is really the one whose life is under control while the submissive one is actually the person with all the power.

Is this a witty critique of Hegelian philosophy or a wry comment on Hollywood (where whatever you see is by definition hopelessly unreal)? Or is it just a chance to have some fun with a clich&eacute; while pretending to the sort of pseudo-art credibility last attained by Peter Greenaway back in the 1980s? Whatever the case, this isn't The Story of O so much as The Story of Oh Why Bother...",1443830400,8,1825,4.640866873065016
6997150,5,B00SZ0ANSG,"Beautiful,artistic film,cleverly composed with two characters, one an orthopterist and the other her maid. Peter Strickland is a new writer-director with two previously praised films(Berberian Sound Studio and Katalan). The story of the two women is set somewhere in Europe(filmed in Hungary) in the 60s, in a cottage- mansion. Strickland has the temerity to unearth older genres from the European canon, here its erotic love and S&M using a kind of Europop, bicycles and lepidoptery. There is not a man to be seen, so the pure relationship between the mistress Cynthia(Sidse Babett Knudsen) who appears strict and demanding, and her maid /assistant Evelyn(Chiarra DAnna), is evident in all its guises. They even attend lectures on lepidoptery together.

We are in a realm of pure ritual as the seemingly dominant Cynthia sets Evelyn to do an endless rota of tasks: cleaning furniture, scrubbing floors, emptying rubbish, hand-washing underpants, polishing boots, massaging feet and her back. Something is always left undone, which leads to an endless round of punishments. The latter takes place behind closed doors, so we don't see Cynthia pee in Evelyns mouth, but we see her sitting on her face or locking her in a chest overnight until she calls  Pinastri. There are no naked scenes, they are two lovers who use role play, then come together at the days end in each others arms. Everything is suggested. Evelyn even spies on Cynthia disrobing and dressing in tight clothes, stockinged-legs through a keyhole.

There are shots to mounted butterflies and moths and eerie background music. Two other independent characters are a neighbour Lorna, who is disapproving of them, and a sales-woman who sells fetishistic objects manufactured to their taste. As well as Cynthia giving lectures they also read to each other at night and listen to records of insect noises. The follower is really the leader, making more and more
demands to be told off,or to be punished. Evelyn has a wandering eye and looks at other women- one who exhibits at the lectures and the fetishistic saleswoman. They speak of a bed where a lover sleeps on a lover, or a human toilet. Cynthia has a breakdown, she cant keep up the charade, her back is giving in, she snores,she wants to wear looser clothing. The night scenes are accompanied by a throbbing noise. There are scenes of opaque,abstract shots of light. There are superb shots of nature,wind in the trees, autumn leaves, languorous music.

Scenes at night suggest strange depths, moths fluttering around lamps or around a blind-folded face, Cynthias opened legs, a skeleton in a chest,the moonlight,screams in the night. We get images of a Brakhage-like intensity of moths wings and the associate sounds. As Evelyn saysto her mistress, Its all a luxury, what they are doing(as is the film), but declares her love for Cynthia, saying everythings fine. Strickland has tapped into the anxieties of any lovers,desiring to please their partners, with the ebb and flow of power, the exploration of discomfort that people will stretch to for the ones they love. Great acting from Knudsen and DAnna,brilliant direction from this budding auteur.",1442707200,3,3168,5.11003861003861

Both my partner and I were able to see this film at the 59th BFI London Film Festival in October 2014.

Possible Spoilers

The Duke of Burgundy is not really for fans of soft-core naughtiness.

Evelyn (Chiara D'Anna) is a housekeeper in the employ of Cynthia (Sidse Babett Knudsen, best known for playing the Danish Prime Minister in the television political drama Borgen), a keen collector of butterflies and moths who lectures at a local institute. On first impressions the dynamic seems straightforward where we seem to have curt and dominating employer with a somewhat submissive employee. While the premise of the narrative is their relationship and it's changing dynamic, there is a fair amount of close up filming, as well as specialist audio, relating to the topic of Lepidoptera, which is interesting - although both my partner and I were lost on the symbolism.

This film can be unpromising and deeply sensual while it explores the formalised but affectionate realms of fetishism. There is not a bit of nudity and most of the sexual acts are behind closed doors, or obscured by soft-focus. You, the viewer, are left with the audio and your imagination to fill in the `gaps'. The camera work, is at times soft focused, well lit and almost filmed in style that would be recognised from the 1970s. The scenes are further enhanced with mood and at times otherworldly setting music. Nevertheless, between those scenes it has an oddball sense of humour. It is a grounded film, and has dry humour - one where we are laughing at them for their sexual quirks rather than with them. Such as during an anxious discussion about the construction times of various extravagant bondage apparatus, the would-be creator of these imaginative contrivances is played by Fatma Mohamed, who offers, for the purposes of saving build time, the rapid construction of one gadget and suggests: ""Would a human toilet be of interest?"" There is a lot to appreciate here, mainly with the bold performances, the dress and lingerie by Andrea Flesch and it does raise thought-provoking ideas about the subtleties of control in relationships and sexual fulfilment. For this couple live in their own enclosed world and seem to only venture out to attend talks by the self-important Dr Schuller due to their mutual interest in entomology.

For this viewer the film was more a fable-like tale of two people locked into what looks like an ailing S&M relationship, but boiled down in its constituents it's about a relationship, based on trust and love. I am sure That Duke of Burgundy will certainly have its critics - but who cares?

6997153,5,B00SZ0ANSG,"This does contain spoilers.

Burgundy is an extraordinary study of an idealised relationship. Like the moths of the film, the two lovers are put in a glass case so we can stare at them. The film is a bit like music, drawing the viewer in with a beautifully rhythmic cinematography. It is well-crafted on all levels, great soundtrack, wonderful actresses, beautiful setting . . .

As the film is rated 18, and misinterpreting the preview, I thought Burgundy would be cheesily preoccupied with the sexual, supplying an audience predictable titillation. People expecting such a film may be disappointed. I was a bit wary of watching the film and it lay in wait for more than a year: I was pleased to be wrong.

This film is a beautiful study of the dynamics of power in a relationship, but more, it demonstrates (with a clever twist) that complexities of power, or roles, are not what they at first seem. By a few alienating devices the director creates a kind of fantasy world to magnify the lovers whirl. Solipsistically all exists to reaffirm and allude to their relationship, to iconize it  . . . Most of the film takes place in a kind of Adams Family house, in what could be the Black Forest, even in another time. (Spoiler) There are no men in the film. (Its interesting what this does to the feel of the film, and how it does not change dual / polar forces.) The moths in the film are filmed so magically they may as well be faeries. Everything about the film is beautiful. The music is like a blanket.

Through this use of alienating elements (singularly not fantastical *), the film becomes allegorical, insinuating other relationships, those of the neighbours, people who buy the same sex products, the women at the institute, have relationships with the same dynamics. This leads to the viewer guessing the closed world is not closed, representing something universal  what it means to be human.

The two lovers are in a snow globe of their own design, they cant escape their selves. There are a few things that may shake the spell, but nothing that will break it (and nothing nasty). Throughout the film, the viewers attention is focussed to observe how the dynamics of the relationship unfurl, what it means to share a life and to love. Because the story centres around this love, the unreal situation, or story, then becomes very real  the essence has been distilled and you can apply the lessons of give and take in a relationship to real life. And this is where the heart of the film lies, the expressions of the two characters and the developing emotions are shown to have an evolution.

(Im certainly not going to pay to see the Grey film.) S&M  are there any films that represent S&M correctly out there? I would think there are a lot of problems to overcome: societal reaction and definition. S&M can be role play, fun, in this case surely its not what its name suggests? Alternatively, if its truly sadistic or the opposite, then there are problems of consent, abuse or exploiting weakness or illness. Both extents of these possible definitions oppose each other, thus being the broadest of possible spectrums. As for the use of S&M in Burgundy, it is used as a guise of some sorts. As an exotic form of sexuality, it lends itself to the above mentioned fantastical elements. In its very definition S&M is also a good way of studying power in relationships. Perhaps the film deliberately chose S&M as something outside peoples norm to show that even S&M isn't out of the norm of certain human responses. Though the S&M is apparently central in the film, in writing the above, I think I demonstrate S&M is not the central theme: the underlying character motivations are central. As such the S&M becomes a bit of artifice, and though there possibly may be truisms the film may misrepresent S&M (?).

Cynthia was a sympathetic character; she had grown uncomfortable in her role and yearned for an ordinary love life. Evelyn was so wooden and strange, by the end of the film I wondered why Cynthia bothered with her.

6997178,4,B00SZ0ANSG,"Peter Strickland is a film maker who likes to do things differently - his last feature `Berberian Sound Studio' will mean you will never look at a vegetable the same way again. Here he takes on the theme of a sadomasochistic, lesbian relationship to examine how we all depend on each other and the inter dependencies that can occur to make relationships work. At the heart are two lovers Cynthia and Evelyn who seem to be in a very one sided relationship - one being mistress and one being badly used servant.

They are also both entomologists and give talks on moths and butterflies - the title `The Duke of Burgundy' is an actual butterfly orange and brown in colour and found in Europe and mostly Southern Britain. The moths also act as a metaphor in the case of being `drawn to a flame' scenario; but also the many butterflies pinned and mounted that occur throughout the film reflect the love/abuse relationship in that the very beauty that attracts some people cause them to act in cruel way to the object of desire.

This is not `Fifty Shades of Grey' the sex is all tastefully done off screen. It is also exceptionally beautifully filmed - in Hungary as it turns out. The attention to style and miniscule details is almost obsessive and worth every effort in terms of rewards for the viewer. It is though about relationships and what we will do for each other - even if it goes against our own particular grain. This is a film for those who appreciate arthouse but like it to have one foot in realism (at least) and as such is one I both enjoyed and can easily recommend.",1449964800,,1579,4.498257839721254
6997179,2,B00SZ0ANSG,"*MINOR SPOILER ALERT*

Creepy film, more reminiscent of a 1960's-70's horror/vampire flick. The acting is quite good, as is the cinematography. The dynamics between the two lovers are very disturbing. If you're looking for an underlying story, forget it. There really isn't one. The ending just kind of happens out of nowhere since there is nothing and no plot twist to resolve. Romance is replaced with repetitive role playing.

Since BDSM is way beyond my comfort zone, I made a resolution to make myself watch it. This is the depiction of a consensual sado/masochistic relationship between two adults. Granted, there are certainly plenty of people who will find this film very enjoyable. Having come from a background of childhood abuse, including molestation, I find it to be erotic. (Especially the mention of a human toilet! Yuck! To each his or her own, I guess.) I forced myself to watch the entire movie, but people with a similar background might want to think twice.

I kept asking myself what Cynthia was getting out of this. Especially while we watch her consume glass after glass of water, for obvious reasons. Evelyn comes off as immature and self-centered, demanding increasing attention to her needs while oblivious to her partner's rising discomfort.  In the final moments of the movie, there is a hint that Evelyn might be more open to what Cynthia wants, but the ending shows them continuing the same old patterns.",1449187200,,1434,4.98744769874477
