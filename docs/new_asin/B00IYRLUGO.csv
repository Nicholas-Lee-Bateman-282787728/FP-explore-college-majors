6305374,3,B00IYRLUGO,Far from perfect but if you don't go in expecting a masterpiece you may end up having a good time.,1422144000,,98,3.95
6305375,5,B00IYRLUGO,"I couldn't stop watching this film! Entertaining and hilarious, full of fun twists. If you like hotties, zombies, and/or stoner comedies, then this movie is totally your jam.",1419120000,7,174,5.25
6305376,3,B00IYRLUGO,"The coed, not the zombies.

Hilarious zombie flick mixed with college kids doing what they do in every single flick. Sex, drugs, science & zombies. I laughed heartily.  Nudity & rampant drugs & homages galore.",1418601600,2,209,4.942857142857143
6305377,2,B00IYRLUGO,The movie was not what I expected as far comedy or horror.,1413849600,,58,3.9166666666666665
6305378,4,B00IYRLUGO,"Excessive boobies add to the scenery, the zombie element is sort of pointless seeing as how the zombies just smoke weed and get the munchies for human flesh. But all and all. boobies every ~15 seconds, nerdy hot girl with glasses, and a humans getting fisted by humans while the zombies watch. Only negative, not into movies about frat boys.  4/5.",1410220800,9,347,4.688524590163935
6305379,4,B00IYRLUGO,"I am embarrassed to say I liked this film. This is an uneven teen sex comedy with zombies. The story centers around Chrissy (Catherine Annette) a nerdy co-ed who talks too much. Her D-I-K Frat boyfriend (Aaron Caleb ) breaks up with her and by the house rules she must have a Frat boyfriend or leave and ""sell her eggs"" to stay in college according to Bambi (Jamie ""motor boat"" Noel) the house owner. Chrissy meets Rigo ""he needs to get some sun"" Fabian (Grant O'Connell) one night while working in the lab. Rigo is a docile zombie who stays docile from smoking pot. Cashing in on a favor, Chrissy manages to get him into the ZBE frat. Needless to say things get out of hand.

For the guys there is a wet T-shirt contest and naked run. The film has take offs from other films. Three that I noticed were the Baby Ruth scene from ""Caddy Shack""; the line up and slap scene from ""Airplane""; and the Delta Deathmobile from ""Animal House."" There may have been more. The zombies maintain the juvenile manner, such as pulling out a guy's eye and playing keep away.

Fun brainless film that spoofs college kids as zombies.

Perv guide: excessive F-bombs. Brief sex (college guys remember) urination, nudity, including some full frontal-FF (Catherine Annette of ""Lucky Bastard"" , Jamie Noel of ""Hangover Part 2"", Dora Pereli -FF , Lena Young-FF, Diane Chambers of ""Sharknado"" plus others)",1405209600,2,1378,4.662551440329218
6305380,4,B00IYRLUGO,"If you hate hot naked girls jumping up and down, this movie is not for you. The title explains everything: it is a silly college party/stoner movie with zombies. This movie is not for the cerebral-ass-monkies that need God and the meaning of life delivered with a silver I V. It was meant to be silly and fun and succeeds. Warning. There is one scary scene at the end. Showers can be awfully frightening. Glad I bought this and will buy more. Great birthday or Christmas gift for those who like to kick back--or need to.",1404345600,7,520,4.427083333333333
6305381,3,B00IYRLUGO,"In lieu of star Catherine Annette's previous credits, her poor acting in this one was probably deliberate, to be in fitting with most of the actors around her. Dora Pereli and Lena Young (aka Lena Hwang) are amusing as ditzy sorority sisters and their cross-campus streak scene is a big plus. The biggest minuses in this one are all the male actors, with the exception of Louis Dezseran as Dr. Avon, who explains what made the ""Zombie Stoner"" a zombie stoner. I wouldnt put The Coed and the Zombie Stoner at the top of my to watch list for Halloween horror, as it leans way more toward comedy than it does horror, and lame sophomoric comedy, at that, but due to its pretty female cast, who provide gratuitous nudity, and Jamie Noel's wonderfully foul-mouthed performance as a stern and sexy sorority president, its worth a look for those of us who enjoy that kind of stuff.",1441929600,2,873,4.602564102564102
6305382,5,B00IYRLUGO,"Zombedy.  Love these things.  Toss in a love story, some T&A and an idiotic premise and you can kick back and enjoy.  Not the greatest acting, but a really fun movie.",1441929600,,166,4.290322580645161
6305383,4,B00IYRLUGO,"This was a fun movie not to be taken serious in vein of George A. Romero's zombie movies. A scientific plot with a bunch of holes in it mixed with your traditional ""T&A"" movie you expect from THE ASYLUM.",1440374400,,203,4.230769230769231
6305384,4,B00IYRLUGO,Fun movie. Lot's of fun scenes and plenty of cute girls showing their assets. Plot is a little thin but does not affect the enjoyment that much.,1437782400,,144,4.37037037037037
6305385,5,B00IYRLUGO,"Lots of topless women and two women do multiple full frontal and rear view scenes in the movie. I was on the fence between 4 or 5 stars, but I decided on the five stars for the amount of lines and as fast as the charactor that Cathrine Annette played had to say them. Super happy I bought this movie.",1432512000,2,300,4.016666666666667
6305386,4,B00IYRLUGO,ok the movie is silly and funny it is  not a  scary it just a good movie to watch drunk and laugh,1431820800,2,97,3.3636363636363638
6305387,3,B00IYRLUGO,"I watched this.

I know I watched this.

I just can't remember anything about this.",1430092800,,83,4.466666666666667
6305388,4,B00IYRLUGO,"You can't approach a movie with this title with too many expectations. If taken for what it is, it's really very cute and fun.",1428883200,2,126,4.291666666666667
6305389,5,B00IYRLUGO,"Great movie came on time an fast,looking to buy more movies like this.",1426204800,,70,4.461538461538462
6305390,1,B00IYRLUGO,I won't even waste a lot of words. AWFUL!,1423008000,,41,3.6666666666666665
8646513,3,B00IYRLUGO,"I had to force myself to finish the sloppy mess of a movie.  But I did.  I am a professional. (see my book A Gross of Zombies-reviews of 144 zombie movies).  The Asylum production also made the acceptable and fun film about Honest Abe and Zombies.  I hoped for something that entertaining.  No luck.  It is more along the lines of Shark-nado three in terms of professionalism.  They did not set out to make a good zombie movie, they set out to make something that 10 year old boys would like to see.  Not that 10 year old boys should be watching stuff with total nudity and mass amounts of film taken up with very pretty girls with their shirts off.  As a rule I approve of such low class thrills but even that could not make the movie interesting.  Hum bug.
The direction is horrible.  He had his actresses and actors acting like they had be lobotomized and also given cocaine.  No one acted as a real person would act under the circumstances.  Some of the acting is actually just horrible, not simply actors being dumbed down by the director.  The script does not reach the level expected from a professional film company, even one like Asylum which is known for pretty stupid stuff.
The sound is patchy in places, not acceptable from professionals.  Many of the gags don't work, another problem when making a movie for laughs.  It is also relentlessly misogynist.  Note to makers-it is possible to have naked girls in a movie without demeaning them.",1518307200,,1452,4.544401544401544
8646514,5,B00IYRLUGO,"I love comedy-horror flicks, and this is a GREAT ONE!  Some movies in this genre are worth one watch but don't hold up to repeated watching.  I watched this on a number of occasions and I'm always glad to rewatch it.  Interesting premise (smoking pot keeps the zombie docile; enough so he can join a fraternity), but things go off-rail when he gets very angry, and the flick turns into a full zombie attack.  For me, to be a great comedy-horror flick, it must contain a fair amount of T&A, and it certainly has its share of hot co-eds.  If you are looking to just veg out, fire up your bong and give this little gem a watch.",1500681600,2,624,4.254237288135593
8646515,4,B00IYRLUGO,"it had its moments, not a great movie but it was ok",1493596800,,51,3.3333333333333335
8646516,5,B00IYRLUGO,Funny movie and arrived on time!,1478217600,,32,4.5
8646517,4,B00IYRLUGO,a little bit stupid but was ok.,1472860800,,31,3.5714285714285716
8646518,4,B00IYRLUGO,"This is one of those movies that is so ridiculous and intentionally bad, that you can't help but love it!  We have zombies in it that can be made docile by marijuana smoke, and also hypnotized by boobs.  And yes there are boobs in this movie, LOTS of boobs.  So parents, don't let your kids watch this one!

Our main character is the typical, ""Sexy Scientist"" who can't get a boyfriend because she is clueless.  She finds love with the zombie who has been in captivity since the 80's.  We have all kinds of wacky things happening like the naked mile, zombies doing bong hits, a zombie beauty pageant, zombies chasing an old lady on a mobility scooter, and did I mention boobies?

There are lame jokes that make you laugh and groan but it's still enjoyable.  The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should the viewer.  If it's a rainy day and you have nothing else to do, it's something that zombie fans will chuckle at.  Check it out!",1465344000,6,950,4.47093023255814
8646519,4,B00IYRLUGO,"I knew exactly what I was getting when I bought this film. It's a funny and dumb movie that is just something to throw on when nothing else seems like a good choice. If it had just a bit better acting it would have made for a decent B rated comedy. Overall, it had a few good laughs even though the jokes were hit and miss, and it had attractive male and female leads that played their parts well. Decent nudity, especially full frontal on two of the girls, which is unexpected and rare for any film that isn't x rated or GoT. Had to give it 4 stars because i knew what it was and it didn't disappoint haha",1464307200,3,606,4.058333333333334
8646520,3,B00IYRLUGO,this is a type of movie you would watch cus nothing else was on and you said hey why not. It's not all that great but it's something to watch. It's kind of like an awkward porno with out the sex,1464048000,2,194,3.7560975609756095
8646521,4,B00IYRLUGO,"While I was loading this up on the DVD player, I was really expecting the worst. I figured it would be a 15 - 20 minute watch depending on how bad it was and how itchy my fast forward finger was.

What a shocker! Production values were good and the acting was pretty good. The movie had funny moments, lots of nudity and bad CGI. What more could you want? As long as you're not expecting Shakespeare, you'll be fine.

Take the zombie flick Warm Bodies, combine it with National Lampoon's Classic Animal House and The Co-Ed and the Zombie Stoner is what you'd get! Be sure to check this one out!",1455408000,3,594,4.294642857142857
8646522,5,B00IYRLUGO,Five stars says it all if you like comedy and zombies you love this one,1443484800,2,71,3.8
