She is a caring but over-wrought parent dealing with a lot of issues - primarily keeping the family together. Becoming a host mother for Japanese student - Miyuki seems like a perfect solution to lighten up the household. The tension builds as we get to know Miyuki and her story. Love the flash backs.

Well done, with a bit of humor thrown in but with abundant creepiness which builds up to a scary and shocking end. Very entertaining, satisfying film for suspense/thriller/chiller/horror fans. Must see.",1275436800,2,586,4.745098039215686
