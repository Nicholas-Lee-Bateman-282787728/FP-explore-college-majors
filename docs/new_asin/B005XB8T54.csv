4902672,5,B005XB8T54,"Kenta is a player freak (i call those who play video games only players, IMO), and only has eyes for the girls in his dating sims.  So much so that he has been dubbed the God of Conquest by other simmers.  he also does not understand real girls or the real world as they do not follow the strict formula of his games (he calls reality a buggy game).  But his ego gets the best of him when an email arrives asking to take on the ultimate conquest, bringing into his life Else, a perky, adorable, ditzy demon GIRL who is on her first mission for the Loose Souls Division in the underworld and wishes to follow her older sisters path (a real demon among demons as she is called).  Now he must go through the school, locate girls who have dark souls in the hearts of REAL girls, and conquer them with love in order to force the souls out for capture, or lose his head due to the contract (make note - READ THE FINE PRINT). How can someone who can not even look at a girl do this, by referncing gaming scenarios of course.

I just finished this season one series and I found it enjoyable, a reverse harem comedy where there are a lot of girs (both real and in games) but the hero does not want anything to do with the real ones.  Watching Kenta struggle with each girl (the jock, the rich snob, the pop idol, the librarian girl, and the artist game girl) was to funny, add the fact that almost everything Else does usually throws a wrench in his careful plans.  And the final episode was a walk down memory lane (mostly when he referenced all the older systems he has).  A good watch, and I can not wait for season two with new girls, new problems, and someone who appears to be an older Else.

enjoy",1330646400,,1695,4.190769230769231
4902673,5,B005XB8T54,"Over the years harem style animes have come and gone. With very few good ones, and tons of copycats. God Only Knows I would consider a harem in basic concept of one guy after a lot of girls. It steps outside that concept when you see Keima is just a gamer...he has no interest in real women or the real world. His whole life is spent in the digital world. So how does he get girls and why?

Simple! Keima is a dating sim master. For those that don't know, dating sims are huge in Japan and have been for many years. The closest we get to them is in games like Fable 2 and 3 where you can date and marry any in game character. Or in Bioware games where you can romance a character.

So why does this all happen? Well simple, to not give away too much, Keima runs his digital mouth off as the God of Conquest. A demon sees it and gets him to help her recover escaped evil souls that are running loose. She is of course a ditz and doesn't realize this conquest is only digital women. Unfortunately, both will die if he doesn't help so thus begins their adventure recovering loose souls that end up...you guessed it, inside hearts of women. Most of the time, ones dealing with emotional issues in their lives. The only cure is for him to fill their hearts to force the evil spirit to leave.

The show picks up there and just gets better and better. I won't spoil anymore of it, each conquest in season 1 is based on generic anime female models. But they are all done very well with some quite memorable moments. Season 2, which we don't have yet...goes even further. It brings in more women and even does some different ones that most animes skip over. It also explains more about why these loose souls are running amok and why it is so important for Elsie to capture them.

But for more on season 2, you'll have to wait for it's release. Overall this is a fantastic series. It takes generic anime and turns it around, making something entirely new and original. Not a lot of shows can do that. Buy it, rent it, just check it out. If you are a romantic comedy or harem anime fan, this series is for you!",1330387200,2,2099,4.2269326683291775
4902674,5,B005XB8T54,"It is a quality HD release, but the lack of special features or, well, anything really, other than the main episodes is a disappointment.  Nevertheless, this is pretty much par for the course for most anime releases, so I guess its not a surprise.  It gets five stars from me because of the anime itself--its one of my favorites in recent memory, with lots of clever references to the video game industry, the dating sim part in particular.
The Japanese voice-acting is top-notch, of course.  After what Sentai Filmworks did to the English Dub of CLANNAD, I admit I never watch their localized dubs anymore--but I just prefer the original voices anyway, so that's not a big deal.
So, the show is great, and looks great in HD.  SF's season box is reaally skimpy on special features, but it does its job.  The show gets the five star rating.  The packaging gets a 4, for being competent, but bare-bones.",1330300800,,901,4.635220125786163
4902675,5,B005XB8T54,"This is one of the best comedic Anime series I've ever watched in my 7 years of Anime fandom. The main character, Keima, is the highlight of this show. His views on the real life and the 2D world is really interesting (and pretty much funny), so watching him, a boy who have never even had a real conversation with a real girl,  capture the interest of real girls is really impressing. Each new girl is a new ""arch"" and those episodes is usually about 2-3 episodes long. The other episodes are like a ""bonus"" to add to his character. To see this guy conquer real girls by using knowledge from visual novels is hilarious, and best of all: it works! Together with his co-worker sent from hell, Elsie, he uses her power to his own advantage after being ""tricked"" by her to capture spirits who reside in the girls empty hearts. The method this guy use is the most effective one: Filling the girls heart with love!

The quality on the HD-visuals is fantastic. The series was made for a high definition experience, so nothing is upscaled and everything looks really good. The animation is fantastic with much movement from the characters. The designs fits each characters stereotypical behavior and The audio quality is fairly good, as it's only stereo. HD stereo, that is, so you won't really make good use of your home cinema with this one. The extras are the usual: Creditless Intro and endings. There is also a music video feature, but not really worth to mention. Around 5 Kanon songs with the videos ripped right from the episodes here. It also has the very first OVA lasting for 1 minute, merged into the first episode. Nice touch. All the voices (In JP, don't know about the dub) fits perfectly and the theme songs will most likely be remembered, because: It's entirely in english.

This is a show teens would enjoy the most because of the romance/comedy/School Life themes, but adult gamers may also find this interesting. Absolutely recommended for someone who wants a different perspective on the real world and the reasons why gamers enjoy the fictional world instead of the real. A lot of the facts Keima sprouts out with will make you think...",1327363200,15,2151,4.655263157894737
4902676,5,B005XB8T54,"Is a Great series ,The World God Only Knows , Keima is known on the net as the god of getting the girls while in real life he's known as otamegane and he hates all real girls. However he is approached by Erushii, a devil from hell, to help her incatching runaway spirits that hide in people. Apparently the spirits only hide in the hearts of girls and the only way to get the souls out is by making the girl fall in love so the spirit gets forced out. And he's not allowed to fail or he will lose his head lol. Oh The English language cast is perhaps a bit ""older"" they sound okay good. Great Series Buy it!!",1326931200,6,608,4.033057851239669
4902677,4,B005XB8T54,"This review is based off of the subtitled version so I will only be commenting on the story.

Keima Katsuragi is known as a capturing god or the ""God of Conquest"", he is the best at conquering every girl in dating sim games to the point where he doesn't even look at real life girls anymore because they don't follow the rules laid out in his games, as such he comes across as very moody and unapproachable.

One day Keima receives an email with a contract to assist someone with capturing the hearts of girls, he naturally accepts thinking this for a game, but in fact it was actually a contract with a demon named Elsie to capture the hearts of ""real"" girls in order to release escaped demons that have taken up residence in their hearts.  You can imagine the hilarious nature of what is asked of Keima, to actually converse with and make real life girls fall in love with him, if he doesn't certain death lies ahead of him.

the story is fairly simplistic and at times predictable but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the series, of watching Keima struggle with his new task all the while getting help from a clumsy yet adorable Elsie.  All in all a very enjoyable watch with some very comedic moments along with some heart touching scenes.",1326240000,28,1251,4.469298245614035

4902725,4,B005XB8T54,"A well put together anime. It flows from episode to episode so smoothly; stories easily are finished in a single episode or are done over several. There's no feeling of filler, just exploration of this interesting world. The story centers around a kid that plays dating simulation games. But a contract with a devil forces him to use his skills in the real world. It's surprisingly tastefully done, and I'm glad that they take the time to do more than date girls 'to drive the demons out'. The anime looks at this culture of gaming, and does a good job of exploring the main character as he tries to save the girls. He is a gamer that hates the real world, and by the end of the first season - and a terrible singing number totally in line with the story - this is emphasized. Has he grown? In the end, I think not, so a second season is definitely in order. The end was a firm reminder of the character, but not satisfying. But in a good way. I want more. Really, the only distracting thing were the homages to various films/tv shows in various scenes. While these mostly fit the scenes, they hardly seemed necessary - the main character is a video game freak, not a movie one. It was cool to see things like posters and book titles in the series also paying tribute, but the easter egg hunt became an unwelcome distraction for me.",1463443200,,1332,4.375

4902777,5,B005XB8T54,"What makes this show COMPLETELY DIFFERENT for other romance/comedy anime is that it follows a visual novel format that shows MULTIPLE ENDINGS. (For those who say Higurashi is like this, be aware that Higurashi is NOT romance/comedy and uses time loops)

For those unaware, a visual novel is a story when you pick what happens and reach different endings depending of those selected actions. Usually one girl becomes that target of affection while the other girls become ""just friends"". Fate/Stay Night is an example of visual novels turn anime. However, Fate has picked all the options for you with one solid ending (The anime followed the choices and ending where Saber is the chosen lover, while Rin and Sakura are just friends. In the Fate movie ""Unlimited Blade Works"", it followed the choices and ending where Rin was the chosen lover, while Saber and Sakura were just friends).

TWGOK does the one thing that anime lovers don't usual get: a chance to CHOOSE their favorite type of heroine.

If you ever watched a harem anime where you favored another girl over the female lead, you might like this. Reason being the amnesia the girls are given after their ""romance"" is over. Being able to change the targeted female gives the ""what if he went after the heart of a different girl"" feeling while not having to deal with time loops. Therefore, even if you don't like the other girls, there remains the episodes for the girl you did like.

The stereotype girls portrayed seems cliche but is part of the joke: the Athlete, Former Rich Girl, Pop Star, and Librarian are all the general representations they are in anime/games.

The male protagonist, Keima, is interesting for three reasons: 1)He is able to read changing situations, 2) Believes the real world is irrational, and 3) He is a visual novel otaku.

This anime has easily reached my top 5 anime list. I have recommended this to several college anime clubs. To my surprise(given half the audience was girls and most of the guys preferred mecha/action over romance anime) EVERYONE gave a score of 9/10 or 10/10 on Episode 1 alone.

I recommend this if you:
-Know what a visual novel is
-Enjoy Harem Anime
-Have ever wanted a male protagonist to chase after a type of girl you wanted him to chase.

4902783,5,B005XB8T54,"The World God Only Knows is a series of surprising depth, rewarding to anime/eroge veterans, yet enjoyable for the inexperienced, and rewarding all that take the time to watch it.

While certainly those that play eroge or watch a lot of anime and are familiar with the culture surrounding the mediums will get a lot of the referential humor, in many ways Manglobe, the studio behind the series, was wise in its implementation in that the references or subtle and inclusive, wherein the references are there, but people who don't get them won't feel like they are missing out.

In many ways this is a not-harem comedy harem series starring an atypical protagonist, his dumb sidekick character, and a rotating cast of supporting characters as the series moves through its various story arcs. The series steps up gradually with the first arc acting as an introduction and lasting only one episode long. From there the arcs get progressively more complex while staying relatively self contained. One arc might not directly affect another, but it helps build the greater narrative.

Overall the series is a beautiful and charming with a lot of production value. Not only are the animations smooth, but the color pallet is warming, the soundtrack and supplemental music are superb. The pop-idol arc alone had enough fictional in-story pop tracks to fill an entire EP!

4902792,5,B005XB8T54,"A The World God Only Knows Anime Review
Keima is a boy that really likes video games. To be exact dating sim games. These types of games involve conquering 2-dimensional girls and to make them fall in love with him. The only real problem is Keima would rather exist only in his 2-D dating sim games. He would frequently try to reject the real world. This causes everyone around him to see him as a total dweeb Oh, and he usually would get teased Although the interesting thing about him is that Keima doesn't that bother him. Since he's actually pretty well-known on the web as a major 2-D girl conqueror he gets approached by Elsie, a demon girl, who sees him as a God or ""Kami"". Elsie wants him to make girls fall in love with him.

The World God Only Knows creates a most original concept in the story. Keima soon starts caring about others beyond just his dating sim games even though he still regains his ideals primarily the one of ""the world not exactly being anything particularly impressive"". He is determined to protect what he believes in.

The characters in The World God Only Knows are just full of great development. Elsie seems to be a cute moe demon girl that is just admirable. Keima is just amazing. He is obviously a supposed geek but his indifferent personality is incredibly hilarious at the the time since it puts off people. Even so Keima truly doesn't care.

The animation is very smooth and fluid. The animation is nothing like the early days of anime. It is bright and full of cutesy character designs. Even Keima is a cute-looking guy yet what puts people off is his non-stop gaming. The World God Only Knows anime series is really one of the best anime series that have released in recent years. The animation which for an anime is most important is superb!

4902794,5,B005XB8T54,"The World God Only Knows is about a boy, Keima Katsuragi, who is obsessed with dating sims. Crowned ""The God of Conquests"" by fellow dating sims fanatics, he's obsessed to the point where he says, ""Reality is just a crappy game!"" convincing himself that he needs no more than to be surrounded by virtual girls. Enter Elsie. Elsie is a demon from Hell who sent Keima a message asking for his assistance. Unbeknownst to Keima, by accepting the ""challenge"" sent to him by Elsie, he was forced into a contract that he must complete in order to keep from getting decapitated. Throughout the series, Keima and Elsie must track down and capture Loose Souls which hide inside the hearts of young girls. In order to capture the loose souls, Keima must take the place where they are in the girls' hearts by making them fall in love with him. After being kissed by Keima, the girls don't remember anything of their conquest.

This anime is one of my absolute favorites of all time. There is a common misconception that one needs to completely understand dating sims in order to understand the humor of this series. That is not true. I have never played a dating sim before and I found this series highly enjoyable. You'd expect it to be repetitive because of the repeated process of conquering the girls that Keima goes through, but it is the exact opposite. Each conquest brings on a new scenario (e.g. an athlete, a ""rich"" girl, a pop star, and a book worm). Overall, I highly recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of romantic comedies and harems.",1376352000,,1545,4.5978260869565215
4902795,5,B005XB8T54,"No anime I've seen thus far has translated to this format as well as this one.
The animation is beautiful and smooth as butter, especially the OP and ED.
The characters are all likeable and satisfy their own personality niche without conforming too closely.
The music is always dramatic or bubbly, but easy on the ears either way.
The original Japanese voice cast sounds great, and you end up loving the what do you call them... Seiyuu? As a part of the characters. I didn't listen to the dub.
The plot could be best described as Welcome to the NHK meets Heaven's Lost Property, but it really is a unique story that tries new things to keep it interesting till the end.

I'm glad I got this and I had to review it. The thought that something this good is being dragged down by a one-star review based on somebody hurt feelings is a bummer for me.

4902824,5,B005XB8T54,"Only 12 episodes, bah! But we have season 2 just released. Hurrah! Of all the new anime series popping onto Blu-Ray, one might have difficulty in selecting which to purchase. There are tons of amazing releases by Sentai (these guys), but they are a little more expensive since they aren't as established as Funimation. Speaking of Funimation, those guys have upped the ante 200%. They are re-releasing hordes of older Geneon and ADV (both companies defunct) series since they have acquired the license to do so. Sentai is actually the successor of sorts to ADV.

So what to buy? Well Clannad and Clannad After Story are top votes. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood if you're one of the rare few who don't own it yet (each half of the season selling for $40 or so on Amazon on Blu-Ray - sick pricing). A solid runner up is this series. I'll tell you why. Or you can watch the first episode with Japanese audio and English subs on a particular streaming (and fully LEGAL) site that rhymes with Fruchyroll. Hard code to crack I know.

This series is all about the characters. You will probably love them. They do tend to exude quite a bit of anime stereotypes, but they seem a little fresher than the tried and true character formula. In particular, I couldn't help but feel bad for/admire Keima (the main guy). He is so immersed in his virtual world of dating sims (which are hugely popular in Japan) and can't seem to function normally around real life folks. He is inadvertently contracted by a cute demon named Elsie due to her mistaking his VR conquests of females as real life female conquests. This VR Casanova now has to make girls fall in love with him in order to exorcise spirits that have buried themselves in their hearts. The only problem is that if he doesn't follow this plan, the tidy little collar on his neck will remove his head ' ala Battle Royale. And Elsie is in the same boat.

What makes this series work is that the girls have no memory of Keima's advances after the evil spirits are exorcised. Elsie can perform a limited amount of 'magic' for lack of a better term. Their partnership is endearing and interesting. And Keima's advances with the girls are mostly humorous and silly. There is a bit of the anime slapstick factor, such as folks crashing into things and making big dents (like in concrete). People becoming surprised and falling over. You know the ones. But it works in this series. The humor keeps the story interesting and helps move the plot while adding an extra layer of depth.

The visuals are striking. This is a series which deserves Blu-Ray attention. Not many other anime series (until now) have really pushed the envelope with the HD market, but the use of amazing lighting and shading effects are often jaw dropping. Not quite the same level as an action anime like Fullmetal Brotherhood or Gundam 00, but with the use of bright color it seems more striking and dramatic. (By the way, when are we getting Gundam series' on Blu-Ray over here?!?!?).

If you look through the whole catalog of current anime releases, this should be a top consideration. I wasn't sure what to expect when I started the series, but by the end I was pleasantly surprised. I highly recommend this for fans who might be a little more used to modern anime dram-edy (drama with comedy for those who don't know). It does remind me a bit of School Rumble in the humor, but it has a fresh and interesting story that is sure to draw you in. Brilliant animation, interesting and likable characters, good music, and fun jokes are all the icing on the cake.

I did very much enjoy the Japanese audio. Elsie's character sounds a lot like Meruru from the Atelier series games. The translations are spot on with very minor changes to make some of the jokes understandable in English, but not changing the actual joke (something other series have done - Desert Punk comes to mind). I actually don't even know if there is an English track, the Japanese was so good!

If you're going to buy one series: Clannad After Story. If you're buying two: Fullmetal Brotherhood. If three: then buy this!",1348704000,2,4100,4.623626373626373

The show is about 50/50 between the boys obssesion with video games and the actual conquests of the girls.  I believe there were only 4 actual conquests of girls during this first season.  Each conquest lasts a few episodes, and they go into the back story of why the girl is the way she is. Keima tries to use his knowledge and experience of dating sims to win over the real-life girls affections.  Loose soul in custody!  I like the aspect of Keima trying to conquer all these different types of girls, who are all very different from eachother.  Therefore, he has to use different strategies and tactics for each one.  Seems very playerish to make each girl fall in love with him and then move onto the next.  Seems kinda wrong.  But this is not the case, as when each girl is free'd of the loose soul, she loses all memory of the ordeal.  The show seemed so short and did have an odd ending, so I was glad to see there will be a second season.  Nice premise, and Elsie, the demon from Hell, is absolutely adoarable and very funny.

4902829,5,B005XB8T54,"High-schooler Katsuragi Keima loves girls, but not in the conventional sense.  No, the girls he loves are that of the digital realm, pixelated princesses of the various dating sim games he spends every waking moment playing.  In fact, his lady love has earned him the title of ""capturing god"" amongst the online gaming community since he can successfully win over any game heroine.  Unfortunately for Keima, this title has drawn some unusual attention.  One day he receives a strange email challenge and becomes roped into helping a demon (Elsie) capture escaped demon souls. The trick: in order to capture said souls, he must first capture the hearts of the girls they've lodged themselves into.  Yikes.

  When I first read the synopsis for The World God Only Knows, I have to admit I thought it was going to be a corny, lovey-dovey show, but it quickly proved me wrong.  God Only Knows is more of a comedy than anything, and had me in hysterics from the first episode.  Much of this comes from Keima's lack of interest in the real world.  He regularly uses gaming references to explain the world around him, comparing real people to classic game character stereotypes or dismissing something/someone because it's been overdone in his games and therefore not worth his time.  But as dorky as this makes him sound (and trust me, he is a dork), Keima also manages to pull off this completely cool character profile, because he really is GOOD at what he does. You can't help but love him.  Add to this his partner in this whole mess, Elsie, the most adorable demon you've ever seen, who can't seem to get anything right no matter how hard she tries (and she tries hard).  More often than not, she's causing Keima grief, like when she attempts to help clean house and blows up half a room!

  Plotwise, God Only Knows follows a pretty straightforward, capture a different girl each couple episodes timeline.  While this may sound like a good way to make a stale story, each girl and her problems are actually very different.  Because of this, the way Keima approaches them (and how they react to him) varies greatly, keeping the anime fresh from beginning to end.  Additionally, one begins to wonder just how each girl is affecting Keima and his outlook on life.  However, don't expect a ""wrap all things up"" ending with this anime.  Despite ""the complete collection"" title, this is only season one, and while I feel it does end itself well, it will most certainly leave you wondering, ""that's it?""  (Fortunately, there is a season two that we'll hopefully be seeing for sale in the furture).

  Now I should also note the two audio choices on this collection: English and Japanese, because I feel which language you watch makes a big difference in the reception of this anime.  While the English VA is good, I find that the Japanese voice actors for Keima and Elsie better emulate their personalities (Keima particularly).  The banter that goes on between the two of them is especially stronger.  Considering these are the two main characters, I would definitely recommend checking out the Japanese audio if you hadn't planned to.  That said, the english translation is very good and still had me rolling with laughter.

  Overall, I actually want to give this 4.5 stars.  There are one or two parts with a couple of the girls that I felt dragged or was laid on a little thick, but nothing major.  I would have also liked to see a little more character growth from Keima, but considering this is based off an ongoing manga series, I really can't condemn it for that.  There's obviously much more to come, but if you want a little taste of The World God Only Knows and guaranteed laughs, this anime's a must.",1332633600,12,3706,4.709175738724728

The english dub is really good in this one, with Chris Patton and Luci Christian as the leads. Chris Patton kills it, one of his best performances! The lead character, Keima Katsuragi, is such a badass/playboy that it's almost unbelievable how he is able to play all the girls in this show. He is an inspiration to all men!

This show is about stereotypical characters, however it's one of the most original shows I've seen to date. Cliche characters are done in a satirical sense, almost like a case study.

8488501,4,B005XB8T54,"The first season of the popular manga The World God Only Knows is a fairly good representation of the source material.  My only problem is the pacing of the show - there are a lot of erroneous scenes added that slow down the plot to a crawl.  Over half of one episode was just music scenes, it felt like an extended AMV.

Overall, the voice acting is good and the story is great if you're a fan of harem animes or gal games.  Just beware that some episodes get boring with all the filler.",1468800000,,488,4.159574468085107
