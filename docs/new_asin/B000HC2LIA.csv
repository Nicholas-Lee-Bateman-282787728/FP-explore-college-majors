2633500,5,B000HC2LIA,Great DVD's... even an adult will love... (one who hasn't grown up yet!),1173571200,2,72,4.615384615384615
2633501,5,B000HC2LIA,My son is a car freak and he loves these movies. But I enjoy them as much as him.,1172102400,,81,3.3157894736842106
2633502,4,B000HC2LIA,"My son (now 7) loves these movies.  We could only find the first 2 at our movie store so we got this for him for Christmas and I can't tell you how many times he's watched them.  We can't wait for the next one because of the surprise at the end of movie #4.  Good, consistent plot throughtout that's not hard to follow.  Somehow these drivers morphed into muscle-bound somewhat unrealistic looking people from the initial movie -- World Race.  Not sure what the purpose behind that is . . . doesn't make it bad but just different if you expect them to look like they did in World Race.  A few of these get into a little more unfriendly competition, but again nothing really bad.  Overall fun movies for kids that love Hot Wheels cars!  And even enjoyable for the grownups as well.",1171929600,5,780,4.368055555555555
2633503,4,B000HC2LIA,"I purchased this set for my son's seventh birthday. He is crazy about all things Hot Wheels, so naturally this was a hit. I recommend renting the videos if at all possible from your local video store if you have any concerns. The characters are a bit tough for my liking, and there are some secondary storylines that have dark overtones (ie one of the characters has a brother who died, and one video alludes the possibility he was involved in drugs, though it never says so specifically). I didn't feel it was overt enough, and my son just likes watching the fast cars, but some parents may find it objectionable. Overall it's a good value and it's pretty clean, too.",1171238400,3,668,4.528925619834711
2633504,4,B000HC2LIA,My 6 yr old was excited to receive this boxed set that we had to endure through several marathon weekends until he memorized all the lines in the movies. It certainly has kept him entertained. The boxed set selling here is at a great price than at our local stores.,1170115200,,265,4.32

2633507,5,B000HC2LIA,"This movie is about a race and whoever wins $5,000 dollars. The characters are Kurt Wild and Kurt Wheeler. It takes place in the portal. The portal changes every hour. Of course I liked the movie because it has action. Also, I liked it because it is about cars. The cars do coll tricks. Gerardo would like the movie because it has action.",1161216000,,338,4.380952380952381
2633528,5,B000HC2LIA,My 10 year old son had 2 of these movies but it was very hard to find the other 2.  He loves these movies and now they watch these at least once or twice a day.,1407715200,,160,3.4444444444444446

2633531,2,B000HC2LIA,Volume 4 did not work.  I contacted customer service for a replacement and was told I would have to return the whole set.

2633533,5,B000HC2LIA,This boxed set was so worth the money...an absolute bargain price for all four Acceleracer movies.

2633537,5,B000HC2LIA,"My boys just go into Acceleracer series. They spent a lot of time on YouTube viewing fragments. I found this on Amazon. At under $13 for four videos, it seemed a good deal. Now a month later, I can confirm it's a good value. I prefer my kids to sit on sofa watching, instead on office chairs watching a small video screen with bad resolution and incomplete videos.",1346803200,,364,4.367647058823529
2633560,1,B000HC2LIA,Just gave these movies to my Hot Wheel crazed son for his 5th birthday and we spent the afternoon watching them. The last movie ends wide open to another show.......but when I check online they never made one!!! Now my son is sad and has put a black mark on his birthday.  They should either stop selling these or put a disclaimer in for parents that their children will be asking them questions for the next year about what happens to Vert and you won't have an answer because they never made an ending to the stupid show!!!! Do not buy!!!!,1338940800,,541,4.356435643564357
2633561,5,B000HC2LIA,"I hate these movies.  Watching them is about equal to getting teeth pulled.  However my son loves them and they are my husband's guilty pleasure.  So I give them 5 stars.

Warning though:  The last movie is a complete disappointment.  It just cuts off and leaves the audience hanging.",1336521600,,284,4.6938775510204085
2633562,3,B000HC2LIA,"This was the sequel to the animated film ""Hot Wheels: World Race"" which i personally loved. It infused the realism of driving and racing seen in ""The fast and the Furious"" with quick cuts to drivers shifting, and operating the pedals, with the fun and inasity of Hot Wheels race sets. ""Acceleracers"" amps that all up to the next level. Adding more personalities to the drivers, while setting up some rivalries, the series sees the return of vert Wheeler and a few other drivers like Kurt Wilde, his younger brother Mark, and Taro Kitano leading two teams of racers against the returned Gallorum and the racing Drones. I really liked the more stylized art style, but the fact that each volume seemed to be missing something was confusing. There are webisodes but even those don't connect things completely. At the end of each race the winner gets an accela-charger, a device that gives the cars enhanced abilites. By the second volume several have already been won by the drones, yet we never really see it happen and the wbisodes are only trucated versions of the race. All in all it's a decent follw-up and I'm glad I got it but it's issues are large enough to only get 3 stars.",1327968000,2,1179,4.619047619047619
2633563,3,B000HC2LIA,"I had fun watching these videos. They're quality animation, packed with many exciting racing scenes.  But the main characters have the bad attitudes of gang members and street thugs, so I would caution you if you have young children (as I do), to limit their exposure to this, and take the opportunity to identify with them which attitudes and actions of the main characters are God-honoring and loving one's neighbor, and which ones are full of pompous arrogance and ""tough-guy"" facades of young men trying to hide their fears,insecurities and inadequacies. (this review written by a dad)",1325808000,2,589,5.072164948453608
2633564,3,B000HC2LIA,"(This does contain a spoiler)  I bought these for my son after he watched World Race over and over for months.  He liked the movies, but they were darker and somewhat more disturbing than Worlld Race.  (For example, he was really upset about what happens to Kadeem, a good guy--turned into an evil cyborg and then killed--kinda heavy for a little kid)  For an older child,  the action is exciting and the worlds they race through are pretty cool.",1311638400,3,446,4.594936708860759
2633565,5,B000HC2LIA,"I was very pleased with my order and Amazon.  The original order was lost at the fault of my mail carrier and my son was waiting for his well earned reward down to the day of arrival.  When the Post Office verified that the package was lost, I thought I would have a crisis. Then to my amazement, Amazon replaced it and the very next day it was on our doorstep with no additional cost to me. The post office took longer to find the missing package than Amazon did to not only send out a replacement but actually get it to me! I am completely satisfied with amazon and their customer service for the handling of this issue. Thank you.  My son totally LOVES the dvds.",1309564800,,665,4.2204724409448815
2633566,5,B000HC2LIA,"Ordered this for my son as a Christmas gift. He loves hot wheels, watched every movie in the set on the first day!",1295568000,,114,4.0
2633567,5,B000HC2LIA,"My son is a Hot Wheels fan.  He loves everything Hot Wheels.  He is 5 years old.  Ever since he began expressing himself, he has asked me to rent the Hot Wheel movies.  We have spent a small fortune at the video place renting these movies time and time again.  Plus we have gone to the Library to check them out.  Finally, the light bulb went on and I decided to purchase them through Amazon.  What a great idea that was.  Santa brought these to him for Christmas and he was sooooo excited.  In fact, before Christmas he told me he wanted them and I asked him if he had told Santa.  He said Santa always knows.  And he was right.  The condition of the box was like new.  The disks were all in great working condition.  Excellent product and excellent buy.  Thank you.",1295395200,,767,4.229166666666667
2633568,5,B000HC2LIA,"Bought this for my boys for their birthdays (ages 8 & 5) & they love every one of the movies; they've watched them several times each!  If your child loves Hot Wheels, they'll love this box set.  A great value, too.",1259625600,,215,4.219512195121951
2633569,5,B000HC2LIA,I bought this set for my 5 year old son 2 years ago for Christmas.  I have 4 boys ages 5-11 and they all still watch them after two years (WAY more than any other movies we own). I only wish I could find another collection they loved this much.  I honestly cannot believe these dvd's are not worn out from how much they have been played.  I cannot imagine a boy not loving these movies.,1259539200,,386,4.052631578947368
2633580,5,B000HC2LIA,"Grew up with Hotwheels and even though I purchased the box set for my son, I enjoy watching just as much as he does. Good story lines, cool cars, and the concept of the racing realms all fit together. DVDs come with extras that add to stories and characters. Still a fan...",1258934400,,273,4.269230769230769
2633581,4,B000HC2LIA,The seriers is great. My son loves them and has finally seen the whole set. But when it came time for the extras...it wasn't compatable with my brand new computer. It needs some sort of decoder to access the rest of the special features so it's a little dissapointing. Other than that the set is great.,1255824000,,302,4.410714285714286
2633582,5,B000HC2LIA,What a great purchase for the money!  I sure wish I would've purchased this sooner!  My seven year old son and five year old daughter can't get enough.  They both get down on the floor and act out the scenes with their Hot Wheels while watching the movie.  The hours of entertainment is priceless.  I definitely would recommend this boxed set.,1252886400,,343,4.557377049180328
2633583,5,B000HC2LIA,This is my second boxed set for my 3 year old son.  This was to replace his last set.  He loves watching these & he now knows who the characters are.  We take them everywhere we go since he is always watching them.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone that has a son that loves cars.,1251936000,,292,4.0701754385964914
2633584,5,B000HC2LIA,"My 3 year old loves these DVDs.  I bought them for him when he was in his late 2's and they were appropriate for him even at that age.  It's been 9 months since I bought them for him and he still loves them and would watch them everyday if I let him --which, of course, I don't.  Well worth the money.  I just wish Mattel or whoever made them would make more and also wish that they would release a DVD of the old Hot Wheels cartoons.  Where are those?!  Can't even watch anything but the intro to it on youtube.",1249776000,,512,3.9705882352941178
2633585,4,B000HC2LIA,"The Hot Wheels Acceleracers Boxed Set has been a great investment for us. Our boy (age 3, almost 4) loves these Hot Wheels movies. His older male cousins (ages 5 through 13) enjoy watching the videos with him. Definitely a worthwhile purchase.",1247529600,,243,4.809523809523809
2633586,4,B000HC2LIA,"I bought this because my kids had seen the first one and I didn't even know it was a series of 4 movies.  These are great movies, even I like watching them.  My 3 year old loves watching these and uses their stories and characters when playing with his own hotwheels cars.  I only wish they would continue making more as the story is very entertaining and kind of leaves you hanging even after the 4th movie.  Can't wait for more.",1238457600,,430,4.271604938271605
2633587,1,B000HC2LIA,the second time my child went to play the dvd it started skipping I tried other dvd just to make sure it was not the player itself and it worked just ok. so I tried the hotwheels again and they starting stoping and freezing and skipping.,1237161600,,237,4.173913043478261
2633588,5,B000HC2LIA,My son had these movies before but lost one and scratched another. This was an outstanding price for a four pack. My son also liked the fact he had something to keep all four movies together.,1236988800,,191,4.333333333333333

2633600,5,B000HC2LIA,I bought this set because we seem to be renting it every time the boys see it. There are not that many videos where the 7 to adult crowd can watch enjoyably. Graphics are AMAZING and the plot not overly violent. Good value for the money too.,1230336000,,241,4.148936170212766
2633601,5,B000HC2LIA,"These videos are ideal for kids who love playing with hotwheels cars and tracks.  While there are some mildly frightening scenes with robots being destroyed, for the most part the action is about human heroes racing against competing drones through a number of ""realms"" or worlds with different themes (water, desert, city).  The animation is very good, the excitement factor is high and adults will find themselves goosing an imaginary gas pedal along with their kids.",1225152000,,469,5.157894736842105
2633602,5,B000HC2LIA,"My 4 1/2 year old son loves Hot Wheels cars.  His Grandmother rented him one of these videos at the store, and he LOVED it!!  I thought it would be cheaper for me to buy the set for him. I got my money's worth in less than one weekend!!!!  He absolutely loves it!!!",1215388800,,265,3.9622641509433962
2633603,3,B000HC2LIA,"Our son LOVES Hot Wheels. We rented the World Race movie for him when he was 3. We all watched it. At first I was concerned about the message it might be sending (I think someone else refered to Vert as a spoiled military brat), but afterwards, I was very pleased. I also liked the 'safety' aspects of the movie (always buckle up, wear a helmet, and the importance of working as a team, etc.).
We couldn't wait until the other movies made it to the shelves. We immediately decided that the World Race was a movie we were going to have to buy or constantly be renting it.
The Acceleracer movies (1-4 + the World Race for a total of 5 movies), although good, are not as good as the first one, especially for the audience age range that will be seeing it. I don't like the change in the presentation. It's too dark (scenes and characters). Some of the voices changed as well. The 1st Acceleracer movie has a character who's brother died in a race. They never really go into it far enough for a young child to understand and it didn't need to be in there. Plus, you also have the dark almost evil side of Mark Wilde. It is over the top compared to his character in the World Race. The only saving grace about the Acceleracer movies was that our son was older by the time they came out. So, I could help explain the problems to him better.
Plus, the Acceleracer movies seemed more like product placement as a way to push merchandise.  If the movie were better and age appropriate, sale of the age propriate merchadise would follow, b/c kids just love it.
I can't help but feel that the World Race did well in sales and thus the other movies followed, but Hot Wheels did a dis-service with the Acceleracer movies by forgetting the age of their viewers.  Even the songs in the World Race were better.
All that said, all the movies are good. The World Race is, by far, the best. Our son is 7 1/2 now and STILL asks to watch it.",1212192000,11,1919,4.269230769230769
2633604,5,B000HC2LIA,My kids have already watched these so many times I am wondering if they will wear them out. These have entertained my 3 year old up through my 11 year old nephew.

World race is the first title and Acceleracers is the next four title. The fact that it was made by the company MainFrame(R)(made Reboot, ActionMan, Max Steel,Spiderman 3d seires etc.) also made it worth wild, if your a fan of there work i advise you or anyone to look into these dvds. the movies are also great for kids/family who are hotwheels fans or not. the movies take you though a thrill ride as if you were there. the movies are also up-to-date as far as fast/street car movies(specs) and this thrill ride gives kids or any a good moral to live by the end of each movie.(especially for kids). bottom line, i would recomend: Hot Wheels Accelaracers and Hot wheels world race.",1205798400,,820,4.547297297297297
