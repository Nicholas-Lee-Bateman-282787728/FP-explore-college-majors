198807,5,1586171941,"If you are interested on finding an inspirational movie, you can hardly find any other production that can match this one.  Definitively a must see film, especially if you are a Catholic. It describes the Holy Sacraments in a vivid way that can help you understand better the values the Church treasures.",1153526400,21,304,4.846153846153846
198808,5,1586171941,"This movie about Padre Pio grabs you right from the start and doesn't let go. Not only is there a lot of action in it, but oddly enough, this movie is an encredibly effective catalist for prayer. I've watched it 3 times now...and EVERY time I watch it, I am drawn into a state of prayer either during or directly following the movie...GREAT!",1152489600,23,341,4.428571428571429
198809,5,1586171941,"This movie on the life of St. Pio is excellent! Even though St. Pio was known during his life time as a ""wonder-worker"", and had many angelic and demonic encounters throughout his life, and even had apparitions of both Jesus and Mary, St. Pio was still a human being. This movie shows people the life of St. Pio from HIS human perspective. The viewer will see St. Pio crying after a woman dies before his eyes, asking ""Why does he [Satan] always win?"" The viewer will see St. Pio get angry, laugh, love, and suffer.

One of the most fascinating aspects of St. Pio's thinking was his shame of being chosen by God to bear the stigmatic wounds of Jesus. One of his first responses to the sitgmatic wounds is, ""Why? Why did God choose me?"". It is this shame that drives St. Pio to hide his stigmata. When the Pope grants permission to a (unbelieving) doctor to examine him, he responds, ""Are you hear to see the freak show? Sorry, the circus is closed."" I think this highlights St. Pio's human character.

Although St. Pio performed a multitude of miracles during his earthly life, these are not the focus of the film at all. This film shows a ""wonder-worker"" who thought if necessary to have a hospital built for the sick and suffering. This film shows a St. Pio who says, ""You can't always ask for miracles."" In fact, although the movie shows St. Pio's gift of prophecy and heart-reading, the only other miracles that the movie shows are the lives that were changed by St. Pio's life of faith, hope, and love.

Ultimately what this presentation of St. Pio's life gives to us viewers is the lesson that Christians are themselves ""sacraments"" (i.e., physical means through which God conveys His grace), and that we cannot expect our Christian lives to be overflowing with the supernatural. God works through our discipline, obedience, perseverance, prayer, and faith to spread His Kingdom.",1150070400,115,1885,4.688821752265861
198810,5,1586171941,"Excellent and very edifying movie. The actors did an incredible job! Cinematography and directing really good. Not a  low budget looking film.my kids and husband were very in to this movie and never lost interest.

198811,5,1586171941,There are many DVDs about Padre Pio. I think I have seen them all. This one is my favorite. This is a high-quality film that really covers every aspect of Padre Pio's life.

198812,5,1586171941,"A throughly inspiring film about one of the greatest saints of our time. Padre Pio was a man such as God sends to this world whenever it is dominated by skepticism and disbeliefthrough his miracles we know for sure that there is a God who loves us, and through his sufferings we learn that there's no way to heaven but that of the Cross.

Spiritually we have very less movies around us but this movie makes our heart satisfied. Film is little longer.
The story or life of Father Pio touched me. One of my friend also said the same. Priesthood is not a easy life as many think of this.
I am very blessed. I am glad that I watched this movie.
I am sure this movie will continue to touch many lives around the world .
Congratulations for all who have contributed for this making of the movie.

198830,5,1586171941,"Someone in a review I read before watching this movie said that it wasn't a film, but instead ""an experience."" After watching it I have to agree. I don't honestly know how anyone could not give this a high rating. As far as movies on the lives of holy people go this one was incredible. Albeit not a short film (how could it be?) it was still amazing. My teenage daughter and I were enthralled the entire time as we visually walked along side the actors portraying Saint Pio's holy and challenging life. We both walked away from this film, jaw dropped and blessed. This is a phenomenal movie and I highly suggest it.",1477008000,,616,4.412280701754386

198866,1,1586171941,"We couldn't understand why, at the end of part 1, the movie showed Padre Pio saying mass facing the people. He wouldn't have done that.

Also, this movie had many profanities in the form of exclamatory reactions, which although seem innocent on the surface, are still profanities and still offensive to God.

This is not a good movie for anyone, but especially not one for children. I had to cover my children's eyes several times and finally turned it off.",1443830400,4,457,4.7

198874,5,1586171941,"Italian subtitles and, even though I do not speak Italian, all the more convincing for hearing the native language of the protagonist. Unlike other films of this genre the acting is natural and convincing. Padre Pio was truly a man of the people and of God. The scenes dealing with diabolical attacks were skilfully employed furthering an understanding that a Saint must battle not just against temporal authority but, while on earth, is in the forefront of the eternal conflict between Satan and Jesus Christ.",1433462400,3,510,5.011764705882353
198875,5,1586171941,"This is a beautiful film. It's a pretty accurate depiction of Padre Pio's life. All of the actors in this piece are wonderful. Sergio Castelitto is amazing. He really captures the essence of the man. Jurgan Prachnow really does an amazing job playing the inquisitor who doubts the reality of Padre Pio's stigmata and miracles. Prachnow's portrayal of his character encapsulates the many people who doubted and prejudged Padre Pio throughout his life.  Some people may recognize Pierfrancesco Favino from his short role in Angels and Demons, but Favino is a wonderful actor, and his portrayal of a man struggling with alcohol and other issues is powerful. He's brilliant in this film. Lorenza Indovina plays Cleonice. Her character acts as a witness to the events. She represents an original member of the Padre Pio prayer group for women. It's through her eyes that we see the struggle that Padre Pio and his prayer groups experience when the Pope gave orders that he could no longer say mass to the community or meet with his groups. Forced into complete isolation, Pio can only write and answer letters. Castelitto really captures the struggle Pio has keeping his faith in the Pope and the church while being falsely accused and attacked.

This is a different kind of Catholic film. So many Catholic and Christian films are packed with important messages but are often lackluster when it comes to the acting and camera work. But, this film is packed with powerful images and beautiful cinematography. In my humble opinion, it is the best Christian, especially Catholic film ever made.",1432944000,17,1586,4.981132075471698

198897,5,1586171941,"Director Carlo Carlei explores the life of Francesco Forgione, also known as Saint Padre Pio, in this TV movie entitled,Padre Pio:Miracle Man. This was adapted from the book by Renzo Allegri.

A Capuchin friar whose endless devotion would manifest itself in the appearance of stigmata wounds for more than 50 years, Padre Pio was responsible for a series of religious miracles that many sited as proof of God's existence in an era where spiritual skepticism was at an all time high.

This TV movie captures Padre Pio's intense faith and devotion, and deep spiritual concern for others. Aside from that,it demonstrates his great compassion for the sick and suffering. It reveals the amazing details and events in his life as a boy and throughout his years as a friar, dramatizing the frequent attacks of the Devil on him, as well as the persecution he suffered at the hands of people, including those in the church. This is an outstanding feature film on the amazing life of this great saint.",1417910400,,991,4.8579881656804735

198913,5,1586171941,"I had seen this before a while ago.  But this time I made a point of studying the overall story of this much under-acclaimed and under-appreciated human being we now officially call a ""saint.""  The actor played joyfully at times the tongue-in-cheek this saint actually was.  But he also took a page from Jesus when he demolished the marketeers trying to sell his statues outside church.  It was a long movie and gave the overall feeling of reading a long Russian novel.  Moving with all Padre Pio endured.  As he said near his death, in his words to Christ Himself, Christ was in his body and he was in Christ's.  Couldnt have been said better.",1404864000,,644,4.547826086956522

It's very long, and I recommend watching it in the original Italian.. but even with the length and not knowing the language, it doesn't feel so long. This movie helped me to have a greater devotion to St Padre Pio and it shows different sides of his character and life - his spiritual struggles, miracles, and the human side of him. Some parts are very moving, some are funny, and some are very serious and deep. The acting is great and so is the music, direction, and cinematography. I've watched this movie many times and I'm still not tired of it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about St Padre Pio!",1403740800,,688,4.3828125

198921,5,1586171941,This movie does the unenviable job of filming a story about a true Saint. It succeeds for the most part.

He poured out his love on people and was able to confront those who challenged him with that knowledge he possessed. He suffered greatly from the attacks of the demons, but kept himself close to God.",1395532800,,326,4.360655737704918
198928,1,1586171941,"This is a purely ""Novus Ordo"" re-write of the life of Padre Pio.  Padre Pio was a real Catholic and a real Saint.  He was a fierce opponent of the revolutionaries who seized control of the Vatican during and after the Second Vatican Council with the intension of replacing the Catholic Church with, what ""Paul VI"" called the ""New Church"", or the ""Novus Ordo Church"", and like all who resisted them, he was fiercely persecuted because of this.  He refused to abandon the Catholic Faith and Catholic Sacraments and, unlike this movie depicts, refused to celebrate the ""New Mass"".  Two dear friends, who knew Padre Pio personally, spoke of their conversations with him in great depth.  The character depicted in this movie has little resemblance to the man they described.  Further, many of the events depicted in this movie are purely fictional with the intention of re-writing history in favor of the ""revolution.""  He knew he was living in the beginning times of the ""Great Apostacy"" long predicted in scripture and prophecied by many of his fellow Saints, and he lived his life accordingly.  He did not cooperate with the enemies of Christ who claimed to validly hold positions of authority in the Vatican.  Miracles with him were as common as breathing.  This movie poorly conveyed this.  Instead, it depicts a great Saint as little more than a nice man.  The movie also attempts to depict the diabolical ""Vatican officials"" who persecuted him as good-intentioned individuals who, perhaps, were experiencing a crisis of faith.  They were not.  In short, this movies is a propaganda film for the ""Novus Ordo"" religion, and is not an accurate depiction of a Great Saint.  Those of you who were raised in the ""Novus Ordo Church"" (and believe you are Catholic, but have never been taught the Catholic Faith) will probably not know what I am talking about.  Perhaps it is time to learn.",1395360000,18,1883,4.855799373040752
198929,5,1586171941,"Most excellent spiritual dvd. They don't get much better than this. It's a top drawer movie with lots of insight into Padre Pio's inner life. The attacks by the priest introduced in the beginning of the film were unnerving, but it showed how Padre Pio prevailed with divine insight and forgiveness.
Excellent, excellent film. Definitely worth getting.",1394755200,,351,5.175438596491228

198939,5,1586171941,"This is a very moving depiction of the life of a great saint who suffered for 50 years bearing the stigmata (wounds of Christ). He was persecuted by many, including members of the Church, but remained faithful to the Lord until his death in 1967.",1381881600,,246,4.488888888888889
198940,5,1586171941,"The movie is so very, very well done and faith lifting.  The acting is superb, especially Sergio Castellitto who plays Padre Pio.  While it is long, almost four hours, it held our attention as we watched it not once but several times with relatives and friends.  We thought it was best watching it in Italian with English subtitles.  While I had read a few books about Padre Pio when he was alive, this version of his life, unlike a similar movie also available on Amazon, is inspiring and faith building.  It is hard to believe that anyone regardless of belief or non-belief can readily debunk the life of this saint.  While the movie does not focus on the many miracles and spiritual gifts he possessed, it does bring together aspects that occur in the lives of other mystics, i.e.,  suffering, persecution, and evil spiritual attacks that try to prevent such individuals from further sewing seeds for the Kingdom of God on earth.  There is abundant evidence of his many miracles on the internet as well as with his canonization documents but no where does the whole come together better than in this film.  My wife and I recommend it with the highest marks we can give with the caveat that some of the spiritual warfare scenes may be frightening for the very young.",1379462400,6,1268,4.650224215246637

The performance is marked by a portrayal of a man with a sense of humor, naivete, faith in God's leading, discernment and love.  The film pulls no punches about the man's foibles and struggles with clerics within the church and temptation.  I felt in my heart that Padre Pio was a very good servant who may have asked why but never doubted that God was in control of his humble walk and life.  He confronted many troubles and was punished at times by his own church and his own higher expectations of himself.  This film was made with love and affection and it shows.  there is a warmth here that few films can boast.  Do yourself a favor and watch this with fresh eyes, an open mind and a loving heart.

198978,5,1586171941,"Even though this film is in Italian with subtitles it was well worth watching.  After renting the film I'm purchasing it
 to add it to my permanent collection. Sergio Castellitto does an incredible job portraying Padre Pio with sensitivity
and humor and makes his character so endearing yet far from saccharine that I found myself developing a profound affection
for him.  The film somehow manages to capture some of the essence of true spirituality and spiritual struggle, albeit in a
very Christian/Catholic/mystical context that to strict materialists may seem bizarre.  I don't believe in much of what was
portrayed, but very much appreciated the portrayal of a deeply spiritual, humble and very decent man. An extremely moving and
uplifting film that brought me to tears many times.  This is an example of film at its best.",1329177600,4,828,5.0588235294117645

It's over 300 minutes long and every minute completely gripped me - no exaggeration. The acting is good and the main actor resembles Pio quite a bit.

It is very well made and if you have any interest in the life of Padre Pio and who he was, or just simply want to get to know more about him, I would definitely recommend this movie. It is superb. 5 stars.",1326585600,2,486,4.105263157894737

To learn about a man who suffered so much physical and mental pain and yet remain so steadfast in his faith is very inspiring indeed. The acting and directing were excellent and deserve a 5-star rating along with the way the story of this modern saint was told in the movie. What made the story of Padre Pio even more meaningful for me is knowing that he was alive when I was just a young boy.,1322438400,4,457,4.204545454545454

How important it was for his to be true. How important it is to do vows.",1321574400,6,351,4.253731343283582

You wouldn't think as much for a movie about a poor child who set his mind at age 5 to become a priest, but I promise you, and I mean that... Promise you, this is more than just someone's life story. Pio faced a lot of persecution, even from his superiors, many of whom did not believe what was happening. He handled it with dignity, humor and grace. We should all learn from him! Of note; don't use the English dubbing as it sounds like someone reading a dictionary with no thought to the story or it's incredible content. Listen in Italian and read the subtitles. It is SO worth it! Bless you!",1307750400,,671,4.333333333333333
198993,5,1586171941,"Having seen many saint films and documentaries, Padre Pio: Miracle Man stands out as the most powerful and superbly played. The entire production is excellent but Sergio Castellitto takes the film to amazing heights as he completely embodies the saint. For over three hours you feel as though you are truly in the presence of Padre Pio. This is extremely rare -- it's almost impossible to act like a saint w/o some vestiges of ""acting"" peeking through. The film and Castellitto's portrayal, i feel, has been blessed by the saint to bring his life and message of humility and sanctity to a wider audience of viewers. The cinematography, settings in the countryside of Italy and musical score all contribute to a truly uplifting experience. Recommended for viewers from all traditions, written by a follower of the Vedanta tradition.",1294790400,,831,5.028985507246377

I hope it got all the highlights of Father Pio's life including the time when they were going to bomb Assissi and Father Pio's face appeared to the pilots in the sky and they never bombed their target.  Instead they turned and went back to where they were dispersed.  He was fascinating, definately a healer, one who suffered like Christ and became aquainted with pain as well as compassion.

Lourdes draws about 6 millions people annualy after some 130 years known, Padre pio also draw some 6 millions people (after 30 years known). This equal disneyland annual attendance, yet, without food, dancing, nor rides....only penance, prayer and penalties on the souls....Awesome place.

Short of going there, you need to see the 2 top Padre Pio DVD, Miracle man  is one, and ""between Heaven and Earth"" the other one. SInce these movies deals with your eternal soul for eternity, no other films comes close to them Except the ""Passion of the Christ"" by Mel gibson. These 3 DVD is a MUST have in your home if you want to know what happened after this short life.

One rich and powerful man went to PAdre pio and loudly yell, ""I do not believe in Hell!!"".  TO which PAdre Pio, quietly replied:"" You WILL, when you get there""!!!

I am very close friends with a couple of his relatives; one is a priest named by St. Pio before Fr. Pio was born! I have read a lot about him as well as heard from these friends personal stories of this holy man. This movie went far beyond my expectations since most Saint films just ""don't get it."" I did not find a single error. However, it is only a 4 hour movie and the man lived with the stigmata for 50 years! You cannot possibly portray ""enough"" of his life to satisfy any devotee's appetite. Also, this movie portrays just about the best ""Hollywood"" depiction of a woman possessed by a demon- very real life. (Her head doesn't spin around, she doesn't puke green.) My whole family (kids are 11yrs-22yrs old) enjoyed this film. We rented it on Netflix first and I'm buying it to loan to people and hopefully inspire more friends and neighbors to give their whole selves over to our Loving GOD. St. Padre Pio, help us to trust God fully as you did. Help us to ""Pray, Hope and Don't Worry,"" as you admonished us while you walked this earth with us.

Very accurate in biographical data, I have to warn you that the dubbing in English (it lacks the proper feeling which can lead you to think that the acting was poor) is poor, the spanish one si really good.
The music is beatiful.
It's a work of art, highly reccomended, specially if you don't understand what a saint is and what are the merits that make one.

If you are familiar with St. Padre Pio by word of mouth, or from a few pictures or articles, then you'll appreciate this film. However, if you are an advid reader of St. Padre Pio, you'll probally be disappointed as well.

The reason for this is, besides receiving the stigmata and a few attacks of the devil, it fails to capture his incredible abilities, his healings, mystic visions, his interaction with guardian angels, bi- location, and levititation.",1257120000,55,644,5.018691588785047

So, when I viewed it on YouTube, I was captivated!  Although the YouTube clips were a few minutes, I continued for an hour (maybe even longer).  I have NEVER watched that much YouTube--ever!  So, I quickly purchased the DVD.  The English subtitles were fine because I really appreciate the Italian language as contributing to authenticity.  No matter if it is the life of a Catholic priest, anyone would enjoy the acting, the cinematography, the music....one need not know anything about the Catholic religion to be entertained with the workings of human nature and how it contributed to Padre Pio's sanctity.",1224547200,7,774,5.047244094488189

I've watched it several times now and find it more and more engrossing with each viewing.  Sergio Castellitto's performance is outstanding -- he reveals so much of Padre Pio's spiritual depth, his very Southern Italian sense of humor and gruffness, his sensitivity, and above all his intense faith.  His battles with Satan are chillingly portrayed, without a hint of any sort of psycho-spiritual mumbo jumbo as usually dominates Hollywood treatments of these subjects.  The music and cinematography are first-rate.  I recommend watching this film in Italian with English subtitles because the dubbed English is very distracting.  This is an extremely fine film that goes a very long way toward revealing why Padre Pio is one of the most beloved and fascinating saints of all time.

It is also more profound and spiritual than most typical fare. Yet it is truly a piece of art worth experiencing. This film is an adaptation of the life of one of our greatest contemporary saints. There was certainly some minor artistic license, but given what I have read about the life of Padre Pio, the writers and director stayed true to the biographical data. They honestly depicted his struggles, the depth of his relationship with God, and the impact Padre Pio had in the lives of all he encountered. In particular, I think the film does a masterful job of depicting the various crosses that Padre Pio was called to carry, his physical sufferings, as well and his spiritual ones.

It shows his humility, his struggles with the devil, and everything an orthodox Catholic and Christian would want out of a film.  It doesn't overlook the temporal problems of the Catholic Church such as the pride, jealousy, and vindictiveness of the powerful opponents of Padre Pio, but it portrays this not as if most of these opponents were evil, but simply that they did not understand, and even in Padre Pio's words they were simply trying to protect the Church. The importance of the three religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience come to the forefront in this film in many ways.

I understand the movie is already over 3 hours long, so they could not include everything. A nice 5 or 6 hour mini series may be what is needed.

199025,5,1586171941,"I noticed that some reviewers were offended by some of the liberties the filmmakers took with Padre Pio's life compared to his written biographies.  However, I don't think the movie was disrespectful.

Regarding the story with Cleonice Morcaldi, if it is true that he was accused of having close relationships with some of the women, then I think the way they treated this story was fair.  It showed how it was possible for regular people to misconstrue their relationship, even though it was, in fact, an innocent relationship.  The fact that the screenwriters showed Brunetto admitting to share the same affection as Morcaldi for Padre Pio created the sense that it was an innocent but overwhelming affection that crossed all people who met him...and not ""as you would think"", as Cleonice's character responds.

Another point that offends some of the reviewers is the movie's portrayal of the Church as corrupt...that even Satan is portrayed to be a Bishop.  First of all, the devil is a deceiver, so maybe the choice to portray the devil as a holy man actually falls along that line.  I've read in other books that the devil appears to be handsome and attractive...not like the demons portrayed in horror movies.  As far as the Church being portrayed as corrupt, it is true that corruption has existed in the Church, even though it is the Church that will prevail.  Just because man has been corrupt does not take away from the holiness of Christ's Church which still stands 2000 years later.

Overall, I understand the reviewers, especially those loyal to the books written about this extraordinary saint.  However, I feel that watching this movie, which was beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, did not detract from my devotion to Padre Pio, and only encourages me to learn more about him.  Perhaps it is no longer surprising to me that a movie, for dramatic effect, takes a few liberties and does not portray only the facts written in biographies. Like any translation, movies try to convey the core meaning, which may not be word-for-word.  Other than perhaps a few factual discrepancies, the movie is very Catholic and reveals the beauty within this traditional religion, as well as the many gifts Padre Pio shared with his community and still shares with many who seek his intercession today.",1178150400,16,2304,4.922480620155039
199026,4,1586171941,"Touching on key scenes of his life, 'Padre Pio, Miracle Man' transports the viewer through the saint's life.  Nothing seems forced or stagnant.  Sergio Castellitto is well-rounded and makes us forget that he's only an actor.  Showing his tenderness and temper, and his vulnerability to enemies domestic and supernatural, this affecting drama seldom loses its footing.  The supporting cast keeps it real, too.  The story is structured much like 'Amadeus'.  Pio tells his story/confession to a hardened cardinal, and we go back and forth from the aging saint to the portions retold of his life.  Effective and absorbing.",1175817600,9,618,5.244897959183674
199027,1,1586171941,"Yes the movie is ""beautiful and touching"" as another reviewer stated. However, it is also quite wrong. I have read just about every biography of Padre Pio published in English (and there are many) and can assure you that you must read credible biographical works before you see this film if you want to know the real Padre Pio. Then if you still want to view this movie, you can sit down and spot the outrageous errors in the movie.

Question: Why would anyone interested in learning the truth about this remarkable man watch a movie that is loaded with mistakes and distortions?

Recommended: Right here on Amazon you can order Lutheran minister Bernard C. Ruffin's biography of Padre Pio. It is an excellent way to get the facts!",1175212800,21,731,4.658914728682171
199028,1,1586171941,"This is a terrible movie, both from a religious and artistic point of view.

From an artistic point of view, it is often incoherent, the plot line jumbled, the characterisations inconsistent.  Also, many things are changed around in the film, that would have been more potent had they retained the details of reality they were denied here.

From a religious point of view, the story flat-out lies regarding Saint Pio and events in his life, aspects of his religious beliefs, and comes very close to slander regarding fictional events portrayed in this film.  The film portrays his father as confessing to adultery (this can be nothing but fiction, as confessions are sacred and sealed - plus, his father and mother were very devout and saintly and devoted to one another), and it portrays Saint Pio as having some sort of romantic obsession with one of his spiritual children.  Nothing of these sorts took place.  Ever!

From an artistic point of view, the device of an elderly priest harassing Saint Pio on his deathbed is almost humorously clumsy and facile.  I could not laugh, however; because this is also another untruth.  No such person visited Saint Pio.

From a religious point of view, I also found this story device distressing.  The film strongly implies this man is the devil or one of his emissaries - and yet, Saint Pio begs him to hear his confession.  This would not happen.  Saint Pio literally battled satan daily, and the devil never won.  And yet, in THIS film, Saint Pio is portrayed as wailing, ""Why does he (the devil) always win?"".  Sacrilege.

I wish I had my money back.  I wish I had the two hours of my life back which were spent watching this lying, clunky, ambling trash bin of a film.  The filmmakers clearly have an agenda against religion, shown at every opportunity - lecherous priests, money grubbing religious, etc.  My skin felt like it was crawling, watching this (and yet I felt I must, to be truly fair in my summation).  They portray Saint Pio as an athlete bounding up stairs even in old age - in reality he slowly shuffled due to his stigmata wounds.  Some of their jabs are subtle, others devious (see above examples) and still others are outright slaps in the face - of our dear Saint and of the Church.  I felt anger watching it, but most of all sadness, and traces of the evil - some of its lies were so sneaky.  If you haven't read every book about Saint Pio you possibly could - you might not know just how badly some of the events of his life are twisted, here.

Saint Pio asked his spiritual children not to give him a black eye.  This film gives him a black eye.  I hope you will not buy it.  Please seek out a documentary or a book made by those who loved and knew him, instead.  This film did not have the participation of such.  Perhaps you should ask yourself why.",1175040000,50,2821,4.519762845849803
199029,5,1586171941,"As a devotee of St. Pio, I have viewed many films and read many books about his life, vocation and ministry, but this film is superior to all the others combined. No movie has inspired or moved me as profoundly as this account of St. Pio's life. The acting is outstanding; the film is visually stunning, the music is beautiful and the characters are real human beings who attract, repel, evoke sympathy and compassion. Moreover, it offers the viewer deep insights into the true nature of the spiritual life, especially the lifelong battle with personal sin and the Evil Spirit, the role of sacrifice and ultimately, the redemptive act of Christ's Passion in conquering all the enemies of the Christian life and salvation. St. Pio comes alive as a thoroughly human figure who was granted extraordinary graces by God and appropriated them for the good of others.  This is a film to be viewed again and again, with much spiritual benefit.",1172793600,17,935,4.807453416149069
199030,5,1586171941,"This was a fantastic experience. Those that bash this movie are somewhat blind. They probably read padre Pio's biography written by the protestant bernard Ruffin. A protestant!!! Need I say more? This movie is Catholic to the core. This dvd depicts father Pio realistically. Care-ing yet with a backbone. He is slandered and persecuted by many, even of sins against the flesh. This is nothing new. Most saints suffer these things,alas, everyone suffers temptations. I now have a great devotion to padre Pio which I did not have before, thanks to this film. You will not find hollywood making a film like this. The acting is superb, the chosen actors are perfect for the script, the score is touching and its a very good production. The Italians did a great job. You can place this gem next to other gems like 'The Song of Bernadette', A Man For all Seasons, 'El Cid' and others. I have bought copies of this dvd for my Catholic friends and they've loved it. This dvd will help comfort and edify your spirituality.........for those that bash this movie, all I can say is that I'm positive the devil hates this flik as well.",1172793600,8,1122,4.671717171717172
199031,4,1586171941,"I am a huge fan of Sergio Castellitto, and as a frequent visitor to Southern Italy I wanted to learn more about the life of Padre Pio.  Although I am an atheist, I enjoyed this film very much, in much the same way that I enjoy visiting churches in Italy.  A surprisingly good, interesting film, that grabbed my interest until it ended nearly four hours later!  I recommend this movie to anyone interested in Southern Italian culture.",1171238400,37,433,4.597402597402597

Not only is it strong and ever-relevant but it is also extremely provoking. Having watched it two times I felt struck while watching it, and I experienced it also as really being a prophetic film. - This movie teaches a person as much about one self as it tells us about a marvellous capuchin friar, that is, if we allow our selves to be touched. I recommend this movie with joy to all Christian brothers and sisters.",1171065600,10,523,4.458333333333333

199034,4,1586171941,"I enjoyed this movie and I love Padre Pio and hope he is praying for me and everybody who reads this.  I recommend the book ""Padre Pio: Man of Hope"".  It is the only book I have read about Padre Pio.  It was written by Renzo Allegri, who also was involved with this movie.

For me personally, I like to know that the actors and people who make movies such as this one are really Christians.  I realize some people don't think that matters, but for me it does.  The fact that the main actor, according to the DVD notes, is not much of a believer, detracts somewhat from my willingness to wholeheartedly promote this film.  Because usually people like that depict saints as good men or women, maybe like social reformers or fighters for the poor and less fortunate, but they soft-pedal or overlook the fact that all the saint's goodness comes forth because they have made themselves a conduit of God's goodness.  Padre Pio prayed constantly - he said so himself.  I'm not sure the movie adequately conveyed that.  Sometimes I felt they were presenting Padre Pio as a man with special powers but downplaying the Source.  Sorry - that's just me.  Overall it is a good movie, though.",1170720000,6,1178,4.530805687203792

7799469,5,1586171941,"What a film! This is one of my favorite films and along with A Man for all Seasons and Molokai, is one of my favorite films about the saints. For those who don't know, Padre Pio was an Italian priest and is the only priest known to have received the stigmata--the wounds of Christ in his body. It may be easy for a skeptic to dismiss stories of the stigmata in someone from the Middle Ages but Padre Pio died only in 1968. The internet was already in its beginning stages by then. He was known by everyone; he and his wounds were examined many times by different doctors and no one could figure out a natural reason for his constantly bleeding hands. (His wounds bled for 50 years) He did it himself with a sharp instrument, some claim. Really? Don't you think a trained physician could tell a self-inflicted wound immediately. Also, those who do such things are desperately seeking attention for themselves and are usually suffering from some kind of psychiatric disorder. In contrast, Padre Pio did not seek attention and was not suffering from any psychiatric disorder. Unlike those who would wound themselves for attention, his focus was not on himself but on others--alleviating the physical and spiritual suffering of others. Well, he focused on the wounds of Jesus so much that it caused his hands to bleed, others claim. Since when does intense mental focus cause the flow of blood to reroute itself from inside of the blood vessels to the surface of the skin corresponding to the wounds of a crucifixion? Padre Pio's stigmata, along with the Shroud of Turin which also puzzles the many and varied experts who've investigated it, is a sign for an unbelieving age.

This film is extraordinary. First of all, it's beautifully directed and acted. The scenes where he receives the stigmata are very moving. It also consistently shows the reality of the spiritual battle going on around us. The scenes where the demonic breaks through and attacks him are very frightening. I wouldn't show these parts to kids. It also depicts the other miracles that are associated with Padre Pio. I watched it in the original Italian with subtitles because I like the realism of watching it in the language that he spoke. (And because the English dubbing is usually pathetic in these Italian films of the saints.) Overall, this is a wonderful depiction of a sincere and holy man who devoted his whole life to prayer and the will of God. It strengthened my faith.",1516320000,4,2449,4.73536299765808

The acting is good and the story is well executed and translate a lot of interesting facts about Pio's life into the film. My main problem is that the quality of the Ignatius Press release is so bad that the picture is comprised of huge pixel blocks! I can only assume that they skimped on quality in order to have a bigger profit margin per DVD. What a shame that this unique film seems to only be available in this lousy quality.
