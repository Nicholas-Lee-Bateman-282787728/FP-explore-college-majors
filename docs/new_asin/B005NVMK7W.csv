4849806,3,B005NVMK7W,"I watch a lot of B movies.  Typically, I segment them on the basis of watchable vs. unwatchable, original vs. derivative, then rank them based on budget and the inherent restrictions of the budget.  Not a science but it works for me and helps me decide what movies I rent would be worth owning.

This is a low budget movie that was filmed a couple years ago (just coming out on dvd).  It is definitely watchable and somewhat original however the characters are not fleshed out enough (no pun intended even though this is a ""vampire"" movie) and honestly it get's fairly boring near the end.  It's meant to be a dark comedy, though it's not really funny.  Worth a rental watch if you watch these types of movies but I can't see myself owning it.",1348012800,8,743,4.426470588235294
4849807,3,B005NVMK7W,"""The Revenant""  capitalizes on the current popularity of the zombie with a blend of horror and comedy.  American soldier Bart Gregory (David Anders) is ambushed and killed while serving in Iraq.  His body is shipped home and buried, but he soon rises from the grave and seeks the company of his best friend, Joey (Chris Wylde), a slacker with a ready wisecrack for every occasion.  The two buddies conclude that Bart is now a ""revenant,"" a combination vampire/zombie who's undead and has an insatiable thirst for blood.  At first, they try to satisfy Bart's urges by stealing blood from a hospital, but when they stumble on a convenience store robbery and kill the assailant, another solution comes to mind.  They'll roam Los Angeles' streets by night and do away with bad guys, thereby providing Bart with a steady supply of fresh blood and easing the city's crime epidemic in the process.

""The Revenant"" borrows elements from ""An American Werewolf in London,"" ""Death Wish,"" ""My Best Friend Is a Vampire,"" and ""Once Bitten.""  It's a blending of plot points in both vampire and zombie lore.  To satisfy horror purists, there is plenty of gore, and the writing is quite clever.  The rapport between Anders and Gregory illustrates that it takes more than death to break up a solid friendship.

DVD bonus extras include a making-of featurette, director commentary, deleted scenes, and photo gallery.",1347408000,,1397,4.978448275862069

4849857,1,B005NVMK7W,"Beyond a shadow of a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

There is no justifying this film's problems.

I actually wanted to see this film prior to Leo's The Revenant when I had first heard about it (and all of the acclaim it received) when it first came out. Paid. Off. Critics. I'm not sure if it's just friends, families and coworkers giving this stinker positive reviews but it needs to stop.

It is jaw-droppingly bad. First, the only good: Anders, the protagonist is a legitimately good actor that was actually trying here in.

And now, the bad.

From near scene one, the plotting is ATROCIOUS. The script, never once, ceases to plot-hole its way to the ending. From the title to the end credits, the sheer amount of narrative problems are staggering. The ONLY way this kind of crap could be written is by someone with no concept of writing who was given a lot of money by their parents to shoot something. It's infuriating that someone could be given everything they need to make a movie and they squander it all with this. Our duo discovers that you need to cut the heads off of those you ""suck"" from in order to keep them from coming back to life. What do they do? NOT cut the heads off. What happens? Of the dozens they kill without beheading, one randomly comes back and instigates a revenge story by way of killing our Revenant's buddy (no that's not a spoiler because this movie has none). However, just when you think the film is going to ACTUALLY HAVE A FOCUS and develop a vengeful plotline wherein the hero tries to avenge his dead friend and take out the evil gang responsible, the main character instead decides to try and repeatedly kill himself before the government captures him and the movie just ends. Seriously. A movie about ""crime-fighting zombies"" doesn't even get into crime-fighting when it actually has a reason to.

Another scene has police--FOR NO REASON AT ALL--gun down dozens of innocent people before shooting each other to death because the zombie... Get this... Stands up, faces them down... and runs past them. SERIOUSLY. SOMEONE PITCHED THIS AND A TON OF PEOPLE SAID, ""YES TAKE OUR MONEY AND MAKE THIS"".

As if that weren't bad enough the acting is downright embarrassing. The British girl can't even fake cry and the ""friend"" is a complete jerk and horribly unlikable Worse, the director chooses the most embarrassingly bad shots to direct dialogue heavy ""characterization scenes"". Instead of using a master shot and a back and forth between two speaking people, he instead chooses a single shot for minutes on end that reinforces just how bad the acting because there are no cuts.

The storyline senselessly moves along with little to no direction or point, very little action (maybe five minutes in total of the entire run time. That's including a terrible, green-screened montage as well) and some of the poorest writing and editing this side of Ed Wood. Things happen for no reason. Scenes are cut together for no reason. Characters say and do things for no reason. And then the movie just ends with a truly stupid epilogue that makes you wander why the movie ever even left the whole war scenario in the first place.

This trash is labeled as something akin to a horror buddy comedy but it's not. I never understood their friendship as the foil is a completely unrepentant jerk and the protagonist just puts up with him. And I'm sorry, but simply having your comic relief character swear and get joyful over drugs is not funny. At all.

I was hoping for this one to be great and instead, it's an insult to horror and filmmaking as an art.",1457395200,,3598,4.6430817610062896

It was a good laugh, and interesting enough that I was eager to watch more.  Watching with my significant other we stopped about halfway through the film and picked it up the next day only to find the movie crashed and burned shortly thereafter.  What began as an interesting story about a man turned undead and his friend helping him, turned more into a sort of mess of drugs, thugs, and more zombies then either of them could handle, then dove off the diving board from a bit off the beaten track of films into some mixture of 'we didn't think out funding through' and absolute chaos.

  And this one has the virtue of being clever.  What happens when regular Joes are granted the powers and immorality that come with the vampire experience?  Especially when one of the Joes is a slacker with more enthusiasm than ambition?  Well, funny stuff happens.
  And some philosophical puzzlers pop up too, to keep our mind busy.  Just what is the moral basis for draining people of their blood to continue your own vampire existence?
  I recommend this little vampire  for those with a couple of hours to spare.  I even liked the ending, which all too often in low budget films disappoint the viewer.",1425168000,4,898,4.5375

4849921,4,B005NVMK7W,"As you've read in the other reviews, this movie is a mixture of humorous and serious moments. Scenes where I wasn't laughing, but was still enthralled included the one where Bart's girlfriend cuts her arm to give him blood, and it turns erotic ; when he agonizes over cutting her head off while in her dormant sleep, to free her from a vampire future ; and his breakdown in the empty subway car after trying to fling himself in front of a subway train, and merely losing an arm. At this point, his girlfriend and his best buddy are both dead, by his hand, and he clearly wishes he was permanently dead himself. The plot dives in and out of serious and humorous sequences with a certain grace that I find pleasurable and well-done. Imagine yourself crawling out of your own casket, not knowing what the Hell is going on, and learning the ropes of being a vampire from scratch. The hunger never leaves you, but your humanity does, eventually, to make way for feeding yourself. Suicide is extremely difficult, and then the hunger overshadows even that.

As others have stated, the f-word gets used a lot in conversations between Bart and his best friend, and their friendship was an ""Animal House"" blend of bromance and immature squabbling that was a major vehicle for the humor. It kept things light enough to help out that porpoising in and out of seriousness, but it struck me as going a bit too far in that direction, at times. Something about the way Bart held his head in his hands as he contemplated a choice of horrors before him, or when he was wondering for the thousandth time why this was happening to him, touched me. As he is driven toward an insane, amoral, true vampire's orientation near the end , I wasn't laughing, and it was easy to forget the silliness elsewhere in the movie. I may have read tragedy into moments that were meant as humorous tragedy, but the acting was there, and I felt only pity for Bart. For me, Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" comes to mind as an example of a similar mixture of humor within an overarching horror. The humor is a delivery vector for solemn insights that are perhaps equally applicable to less supernatural stories. You decide.

But it didn't stop me from laughing when, say, Bart talks with his vampire friend's severed head in an unexpected and hilarious way.  I also think the undead makeup and props were very convincing, and the scope of the events in the story was well matched by the relatively modest budget. IMHO the movie didn't ""look"" cheap at all, but it may suffer from comparison to bigger-budget 'undead' movies like ""World War Z"", with a cast of thousands(mostly pricey CGI, of course). David Anders' portrayal of the hapless Revenant Bart was very convincing, and funny, but I thought it worthwhile to point out that, between the laughs, he makes us care.",1386720000,5,2820,4.636

4849924,4,B005NVMK7W,"*The Revenant (no connection to the fantastic Neonfly song of the same name) has currently been making its rounds on the HBO Channels. Since it was a Vampire movie I had not previously heard of, my curiosity was up, so I gave it a watch. It is an extremely low-budget, totally cheesy Dark Comedy. I loved it!

Lt. Bart Gregory [David Anders - well-known from Heroes, Warehouse 13, 24, The Vampire Diaries, etc.] was killed in battle. However, after his funeral and burial, he inexplicably comes back from the dead. He seeks out his best friend, Joey (Chris Wylde).

One of their mutual friends, Mathilda (Jacy King), trying to make sense of this deduces that Bart is either a Vampire or a Zombie. It's hard to tell at first sight - he's not as suave as most Vampires, but not as deteriorated as a Zombie, despite the weird eyes. Turns out, he's a Vampire. She keeps telling Joey to ""do the right thing"" and decapitate Bart during daylight hours, which Joey can't bring himself to do.

Thinking he's been given a Second Chance at living, Bart decides to use his new-found powers and abilities for ""good"", and he and Joey soon find themselves on the evening news as the infamous ""Gunslinging Avengers"" taking out the Los Angeles area's worst criminals (while feeding Bart's need for blood).

One nuance Bart & Joey forget to factor in is - how to stop any Vampire's victims from coming back as an Undead themselves. Big mistake! Another big mistake is - Bart's girlfriend Janet (Louise Griffiths) finds out that he's back - after having taken solace in Joey's arms after the funeral.

Incredibly surprising and unexpected ending, which I'm NOT going to spoil. You'll have to see for yourself.

This is one of the freshest takes on the Vampire in decades. It's a freaking train wreck throughout that you just can't look away from. Plenty of unanticipated surprises laced through the entire movie. You have to see this one at least once!

Although I thought the ending was so perfect and unbelievably if you watch the credits you will see that the last scene of the movie was actually shot in the exact place in Iran that it says in the movie!!  Man they must be ""dying"" for that film money over there in Iran!!!  BUT...how funny would it have been to have it setup for a sequel with those two in Vegas in that hearse-condo and just going nuts! If I was a cable network like FX, AMC (probably not AMC because of TWD), TNT etc I would pitch this as a series but more as a dark comedy where it follows the film script up until they get into the fight and they end up in Vegas!  I would watch it!  And if I'm honest I'd probably like it more than TWD!  TWD has some of the most ridiculous directing, dialogue and acting (there are some GREAT actors on that show though...although bad writing and directing can make any actor look bad so I shouldn't blame the cast.) But the show has been getting better from season to season.  I love when TWD super fans get pissed when it doesn't win anything at the Emmys or Golden Globes.",1372550400,3,1499,4.601503759398496

4849942,4,B005NVMK7W,"The Revenant is a mix of comedy and horror (but mainly comedy).  Hey, even if the writers *tried* to combine comedy with horror, by default the comedy would win out and overtake the horror.  This is the case almost every single time because the moment we realize a film is written for the purpose of laughs and jokes, that removes *all* potential horror elements immediately.  A lot of times movies are NOT able to succeed in attempting to combine both drastically different genres, but this film is perhaps a major exception.

Anyway the Revenant is about two friends that ultimately become vampires.  Actually the first half of the film is about one friend coming back to life despite the other one attending his funeral.  He shows up to his friends doorstep late at night and... there he is, before his friends very eyes, haha.  There's a catch though- he's not the way he was when alive.  He smells like decay, looks like crap, and has markings all over his face.  During this segment I could CERTAINLY do without all the swearing and especially dropping the F bomb several times a sentence.  I mean really, we don't need to experience that overused word *that* many times.  The word is constantly used afterwards too.

Later on, the other friend dies so we have *two* vampires going around town, finding themselves involved in convenient store gun robberies in the middle of the night, and drinking the blood of the dead bodies.

However, since this is technically a comedy, there's several laughable segments we see throughout the Revenant.  Perhaps the most memorable one is the two friends constantly trying to shoot and kill each other after a verbal argument only to not be affected by the gun blasts in the least.  Instead they stand back up and absorb more punishment while insulting each other, haha.  Another hilarious segment occurs when one character loses his head and in order for him to actually speak, his friend has to stick a... ahem, ""female device"" that provides intimate sensations up to his neck, lol.  The head says a funny line about this that had me and my father in stitches!

I actually really like the ending.  I won't spoil what happens but I wasn't really expecting what occurs, and it's a nice surprise at least.

If you're looking for a horror movie you're going to be INCREDIBLY disappointed since there's nothing scary about this one.  Perhaps the blood sensitive types out there would have a bone to pick with the many puddles and shirt-stained blood markings we see by way of gunshots throughout the movie, but other than that, this is all about the laughs and poking fun at vampires.",1356480000,,2624,4.748344370860927

There is good acting, good gore, solid plot. You even start to feel for the 2 main characters. This is not just a bloody slaughterfest and I wouldn't mind if it was. I like these weird flicks.

Bart Gregory (David Anders) is a soldier killed in action as the film opens. Just who killed him and how isn't quite certain but his body is returned home, given the full honors of a fallen soldier and he's laid to rest. Well not quite. That evening Bart digs his way out of his grave and heads to the home of his best friend Joey (Chris Wylde).

Of course this scares Joey at first but then he begins to worry about his friend. Thinking he's probably starving he makes him something to eat only to have Bart toss his cookies, an odd looking black ooze, on the floor. As the pair try and figure out what must have happened, they eventually decide that Bart must be one of the living dead and in need of fresh blood. Who says watching all those old horror films doesn't pay off.?

The pair begins by robbing blood from blood banks but inadvertently they discover another way to get the blood Bart needs. Stopping a crime they find that bullets have no effect on Bart. Invulnerable he stops the crime, kills the bad guy and then drinks his blood. A new crime fighting hero is born! It's as if Rambo rose from the dead and began taking back the streets from criminals.

Bart and Joey are suddenly in the spotlight though unseen. Because they're saving people from criminals the victims never offer good descriptions. Why would they want harm to come to those who helped them? Learning that the criminals they kill rise as well, the duo dispose of the bodies as they go along, something that will come back to haunt them later in the film.

Bart also reconnects with his fianc as well. Of course this lends itself to a rather awkward moment, especially when he learns that she and Joey slept together when they thought he was dead. But time heals all...well most...wounds and they are reunited once more.

Everything seems to be going smoothly for the pair until Joey gets shot during one of their encounters with bad guys. Rather than let his friend die, Bart turns Joey into a member of the living dead as well. But Joey has always been a screw up and he soon lets his new found powers go to his head. When one of their first victims returns for some vengeance of his own, there's no telling what will happen.

There are several things that make this film work. One is that they treat the subject matter as if it were real, as if it truly could happen. In so doing the movie has a certain vibe to it that makes the viewer think okay I can see that happening. The second thing it has going for it is a nice mix of comedy and horror that works as well. Scenes between the main pair are hilarious at times. A good example (seen in the trailer) is when they get in a fight and start shooting each other knowing good and well that they're both invulnerable.

The acting is done well here especially by the leads who must convince viewers that this is a plausible concept. The effects are done well and not too far over the top, something that could have ruined the film completely. The movie won't be one that everyone will love but horror and comedy fans will both be happy with the end product.",1352764800,,3471,4.370542635658914
4849949,4,B005NVMK7W,"The Revenant has its flaws sure, what movie doesn't?  BUT, it's flaws are literally dipped and smothered in horror, comedy and blatant gruesome fun.  The acting is great, the story is engaging enough and the plot is pretty straight forward, never mind the giant bullet-sized holes.  Without getting into spoilers here, if you enjoy movies like Phantasm, Re-Animator even Dawn of the dead, you can't go wrong here.",1352332800,,413,5.044117647058823
4849950,2,B005NVMK7W,"I was intrigued by the blurb, I was in the mood for some comedy and strange.  The movie started off okay, pacing was good, direction, cinematography, etc was fine and I liked the awkwardness of the film (film had a ""realness"" to it that most films like this just lack.  You had a feeling of how the film was going to proceed and it was okay up until the first 60 minutes.  Then the film just took a really dark turn that didn't quite match the tone of the first 60 minutes.  And then they do something pretty bad with one of the likable characters and they basically burn the bond between the main character and us-- the viewer.  So now, you are watching a movie for which you hate all the characters.  And the only thing worse than the change in the movie and direction is the ending.  Seriously, WTF?

This movie could have been a solid B+ movie but it just completely botched the last 20 minutes of the film.  Its like they didn't quite know how to end the movie...",1351468800,,968,4.245901639344262
4849951,2,B005NVMK7W,"I love all things related to the Zombie lore. I was a little disappointed with this movie. Parts where mildly amusing and funny, but overall I felt I wasted my money on this DVD. I felt the special effects just where not that good and the comedy got a little stale. Some of the things that went on with the main character where just too ridiculous for my taste. Maybe a fair rental but not worth the purchase price.",1350518400,,415,4.265822784810126
4849952,4,B005NVMK7W,Some very funny moments. Funny use of a certain piece of machinery. Some thinking involved. I really enjoyed this one. Would recommend this funny zombie movie. Sorry.. funny revenant movie.,1350172800,,189,5.333333333333333
4849953,5,B005NVMK7W,"The script was so well done. The plot was a riot. There wasn't a dull moment, as far as I'm concerned. If you like comedy and zombies, but haven't been all that thrilled with other funny zombie movies (I can't believe I'm saying it like that), The Revenant will NOT disappoint.

This is the best movie I've rented in forever. I couldn't be any happier with my choice. You've gotta watch this movie.",1350000000,,398,4.4520547945205475
4849954,4,B005NVMK7W,Thought this movie was very funny. I liked the different take on an much used theme. The story was good and I liked the actors. Just a fun movie. The ending was a hoot. Don't want to give it away but it has to do with where this movie starts and what was done to the lead actor before he was sent home. Give it a try just keep in mind it is not meant to be a serious scary movie.,1349827200,,379,3.691358024691358
4849955,4,B005NVMK7W,"This movie is zany and trippy and dark and, well, bizarre. It's definitely an original. Someone called it a ""zomedy"" and that it is... sort of. The comedic aspects are about as dark as dark comedy gets. I did find myself laughing out loud a number of times though.

Interestingly enough, this isn't exactly a ""B"" movie. It's quite well done--the acting is excellent, the effects are quite good when they are intended to be good (i.e. the talking head scenes), and cheesy when they're meant to be cheesy (like in the scene where a mortician moves the boom mic out of the way), the dialog is skillfully written and delivered, and the story line, though meandering and with no real meaty <snicker snicker> central plot, per se, (unless you think a story line consisting of 2 guys, one a zombie, driving around the city in search of hookers, drugs, and human blood is a particularly substantial story line) somehow still manages to be rather engrossing.

So the movie is a total contradiction. The heroes are really anti-hero slackers with only a few redeeming qualities but who still turn out to be likable somehow. Also, what we end up with here is a bit of a zombie origin story without really ever explaining the origin of the zombie infection. Yeah, I know that sounds like it doesn't make any sense but really, that's how it goes in this film and somehow it all makes sense... And finally, the mix of excellent special effects coupled with intentionally cheesy ones adds to the odd flavor (pun intended) of this flick.

As might be expected in such a flick: lots (and I mean lots) of gore, a wee bit of full frontal male and female nudity, plentiful drug use, and a sh*t ton of cursing.

I've taken 1 star off for some inconsistencies in the characters' reactions to situations.

If you like Dr. Strangelove, Harold and Kumar, and zombies, and particularly think the idea of all three mixed together into one glorious and grotesque yet brilliant mess of a delicious concoction sounds swell, you'll dig this flick.",1348963200,2,2015,4.6807909604519775
