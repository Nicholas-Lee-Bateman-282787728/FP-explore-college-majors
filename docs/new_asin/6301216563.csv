323070,5,6301216563,"BOTTOM LINE:

This was one of the biggest selling sports videos of its time (1989), and for good reason; it captured all of the unbelievable moments, moves, highlights and dunks of a Young Jordan - from his days in UNC, to his historic rookie year in the NBA to the days when he was a scoring machine!

Witness MJ start the whole marketing mega-trend that (sadly) helped make all of these new young athletes the overpaid crybabies that they are today. lol",1203984000,,455,4.536585365853658
323071,5,6301216563,"And if you're doin' drugs, stop it. Come Fly With Me captures the legend of Micheal Jordan in an exciting, and honest video. Fans of Jordan are priveledged to old commercials, and excellent NBA footage that demonstrates exactly why Jordan's star shines so bright. Narrated by Jay Thomas - who does a surprisingly nice job - the video illuminates Jordan's passion for the game as well as the pride in his family that drives him to succeed. It must be nice to be a natural at something...at anything; however, to watch Jordan take on the world's best and make their skills seem childlike is an amazing feat. The video actually offers to viewers a incredible insight into life and hard work. Come Fly With Me is able to be enjoyed, and understood by fans of any age.
Mr. Jordan - your video is inspirational!!! That's the ticket!",1192665600,,826,4.625850340136054
323072,4,6301216563,"I used to wear this video OUT at Blockbuster when I was younger, great old school basketball video.  COME FLY WITH MICHAEL.  Back when the NBA was actually fun to watch.",1133913600,3,169,4.419354838709677
323073,5,6301216563,"If you have any doubt who the greatest basketball player of all time is, watch this video. This film was made nearly 15 years ago and it still wows me. I'm from Chicago so it is a Windy City bias. But it is true he is the best. Before the championships and him beating the Bad Boys, Jordan dazzled fans all over the nation with his 360 dunks, sick layups, incredible game winning shots and his winning attitude is what made up of Jordan before he won his six titles. This video also details his early life with his family, his daily battles on his families Basketball court with his older brother Larry. Him getting cut from his varsity high school team and his eventuall stardom at Laney high school. His successful run at North Carolina, with star teamates, James Worthy and Sam Perkins. Him winning the 1982 NCAA title against Patrick Ewing's Georgetown. Also relives his 1984 Olympic gold medal. Him being drafted third by the Bulls. Being passed over by the Portland TrailBlazers for.... Sam Bowie!!! The video also goes over Micheal's dramtic rise into stardom in 1984-85 where he won Rookie Of The Year. He then breaks his foot in early 1986 and he came all the way back, despite the Bulls front office telling him not to do it. He came back with fire, when in the 1986 playoffs, he scored 63 points against a team with four hall of famers, Bill Walton, Robert Parish, Kevin McHale, and of course, Larry Bird. This video is a gem to own, for any basketball fans, and MJ fans. Also, you can find this video on the Ultimate Jordan DVD collection, which I also own. You will love it.",1108857600,5,1587,4.475862068965517
323074,5,6301216563,"This is easily the best NBA video around. I wasn't sure at first but when I watched Jordan's gravity defying dunks and shots it blew me away! It has got more spectacular highlights than any other NBA video I have ever seen. It starts off with Jordans childhood on the baseball field,then his brilliant college days,then to the best stuff...his early days in the NBA where he earned lots of awards. Made before he stunned the world by leading the Bulls to a double three-peat,this tape captures the glory days of both slam-dunk contests,his injury and how he came by it  to become the best player ever,all his dunks,lay-ups and game winners,his success in the olympics in L.A,and his own commentary on what it was like to be such a star performer. There is also some footage of his greatness at golf aswell. Only one dissapointment,not enough footage of his All-Star games. I ordered this over-seas because Britain dosent sell NBA videos. Also great service from Amazon. Buy this if you are an NBA fan and want to witness the greatest player ever...AIR JORDAN!",995587200,3,1059,4.755434782608695
323075,5,6301216563,"This is the number one selling sports tape of all time.
I used to watch this tape everyday and I know the hold tape
by voice threw. This is not even my tape when I moved from
my old neighborhood I kept his Jordan tape from my friend.
Even if you don't like Jordan you will find youself captivated
by his work ethic abilities and achievements. This tape is
addicting you will find yourself watching it late at night for
no reason. This tape can also inspire you to workout or if
you want to get hype for a local church tournament. The piano
part at the very begining is also nice. MICHAEL JORDAN COME FLY
WITH ME THE BEST SPORTS VIDEO EVER .I hope they put this classic
on DVD!",985478400,4,676,4.1679389312977095

323110,5,6301216563,"Come Fly With Me covers the humble beginnings of NBA legend Michael Jordan. It tells the story of his middle-class childhood in North Carolina,his rise in the NCAA ranks being part of the University of North Carolina Tar Heels and his early seasons with the Chicago Bulls from 1984 to 1989 - the year this video was released. Added to that,it also explores his life at North Carolina,his participation in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics when the United States won the Gold Medal and when he was drafted third in the 1984 NBA Draft.

This video is obviously lacking considering that it only includes part of Jordan's illustrious career in the NBA.Also,it was also released during the time before the Chicago Bulls NBA championship run started. But nevertheless,it could be enjoyed by any Jordan fan for we get to see highlight reels of his great moves as well as his athletic ability on the court. While it may not satisfy those who want to learn more about the man,it would surely entertain those who love Michael as it celebrates his legend on the court.",1410739200,,1053,4.7228260869565215
