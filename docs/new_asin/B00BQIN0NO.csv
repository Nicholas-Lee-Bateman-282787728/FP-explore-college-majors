8572509,5,B00BQIN0NO,We love this.  My 4 year old is learning how to read and this is so awesome.  I wish they spelled the words out loud instead of just showing on the screen but the songs are catchy and my 4 year old can recognize the words outside of watching the video.  Even my 3 year old is getting into it.,1514246400,,292,3.8333333333333335
