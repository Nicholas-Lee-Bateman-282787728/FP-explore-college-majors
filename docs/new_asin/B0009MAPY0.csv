8062986,2,B0009MAPY0,"Great show. But the epics were different than description stated. Completely different episodes. However, it easily became my 3 year olds favorite Arthur movie. Only problem is it skips on episode 2.",1465689600,,199,5.25

8062990,5,B0009MAPY0,"Our family enjoyed this episode about a Woogles fad that Arthur first tries to resist, and then, later gets caught up in.  It is so funny and true to life.",1246233600,,155,4.166666666666667
8062991,3,B0009MAPY0,"Sorry, the above was sarcasm. There are no true special features on this DVD. In fact, if anything, things are only getting worse with the poorly designed look of the main menu for this DVD.

This is a Sony Wonder ""Arthur"" DVD release, rather than one of the OurTime Family Entertainment releases, which at least play at having special features. At least the story content on this DVD is fairly decent. There are three stories, as per usual:

""Arthur's First Crush"" --- In which Arthur crushes on his new babysitter after he finds out that she's a teen who loves ice cream and is great at video games. Not nearly as bad as it might sound.

""1001 Dads"" --- Arthur believes Buster is sad because his parents are divorced and he won't be attending the Father's Day picnic. A fairly serious story, but a lot of fun bits as well, including Binky dressing up as a Dad.

""What Is That Thing?"" --- This one is just good fun. Arthur's friends find a mysterious ""thing"" and each put it to a different use.

There are previews for eight other ""Arthur"" DVDs on this and it has instant/continuous play. I guess that's sort-of like special features. There are close-captions and it appears to me as if the stories have actually been recaptioned for the DVD release. (I'm a big enough follower of the show to tell.) However, there are no other audio options.

If you haven't seen these episodes or don't have them on personal tape/DVD, then this release might be worth it. Otherwise, I'd say definitely don't pay for this --- I got it at the library.",1134345600,8,1535,4.543478260869565
