6517111,2,B00LZUYM80,The Murder at Roadhill House is based on a true crime.  True crime is so sordid and the telling is so dull.  I'm sorry I watched it.,1525564800,2,132,3.8518518518518516

6517114,3,B00LZUYM80,A period drama does not make it any better if there is no drama.  The acting was wooden.  There seems no purpose.,1525392000,4,113,4.090909090909091
6517115,5,B00LZUYM80,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film,. The fact it's based on a true event makes it very intriguing. I was amazed at the after event facts displayed at the end of the movie. 100 years! Wow!",1525392000,4,181,4.352941176470588
6517116,5,B00LZUYM80,"The first episode had me at hello. It was based on a book written by Kate Summerscale. It was actually based on a real crime. Had I known there was a book,I wouldve read it first before watching this. If you're a fan of Agatha Christie you will like this. The second episode was just as good. Third was okay. In the fourth and final episode,we finally get to see Mr. Whicher get what he deserved. I wish there were more but it wasn't meant to be.",1525132800,4,446,4.137931034482759
6517117,5,B00LZUYM80,Loved this entire 4 episode series. Wish they'd made more.,1524960000,,58,4.9
6517118,4,B00LZUYM80,"This is a nice period piece set in Victorian England, about a police detective (Whicher) endeavoring to solve the mystery of a child who disappeared from his crib one night, and whose body was found the next day on the manor grounds.  Was the murder committed by a member of the rather large household, or an outsider?  And why?  This is the premise of the first installment of a series of four produced. Each episode involves a new and separate crime/mystery.  As such, each episode can be a stand-alone film, though there is some continuity of story in the background of Mr. Whicher himself.  Thus, it is desirable to view them in order to get the fullest sense of continuity.  The episodes in sequence are:

1)  The Murder at Roadhill House
2)  The Murder in Angel Lane
3)  Beyond the Pale
4)  The Ties That Bind

The stories are interesting enough to keep your attention, though there were times it did seem to drag a bit.  Not enough to put me off, but enough to say, don't expect any sort of wild, action-filled ride at any point in this series.  No adrenalin here, just a quiet, leisurely stroll down the storyline.

The settings are good, and do evoke the period fairly well.  The cinematography is quite beautiful and make it a luscious pleasure to watch.  The acting is consistently good.  All facets of production are the basic state-of-the-art expected in a modern production of this sort.  I found the title character, Mr. Whicher, somewhat lacking in charisma; whether this is a fault of the actor himself, or the way he was written, I cannot say.  Again, it is not enough to put one off, but I found myself wishing I could be a little more drawn to him.  He did grow on me after a few episodes.

Basically this is a well-produced series which will primarily appeal to viewers who like beautifully photographed period shows, with enough of a mystery to keep you interested.  Great to watch when you are in a mellow mood, like right before bedtime, and content with something on the quiet side and not too demanding intellectually.  All in all, I really enjoyed it and rather wish they had decided to make a few more episodes.",1524009600,109,2139,4.568421052631579

6517121,5,B00LZUYM80,"What I love about this movie: excellent acting! OLD FASHIONED detective work! No CCTV or DNA testing to make the case, just observation, interrogation, and lots of thinking.",1531526400,,173,5.214285714285714
6517122,5,B00LZUYM80,Absolutely brilliant! Paddy Considine is perfect in the role. Wish they would make more.,1531526400,,88,5.357142857142857
6517123,2,B00LZUYM80,"Underwhelming.  The story was rather buried in heavy-handed message, and there was very little payoff to the numerous hints and implications.  The general tone and closing scrawl made it seem like the BBC considered the killer, not the detective, to be the protagonist of the tale.",1531440000,,281,5.086956521739131
6517124,3,B00LZUYM80,"I'm a bit torn. I watched all the way through, but ended  up disappointed. I felt the ""who""-dunnit was revealed a bit too soon, though I hoped it would be a different outcome. I suppose this was an attempt at verisimilitude on the part of the writers and director. It seemed that, based on a true story, and a period piece, they chose ""authenticity"" before drama. But I require a little more 'spice' in my viewing. Also, I don't care for dramas that have no humor (not necessarily riotous, just amusing) in them. There has to be a leavening at some point in order to make it more interesting for me.",1531353600,2,599,4.396396396396397

6517127,3,B00LZUYM80,"felt realistic in that the detective doesn't always get the answers he wants and he constantly questions himself as to why he leans toward the suspect he does. Intense at times, you aren't sure whether you are rooting for Whicher or not. We were surprised at the end reveal. You're used to the main character being unusually brilliant, even if they are on under dog or a bit of an outcast, but you do expect them to prevail & be recognized among the masses that they are exceedingly clever, almost to the degree of being supernatural ...this  is not that kind of detective !",1531008000,,574,4.519230769230769

6517132,5,B00LZUYM80,"This is undoubtedly one of the b est mystery films of all time for acting, character development, cinematography, you name it, it is fantastic! Warning! you need an IQ over 120 to enjoy it! ;-)",1530662400,2,193,4.542857142857143

6517136,5,B00LZUYM80,A good representation of the true crime book without all the historical fluff. I think any true crime buff would enjoy it.,1530489600,,122,4.590909090909091
6517137,5,B00LZUYM80,"Based on the true story, but enhanced (facts aren't overshadowed)  by the author's theory (book written in 2008). It's expertly acted, and the setting is well done. Perfect for those who have an interest in true crime",1530403200,,217,4.864864864864865
6517138,5,B00LZUYM80,"Quality period piece, so don't expect 21st century pace or tidy who done it. Here you will get gorgeous costume, music and set, the suffocating sense of social pressures and hierarchy, a repressed protagonist in deep personal pain trying to make the best of his talents in the service of justice, and the vagaries of real life. Well done!",1530403200,,338,4.745762711864407
6517139,1,B00LZUYM80,This movie could have been a ton more interesting if they had presented all the facts in a more intriguing way. The ending was bland because they never bothered to close it properly bringing all the facts together.,1530316800,,214,4.657894736842105
6517140,5,B00LZUYM80,Great story.  Good script.  Great acting.,1530316800,,41,5.666666666666667
6517141,4,B00LZUYM80,"This is a very entertaining detective story, with good production values and acting.  The story presents twists and turns galore and everything is realistically presented.  My wife and I were engrossed throughout and it was a nice way to spend a little entertainment time.",1529971200,,272,5.159090909090909
6517142,4,B00LZUYM80,"These are dark, slow moving and rather depressing, but captivating at the same time.  They are a nice change from the foul language filled police dramas we have today.  It is easy to get involved in the story and there are lots of twists and developments until we reach the conclusion.  Nice settins and costumes from another time period - such gentility!",1529884800,,355,4.693548387096774
6517143,5,B00LZUYM80,Wonderful and enjoyable. the characters were believable and spot on in their roles. I am hooked on Mr Whicher,1529884800,,109,4.7894736842105265

6517145,5,B00LZUYM80,"Mr. Whicher examines the dark and broken human experiences of grey lives in a quietly menacing part of England.  It is subtle, cerebral, and softly compelling.  Mr. Whiche perseveres to do his duty.  This is outstanding, with the proviso that it slowly unfolds.  Exceptional acting throughout. I'm all for this - well done!",1529712000,,323,5.037735849056604
6517146,1,B00LZUYM80,started out strong as Mr. Whicher is depicted as an accomplished detective with integrity who is committed to a ruthless search for the truth; unfortunately his character inexplicably changes upon pressure to get a conviction...totally unconvincing and a waste of half an hour.,1529712000,2,277,5.465116279069767

I did not have to skip scenes with fast forward because of the graphic volence and sex (when did we resort to porno?)  What did I like the least?  I wish he would shave sometimes? Isn't the stubble the thing of modern TIMES? but maybe he hadn't the time?  Was it too expensive?  In episode 4, hope he shaves when he goes for a walk with the pretty landlord!  Make more, BBC!",1529539200,,462,4.181818181818182
6517150,5,B00LZUYM80,Wow!  This Mr. Whicher Suspsions DVD is absolutely great..  I hope they make more Mr. Whicher episodes.  I recommend adding this movie to your DVID mystery collection.,1529452800,,167,5.111111111111111
6517151,1,B00LZUYM80,"This was 91 minutes of an unlikeable, overly righteous man patronizing sympathetic suspects, and then being vindicated at the end. Despite the speech at the beginning, there was absolutely no science used in his methodology. I only watched it to the end hoping for some kind of ineresting twist. Whicher is like the anti-Sherlock Holmes. Terrible.",1529452800,7,347,5.214285714285714
6517152,2,B00LZUYM80,"Very disappointing.  The story is completely lackluster.  I know it's based on a true crime, but it could have been dramatized better.  Here is a detective badgering a suspect for 90 minutes even though he has no evidence.  No plot twists.  No surprises.  Just agonizing boredom.  Well-acted.  Well-costumed.  Well-staged.  But poorly written.",1529452800,4,343,5.423076923076923
6517153,5,B00LZUYM80,Great job retelling a true story. Held my attention and loved the character development.,1529280000,,88,5.357142857142857
6517154,5,B00LZUYM80,"Excellent rendering of a real-life detective who lived from 1814 - 1881.  I wished Mr. Whicher was more assertive but he probably reflects the times when he lived.  He had been a laborer who passed the physical and literacy tests to join the Metropolitan Police in 1837.  Four years before Edgar Allen Poe wrote the first private detective story, ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"". He was one of the original eight members of the Detective Branch which became Scotland Yard.  The historical environment, costumes, and character demeanor were terrific.  This murder and subsequent activity really did occur at Roadhill House as depicted in this film.  Don't want to spoil. The underlying British class and aristocratic fallacies play out well in this and the other Whicher films.  Due to it's quiet and unassuming cerebral nature, I don't recommend this to anyone looking for blood, guts, gratuitous sex, and violence.  You won't find it here.  If you're a fan of British mysteries you may find it a little slow at times but interesting to watch.",1529280000,11,1039,4.959537572254336
6517155,5,B00LZUYM80,"This period true crime mystery is based upon a beautifully written and well researched book by Kate Summerscale that details the murder investigation that surrounded an appalling murder that occurred in England in 1860. It is a fascinating true crime story, and this film does it justice.

When three-year-old Saville Kent was found murdered, his throat savagely cut in the outhouse at the home of his well-to-do parents, suspicion immediately fell upon the family and their servants, as it happened during the night, when the child was sleeping, and nothing was taken from the house. After all, who else  might've murder this innocent child? This murder outraged the public and generated much press coverage throughout England. When the incompetent local police came up empty-handed, Scotland Yard stepped in, sending their best detective, Jonathan Whicher, to spearhead the investigation.

What Whicher surmised from his investigation was that, indeed, one of the family members was responsible.  Though he eventually formally accused one of them, the evidence proved insufficient to bind the accused to trial and provoked a public outcry against Whicher, effectively ending his career. Years later, he would be vindicated by an amazing turn of events.

This period true crime drama is simply terrific, with an authenticity of time and place. The acting is excellent and, coupled with a compelling story that stays pretty true to the book upon which it is based, those who love true crime,as well as period dramas,  will be riveted. I most definitely enjoyed it!",1529193600,9,1564,5.261044176706827

6517162,1,B00LZUYM80,The story was not interesting and no one likable in the story.  I wouldn't recommend anyone take the time to watch.  It was very disappointing.,1528848000,2,143,4.68

6517165,5,B00LZUYM80,I just watched the first of the four movies from this series and thought it was brilliant. It kept you guessing until the end and the fact that it was based on true events made it even more intriguing. I just wish there was more than just four episodes.,1528588800,,253,4.183673469387755

6517167,4,B00LZUYM80,"I thought this was very enjoyable and well worth the watch. Whicher is not a normal film detective. He's the 'best' but has a lot of rough edges and isn't smooth or polished....probably what a real detective at that time would have been. He's thwarted all along the way by the family and local police along with great pressure to solve the case by the press and politicians. He gets the right person but is thwarted, again, by politicians, into hurrying his case.
Well written and acted. Not your 'normal' British detective mystery but still well worth a watch.",1528156800,,561,4.6767676767676765
6517168,5,B00LZUYM80,"This is no. 1 of the 4 Whicher films. Based on Kate Summerscale's book (I have not read it - yet) and the real life Jack Whicher, Scotland Yard's ""prince of detectives"" and his most difficult case. Asked to get to the truth of a child's murder without convicting any of The Wrong People, Whicher treads carefully, opening dark cupboards of a well-off Victorian household. Relationships between a man, his wife, and their housekeeper - who becomes his second wife; hinted incest between brother and sister; and hate between step-siblings all appear in the mix. In true Victorian fashion, the well-off want a scapegoat among the servants, and to be left alone in their darkness. Whicher eventually finds the answer - but cannot get a conviction. The real killer, though,eventually does come to justice. Transiting to fiction, Whicher leaves the police force when he fails to get a guilty verdict, and becomes a ""private inquiry agent."" In real life, Whicher remained with Scotland Yard for many more cases. Cinematography and lighting in this and all the Whicher films is amazingly good. It contributes greatly to their effectiveness. If you want car chases and shoot-outs, look elsewhere, but if you want a carefully plotted, truly engaging, well-written and acted Victorian murder mystery, you will like this.",1528156800,20,1309,5.093023255813954

6517171,5,B00LZUYM80,"I don't watch many mysteries, BBC or otherwise, but happened upon this one and enjoyed it. Among the interesting twists was the craziness and tragedy of this particular family, and how even a veteran detective like Whicher could not get involved in the case without getting thrashed around by that craziness. Also, something which I don't think one would see very often is the protagonist frequently coming out poorer by comparison in encounters with a very young woman. The courtroom scene where the locals thoroughly abused Whicher was interesting. A pleasant surprise.",1527897600,,571,5.217391304347826

6517180,5,B00LZUYM80,"The BBC excels in historical crime series, as evidenced by Garrow's Law and this series.  The story is moved along through various twists and turns that seem characteristic of fiction.  The actors make their characters seem real--and they are real.  The story is true and you learn at the end what happened to the principles.  Mr. Whicher, the detective, might be compared with Sherlock Holmes, but Paddy Considine makes him more than a thinking machine:  he has human emotions and his own compassion is an even greater obstacle at times to crime solving than the layers of bureaucracy he must overcome.",1527206400,2,603,4.930693069306931
6517181,3,B00LZUYM80,"An interesting story, but very little in the way of drama. Whicher seemed to zero in on Constance as the perpetrator way too early, with only suspicions and not a single shred of evidence.

6517183,3,B00LZUYM80,"The story moves a bit slow and some of the acting is mediocre, but I didn't hate it. I was disappointed that Peter Capaldi is in it, but thought it might redeem him as an actor as my first exposure to him was as Dr. Who. I thought perhaps my dislike of his acting stemmed from an inferior portrayal of Dr. Who rather than his talent but he is awful in this as well. There are a couple of very unlikeable characters (intended to be unlikeable) who do actually do a decent job portraying their roles (won't name them to avoid spoilers). The lead is dour and pensive, but that's the character. It lacks the charm of most British detective series (not fun like Midsomer Murders or Grantchester; dark along the lines of Ripper Street but more plodding in tempo); but it intrigued me enough to watch the next one in the series to see if it matures into something better.",1526688000,3,864,4.372670807453416

6517185,5,B00LZUYM80,Did not find this 2011 first episode until after viewing the others. But it worked as if that was the way it is to be viewed. Brilliant!,1526428800,,136,4.074074074074074
6517186,5,B00LZUYM80,i love Victorian drama and this delivers! Loved every episode!!,1526342400,,63,5.4
6517187,5,B00LZUYM80,"I discovered Mr. Whicler and his crime solving last week.  I hate to say that I didn't start with this one as it appears to be the first.  Love a who-done-it and BBC knows how to do it in England in the 1800's.  The clothing, mansions, gardens, and horse and buggies were just beautiful. Really enjoyed these.",1526169600,,309,4.385964912280702
6517188,4,B00LZUYM80,"This detective drama/mystery/period piece is a bit too dour.  But the BBC production has great writing, great period-correct costuming and lots of good acting. Our widower-protagonist is depressive, and there is little humorous or upbeat in this production.",1525737600,5,257,5.7631578947368425
8669240,1,B00LZUYM80,"Spoiler alert:  This may be my American sensibilities talking, but what the heck was the moral of this movie? I found myself siding with the unruly mob more often than not.  No, it is not brave and true for an inspector to stick to his intuition and prosecute a citizen based on his gut feeling without evidence, even if he turns out to be correct in the end.  And here I thought Hollywood values were perverse. This movie was freaking terrible with an unethical message.  I kept thinking he'd have an awakening, or there'd be some twist where we all learned something, but no.  He was just a terrible inspector abusing his authority, who was portrayed as a hero and inexplicably won in the end. The explanation of what happened was wholly unbelievable from a human behavior perspective as well, and poorly supported - an impressive feat considering it's based on a true story.  Characters completely underdeveloped. Not even a fun period romp.  Boo.",1533600000,,950,4.7560975609756095
8669241,5,B00LZUYM80,"Just a very well done mystery series that didn't last long enough. Lots of familiar character actors in key roles make for a well acted, well written, smart series.",1533168000,,164,4.689655172413793
8669242,5,B00LZUYM80,"Based on the book ""The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher"" written about a real life 19th century detective, the film is fairly close to the sense of the book, basically that the detective's suspicions were correct. The film is correct, according to the book; Mr. Whicher had early suspicions of Constance, but could not prove his suspicions to the exact facts needed.  No, this is not a typical murder mystery tale; it is about the instincts of the truth by a detective in the very early days of such a profession. He was, thus, a ground breaker, a path finder, in real life long before the current tv series tales and rehashed plots.",1532995200,,626,4.589285714285714
8669243,3,B00LZUYM80,"Not the best  on this genre that I love. A very thin ""mystery"" and not very well developed characters means you don't really care about anything that happens.",1532649600,,158,4.642857142857143
8669244,5,B00LZUYM80,"Very well done Victorian-era mysteries. The protagonist, detective Whicher, is a sympathetic, if not flawed man, whose instincts lead him to the culprits. Well plotted to keep you guessing. I only wish the series had more episodes.",1532563200,,231,5.27027027027027
8669245,5,B00LZUYM80,Incredibly well done!,1532476800,,21,6.333333333333333
8669246,5,B00LZUYM80,This was really good.  Glad I forked over for Amazon Prime and discovered it.  Can't wait to watch the others.,1532476800,,110,4.45
8669247,5,B00LZUYM80,"I read the book directly before watching the movie (which I would recommend doing) and I am thoroughly impressed with how true they stayed to the book. Of course they had to condense it a lot - some of the information is presented by more convienant ways for the format. But almost -everything- is correct. When a movie touts itself as based on a true story you expect a good deal of artistic license, but this is the truest true story I have ever seen. This is probably the one movie you CAN watch for your book report and get away with it. lol",1532304000,,545,4.25
8669248,5,B00LZUYM80,"Well done, intriguing all the way through.  The Victorian atmosphere was greatly supported by the costumes, the music- but the camera work was so fine that it does feel like one time travels to the very place of a child's brutal murder.  The actress who played Constance was impeccable, very well done and I highly recommend this film for it's historical accuracy and all over feeling of a great burden not only upon the inspector and the cast of characters- but certainly the viewer as well.  I have watched all four of The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher and this is my favorite and will stay with me for some time.  Appreciated the explanation at the end in the credits as to what happened to the family members later on in life.  Disturbing.",1531872000,,739,4.568181818181818
8669249,4,B00LZUYM80,"Very realistic period murder story. It reminds the viewer that there was a time when accusation was enough to destroy people. And that the rich had their own law(just like today). The acting is good, and highlights that murderers and police are just people, and both can be difficult :)",1531872000,,286,4.74
