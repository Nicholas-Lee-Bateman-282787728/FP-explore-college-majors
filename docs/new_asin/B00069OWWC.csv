8251725,2,B00069OWWC,If you know a thing or two about soccer and ball handling exercises: This DVD is not for you. It is a very basic selection of ball mastery exercises that can be used in game situations. Nothing really new.,1489968000,,205,4.282051282051282
8251726,5,B00069OWWC,"I think this video is excellent because not only does it develop both feet, it also incorporates sole of the foot ball control(foot pull) which is a skill that all Brazilian youth players develop through Futsal. I have taught the fut pool to my 9 year old son, and his ball control has improved 1000%.  He is not fast but he can get out of trouble now.  He couldn't in the past.  I now coach a U-11 girls team and they have abeen learning slowly, but surely.",1280016000,,458,4.241379310344827
8251727,4,B00069OWWC,"Great for coaches or players.  As title suggests, this teaches techniques for footwork.  The coaches are easy to follow and the video slows down enough to see each move.  We've used some of the basics with our 9-11 rec. team.  The average rec. player couldn't handle the more advanced moves.  But the better players catch on and really improve their game.  Even the basic moves have made our team's footwork impressive.",1208476800,2,419,4.830985915492958
8251728,3,B00069OWWC,"This video came recommended by one of our professional soccer coaches.  As a recreational soccer coach, I needed some additional footwork moves for my team.  She suggested this video, because this is what recreational coaches are not teaching.  She said footwork is crucial if the player wants to play soccer in middle school,high school and beyond.  Many of the kids today lack footwork ability.  Being able to handle the ball effectively and under the players control will give an edge to the team. In reviewing this video, the moves are good and effecive but complicated at the beginning.  This video shows 6 moves.  In order to teach anyone of any age, the moves need to be broken down. The kids love learning new moves if you make it fun and the outcome is acheived. Don't expect them to learn the 6 moves in one season!",1159315200,6,825,4.6482758620689655
8251729,1,B00069OWWC,"I am wanting to get a refund.  I could not find a number to call anyone.  The DVD is too simple.  This is a case of false advertisement.  The TV ad showed a demonstration with complex moves that my 13 year old wanted to learn.  He has been playing elite soccer for several years now, and playing recreational since the age of 5.  He is not a beginner, he plays on the #1 U13 team in the state of Georgia.  I am saying this so that you understand that he would not have wanted it if he knew how basic it was.  It was definately for the beginner, not at all what we were led to believe by the ad.  I want a phone # to speak to someone about this as soon as possible and I want a refund because of misleading advertisement.  My phone number is 770-287-8350 or 770-842-8350",1156204800,9,769,4.033112582781457
