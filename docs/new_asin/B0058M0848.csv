4599813,3,B0058M0848,"The story plot was good as well as the actors who portrayed in in. Action was dispersed throughout most of the movie and the blind man, very much along the lines of ""Zatoichi"" did a good job. Overall, I rated this movie as just ok in comparison to many Korean martial arts movies that I have seen that I have rated very good especially in regards to the plot and the fight scenes.",1322784000,,380,4.219178082191781
4599814,4,B0058M0848,"The movie is set months before Toyotomi Hideyoshi's invasion of the Korean peninsula and portrays two relatively obscure historical figures. Mong-Hak Lee, an illegitimate son of the king, led a rebellion that ended in failure, and Jung-Hak Hwang was one of the top three medical practitioners in the Chosun Dynasty. The plot is simple - a son pursuing his father's killer - but what makes the movie interesting is the historical background. The society was so mired in rigid class system that prevented certain people (e.g. illegitimate children) from rising farther regardless of their abilities, and the ruling class was so bent on party politics that one would automatically oppose the other regardless of the facts (i.e. both parties knew that the Japan invasion was imminent).",1321401600,10,781,5.2063492063492065
4599825,5,B0058M0848,"i didn't know what to expect when i bought this movie but it turned out to be really great. if you grew up watching those old kung fu movies back in the 70's & 80's, then you'll like this one. it has action, comedy, & friendship.
to save you the time, before watching this movie, go to the set ups & set your language & subtitles to english, unless you can understand their language.
great movie, worth buying, i judge movies by looking at if i got my moneys worth or not, i enjoy watching this movie & still continue to watching it over & over several times now",1390176000,,562,4.165137614678899

4599830,5,B0058M0848,"I really liked this movie, awesome sword fighting scenes and the storyline was well written! the only thing I did not like was the references to sex and the brothel section.",1376265600,,173,4.612903225806452
4599831,5,B0058M0848,This was a great film in terms of both acting and production.  Through and through a enjoyable film.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.,1363219200,,139,4.75
4599832,4,B0058M0848,"This story has its roots in the Joseon era of Korean history, with political upheaval and power struggles between different factions and an impending invasion by the Japanese. The film has received its share of criticism, mostly around the assessment that the plot was aimless and never developed into a solid storyline. It's been about a year since I've seen this film and I was hard pressed to recall what the movie was actually about, so there is probably some merit to this criticism (or I'm just getting old). What I can tell you is that I enjoyed the film when I watched it, and in my list of martial arts movies I've seen, which is up to about 200 entries, this is among 40 films that I've flagged to watch again.

One character in particular that I enjoyed was Hwang Jeong-hak, a unassuming blind swordsman. He is the most colorful and three dimensional character in the film - a mix of humor, humility, wisdom and bad-to-the-bone fighting skills. As in the Zatoichi series, there is the play of other characters underestimating his abilities and the ensuing melee which is always great fun.",1355961600,10,1099,4.694300518134715
4599833,2,B0058M0848,"It really wasn't what I thought it would be. Terrible voice acting for this late in the genre. The main character couldn't even fight. A total rent, I wouldn't recommend spending the money...",1339891200,,191,4.818181818181818
4599834,5,B0058M0848,"There's a Zatoichi type blind teacher in this who is comical and fun. Sure it's a mild twist on the story of getting revenge for one's fallen teacher, but it's entertaining.

The head wear in this movie is a trip to see. The work they put into the costumes was nice. It's good entertainment and a high quality visual experience.",1331596800,4,328,4.466666666666667

8461819,3,B0058M0848,"I liked the blind master. He was well played. The story not so much. I know it is a period sword revenge movie. Not expecting an Academy Award winning movie here. However, I have seen some pretty well done movies in this same genre from the various movie powerhouses of Asia yet this is not one of those. Entertaining? Sort of. Certainly not the worst offering out there, but you may want to pass on this one if you have high'ish standards.",1469318400,,440,4.378048780487805

8461821,1,B0058M0848,"I couldn't watch this movie.  Not sure if is me or the way it is filmed, but I felt like it was shot too close up.  I felt like I was in the first row of the movie theatre and stopped watching it after about 10 minutes.  Maybe it's a good movie, but I wouldn't recommend it.",1464739200,,274,3.7719298245614037
