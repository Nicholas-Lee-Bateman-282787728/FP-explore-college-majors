8585109,2,B00CQRNLQU,"I was disappointed in the second season.  It reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock Presents (the half-hour show in the 1950s) because all of the episodes have an unhappy ending.  Also, reminds me of Tales from the Crypt.  If you like that sort of thing, then I guess you love season 2.  To me, however, the first season of the Alfred Hitchcock Hour was great: it was suspenseful and I was pleasantly surprised at the end.  I don't know why they don't have these videos in region 1, though.",1493596800,2,483,4.443181818181818

8585112,5,B00CQRNLQU,"For the longest time, I wanted to own ""The Allied Hitchcock Hour"" on dvd however I finally gave up any hope that it would be released on region 1.  I finally broke down and purchased a multi region dvd player and am glad that I did.  Such classics as ""The Sign Of Satan"" starring the late, great Christopher Lee and ""The Final Escape"" with Ed ""cooky"" Byrnes are wonderful and chilling by even today's standards.  I hope all fans of ""Hitch"" take the plunge with this great and classic tv series.",1471305600,3,494,4.406593406593407
