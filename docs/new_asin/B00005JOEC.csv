1569689,5,B00005JOEC,I remember this show when I was a kid. I don't think I've seen it since then. And I still love it. Quaint and loveable. Particularly because Meredith and David actually fell in love while they were on this show. I very happy to have this but my set has audio problems. On all the discs it seems I have to lower the volume and make it higher on just about every other episode. I thought it was a DVD production problem at first but I see that no one has mentioned this in any of the reviews here. Since I don't know anyone else who has purchased this can someone help me out and let me know if they have or haven't had any audio problems. This way I will know if it's my set or it's a problem with the production of the DVDs. Thanks in advance. I'm still giving this 5 stars.,1370822400,,774,4.0

1569692,5,B00005JOEC,"This series played when I was a young boy.  It was one of those probrams the whole family would gather around the television to watch.  In review, I can understand why it was popular.  Meredith Baxter and David Birney were beautiful together.  You could almost see a spark between them, and rightfully so, since they also became real life husband and wife. Their characters displayed great respect and moral value.  Meredith is the daughter of actress Whitney Blake who played Dorothy Baxter on Hazel, and David was a breath of fresh air to everyone who tuned in to watch the program.  I am so greatful it has been released on dvd.  I brings back a happy time in my life. I whole heartingly recommend Bridet Loves Birney to anyone who remembers the early 1970s.",1360454400,15,761,4.634328358208955
1569693,5,B00005JOEC,"This DVD set is great!  The picture quality, color, and sound all appear as though the show is on the air today instead of back in  1972.  Thank you Amazon!",1358899200,12,156,4.133333333333334
1569694,5,B00005JOEC,"Absolutely one of the funniest and, for its time, revolutionary comedies of the 70's. the scripts are clever, full of ironic jokes, and a refreshing contrast to what usually passes for situation comedy today. Print wise .... Kudos to Sony. Deep rich colors and perfect clarity...you think you're looking at blu ray. Audra Lindley is a highlight, but Bibi Osterwald as Mrs. Steinberg shines with a comedic and sympathetic portrayal of her character. Everybody is good, though. Stereotypes? Yes, but there are Catholics and Jews like these characters today and they are totally likable. A great showcase for interfaith understanding. Get yours today! It's wonderful.",1358812800,14,664,5.333333333333333
1569695,3,B00005JOEC,"My copy of ""Bridget Loves Bernie"" arrived a few weeks ago and I've made my way through it. Having only read about it in TV reference books, BLB has the dubious distinction of being the highest-rated TV series ever to be cancelled (due to protest letters CBS received from religious groups). Viewing the series today, the outrage seems ridiculous as this show is one of the most innocent and innocuous series to hail from the Watergate era compared to ""All in the Family"" and ""Maude"". Created by Bernard Slade, who also brought us such controversial fare as ""The Partridge Family"" and ""The Flying Nun"" (that's sarcasm, folks) this series has the same innocent flavor filmed with three cameras and an over-enthusiastic laugh track that can grate on one's nerves during marathon viewing.

The stories are your standard Screen Gems scripts that mine comedy from the culture clash between Bernie's Jewish deli-owning family and Bridget's upscale Catholic parents. Actually, as Bridget's Mom and Pop, the real scene-stealers here are David Doyle (""Charlie's Angels"") and Audra Lindley (""Three's Company""). Together, these two make the show somewhat enjoyable even more so than the younger stars.

The series is ok but a little bland for my taste--not as campy as ""The Brady Bunch"" or intelligent as ""Mary Tyler Moore"". Where this release does shine is in the print quality. The episodes look absolutely fantastic for such an obscure series. Sony really went all-out in remastering these--the colors just pop and they even included the original Screen Gems closing logo on all episodes. **NOTE** Check out the screen grabs I posted in the Images section of this product to judge for yourself.

THREE STARS. Interesting to view for historical purposes and somewhat fun thanks to Doyle and Lindley, otherwise just an average early '70s innocent sitcom.",1356220800,32,1843,5.116279069767442
1569696,5,B00005JOEC,"""Bridget Loves Bernie"" was given the greenlight by then President of CBS Fred Silverman in the fall of 1972. In order to switch his network from rural programming like ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Hee Haw"" and to a more urban style of television quality Silverman demanded shows with more intelligence with a bit of controversy added.

 In September, 1972 ""Bridget Loves Bernie"" premiered on a Saturday night sandwitched between the then #1 show ""All in the Family"" and airing before ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"". What resulted was ""Bridget Loves Bernie"" capturing an amazing audience, becoming a Top 5 series (the sitcom finished fifth for the year) and critics loved it. But there was trouble.

 The story focused on the love affair between a Catholic woman (Meredith Baxter) and a Jewish New York City cab driver (David Birney who was fresh of his stint on daytime's ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing""). Because of a huge viewer backlash who sent thousands of letters to the network demanding the series be taken off the air for having such a coupling and being afraid advertisers would pull out CBS decided it just wasn't worth it and axed the show. As of 2012 ""Bridget Loves Birnie"" remains the highest-rated television series on North American network TV to ever be cancelled.

 Rarely seen in syndication because only 24 shows were produced Sony Pictures has announced that for the very first time ""Bridget Loves Birnie"" will come to DVD on December 4th through its Warner Brothers Archive Collection and Amazon's CreateSpace websites. This will be a 3 disc set.

 Ironically, Meredith Baxter would marry David Birnie and later would accuse him of severe mental and physical abuse in her memoirs after decades of marriage.",1351036800,,1729,4.958477508650519

1569698,5,B00005JOEC,"I can't say enough good about this show. It wasn't all about religion. There was the episode where Bridget took over the deli; or the camping trip; or the film mix-up. The ensemble cast was fantastic, with Ned Glass and Audra Lindley nearly stealing every episode.",1152489600,11,264,4.760869565217392
7941862,5,B00005JOEC,"I have been looking for this series for YEARS!!  So happy to receive this set.  There are one or two very slight glitches, but in just seconds it continues to play - does not diminish my enjoyment of watching these shows.  I was a little girl when Bridget Loves Bernie first aired, but it stayed with me all these years.  What surprises me a bit, is how timely the story lines are to today's world issues.  The clothing may be outdated, but the message is still on target.

A rainy weekend, curl up with a big bowl of popcorn, pop in the DVD, and just enjoy.",1510272000,,558,4.216981132075472

7941868,5,B00005JOEC,"When my wife and I were married back in the early 70's, this was our favorite TV show.  We couldn't believe when it was canceled after onlyone season, despite its popularity.  Turns out some religious types sent a lot of hate mail since it promoted interfaith marriage.  (I've heard it was the highest rated show ever to be canceled!)
It never found its way into syndication, and was never available on DVD.
Finally, two years ago, Amazon made it available.  I ordered it as soon as I learned it was available, and watched it with some trepidation.  Would it still be good???
YES!  In spite of the many years since we had last seen it, it's still a great show.  I love it.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1417392000,4,694,4.504

7941871,5,B00005JOEC,"I love this DVD set!! Sony did an excellent job on remastering every episode of this delightful one season series. I had just graduated from High School in June, 1972 when this series debuted three months later in September. Like any guy of that age I was looking for the perfect girl that doesn't exist. So Saturday evenings we (my Mother & Brother & I) would watch Bridget Loves Bernie in between All In The Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show. The subject matter was how an inter-faith marriage could work in a family setting with parents, in-laws, a brother who is a Priest, and an uncle. I would never marry someone so different from my own faith, then or now, but the humor and subject matter was refreshing to watch then, as it is now. It has been so pleasurable  to watch this series from beginning to end again. The video and audio quality is just as if it was produced today. It was fun to see the cars we all drove in that time period. Wow. Each of the stars did a superb job in the development of their own characters throughout the season. The material was presented in a straight-forward and positive way, the show was a major hit, so I don't understand how CBS could have canceled the show over some 'hate mail' from that era. Perhaps CBS was questioning how many episodes they could produce from an inter-faith marriage premise. A couple of years earlier CBS canceled the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour over censorship, and at the end of 1971 was when CBS got rid of all their rural shows. The powers at be were definitely trying to re-brand themselves.

So if you like good, clean family humor and like the stars, I would say buy this series. You won't be disappointed that you did, if you like nostalgia like I do.",1378598400,6,1732,4.443396226415095
