8412591,5,B00419T0SY,"Together the two books:

  The Essentials of Ba Guay Zhang, by Gao Ji Wu and Tom Bisio
  The Attacking Hands of Ba Gua Zhang, by Gao Ji Wu and Tom Bisio

And the 3 DVDs by Tom Bisio:

  Bagua Concepts Volume 1: Ding Shi
  Bagua Concepts Volume 2: Lao Ba Zhang and Linear Applications
  Bagua Concepts Volume 3: You Shen (Swimming Body BaGua Lian Huan)

Make a good intermediate program and to advanced program in Gao style Bagua Zhang.

The books are very well illustrated with lots of photographs.  But are still sometimes hard to follow.
With the DVDs the system is much easier, but will still take a long time to follow.

This combination makes previously unavailable information, especially in the area of applications, now readily accessible.
