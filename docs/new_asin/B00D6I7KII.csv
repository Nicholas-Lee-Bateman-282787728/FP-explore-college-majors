5775634,4,B00D6I7KII,"It takes time to understand this movie. For the beginning 10 minutes you won't get to the main story line but you need to be patient. Then it turns out to be an amazingly dramatic love story. However, if you are straight, I don't recommend you to watch this because the underlying affection is hard to be understood.
BTW, the second story about the infant in the dead mother's womb is also touching and astonishing. The movement  underwater mimicking the infant is sooooo beautiful.",1401667200,,482,4.738095238095238
5775635,1,B00D6I7KII,Quality and story line had nothing. Would not recommend to anyone for even casual viewing with another person. would not rent again.,1390176000,3,132,5.045454545454546
5775636,4,B00D6I7KII,"Pay attention. This can be hard to follow.

This is the story of an art professor telling two lesbian students about an intense, romantic experience she had with a female drifter/grifter when she was younger.

The actresses are pretty. The sex scenes are good.",1390176000,5,260,4.886363636363637
5775637,2,B00D6I7KII,This movie jumps from plot to plot and it is very confusing from beginning till the end. I wonder why they make movies like this?,1388016000,2,129,4.2
5775638,3,B00D6I7KII,"This is a somewhat convoluted tale of a young lesbian woman's life.  A depressed young woman goes thru the motions of live after she experiences a bad break up with her lover.  An energetic young friend and a worldly art teacher help her to recover her life by helping her relive the past thru a series of backstories.
This movie is a bit slow, especially near the beginning, and rambles quite a bit, but does eventually get where it's going.  Strange activities and events will confuse and distract you, but will help the movie's ambience, and on the whole are fairly entertaining.
  There are several sexual scenes in the movie, but other than a man's rear, no actual nudity is shown, though they expose about as much skin as humanly possible in several long sexual actions.
  While this is no Emmy winner it is well acted and not a bad story.",1387411200,9,845,4.556291390728477
5775639,5,B00D6I7KII,"A fascinating movie;  beautifully photography/scenery. Not my usual movie theme, but I find foreign films interesting as a change from most of Hollywood pablum. (I won't mention which of the two lead characters kept me watching due to a similarity to a pubescent unconsummated 'crush') My only regret is that as an American I got the feeling that I did not fully comprehend some of the Korean cultural norms/symbology: e.g., beautifully photographed two alternately filling of glasses with red wine, eventually splashing/overflowing. I can guess at the meaning, but am I right? (Something like trying to translate into English a Japanese poem, trying to preserve some sense of rhythm without significantly changing the author's intent.)",1426118400,3,736,5.4
5775640,5,B00D6I7KII,For the movie man I think this movie is great for being another movie made in another country must think of people in other countrys,1424304000,,132,4.32
5775641,4,B00D6I7KII,I thought this film was quite interesting. This film was quite brave by Korean and maybe even western standards. All in all I enjoyed that fact that this movie wasn't set up in the typical linear fashion. This is definitely not a cookie-cutter lesbian film.,1423785600,,257,4.733333333333333
5775642,1,B00D6I7KII,"Gave up on the movie after the first 20 or so minutes, in a story that revolves aroung an art facilitator taking their nude models to the beach and extracting the tales of their love lives with both men and women, in a lesbian drama that is boring and hardly worth watching.

Don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of crap.

If you're searching for some excellent lesbian drama, go instead for Loving Annabelle, Blue is the Warmest Color, A Perfect Ending or Spider Lilies.",1411257600,2,483,4.540229885057471

5775647,4,B00D6I7KII,"For the most part, people underestimate films like this, but this film can be good if you fully understand it and you watch the movie from beginning to end. Most films usually focus on a Man and woman loving each other but this one is two women loving each other and the hardships they went through. Overall i enjoyed it",1405987200,,320,4.35

8590005,1,B00D6I7KII,"I concede that I am race blind, meaning that I have some difficulty distinguishing faces, or recognizing the same face when the person is dressed differently. However this story jumps back and forth between past and present so much it was very difficult to follow. That the woman who initiated the same-sex relationship ended up leaving with a speech about being ashamed and never having wanted it is confusing as hell. I kept hoping things would become more clear and they never did",1504656000,,483,4.831325301204819

8590012,4,B00D6I7KII,"I don't understand the poor reviews. The storyline can be hard to follow at times, but the women (especially Kang Jiwoo) had real depth and the cinematography was really gorgeous. If you're looking for a light rom-com, a romance that ends happily, or relationships that are easy to understand, then of course this won't satisfy you. But if that's the case, I don't see the need to go out of the way to write a bad review if this wasn't even the sort of movie you were looking for in the first place. And personally? As a queer Korean woman I really loved this movie - twisted timelines, fucked-up characters and all.

Be patient, watch it all the way through, and don't expect everything to be explained explicitly for you. This movie doesn't say a lot directly, but it shows you everything you need to see to understand it.",1436832000,8,824,4.530201342281879
