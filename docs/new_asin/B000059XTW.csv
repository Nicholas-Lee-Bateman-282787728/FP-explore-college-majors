8323536,1,B000059XTW,"There are several versions of ""Taming of the Shrew"" floating around out there.  Each with its strong points. Howard Keel's is the closest to the original. Richard Burton is the most flamboyant and fun. But this animal has no social redeeming value and lacks any memorable actors.

This film counts on camp to distract from the bad acting and pore timing.  It is worse than a high school play. Karen Austin  as Katherina is more sex than shrew. Everyone else is just duffus.

8323537,1,B000059XTW,"One star is too high a rating for this production of Taming of the Shrew. It was so campy and cheap that it was a torture to watch. I wanted to throw something at the screen everytime Grumio mugged directly into the camera lens.  The tinny and repetitive synthesized music is also extremely grating on the nerves. The cover literature of this cheaply packaged disc makes a point of stating that ""English accents... are absent from this series"" in order to achieve ""clarity of both language and story."" Translate this as: ""Dumbed-down for North Americans."" I'm insulted! This disc is awful at any price.",993686400,,602,4.788461538461538
