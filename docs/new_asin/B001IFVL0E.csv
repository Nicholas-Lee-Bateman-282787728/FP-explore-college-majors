3648367,5,B001IFVL0E,"'Live in Maastricht II' is a must see for anyone that likes Andre Rieu.
 The entire production is superb. This is Andre at his best.
 The highlight for me is Melissa Venema who plays ""Il Silenzio"" on the trumpet!! This little gal is only 13 years old and plays solo trumpet better than anyone I have ever heard.
 The new singer Mirusia Louwerse does great with ""Ave Maria"".
 My copy was ordered from the 'Andre Rieu' website in Holland and I would guess it will be available in the American market before too long.
  I would rate this at ten stars but they only let me do five.

3648368,5,B001IFVL0E,"The page says ""discontinued by manufacturer"" but that's not correct , it has been released in Europe and the international version will follow over the next 6 months into 2009 though there may be some variation on the bonus tracks and or sub titles depending which part of the world you are in.
Andre Rieu is currently the worlds biggest act,and 500 people have to go on tour with him. His son is in charge of the huge logistics EG the first Melbourne concert
Nov 13th 09 was no exception where a massive 6 million dollar replica of a Austrian Palace was recreated complete with an ice rink & ballroom! The sheer scale is amazing.
Live in Maastrich 11 is in my opinion is his best DVD so far it's a total package and the guest acts often steal the show ,in this case 13 year old
Melissa Venema who plays ""Il Silenzio"" on the trumpet!! Amazing! The other real high point is the performance with the world-famous Mastreechter Staar male voice choir, I know that a lot of critics say Rieu is a bit like a highly sophisticated version of the ""Wiggles for adults"" constant action, variety, humour but all great fun. Ok maybe, but it's still the best breathtaking showbiz experience on the Planet",1226534400,43,1190,4.513888888888889
3648401,5,B001IFVL0E,"Andre Rieu has given many great concerts but this one tops my list! It has everything you can imagine and then some. What fun and absolute musical enjoyment! I could hardly stop crying for joy. I wanted this DVD especially because of Melissa Venema's performance of I1 Silenzio--very moving and then it was followed with Leroy Anderson's Bugler's Holiday--what fun. Soprano soloist, Mirusia Louwerse is phenominal also and then there's the men's chorus. Well--for lovers of good music this DVD is a must! I found I had to order it directly from Andre Rieu's website. I had originally ordered it from the U.S. but it wouldn't play in my DVD player. The amount charged from the Rieu website isn't listed in American money, so I'm not sure what I'll be paying, but I don't care--it is worth whatever.",1379376000,2,797,4.782608695652174
3648402,5,B001IFVL0E,This is by far the best Rieu video I have seen yet.  Truly awesome.  I especially enjoyed the 13 year old girl with the trumpet.,1376524800,,128,4.08
3648403,5,B001IFVL0E,"As always, Andre Rieu's programs are the best! The music is delightful, and the views of Maastricht that are included on the DVD give you the feeling of being there in person.",1370995200,,175,4.5
3648404,5,B001IFVL0E,Great music with even greater conductor full of charisma and a great sense of humor. The atmosphere on the concert is amazing. You can see people having a good time. Amazing music performed by talented artists. A must see video.,1360540800,,228,4.725
3648405,1,B001IFVL0E,"The DVD was in Black and White, and had no subtitle.  The listing showed it in color with several subtitle. I'm sorry to miss this one...I have 20 Andre Rieu DVDs, this is the first one that was a disappointment.",1355875200,,212,4.3

I was surprised to to see Marissa sing two numbers and the other two ladies not sing any.  I hope Andre knew what he was doing because egos can be very fragle.",1264550400,,270,4.38

The fault may have been with amazon.com, because the page listing this item that led me to the alternate seller clearly stated the format as NTSC. Is this a lack of communication between amazon.com and its associated sellers? I did get authorization from importcds to return it, which I have done. I await credit to my account. I just ordered it anew from Andre Rieu's website, where you can clearly select PAL or NTSC.",1263686400,2,555,4.56

3648431,2,B001IFVL0E,I ORDERED THE ANDRE RIEU MAASTRICHT 2 DVD FROM GROOVES. THEY SHIPPED ME A PAL DVD AND REFUSED T REPLACE IT OR aCCEPT THE PAL DVD BACK. THEY INSISTED THEY SHIPPED ME A NTSC CODED DVD. THE BOX THE SHIPPED DVD CAME IN  SAYS ON THE BACK IT IS A PAL DVD. THIS COMPANY SHIPS FROM BERLIN GERMANY AND EVEN SAID THEY HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK FORMATS ON DVD'S THEY SHIP. IF YOU WANT LIVE IN  LIVE MAASTRICHT 2  DON'T BUY FROM GROOVES. THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS SELLING ON AMAZON WITH THE ATTITUDE I HAVE ENCOUNTERED AS YOU WOULD EXPECT I CANNOT PLAY THE DVD.,1256083200,6,551,4.179245283018868

3648433,3,B001IFVL0E,"I almost gave 5 star for this DVD, except they took 2 of my most favorite songs in the concert (therefore I took 2 stars out) - Mirusia's ""Waltzing Mathilda"" and ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down""; they are among the top fun songs I have ever seen in Andre's concerts. The rest, many are 'replays' from other concerts. Glad at least Melissa's trumpet and the ""Conquest of Paradise"" are still there.

Andre, pleaseeeee bring back the Kangaroo.. !!",1248393600,2,434,4.636363636363637
3648434,1,B001IFVL0E,The problem with this dvd is that it will not play on american dvd machines. It is not advetised that way by this vendor I e-mailed them a couple of times to ask if they have ones that will play on my type of machine but they never respond.  That being said from what I have seen on the internet this is a great dvd. I wish I would have payed more attention to the reviews of others before spending the money on some thing I canot watch.,1247788800,,437,3.965909090909091
3648435,1,B001IFVL0E,"The DVD I received was in the incorrect regional format.

I am unable to view it so I mailed it to a friend in Germany.

That should not be too difficult to correct.  This has happened
to other people as well....why??!!",1246406400,3,219,4.2926829268292686
3648436,5,B001IFVL0E,"""Live in Maastricht II"" is a feast for the senses.  Andre has selected incredibly beautiful music for this concert, and even if you own a lot of Rieu's music, you will still want this (and the CD, too).  ""Conquest of Paradise"" stood out for me, where the drumbeats and the incredible voices of Maastrichtener Staar, (the Dutch queen's mens' choir) shake your home speakers and your chair.  There are so many purely powerful performances and memorable soloists (including the Platinum Tenors, a 13 year-old trumpet talent, outstanding sopranos).  Andre conducts a lot in this performance, and it's riveting to watch.  The only thing missing for me was seeing Andre perform solo at least once during the concert - at times, the stage has so many performers that he gets lost in the spectacle.",1245542400,2,790,4.909774436090226
3648437,1,B001IFVL0E,"The DVD is great.  HOWEVER, I am unable to play it on any of my DVD players.  I can only watch it on my computer.  I have yet to find out why.",1244592000,7,142,3.375
3648438,5,B001IFVL0E,"DVD Andre Rieu LIVE IN MAASSTRICHT 2
I also ordered this DVD Andre Rieu Live in Maastricht 2 and they sent the PAL format instead of the NTSC format listed in Amazon. Of coarse my DVD player on plays NTSC region 0 or 1 for US & Canada.
What is going on here, does this Vendor have the NTSC version? Matter of fact, I send them an email four weeks before I ordered this, requesting verification of NTSC and never got a reply. That indicate to me that it was a no brain- er and not going to be in a PAL format, that in fact it is what it states-NTSC... Not very good customer relations from my stand point. Amazon needs to monitor their vendors more closly, Jeff Bezos....

UPDATE:
It appears it will not become available in NTSC. I bought a new DVD player that plays all NTSC & PAL. Problem solved. Most DVD mfg. are now including both formats. Just check the model capabilities before buying...",1242432000,16,894,4.289940828402367

Since I live on the border with Mexico, this time I just went ahead and purchased an inexpensive multi-format dvd player that plays all regions including Europe's PAL...BUT AMAZON AND ITS PROVIDERS SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL IN IDENTIFYING THEIR DVD FORMAT, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS NOT U.S. It was very frustrating but I really enjoyed it.
