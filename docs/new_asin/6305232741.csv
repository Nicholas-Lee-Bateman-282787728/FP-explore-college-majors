7886147,3,6305232741,"Good picture quality. So, so storyline. A man takes over his uncle's failing car wash & decides to hire a bevy of beautiful women in bikinis to bring in customers. At first, it works. But he realizes that it's not all sunshine and bikinis! He must contend with a greedy ADA hell bent on closing down the car wash & the Notorious Flasher, who has own, similar agenda.",1396915200,,366,4.397058823529412
7886148,4,6305232741,"No one in this film would ever win an academy award for anything, no would the film itself. That aside, you'd have to look long and hard to find a film with more T&A (good stuff) than this ones got. The movie itself and the dumb plot are childishly enjoyable. One of the most hillarious elements is the carwash owner who seems to be immune to any type of testosterone attacks despite the fact that he's got scantily clad(or not!) women running around all over the place waiting for the chance to have sex! One hillarious film.",1054857600,5,526,4.43298969072165
7886149,5,6305232741,"I have spent my life looking for the perfect T&A movie.  This one is the one.  As an adolescent I grew up watching this, and now as an adult I am honored to finally own my first copy.  I will cherish this DVD with all my heart, and it will never leave my house. Thank you soft porn producer Joe Dusic, Thank You!!!",1043625600,17,314,3.9523809523809526
