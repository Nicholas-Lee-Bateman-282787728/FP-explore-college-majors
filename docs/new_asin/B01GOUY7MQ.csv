For trying to preserve classic 1970's-1980's adult films
The dirty little secret most people either don't know or are ashamed of knowing is
The Adult entertainment industry gave the VHS Market the boom it received
Corporate Assets features the 1985 AVN Best Actress Winner Sheri St. Clair!

This is a classic/retro film i never knew of but, it has one of the best legit Director's (Thomas Paine)
and a who's who cast of actors and starlets
Is this film for everyone I wish i could say yes But, in the age of the Internet and easy access to porn
People have become a little desiccated  people need to watch the girl next door tied to a cross and beaten by a naked fat guy dressed in a Easter Bunny  costume nothing is special anymore  Which is a little sad
For everyone else that actually understands what was going on during the golden age of XXX
This is a must have
This is the 3rd edition on the dvd format
Previously released by  VCX and released  08/2004  (It's out of print) a used copy goes for up to $70.00
Caballero Classic dvd which is also out of print
Caballero dvd's are usually a mixed bag 1/2 the time there release look like straight-up VHS transfers
Other times they are passable as Laserdisc transfers
Caballero hardly ever actually remastered any film they released
Which makes this version worth owning
It's scanned and restored in 2k from the original 35mm camera negative (it looks close to flawless you could easily think it's a blu-ray)
It's only real negative is lack of any major special features
You get two extras the Original theatrical trailer, and a video interview with actor Eric Edwards (which is cool actually)

Cast include:
Amber Lynn, Bill Margold, Eric Edwards, Francois, Harry Reems, Herschel Savage, Jamie Gillis, Nick Random, Paul Thomas, R. Bolla, Rachel Ashley, Robert Bullock, Sheri St. Clair, Tamara Longley, Tish Ambrose

Corporate Assets shows that it takes more than hard work to get to the top. See how J.W. Sieverson, Chairman of the Board of a huge conglomerate, uses his elite corps and allies. These incredibly beautiful and sensuous ladies give the guests everything that they ever fantasized about and even things they could not even dream up themselves
This was one of the adult blockbusters of 1985 when the Golden Age was drawing to a close. It was the directorial debut of Thomas Paine, who`d been working on the mainstream side of the movie industry and remains active in the adult part of it to this very day, and presented one of the best possible combinations of plot and porn ever concocted. The always underrated Tish Ambrose delivers a career performance as Jill, mother hen to a handful of callgirls used by wicked Robert Bolla for corporate blackmail schemes. Though the story`s involving, it may disconcert some viewers that there is occasional violence to be found, sometimes in conjunction with the sex. A very well-acted adult classic, a tribute to days gone by when the adult tag meant more than just explicit sexual content.  9.2/10",1472688000,11,3069,4.795454545454546
8763218,5,B01GOUY7MQ,Vinegar Syndrome does it again with a great transfer of this film. I remember seeing it in the theatre in Chicago in the mid 80s and Tish Ambrose was there and spoke to audience after film. Great adult film with good acting,1470700800,9,223,4.333333333333333
