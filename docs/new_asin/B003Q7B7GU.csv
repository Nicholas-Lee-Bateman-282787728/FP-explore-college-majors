4165608,3,B003Q7B7GU,"WWE Intercontinental champion Dolph Ziggler VS Kofi Kingston: A pretty good opener but Nexus beats up both men too cause a no contest. Nexus then cuts a promo for the main event.

Alicia Fox VS Melina: A decent womens match. Lay Cool beat up Melina after the match.

The Big Show VS SES in a 3-on-1 Handicap match: A decent match-up as CM Punk walks off during the match and Show double pins Mercury and Gallows.

Miz cuts a promo about WWE needing him. I know people go nuts for this guy and i'll admit he's good on the microphphone but WWE will screw this up. Super Cena will probably beat this guy. Anyways, I liked this promo.

WWE Champion Sheamus VS Randy Orton: A very good match, better then I expected. Sheamus tries all his finishing moves but Orton keeps kicking out. Sheamus then gets a cheap disqualification. Orton delivers an RKO to Sheamus on the table and Sheamus is out for a long time.

World Champion Kane VS Rey Mysterio: I thought this was a very good match. Mysterio had some pretty good counters. I loved the tease of the Undertaker thru out the match as fans expected it. Undertaker goes after Rey but soon goes after Kane.
Undertaker looks old but he just came off an ""injury"" but he still looks very old; Kane tombstones Undertaker and sets up the feud once again.

Nexus VS WWE: I yelled Holy sh&* when they announced Daniel Bryan, even though WWE apparently ruined it by displaying a story about Bryan's return before the main event. WWE dominated the match for the first half; Hart even looked great for the first time since his return. The match was a see-saw affair with Bryan quickly eliminating one of the Nexus. Miz comes in and hits Bryan with his briefcase and Bryan is eliminated. Hopefully, Bryan will not get buried by WWE now and he takes the US title away from Miz soon. Anyways, Cena gets the two quick pins on Gabriel and Barrett and Super Cena wins it for WWE. Nexus sucked since Bryan was fired and this was the nail in the coffin of Nexus. I don't know where Nexus will go after this but I'm glad Bryan is back.

Overall, I have yet to hear anything positive about Summerslam 2010. I don't understand why the only had six matches. The first hour did suck and the only highlight, for some, was the Miz's promo. Orton/Sheamus was good but the ending sucked, Kane VS Mysterio was very good and had suspense with the Undertaker teased thru out the match, and the return of Daniel Bryan was easily the highlight of the evening. I hope Bryan isn't buried in WWE and I can see him winning the US title from Miz on the Night of Champions ppv. I enjoyed the last three matches but the first three sucked.

SUMMERSLAM 2010

This event was all about the Nexus trying to take over the WWE and the return of the Dead Man. Also this event would show case the return of Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart to action, I love it.

1.[I-C TITLE] DOLPH ZIGGLER VS KOFI KINGSTON-the opening match like last year's was an I-C title match and again with Ziggler. Unlike last year though he was actually coming in the champ, this time against Kofi so it should be great. Now this had the potential to be a really great match but it was only a decent opener. The action was pretty good with Ziggler controlling most of the match. Kofi had moments of offense but not much in comparison. Still it does not matter as Nexus attacks both wrestlers in typical circle beat down style. Now I kinda liked it because it fits who they are and their characters, but an event like Summer Slam should have great conclusions to title matches. 3/5

2.[DIVAS TITLE] ALICIA FOX VS MELINA-as usual we get the typical divas match here with the fan favorite getting the upper hand. Not only has that but fan favorite and hometown girl Melina got the title. Now the action is good enough for this match but the ladies of TNA are much better, except Natalie Neidhart [love her as se is actually really good and a part of the legendary Hart Family]. LayCool or as I call them the fake Beautiful People [a female team in TNA] make an appearance at the end. 2/5

3.[3 ON 1 MATCH] BIG SHOW VS STRAIGHT EDGE SOCIETY-for some reason although this was far from a classic match it felt like a Summer Slam match. Maybe it was the 3 on 1 giant thing but I liked it. The action in this one was just fun and was nothing more than that, I like every one involved in this match. Over a good match on the Summer Slam card. 3.5/5

During this time the always entertaining Miz came out and said he would join Team WWE. I have always thought that this guy was hilarious so I enjoyed this moment on the card.

4.[WWE TITLE] SHEAMUS VS RANDY ORTON-this was one of the best matches on the card as these two went at it again. The action in this one is back and forth for the most part with Sheamus trying to pick Randy apart. But regardless of all that the match ends in a DQ after Sheamus throws the ref to the out side. The RKO at the end was cool especially since the table did not break, love that. 4/5

5.[WORLD TITLE] KANE VS REY MYSTERIO-this match of course was really nothing more than a match to further the Undertaker being attacked storyline. Really if you go back and watch this Rey does not do too much, well compared to his normal matches. Kane dominates most of this match and even ends it with a great chokeslam, but it is after that when things get interesting. The Undertaker returns and it seems Rey is going down, until he lets it be known Kane was the guilty party all along. 4/5

6.[ELIMINATION MATCH] TEAM WWE - BRET HART, JOHN CENA, CHRIS JERICHO, EDGE, JOHN MORRISON, R-TRUTH, & DANIEL BRYAN VS NEXUS -I still feel The Miz is hilarious but it was cool to see Bryan in there. But the absolute best thing about this match is that Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart was back in the ring. My brother loved it more than me because Bret is his all time favorite but who does not love Bret. This is with out a doubt the best match on the card with a lot of great action and back and forth eliminations. Of course I love Bret being back in there and taking it to NXT, well for a short time. I actually didn't know who was gonna win this one; usually I can guess these matches fairly easy. Of course you all know that Team WWE pulls out the victory thanks to Cena, but there is alto of great action here. 5/5

Over all this is a good event but not one of the classic ones.",1286668800,,3702,4.224893917963225
4165633,4,B003Q7B7GU,"This in my mind, was a good ppv, but the cover had a terrible screen shot of the brawl between team Cena and team Nexus. But thanks for reading and please rate!

Intercontinental Title
Dolph Ziggler vs. Kofi Kingston
This had the potential to be a good match, but everyone knew that this wasn't going to go down a good road. This match was just ruined by Nexus beating the living Day Lights out of Ziggler and Kingston telling Team Cena they are ready for the main event. 2/5

Divas Title
Melina vs. Alica Fox
So far, why do i even bother writing a review for this ppv, this ppv wasn't having a good start to it, which kind of dissapointed me. But, the only good thing about this was seeing Ziggler get beatdown by Nexus, and Melina winning the Divas title for the freaking second time. 1/5

3-on-1 Handicap match
Big Show vs. S.E.S(CM Punk, Joey Mercurey, and Luke Gallows)
Well, this match was another waste of time. This is how they were buring Punk first by making S.E.S disband, and then never winning once against the big slow. i mean, the nexus did a better job of beating the living blubber out of Show on smackdown for god sakes. This match had nothing special at all, except for of course domination from show. 2/5

WWE Title-If Orton Lost he would not get a rematch, if anyone interferred, they would be suspended idefinatly
Sheamus vs. Randy Orton
This, right here, was a great match. It actually turned out better than i thought it would be. This had great, never ending action. But this had a really retarted ending to it. For Sheamus to get DQed and for him to get off easy, but you think he did, very very false. After the match, Orton gave Sheamus one of the biggest RKO's ive seen this year on the announce table. 4.75/5

World Title
Kane vs. Rey Mysterio
This had the potential to be a good match, like their encounters in 08'. But it was short, sweet, and to the point. Especially for Undertaker getting hurt at wrestlemania, and returning at Summerslam 2 years in a row. But, this was almost even the entire match, until Kane won and and then Tombstoned Taker into next week, which made me very made by the way. 3.75/5

7-on-7 Tag Team Elimination match
Team WWE(Cena, Morrison, Truth, Hart, Edge, Jericho, and Bryan) vs. Team Nexus(Barrett, Otunga, Slater, Tarver, Sheffield, Young, and Gabriel)
This of course was the best match on the card. Over 35 minuets of awesome, and the huge return of Daniel Bryan, and the nice brawl before the match even started. One thing i did think was wrong with this match, elminations went really quickly, after one elimination, another elimination came after that about a minuet later. But, of course it came down to the biggest stars, Gabriel, Barrett(Nexus), and Bryan, and Cena(WWE), but of course, Cena Would wint he match for his team, which made me POed because the really needed for Bryan to win for his team because it was his return. 5/5

So, overall, now that i have looked at it, this was a average ppv, with only about 2 or 3 good matches on it. Thanks for reading.",1286496000,,3034,4.505454545454546
4165634,2,B003Q7B7GU,"Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler Vs. Kofi Kingston - If you remember last year's opener between Rey Mysterio and Dolph Ziggler, then it would be safe to say this year's event was going to start off strong but that wasn't the case here. Dolph was accompanied by Vickie Guerrero as he entered this return match for the Intercontinental title againt Kofi. Kofi started out aggressive and strong hitting various moves until Dolph gained the upperhand with numerous counters and reversals. As the match went on, it began to develop into a very good back and forth encounter until the Nexus showed up out of nowhere just to make their presence known and to preach about their 7 on 7 match scheduled to take place later on. The ending was certainly disappointing and the reason behind it, it should have never happened to begin with. 2.5/5

Divas Champion Alicia Fox Vs. Melina - Melina returned to her hometown of L.A. as she entered the match in some unusual entrance attire. We saw Melina using some interesting wrestling moves that we don't normally get from her before it looked like Melina reinjured herself which gave Alicia the opportunity to take control. From there, Alicia worked on the arm before Melina suddenly regained the momentum as it led her regaining the Divas championship. The aftermath involved LayCool (Layla & Michelle McCool) coming out and ruining Melina's emotional celebration. But overall, this match was more of a one-woman show that showcased Melina winning back her Divas title a part from LayCool making their appearence. 2/5

Big Show Vs. Straight Edge Society: CM Punk, Joseph Mercury, & Luke Gallows - This was a 3 on 1 handicap match that was held under tornado rules which allowed all three members of the S.E.S. to be in the ring at once. Though, that didn't make a difference as the Big Show nearly dominated all of the S.E.S. after revealing his hand was healed from the attack CM Punk had on it. Big Show dominated the early portions of the match before missing a huge chop and hitting the ring steps before the S.E.S. was able to work over Big Show for a brief period until Big Show came back and was able to prevail over Punk, Gallows, & Mercury. 2.25/5

WWE Champion Sheamus Vs. Randy Orton - This was a rematch from their title match they had back at the Royal Rumble with the added on stimpulations being if anyone interferes, they would be suspended and the other, if Orton loses, he will never recieve another WWE title shot as long Sheamus is champion. This match started out very physical with Orton being very aggressive to the point he was able to gain the momentum on the outside before the match spilling out into the crowd for a brief amount of time. From there, Orton continued to dish out his methodical and calculating pace onto Sheamus until Sheamus turned the tables and threw Orton into the ring steps that injured his shoulder. After that, the match was able to pick up with both men able to reverse the momentum various times and coming out with numerous counters to their signature moves with the crowd getting more and more into it. As the match was great, the ending was disappointing with Sheamus using his championship advantage to retain his title which caused Orton to go in an intense mode that saw a huge post match brawl before Orton delivering a RKO to Sheamus on the announce table. This match was definitely better then their Royal Rumble match with the aftermath giving more life to the feud. 4/5

World Champion Kane Vs. Rey Mysterio - The big story here was the debate over who was the one who attacked and took out the Undertaker. Kane entered the match bringing a casket to ringside promising he will put Rey in it. With all of that aside, this was a ""David vs. Goliath"" match that resembled their feud back in 2008 which Rey used his speed and agility at his advantage. Rey used that same strategy here with Kane heavily working on Rey's back using various moves such as bearhugs and ramming Rey into the steel ring post to inflect more damage on Mysterio's back. The closing moments of the match includes a very good series of counters until Kane one armed chokeslammed Rey to keep his World title. The aftermath showcased Kane inflecting more punishment onto Rey until the Undertaker made his return and declared the man who was guilty of attacking him. 3.5/5

John Cena, Bret Hart, John Morrison, Edge, R Truth, Chris Jericho, & Daniel Bryan Vs. Nexus [7 on 7 Elimination Match] - Earlier in the night, the Miz came out and announced he accepted the offer to be the 7th member of Team WWE. Though to the surprise of many, John Cena announced the Miz was not the 7th member. The Miz was out picked by his NXT rookie, Daniel Bryan. This was the best match of the night that saw Daniel Bryan showcasing his extraodinary wrestling skills by taking it to Nexus memeber, Darren Young, and making him tap out for the early elimination. From there, eliminations did not come all at once. The powerhouse player of Nexus, Skip Sheffield, has a good showing eliminating two members of Team WWE while Bret Hart made his first SummerSlam appearence in 13 years as he was on fire the short time he was in the match. The problems among Cena, Jericho, and Edge was there that caused the eliminations of Jericho and Edge. Once it came down to the final four, the Miz reappeared and helped Wade Barrett and Justin Gabriel to eliminate Bryan. At that point, Cena was pinned against the wall to over come the odds that featured Barrett and Gabriel taking it to Cena that showed Cena taking a hard DDT on the concrete floor before Cena fought back strong to gain the win for his team. This was definitely the best match on the card and it did wonders for the younger guys like Bryan, Barrett, Gabriel, & Heath Slater to elevate them into superstardom. 5/5

Overall, this year's SummerSlam had a lot of flops to it and if it wasn't for two matches in the line up (Orton/Sheamus and the 7 on 7 match), I would have given this up and maybe I should've. So if you're a big fan of the Orton/Sheamus feud, the Nexus angle, or just want to see the return of the Undertaker, I give this a recommendation. But if not, I do not recommend this event at all.",1284508800,3,6212,4.591891891891892
4165635,2,B003Q7B7GU,"Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Kofi Kingston - What a difference a year makes as last year, Dolph walked into the opening match at SummerSlam as the challenger for the Intercontinental Championship & this year he walks in as the champion along with Vickie Guerrero on his shoulder.  Kofi started out strong & aggressive before Dolph had the upper hand early on in the match that went back & forth between both men...before Nexus came & took out both men before addressing the crowd about their match later on that night.  This wasn't necessary at all & they reduced this match to nothing more than a backdrop to plug their main event match...the same main event match that people had currently payed to see later in the night so this could have just been a backstage interview & killed the match before it had a chance to pick up.

Divas Champion Alicia Fox vs. Melina - Before the match got started, Melina returned to her hometown of Los Angeles with quite an interesting outfit.  Melina showcased some unique offense during this match than we usually don't get from divas action like a sliding ankle takedown & a double knee drop on Fox's stomach...who was drapped on the corner of the middle ropes.  There was a point where Melina looked like she reinjured her knee only for Fox to attempt to work over the arm but to no avail as Melina regained the championship...only for the final image being the same as the previous match, the last people standing where those who weren't involved in the match.  Overall, I saw this as a ""Melina"" showcase more than anything else.

Big Show vs. Straight Edge Society (C.M. Punk, Luke Gallous, Joseph Mercury) - Before I get started, old school wrestling fans will get a chuckle out of the Greg Valentine reference Matt Striker pointed out in regards to Punk's t-shirt.  This was a 3 on 1 handicap match with the twist on the rules being that it was tornado tag rules so all the members of the S.E.S. were allowed in the ring at the same time.  In a nutshell, this was a dominate performance by Big Show as he showed that his injured hand was healed and easily took care of Gallous & Mercury in the beginning before he rehurt his hand missing a chop on Punk & hitting the ringside steps.  S.E.S. was able to work over Show for a small time but Show was able to still recover & dominate his way to a victory with possibly the biggest story being where Punk was with Serena when Gallous & Mercury were at the mercy of Show.

WWE Champion Sheamus vs. Randy Orton - The rematch from the Rumble earlier this year with the stipulations being that anyone who interfered would be suspended while this would be Orton's only title match.  This started out with Orton being very physical & dominate in the early stages before he hurt his shoulder going into the ringside steps (nobody is having luck with those steps this night) which allowed Sheamus to regain control.  This was a match that picked up the pace overtime with momentum alternating between both men including both men being able to either counter their signature moves like Sheamus finding a counter for the RKO.  Unfortunally, Sheamus used his championship advantage to retain his title which errupted into a huge brawl after the match that had Sheamus take an RKO on the announcetable...that didn't break or give at all unlike how they normally do.  This was definately better than their previous Rumble match and did enough to make me want to see another encounter.

World Champion Kane vs. Rey Mysterio - Aside from this being a World Championship match, both men accused each other of being the person who attacked Undertaker months earlier & Kane came out to the ring with the casket that he has been with for several weeks with the promise that he would stuff Rey in that casket.  As you would expect whenever Mysterio goes against someone who his heavily larger than him or for anyone who remembers their series back in 2008, they used the ""David vs. Goliath"" formula where Rey used his speed & smaller height to his advantage which helped him at times be able to counter Kane's moves such as an attempted slam into a tilt-a-wirl DDT but this was mostly a dominate performance by Kane who heavily worked over Rey's back by using the ringpost to ram his back into either on the outside or the ringside of the ring via a baseball slide along with various bearhugs & even a jumping sidewalk slam on his way to victory.  The crowd was really quiet throughout the entire encounter with the only heavy reaction happened after the match where Kane kept punishing Rey so he could get him in the casket before everyone saw it was already occupied & finding out just who was guilty of doing the crime that both men were accusing each other to doing going into this match.

Elimination Match: John Cena, Bret Hart, John Morrison, R-Truth, Edge, Chris Jericho, ? vs. Nexus - The whole mystery throughout the night was who would replace Great Khali as the 7th member of Team WWE with the heavy tease of it being The Miz throughout the week before he finally said that he would join the team earlier in the night...however to everyone's suprise, Miz wasn't picked as the 7th guy because he took too long to give an answer which opened the door to the return of former Nexus member Daniel Bryan.  This was the longest match of the night & had various moments such as Bryan's performance including eliminating the first member of Nexus in under a minute with the crossface, the impressive dominate performance of Nexus' Skip Sheffield that including eliminating out two members, Bret Hart giving the best performance he has done since returning in the time (or lack of) he was in the match, the interaction between Edge & Cena & Jericho, The Miz appearing once again, and when the match got down to the final four competitors.  This was the best match of the night as it did it's job in heavily elevating the younger rookies & giving them the spotlight with some of them (Barrett, Skip, Bryan) making the best out of it.
As a side note for those who don't remember, Bryan had his issues with announcer Michael Cole back during the first season of NXT because Cole constantly buried Bryan & degraded his acomplishments outside of WWE whenever he could in favor of his then-NXT pro The Miz (who Cole has constantly been heavily biased towards in the past few weeks) & that didn't stop here as Michael Cole constantly kept getting on the case of Bryan to the point where the regular ""heel"" announcer in Matt Striker had to tell Cole to stop so if you don't like Michael Cole then I would suggest you watch this match on mute because it went from being ""heelish"" to just plain annoying.

In the end, SummerSlam was a 2 match show for me as Orton & Sheamus delievered a better match than I expected from just remembering their match at the Rumble earlier this year along with the main event elimination tag with the only other highlight being what happened after the Kane/Mysterio match but the other matches on the card were just watchable but not the quality that should be expected with this being one of the biggest PPV's of the year while the one other match that looked like it was about to be a quality encounter (Kofi/Dolph) was nothing more than a backdrop to plug the main event.  As I said before, this was strictly a two match show for me so those two matches online someplace along with the finish to the World Title match & skip this show.",1282348800,2,7448,4.579263711495116
4165636,3,B003Q7B7GU,"Dolf Ziggler vs. Kofi Kingston IC Title
I was enjoing this opener until the Nexus ended. The match started a lil slow but deffinetly picked up. I like what both men can do in the ring and like the dolf push but would have liked a clean finish. The one plus about the finish was it gave a sense of unpredictablity that WWE is lackin lately.
6 out of 10

Alicia Fox vs. Melina
Does anyone care about a WWE womens match anymore. They r terrible in the ring and r just there for eye candy.
Blah

Big Show vs. SES(Punk, Gallows, & Mercury)
This match was somewhat entertaining just didn't like the booking here. It does no good for one of the biggest of WWEs future, CM Punk. On Summerslam he need 2 others tornado style, meaning all 4 in at the same time, to take on big show.
4.5

Shamus vs. Randy Orton WWE Championship
I really enjoyed this evenly match contest with 2 WWE stars. I wasn't sure of Orton as a fan fav but it's only helping his starstudded career. Great back and forth match with a decent amount of near-falls. Again, the issue was the finish. I did like that they seemed 2 give anough time for the match 2, just hate the overdone heel DQ finish on a Pay Per View.
7.5 might have been higher with a better finish

Kane vs. Ray Mysterio World Championship
Confused with this being Smackdowns main event for the title. Kane hasn't done much all year and then all of a sudden hes champion, fighting Ray who also didn't seem like they had big plans with earlier. Hate when they butcher the title like that, anyway, they did however get me into it as kane and ray have had good matches in the past. It was entertaining with a clean finish, wow.
7 with entertainment after the match with the return of the Undertaker like we've never seen him.

7 on 7 elimination match-Nexus(Wade Barret, Skip Sheffield, Justin Gabriel, David Otunga, Heath Slader, Michael Tarver, & Darren Young) vs. Team Cena or is it Team Jericho (John Cena, Chris Jericho, Bret Hart, John Morrison, R Truth, Edge, & Daniel Brian!)
Loved that Cena announced Daniel Brian as the final member. This match was pretty well put together with good action and both teams displaying what they have 2 offer. I enjoyed the way the eliminations were done. Loved the time Brian was able to have, showing off his wwe version in ring style and it deff landed with the wwe audience. Good main event.

4165637,2,B003Q7B7GU,"Had this been a B-level ppv show, such as a Night of Champions or Extreme Rulez, this would have been considered only a slightly below average show.  But when one takes into account the fact that, buyrate wise, SummerSlam is the WWE's 3rd biggest event of the year (and their biggest event of the summer), it is unfair to say that this was a remotely good show.  As far as SummerSlams go it was one of the worst there's ever been.  In my opinion, only the 1989, 1990, and 1996 editions were worse than this one.  There were only two good matches on the show, and one of them had one of the worst and most destructive finishes (business wise)that there has been in pro wrestling in a long time.  In conclusion, do not buy this dvd.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1) Intercontinental Championship Match
Dolph Ziggler (c) w/ Vickie Guerrero vs. Kofi Kingston

This was a weird one, and not particularly good.  They wrestled for about 6 or 7 minutes before starting to go into some near falls, which the crowd got into, but other than that this was as basic as it gets.  Dolph then locked on a sleeper, was about to win, seemingly, and then Nexus came out and destroyed Kofi, thus ending the match in a no contest.  Normally this would have bothered me, but considering this was built as a one match show, it helped get Nexus over that much more and I was fine with that.  Plus nobody paid to see this match anyway.  *1/2

2) Diva' sChampionship Match
Alicia Fox (c) vs. Melina

I have seen worse women's matches, but this was quite atrocious.  Half-way through the match they worked a spot where Melina acted as though she hurt her knee agai, almost like a shoot, but then seconds later she jumped off the top rope and sold no pain whatsoever.  Even funnier than that, was that Alicia saw her ""injure her knee,"" and then proceeded to work over her upper body.  I laughed.  Melina won with a move that nobody thought was her finisher and she got no reaction...I mean zero.  Bad match.  DUD

Afterwords Laycool came out and wound up beating up Melina because she didn't want to take pictures with them.  Yee Haw.

3) 3 on 1 Handicap Match
Big Show vs. S.E.S. (CM Punk, Luke Gallows, & Joey Mercury) w/ Serena

This fued has done nobody any favors, and Big Show won what was basically a squash match.  Really nothing to it and the crowd did not care at all.  Show basically took turns beating on them, and aside from a short period of time when they tried hurting his hand, this was all Big Show.  Not a bad match per say, just a nothing match.  *1/2

After this ordeal the Miz came out and cut a SUPERB promo, essentially saying he was going to join Cena's team.  This was, in all honesty, the best part of the entire show.  If you actually make the mistake of buying this dvd, watch this and nothing else.

4) WWE Championship Match
Sheamus (c) vs. Randy Orton

The first good match on the show.  Not a really good match, but good enough.  Match started out extremely slow, and extremely boring.  It was every Randy Orton/ Sheamus match you've ever seen.  Lots of stomps, etc...However, it built pretty well and the last 5 minutes or so were very heated and enjoyable.  Right when the match was peaking, however, Sheamus brought a chair into the ring, got tangled with the ref, and was disqualified.  What a horrendous finish this was.  This wasn't even a B-show finish, not to mention the finish to a WWE Championship match at SummerSlam.  Just appalling, and the crowd HATED it, especially considering how awful the show had been so far.  After the match, Orton went insane and RKO'd Sheamus on the announce table, but it didn't break.  That had to suck.  Match was pretty good but would have been much better and higher rated had it not been for the offensively terrible finish.  ***

5) World Heavyweight Championship Match
Kane (c) vs. Rey Mysterio

Kane brought a casket with him to the ring, just to make sure everyone on earth knew that Undertaker would come out of it later.  Very average world title match.  Crowd was absolutely dead silent during the whole match, and the announcers even made note of the ""hush"" that fell over the crowd.  I laughed.  Every Kane/Mysterio match you've ever seen.  Kane eventually hit a chokeslam for the win.  **1/4

Kane went to put Mysterio in the casket, when to everyone's (no one's) surprise Undertaker came out.  He teased attacking Rey, but then let Rey go and tried Chokeslamming Kane.  But, you see, Undertaker is not as strong as he once was, due to his stay in a vegetative state, and Kane was able to power out and Tombstone his brother.  Crowd did not like this or know what to make of it, but to be honest this was at least an interesting twist.

6) Team WWE (John Cena, Bret Hart, Edge, Chris Jericho, Daniel Bryan, R-Truth, & John Morrison)
vs.
Team Nexus (Wade Barrett, Skip Sheffield, David Otunga, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, Michael Tarver, & Darren Young)

Daniel Bryan replaced Miz before the match started, as everyone knows.  Very long match, 35 min +.  This was the best match on the show, and it was very good, but at the same time it really was nothing special and probably below the standards of what a usual SummerSlam main event should be.  Most everyone looked good, even Bret Hart for the brief amount of time he was in.  Otunga, however, was freaking horrendous.  Like, he can't even run the ropes.  Just terrible. Slater, Gabriel, and even Sheffield (shockingly) all impressed me.  Unfortunately, the finish was absolutely horrific.  The last thing in the world WWE should have done was beat Nexus clean in their first ppv match, and that's exactly what they did.  It came down to Bryan and Cena against Gabriel and Barrett.  Miz came out and murdered Bryan with his briefcase, and then it was down to 2 on 1.  Gee, I wonder what's gonna happen now.  Cena got beat on for almost 10 minutes, including a DDT on the exposed concrete on the outside.  Then Gabriel missed his 450 splash, got pinned, and Barrett ran in, walked right into an STF, and tapped clean in the middle of the ring in a couple seconds.  Just wretched.  I mean, vomit starting to rise up your throat wretched.  WWE better start getting some heat back for Nexus, because this finish hurt them quite significantly, in my opinion, and was just another example of WWE being terrified to put young talent over established stars.  ***1/2, but with the right finish it could have been more.

What a disgraceful show this was.  Stay as far away as possible.  This was the 23rd SummerSlam and it was easily one of the top 5 worst there's ever been.",1282348800,3,6596,4.508875739644971
4165638,5,B003Q7B7GU,"The Dolph Ziggler-Kofi Kingston-IC title match was pretty good for a opener and could have done better without The Nexus's inference. The Melina-Alicia Fox-Divas title match was not great but pretty good. The 3-on-1 handicap match between The Big Show & The Straight Edge Society(CM Punk,Joseph Mercury & Luke Gallows) was entertaining & hard-hitting. The Randy Orton-Sheamus-WWE title match was a hard-hitting,back-and-forth,smash mouth bout even with the DQ ending. The Kane-Rey Mysterio-World's title match was a high-flying,hit-and-run,solid bout. The Team WWE-The Nexus-7 on 7 tag team elimination match was a high-tech,entertaining,hard-hitting,high-flying,fierce,smash-mouth,ruthless bout. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1281916800,,727,6.207920792079208
4165639,4,B003Q7B7GU,"Kofi vs Dolph Ziggler (IC title): They go at it for awhile until Nexus came out out attacked both men to make sure they could couldn't be a choice for Cena's team.

  Big Show vs Joey Mercury, Luke Gallows and CM Punk: Punk and his team went for Show's injured hand and had the upper hand a few times during the match. But Show predictably won when Punk got knocked out the ring leaving Show with Gallows and Mercury to Chokeslam both men for the win.

  Melina vs Alicia Fox (Diva's Title) I didn't care about this one so I didn't really watch it, but I can tell you that Melina won. Then LaCool came out and attacked her.

  Randy Orton vs Sheamus (WWE World Title): All I remember is that Sheamus got DQ'd when he knocked the ref outside the ring. Orton then attacked Sheamus after the match and RKO'd him on the announce table.

  Rey Mysterio vs Kane (World title): In one of the better matches of the night, Kane won with a choke slam despite many near falls from Rey. Afterwards Kane choke slammed Rey 2 times and Tombstoned him and prepared to put Rey in the casket. Surprise Surprise though, Undertaker was inside. He gets out and says some words to Rey like he's gonna attack him. He turns around and prepares to choke slam Kane but Kane broke loose and choke slammed the Undertaker.

  Team Cena ""I hate saying that"" vs Nexus: The Miz came out as the last member but Cena made him leave and introduced Daniel Bryan as the last member. Darren Young ""the black John Cena"" was the first eliminated by Bryan and the cross-face. Michael Tarver was eliminated next by John Morrison's split moonsault. Skip Sheffield evened things up by eliminating Morrison and R-Truth with his close-line.

  Next, Bret Hart came in the ring and destroyed Heath Slater and prepared to give him the Sharpshooter, but Sheffield got Bret DQ'd when he brought a chair in the ring and Bret hit him with it. Jericho then hit the Codebreaker on Sheffield and tagged in Edge who finished him off with the Spear. David Otunga was eliminated by the Walls of Jericho. Jericho was next to be eliminated by Slater when Jericho punched Cena by accident and then was hit by Slater's move. Edge then got rolled up by Slater after he hit stupid Cena with the Spear by accident. Slater was then eliminated by Bryan with the Crossface ""while annoying Michael Cole still complained about Bryan's worth to the team"". Bryan was close to eliminating Wade Barrett when the Miz came in and hit him with his Money in the Bank Briefcase.

  Cena who did absolutely nothing through the entire match won after Gabriel missed his top rope finisher and he quickly pinned him. Then Cena quickly got Wade Barrett to tap with the STF. Then all the commentators kissed Cena's butt saying ""ty Cena!"" after he won with just 2 moves when his entire team did all the work. I don't say thank you Cena, I say go away Cena!",1281916800,,2870,4.480769230769231

8402129,3,B003Q7B7GU,"I can admit this...i liked this event. It really had me entertained through 3 of the best matches of this ppv. So lets start with the wwe title match. This match had everything you could ask for in a title match between sheamus and orton but wwe drop the ball on this one by making sheamus get dq. I think they did a good job with sheamus as a heel but they kept having him get dq in his title defenses. Overall this match was good but don't expect a conclusive ending to this match. The next match was the world title match between kane and rey mysterio. These put on a better performance than orton and sheamus match. The main reason is bc they had an ending lol. The downside to this match is the ridiculous storyline that developed between these 2 men lol. Anyway moving on to the main event, this was the best match on the card. It was wwe vs nexus which reminded me alot of wwe vs wcw survivor series match. Almost a perfect match to rate this ppv it was a 6.5/10 but not a bad ppv though.",1360713600,3,995,4.134020618556701
