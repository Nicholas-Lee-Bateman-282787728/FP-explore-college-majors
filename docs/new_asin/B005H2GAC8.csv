8472610,1,B005H2GAC8,"I got this for my class who were learning about cells and tissues.  Although it is not for middle or high school, I recommend it for kindergarten, as it would be a good nap time video.  The information is excellent, however, the video simply consists of Dr. Menton talking monotone.  I do give 5 starts to the two students on the video who are listening and don't speak THE ENTIRE TIME.  I was waiting for one of them to yawn, and they didn't (at least on camera).  Kudos to them!",1381449600,7,480,4.288888888888889
