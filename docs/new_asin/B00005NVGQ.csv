I have a an old DVD rip off a bad VHS tape in French that was complete, so I know what is missing and it is all the violent scenes against women.  The consensual sex scenes are complete.  You got to love the Brits, they leave the sex and nudity, but any violence against women is ripped out which really kind of hurts a WIP movie.  Still a much better transfer then the old one I have, but missing some really crucial scenes.

This is from the trivia section of the IMDB:
The film was initially banned in the United Kingdom in 1992 by the British Board of Film Classification before being granted an 18 certificate later in the year after 21 minutes had been removed before submission and a further 3 mins 43 secs cut by the BBFC.

As you can see it is fairly well chopped.  Stupid!

The movie itself viewed in its entirety is a middle of the road WIP and I would probably give it 4 stars if it was complete.

**IMPORTANT**  Amazon has the cast listed for the wrong film, that is a SWV release from the 70s.  The cover is correct and this movie, released in 1992, stars Pilar Orive, Isabel Libossart and it is directed by Leandro Lucchetti.  I hope this helps.",1317254400,3,1217,4.243478260869566
