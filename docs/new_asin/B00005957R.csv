7933408,5,B00005957R,This book gave me the intense desire to visit Italy.  It covered all the provinces and major cities with details including markets and listening to the language being spoken.  A great book for armchair visiting.  Had a desire to pop down to my local Italian restaurant afterward to keep the trip alive!,1383868800,,302,4.769230769230769

7933410,5,B00005957R,"I just watched this DVD with my mom. i looked it up on amazon only to find more by the same company and saw these bad reviews. It's too bad because it was a wonderful depiction on Italy. I've already seen travel movies about Italy, so I do know a thing about the way DVD's are done. One thing I have to point out though is that my mom and I are learning about places and cultures, not going on a trip to Italy. We have watched many movies by different companies and different locations. This flowed beautifully. It covers the biggest tourist attractions and then throws in a few things I've never heard. It was fun to have the variety. Did it cover everything? No, of course not. That is why it's important to view many videos as well as read the books that are out there about a country. The sites were amazing and clear. The man who spoke had a beautiful voice. I've traveled quite a bit myself, so when I watch a video about a country, it is a HUGE plus if the narrator can pronounce the words correctly. Not only that, but this man's english was perfect. It was a joy to watch. If you are ever unsure about which dvd's to watch, the library has them too. When I find the ones that I finally love, then I'll buy them.",1278374400,3,1220,4.173728813559322
7933411,5,B00005957R,"This is a panoramic overview of selected places in Italy seen through eyes of an average tourist, and showing mainly the ambience of the most visited sites in this lovely and friendly country.",1194566400,2,192,4.848484848484849
7933412,1,B00005957R,This DVD was dated and played in a poor quality. There were really no redeeming qualities to this DVD. One would be better off going to your local library to get a video tape.,1116892800,10,175,4.176470588235294
7933413,1,B00005957R,"The clothing and cars on view in much of the footage reveal that these scenes were shot in the 1960s (maybe even earlier). The impression is that this was cobbled together out of old travelogues and stock footage. While some of the information on art, culture, and history is still valid, this is not an up to date look at Italy, and it is not attractive or informative enough to view for either entertainment or education.",1093824000,21,423,4.578947368421052
7933414,1,B00005957R,"What I look for in a travel video is a good overview of an area, with lots of shots of scenes, sights, streets, views, and so forth.  I don't look for detailed coverage of specifics, because these are better handled in print media, and can be explored when one visits.  In short, I want the big picture.
Unfortunately, this video is woefully short of wide shots.  Much of it's precious time is taken up with long studies of fine details, a boat race in Venice, an instrument maker in Naples, and so forth.  Rome, Florence, and Venice get the best coverage, but it falls off fast from there to Capri, a total washout on this disk.
Even the gorgeous Amalfi coast barely comes across, in only a couple of hazy (use a polaroid filter, wait for a clear day!) shots of the cliffs, poorly composed.  Almost no street scenes to help with a sense of what it is like to be there.  There are no shots of hotel settings, restaurant scenic views, steep roads, or street life.
On  Capri, and Amalfi sections, I get the feeling someone shot them in a day, while driving through to somewhere else.  By my criteria, this is definitely  an inferior product, and not worth the price.",1012521600,91,1164,4.452830188679245
