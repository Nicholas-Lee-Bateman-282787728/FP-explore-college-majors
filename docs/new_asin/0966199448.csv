8594150,5,0966199448,"For those who do not know the difference between Port & Starboard, this video is an absolute must. Seemingly over-simplified at times, this video is a perfect introduction to the basics of sailboat safety & function. Part 1 & 2 go hand in hand and seem to cover all the basics, from defining all the parts of a sailboat to the actual art of sailing. Best of all, the ""Keep it Simple"" approach allows anyone, even children, to learn all the necessary information required for safe, simple sailing!",978739200,7,496,4.6477272727272725
