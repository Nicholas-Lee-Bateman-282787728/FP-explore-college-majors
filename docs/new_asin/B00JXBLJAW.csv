6396427,5,B00JXBLJAW,I LOVE THIS ANIME !!! Totally worth your money. I highly recommend it. It's a must buy.,1412380800,,87,4.176470588235294
6396428,5,B00JXBLJAW,"Man, Tomoko is one ADORABLE yet ODDLY anime character I have seen so far... :3

I really want to see season 2 of this show but I'm not sure if they are going to do it. On the other hand, rumors were told that they might put an OVA starting on October 2014, so I'm not quite sure... Anyway, It's a must-buy DVD! :O What surprises me about Watamote is that before this anime had started, I had the same hat as her during her causal days, and also my hair were straightened back then, and plus, I'm a guy and all. I promise you, I HAVE THE SAME HAT JUST LIKE HER! (No Lie) lol xD At least I'll wear this hat to commemorate Tomoko because this anime deserves recognition... c:

*One last thing, I've watched the English dubbed, and I got to say, it's really not that bad, even though I'm a English subbed type of viewer. I guess I like both of their languages* :]

Thank you for reading this post and I hope you make the right decision to buy this anime...

6396429,5,B00JXBLJAW,"Watamote is a very hilarious and unique anime you don't want to miss!
One of the main things I looked forward to weekly was watching Watamote. <3

Kuroko is so hilarious and cute, i love her to death, she's a great character.
This anime was very relateable to me as well, I have social anixety and i'm very awkward in public, so watching Kuroko and her SA and awkwardness made me feel better and not alone (even if she is a anime character!).
They did such a great job with this anime, You might even feel a little awkward watching her unfortunete situations! >_<

Overall, I personally ADORE this anime and as a huge otaku, recommend it to ALL anime lovers (no matter what genre you like) to try at least once! :D",1409097600,7,714,4.360902255639098
6396430,4,B00JXBLJAW,"The series is five stars, especially if your a fan.  My problems are thus, packaging and content (as if that is a surprise).  Be careful when opening the case cause your disc might slide out.  The set comes with three discs, two of which are on double sided holster.  The holster is what slipped out, at least for me, so make sure your not standing when you open the case the first time.  Second, the content, I don't know why Sentai Filmworks doesn't add extra content for their license but it's unfortunate.  All you get are the twelve episodes, some trailers, and the intro and outro without credits.  Wouldn't hurt to have commentary, bloopers, gallery, or something along that line.  Oh, but here's a laugh, the main menu is just episode selection and the images used have copyright written over it.  Don't know why, but it gave me a giggle.  Lets see, paid $35 for the set though some sets with the same amount of content are sold for $60.  So gives you different look on your purchases.  It's a buy in my book.",1462838400,,1017,4.467391304347826

6396437,5,B00JXBLJAW,"I am happy that there is finally a dub of this anime. At first, I didn't know how I felt about Monica Rial voicing Tomoko. After an episode or two, I began to like how she portrayed her. I originally watched ""Watamote"" as it was being released in Japan so hearing someone else as Tomoko took some getting used to. If you hate the dub there is always the Japanese audio to fall back on. I highly recommend for people that weren't so popular back in high school to watch this anime. Being one of the unpopular students myself, I can easily relate to Tomoko, though my problem wasn't so severe that I had problems speaking to people. It is true, Tomoko's situation can be depressing at times, but there is much to laugh at and relate to. (Well, unless you were one of the popular kids back in high school. I'm pretty sure a popular kid wouldn't willingly admit they watch anime, but who knows?)

With how overpriced anime can be sometimes, I don't think thirty-five dollars for twelve episodes is too bad. I'm quite happy I found ""Watamote"" for such a price. If you have the money to spare, give ""Watamote"" a watch!",1428710400,3,1112,4.424390243902439
6396438,5,B00JXBLJAW,"I just simply love this show and all of its quirky characters. Tomoko may take some getting used to as our lead in ""Watamote, No Matter How I Look At It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!"" I would recommend this anime to anyone.",1428019200,3,232,4.177777777777778

8654443,5,B00JXBLJAW,"- Synopsis: Our unlikely protagonist of the story is an extremely introverted individual. While she has no problems winning guys over in dating games, she finds out the hard way that reality is much different. Even with basic greetings to others, she has extreme difficulty in maintaining a normal conversation. More than not, she's awkward to the point of being cringe-worthy due to her behavior. Tune in to see the struggles of this protagonist in this whacky anime.
========================================================================================================

- Comments: A very unique anime that emphasizes a not-so-perfect protagonist. There's plenty of sexual innuendo and other fan-service. Although no nudity is present, this should be kept in mind for viewers that dislike fan-service/crude humor. There's nothing plot-heavy about this, but the antics of the protagonist helps keep the viewer engaged due to her drama and exaggerations. The dialogue is also amusing. This is more extreme, but I can relate to the similar situations, being an introvert myself.

- Analysis: Regarding introverts and extroverts; there's nothing wrong being one or the other. One tends to be a thinker, rather than a talker. The other tends to be a social butterfly. However, the main issue is being severely introverted or extroverted. In this case, our protagonist suffers from the first category. Since she has such a difficult time socializing with others, this is actually a huge disadvantage considering that life heavily-revolves around communicating and socializing with others. Granted she still is young, life is going to be even harsher if she cannot hold a normal conversation with people outside her family.

Moreover, this reminds me of the struggles of people trying to enter the workforce when they have no experience: They need a job to get work experience, but nobody wants to hire them because they have no work experience. This is similar to the protagonist because she recognizes she has an issue and is trying to improve. However, being socially inept and awkward as she is can ostracize her. Thus, making it even more difficult to practice her communication skills. Communication is not as easy as most people think, especially when engaging in conversations with strangers such as conversing with a hiring manager for a job interview. It takes mental preparation and much experience to pull it off naturally. Consider public speaking as an example. Well, at least she's trying her best...I think.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 3 DVDs. An approximate run-time of 5 hours and is rated TV-MA for language and sexual content/sexual innuendo.

- Conclusion: A highly relatable anime to introverts that's full of silliness, dialogue, exaggerated or dramatic scenes, parodies, and other anime/manga references. This is a unique anime that showcases the painful experiences for at least some introverts. Although it is not plot-heavy, the protagonist will keep the viewer engaged with her various antics. Moreover, if the viewer finds this relatable, or is into crude humor in general, this whacky anime may be for you.

8654445,5,B00JXBLJAW,"I found this series funny and enjoyable, and I couldn't help falling for Tomoko, with her struggles to attain popularity in her new high school.  I also liked the dynamic between her and her family.  I know this series is controversial, with its light-hearted treatment of social anxiety--a serious problem in Japan, with extreme cases known as ""hikikomori""--but I thought this show was comparable to American comedies about awkward or cringe-worthy moments of life.  For a more serious (but still optimistic) view of this phenomenon, I recommend WELCOME TO THE N.H.K., which has an older, male protagonist in full hikikomori status, almost unable to leave his apartment.  This show is far more comedic.

I watched the English dub.  It is quite good, with Monica Rial giving a energetic and sympathetic voice to our heroine.",1476144000,,824,5.111940298507463
