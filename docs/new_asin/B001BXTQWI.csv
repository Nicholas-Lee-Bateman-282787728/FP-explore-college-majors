8285200,2,B001BXTQWI,"Robert Forster and Nastassia Kinski are ALMOST enough to compensate for a screenplay apparently written by a high school girl.  Unfortunately, you will hate the (pouty, effeminate and plump) kid ""portrayed"" by Cody Morgan.  I figure he's an invester's nephew or something.

Forster is solid as always, but Nastassia Kinski steals the movie with a BRILLIANT performance as a bi-polar type chick.  It's a shame to waste her in a B-movie.",1460332800,,435,5.084507042253521
