448657,4,6302283620,"I found the reflecting skin to be a film that inches forward as it unfolds before the eye, only to reveal what one does not need to see in one's life...Nothing!  Then slowly it folds back up again, always reflecting back  upon itself the contents it has shown.  The darkest parts of a child's life  are the parts that are empty, the parts that one goes to and is alone, the  parts that reflect an existence that bears no hope.  The prairie, the soul,  the house, the box are just containers of memories that when left to  reflect off of human skin, they fall short in their quest for life.  Maybe  this is the point, children use their imagination for far greater purposes  than adults.  They use it to create lives where otherwise there is none.  This movie, the reflecting skin, is a fragmented ""meta-reality""  that focuses so intently on nothing that it can only achieve its  intentions...life to death, anyway it can.

It certainly makes me think of Andrew Wyeth.  As far as the plot goes, I love  the ambiguity at the end. Does Seth know that the men in the car are  killing people?  The answer is up to you.

448714,5,6302283620,"You ever see one of those movies that stick with you, your whole entire life. That's this movie. I remember first seeing it on a cable channel back in the early 90's when I was a real young kid and it has forever haunted me.

The Reflecting Skin is a 1990 British horror film written and directed by Philip Ridley and its a true masterpiece of a twisted nature of thick story, images and a young boy growing up in the 1950's in Idaho in the middle of nowhere.

The movie itself leaves a lasting impression on the viewer for its moments of grotesque imagery, its idea of an original vampirism type story and sex abuse of children, but most of all the overtones of religious actions. The movie is a narrative. It's a fantasy laced nightmare or dream that is reality through the small young eyes of your main character Seth who is 10 years old.

The beauty of this haunting storybook fairytale type film is young Seth knows all the dangers around him. His brother Cameron played by the very young Viggo Mortensen comes home from war and starts a relationship with a local woman named Dolphin Blue who is stunningly played by the wonderful amazing brilliant actress Lindsay Duncan.

Now Seth realizes that Dolphin Blue is not a normal woman or at least his over acted imagination thinks she is. He thinks he knows the danger that his brother is in and he also experiences the reality that there are local men hunting and seeking young boys, kidnapping young boys for their sexual needs and one by one he witnesses his friends and local children missing. He also has to experience home life which is falling apart before his eyes because his mother is unstable.

Seth becomes infatuated with the idea of the danger around him, the danger of his brother, the danger of the men and he starts to unravel secrets. He starts to witness the place he lives with all its dark nightmares.

448715,1,6302283620,I wish somebody could explain to me what I just watched. I have NO idea what this movie was suppose to be about. The only thing I know is that this movie was WEIRD!!! Every single person in The Reflecting Skin seemed to have mental problems or some issues they were dealing with. If you like WEIRD movies then this is the movie for you. I only watched The Reflecting Skin because it was listed under Horror. I don't know what type this movie should be listed under but it should not be Horror. There was nothing scary or horrifying about it. It was just...... WEIRD!!!,1423785600,,568,4.367924528301887
448716,1,6302283620,"I give the movie itself 5 stars for being the most disturbing and eerily creepy movie I've seen even if it's not the best horror film production that ever took place.  That said, this review is to make sure you understand the product you will receive.  You will get two DVD's upon ordering.  The Reflecting Skin is part of an 8 movie collection on these 2 DVD's.  I haven't actually watched the DVD to see the quality, but I'm not expecting much considering the pack is called ""Midnight Horror"".  I'm a little upset that what I got isn't what the description on this item says at all.  I was expecting only The Reflecting Skin on DVD.  If the quality of the DVD is really bad, I may lower my review.

Anyway, so you know what you're actually getting (or at least what I ended up with), the eight movies are: The Reflecting Skin, Office Killer, Frozen in Fear, Strange Girls, The Pit and The Pendulum, Brothel, Pinprick, and Invisible.

Add: Dropped my rating from 3 to 1 star.  The quality of this DVD version is almost unbearable.  Much of the detail is wiped out and it looks like a pirated version.  At the very least, the image is compressed poorly to make room for the other three movies on the same DVD.  Disappointing.",1415059200,,1225,4.439461883408072

448718,3,6302283620,"This was a movie that was unsettling and creepy throughout.  It also seemed very mean spirited to me. Every character acted in a way that bordered on physical or mental abuse.  The 9 year old kid (main character) was tortures the widow, the kid's mother hits the kid, the kid's older adult brother hits and pushes him around, the sheriff and widow verbally torture the kid etc.  There are also hints at vampirism (the widow),  pedophilia/homosexuality (the kid's father) and radioactive poisoning (the kid's brother who returns from the war).  In addition, there is also a murder mystery possibly involving a bunch of teens driving around town in a fancy car.  A lot of interesting elements that didn't quite come together cohesively, but made the film an interesting watch.  The scene at the end of the movie could very well have been a reflection of someone viewing this movie.",1398384000,,879,4.859060402684563

448720,3,6302283620,"Saw this film at a local art house in 1990, got free tickets, didn't recommend it to anyone. For years my husband and I joked about it as the ""worst film we ever saw, the only one we ever walked out of"". It is creepy, weird and disturbing, with children at risk from abusive sickos or being harmed one at a time. For some, these are good things in a film. We left only a few minutes before the end when the horrible stuff was peaking and we'd had enough.
Now, a fan of David Lynch, I appreciate it more.

I want to know what the other reviewers were smoking, because clearly it's necessary to enjoy this. This is Little Rascals with bad acting. There was nothing creepy, bizarre, or shocking here. Just poor attempts at symbolism overshadowed by bad acting and strangely fast-paced comedic music. FYI - there's no captions available; also, the audio track doesn't line up perfectly, which makes it feel like watching a foreign film with bad voice-overs.

448737,5,6302283620,"Due to one of those wonderful mistakes, this movie made it into a five-dollar compilation of ""horror"" movies on an Echo Bridge two disc set. Echo Bridge is known for the marketing of the movie equivalent of ""shovelware."" They must have seen the word ""vampire"" in the notes and dropped it in. It is not a vampire flick.

Made with Canadian ""art film"" money, the actors all do a splendid job of presenting a nameless rural Hell on Earth with madness, hidden perversions, deep bi-polar depression and the innate meanness that some children seem to revel in. You simply can't follow this film as you would a traditional plot. It is one film that I truly consider macabre in the fullest sense without gore or cheap shocking effects.

This is not a date-night flick. The great acting, especially when dealing with such surreal circumstances, earns it five stars. But if you are looking  Halloween 27 or Nightmare on Elm Street 35, this is not the film for you.",1362355200,2,954,4.666666666666667

It was inexpensive, and there were plenty of warnings to me of just how bad it would be, so I'm not in pain or anguish over this tragedy.  I wish they had put just a tiny bit of effort into making this DVD though.

Watching the first few painful minutes of terrible color and blurry images made me think I should now spend the $40 for the German Blu Ray import just so I can see the movie for real again.  I'll have to borrow or buy a Blu Ray player too.",1355443200,4,599,3.9583333333333335
448762,3,6302283620,"I admit. I missed it. There is clearly some sort of metaphor and symbolism at work. The semi-surreal background kept he thinking about what is really happening. Seth Dove(Jeremy Cooper)is a young boy with a wild imagination growing up on a farm in Idaho. He believes the widow (Lindsay Duncan) next door is a vampire. His name oozes with symbolism, but I missed it. I suppose the symbolism involves the title, ""The Reflecting Skin"" which is mentioned late in the film.

His brother Cameron (Viggo Mortensen) shows up from watching a-bomb tests and falls in love with the woman whose dead husband's name was Adam. More of the metaphor? Adam's first wife was supposed to have been a succubus according to lore. There is diverse religious discussions among the kids involving angels. The black Cadillac??? Was that the grim reaper?

At times I felt I was going to watch another ""Sailor Who Fell From Grace From the Sea"" combined with ""Summer of '42"" combined with ""Pan's Labyrinth"". Sheila Moore, as the mom reminded me of the moms I grew up with before Valium. The movie had been fascinated and interested the whole time. If I had caught the symbolism, I would have perhaps gone 5 stars.

448766,2,6302283620,"Vampires.  Dead fetuses.  Child abuse.  Pedophilia.  Exploding frogs.  Cruel children.  Murder.  These would appear to be key ingredients for your standard horror movie.  Philip Ridley's THE REFLECTING SKIN is anything but a standard film...but it's definitely not a real horror movie, but a coming of age flick where horrible things happen.  Young Jeremy Cooper plays Seth Dove who resides in a fantasy world to escape his abusive mother and irresolute father.  This fantasy world culminates in inevitable tragedy, a result of Seth's own deception and cruelty.
Viggo Mortensen, in an early role, plays Seth's older brother who returns from the service with his own death warrant.  Lindsay Duncan plays the demure, but somewhat loopy Dolphin Blue, who Seth believes to be a vampire who will kill his brother.
REFLECTING SKIN is an ambitious Indie, released in 1990 when Indies weren't viewed as ""serious"" filmmaking.  The movie has some stunning camera work with an eerie orchestral soundtrack.  Cooper has a demanding role and for the most part is convincing.  Mortensen arrives late in the film but demonstrates the talent that would mature in future films.
REFLECTING SKIN is not an enjoyable film, but its execution is effective.  Recommended for those enamored with bizarre films.",1344297600,,1285,5.261083743842365
448767,5,6302283620,"My only complaint about ""The Reflecting Skin"" is the quality of the DVD transfer. I have seen worse, but I would hope someone would make a better transfer of this top-notch film. Do not watch this movie if you have had a bad day. The genre is American Gothic, the characters are grotesque (similar to Flannary O'Connor's characters), the atmosphere is David Lynch-like--think Blue Velvet in which the ending is not optimistic. Children can be cruel, and this film portrays them as such. The adult world can be even more cruel, and childhood can, at times, be hell even in the best of families. The families in ""The Reflecting Skin"" are not the best of families. Combine religious fanaticism, torture, destructive guilt, and (perhaps) vampirism, and the result is a masterful, surreal meditation on childhood gone bad. Children often misinterpret what adults say and do--the adult world is a mystery to them, and can be frightening. If you want to get a sense of why it could be frightening, watch this movie. Despite the poor DVD quality, it will be a worthwhile experience. I promise you that you will not forget it.",1338336000,4,1117,4.822916666666667

It may have actually been better than this DVD, which is, at the very best, 480i (standard def). The titles are so blurry, it may not even be that quality. This is only one of many works of real cinematic art to be egregiously mistreated, of course, but it is another heartbreak for film lovers. It's odd, when you consider the films that get treated well, and those that get trashed. I can see that oddball, independent films like Reflecting Skin, or Addiction, are not going to have many commercial champions to fund decent transfers, but even very commercial films, backed by major studios, sometimes get the oblivion treatment, like Outland (worst DVD ever?), One-Eyed Jacks (multiple, PD garbage copies), or Grasshopper (no DVD at all).

I would not go so far as to apply that characterization to this movie in particular because I found it to be very intriguing in many thoughtful ways; but almost.  However, if you as a viewer are not a David Lynch fan, then you will probably not appreciate this film, which is a product of director Ridley Scott in one of his many Lynchian phases.  On the other hand I would highly recommend it to lovers of such movies as Mulholland Drive and Blue Velvet and fans of the television drama Twin Peaks.  Viggophiles: see the film, because it is almost required viewing - as all of his films are - and he is his typical beautiful self (the nekkid shot of him alone should convince you) but his paradoxical portrayal of a war hero returning to the chaos that is his home is unpredictable, thorough, and nothing short of the brilliance we love him for.",1266710400,2,971,4.407821229050279
448785,5,6302283620,"As a psychologist who has worked with child abuse victims and their families for over 30 years, and as a survivor of horrific child abuse myself, I would say that The Reflecting Skin is the most psychologically accurate depiction of child abuse that I've ever seen. And certainly the most uncompromising in terms of not romanticizing the victim. In The Reflecting Skin--SPOILER ALERT--the central victim is an 8-year-old farm boy, who is traumatized at one time or another by nearly everyone in his life. His mother, Ruth, rejects him and punishes him with water poisoning. His father, Luke, commits suicide in front of him. A depressed young widow, Dolphin Blue, terrorizes him with details of her husband's suicide and remnants of his corpse she has saved in a cigar box. Even his beloved older brother, Cameron, who himself is a victim of both his mother's incestuous advances and the US military's atomic testing program in the Pacific, is sometimes physically and emotionally abusive towards him--at one point showing him the photo of a Hiroshima baby with ""reflecting skin,"" from which the film takes its names. But unlike the usual tearjerker Hollywood movie about child abuse, Seth is no more an ""innocent angel"" than is his brother or his father or his friends who get murdered. At the point we meet Seth running through a Van Gogh-colored field with a huge toad in his hands, he is already turning into the next generation of abuser--happily blowing up that toad with air the same way his mother blows him up with water. And he manages to retaliate against one of the adult abusers in his environment, Dolphin Blue, in the process. But he doesn't mean to kill her. Yet that is where his silence about the gang of serial killers he sees roaming the country roads in a black Caddy finally leads. That is the realization that finally shatters him. But what alternative to silence does he have? The best chance he has of stopping the killers is when Sheriff Ticker tries to force him into spilling his secrets. Yet the sheriff is so verbally abusive to Seth--even to the point of threatening to split Seth's head open to get the truth out of him--that Seth freezes and says nothing. Like most abused kids Seth believes that he's entirely on his own. And to judge from all the negative reviews of this film he has reason to feel that no one will understand him and know how to help him. Because of all the abuse he's already internalized at the point the film begins, he is no more lovable as a victim than the mummified fetus he tries to make his friend.",1255910400,8,2560,4.691111111111111
448786,5,6302283620,"Preamble:  My review - one of the first on Amazon for this film - somehow got bumped out of here without my taking notice of it.  Here is my original review from 1998 (typos removed and slightly edited to notice the number of reviews in the ensuing years).

The Reflecting Skin is clearly not a movie everyone will like. It requires dismissing all notions of what a movie ""should be"" - and going along for a fascinating ride filled with images that will burn themselves into your brain for a long time to come.  Director Philip Ridley has assembled a remarkable cast who grasp their tough assignments and execute them with near zombie-like aloofness.  The tragic characters populating his film are completely believable - but in that surreal, almost unnatural way that Shakespeare or Brecht's characters are also believable.

Like life itself, nothing in this tale is ever fully clear here and Ridley seems to be obsessed with symbolism and yet his symbols remain somehow beautifully ambiguous, capable of more than one - or possibly no meaning whatsoever.  Any resolutions (or lack thereof) punctuating the story will prove to be frustrating and unsatisfying for those requiring challenging moments to be wrapped up as neat little packages explaining everything for them.  Conversely, for anyone who loves to explore the myriad possibilities Ridley has opened up for us, The Reflecting Skin will be a dark, disturbing, sometimes comic and unfailingly beautiful film experience. The cinematography is never less than stunning - the images recalling Wyeth and at several points van Gough, it seems to me each frame of this film is a work of art in itself, and collectively the experience is overwhelming and memorable.

I've been surprised (though shouldn't be) to read how many found this movie to be boring, as everyone I've shown this film to has been riveted by it from start to finish.  Let's examine its characters (minor spoilers here, but not really):

Seth Dove, a troubled and abused [...] growing up on a farm possessing a penchant for ""exploding frogs""  and an overactive, dark imagination.  From that imagination springs his own, disturbing answers to life's troubling questions, uncensored and unfiltered.  A child you want to love, yet fearful of.

Cameron, Seth's older brother, physically and mentally affected by military nuclear testing on the Bikini Islands from where he's just returned, damaged and very changed.

Then there is Mom; demented, abusive and utterly miserable, the sort of woman whose daily existence goes nearly unnoticed, save for her torment and tormenting.

The father; a gentle, sad and tortured soul, destroyed by a long ago indiscretion from which no one seems capable of forgiving him.  This sad sack finds escape only in pulp vampire novels (part of a rich symbolic motif woven through the entire film).

There is Dolphin Blue, the sad widowed neighbor - a lonely displaced British woman brought to the American heartland by her husband.  Seth is convinced she is in reality a murderer, a 200 year old vampire feeding off his beloved brother.

A gorgeous, black 1950's Cadillac Fleetwood which continually roams the countryside.  She is filled with handsome, dangerously mysterious young men who glide in and out of the story like ghosts of the imagination.

There is the sheriff, self-righteous and bizarre.  He is simultaneously hilarious and terrifying, a buffoon and false villain"" a divertissement who, while scarier than any other character in the story ultimately matters little to it.

We have another neighbor, a crazed lunatic whose insanity is comically fueled by alcohol, grief and disturbing dreams of bestiality.

Oh yeah, and then there's the ""angel.""  A character I'll be haunted by whenever I think of this film.

While all of the performances are excellent, the central trio of Lindsay Duncan (Dolphin Blue), Viggo Mortensen (Cameron Dove) and most of all, young Jeremy Cooper (Seth Dove) are positively spellbinding.

The Reflecting Skin is a true masterpiece of filmmaking; a foreigner's haunting interpretation of American gothic both surrealistically visionary yet somehow wonderfully true.

448790,5,6302283620,"There are movies, they say, that provoke just two kind of reactions: one side of the audience thinks it's the best thing ever made, the oposite army thinks it's the worst piece of pretentious crap ever inflicted on the human race. And there are no such things as mediocre comments on this kind of Very Special Films.

But, of course, there is no such phenomenon: every movie has it's mediocre reactions and a whole bunch of viewers who will say after the screening ""Oh, okay. Nice. Pretty good huh?"" But it's fun to think that these kind of Very Special Films can provoke controverion and mass pumped-up hysteria.

We've seen it with movies like ""Brazil"", ""Eraserhead"", ""Begotten"", ""Stranger than paradise"" and ""The Tenant"". Arthouse darlings with a cult following and a lynching mob to go with it. Often over-stylized, so that the form, the off-beat technical approach either sucks you in or completely puts you off.

The content? Often challeging subjects, wrapt in meptaphorical or surreal stories. It's cinema on the edge, and it either let's you walk there with it, or pushes you over.

Okay, so, here is ""The Reflecting Skin"", and I tell you, it is one of those movies you either think is the best you've ever seen or the worst kind of pretentious crap in years.

The story is about a bunch a young kids doing all kinds of naughty things kids tend to do because, well... because they are kids.

Like blowing up a live frog in the face of a woman immediately after the opening credits. Okay, a little teenage horror comedy we have here, but it's the filmstyle of debutant Philip Ridley that sets the tone right away: his training as a professional art painter has taught him all about imagery, (camera) angels, and use of striking colours.

So the infinite fields of rye the three boys, Seh and his two buddies, stand in are harshly yellow, the summer sky is blindingly blue, the entire panorama very painterish pittoresque and within it the victim: the Muze, in this case a mysterious young woman, her hair blond as the sunrays, her clothing black as the grieving night. And when the kids make the frog explode, her mysterious pale face is splashed with blood that is redder then the veriest red you've ever seen when you witness a live frog explode.

All this filled with bombastic orchesral music for hysterical strings and dito women's choir.

And it works. It completely works. That is... for me. Because I am one of those people in the audience that is suckered into this gem from this very opening.

It did and still does it for me because I see the over-done form as made by an adult director who still has the heart of a child. And the child in him likes to play and make people laugh at darkly, almost forbidden things.

So more delicious non-sense (or rather nightmare-sense) ingredients follow: A mother who seems to suffer from daily life and tends to smells gasoline all through the house any moment of the day, a dad who reads pulp novels and carries a hidden secret, there is the mourning young widow who ceeps a small wooden case filled with bodily left-overs from her lover who committed suicide, a drunk rock-throwing priest, and a shining black car with four strange guys dressed in black that rides all throught out the picture on moments you'd least expect it.

Then dead bodies begin to turn up: the kids, one by one they disappear and are found back later in abandoned crooked sheds throughout the infinitely strechtched out acres. More wicked David Lynchian (!) people turn up, do their things, say their lines and vanish.

Then dad commits suicide after getting the blame for the dead kiddies and as a result, Seth's bigger brother Viggo Mortensen comes home.

(Yes, that's Our Viggo, long before the ""Rings""-fame. And he fits right in, completing his catchy silent-character-quatroligy; together with ""The Indian Runner"", ""Prison"" and ""The Passion of Darkly Noon"" .)

The plot meanwhile keeps on twisting and twisting and when all ends in death, guilt and beauty, Seth, the remaining kid, has underwent an instand-catharsis, a blitztrip to adulthood and a cinematic tour-de-force, rolled in to one.

And, o yes, all this in a brilliant, bursting, and flaming sunset no movie goer has ever experienced before. The best or the worst, that's for all of us to fight out.",1149984000,3,4298,4.741286863270777

Phillip Ridley's (The Passion Of Darkly Noon) journey vis-a-vis into Vietnam, vandalism, vampirism, and viviparity in the Lynchesque ""The Reflecting Skin"".  It's hard not to compare Ridley's visuals with Lynch, however, Lynch's visualizations are more ""mainstream"" type of feel than Ridley's, if you can believe that! That is what makes Ridley's films so odd, disquieting and singular and quite remote in their style.
9 year old Seth Dove lives in a surreal 1960s prairie community.  His mother is abusive towards that whole family, his father is most likely a repressed homosexual who reads vampire pulp fiction, and his brother is just returning from Vietnam, Cameron who is obviously dying of radiation sickness but Seth is convinced that it is Dolphin Blue, the crazy English woman, who is sucking the life out of his big brother.
Seth and his friends torment the local English eccentric lady, Dolphin Blue, with exploding frogs in a great first scene.  That is, until his best friends start turning up dead.  Sheriff
Ticker, who knew about Seth's father's long ago penchant for young boys before he was married to Mrs. Dove, suspect the odd but harmless gas station owner.  Mr. Dove ends up burdened over being a suspect in the young boy murders and so commits suicide in front of 9 year old Seth by gas pump.  When bodies still turn up, the police and locals still suspect the father, even though he is dead and buried.  For some reason, nobody connects the long black car filled with sinister teenage boys with the disappearances.
Even Seth, who pumped gas for them and even watched them kidnap the last of his friends,inexplicably blames the eccentric vampire neighbor lady, Dolphin Blue.

If this description makes it sound like a David Lynch film, you're not far off the mark. Ridley's film shares with Lynch's work the artful, compositionally balanced cinematography, the disquieting psychosexual undertones, and, yes, even the wooden characters. The one-dimensional archetypes that populate this film have been criticized by many reviewers, but, as in Lynch's films, the ""flatness"" of the acting/dialogue serves an important purpose: the characters are mere canvases for the depiction of aspects of the work as a whole. The overall mood of the film is paramount, and the various libidinal energy flows underlying it are best served by characters who act as conduits for paticular eruptions of perversity and other compositions of incident which manifest in discreet  situation rather than autonomous personality. The collective madness at the heart of America, the latent violence that came to a head with Hiroshima and Nagasaki, repressed sexualities, and oedipal sadism: this film is NOT easy to swallow. That the seemingly placid expanses of midwestern fields could incubate such twisted madness suggests that ""the world's breadbasket"" has been feeding us something far more sinster than corn and wheat.",1020988800,24,1387,5.511737089201878
448816,1,6302283620,"What could have been running through the mind of Philip Ridley when he conceived of this film?  Throughout the course of the movie, it was fairly obvious that he was attempting to create art that mimics and shows the true darkness of real life.  Unfotunately, he fell far short.  His characters were ill-conceived and blunt.  There was no depth of either emotion or intelligence in any of them.  Characters, and even buildings, would appear and vanish with little introduction or explanation.  The cinematography was indeed beautiful, but lacked any cohesion and couldn't have saved this film in any case.  The film itself was so blatant in its need to feel intellectual, and to be ""artistic,"" that it collapsed under its own arrogance.
In addition to being poorly written, the acting was memorable only for its shallowness.  Instead of bringing the characters alive, the actors instead portrayed 2-dimensional archetypes of rural life in the 1950's.  The only exception was in the character of Cam, played by Viggo Mortensen.  He was able to bring a variety of emotional, physical, and intellectual responses to the stagnant scenes in which he found himself.
To give an idea of just how terrible this movie is, in the closing scene, in which Seth finally showed some emotion, we found ourselves screaming right along with him; not mourning the loss of innocence but the loss, not to mention waste, of the longest 98 minutes of our lives.",1015718400,6,1438,4.954166666666667
448827,3,6302283620,"I saw this just recently. I personally would compare it to Sean Penn's most recent movie ""The Pledge"". Both have a murder mystery/investigation that seems to be the story but if you try to follow that plot it evaporates when the director doesnt want it anymore.
  Frankly every character except the young boy has been crushed by some cruelty of life. Several characters are very well defined (despite being bizarre) including the father, brother and the mysterious neighbor. Others become bad cliches such as the sheriff and deputies, and the mother of the second victim.
  The kid is the center of the story. We are forced into his life as a disconnected third person. We cant believe what he believes but we can see his actions. This style limits just how much sympathy you can feel for the kid because his actions out of context are simply grotesque and without remorse. The neighbor almost opens a door to sympathy but then slams it shut with her self loathing.
Everyone in the movie is destroyed. Even those that seem to find redemption. Its doomed. We have no hope that the killers will be found or that the boy will be able to escape them when they come for him. (it might have been implied that he understands what they were doing) The characters left alive at the end of the movie won't last long, or if they do they will be more miserable than the father while he lived. Freaking depressing fatalistic movie. But, with no sympathetic character why should i care that there isn't any hope? Heck I cant even be allowed to care about the victims (except maybe the last one, the only one the boy cant care about) because the boy has such complicated mechanisms to accept the deaths.",1009324800,,1688,4.598006644518272
448828,5,6302283620,"A unique and deeply moving film by Philip Ridley. The dreamlike atmosphere never becomes disconnected from reality, which adds to the impact.  Humorously oddball scenes suddenly become serious and human, while moments of quiet introspection are often interrupted by a jolt of unexpected hilarity. The moments of beauty and poignance go well beyond anything David Lynch has accomplished -- though Lynch fans  would certainly enjoy this movie.
The excellent musical score sounds like a cross between Ralph Vaughan Williams (or Gerald Finzi) and Philip Glass on an exceptionally good day.  There are several well-integrated references to moody icons: Andrew Wyeth's paintings, the stuffed birds of ""Psycho"" -- and in the breathtaking final sequence, the sliver of a cloud slicing across the moon  (here, the setting sun) as it does at the start of  ""Un Chien Andalou,"" the root of the surrealist film tree.
This is absolutely *not* a movie for everyone.  Those who have  no patience with leisurely, meditative character studies -- or who couldn't care less about brilliant cinematography -- should stay away.  On the other hand, fans of (for example) Ingmar Bergman's dark, intense films of the 1960s will  love this movie.

The fact  that Wood is praised for this seems tragic in light of his sad, sad life.  There's nothing funny about the lonely, alchoholic person that Wood  eventually became. In short he should have concentrated more on his  personhood.
But the fictional child in this character actually goes  through the process of maturation- death to the old self and rebirth into  the new. Something Wood was never able to accomplish in his life.

7823636,2,6302283620,"This review is for the standard DVD version 'The Reflecting Skin' released by Miramax.

I hate reviewing movies like these because most of the time I don't like them and most of the time they are 'cult' movies. If you don't like a cult movie and publicly state that you don't like it, all the cultists who love the movie call you stupid or ignorant.

For the record, I don't like to watch movies or read books that you need to watch or read a second time in order to understand everything. Often when I watch a movie that is not mainstream I like to watch it without knowing anything about it. So I don't read the reviews and I don't read the back of the DVD case.
About half way through I figured out that this was going to be one of those movies that was going to leave you guessing and not ever going to explain most of the stuff that occurs throughout.....Needless to say I was correct.

So after the movie was over and I was left with disappointment I went ahead and did what I always do. I went online to figure out exactly what was going on in the movie. I then realized what was going on and thought a little more highly of the movie. Once I understood it, I got it....but that still didn't leave me with the impression that it was a good movie. I still had quite a few issues with the movie which I will state below in the spoiler section.

Ultimately, you really need to understand one thing about this movie before you watch it if you are going to enjoy it. I will give a big hint but won't give it away.....Even though this movie is closer to a horror picture and not a science fiction movie, if you are a fan of the 50's classic science fiction film 'Invaders from Mars' then you will have some idea where this movie is going. Same idea except 'Invaders' has a more upbeat ending (BTW....there are two versions to that ending.) I am a big fan of that movie and just like I didn't know fully what was going on until I read up afterwards, I like that one far better.

****SPOILERS BELOW****

The thing you need to know about this movie before watching it is that it is a movie that is filmed from the point of view of a little boy. So a lot of things that happen aren't necessarily really happening the way the boy perceives them. Once this is understood, the movie becomes clearer.
Even understanding this I still don't agree with the things that happen. I thought the boys behavior was still very odd. For example, he watches his best friend get abducted and ultimately killed and yet acts as if nothing is wrong.  Yes, little kids will keep secrets...but normally when they are involved with something and are scared. Not when they are merely a witness and have no wrongdoing. Then it is normally the opposite and they can't keep their mouths shut. I suppose it's possible I'm just not getting everything and maybe the kid just imagines seeing his friend being abducted but I don't know for sure.

As a kid, I was scared of just about any creature that I didn't know what it was. I found it odd that the kids would pick up a fetus and play with it. I would have been scared out of my wits if I would have seen that as a kid and would never touch it.

I also thought the kid's father killing himself was a bit far fetched. He didn't do anything wrong and then he goes and burns himself to death? Not only was it a dumb to kill yourself when you are innocent, he chooses an extremely painful way to do it. Also, the kid just stands there and watches as his father drinks gasoline and douses himself.

I thought everyone behaved extremely odd even from a kid's point of view. I guess I just didn't perceive things the way this kid did when I was young.

I'm not going to complain about the acting, direction, editing, etc. I know I didn't pick up on all the symbolism. But then again, why should I have to try that hard?
Ultimately, a movie has to be enjoyable to watch in order for it to be good. To me, this was not enjoyable. It was just strange. It kept me interested for awhile because I wanted to see how it all tied together. But it never really ties together. It turns out there really isn't anything to tie together. It's just a movie shot from a kid's point of view.

7823639,5,6302283620,"Somewhere in Canada in sometime in the 1950s we have some kids living in the back of nowhere. They are the sort of boys who torture small animals and are pretty inventive in how they do nasty stuff  but not as nasty as some of the grown ups. The marvellous Lindsay Duncan plays a widow living in the middle of a golden cornfield with dusty memories and a broken heart.

The kids become convinced that the widow woman is a vampire after his father explains  in fanciful terms  what a vampire is. This sparks a contagion of fear that is only fuelled by further strange goings on. This preludes the arrival home of Cameron from the army. This is a very young Viggo Mortensen and all of a sudden things start to happen.

Now this is one of those films that are designed for real cinephiles, it is beautifully shot, the fantastic decrepitude of the building is juxtaposed with the staggering natural beauty of nature and that against the humble brutality that man does unto his own. I ruddy well loved it  all star performances and breath taking direction. This is one of those films that passed me by and I am so much better that I went back to look for it.",1473379200,,1153,4.389671361502347
7823640,5,6302283620,"This is a film I waited some time to see, and it was worth it.  Philip Ridley Scott never equalled this.  It is rife with magical realist symbolism (the gigantic pen in Seth's arms (a young Jeremy Cooper), symbolizing the story he is writing as he lives it) and the dolls in Dolphin Blue's house (yep, that's her name, played by Lindsey Duncan) symbolize the suicide of her husband and his loss.

Viggo Mortensen's performance in this is near perfect.  He is Seth's older brother who returns from the war a pretty bad mess, and after their father Luke drowns himself in gasoline and sets himself on fire for no particular reason other than police harassment, he and Dolphin Blue, the woman Seth believes to be a vampire, connect on a level of shared trauma.  Despite that, he restores a measure of sanity and stability to the farm on which he lives.

The problems that occur are pretty obvious in a young boy raised in Seth's particular demographic, and indeed, the burden of so many straight men of any age; he sees a jet black car with some ""Rock around the Clock"" type ne-er do wells abducting people, even his friend Flynn, but he doesn't tell anybody. This refusal to admit that there is a very obvious problem is what destroys everyone else's life.  Why doesn't he tell?  Because he's afraid?  That's only part of it.  The Johnny Be Good, switchblade carrying pervs are the cause of all the trouble in the town, but they also symbolize death, something Seth at his young age cannot and will not face.

They end up picking up Dolphin Blue, a woman who disabuses Seth of his stubborn belief that she drains his brother's blood.
She gets in the car with them and he doesn't say thing, partly out of fear and partly out of denial.

The ending is iconic.  The little boy realizes he has wrecked everything, and screams partially at the situation and partly at the fate of all things.  I did not personally find this as strange as so many have claimed, just cluttered with symbolism. A must see.",1468972800,,1995,4.5363128491620115

7823642,5,6302283620,"Review is for Soda Pictures Steelbook Blu-ray Region B Blu-ray release of The Reflecting Skin. Bought this import disc as a sort of blind buy as I like to collect and watch limited edition releases of sometimes ""obscure"" movies. I didn't really know anything about this film other than the fact it had a young Viggo Mortensen and something about ""vampires"". It's really just a great visual film about childhood and the things we may or may not believe based on the way we perceive the world when we are children. Amazing visuals... I forgot this was made in 1990 (?) when I was watching it... looks like it could have been filmed yesterday... and had I not been reminded by seeing Viggo so young, I would have never known. Being a fan of David Lynch... this movie was super appealing in that I almost thought I was watching one of his movies at points. Seeing this now, makes me wish Philip Ridley had made more movies from 1990 until now... 2016, but there are apparently only 2 other movies he has done since this film. Possibly because this movie was so hard to ""categorize"" and market. Anyhow, I was blown away. Loved it. Great special features by Soda Pictures, 2 featurettes on the making of this film and his second film and music, 2 short films from Philip Ridley (sadly only from VHS masters as the original films are ""lost"", but a great addition nevertheless!), including a Director's Commentary track and Isolated Score track all housed in a beautiful Steelbook (I'm not a Steelbook collector, but this one looks amazing) with an autographed art print? My favorite release of 2016 so far. Thank you Soda Pictures!",1459814400,,1624,4.662020905923345
