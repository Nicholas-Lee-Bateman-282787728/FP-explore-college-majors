8215496,5,B000UX6TNE,"This is, like the other Cinema 16 shorts collections, an excellent compilation.  I've not yet used it in my intro screenwriting class, but I look forward to my students' reactions next month when I show them several of the films throughout the semester.  If you're into Cringe Cinema, as I am, then ""Wasp"" will astonish you.  Call it a prequel for ""Fish Tank.""  'Nuff said.  ""Doodlebug"" is Christopher Nolan's first foray into Movieland; it's rather preciously Kafkaesque, but it's 3 minutes long, and students need to see that they can tell a complete story in 3 minutes.  ""Je t'aime John Wayne"" is a very effective parody of New Wave cinema, and its protagonist is appealing.  ""Fierrot le Pou"" is... fun.  And sans dialogue, which makes it a fine example of what beginning filmmakers can do without benefit of sync sound.  ""Before Dawn"" is a gobsmacker about illegal immigration, shot in spare, lean style, yet rich in subtext.  And ""Six Shooter""... after watching this one you can understand how Martin McDonagh made a deal with Focus to write and direct ""in Bruges,"" despite the fact that he had no feature experience.  Both story and plot go places one doesn't expect them to go; when a film is capable of surprising its audience, I can't help but admire the filmmakers' skill.",1407974400,,1282,4.808219178082192
8215497,2,B000UX6TNE,The stories were weak.  Most of them lack direction and focus.  The one or two that had meaning were simple and not thought provoking.  Very disappointing.,1359849600,,155,4.884615384615385
8215498,5,B000UX6TNE,"I first saw this collection at the ResFest in Chicago and immediately fell in love with this series especially,  ""The Man without a head"". I couldn't believe it when I saw an add in a magazine, that I could purchase it on Amazon. My dream had come true!
All the shorts are amazing and the directors are known far and wide. Each has a message that will touch you.",1322438400,,362,4.246376811594203
8215499,4,B000UX6TNE,"Shorts are usually different than full-length movies in several ways, and this is that way. You should find some films here that you can enjoy when you want to watch something different!",1277164800,,186,4.84375
8215500,5,B000UX6TNE,"There is enough variety here that I can almost guarantee that everyone will find something essential to their collection.  Reading the other customer reviews, I see that my preferences are so different that my naming them can only illustrate my point.  I will name them anyway.

From the first disc, Roy Andersson's ""World of Glory"" and Lynne Ramsay's ""Gasman"" are what I would consider the best work on display.  But then, I went into it believing them the best filmmakers represented.  If, for example, you think Christopher Nolan is a visionary, you will probably find that ""Doodlebug"" confirms your opinion.

Disc Two has a greater concentration of interesting work.  ""Copy Shop"" shows how a film can be wholly experimental while still being immensely entertaining.  ""Boy and Bicycle,"" made so long ago that director Tony Scott (TOP GUN, etc.) was young enough to play the part of ""boy"" in his brother's film, is one of film history's brave follies, in that it taps Joyce's ULYSSES as an influence.  Sadly, the mumbling stream-of-consciousness voice-over just gets in the way of its eloquent images, more reminiscent of Joris Ivans than of the Scott Brothers'  advertising or feature work.  Still, well worth seeing as representing a path not taken.

""Before Dawn"" is done in a single, ten-minute take, and is remarkable for it's interior dramatic construction; ""Election Night"" is at once excruciating and hilarious; similarly, ""Six-Shooter"" is a well-constructed drama that mixes hilarity and the macabre in unexpected ways; and finally, ""The Opening Night of Close-Up,"" shot on video, documents the behind-the-scenes agony of watching Kiarostami's masterwork open in a London movie house, defining the expression ""pearls before swine"" to a ""T.""",1243296000,4,1751,5.258992805755396
8215501,5,B000UX6TNE,"For those who want to see filmmakers in the making, this is a great start.  Though all the films do not follow a typical narrative structure, they are all noteworthy and interesting to watch, especially in light of who made them.  There are several Oscar-winners, as well as one of my favorites, J'Taime John Wayne.  A must for filmmakers and story-tellers alike.",1240531200,3,363,4.82258064516129
8215502,4,B000UX6TNE,"In the U.S., at least, people who don't go to film festivals rarely see shorts. ""Cinema16"" certainly works as a high-impact advertisement for the art. Every film is worth seeing. No shrug-inducing student films. All have major festival awards as calling cards. Two won Oscars.

Most of the shorts have commentaries; a few do not. This makes for two experiences -- the viewing, and then the director explaining what was what with the film. Some of these films are abstract or just plain odd, so it's interesting to put your perceptions to the test right away.

Series producer Luke Morris unspooled the ""Cinema16"" DVD series in Europe a few years back, compiling award-winning British shorts and first films from top U.K. directors. His next DVD reached out to European directors. (Neither was region 1). This ""Cinema16"" is tailored for the U.S., and it looks like we got the better deal -- the double-disc set contains the greatest hits from the first two editions and then some. Eleven European nations are represented.

My favorites:

""Je T'aime John Wayne"": Stylized, high-energy profile of a London hipster who fantasizes he's living in Paris as a way-cool Jean-Paul Belmondo clone -- until his mum calls.

""Wasp"": Won the Oscar for short film in 2005. A young single mom of four yearns to party at the pub, but can't afford to feed her kids, let alone get child care. She cleans up real nice and drags the children to the local bar, where they wait outside while she keeps a date with an old flame. The film's magic is in its slightly sympathetic portrait of the lousy mother.

""The Man Without a Head"": Everyone needs a head, but our hero is fresh out. A date with a beautiful woman looms; he decides to splurge on a head. So many to choose from ...

""Six Shooter"": A man's wife of many years dies at 3 a.m. The day is all downhill from there. This black comedy is another Oscar winner.

Ridley Scott contributes the tedious student film ""Boy and Bicycle."" Lars Von Trier has a so-so tale of a woman terrified of the sun. Christopher Nolan lends a b&w tale of man vs. bug.",1191196800,15,2078,4.627717391304348
