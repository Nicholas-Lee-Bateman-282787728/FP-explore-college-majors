6433705,5,B00KM8GV76,"Throughout the 1980's Adam Ant was a cultural icon.  His war painted face was immediately recognizable, as was the catchy beat of his music.  Starting out in the punk scene of the late 1970s with his band Adam And The Ants, his solo debut was unleashed early in the following decade, showing the eccentric artist to be an impressive songwriter, offering new wave inspired hits like Goody Two Shoes.  As many fans will tell you, Ants best work was his edgier and slightly off-kilter tracks like Whip In My Valise.  Little did the music buying public know that behind the scenes one of rocks brightest stars was fighting demons that would cause his exit the stage to deal with mental illness.  The Blueblack Hussar chronicles Ants return to the public eye and his return to the stage via the tour for his 2013 album Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter.

The Adam Ant portrayed in this documentary is far from the one-dimensional pop star that left the music scene too long ago.  Garbed in his cavalryman outfit, Ant takes the stage as a mix between the smart assed dandy of his 1980s days and Napoleon Bonaparte as his current stage character the Blueblack Hussar.  Off stage, he is witty and sensitive, interacting with his band, tattoo artist, and almost everyone who might cross his path with a mix of Captain Jack Sparrow and the sensitive artist who is driven by his passion for his art.  Musically, he has returned to his roots in punk rock, and his songs run from the kind of tongue in cheek material that graced his classic albums to some outright cringe-inducing lyrics.  All the same, they're delivered with swagger and aplomb.

The Blueblack Hussar is an interesting look into the man behind the stage icon.  Like David Bowie, Adam Ant has always presented himself publicly by portraying a character, and director Jack Bond and his crew have given fans the opportunity to peek behind the curtain and a rare view at the man behind the stage and screen icon.  Extras, such as a handful of live performances, including a duet with Boy George, and an interview with Bond give fans an insider look at Adam Ant the human while showing where this is a case where the mask is not far removed from the face beneath.  Adam Ants energy and charisma rarely fade, even off stage, and his return to music as the Blueblack Hussar is cause for celebration.",1446768000,8,2380,4.649164677804296
6433706,4,B00KM8GV76,"1980s music fans will remember Adam Ants string of hits and a series of dandyish videos that dominated the early years of MTV. His New Romantic imagery was the studied creation of an artist, born from a love of history and a formal art school education, and a perfect fit for the New Wave era. His music combined the free spirit of punk rock with the poses of glam and the tribal wallop of twin drummers, and proved itself a surprisingly sturdy platform. Ants music career slowed down in the mid-80s, but his charisma and innate theatricality led to television, film and theater gigs that lasted out the 90s. But in 2002, troubling behavior that first cropped up in college returned with a vengeance, and in 2003, Ant was involuntarily sectioned for in-patient psychiatric care.

Ant discussed his bi-polar diagnosis in the documentary The Madness of Prince Charming, and again in his 2006 autobiography&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stand-Deliver/dp/0330440128/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stand & Deliver</a>, but it wasn't until four years later that he was sufficiently recovered to piece together a full artistic return. Legendary director Jack Bond documents that return in this 2013 cinema verite film, chronicling Ant assembling and rehearsing a new band, touring for the first time in fifteen years, and recording the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adam-Ant-is-The-BlueBlack-Hussar-Marrying-The-Gunner-s-Daughter/dp/B00A6HHK5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adam Ant is The BlueBlack Hussar Marrying The Gunner's Daughter</a>. Along the way, the film reveals its subject as creative, intelligent, funny, hard-working and introspective. Viewers weaned on the MTV videos will come away with a much deeper appreciation of the thought and craft that went into Ants early work, and a feel for his continuing passion as an artist.

Along the road to re-emergence, Ant meets up with actress Charlotte Rampling, whose appearance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Night-Porter/dp/B00NMUCI8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Night Porter</a>&nbsp;was a seminal early influence. He charms Rampling as they work together in the studio, just as he does artist Allen Jones, who has a connection to Ant (or more accurately, the pre-Ant, Stuart Goddard) of which he wasn't even aware. Bonds camera followed Ant for more than a year, capturing the frenetic energy of his return. The film doesnt impose any context on the raw footage - no story setup for Ants return, no title slides identifying the guests; but there is an arc as Ant rehearses the band, publicizes his return, gigs his way up through smaller clubs, and emerges at the films end into the sunshine of Hyde Park and the welcome of an enormous festival audience.

Some fans have complained that the album capping this comeback was raw and underproduced, but the documentary makes evident that Ant is meticulous about everything he produces. If the album is raw, its because it was meant to be. Some of Ants new lyrics are coarse, and his music reaches back to the punk rock of his earliest work, but there isn't even a hint of nostalgia to be heard. In his mid-50s Ant remains as magnetic and captivating as he was in his 20s, perhaps more so with the removal of MTVs intermediation. The artistic drive that kept him upright as the original Ants were spirited away to form Bow Wow Wow continues to sustain him today; and in turn his energy sustains his fans, who turned out in droves for both his UK and US tours.

MVDs 2015 DVD release augments the original documentary with bonus live performances of Whip in My Valise, Young Parisians (a duet with Boy George) and Deutsche Girls, along with a Q&A with the films director, Jack Bond. Longtime fans (who probably saw this film upon its theatrical release) will enjoy having this in their collection, but its the casual MTV fans who will really learn something new.

8659942,1,B00KM8GV76,"Look, I like Adam Ant and I was interested in seeing what goes on behind the scenes. I guess thought this might be a documentary and that I would receive some sort of information about him. Instead this 1 1/2 hours of watching Adam fart around with a bunch of randos.  Sometimes hes with people who might might be important but I don't know because they aren't identified. Maybe they're discussing a project but they never explain what that might be. The only person I recognized was Mark Ronson. Ill be honest I turned it off about 45 minutes in. Im not bored to death easily. Glad to see he looks to be in good health and has a job.",1532390400,,634,4.283333333333333

Nice and long but flies right by!  I bought this at the same time that I'd bought the Iggy & Stooges recent doc.  Adam's was more on target!!  This is a very well-done DVD showing Adam as he is today. Lots of insight to his personality, lifestyle, interviews, gigs, creativity, style and music. The extras are great - including songs I've never heard with special guests.

Downer:
I expected more conversation about his mental illness, which was kinda skimmed over..",1492387200,4,473,4.802469135802469

I liked this a lot because it gave some insight to Adam. I've been a fan for a few years now and seeing him at the beginning of his revival was mesmerizing. I could not stop watching.
