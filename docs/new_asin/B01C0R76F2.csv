8752041,5,B01C0R76F2,"This movie was filmed in my hometown and I have a few friends who were actors in this movie. It was interesting to watch and I enjoyed seeing places in the movie I drive by on a daily basis. The movie had a good plot and dialogue. Only drawback was due to the sound quality in parts of the movie. Other than that it was great! Plus, the director himself, Glenn Martin hand delivered the movie to my front door. That was awesome in itself!",1462060800,,438,4.1647058823529415
