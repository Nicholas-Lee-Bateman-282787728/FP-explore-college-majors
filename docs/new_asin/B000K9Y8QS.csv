I expected it to be focused on how to be healthy and make healthy choices, maybe even explain how our body fights germs and infections.  It instead is a full hour of fat shaming.  I watched the whole thing hoping maybe it would shift focus but after a while it was just like watching a bad car crash...  They explore the body of someone who is fat, the enemies are Cholesterol and Dia Beetees 2.  There are lines about how french fries are evil evil evil.  But the real annoyance is that they don't say much about what you SHOULD be eating or how you SHOULD be exercising.  Just shame shame shame you are a fat slob.  I could see all kinds of eating disorders arising from this one.  Pass this one by.  There are many more shows out there that are not built on shame and guilt.",1417651200,,867,4.162650602409639

8155235,1,B000K9Y8QS,This video was way over sexed! I did't see this as a great video to show to students or my kids do to the graphic and over sexed images!,1190764800,5,136,3.7241379310344827
