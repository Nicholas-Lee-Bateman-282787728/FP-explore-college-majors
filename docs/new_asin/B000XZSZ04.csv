8230336,5,B000XZSZ04,"After falling from a ladder onto a concrete slab, I wasn't moving too well after several weeks. One morning I woke up early and Priscilla Patrick's Yoga Stretch program was on my PBS station. I watched a few minutes and tried some of the stretch routines. Amazingly, the pain subsided and I was able to move much better. I purchased this tape and it was a great help in my recovery. I am selling because I have purchased a whole set of Priscilla's DVD's. This is a great place to start because she is informative and the exercises work very well for the beginner and the person who is in shape.",1382486400,7,594,4.36036036036036
8230337,5,B000XZSZ04,"For those who want to learn Yoga at home, here is the best teacher with phenomenal knowledge, right temperament and attitude. She has analyzed the teachings, articulates efficiently, and demonstrates the asanas extremely well. She addresses the physical and mental blocks and impediments and gives step-by-step directions in simple language. She makes the inflexible/apprehensive learner comfortable. This is a gem of a teacher. A simple person with simple life-style and a deep understanding of Yoga, she is a wholesome person.

This is not the video to buy if you are looking for glamorized Yoga in one of those revealing wardrobes with specific body-based messages. This is not one of those programs that use Yoga as a business to promote cosmetics and funny-looking clothing. This program is for those who want to learn Yoga the way it is meant to be done, from a no non-sense teacher.

I am eternally grateful to Priscilla.",1267056000,29,928,5.098684210526316
