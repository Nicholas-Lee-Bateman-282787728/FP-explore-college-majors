Mike is a great guy, I envy him and his dogs adventures.",1498780800,,126,4.291666666666667

8151439,5,B000JK2LNA,"This DVD was well worth the money. Relaxing, enjoyable, and informative, with lots of great Scenery. I would have liked to see some more airplanes in the air to air footage, but it was still great.",1350604800,,197,4.5
8151440,5,B000JK2LNA,"I've had the pleasure to fly with Mike on two occasions. Once from Renton Wa. to a small lake in the Cascades and once from Renton Wa. to Nimpo Lake B. C. Canada(and surrounding area). For anyone that has had the opportunity to fly in a Beaver (private or maybe commercial-Kenmore Air), you'll appreciate where Mike takes you in this Video. The scenery is breathtaking and he does a great job of letting the viewer enjoy the ride. This video makes a great gift to both those that pilot and those that wish they could.",1286236800,,517,4.4526315789473685
8151441,5,B000JK2LNA,"I bought this video at the EAA Arlington Northeast Fly-in and Airshow. This is a great video, with breathtaking scenery, and very enjoyable to watch over and over. The editing is very excellent, with appropriate sound levels (not the booming & hyper music drowning out voices typical releases today ), and overall pacing is reflects the serene landscapes. It is suitable for all ages, and you don't need to be an aviation enthusiast to enjoy it. I think it would make nice companion to the Planet Earth series, since it offers a different perspective of some remote lands, rarely seen in such detail. I highly recommend it, and hope Mr Lunenschloss produces a sequel.",1279843200,2,667,4.859649122807017
8151442,5,B000JK2LNA,"This DVD is an hour+ of pure relaxation, flying low and slow over Alaska and northern Canada with pilot Mike Lunenschloss and his dog (and narrator----very well spoken!) SciFi.  There is very little narration and that which is there is unobtrusive.  We see Mother Nature in all her glory, scenery that from the jetliner at 35,000' is just a blur, but from 500' is pretty darned magnificent.  There are a few short interviews with northernmost citizens that seem interesting enough that I would like to learn more about them.  My recommendation is pop the DVD in your player, darken the room, and let yourself be enveloped by some of the most beautiful scenery in the world.",1197158400,8,673,4.775862068965517
8151443,5,B000JK2LNA,"I attended the EAA ""AirVenture"" in Oshkosh, Wisconsin this past summer.  While I was there, I saw posters advertising this movie.  I didn't get to see one of the showings, and so didn't know what I was missing.

And then, on one of my walkabouts through the convention grounds, I spotted a blue Beaver aircraft.  Next to it was a person selling DVDs, t-shirts, etc.  Turned out to be Mike Lunenschloss, the guy who made the movie.  We talked for awhile, and I ended up buying not only the DVD, but a t-shirt as well (I couldn't help but support a wonderful guy and an imaginative entrepreneur!).

Watched the movie when I got home and was pleasantly surprised.  Not a super-big production - just a guy, a dog and an airplane flying low and slow over Canada and Alaska.  Just the kind of journey I would love to take.  Stopping in at various locations, talking to interesting people, then taking off for the next place.

Too many times we zoom over our beautiful country at 40,000 feet, munching on some snack and peering out over a un-interesting landscape.  Mike gets right down there, producing some truly spectacular images.

What a fun movie!",1188950400,6,1146,4.6138613861386135
