8248113,4,B0012X6RME,"This DVD is made in the U.K.  It contains 26 songs and not 28 as listed on the back of the cover.  The actual running time is about 50 minutes, not the 90 minutes as advertised.  The first 22 songs go by in 41:41 according to the counter on your DVD player.  You think it will end the show at 41:41, but it just starts again at 00:00 and runs another eight and a half minutes (four songs) for a total running time of 50 minutes.  The picture and sound quality are pretty good.....about what you see on the television reruns of old B&W programs.  The last two songs are in color.  Some of the songs are quite short....not as long as the record, but then they had to fit the song into the time remaining at the end of the program.  There is a discography listing Ricky's records.  Also a strange and eclectic ""Also Available"" bunch of trailers for other music DVDs.  It runs about 30 minutes, so perhaps they are including that in the total running time of the DVD.

I like the way Ricky performs.  He is neat and well groomed, wearing either a suit and tie, or a nice shirt or sweater.  He stands there at the microphone and just sings!  No smiling.  He is serious about his performance.  He does NOT do any of the phony emoting that so many singers like to affect.  You know, tipping the head back while holding the hand microphone to their face and pretending to be in deep, deep emotion, sorrow, or agony while they sing.  (Think Kenny Rogers here.)  I like that he plays his own acoustic guitar on almost every song.  He does a great job in accompanying himself.  It should be pointed out that his lead guitarist is none other than future great James Burton who went on to play for many other top artists, including Elvis Presley.  Burton was already excellent.

I saw Ricky Nelson twice.  In 1980, he and the Stone Canyon Band performed at the big Southern California Exposition at Del Mar fairgrounds.  The grandstand was packed.  Ricky was in top form.  He was slim and trim and rockin'!  The band let it all hang out and they played rockabilly like you've never heard it.  The piano player was on fire.  When Ricky was leaving the stage, the entire audience was on its feet and screaming for more.  Even the little old ladies.  Ricky closed with ""My Bucket's Got a Hole in It"" that has to be one of the very best rock 'n roll performances I ever heard.  And I'm old enough to have seen Elvis in Honolulu in 1957 before he went into the Army (and again a year before his death).  Also saw Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, Jerry Lee Lewis in his prime, and almost all of the great 1950s R & R singers.  But that 1980 performance of Ricky Nelson, who was age 40 at the time, was just about the best I ever saw. I'd hate to have to be the judge.  I saw Ricky again two or three years later at the San Diego Zoo's Wild Animal Park.  He was good then too, but had put on a few pounds and just seemed to have lost a little of his magic touch.

This DVD is well worth the price if you're a Nelson fan.  Highly recommended.",1457222400,,3017,4.235500878734622
8248114,4,B0012X6RME,"When I bought this I expected DVD clips from the Ozzie & Harriet show in black & white with old style sound recording. Therefore I wasn't disappointed. Sometimes the sound quality was surprisingly good stereo(for about half the songs). It is what it is - a time capsule from that era. There's no 32 track taping or 5.1 surround sound. The picture quality was pretty good though.
Sure the boy doesn't smile or ""open his eyes"" much, but the feeling is there between the band members. It was interesting to see the lead guitarist improving as the years went by. An extra with the DVD is a complete listing detailing all of Ricky's singles, which I found good.
The real surprise for me was 3 songs I'd never heard before (and aren't on the Greatest Hits CDs). I have already copied the chords and started to play them. They are: Tryin' To Get To You, One Of These Mornings and I'm Not Afraid. It's interesting (for me) that when I play some of his songs at gigs they get a good reception, even after all these years.
I got it in Australia for $10! so why would I complain. On that basis 4 stars. If you are expecting 2013 sound quality etc - then 3.",1379635200,2,1145,4.330232558139535
8248115,3,B0012X6RME,"Being a huge Ricky Nelson fan, I couldn't wait to get this dvd. I remember hoping that Ricky would sing at the end of the Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet as a kid. When I got this dvd, I couldn't wait to see it. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the audio since there is no balance at all. The very first song came on and Ricky was just moving his lips, there was no sound. I ran the volume up on my tv and when it was almost as high as it would go, I could hear the audio. It had to be there for the next several songs, then without warning, Ricky about blew the speakers on the tv and blasted my eardrums with the song Fools Rush In. I ran the volume down to a comfortable level and the next songs needed more then another would blast, then more almost inaudible tracks. The video is awesome of Ricky and if the audio was just controlled in a consistant manner like it should be this would be a great dvd. Unfortunately you can't enjoy it like you should since you have to run the volume almost all the way up for some songs and then before they end run it back down to avoid a possible blown speaker on your television, not to mention ruptured eardrums. I was so disappointed in the audio and really think they messed up on what could be a fabulous piece of entertainment. Amazon should either warn people about this problem or not sell this dvd. If not for this audio issue, I would have given this 5 stars because it is a great compilation of Ricky's performances, it just needs someone quick on the volume button in order to enjoy it.",1277078400,2,1553,4.162790697674419
