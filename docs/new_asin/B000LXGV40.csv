The worse part of the whole thing is the fact that the company put their WEBSITE ADDRESS at the bottom of the screen, oh, yeah that adds to the nature experience. Talk about stupid. I will not be buying anymore products from this DVD company. I wish amazon allowed returns on open DVD's because this is not what I thought I was getting. DON'T BUY this dvd if you want to escape......unless you want to see a website address on the bottom right hand corner.",1311033600,4,524,4.357142857142857
8164962,5,B000LXGV40,"With vacation funds and time so scarce, and the multitude of places I want to see in my lifetime, autumn time in New England is not even close to the top of my list for destinations.  Despite this fact, it remains a visual experience I wish I could see in person someday.

This dvd makes it possible, and provides a variety of views of the area that make the experience all it can be without the expense of going there.

Living Landscape titles are well produced, having stunning visuals and great music to accompany the scenery.  Future titles are planned, and my one hope is that the producers will add an option to have nature sounds only in addition to the delightful mucial soundtracks.

Keep 'em coming!",1203206400,3,709,4.551181102362205
