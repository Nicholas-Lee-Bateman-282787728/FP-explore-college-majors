1812767,4,B00007JME6,"I think it depends on what you are looking for. In my case my primary goal was to work on streching my muscles and relax since giving birth to twins which took a toll my body and mind.

Since I am totally out of shape and as you can imagine in need of stress relief the am yoga session is very simple and very relaxing. Which worked well for me. I love it. And I always feel amazing afterwards...my back is relaxed where it ached from carrying and rocking babies.

The pm in my case however is too difficult for me to do 25% of the standing poses...my legs are not strong enough which makes me put more strain on my neck by not being able to do the poses correctly.

So basically put if you are out of shape and looking for the benefits of relaxation and warming up unused muscles I think this is a good purchase. You can always skip the difficult parts in the pm session or like me just do a easy version of the pose. If you are in shape and looking for an introductory to the yoga practice or a hard workout the pm session will be beneficial, but overall you may find it too easy for you.

I do think the product would be perfect for out of shape beginners if Rodney Yea did both am pm himself. It is surprising how different the two sessions are.",1090454400,5,1249,4.085714285714285
1812768,5,B00007JME6,"I have used these sessions for the last few months and what a difference they have made in my life. The PM yoga is a bit more strenuous than the AM version, which is strange, but they are both very, very effective. This is good stuff!!",1085961600,,235,4.130434782608695
1812769,5,B00007JME6,"I first picked these up on VHS a few years ago, for stress relief. The AM Yoga portion is a relatively easy routine for a quick dose of energy to get your day going, but it was really the PM Yoga that did the trick for me. Some of the poses in the latter are initially challenging, but after a week or two became second nature. I can't praise these sessions enough. Now that my VHS player is long since toast, I'm ecstatic both are on one DVD unit.",1082592000,2,448,4.044943820224719
1812770,4,B00007JME6,"This was a fantastic dvd for me when I was just starting out with Yoga, and it worked for me for a long time.  It is kind of along the lines of the Yoga for Dummies video, except more tastefully done, and better looking boxcover, so you don't feel like such a dummie for using it.  When you are ready to step up to a more strenuous workout, I would advise trying the Pilates dvd series, whihc you can also get here on ama zon.  They take you to places that this dvd could never get you to, just like the ""New Sex Now"" dvd will take you to places far beyond regular sex and the regular sex instruction dvds will ever go.",1078876800,,619,4.016260162601626
1812771,5,B00007JME6,"I purchased this DVD shortly after beginning a regular Yoga class,  so that I would be able to practice at home in my spare time. At first, I found this DVD to be a little too easy, in contrast with the class, but over time have grown to love it. I usually skip the relaxation part (at the beginning) and go right into the A.M. Yoga with Rodney Yee. Not only is the music soothing to the ear, but Rodney's voice is very calming and his nearly-naked body is in perfect shape. The A.M. portion features several stretches that really ""wake up"" the body and prepare it for the day ahead. His focus on the lower body (especially the part where he uses the strap) really works wonders. The P.M. section, with Patricia Walden is a little more difficult, but just as effective.
  The beauty of this DVD is, that the workouts are short, and therefore much easier to fit in to a busy schedule than some of the other 70 minute Yoga DVDs out there. If you have never done Yoga before, I believe that this would be the perfect place to start. Warning: It can be addictive. I now almost suffer from withdrawl if I go too long without doing some kind of Yoga on a regular basis.
  This DVD is considered a beginner's workout, which means the poses are not too complicated and are held for very short periods of time. Once you have mastered a DVD like this, try Rodney Yee's intermediate DVDs. Then you will explore  much more difficult poses, held for longer periods of time, which can be very challenging. With both intermediate & beginner's Yoga, it is very rewarding to find that poses that seem initially impossible become easy with continued practice (and patience).
  I have since purchased several other Yoga DVDs and Videos, and must admit that the A.M. Yoga workout is still the one I do the most. If your life is full of stress, pop in A.M. and P.M. Yoga for Beginners and melt the tension away. Namaste.",1077753600,897,1899,4.436781609195402
1812772,5,B00007JME6,"AM Yoga - with instructor Rodney Yee, filmed on a Maui beach as sunrise, AM Yoga gently awakens your mind and body to start your day off right.  The workout begins with a 4 minute conscious relaxation series the focuses on your breathing and almost always puts me back to sleep, but you can skip this section if you want.  The 14 minute yoga series if very good, a series of gentle stretches and exercises to get your blood flowing and to start feeling like you are a live person instead of a zombie.  The 2 minute seated guided meditation set at the end is a great time to focus and relax before getting into your daily routine.  A very soothing and gentle way to slide into your hectic workday.
PM Yoga - with instructor Patricia Walden, filmed on the sands of Death Valley.  PM Yoga is a wonderful way to wind down at the end of a stressful or hectic day.  You begin with a series of centering poses, which help you become aware of your body and your breathing.  These stretches help you find out where the tension is in your body and work on your balance.  Then you move into a series of standing poses, where you can target that tension and release it and focus on your breath and what your body is telling you.  At the end, you lie down for some final restorative poses that always make me drift off to sleep.  Patricia has a very soothing voice and does an excellent job at telling you what stretches should feel like and how to breathe and where to release the tension.  A wonderful way to end your day and ensure a good night's rest.
I am a total beginner when it comes to Yoga and I have very tight hamstrings so I struggle with a lot of the poses, but I really like this set because the instructors are very clear and precise in their instructions and they are easy to follow.  They don't give you modifications for the stretches, though, and both of them are very flexible so I have to use a yoga block (a must!) or a sturdy book or something to hold onto so I don't lose my balance because I cannot touch the ground.  Still, both sections are very soothing and really do help me to keep my stress level down during the day.  I have found my quality of sleep is much higher and I am not as stressed at work when I take 20 minutes in the morning and evening to take a little time for myself.  All of the DVDs/videos are excellent and have beautiful cinematography - a great beginner's set!",1075766400,19,2400,4.243956043956044

After a shower I can dry my toes without having to sit down. I like the am segment more than the pm. You will need a belt or stretching band and a small blanket to sit on. My back pain is no more.

It's relaxing and challenging. You get plenty of direction on how to do the poses and plenty of time to stay in the poses. They don't give you many modifications for those who are not as able, so I'd recommend these for fit, healthy beginners or anyone whose yoga ability is above that.

I was a complete beginner when I started using this DVD and I also found the PM poses challenging at the beginning. But I stuck with it. I never pushed myself beyond my body's limit, but rather, I worked patiently through each pose, gaining a bit more flexibility with each day. And after a few months you will reach a moment where your mind and muscles will relax and your body will accomplish what you never thought possible at the beginning. I still can't touch my nose to my shin, but I don't let that bother me. I feel so refreshed after the PM yoga like I've never felt after any other yoga set.

Yoga, however, is one that I've used time and time again.  I've bought it for friends and recommend it highly.  The programs are short - about 20 minutes - I think that's the secret ingredient.  Make your workouts ""do-able"" in part by not making them too long.  Anyway, there is minimal talking in these videos, just beautiful scenery, simple instructions and easy-to-follow moves.  I dare anyone not to feel better after doing these routines.  Enjoy!",1424995200,,595,4.6
1813108,4,B00007JME6,This was recommended to me by a co-worked and fellow yogi.  I recently tried the P.M. portion at the end of a busy work day.  It is a short exercise and quite relaxing.  I love the background.,1424736000,,192,4.135135135135135

The yoga movements he takes you through are good, just not very many.  I guess I was hoping for more stretching for first thing in the morning so I was disappointed.  Would not recommend if you want more of a morning stretch.",1424390400,,398,4.2105263157894735

I do it 5 days a week first thing our of bed.  It took a while for me to manage each of the poses, but I was patient and after I worked through them, it's ended up being a great way for me to start the day.

It begins and ends with a short meditation, with an approximately 13 minute routine in between.  In a voice-over, Rodney Yee describes the moves as he makes them, and both the verbal and physical commands are easy to follow.  Doing this routine helps me a lot with my back pain.  When it's over I feel energy coursing through my body, a wonderful feeling and great way to start the day, while at the same time I also feel relaxed.

Rodnee Yee has the most relaxing voice, and the stretches in this video are very gentle yet work wonders at loosening me up, and making me feel healthier and clearer headed (physically and mentally)!! I always feel so good after doing AM yoga, I definitely recommend it any time of day!!

(as I sent this copy to a friend, I haven't had much chance to review the PM yoga, but I know there's a female instructor instead of Rodney Yee; Not sure if her style is as good as his, but I am debating ordering this for myself to replace my VHS copy.

1813388,4,B00007JME6,"As someone who has practiced yoga most of my adult life.. I have gone through health ups and downs due to some structural minor deformities in my legs/feet, and neuro sensitives.

I personally love AM/PM yoga.  Yoga is about the mind body connection. I so prefer this to rigorous ""yoga burn"" routines which is so Westernized!.  The Am routine is a perfect start to anyone's morning and should be accessible to anyone from those who are at intermediate-advanced level yoga to the beginner. The routine is peaceful but opens up the body.  I find that no matter where my health level is.. this is a routine that works for anyone.  I always feel better after AM practice, and open and grounded, where some other videos might push too much, or movie to quickly.  Rodney's pace is great for creating mind/body awareness.

Patricia Walden does a great job as well with the evening practice. Though slightly more vigorous than the Am practice.. it offers a gentle challenge for practicing yogis to deepen their practice without over pushing.  Thus the two routines together balance each other pretty well.

I would recommend this dvd to anyone.

1813422,5,B00007JME6,Very good DVD for people getting started in yoga as well as those already strong and flexible. The AM routine covers head to toe stretching and could be used for any time of day to get your body ready for the more challenging PM routine or for someone who just needs a gentle stretching plan. Both are beautifully done with easy to follow guidance through each move. The PM routine is something to work towards once you gain the strength and flexibility to master it. You don't need any equipment and even if you have never taken a yoga lesson you can benefit from this DVD. I have arthritis so I can't do the moves completely but should be able to increase my flexibility just by doing the AM routine a few times a week.,1385164800,,721,4.348148148148148

I don't believe in 'woooo' but I always finish feeling less anxious and more peaceful. This DVD works for all levels but advanced.

1813460,5,B00007JME6,Rodney Yee is a great teacher and this DVD is really good for beginners. I highly recommend it. The visuals are great and it is very relaxing and it doesn't take too long!

1813462,4,B00007JME6,"I have bought at least ten of these to give as gifts.  The practice is very easy and perfect for beginners and busy people.  There is no excuse when it only takes 15 minutes and simply reguires a belt for the AM portion.  The PM part is a little harder and longer, but not much.  I have done these personally for years, all over the world many times on boats.",1382486400,,359,4.085714285714285

I highly recommend the Rodney Yee portion and believe my consistent use has added to the quality of my life. The yoga presented here is not one of fancy poses held for an amt of time, but more fluid movement and stretching to attend to total body movement.",1376006400,,409,4.324675324675325

so you are not sure and not relaxed  ,perhaps a result of second hand buying.

The film is helping you as a guide to do your exersises with yoga to relax every morning and evening before to sleep .

In twenty mintues, I get to strech and practice poses that increase my energy levels and flexibility.  The twenty-minute time frame is enough time to be very effective and without taking up too much of my day.

I quickly began to see more flexibility and the p.m. became more do-able. The a.m. was such a nice way to warm up my body and start my day. Now I find myself going into the day peaceful and relaxed, ready to take on the tasks in front of me...I truly do take a calmer attitude with me throughout the day, and my body feels more limber and open.

I contactad Giam, the seller and was advised that the closest cd would be the ""am and pm"" cd, which I ordered via Amazon.  Unfortunately both copies sent to me by Amazon were unsatisfactory.  The CD skipped. was not clear and the sound was muffled.  It sounded like copies had been made without verifying quality.  Amazon did their best, sending me a second copy and when that quality was also poor deducted the amount from my account.  Thank you.  My only suggestion would be for Amazon to let the company know of the inferior product.  I'm back to using my VHS copy and am a long time fan of Rodney Yee and would have preferred a high quality cd rather than a refund.  Feel free to share my comments with the involved company.

1813563,5,B00007JME6,"I viewed a few of the workouts and was disappointed.  I thought it would be more of a workout, but it's basically watching a guy and lady doing a few moves.

1813656,4,B00007JME6,"The video delivers what it promises, although you do need to be familiar with yoga positions and their names before you start.  The A.M. segment led by Rodney Yee is easier to follow in that he announces the changes in positions before moving into them; Patricia Walden's P.M. segment is not quite as well narrated.  Nice pair of routines for rejuvenation.",1344556800,,356,4.819672131147541

Rodney Yee does a fantastic job of calmly giving directions and doing the exercises with you.  It certainly gets my day off to a good start every time.  My energy level is noticeably better and I'm much more alert after doing AM yoga.  I am still pretty much a beginner and previously found the PM yoga a little harder for me to do, but am sure I will work up to it.  However, My friends have tried the PM yoga and love it, which is why I gave the DVD 5 stars.  I have no complaints about it at all and would recommend this DVD to beginners and those ready to move to the next level.",1344211200,,690,3.920863309352518
1813658,1,B00007JME6,"I have had several Rodney Yee yoga videos in the past that were great so this purchase was easy.  The product delivered is of a very poor production quality.  It actually looks like a recording of a recording.  Not expected from a DVD.  Getting beyond the production, the exercise content is very minimal.  The instruction is for ABSOLUTE beginners (people that have never attempted yoga) which is frustrating because the DVD cannot be returned now that it is open.  Wish I had paid closer attention to the reviews and description before this purchase.",1339459200,,552,4.881720430107527
1813659,3,B00007JME6,"I've had minimal yoga experience in the past, and being overweight, I thought this would be a good way for me to start a more serious yoga routine. The AM workout is just right for me. It isn't too stressful, just some basic stretches and positions that are pretty doable for a beginner. It is over quickly and I feel invigorated to start the day.

However, the PM session is a disappointment. First, I bought this because I've done other workouts with Rodney Yee, and liked his style. I was disappointed to learn that he does not do the PM routine. It is his wife (I think). She assumes that a beginner can achieve some extreme stretches, like sitting on the floor with legs straight forward, then bending at the waist and touching the head to the shins. Many of her poses assume this higher level of flexibility, without much mention of modified positions. I find myself frustrated at the end of the routine, and don't leave with the same satisfied feeling as I do in the morning.

Lately, I have taken to only doing the morning workout, and doing something else in the afternoon.",1335744000,2,1082,4.543589743589743
1813660,3,B00007JME6,"It's OK. I actually think that Rodney Yee's ""Power Yoga, Flexibility"" does a better job of waking my body up and also relaxing it for sleep. The woman on this video is very quiet so you have to turn the volume way up to hear her and casually shortens the name of poses (i.e. ""dog""). I am not sure why but it irritates me and I don't feel relaxed or energized after this dvd.",1334102400,2,374,4.0675675675675675
1813661,5,B00007JME6,"I enjoy this workout. Sometimes I switch up and do the p.m. in the a.m. which ever works. It is short 20-25 minutes each, but very refreshing. You feel renewed and energized and with a busy schedule, you can fit in yoga.",1332201600,,220,4.261904761904762
1813662,5,B00007JME6,It is a very nice dvd for introduction to yoga. It allows you to deepen into the workout but I want something more challenging..,1331856000,,128,4.375
1813663,2,B00007JME6,"As much as I like and respect Rodney Yee, I found this video too basic for me. Each stretch is not held long enough to allow the muscle to relax. I felt rushed through the entire AM session. For me I have to pause each pose to achieve relaxation and then continue. In doing that it disrupts my zen space. In short, if you have NEVER done yoga before, go for it. This video is short 20 minutes sessions, and will give you a flavor of what yoga is. On the other-hand, if you are a yoga enthusiast, try one of Rodney Yee's other videos.",1330732800,2,533,4.085714285714285
1813703,4,B00007JME6,I bought this for my 18 yr old son who had done this DVD previously.  He loves it! He does both the AM and PM 4 or 5 times/week. His flexibility has improved from doing it. I have never done the DVD myself however it seems like a basic beginners yoga DVD to me.  I have watched it and it is relaxing to watch! I like that they are relatively short workouts at approx 20 min each and that it has both an AM and PM workout...it's like getting two workouts for the price of one.,1330300800,2,475,3.9375
1813704,2,B00007JME6,"I bought this DVD because I wanted a couple short workouts to fit into my weekdays, but the advertisements that you HAVE to watch have done nothing but irritate me. They suck up time I don't have, defeating the purpose of the DVD. The workouts themselves are fine, although I expected a bit more guidance since it also says it's for beginners. I think their teaching style just isn't right for me, I like to be reminded to keep my back straight, to release/hold my breath as I perform a certain pose, etc. These two like to use their pose terms, which doesn't mean anything if I have no idea what that means. Also, there are only French subtitles - no English.",1329350400,,660,4.418032786885246

VERY relaxing and enjoyable, a good stretch, and helpful for waking up the body in the am and winding down/deompressing in the pm.

1813707,3,B00007JME6,"Bought this DVD for my retirement age parents with the hope it would ease them into yoga.  It is definitely an easy DVD for beginners, however I was disappointed with the am routine.  It is mostly performed on the floor, with little flow.  It is more like a morning meditation.  If you had it set to play just as you were waking up it might be nice to help you literally wake up out of sleep.  But if wake up, get your yoga clothes on, take out a mat (and whatever else you might do to get ready for a morning yoga session) the routine feels more like it is putting you back to sleep instead of energizing you for the day.",1325462400,,622,4.065573770491803
1813708,5,B00007JME6,"I will only review the AM section because so far I have not felt up to the PM section yet. It has some standing postures, triangle, standing warrior that are rough on me at the moment, since I am weak and have some aches/pain (fibromyalgia.) But from memory I would say the instructor for PM also does a good job of cuing, and all the visual and aural aspects of the AM segment apply to PM as well.

Gaiam DVDs are all of very high quality in terms of production value, instruction and aesthetics.

AM yoga is my go-to yoga DVD.
You can do this daily because it's short (I do the Relaxation + yoga in ~17 min), it's relaxing, and it's not difficult in terms of following the poses or getting into them.

Music: calming, neutral --won't get on your nerves, even upon repeated listening.
Instructor's voice: soft, modulated tone for relaxation
Setting: shoreline with waves--visually appealing

Instruction: Clear and concise, mostly simple with no lengthy instruction or tips, and no modifications, But the poses are rather easy, so you can watch and follow along. There are not really any postures that you cannot imitate, though you might wish to ask things like--should I bend my leg in leg stretch to get it all the way up if I'm less flexible, or keep it straight and lower to the ground.  And I want to ask those questions too, but it's a DVD right?

Is it a good DVD for beginners, for inflexible people?

I think so, because the poses are mostly from a seated or reclining position, and not especially advanced. That's not to say the poses are not effective, or that you can't build on your practice, it's just you don't need to be particularly strong, or limber or adept at yoga to do them to good effect.

It's a gentle practice, not a total introduction to yoga, or a power yoga DVD.
It's trying to calm you down, and loosen you up, and introduce you to some meditation,  not tax your agility and strength. The poses are relatively easy to follow, watch once, try to follow, and you will shortly be doing the DVD by voice cue.

If you approach it gently, and modify based on how far your body wants to go--don't strain, you should feel increased flexibility and less tightness in your body.

Don't expect to get your legs straight up in the air in leg stretch pose if you are not extremely flexible. It needn't be your goal to do that either.  Just because you don't execute a pose to perfection doesn't mean yoga is too difficult for you. This is the one yoga DVD you can do, unless you have serious disability.

 I'm horribly stiff and my legs remain somewhat bent and rather low, in the raised leg stretch poses and bent somewhat in the outstretched seated leg poses, and I still derive a lot of benefit. Because it's not about being able to do what a former ballet dancer and professional yogi like Rodney can do.

My tips: Take it easy on cobra pose; do what my Pilates instructor suggested and bolt your pubic bone to the floor before executing cobra, and don't lift up so high your first few times--wait till your body says you can do it.  Watch for your back and neck if you have issues, use a neck pillow when lying down, and you can sit on the edge of a pillow for all the seated postures, even though Rodney only has you sit on a blanket for one. I have a foam wedge I like for seated postures, because I have very tight hamstring muscles and even sitting with my legs straight in front of me is somewhat uncomfortable, not to mention I don't sit up straight--so you can modify things to make it easier to do the practice and it's not like you are not doing it; you are.

See how the poses feel and don't over do it.

It's always great to have some personal instruction prior to attempting a new type of exercise, but I don't think there are any poses here that will hurt you if you don't know what you are doing prior to using this DVD.

From an instructional perspective I think it's good; I had no problem with it, and I'd never been to a yoga class before and I've rejected many yoga DVDs in the past as too difficult. But I have had some pilates and other exercise forms, so maybe I have more awareness about how to maintain my posture, protect my lower back and neck and so forth. I had my 80 year old mother do it with me and she's more limber than I am, but has done less exercise videos and hasn't had Pilates, and she has no problems with AM yoga. In fact, this  is the only yoga DVD she will complete.

I'm relatively new to yoga, meaning I've had DVDs for a few years now, tried some of them, done some of them more than 5 times but the AM yoga segment on this DVD  is the only practice I feel that I have no problem doing,  have had no problem with from day one, and that I do several times a week. I won't stop doing this one no matter how ""advanced"" my yoga practice gets, since this one has a distinct role to play in any practice.

Cons: I can't think of any, don't let my long-windedness or personal modifications make you think this is a DVD you should skip because there's too much detail in my review, the DVD is very succinct and rather beautiful.

Hope this helps,
Best,
Karen",1324512000,,5120,4.308333333333334

Her instructions were unhelpful and even though the poses were quite basic, I found myself getting turned around, and even felt physically uncomfortable at times, simply because the directions were unclear.

Simply put, this is just not good.  I'll try Rodney Yee's other work, but the next time I see Patricia Walden's name associated with a project, I will be certain to give it a miss.

Some folks recommended (and I agree) that doing the PM yoga in the morning and AM yoga in the evening can be more effective... I've done that and liked it as well, though it really depends.

I find the AM session very simple, so in that respect it is good for a beginner, but I feel that Rodney speeds through the poses extremely quickly.  I use the pause button to allow time to hold the pose before moving on, but I feel this really interferes with the session.

1813887,4,B00007JME6,"i like this dvd-
the morning yoga routine feels like it's only about 15 minutes at the most.  this works well for me, as i am not much of a ""morning person"", but i feel like it is a short enough routine to fit into the start of my day- the stretches are nice, calm and relatively gentle.  it is a nice way to get centered in the morning.
the p.m. routine is a bit longer and the poses take a bit more effort.
i am able to do up to intermediate levels of yoga, but this is quite 'beginner' and i like it.

one thing i'd like to make note of for people is a word about props: the morning routine calls for a strap, to hook around the foot then the leg is extended up into the air.  (i used the strap from my bath robe :)
and then the evening routine suggests that IF YOU ARE RATHER STIFF or not really flexible in some areas, you may want to have a couple blocks as well as a good-sized folded up blanket handy.
of course, these things are not necessary, as you can modify the pose a bit- your body will always tell you what is appropriate for you!

the scenery and the music is very pleasant.  overall, it's a couple of good 'lil beginner routines.",1261008000,2,1147,4.008771929824562

The conscious relaxation he teaches has become a part of my life...a true blessing in the dentist chair and sitting in a traffic jam. The stretching helps to keep me limber, add that to the relaxing and my day starts in a peaceful frame of mind stretched and ready to get down and play on the floor with my little boy for whom I nanny. Rodney's voice totally helps set the mood. For those that complained they couldn't keep up I was totally puzzled. You should do as suggested...watch the tape before trying to do it.

They lead you through two routines, one AM (Rodney) and one PM (Patricia) with very good instruction.  Both of the routines have a nice breathing portion which I find very relaxing.  Both practices are short enough to fit into your schedule but you feel good after doing them.

Once you understand what this is not, you can begin to appreciate what it is. This is a relaxing way to gently wake up in the morning and to leave stress behind after a day at the office.

AM Yoga with Rodney Yee is an excellent way to gently work out the kinks in your body from a long night of sleep. It leaves you relaxed and ready for your day. From start to finish it runs about 20 minutes including the meditation at the end. I consider the AM portion to be a very basic introduction to yoga. It is a great starting place.

Having a PM routine is a good way to relax and de-stress at the end of a long day. It is a more advanced routine than the AM section. Either they intentionally did this to invigorate you after a stressful day or it was bad planning. When you take into consideration the goals of this DVD, I think it is the former.

The only drawback to this DVD is the long intro and advertisements that you cannot skip. It takes 5 minutes to get through them. But if you start the DVD and then go make coffee it is ready for you when you get back.",1238716800,,1451,4.551724137931035

1813948,3,B00007JME6,"I found this DVD to be okay. I really enjoyed the am portion but agree with other reviewers that it is more of a nice short gentle stretch. But it is a great way to loosen up in the morning as I get pretty stiff when I sleep and he has a nice diversity of poses. However, he does not hold the poses long enough - often I'll pause the DVD to hold them longer. Once I am done (and I do the meditation) I usually run through a few sun salutations on my own and that gets the energy moving after Yee has so nicely warmed me up.
I did not like the pm section as much. Although beautiful and you can tell that the teacher knows what they are doing there are several problems. First is that it is primarily focused on the hamstrings and the shoulders. I'd really like my back stretched to prepare to relax for the evening. The amount of hamstring stretching can be a turn-off. Although this is important this is often the most difficult part of practice for many people so I can see why many feel that this is for 'contortionists'.

So overall the DVD is okay. The ads and intro are completely annoying at the beginning. I put it in and then go to the bathroom to give the DVD time to get to the menu before I get back. But nice easy way to start the day. I'd consider trying other Yee DVDs.",1229299200,,1284,4.075098814229249

But instead of a work-out, sometimes I really just want a routine that helps me wind down at night before going to bed, and Patricia Walden's ""PM"" part is doing that nicely. The only complaint I have is that the voice-over is a bit mumbled.

I have done the AM part once -- in the afternoon: I really can't see myself doing this right after getting up early on a regular work day. Sorry, Rodney, I will have to stick to coffee on that one!

And then there's a great surpise, Patricia Walden for the PM yoga! This contains more standing and focused postures. Plus, she has a wonderful deep shavasana at the end.

It requires quite a bit of space to practice as one has to extend ones leg fully to one side and then the other (while lying on ones back) at one point of the exercise. Using the yoga band is very helpful especially for those whose muscles are tight. A blanket is also called for towards the end but instead of buying some kind of yoga blanket, I just use a thick towel or throw.

The P.M. yoga is perfect after a day of sitting at work for hours. It's stretches seem to me more challenging than the A.M. portion. So much so that I require yoga bricks/blocks to perform the moves without feeling like I'd topple over. Whereas the A.M. yoga is mostly done on the floor, the P.M. is mostly standing and bending to the sides. It stretches the back and shoulder muscles much more but does so rather gently that at the end of the exercises and meditation, I find my mind in peace and quiet and ready for bed. I have to say though that I sweat slightly from this so after a quick shower, I'm wide awake again!

The same amount of space is required for P.M. as for the A.M. yoga. My estimate would be a 6x6 space would make executing these exercises comfortable. I have less space than that so I adjust myself along the way to get the best possible workout.",1221609600,,1507,4.318021201413427

As a fresh beginner, that was enough. Now that I've been practicing a while and used to 90-minute classes, I find they leave me wanting more. It is typically reserved for days when I want a quick 'wake up' in the morning, or to supplement my cardio routines on a 'non-yoga' day.

Rodney Yee is very soothing and the hip openers feel good in the morning. Patricia Walden is such a warm instructor and leads well. I think both of them, as well as Gaiam in general, put out very reliable products. I would recommend this DVD for beginners or people who are very pushed for time.",1221004800,2,740,4.36231884057971

I still even have the VHS, have bought and given away several DVD's, and finally decided to keep one for myself!  I use this DVD often even though I have more advanced yoga videos or take outside yoga classes, because I particularly enjoy Rodney Yee's style of instruction which is guides the user very gently and slowly.  Although I am not a physician or chiropractor by profession, I have sustained injuries, but I very much like Rodney Yee's style of instruction. It is great for someone who is just learning yoga, not accustomed to exercising frequently, or recovering from injury.  This is also a great DVD for traveling or for someone who has a busy lifestyle - but wants to ensure that regular exercise is a part of his/her lifestyle and daily practice.  There is just enough time to understand the practice, wake up those muscles and introduce you to yoga.  It's very soothing and relaxing.  I use the AM Yoga portion of it more than the PM, again because I like Rodney Yee's style of instruction compared to some of the other yoga DVD's that I have.  I've bought several other DVD's with Rodney Yee, which are for a more advanced user, but this is great for the beginner or someone who practices infrequently.  This is also very conducive for home use where there is no intructor to help physically with poses.  One caveat for the beginner is to be careful holding some of the poses when you're doing it at home (or while traveling) and on your own.

The problem I have with these DVDs is using them. They lack a decent menu so that you can find a specific place (for instance if you suddenly have to stop or accidently hit stop). They also have so much intro junk, including promotional stuff, and of course the disclaimers (3 I believe) it can take so long to get to the workout.

But once you get to the workout they are great. You can't expect to go through them perfectly the first time, but after a couple of times when you get the routines down you rarely need to look at the screen. In fact, I wish they came with an audio only option to download to an mp3 player.

I gave this only 3 stars just due to the DVD use itself. Rodney should get 5 stars.",1201824000,,1020,4.014778325123153

The rewards are felt at the relaxation and meditation segments of the program. Each narrator has a calming soothing voice, with a soothing backdrop of music that takes you deep into travel within yourself, finding the blend of body, mind, and spirit into one. Though not rigorous or flowlike, this is the perfect balance for those beginning yoga without the intense fanatic like trends that are short-lived and unrealistic.

I am, however, not as thrilled with the PM session. Probably just me, though. It's a fine evening ""cool-down"" from the day but I just didn't care for her voice as much as Rodney Yee's in the morning. No reason why you couldn't do the AM portion in the PM as well.

Lilias's vids from the 70s used to give you a lot of time during the workout to stretch and let the stretch really get into the muscles, which is exactly what I need. There's nothing wrong with a vigorous workout, but, again for me, the point of yoga is flexibility and release of tight muscles, and this video doesn't give me enough time to focus on getting stretched out.

I find when I do the AM practice in the morning (which I prefer), I am more rested, focused, and happier the entire day. It helps on a day when I have a lot to do and feel like tackling my projects is impossible. I am definitely a beginner, although naturally flexible, and I found both DVDs to be a very light workout. If you are looking to lose weight or do hardcore yoga then don't buy this DVD. If you are looking to improve your daily life and emotional outlook, I highly recommend it.

So far I have a love for the AM portion and its ability to wake me up, and find it hard to get motivated to do the PM practice late at night when I finally get ready for bed. It is definitely the more intensive of the two. I also found the AM practice to be easier to follow. Some say they prefer the PM practice in the morning because they find it invigorating, but personally it tuckers me out!

The main complaint I have about this DVD is that it is annoying to have to sit through the AM and PM bit before the top menu loads. I feel rushed in the morning so going straight to the practice would have been ideal.",1194307200,3,1181,4.042735042735043

Relaxing outdoor settings are a must and soothing non annoying instructors complete this great 2 part routine.  I think my old rotator cuff injury is finally loosening up more!

Patricia Walden's p.m. yoga is more difficult, but not too hard for me at 50 years old.

The poses and instruction are definitely geared toward beginners, but I am at an intermediate level and I still find them useful.  They do not devote much time to breathing techniques, but I have had enough practice to do that on my own.  So, if you are just beginning yoga, this is an ok place to start but I'd suggest that you find a video that will spend some time on basic technique.  If you have done some yoga before, this is an easy and quick workout that will be good if you are mindful of the things you already know.

1814304,5,B00007JME6,"Received this for my Birthday this year and it has been my best Birthday gift ever! Below are the reasons why I LOVE this DVD:
1) On the AM Yoga, this is gentle and easy to follow. **Also note that it has 4 segments. To go to the particular segment that I wish to do, I use my DVD remote navigation button and it takes me to the menu and then I choose the area that I wish to follow for the time that I have. The whole AM Yoga I found is about 20 minutes, but when I have limited time, I go just to the AM Yoga workout part.
2) The AM Relax and Meditation are perfect if I know that I will have a very busy day, this calms me yet gives me so much energy to go on with my day!
3)I am a beginner to Yoga,(did Yoga about 3 years ago with Rodney Yee VHS), so I needed a beginner DVD to start up once again. *Note that this to me, will work for a beginner and more.
4) The PM Yoga with Patricia Walden is also wonderful! This also has 4 segments, with the PM Yoga and also the meditation and relaxation. I found that I also like Patricia Walden's Yoga (almost as much as the AM).
5) There is an added part on the DVD where it shows you how to use the Yoga bricks and the mat and the strap for added results and ease in Yoga.
I fould this very helpful and have put this to good use.
6) The AM Yoga is set in beautiful Maui and the PM is in Death Valley.
7) Rodney Yee's voice is so relaxing and added to the DVD. In the past I had a couple of his Yoga videos on VHS and loved doing Yoga. Things happened and I moved and got away from Yoga, now I am back to stay. Thanks Rodney and Patricia!",1184889600,5,1584,3.7740963855421685

The morning workout is 15 minutes, and the PM is 20 minutes. I have other DVDs that I enjoy doing Yoga to, but because they run 60-90 minutes I find it hard to work them into my busy schedule. I always have and make time to at least do this DVD.

Am section to be good and the PM very unusable as everyone said. I was

surprised then to find the PM so much better then the reviews said. The

Am section left me feeling sleepy like I want to go back to bed. The PM

is energizing. The poses are held longer so you actually feel something

- though I wish for still longer! I suggest switching the Am & PM

section. I think this may work better.

One pet peeve:  wish they did not move so fast between exercises. This

is my second Rodney Yee DVD and the other one left me frustrated as well

This DVD tells you nothing about posture at all and since its a beginners DVD I would think it should. In yoga stances he never tells you what position your hips, shoulders, and back should be in. All and all I find it too confusing. Plus he speeds through yoga much too fast. I've never taken yoga and even I feel way too rushed.

I expected the PM portion to be too advanced since that is what most poor reviews complained of. I hoped the AM portion would be eonough of a practice for a near beginner like me to keep busy.

Unfortunately, I found the AM practice too short to actually feel that I had accomplished anything. I felt neither stretched, challenged, or especially relaed.  My other complaint is the commercial (which you are not allowed to fast forward) seems to go on forever.

I think Rodney Yee and Patricia Walden are pretty accomplished yogi's (hence the 4 stars) so may try one of his/her other tapes in the future. This one I will return.",1171670400,15,788,4.614285714285714

Rodney Yee's workout is deceptively simple and yet, if one does it on a regular basis you will find that there is so much to gain in each stretch.  I purchased a yoga book by Rodney Yee and found it gave me a whole new perspective on yoga and on how to practice the poses in this video (I am still using the video until it wears out).  He explains how one can effectively go deeper into each pose thereby improving the stretch and the yoga experience.  It works.",1171411200,5,716,4.313432835820896

I just rewind the DVD to the beginning of the section and leave it there for the next day so I don't have to suffer through the long commercial about organic clothing.  I can't rave enough about this DVD.  It is perfect for any beginner in a stressful job who does not have enough time!!!

It starts with a short relaxation routine, moves into great, thorough stretching - mostly on the floor, and ends with a short but restful meditation. It is meant to warm you up, and relax you to start the day feeling great. Yee's voice is soothing, and the music is understated and lovely. I am truly grateful that I found this. It's short enough that I can fit it in every day. It feels so good that I am buying it again in DVD after wearing the first one (a video) out.

It is NOT an ""exercise"" program, so if you're looking for a real morning workout, this is not it, though I would recommend it to anyone for those times you need to limber your muscles and spine, release trapped energy, de-stress, and re-center yourself - AM or PM.

Patricia Walden's PM program is a bit more physical, with some good standing poses, but is not overly challenging, so also a good choice for beginners. However, My five stars is really for the AM part. The PM section is just a bonus as far as I'm concerned.",1170633600,5,1055,4.3232323232323235

What I have found so suprising is that aside from the obvious physical benefits of the poses, I am beginning and ending my day with more calmness. I am a ""type-A"" wife, mom, and college professor, and my days can be very busy.  Including A.M. and P.M. Yoga has pointed me down a path of less hurrying and more overall calmness in how I approach my activities.  I feel better physically AND mentally.  The music is very relaxing and the beautiful visuals remind me to STOP for awhile and appreciate my surroundings.  (People who are always in a hurry often miss this.)  In my opinion, the DVD is well produced and effective.  I have no trouble accessing various parts of the workout through the DVD menu.  When time is short, I skip the Intro. or Calming sections and jump right to the workout. The pace of the DVD is slow and calm, and it has a nice even flow. Lighting a few candles in the room really adds to the experience for me.

If this is the style you are looking for, then I highly recommend this DVD.  For less than the price of one ""live"" class, you can use it as often as you like.  On very stressful days, you might even want to just do the calming and relaxation portions of the program.

Watching this DVD changed my opinion of yoga, and now I'm addicted.  When I consistently practice this, I am significantly less stressed out - all day long.  The poses in this DVD are slow and careful, but if you do them perfectly and somewhat painfully, it's not a bad workout, either.  After a few weeks of this, I signed up again for a yoga class, this time at the Iyengar Institute in NYC, and found that to be hugely fulfilling as well.  So, if you're looking for something to help you relax, and a good intro to yoga, this is one of your best bets.

Neither are very strenuous and I found that, as someone completely new to yoga, the poses were easy to get.  The first few times, there were muscles being stretched and used that I didn't know I had, but it still wasn't too hard.  More than anything this DVD is stretching.  Some poses require a little stamina, but overall this is a very approachable routine.

There are several warnings and advirtisements before you can access the main menu, but some of them it lets you skip.  The background of the A.M. yoga (with Rodney Yee) is soft ocean waves.  The sound of the surf I found to be relaxing.  The P.M. Yoga (with Patricia Walden) is set in a desert, with a gentle wind.

The non-stop coaching was like aerobics; there was no time for silence, contemplation or for me to take a breath.  The entire time Rodney Yee and the pm instructor are talking and very quickly.  I had to turn the volume off to enjoy the postures. You can tell that both instructors are rushing to fit a ridiculous time limit of 10 minutes.  The segments end abrubtly making the entire program disjointed and there is no transition from am to pm or between instructors.  I might give it to someone with attention deficit disorder- someone who needs constant stimulation or direction.

The workouts do become addictive once you start doing them.  I like the A.M. one with Rodney Yee on mornings I wake up and feel sluggish.  The poses are gentle and by the end of the session, I can notice an improvement in my circulation and feel more energetic. I like the P.M. one with Patricia Walden after a long day at work. It is definitely more difficult than the A.M. program, but if you stay with it, you will find that the more challenging stretching exercises near the end are actually relaxing. Ironically, I find the final relaxation pose hardest after a stressful day--getting the muscles in the lower back to relax enough for the back to touch the floor can be difficult when feeling tense. It's amazing how poses that look so simple can be so challenging. But that's one of the great things about yoga--the more you do it, the more you recognize the benefits and challenges in mastering each pose.  If you try these workouts just a few times a week for a couple of months, you will enjoy permament improvement in your flexibility, even if you stop doing the workouts for months at a time. But once you pick them up again, you will wonder why you ever stopped. Physical benefits aside, the workouts are great for reducing stress and clearing the ""clutter"" from the mind.

The PM section seemed longer and was slightly more challenging as she had more poses both standing and sitting. It was more of a workout and I found it odd that it was for the evening. I thought it was more invigorating like what you would need to start your day and that Rodney's part should have been for the evening!

I'm a beginner to the yoga practice and actually started out with another dvd from Gaiam called 'Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss' that, while not really doing much for weight loss, helped me as a beginner ease into and familiarize myself with the different poses that are shown in the AM/PM dvd.

I find that I actually prefer the AM, with Rodney Yee, portion better than the PM. The transitions seem to be more natural and fluid than the PM portion which makes one think the instructor, Patricia Walden, was trying to cram every move into the allotted 20 minutes. Which I can say didn't help me to relax before getting into bed. I've ended up just using AM section for both AM and PM. The dvd is still worth it to me though.

It is helpful for when you can't be in yoga studio everyday. Or you come back from office work and need a good refreshing stretch. Those who call the routines simple, easy and boring perhaps need to know the nuances of yoga and I can promise you that many of the poses by Rodney Yee and Patricia Walden are extremely challenging when DONE PERFECTLY, which means breath regulation, having a keen understanding of where your sit bones are, how active are your quads, how you are maintaining stretch in your hamstrings, what is happening to your abdominal muscles, where your shoulder blades are viz a viz your spine, what is the alignment of your hips in a pose, how you increase spine length with inhalation and you settle down further in the pose with exhalation. If you are aware of that (which you can only learn with a good yoga teacher), then you will really appreciate these seemingly simple workouts. I also like the fact that they both don't speak too much as in some of the yoga dvds, you hear them talking so much that you can't focus on your pose.

 These workouts need to be done over and over again and with each time, you learn something new about your body. You observe your limitations, and you work with your body and not force upon it any pose.

1814610,3,B00007JME6,"First of all, as somebody else has already mentioned, there's a VERY long ad that you'll have to go thru' before getting to the yoga practice itself.  Since it's a commercial product that I bought, I think it's invasive that I'd have to have advertising imposed on me even if it sells supposedly organic stuff.  For me the time waiting for it is annoying, but it's simply wrong in principle.

I think the am yoga part is good if you want to have a routine to follow.  However, RY does not give very explicit instructions.  But since I also own Alan Finger's yogazone dvd series, I use what I've learned from him and apply on RY's program.  ANd it helps.  To me a good teacher is someone, who even in talking about a simple pose for instance, can help me understand much more than that one pose.  WHo thru' something as simple as that,gets to a much deeper place which makes me understand the NECESSITY of practicing that art.  (I think that applies to not just yoga teachers...) I think Alan Finger is a true master in that way.  Unfortunately, I don't get that feeling with RY.

With the pm yoga part (taught by Patricia Walden), I simply can't follow very well since I am not completely familiar with some of the poses.  So I don't know how much of my not liking it as much as Alan Finger's videos was because of my own frustration.  However,  I could use a little more clarity in her verbal explanation for sure.  In any case, I still think Alan Finger is the best amongst the 3 teachers.  I HIGHLY recommend his yoga zone videos.  Whether you are a beginner of not, I think Alan Finger is a true master and he certainly touches on the essence of yoga.",1150070400,18,1655,4.356209150326797
1814611,5,B00007JME6,"Origianlly I borrowed the VHS version of this DVD from my local public library. I was 355 # and huffed and puffed when I went up ONE flight of stairs at the time I began this practice. The only other thing I did was refrain from eating after 6pm. That's it. Nothing else. Over a period of several weeks, my body began to have more stamina, my breathing increased, my circulation felt wonderful, sex was terrific and I was losing weight. I'm down to 280 # and have 60 # more to go to reach my target weight.

Yoga isn't for everyone but this DVD is more about stretching and holding the post. I'm now able to hold a pose for a count of 30 even though I could hold it longer, I don't because I do not want my morning Yoga to feel like a chore. Thus I stick with the basic hold to 20 or 30.

The only other thing I did was slowly implement 20 push ups, 20 leg lifts (per side) and a 10 seconds of isometric with my arms. Nothing else.

It feels great. Thanks Rodney! I bought a copy of this while at the store and was pleased as pie with the newer DVD edition.

If you're sick and tired of being fat, outdated and not limber, THIS is the program for you! Then just roll out of bed, go pee an do your 14 minute workout and you'll never complain again about aches, pains & minor indignities again! This program works!",1149465600,19,1312,4.073643410852713
1814651,4,B00007JME6,"I bought this Yoga DVD after assessing my day to day life and concluding that I had too many stressors affecting my mood and my body. I had heard from numerous friends that Yoga was an enlightening activity that could, if done properly, help bring balance to my life and help de-stress everyday situations and events. I'm glad to say that this DVD has helped do just that. I checked other Yoga DVDs available on Amazon, but I picked this one first not only because it said ""Beginners"" but because it had workouts for both the morning and evening. Each workout is roughly 20 minutes each and slowly starts to build basic Yoga skills.

The morning session starts out simple, relaxed. Rodney Yee engages you in exercises that are neither strenuous nor painful. They awaken the body and prepare it for the day ahead. However, as I continued these DVDs over a month I began to feel as if the A.M. session wasn't challenging enough. Sure, it starts off easily for a beginner, but it doesn't push you to challenge yourself a little more. Rodney's exercises are good, but they are almost too basic if you plan on continuing on to other forms of Yoga.

I especially enjoyed the evening session of Yoga with Patricia Walden. Unlike Rodney Yee, Patricia Walden's session of Yoga challenges you. When I started this DVD I initially thought that Ms. Walden's portion was too difficult for a beginner, but it wasn't. As I continued on with both sessions I started to feel that Patricia's section challenged my mind and body more than Rodney's. In fact, I started to enjoy the evening session because of the challenges it provided. Sure, Patricia's exercises start out difficult if you're just jumping into Yoga, but over time they become easier and more comforting. While I still can't do everything to the extent that Ms. Walden does in her portion, I know I'm slowly getting there each time I practice and that make me feel excellent. With Rodney's portion I feel that I am equal to beyond his exercise and I wish it provided more of a challenge.

Overall this DVD is a good buy if you are a beginner looking to dive into Yoga. The morning session will keep you busy for a while, but the evening session is the one that will push you to do more and go really get into Yoga. If, however, you feel you are fit enough and need more of a challenge, then this DVD might not be the one for you.",1149379200,6,2376,4.52093023255814

You may find that the poses are not held very long, and that the transitions can be a bit quick at times, but these two series are meant to be short, and easily fit into daily life.

I don't have a lot of time in the morning and a short 20 minute set like this is perfect for me. Rodney Yee is in a large part respnsible for the current yoga boom and deserves credit for that.  In my endless search for short workouts I recently discovered another AM/PM workout that rocked my yoga world! It is Ana & Ravis, AM/PM Yoga. Also, not too demanding but very effective (and I really appreciate that they have no annoying commercials or ocean scenes!) Rodney Yee does I gues Iyengar Yoga which is very exact has given me the tools to experience other yoga systems to the fullest. Ravi & Ana's Kundalini Yoga covers ""aerobic"" stretching, toning and strengthening of the muscles and nervous system in every workout. If someone asked me to pick one yoga to do it would be kundalini since it covers it all much faster and I can't live without the yoga ""high"" I get after doing their workout. I also prefer their PM section. It makes me sleep like a baby.

I bought these on VHS when I was new to yoga and did the PM yoga almost nightly.  The PM yoga routine is very thorough, stretching every part of your body and incorporating almost every basic yoga pose.  I noticed after only a week that my flexibility had increased substantially.  Even after becoming more seasoned with yoga, these routines still provide a good 20 minutes of deep breathing and stretching.  They never get old because as your ability increases, you can just dive deeper into each pose.  I often recommend these videos to people looking to get into yoga but they are equally great for everyone else.  They're a nice treat to add to your day.",1136678400,6,928,4.542168674698795
1814731,3,B00007JME6,"Years ago someone suggested that I try yoga as a stress reliever, and I've not been able to shake the idea since then.  Recently I`ve taken two one hour Yoga classes at a local gym (of which I`m no longer a member.)  Then I bought this DVD.  Currently, I`m a beginner of questionable fitness.  Yet I can see myself  one day agreeing wholeheartedly with the following statement by A.M. instructor Rodney Lee: ""Yoga is the foundation of my day.  A few minutes in the morning will help give meaning to your day.""

This DVD contains two 20 minute yoga programs, a segment on the proper use of props, and interviews with both instructors.

The A.M. segment with Rodney Lee is truly for beginners, and I find it a very relaxing way to start the day.  The poses are easy enough for the beginner to focus on breathing.  There is ample time for transition between poses.

The P.M. segment with Patricia Walden, on the other hand, may not be for people of all levels of fitness--contrary to what it reads on the back of the DVD case.  The P.M. segment requires much more flexibility than many beginners may possess.  In fairness, there are attempts to make accommodations for those with less flexibility, namely using a folded blanket or brick.  Yet it is difficult to focus on the breathing and relaxation that are at the core of Yoga when most of your attention is focused on the act of stretching itself.  Furthermore, Ms. Walden moves through poses quickly, making it difficult for beginners to follow the PM workout without constantly watching the television and scrambling to catch up.  Yet her commentary regarding what to do while in a position is very clear , helpful, and precise.  Although my leg muscles quiver after a P.M. workout, I do feel more calm and centered with less tension in my other muscles.

In conclusion, I recommend this DVD for the beginner with the caution that the P.M. section may be a welcome challenge and opportunity to improve one's flexibility.",1135641600,70,1972,4.683139534883721
1814732,2,B00007JME6,"I am a true beginner - I have never done yoga before. I am also quite inflexible. I've been using this DVD for a few weeks now. I quite enjoy the AM yoga, but the PM yoga stinks. Even after a few weeks, with some additional in-the-moment tips and pointers from people more experienced with yoga, I still can barely follow Patricia's routine. She races through each pose, and even her concessions for less flexible people are unattainable for me. Who is she kidding that I can sit on the floor, put my legs out in front of me and put my head on my shins?!?! If I could do that, I wouldn't be watching beginner's yoga. I enjoy the opportunity to try to increase my flexibility - don't get me wrong - and for this reason alone, I keep trying to follow her along. But her other poses - and the transitions between the poses - are just too hard for a true beginner to follow and execute. This session is, in my opinion, really for an intermediate audience. At the end of her routine, I am wound up and stressed because I have been confused and frustrated throughout.

The AM session is much better. The poses are easier and yet accomplish the task of helping me to transition out of sleep and into a productive day. Rodney's instructions are clear, well-paced, and complete (for example, whenever Rodney tells you to inhale, he tells you to exhale a few seconds later. If you try to follow Patricia's breathing instructions, however, you would end up blue and in the hospital).

Considering that the only real value I get out of this DVD is the 20-minute morning session, I cannot rate this DVD higher than 2 stars.",1134604800,42,1610,4.4358108108108105
1814733,4,B00007JME6,"I have been practicing yoga for several years and am probably somewhere between intermediate and advanced in my practice considering where I will probably end my journey. I have a limited amount of time in the morning before going to work, but I wanted to do some yoga before starting the day and find the AM practice to be just the ticket. I tend to wake every day with a bit of stiffness in my lower back (despite my Tempurpedic mattress). Rodney gets me warmed up and physically and spiritually balanced every morning. Without this practice I would probably be experiencing some lower back problems from time to time, as I did before starting AM yoga.

I do find one deficiency with the practice, however. Since this DVD is targeted towards the beginner, I feel that a lot more emphasis should be placed on proper breathing, that being the foundation of any practice. Rodney does mention breathing several times during the practice, but does not give it the importance it should have, IMHO. I get a lot more out of my AM yoga, when I focus on my breath along with the asanas.

I have done the PM practice a few times, like it, but agree with some other reviewers that it is probably more of an advanced beginner practice rather than a real beginner practice, if that makes sense.

I'd give this DVD 4.5 stars if that was possible, and recommend this DVD particularly for those who wake up with lower back stiffness.",1132876800,14,1418,4.574803149606299

So I started doing it every morning four months ago followed by one or another of the relaxations on Yee's Relaxation for Meditation CD. (I need more than the two minute meditation on the AM Tape. In fact I had trouble meditating anyway and prefered a guided relaxation.) Very nice combination

Then I started throwing in Yoga for Abs or Yoga for Arm Strength (in between the other two)That worked wonderfully--I'd feel really nice--calm and cheerful afterwards.

I generally tell people to use the AM in the evening before bed since I think it helps a busy person wind down; but, if you suffer from stiffness in the morning then I do recommend the AM to be used then.",1126310400,9,446,4.373493975903615
1814783,5,B00007JME6,"While I have trouble doing the AM routine on a regular basis, or as often as I would really like, I do the PM routine two or three times a week.  The AM routine gets me moving and centered before the craziness of the day can get hold of my mind.  The PM routine is one I look forward to doing because it gently works the kinks and tenseness out of my muscles, and truly calms my mind.  I estimate that doing these routines a combined 4-5 times a week has helped me get to sleep an extra thirty earlier (as opposed to staring at the ceiling), and remain calm when things get crazy at work or juggling home schedules.

If you are looking for short routines in a time-crunched day or something to 'dip your toe' into before getting serious about it, this is an excellent starting point.",1126137600,4,783,4.23489932885906
1814784,3,B00007JME6,"Having recently discovered a 5:00 a.m. yoga show, I quickly came to love it.  Of course, being the night owl that I am, waking up so early was getting a little hard, so I decided to buy this DVD.  My show is an hour long.  This DVD, if you don't count the introduction, is 30 minutes long.  The morning is 15 minutes, as well as the evening section.  I like the evening section more because it is the harder positions, whereas the morning is mostly lying on your back and sitting for meditation.  I enjoy yoga because of the stretching, which is why I do not prefer this portion.  But at a low price, I have no qualms with this product.",1124323200,4,636,4.206611570247934
1814785,3,B00007JME6,"While the instruction in this beautifully done DVD is clear, I found that the poses are not for beginners.  I have been doing yoga for eight months and struggled with getting into some of the poses properly.  The A.M./P.M. format is GREAT!",1123977600,,239,4.666666666666667
1814786,3,B00007JME6,"If you don't have a lot of time but still want to do yoga then this DVD is pretty good. Most yoga DVD's go for an hour or more. This makes it hard for someone who has a busy schedule (or kids!). Knowing you can't do the whole thing can discourage you from even starting. Or the beginner who feels intimated by such long secessions. This DVD though has two 20 minute classes. You can even break them up more if you want. Before starting each class you are giving the choice of where to start. Maybe you just want to do the relaxation or meditation secession. With that said, I don't find the two classes being equal. The AM class is really great. It is very relaxing and gives you a good stretch. Your body feels much better afterwards, be it to start the day or end it. Even though it is AM, it is good to do any time of the day, especially if you are feeling stressed or stiff. I am not crazy about the PM yoga, though it may just be my personal tastes. I think that she moves much too fast for someone that is completely new to yoga. She gives instruction as she is doing it, but it seems to leave little time for a beginner to get the pose right before continuing on. The same could be said for AM, as he does the same thing, but the poses are much easier and more focused on relaxing and stretching. I would give the AM class 5 stars and the PM class 3 stars. The DVD is still worth getting, even if just for the AM class. Though you might enjoy the PM more them I have. If you are looking for longer secessions with more instruction then you will probably want to look at another DVD.",1123804800,,1589,4.079872204472843
1814787,4,B00007JME6,"This DVD seems to be good for those who are new to yoga. My husband and I do both the A.M. and P.M. yoga sessions most days. The first few days were a little rough as we had never done yoga before and felt pretty sore after. Neither of us are very flexible, so the ""gently rest your forehead on your shin"" comments are amusing.

We enjoy the A.M. session the most, but it doesn't seem very invigorating. In fact, it makes us both relaxed. And the P.M. session tends to awaken us more. We both found that the P.M. session was more difficult.

Our only real complaint about the video is that we both felt like more time needed to be devoted to holding the stretches, and that equal time be given for each direction of the stretch. Whichever stretch they start with tends to have the longest ""holding"" time. Granted, this video is supposed to be a quick intro to yoga, and there are other videos out there that hold stretches for longer time, but we felt like even 4-5 more seconds of holding the strech would have been better.

We appreciated the ""props"" part of the video as well. It goes through how to use the blocks, straps, and mat, which we found helpful. I would recommend purchasing a block or two and a strap for those who aren't as flexible.

I noticed that even after the first week I was more flexible than when we first started. My husband can't say the same yet, but he hasn't given up hope.",1123459200,4,1403,4.303030303030303

1814789,4,B00007JME6,"You should only get this DVD if you are a complete beginner to yoga, and do not do any other type of physical activity.  It is far too easy for someone in halfway decent shape, regardless of their knowledge of yoga.

If you want to get an idea of how easy it is, during the 15 minute A.M. workout, you only have to stand up one time.  The most strenuous part of the workout is doing some deep hamstring and groin stretching movements with a strap around the sole of your foot.  Even those are very easy, if you are already flexible enough to bend forward and touch the floor with no difficulty.

It's not a bad way to start the day, because Mr. Yee does take a few minutes for ""conscious relaxation"" at the beginning of the workout, and a few minutes for meditation at the end.  You will get a sense of relaxation and well being from these activities.

Rodney Yee clearly knows his stuff, and he even admits in an interview that you will not receive the full benefits of yoga from this DVD.  If you're in poor physical condition, and/or only have 20 minutes in the morning to practice yoga, this might be a good DVD for you.

I'm planning to try Yee's more intense ""Power Yoga - Total Body Workout"" and attempt to shorten the 65 minute workout.",1122163200,9,1244,4.304721030042918

If so, I will be the first one to buy it:)  Happy practicing everyone!!!",1118707200,8,355,4.101449275362318
1814837,5,B00007JME6,"I'm not what you would consider a typical yogi. In fact, I always viewed Yoga as sort of a joke. But after tiring of weight training and cardio(UGH!), I took a chance on yoga. I was a little scared because I'm not exactly the most flexible person but this DVD quickly soothed all of my fears. AM/PM Yoga for beginners is a great introduction to yoga. The DVD is broken into 2 segments: AM Yoga featuring Rodney Yee and PM Yoga with Patricia Walden. The AM Yoga segment runs around 20 minutes including centering, meditation and the actual AM Yoga workout. It is a very gentle and soothing introduction that even a complete beginner can quickly master. Rodney Yee is a great instructor as he easily transitions you from pose to pose with his hypnotic voice guiding you along the way. You will need a yoga strap for a couple of the stretches in AM Yoga. PM Yoga is a bit more challenging as Patricia Walden takes you through a similar but more intense workout. It is also roughly 20 minutes in length. Walton uses yoga blocks to achieve some of the PM Yoga poses but they are not essential. Both workout definitely have their rewards. AM Yoga centers, relaxes, awakens and invigorates the body for the day and PM Yoga centers and relaxes the muscles for rest. Overall, if your looking to get into yoga this DVD is a great place to start and at a very reasonable price. Highly Recommended.",1115424000,21,1386,4.503968253968254

1814839,5,B00007JME6,The first time I tried it I was a bit frustrated but overall its very good.  Its a nice beginer series and is relaxing.  The workouts are short - something that everyone should do daily.,1112486400,,186,4.285714285714286
1814840,4,B00007JME6,"I purchased A.M./P.M. Yoga as an introduction to Yoga and something I could do with my kids in the early morning to keep them from parking themselves in front of the TV.  It is a wonderful introduction to yoga.  The poses are simple, the verbage straightforward and the visual back ground very relaxing.  It is a wonderful way to start and end the day. Plus, my kids enjoy doing the poses and watching the screen.  The morning portion is short, only abou 20 minutes, with 7 minutes of that being relaxation techniques, so if you are looking forward to a workout, then this is not the DVD for you.  It is a simple stretch routine to get the blood flowing in the morning and calm you down at night.

I will note, however, that I get a kick out of seeing them do their poses on a plywood board (the setting is in the sand, so they needed something harder to lay across).  Seems like they could have splurged and purchased a throw rug to put over it, but to me it is just funny, it does not take away from the yoga.",1112054400,5,1011,4.2072538860103625
1814841,5,B00007JME6,"I keep being told that yoga is supposed to be relaxing, but until I found this DVD, my perception was the opposite.  My first yoga class was a disaster; my legs hurt so much that I could barely walk for the next three days.  Most DVDs I've purchased see yoga as a sport and similarly try to make it hard on the muscles, but this one is different.

A.M. Yoga with Rodney Yee is my favorite.  Mr. Yee has a soothing voice that gently relaxes my body.  Instead of strenuous poses, the workout focuses on stretching and meditation.  A beginner who has no familiarity with yoga terminology could easily follow along.  All the positions are fairly natural and gentle.  The only flaw is that I do not think this workout would make me ""energized"" for the day; instead it makes me so relaxed I feel as though I can fall asleep afterward.

While Patricia Walden also includes meditation and relaxing exercises in her P.M. Yoga workout, she also includes some more strenuous standing poses.  I would not recommend this workout to a true beginner because she does not provide enough instruction on how to adjust the pose if you are not flexible enough to do it.  In the middle of holding a pose, the screen would occasionally flash to an easier version with props, but this was not shown or described enough to really help a novice.  Once you know your own ability and how to adjust poses to your own flexibility level then you can safely tackle Walden's workout.  The props bonus instruction on this DVD will help somewhat, but you really need a comprehensive instructional DVD in my opinion.

If you are looking for a strenuous workout that will build your strength, this is definately not a good buy, but if you want a relaxing way to begin and end your day, check out this DVD.",1111449600,10,1769,4.522012578616352
1814842,4,B00007JME6,"I bought this DVD knowing very little about yoga but needing something to help do stretching and improve my flexability because I was starting to feel kind of stiff when I woke up in the morning.  This DVD is great.  Its easy to follow and the poses are easy to do.  I alternate using the AM and PM sessions in the morning so I don't get too bored with either of the sessions. The AM session is a little easier and doesn't seem as difficult as the PM session.  Afterwards I feel really stretched out and much better. I definitely notice a difference if I skip a day and don't do it.

Although I love that each session is only about 20 min. and fits perfectly into my busy schedule, I do wish that in each session they would hold the poses a little longer. You feel a little rushed at times.  It would be a 5 star rating if they held the poses longer and each session was drawn out to 30 min.  All in all, I highly recommend this for yoga beginners or anybody looking for a good stretch.",1109894400,7,986,4.130890052356021

I actually disagree with people. I've been doing the PM yoga each night before bed and falling right to sleep when I'm done. Perhaps they aren't doing all three sections. I also find the AM yoga a great way to start my active day.

The P.M. session had me off my mat. The instructor uses a big square space, most yoga mats are small and rectangular, so I didn't understand the concept. The postures were ok. I find going to class more enjoyable than this video. The instructors were very warm and conveyed the postures in an easy to understand format. Their tones of voice were soothing.

I am pretty certain after about a month I will be finished with this DVD. they should have offered extended length work outs for beginners as well but as far as I can tell you just get the two short work outs.

I like the evening work out much better than the morning work out, and truth be told I wish rodney yee would put on some clothes. his body may be flawless but I find his choice of work out gear leaving little to the imagination. sorry man, put on a shirt please. the evening work out is a little challenging but flows quite nicely. I get much more out of the evening work out than the morning work out.

finally, I am incredibly annoyed by GAIAMs foolish decision to not only beat you over the head with their advertising but make it so you can't just skip past it, you have to forward through it. it's pretty dreadful and quite distasteful. mighty spiritual of you GAIAM, nice work.

Rodney Yee's morning workout (the A.M.) is great to get you going in the morning by easing you into activity instead of jumping into it. However, the reason for the tapes 4 star review, instead of a perfect 5 is that Rodney does seem to have a tendancy to speed through. From the little reading I have done, it seems that you are to hold a yoga pose for much longer then Mr. Yee istructs us to do so.

Then there's the Patricia Walden portion (the P.M.) is perfection. She is consistently instructive in helping us maintain and achieve better posture and correct positioning. Not to mention that, in my opinion, her routine is better paced for us beginners. Lovely  experience.

1814895,2,B00007JME6,"I practice yoga every morning and evening, so I'm always looking for new practices. This one has beautiful scenery and music, but I didn't care for the AM practice. In the AM practice Rodney Yee barely hold the poses and it ends up being a very short. It would be a much better if he held the poses, even for a couple of seconds. This would also extend the length of the practice. He also starts with lying down relaxation, which I think is not necessary in the morning (I just wanted to go back to sleep).  On one of the other reviews the person suggests switching the AM and PM practice, so maybe that would work better.

The PM practice is very good and you could do this one either in the morning or the evening. The poses are held for a bit longer than the AM routine.

You also get a short instruction on the DVD on how to use props and again a very short practice with the props. Also, the DVD has very good menu interface, so that's a plus. You can pick and choose which workout and which segment you'd like to use.

If you're looking for a really good AM practice, I would suggest Yoga for Surfers. It's my favorite! If you're looking for a good all around Yoga DVD, try Yoga of Urban Living. See my other reviews on yoga DVDs for more information. Namaste.",1095120000,48,1266,4.2190082644628095
1814896,5,B00007JME6,"This DVD contains two excellent yoga practices which are perfect for virtually all levels of yoga practitioners, particularly advanced beginners to intermediates. Although both practices are labelled as being 20 minutes long, the actual time varies a bit: AM Yoga has a 4-minute breathing exercise followed by a 12-minute yoga program, and PM Yoga is approximately 24 minutes.  Although both of these programs are probably doable to those new to yoga, they do assume some prior familiarity with the poses (total yoga newbies will find Yoga Journal's Yoga Practice for Beginners to be an excellent place to start). I have been practicing yoga for several years and am now at an intermediate level, but I continue to use both of these practices on a regular basis.

AM Yoga provides a practice so gentle that I've frequently performed it upon first waking up and while still in my pajamas. The simple breathing exercise helps your mind to focus, and then the basic twists and other poses which follow help your body to awaken. The practice is led by Rodney Yee, an excellent instructor who provides flawless cuing and who has an extremely calm, soothing voice--ideal for anyone who is not a morning person!  PM Yoga is a very nice practice for winding down, relaxing, and stretching. It also begins with a short focus on breathing, encouraging you to turn your attention inward ""where it's quiet."" The practice moves from a seated to a kneeling position and also includes traditional standing poses such as a warrior and lunges. This is a great end-of-day workout or a quick practice to fit in anytime you need to relax. Patricia Walden is also a very good instructor, but her cuing is not quite as accurate as Rodney's.

Rodney Yee is a great yoga instructor and the DVD is worth buying for his AM Yoga if not for anything else.
