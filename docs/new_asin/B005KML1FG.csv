After watching it the first time I went right to the IMDB discussion board to get answers. After that I watched again and it made much more sense. (I'm not quick to pick up on things!)  Didn't end the way I wanted, but oh well. I've watched it over and over and can't get tired of it.",1458777600,,408,4.298701298701299

8476991,3,B005KML1FG,But very slow.  Acting is good and the topic sadly is a common and current in Israel today.  Not sorry i got the DVD but probably will not watch it that often.,1400457600,,159,3.9375
8476992,5,B005KML1FG,"""Seven Minutes in Heaven"" is a 2008 movie from Israel (98 min.), not to be confused with the same-titled 1985 movie featuring Jennifer Connely. In the Israeli movie, as it opens, we get to know Galia, a young woman in Jerusalem, dealing with  the aftermath of a terrible terrorist attack on a bus that she and her boyfriend Oren were on. Oren does not survive the attack but Galia does, althoug barely (she was unconscious and apparently lost for 7 minutes, hence the movie's title), and with severe burns and memory loss. One year later, Galia is determined to find out what really happened, including finding the rescue worker who saved her. Meanwhile, Galia gets to know Boaz, a guy whom she meets on the street when she becomes disoriented. Boaz starts helping her on more ways than one, and Galia relishes his help and finding herself becoming closer to him. Then we get treated to flashbacks of Galia and Oren's relationship, and maybe things weren't all that great as we once thought. Will Galia find the rescue worker? What will become of the budding relationship between Galia and Boaz? And what was really going on between Galia and Oren before the terrorist attack? To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie, from newcomer writer-director Omri Givon does an outstanding job in bringing to life, in vivid details, what it's like to be a survivor of a terrorist attack, and the huge black hole that comes after it. Just chilling. We don't actually get to see the bus bombing until late in the movie, for reasons that I don't want to tell as it plays a big part in the plot. Galia (played superbly by Israeli actress Reymond Amsalem), has to deal with the guilt of surviving and her boyfriend dying, while having to make sense of her life ahead. Then there are a number of other aspects in the movie that become clearer later on, much like peeling an onion and finding new layers (while inducing tears).

As always, this Film Movement DVD comes with a bonus shortie, in this case an equally intruiging 12 min. Brazilian feature called ""Grandmothers"", and if you wonder what the link might be between this and the main Israeli feature, one word: Auswitch. Just watch! That aside, ""Seven Minutes in Heaven"" is a superb movie and if you are in the mood for something that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1369526400,3,2485,4.6819221967963385
8476993,5,B005KML1FG,"Seven Minutes in Heaven is not a typical Israeli drama. Though the film begins with a terrorist attack in the streets of Jerusalem, the story goes beyond the prism of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to introduce Galia's human dilemma:
Should we dream and hide from the truth, or accept reality as it is, relieved because we are no longer ignorant? During 90 minutes, we observes Galia in a journey that will change the rest of her life. To sublimate the powerful message of the film, the filmmaker has chosen the amazing Reymond Amsalem who delivers a stunning performance. An incredible actress for an incredible film!",1338940800,6,620,4.971153846153846
