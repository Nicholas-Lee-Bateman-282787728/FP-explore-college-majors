2578524,5,B000FOPZZ6,I wanted to be sure that the movie didn't stray to far from reality.  I read a book by the pope's secretary.  The makers of this movie did an outstanding job with its authenticity.  Beautiful.,1365638400,5,192,4.428571428571429

2578547,4,B000FOPZZ6,"I love this movie so much, saw it first on YouTube.
My only disappointment is that there are scenes that they took out, and you can notice it from the black screen that cuts them out...
But if you didn't see it before you probably wouldn't notice as much",1481328000,,254,4.204081632653061

2578569,5,B000FOPZZ6,"This entire 2CD set is fabulous. Piotr Adamczyk  (plays Jean Paul)  ""steals the show"", as they say! I have read several unhappy

2578571,5,B000FOPZZ6,"I love it. Interesting facts about history that people seem to forget. The acting is very good, not exagerated very nuanced, very intelligent,  from Piotr Adamczyk and everybody else. Being French-Canadian,  I was moved by that story, knowing what it's like to struggle to keep my language and culture.  And seeing how far some cruel and unscrupulous individuals can go to get what they want. And ""some"" individuals is a lot of individuals: Even if there was Resistance, how have they manage to do it, to kill so many people because of a race without being caught by police of other countries? It makes me think seriously about what is going on in the wars, presently in 2014. What is happening that we don't know of? Propaganda....The immigration of people of different races...
As for Amazon.com, the DVD arrived in good condition. I am always satisfied with Amazon.com or Amazon.ca.",1408838400,,885,4.886666666666667

2578573,5,B000FOPZZ6,"JPII will be canonized a saint by the Catholic Church in April of this year.  This is a riveting story of a man of unparalleled faith, goodness, and charity.  If you ever wondered why God has given you a cross to bear - ""Why me, Lord?""  then watching the life of this holy man unfold will answer that question.  He suffered many hardships and his final walk with the Lord was a difficult medical condition which he bore with strength and dignity.  I thank God for this man.  He left behind many profound writings most notable for me - the Dignity of Women, the Theology of the Body, and Redemptive Suffering.  Truly a modern saint!",1395532800,4,631,4.434782608695652
2578574,5,B000FOPZZ6,"Beautiful!  From Pope John Paul II's simple Polish upbringing, to his losses and suffering during and after WWII, to his growth as a man of deep faith which led him not only to becoming the head of the world's largest Church but a leader of the free world. This story kept me at the edge of my seat to the end.  If only Hollywood could make more great movies such as this; but then again, we usually only get an individual like this once in a lifetime.  To the cast, crew, writers and directors -- BRAVO!",1394150400,,504,4.229166666666667

2578576,5,B000FOPZZ6,"I bought the entire mini-series, 2-DVDs. The best money I have ever spent. Piotr Adamczyk brings Pope JP-II back to life. Nobody else should even attempt to play this part. After seeing this series you will never be able to watch another movie about John Paul II.

 Away from the movie, I never realized what John Paul II had to over come on his journey to become without doubt one of the most beloved Pope of our time..",1367971200,7,420,4.371794871794871

8125008,4,B000FOPZZ6,"This was a wonderful movie in two parts, but I was disappointed, after watching the first part on Netflix with captions, that I could not get captions on the disks I purchased. Then I rented Part 2 from Netflix, and could not get the captions on that either! For people like me who have hearing loss, it is essential to be able to use the captioned disks. The casting and actors were terrific, as well as the historical perspective, and it seemed very authentic. I was sorry to miss so much of the dialog.",1508803200,2,505,4.382978723404255
