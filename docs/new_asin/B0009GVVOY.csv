8060566,5,B0009GVVOY,"As a Peter Cushing and Ray Milland fan I have to say this is one of their best movies! The story, the acting, the directing of this thriller
with CATS is excellent. Very scary. I love CATS so maybe that's one reason but I just think it's better than a lot of Cushing's movies
and probably because it's not a Hammer movie people over look this one or too harsh on it. If you like mystery/thriller/horror mix this is it!",1429488000,,418,4.2375
8060567,3,B0009GVVOY,"The movie ""the Uncanny"" is three separate tales all on the evil psyche of cats tied together by a host played by Ray Milland.  The first two tales were acceptable with the third being the best.  The principal players in tale # 3 were Samantha Eggar and Donald Pleasance of ""Halloween"" fame.  Samantha Eggar gives a good performance as does Donald Pleasance.  Samantha is a very underrated actress and she was a very stunning looking woman back in the 1970's.  It is not the best but still worth purchasing.",1401321600,,506,4.640449438202247
8060568,5,B0009GVVOY,"I am a big horror movie fan and as a kid I grew up watching many Peter Cushing horror movies. I decided to revisit some of his best horror movies and search for the rare ones I haven't seen. This was an awesome little anthology of horror tales. Cushing has not too much screem time as he is involved in telling the tales and not being in them.

  Cushing plays Wilbur Gray, a horror writer, who has stumbled upon a terrible secret, that cats are supernatural creatures who really call the shots. In a desperate attempt to get others to believe him, Wilbur spews three tales of feline horror. Cushing tells his publisher Ray Millard( Old horror friend from Dial M For Murder) about the tales and how important it is for him to publish the tales. Even though like I said Cushing isn't in the movie for a ton of time he has some great memorable parts. He does a good job acting terrified every time he see's a cat.

  The first tale is about a woman who leaves her great fortune to her cats because her family doesn't really care for her and only out to get her money. If they took better care of her maybe she would have left them the money but I thought the cats were just as deserving as anyone since they comforted her. Nevertheless her nephew and the servant girl who are romantically involved plot a way to get their hands on the fortune. They don't count on the cats. They don't want to part with the money so easily. It was a nice tale not my favorite in the bunch.

  The second tale was my favorite. It was awesome. Lucy's parents die in a plane crash and she goes to live with her Aunt. She brings along her cat Wellington. Her Aunt comes across as a heartless and terrible person as she is mean to Lucy. Her Aunt is a saint compared to Lucy's cousin Angela. Angela is bigger than Lucy and older. Angela is a textbook spoiled jealous child and insecure bully who terrorizes poor Lucy. She makes messes and lies to her mom saying Wellington or Lucy did it. It leads to Lucy's Aunt to telling her husband to get rid of Wellington and put him to sleep. Nice lady right? Even worse Angela taunts and terrorizes Lucy telling her how Wellington was put to sleep. Nevertheless Wellington escapes and finds Lucy again. Together they plot their revenge on the evil family. I won't give it away how it ends but it was good. It's my favorite tale of the three.

  The third tale is about a actor who bumps off his wife who is an actress in the movie by using a real blade instead of a rubber one. The Great Donald Pleasence plays the actor and after watching this tale you realize what a great actor he was and how perfect he was for horror. Pleasence has a young actress he is having an affair with who takes over the role of his wife in the movie. His wife had a cat and once the cats overhears Pleasence and the actress gloating over bumping off his wife the cat plans to avenge his beloved owner's death. It's a great tale.

  Ray Millard and Peter Cushing close out the movie in a great chilling ending with some cats. I know Peter Cushing must have loved this ending. Cushing was a great actor and he could have stepped outside the horror genre more frequently but he was a gift to the genre. He made many average b horror films entertaining with his great performances. I think it's a crime this movie isn't on dvd but you can still get it on vhs. I recommend this movie to all true horror movie fans and new fans. It was one of Cushing's better horror movies and not many know about. Cheers and enjoy!",1397347200,5,3506,4.2749244712990935
8060569,3,B0009GVVOY,"This is one Horror Anthology that seems to be the weakest for me. The powerful Amicus days were gone and STAR WARS put an end to so many genres of films that people don't realize. Everyone wanted to copy space crap in the late 70's. It was good to be able to have access to the DVD and convert it to American Standards so it would play on our equipment. Cushing and Milland are great to see but not nearly enough to substantiate these subpar stories. I don't like cats. I was nearly mauled by one when I was a kid just laying on our bed. Just hearing their moans and cries sends shivers down my spine. That unfortunately was the scariest part for me.

So it's all about opinion, which you may find totally different than mine. **SPOILERS** Wraparound begins with Milland listening to Cushing about some TRUE3 story ideas involving cats no less. A story about a woman trying to fetch a will and is locked in and surrounded by these varmits. A little bloody and some gore. The 70's paint style blood but use your imagination like I did and it won't hurt as bad. Then a girl gets some teasing after moving in with her relatives after her parents die and uses witchcraft to fight back by shrinking her bullying cousin and then we have the usual Hollywood cheating man scenario fooling around with another woman so he cleverly bumps off his wife during a pendulum scene and a cat cleverly bumps off his lover on the same film set. There was ONE time that I smiled and that was when the end of the third story revealed a cat's meal when John Vernon arrives. So that is why I rated it ""IT'S OKAY"" 3 Stars. A Matter of taste. The wraparound story ending has Cushing getting the most pussy he's ever had in his life. BTW, I suck at writing reviews. I'll keep it for love of seeing Cushing in a film that's hard to find.",1385251200,5,1810,4.30791788856305
8060570,5,B0009GVVOY,"THE UNCANNY is a fantastic horror anthology starring genre icons Peter Cushing, Ray Milland, Donald Pleasance, and Samantha Eggar. It involves three tales of terror, w/ a wrap-around story. All stories concern housecats and their wicked plots against humanity. Are we not entitled to see / hear the truth? Seriously, the fact that it is 2010 and I'm writing a VHS tape review is a crying shame! Soon, even discs will be extinct! What's the problem??...",1281398400,3,452,4.9605263157894735
8060571,5,B0009GVVOY,"THE UNCANNY has never been released on an ""official"" DVD in the US. The only reason I can come up w/ for this ""oversight"", is that the powers-that-be don't want the truth about eeevil felines to be told! In the film, Peter Cushing (THE CREEPING FLESH, HORROR EXPRESS, TALES FROM THE CRYPT, HORROR OF DRACULA) tries to convince Ray Milland (X:THE MAN WITH THE X-RAY EYES, THE PREMATURE BURIAL, FROGS, THE ATTIC) of the kitty population's nefarious plans for world domination. Milland is skeptical, even after Cushing's 3 tales of cat horror! In the first story, A wicked, disinherited nephew and his Aunt's maid attempt to destroy her will. Things go horribly awry, and Auntie's houseful of cats prove to be quite formidable and lethal! In the second tale, a little girl and her kitty named Wellington must live w/ her Aunt after losing her parents in an accident. Things don't go well, as the Aunt is very cold, and has a severely bratty daughter and a useless husband. She also hates Wellington! The little girl has a surprise for everyone, especially her nasty cousin! You see, this story involves witchcraft, revenge, and of course, Wellington! In story number three, Donald Pleasance (FLESH FOR FIENDS, HALLOWEEN 1 and 2, ALONE IN THE DARK) is a hammy actor who bumps off his co-star / wife in order to replace her w/ his girlfriend, played by Samantha Eggar (A NAME FOR EVIL, DEMONOID, THE BROOD). Unfortunately, the scheming couple must contend w/ wifey's cat, who is much smarter than either of his human antagonists! Things wrap up w/ the feline-induced fates of Cushing and Milland. THE UNCANNY must be relased on DVD! The awful truth must be told!...",1281398400,6,1660,4.8076923076923075
