6361852,4,B00JJNLQW0,"A new look into the exciting lives, well for viewers anyway, how the adrenaline junkies of the Pararescuemen are both special forces soldiers and medics at the same time. Through a new emergence of vidio technology we can see the human aspects of the soldiers as one calls his wife to find out the gender of his baby.",1430524800,,317,4.482758620689655

6361854,5,B00JJNLQW0,My brother is in this film.  I was the first time I saw him in action.  Absolutely inspiring the dedication these soldiers and Airman have to our country.  I really need to stop complaining about my desk job after see this movie.,1420502400,3,229,4.404761904761905

6361858,5,B00JJNLQW0,"Great series by NG.  More of the mmd-set of prepping and enacting what you've trained for, putting others first, ahead of you.  ""To bear more than you think you can bear, is really to bear"" - Book of Bushido, the Way of the Warrior",1412640000,,231,4.2272727272727275
6361859,1,B00JJNLQW0,"Terrible. This movie I thought would be more of the original series ""Inside Combat Rescue"" which was Incredible footage of PJ's work in Afghanistan. This Movie, Inside Combat Rescue- ""The last stand"" was silly. It was more focused on the Airforce ""Security Forces"" (The airforce version of military police) attempting to track down a ""High Value Individual"". Through the entire movie, I got the feeling that National Geographic had been baited in for footage of an incredible ""manhunt"" that would take place. This never happened. Instead the entire movie is spent trying to create suspense to an operation that never really took place. In the very end, when the Security Forces FINALLY catch thier man (he arrives to a Key Leader Engagement on a moped) he is verbally reprimanded and let of with a warning. (???) I am a combat veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan (6 tours) and in my honest oppinion, this is neither a documentary nor entertaining to watch. It was very painfull to watch and I was angry that I had purchased it.",1411430400,15,1028,4.813559322033898

8651317,5,B00JJNLQW0,"Awesome video.  Especially for those of us who were working in the East.  Halfway through, they respond to a Complex attack at Pinnacle- North Gate.  That was our transition base, where we came in and out of the AO.  They called it a ""hotel"", a Motel 6 with concrete walls and armed guards in towers.  Anyway, on July 2 2013, a jingle truck rolled up, loaded down with 10,000kilos of HME at 0430 in the morning and when it blew, it left a crater 40ft around and 20ft deep.
When the birds make a second trip out there, they are getting a good friend.  I'll make it easy for you, he wasn't an Afghan, but he is wearing Merrills.  Damn good man, the bullet stopped a millimeter from paralyzing him for life. The tip of the 7.62mm round was in his spinal cord.  They kind of forgot about him, and thank God that these awesome brace group of professional soldiers, who did the right things at the right time.
Little did I know that almost a year later, June 23, 2014 another group of professionals would come to extract me in Gardez.  I got tangled up in an ""Insider Attack"".  A
That day at 10;45am, a 6year veteran Afghan Police Officer, after being threatened by the Taliban that they would kill his family, decided to open fire on me and two other soldiers.  Cowards.  Watch this tape, see how they think and act.  This is what is coming to America.  This Afghan Police Officer knew he was not going to live, hell we were 30 meters from our MRAPs, 4 of them, each with a belt fed weapon from a .50 down to a SAW.  This is what those who went outside of the wire, and fought - some daily, are saying about these middle eastern Muslims coming into our country. There is NO TRUE WAY TO VET THEM.  They are like a lightnswitch, on and off.  During the ""Fighting Season"", which is when the snow melts, the farmers farm, then they lay down their farm tools and pick up their AKs.  They facilitate the enemy with the hiding of guns and explosives in old, dried up wells.  Then around November, the farmers put up their AKs and go back to farming duties.  How do you VET that?

Some people are pissing and meaning because this one doesn't follow the PJs.  Yeah, I'll give it to you, those young men are the best.  Absolutely badass, balls to the walls tough.  But this side of the war needed to be told as well. Since the war kicked off, by 2013 over 1,500 civilian contractors had been killed in Afghanistan.  This includes guys who weren't gun bangers.  And it doesn't include the 3 we lost on 22 August 2015, or the van load of Nepoliese American Embassy Guards this summer.

It's a brave new world my friends.",1474416000,,2603,4.31340206185567
