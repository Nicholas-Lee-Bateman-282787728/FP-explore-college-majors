331383,5,6301413075,I have been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD.  This is one of the most accurate and entertaining movies on the Wright Brothers that has ever been produced.,1364428800,,164,4.290322580645161
331384,5,6301413075,"The Wright's did not invent the wind tunnel, but they brilliantly adapted it to work through problems they were trying to solve.  They didn't invent hard work or trial by error as engineering tools,  but those elements were comfortably included in their whatever-might-work philosophy.

Traverse stability maintained by ""wing warping,"" the technical predecessor to ailerons is not on a par with Gutenburg's movable type in terms of advancing the condition of humankind, but for a couple of bicycle shop proprietors, their success in the midst of formidible competition put them at the center of their era.

Founding fathers of the age of technical revolution.  As important to their time as faces on the money from that earlier revolution.  I suppose we should be glad we do not have their sourpusses on our dough.

Their's is a story of courage, triumph and bureaucracy made complicated by the driest personalities immaginable.  Neither would be likely to have ever told a dirty joke or swiped a candy bar as a kid. Lively characters like Huckleberry, the hookie playing, cornsilk smoker would cause readers to wearily dismiss the likes of Orville and Wilbur.

Yet their demeanors were perfect for their time and place, the age of engineering, and this made for TVflick is a wonderful example of bending history for the sake of a tale.  As a boy I was faced with separating the actual George Washington from Parson Weem's fanciful tales.  The story of the dour Wright's required a Weems.  and this movie provides a treasure trove of ancient visual footage of the Kitty Hawk doings mixed with Weemishlike docudrama stuff .

As historical entertainment, created more for popular consumption than history, this movie is certainly worth watching and perhaps owning.  You simply have to remember to read something beyond this movie if an accurate account of how the heavier than air machine got off the ground is your goal.

331388,4,6301413075,"Here's another film that still hasn't come out on DVD that I would love to see in that format. Few people, I gather, have seen this in any format since my review is only the second here at Amazon even though the movie was made over 30 years ago.

It's not a great movie but it has a dream-like look and feel to it, which is why a good DVD transfer could give it justice. It's a nice, clean movie with no profanity or blood and an interesting story of the Wright Brothers struggling to build their first airplane and then keep their famous plans and ideas from being stolen by others. There is a lot of justified paranoia in here.

Oddly, if I didn't know it was Michael Morarity, I would have thought this was some rookie actor who couldn't put any inflection into his lines, but maybe his ""Wilbur Wright"" character is supposed to be this ultra low-key. Nonetheless, Moriarty sounded very wooden, but now I am informed that's how Wilbur was, which I'm glad to hear since I like Moriarity.

The movie also drags a bit here and there, but overall I am still glad I own the VHS because it's a really nice film and a worthy addition to any collection.",1243728000,6,1147,4.325581395348837

Although I found the movie enlightening it glossed over one the most important moments in aviation history, which was the first four flight attempts by the Wright Brothers.  In fact, there was a brief mention, but nothing more.

The movie brilliantly recreated the flying machines used by Orville & Wilbur Wright.  It also gave a real sense of what Kitty Hawk might have been like back in the early 1900's.  We tend to forget how much controversy they had to endure to accomplish their lifelong goals.

331574,3,6301413075,"Overall, a good study of the Wrights.  The video quality wasn't as good as it deserved.  The movie, as most stories of the brothers tends to undersell Orville's role in the project.  Wilbur was the driving force, but would never have come close to achieving flight without his brother.  But, overall, the film was worth watching.",1398902400,,329,4.821428571428571
331575,3,6301413075,"There were two main reasons the Wright Brothers were successful in inventing the airplane.  First, they realized that flight meant the solving of many highly technical engineering problems, and the main problem early on was lift, and then later control.  Second, and this is critical, they realized as ex-bicycle racers that they would have to learn to fly.
They tackled the first problem with a systematic and scientific approach that is still marvelled at today.  They only built three gliders before finally building the 1903 Flyer, but each glider was built and tested based on data, facts, experimentation, and calculation.  When they didn't get the results predicted by the Lilinthal Tables, they built a wind tunnel and created the first lift tables that would produce a real airplane.  Perhaps their most amazing invention was the airplane propeller.  Yes, you heard me right, because in 1903 nobody knew what an airplane propeller looked like, and everyone else got it wrong.  The Wrights realized that a propeller was a wing, and so used their lift tables to produce them.  In the end they solved the lift problem, the control problem, and the power problem, all the time realizing that they didn't know how to pilot an airplane.
And then the second problem: they didn't know how to fly.  They made many glider flights, but each one was only seconds in the air, and on each flight they needed to ask the same question: ""Did we crash because something was wrong with the glider, or did we crash because we don't know how to fly?""
After Kill Devil Hills, they spent four years in Dayton perfecting their invention, but it was almost too long.  While the Wrights were perfecting their elegant and graceful flying machines with 25 HP engines, others were strapping on 100 and 200 HP engines onto defective airframes.  Problem is, a barn door will fly with enough power, and the competition also now knew flight was possible, which is a big motivator.  While the Wrights were waiting in Dayton for a signed contract for an airplane not many people had seen, inventors all over the world were building airplanes based on what they knew about the work of the Wright Brothers.  And ironically, the Curtis designed aircraft were better than the Wrights in many ways; they used ailerons instead of wing warping; they had wheels; and he moved the elevator to the rear of the airframe, a feature Orvil begged Wilber to do with their designs.  Lewis Dermot from France built advanced airplanes that resembled the planes of WWI, still eight years away, and in 1909 flew across the English Channel.  In any case, while the Wrights had solved all the scientific difficulties of flight, they almost missed the point.  The point being that once the world knew for certain that flight was possible, the considerable resources and talents of that industrial age would rapidly catch up.  And the world caught up fast, bogging them down in years of patent infringement cases as they watched the technology of flight pass them by.
I think the movie should have ended with a DC-3 landing at the Dayton airport in 1938, which illustrates just how fast aviation caught up after Wilbur and Orville's first flights of 1903.",1396656000,,3205,4.851376146788991
331576,5,6301413075,"Possibly the most complete movie made about the Wright brothers.  I have 5 different DVDs claiming to cover this important American story. The Winds of Kitty Hawk hits all the marks, the history before them, their trials and tribulations along with proper mention of their mentors, sponsors and family's support.  Every one of these factors led to the first powered aircraft.  In true American spirit, Wilbur and Orville, after success eluded them and other contemporaries, had the audacity to question the existing engineering data.
Each of these brothers had their individual strengths to bring to their common goal of manned flight sparked by reading a science periodical of their day.  How many young inventive minds have been launched by this chance method. How many parents have chuckled over their child's fascination over a periodical with a glossy cover.  Michael Moriarty portrays Wilbur's undaunted spirit  and David Huffman gives life to Orville's insightful intellect.

As the drama unfolded, it seemed to follow the historical events, but didn't reveal much about the Wright Bros. and family's characters. What saved the film for me were the film locations evocative of Kill Devil Hills and the full-size replica kites and aircraft which were quite well done. The limited number of special effects were not perfect, but believable, with the exception of the U.S. Army demonstration flight crash which was not edited well and looked clumsy. The close-ups and footage that captured the feel of real flying were good and provided a certain built-in suspense.

Don't know if it was mentioned here but this was filmed at Pismo Beach, CA for Kitty Hawk...as well as areas around Paso Robles/San Luis Obispo ...Many scenes have mountains and rolling hills with CA coastal oak trees EVERYWHERE and there were a few scenes in fact with eucalyptus trees which are common in CA imported from Australia the start of the 20th Century...

A Washington Post review is quite good and mentions Pismo Beach.

 You can plainly see in many scenes a large hill/mountain in the background of Kitty Hawk which is the Guadalupe Sand Dunes to the SW of the city of Santa Maria, CA and not far from Vandenberg AFB.",1486166400,,682,4.520325203252033
