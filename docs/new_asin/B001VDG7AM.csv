8346040,5,B001VDG7AM,"22 year old Satou is a NEET, and a hikkikomori. He never leaves the house. He just sits around drinking beer, smoking, and watching TV. On top of all this he is also delusional. He convinces himself that a group called the NHK (Nihon Hikkikomori Kyoukai) is out to get him and turn the entire country into NEETs. One day a pretty high school girl named Misaki visits him and offers to give him counseling to cure his hikkikomori condition. The 2 become closer and begin to rely on each other. As their relationship strengthens Satou is able to venture out and do things on his own. Lot's of drama and comedy ensue.

This anime is completely different from anything I've ever seen. It dark and methodical vibe are complemented by the main characters hilarious paranoia and perverted imagination. The production is top notch. Animation and music are all very good. It also stars 2 of my favorite voice actors, Chris Patton and Luci Christian. Given Satou's perverted imagination, this anime isn't for young viewers. But if you're older and want to laugh a lot and want to see a interesting romantic comedy then this anime will probably make you very happy.",1354924800,,1154,4.712871287128713

8346043,5,B001VDG7AM,"Yes, there really is a vol. 6, 6th Conspiracy, Welcome to the NHK DVD. It was produced by Funimation, not ADV as they lost the contract or something, and only sold by two online retailers, TRS being one of them. This item was never offered in retail stores, only online. It is one of the rarest DVDs out there and key to aquireing a full set of this anime series. Almost impossable to find in factory sealed,or any other condition, but, very real nonetheless.",1269734400,12,459,4.476190476190476
