8437144,5,B004ODLUI0,"The sisterhood is called upon to save the empire once again.  When the emperor's greatest general is accused of treason, she is given a potion by the head of the eunichs to turn her into a cat. she seeks them out with the help of a helpful doctor who is still searching for the Crucial Keys.  in order to turn her back, and stop the evil plot of the eunichs (after all, this is all they can do given their ""circumstances"") the group spilts up and is off to get three rare ingredients.  AS they journey, they meet new people, make new friends and see some new people in a new light (or at least without clothes).

This season is a little more raunchy, uping the ecchi level a bit more but not near the line between ecchi and hentai, but still full of the normal hijinks that you expect.  and even though there are more people added to the cast, it just adds to the enjoyement and does not take anything away from the story.  MAny favorites are only mentioned, but they appear in the final episodes.  If you liked the others, you will love this one.  I wonder if there is a fourth season, I sure hope so.",1307750400,7,1102,4.214285714285714
