Scientists and crew from around the world are arrivingfor our annual research voyage [by icebreaker] to Antarctica.  We have to quickly pack enough food and science equipment for [four] weeks at sea.

We are heading to the fastest warming place on Earth: the West Antarctic Peninsula, which has experienced a winter temperature increase of eleven degrees Fahrenheit over the last fifty years.  Thats six times faster than the average global warming.

The above comes from this extraordinary documentary which follows a team of scientists (oceanographers, seabird ecologists, marine biologists, etc.) as they explore the West Antarctic Peninsula.  They want to understand climate change in this place: the fastest warming place on Earth.

Just before the voyage, we are told of the calculated risks these scientists and researchers are taking by undertaking this task (like encountering 60-foot waves and hulking icebergs).  Then weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 of their research voyage are shown in spectacular detail.  We are introduced to the arsenal of cutting-edge technology that these scientists use (that will probably revolutionize how climate change is studied).

We are also informed of the plight of the penguins.  Specifically, Adelie penguins are studied intensively during this voyage.  (Adelie penguins conservation status: near threatened.)

The final destination of this voyage, as this documentarys sub-title tells us, is at latitude 70 degrees south.  Not mentioned is the final destinations longitude of 75 degrees west.  These coordinates reveal the location of Charcot Island, a rugged and inhospitable place that lies off the peninsula.  Adelie penguins live there in a true sea-ice climate.

The cinematography is breath-taking.  Besides the landscapes, youll see animals such as whales, penguins, and seals.  Also, I found the animation to be quite instructive.

You may be surprised to learn that the actual voyage does not start until about fifteen minutes into this film.  Thats because climate change information is given and dramatic images are shown.  I found this to be an effective prelude to the actual voyage.

Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2015) has five extras.  All of them are brief and interesting.  From these extras, I learned that this film was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation and the Rutgers School of Environmental & Biological Sciences.  (Rutgers is the State University of New Jersey.)  As well, over 400 hours of raw footage was edited down to make this film.

In conclusion, this is a mind-boggling and important documentary providing us with conclusive evidence of how melting ice affects climate across the entire planet!!

Well, have a look and you will be out of breath.
It will wake you up in how your are living and impacting the earth!
Fantastic work by students, professor, scientists and sponsors.
16 students and professor spent 60 days on the US Science Center and boat at the Antarctic filming and highlighting the work of scientists under extreme challenging conditions. Highlighting the tools scientists are using.
The conclusion....... You will be the judge.",1454630400,,585,5.168421052631579

8716381,5,B00XO3PF5U,"I spent more than a year at Palmer Station in 1972 & 1973.  This is the first video I have seen that allowed me to revisit many of the places I spent time in back then aboard the Research Vessel Hero.  The reduction in penguin populations and increase in brash ice from glacier calving is astonishing to me as compared to what I experienced back then.  The quality of the video is superb, the graphics, CGI and animation is clear and not overdone.  The focus on the science is a welcome change from the adventure-oriented videos that are common today.  I was especially impressed with the editing and the audio quality.  When the audio was unclear or indecipherable, the audio was captioned clearly and cleanly.

The cinematography was stunning and often dangerously original.  Did they hang a camera over the side of the Gould while moving through the water at 10 knots?  I couldn't figure out how they did some of the shots, given the treacherous waters, ice, and terrain.  There is some terrific camera work in this video.  Even the action shots on deck were beautifully framed and timed to get the most out of the interviews they did with the crew and scientists.  Some of the shots were with helmet cams, some under water that must have been below freezing.

Carbon cycling by sea creatures (krill and phytoplankton) was an important element of the science of the video.  I enjoyed seeing the nitty-gritty of the science of collecting the data to assess this important part of the Antarctic ecosystem.  Even non-scientists should come away from this video with a greater appreciation of the dedication, talent, and knowledge of the oceanographers who are trying to understand how climate change is being affected at this level.

A previous reviewer (Perthy) complained about the audio -- especially the bass overwhelming the narration.  I have a high quality sound system that I assembled from disparate components, and I found the sound to be theater quality throughout.  It probably won't sound good on the tiny built-in speakers that most HDTVs come with. I find watching almost ANYTHING annoying on those systems.  If you have problems hearing the audio, as Perthy did, then try using some good headphones.

I highly recommend this video and can say from experience that it is just about as close to being there as one can be without actually being there.  The overwhelming ammonia-and-poop odors of a penguin rookery or the smell of the Antarctic seas are some of the elements that this video cannot reproduce.  It is well worth the watching.",1441238400,2,2552,4.8452655889145495
8716382,3,B00XO3PF5U,"The heavy, extraneous noises throughout the soundtrack makes this un-watchable as far as I am concerned.

In order to hear the narration, one must  endure lots of  horrible noise, much of it in the form of powerful bass or percussive notes. It sounds like someone with untreated ADHD got hold of a drum machine for this one, and tried everything as loud as it would go.

This same kind of treatment of documentary soundtracks is a real problem and is ultimately self-defeating for the movie makers.

Otherwise, it's an interesting film, butjust  I can't stand the audio, sorry.",1439251200,,577,4.836734693877551
