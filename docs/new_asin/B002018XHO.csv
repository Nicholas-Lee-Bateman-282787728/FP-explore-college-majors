8348391,4,B002018XHO,"About the Movie itself:
This is a terrible movie, make no mistake! However, you have to give it a chance. You can't truly appreciate it until you watch it a 2nd time. I put it in the Cult Classic category with Rocky Horror, Holy Grail, Blazing Saddles, Spaceballs, ETC. Fantastically awful, but keeps getting funnier every time you see it. Nudist Colony of the Dead is vulgar, punny, offensive, inappropriate, and just plain WRONG on all levels (I love it)!

About this DVD release:
Oh boy... I've owned NCotD on VHS for 15 years, and I've watched it more times than I can even guess. This DVD is a remastered version of the movie. Unfortunately, since I've practically memorized the movie's original version, I find the remastered version really distracting. (This is why I dropped my rating from 5 to 4 Stars.)
Many scenes were re-edited with videotape footage causing noticeable differences in brightness and color between edits. A few sight gags are missing because of this. One of my favorite jokes in the whole movie (""This sucks worse than my ex-wife."" followed by another man saying ""That's for sure..."") was replaced with a boring ethnic slam. There are a few scenes where the playback speed was altered (Juan running from the car) to make it look faster, but the effect looked really corny, like as if it were from the Benny Hill Show. The ""We're All Gonna Die"" song was altered to death... new beginning, new ending, and a whole chunk was removed from the middle with an edit that was so bad that even someone who never saw the movie before would notice something was missing.
The special features were fun, and I did enjoy the new opening title sequence. I just wish they hadn't gotten all crazy with the remaster, or at least offered the movie in its uncut original version as a bonus disk, or something. I'm really tempted to have my old VHS tape copied to DVD since this new version of the movie was not what I was expecting.

***Also, for some reason Amazon does not recognize this product as a DVD, therefore charging the significantly higher bulk merchandise shipping fee rather than the standard Media shipping fee.***",1279670400,10,2137,4.711229946524064
