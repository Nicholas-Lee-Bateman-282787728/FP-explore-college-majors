Then it starts and you know it is home made by a man standing in a kitchen from the 70's.....  :)  I LOVE IT..  I watched it twice!  It might be a man but he knows his bread and he breaks it down step by step.  He is at ease with the camera and it's like you are on the other side  counter watching.  It is not fancy, the kitchen is not a ""professional""  kitchen... He goes into great detail on how to make a simple loaf of bread.  No matter what your skill level is I would watch it.  Sometimes it is the simple things we forget that made a huge difference!!  I am no longer scared of making a loaf of bread  LOL  :)",1434153600,,747,3.7532467532467533
