The French speakers don't speak English very well, the animation is corny, they use very complex and obscure sentences and translate them into French (""Ten kitty cats play in the pot; some wear hats and some do not,"" ""Sixteen baby lions are learning to speak; they try to roar but only squeak"" - there's no way kids will pick up the quickly spoken translations of these!), the puppets are poorly made and their ""lips"" don't match what is being said.  They even misspell the French word for two (""duex"" instead of ""deux""). Don't waste your money!",1338163200,,571,4.653465346534653
8290273,1,B0001B50K8,During #10 an older boy gropes a young girl's chest.  Then the other boy does the same thing to the point that the girl has to move his hand away.  I had to rewind it several times to make sure I wasn't seeing things!,1233964800,2,217,3.909090909090909
