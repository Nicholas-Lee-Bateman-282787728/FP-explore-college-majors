1898230,2,B00009Y3RY,"Redline was supposed to be a high octane action/drama movie with a suspense topping plot including hot cars and add Chad Mcqueen (the infamous Steve Mcqueen's son), and this sounds like a hot movie right? Wrong! This movie has a very bad storyline which honestly doesn't have you holding your breath at any given time during the flick, the acting leaves much to be desired including Chad's on screen presense which is nowhere near the caliber of actor his father was, and even the car chase scenes are so flat and slow between the Jaguar XJS and Chad Mcqueen's Highland green fastback Mustang. A cheesy movie which i consider along the lines of ""Overdrive"", ""Banzai Runner"" and other b-rated car movies. Now i am a sucker for b movies, but this one truly was completely boring and makes you wonder if it was even unscripted during filming. Nice try Chad, but no cigar.",1078963200,2,868,4.6797385620915035

7994414,4,B00009Y3RY,"I was fascinated and deeply moved by this extraordinary work of music drama.  The power of the depressing story, and the power of the music used to tell it, made a strong impression on me.  This was terrific theater!!

I am totally unfamiliar with Finnish opera, so I came into this work with very little knowledge of it or the composer.  My usual sources had minimal information. But to Ondine's credit, the booklet contained in the dvd was very informative.  It gave much-needed background on the work, its literary source, its performance history, and even musical analysis.  This was perhaps the best booklet I've seen in an opera dvd set!

The story, based on a famous Finnish novel, is about the first public election in Finland's history in 1907. The opera itself, focuses on a family in rural Finland.  Topi and his wife, Riika, live with their children in the harsh colder climes, beset by bad weather, hunger, and the elements (like the bear that, in the end, kills Topi).  They just manage to get by.  But they learn of the first real election, and, along with their neighbors, are confronted with political speakers- the communist agitator, and the Church spokesman, as well as their neighbor Kaisa, who speaks a grounded, rural truth.  They are unable really to understand these political forces, but hope for a better life.  After the election, suddenly, their children fall very ill and quietly die.  (Though the cause of death is not explicitly stated, I interpreted it to be that they died of starvation.) After their death, there is a long musical interlude as they prepare for the funeral of the children that, for me, was the highlight of the work.  In the end, at a loss after their death, Topi again chases the bear and is killed by it.

Jorma Hynninen is excellent as Topi.  This is a signature role for him as he originated it in the first production in 1978 (and even took it to the Met!), and has performed it many times.  He apparently has also done most other of the Sallinen operas.  He is excellent, with a face that is just worn down by life's travails.  Paivi Nisula is also excellent as Riika, the suffering wife/mother.  In fact, all performers were excellent.

One thing to note in the production is the presence of ""dancers"" throughout the staging.  They appear as ""zombies"" moving in and out of the action.  It doesn't do anything for me,. But doesn't interfere with the story-telling.  (Still, I'm not into zombies at all.)

The dvd is well produced- excellent filming and sound, and 40 minutes or so of interviews with Hynninen, conductor, composer and director, (but not a ""making of"" short).

For my first foray into Finnish opera, this was a real delight, and very moving.  Don't miss it.",1361059200,2,2730,4.716701902748414
7994415,5,B00009Y3RY,"I have to say, I have seen so many movies with this similar/same title that this really made me do the 'really?' eyebrow raise. But, I have to say for yet another rendition of a 'car movie', it's actually pretty well portrayed. Chock another one up for my Feldman collection, I give it a good thumbs up!",1360972800,,303,4.333333333333333
7994416,3,B00009Y3RY,"the best thing I can say about this movie is , the young lady has great tits, and whats with jan-michiel vincents lip ????  the car chases, very boring, and you can see that they changed cars , the mustang looked like it had no damage after being run into by the jag, even the door opened with no problem.",1340064000,,305,4.083333333333333
7994417,5,B00009Y3RY,"This is the only commercially available DVD I know of, although the Opera premiered more than 30 years ago and had many productions in Finland and elsewhere. The plot could be seen has a political oriented one, although I found that it is more geared to the human struggle for change and the tragedy that sometimes it entails. Topi, Rikka and their neighbors struggle between the change promised by the Reds and the status quo and the guilt imposed by the Church. It leads to the tragic death of the kids. On the other hand, some things stay the same, the bear is still there. It kills the sheep at the beginning and, at the end, kills Topi. The Reds or the Church are totally irrelevant.
The pamphlet included with the DVD gives ample explanations on the plot, its source and the composer. Regrettably doesn't mention the director's realization of the plot, which is very interesting, although sometimes it is not easy to understand at first glance the symbolism the director introduced. Sallinen's music is poignant and works extremely well with the plot. I wouldn't say the opera is enjoyable, since the grim plot is nothing to be ""enjoyed"" but the message is there and it is a captivating and powerful one.
Don't miss the interviews in the extras. They certainly help for a much deeper understanding of this production. Having such a description in the pamphlet would have been very helpful.  Strongly recommended",1325289600,2,1417,4.807377049180328
7994418,5,B00009Y3RY,"I love Sallinen's music and this opera in particular. I attended the opening night of the revival in 2007 on which this recording is based. An earlier recording of a Finnish TV broadcast exists privately,(no subtitles), but this new production is very much better. The staging is very clever and the singing just magnificent. Hannu Forsberg as the Pedlar, Simana Arhippaini, was not mentioned in the other, (quite excellent), review of this disc and is outstanding. It is really time to get all Sallinen's 6 operas on video and in this day and age it should be Blu-ray. He is surely the most outstanding living writer of opera and this ommission is a huge loss to music. Like all great composers, Sallinen writes with his own signature and his music is instantly recognisable even if you have not heard that piece before. His orchestration is somewhat like Shostakovich in that a huge range of instruments get a chance to shine in an original way, his music is tonal and easy on the ear whilst adding colour and expectation to the moment. If you like modern opera then treat yourself to this disc. A special thank you to Ondine - can we have more please!  The Palace (Palatsi) is also available in a very good, but 4:3, DVD and is most enjoyable. I attended that performance too and it is a wonderful memory of another great Sallinen night.",1297728000,6,1340,4.654008438818566
7994419,5,B00009Y3RY,"The new Ondine DVD performance of Finnish composer Aulis Sallinen's ""The Red Line"" is a gripping, disturbing work and brilliantly performed. The Finnish National Opera, conducted by Mikko Franck delivers a solid performance in this dark story of Finland's first Parliamentary election from 1907. Based on the novel of the same name, by native author Ilmari Kianto, the work shows one family's stoic, but sad existence at the time when Finland was first starting to break from Russian rule and also in an election marking the first time women anywhere in Europe were allowed to vote. Kianto is considered something of a revolutionary author in Finland and the opera libretto, also written by Sallinen, after the Kianto original, raises an interesting question: Is the narrative a commentary on pity to be shown for the poor of the Kainuu district or is it a sardonic view of that same poor who may seem so easily deluded into voting for ""the left""? In this story, the ""leftists"" (who cannot be fully trusted, as portrayed) are symbolized by a Bear (the connection to Russia's mascot is probably intentional). The bear terrorizes the small village in which the family of protagonist, Topi Rompannen, resides. As the story and sense of tragedy progresses, the bear hibernates, as in winter; the bear stirs a bit causing town dogs to bark; lastly, the bear awakens and creates havoc. The main character is brilliantly played with a sense of determination but a look a helplessness by the great Finnish baritone, Jorma Hynninen (who may also be seen in performances by countryman, Einouhani Rautavaara)  Written in 1978, the work propelled Sallinen into being seen as one of Europe's greatest opera composers, still held true for myself and many others. The music is strong, selectively dissonant and filled with an urgency and lament. The composer uses small motives as well as sections of authentic Finnish folk material as his building blocks. As the story progresses, Topi's wife, Riika (well played by Paivi Nisula) watches as her husband gets caught up in the fervor of the upcoming election and the rhetoric of the Finnish nationalist movement that promises much. Topi seems a somewhat naive father while Riika remains practical, determined, alert but a bit pessimistic. Also well performed is the role of Punterpaa, a socialist agitator. The performance by Aki Alamikkoterva is solid, exuding charm and the ""slick"" word that raise the unanswered question of Kianto's prose: who is being made fun of?  Ultimately, Riika is also taken in and extolls the promise of Socialism even as her own children grow ill from famine. Kaisa (sung by Anna-Lisa Jakobsson), a neighbor provides the continued pragmatism and skepticism that Topi and Riika have apparently lost. The opera's ending is tragic, but not explicit, and leaves the essential question unanswered: Do political promises create unintended victims or are citizens at fault for their naivete and deserve whatever comes of their idealism?  Excellent performances abound including the limited but touching children's roles. The FNO orchestra under Franck's direction performs superbly and Sallinen's palate is wide ranging and carries many emotions.",1287446400,17,3202,5.2015503875969
7994420,5,B00009Y3RY,"Let us start off by saying, Chad you've done it again.  First Death Ring, then Money To Burn, now Red Line.  Never has chain smoking and an attitude problem looked so damn good. McQueen was not only the star of the show, but he also co-produced this B classic! But who else could have pulled this off? A lesser man would have replaced an actor (Jan Michael-Vincent) who was merely weeks removed from facial reconstructive surgery. But Chad ignored quality and focused on creating lines that were barely audible. Were they unable to afford to hire another actor? Probably, since Sid has it on good authority that Jan-Michael Vincent will work for a cup of noodles, a warm can of Busch, and a fifth of Hack Daniels(the B version of Jack, found on every Chad McQueen set). Or maybe Chad had to pay Vincent back for a large gambling debt, or maybe he was just trying to cater to his biggest(OK, only) fan, Sid the Elf. So, to put it into perspective, you had a main character who you coundn't understand when he talked and couldn't look at when he was on screen. That's as B as it gets. This amazing feature coupled with the extremely perplexing plot makes Red Line very enjoyable as long as you're willing to abandon all logic and accept the foregone conclusion of sheer confusion during and after the film!",1180915200,,1304,4.54468085106383
