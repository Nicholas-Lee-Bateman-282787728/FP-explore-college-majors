8240005,5,B001138U7A,"Excellent concert. Good sound, excellent photography. Dana reminds us a lot of Janis. Lots of soul. Excellent blues artist. Will be buying a few of her CDs.",1381017600,,156,4.814814814814815
8240006,5,B001138U7A,"Simply put this rocks!  A major talent with a great set of pipes and a captivating delivery.  I've now bought the DVD as well as the live recording and enjoy them both immensely!  The ""unplugged"" renditions on the DVD also greatly add to the value and understanding of the music.  I'm only sorry it has taken me so long to find this artist.",1367280000,,340,4.349206349206349
8240007,4,B001138U7A,"Technically, not the greatest music DVD, but Dana and her band make it more than worthwhile. I await another concert video  from the Dana Fuchs Band. Great stuff!",1366156800,,162,4.785714285714286
8240008,5,B001138U7A,"I saw Dana Fuchs this summer '11 in Seattle. By the end of the first song, the microphone stand had been kicked over and she was on the floor singing from her knees. Picture if Robert Plant and Janis Joplin had a baby. This is Dana. How she sustains her energy I do not know. The Live From NYC DVD effectively captures this. On stage she exuded honesty and sincerity - not posturing. We have bought copies of this to give to friends, and they are all blown away. I agree 100% with everything said in the ""Outstanding"" review from 10/12/11. After the concert, a friend said ""That is by far the best concert I have ever been to"". She is our #1 favorite artist, and my wife plays her CDs all the time. Like Amanda Marshall, her live music translates better than her studio recordings (which are still great - it is just that she sets the bar at an unbelievable height.) This is a Must See DVD.",1319241600,7,890,4.272189349112426
8240009,5,B001138U7A,"If you haven't seen Dana Fuchs live this is a show you won't forget. I've played this concert for a number of people and everyone was blown away saying ""How come I've never heard of her"". Dana has a voice and stage presence that gives me goose bumps. Powerful singer often compared to Janis Joplin and though I'm a big Joplin fan I feel she takes the feel and style to lengths and dimensions that Janis never reached. Dana Fuchs played the character Sadie in the movie ""Across the Universe"" and exhibited her exquisite raw talent. Her music draws you in so that its one of the concerts that you hate to see come to an end. Dana is very popular in Europe but is quickly gaining popularity in the US.",1318377600,5,698,4.33587786259542
