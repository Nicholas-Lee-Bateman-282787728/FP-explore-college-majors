Trash animation, voice acting that is too fast to understand, and just a trash ripoff of Kung Fu Panda.

8298917,1,B001EN5I5E,"Another rip off by our friends from Video Brinquedo.
The animation is horrendous and the voice actors know it. Which explains the subpar acting.
The plot is loosely based on Kungfu Panda only nowhere near as creative.
I pity any child whose grandparents picked up this rubbish by mistake.
Watch it on youtube for free if you can't Video Brinquedo should not be rewarded for such a shameless rip-off of a superior film.",1477094400,,418,4.739726027397261
