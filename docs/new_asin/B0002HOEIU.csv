8028079,5,B0002HOEIU,"This anime is pretty good. The animation is good and so is the sound. There is no Japanese audio or subtitles, only English audio. Too bad the complete series was not put on dvd.",1386288000,,178,4.264705882352941
8028080,5,B0002HOEIU,"I love this show!  I loved the first series, so I thought I'd finally give the third series ago (since I've given up waiting for it to be released in my country), and I was definitely not disappointed!  It's probably not a good choice for the hardcore anime fan, but certainly a lot of fun for kids, and adults who enjoy all things dodgy - like me!",1343692800,,348,4.17910447761194
