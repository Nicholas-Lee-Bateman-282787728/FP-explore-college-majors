7802128,5,193880502X,"Who do you think you are? This question sounds like you are going to start a fight. But who are you wrestling with? ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" by Mark Driscoll is trying to answer just that.  Who are you? Are you a Dad? A son? A hard worker? A winner? A loser? Who are you?  How do you define yourself? You are wrestling with yourself and wrestling with God.  In this book Mark Driscoll uses the Bible to give believers a picture of who they really are and why they matter.  Driscoll goes head first into the book of Ephesians. And takes an in depth look at what you are made of and for what purpose.
After making the point that Ephesians is telling us that the book is geared towards telling us what, and who we are, he examines stories of people who have found their true identity in Christ.  The stories of people finding their identity are really impactful because it brings the book down to everyone's level, not just the theologians.  Many topics are discussed such as ""You are loved.  You are a saint.  You are justified.  You are redeemed.  You are Christ's.""
This book is easy to read, easy to understand and easily put together in a logical sense.  Couple this book with the study guide/group guide and the video guide and you have a complete set of references to help understand and dig deeper with the material.
My church went through this series and it went very well. I highly, highly recommend reading this book and to come into it with an open mind.  Christ wants you to find yourself in Him.  This book is for all people, at all levels in their faith.  It is helpful to everyone and I suggest you pick up a copy of the book, the study guide/devotional and the video.  Do it!
I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com  book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.
* To be honest, this review took a long time to read because I followed along with my Church family and didn't want to get ahead of the sermons being preached. - In fact, I took so long I had to get my Booksneeze account reinstated!",1371254400,,2117,4.348600508905853

I bought the dvd to supplement our weekly meetings. I'm sad to say that this dvd offers no real content that contributes to what we have already read from the book or from the sermons we attend (we attend Mars Hill services). It's also only every other chapter that there is a session and pastor Mark simply lays out what's coming. I also purchased the Real Marriage dvd too. Not expecting much from that now. So in sum: book is great, dvd not so much.",1360022400,2,607,4.109243697478991
