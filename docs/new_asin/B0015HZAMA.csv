8258742,4,B0015HZAMA,"'Love My Way' has received such glorious reviews. I have to admiti have had trouble watching this series. I don't want to say same old, same old, but it is.

The story revolves around two families. Living by the beach in a dilapidated house is Frankie Paige played by Claudia Karvan, her daughter Lou Jackson Paige, played by Alex Cook, and Tom Jackson , played by Brendan Cowell. Living in an expensive modern home, is Frankies ex-husband Charlie Jackson , played by Dan Wyllie, (brother to Tom and father to Lou, and his wife Julia Jackson, played by Asher Kiddle. There are parents to complicate the arrangements, and an assorted mix of boyfriends, girlfriends and work colleagues.

The episodes are hum drum, hooking up with work buddies, policemen who stop you for DUI, mom gets a married boyfriend, going into labor and dad is unreachable because he is out surfing, and on and on. I had difficulty finding some interest to view the entire series.

The series was filmed in 2004 in Australia, so maybe the 9 years has made the difference.

It is Okay. prisrob 09-13-13",1379030400,3,1073,4.721925133689839

Unlike most US shows, not all the characters are even likable, but they're real. I hope she creates a new series someday as I would snap it up.",1295136000,3,246,4.488888888888889
