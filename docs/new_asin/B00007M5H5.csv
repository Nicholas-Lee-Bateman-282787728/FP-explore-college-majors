7978334,5,B00007M5H5,"My granddaughter, who has recently been watching a ""baby show"" tape (her younger brother checked out of the library) -- repeatedly -- seemed extraordinarily interested in my unrelated description of several episodes of Arthur. She ever so casually kept redirecting the conversation back to the episode ""That's a Baby Show,"" to which she paid rapt attention.

I later learned she'd seriously been warned (by her mother) that choosing to wear a costume based upon the ""baby show"" character might lead to teasing. Although the sensitive child imagined she could ""excuse"" her interest by the interest of her younger brother, she apparently remained anxious. After hearing of the Arthur episode, the well-read child wrote her own ""chapter book"" story of a pair of twin sisters reluctantly becoming increasingly more interested in a younger brother's obsession with the show she had watched. Their resolution became her own, and she seemed much more at ease.

I recommend making specific Arthur episodes even easier to find, since several seem to be grouped together, with each group's being titled without a hint to its content. After extra research, I had the collection ""Arthur: Arthur Goes to Hollywood"" sent. It was well received and has been watched repeatedly, apparently adding nuance to her understanding of interactions (she has aspergers) and shared fun for her brother. There's nothing like feeling understood, even if by a cartoon character.",1255564800,,1448,5.291304347826087
7978335,5,B00007M5H5,My kids love Arthur and the episodes on this disk do not disappoint.,1154563200,,68,4.3076923076923075
7978336,5,B00007M5H5,"Our kids generally like Arthur to begin with, but these three episodes gave Marc Brown & his team an opportunity to flex their muscles in the realm of parody and satire.  The episode featuring ""Love Ducks,"" a bizarre & psychedelic baby show to which Arthur becomes addicted, is note-perfect in its parody & never fails to make me laugh out loud.  The other two episodes also deal with the themes of TV shows, some related to other PBS kids' shows, some to shows very much not associated with PBS, such as South Park.

As usual, the kids will enjoy them, but the parents should also find the satire to be more amusing than normal.",1137369600,2,629,4.5
7978337,5,B00007M5H5,"Well, it's not often you get three excellent shows on one video, but this video does it. First there's ""And Now Let's Talk to Some Kids"" in which we see much-talked about, only somewhat liked interstitital ""And Now a Word From Us Kids"" segment would be like on ""Arthur."" The ""Magic Toolbox"" comes to Elwood City to film ""real kids"" and Mr. Ratburn's class is chosen. They nearly lock up, until an unlikely hero saves the show. This one was all right. There's been complaints that the parodying of ""Arthur"" itself on this is a sort of ""familiarity breeding contempt"" but I think the concept is rather funny.
""The Contest"" is the winner from the contest where ""Arthur"" viewers were asked to send ideas for a show. In an interesting twist, the show itself is about Arthur and his pals trying to enter a contest to create a show for the ""Andy and Company Show."" This episode is interesting in that we get to see the ""Arthur"" characters as teenagers, and after the show the ""interstitial"" is included, featuring a day in the life of Holly Holland, the winner of the actual contest.
Finally, there's ""That's a Baby Show!"" Arthur's friends want him to watch the ""Dark Bunny"" but he ends up hiding that he's been seduced by another show in the same time slot: the ""Love Ducks."" Here's ammunition for any older ""Arthur"" fans that feel the need to be in hiding. The ""Love Ducks"" is quite well done, and we also get to see the credits for ""Mary Moo-Cow."" If you can pause your VCR, watch these, they're funny!",990316800,2,1498,4.531365313653136
