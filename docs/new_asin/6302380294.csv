462595,4,6302380294,"It is hard to analyze this film.  As an action film, it is great.  As a Bond film, it is a little weak.
  Kara Milovy (MARYAM D'ABO) is one of the best Bond girls ever.  Sadly, I cannot say much about her with giving  away some major plot points.  A I'll say is she's a sexy, smart, BEAUTIFUL  cellist.  Bond falls in love with her, as does 99.9% of the heterosexual  male audience. (I am one of 'em.)
  The theme song by a-ha is a catchy  tune I ended up singing in the shower (no joke).  The pre-title war games  sequence is one of the best ever.
  Necros is a good, truly evil  villain.  But, he's the only really bad bad guy.  Whitaker hardly gets any  screen time, so we have little reason to hate him.  Koskov is almost  totally lovable; he hugs everyone he meets.  But a dearth of strong  villains is really the only thing that bugged me (and I'm pretty critical  to begin with).  I'd recommend this movie to any Bond fan, but only after  they've seen Goldfinger, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia With  Love, The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your Eyes Only, and Octopussy.",932860800,,1084,4.253731343283582

462744,5,6302380294,"I really like this film. It had all the right elements in the right proportions. I think Timothy Dalton did a excellent job as Bond. He had a touch of humor, and handled the action sequences very well. I wish he had stayed on in the role.",1504915200,,238,4.085106382978723
462745,5,6302380294,"This was effectively the last Bond to take place in the midst of Cold War Europe.  Ok, maybe the original Cold War, as you could say it rebooted itself sometime in the 2000s and exists today, but it is very different now.  This was the original Cold War, when we had a clear Arch Rival - The Soviet Union.

I expect Bond movies to supply not only state-of-the-art technology, but beautiful, interesting and/or exotic and far away places, and displays of otherworldly wealth and decadence, and this one does not disappoint. It has a fantastic start high over the Rock of Gibraltar.  It then transitions to what used to be called Czechoslovakia, which was totally entangled in the Communist web and Cold War intrigue for decades, and was also of great importance in WWII.  It is in the ancient and beautiful city of Bratislava where Bond first lays eyes on the primary Bond Girl----who is his target!  I believe this is the first time the mighty Walther WA 2000 sniper rifle appeared in a film, but thankfully Bond spared the Bond Girl, which was the right thing to do this time.

Another piece of eye candy for Bond afficionados is the gorgeous Aston Martin V8 Vantage, a return to a proper blue blood English supercar (much more so than the 4-cylinder Lotus Esprit, although it was exotic for its time). Despite its posh appearance, the Vantage could compete with some of the fastest exotic road cars in the world. And when Bond rolls up to the majestic Stoner House (""a little place in the country"") in the Aston, white horses in the foreground, you couldn't possibly describe a more English or more studly scene than that. And there was even some bloke delivering bottles of milk to the manor in 1987 (something alien to Americans after the 1950s)!  The Aston ice sled scene is also great fun, as are the on-board missiles and wheel-mounted lasers.  There are several fantastic REAL stunt sequences throughout (no CGI back then, kids).  And the Mujahideen were our ""allies"" against the Soviets back then. How times change...

Dalton did a great job as Bond, and I would have liked to have seen him get at least one more movie beyond the mediocre follow up to this one, License to Kill.  License to Kill suffers first and foremost in my mind from having no particularly exotic or interesting places, and no interesting villains or plot twists, either. But The Living Daylights was clearly a homerun, and met the much telegraphed goal of making Bond more serious agent and less light-heated ladies' man, and there is a little humor and romance in the right places.  The title track performed by A-Ha is also a homerun, cutting edge pop with an unmistakable Bond feel; one of the greats.  The real surprise was the smoldering, melancholy, sentimental closing song by Chrissie Hynde ""If there A Man"".  That song should have somehow been used earlier in the film and then repeated at the end so that more people heard it.

Your Bond collection is not complete without this one.",1503446400,2,2974,4.701348747591522

462844,5,6302380294,"I liked this movie when  I first saw it 30 years ago. Now I appreciate it even more. People who think Daniel Craig is a great James Bond need to watch this first Timothy Dalton as James Bond movie. They did it right by not rebooting the James Bond Films but just taking James Bond back early in his career. To me Timothy Dalton was the 2nd BEST ACTOR to play James Bond. Timothy Dalton was a romantic James Bond who truly cared about the woman in peril. In closing I will take Timothy Dalton as James Bond over Daniel Craig ANYDAY.By the way the fight between Bond and Necros on the transport plane kept me on the edge of my seat while the fight between Bond(Daniel Craig) and the big brute on the train in ""SPECTRE"" was a JOKE.",1498089600,,728,4.2

This is my first time viewing this movie. To be perfectly honest there is a lot of unintentional humor. Several scenes will make an modern audience laugh. It's unavoidable but it's also fun. SPOILERS for example when they run out of gas, they clearly show they are above only mountains but when they escape in their jeep they are on a road and you can see nothing but flat ground for miles. It's like the director or editor didn't even care. And seeing James Bond sledding down a mountain in a cello case is priceless.

462934,4,6302380294,"Pleasantly surprised. This was my first Timothy Dalton Bond movie, and I am left wondering why he didn't get more movies as Bond. He was great. He made for a classy and understated Bond. Nothing cartoonish about him.

This movie was surprisingly family-friendly, too. Aside from kissing, no love scenes. There is one brief scene where a woman's top is revealed, albeit from the back with a little side exposed. It was a mild movie and deserving of a refreshing PG rating. No PG-13 here.

The action scenes were fun. One of the chase scenes was classic Bond, almost whimsical and with the traditional Bond wry one-liners. Just funny and fun.

Of course, girls thrown in here and there, many pool side scenes so plenty of bikinis, none of which this Bond took interest. There were also enough gadgets to make it fun. And that Aston Martin V8 Vantage / V8 Volante--what a gorgeous car!

Just an enjoyable Bond movie.",1487376000,,913,4.6875

463149,4,6302380294,"The Timothy Dalton James Bond movies are by far the most underrated and under-appreciated movies in the franchise. I'm glad to see they are at least being recognized here on Amazon. The story with these movies is pretty simple, people were tired of seeing the same old Roger Moore quipping the same old tired puns, with the storylines becoming more and more absurd. So what did they do? They went back to basics.

In an unfortunately limited run of only 2 movies (apparently Brosnan had already been promised the role) we got a much more sincere Bond, from a classically trained actor in Timothy Dalton that took a grittier approach all while maintaining the traditional 007 archetypes.

One of the great aspects of The Living Daylights is the Aston Martin V8 Vantage Volante, which I think is one of the best cars of the franchise. After the Lotus became the Bond car towards the end of the Moore-era, the Aston Martin was just an after thought. Though the vehicle lasted for just a short period of time (as seems to be tradition) it showcased perhaps the coolest features we had seen in over a decade to this point.

Having a beautiful Bond girl who isn't a bad actress doesn't hurt it's case either. Bond girls have really been hit or miss coming up to this point, and since it's such an integral part of the series, a good Bond girl makes a better Bond movie. The theme song really embraced the 80's with the A-ha title track, just as it had earlier in the decade with Duran Duran's ""A View to a Kill"", which was a better song, but a worse movie.

Overall this is a great 007 movie, there are enough poor and mediocre entries in the series that this one really stands out and deserves further consideration.

464212,1,6302380294,"I started a collection of Bond Blu-rays, as they often are on sale for $5-7. I grewup on Connery and Roger Moore, but stopped watching the films by the 80's. The latest Daniel Craig Bond film perked my interest to check out the older films again. I bought this because it was highly rated on Amazon.

As I watched it, I just could not understand what anybody liked about it. Bond films have a long running tradition, and viewers expect they are going to get a cool song, some sexy bond girls, a heavy villian, lots of action, cool cars and gadets, etc. Fans of the series can also expect to see recurring characters like M, Moneypenny, Q, Felix, etc. The actors may change but some things have been well established in this series.

If I judge this Bond film by the above expectations, it really doesn't hold up well:
* The song by A-Ha (and the ending song by the Pretenders) are forgetable and barely decent pop songs, even for these artists.
* I'm open to Dalton playing Bond but he's too nice and kind and gentlemanly to be believable in the role of a professional assassin
* Where's the villian? Bad actors with bad Russian and Afganistan accents, none are tough or believeable... there never seems to be in any real threat of danger to Bond or the world
* The one Bond girl we get here is a pretty cellist(!), fully clothed (never sexily or in any revealing clothing) throughout the film, she's neither tough nor smart nor sexy, and it's like we're watching her and Bond go on a first date
* Felix and Moneypenny are played by young actors who are clearly laughing their way through the parts, it's good these ones were replaced in later films
* There's some action, mainly the opening sequence, but most of the time this seems like a bad 80's comedy or a parody of a Bond film, the fighting scenes seemed too staged and even when it's supposed to be intense it still seems like a comedy B-movie
* Weak (and few) devices (a smoking key ring that is activated by whistling) and car

This is clearly a ""watered down"" version of a Bond film. Avoid it. For classic Bond, see ""From Russia With Love""!",1455408000,,2101,4.423772609819121

This is the 15th official movie and the first one with Timothy Dalton as secret agent, James Bond 007.
  The previous movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-View-To-A-Kill-HD/dp/B009GIYGXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A View To A Kill [HD</a>] (1985), was the last for Roger Moore as ""James Bond"" at the age of 57 and Lois Maxwell as ""Miss Moneypenny"".

As it turns out, the sniper is a woman, Mara Milovy (Maryam d'Abo), a cellist in the concert. Bond is ordered to shoot her, but he deliberately misses and decides to shoot the rifle out of her hand instead. After all, Bond might have some use for her later. Bond's mission is to secretly get General Koskov across the border safely to Austria and then onto Britain.
  Now with that done, Bond must find Mara Milovy and track down the villain Brad Whitaker (Joe Don Baker).

Timothy Dalton rescues Bond from the absurd camp of the later Roger Moore years with a portrayal that perfectly blends the character's charm with his dark and brooding side (only to go overboard with the latter in ""License to Kill). The plot is a little convoluted, as in many Bond films, but not impossible to follow, and it captures the spirit of the waning days of the Cold War perfectly.

Great locations, solid action, an intelligent script, the right proportion of stock Bond elements (the car, the gadgets, the girls) with the more mundane aspects of being a spy/assassin -- Living Daylights has it all.

This film is excellent, the story is actually really good and Tim, although different from previous Bonds does very well. His dry sense of humor adds a touch not found in Moore's films, his slightly more serious approach refreshing, the way Bond should be. The Living Daylights is the best of his two, the other being License to Kill, which I feel was a disappointing film due to the story-line having Felix Lightner's wife murdered just wasn't ok with me, but this one is great. Perfect balance between action and non-action scenes, and the climax in the air freighter being one of the best in a Bond film.

Some believe the dark Bond was premature and perhaps it was for its time of release but today, this film celebrates Fleming's Bond and is a must see.  The movie also reminds us now that even though so much has changed, nothing really has at all.

Don't expect to see much love making in this film though Timothy Dalton is a very capable Bond in the bedroom.  This Bond is focused on his mission and not even Moneypenny tempts him long.

And this wouldn't be a Bond film without at least a cameo from General Gogol (Walter Gotell), who can be seen at the end of the film",1418688000,,807,4.493150684931507

I found THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS to be one of the better James Bond films. I think it is the best since ON HER MAJESTY's SECRET SERVICE. I really liked Timothy Dalton as James Bond, the James Bond he gave us in this film (THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS). He was not the hard edged civil servant but more of a thinking man's blunt instrument as he demonstrated his reluctance to get the job done ""their"" way as opposed to ""his"" way.

John Barry delivered his last 007 score and it is one of his best. I also enjoyed a-ha's rich and lyrical theme song played over Maurice Binder's main titles, which are very reflective. This was also the last Bond film made during the actual cold war. We see a much more intelligent British agent discern that the KGB is not made up of a bunch of hoodlums but instead it is actually headed by an equally intelligent counterpart to ""M"" and the like. The dark yet richly colored photography and locations bring back much of the feel of the earlier Bond films.

Timothy Dalton deserved to be around much longer as James Bond based on his work in this film.",1418083200,,1189,4.375565610859729

But the reason for the 3 stars is the actor.  As a general comment - Why do they have to use characters like this where they JUST DON'T CARRY THE movie as others do, like:CONERY and MOORE and BROSNAN too.
The real problem now is that the last guy after Brosnan (numbers 21, 22, & 23) was not in real BOND movie types.

465334,4,6302380294,"One of many very similar James Bond films, it is disappointing that Timothy Dalton only did two films as James Bond. This film, like so many others in the series, bounces around to various places in the world, Gibraltar, Czechoslovakia, Tangiers, Afghanistan, and else, often with tenuous connections. I still don't understand the point of the Gibraltar scenes, except it introduces a character trying to assassinate 00 agents. This leads Bond to various places and a chance to have chase scenes in the snowy mountains of Czechoslovakia and later chases in the Afghan desert. One of the better Bond films, it has a love interest in the character of Maryam d'Abo as a cello player, and someone who is intellectual and can contribute to the plot. Too often these types of films had had women who were useless damsels in distress. Later Bond films had women who were agents just as efficient as Bond as himself. High light of the film is the chase aboard the airplane with a bomb aboard and Bond has to fight an assassin, and the scene where d'Abo's character drives a jeep onto that same airplane.
  Other good scenes are those with John Rhys Davies as General Pushkin. He and Bond seem to have a past together and the scenes in the hotel where they arrange the faking of his death were delightful. The chemistry between the two was grand and Davies should have a larger role. Also, the American arms dealer played by Joe Don Baker was another opportunity for the British to make fun of Americans as psychotic gun nuts.
  However the title of the film is meaningless. I did not get why it is called The Living Daylights.
  Also the irony of the British helping out the mujahideen in Afghanistan is funny now, but in 1987 these terrorists were useful in throwing out the Soviets, which was more important at the time. So the scenes of Bond helping these people in the film was hysterical in a cynical way.
  On the whole one of the better Bond films, but still tends to run too long and try to take too much of Bond as world traveler.",1406332800,4,2031,4.56043956043956

465419,4,6302380294,"There may be spoilers.  I've been watching a series on TV's Showtime network called ""Penny Dreadful.""  It stars Timothy Dalton and Eva Green.  Bond fans will likely see another connection.  Both were in James Bond films 19 years apart.  Green was in 2006's Casino Royale and here Dalton takes over for Roger Moore.  The role was originally going to go to Pierce Brosnan but he couldn't get out of his contract with the makers of TV's ""Remington Steele.""  Many feel that Dalton was miscast, but I remember at the time that I thought he made a convincing 007.  Time to take another look.

After the usual opening hair-raising scene, of little plot significance, Bond is sent to Czechoslovakia to assist with the defection of Soviet General Georgi Koskov (Jeroen Krabbe).  It is believed that the Soviets would have sharp shooters around as well as the normal security detail.  Bond is to act as a countering sharpshooter.  I'm thinking, wouldn't they have someone else for such a non-007 assignment?  They answer that quickly with the fact that Koskov requested Bond.

Koskov is attending a classical performance at the local theater and makes his escape to the Brits.  Bond spots a beautiful girl (Maryam d'Abo) armed with a rifle taking a bead on Koskov.  The girl, Kara, is also a cellist in the orchestra.  Sensing something is amiss, Bond only shoots the rifle out of her hand.  As it turns out Koskov, now in British hands, is actually working secretly with a wacko American arms dealer named Brad Whitaker (Joe Don Baker).  As it turns out (spoiler), Koskov is faking his own defection and really wants to undermine the new head of the KGB, General Pushkin (John Rhys-Davies).  But Koskov's main goal is to get rich trading arms to the Afghans for opium.  Remember the Soviets have invaded Afghanistan.

So where does lovely Kara fit in all this?  Well, she's been the girlfriend of Koskov.  That is until James shows her the error of her ways.  Frankly, I like Dalton in the role.  He has the cool, the look and the charm of our hero.  This episode tones down the comic book humor so prevalent in many of the Moore films.  The action is more limited here as well, but the scenes where there is action, are well done.  For the most part Bond limits his action with the ladies too, including Kara.  Many will find much of this too boring for Bond.  A lot of that has to do with the iffy script.  This film isn't one of the best of the franchise but I found it a nice change of pace from Moore's more lighthearted Bond.

This Blu ray Bond comes in a 1080p video resolution with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  I think one of the best things about the video is that it looks like it was a recently made film.  The source was likely in very good condition, always a good start.  Faint grain appears throughout.  Colors, skin-tones and detail look very good.  The film does not have the extra sharpness we see in many films today, but I don't think that has anything to do with the technical manipulation to Blu ray.

The audio is excellent as well with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track for English.  It is thoroughly engaging with the surrounds jumping into action with explosions, gun battles, rockets, etc.  There is also a nice score by John Barry (his last for Bond) and a terrific title track by A-ha.  I also loved the song played over the closing credits called ""If There Was A Man"" sung by Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders.  She contributed another song called ""Where Has Everybody Gone"" performed during the film.  It all sounds great with the lossless track.  Subtitles include: English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish.  The Blu ray is loaded with extras.  Here are some of them: Swedish.

465791,4,6302380294,"In 1987, veteran actor Timothy Dalton (with plenty of Shakespearean stage experience) was recruited to portray a deadly new James Bond in ""The Living Daylights.""  Perhaps the best way to describe Dalton's take on Agent 007 is that he literally becomes the Bond straight from author Ian Fleming's source material: icy cool, brooding, and almost totally believable.  The dilemma with Dalton's Bond, as many critics will point out, is that he doesn't come close to matching the charisma or sheer entertainment value that Sean Connery and Roger Moore previously invested the role with.  In other words, as a viewer, do you either want classic Bond movie glitz or a credible end-of the-Cold War spy flick?  ""The Living Daylights"" is most definitely the latter.

Following a cool pre-credits ""training"" sequence and a-ha's decent title song, Bond faces a most complicated caper re: scheming Russian General Koskov's (Jeroen Krabbe) fake defection and his link to an arms-for-opium racket in war-torn Afghanistan.  Also tied into the storyline is a supposed KGB ""war on spies"" with Bond and his fellow -00's high on the hit list.  Most reminiscent of ""From Russia With Love"" (1963) and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969), this Bond film finally jettisons the campy Roger Moore era of can-you-top-this? appeal to successfully push a mature, gritty, and more realistic style ... call it spy noir, if you will.  Dalton, as intended, really shines.  His chemistry with sole Bond Girl, cellist/Koskov's girlfriend Kara Milovy (Maryam d'Abo), also proves superbly low-key.  And kudos to director John Glen for redeeming himself so well following 1983's sluggish ""Octopussy"" and then sleepwalking through 1985's dreadful ""A View to a Kill.""

Backed by an effective ensemble cast, ""The Living Daylights"" is neither flashy nor super-entertaining, but it's a worthy turning point (installment # 15) in the Bond film franchise.

Rating: 4/ 5 stars.  ""The Living Daylights"" starring a literary-style Bond deserves re-discovery.",1400198400,,2014,5.3354430379746836
465792,5,6302380294,"Of all the Bonds, this was Q's favorite and maybe mine. Dalton brings a weariness and reality to the job of government assassin that  Daniel Craig took three movies to find. (Perhaps not fair in that Craig had to start from the beginning of the Bond story, while Dalton assumes the role after a decade plus of silly Bond.)

The movie was a great bridge between the Roger Moore Bond flicks that had fallen into self-mockery, and the latest reboot with the enhanced action and grittiness. There is still a little cheese hanging off Living Daylights, but it is much more accessible to people that have only know Craig and maybe a bit of Brosnan (the spiritual successor to Moore).

The soundtrack is classic Bond and the action is something one could imagine Sean Connery engaged in (during his prime). The Afghan storyline is a nice view of the change in perspective history brings in just a couple decades.

465914,5,6302380294,"Timothy Dalton takes over the role of James Bond in this 15th Bond film.  After having passed on the role in the late-1960s, Dalton accepted the role over New Zealander, Sam Neil. Timothy Dalton plays a focused and no-nonsense Bond in the mode of  Sean Connery. Dalton actually read several of ian Fleming's Bond novels to get into character. His persona is established during the harrowing opening sequence on Gibraltar. Interestingly, Dalton insisted on doing many of the stunts in this sequence atop a Land Rover and others throughout the film.

The Living Daylights is an ode to the Cold War period by having at its center the story of ""Smiert Spionam"", a death squad h slogan (""Death to Spies"") held by a beria operation run by the Soviets in the 1960s. Bond is called into aid in the defection of a KGB agent, General Koskov (Jeroen Krabbe). Koskov soon reveals that there is a plot to kill British agents that has been concocted by General Pushkin (John Rhys-Davies) who has replaced General Gogol. This is where the plot becomes good because Bond is played for the fool as the double-crosses begin. This cleverly-concocted spy action film delivers and functions as a taut film.  Bond soon suspects a conspiracy involving Koskov and Brad Whitaker, an eccentric American arms dealer (Joe Don Baker). Maryam d'Abo plays the innocent Kara Milovy (Maryam d'Abo), Koskov's beautiful cellist girlfriend. The chemistry between Dalton and d'Abo is believable because this Bond is a one-woman man and shows his emotions. This is the strength of this movie.

Of course, the film has villains. From the MI^ imposter (Carl Rigg) in the opening sequence to Necros (Andreas Wisniewski) who single-handedly takes out a house of Bond's fellow agents, the villainous strongmen are hard-nosed.  Unfortunately, the main villains are lackluster and one-dimensional. General Georgi Koskov is a buffoon and Whitaker is a second-rate braggart who throws out childish insults.  wIn spite of these weaknesses, veteran Bond film director, John Glen and screenwriters Richard Maibaum & Michael G. Wilson) deliver a sleek, hard-nosed spy action-thriller in the best tradition of the Bond franchise. The film also features some sleek and jaw-dropping action sequences including the breath-taking opening parachute jump, the fight atop and inside the Land Rover and its plunge into the sea, the frozen lake sequence featuring the return of Bond's gadget-fitted Aston-Martin against the Czech army, the desert battle between the Soviet army and the Afghan rebels, and the final battle between Necros and Bond as they hang out of a cargo plane. Along for the ride are Art Malik as Kamran Shah (a British-educated Afghan rebel leader), British Agent Saunders (Thomas Wheatley), Q (Desmond Llewellyn), M (Robert brown), Minister of Defence (Geoffrey Keen), former (now Cultural Ambassador) General Anatol Gogol (Walter Gotell), Miss Moneypenny (Caroline Bliss) and Felix Leiter (John Terry). The result is a very good entry in the Bond series.",1390348800,,3016,5.193415637860082
465915,5,6302380294,"Based on a Sort Story of the same name, it takes the short story and expands it to add an escape in a cello case over the snow, Afghan freedom fighters, drug smuggling and an exploding bridge and much more.

465916,3,6302380294,"Timothy Dalton made his 007 debut in the lean, mean mode of Sean Connery, doing away with the pun-filled camp of Roger Moore's final outings since Roger Moore was obviously starting to look too old to keep doing the James Bond character after this movie's predecessor VIEW TO A KILL in the Summer of 1985 which by the way was Moore's last Bond flick.

Dalton's James Bond is ruthless, tough, and romantic. THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS, set during the thaw of the cold war, begins with the defection of Russian KGB General Koskov (Jeroen Krabb) and his revelation of a Soviet plot to eliminate Britain's secret agent force.

Assigned to eliminate Koskov's Soviet boss (John Rhys-Davies), Bond uncovers a conspiracy involving Koskov and an American arms dealer (Joe Don Baker). Veteran series director John Glen's action scenes have never been better--especially the show-stopping mid-air battle on the net of a speeding cargo plane--and he returns the series to the smart, rough, high-energy adventures that made the Bond reputation.

Armed with razor-sharp instincts and a licence to kill, James Bond battles diabolical arms merchants bent on world domination in this thrilling, lightning-paced adventure. Timothy Dalton brings energy, humour and ruthless cunning to his debut performance.

This action-drama flick takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was 14 going on 15 years old during my Freshmen year in high school during its theatrical release in the Summer of 1987 when they announced Timothy Dalton as the new Bond face.",1389916800,,1534,5.099601593625498

466008,4,6302380294,"One of the James Bond movies I enjoy watching over and over. Part of the reason I enjoy this movie is that it it is clearly European and British entertainment without knocking America. Part of the reason I enjoy this movie is brings back memories. I can clearly remember the day I went to the theatre to see this movie. I can clearly remember how I felt that day and in that general time frame. It was a good time. Good feelings. Good memories. But I remember thinking that the Bond girl was beautiful. That the scenes in what was then Czechoslovakia were beautiful and quaint. The scenes in Austria were beautiful and European quaint. The sledding on a cello case scenes was neat. It was an era when you knew who your enemies where as the Cold War was raging. The world was divided along good and evil lines and the ... while not ideal . . . was comforting in a weird way.

Anyway, I never thought Timothy Dalton was a good Bond. The more I watch this movie and the other one he did I do appreciate him as an actor. But I never thought he was a good James Bond. He is not sexy. He is not good looking. He has these blood shot eyes. He looks like he might be one of those guys that just has constant bad breath. He just didn't do it for me.

Also, I wonder why no one examines the one scary idea portrayed in this movie that at the time went unnoticed. The Afghanistan Muslims that Bond helps and fights along side of. These are the same people who are killing Americans, Brits and other WEsterners as fast as they can. These are the terrorists. In this movie they are portrayed as victims of Russian occupation. Kinda eyebrow raising. But just as I feel old having known a Czechoslovakia I guess history continues on and you never know who your enemy is going to be or how things unfold.",1384041600,,1788,4.2558823529411764
466009,4,6302380294,"""The Living Daylights"" was the first of two James Bond films featuring Timothy Dalton as 007. It's a solid Bond film, but rarely cited when the best films of the franchise are discussed. The ""problem"" isn't Dalton because he makes a fine James Bond and was what the series needed in 1987 (when the film was released). Although the Roger Moore era (1973-1985) is my favorite stretch of Bond films, mainly because they're so all-around entertaining, I think everyone was craving a more serious Bond by 1987 and Dalton delivers the goods.

First the good: ""The Living Daylights"" features a great opening sequence involving skydiving at the Rock of Gibraltar followed by a Jeep-going-down-the-mountain scene. A short while later there's a cool Winter chase sequence with Bond and his romantic interest (Maryam d'Abo) in a car with skis (shot in Austria). The last act takes place in Afghanistan (but was shot in Morocco and the Mojave Desert) and, at first, I thought it was going to be one of those boring action-endings, like ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" (1977), but the sequence increases in suspense as James and his babe try to get out of the country on a cargo plane, and the film still doesn't end at that point. This climax features three or four excellent suspense scenes and some funny quips as well.

Unfortunately, the film is weak in the area of women. D'Abo is decent in a doe-eyed, winsome way, but that's it. Other than her, there are only brief flashes of women with no one particularly standing out.

The cast also includes Joe Don Baker, Jeroen Krabb, John Rhys-Davies and Andreas Wisniewski, mostly villains or possible villains.

BOTTOM LINE: Although ""The Living Daylights"" is not a highlight of the series, it's definitely a worthwhile Bond flick with the usual staples, albeit shaky in the area of women. Aside from Timothy Dalton, who makes a refreshing Bond, the opening and ending sequences are the best parts.

The film runs 130 minutes.

466130,5,6302380294,"This film has one of my favorite opening sequences and does a great job introducing Dalton in his first of only two outings as the cinematic super spy. There's a quick moment when one of the 'OO' agents parachutes into a tree and is taken out of the exercise by one of the soldiers, who says something along the lines of 'that's it for you fella'. I always wondered if that actor was Roger Moore's stunt double because he has a very similar look.

Anyway this is a pretty epic Bond film although perhaps a bit dated at this point. I've gotten used to Pierce Brosnan by this point, but when he first came on as Bond (in a very strong debut film with GOLDENEYE) I really felt the franchise had stumbled. Dalton really seems more like what I picture Bond looking like where as Brosnan looked a bit too much like a catalog model (he is a very good actor though, and personality wise probably one of the top three Bonds so far.",1377734400,2,922,4.2988505747126435

466215,5,6302380294,"Living Daylights is a nice return to form for the franchise and a return to Ian Fleming's Bond which For Your Eyes Only hinted but still had a few typical moments in a Roger Moore Bond. Live And Let Die and The Spy Who Loved Me were 2 films they got right with Roger Moore and For Your Eyes Only was decent but by that point he was too old to play Bond. Octopussy and A View To A Kill are when the franchise started to lose itself were it became a parody of it's own. Octopussy was a film fans either liked or they didn't, I found it decent despite Roger Moore's age and it's over-the-top approach but it's still an inferior entry where as A View To A Kill is arguably one of the worst entries in the series and was basically a rip-off of Goldfinger. AVTAK didn't do well at the box office and was luckily Roger Moore's last, not just because his Bond was too campy at times but when they were pushing it when he's almost twice the age of Ian Fleming's Bond.

Timothy Dalton made his debut as Bond in 1987's The Living Daylights which unlike his unsuccessful follow-up Licence To Kill, TLD had a moderate success in box offices. Dalton's Bond was very different from Moore's and much closer to Ian Fleming's. TLD is the closest adaption since On Her Majesty's Secret Service or even From Russia With Love. Although the film isn't based off one novel entirely, it borrows some of Fleming's short along with some of their own writing which works really well. It was back in 1987 which the Cold War was winding down and it would be the last Bond film with Cold War elements, in a way it was the last of the classic Bonds. TLD is a back to basics approach with good stories throughout from Bond being sent to assassinated a woman wrongly accused of being a sniper to confronting an arms dealer, going after an opium supply and fighting a henchman to his death on a plane. TLD doesn't just have good action and stunts throughout but a good plot along with one of the best Bond scores along with one of the best Bond girls Kara Milovy played by Marayam D'Abo who played her well and had a lot better chemistry with Bond than over half the other Bond girls. Joe Don Baker as Brad Whitaker was a good villain and well written which a lot of people have a problem with, one that I have is that he didn't get enough on screen but the henchman more than makes up which Necros might be my favorite henchman of the franchise and is one of the few threatening henchman. Jaws is still a favorite of many and was a great henchman but very different in tone where as Necros and TLD's have a far more realistic approach than The Spy Who Loved Me. John Ryse-Davies also gives a good performance as General Pushkin, the new head of KGB replacing General Gogol.
TLD is classic Bond and a gem in espionage/spy thrillers in general with great action along with good suspense, drama, character development and just a great plot throughout. Timothy Dalton is actually my favorite Bond next to Sean Connery and was often overlooked which is rather strange considering he was one of the closest to Fleming's Bond and one of the most experienced actors to play Bond. The Living Daylight's is one of my top 10, if not my top 5 Bond films of all time and one of my favorite action movies in general.",1375488000,,3269,4.341503267973856
466216,5,6302380294,"To those of us who grew up in the 1980's, Timothy Dalton IS James Bond, and that's that, so I will always have a soft spot for his Bond films.  I am a huge fan of the 007 series, and in my opinion all of the actors who have played James Bond have their strong points, but with Dalton I find that he is a good balance of all these qualities.  He is classy, yet tough, with just the right amount of the wit you expect from James Bond, and a bit darker than the previous Bonds, which I like.  It is a shame he was only in 2 Bond movies, though he was under a 7-year contract and the initial plan was to have more films starring him as James Bond, it was not to be.  Both of Dalton's films are among my favorite Bond films, but The Living Daylights is my favorite of the two, and I would definitely put in the top 5.  Dalton is excellent, the supporting cast is great, the ""Bond girl"" is very hot, and the plot is solid.  Don't listen to all of the haters out there who have panned Dalton...at least check it out for yourself and be the judge.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",1374969600,2,1082,4.004651162790697

I realize that Timothy Dalton is not everyone's favorite Bond, nor mine. However,he plays the role competently.  If you look past the fact he is not Sean Connery, this Bond movie is as good as any of the previous Bond movies. One hallmark of good Bond films is excellent theme music, which stays in your head for days after seeing the movie.  The music in Living Daylights meets the standard. If you like Bond movies, you must see this one. (If you don't like Bond movies there is not much point in seeing this one. If you have never seen a Bond movie, I suggest you start with Casino Royale. It was made more recently, so the cinematography is more modern, but chronologically it was the first Bond story and gives you some of Bond's back story.

466602,4,6302380294,"The world has moved on quite far since the 80s harsh judgement of Timothy Daltons Bond. Now is time to reevaluate this movie. First off I have to admit that I have a very soft almost marshmallowy spot for this Bond as it was the first I saw in the cinema that I can remember getting excited about. Since then I have watched with glee each step along the franchise and enjoyed all...at the time they came out. But now as I have evolved into loving Daniel Craig's tough no nonsense, almost ""damaged goods""-Bond,  my view of the character has changed. Like surviving a traumatic event it is hard to go back and see things once loved with immature eyes. It is hard now for example to watch Skyfall then watch Tomorrow Never Dies or any of the Brosnan Bonds and almost impossible to watch any Roger or late Connery slapstick. ""Trouble Keeping it Up Q?""etc etc.

The Living Daylights is an exception to this and is amazingly watchable in conjunction with the new era. Dalton's serious workmanlike performance may lose some of the charm but his lack of patience and pandering along with a shunning of a lot of the eyebrow raising quips means it keeps a direct serious tone. Daltons next would sacrifice too much in terms of locations and polish for it to feel like a Bond movie but TLD stikes a great balance.

At time of release Dalton et al were criticised for the approach however it seems they were just twenty odd years too soon. Viewers needed a moderate approach and a jokey immaculately haired actor first. Which is why we loved Brosnan, even a CGI surfing, invisible car driving one at that.

If you have the Craig films and want to add another movie that doesnt clash wildly get The Living Daylights and Dr No.",1362787200,,1713,4.498392282958199
466603,5,6302380294,"The Living Daylights for me was all about the car. The car chase and the numerous tools used made this movie one of my favorites (radio scanner, rocket booster, laser, missiles, tire spikes, bulletproof glass, self-destruct). I think Timothy could have been a great bond, but License to Kill was just not a well written Bond Movie. He has always been a suave actor for me since Flash Gordon and the Rocketeer.",1362700800,,409,4.694444444444445
466700,5,6302380294,"and an underrated gem. None of the Roger Moore camp. This guy's a killer. It has a few nods to 80's pop culture which now seem dated. Nevertheless, I rank TLD among my top 5 favorite Bond films.

This is the only Bond film with music so stunning that I bought the John Barry score separately. Go on over to YouTube and listen to Mujahadin and Opium. It's achingly beautiful.",1362268800,,374,4.3428571428571425
466701,5,6302380294,"The Living Daylights revitalizes Bond from the previous 2 Moore movies (Octopussy and View to a Kill). This Bond is more ruthless, less jokey and the plot is more steeped in the Cold War than in comic books. Bond must investigate the seeming kidnapping of a defected Russian general. This journey leads him to arms dealers in Morocco all the way to Soviet-occupied Afghanistan. Although the Soviet-Afghan war ended in 1989, this movie somehow doesn't feel as dated as a Bond film like GoldenEye due to the quality of film making. The main theme is done by the 1-hit winder AH-Ha; it has mixed reactions but it is one of my favorite themes. My only real complaint is that I think Jo-Don Baker's arms dealer character is too cartoony for the tone the movie is trying to set- almost like he's in a Roger Moore movie. I also though the John Rhys-Davies character should have been General Gogol who is in half a dozen Bond films; this would have given the fact Bond has to kill him more emotional weight. Plus, General appears at the end so it's not like he was unable. But John Rhys-Davies is quite good so I shouldn't complain about that.",1361404800,,1135,4.541463414634146

Timothy Dalton is excellent in his first turn as Bond and reminds us how he could have been in this role if he had been given more scripts of this quality.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well, and the scenery is (as we expect from Bond) spectacular.

As for the DVD, like all the Bond disks in this series, the picture and sound are better than they ever were in a theater and there are a lot of fun extras.  Plenty to explore in the world of Bond.

The strong point in this film unlike other Bond films is that it cuts out on the overuse of camp humour as well as gadgets that would have been outdated in ten years the film was made. It also contains the best opening sequence of a bond film and also a very good finale that is both exciting and a tad more real than some other bond films.  The only weak point in this film is some of the acting of Maryam D'Abo.  Timothy Dalton played an exellect bond, and while he my not be as highly rated as Connery, I still believe he is better than Moore and just as good as Brosnan. I don't rate the other two.

Someone said the plot was confusing, the plot is this, Koskov defects to England with the help of Bond, and then gets abducted by the KGB, but Bond doubts that the defection was even real, since Koskov had named Puskin as the one behind all the spies being hunted down, but through Koskov's girlfriend. He tracks Koskov down, and with the help of the CIA. Finds out, that Koskov works for Brad Wittaker. An Arms dealer, and Opium smuggler. And the KGB is also after him, this is a solid Bond movie.

While it might miss my list of the top five Bonds ever, it's certainly a welcome breath of fresh air after the increasingly creaky - and far too cartoonish - outings of Roger Moore. Dalton brings a welcome sense of danger back to the role of 007; when he pulls his weapon on John Rhys-Davies late in the film, you'd be forgiven for thinking that he might actually shoot him. In that way, it's a shame that he made only two films as 007 (though Dalton's second film, ""Licence to Kill,"" turned out to be awful). The production values here are solid, and the focus on a (relatively) realistic tale of Cold War espionage keeps the story and characters grounded. Unfortunately, Dalton's Bond films had one of the weaker supporting casts of any Bond era: his Monneypenny is the weakest of that characters' three incarnations, and the actor playing M barely registers - despite having already essayed the role in Moore's final two outings. And Maryam D'Abo, while not terrible, is also hardly memorable as Bond's romantic interest.

466930,5,6302380294,"Unlike many reviewers and fans I have to admit Timothy Dalton has always been my favorite James Bond, that is until Daniel Craig took over the role in ""Casino Royale"". I also believe that critics and the studio never gave Timothy a chance to really sink his teeth into the role as he only appeared as Bond twice, first in ""The Living Daylights"" and in 1989's ""Licence To Kill"", the latter of which was not a commercial success leading MGM to decide to find another Bond. To me Timothy always had wonderful charisma, sexiness, and charm along with class and elegance that could make audiences swoom.

 In ""The Living Daylights"" Bond invesitgates the death of several M16 agents and he is informed the head of the KGB is murdering several American and British spies. Like most Bond movies the film is filled with exciting exotic locales like Morocco and Afghanistan, as well as several locales across Europe. There are beautiful women, evil villins, and a neat title sequence.

 Overall, a better-than-average Bond film that I enjoyed tremendously. The film would go on to make a staggering $191,000,000 at the boxoffice on a $40,000,000  budget making ""The Living Daylights"" one of the more successful Bond films.",1287705600,2,1212,4.892682926829268
466931,3,6302380294,"Despite the weak villians and the lame plot, The Living Daylights has a three dimensional side that people often overlook. Timothy Dalton was terrific and he is certaintly the high point of the film.

Unlike the Bond's who came before, and after, Timothy Dalton his genuine introduction was regulated to after the colourful pre-title sequence. The mission Bond undertakes after the credits role is ""assisiting"" in the defection of a Russian General named Georgi Koskov who has a KGB sniper on his tail. Bond is not interested in the assissination he's about to make, his attitude at the moment he appears is quite clear. He's tired of the killing and his only solace he finds during the dreadful affair is a girl with a chello he spots at the theatre were Koskov plans to make his escape; The perfect homage to Fleming's very swarthy and cold short story. Later on the film the plot thickens when Koskov is appearantly kidnapped right after his defection. Before Koskov is abducted he points the finger at the current head of the KGB, General Leonardi Pushkin whom Koskov accuses of going mad and wanting to eliminate all western spies. Bond confronts Puskin later and he's is ruthless about it, you really think he'll pull that trigger at any moment and you almost forget he had his doubts about Pushkin being guilty of murdering western agents earlier. Now the draw back to Dalton's brooding interpretation of the character is that he just does not know how to cut through the camera, you feel his presence but he seemed uncomfortable playing the lighter aspects of Bond. I am not sure it's the fact that the one-liners were more atkin to Roger Moore's James Bond but Dalton seemed none too comfortable about Bond being a bit of a romantic action hero who drops those one liners like Phillip Marlowe.

Though Dalton had trouble with the comedy that dosen't mean he was being too serious in the world The Living Daylights occurs in, it's more down to earth and socially conscience than most Bonds. First off all the allies have their hands dirty in this one. Kamran Shah, who helps Bond and Bond girl Kara Milovy in the desert, is selling dope to buy arms and General Puskin already had a long established history of buying weapons through the primary antagonists. Lastly this is the only Bond film, so far, to mention a then current on-going conflict, The Soviet Afghan War.

The characterizations here are sharper than usual. Kara Milovy is one of the more well written Bond girls. She is the kind of the girl who looks up to Pussy Galore and Honey Rider, she's niave and scared like anyone who with an atmosphere of murder and deceit. Also Saunders is one of the more tragic deaths in the series. He was man enough to swallow his pride and helps Bond with a critical matter after professionally being bested by Bond earlier in the film and he dies not because it was in the line of duty persay, it was mistaken identity.

This Bond film is a bit of a mixed bag, the villians are inept and merely plotting mundane crimes that could not even suffice for less glamourless thrillers. Despite the lack of thrills, the action is suitable, the side characters are well written, and Dalton definetly shines as 007 for better or worse.",1285200000,2,3230,4.681338028169014

467019,4,6302380294,"""The Living Daylights"" is a superb Bond film, arguably the last of the truly ""classic"" 007 adventures (whatever you think of the Craig entries, or ""Licence to Kill"" for that matter, they are rather severely removed from the tone of the preceding pantheon of films). A thickly-plotted Cold War thriller, it harks back to the spirit of ""From Russia With Love"" but adds a tone of gentle sombreness perhaps unique in the series.

  Timothy Dalton's two outings in the role of James Bond are perhaps doomed to be regarded as an interrum between the longer commercial runs of Roger Moore and Brosnan.  Yet Dalton's steely portrayal, tempered with a kind of brooding passion, is a legitimate and very well-acted interpretation, and I think it works wonderfully in this film.

  ""The Living Daylights"" bookends the vernal lightness of ""For Your Eyes Only"" (one of the breeziest of Bond films in its energy, tautness, and always dazzling light) with an autumnal tone of regret.  It is the last of the Cold War Bond films, and it's fitting for a 1987 production that it makes use of the Iron Curtain and the Soviet war in Afghanistan as backdrops to its tale of spycraft conspiracy.  By the time Bond gets back to Russia in ""Goldeneye"" it (and the series) is a far grungier affair.

  The sequence in which Bond absconds from Czechoslovakia with Kara in tow features one of the most ideal moments in action cinema: using the ""optional extra"" of anti-tank missiles concealed behind the headlights, a very satisfied-looking 007 blasts his way right through a tractor-trailer blocking the road.  Mind you, he *obliterates* the thing, leaving no tangle of molten steel to so much as graze the finish on his Aston Martin (which, sadly, must be blown up to buy a grace period to make the last leg across the border atop Kara's poor cello-case).  It's a sort of Calvin & Hobbes fantasy epiphany, delectable no matter how many times I watch it.

  It's not a flawless film.  Jeroen Krabbe does well with a character that's perhaps a bit misconceived in the script: Gen. Koskov is supposed to be a cooly aloof evil mastermind, and Krabbe conveys this well; but he's required to first play Koskov as a gregarious schnook when he's in the guise of a benign defector.  He hams it up well, but the result makes the 'real' Koskov' less threatening than he should be (and, despite the fine ""Put him in the diplomatic bag"" line, his fate is a throwaway).  Maryam d'Abo is all sweetness, and has a gentle pathos in her role:  when she chases down Bond's plane as it taxis along the Soviet runway, crying out ""James!!!"" repeatedly, it tugs on the heartstrings a bit! But, by definition, she's supposed to be a trifle bland, and if you make her compete with past Bond girls, she'll inevitably seem a bit colorless. And the film's second act feels like it needs a little tightening in the script and editing.

  Still, there's more than a whiff of David Lean inthis film.  With its epic desert battles and astringent Czech interiors, bursts of dramatic Classical music and John Barry's final 007 score, it's a throwback to a more luxurious, Romantic style of storytelling.  It's sweeping and methodical and, though explaining the whole plot is almost impossible (I won't even try!) it's still a very entertaining experience.  -- And Joe Don Baker, bless his heart, is great fun too.  The final shoot-out is most satisfying.",1273276800,3,3393,4.763698630136986
467020,5,6302380294,"My wife and I took off work early and saw ""The Living Daylights"" the day it came out.  About halfway through the film I whispered to her that this did not seem like any Bond film that I had seen.  Actually it did not seem like any of Roger Moore's 7 Bond films that preceded it.  I was not sure that I really liked it after my first viewing.  I saw it twice more in the movies before coming to the conclusion that this was an excellent Bond film (although it is still not one of my all-time favorites.)
Timothy Dalton went back to the basics as Bond, rereading all the Fleming books and portraying him as Fleming had written him.  The film concerns a seemingly Russian plot to murder the 00 agents and the Bond assisting in the defection of a Russian General who may not be as he seems. (The Russian plot is codenamed ""Shmiert Spionim"" whcih meant ""Death to Spies.""  Serious Bond fans will remember this from the great Bond novel ""From Russia With Love."")  It ends in the desert of Afghanistan with Bond assisting the Mujahadeem in an attack on a Russian airbase.  (It is kind of embarassing in a way.  This film made in 1987 portrays these Afghan resistance fighters as basically good guys only interested in ousting the invading Russians from their country.  The CIA assisted them in this in supplying them with stinger missiles.  After the Russians left the Majadeem basically evolved into something more sinister: the Taliban.)  After this terrific action sequence, there is a better one of Bond fighting the villain's main henchman while hanging from the cargo net of the Russain plane Bond has stolen.  (Compare this great action scene to the mediocre action sequence involving Bond in a plane in the latest Bond film, ""Quantum of Solace.)  One of the weaknesses of this film is the lack of a great leading lady.  Maryam D'Abo (whom Bond falls head over heels over) is kind of cute, but cannot compare to some of the Bond leading ladies of the past.  (I work in Manhattan and see dozens of more attractive women virtually every day.)  On top of that, she is really the only girl in the film.  (When it came to leading ladies, Dalton got some of the weaker ones.)
Speaking of Dalton, as I said in a previous review, he gets condemned for the same things Daniel Craig gets praised for.  He took the role very seriously and could not throw out any of the one-liners the masterful way Connery or Moore could.  The one thing Craig has over him is sheer physicality, particularly in the fight scenes.  However Craig may be the most physical Bond ever.  Another positive of ""The Living Daylights"" is that it features the last great John Barry Bond movie score.
""The Living Daylights"" opened in the summer of 1987 and did very well.  The next Dalton Bond ""License to Kill"" opened two summers later against some stiff competition: ""Batman,"" ""Lethal Weapon II,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" etc. etc.  It opened at number 4!!! its first weekend and did very poorly in the U.S.  There was a six year hiatus due to litigation and when Bond returned in 1995 with the terrific ""Goldeneye,"" Dalton was gone and Pierce Brosnan was Bond.
However I will stack his two Bonds against Daniel Craig's.  ""Living Daylights"" was a solid Bond and ""License to Kill,"" one of my favorites.  And while I think Craig's ""Casino Royale"" is a classic, his second Bond ""Quantum of Solace"" was a major disappointment.
One the the film critics, (Ebert I think) named Dalton's Bond ""Bland, James Bland.""  However if you have not seen his two Bond films, you should check them out.  You will be surprised just how good they are.
I look forward to the release of ""The Living Daylights"" on blu-ray.",1268006400,2,3672,4.597542242703533

467126,2,6302380294,"""The Living Daylights"" is a disappointment for several reasons. The biggest reason is the surprisingly unengaging plot. The second reason is that Timothy Dalton doesn't seem comfortable playing James Bond. He's not a bad actor but instead of making his own interpretation of the character (like he did in the next movie, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Licence-To-Kill/dp/B000M53GMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Licence To Kill</a>"") he seems to be imitating Roger Moore. The reason is most likely that the script was written with Moore in mind. Lois Maxwell was replaced by Caroline Bliss as Miss Moneypenny and she didn't seem right for the part at all.

""The Living Daylights"" was not a good start for Dalton. Luckily the series did improve.",1203120000,4,781,5.850877192982456
467127,5,6302380294,"As with George Lazenby, the brevity of Timothy Dalton's tenure as Bond - due to years of legal problems and lawsuits between EON and MGM/UA - has led to history merrily being rewritten by the press that once hailed him. Dalton, not the lawyers, was lined up as the fall guy with Pierce Brosnan the man who saved the series from disaster (even though Dalton's first Bond saw a massive increase in takings over Moore's last film). Those who are quick to dismiss him would do well to check out The Living Daylights.

Much of the scapegoating of Dalton seemed to come from the confusion of actor and role. At the time Dalton's Bond was the closest to Fleming's creation - more so than Connery, even - and given the right script he proved outstanding in the role. After Roger Moore's 12-year, seven-film tenure as Bond finally came to an ignominious end with A View to a Kill, as with OHMSS, Live and Let Die and Casino Royale, the producers broke in their new Bond with a more low-key, low-gadget approach, resulting in the best Bond since the Sixties, with Dalton initially looking the first Bond to seriously rival Connery. Where Connery had the danger and Moore the class, Dalton managed to combine both, with Bond's self-assurance that verges on the arrogant down pat, reclaiming the character from the increasingly comic-strip approach of too many of the later Moore films.

The film isn't without its faults - Caroline Bliss isn't up to much as Moneypenny, Maryam D'Abo's a bit of a wet leading lady while Jeroen Krabbe lacks the menace he brought to No Mercy - but it looks and feels like a classic Bond film, has little truck with gadgets and is less in thrall to silly jokes. Best of all, it's got a plot (involving a dubious defection, Mujahadin opium smuggling in Afghanistan and a re-activated Stalinist spy assassination programme). The political background may have dated - this was filmed when the Communists still held the USSR together and when the Mujahadin were the good guys - but it still comes up remarkably fresh. This is Bond with all the stops pulled out but without the overkill. The production values are superb and visually it's a treat, especially in widescreen, with John Barry making his final Bond score his best in years. The action scenes are often outstandingly good, with a return to the kind of good old vicious punchups that vanished in the latter Moore years and as well as some amazing stunt work involving a Russian troop plane and it has one of the series' best pre-title sequences, with a security exercise in Gibraltar turning into the real thing. The makers even have the confidence to remove Bond from one of the key setpieces - a superbly staged kidnapping from a safehouse, which runs nearly a full reel. John Glen's direction is so spot-on here it's hard to see why it would go so horribly wrong on Licence To Kill.

The extras package is excellent, including audio commentary, an extended scene and the infamous deleted `magic carpet' sequence, a bad idea that feels like a holdover from the Roger Moore era that was thankfully dropped due to the stunt looking distinctly unimpressive. There are enough new features on the two-disc Ultimate edition to make an upgrade worthwhile for the more ardent Bond fans - several promo featurettes from the original release, a press conference held in Vienna and 47-minute TV special `Happy Anniversary 007.'

467129,4,6302380294,"Two years after the final Roger Moore Bond film ""A View To A Kill"", ""The Living Daylights"" has changed the tone of the Bond franchise.  Timothy Dalton being the biggest reason, but everything about this movie is more edgy and punctual, with agressive action and a soundtrack that keeps things moving.

Timothy Dalton is one of my favorite Bond's, and if he had the opportunity to be in more than just two films, he may have even become my favorite Bond.  In a way he can be compared to the most recent Bond - Daniel Craig.  Though not nearly as tough as Craig, Dalton brings a very stately tune, with little time for goofing around (unlike Roger Moore) and gets straight to the point.  His physical appearance is absorbed by the camera, and even his voice is quite strong and fitting for the role.  One could say he is even a more mature Bond, limiting himself to one girl in this movie, and even being a little romantic.

The story in The Living Daylights is rather involved and perhaps somewhat confusing - at least for awhile.  It definelty requires your attention and keeps you guessing.  This is the last of the films during the Cold War era, and again we have Russia as a major part of the plot in the film, including another KGB henchman to give Bond some good fights as always.  Pacing was about typical for a Bond movie, as some moments were slow and others were action packed - and when the action gets going it just doesn't stop.

Music is very important to any movie, and the soundtracks to the Bond films has always been a big factor.  In The Living Daylights, the score has more of a modern feel with a beat that compliments the action quite well.  In prior Bond films, most of the time the music throughout the movie was an orchestral rehash of the opening song (which is fine) but here it expands on that quite a bit.  Speaking of the opening song, I rather enjoyed the title song ""Living Daylights"" by Ah-ha.  Its very 80's sounding, but upbeat and gets me in the mood for the film every time.

The action is actually more realistic this time around, but harder.  We don't have any huge unrealistic action scenes from movies such as Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, or View To A Kill, but more down to Earth simple chases and fights that keeps things real, yet strong and engaging.  If there is a huge and intense action scene in this film, it would easily have to be the fight between Bond and the KBG man, hanging off a net off the back of a cargo plane in mid-air.  The scene was shot well, choreographed decently, and put to fitting music.

Locations are not as exotic as they could have been, but Bond does travel to a  variety of countries including Czechoslovakia, Austria and Afghanistan.  Climate changes from snowy mountains to hot desert thoughout the film too.  My favorite scene location-wise, has to be the pre-credits scene at the island of Gibraltar.  The shots of the double O's parachuting from the plane to the island are quite nice, as is the following scenes of intense action to set-up the rest of the film.

Not only is Timothy Dalton a refreshing and welcoming sight to the franchise, The Living Daylights has the feel of something new and refreshing too, but still keeping all things Bond intact at the very heart of it all.

Suffice it to say that I could rest easy: Dalton makes an impressive Bond debut in ""The Living Daylights"", making him the best actor in the role since Sean Connery.

The plotting is classic Bond too as the secret agent delves into the defection of a KGB general who may have unsavory connections to a ruthless military arms dealer, played with boorish menace by Joe Don Baker. The gadgetry is cool but kept in check as the film is Bond all the way, engaging in great action sequences...and taking time to romance the latest Bond lovely (a beautiful blond Russian cellist).

The series gets an injection of energy from having someone new in the role, with the tired feel of a rehash seen in the previous Moore movies evaporating as we see the actor do the stunts and get his teeth into the new role.  In particular, John Barry has delivered a new, fresh sound to his familiar themes and his final Bond score is arguably one of his best.  Another Bond veteran, director John Glen, is clearly enjoying the change of pace and has put together some terrific set pieces - the pre-titles sequence in Gibraltar is one of the best, the aerial stunts hanging off the plane are standout, and it's a joy to see the Aston Martin back, loaded with gadgets.
On the down side, this was a movie written before a decision was made on who would fill Bond's shoes, and too much silliness has been held over.  Dalton plays the action man with conviction, but his attempts to deliver quips are so flagged and forced that there are moments when you wish Moore was there to show him how it should be done.  Crucially, if a Bond movie is as good as its villains, then this one fails dismally, with few acting worse as a Bond villain than Jeroen Krabbe.  Joe Don Baker as an arms dealer is also a woefully bad idea, giving the core of the movie an unconvincing tone.  Only the killer Necros, played by the dancer Andreas Wisniewski feels worthy of a Bond villain, in a role which is otherwise an underwritten rehash of Robert Shaw's character in From Russia with Love.
Timothy Dalton may not have rocked the world as Bond, the film is too long, and feels oddly neutered as political correctness police start to influence Bonds course just a bit (ironic, given the highly embarrassingly anachronistic Afghan politics portrayed!) but this is a great fresh start and stands above much of what has gone before in the previous decade.

Sound is clear and well mixed in dts mode, and picture is as clear as ever showing the occasionally quite impressive photography to good effect.  Extras are overflowing, with the Special Edition's generous features all present, as well as more deleted scenes (the flying carpet scene is fascinating to watch but thank goodness they cut it!), vintage features celebrating 25 years of Bond, and interviews with D'abo and Dalton.  Deleted footage comes with John Glen's ever informative comments.

All in all a terrific package which lifts an otherwise already above average Bond film which is starting to show a little age.",1195516800,,2993,4.607142857142857
467132,1,6302380294,"I'm stunned by the outpouring of positive reviews on this page.  Am I the only one to notice that this is a terrible film???

Dalton simply doesn't work as James Bond.  I'm sure he's a good actor, but he isn't right for this role.  He lacks charisma, has no screen presence, and his approach to playing Bond with no sense of humour whatsoever makes his performance very dull to watch.  I respect that he was trying to redefine the role after the Roger Moore overdid the humourous aspects of the character, but Dalton gives us a Bond with no panache or sense of enjoyment in his job as a superspy.  Come on, audiences don't watch Bond films for weighty dramatic gravitas -- this series is about sexy, action-packed escapism!  Dalton fails as Bond completely.  (And he's too short.)

Other than a mis-cast Bond, the movie does show some signs of life.  The plot is pretty good, with the Russian defection and counter-intelligence maneouvering, etc., the action sequences deliver, and the exotic locales are everything we would expect from the Bond franchise.  The villains are a little generic, however, and the Bond girl is little more than an attractively attired block of wood.  Would it have killed the script-writers or the actress to give this character a personality?  Oh well, at least she gets lots of practice at doing her doe-eyed look and following Bond around like a puppy.",1194307200,8,1384,4.764705882352941

The villains are somewhat underdeveloped, but the underlying Soviet-Afghan conflict helps construct a multifaceted plot.  Russians allied with Bond, renegade Russians against Bond, Mudjaheddin (sorry I can't spell) fighting all the Russians, American arms dealers who are indifferent to Bond per say but are evading the CIA which is also allied with Bond.  Not to mention that cellist who shows up, gets rescued in an unbelievable car chase with all the usual tanks, missiles, and lasers, and inevitably falls in love with Bond.

467202,3,6302380294,"The first of Dalton's double-bill as 007 is a merely above-average affair. The one thing that really stops TLD from being a better film is the fact that it's just too tame. This was the last Bond film to be given a PG rating as it was clear that they couldn't appeal to the family audience any longer. With a new Bond should have come a new approach. Yes, it does feel more modern and realistic but since the script was originally designed for Moore they missed a chance at taking advantage of Bond's dark side. Thankfully, they did exactly that in Licence to Kill.

Ian Fleming's story had Bond on a sniping mission, detailing every characteristic and moment of his assignment. Upon spotting the person he's been ordered to kill he discovers it's a beautiful woman and chooses to wound her instead of killing her. Wishing M to fire him for disobeying orders he comments that he must have 'scared the living daylights out of her'. The story ended on this note. The film expands this premise and has Bond escort a defecting Soviet agent from Russia only to disbelieve his story of a Russian General going berserk. Upon investigating further he discovers a plot involving the Mujhadeen and an American Arms dealer. Despite these complications and developments, there's just not enough killing! Without meaning to sound bloodthirsty, I just think that Bond should have laid waste to more bad guys. The script doesn't really give him a chance to. And, as a result, the film seems watered-down and too broad.

Director John Glen stages and frames the action very well, as always but it's John Barry's score (his last involvement with the series) that gives it that extra punch. The Bond theme, so incredibly worn-out and done-to-death, is given a new spin, a faster tempo and more modern feel. Despite being about nine when I first saw it, this is the first thing I realized. They ruined a lot of potential by not taking this renewing further and not giving us a tougher film.

Of Dalton's reign as 007, Licence to Kill is definitely the superior film, but don't rule-out Living Daylights. Average it may be, but still far from being anywhere near bad.

The Blu-ray features a gorgeous 2.35:1 1080p and a great DTS HD-MA sound design. Extras are plentiful.",1177286400,,2251,4.7201017811704835
467203,3,6302380294,"I've known the theme tune for ages now, and can even spot the intro now when the Aha video has been shown on TV, before ""Living Daylights"" comes up. Although the first time I heard it, I didn't think it was the lead singer from Aha, I thought it was David Bowie! Whoops.

My Dad always says the first Bond you see, is normally the one you like the best. So far, I've seen two Bond films both with Timothy Dalton. I do think I would like Sean Connery (he is Scottish, I have to say that!), but I have to say, out of the two films I've seen, I do like Timothy Dalton! He's the fourth actor to portray the suave Bond.

For a soppy romantic like myself, it's nice to see a little bit of romance in this, with Maryam d'Abo playing the cellist Kara. It's a very gradual relationship too, so that makes the difference too.

I took four years of history at school, but really it should have been renamed ""Second World War Class"", as I knew nothing about the Cold War, and has to be embarrassed into asking what it was, cos I feared I wouldn't understand the film.

The action scenes in this are absolutely top notch from the start to the end. There's a car chase, a chase down a mountain riding on a cello case, the rooftop chase in Morocco and the cargo net fight at the end of the film.

The only problem I have with Living Daylights is the bad guys. For me, they were instantly forgettable, and there was really no reason why they were doing what they were doing. Bad guys should light up the screen and be memorable. And Art Malik didn't have enough screen time in my opinion.

It's still only my second Bond film, and it looks like I have a lot of catching up to do with the amount of Bond films. But they do seem to have a very formulaic plot, which could end up being disappointing. But I do like Timothy Dalton though.",1177286400,,1818,4.165242165242165

He was not the hard edged civil servant but more of a thinking man's blunt instrument as he demonstrated his reluctance to get the job done ""their"" way as opposed to ""his"" way.

John Barry delivered his last 007 score and it is one of his best. I also enjoyed a-ha's rich and lyrical theme song played over Maurice Binder's main titles, which are very reflective. This was also the last Bond film made during the actual cold war. We see a much more intelligent British agent discern that the KGB is not made up of a bunch of hoodlums but instead it is actually headed by an equally intelligent counterpart to ""M"" and the like.

467205,3,6302380294,"I just watched this movie for the first time in ten years, or more.  I hadn't remembered a thing about it, and so it was like I'd never seen it before.  I was rather disappointed in it.  Living Daylights is the first Bond movie after Roger Moore.  While it is better without Moore than it would have been with him, it was still a lame action spy film.  I don't think Timothy Dalton hurt the film any, but he wasn't as impressive in Living Daylights as he was in his subsequent Bond flick, License To Kill.  He seemed like almost a non-entity.  As I mentioned, it was better than having Roger Moore for yet another ho-hum performance.

In Living Daylights' opening action sequence, Bond is participating in a double 0 training exercise, when things go awry.  Bond manages to bring death to the bad guy, and the action leads to the main part of the story. We are introduced to a new M, who is rather bland.  We also get a new Miss Moneypenny, who has virtually no part at all, though she is a cutie.  Bond's job is to help a Russian general escape to the West.  He is also expected to kill a Russian sniper.  Naturally, the sniper turns out to be a beautiful concert celloist, and Bond cannot bring himself to kill her, but not because of her beauty.  He has a hunch that something is amiss.  He gets the general out of the country, only to have the general ""renabbed"" by the Russians, and the hunt is on.  Bond is then detailed with the double burden of finding the general and killing another Russian general, an act which Bond finds unnecessary.

The film starts out okay, and I thought I was on my way to a different experience, but it soon turns into another of the many disappointing Bond films made since Roger Moore took the helm.  It's recycled junk.  The same old tired scenes, the same flash, though less gimmicks. It was a bit more dramatic than it was comedy, as in the eight or so Moore films, but it just wasn't what it could have been.  The only thing that saves this film is that Moore isn't in it.",1175299200,3,2013,4.317333333333333
467206,4,6302380294,"The mystery of how well the new Bond would replace Roger Moore in the fifteenth ""official"" Bond movie was over with ""The Living Daylights.""  The style of the movie was set with the opening scenes, where three double-0 agents parachute onto Gibraltar as part of an infiltration exercise.  Unfortunately, someone in the exercise is using real ammunition, not paint balls.  Timothy Dalton shows that he is made of Bond material as he jumps onto an escaping jeep and fights with the bad guy as the jeep full of explosives catches fire, flies off a cliff, and explodes, with Bond having departed in a typically clever fashion but moments before the fireball erupts.

Timothy Dalton was a no-nonsense Bond in this movie.  He eliminated the numerous one-liners that seemed to be a Roger Moore characteristic in favor of a leaner and meaner and much more spy-like Bond.  In this first of two Bond movies Dalton had yet to achieve the presence and technique of either Sean Connery or Roger Moore, but he breathed new life into the series.

The plot bears some characteristics of ""A View to a Kill"" in that both films portray the Soviet Union as a friendlier nation beset with evil doers who would take advantage of the kinder, gentler, Soviet Union.  This time the criminals are looking to do a novel sort of bait and switch, profiting by buying drugs from Afghanistan and selling them in the Soviet Union.  Unfortunately, the money belongs to the Soviet Union.

Mixed into this plot is a Soviet defector, KGB General Koskov (Jeroen Krabb&eacute;).  Bond's mission was to get Koskov out of East Germany and into Berlin.  However, it appears that someone wants Koskov dead, as a beautiful assassin attempts to kill Koskov as he attempts to defect.  Bond has a chance to kill Kara Milovy, well played by Maryam d'Abo, but he elects to shoot the gun from her hand instead.

The plot thickens during the debrief of Koskov.  Koskov tells British agents that General Leonid Pushkin, played by always excellent actor John Rhys-Davies, is executing a program to eliminate Britain's secret agents.  Unfortunately, KGB appears to retrieve Koskov from the English estate safe house and the British agents are unable to learn more.  Bond turns to Kara Milovy.  Bond leads Kara to believe he is going to get her out of the country to meet Koskov, her patron.  However, Bond has yet to learn where Koskov is.

What follows is an action-packed movie that is nicely plotted and interesting to the end.  There is an excellent battle scene in Afghanistan (filmed in Morocco), and an even better escape scene from Afghanistan.  After all that action there remains one loose end to tie up, which Bond does nicely.

During the film we meet another excellent supporting actor, Art Malik as Kamran Shah, an Afghani chief.  We also meet Joe Don Baker as self-centered Brad Whitaker.  There is yet another version of Felix Leiter, this time a less than memorable version of Leiter.  Caroline Bliss is a mediocre version of Miss Moneypenny.

The special effects were much more down-to-earth versus those in ""A View to a Kill.""  The ubiquitous Aston-Martin returns with rockets, rocket boost, outriggers, and sundry other gadgets.  There is a sliding glass door used as a weapon by an assassin.  The same assassin also uses a headset as an assassination tool.  This film also featured exploding milk bottles.  The way Koskov escapes from East Germany is excellent for at least a couple of reasons, including the use of a Harrier vertical takeoff jet.  In general the special effects were well done and believable.

There are a few moments where I noticed some scene glitches.  It appeared that in the final scenes of the movie that there were places where the four-engine C-130 Bond was flying had two engines.  In another scene in the plane Bond looks out the left window and we see fuel leaking from a tank.  However, the bullet holes are on the opposite side of the tank from the window.  Perhaps Bond also has x-ray eyes.  In yet another scene Kara drives a jeep up the ramp of the C-130, which is impossible due to the configuration of the C-130's ramps.  However, these minor errors can be forgiven as the quality of the rest of the movie is excellent.

This two-disk set includes a massive array of features, many of which are interesting, some of which are not.  I tend to find these features valuable, but then again I have watched these movies many, many times.

Keeping with the trend of having current musical artists perform the title song, A-Ha sings ""Living Daylights.""  A-Ha was popular in Europe at the time, and had a huge hit in the United States with ""Take on Me.""

467207,4,6302380294,"Timothy Dalton became the fourth actor to portray James Bond... Having replaced Roger Moore, Dalton's appearance on the scene inspired a sharp reversal of policy in the approach to Bond's films... Moore's comfort with witty lines, light comedic situations, and fantasy plots was replaced by a hard-edged reality and some violent episodes that were better suited to Dalton's more realistic approach to the character of 007...

Dalton has the perfect Bond qualities... He's good looking, athletic, commanding... He's believable as a British secret agent with a license to kill, who can bed any lady he wants... Dalton's debut in ""The Living Daylights"" is astonishing... His first close-up on the Rock of Gibraltar is riveting as he spies the death of a fellow agent... His arrival via parachute onto the yacht of a playgirl is equally perfect... There is no hesitation in his performance...

But unfortunately, the problem with ""The Living Daylights"" is its lack of strong villains... General Georgi Koskov (Jeroen Krabb) is too nice to be dangerous (he hugs practically everyone he meets), and Brad Whitaker (Joe Don Baker) is denied enough screen time to develop any true malice... He's a gunrunner who likes to play with army toys...

The only truly villainous character in the film is Necros, played effectively by Andreas Wisniewski... But he's not on-screen long enough to make any true impact, and even he has his sympathetic moments... The plot is another throwaway because just as you're starting to figure out why Koskov and Whitaker are partners, the plot switches to a big drug deal in Afghanistan...

Maryam D'Abo is the perfect mate--an elegant, well-mannered, soulful woman dedicated to her musical craft, who is drawn into the adventure of a lifetime...

Romance, a key element missing from many of the Roger Moore James Bond movies, is present in ""The Living Daylights"" in large doses as a definite on-screen chemistry develops between Bond and Milovy... It's helped, of course, by the fact that both characters spend a great deal of time together on-screen... Not since ""Thunderball,"" ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" has Bond been given the special time to develop a believable relationship with a woman...

467281,4,6302380294,"""The Living Daylights"" is actor Timothy Dalton's first outing as the British super spy. He replaced Roger Moore, whom I regretfully have never seen in a Bond film. Actually, I've only seen 3 Bond films prior to this one.

(Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, and Diamonds are Forever). One thing most Bond fans agree on is that Sean Connery was the best James Bond.

I'd say that's accurate, but Dalton's approach to the character is far different from what we've previously seen. James Bond is, overall, an under developed character. He's a super-spy who loves martinis and women. In the films I've seen, James Bond is given no back story and shows little human emotion. Don't get me wrong, in this film there's no back-story either...But there is a little emotion. Anyway, the film has a great opening sequence; But, as usual, this sequence has little to do with the rest of the plot. It's merely used to get the audiences pumped for the rest of the story. The story involves Bond being hired as a sniper to protect a Russian officer named Georgi Koskov. Koskov is afraid that he is being targeted by a sniper; Bonds orders are to shoot any sniper he sees that poses a threat to Koskov. Well, Bond does see a sniper. Only the sniper is in the form a beautiful cellist named Kara (Maryam d'Abo, a really hot Bond girl). Making a last minute decision, Bond opts not to kill Kara and instead just wounds her. He then transports Koskov to a remote hiding spot. Koskov is then abducted from his hiding place and it's up to Bond to find him. As he does, with Kara's help of course, he uncovers a semi-complex weapons scheme. The plot is really nothing special, overall, but back to Dalton. In the previous Bond films, Bond usually woos a Bond girl and beds her. In this film, Bond seems to fall in love with her. Of course, there's no exchange of ""I Love You"" here; But the romance is a little different. The action sequences are good and the art direction is fantastic. It's nice to Bond in a normal place, like a fair. The scene where Bond and Kara have to escape from an Afghanistan prison is exciting. The film does have it's spot where it lags, but this is a worthy entry in the series. Hell, it's just nice to see a different side of James Bond. Another thing this film does is show a little more skin then you're used too. All the other Bond films use mere sexual innuendo; In this film, you actually side-nipple.

Dalton makes a quip here and there, and of course he's required to in the scenes with Q.  Otherwise, in situations where Moore would have definitely had a sarcastic remark, Dalton remains silent.

Now that he FINALLY bowed out (after nearly decomposing in OCTOPUSSY and VIEW TO A KILL), the challenge was on to find the NEW James Bond.  Many hoped Pierce Brosnan would step into the role at this point, but alas he was still obligated to being Remington Steele on TV.  Somehow or other, Timothy Dalton got the role - a very odd choice indeed in that he never seemed to really even WANT the part!  Indeed, I would have to grudgingly argue that Dalton is my least favorite James Bond - he just never seemed to own the role the way his other peers did (even Lazenby in his ONE outing).

However, and ironically, his two films were some of the best the series had to offer, beginning with this definite Top Five contender.  TLD represented a return to the more espionage centered feel of the novels, and really only seen in the first two Connery films, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, and Moore's own FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.  The main plot revolves around a power-hungry arms dealer and a secondary plot to assassinate secret agents around the world.  Along the way, Bond hooks up with a would-be assassin and has one of his few on-screen monogamous relationships.  This alone adds to the believability of the film.

Somehow, the producers were able to delve into a rich espionage plot, yet still not skimp on the action.  This film is LOADED with action, including a new gadget-filled car (one of the better ones) and several exciting sequences involving the theft and eventual crash of a transport plane.

The only complaint I have with this film (aside from Dalton himself) is that the villain is pretty weak.  Joe Don Baker just doesn't have the screen presence to be a villain.  Ironically, he returns in GOLDENEYE and TOMORROW NEVER DIES as a good-guy, and fits THAT role much better! Jerome Krabb fairs a little better, but is generally more annoying than anything else.

Marayam D'abo is nice as the Bond girl - attractive AND a good actress as opposed to the usual glamour models that may or may not be able to act (ahem - Barbara Bach - ahem).  This was the first Bond to replace Moneypenny - and the actress chosen was serviceable, but with little of the memorable flair that Samantha Bond has brought to the role in the recent Brosnan films.

All-in-all, and Dalton not-withstanding, this is one of the best of the series, and is a welcome return to a grittier and more believable Bond - Dalton's follow up, LICENSE TO KILL would delve even deeper into the gritty side of Bond - too bad the Brosnan films came along and took us back into Super Bond territory!",1128902400,,2748,4.564154786150713

467287,5,6302380294,"This is without a doubt my favorite movie out of the series.  The Living Daylights is a Bond film that has depth and realism.  The film isn't the typical Bond movie.  It has a hardcore spy plot.  Other films in the series like this includes FRWL and OHMSS.  As an actor Timothy Dalton brought intensity and passion to the role. No other Bond has reacted to situations with human qualities like Dalton did.  For example,  in the fair scene Dalton jumps up abruptly with anger and ready to kill when he finds out that Saunders was murdered. Previous Bonds did not show emotion like this(with the exception of George Lazenby). Dalton's performance made the movie transcend the title of being ""just a Bond movie"".  In some Bond films (especially the Bronsnan entries) the gadgets, the action, the jokes, and the escapades overpower the movie's  plot.  That is not the case with The Living Daylights.  There is a balance between action and plot.  The humor is witty without taking away from the serious nature of the film.  After watching Roger Moore's parody and silliness it was refreshing to watch Dalton take a darker approach in The Living Daylights.  Dalton's monogamous approach also made the film stand out.  Throughout the film Bond stayed with one woman-Kara Millovy (The pre-credits woman doesn't count).  Also, an important aspect to me in a Bond film is a believable down-to-earth villain.  This film accomplished just that.  Necros, Yogi, and Brad Wittiaker made classic intelligent villains.  Cartoonish villains such as Jaws make me disgusted with the series.  In conclusion, if you want parody from a Bond movie watch entries like The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, The Man With the Golden Gun, and Diamonds are Forever. However, if you want to watch a Bond movie with substance watch this movie, License to Kill, From Russia With Love, Thunderball, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service.",1126915200,6,1896,4.921135646687697
467288,5,6302380294,"This was the first Bond film I ever watched, years ago when it premiered on ABC saturday night movies, so I have a soft spot for it. It's still definitely one of the best, with an intriguing plot that actually requires the viewer to pay attention without becoming too convoluted. Probably the most spy-centric story since From Russia With Love. Timmothy Dalton's take on 007 is the grittiest of all the Bond actors so far, and he manages to find a strong balance between realism and the larger-than-life antics of Bond. All the usual Bond trimmings are here too, including the cars, gadgets, John Barry score, and even a new actress as Moneypenny. There are some fantastic action sequences including the opening teaser, a car chase on ice, and a fight on a cargo plane. Dalton only made two 007 films before the series went on hiatus, and this is the stronger of the two. It lacks the dark tone that haunts his follow-up, Licence to Kill, and feels a bit more timeless.

This is also a pretty good DVD. You get a making-of documentary, another documentary on Bond creator Ian Fleming, the retro A-Ha music video of the title song, and a fun deleted scene (probably cut as it seems like a bit of silliness leftover from the Moore years). The bad? No English subtitles, at least on my version. My version also lacks the original burned-in subtitles on an early sequence where a Russian agent seduces her supervisor to provide Bond with a distraction. It's a rather funny one-liner, and I heard MGM corrected this mistake on later pressings of the disc. The Living Daylights still remains one of my favourite Bond films, and is a must-buy for all fans.",1125100800,2,1649,4.647260273972603

As far as the basic standards for Bond movies, this one delivers the goods; beautiful women, explosions, car chases, exotic locations...the works!

467350,4,6302380294,"The mystery of how well the new Bond would replace Roger Moore in the fifteenth ""official"" Bond movie was over with ""The Living Daylights.""  The style of the movie was set with the opening scenes, where three double-0 agents parachute onto Gibraltar as part of an infiltration exercise.  Unfortunately, someone in the exercise is using real ammunition, not paint balls.  Timothy Dalton shows that he is made of Bond material as he jumps onto an escaping jeep and fights with the bad guy as the jeep full of explosives catches fire, flies off a cliff, and explodes, with Bond having departed in a typically clever fashion but moments before the fireball erupts.

Timothy Dalton was a no-nonsense Bond in this movie.  He eliminated the numerous one-liners that seemed to be a Roger Moore characteristic in favor of a leaner and meaner and much more spy-like Bond.  In this first of two Bond movies Dalton had yet to achieve the presence and technique of either Sean Connery or Roger Moore, but he breathed new life into the series.

The plot bears some characteristics of ""A View to a Kill"" in that both films portray the Soviet Union as a friendlier nation beset with evil doers who would take advantage of the kinder, gentler, Soviet Union.  This time the criminals are looking to do a novel sort of bait and switch, profiting by buying drugs from Afghanistan and selling them in the Soviet Union.  Unfortunately, the money belongs to the Soviet Union.

Mixed into this plot is a Soviet defector, KGB General Koskov (Jeroen Krabb).  Bond's mission was to get Koskov out of East Germany and into Berlin.  However, it appears that someone wants Koskov dead, as a beautiful assassin attempts to kill Koskov as he attempts to defect.  Bond has a chance to kill Kara Milovy, well played by Maryam d'Abo, but he elects to shoot the gun from her hand instead.

The plot thickens during the debrief of Koskov.  Koskov tells British agents that General Leonid Pushkin, played by always excellent actor John Rhys-Davies, is executing a program to eliminate Britain's secret agents.  Unfortunately, KGB appears to retrieve Koskov from the English estate safe house and the British agents are unable to learn more.  Bond turns to Kara Milovy.  Bond leads Kara to believe he is going to get her out of the country to meet Koskov, her patron.  However, Bond has yet to learn where Koskov is.

What follows is an action-packed movie that is nicely plotted and interesting to the end.  There is an excellent battle scene in Afghanistan (filmed in Morocco), and an even better escape scene from Afghanistan.  After all that action there remains one loose end to tie up, which Bond does nicely.

During the film we meet another excellent supporting actor, Art Malik as Kamran Shah, an Afghani chief.  We also meet Joe Don Baker as self-centered Brad Whitaker.  There is yet another version of Felix Leiter, this time a less than memorable version of Leiter.  Caroline Bliss is a mediocre version of Miss Moneypenny.

The special effects were much more down-to-earth versus those in ""A View to a Kill.""  The ubiquitous Aston-Martin returns with rockets, rocket boost, outriggers, and sundry other gadgets.  There is a sliding glass door used as a weapon by an assassin.  The same assassin also uses a headset as an assassination tool.  This film also featured exploding milk bottles.  The way Koskov escapes from East Germany is excellent for at least a couple of reasons, including the use of a Harrier vertical takeoff jet.  In general the special effects were well done and believable.

There are a few moments where I noticed some scene glitches.  It appeared that in the final scenes of the movie that there were places where the four-engine C-130 Bond was flying had two engines.  In another scene in the plane Bond looks out the left window and we see fuel leaking from a tank.  However, the bullet holes are on the opposite side of the tank from the window.  Perhaps Bond also has x-ray eyes.  In yet another scene Kara drives a jeep up the ramp of the C-130, which is impossible due to the configuration of the C-130's ramps.  However, these minor errors can be forgiven as the quality of the rest of the movie is excellent.

The special edition DVD includes a deleted scene where Bond rides a flying carpet.  I will leave you to discover how that stunt was performed.  The reason given for its deletion was the length of the movie.

Keeping with the trend of having current musical artists perform the title song, A-Ha sings ""Living Daylights.""  A-Ha was popular in Europe at the time, and had a huge hit in the United States with ""Take on Me.""

There is irony in that the James Bond films are filmed in the same country that is the origin of Dr. Who.  One could start to think that James Bond is like Dr. Who, incarnating as different people over time.  Timothy Dalton was the fourth ""official"" Bond.  Each of the Bonds has had their own style and abilities, and each have generally been well exploited.  Fortunately for viewers, Timothy Dalton's Bond was a more austere Bond, living up to the tradition of the Ian Fleming novels.  He was smart, athletic, and confident without being arrogant.  This Bond movie remains above average for the genre, and enjoyable to watch multiple times.",1114214400,5,5278,4.7502750275027505
467351,5,6302380294,"I am a huge fan of the 007 series. My favorite is Sean Connery, but right below him is the great Timothy Dalton. When he came to the series he added an element that had been missing in this series for about 8 films, and that is emotion. Roger Moore, had brought down the series by turning James Bond into an annoying cartooon character/old man off his medication. Dalton brought heart to the film and brought him closer then ever before to the character of the books.

The story is surprisinly good for a Bond film, having many twists and such. It also features a fantastic cast, the Big bad guy has great charm for a villian, the action is fun, and the girl is good looking. Check out this and the other Dalton film, License to kill.

467352,3,6302380294,"After seven films as agent 007 (one film more than Connery in the official series), Roger Moore left bondage but the series needed time to recover from his smirking, lightweight reign. ""The Living Daylights,"" written before Moore's forced abdication, found his replacement haunted by his ghost.

As James Bond, Timothy Dalton has it all: dark, brooding looks and a theatrical background that makes even big Sean look like an amateur. What he lacked, and what seems to have done him in after only two films, is the humor that had wearingly become the series' trademark during Moore's twelve year stint in the role. Dalton, despite having made his film debut in 1968's ""The Lion in Winter,"" was also a complete unknown to most filmgoers, so his name meant nothing on the marquee. As was the case with George Lazenby in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" James Bond was the sole selling point with this film, and after Moore's last gasp in the dreadful ""A View to a Kill,"" the fabled spy's name had lost much of its luster.

""The Living Daylights"" did decent business in the U.S. (and much better in the U.K.), but proved a less than sterling showcase for Dalton's dirtier, more realistic 007. The villains are a big stepdown from both the glory days of Goldinger and even Christopher Walken's Max Zorin, the one redeeming element of Moore's swansong. Joe Don Baker, who would return to the series twice as an ally to Pierce Brosnan's Bond, lacks the menace he brought to his hitman role in Don Siegel's ""Charlie Varrick,"" and Jereon Krabbe would have to wait six years before making much of an impression in a mainstream film (which he did in ""The Fugitive""). Not only is Maryam d'Abo the dullest Bondgirl in memory, but even the maestro himself, John Barry, misses the mark with a less than memorable score. As for the title song performed by Aha, one of the less pleasant flavors of the month from 1987, it strains to be catchy but only succeeds in being forgettable.

On the plus side, the action is well-staged, there's some great scenery, and Dalton is so perfectly cast that he is the only Bond who might have displaced Connery as the favorite of Bond fans. His next film, ""Licence To Kill,"" would be tailor-made for his more introspective, dangerous Bond, and that film represents a considerable improvement over his debut effort. ""The Living Daylights"" is worth seeing to gauge his considerable potential.

467353,3,6302380294,"Timothy Dalton's first appearance as 007 in the franchise is rather unsteady but decent. Despite Dalton's limitations, Albert Broccoli still managed to have this film made with a good screenplay and a good director.

  The story revolves around the defection of a Soviet KGB officer named General Koskov (Jeroen Krabbe) with information on a Soviet plot to eliminate Britain's MI-6. With orders to dispose of Koskov's superior(John Rhys-Davies), Bond discovers a secret plot between Koskov and an American arms merchant (Joe Don Baker). Bond must race against time to foil the plot and save the world. All of this wouldn't be possible without the help of the traditional Bond babe (Maryam d'Abo) who plays Koskov's musically inclined lover.

  The film is well directed with plenty of action. Dalton tried to make a break with the Bond played by Roger Moore by being a leaner, meaner agent with almost no sense of humor. The script therefore has little of the dry sarcasm so typical to the previous Bond films. Despite these flaws, Timothy Dalton manages to keep up a good performance worthy of several viewings.",1091577600,2,1112,5.016304347826087
467354,5,6302380294,"As a child of the 70's and 80's,The Roger Moore-era  movies defined the tone of the entire James Bond 007 series. When Moore left the series after A View To A Kill,Timothy Dalton took over  and put Bond in a direction that was familiar to readers of Ian Fleming's novels, yet confusing to moviegoers.
 The Living Daylights (1987)brought an end to the tongue and cheek tone of Moore's movies. Instead,Dalton becomes the 007 of the original novels,Tough, ruthless, yet still refined. Dalton  read the original novels and redefined the roll.
Unfortunately,movie goers were a bit uneasy with a James Bond who didn't crack cheesy one liners,jump into bed with an average of three women per movie and harder edged than any other Bond on the screen.
 The movie itself is a fine, yet slow-paced, involving a latter-day cold war defection of a Soviet soldier, only to be turn into a plot involving the elimination of British spies. Great scenes include an escape from the iron curtain in an updated Aston Marten, and an airplane cargo fight in mid air.
 Dalton only portrayed Bond one more time (License to Kill) before the series was in limbo for six years (until Goldeneye with Pierce Brosnan in 1995).Since then, Dalton's portrayal of Bond has been praised in it's approach to bring Bond back to where it all began.",1089936000,8,1309,4.795555555555556
467355,4,6302380294,"The taglines for this, the 15th Bond entry, promised- ""The most dangerous Bond ever,"" and right there beyond the flippant fun that Roger Moore had brought, THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS came and made good on that vow.  In a cool, totally decked-out Aston Martin, our favorite spy propels himself into this, the last of the series' Cold War intrigues (furthermore being the final title penned by its creator, Ian Fleming). And herein, the flavour of Fleming is found everywhere-
Having been a child of 007's Roger Moore era, I had- on some seven different occasions during the course of his 14-year reign as Bond- looked forward with great anticipation to the very heights of fun and adventure.  Moore, with his infectious charm and cheeky wit, was absolutely and completely entertaining as Bond. So I was naturally a little edgy when, in 1987, he retired, to pass the torch to another actor.
I was in college, studying English literature when I heard Timothy Dalton would be the next James Bond.  To me, this seemed an exceedingly interesting choice- for here was a classically trained Welsh actor, who at that time had been fairly unknown.  Yet I already knew him, of course:  not only had he made his impression in some of the Shakespeare plays I'd been studying, but this ardent, sensitive actor had actually won my heart with his perfect portrayals of two beloved Bronte heroes-  (Charlotte's ""Rochester"" and Emily's ""Heathcliff."") Needless to say, I just couldn't wait for this one~~
THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS is a spy thriller in every classical sense.  From the get-go, it's exciting:  the gun-barrel sequence, where John Barry's arrangement pulses more quickly to keep in tempo with the motion of a more youthful 007- the exhilarating pre-credits: where, after a parachute jump onto the Rock of Gibraltar, a double-0 agent gets murdered and Bond jumps onto the roof of a speeding jeep as it hurtles down the cliff, and requites the assassin in like.  He then lands emergently onto a yacht- where, by sheer coincidence, the bikini-clad babe onboard has been lamenting her failure to find any ""real men"" anywhere. Bond grabs her phone to call headquarters, introducing himself with a brisk offhand, ""Bond, James Bond"".  She offers him champagne and, as a consequence, he's an hour late reporting back........
After opening credits - Maurice Binder's flowing artwork gracing John Barry's title song- (a colorful pop number performed by Ah-Ha that won't ever let you forget it's the 80's), Bond reports to Bratislava for a seemingly unrelated assignment.  Saunders, of section V, Vienna (Thomas Wheatley) has arranged the defection of a top KGB agent, Georgi Koskov (Jeroen Krabb).  Bond is called in to kill the sniper assigned to assassinate Koskov if he should try to bolt. -This scene makes up the whole of Fleming's short story, wherein our hero turns over in his mind the conflicting implications of his work.  Well, it's apparent that this James Bond is definitely a man who, though despising certain aspects of his profession, is quite capable of killing an enemy sniper in cold blood.  The sniper, however, turns out being the lovely woman cellist that Bond had only moments before been admiring.  And Bond, who follows instincts before orders, observes, ""that girl didn't know one end of a rifle from the other,"" and instead of killing her, shoots the weapon from her hand.
Nevertheless, the coup is a grand success.  Hours later, in a safe house on the English countryside- (wherein Bond shows himself to be a connoisseur of good food: ""The foie gras is excellent,"" and champagne: ""The brand on the list was questionable, so I took the liberty of choosing something different."") -Koskov reveals a sinister plot by General Pushkin (John Rhys-Davies), the head of the KGB, to kill foreign spies- (""Smiert Spionen,"" Fleming's SMERSH term meaning death to spies).  Bond is immediately a little skeptical of Koskov's story, and his suspicions are further enhanced when, shortly thereafter, Koskov gets snatched out of Britain by forces unknown -pulled off by henchman Necros (Andreas Wisniewski), disguised as the most menacing milkman one could ever imagine. For answers, Bond returns to Czechoslovakia to investigate that female ""sniper,"" and discovers she's Kara Milovy (Maryam d'Abo), Koskov's girlfriend.  He then poses as Koskov's friend in the hope that she'll be able to locate him.
The inertia of this complex plot carries Bond further, through a number of beautiful locales in the world- London, Vienna, Tangier, Afghanistan, and New York.  His mission involves drugs, deceit, diamonds, eccentric American arms dealer Brad Whitaker (Joe Don Baker), and the Afghan resistance, Mujahadin.  There's action aplenty - highlights being a car chase in the Aston Martin fully armed, a ski chase downslope in a cello case, and a seat-gripping airplane ride I'd never in a million years want to ride!
The late 80's had safe-sex everywhere afoot - even in Bond.  Kara's certainly endearing as the Bond girl, but she doesn't hold the screen next to Bond so well as many of her predecessors.  The villains are undeniably wonderful:  a swarthy combination of the fearsome and the ludicrous.  And Dalton's tough, gritty Bond is as close to Ian Fleming's creation that any actor has come- yet whether or not that's a good thing is a matter of infinite debate.  The cinematic Bond had already been well established by then.  Like Connery, though, Dalton has a certain cat-like grace, albeit minus the twinkle in his eye. And though he brings an intensity to the character that even Connery could not own, he never really does let loose - never hams it up or has the famous fun that every other Bond has had!  But notwithstanding all that, I'm forever disposed to find him perfect.",1086566400,56,5769,5.0073221757322175

The Aston Martin is back in all of its glory. Q sequences are great also.  This film has a great story that makes u watch it to try and figure it out, while being treated to a great amount of action.  My only complaint about the movie is the main villin doesen't have that BAD GUY feel to him at all, but maybe it just adds more realism to the movie that these guys are more human bad guys, rather then mad men trying to take over the world. Necros, the main henchman actuly does a lot of stuff in the film. Probley the most a henchman has ever done in a bond movie.  Great film, Great action. IF ONLY DALTON MADE MORE THEN 2 BOND FILMS.

467429,4,6302380294,"With Timothy Dalton replacing Roger Moore as James Bond, the franchise embarks on a new and welcome direction.  Taking advantage of Dalton's tougher and more serious personality, ""The Living Daylights"" returns to the more authentic style and tone of the Bond novels and early movies, and in doing so recaptures the spirit of Ian Fleming.  This was Dalton's original idea behind his portrayal, and the producers chose wisely to back it up.  Rightfully so the DVD includes a wonderful documentary with Fleming as the subject.  As a result of this renewed approach, the series once again shifts its focus to the Cold War (albeit it nearing its twilight), and the themes of espionage and political intrigue that have distinguished some of the better Bonds.  In turn, the action becomes much more realistic and intense than that of the Roger Moore era, with fantastic stunts to be found all around.  It's not a perfect film; it's biggest weakness being it's apparent lack of a truly menacing villainous presence.  But it's a wonderful breath of fresh air after the Moore years and succeeds on most counts.  John Barry contributes his final score to the franchise, beautifully updating the sound to reflect the late 80's, and collaborates with Norwegian rock group a-ha to deliver a good, underrated title song which has been unfairly bashed by many.

In only one try, Dalton hit his stride as the quintessential English gentleman secret agent with a license to kill and he had displayed tremendous potential to be a staple like Connery and Moore.  Sadly, Dalton became a short-timer like George Lazenby when he simply stepped down and Brosnan had taken the torch and hasn't let go ever since.  However, Dalton makes the most of his tenure in The Living Daylights, making this particular energetic Bond flick as one of the best, yet most underrated 80's Bond movie.
The plot has some twists and turns and excellently written and excellently executed.  After a riveting, no-holds-barred opening sequence where his fellow double agents were murdered, Bond sets out to free a KGB officer, General Georgi Koskov (Jeroen Krabbe), a defector who unravels a top-secret Soviet plot called Operation Smiert Spionem, of whom his superior General Leonid Puskin (John Rhys-Davies) had devised.  Koskov is abducted, but it turns out to be nothing but a doublecross, as it turns out he is aligned with an American arms dealer, Brad Whitaker, who wants in on Smiert Spionem, to eliminate all enemy spies including 007.  Hot on their trail, Bond tags along with Koskov's Slovakian cellist girlfriend, Kara Milovy (Maryam D'Abo from TV sitcom, The Wonder Years) and together, they unravel a sophisticated weapons plot.
The Living Daylights is a strong, bold entry in the Bond series.  The only true weak points are the two villains, Koskov and Whitaker.  However, this film revolves around Dalton and his superb performance more than makes up for it.  Dalton is true to form of to the Bond of the Ian Fleming novels, as he is uncompromising, bold, serious, ruthless and he shows a darker side to Bond, more so than Connery ever could.  As professional and instinctive as he plays himself out to be, Dalton shows his softer, romantic side, paired up with Kara Milovy.  Speaking of which, Maryam D'Abo is a refreshing Bond girl as well, as she does not display the toughness and or independence previous Bond girls have and in that regard, she's somewhat of an antithesis to the typical Bond girl.  D'Abo, nonetheless turns in the strongest acting performance of a Bond girl.  As for the storyline, it is sensible, but sophisticated and you could say the oversophistication of the plot is a flaw to the flick.  But the first-rate pulse-pounding action supports the well-thought script.  Noteworthy sequences are the botched Gibraltar training pre-title scene, the Austrian ski chase, and the Afghan desert battle.  All in all, The Living Daylights stands out as Dalton's moment in the sun.",1055376000,11,2785,5.048034934497816
467432,5,6302380294,"The best bond movie ever.  The script, action, and villains are all excellent.  Richard Maibaum's best script since ON her majesty's secret service.  Timothy Dalton is an amazing actor, and the scene in the Prater amusement park is very well directed by John Glen.  The locations are great, they include the rock of Gibraltar, Afghanistan, London, and the very beautiful Vienna.  Maryam D'Abo isn't the best bond girl, but one flaw will not change my opinion.  Better than From Russia with love,Goldfinger, and For your eyes only.  Stays true to Ian fleming's original short story.  Theme song is good and John Barry's score is one of his best.  Picture quality on the dvd is amazing.  Unbelievable how they went from a great movie like this to a horrible one like Licence to kill.  This is the last bond movie that come out that was really good.  I'm not sure there will ever be another good bond movie, let alone better than THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.
Opening scene is excellent. Dalton is the most serious bond, the way he should be.  BROSNAN never came close to being half as good as Timothy Dalton.  All actors in this movie are excellent, and take their roles very seriously, not like previous Moore entries",1054684800,5,1208,4.717703349282297

This is the man, along with the production crew behind him, that brought respectability back to this franchise. It wasn't about gadgets anymore...it wasn't about stupid, lowest-common-denominator jokes anymore. It was about making 007 a viable, respectable character again, with tight plots that involved mechinations more like those in the REAL world with just a TOUCH of the fantastic to make it interesting.
In this piece, 007 has to deal with weapons and opium smugglers working out of Russia, the US and Afghanistan and there are double crosses all over the place! Even Bond's long time buddy, CIA agent Felix Leiter, isn't sure what he's up to!
Dalton had the look, the acting ability and experience to make this a good, gripping adventure from beginning to end, with none of the silliness that made the Moore movies such a drag. I'm sure, somewhere, Cubby Broccoli is smiling, knowing that, even though Dalton only lasted for two movies, he helped revive a franchise that was ready to roll over and die another day!",1041552000,8,1116,4.848167539267016

""The Living Daylights"" is his first and, though its villains are very forgettable, the action is constantly exciting and Bond's allies are interesting people. Maryam d'Abo makes for a great Bond girl, playing the cellist Kara, who is the girlfriend of Russian spy Koskov. She is young and naive, but brave and noble, making her the perfect Bond chick. The only place the film falters is its weak villains Koskov, Whitaker, and Necros. The worst is Joe Don Baker as Whitaker, an American arms dealer who talks like a Texan. He's too likable to hate and completely unmenacing. Bond offs him easily. But give ""The Living Daylights"" credit.

Unlike Brosnan, who seems to coast through his films bored, anxious to collect his paycheck and move on to roles he finds more stimulating, Dalton rises to the challenge of making Bond a real person, and he succeeds. Living Daylights is a Bond film much more human than the souless stunt show ""Tomorrow never dies"" or the convoluted ""The world is not Enough"". I wish Dalton had made more than two films. The special edition includes some informative documentaries and commentary.",1032998400,8,753,4.669172932330827

There's also a new Miss Moneypenny that (although she doesn't hold a candle to Lois Maxwell, she's good nonetheless.)

467530,5,6302380294,"Timothy Dalton did display a Bond that was totally different from Roger Moore, which is probably why some critics were not too impressed with his performance. But Bond fans who enjoy watching a Bond that doesn't go from one lady to another, who is serious, who shows his emotions, this Bond movie is for you. Who could forget that scene when Bond is meant to kill the sniper but then he realises that the sniper is the cellist. You can see that tension in his face as he worries over killing her. That was pure Dalton.
The song ""The Living Daylights"" sung by A-ha is brilliant: it is highly dramatic but viewers have not mention about the song at the end, ""if there was a man"", which is really heart-warming.
The action in the film can keep you on your toes, especially since Dalton performed most of his own stunts, so it is believable as well. Viewers have mention that the plot can be confusing but compared to some other plots in other Bond films, this one would have be one of the easiest to follow.
""The living daylights"" is a lot less violent than ""Licence to Kill"" so children below 15 should be recommonded to not watch the latter.
To critics who find Dalton boring, are mistaken. With that cruel face and those violent eyes, it would make you wonder what this Bond is capable of doing.
To finish, one viewer mention that it was surprising that Bond and Milovy did not get married, which I agree. But we see in ""Licence to Kill"" that Bond will not intend to marry again after the lost of his wife, Tracy. But still, I do agree with that viewer.",1024444800,10,1553,4.395833333333333

Timothy Dalton is great as Bond, and adds a nice touch to the film with dry wit and charm. And the action is great, with car chases reminiscent of Moore's early films.
There are problems with the film though. There is the lack of a sufficiently meaty villain, but it's made up for with a nice ensemble of other bad guys including John Rhys-Davies. The plot is somewhat over-complicated, but provides some great action and stunts. A solid entry to the franchise, and a great action film to boot.",1018569600,,641,4.5344827586206895

Timothy Dalton brings a new type of Bond to the screen.  There aren't as many hilarious lines by Bond (although I loved after Whitaker asked Bond where the opium was, Bond responded, ""Up in smoke""), but his demeanor is unlike any other.  Joe Don Baker makes an excellent bad guy, Brad Whitaker, but the character should have been used more often, especially in the first half of the movie.  Maryam D'Abo was one of the most attractive Bond girls by far, although her tantrum in Afghanistan was rather childish.  Another great aspect of the movie were the gadgets and the car.  The whistle-activated key ring was creative and Q's ""ghetto blaster"" for the Americans was quite funny.  The car was my favorite, though.  It had many of the standard features: the machine guns and rocket power in the back.  But the laser in the chasis(or ""salt corrosion"" as Bond calls it) and the skies were added bonuses.  The plot had a tendency to go all over the place, but Valentin's debut was memorable and it was one of the more action-packed Bond films.",1015372800,4,1208,4.732057416267943

The plot in this one will keep you guessing up until the last minute. The effects are excellent and the car is possibly the best car to feature in any Bond film,although it is a shame it's only on camera for about 5 minutes!

467597,5,6302380294,"""The Living Daylights"", loosely based on the short story, was certainly the turning point in the Bond movies and broke away from the film series' usual traditions. Dalton plays Bond ruthlessly and seriously, an agent no one should mess with. Moore and Brosnan pale in comparison. This is a performance not seen since the first two Connery films and ""OHMSS"". He leans toward the style from the novels of the character's creator and the results are great. This was the way Ian Fleming intended Bond to be.
The action and dialogue scenes make it clear that Bond has matured and we will never look back at the lighthearted nature of the previous films. Kara is the only Bond girl in the entire movie, but her relationship with 007 is the most realistic in the whole series. The villians are very dull and not interesting at all, but isn't it about time they stop making comic book-like bad guys like Hugo Drax? The only problem is that the story tends to drag at some points.
The movie also has the best Bond score, John Barry's last with a great main theme sung by a-ha, a nice love song and a cool upbeat version of the James Bond theme. ""The Living Daylights"" is probably not going to go down in history as one of the best of the Bond movies (mainly because audiences have been brainwashed by Moore's humorous outings), but it's worth checking out.",1003190400,12,1347,4.5473251028806585

I'm still not crazy about Moore, but Dalton does a good job with the role even if he is somewhat more pedestrian than either Connery or Brosnan.
Plus, I liked the story.  It helped that they brought back the Aston Martin (complete with squeaky brakes). Even though Connery mentions a Bentley in Goldfinger, the Aston Martin is the original 007 ride.  For reasons that are known only to the producers, they put Moore into an American Motors standard issue in TMWTGG (Did they think that because it had the same initials as Aston Martin, it was the same pedigree?), or a Lotus in FYEO.
It also helped that Dalton's relationship with Maryam d'Abo actually developed over the course of the film making it more genuine.

The film has a reasonable plot, some stunning locales and many nifty action scenes. Glen presents us with an interesting plot involving a diamonds for opium scheme between Don Baker and Krabbe during the 'Cold war'. However, there are many scenes wehere the film does lose its flow, this is why I have given the film four stars instead of five. In retrospect,the Welsh-born Dalton is fantastic and seems promising, there is more to come from this actor. Soundtrack is good and is sadly John Barry's final contribution to the film series. All in all 'The Living Daylights' is one of the best Bond films since Roger Moore's 1973 debut. If you're a fan of the JB Aston Martin, Vienna and Mr Bond's sarcastic witticisms then this is the film for you.

467601,5,6302380294,"Timothy Dalton takes over for Roger Moore in this, the 14th official James Bond adventure.  Russian General, Georgi Koskov (Jeroen Krabbe [Immortal Beloved]) wants to defect and it's up to Bond to get him out (in a quite unique way too, courtesy of a pipeline).  Once free he names his superior, General Leonid Puskin (John Rhys-Davies) as being completely mad with power, with plans to hunt down and kill secret agents, including 007.  But why, while escaping, was Koskov targeted for assassination by a female Russian amateur using blanks?  And why would Puskin suddenly turn crazy after years of honorable service?  These are questions Bond must uncover.  This Bond picture is without a doubt the most romantic I've ever seen (and I've seen them all).  For once we don't see 007 putting the moves on many different women.  Here it is just one girl, Kara Milovy, played quite innocently by Maryam d'Abo.  And the romance shines because of it.  You can tell he has feelings for her and it is quite touching.  One can only guess an actual reason why they split up and she does not return for the next film.  This was also the last Bond movie to use the wonderful talents of composer John Barry, and I must say, his last Bond score is brilliant, with just a bit of synthesizer thrown in to add an added touch of flare.  a-ha performing the title song is a triumph.  It's a shame it didn't do as well as Duran Duran's A View To A Kill, because, in my opinion, it's a very well crafted piece and one of my personal favorite Bond songs.  Special note: Joe Don Baker (Brad Whitaker) would go on to play in Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies as CIA agent, Jack Wade.  Like all Bond DVDs, The Living Daylights has quite a nice batch of extras, including a deleted ""Flying Carpet"" sequence, that perhaps looked too silly to keep in the film, though you only see it in a rough print.  With music and tighter editing, it may have been quite fun.  Audio Commentary with director John Glen w/cast & crew is a good listen, if you've got the time.  Mr. Glen's commentaries are always fun and informative and The Living Daylights is no exception.  No Bond DVD would be complete without a documentary and that's what you get with ""Inside The Living Daylights.""  An insightful look into the making of this successful Bond movie, Inside The Living Daylights will give you a good idea of the painstaking process a James Bond movie must go through.  You also get a 2nd documentary all about 007 creator, Ian Fleming, who would never truly know how big his James Bond character would become (Fleming died shortly before Goldfinger was released in theaters).  And finally you get the theatrical trailers, plus the a-ha music video of The Living Daylights (quite fun).

467602,5,6302380294,"12 years of Roger Moore's version of James Bond had desensitized movie-goers to what James Bond really was by 1987.  Bond is a hired killer employed by his government, a man with a larger-than-life job and an incredible amount of ingenuity that enabled him to stay alive in a job that pushed him to his emotional limit.  This is the Bond that Ian Fleming created, and Timothy Dalton was the first actor to portray 007 that had the depth to play Bond the way Fleming designed him.  For a fan of the books, this makes The Living Daylights one of the better Bond films.  It features a relatively believable plot, some real romance, and some real tension and drama.  And the prerequisite action and gadgets that are such a part of the films are still there.

This film was, hands down, the best of the Dalton era films - the only other Bond movie with Dalton being the mildly disappointing ""License to Kill"". Timothy Dalton replaced Roger Moore as agent 007 when the gray haired Moore decided to call it quits after the release of ""A View to a Kill"" in the mid-eighties. Naturally, with a new Bond came a new style. I believe that Dalton's style was the most compensating to Ian Flemming's Bond; he wasn't a super man all of the time. He has moments when doubt or fears enter his mind. In other words, Dalton is a much more realistic Bond than Connery or Moore ever were. Unfortunately for Dalton, however, it seems many people like the unrealistic Bond better than the realistic.
""The Living Daylights"" has a classic story and action. It's one for all Bond fans to definitely see, while being good enough to warrant the attention of first time viewers. No film (except perhaps ""Goldfinger"") has done it better than ""The Living Daylights"".",978393600,,1115,4.752577319587629

The plot is much more sophisticated and believable, as opposed to Bond's last few ventures.  Action is plentiful in this film, but the plot is much more thought out and concentrated on.  The villians are menacing, but a bit more lack-luster than what we have seen in the past. (no one with metal teeth or a decapitating hat.)  Bond has much more heart in this one, and seems a bit more human.  His jokes are more scarce, but they are there.  The gadgets and Q remain the same, and the New Aston Martin rocks. They did not need to replace Money Penny, Caroline Bliss is attractive, but I still prefere the original cause it was tradition.  We are treated to a climatic battle about five thousand feet above Moroco, a deadly drop for which one of Bond's nemesis's will have to meet.  Truely entertaining, in the style of Ian Flemming's original character that appeared in LICENSE TO KILL as well, except this one is a little more humorous and Bond like.  LICENSE TO KILL was drastically serious, and, although entertaining, it was a tough film to watch without a joke in sight.  However, DAYLIGHTS is a perfect blend of all the bond elements.  Based upon Flemming's novelete of the same name, it promotes the safe sex concept of the late 80's.  Bond is a one woman man this time around, but it does not contract from the plot.

Up til' that point I'd only seen OCTOPUSSY and A VIEW TO A KILL - and I think we can all agree that these were two of the worst Bond films in recent memory. Even THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH wasn't that terrible.
And then THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS came along...and blew me away. This was the Bond that I'd been waiting for, it was as though he had leapt from the page onto the silver screen. Dalton portryaed Bond as being cold, ruthless, a true professional, but also with an eye for beautiful ladies. I had a swagger in my step for the next twelve months after watching this film.
I notice that no one has praised John Barry's excellent score for the film. I wasn't too impressed with A-Ha's theme song, I thought that it wasn't tough enough for a Bond film. But Barry turned that rather unimpressive melody into a rousing theme that runs throughout the entire film. He did the same thing with Duran Duran's A VIEW TO A KILL. Now that is the mark of a truly great composer. Bond films were never the same after he stopped scoring them...at least until David Arnold filled his shoes.
It's unfortunate that Timothy Dalton didn't do a third and fourth Bond film. This film came along at a time in my life when I needed a strong male role-model, and Dalton's portrayal of Bond fulfilled that need perfectly. For that reason alone, I think that Dalton's two Bond films are light-years ahead of the current Brosnan flicks. The current producers would do well to emulate and build upon their success.",976233600,11,1602,4.433898305084746

First off, Dalton's 007 is very similar to Connery's.  He's a lethal weapon with little to no conscience (but of course we know he does) whose only concern is accomplishing his mission for queen and country.  He's intense, brooding and noncompromising.  He's a perfect 007 of Fleming's books.  Dalton's 007 has hardly any of the quips and jokes which were a trademark of Moore's franchise.
The film's story focuses on Bond uncovering a Russian General's defection from the former Soviet Republic.  The Russian General soon joins forces with an international arms dealer and Bond then trys to stop them.  I was interested how this Bond installment seemed less like a stereotypical Bond film and more like an action/adventure in the DieHard/LethalWeapon/IndianaJones tradition.  The action is fast paced but less dependent on the typical 007 gadgetry and exotic plot to destroy the world.
That leads to another interesting plot development.  This time Bond beds only ONE girl (excluding the pre-title teaser of course).  This kind of development leads to more credibility to Dalton's performance as he allows Bond to establish a relationship and become just a bit vunerable.  This may have been just a stunt by the producers to move 007 into politcal correctness, but I think it works for the film and makes Bond more interesting.
""The Living Daylights"" is not the best 007 mission, but it is far from the worst.  It's strengths are a more realistic plot, tone and a terrific perfomance by probably the most underappreciated Bond actor; Timothy Dalton.",974505600,,1861,4.926282051282051
467694,5,6302380294,"THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS is one of the better James Bond films. I think it is the best since ON HER MAJESTY's SECRET SERVICE. I really liked Timothy Dalton as James Bond, the James Bond he gave us in this film (THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS). He was not the hard edged civil servant but more of a thinking man's blunt instrument as he demonstrated his reluctance to get the job done ""their"" way as opposed to ""his"" way. John Barry delivered his last 007 score and it is one of his best. I also enjoyed a-ha's rich and lyrical theme song played over Maurice Binder's main titles, which are very reflective. The music video and the making of the video are on this DVD. This was also the last Bond film made during the actual cold war. We see a much more intelligent British agent discern that the KGB is not made up of a bunch of hoodlums but instead it is actually headed by an equally intelligent counterpart to ""M"" and the like. The dark yet richly colored photography and locations bring back much of the feel of the earlier Bond films. Timothy Dalton deserved to be around much longer as James Bond based on his work in this film.",974160000,,1120,4.363636363636363

This film was John Glen's a only poorly directed film, all his others are much better.",972777600,3,404,4.207792207792208

467797,5,6302380294,"With THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS Eon productions returned to the style that made the James Bond films a success in the first place.  Bond classics like FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and FOR YOUR EYES ONLY are the template that director John Glen and writers Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson (who also co-produced the film) used in creating a style to fit new Bond Timothy Dalton.  Dalton's performance comes straight out of Ian Fleming's 007 novels, as he re-read all of Fleming's books before filming TLD.  At times Dalton's performance echoes those of Sean Connery, but with a harder edge befitting a character who has been through as much, and come as close to death as many times as Bond has.  Dalton's Bond is professional, but cynical, while maintaing a suave persona and a subtle sense of humor.  The supporting cast is excellent as well, with Jeroen Krabbe and Joe Don Baker as particular standouts.  The story echoes the decline of the cold war, and leads Bond into a new era where the Soviets are no longer the main threat for Bond to foil (like OCTOPUSSY, TLD features a rogue Russian General acting without the knowledge of his government).  The action sequences are outstanding, and the locations are exotic (as usual), befitting a great Bond film.  The DVD includes the best picture and sound that this film has ever seen, easily surpassing the VHS and LaserDisc versions.  The special features include 2 documentaries, a ""lost"" scene, trailers and TV commercials, and more, making this DVD package a ""must buy"" even if you have already seen the movie several times.  Timothy Dalton brought credibility back to Bond as an action hero, but, sadly, he was to appear in only one more Bond film, the outstanding LICENCE TO KILL.",972000000,11,1728,4.8074324324324325
467798,4,6302380294,"The Living Daylights is one of the best bond movies of the last twenty years. The Living Daylights is an excellent film with an interesting plot, and excellent stunts.  Timothy Dalton does an excellent job playing a more serious Bond, and the movie is a more traditional, Connery type Bond movie.  I recommend this movie for any Bond fan, but would caution casual fans to see the movie before purchasing it, as it seems to be an acquired taste for some folks.
The movie does have two flaws.  First, the movie is aobut 15 minutes too long.  Every time I watch the movie I enjoy it, but get a little restless over the last few minutes.
The second potential flaw is that the plot can be a bit tough to follow.  The plot (without giving too much away) finds James Bond trying to stop an apparent plot by a Russian General to assassinate British secret agents in the hopes of starting a war. Other plot elements include the defection of a high ranking Russian army officer, weapons and drug smuggling, and the Afghanistan-Russian war. All these elements are brought together to form a trickier plot than in most Bond films, which is a good thing in my opinion, but still can be somewhat confusing.
The stunt scenes are also excellent and include parachuting onto the Rock of Gibraltar, a great car chase scene with a ""loaded"" Aston Martin, and a fantastic fight scene outside of a cargo plane (plus about 5 other stunts I don't have time to mention).
Another nice change in this film is a legitimate love affair between James Bond and Kara Milovy (Maryam D'Abo, who is adequate) which is sweet and even romantic. As for the new Bond actor in this film, Timothy Dalton portrays Bond more seriously than Roger Moore and is much more believable as a secret agent than the 50-something Moore. He brings an edge to the character that had not been scene since Sean Connery. The fact that Bond is more believable (not so cartoonish) makes the film more tense and suspensful than most of Roger Moore's later efforts. All in all The Living Daylights is a very solid movie and one of the best Bond films in recent memory (due in part to the weak competition of horrible films such as Octopussy and Moonraker). I would definately recommend The Living Daylights on DVD to any Bond fan as it has been wonderfully remastered with lots of special features (the Documentary on the search for the ""new"" Bond actor is great) and looks as good as new on-screen.",971827200,5,2437,4.580275229357798
467799,5,6302380294,"Timothy Dalton makes a good James Bond because he plays the part with seriousness which creates the drama and tension that makes the audience enjoy the movie. The movie begins with a dramatic high-altitude parachute insertion of Gibraltar, followed by a sudden surprise with Bond chasing a traitor, we don't know why, in fact as the movie progresses we are kept guessing as to who is who until about mid-way. To get to the point where Bond realizes the KGB is not behind a spy war, we travel rapidly across the world with a lovely lady with a cello. We take for granted now, but Dalton's Bond is the inspiration behind the Brosnan Bond films being action and plot hyperactive.
I think we shouldn't rank Bonds, actor or film wise unless the movie is really bad. The disdain many have for the Roger Moore Bond films is actually to the 70s mentality of self-parody and not taking things too seriously when realism is what makes the fantasy work. Moore made 3 fantastic Bond movies; Live and Let Die, The Spy who loved me and Octopussy. In the first, he created the Bond as non-stop action hero. In the second, he created the Sci-Fi/fantasy Bond type movie, and in the last one I highly recommend, an adventure spanning the globe with some unexpected plot twists. Dalton combines the non-stop action, global adventures with early Conneryesque seriousness.
I think many of us who admire the early Connery Bond films must remember they represent a by-gone era of the 60s where spies, the Cold War, JFK, and all the mystique was first created, it would be almost impossible to create a ""retro"" Bond picture unless you actually made it look like the 60s since people today are not like that anymore. This is what makes the whole Austin Powers things so entertaining. I'm just glad Bond has changed with the time as we have!",971049600,,1815,4.657320872274143
467800,5,6302380294,"First of all, this is about 10 times better than Timothy Dalton's second  flick as 007, Licence to Kill, which was a good movie, but didn't quite  make it into my list of fantastic Bonds. The Living Daylights is a  charming, romantic, fast-paced adventure, which, in my opinion can hold a  candle to movies as historic as Goldfinger and From Russia With Love.  Dalton is on top of his career as Bond, and proves right away that he  needed no time to adapt to the character as Moore did (3 movies in  fact).This film starts off with a bang as an unknown madman, part of an  international conspiracy called ""smiert spionem"" (kill spies),  ruins a routine MI6 training session as he kills off several 00 agents,  until getting outrun by 007. The movie itself is centered around an  important KGB defector who doublecrosses the secret service after promising  loyalty, and hooks up with a dirty dealing American arms dealer named Brad  Whitaker (played by Joe Don Baker), who wants to help the KGB defector  finance his ""smiert spionem"" conspiracy. Along with a ruthless  KGB henchman named Necros, Georgi Koskov (the KGB defector, played by  Jeroen Krabbe) fights time and 007 to carry out his whimsical plans. The  movie is equipped with fantastic action sequences such as a chase down an  Austrian ski slope in a cello case, a fantastic mid-air brawl with Necros  and Koskov, and a climatic thriller in Whitaker's villa, where the insane  arms dealer tries to fry Bond in his battle room.
This is a fantastic  movie not only because it has a great plot, great actors, and a great bond,  but because it also has a bond girl who bond seems really attracted to.  Kara Milovy, a Slovakian cellist, seems to have a real romance with Bond,  which is a nice refresher since most Bond fans are used to the classic  ""love 'em and leave 'em"" plot line. All in all, a great movie!!!!  Just for the sake of it, here is my Bond ""gold collection"" list  of 5:
-from russia, with love -goldfinger -the spy who loved me -the  living daylights -for your eyes only",966038400,45,2044,4.602777777777778
467801,5,6302380294,"The Living Daylights is my favorite Bond film. In this adventure, James Bond becomes the pawn in a Russian defector's plot and finds himself in the middle of an international arms and drug smuggling ring.
In the opening  sequence, we see Bond parachuting, dive tackling a fleeing jeep (then  fighting with a KGB assassin in the jeep), and finishing him off in a  mid-air explosion over the water.
Bond is on assignment to aid and  protect a Russian defector (a KGB agent, who ultimately double crosses  Bond).  Bond meets up with the KGB agent's girlfriend traveling from  Czechoslovakia, through Austria, to Morocco, and Afghanistan.  And in the  end, of course, the good guy wins.  Add to this some romance (with just one  girl, for a change), probably the best music score, great action, beautiful  cinematography, and you've got a great James Bond story.
TLD has all the  right ingredients and chemistry between actors.  But what makes this story  line believable is a credit to a superb performance on the part of Timothy  Dalton.  This guy is believable and looks like a professional killer.
TLD  was filmed in Morocco, Gibraltar, Austria, England, USA, EuroDisney, and  Pinewood Studios.

After years of that stick-legged mannequin Roger Moore, it was a revelation to see someone actually giving a performance as  Bond. And there's a whiff of Ian Fleming in the beginning, before the plot  goes off spinning in the usual directions (nice action climax, though).  It's a pity Dalton didn't get a chance to grow into the role and use some  humor; he showed that he had the stuff in ""Flash Gordon"" as the  hero's Robin Hood-like ally.

467804,5,6302380294,"The least conventionally attractive of any of the men chosen to play James Bond, Timothy Dalton has the distinction of being the most dangerous one, the one whom you might associate with the task of covert assassination.  While lacking Connery's warmth of personality or Brosnan's power to charm  and ingratiate, Dalton projects an icy curtness of speech and manner that  suits the story of the film well.  Bond will kill an acknowledged chief of  Soviet intelligence operations, a man whom he knows personally and  respects.
Everyone knows the formula after watching a TBS Seven Nights of  Bond prior to the latest in the series being released: mission defined in  opening sequence, femme fatale and villain introduced, a cocktail party  where protagonist and antagonist sip vodka martinis and glower  meaningfully, good girl ripe for sexual conquest introduced, action  sequence action sequence action sequence, comic ending usually involving  carefully sanitized view of intimacy between Bond and the good girl.
For  much of the film, unexpectedly sharp edges on the formula build tension for  a long-conditioned audience.  When Bond sees the cellist training a rifle  on his defector, the moment of hesitation feels genuine when he receives  the order to kill the sniper, regardless of femininity or beauty.  He  follows the cellist after she is released from interrogation by his  eventual quarry, John Rhys-Davies, and his courtship of her seems the act  that it would have to be to remain objective about the task at hand.  When  his colleague from Vienna is brutally killed by a explosive during an  unguarded moment at a street carnival, his rage is clear and palpable -  none of the others were ever as ferocious as Dalton.
Obviously, it's a  Bond film, so there are enough moments of the ludicrous to satisfy people  who believe that films should be seen with a minimum of consideration of  what is being seen.  It's an excellent opportunity to see elements of the  old Cold War paranoia that fired the success of the originals starring Sean  Connery, with a harder and more uncompromising edge than is typical of the  series.",960336000,5,2137,5.051724137931035

Despite Kell Tyler's Linda Collier in the pretitle sequence, Maryam D'Abo's  dull and colorless Kara Milovy is the only Bond girl in this romp.
As for  Tim himself. He gave a good performance, but it is a performance that  cannot sustain the Bond series for long. He is way too serious and tries to  put Bond back to the way Ian Fleming wrote him...,a mistake considering the  series became successful when the movie made a departure from the novels  (unless it is a good novel, like On Her Majesty's Secret Service, or Dr.  No).

Joe Don Baker who plays Brad Whitaker the principle villain in the plot only gets four scenes. Baker is a well known  actor and didn't deserve to be left out of the picture. It is Koskov played  by Jeroen Krabbe who ruins the plot completely because he acts like a  coward throughout the film and never for a moment gives Bond a chance to  say ""hey were dealing with a maniac here not"". Its a shame that  the writers did not give Whitaker more screen time. He should have been  used during the scenes where Koskov is trading the diamonds for opium  personally making sure that nothing goes wrong. Koskov should never have  been left in overall charge of the mission im sure Necros Whitakers  assassin could have completed the deal by himself. Nercros is the only true  menacing baddie in the film but again he didn't have to many scenes or  (lines)either.

Joe Don Baker plays a great Brad  Whitaker, a weapons and war obsessed arms dealer involved with a russian  general selling arms to Afghanistan.  And the final showdown in Whitaker's  weapons gallery is memorable.

Timothy Dalton makes his first appearance as James  Bond. Although Roger Moore is and always will be my favourite James Bond, I  like Dalton's dark, Fleming-style approach to the proceedings. Other  inspired casting choices include John Rhys-Davies as General Pushkin and  Art Malik as Bond's ally Kamran Shah. Overall, TLD is a thoroughly  entertaining bucket of bubbly 007 fun, and if you've seen Goldfinger, The  Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker (not joking, honest!) or For Your Eyes Only, or  if you're a simple Fleming purist, then you'll love The Living Daylights.",948585600,,1010,5.024096385542169

467988,5,6302380294,"In 1987, a new James Bond was introduced in the guise of accomplished Shakespearean actor Timothy Dalton, following fifteen years of the popular Roger Moore. The vacant part of the ever-smooth superspy had originally  been offered to the present Bond, Pierce Brosnan, but he could not free  himself from his television contract at the time.
Dalton's arrival was  greeted with mixed reviews. Accusations of over-seriousness and dullness  may be open to debate, but one point is certain - Dalton injected an  element of danger into a character which had become predictable and stupid.  After years of the pantomine of Roger Moore, Bond had become a cold  assassin once again.
The complex plot involves Bond assisting the  defection of prominent KGB officer General Georgi Koskov (Jereon Krabbe),  but he is kidnapped by an arms group. Bond who believes that Koskov's  original defection was just an act, seeks out Koskov's girlfriend Kara  Milovy (Maryam D'Abo) to retrieve more information.
The performances are  excellent especially from Dalton, D'Abo and Andreas Wisniewski (as the  killer Necros). Although the movie does not run smoothly from scene to  scene, it is full of good moments and has a 'Lawrence of Arabia' feel to  it.

Sean Connery owns the role of James Bond; no one came as close to his mixture of suave ladies' man, daredevil, nerves-of-steel professional spook as Timothy Dalton.  But Dalton's Bond has a soft side, and a gritty dislike of certain aspects of his job that Connery's Bond didn't explore. Dalton's Bond is closer to the Bond created by British writer Ian Fleming.  This is a Cold War thriller, with the usual terrific villains, Jereon Krabbe playing a sinister supposedly kidnapped Russian general with great eclat.
I totally disagree with the rotten tomatoes 71% rating of this Bond movie.  All Bond movies have unbelievable stunts and story arcs that veer off  a little, but in this case it's very entertaining.  Dalton's sweet romance with cellist Maryam D'Abo (Kara) goes beyond the usual Bond cold-blooded passion -- he really cares for her.  Joe Don Baker is a gun-crazed arms-dealer villain, while a handsome Arab prince (Art Malik) is Bond's ally.  Hey, it's 1987.  We were on Afghanistan's side.  Can you tell I love this movie?  My kids even gave me the vinyl soundtrack, by a-HA (who???).",1519948800,,1178,4.928934010152284
7825696,5,6302380294,"Roger Moore left the James Bond franchise decently, and as one door closes a new one opens in Timothy Dalton, a spectacular James Bond. Regarded by plenty of Bond novel readers as one of the most true to life and loyal versions of James Bond. More serious than Moore but still a suave and debonair British spy with a License to Kill.

This story is a nice start for Dalton as James Bond involves himself with a defecting Soviet general, an arms dealer and an assassin in a conspiracy out to discredit the new KGB director. A complex plot, but not complicated. Even though the Cold War is coming to an end it still makes for a great story. Feels like a good spy story but also a Bond adventure. An adventure going from Spain, Czechoslovakia, England, Austria, Morocco and Afghanistan. Lovely lady in Maryam d'Abo and many of the gags and action that one expects.

One of my favorites and the best Bond outing for Timothy Dalton.",1517702400,,927,4.511904761904762
