2680534,5,B000JZ4UNO,Chanlene once again has killer music to workout to and tough but easy to learn and follow moves. You don't just have to have the tube to workout with you can also use free weights as well. You get upper and lower body workout. I recomend with product for a toning workout!,1226275200,3,272,4.25
2680535,5,B000JZ4UNO,"It is quick but strenuous.
You can use just weights if that is all you have.
I mix it up with a little of both.",1400025600,,111,3.48
2680536,5,B000JZ4UNO,"I'm a ""Turbo Jam"" fanatic, I have the five dvd workouts, so the ""Totally Tubular"", well just had to have it! I liked it a lot.
I usually didn't like workout bands, I'm also a BIG Tony Horton fan, so I changed my opinion quickly! With his dvd, I
achieved a GREAT workout!",1394928000,,270,4.113207547169812
2680537,3,B000JZ4UNO,Good toning workout for using tube bands but I was hoping for more of a cardio workout like I really wanted.,1393459200,,108,4.190476190476191
2680538,5,B000JZ4UNO,"I work out everyday, but this workout kicks my butt. I travel a lot and this is great when I don't have access to a gym. I usually pair it with Ab Jam or 20 min from the turbo series.",1392163200,,183,3.6
2680539,4,B000JZ4UNO,Just cheesy enough to keep your interest. If you are against dancing this is not for you. The moves are not dancy-difficult but some of the workout class participants are dancing and so does the instructor some times. There are all levels of ability demonstrated by the various class members and the teacher is clear about taking care of your self in the different exercises. Tubes are not required but some form of weights is needed. I have a tube just like the one in this video and searched for a good work out that uses tubing that is not too difficult for me...with some years on me to be honest. When I am feeling strong and robust this workout still works because I can follow the more advanced folks who are really pumping iron! Or rubber as the case may be.,1390694400,,766,4.401408450704225
2680540,5,B000JZ4UNO,"This isn't a cardio workout, and you have to take that into effect.  But it's great for toning/strength training which is just as important.  The 1/2 hour goes by quickly, and as always Chalene does this in a fun way!",1390608000,,217,4.4
2680541,5,B000JZ4UNO,"This is an awesome workout, especially if you're looking to learn how to use the resistance tubing. I love Turbo Jam!",1389484800,,117,4.619047619047619
2680542,3,B000JZ4UNO,But it wasn't the seller's fault. I just didn't know that much about the product. I like the cardio things and would return this but someday I may use it. Or donate it to the library.,1388707200,,183,4.111111111111111
2680543,5,B000JZ4UNO,"I love this DVD from Chalene Johnson and Turbo Jam. 3T means ""Totally Tubular Turbo"" - Chalene and a lot of the cast use resistance tubes instead of weights for this one. However, there are a few other cast members - Janelle (Chalene's sister), and Mindy (the usual modify-er) using weights instead. I liked the switch up from free weights. Some of those kicks and lower body moves are just not the same with weights! However, I do appreciate that not everyone in the video is using the band. I like to use weights instead of the bands for some of the exercises, and it's nice to see someone demonstrating that on the video. So this DVD does it all, no matter which you prefer, or what kind of mood you're in!",1384473600,,709,4.378787878787879
2680544,3,B000JZ4UNO,"I can't really say how it was, because it was never used and my daughter didn't want it. So this is why I said it was ok.",1377993600,,121,3.5185185185185186
2680545,5,B000JZ4UNO,"This definitely one of my favorite workouts from the turbo series!!!!! You work up a good sweat, and do so in minimal time :D",1374537600,,125,4.25
2680546,4,B000JZ4UNO,"This workout is very enjoyable. Chalene does a good job of keeping an upbeat attitude throughout the whole video. She motivates you to keep going and explains things well. Nevertheless, I like Rock it Out from Rockin' Body more because it works up a sweat and works more muscles more effectively than this DVD. The Rock it Out video is about 15 minutes longer but those 15 minutes are well worth it. I recommend this as an occasional strength training aspect of your fitness routine, not as the only one. If you love turbo jam and Chalene, go for it. It is inexpensive here on amazon.",1371600000,,584,4.518867924528302
2680547,5,B000JZ4UNO,"Great for legs that you want to work and get in shape.
Using the tubing or a band is effective.",1369440000,,95,3.8
2680548,4,B000JZ4UNO,When I first got it I didn't know I needed a tension cord but once I got one it was great!,1369353600,,90,3.3333333333333335
2680549,5,B000JZ4UNO,"I love Chalene's toning videos and this is just one more.  This one really targets the arms and legs.  Due to the resistance bands, you also get a cardio-effect. 35 -minute video hits the mark with quality workout in short time period.  Very happy with the workout video for the quality of the workout, the price and the shipping.",1366156800,2,330,4.559322033898305
2680550,5,B000JZ4UNO,What a great workout.  The items came very quickly in its shipping process.  Great resistance band workout and I would highly recommend it to provide a variety of workouts to your routine.,1365465600,,188,4.84375
2680551,4,B000JZ4UNO,You can tell this is pre-Turbo fire but the moves are the same. Great workout. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a workout that makes you sweat.,1361836800,,155,4.379310344827586
2680552,5,B000JZ4UNO,Chalene's workouts are absolutely fabulous.  She makes you want to workout with all her great music selections and high energy.  I would recommend this to anyone!,1358380800,,162,5.1923076923076925
2680553,5,B000JZ4UNO,Love the workout it is really good but what like is it was ship fast great company will defenately buy again from the.,1357430400,,118,4.173913043478261
2680554,2,B000JZ4UNO,"I have done turbo jam before, but I didn't know there were other types of turbo jams. This one did not meet my expectations at all. I was looking for one that's energetic. Turbo jam 3T is not energetic enough, in my opinion, it is for beginners. mow i have found turbo jam cardio party mix 2, and am excited to use it! I am now waiting for it to come in the mail!",1349568000,,363,3.918918918918919
2680555,5,B000JZ4UNO,"Great DVD for building muscles and when your short on time. You really need to push yourself to the limit, if you slack you won't feel it. Chalene Johnson is a great instructor, keeps you motivated the whole time but is not annoying! This is a great DVD to add to your Turbo Jam collection! I mix this DVD with ChaLean Extreme DVD set, which I love!",1327190400,,349,4.223880597014926
2680556,4,B000JZ4UNO,"this is a really good strength training workout, especially for beginners.  it is just the right length, in my opinion, and has the trademark chalene personality and music.
i also liked it because it is slower moving than the other turbojam videos, and it was easier for me to learn the moves and keep up.
although it is meant to be used with tubing, i found that free weights worked better for me in the upper body exercises mainly because i had trouble keeping the tubes even.  i often switch out to the tubes for the lower body stuff, but ankle weights would be great too.
dont be afraid to start out with NO weights or just 1-2 lbs.  If you are new to strength training or working out, i wouldnt even start out with more than 3lbs because you may burn yourself out and get discouraged. i started out with 1lb weights and gradually add another lb when i feel that the previous weight is no longer challenging.  this allows me to get more use out of the same workout, because i am increasing resistance slowly.
i give 4 stars, because it may not be the best workout for a person already at a high level of fitness.
if you are just starting with fitness, and going the dvd route, strength training is REALLY important and will improve your results dramatically. So don't forget to add that in to your training!",1325376000,5,1311,4.404958677685951
2680557,4,B000JZ4UNO,"I love the Turbo Jam series of workouts!!!  It's the type of exercise I need - cardiorific and not so irritating that I want to shoot my tv ')  As far as this workout - it was not my favorite workout but was true to turbo jam style.  If you're looking to add another workout to your turbo jam routine, I'd recommend it.",1324252800,,319,4.031746031746032
2680558,4,B000JZ4UNO,an excellent work out it should be double the time.  But it is a fat burner. I have one week using it and I already lost 4 pounds.,1306800000,,130,3.642857142857143
2680559,2,B000JZ4UNO,"I really LOVE Turbo Jam and I wanted to love this workout.  However, I found this one to go against all of the things I really love about the Turbo Jam franchise: great music, fun moves and exercises that really work my muscles.  This video, in my humble opinion, was boring and I felt that the bands didn't give me anywhere near the upper body workout I could've gotten using weights, such as in Turbo Sculpt.  I'd recommend either Turbo Sculpt, Lower Body Jam (which is AWESOME for legs) or 10-Minute Solutions Sculpting instead.",1297123200,10,531,4.627659574468085
2680560,4,B000JZ4UNO,I have yet to get my daughter to jam with me but it is worth the purchase anyway.,1284854400,,81,3.5555555555555554
2680561,4,B000JZ4UNO,"I really enjoy this workout- but it isn't as long or intense as Turbo Sculpt. The tubes are a nice change of pace and are very effective but, I most definitely wouldnt replace Turbo Sculpt with this strength training regime. It's a great add to any Turbo Jam collection, though. DVD plays fine.",1272672000,,294,4.566037735849057
2680562,4,B000JZ4UNO,"I thought this was a nice compliment to the Turbo Jam cardio workouts.  I actually prefer it to Turbo Sculpt from the first Turbo Jam workout set--cueing was a bit better, moves seem to be a bit more thought out, etc.  I also had a proper sweat going on so I was glad that this workout can really get the heart pumping.  While Chalene is still her cute and bubbly self, I did find this one a slightly dull (this observation could spring from my personal prejudice against resistance training so you'll have to be your own judge in this area).

The workout is a bit over 30 minutes and can be done with resistance tubing or free weights (a few of the participants actually use them in the video).  While I didn't find the tubing difficult to work with or anything, I personally prefer to use weights.  I usually do strength training starting off with 5 lbs weights so I felt that the workout was more effective this way.  Chalene suggests that this workout can be also done without tubing or weights but by ""using your own resistance.""

Warm-Up:
4 min warm-up:  toe taps, punches, squats, stretches

Workout:
The majority of these exercises start out in half time, then goes to ""singles,"" ending in pulses then repeated on the opposite side of your body:

5 min ""Biceps & Outer Thighs"":  biceps curls, angled bicep curls, outer thigh raises to the side and to the back
6 min ""Shoulder & Thighs"":  lateral raises, lunges, lunges with extensions---One crazy twist to one set of the lunges?  You go down, hold the down position then raise up sloooowly--ouch! but in a good way ;)
5 min ""Triceps & Glutes"":  Tricep extensions, tricep kickbacks, tricep straight-arm pulses (double ouch!!), squats
3 min ""Back & Outer Thighs"":  rows, more outer thigh exercises
5 min ""Abs"":  Various floor exercises (a few will be familiar to you if you own Ab Jam):  Side bends, plank with leg extensions, push-ups

Cool Down:
3 min ""Post-Strength Stretch"":  Quad stretch, ""bow"", ""child's pose"", etc.",1243468800,37,1977,4.6753623188405795
2680563,5,B000JZ4UNO,"I did this DVD for the first time today and really enjoyed it! It was 30 minutes well spent! At first I had expected to get a good workout, but instead I got a calorie-killing resistance training session! This DVD, like all the TJ DVDs, have ppl showing modifications to make the moves easier or more difficult. I thought that bc I am used to weight training with heavier weights, I would use a heavy/extra heavy band. I made it through with this band, but will be using my Medium strength band next time! Lots of compound moves to make your workout time more effective and it helps to increase the Heart Rate. I likd it a lot! So far, I am really impressed with Turbo Jam!",1228176000,2,673,4.307086614173229
2680564,4,B000JZ4UNO,"this is a great workout!! I have to admit I thought it wouldn't be a very hard workout,  but I was pleasantly surprised. You can really crank up the intensity very easily with the bands to get a great burn without having to have huge weights in your hands.",1228089600,,256,4.224489795918367
