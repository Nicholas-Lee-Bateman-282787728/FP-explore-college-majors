8014372,2,B0001M2CBM,"While I am hesitant to write a negative review on this documentary, I can't help but relate how boring this potentially interesting journey is portrayed. I was looking for high school material to generate interest in this subject area and this film is way off the mark. It seems as if there is no target audience. The persons interviewed are of different cultures, which is great, but there is no real reason to demo them walking in fields and villages without energetic inspiration. Even for myself, I may be close to the age of these individuals but I would never recreate their steps based on this film...it seems incredibly simplistic, old fashioned and isolating...which ironically is the experience that most seek on these sojourns. I didn't need to see the hanging underwear in the hostal nor would I ever show my students this film as they would be completely turned off to the concept. The music is out of someone's irrelevant collection and the woman in the libary is uninspiring too. The mispronunciation of El Rocio and its derivatives as ""el rokio"" is disconcerting to say the least. However, if you are an insomniac this may be your cure.",1161302400,6,1152,4.793969849246231
