8503738,5,B006SHJYNS,"Was really great - easy to follow - not boring - gets to the point.  Covers four very different methods of screen printing with some additional info on materials and tools.  Great for screen printing beginners like me.  Doesn't clutter the view so it's easy to see what you're focused on.
I would recommend this to anyone looking to learn about screen printing.
