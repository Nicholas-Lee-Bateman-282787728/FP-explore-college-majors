1353486,5,B00004U0ZP,"I became a Beatle fan thanks to my mother.  She had told me for years how good the movie ""Help!"" was.  Finally, she found the DVD and bought it.

I was an instant fan!

Help!, one of the DVD's included in this set is a thoroughly delightful movie with a fantastic soundtrack.  Anyone with a love for British comedy will also love this movie.

Also included with this set is Magical Mystery Tour, You Can't Do That!: The Making of A Hard Day's Night and The Beatles:  The First US Visit.  All three, combined with Help!, are well worth the cost of this four DVD set.

MPI Video who held the rights to the Beatles DVD's stopped selling them as of January 1, 2001.  That is such a sad thing because there is so much entertainment contained in this set and in all Beatles movies.

I highly recommend searching for this title through online auctions or other avenues.

You will not be disappointed with The Ultimate Collection!!",991094400,4,923,4.461077844311378
1353487,3,B00004U0ZP,"I am a Beatlemaniac and have always wondered why is ""Let It Be"" a missing film....where is this movie? I have yet to come across this film in any way. Was it pulled out of circulation after its initial release in 1970? I have seen all of the Beatles' existing movies & videos and very much want to watch this document which seems to be no longer in existence....why haven't the remaining members restored or made this essential part of their history available to the public? (We've seen some of the footage in the Anthology series so what's the story?) This is a documentary whose re-release is way,way overdue!!",980553600,9,612,4.623853211009174
1353488,3,B00004U0ZP,"The first movie I watched out of this set was ""Help!"" and I was very, very impressed with the quality of the digital restoration work that was done on this movie. And ""Help!"" is the best Beatles movie anyway. Packing ""Magical Mystery Tour"" along with it strikes me as a questionable choice, especially when we also have a documentary about the making of ""A hard day's night"" - so why wasn't that movie included? And MMT is clearly the weakest of all the Beatles films. The documentaries are interesting and do have their moments, but some of the editing, the interrupted interview style is a bit irritating. The packaging of the whole set strikes me as a bit cheap and one would have wished for a nicer box and a good set of liner notes - this after all wants to be a collector's set! Having been a Beatles fan for a while I am getting a bit tired of the medium-quality repackaging of previously released material. More quality, less quantity, please!",980035200,13,951,4.534883720930233
1353489,3,B00004U0ZP,"I had no idea I was so lucky to have a DVD copy of Hard Day's Night.
This is just another repackaging of stuff already released.  Most
Beatle fans know too much about that.
As for the individual titles,
Help is an excellent movie.  The big buget sequel to A Hard Day's
Night.
Magical Mystery Tour is really, really sad.  When it was
released origially for TV in Britian it was supposed to air twice but
after poor ratings was not rerun.  It was only run on American TV once
in black and white.  The one good thing about Magical Mystery Tour is
that it was digitally restored from the original film stock and the
soundtrack was remastered in digital stereo.  I had a copy of Magical
Mystery Tour released in the 80's by Media Home Entertainment, and it
was pretty much bootleg quality.
The First U.S. Visit is an
excellent documentary.  It begins with the Beatles landing at JFK
airport for their fist U.S. Tour.  Then they are off for their first
appearance on the Ed Sullivan show. It has footage from their first
live concert in America in Washington D.C.  It then follows them on
the historic train ride to Miami for their second appearance on the Ed
Sullivan Show.  One of the best sequences is on the train when John
and Paul are very tired of mugging for the cameras but George is going
crazy.  Little did they know at the time that they would be under the
microscope from then on!!
The making of Hard Day's Night is just ok.
Like someone else said, ""less Phil Collins, more
info...""
I need to see Let It Be on DVD and the making of Let
It Be.  Let It be is over two weeks of informal jamming boiled down to
about an hour and a half.
Bottom line is buy this release if you
don't have any of the titles in it.  It makes a fair starter
collection of Beatle DVDs.",968889600,73,1766,4.267267267267267
1353490,4,B00004U0ZP,"I thought this was a pretty good selection for the bucks.  You can sit back in the comfort of your home and enjoy several hours  of nostalgic  entertainment.  For those who wanted more, keep waiting.  But for those who  want to relax, sing, and smile, throw these disks in and enjoy. BUY IT!",966297600,5,291,4.39622641509434
1353491,3,B00004U0ZP,"Add mine to the list of Beatlemaniacs underwhlemed by the selections in this set.  (Consider my rating an average of five stars for the films and  one star for this box itself.)
Like pbfey, despite my fanaticism, I see  no need to own 'MMT' on disc until somebody cleans up the video further and  makes a ""What the heck were they thinking?"" making-of featurette  to go with it.  (Cue Ringo: ""Yeah, it sooked, but Brian was gone, and  we were all so wasted..."")  I already have 'AHDN' on DVD (thanks to  eBay), as well as 'Help!'  And when 'AHDN' is finally back in print,  folding in the 'You Can't Do That!' making-of would be the egalitarian  thing to do.
I hope you're right about the 'Anthology' coming to DVD by  early '01, pbfey, but you know what I'm really hankering for?  The modest  1982 MGM documentary 'The Compleat Beatles.'  This PBS pledge-drive staple  is, at two hours, the tightest, most all-around entertaining Fabs  documentary ever -- a much easier watch than the essential but bloated  'Anthology.'  (Many a rainy day at home has been rejuvenated by my  umpteenth watching of 'Compleat.')  It's now completely out of print, even  on VHS, so I must continue to rely on my mossy tape copy.  Crazy as this  sounds, I'd take a DVD of that little flick over almost anything else  Beatles-related at this point.  But I suspect it's not an MGM or an MPI  priority, so I'm not holding my breath.",965606400,34,1409,4.57258064516129
1353492,3,B00004U0ZP,"Speaking as someone who already owns three of these titles on DVD, this  box set makes no sense at all. ""A Hard Day's Night"" would be the  only reason to buy it, and it's missing. Surely it will be available again,  as will ""Let It Be"" I hope, so I will wait till they assemble ALL  the Beatles movies before buying a set of them.",965174400,19,330,4.030769230769231
1353493,3,B00004U0ZP,"With the ""A Hard Day's Night"" DVD currently out of print, Bealtes fans have had to make due with the DVDs presented in this dubious  ""Collector's Set."" All are available separately, so save you  dollars! As much as I love the group, I see little reason to own  ""Magical Mystery Tour"" on DVD. The ""documentary"" of the  making of AHDN isn't bad, but my VHS copy will suffice. Which leaves  ""Help!"" and ""...Their First US Visit."" Personally, I'm  holding out for the deluxe editions of the feature films. Hello Criterion?  You did a nice laser disc of AHDN, where's the DVD? And how about a proper  ""making of"" documentary, with more Lester and less Phil Collins?  ""Help!"" is a great film, but would also benefit from similar  additional first-hand recollections. Which leaves ""The Beatles: Their  First US Visit."" Of this foursome (pending the arrival of an expanded  ""Help!"" DVD), this is the only true must-have disc: a cinema  verite look at Beatlemania from the boys' perspectives (...a car, a room, a  car, a room...), beautifully observed by the Maysles brothers in 1964. The  Ed Sullivan show bits are wonderful, but my favorite moment is John  noodling on the melodica, playing what you'll recognize as the intro to  ""Strawberry Fields Forever."" This documentary is a rare, amazing  glimpse into a world we'll never see again. I'm saving my money for the  Anthology DVDs slated for late 2000/early 2001.",964656000,108,1409,4.8691983122362865

I bought mine for about $22 at a Fred Meyer store in Boise in 1998. As long as you understand it is a nice collector item, but has old versions of the two movies, you'll be ok with it.

7923343,2,B00004U0ZP,"Christopher Molanphy's review of The Beatles DVD Collector's Set is still completely accurate in 2012, especially his comments about The Compleat Beatles, and how it is STILL (even now!) far and away the tightest and best produced Beatles documentary to date. Why has this 30 year-old gem never been digitized by MGM or CBS or whoever owns the publishing rights? No DVD of this masterpiece? No available script or subtitles (in English) of the original VHS so that those of who'd like to make our own DVD from the VHS could? It's a crying shame.

7923344,4,B00004U0ZP,"What is important here is both Help! and Magical Mystery Tour.  Help! is from the same remastered 1.6 to 1 ratio source as on the new 2 disk set, however this is reduced from that original 1.6 British version to the 1.3 TV image ratio using side to side pan and scan.  If you compare this to the new 2 disk set, you'll see that frame for frame the picture and sound is from the same remastered 1.6 source.  So you have a choice between this hack job and the hack job on the new set.  I prefer this full top to bottom view with the sides cut off in this version to the full side to side view with the top and bottom cut off (fake widescreen) on the new 2 disk set, but it is sad we have to choose between these two.  Why they can't release the full 1.6 image is beyond comprehension.
  Magical Mystery Tour is the main reason to get this set.  It is remastered from the best possible prints of the film and there is no comparison between this beautifully remastered version and the piece of doo doo that is currently out there.  The MMT disk also has two interesting vintage 1967 newsreels about The Beatles; their trip to India to study under MM Yogi and the opening of the Apple psychedelic boutique.  Get a copy of these films if you can.",1199664000,2,1240,4.1722689075630255
7923345,2,B00004U0ZP,"The value of this collection is in some ways priceless.  ""Imagine"" a collection that could get us all five Beatles' films for an affordable price.  The two-star rating isn't for the very good release, 'Help' or for the flawed, idiocyncratic, random, but sometimes groundbreaking and interesting 'Magical Mystery Tour' and all of the gravy of the accompanying ""rockumentaries"".  Hopefully, the capitalist version of trickle down economics will materialize--the way it did for C.D. players and Walkman--when the prolitariat will be able to afford all five Beatles' (movie) DVD's, either separately or together.  By the way, although the bickering on 'Let It Be' (not included here--or barely anywhere else) is legendary, so is the music.  For those who have seen the last Beatle film, the strife is enlightening, but overrated.  Can we have that movie, please?  (For myself, I only saw it once:  At a Mark Lapidos' Beatles' convention in 1980.)  I hope trickle down theory works, and someday the rest of us will get the movies we want.",1160956800,2,1033,5.101190476190476
7923346,5,B00004U0ZP,"Until A Hard Day's Night and Anthology are released in DVD, this, along with the remastered Yellow Submarine DVD, is basically it.  You can save money by buying the packaged product.  The First US Visit is like traveling in a time machine.  Note how George is the only one who looks into the camera and mugs for it on the Sullivan Show debut.  As far as I can tell, all the Sullivan appearances are on here.
Help! is essential for the true Beatles fan & collector.  Making of AHDN is loads of fun, as well.  A nice preview for the upcoming release of that cinematic classic this fall.  Yes, Mystery Tour is tough to watch, though the Walrus Video established an MTV type years later.
