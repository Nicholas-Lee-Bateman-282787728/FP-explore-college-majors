8561779,5,B00B2TUPNA,"Tegami Bachi: Letter Bee makes use of a lot of the elements that make a good anime: Engaging characters, an original plot, comedy, drama, cool action scenes, and of course, crazy hair! I need not expound on the plot, as you already have a decent product description, so I'll spare you of that.

The show is beautifully drawn, with an equally beautiful color palette to go with it and as mentioned, the action scenes, while not as frequent as in other anime, are fun to watch. Tegami Bachi's biggest fault animation-wise, however, are the CGI Gaichuu (gaint armored bugs), which look horribly out of place in their (mostly) 2D animated world. But the writing makes up for it.

This is a shounen series (aimed at teenage boys), so expect some action violence, a little profanity, and the occasional immodestly-dressed girl. Later episodes also have some nudity, but the naughty bits are covered up. There's also at least one Letter Bee Academy short that has a bit of off-color humor. The packaging says TV-PG, which more or less translates to PG-13.

Overall, I enjoyed this anime very much.",1374969600,2,1090,4.818181818181818
