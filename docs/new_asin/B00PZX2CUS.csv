6838999,5,B00PZX2CUS,"HA - what a good Aussie movie.  My son and I watched this and I was all prepared for it to be a mega dodgy movie (I'm not a fan of Aussie movies) but I can HONESTLY say that this was worth watching!!
Sure, you could tell that it wasn't a mega budget movie, but it was MUCH BETTER than other small budget movies I've seen!!
The acting was very Aussie, the storyline was really good.  I even liked the Yowie (oh how I had forgotten about Yowies until this movie).
I would buy/own this movie (my son owns it).
Can't wait for Travis Bain's next movie",1438387200,5,546,4.093457943925234
6839000,3,B00PZX2CUS,"The Throwback US DVD has a technical fault which has resulted in the loss of approximately 9 minutes of footage from the middle of the film. This footage is missing from the moment a character says ""His name is Jack."" This missing footage includes the story resolution of a key character. The distributor is working to rectify this problem. There may be a recall of Throwback DVDs in the US so if you've purchased one, please contact travisbain@hotmail.com.",1438300800,,457,4.871794871794871

What can I say without giving away the impact of watching it for the first time ?

Stunning images of the forest of far North Queensland - a place I have come to hold dear.

A friend playing a bit-part ... automatically makes me a biased viewer. (Shaun )

A sponsor so Travis  and the crew could attend the US film festival premiere .... of course was a winner.  Best Foreign Film at the prestigious Famous Monsters Film Festival in California.  Yep, I guess this declares a ""conflict of interest"".

Oh ... the actual movie.

The best of ""B grade"" horror blended with unexpected but delightful humor and ""groan worthy"" moments.  A great yarn for a light evening's entertainment.

My only disappointment ... the absence of a cameo from a local croc

Worth watching, although with the level of stylised violence definitely adult only.

Absolutely worth the purchase.",1438300800,3,874,4.746666666666667

6839003,1,B00PZX2CUS,Okay,1437523200,,4,4.0
6839004,3,B00PZX2CUS,"First, this is a better than good-enough low-tech indie monster movie because it has something no others I've seen do: real life in the Australian bush, where deadly known critters abound, in range and distribution quite sufficient to wreck your daytrip...or your wilderness treasure hunt.

While THROWBACK sports just a bit of hokeyness in a couple of really bad corny lines, the film overall, plot to acting,  was much better than most B-movie monster films.

Definitely some good enough scare scenes. But what was a bit of a standout for me, with a dozen Bigfoot and monster books on my shelves...and being a veteran of a couple of camping trips in the Pacific Northwest where there was definitely a large, bi-pedal uninvited guest throwing rocks in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere...what else I can applaud that is true about THROWBACK is a handful of true-to-life details about the Giant Hominid that aren't so widely known. These little points of information showed up in ways that I found impressive: plenty of research had been done before the film crew took to the woods. I mean jungle. To get to specifics: certain aspects of the range of real vocalizations --of at least the North American Bigfoot--  were portrayed here by the audio tech in a most unique way. I'm sure those uniquely authentic sound effects have not been heard in any other film, including most of the YouTube in-the-wild claimed BigFoot recordings that abound. This is something I've paid a lot of attention to, because there are other effects going on with the BF vocalizations that are often ignored in both documentary reenactments and feature monster films like this one.

Timing-wise, there were plenty of good, believable surprises from the human element: lots of turn-arounds, betrayals, spookiness to keep it all real on the human level. And the Outback wildlife shots! Thrills and chills there, including one of the other traditional land-based monsters.

Negatives: anyone shooting a Bigfoot movie is going to have a problem with scale. The well-executed shots of the monster were extremely well done, and keeping that so real, it definitely took some engineering. One or two closeups of the hand wasn't right, but the rest was quite masterfully done. Kudos to these Aussie filmmakers!",1435795200,11,2292,5.002624671916011
6839005,2,B00PZX2CUS,It was eh ok for a bigfoot movie but ive definitely seen much better. Plus the film kept freezing & jumping like it was cheaply filmed.,1435536000,,135,4.230769230769231
6839006,1,B00PZX2CUS,ABSOLUTELY HORRRRRRRRRIBLE !!!!,1435017600,3,31,9.666666666666666
6839017,5,B00PZX2CUS,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Actual rating is a 4.5 but I gave it 5 stars to bring up its rating to a more indicative level of its entertainment, surprises, and enjoyment!",1507075200,,173,4.612903225806452
6839018,4,B00PZX2CUS,That was actually pretty good. Better than I thought it would be.. I kind of enjoyed it.,1506902400,,88,4.235294117647059
6839019,1,B00PZX2CUS,"What an annoying movie.  Yowie chasing people, people running from yowie and chasing other people. That's pretty much the entire movie. It was ridiculous. The premise was good at the beginning of the movie but it never moved anywhere.  It just stagnated in the running, hiding, chasing...  I stopped watching with about 20 minutes to go because I couldn't have cared less what happened next.",1506816000,2,391,4.984615384615385

6839022,2,B00PZX2CUS,"I am a sucker for outdoor ""thrills and chills"" movies and have seen a couple ""Bigfoot"" movies that were actually pretty decent in my opinion (Exists, Willow Creek). I was hoping this would be another one but no such luck. Without the advantage of viewing the trailer beforehand, which would have told me all I needed to know and saved me the $3.95 rental fee (as well as the time spent watching it) this was not at all what I expected, even after reading the reviews. The characters lacked any kind of ""character"" at all, other than to be jackasses. Other than a couple of slight scares, this was a waste of time really. Oh well, win some, lose some.",1493510400,3,650,4.425
6839023,4,B00PZX2CUS,"I loved the sense of humor in this movie , rather if it was on purpose or not I don't know. Loved all the actors. This one is a keeper!",1490659200,,135,3.533333333333333

6839039,3,B00PZX2CUS,"This movie was a fairly entertaining Bigfoot movie, of which I'm a great fan of.  The difference is that this took place in Australia rather than in America, a somewhat different take on the legends.  Truthfully, I didn't find any of the characters interesting enough to really care what happened to  them, the exception is the one guy, who I guess was supposed to be the ""bad guy"" in the movie.  Now him, I was cheering for him to be killed in almost every scene. What an idiotic moron he was too, when it came to trying to get out of the handcuffs, did it occur to him to break the handcuffs with the rock, rather than what he ended up doing?
Anyway, if you're looking for something to watch on a lazy evening that has Bigfoot in it, this is a movie you might want to check out.",1480118400,11,780,4.214765100671141
