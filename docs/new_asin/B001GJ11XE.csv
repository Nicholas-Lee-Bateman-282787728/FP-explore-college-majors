8305609,1,B001GJ11XE,When I ordered this product I was not aware that I needed additional equipment to use the DVD.  On the back there is a picture of a woman using resistance bands attached to a door.  Did not want to open the DVD to find out if there was a modified version.  So I sent them back.,1344211200,,277,3.9107142857142856
8305610,3,B001GJ11XE,"For some reason I expected this to contain more than one ten minute workout.  This is not ""volume 4"" so much as ""workout number four.""",1317945600,3,134,4.36
8305611,4,B001GJ11XE,"The dvd looks great.  However, I can't do any of the exercises yet because no where in the description of the item did it say that this is supposed to come with a resistance band that you can attach to a door.  So, unless you order the band separately, you can't use the product.",1247011200,19,279,4.148148148148148
