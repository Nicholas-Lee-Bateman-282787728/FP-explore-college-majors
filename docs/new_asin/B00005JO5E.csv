7941000,3,B00005JO5E,"This is a review of the DVD briefly put out by a company called Firecake.  This DVD pops up occasionally from independent vendors.  The image quality is not great, similar to movies that have not had a video transfer since the early 1980's.  There is slight ghosting.  The sound is hollow.  However, I have seen a 16mm print of the film on the big screen at the American Cinematheque and the quality was not much better.  The film is flawed in many technical aspects (in addition to the pacing and meandering plot).  The film itself needs to have a massive restoration before there could be any kind of high quality DVD.  This DVD is as good as it will get until that happens.  The print that the video was transferred from was in good condition, there is an appropriate level of contrast and minimal scratches/dirt.  I recommend this DVD, should it ever be available, if you are a fan of Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Max Ophuls, or Maria Montez.  This is by far the least available of his Hollywood films, and he gets a truly good performance out of Montez, although she is only around for about 20 minutes.  But it's the best 20 minutes in the film.",1301961600,9,1145,4.478260869565218

7941002,5,B00005JO5E,"This is one of Max Ophls' most beautiful films and needs to be available in a form that does it justice. On the surface a rather silly swashbuckler, it's transformed by the master's camera into a ravishing elegy on exile and irreparable loss. Anyone who isn't moved by the final crane shot hasn't been paying attention to what's really going on. Of course it's not easy to appreciate in the shoddy prints shown on TV. Maybe a DVD will recue it. Ophls' Lola Montes was just shown at the Cannes film festival in a restored print, so with any luck this will be next.",1211932800,9,563,4.423076923076923

aka L'Exile

(Action/Adventure, 1 hr 35 min, Sepia Technique)

Universal - U.S.A.

DIRECTOR:

Max Ophuls

CAST:

Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Paula Corday Nigel Bruce, Maria Montez (As: The Countess)

COMMENTS:

Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.'s second stint as a movie producer--and his first as a writer--was an ambitious attempt to dramatize the tale of the restoration of Charles II to the throne of England. An avowed Anglophile, Fairbanks had a strong sense of the history of his adoptive land. (He was born in New York City.) Unfortunately, the drama and excitement of the pursuit of Charles Stuart (Fairbanks) after his return from self-imposed exile in Holland by Oliver Cromwell's Puritans is dampened by the producer-author-star's insistence on a walking pace for the story. Much of the film is concerned with Fairbanks' trysting with the luscious Croset--later Paula Corday--in her first starring role, as a Royalist who conceals the fugitive king on her estate. Despite a strong supporting cast and an interesting concept, the film is dull. It is graced to some extent by the fluid, sepia-toned visuals characteristic of director Ophuls in his first completed American directorial effort. (He was fired from his initial directing job by Howard Hughes.)

In this film, her first appearance after her pregnancy, Montez wears clothes to the style of a woman from 17th century Holland in the role of the Countess of Courtervir, the lover of King Charles II of England (Fairbanks Jr.).

Even though in this film Maria appeared during a short time on screen, around 20 minutes, in the credits she was as a co-star next to Fairbanks Jr. Therefore, the publicity before the premiere put Fairbanks Jr. as the only star of this movie.

Maria felt offended, it was incomprehensible for her that Universal Pictures did something like that after signing with her a contract, just a year before, in order to appear in 8 movies as star or co-star.

The case was investigated by her lawyers and they decided to sue the Studio and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in Los Angeles Justice Court. Maria and his lawyers received US$250,000.

The movie could not make much money, it was not pleasant for the public, they could not understand why their favorite star appeared so little on the screen.",1123891200,7,2315,5.023560209424084
