8501258,5,B006N5DASU,This movie was fun to watch. I had previously watched the anime version and decided to check out the movie. The anime and the movie are similar in some ways but the story changes a bit in the movie version. Unlike the anime - there's a surprise but I don't want to spoil it. Check it out and see what Paradise kiss has to offer.,1382918400,,328,4.061538461538461
8501259,4,B006N5DASU,When I bought this I was so excited to watch it but I was unaware the movie was from another region and it was a movie that Amazon suggested to me in the United States. luckily I got the regionless DVD player shortly after my purchase. movie works great love the movie although it differs from the Japanese comic slightly. Overall pretty good.,1373068800,,343,4.4603174603174605
8501260,5,B006N5DASU,"This movie is not meant for serious thinkers and verges on the ridiculous at parts but I still loved it. This is mainly a chick-flick, I think, based on themes in the movie, but I would recommend this movie.",1365552000,,207,4.333333333333333
