8473804,3,B005HW2H0C,"Good kickboxing work out but I gave it 3 stars because I didn't care for the intervals....even though she uses a kettle bell they show options with weights, that's not the problem. The problem is some of the intervals are just plain ridiculous and meet for a extremely  advanced psrson....I'm a former instructor in very good shape and I find these unnecessary. ..other things go you can do instead of rolling around on the floor",1453161600,,429,4.72

8473807,5,B005HW2H0C,I've just recently found Amy Bento Ross and I really like her dvds.  They are really challenging and just what I'm looking for to add to my workout dvd collection.  Good for intermediate exercisers.,1369267200,,198,4.794117647058823
8473808,4,B005HW2H0C,"I really enjoyed this workout.  It was different and was a good addition to my many tapes.  The only issue I had was I wish there was more Kettlebell...since it is a kettlebell workout...But don't let that stop you, get this tape and enjoy the workout moves.",1366156800,,258,4.468085106382978
8473809,5,B005HW2H0C,"I have been using kettlebells for over 2 years and have been doing kickboxing for cardio for over 15. I ordered this workout wanting to love it, but a little skeptical since I traded in Amy Bento Ross's Kettlebell Dynamics because I found it boring and not challenging. I am so glad that I did, because I really love this workout.

The four intervals consist of more kickboxing than kettlebells, Amy builds a kickboxing combination for a while on the right side, we do it on the right,  build it on the left, do it on the left, and then switch off between the right and left. After we are done with that combo, we do some standard kettebell moves. For the first interval, we only need one kettlebell, even though Amy has us bring out two, and for the other kettlebell intervals, we need two bells of the same size. The kettlebell portions are definitely challenging -we do push-ups, renegade rows, double swings, double cleans, squats and more.

The kickboxing choreography is a little tricky but doable. It certainly seems easier each time I do it. The kickboxing definitely got my heart rate up. The workout really flies by and I love the soreness in my triceps that I get the day after doing it. Very fun - glad I purchased.",1364083200,2,1227,4.518018018018018
8473810,5,B005HW2H0C,It is what I am looking for in a work-out.  Kickboxing with weights combined with intervals.  I am sweating and I am only halfway through!,1356912000,,138,4.48
8473811,5,B005HW2H0C,"KB Squared is a new interval workout from Amy Bento Ross which combines kickboxing and kettlebells.  I am a high intermediate exercise who loves both kickboxing and kettlebell (although I am still relatively new to the latter), so this DVD sounded perfect for me.  Amy works out here with just a single background exerciser, Uchenna.  At some points, Amy and Uchenna use two kettlebells (12kg each), but an inset comes onscreen to show how to modify with dumbbells (you can also use a single kettlebell and switch sides).  They are in a large, open studio with wood floors, and the music is fun and upbeat.

The Main Menu on this reads as follows:
*Play All
*Chapters
*Premixes
*Modify Only
*Credits

The main workout alternates between kickboxing combos and kettlebell intervals; there are four of each.  I have provided time breakdowns and a brief overview of each segment below.

WARM-UP, 8 minutes
Amy gets things moving immediately with kickboxing moves.  She starts with a hi-lo jab to the side; this is followed by four alternating punches, four alternating ""jawbreakers"" (huge uppercuts) moving forward and then four uppercuts moving back.  Gradually adding on, she includes two hi-low hooks to either side, a triangular foot pattern (with ""quiet"" arms), alternating knees with a triple step in-between, and then an alternating block to finish.  Amy runs through this combo several times one side before switching to the other; she finishes by alternating.

COMBO 1, 9 minutes
This first kickboxing combo starts with a forearm strike, a half-turn retreat, and a hook/uppercut.  Amy gradually builds on this, adding two knees, four jabs, and finally, four kicks, with an optional jump kick to the front and ending with a roundhouse kick.  She teaches the moves all on one side before moving to the other, then switches between the two.  Although the moves sound fairly simple, I actually found the choreography to be a bit tricky for this segment; I STILL didn't have it quite down by the end (and the switching back-and-forth didn't help!).

INTERVAL 1, 4.5 minutes
For this segment, Amy uses a single kettlebell for a high pull, snatch, and middle getup combination (the latter is sort of a part Turkish getup in reverse with a bridge hold).

COMBO 2, 5.5 minutes
For this second combo, Amy and Uchenna set up facing to one side.  They begin with a jab-jab-cross followed by a head block and parry block.  This is followed by a side kick, double front kick, and then jump back to re-set.  Again, Amy switches to the other side, then moves back-and-forth.  I found this second combination much easier to follow, and it was my favorite of all of the kickboxing segments.

INTERVAL 2, 4.5 minutes
Here Amy and Uchenna use two kettlebells for double swings, double cleans, and front squats.

COMBO 3, 6 minutes
Amy beings this section with right-left-right quick jabs, finishing with a hook.  She then steps forward for two uppercuts and a jawbreaker.  These are followed by two different knee blocks, a roundhouse kick, and finally, a jumping back kick.  As with previous segments, she alternates sides once she has taught the entire combination.  This was a bit tricky too, although I mostly had it by the end.  However, it went on and on...Amy kept saying ""just 4 more,"" ""2 more,"" but then she kept continuing beyond those points!

INTERVAL 3, 5 minutes
Here Amy uses one kettlebell for four push-ups, four renegade rows, and then two walks forward and back; after a brief rest, she performs a second set, then switches to the other side.

COMBO 4, 7 minutes
This last combination starts with a jab-jab-cross, performed twice.  Amy adds three turning kicks to this (knee crescent kick, roundhouse, back kick) and then a full crescent followed by three roundhouse kicks, alternating sides.  The combination is first practiced on one side before moving on to the other.  After finishing the kicking combo on both sides, she performs a brief punch combo--upper-upper-hook-hook--16 repetitions per side.

INTERVAL 4, 4 minutes
Using double kettlebells, Amy moves from clean to rack, finishing with double cleans.  She then performs overhead press with a step back lunge hold.

COOL-DOWN, 3.5 minutes
This is a standing segment which includes dynamic flows, mainly moving from horse stance through moves such as standing lunge, glutes stretch, etc.

STRETCH, 5 minutes
This lying segment continues the stretching on the floor, beginning with a lying pretzel twist and moving into a seated forward bend, child's pose, shoulder stretch, and hip flexor stretch.

This DVD also includes several premix options; the Premix menu breaks these down well, but briefly, they are as follows:  Quick Power, 38:30m; Bell Power, 44:21m, and Full Power, 63:23m.

Overall, I have enjoyed this DVD quite a bit so far.  I love that Amy made it mostly low impact (the jumps are optional, and she recommends that you go barefoot for the workout).  I am also impressed that Amy obtained her RKC certification, which I understand she did NOT have for her earlier kettlebell workouts.  As I mentioned above, however, I did find some of the kickboxing choreography to be a bit tricky--this may have just been me, as I have trouble with directional changes, but those who prefer simpler choreography like myself should take note.  Also, while I enjoyed Amy's kettlebell work, she spent quite a bit of time setting up the kettlebell moves, making those segments even shorter than the time estimates I quoted due to the time she spent talking.  In the end, however, this DVD has great chaptering, fun moves, and plenty of variety, and I know I will get a lot of use out of it.  Final rating: 4 1/2 stars.",1321401600,6,5680,4.9253417455310196
8473812,4,B005HW2H0C,"I never thought that Amy would create a kickboxing workout that I would appreciate as much as her ""In The Ring""; ""KB2"" proved me wrong. I love all of the kickboxing combinations--they are very different than her other routines and did not take long to learn. I am ""dripping"" after completing this workout. I also enjoy the kettlebell segments, but I modify them for my own preferences: I increase the intensity by adding greater reps on the double kettlebell swings, adding more turkish getups (especially on the segment where she and Uchenna seemingly crawl with the kettlebell; that particular exercise does nothing for me), more snatches, and adding two-handed heavy swings at the end. It's not a perfect workout, but Amy ALWAYS seeks to do her best and put out a quality product. Props to her also for sending a replacement DVD simply because the ""play all"" feature did not allow you to pause; I could have lived with that flaw. I also have Kettlebell Power, but it is not as engaging for me as KB2. Amy is still my favorite instructor, overall. Congrats to her also for achieving her RKC!",1315958400,,1093,4.727748691099476
8473813,5,B005HW2H0C,"I love kickboxing, I love kettle bells and I love Amy Bento.  It isn't a surprise that I love this workout!
Amy has another winner here.  She alternates kickboxing and kettlebell routines.

Why I love this DVD:

**the kettlebell movements are very controlled.  I'm fairly new to kettlebell training and I get very nervous doing the swinging movements; I didnt' have to worry about this in KB Squared.

**Even though some of the kettlebell routines use two kettlebells, you can easily modify using dumbbells or just one kettlebell.  Amy does two sets in an interval, so I do one set with a kettlebell in one hand and then do the second set with the kettlebell in my other hand.  I also alternate which hand I start with each time I do the workout.

**the kickboxing moves are intense, yet not high impact.  I'm an advanced exerciser and my heart rate is always at the high end of my aerobic zone after doing these routines.

**the workout is fun and the time just flies!  I hardly realize that I'm working really hard.

**the rockin' music.  Amy has a special talent for picking great music. Note:  I like this music better than the music on her Kettlebell Power workout.

**the uncluttered set.  It's just Amy and the beautiful Uchenna working out with a clean set backdrop.  Amy went back to producer Greg Twombly for this workout and I'm so glad she did.  Her previous two workouts were filmed elsewhere and you can tell they weren't as professionally done (the filming, not the workouts).

**Amy and Uchenna are so fit and strong, it's very motivating.  None of the skinny, anorexic look of models, just the healthy and toned look of women who love to exercise.

**the premixes for when you're short on time.

Some things to note about this workout:

**The kettlebell intervals use 2 kettlebells.  Kettlebells are expensive and not everyone will want to run out and get two kettlebells of the same weight.  Modifications with dumbbells are shown.  You can also use one kettlebell and just alternate sides.

**This is definitely an advanced workout.  Amy does give some form pointers and encourages you to go at your own pace.  However, I recommend having some experience with kettlebells before attempting this workout.

**Be careful when working out in bare feet.  Not only do you have to be careful not to drop the kettlebells on your feet, but your legs may be more sore.  I had shin splints the first few times I tried the workout in bare feet.

These ""things to note"" didn't detract from the workout for me. This workout is my new favorite.  I highly recommend it!",1314144000,3,2572,4.677852348993288
