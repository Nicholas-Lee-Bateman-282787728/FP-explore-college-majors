8624797,4,B00GMPPXVI,"This is a one disc DVD that has 5 parts on it. The total running time is 3 hours and 40 minutes. It has English subtitles.
The subjects are: 1. William and Kate- Inside the Royal Wedding. 2. Royally Astounding 30 defining days. 3. Wild about Prince Harry 4. The Making of a royal wedding 5. Untold Stories of a royal bridesmaid.

There are interviews with friends, news people and biographers. We look into the kitchen, the cake maker, and the carriages. Do not be misled and think most of this is about William and Kate. The greater part of the interviews and filming is before their wedding so these are reminiscences and comparisons to Charles and Diana's wedding and speculating what William and Kate's wedding will be like. For instance we have the baker who has done previous wedding cakes and he shows what he would do if asked to make a cake for William and Kate. The same holds true for the carriage driver who is a former royal employee and the carriage he shows is much smaller than what the royal carriage would be.

Diana's dress designer talks about the pressures, the media, and again speculates on Kate's gown. One problem is that they show strapless gowns which are a no-no for royal weddings. Then a bodyguard shows us the gate Kate will leave by to go to the wedding except it is the middle gate at Buckingham Palace and she would not have stayed there and did not.

30 Days are simply 30 dates that were defining days; Diana's death of course dominates. The section on Prince Harry covers his childhood, but more of his wilder young adult escapades and then his settling into the military and responsibilities.
The royal bridesmaid is India Hicks who was in Diana's wedding procession and she talks to others and also her mother who was in Queen Elizabeth's wedding. The section on Harry and the one with India Hicks are well done with new insights into royal weddings.
This is a nice DVD for those interested in the English monarchy.",1400371200,13,1954,4.577142857142857
