8763533,5,B01GU8EBSM,"Looking at the mixed reviews it seems some people have wandered into a trap of a film that was not meant for them. That said, I found this film highly enjoyable. It is a very smart view of a ship of men as they embark a game which makes them compete to figure out who is the best man 'in general' in every detail: the way they walk, eat, breath and every moment in between + a few contrived 'tests'. It's a ridiculously hilarious setup.

The game verges on the surreal, and once in it, the players are suddenly that much more concerned about the way they present themselves with the odd exception . . . It's a really good premise, to explore individuals and groups, their vanity, how we 'measure' life; but also what daily interraction means in every trade-off between individuals.

The film is sometimes surreal and odd, it's sometimes mean, but generally, the tone is warm, very human with a good sense of humour. All the characters each hold their own depth. Always, we are aware of the ridiculousness of the Game, but also aware are we that to some degree, we play this same 'game' all the time. Holding up this mirror is a good reminder. It's great to see an original film such as this. I'll be watching it again.",1533600000,,1218,4.408888888888889

8763535,3,B01GU8EBSM,"The plot is that six friends all go on a luxury trip aboard a yacht in the Aegean Sea. They do all the things you are supposed to do like scuba diving, eating rich sea food and water sports, but they soon start to get on each others nerves. Then one of them has an idea of a new game. This is to find out who is best and this they will do by coming up with competitions with which they can collectively judge each other. By the time they hit port they can tot up the scores and the winner gets to wear the Chevalier ring.

Then the fun begins and these middle aged men soon let their inner demons out as competitiveness rears its ugly head and all too quickly it is every man for himself  in a very restrained way of course.

Now this is a comedy but for me it was long on good ideas but short on laughs. There are a few but not scattered liberally. The acting is all great and the crew are as relevant as the main players and indeed injected a dimension that keeps this from becoming becalmed  to use a nautical reference. It did keep me interested until the end, but I still feel I am being generous with my score. In Greek with good subtitles  this is an original film that hopefully will float your boat.",1479340800,2,1208,4.080168776371308
8763536,1,B01GU8EBSM,"Bring, boring, boring! A group of wealthy businessmen and professionals, on a yacht trip through the Greek islands, decide to have a bunch of rather silly contests to see who is the best man ""in general."" Sort of like a pentathlon, I guess. The problem is that there's no dramatic tension. Zero. None of these guys are very sympathetic or even interesting and we're not given any reasons to care about who wins what. One of those movies where you keep waiting for something to happen, but it never does. I read somewhere that this was an elaborate allegory about the Greek financial mess, but if so, it went over our heads. There's a little male nudity (from the back), but only what you see on the DVD cover.",1477958400,3,709,4.503875968992248
8763537,1,B01GU8EBSM,"Weird! Was not labeled as a sub-titled movie and was NOT in English, nor were there subtitles. Bailed after 10 minutes.",1476921600,3,119,4.714285714285714
8763538,3,B01GU8EBSM,prepare the viewing with plenty of (legalized) Xanax.  with any luck you'll fall asleep early in the film. (maybe it should be watched with a friend and booze).,1475625600,3,160,4.714285714285714
8763539,5,B01GU8EBSM,"I saw this film at the AFIfest in Los Angeles in November of 2015 and it was one of my favorites.  Waiting for a theatrical release so I could recommend to friends but after a lackluster week at the Nuart, further showings at the Laemmle chain were cancelled.  What a shame.  Chevalier is a hilarious film where a bunch of guys spend a few days on a friend's yacht.  They want to determine who is ""the best"" and begin to judge each other.  This film shows that if you get a number of men together by themselves for a time, regardless of nationality, they will become d**kheads.  Truly funny film.",1474243200,2,596,4.372727272727273
