2991831,1,B000WTZ6M6,"It is difficult to hear the voice of Cobain on the soundtrack - it has been drowned by talentless video footage and an annoying soundtrack, often so invasive, that it defeats its purpose. This is a very unfortunate packaging of spoken word, soundtrack and video of appaling shallowness that never come together like the ingredients of a badly mixed cocktail. This material should have been released only as a spoken word recording, without any soundtrack whatsoever - let alone video. Having said that, Michael Azzerad could have been more discriminating in choosing a director for this oeuvre - almost anyone could have done a better job!",1203897600,9,639,5.037735849056604
2991832,2,B000WTZ6M6,"I have been a Nirvana fan form the start but this dvd is nothing more than interviews that I have read before with boaring video of locations in Washington. The few stills of Nirvana and Kurt are pics that we have all seen before. If it was released as a cd, it might have been better. I was dissapointed.",1203552000,7,305,4.186440677966102
2991833,5,B000WTZ6M6,"First let me say that this is beautifully filmed so I guess it deserves 5 stars. The images of Seattle and environs could almost stand alone as visual commentary on real people of the Northwest. It serves here as a backdrop for a recorded interview with Kurt Cobain. When I got this I was hoping for rare footage of pre-fame performances, interviews with people who knew him along the way, etc.  I am speculating that the producers of this film were unable to get the rights to any Kurt Cobain material other than the recorded interview. This is obviously a well-intentioned film, but for me it just didn't work, either as a tribute, or as a documentary. I was never a Nirvana fan but I like their music when I hear it. I had hoped this film would make me a believer. Without his music, or footage of him performing (or any footage of Kurt Cobain at all for that matter) etc., voice-over Cobain sort of comes off as a somewhat petulant, whiny individual, although his honesty is refreshing.  I did get the sense from watching this that Kurt Cobain incarnated to be exactly who he turned out to be, and that luck notwithstanding, cream does rise to the surface. If you are already a Kurt Cobain fan this film may fill in some blanks. If not, you should look elsewhere for inspiration.",1203552000,,1283,4.502145922746781
2991834,4,B000WTZ6M6,"Since Kurt Cobain's death in 1994, many books have been written about him and his band Nirvana that try to get the real story about the musician and reluctant rock star. Arguably, the best book about him is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Come-As-You-Are-The-Story-of-Nirvana/dp/0385471998/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana</a>&nbsp;by Michael Azerrad. He was able to get close to Cobain and gain his confidence, recording hours of audio interviews with the man on a wide variety of topics.

Director A.J. Schnack has taken these audio-taped conversations and assembled an unorthodox documentary on Cobain entitled About a Son that eschews the usual formula of footage of concerts and talking head soundbites from friends and family for footage of the cities he grew up and lived in: Aberdeen, Olympia, and Seattle.

At times, Cobain mentions a band or a song that influenced him and then it plays over the soundtrack which goes against the trend of populating the documentary with Nirvana songs. It's not surprising that Cobain comes across as a very thoughtful commentator about himself and life in general. The audio tapes allow Cobain's disembodied voice to narrate his own story. After awhile, however, watching About a Son is like listening to an audio commentary from beyond the grave.

""The Voices Behind About a Son"" features Azerrad talking about how he conducted his interviews with Cobain, how he first met him, and so on. Schnack talks about he met Azerrad and pitched the idea of the film to him. Azerrad had resisted using his Cobain tapes in other projects for years but felt that this one was appropriate.

There is a selected scene commentary by director A.J. Schnack. He talks about some of the locations that they shot for the film and their specific connections to Cobain. For example, they were able to shoot in the house where the interviews with him were conducted.

Finally, there is ""On Location: Scouting Video to Scene Comparison"" that takes a look at the differences between the location scouting footage and photographs and the final version in the film.",1203465600,3,2158,5.298245614035087
2991835,4,B000WTZ6M6,"It's nearly impossible to be a pop culture aficionado living here in Seattle and not be reminded of Cobain's profound impact on the music world. Every April, around the anniversary of his death, wreaths of flowers and hand taped notes begin to appear on a lone bench in a tiny  public park sandwiched between the lakefront mansions I pass on my way to work every morning. Inevitably, I will see small groups of young people with multi-colored hair and torn jeans, making their pilgrimage and holding vigil around this makeshift shrine, located a block or two from the home where he took his own life.

""About a Son"" is a reflective and uniquely impressionistic portrait of Cobain's short life. There are none of the usual talking head interviews or performance clips here; in fact there is nary a photo image of Cobain or Nirvana displayed until a good hour into the documentary. Nonetheless, director A.J. Schnack is holding an ace; he was given access to a series of surprisingly frank and intimate audio interviews that Cobain recorded at his Seattle home circa 1992-1993. He marries up Cobain's childhood and teenage recollections with beautifully shot footage of his hometown of Aberdeen and its Washington logging country environs. As Cobain's self-narrated life story moves to Olympia, then inevitably to Seattle, Schnack's POV travelogue follows right along. The combination of Cobain's narrative voice with the visuals has an eerie effect; you begin to feel that you are inside Cobain's temporal memories-kicking aimlessly around the depressing cultural vacuum of a blue collar logging town,walking the halls of his high school, sleeping under a railroad bridge,sitting on a mattress on a crash pad floor and practicing guitar for hours on end.

The film is almost an antithesis to Nick Broomfield's notorious and comparatively sensationalistic documentary ""Kurt and Courtney"". Whereas Broomfield set out with a backhoe to dig up as much dirt as quickly as possible in attempting to uncover Cobain's story, Schnack opts for a more carefully controlled excavation, gently brushing the dirt aside in order to expose the real artifact. And again, in spite of the relative dearth of actual visual images of its subject, ""About a Son"" succeeds in giving us a thoroughly intimate portrait of the artist. I also should give a nod to the fantastic soundtrack (although Nirvana themselves are conspicuously MIA). A unique and moving rockumentary.",1203292800,5,2446,5.171717171717172
2991836,5,B000WTZ6M6,Until now I don't think I have ever seen a film or piece of journalism that has accurately conveyed Cobain's impact on the world and the worlds affect on him.  For most of my teenage years I admired Cobain's punk rock disdain for the press and interviews.  But it made him a very mysterious figure.  Some how this film maker got Kurt to sit down and speak candidly for hours about his life as it pertains to Nirvana.  The cinematography is awesome. You can almost feel his ghost haunting each frame as Kurt's voice narrates the story of Nirvana. This film is really moving.  If you own one film about Nirvanas visual history it should be this one.,1199318400,21,647,4.4491525423728815
2991837,5,B000WTZ6M6,"It is hard to find a single figure that looms larger in recent rock history than Kurt Cobain. It's harder still to come across an artist whose true nature was so obscured, even distorted, by his own legend. About a Son, based on interviews with Come as You Are author Michael Azzerad, offers a rare, sincere, and deeply moving glimpse into Cobain's private world. In the process, it reveals a side of the late musician often left out of sensationalized media portrayals of his life, drug use, and tragic end--he is perceptive, thoughtful, and quietly articulate, reflecting on his experiences with a candor unmatched in other interviews.

What makes the film unusual among documentaries is director AJ Schnack's determination to stay out of the way and allow Cobain to tell his own story. Eschewing the typical documentary format in which the viewer's gaze is focused on the subject, About a Son creates the sense of looking out through Kurt's eyes, seeing the images he would have seen and hearing the music he listened to. There are no Nirvana songs--just the music that inspired and influenced Cobain--and the visuals are a montage of evocative images of Aberdeen, Olympia, and Seattle. Listening to Kurt's sleepy, gravelly narration (most of the interviews were conducted in the wee hours of the morning) against the backdrop of these images elicits the feeling of taking a long stroll and talking intimately with an old friend.

As you stroll through Washington streets slicked with rain, passing floating bundles of Aberdeen timber, punk rock Olympia kids, and the city lights of Seattle, Kurt talks about his parents' divorce, his lifelong sense of isolation, the unexpected consequences of fame, and his unabashed devotion to his wife and daughter. He tells of a life clearly fraught with pain and depression, yet fueled with creative passion. The personality he reveals is one of contradictions: the desire for recognition vs. the desire for solitude; deep concern for humanity vs. revulsion toward humanity's darker side; a harsh reality vs. a longing for the simplicity of childhood.

About a Son is as much a portrait of the Pacific Northwest as it is a rendering of Kurt Cobain. Alongside breathtaking cinematography, Cobain's narrative shows that many of these private contradictions were the product of a deep-seated ambivalence toward his environment. As a child, he was alternately comforted and stifled by small-town Aberdeen; as a budding artist, he was nurtured by Olympia's creativity, yet felt like an outsider; in his Seattle days, he helped place the city on the musical map while deriding media hype about the ""grunge scene.""

As the lone figure of Cobain fades at the film's end, one cannot help but feel the loss of an extraordinary artist--and an extraordinary individual--as he vanishes from sight.",1196640000,63,2827,5.112554112554113
2991888,5,B000WTZ6M6,"The reason I love ""About a Son"" so much is because it's not a group of Rolling Stone staff members talking about Kurt's life as if they knew him personally. It's literally just Kurt talking the entire time. That's important to me.",1417219200,,230,4.5
2991889,5,B000WTZ6M6,"Masterpiece.  Lotta genius, word",1417046400,,32,7.0
2991890,4,B000WTZ6M6,"In the case of Curt Cobain, I am interested in trying to figure out if he committed suicide or if he was murdered.  So I decided to watch this film to see if there are any clues about his death.

Before watching it, I was leaning toward believing that he was murdered.  Now, after watching it, I am nearly 100% convinced that he was murdered.  In addition, I feel that if it is ever proved that Curt Cobain was murdered, the producers of this film should be investigated and possibly tried for conspiracy to cover up a murder.  There are some very suspicious elements in this film.

To my knowledge, there is not enough solid evidence to prove conclusively that Curt Cobain committed suicide.  But this film seems to be deliberately attempting to steer the viewer into believing that it is a fact that he committed suicide.  For example, we hear Curt say several times throughout the film that his stomach pains would get so bad that he considered suicide, specifically blowing his head off.  You might argue that this shows that he was suicidal, and that it reinforces the idea that he committed suicide.  But I think that is exactly what the producer wants you to think.  That is why this film seems suspicious to me.  It seems like the filmmaker is trying hard to push the idea that Curt Cobain definitely committed suicide.

Lots of people talk about the possibility of committing suicide.  But most people never actually do it.  So the fact that Curt Cobain spoke openly about contemplating suicide does not logically prove that he committed suicide.  To be clear, SEVERAL times throughout this film, we hear Curt say that he had contemplated suicide.  But he is always speaking about it in the past tense, not the present tense.  In these interviews, which took place only a year before his death, he does not sound even remotely suicidal.  He speaks about looking to the future, and about being a father.  And he shows genuine concern and love for his daughter.  Considering the love that he shows toward his daughter, I don't believe that there is any chance that he committed suicide.

Another suspicious element of the film is that, at the end, when the screen goes black, it says, ""One year after these interviews were conducted, Curt Cobain committed suicide.""  There is no mention that it was never conclusively proved that it was a suicide.  It's like the producers are telling us that there is no room to question the matter.

One thing that really stinks about this whole thing is that none of Curt's supposed friends in the Seattle music scene (or elsewhere) are standing up and saying, ""Hey, wait a minute.  I'm not convinced that Curt committed suicide.  Let's have a more thorough investigation.""  I've read interviews with members of the Seattle grunge rock community who claim that they were friends with Cobain.  But so far, I've yet to hear any of these so called friends stand up in defense of Curt.  His reputation is at stake.  So why aren't any of his so called friends standing up for him?  Are they all cowards who are afraid that they might get murdered if they say anything in Curt's defense?  Curt Cobain has been found guilty of killing himself.  But he never received a fair trial.

 I did enjoy this film.  But I have to take away one star in my rating due to the suspicious nature of it.",1409097600,,3324,4.63013698630137

2991892,4,B000WTZ6M6,"I bought this as a gift for my friend who is a Nirvana uber fan.  We watched it together, and even if you aren't a big Nirvana-head, the entire DVD is Kurt Cobain talking about his life and his feelings about various things.  It is really fascinating.  It doesn't really address his physical issues that much, nor does it explore how he went from being just another grunge band to super-stardom.  He discusses his artistic process a little and how he wanted to do something different, but doesn't explore how he managed to succeed in that area, so one star off for that.",1400976000,,570,4.504854368932039
2991893,5,B000WTZ6M6,"An interesting look at Cobain's development using audio interviews conducted by Michael Azzerad for Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana.  In the end, the story must end sadly (duh), and left me wondering what Cobain's musical contributions would have been like over the course of the last 20 years.  Also makes me think about the impact his suicide had on his wife and daughter.  In one scene in the interview, Courtney calls down to Kurt and asks him to remember to bring up a bottle of Similac when he came to bed.  Still feel for them.",1399507200,,540,4.479591836734694

This is a very interesting documental if you if you like to get to knoe your idols deeply.
You won't see any image that's actually related to Kurt, though. You get to hear the result of many interviews to kurt, either in person, or by phone, all made by the same man. Meanwhile, you'll see some random images of the places and cities mentioned, and the faces of some people that live there. That's it. It might get a bit dull, specially if you're not used to documentaries.
As a nirvana fan, i totally recomend it. You'll get to know the background of Kurt, how he was raised, his ideas for the band, and for himself, how he felt about his surroundings, etc.
The interviews are from the last year of his life.",1373760000,,748,4.3120567375886525
2991919,5,B000WTZ6M6,"This is a great ""documentary"" if you will, the sad thing is Kurt is not around anymore. But if you like his music, you can really get to know more stuff about where it comes from in his mind.
In my opinion, this is for hardcore fans and/or people really interested on music (music geeks or something like that). I think it might not work for you if you're not in one of those categories. This is voice recording footage, not the actual interview video. What you see are images of the places Kurt mentions during the interview.

The packaging and shipping was OK.",1367712000,,562,4.403846153846154
2991920,5,B000WTZ6M6,"Kurt struggled in life and definitely did not have it easy, yet was able to express his pain/disillusionment/frustration, etc., through his music, which was quite in one's face and unapologetic.  It was both a physical and emotional outlet and was therefore something he, having a highly creative and artistic mind, could throw himself into and be passionate about.  Kurt was actually a pretty shy and mild-mannered guy in real life, but no one would ever know it listening to his music: it was Kurt at his strongest and most outspoken.  He did it, initially for himself, but ended up touching and inspiring (and in many ways helping) countless numbers of people through his art.  I would say, he might have inspired me to turn my vulnerability into something productive and potentially healthy (i.e., expression/emotional release through music), which could, in turn, serve to help others who are also having a tough time yet might lack the creative faculties to be able to express it themselves.  Anyone finding themselves at a creative crossroad would greatly benefit from watching this documentary.",1361664000,,1102,5.134078212290503

2991923,1,B000WTZ6M6,"The spoken words of Kurt Cobain would be GREAT to experience. Fortunately, this doc has them. Unfortunately, they are presented in such a farcical way as to make this film unwatchable.

About A Son would have been fantastic if not for this film's absurd stylizing fantasies. Putting so much farce into the images, it forces a viewer into the mind-boggling conflict of wanting to stay, for the Cobain audio, yet repulsed by the distracting imagery competing with - no, mocking - the powerful heartfelt voice.

Hopefully these interviews are available elsewhere, without the director trying to out-shine the real star. The words of Kurt Cobain are very powerful. Trying to give them even more power is just an insult, Schnack.",1342656000,,724,5.025
2991924,2,B000WTZ6M6,"I thought that this film was really lacking on two fronts.  First, I don't that that the interviewer (Michael Azerrad) penetrates very deeply into Kurt's psyche or brings out his insightfulness really at all.  (One reviewer of this film remarked that Kurt was ""as deep as a puddle."")  But given that these interviews were done in 1993 and 1994, Nirvana was at the height of its fame, and you might imagine that Kurt might not be so forthcoming with an interviewer.  (At one point, Cobain says, ""I hate journalists.""  The awkwardness is broken with Kurt's laughter.)  Somewhat counterintuitively, I found Azzerrad's book, which I read several years ago and which these interviews formed the basis, impressive and one of the better books on Nirvana.  I am probably coming off as an apologist for Cobain, and I probably am, since I do think he was a very talented person whose music we are blessed to have.

The other place it lacked was in the cinematography.  Most of the film is just scenes of Washington state and people and at the end there are some pictures of Cobain.  I guess this could have been better done or had Nirvana pictures throughout, or family pictures (seems appropriate, given the title) or something interesting, not semi-related landscapes and people irrelevant to anything about Nirvana.

Being a Nirvana fan, I'd already heard a lot of the interviews or bits of information before, either ocyoutube or elsewhere.  Somebody completely new to Nirvana or looking for Kurt Cobain might find some benefit; Cobain does talk a lot about his family and upbringing and feeling like an outsider.  I could see how an older person watching with a group of friends (or somebody whose not a fan) thinking Cobain is being self-indulgent at times, too, to be fair, but I also think he was often frank in his responses to questions.",1324166400,,1837,4.830670926517572

2991948,4,B000WTZ6M6,"Unless someone magically comes across one lying in a box somewhere, we are never going to get a Kurt Cobain autobiography. The closest thing we'll get is ""Kurt Cobain - About a Son,"" a documentary cobbled out of Michael Azerrad's interviews with the late rock'n'roll star -- and Cobain both explores his own past and strips away some of his legends.

The interviews took place in the early nineties over the course of a few months, about a year before Cobain's tragic death. Some are in person, and a few are over the phone. They're pleasantly informal and laid-back, since Cobain munches on a sandwich during one segment, and is occasionally interrupted by Courtney.

Over the course of several interviews, Cobain reflects on his life before rock stardom -- his childhood and his hometown, his formative years of mischief, his love of punk rock, his desire to be a rock star, and the early days of Nirvana. Cobain also contemplated drugs, health problems, his allure to flies, his quirky art, Courtney Love, fatherhood, turtles, misanthropy, death, oregano, journalists (I guess Azerrad was an exception), his bandmates, being onstage, the future of rock'n'roll, and his own reputation.

Since the interviews were taped with sound only, director AJ Schnack fills the screen with soundless, strangely ambient images from Seattle, Olympia and Aberdeen. Musicians, stores, logging machines, streets, forests, houses and faces pass by quietly -- as well as some weird cartoons. It feels a little like a nostalgic look through Cobain's own eyes.

Cobain himself was a remarkable person who has been overshadowed by his own posthumous legend (even when he was alive). In these interviews, he sounds like an intelligent man sitting down to have a frank conversation with a friend -- he sounds relaxed, laid-back and mostly at peace with his life as it then was, particularly when talking about his child (he recounts how when he saw her in a sonagram, she was making the ""hook 'em horns""). He has a lot of funny anecdotes, and a childlike fascination with the world that is truly endearing.

But as the interviews go on, we start seeing the multifaceted, contradictory creature that Cobain was -- darkness/light, loathing/fascination with people, childlike/painfully mature, earnest/jaded, passionate/lazy, craving fame yet somewhat disgusted by it.

It's obvious he had learned a lot from his past, since he spends a lot of time analyzing his own youthful mind and how people saw him (""I usually am enjoying myself; I'm hardly ever depressed anymore""). Near the end, he even comments that his own personal problems are not unusual or the worst, showing that he had grown up a lot -- when asked if his was a sad story, Cobain laughs and says, ""No... not really, I mean... it's nothing that's amazing or new, that's for sure.""

And Cobain made some eerily prophetic statements as well -- he complains about rock'n'roll (""It's sad to think what the state of rock'n'roll will be in about twenty years from now..."") and discusses death (""If I was gonna blow my head off with a gun, I may as well take the risk of dying from drugs"").

""Kurt Cobain: About a Son"" is a bittersweet experience -- it offers some truly beautiful insights into the mind of a true artist, but leaves you wishing he hadn't departed quite so soon.",1301529600,7,3310,4.929982046678636

2991952,5,B000WTZ6M6,"For himself, Kurt Cobain did one thing exactly right and that was give this audio interview. I love that it was conducted at midnight, or early in the morning giving a beautiful witching-hour feel. The first time I saw it was on netflix and had no idea what it was other than being drawn by his face on the cover. I almost got bored at the start and turned it off because I thought it was a reinactment and completely fake. I wasn't even sure it was about him, I thought maybe I had misunderstood the title and it was just an allusion to him.

The film just starts. No mention of his name or who is talking or what the visuals are. I wasn't even sure it was his voice I was hearing. In fact, I was sure it wasn't him. A friend, maybe. Or the director. But not him. The person speaking sounded so strangely normal. Slowly, tho, the realization that it might actually be Cobain talking, and then that it *must* be him talking and could be no one else, evolves. And, then, just wow - I was sucked right in. It's like listening to a private conversation and I was astonished by his authetic, unhurried, un-caring-to-entertain-anyone-whatsoever self.

After I'd realized it was his voice, I watched it dawned on me, again, slowly, that the film was scouting real locations specifically-personal to Cobain's life, and was illustrating what he's talking about. I assumed this for quite awhile because I also thought that might be wishful thinking on my part. But no. Listening to him talk you eventually realize are staring at his old room, old houses, old haunts. Did he really sleep in this trashed room? Or go to see bands in this bar? Or sit in this library when he was homeless? Really?

And, then, that's when the profundity of the film sunk in for me. In 50 years from now when all these places no longer exist, when the place his dad worked at is a Condo complex and the libray is torn down remodelled and that house is demolished this little unassuming, yet incredibly-powerful film will be a historical-marker to which nothing else will really compare.

How this sensitive but unglamorus movie ended-up riveting and shellshocking me with perfect unassuming subtly by Cobain's accepting-of-himself demenor, his story which asks for no mercy whatsoever, and voice that suggests he was much more than rocker, punk, rebel, any of that music-industry posturing becomes completely fabulous because you realize: it doesn't even matter if you see him. You end-up seeing so much more by not seeing him for the vast majority of the film. It's not about his photogenic-face. It really was his voice. And this movie showcases that and the man.

The people responsible for this film did everything right. It's so simple and brilliantly-genius to let his words, fully, do the talking; no mtv-style editing, flash, or dazzle. And, slowly but surely, you are curiously-brought along into the story without a single ounce of force or even invitation from the director or Kurt himself. And, then you realize why you like his music as Cobain tells it all just like the poet he is - without trying, just 'being'. Cliched, it may sound, but astoundingly, and with a much-retained innocence, Cobain cites the uncomplaining tale that shaped him.

If this was Kurt Cobain when the mask of the music-machine and it's industry was pulled aside, all I can say is: I aspire to his thoughtful, responsible, but unapologetic self-acceptance. Watch this film when you're in the mood to unwrap an engima and view one human's soul. He's the modern, male version of our beloved Alice in Wonderland, forever falling down the rabbit hole but never really losing his way at all. A film of pure autobiography, without steering or tainting. It's vulnerable without ever being crass. No one is trying to shock. But the shock ends up being Cobain's perfect, quiet self-possession. To-date, it's the most authentic, stand-alone surviving way to experience Kurt genius, artistry, and uncomplicated humanity. I listen to him explain his prolific life and I hear reflected back the similarly-spoke artistic plights of Mozart.

It's a poignent, slow-savored treasure for any fan of Cobain or Nirvana but it's equally great for lovers of the creative process, and people who, somehow, manage blindly to retain the unstoppable faith to follow their passions, come what may. And Kurt Cobain was all those things - and a little bit more, besides.",1280016000,14,4399,4.810846560846561

2991954,4,B000WTZ6M6,"Unless someone magically comes across one lying in a box somewhere, we are never going to get a Kurt Cobain autobiography. The closest thing we'll get is ""Kurt Cobain - About a Son,"" a documentary cobbled out of Michael Azerrad's interviews with the late rock'n'roll star -- and Cobain both explores his own past and strips away some of his legends.

The interviews took place in the early nineties over the course of a few months, about a year before Cobain's tragic death. Some are in person, and a few are over the phone. They're pleasantly informal and laid-back, since Cobain munches on a sandwich during one segment, and is occasionally interrupted by Courtney.

Over the course of several interviews, Cobain reflects on his life before rock stardom -- his childhood and his hometown, his formative years of mischief, his love of punk rock, his desire to be a rock star, and the early days of Nirvana. Cobain also contemplated drugs, health problems, his allure to flies, his quirky art, Courtney Love, fatherhood, turtles, misanthropy, death, oregano, journalists (I guess Azerrad was an exception), his bandmates, being onstage, the future of rock'n'roll, and his own reputation.

Since the interviews were taped with sound only, director AJ Schnack fills the screen with soundless, strangely ambient images from Seattle, Olympia and Aberdeen. Musicians, stores, logging machines, streets, forests, houses and faces pass by quietly -- as well as some weird cartoons. It feels a little like a nostalgic look through Cobain's own eyes.

Cobain himself was a remarkable person who has been overshadowed by his own posthumous legend (even when he was alive). In these interviews, he sounds like an intelligent man sitting down to have a frank conversation with a friend -- he sounds relaxed, laid-back and mostly at peace with his life as it then was, particularly when talking about his child (he recounts how when he saw her in a sonagram, she was making the ""hook 'em horns""). He has a lot of funny anecdotes, and a childlike fascination with the world that is truly endearing.

But as the interviews go on, we start seeing the multifaceted, contradictory creature that Cobain was -- darkness/light, loathing/fascination with people, childlike/painfully mature, earnest/jaded, passionate/lazy, craving fame yet somewhat disgusted by it.

It's obvious he had learned a lot from his past, since he spends a lot of time analyzing his own youthful mind and how people saw him (""I usually am enjoying myself; I'm hardly ever depressed anymore""). Near the end, he even comments that his own personal problems are not unusual or the worst, showing that he had grown up a lot -- when asked if his was a sad story, Cobain laughs and says, ""No... not really, I mean... it's nothing that's amazing or new, that's for sure.""

And Cobain made some eerily prophetic statements as well -- he complains about rock'n'roll (""It's sad to think what the state of rock'n'roll will be in about twenty years from now..."") and discusses death (""If I was gonna blow my head off with a gun, I may as well take the risk of dying from drugs"").

""Kurt Cobain: About a Son"" is a bittersweet experience -- it offers some truly beautiful insights into the mind of a true artist, but leaves you wishing he hadn't departed quite so soon.",1276732800,18,3310,4.929982046678636

2991957,5,B000WTZ6M6,"My formative years were The Grunge Years.  I was the perfect age for this, coming into my teens with Nirvana and having Kurt Cobain be my patron saint.  However, looking back on that time, perhaps the timing was just perfect for me as well as the rest of the world.  I admired Kurt, but became disillusioned as time went on.  He would die, and I and the rest of the Gen X kids grew up without him.  It was a very special experience, as well as a haunting one to hear his voice from beyond the grave.  What was even more haunting about this was the fact that we hardly see any images of Kurt in the movie, mostly stills of his hometown of Aberdeen and Seattle, and nameless people on the streets.  Kurt was the voice of disillusioned youth that we see on the streets in this film, and in many ways still is.

Kurt tells us about his childhood, his teen years, his stomach, his becoming a musician, and his epic rise to fame.  Who better to tell you than the man himself?  Courtney Love, today the infamous tabloid queen she is, is barely in it (thank God), but will always be linked to Kurt and Nirvana's story, nor is Dave or Krist except for a brief mention or photograph here and there.  The voice takes you into his world, making you feel like you are really there with him in his mind.  His alienation and feelings of inadequacy really speak to the viewer, making you feel and understand so many things about him.  There were so many conflicts and feelings to explore, too many to list here in a review.

And now, he's gone.  He left us because ... Well, just because.  He left behind his music, he was an artist, he touched people's lives, including mine.  Kurt wanted to give us his statement, and his project ended up being the last great rock band to close out the twentieth century.  The memories are wonderful, his music is timeless, and he lived by his own terms, and he was human instead of a god.",1259798400,3,1909,4.299719887955182

2991991,1,B000WTZ6M6,"Let me first state that I am a huge fan of Kurt Cobain and have been since the late `80s when Bleach was first released. I was a huge fan of the music coming out of the Pacific Northwest at that time: Mudhoney, Mother Love Bone, the Melvins, Soundgarden, etc. I still love the music even as I'm approaching my 40s.

This documentary should have been released as an audio CD. If it had to be released as a film, at least it should have been subtitled against a black screen. That would have been more palatable than the highbrow visual pap, which the visuals are comprised of. The interviews were highly insightful, but the images were terribly disconnected and removed from the zeitgeist that was the alternative scene of the late `80s and early `90s. Grunge was against social conventions, somewhat nilhlistic, and rebelled against the prevailing conditions and fashions of the time. It brought about the demise of hair metal, fortunately. As such, the visual imagery of this film was anathema to that spirit. I felt like I was watching an overwrought, pretentious piece of ""artsy fartsy"" filming akin to a perfume commercial. I should have just closed my eyes and listened. It left a very bad taste in me, only redeemed by Kurt's spoken words, which were captivating . Kurt stated in the film numerous times how he identified with Punk Rock. A true punk rocker would be appalled at the blatant commercialism of the imagery. I was repulsed by it. The only saving grace is the interviews themselves, which I highly recommend listening to.

There are no Nirvana recordings in the film (though you'll hear some classic rock and punk tracks by the likes of Queen, Bowie, The Vaselines, and other acts who inspired Kurt Cobain).  The interviews with Cobain are filled with thoughtful, poignant comments, social commentary, and very candid autobiographical material recorded in the last 2 years before Cobain's death.  The scenery in Washington State ranges from the majestic Cascades and evergreens to the mundane of local clubs, libraries, and unkempt apartments.  The score for this film is actually quite beautiful, it has nice ambient guitar work and is rather haunting, accentuated by the physical absence of Cobain, who appears in the film only in a photo montage near the end.

2992019,4,B000WTZ6M6,"If you were hoping for a second chance to crawl inside the mind of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, this is it, but the experience may not be quite what you expected it to be. As a documentary, ""About a Son"" is about as rewarding as it is frustrating. On one hand, it offers unparalleled access to Cobain's thoughts, since it is compiled exclusively from interview tapes. On the other hand, the video footage plays like a Travel Channel documentary for the State of Washington. You get to hear the contradictory nature of Cobain as he discusses points of inspiration and frustration, but there is virtually none of Nirvana's music to support his commentary. For the first hour, you don't even get to see Cobain's face, not even in photos. Instead, the film juxtaposes scenic shots of Washington with seemingly random faces from the area, as an attempt at capturing Cobain's environment.
""About a Son"" compiles the psychological profile of a happy kid sliding into neurosis, depression and anti-social behavior. Cobain is forthcoming, but his own self-doubt and suspicious nature forces the viewer to question the degree of his honesty. His take on his own victimization is self-evident, but his view on his own self-perceived shortcomings and his drug use are dependent on his ability to be honest with himself. He claims that chronic digestive pain inspired thoughts of suicide, but later says ""I hadn't had any stomach pain when I started doing drugs."" Is that the truth, or is it a rationalization? The film doesn't answer the question so much as it presents the contradiction for the viewer's own interpretation. Ultimately, ""About a Son"" is a psychological study consisting of self-analytical interviews juxtaposed over third-party footage. Does it succeed? That depends entirely on your ability to suspend your own frustration.  B Tom Ryan",1207180800,,1842,5.079207920792079
2992020,2,B000WTZ6M6,"I had actually been really excited about seeing this film.  I was 18 in 1992 and just idolized Nirvana.  Sixteen years later I still have a soft spot in my heart for Kurt Cobain.

This film was ridiculously terrible!  In my opinion, it had no business being a film.  The substance of the movie comes from taped conversations between Michael Azerrad and Kurt Cobain that Azerrad used for his book Come As You Are:  The Story of Nirvana.  With the prodding of Azerrad's interview questions, Cobain reveals facets of his personality, interesting anecdotes about his life, and insight into the person he was.

However, AJ Schnack adds NOTHING to the story by turning this material into a film.  Sure, there are a few generic shots of the neighborhood where Cobain grew up, where his father worked, and other places Cobain frequented, but this could easily be shown as photographs.  In my opinion, Azerrad himself should have released the tapes and included a booklet of photographs of Cobain's haunts, of Cobain himself, as this is all this film really is.

But the rest of the fluff Schnack added, in my opinion, was plain stupid and annoying!  For example, when Cobain would be telling a story that happened in a library, you would be listening to his voice, but then looking at the inside of a library.  I know what a library looks like, I don't feel like I need such obvious visual cues!  The same thing would occur when Cobain would be telling a story that happened in school, a lumberyard... wherever.  I didn't feel like looking at the halls of a high school or a bunch of logs being moved really added anything to the story.

What I found the most irritating, though, was the way Schnack would take have these random people look, with forced sad and empty expressions on their faces, at the camera and just stand there.  I felt this was Schnack's sorry attempt to be artistic.  I felt like he was trying really hard to make an artistic statement with these people (who I guess were supposed to represent ""everyday Americans"", ""alienated youth"", and the like), but it really just didn't seem to have anything to do with Kurt Cobain and the story he was revealing.  Perhaps if these shots had been of kids in the 90s, dressed the way we did those days, like the kids in the video for ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", it would have seemed relevant.  But they were just people living and looking like they do in the first decade of the 21st century, and I have no idea what this was supposed to do with Kurt Cobain.

Of course, there is no music by Nirvana in the entire film; I believe I heard he couldn't get the rights to the music from the people who now own it.  Sure, it was interesting to hear the music that influenced Cobain, but what a movie about him with none of his actual work just seems empty.

My last complaint about the film has to do with the printed words at the end of the film that claim Cobain committed suicide a year later.  From my understanding, Cobain only allegedly committed suicide.  There is a lot of evidence that suggests a certain person had Cobain murdered.  A film about Kurt Cobain, I would think, should at least set forward truthful, verifiable information about him.

This film is worth renting (don't make the mistake of buying it, like I did) just to hear Cobain's stories in his own voice.  But don't expect to gain much from the visual content from the film.  In fact, I feel it may have been more enjoyable to simply have listened to it with the screen turned off.",1207008000,14,3504,4.526232114467408

2992024,3,B000WTZ6M6,"I purchased this DVD through Amazon and have only watched it once, so this review is based on one viewing on the small screen, 12 hours after the fact.  I had a variety of reactions to the film.  Early on, it seemed to drag a bit and I felt like it could have been an audio piece instead of video.  I didn't feel like the visuals really added much in the first hour or so of the film.

But the format grew on me as the film went on and I was accustomed to it by the end.  The effect of seemingly random photographs and video snippets shown to the sound of (usually) one side of a conversation with Kurt Cobain was a kind of disconnect that was probably intentional, but tended to be off-putting at first. If you watch the film on DVD, be sure to watch the extra features, in which Azerrad and Schnack explain the work and some of the choices they made.  These featurettes put the film in a better perspective, and made me appreciate what I had seen a bit more.

This film is probably best described as a companion to Azerrad's book, and readers of ""Come As You Are"" will recognize portions of Cobain's words in the film from the book.  That being said, ""About A Son"" does not seem to be something a casual fan would really enjoy - I would only recommend it to Nirvana/Cobain die-hards and completists.

The movie seemed to be missing something, and that something was the music of Nirvana. I thought it was a nice touch to include music that Cobain appreciated, but I really feel like it would have been a better and more complete ""documentary"" with music and performances by (or at the very least, more photos of,) Cobain and Nirvana.  I don't know if Schnack et al were unable to obtain the rights to these types of materials for financial or other reasons, but the film really suffered in my opinion for the lack of the very music that was being discussed. It felt incomplete, which again may have been intentional. But if it was intentional, I feel it was the wrong choice - this film needed more Nirvana. I can understand not wanting to have tired, old photographs, performances, and music dominate the film - leave that to ""Behind the Music"" and its copycats - but leaving that type of material out entirely made the film suffer, in my opinion.

All that being said, ""About a Son"" is a powerful film for fans of Nirvana. It is a warts-and-all look at Kurt Cobain the person (as opposed to Cobain the musician or Cobain the unwilling generation spokesman.) Parts are funny, parts are informative, and parts are just plain sad. It angered me to hear Cobain's rationalizing of his drug problem and it spooked me to hear him discuss his own death (even mentioning blowing his own head off at one point,) in interviews recorded a relatively short time before it happened. For the faults I felt it had, the film was touching and well-made.  I am very glad I watched this movie, but I am not sure I need to own it and doubt I will watch it again.",1205193600,2,2945,4.38348623853211
2992025,5,B000WTZ6M6,"This movie was a moving experience; I took my son to see ""About a Son"" at an artsy theater in Chicago on his 15th birthday. Knowing we both enjoy Nirvana, I nonetheless braced myself for a grungy ""sentimental journey."" But then to our rapt enjoyment, this movie turned out NOT to be the typical ""between the eyes"" rockumentary crammed with repetitively familiar nostalgic imagery and dubbed in with music from the artist. In short this was not a nauseating musical rock video shrine. FYI - you don't see Kurt's or any band member's face. And you don't hear any music from Nirvana - and, you don't need to.

Instead, ""About a Son"" takes you through the Pacific Northwest, tastefully focusing on images that trace the words in Kurt's interview. I was very taken by the seamless ""being there"" feel of this film, as though the narration was in real-time with what was being shown visually.

All-in-all ""About a Son"" was highly-creative in combining fact with visual interpretation - and in doing so among the best ""rockumentaries"" I've watched. It is an interpretation of images, selected to match what Kurt was saying. You had a feel for him as a child and teen, his core family and the disintegration of it, for the deprivation he lived through, for the music he listened to, a discussion about babies and bottles, and some saddening foreshadowing of his suicide a year after the interview.

Would this movie stand on its own without knowledge and/or a fondness for Kurt Cobain and his music? Actually, I believe it would be interesting in and of itself - even if you had never known of Kurt - or never heard Nirvana's music. It is a warm yet subtle film about an interesting and likeable guy, whose immense creativity and drive sprang from humble and confining surroundings. Kurt would have liked ""About a Son"" for not being banal and obvious. The power is in its simplicity.

I just bought the DVD and I'm anxiously looking forward to another viewing on a smaller screen. Oh - also an interesting soundtrack works wonders without incorporating Nirvana's songs. My son and I waited to listen to Nirvana on the way home.",1204761600,4,2118,4.7317073170731705

This DVD was so bad because they never showed any live Cobain or Nirvana music, and they never even showed Kurt's face when we was talking.  It was just a bunch of dumb clips from where Kurt has been in the past.  This is seriously a boring DVD, and no one should buy it.

I do think it's cool how much Kurt talks about his life, but theres only his voice. Curt, Dave, and Christ aren't in this movie for a second.",1204243200,3,528,3.943396226415094

The images of Seattle and environs could almost stand alone as visual commentary on real people of the Northwest. It serves here as a backdrop for a recorded interview with Kurt Cobain. When I got this I was hoping for rare footage of pre-fame performances, interviews with people who knew him along the way, etc.  I am speculating that the producers of this film were unable to get the rights to any Kurt Cobain material other than the recorded interview. This is obviously a well-intentioned film, but for me it just didn't work, either as a tribute, or as a documentary. I was never a Nirvana fan but I like their music when I hear it. I had hoped this film would make me a believer. Without his music, or footage of him performing (or any footage of Kurt Cobain at all for that matter) etc., voice-over Cobain sort of comes off as a somewhat petulant, whiny individual, although his honesty is refreshing.  I did get the sense from watching this that Kurt Cobain incarnated to be exactly who he turned out to be, and that luck notwithstanding, cream does rise to the surface.

3226331,4,B000WTZ6M6,"Since Kurt Cobain's death in 1994, many books have been written about him and his band Nirvana that try to get the real story about the musician and reluctant rock star. Arguably, the best book about him is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Come-As-You-Are-The-Story-of-Nirvana/dp/0385471998/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana</a>&nbsp;by Michael Azerrad. He was able to get close to Cobain and gain his confidence, recording hours of audio interviews with the man on a wide variety of topics.

Director A.J. Schnack has taken these audio-taped conversations and assembled an unorthodox documentary on Cobain entitled About a Son that eschews the usual formula of footage of concerts and talking head soundbites from friends and family for footage of the cities he grew up and lived in: Aberdeen, Olympia, and Seattle.

At times, Cobain mentions a band or a song that influenced him and then it plays over the soundtrack which goes against the trend of populating the documentary with Nirvana songs. It's not surprising that Cobain comes across as a very thoughtful commentator about himself and life in general. The audio tapes allow Cobain's disembodied voice to narrate his own story. After awhile, however, watching About a Son is like listening to an audio commentary from beyond the grave.

""The Voices Behind About a Son"" features Azerrad talking about how he conducted his interviews with Cobain, how he first met him, and so on. Schnack talks about he met Azerrad and pitched the idea of the film to him. Azerrad had resisted using his Cobain tapes in other projects for years but felt that this one was appropriate.

There is a selected scene commentary by director A.J. Schnack. He talks about some of the locations that they shot for the film and their specific connections to Cobain. For example, they were able to shoot in the house where the interviews with him were conducted.

Finally, there is ""On Location: Scouting Video to Scene Comparison"" that takes a look at the differences between the location scouting footage and photographs and the final version in the film.",1203465600,3,2158,5.298245614035087
3226332,4,B000WTZ6M6,"It's nearly impossible to be a pop culture aficionado living here in Seattle and not be reminded of Cobain's profound impact on the music world. Every April, around the anniversary of his death, wreaths of flowers and hand taped notes begin to appear on a lone bench in a tiny  public park sandwiched between the lakefront mansions I pass on my way to work every morning. Inevitably, I will see small groups of young people with multi-colored hair and torn jeans, making their pilgrimage and holding vigil around this makeshift shrine, located a block or two from the home where he took his own life.

""About a Son"" is a reflective and uniquely impressionistic portrait of Cobain's short life. There are none of the usual talking head interviews or performance clips here; in fact there is nary a photo image of Cobain or Nirvana displayed until a good hour into the documentary. Nonetheless, director A.J. Schnack is holding an ace; he was given access to a series of surprisingly frank and intimate audio interviews that Cobain recorded at his Seattle home circa 1992-1993. He marries up Cobain's childhood and teenage recollections with beautifully shot footage of his hometown of Aberdeen and its Washington logging country environs. As Cobain's self-narrated life story moves to Olympia, then inevitably to Seattle, Schnack's POV travelogue follows right along. The combination of Cobain's narrative voice with the visuals has an eerie effect; you begin to feel that you are inside Cobain's temporal memories-kicking aimlessly around the depressing cultural vacuum of a blue collar logging town,walking the halls of his high school, sleeping under a railroad bridge,sitting on a mattress on a crash pad floor and practicing guitar for hours on end.

The film is almost an antithesis to Nick Broomfield's notorious and comparatively sensationalistic documentary ""Kurt and Courtney"". Whereas Broomfield set out with a backhoe to dig up as much dirt as quickly as possible in attempting to uncover Cobain's story, Schnack opts for a more carefully controlled excavation, gently brushing the dirt aside in order to expose the real artifact. And again, in spite of the relative dearth of actual visual images of its subject, ""About a Son"" succeeds in giving us a thoroughly intimate portrait of the artist. I also should give a nod to the fantastic soundtrack (although Nirvana themselves are conspicuously MIA). A unique and moving rockumentary.",1203292800,5,2446,5.171717171717172
3226333,5,B000WTZ6M6,Until now I don't think I have ever seen a film or piece of journalism that has accurately conveyed Cobain's impact on the world and the worlds affect on him.  For most of my teenage years I admired Cobain's punk rock disdain for the press and interviews.  But it made him a very mysterious figure.  Some how this film maker got Kurt to sit down and speak candidly for hours about his life as it pertains to Nirvana.  The cinematography is awesome. You can almost feel his ghost haunting each frame as Kurt's voice narrates the story of Nirvana. This film is really moving.  If you own one film about Nirvanas visual history it should be this one.,1199318400,21,647,4.4491525423728815
3226334,5,B000WTZ6M6,"It is hard to find a single figure that looms larger in recent rock history than Kurt Cobain. It's harder still to come across an artist whose true nature was so obscured, even distorted, by his own legend. About a Son, based on interviews with Come as You Are author Michael Azzerad, offers a rare, sincere, and deeply moving glimpse into Cobain's private world. In the process, it reveals a side of the late musician often left out of sensationalized media portrayals of his life, drug use, and tragic end--he is perceptive, thoughtful, and quietly articulate, reflecting on his experiences with a candor unmatched in other interviews.

What makes the film unusual among documentaries is director AJ Schnack's determination to stay out of the way and allow Cobain to tell his own story. Eschewing the typical documentary format in which the viewer's gaze is focused on the subject, About a Son creates the sense of looking out through Kurt's eyes, seeing the images he would have seen and hearing the music he listened to. There are no Nirvana songs--just the music that inspired and influenced Cobain--and the visuals are a montage of evocative images of Aberdeen, Olympia, and Seattle. Listening to Kurt's sleepy, gravelly narration (most of the interviews were conducted in the wee hours of the morning) against the backdrop of these images elicits the feeling of taking a long stroll and talking intimately with an old friend.

As you stroll through Washington streets slicked with rain, passing floating bundles of Aberdeen timber, punk rock Olympia kids, and the city lights of Seattle, Kurt talks about his parents' divorce, his lifelong sense of isolation, the unexpected consequences of fame, and his unabashed devotion to his wife and daughter. He tells of a life clearly fraught with pain and depression, yet fueled with creative passion. The personality he reveals is one of contradictions: the desire for recognition vs. the desire for solitude; deep concern for humanity vs. revulsion toward humanity's darker side; a harsh reality vs. a longing for the simplicity of childhood.

About a Son is as much a portrait of the Pacific Northwest as it is a rendering of Kurt Cobain. Alongside breathtaking cinematography, Cobain's narrative shows that many of these private contradictions were the product of a deep-seated ambivalence toward his environment. As a child, he was alternately comforted and stifled by small-town Aberdeen; as a budding artist, he was nurtured by Olympia's creativity, yet felt like an outsider; in his Seattle days, he helped place the city on the musical map while deriding media hype about the ""grunge scene.""

As the lone figure of Cobain fades at the film's end, one cannot help but feel the loss of an extraordinary artist--and an extraordinary individual--as he vanishes from sight.",1196640000,63,2827,5.112554112554113

3226387,4,B000WTZ6M6,"In the case of Curt Cobain, I am interested in trying to figure out if he committed suicide or if he was murdered.  So I decided to watch this film to see if there are any clues about his death.

Before watching it, I was leaning toward believing that he was murdered.  Now, after watching it, I am nearly 100% convinced that he was murdered.  In addition, I feel that if it is ever proved that Curt Cobain was murdered, the producers of this film should be investigated and possibly tried for conspiracy to cover up a murder.  There are some very suspicious elements in this film.

To my knowledge, there is not enough solid evidence to prove conclusively that Curt Cobain committed suicide.  But this film seems to be deliberately attempting to steer the viewer into believing that it is a fact that he committed suicide.  For example, we hear Curt say several times throughout the film that his stomach pains would get so bad that he considered suicide, specifically blowing his head off.  You might argue that this shows that he was suicidal, and that it reinforces the idea that he committed suicide.  But I think that is exactly what the producer wants you to think.  That is why this film seems suspicious to me.  It seems like the filmmaker is trying hard to push the idea that Curt Cobain definitely committed suicide.

Lots of people talk about the possibility of committing suicide.  But most people never actually do it.  So the fact that Curt Cobain spoke openly about contemplating suicide does not logically prove that he committed suicide.  To be clear, SEVERAL times throughout this film, we hear Curt say that he had contemplated suicide.  But he is always speaking about it in the past tense, not the present tense.  In these interviews, which took place only a year before his death, he does not sound even remotely suicidal.  He speaks about looking to the future, and about being a father.  And he shows genuine concern and love for his daughter.  Considering the love that he shows toward his daughter, I don't believe that there is any chance that he committed suicide.

Another suspicious element of the film is that, at the end, when the screen goes black, it says, ""One year after these interviews were conducted, Curt Cobain committed suicide.""  There is no mention that it was never conclusively proved that it was a suicide.  It's like the producers are telling us that there is no room to question the matter.

One thing that really stinks about this whole thing is that none of Curt's supposed friends in the Seattle music scene (or elsewhere) are standing up and saying, ""Hey, wait a minute.  I'm not convinced that Curt committed suicide.  Let's have a more thorough investigation.""  I've read interviews with members of the Seattle grunge rock community who claim that they were friends with Cobain.  But so far, I've yet to hear any of these so called friends stand up in defense of Curt.  His reputation is at stake.  So why aren't any of his so called friends standing up for him?  Are they all cowards who are afraid that they might get murdered if they say anything in Curt's defense?  Curt Cobain has been found guilty of killing himself.  But he never received a fair trial.

 I did enjoy this film.  But I have to take away one star in my rating due to the suspicious nature of it.",1409097600,,3324,4.63013698630137

It was both a physical and emotional outlet and was therefore something he, having a highly creative and artistic mind, could throw himself into and be passionate about.  Kurt was actually a pretty shy and mild-mannered guy in real life, but no one would ever know it listening to his music: it was Kurt at his strongest and most outspoken.  He did it, initially for himself, but ended up touching and inspiring (and in many ways helping) countless numbers of people through his art.  I would say, he might have inspired me to turn my vulnerability into something productive and potentially healthy (i.e., expression/emotional release through music), which could, in turn, serve to help others who are also having a tough time yet might lack the creative faculties to be able to express it themselves.

About A Son would have been fantastic if not for this film's absurd stylizing fantasies. Putting so much farce into the images, it forces a viewer into the mind-boggling conflict of wanting to stay, for the Cobain audio, yet repulsed by the distracting imagery competing with - no, mocking - the powerful heartfelt voice.

Hopefully these interviews are available elsewhere, without the director trying to out-shine the real star. The words of Kurt Cobain are very powerful. Trying to give them even more power is just an insult, Schnack.",1342656000,,724,5.025
3226421,2,B000WTZ6M6,"I thought that this film was really lacking on two fronts.  First, I don't that that the interviewer (Michael Azerrad) penetrates very deeply into Kurt's psyche or brings out his insightfulness really at all.  (One reviewer of this film remarked that Kurt was ""as deep as a puddle."")  But given that these interviews were done in 1993 and 1994, Nirvana was at the height of its fame, and you might imagine that Kurt might not be so forthcoming with an interviewer.  (At one point, Cobain says, ""I hate journalists.""  The awkwardness is broken with Kurt's laughter.)  Somewhat counterintuitively, I found Azzerrad's book, which I read several years ago and which these interviews formed the basis, impressive and one of the better books on Nirvana.  I am probably coming off as an apologist for Cobain, and I probably am, since I do think he was a very talented person whose music we are blessed to have.

The other place it lacked was in the cinematography.  Most of the film is just scenes of Washington state and people and at the end there are some pictures of Cobain.  I guess this could have been better done or had Nirvana pictures throughout, or family pictures (seems appropriate, given the title) or something interesting, not semi-related landscapes and people irrelevant to anything about Nirvana.

Being a Nirvana fan, I'd already heard a lot of the interviews or bits of information before, either ocyoutube or elsewhere.  Somebody completely new to Nirvana or looking for Kurt Cobain might find some benefit; Cobain does talk a lot about his family and upbringing and feeling like an outsider.  I could see how an older person watching with a group of friends (or somebody whose not a fan) thinking Cobain is being self-indulgent at times, too, to be fair, but I also think he was often frank in his responses to questions.",1324166400,,1837,4.830670926517572

3226445,4,B000WTZ6M6,"Unless someone magically comes across one lying in a box somewhere, we are never going to get a Kurt Cobain autobiography. The closest thing we'll get is ""Kurt Cobain - About a Son,"" a documentary cobbled out of Michael Azerrad's interviews with the late rock'n'roll star -- and Cobain both explores his own past and strips away some of his legends.

The interviews took place in the early nineties over the course of a few months, about a year before Cobain's tragic death. Some are in person, and a few are over the phone. They're pleasantly informal and laid-back, since Cobain munches on a sandwich during one segment, and is occasionally interrupted by Courtney.

Over the course of several interviews, Cobain reflects on his life before rock stardom -- his childhood and his hometown, his formative years of mischief, his love of punk rock, his desire to be a rock star, and the early days of Nirvana. Cobain also contemplated drugs, health problems, his allure to flies, his quirky art, Courtney Love, fatherhood, turtles, misanthropy, death, oregano, journalists (I guess Azerrad was an exception), his bandmates, being onstage, the future of rock'n'roll, and his own reputation.

Since the interviews were taped with sound only, director AJ Schnack fills the screen with soundless, strangely ambient images from Seattle, Olympia and Aberdeen. Musicians, stores, logging machines, streets, forests, houses and faces pass by quietly -- as well as some weird cartoons. It feels a little like a nostalgic look through Cobain's own eyes.

Cobain himself was a remarkable person who has been overshadowed by his own posthumous legend (even when he was alive). In these interviews, he sounds like an intelligent man sitting down to have a frank conversation with a friend -- he sounds relaxed, laid-back and mostly at peace with his life as it then was, particularly when talking about his child (he recounts how when he saw her in a sonagram, she was making the ""hook 'em horns""). He has a lot of funny anecdotes, and a childlike fascination with the world that is truly endearing.

But as the interviews go on, we start seeing the multifaceted, contradictory creature that Cobain was -- darkness/light, loathing/fascination with people, childlike/painfully mature, earnest/jaded, passionate/lazy, craving fame yet somewhat disgusted by it.

It's obvious he had learned a lot from his past, since he spends a lot of time analyzing his own youthful mind and how people saw him (""I usually am enjoying myself; I'm hardly ever depressed anymore""). Near the end, he even comments that his own personal problems are not unusual or the worst, showing that he had grown up a lot -- when asked if his was a sad story, Cobain laughs and says, ""No... not really, I mean... it's nothing that's amazing or new, that's for sure.""

And Cobain made some eerily prophetic statements as well -- he complains about rock'n'roll (""It's sad to think what the state of rock'n'roll will be in about twenty years from now..."") and discusses death (""If I was gonna blow my head off with a gun, I may as well take the risk of dying from drugs"").

""Kurt Cobain: About a Son"" is a bittersweet experience -- it offers some truly beautiful insights into the mind of a true artist, but leaves you wishing he hadn't departed quite so soon.",1301529600,7,3310,4.929982046678636

I wasn't even sure it was about him, I thought maybe I had misunderstood the title and it was just an allusion to him.

The film just starts. No mention of his name or who is talking or what the visuals are. I wasn't even sure it was his voice I was hearing. In fact, I was sure it wasn't him. A friend, maybe. Or the director. But not him. The person speaking sounded so strangely normal. Slowly, tho, the realization that it might actually be Cobain talking, and then that it *must* be him talking and could be no one else, evolves. And, then, just wow - I was sucked right in. It's like listening to a private conversation and I was astonished by his authetic, unhurried, un-caring-to-entertain-anyone-whatsoever self.

After I'd realized it was his voice, I watched it dawned on me, again, slowly, that the film was scouting real locations specifically-personal to Cobain's life, and was illustrating what he's talking about. I assumed this for quite awhile because I also thought that might be wishful thinking on my part. But no. Listening to him talk you eventually realize are staring at his old room, old houses, old haunts. Did he really sleep in this trashed room? Or go to see bands in this bar? Or sit in this library when he was homeless? Really?

And, then, that's when the profundity of the film sunk in for me. In 50 years from now when all these places no longer exist, when the place his dad worked at is a Condo complex and the libray is torn down remodelled and that house is demolished this little unassuming, yet incredibly-powerful film will be a historical-marker to which nothing else will really compare.

How this sensitive but unglamorus movie ended-up riveting and shellshocking me with perfect unassuming subtly by Cobain's accepting-of-himself demenor, his story which asks for no mercy whatsoever, and voice that suggests he was much more than rocker, punk, rebel, any of that music-industry posturing becomes completely fabulous because you realize: it doesn't even matter if you see him. You end-up seeing so much more by not seeing him for the vast majority of the film. It's not about his photogenic-face. It really was his voice. And this movie showcases that and the man.

The people responsible for this film did everything right. It's so simple and brilliantly-genius to let his words, fully, do the talking; no mtv-style editing, flash, or dazzle. And, slowly but surely, you are curiously-brought along into the story without a single ounce of force or even invitation from the director or Kurt himself. And, then you realize why you like his music as Cobain tells it all just like the poet he is - without trying, just 'being'. Cliched, it may sound, but astoundingly, and with a much-retained innocence, Cobain cites the uncomplaining tale that shaped him.

If this was Kurt Cobain when the mask of the music-machine and it's industry was pulled aside, all I can say is: I aspire to his thoughtful, responsible, but unapologetic self-acceptance. Watch this film when you're in the mood to unwrap an engima and view one human's soul. He's the modern, male version of our beloved Alice in Wonderland, forever falling down the rabbit hole but never really losing his way at all. A film of pure autobiography, without steering or tainting. It's vulnerable without ever being crass. No one is trying to shock. But the shock ends up being Cobain's perfect, quiet self-possession. To-date, it's the most authentic, stand-alone surviving way to experience Kurt genius, artistry, and uncomplicated humanity. I listen to him explain his prolific life and I hear reflected back the similarly-spoke artistic plights of Mozart.

It's a poignent, slow-savored treasure for any fan of Cobain or Nirvana but it's equally great for lovers of the creative process, and people who, somehow, manage blindly to retain the unstoppable faith to follow their passions, come what may. And Kurt Cobain was all those things - and a little bit more, besides.",1280016000,14,4399,4.810846560846561

3226451,4,B000WTZ6M6,"Unless someone magically comes across one lying in a box somewhere, we are never going to get a Kurt Cobain autobiography. The closest thing we'll get is ""Kurt Cobain - About a Son,"" a documentary cobbled out of Michael Azerrad's interviews with the late rock'n'roll star -- and Cobain both explores his own past and strips away some of his legends.

The interviews took place in the early nineties over the course of a few months, about a year before Cobain's tragic death. Some are in person, and a few are over the phone. They're pleasantly informal and laid-back, since Cobain munches on a sandwich during one segment, and is occasionally interrupted by Courtney.

Over the course of several interviews, Cobain reflects on his life before rock stardom -- his childhood and his hometown, his formative years of mischief, his love of punk rock, his desire to be a rock star, and the early days of Nirvana. Cobain also contemplated drugs, health problems, his allure to flies, his quirky art, Courtney Love, fatherhood, turtles, misanthropy, death, oregano, journalists (I guess Azerrad was an exception), his bandmates, being onstage, the future of rock'n'roll, and his own reputation.

Since the interviews were taped with sound only, director AJ Schnack fills the screen with soundless, strangely ambient images from Seattle, Olympia and Aberdeen. Musicians, stores, logging machines, streets, forests, houses and faces pass by quietly -- as well as some weird cartoons. It feels a little like a nostalgic look through Cobain's own eyes.

Cobain himself was a remarkable person who has been overshadowed by his own posthumous legend (even when he was alive). In these interviews, he sounds like an intelligent man sitting down to have a frank conversation with a friend -- he sounds relaxed, laid-back and mostly at peace with his life as it then was, particularly when talking about his child (he recounts how when he saw her in a sonagram, she was making the ""hook 'em horns""). He has a lot of funny anecdotes, and a childlike fascination with the world that is truly endearing.

But as the interviews go on, we start seeing the multifaceted, contradictory creature that Cobain was -- darkness/light, loathing/fascination with people, childlike/painfully mature, earnest/jaded, passionate/lazy, craving fame yet somewhat disgusted by it.

It's obvious he had learned a lot from his past, since he spends a lot of time analyzing his own youthful mind and how people saw him (""I usually am enjoying myself; I'm hardly ever depressed anymore""). Near the end, he even comments that his own personal problems are not unusual or the worst, showing that he had grown up a lot -- when asked if his was a sad story, Cobain laughs and says, ""No... not really, I mean... it's nothing that's amazing or new, that's for sure.""

And Cobain made some eerily prophetic statements as well -- he complains about rock'n'roll (""It's sad to think what the state of rock'n'roll will be in about twenty years from now..."") and discusses death (""If I was gonna blow my head off with a gun, I may as well take the risk of dying from drugs"").

""Kurt Cobain: About a Son"" is a bittersweet experience -- it offers some truly beautiful insights into the mind of a true artist, but leaves you wishing he hadn't departed quite so soon.",1276732800,18,3310,4.929982046678636

3226454,5,B000WTZ6M6,"My formative years were The Grunge Years.  I was the perfect age for this, coming into my teens with Nirvana and having Kurt Cobain be my patron saint.  However, looking back on that time, perhaps the timing was just perfect for me as well as the rest of the world.  I admired Kurt, but became disillusioned as time went on.  He would die, and I and the rest of the Gen X kids grew up without him.  It was a very special experience, as well as a haunting one to hear his voice from beyond the grave.  What was even more haunting about this was the fact that we hardly see any images of Kurt in the movie, mostly stills of his hometown of Aberdeen and Seattle, and nameless people on the streets.  Kurt was the voice of disillusioned youth that we see on the streets in this film, and in many ways still is.

Kurt tells us about his childhood, his teen years, his stomach, his becoming a musician, and his epic rise to fame.  Who better to tell you than the man himself?  Courtney Love, today the infamous tabloid queen she is, is barely in it (thank God), but will always be linked to Kurt and Nirvana's story, nor is Dave or Krist except for a brief mention or photograph here and there.  The voice takes you into his world, making you feel like you are really there with him in his mind.  His alienation and feelings of inadequacy really speak to the viewer, making you feel and understand so many things about him.  There were so many conflicts and feelings to explore, too many to list here in a review.

And now, he's gone.  He left us because ... Well, just because.  He left behind his music, he was an artist, he touched people's lives, including mine.  Kurt wanted to give us his statement, and his project ended up being the last great rock band to close out the twentieth century.  The memories are wonderful, his music is timeless, and he lived by his own terms, and he was human instead of a god.",1259798400,3,1909,4.299719887955182

3226488,1,B000WTZ6M6,"Let me first state that I am a huge fan of Kurt Cobain and have been since the late `80s when Bleach was first released. I was a huge fan of the music coming out of the Pacific Northwest at that time: Mudhoney, Mother Love Bone, the Melvins, Soundgarden, etc. I still love the music even as I'm approaching my 40s.

This documentary should have been released as an audio CD. If it had to be released as a film, at least it should have been subtitled against a black screen. That would have been more palatable than the highbrow visual pap, which the visuals are comprised of. The interviews were highly insightful, but the images were terribly disconnected and removed from the zeitgeist that was the alternative scene of the late `80s and early `90s. Grunge was against social conventions, somewhat nilhlistic, and rebelled against the prevailing conditions and fashions of the time. It brought about the demise of hair metal, fortunately. As such, the visual imagery of this film was anathema to that spirit. I felt like I was watching an overwrought, pretentious piece of ""artsy fartsy"" filming akin to a perfume commercial. I should have just closed my eyes and listened. It left a very bad taste in me, only redeemed by Kurt's spoken words, which were captivating . Kurt stated in the film numerous times how he identified with Punk Rock. A true punk rocker would be appalled at the blatant commercialism of the imagery. I was repulsed by it. The only saving grace is the interviews themselves, which I highly recommend listening to.

There are no Nirvana recordings in the film (though you'll hear some classic rock and punk tracks by the likes of Queen, Bowie, The Vaselines, and other acts who inspired Kurt Cobain).  The interviews with Cobain are filled with thoughtful, poignant comments, social commentary, and very candid autobiographical material recorded in the last 2 years before Cobain's death.  The scenery in Washington State ranges from the majestic Cascades and evergreens to the mundane of local clubs, libraries, and unkempt apartments.  The score for this film is actually quite beautiful, it has nice ambient guitar work and is rather haunting, accentuated by the physical absence of Cobain, who appears in the film only in a photo montage near the end.

3226516,4,B000WTZ6M6,"If you were hoping for a second chance to crawl inside the mind of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, this is it, but the experience may not be quite what you expected it to be. As a documentary, ""About a Son"" is about as rewarding as it is frustrating. On one hand, it offers unparalleled access to Cobain's thoughts, since it is compiled exclusively from interview tapes. On the other hand, the video footage plays like a Travel Channel documentary for the State of Washington. You get to hear the contradictory nature of Cobain as he discusses points of inspiration and frustration, but there is virtually none of Nirvana's music to support his commentary. For the first hour, you don't even get to see Cobain's face, not even in photos. Instead, the film juxtaposes scenic shots of Washington with seemingly random faces from the area, as an attempt at capturing Cobain's environment.
""About a Son"" compiles the psychological profile of a happy kid sliding into neurosis, depression and anti-social behavior. Cobain is forthcoming, but his own self-doubt and suspicious nature forces the viewer to question the degree of his honesty. His take on his own victimization is self-evident, but his view on his own self-perceived shortcomings and his drug use are dependent on his ability to be honest with himself. He claims that chronic digestive pain inspired thoughts of suicide, but later says ""I hadn't had any stomach pain when I started doing drugs."" Is that the truth, or is it a rationalization? The film doesn't answer the question so much as it presents the contradiction for the viewer's own interpretation. Ultimately, ""About a Son"" is a psychological study consisting of self-analytical interviews juxtaposed over third-party footage. Does it succeed? That depends entirely on your ability to suspend your own frustration.  B Tom Ryan",1207180800,,1842,5.079207920792079
3226517,2,B000WTZ6M6,"I had actually been really excited about seeing this film.  I was 18 in 1992 and just idolized Nirvana.  Sixteen years later I still have a soft spot in my heart for Kurt Cobain.

This film was ridiculously terrible!  In my opinion, it had no business being a film.  The substance of the movie comes from taped conversations between Michael Azerrad and Kurt Cobain that Azerrad used for his book Come As You Are:  The Story of Nirvana.  With the prodding of Azerrad's interview questions, Cobain reveals facets of his personality, interesting anecdotes about his life, and insight into the person he was.

However, AJ Schnack adds NOTHING to the story by turning this material into a film.  Sure, there are a few generic shots of the neighborhood where Cobain grew up, where his father worked, and other places Cobain frequented, but this could easily be shown as photographs.  In my opinion, Azerrad himself should have released the tapes and included a booklet of photographs of Cobain's haunts, of Cobain himself, as this is all this film really is.

But the rest of the fluff Schnack added, in my opinion, was plain stupid and annoying!  For example, when Cobain would be telling a story that happened in a library, you would be listening to his voice, but then looking at the inside of a library.  I know what a library looks like, I don't feel like I need such obvious visual cues!  The same thing would occur when Cobain would be telling a story that happened in school, a lumberyard... wherever.  I didn't feel like looking at the halls of a high school or a bunch of logs being moved really added anything to the story.

What I found the most irritating, though, was the way Schnack would take have these random people look, with forced sad and empty expressions on their faces, at the camera and just stand there.  I felt this was Schnack's sorry attempt to be artistic.  I felt like he was trying really hard to make an artistic statement with these people (who I guess were supposed to represent ""everyday Americans"", ""alienated youth"", and the like), but it really just didn't seem to have anything to do with Kurt Cobain and the story he was revealing.  Perhaps if these shots had been of kids in the 90s, dressed the way we did those days, like the kids in the video for ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", it would have seemed relevant.  But they were just people living and looking like they do in the first decade of the 21st century, and I have no idea what this was supposed to do with Kurt Cobain.

Of course, there is no music by Nirvana in the entire film; I believe I heard he couldn't get the rights to the music from the people who now own it.  Sure, it was interesting to hear the music that influenced Cobain, but what a movie about him with none of his actual work just seems empty.

My last complaint about the film has to do with the printed words at the end of the film that claim Cobain committed suicide a year later.  From my understanding, Cobain only allegedly committed suicide.  There is a lot of evidence that suggests a certain person had Cobain murdered.  A film about Kurt Cobain, I would think, should at least set forward truthful, verifiable information about him.

This film is worth renting (don't make the mistake of buying it, like I did) just to hear Cobain's stories in his own voice.  But don't expect to gain much from the visual content from the film.  In fact, I feel it may have been more enjoyable to simply have listened to it with the screen turned off.",1207008000,14,3504,4.526232114467408

3226521,3,B000WTZ6M6,"I purchased this DVD through Amazon and have only watched it once, so this review is based on one viewing on the small screen, 12 hours after the fact.  I had a variety of reactions to the film.  Early on, it seemed to drag a bit and I felt like it could have been an audio piece instead of video.  I didn't feel like the visuals really added much in the first hour or so of the film.

But the format grew on me as the film went on and I was accustomed to it by the end.  The effect of seemingly random photographs and video snippets shown to the sound of (usually) one side of a conversation with Kurt Cobain was a kind of disconnect that was probably intentional, but tended to be off-putting at first. If you watch the film on DVD, be sure to watch the extra features, in which Azerrad and Schnack explain the work and some of the choices they made.  These featurettes put the film in a better perspective, and made me appreciate what I had seen a bit more.

This film is probably best described as a companion to Azerrad's book, and readers of ""Come As You Are"" will recognize portions of Cobain's words in the film from the book.  That being said, ""About A Son"" does not seem to be something a casual fan would really enjoy - I would only recommend it to Nirvana/Cobain die-hards and completists.

The movie seemed to be missing something, and that something was the music of Nirvana. I thought it was a nice touch to include music that Cobain appreciated, but I really feel like it would have been a better and more complete ""documentary"" with music and performances by (or at the very least, more photos of,) Cobain and Nirvana.  I don't know if Schnack et al were unable to obtain the rights to these types of materials for financial or other reasons, but the film really suffered in my opinion for the lack of the very music that was being discussed. It felt incomplete, which again may have been intentional. But if it was intentional, I feel it was the wrong choice - this film needed more Nirvana. I can understand not wanting to have tired, old photographs, performances, and music dominate the film - leave that to ""Behind the Music"" and its copycats - but leaving that type of material out entirely made the film suffer, in my opinion.

All that being said, ""About a Son"" is a powerful film for fans of Nirvana. It is a warts-and-all look at Kurt Cobain the person (as opposed to Cobain the musician or Cobain the unwilling generation spokesman.) Parts are funny, parts are informative, and parts are just plain sad. It angered me to hear Cobain's rationalizing of his drug problem and it spooked me to hear him discuss his own death (even mentioning blowing his own head off at one point,) in interviews recorded a relatively short time before it happened. For the faults I felt it had, the film was touching and well-made.  I am very glad I watched this movie, but I am not sure I need to own it and doubt I will watch it again.",1205193600,2,2945,4.38348623853211
3226522,5,B000WTZ6M6,"This movie was a moving experience; I took my son to see ""About a Son"" at an artsy theater in Chicago on his 15th birthday. Knowing we both enjoy Nirvana, I nonetheless braced myself for a grungy ""sentimental journey."" But then to our rapt enjoyment, this movie turned out NOT to be the typical ""between the eyes"" rockumentary crammed with repetitively familiar nostalgic imagery and dubbed in with music from the artist. In short this was not a nauseating musical rock video shrine. FYI - you don't see Kurt's or any band member's face. And you don't hear any music from Nirvana - and, you don't need to.

Instead, ""About a Son"" takes you through the Pacific Northwest, tastefully focusing on images that trace the words in Kurt's interview. I was very taken by the seamless ""being there"" feel of this film, as though the narration was in real-time with what was being shown visually.

All-in-all ""About a Son"" was highly-creative in combining fact with visual interpretation - and in doing so among the best ""rockumentaries"" I've watched. It is an interpretation of images, selected to match what Kurt was saying. You had a feel for him as a child and teen, his core family and the disintegration of it, for the deprivation he lived through, for the music he listened to, a discussion about babies and bottles, and some saddening foreshadowing of his suicide a year after the interview.

Would this movie stand on its own without knowledge and/or a fondness for Kurt Cobain and his music? Actually, I believe it would be interesting in and of itself - even if you had never known of Kurt - or never heard Nirvana's music. It is a warm yet subtle film about an interesting and likeable guy, whose immense creativity and drive sprang from humble and confining surroundings. Kurt would have liked ""About a Son"" for not being banal and obvious. The power is in its simplicity.

I just bought the DVD and I'm anxiously looking forward to another viewing on a smaller screen. Oh - also an interesting soundtrack works wonders without incorporating Nirvana's songs. My son and I waited to listen to Nirvana on the way home.",1204761600,4,2118,4.7317073170731705
3226523,5,B000WTZ6M6,This film is truly a something worthy of the genius Cobain was.  If you're a true Nirvana fan then it really is a must see.  Cobain's candid commentary about his life growing up and the formation of the band go hand in hand with the beautiful cinematography and music bed throughout the film.  I was really moved not only as a Nirvana fan but as fan of documentary and film all together.,1204675200,,387,4.347222222222222
3226524,2,B000WTZ6M6,"This DVD was so bad.  I got it thinking it was Kurt talking about his life and Nirvana, and it kind of was that.  This DVD was so bad because they never showed any live Cobain or Nirvana music, and they never even showed Kurt's face when we was talking.  It was just a bunch of dumb clips from where Kurt has been in the past.  This is seriously a boring DVD, and no one should buy it.

I do think it's cool how much Kurt talks about his life, but theres only his voice. Curt, Dave, and Christ aren't in this movie for a second.",1204243200,3,528,3.943396226415094
8225579,5,B000WTZ6M6,"Just watched this and really enjoyed it. It's basically just audio of Kurt answering questions and discussing his life, the band, and his relationships while modern footage of different places he lived/grew up in plays visually. But it makes for a cool vibe and enjoyable documentary. You really hear his dichotomy of views and how he was so many things at any given moment. Often times he totally contradicts himself in the very same sentence. But that's who he was and what made him create his music the way he did. Really recommend this. Good stuff.",1526083200,,552,4.760416666666667

8225585,5,B000WTZ6M6,"If your a Cobain Fan this is a great Listening doc. While many people say it was a snooze fest i found it almost comforting in the weirdest way possible, his voice is insanely soothing. More recently i have looked into his life as we had things in common. Listening to his feelings on Divorce, Family, Fame and the way he felt about people had me on a common ground. While i believe this points to an arrow that he did NOT take his own life, speaking of the future in a highly optimistic manner, this film was not about proving or disproving but showing him as a human being and not a rock star idol.
Kurt Cobain showed his nearly true colors. I found these interviews deeply honest. Cobain seemed clear minded and unquestionable in his actions and future.
Hard to believe a man so direct in life took his own life.",1441929600,,815,4.333333333333333
8225586,4,B000WTZ6M6,Interesting to hear him in his own words (especially about the early days). I've stayed at the Polynesian at Ocean Shores several times - wonder if he ever did the fireplaces in any of our rooms ?-),1434931200,,198,4.378378378378378
