8218007,4,B000VC6IEE,THERE ARE SOME VERY GOOD FUNDAMENTAL SUGGESTIONS ON THIS DVD AND I LIKE HIS LAID BACK STYLE. THIS IS A GOOD ONE TO PULL OUT FROM TIME TO TIME AND REMIND YOURSELF OF WHAT YOU NEED TO DO ON THE COURSE.,1390262400,,199,3.8780487804878048
8218008,5,B000VC6IEE,"In my honest opinion if your looking to seriously improve your swing Tom Lehman's simple and easy to understand instruction will do it.
The terms he uses to explain the ""proper"" swing will help you learn and/or diagnose the problem in your swing. This Man is not trying to sell you on ""fixing your slice"" or ""driving farther"". He focuses on building the groundwork for a consistent and proper swing. Loved the DVD and will return to it when I start doing crazy stuff on the greens again.",1362355200,,487,4.545454545454546
