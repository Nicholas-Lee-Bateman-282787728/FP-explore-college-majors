It was particularly interesting to hear the opinions of the farmers themselves.
This issue is much more complicated than our politicians and mainstream media would have us believe.
Overall the film was very interesting to watch, but it did drag a little at a few points.
I show this in a university level course that I teach and all of the students have said they found it very useful and interesting.",1334534400,,491,4.857142857142857

8309278,4,B001HOWHTK,"I have seen many documentaries about farmworkers and agriculture over the years, and I find American Harvest to be a refreshingly non-biased presentation of the issues confronting many farmworkers and their families, as well the issues confronting growers and the ag industry and the future of agriculture in this and surrounding countries. Well done! I look foward to using the movie as a learning tool with all segments of our community.",1238371200,2,439,5.197183098591549
