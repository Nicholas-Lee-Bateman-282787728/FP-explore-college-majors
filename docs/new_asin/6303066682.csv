full lieutennant (O3) when  in actuality he was a LTjg (junior grade) (O2) upon leaving the Naval Service.",1359849600,,229,4.725
566010,5,6303066682,"It's a great series, very well done. Don't let the negative reviews bother you, because some of those reviews are based upon missing episodes. The DVD I got was fine, and it would be a shame to miss out on this masterpiece just because of a few negative comments. The acting, story line, presentation, directing, subject matter, everything, is all excellent and very informative. If you want to know more about JFK, this DVD is amazingly good, better than thought possible, really excellent.",1334966400,2,491,4.927710843373494
566011,3,6303066682,"I watched the first half and it was just looking like something worth watching was happening and it ended. I open the box to insert disk 2 and there wasn't one. I got online to return the DVD and also emailed the distributor. Unfortunately, it was Friday evening.

This is the response I received Monday morning:

Dear Ruth

Thank you for your purchase of JFK Reckless Youth.

The film that you purchased aired on television as a 2 part miniseries, and the disc was replicated in that same 2 part format..

The miniseries will play and as it nears the end of the first   it will appear as though the film is over, run credits, blank 2-5 second screen shot ect.  However, if you let the DVD continue to play , the opening credit will again appear (as they did at the first  of the film) and then the DVD will pick up with the second half of the film.

You could also access the second  using  the scene selection option from your main menu. This should allow you to determine where the second half of the miniseries starts. Select that scene and the story will continue.

If you continue to have problems with the DVD please feel free to reply to this email with question or concerns or call 608.784.6620.

One of our customer service representatives will be happy to help you.

Sincerely,

EBHE Customer Service

IT WORKED!!! I watched the second half and thought, I wasted all this time and energy for this?  For ME a three star rating is too high because of MY EXPECTATIONS. I wanted to see a story about a RECKLESS YOUTH. This was more like any other documentary. Which I had just watched 3 other documentaries prior. If I was expecting a documentary I would have rated it 5 stars. As a fictional movie with drama, excitement and RECKLESSNESS - one star.",1324944000,3,1757,4.454545454545454
566012,1,6303066682,"Thought I would enjoy this since I love JFK AND Patrick Dempsy. I was wrong. It was boring. Yeah...it followed pretty closely with the truth...but it just seemed pointless,boring, and plot challenged.",1311897600,,200,5.28125
566013,4,6303066682,"I'm not a JFK or history buff, so I can't comment on how accurate this is, or was meant to be.

Some people were upset that this was not the entire miniseries, but as I've never watched the entire miniseries, I can't comment on that, either.

I enjoyed watching what was present, though.",1307318400,,287,4.39622641509434
566014,5,6303066682,"I watched this miniseries about fifteen years ago and I never forgot the brilliant performance of Patrick Dempsey as the young Jack Kennedy. Since then the two are inseparable in my perception of JFK and I have been quite amazed for a long, long time that Dempsey didn't reach star-status or at least became a sex-symbol. Of course this is history now since the succes of Grey's Anatomy and he acquired both, strangely enough at roughly the same age that JFK became president...

I believe that this production paints also one of the most accurate pictures of the [Joe and Rose] Kennedy household that I have ever seen: a strange blend of conservatism and modernism, freedom and discipline. Probably some of the ingredients that made the future president, his wife and brother such enigmatic and fascinating personalities.

Thumbs up for the wardrobe-department too: the clothing of the individual characters is impeccable and completely in line with the period.",1209254400,,962,5.082278481012659
566015,5,6303066682,"Though the casting for JFK was not physically similar, the actor doing the part made up for it with his work on the screen. Picture maintains your interest throughout. Great for history buffs.",1195776000,2,192,4.848484848484849

566017,5,6303066682,"I bought the DVD when it first came out and just got around to watching it (it IS 3 hours, and I'd seen it when it originally aired), and discovered I had a defective DVD.  Thanks to reading the below comments, I knew it was a manufacturer's error and contacted the manufacturer's customer service, asking if the problem had been corrected and, if so, would they exchange it.  Within the hour, they sent me an email requesting an address to replace the disc.  I've just watched the new and improved DVD, so buy with confidence!  (And the movie is really well done.)",1174521600,10,565,4.509803921568627

7838267,5,6303066682,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The actors, the music, the sets...everything is top notch. Of all the actors I have seen portray JFK, Patrick Dempsey is by far the best.  This movie captures the period of JFK's life from his childhood through early adulthood. I feel moved by the story every time I watch it. This is a great production, and will be a classic.",1504137600,,376,4.295774647887324

7838269,5,6303066682,"This two part mini-series was fantastic! Patrick Dempsey did great as a young JFK, and his accent wasn't half-bad. It was interesting, and held my attention through both parts of this film. I had never gotten the chance to see a production of JFK's earlier life, and I thought this did a wonderful job. However, I was slightly disappointed with the portrayal of the death of Joe Kennedy Jr. I felt as though they just brushed over his death very lightly as though it didn't affect the family too terribly. All in all, five stars. I would recommend it to anyone curious or fascinated with the Kennedy family!",1455062400,,607,4.62962962962963

7838271,1,6303066682,Totally a waste of time. It gives no insight to JFK's earlier years. My wife and I turned it off half-way through the movie. Do not waste your time and money.,1425168000,,158,4.129032258064516

7838274,5,6303066682,This was a piece of this mans youth many didn't know and it helps round out the person he became and perhaps why it helps that Patrick Dempsey did a remarkable job playing young Kennedy worth the watch,1361836800,4,201,4.315789473684211
