5005508,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"Here is a brief synopsis from the Acorn Media UK site.

Product Description
Michael Kitchen stars as the thoughtful and enigmatic Detective Chief Superintendent Foyle.

The war is over in Britain and Foyle, among many others, must find his way in this new world. His hopes of retirement are dashed due to a shortage of senior men and he finds himself investigating international conspiracy, betrayal and military racism.

This boxed set contains:
The Russian House
Killing Time
The Hide

Episode 1: The Russian House, by Anthony Horowitz
DCS Foyle stumbles upon an international cover up, which, if exposed could bring down the British government, and reveal the War Office's darkest secret yet.

Episode 2: Killing Time, by David Kane
Foyle goes head to head against the might of the US army, as racial prejudices erupt when a local girl is found murdered, and the finger of suspicion points to a black GI at the US military base.

Episode 3: The Hide
The newly retired Foyle battles to save a young man accused of high treason from the executioner's noose, in a case that will shatter his personal world to the core...",1267574400,79,1120,4.837696335078534
5005509,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"For those wondering what this is: It's the continuation of the series, post war. Foyle is back on the job dealing with the lawlessness that plagued England as the country tried to rebuild. Still created by Anthony Horowitz and still starring Michael Kitchen and Honeysuckle Weeks, this was filmed in 2009 and will air on ITV in England during April of 2010. If it is recieved as well as sets 1-5, then the series will continue to be produced. In an unprecidented move, ITV is attempting to make up for the terrible decision to cut the original series short, and end it abruptly. They are hoping it hasn't lost it's audience. The DVD will be released in August 2010.

Here is a synopsis of Series 7, (set 6).

It is June 1945 and while VE Day has been celebrated in Britain, the war continues elsewhere in the world. The immediate aftermath of war was not a time of jubilation and optimism, as had been expected. The country was exhausted and poverty-stricken, families torn apart and rations tighter than ever before. Like everyone else, Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle needs to feel his way in this new world as he faces some of his toughest challenges and gripping plots to date. Keen to retire, but bound to his old job by the steep rise in violent crime that swept the country, Foyle is thrust into the dangerous worlds of international conspiracy and execution, military racism and national betrayal.

The Russian House:
CS Foyle stumbles upon an international cover up, which, if exposed could bring down the British government, and reveal the War Office's darkest secret yet.

Killing Time:
Foyle goes head to head against the might of the US army, as racial prejudices erupt when a local girl is found murdered, and the finger of suspicion points to a black GI at the US military base.

The Hide:
The newly retired Foyle battles to save a young man accused of high treason from the executioner's noose, in a case that will shatter his personal world to the core...

5005512,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"After I watched an episode on PBS, I was intrigued & had to see the rest of the series. Each episode is so realistic that you can imagine yourself wearing the period clothes, using the ration books & listening to the music during the first half of the 40's. The main characters are wonderfully portrayed especially Foyle by Michael Kitchen. He played the police Commander to perfection, always in charge, tough if he had to be & once in a while a hint of a smile especially with his driver Sam. In this country I'm sure he would have won an Emmy! I am so looking forward to #6.",1264377600,17,577,4.302752293577981
5005513,4,B006MK6Y8Y,My husband and I enjoyed the Foyle's War series.  The character are portrayed well and it is a serious subject with some humor.  We were disappointed that it was ran for 5 seasons.  Feel they could have expanded on each of the main characters.  They are all fine actors.,1256774400,11,270,4.448979591836735
5005514,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"A little different feel from the other episodes, but a must-have for Foyle fans. The Devereaux episode is fantastic.

Wish they could have made an entire follow-up episode on the Howard Paige (Season 2) story; we all wanted Foyle to get that Trump-eter-type!

The series will always be a reminder that there is never a ""good"" war, just one that may have a happier ending than it might have had. So sad to have the series end; there are few videos worth watching and this is one of them.",1506988800,,486,4.449438202247191

5005518,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"It is difficult to top this wonderful series. The later episodes that take place after WWII are not as appealing as the war years episodes, but the historical accuracy and the superb acting, scenery, and direction still remain present.",1498089600,,235,5.051282051282051

5005522,4,B006MK6Y8Y,Not quite as good as the earlier episodes but still very worthwhile.,1488758400,,68,4.75
5005523,4,B006MK6Y8Y,"Once you start on the Foyle seasons, you'll want to see the whole thing through!  In this sixth season (of eight), the plotting is, on the whole up to par, and the focus on local crime that relates to the national events at the end of World War 2 is maintained.  For fans of the series, I'll just report that Milner has been posted, with a promotion, from Hastings to nearby Brighton, but the story still manages to include him.  Foyle (Michael Kitchen, excellent as always) is still struggling to retire but like Michael Corleone, ""they keep pulling him back in.""  Sam, his ex-driver (Honeysuckle Weeks), is seeking employment in Hastings, and that keeps her in the mix.  Americans have to be got back home and Russian POWs repatriated (a particularly fascinating story).  Only in the first episode of this series did I feel that things came a little too close to melodrama (there's an escape from a hitman!), but in that one, the final scene with Foyle and Milner is worth the price of the set.  The third episode moves in surprising and affecting directions.  Highly recommended, as usual.  Foyle is one of the great TV detective creations, and Kitchen's performances are superb.",1484784000,,1182,4.754901960784314
5005524,5,B006MK6Y8Y,The Foyle's War series is among our favorites and we've enjoyed watching the episodes over again several times over the years.  Very well written and acting is superb.  This set covers during WW II and we liked much better than the post war 2 seasons.  But we enjoyed them all.  Michael Kitchen does a fantastic job as Foyle!,1484092800,,325,4.551724137931035

5005531,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"Season 6 of FOYLE'S WAR achieves cruising altitude via crisp scripts packed with quips and retorts, and characters developed against type: notably, a gentlemanly German prisoner of war, a homicidal Jewish doctor, and a sanctimonious American officer. My only quibble with the cast is that American actor Jay Benedict's portrayal of American officer Major Kieffer is a tad too ""John Wayne"" to be believed. Only John Wayne sounded like John Wayne, and ""Duke"" didn't serve in WWII. The theme that subtly pervades every season of FOYLE'S WAR regardless of the vicissitudes of the characters is Foyle's personal loneliness, and the incalculable price paid by the British people in blood and treasure to defeat Nazism. In the final scene of the final episode of Season 6, Foyle stands alone in an empty office while outside the people of Hastings celebrate the allies' Victory in Europe. Foyle's solitude in that vacant space is emblematic of Britain's predicament in 1945--how to begin anew?",1472342400,,986,5.16875
5005532,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"This is a series not to be missed.  It is a serious production : I  found it  educational.  It gives a look into the England of WW2 that was unknown to me before.  One gets a glimpse of life as it was - hardships and heartaches and courage.  The look into the War Machine was an eye opener.  I guess one cannot be 'nice' if you want to win a war.  But, the glimpses of what went on was chilling.  The detective was suberb:  cool, unruffled and immaculately  tailored, not to be flip- but, he was).  The last episode ""Elise"" was a tearful one.  It should make us very thankful for those who gave everything so we would be free of Hitler's tyranny.",1467158400,,646,4.154471544715447

5005565,3,B006MK6Y8Y,"We really enjoy this British series in our US home.  A major drawback is there have been no included captions built-in - up to season 5 - you are required to use the caption option that comes with your TV, and we're finding that most US tv's these days, are requiring you to use the captions provided by your DVD or cable service.  Major FAIL!  Seasons 6 & 7 say SDH on the back, will have to see if that really works or if choosing that option will tell us ""use your TV subtitle option"".

But the REAL reason this exceptional series is getting only a 3-star review is that for an average of $30 per season - you get ONLY three episodes.  If they can create 12 Downton Abbey in the same time for about the same price, what's up with that?  This review will be essentially copy/paste into Foyle Season 7, too.  Same exact thing.  Big price, 3 episodes. :(",1418947200,,854,4.228395061728395

5005599,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"When the 5th season (6th in the UK) ended I thought we had bid farewell to a very good, very successful series but its popularity in Britain brought it back for some post-War stories. Foyle gets to do what he wanted to do during the war but as a policeman, he approaches the field of intelligence differently and gets different results. The series is as good as when he headed the Hastings Police.",1401408000,,397,4.4520547945205475

5005601,5,B006MK6Y8Y,Entranced by the whole series and by Michael Kitchen's performances. Season 6 is interesting as the war comes to a close and we get a glimpse of how the English moved into the postwar era.  England remained economically depressed well into the 50's.,1399593600,,249,4.790697674418604
5005602,5,B006MK6Y8Y,I have been an avid Foyle's War fan for years. It is wonderful to have Michael Kitchen & Honeysuckle Weeks back on TV. Cold War Espionage rather than WWII stories. I recommend this CD collection to any like minded British mystery fan.,1398729600,,234,4.595238095238095

5005612,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"As an American few really understood the utter and abject deprivation and sacrifice the Brits made in WWII. This series uses WWII as a backdrop to a well done police series. But always in the background it portrays the daily life and death, sacrifice and valor of the citizens of GB. I'm so glad this story was told. I really stand in awe of these people, what they went through, and persevered. Foyle's character is brilliant. Terse, direct, and unflinching while at the same time very professional and quite likeable. Sort of like Morse with a bit more spunk.",1389830400,,561,4.6767676767676765
5005613,1,B006MK6Y8Y,"It's probably unfair of me to review season six, not having seen the earlier season episodes.  Even the best series (like ""George Gently"") tend to ""tank"" after four or five seasons.

Nonetheless, I was pretty unimpressed with the screenwriting (seemingly done by a recent film school grad) and direction.  It was difficult to keep all the characters straight, and their motivations were pretty implausible.  The ""who done it"" revelation at the end was cobbled together and silly.  Also, you might want to skip the obligatory PC episode.

I also agree with the reviewer who felt that some of the actors ""phoned in their lines"".

Please don't take this as a review of the entire series.  I still plan to watch (and review) season one",1388880000,,731,4.838709677419355

Of course it did not show the actual result of the blitz but it caused me enough curiosity to look up pictures on the internet of what the results of the blitz actually were.  Oh My God, it was horrible.  Entire blocks were completely demolished.  I cannot imagine the terror that the people were experiencing during that time.",1386979200,,378,4.514705882352941

5005621,3,B006MK6Y8Y,"Same lovable characters though the Sargent has become a bit shallow, testy and childish -- since he's become the new DCI; -- being the crippled war veteran with a chip on his shoulder; but nice, of course, so that the plot doesn't sound too bigoted.

Sam falls in love with an incompetent, but of course nice guy, who plays cute well; -- but can't run a business or fix anything; -- so he decides to become a protester to save Hastings (you know, William the Conqueror and all), and run as a socialist politician; of course, in order to save the planet; since he can't pay his bills, or run anything.  Sam's new love becomes the new man on the street, his role is inept, unkempt but loveable; -- a real man of the people politically -- the cute political child; who is about to step up and save the world; since he can't manage anything, can't save his finances, can't pay for anything, can't get a loan and is always borrowing from Sam; -- and of course in the end in his cuteness he's blown up the boarding house, which was his only source of income, -- Don't worry, it was OK because he couldn't manage it anyway; and besides he's in need of a new career since he has found a new calling in the ""save the planet"" political messaging; just in the nick of time, since he has just asked Sam to marry him; in the back drop of the blown up house, with people screaming at them to get out; so that he can carry her across the threshold to get her out.

""Oh the humor of it all...""  If only I were twelve.

Foyle is well acted as always and the character of Foyle is delightful.  In the typical modern BBC theme -- that represents its funding resources; -- it is anti-religion, anti-American, anti-elitist, and anti-intelligent; and has the modern academic theme; of the labor movement that shouts its Marxist rhetoric...

The plots are interesting portrayals of their socialist messages -- so you will not be disappointed as an academic; -- wherein the bad guys always confess, when finally confronted; and who are of course the portrayals of the elitist bigots, or the characters that have been portrayed with American or religious arrogance.

It's the BBC.  It supposed to be this way.  That's where they get their funding. Go Vote when you're done.

Foyle of course with his sly and savvy manner wins; although it's been obvious who the culprits were from beginning to end; they are always the anti-establishment with a slight nudge here and there to show that they're not bigots... but there are interesting twists that protect the propaganda; so that it doesn't reveal it's sources; unless you're already fed up with the endless themes that have been written into so many BBC episodes now that you want to just ""SCREAM"".

I mean, ""Enough Already!""

For me, I can barely get thru these anymore, but I loved the original Foyle's War and was sorry when it ended; so what better way to get their political message out, but to stuff it down our throats.

What can you do, when all you want is a little entertainment; go ahead and pay for it... that's the hypocrisy. Capitalist pig meets Socialist eventually; incompetency rules; even in the BBC.

Some people should never leave the Shakespearean stage if they want to see real characters with something meaningful to say.  But, even that is plagued with incompetence.  I'm beginning to think the world itself is simply incompetent.",1384214400,3,3378,4.594009983361065

You do not have to suspend disbelief; he just plays Christopher Foyle as though you are watching through your own personal window back into those dark times during the beginning of World War II.

Bizarrely, one key figure, Milner, has suddenly become an entirely different personality type, so noticeable it might as well be a different actor stepping into the role.  Too much time is spent re-introducing the characters, contriving ways so that they can work together again.

Set 6 is actually the episodes from season 7 (because set 4 includes seasons 4 & 5).  With many series, the longer they last the more political they become. Foyle's War is no different.  The social commentary in set 5 and in this set sometimes seems more important than the stories themselves.  However, the writing is still excellent and there are some interesting twists here.  In set five, the three main characters have parted and gone their separate ways.  Set 6 brings them unexpectedly back together.  In the first episode, Foyle butts heads with his old sergeant while they investigate a murder and a missing POW.

5005672,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"Best series out!  All the stories are good; a little on the dark side, but the war was DARK!!.
Would recommend.",1362355200,,111,4.285714285714286
5005673,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"I took a chance and ordered this set based on a friend's recommendation. Completely exceeded my expectations. Michael Kitchen is the master of conveying an incredible breadth of emotion/attitude with the nuances of his countenance and very few words. The female supporting character is uniquely interesting -- innocent, decent, adventurous, not especially pretty but attractive, and a little obnoxious. The story lines are well crafted and recall daily life along the coast of England in WWII. I've watched these twice so far, and they were just as engaging the second time through. This set of three discs may be even better than series 1-5, and that is a true compliment.",1362268800,,673,5.127272727272727
5005674,5,B006MK6Y8Y,this series is just beautiful and so well written i am certain we will enjoy it over and over thru the years.,1359849600,,109,4.0
5005675,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"I've actually watched a number of BBC TV series/mini-series.  My all-time favorite is Prime Suspect and secondly would be
Downton Abbey.  Foyle's War is good.  It's not quite on the same level as my favorites, but I have grown to enjoy it and appreciate the history to it - very interesting.

I've always had great admiration for Michael Kitchen's acting and it's always a pleasure to discover new actors - Honeysuckle Weeks and Anthony Howell.  I love the DCI Foyle character!",1359504000,,477,4.839506172839506
5005676,3,B006MK6Y8Y,"No feed back.  It was a gift - I received not feedback.

Dumb to require a set number of words in a review.",1359417600,,107,3.608695652173913
5005677,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"We've watched the series on PBS once and are watching it again, 'bout half way through now. A grand story set in Britian during WW2. My better half insisted on purchasing the entire series. The script, character development and acting do beg for another round in our home library.",1359331200,2,280,4.73469387755102
5005678,5,B006MK6Y8Y,Foyle's War is always wonderful to watch.  Everything was perfect with the holder and the DVD's.  Arrived in a resonable amount of time.,1358899200,,136,4.869565217391305
5005679,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"In the last of six sets, Foyle deals with escape of a POW (The Russian House); racial tension (Killing Time); and traitors (The Hide).  This series has continued its excellent treatment of wartime issues in England.",1358899200,,215,4.972222222222222
5005680,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"a bit of history, interesting, and murder mystery!  my favorite.
The series has offensive swearing with the introduction of the Yanks",1358726400,,133,5.333333333333333
5005681,5,B006MK6Y8Y,Thought provoking period drama. The backdrop of the war adds extra dimension to this well written series. Wish there were more.,1358553600,,127,5.095238095238095
5005682,5,B006MK6Y8Y,The new season continues to capture the mystic of the 40's.  Keep it up!  Can't wait for mystery of the next sensor.,1358467200,,116,4.2272727272727275
5005683,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"To me the whole serie of Foyle's war is just about perfect, and so are Foyle (Michael Kitchen)himself, Sam his driver, the atmosphere, the subjects treated, the photography, the filming,and I must give a special mention to the music which is a pure delight.",1358121600,,257,4.863636363636363
5005684,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"UPDATE:
This listing title is now corrected. Below is the review for the complete Foyle's War through set 6, but this listing is now only for set 6. Previously it had stated you get all of them. but there is such a set, at a reasonable price, sets 1-6, for those who own none of the collection to date.

FOYLE'S WAR presents Brit Home Front war-life through poignant topics, compelling suspense, and many mirthful moments. It is a 1940-45 Southern country experience not to be missed. English WWII involvement and resulting life-style of the population away from the active war front when all England expects an eminent invasion from Germany.
3 episodes of Foyle's Post-War (summer 1945) are done in the same 6-YES, SIX-STAR excellence. Foyle longs for retirement, but it's not to be [great news for fans]. Period drama precision detailing history, drama, action, romance, mystery, and suspense

FOYLE'S WAR is also a series the best 21st century written TV murder mystery ever presented by creator/writer Anthony Horowitz. A modern classic for sure. Foyle's War is fiction, but so authentic to detail that this series is a MUST for historians.

Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is a cop who'd rather be on the front, not investigating Hastings crime. Milner (Anthony Howell) does much of Foyle's ""leg-work"" on an artificial limb. A female driver, ""Sam"" (Honeysuckle Weeks) is gorgeous with a winning smile. Perfect attention is given to the period details; sets, costumes, vehicles, architecture, even down to NO yellow road lines. Including facial expressions, performances are nothing short of perfection.

Numerous guest stars in each episode known stars seen in top Masterpiece Theatre productions. Additional post-war episodes airing in Sept, 2013. They super reduced the price of previous episodes to prepare the way for those new adventures.

Review is for the listing title, sets 1-5 & 6. But the description of the item later does not seem to match. Excellent price if you get all 6 sets, better than excellent. Series is fantastic.",1358121600,,3061,5.122244488977956
5005685,4,B006MK6Y8Y,"These episodes are good, but I  am not sure I would buy them  again.  I think they should have just ended it with the other set where Foyle closes the door.  I did like that they had closure on the American thing, though.",1357862400,2,221,4.069767441860465
5005686,5,B006MK6Y8Y,Michael Kitchen portrays a detective in wartime England during WWII. This export from Great Britain is one of the best.,1357689600,,119,5.0
5005687,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"My father and I are fans of British Television. This is one of his favorite series and I bought them all for him for Christmas. He will watch them over and over, something he very rarely does. The quality of the writing and acting is superb.",1357689600,,241,4.260869565217392
5005688,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"Foyle's war was wonderful.  At the time, this was not available for download in my country.  Now it is, but I have passed around the dvd's many times for people who want to watch it and rewatch at their leisure. Everyone I've loaned it to loves it.  Great buy. Great show!",1357603200,,272,4.294117647058823
5005689,4,B006MK6Y8Y,Sets 1 through 5 are fantastic. This last set is not as great. More like an afterthought. Still happy to have watched them. A great series overall.,1357430400,,147,4.481481481481482
5005690,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"I'd seen some episodes on PBS and enjoyed them immensely.  But I haden't seen the complete series 1-5, so when the opportunity came along I jumped at it!  The cast and stories are excellent, well thought out and intriguing.  The series takes place during the 2nd World War and DCS Foyle is thrown into many investigations involving the ""Black Market"", spies and various other crimes.  All are based on facts and actual cases!  Then Series 6 came along and I ordered that too! If you like mysteries and great acting and locations you won't be disapointed!  Highly recommended!",1357084800,,575,4.816326530612245
5005691,5,B006MK6Y8Y,This series is serious and touches on many issues that touched the British people during war besides war.  It is not offensive and not obscene.  Foyle is one of my favorite characters and Kitchen always delivers.,1356912000,,212,4.861111111111111
5005692,5,B006MK6Y8Y,This is a great TV series. The early years were much better though. Buy 1-5 and you will love them.,1356739200,,99,4.0
5005693,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"Probably the best series of this. Actors and the writer (Horowitz) do an outstanding job. A bit pricey, but worth it.",1356739200,,117,4.619047619047619
5005694,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"Some of the best television I have ever seen. Foyles War is aptly named, Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle is at war with crime during WWII in the sleepy seaside village of Hastings England. I cannot say enough about Michael Kitchen's performance as DCS Foyle he is simply amazing. And Honeysuckle Weeks (what a great name) as Samantha his driver is just wonderful, her physical attributes just spill over in her character and she is such fun to watch. And Anthony Howell as Detective Sergeant Paul Milner wonderfully rounds out the group, he is fresh off the battlefield and is nursing a war injury to his leg and his psyche. I find it fascinating that the fight against crime is just as needed if not more so during war and in his own way, Foyle fights this battle just as fiercely as any soldier on the battlefield.",1356220800,,833,4.673469387755102
5005695,5,B006MK6Y8Y,Never was I as aware of the hardships suffered by the Brits during WWII as during the viewing of this series.  This is a superb undertaking to inform and entertain.  The writing is first-rate and the performances so distinguished that the desire to see the next installment becomes a can't-wait experience.  Kitchen and cast cannot be praised enough.  An interview like that of the writer is a must.  I have all sets except the last (seventh) and am buying it asap.,1355616000,,465,4.691358024691358
5005696,5,B006MK6Y8Y,This is another of my favorite series. I love Michael Kitchen in this role. Such a great character. Plus the other regular characters are so interesting. This series is a must if you love WW II stories.,1355270400,,202,4.486486486486487
5005697,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"Foyle's War is the best British police drama I've ever seen. Foyle is a detective in a small English town during WWII and maintains his dignity, honesty and integrity regardless of the situation. The characters are great, real and likeable. The stories are always interesting and sometimes with a twist. Foyle not only fights crime but many times his superiors too. Just a very well done series.",1354752000,,395,4.91044776119403
5005698,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"Added to my Foyle's War collection with this series, #6. These are excellent WWII accounts of England and how the War impacted civilians and soldiers alike in the UK. Great murder mysteries and all the other crimes committed in the 'Homeland' of Great Britain. But a Milestone has also been reached with the purchase and delivery of this great set of DVD's. My Amazon order took only 2 days, including the day ordered to the day delivered. It was the Free Super Saver deal. From Lexington, KY to Pittsburgh, PA. 2days TOTAL time. I would have to say that the reason for the unexpected feat was ""Prestige Delivery Systems"", who took the package from Lexington to Pittsburgh. I would not expect this performance to be normal, but I thought it was worth mentioning. This is absolutely the fastest I have ever had ANYTHING delivered in all my years of shopping online. Congratulations to Amazon and their shipping partner, Prestige Delivery Systems.",1350604800,,945,4.875776397515528
5005699,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"Season six continues to be as excellent as the first five seasons - a joy to watch. Michael Kitchen gives a stellar performance, as usual.",1350518400,,138,4.56
5005700,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"It's truly an entertaining and surprisingly addictive series. Production values are mediocre, but they don't detract from the stories or the characters. Michael Kitchen is the best actor you've never heard of.

5005701,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"I would like to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this excellent series!  I have seen all six seasons, some of them more than once, and am just astonished at the quality of the production--the story, the acting, the filming, the accuracy of historical fact, and yes, the accuracy of the psychological drama that is so much a part of it all, and so brilliantly understated by Michael Kitchen as Chief Inspector Foyle.  Very classy drama, and I hope very much it will continue, and that there will be more ""seasons"" or ""sets"" to be seen on DVD in America, since I do not have access to British TV as these episodes come out.  Bravo!  And more, please!!!  It doesn't seem like it's really ""over"" yet, and hopefully all concerned will know the moment when it is, so we can all go home with the satisfaction that it finished well!",1344902400,,832,4.411764705882353
5005702,5,B006MK6Y8Y,Foyle's War is a fantastic series.  The acting is great.  The sets are wonderful.  It needs to do more episodes.,1344556800,,112,4.5
5005703,5,B006MK6Y8Y,Who can possibly go wrong watching Foyle's War?  No one.  This British mystery series is  beautifully done and I wish they would go on and on.  I have collected all of the discs in this particular series and enjoy repeat viewing.,1343433600,,229,4.512195121951219
5005704,3,B006MK6Y8Y,While I love the Foyle's War series and hope to see it again next year the pricing for theses series is outrageous since there are usually only three episodes in each series - sometimes four episodes.  My stars are for the pricing.  The series itself rates five stars.,1342915200,2,268,4.5625
5005705,4,B006MK6Y8Y,"Good series but I didn't enjoy this season as much as I did the previous ""war time"" episodes.  It is still one of the best programs on TV.",1339718400,,138,3.9285714285714284
5005706,5,B006MK6Y8Y,For Foyle the job is never done. With World War II finally at an end Foyle's desire to retire or transfer seems it will finally come to fruition but crime continues and Foyle's experience and knowlegde keep his superiors in need of his expertise. This is an excellent continuation of the series.,1338768000,,295,4.6923076923076925
5005707,4,B006MK6Y8Y,The set was in the same style as the previous sets but the writing did not seem to be up to the same quality.,1338249600,,109,3.5833333333333335
5005708,5,B006MK6Y8Y,Im an American and big fan of British TV.I adored every episode of every season of Foleys War..Seldom veiwed a TV program( of any kind) where I liked every character. Learned a great deal of history of how England suffered during the war..And most signifiant never know how African American soldiers were so badly treated after the war..I'm in great fear of never seeing another season  Truly TVs very best..Ben Stephan,1336953600,,419,4.901408450704225
5005709,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"The series continues with the same wonderful characters and actors, the same inquisitive and tenacious DCS Foyle, and the same wonderful plot lines.  I hope they continue to produce even more episodes!",1334707200,,201,5.28125
5005710,4,B006MK6Y8Y,"At the end of ""set 5"" this series was brought to a more or less satisfying conclusion.  Now, with ""set 6"", it was brought back with three more episodes that don't quite live up to the excellence of the previous 5 ""sets"".  Don't get me wrong, these episodes are still very good, but just not quite excelent.  And the ""ending"" was much less satisfying.  But maybe it isn't the end after all, with rumors of the series being continued later in 2012.  It may not be Foyle's ""war"" anymore, but at least it will still be Foyle, and there is something to be said for that.",1334102400,,565,4.2924528301886795
5005711,5,B006MK6Y8Y,This series combines the best of a British detective series with World War II realities.  Michael Kitchen is a superb actor who can say more with his facial expressions than most actors can say in words.,1332892800,,203,4.638888888888889
5005712,4,B006MK6Y8Y,"Having enjoyed the previous 5 series I was looking forward to the 6th.  It was the same calibre of acting and good stories with mostly the same actors but it lacked the friendy co-operation of previous series.  With Foyle, Milner and Stewart all in different places, albeit sometimes paths crossing, it was unsatisfactory from the point of the view who loved the characters.  If there is to be a series 7 I would prefer it if they came together.  Andrew should also return.",1331251200,,473,4.662650602409639
5005713,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"These episodes start at the end of WWII as Foyle is retained as DCS since there is no one else available who can do his job.  Reluctant he may be, but he continues his investigations in a superlative manner.  Great series, great additional episodes.",1326672000,,249,4.636363636363637
5005714,3,B006MK6Y8Y,"This series was not as good as the first. Although the characters were the same,their personalities did not seem consistent with first series.",1326585600,6,142,5.217391304347826
5005715,4,B006MK6Y8Y,"Foyle's War excellently done, not-so-subtle reminders of the racial and elitest biases of WWII.  Daily life self-interest and survival issues are highlighted by the demands of war on society and individuals.  People are immeasurably imperfect!",1325462400,,243,5.914285714285715
5005716,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"If you are addicted to WW2 home front experiences, this series is going to make you very happy.  I've purchased the entire set and enjoy watching them multiple times.  The period detail is impeccable, the acting superior and the stories are entertaining.  This is like a time capsule and you get to eat non-ration food!",1323216000,,319,4.763636363636364
5005717,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"I received and have viewed set 6 of Foyle's War.  I was so disappointed when Mr Kitchens decided to do only 5 seasons of this excellent series.
But then I saw that he had been convinced to add these 3 shows as a kind of post-script.  This is an outstanding series of well-researched and superbly acted crime-dramas.  Here in America, very few know of this show which is a tragedy as it is beautifully done. Kudos to all involved.",1320537600,4,429,4.405063291139241
5005718,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"I enjoyed all six sets of this series. I will not recapitulate the contents of set 6 since prior reviewers have done so well, but will just make a few comments. I like how the series portrays the English people during war conditions and, in this set, just after the war. I like Foyle's no nonsense reactions to people. His replies are sharp, but to the point. In The Russian House, for example, he tells off his former associate, his prior boss, and the deputy of his former associate. In each case, he makes his point and gets results. I also like the cool, careful, and dogged way he delves into the murders he needs to investigate. I think many other viewers will also like the set.",1320192000,2,685,4.4015748031496065
5005719,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"UNIQUE AND RICH IN CONTENT (THANK YOU MR. HOROWITZ); AND WONDERFULLY ACTED, ESPECIALLY BY MR. MICHAEL KITCHEN (HE FALLS INTO THAT ENVIABLE CATEGORY OF ACTORS WHO CAN PROJECT SO MUCH MORE WITH SO LITTLE LESS, A TRADEMARK OF A GREAT ACTOR).
ARE THERE MORE PARTS COMING IN THE FUTURE? I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.",1316995200,2,302,4.716981132075472
5005720,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"Inspector Foyle has become one of my favorite TV characters, and I look forward to seeing more of him.

In Set 6, Insp. Foyle is desperately waiting for his replacement.  He has tendered his resignation, and in the meantime the war in Europe has ended.  American troops are biding their time until they are shipped back to the States, and British troops are coming home.  Remember, this is the 1940s, and there are both African-American and white troops on a base near Hastings.  Racial tensions mount as local girls and GIs and returning Tommies intermingle.

Foyle's replacement finally arrives, and Foyle is out of there!  He books transportation in a ship to the States, but in the meantime he starts to carry out some queries of his own.  Sgt,. Milner, now Insp. Milner, is trying to make his own mark as an investigator, and Sam, now released from service as Foyle's driver, has to discover what is next for her.

As always, the BBC does a fantastic job of producing convincing period drama.  I hope the series goes on forever.  I'm now on the hunt for Foyle 7!

5005721,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"This is when I wish I could write a real review --- all I can say is this is the finest drama I have ever purchased; I never saw it when it ran on PBS, and the joy of having the entire set was that I could watch a couple of episodes every night after work.  Flawless, brilliant performances, stellar script.  I look forward to watching it all over again as the winter nights approach.  Please consider this a review of the first 5 Seasons as well - set 6 followed suit in excellence.  The whole thing was haunting and unforgettable.",1315008000,,532,4.237623762376238

5005725,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"This is a perfect add on to the Foyle's War collection 1-5. I particularly enjoyed the ""after the war"" development and changes that took place, including the scenery, buildings, etc. It logically aged with the actual calander events that occurred. I have only one un answered question ""Why was Foyle planning on going to America"" ? I hope there is a follow up series to answer the question, and I especially hope that another series will be coming out soon !",1306022400,,458,4.666666666666667

Hi Joy,

I understand your love for the show. However, we are told by the UK producers that the most recent release (our Set 6) is more than likely the final episodes they'll do. I believe Michael Kitchen plans to retire the role. We, too, hope that something changes but unfortunately, it is out of our control.
Thanks, Alexis

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE !!!!!!
RELEASE  FOYLE'S  WAR  7  TO  YOUR FAITHFUL  AUDIENCE in U.S.A.

We consist of over a million baby boomers and our Moms  and Dads, who fully remember the war,
the era  and subsequent era.  NOTE: Baby Boomers, Babies born after  WWII, 1945/6 1950s.

We really enjoy  reliving all of  the romantic times and excitement, drama  and day to day,
history making events that completely enthralled our parents and their friends and neighbors.

We sincerely regret England's dire experiences and suffering (during the war and  post-war).
Daily,we Pray,  GOD has Blessed them with comfort, peace and well-being.

However,  the Creators, Writers, Producers, Directors and etc., of Foyle's War consistently demonstrate a very high degree of sensitivity, sympathy, caring, understanding and immense intelligence by cleverly maintaining the focus onto/into the lives and events in Foyle's life
and his work, including the life and work of his team, Sam, Milner, Brookie and etc.
Therefore, we, the audience are more involved with and really care about each of the main characters
and many of the supporting characters, i.e., Edie (Milners new wife; Brookie (new desk Sgt).

  ! ! ! ! ! We  are hooked.  We cannot  get  enough of  Foyle ! ! ! !
We are begging you to PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, Release DVDs in U.S.A., even if  it  is only ( 1 ) or
( 2 ) Episodes, irregardless of  price.
We  want  to see Foyle do the things, only Foyle can do so suavely,
* ""Speak with his Eyes"", i.e, Enemey Fire, ""Occular Conversation with Sam inre the whereabouts of  (AWOL) Andrew Foyle.""

* ""Ensure that lawbreakers make amends for  those they have harmed.

* ""Investigate, track, find, arrest those who think they're above the law, i.e.,
 -(50 Ships), Howard Page, arrogant American theif, crook, murderer.
Spanish Ambassador who caused (2) very naive and very impressionable orphaned boys togo to prison.

 -(French Drop), We want to see Foyle tell Sir Giles,that his son died a hero and not a suicide.
Bring to book the arrogant, negligent one who caused his death.

 -(Bad Blood), We want to know what happened to LC. Did Foyle allow him to return to his Ship.
We want Foyle to bring to book the Commanders who recklessly performed experiments and implemented same, irregardless of immense probability of dangerous and fatal latent effects, during and post-war.

*(Bleak Winter), Foyle's Love interest should return to Hastings.

* Andrew and Sam should marry and adopt baby that was orphaned in set 6.
There are numerous incomplete events throughout any and all series/sets that are ripe for completion in future Episodes of Foyle's War.

So, again we are begging you to PLEASE, RELEASE  FOYLE's WAR 7 TO YOUR FAITHFUL and ANXIOUS AUDIENCE in  U.S.A.  *** Sincerely, Joy  & USA Baby Boomers *** JoyBuehler@aol.com",1295308800,3,3893,5.180354267310789

What we've really noticed after watching this series is the great attention to detail given its production, and the great cross section of the classes and how their paths crossed, whether they liked it, or wanted it, or not!  Glad to see that these, after V-E Day stories, were made available!",1293926400,,467,4.7407407407407405
5005735,5,B006MK6Y8Y,What a terrific series!  The details of life during WWII make this most enjoyable viewing for anyone with an interest in the time or location.  Michael Kitchen plays Det. Chief Supt. Foyle with such understated precision.  I have the complete series plus these add-ons and watch them over and over.  They saw me through days of inactivity required during a post-surgical stint.  This is one that will be tough to Americanize.,1292889600,,425,4.929577464788732
5005736,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"This is a wonderful Series and we just finished buying Set Six!  The producers of this series has done an excellant job with every detail of this period of history.  We love Detective Superintendent Foyle (Michael Kitchen and his young driver, Honeysuckle).  The best part of these stories is the how Foyle never wavers in doing what is right even if it isn't what you think should be done or even if people try and convince him to see things their way.  An excellant series and we only wish there were more we could buy so that they would continue to product them.  The writer did an excellant job on the screen play!  This series 6 goes in a little different direction with the young detective under Foyle going off on his own and Foyle coming back from retirement for a certain job.  Sam, isn't Foyle's driver, but is trying to survive in England after the hardships of the war upon it's towns and people.",1292889600,,908,4.466666666666667
5005737,3,B006MK6Y8Y,"Being an avid fan of this British wartime drama, I finally got to view this when our local library got it in.  I was shocked that there were no behind the story special features to make the story come to life better.  Though I was grateful for the subtitles; (Honeysuckle tends to talk quickly and low-toned that sometimes you miss her best quips without subtitling)....  I only rated it 3 Stars for many of the lower rating reviews same reasons...  Although the bright star was the 3rd episode ""The Hide"" which made me really realize how important we mothers are to our children, even in a world that seems to value everything but.... My query about this one episode is when Foyle uses the almost Biblical phrase that he ""knew her"" twice to indicate to a prisoner he knew his mother...  Was it a double play on words to develop this other character for future episodes?  My main complaint was Sam being a nude model in episode 1 (did you really have to go there, everybody else does, I was hoping Foyle would stay out of that cheap genre...) Milner finally loosened up in these three and actually made me laugh with his facial expressions in several moments, but the makeup artist seemed to forget to fill in his right eyebrow completely with pencil so in some shots he looked a bit off---kind of like the other person's comment of Sam without the makeup and horribly lit...  Although I think Anthony (Milner) has a striking resemblance to a young George Washington (except for eye color) and perhaps could play him in a movie???  But, I digress...My absolute fav Foyle's War was ""Broken Souls"" and I don't think you could get any better than that---it had every emotion, every twist, and one of Chopin's best works to boot! I do find it interesting that Mr. Horowitz really likes to pick skinny Sean Penn/early Robert DeNiro look-alikes in so many of his Foyle's War episodes---the returning POW soldier in Broken Souls with the frostbit foot, as well as the character of ""Tom"" in the Russia House episode, always having them play off of fuller-faced ""regular Joe"" looking characters... I enjoyed ""Tom's"" speech he gave to Milner, who himself a wounded Veteran seemed touched by the words...  Everybody seems to dislike the Killing Time episode so I won't go there except to say I really liked the African-American actor (I think he was American, I could be wrong LOL)who played Gabe---I enjoyed watching his character interact with Foyle and everybody, and his voice reminded me of a young Sydney Poitier.  He was the best part of the whole episode in my opinion.  I always enjoy Michael's understated Foyle and in previous episodes could almost predict by his familiar cheek-chewing, eye blinking and mouth moving displays when he had solved a case.  This time, I think it was too much dialogue and since our main characters are all in different stations in life, the interplay wasn't there.  My personal wish (if they make another one) is that in America when Foyle goes, he meets up with that telegraph pole selector lady with the red coat again.  Or ends up with Elsa---I liked her addition to the Russia House, those characters always add a definite flavor to the episode that would be bland without them.  The music in the 3 episodes seemed like a Harry Potter/Polar Express/X-files combination this time around---it was interesting...
If anybody who makes Foyle's War reads this, please DON'T have the characters sacrifice their moral codes in any future episodes---yes, they are all human, but some of us out here watch these because they are calm not flashy dramas that make you think and discuss and don't need all that mindless smutty stuff... I never was taught in school how bad England had it during WW II, and I enjoy learning the history in these productions (I didn't notice the wrong uniforms for the American G.I.'s though since I am not from that era, but I appreciated learning that from the other reviewer!)Don't stoop to the level that so many previously good shows have....PLEASE!  I'm running out of anything good to watch since I don't watch cable tv anymore!  Keep Foyle with the one thing that has become synonymous with it's name; Integrity.....

5005740,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"I admit, I was slightly disappointed with the ending of the war in the prior series, as that meant the end of Foyle's War.  Thankfully I was wrong.  Series 6 is wonderful.  Certainly the final episode is the capstone of this set, and perhaps it is my favorite episode of Foyle to date.  I will not describe what occurs in the episode, but I have enjoyed watching this episode multiple times, which normally I would not do, therefore I give Foyle's War Set 6 a five star recommendation. Buy it.  Buy another set for your parents, and enjoy.  You will not be disappointed.

5005743,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"The Foyle's War series is the best series that I have ever watched. There is so much going on that you could watch it over and over again and still pick up something you missed before. It's a series that covers the Second World War in England with series six covering the period just after. The research and authenticity for these plots will blow your mind. There are so many stories  and plots interwoven into each series that watching it again is like watching a new series. There are actual historical events, multiple mystery plots and character interaction and development intertwined into each series.

The cast is exceptional with each member well chosen for his part. If you remember the movie ""Out of Africa"", you will remember Robert Redford and Meryl Streep but you may not remember the third actor, Michael Kitchen. You will when you see Foyle's War. You may be watching a murder mystery but it's a comedy watching Michael Kitchen's non-verbal expression.

My wife and I have watched the series at least six times. Now we have our neighbors and friends hooked on the series. Some have their neighbors and friends over once a week to watch the next episode. You can't go wrong with the Foyle's series. We are hoping for a seventh set and beyond.",1282953600,,1256,4.7
5005744,1,B006MK6Y8Y,"There is nothing better than the Brits' mysteries adaptations.  I own all of the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series, all of the David Suchet Poirot Series, and now all the Foyle's War set.  But let me say what is bothering me about Foyle's War, especially this latest (6th in the US) version.  In no particular order:  ever since the exectives decided to put the hatchet to the series at the end of Foyle's War 4 (mid-1943 timeline) it has been a very awkward reach.  Foyle's War 5 came in at just three stories instead of the previous four for all previous sets.  It was so obvious that they just had to ""hurry up and end it in three stories"" and it never worked.  Hey!  What happened to 1944?  So then the powers that be opened it up again, great, but why move on to post-war?  All of the actors are still recent enough...and young and current enough...to Series' five abrupt shut down in 2007 that the stories could easily have gone back and done 1944.  No one would have noticed. You still can!  Just call it Foyle's War 4.5, put Sam back in the car and none of your fans will mind!  But you better do it in the next year...assuming you remain in production.  Next point:  ""Killing Time"" is a clumsy British stab at American liberals' political correctness, and it angers me.  I buy this product to be entertained, not lectured to.  Mr. Horowitz, if you choose one more time to lecture me about my country, then I will STOP BUYING YOUR PRODUCT.  I, like many other reviewers here, hated ""Killing Time"" and I fast-forwarded it at the half-way mark.  Of course, gee, whaddaya know, it's an evil white man that's the murderer. You're the one that's racist, Mr. Horowitz, by ramming your own British political correctness down my American throat. ""Killing Time"" just alienated 50% of your current and future audiences in the States...do you not see this, Mr. Horowitz?  60% of Americans are conservatives, not liberals.  Stop with the politics and just write a good mystery, ok?  Next point:  I literally gasped at the lack of any makeup on Sam in her first appearance in this new set when she walked into the artist's studio.  Like, hey, guys, who forgot about the makeup?  She absolutely looks ghastly.  Sorry, Sam!  Later, she starts to look better, but that first shot...good God...awful!  Looked like a pale, ghastly ghost!  And my final point.  Will someoneone please tell Anthony Horowitz, great literary talent that he is, to PLEASE stop with the unwanted pregnancies and consciencious objectors!  Please, Tony?  With sugar on it?  I mean, come on.  This must be the fourth time...and I am not making that up...in the complete series we get yet ANOTHER illegitimate pregancy and ANOTHER ""conshy.""  ENOUGH!  STOP IT!  And I will also add for Mr. Horowitz that it would be nice to see one of his returning war veterans actually be an authentic and stable patriot and hero instead of what appears to be Horowitz' preferred portrayal of all returning troops as wacked-out, mentally-ill, nut jobs.  Everyone of Horowitz' returning troops have been portrayed this way, and I don't like it.  ""The Russian House"" takes too long to develop.  The only saving grace to this set is ""The Hide"" which is an outstanding story, easily one of the series' best, but not enough to save Set 6.  So there.  Go ahead and hate me.  I enjoyed previous Foyle's Wars, but I'm afraid that I'll prefer Sets 1-4 when it was clicking along like clockwork.  Sad for Michael Kitchen and the actors who have all done a wonderful job, not their fault.  Kind of like what happened to David Suchet when the ""great thinkers"" in the executive offices decided to continue the Poirot Series without his two brilliant sidekicks, Phil Jackson and Miss Lemon. Horrible decision.  PLEASE GO BACK, HOROWITZ AND WRITE 4.5 SO WE CAN SEE THE SERIES TAKE ITS PROPER COURSE THROUGH 1944.",1282521600,26,3846,4.690119760479042
5005745,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"The final episode of Set 6 ends with Foyle getting on a ship taking American soliders back to America after the end of World War II.  It seems strange, at first, but then one remembers the episode entitled ""50 Ships,"" I believe, in which an American businessman killed an English citizen.  The American had ""stole"" the idea for synchro-mesh gears from its inventor when they were both students at Oxford years ago.  As ususal, Foyle solved the crime but couldn't arrest the American because he was vital to England's obtaining help from American before December 7, 1941.  The final scene has Foyle telling the American as he boards a plane that ""someday the war will be over and I shall come to America and get you"" or some such statement.  We can only speculate why Foyl was boarding that American troop ship after the end of WWII in the episode, ""The Hide,"" but I like to think that Foyle is making good on his promise to track down that American businessman.",1282262400,3,961,4.5964912280701755
5005746,1,B006MK6Y8Y,"Foyles War has been a big favorite of my wife and me, and we have watched all five years episodes a second time recently and rated most of them with 4-5 stars.  We rate the episode of Killing Time with one star, and the whole series as one star to indicate our disappointment in general.  The BBC does not appear to like Americans and almost every time they write about the US Military it is in a derogatory way.  This episode is no different, and all the American characters, except one African American private are shown as very bad people, to the point of killing a young mother. Even the commanding officer, a Major, is a murderer.  All other European Americans soldiers are shown cheering on vicious ring fighting, which has little to do with the plot, or fighting because some African American soldiers came into a dance hall.  One sergeant shown is about as mean spirited as possible. I was in the US Army shortly after WW2, and believe me the way the US Forces are shown in the few episodes of Foyles War is not the way it was in real life. Yes, we had tough sergeants, but not just plain mean.  I was a sergeant myself.  American troops are generally shown as disorganized and undisciplined, which we were not. The plot of this episode is dark, including a young mother killed for no other reason except to show how miserable the Americans are.  Don't bother with this one, skip it. My wife quit watching this episode half way through.

The other two episodes in this sixth season are somewhat better, the first episode we rate as two star, because of many loose ends in the story.  In episode one, how could a man chasing Foyle and Samantha in a basement get killed by someone else, and Foyle, being a police officer not follow up?  No mention is ever made of this incident, no conclusion.  The final episode we rate four star after watching it a second time.  It turns out to be a very tight murder mystery with a twist at the end.  It still shows American troops in uniforms different than what were issued at the time which upset me, because it is a small error in historical accuracy. We have to admit that the third episode gave us hope for the future.  However, the final season, the sixth, clearly shows they may have jumped the shark unless they can keep the same quality of writing and plot as the third episode.

In closing, We loved the series, and only rated it a one star to draw attention to the last three episodes which are rated above a one and a two.  We just watched the last episode and rate it now a five.  A daughter of ours has lived in the UK for about 10 years, we have visited and found the British people like us about as much as we like them, in general quite a bit.  We believe the people in general do not know much about the US, especially the location of the states, but perhaps reasonable as we have such a large country compared to theirs.",1281830400,36,2883,4.355140186915888

5005748,4,B006MK6Y8Y,"This splendid series, one hopes, has come to a conclusion.  The first five years produced some of the most consistently entertaining and thoughtful episodes ever filmed.  But public demand, no doubt, warranted a year six, and there are, for the first time, some flaws.  In the first of the three films, there is a totally unbelievable chase scene. Disc two is an almost unbearable melodrama laced with political correctness.  (Angelic blacks; wicked whites.) Disc three, thanks to the brilliance of series founder and writer Anthony Horowitz, is back on target, but the violence level is starting to look like Midsomer Murders.

Look at the disasters that plagued two other fine series: year 13 of A Touch of Frost, and year 15 of Midsomer Murders. Say good night, Gracie. It was fun, and thanks.",1281139200,7,796,4.954887218045113
5005749,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"This is an excellent conclusion to a masterful British detective series. I praise this series highly because once again the brits, and Acorn media, have released a winner. I first started watching this series because I am a fan of most detective series and have an interest in World War II. I was glad I did since the casting, directing, sets, costumes, camera work, scenery, and music were first rate. You really feel you immersed in the forties and the struggle that took place for England during the war and the impact it had on everyone including the police. This set picks up after the war and DMS Foyle is still anxious to leave the force and go to America. He is coerced to remain for six more weeks to solve some cases that can have great ramifications in the first two episodes. The last episode he has left the force but he is drawn in to help the police solve it for personal reasons.

The Russian House involves Russians that were POWs that fought for the Germans against Russia because of Stalin. They are being shipped back from England and don't expect to be received well by the government. When one prisoner commits suicide, Foyle investigates the circumstances and finds their is far more below the surface of why the British goverment is being so cooperative with the Russians.

The Killing Time is about the black soldiers that fought in WWII and their ill treatment in the service not only from Americans but the British as well. The fact some of the English women fratenize with them only stirs up even more disentment. When one soldier tries to marry one that has had his child it only lands him in far more troble than he expected. When his fiance is murdered and he is accused for the crime he is lucky Foyle is on the case.

The Hide involves a condemned soldier that was a POW that became part of a British unit working for the Nazi's. When Foyle visits him in jail he can get little out of him but surmises that there is far more the case that meets the eye. Even though he is no longer on the force he pretends to be in order to shed light on the motivations for the soldier wanting to be hung.

Great quality DVDs, in fact better than the previous sets. I highly recommend this series if you enjoy mysteries, detective series, or movies about WWII.

The quality of the characters, the acting, the relationships, the development of plot, and just the flat-out adventure/mystery in the new series is superb!  It is great to see the ""team"" from the original series and equally charming are some of the new ""regulars"", such as Milner's fish-out-of-water sidekick.  The only one missing is Andrew.  With only one reference to him ""living in London"", I would have liked maybe a bit more on what they have him doing at this point in the war.

5005751,2,B006MK6Y8Y,"On the upside, the physical discs for season 6 are of higher quality than their Foyle's War predecessors, and the inclusion of SDH subtitles -- lacking in the earlier seasons -- is a plus for American ears unaccustomed to British intonations.  On the downside, there are no extras at all in the season 6 DVD set -- not even the brief textual afterthoughts of seasons 1-5 -- to explain the postwar historical context (certainly needed for these three episodes) or to comment on the production. Neither the acting nor the scripts in season 6 are up to the high standards of the wartime episodes.  With one or two exceptions, the actors seem bored and just going through the motions -- even the great Michael Kitchen just phones it in this time around and seems desperate to retire Foyle even more than Foyle wants to retire.  R.I.P. Foyle's War -- like the United Kingdom itself, it was great while the war lasted, then sadly fell into decline.",1280880000,17,942,4.662650602409639

5005758,4,B006MK6Y8Y,"""Foyle's War"" Series 6 tackles England in its first post-War summer, when everyone has a sense that the world has changed. Life won't ever be the same again, but no one is quite sure how it will be. Hastings has a new, modern police station, but DCI Foyle wants nothing more than to get away from it. He wants to resign and pursue some ""unfinished business"". But no one will let him quite yet. Sam Stewart is out of uniform. And Paul Milner is now a Detective Inspector in Brighton, struggling with a new sergeant who is not especially sharp and trying to make a name for himself without Foyle -sometimes trying clumsily, causing some friction with his former boss. Milner is more in the background now than in previous seasons, and doesn't appear at all in ""The Killing Time"".

In the months after the War, there was still plenty of political intrigue. Anthony Horowitz and his writers focus on the forced repatriation of Russian POWs, the situation of black GIs in Britain, and the British Free Corps, who were British POWs in Germany recruited to join the German cause and propagandize against the British in exchange for much better accommodations than they had in a POW camp -at least until after the War, when Britain charged them with treason. On the cultural side, there are frequent allusions to the post-War development boom and a consistent sense that big change, for better or worse, is in the air. ""The Killing Time"" is the weakest of these three episodes, with behavior that is simply not believable or accurate. The other two are quite good, though. The Acorn DVD set has no bonus features. English subtitles are optional. These are the episodes:

June 1945. DCI Foyle is anxious to resign and get on with other plans, but he's compelled to stay on until a replacement can be found. A pompous old acquaintance now working for the War Office, Brigadier Timothy Wilson (Tim Pigott-Smith), asks Foyle to quietly track down an escaped Russian POW. The POW, Ivan, seeks help from his friend Nikolai Vladchenko (Dimitry Drannikov), who is working as a gardener on the estate of Sir Leonard Spencer-Jones (Christopher Good), where Sam Stewart is also employed. Ivan intends to go to ""The Russian House"", a safe house of White Russians in London, which he hopes will protect him from deportation. But Sir Leonard is shot in his home. DI Paul Milner, now working in Brighton, is on that case, while Foyle and Sam follow the Russians to London.

July 1945. In ""The Killing Time"", American Major Wesker (Adam James) requests that the Hastings council impose temporary racial segregation on the town's bars, as there have been hostilities between black and white GIs on the base now that the fighting is over and the men are waiting to return home. A young woman staying in Sam's guest house, Mandy Dean (Charlotte Riley), is shunned by her family on account of her illegitimate child, whose father is Gabe Kelly (Obi Abili), a GI whom Mandy hopes to marry. Meanwhile, there is a rash of roadway hold-ups that target prominent citizens. Racial tensions escalate on the American base, encouraged by the intolerant Sgt. Calhoun (John Sharian). And a body is discovered in the woods. This episode has enough twists and turns to keep it interesting.

August 1945. ""The Hide"" sees Foyle resign from his position in the Hastings Police to follow an old case to America. Before he leaves, he reads that a soldier named James Devereaux (Andrew Scott) will soon be tried for treason for his participation in the British Free Corps while a POW in Germany. Foyle visits Devereaux's lawyer Mr. Deakin (Will Keen) to inquire about  the case, only to find that the young man refuses to defend himself. Upon speaking with Devereux in prison, Foyle becomes convinced that he is hiding something important. Investigating in an unofficial capacity, Foyle crosses paths with DI Milner who is investigating the murder of young Agnes Littleton, a friend of the accused traitor. Foyle's motives in this case are, at first, as mysterious as Devereaux's.",1277683200,,4033,4.839130434782609

5005760,3,B006MK6Y8Y,"Let me state upfront that I love sets 1-5 of this series and wrote a flattering review in support of them. But I was let-down by this three episode return. Moral preaching abounded in the plots revolving around loyalty, race, and betrayal. It is surprising that Michael Kitchen did not push back on some of the lines he was instructed to utter. The incredulous bearing he carried when dealing with Britain's upper crust has given way to his own superiority and self righteousness - it was uncomfortable and made me enjoy the character less. Also, I never quite got the tension between Milner and Foyle - totally unnecessary and a distraction.

The episode dealing with the strain between US black and white soldiers was just plain bad - preachy, unbelievable (Britain has its own sobering history of racial tolerance), and the actual murder plot contrived. Exploring the return of Soviet citizens who fought for Hitler was interesting (the repatriation of the Cossacks was a huge black eye for Britain) and a plot involving the Britisches Freikorps, a unit of the Waffen-SS, could have been more engaging.

Still, you want to care for the characters and historical accuracy is evident throughout. However, at the end, Foyle didn't need passage on a ship to get to America - given his moral superiority - he could have just walked across the Atlantic.",1277337600,5,1350,4.890829694323144
5005761,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"The popular British World War II detective series ""Foyle's War"" returns for an encore performance with Set Six and three new episodes set in the months following VE Day.  Michael Kitchen returns as Detective Christopher Foyle, still Chief of the Hastings Police Station but awaiting his relief.  Honeysuckle Weeks is back as Foyle's former driver Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart, now demobilized with a new job and a new relationship.  Anthony Howell is Detective Milne, just promoted to head of the nearby Brighton Police Station and negotiating an unfamiliar relationship with his former boss.  The new episodes are excellent, with hard-hitting historical context.  Detective Foyle has lost none of his passion for justice, while the return of peace hasn't done away with crime.

In ""The Russia House"", the search for a missing Russian POW turns into a complicated murder mystery with national security implications.  Foyle must deal with the intelligence services, a White Russian refugee organization, and a shameful wartime secret.

In ""The Killing Time"", the presence of African-American GI's at Hastings triggers a spate of racial prejudice.  A crime attributed to one of the GI's turns into a complex mystery.

In ""The Hide"", a newly retired Foyle, awaiting a long-cherished trip to the States, gets involved in the strange case of a British traitor who refuses to defend himself at trail.  The details of the case connect to a murder and an unexpected skeleton in Foyle's own closet.

The ending of the stories nicely accounts for the series leads without foreclosing the possibility of future reunions.  ""Foyle's War: Set Six"" is very highly recommended to fans of the series.",1276646400,,1677,5.212686567164179
5005762,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"Foyle's War 6 is one of those little surprises in life that one doesn't expect.  The original series clearly had a ending and was put into my rotation for ""annual viewing"".  When I first got wind of a new installment in the pipeline I was anticipatory but cautious. I had been disappointed before with Ballykisangel being stretched out long after it should have been put to bed and was concerned that trying to recapture the feel of wartime Hastings might be an elusive and frustrating endeavor.  But, not to worry; the dramas are very much in tune with those in the first 3 series and, in my opinion, are superior to series 4 & 5.

The first 3 series were my favorite of all the Brit tele-dramas available in the US (and that includes Morse, Lewis, Midsomer, Sherlock, Poroit, Frost, Ballykisangel, etc.).  But it was painfully obvious that series 4 & 5 seemed rushed to finish the project in the shortest period of time. The series felt truncated and the finale was more melancholy than one might associate with the end of an epic war and the anticipation of ""good times"" ahead.  It turns out that ITV's ""director of television"" cancelled the series but then faced a firestorm of protest from viewers world wide.  This protest led ITV to reverse itself and produce ""series 6"".  Additionally, Michael Kitchen was added as a producer on the show, hopefully a sign that future episodes will be forthcoming

The three included dramas do much to establish a post war footing for the character's relationship and open numerous story lines around which to craft future episodes.  In ""The Hide"" Foyle closes out series 6 by embarking on his ""unfinished business"" trip to the US and hints at a speedy return.  One can only hope that there will be more in the future as the principal actors are still with us and established in post war lives. Certainly in the short term a ""resolve"" to the ""50 Ships"" episode in volume 2 is promised.  Let's all hope this wonderful series created by Tony Horowitz (original lead writer of the Midsomer juggernaut) can continue to find life in post war England and entertain us for years to come.

UPDATE:

There's another review by someone who issued strong distaste and condemnation for one of the episodes that bordered on political diatribe. Between the ranting his main complaint appeared to be questioning the ""facts"" underlying the story line.  While everybody is entitled to their opinion, isn't this a fictional series that's allowed to take license with the facts?  One can either like or dislike a particular topic, but to condemn it based upon the selective use of ""facts"" seems illogical.  To hold any water this same individual would have to express like concern about the works of Shakespeare, Mark Twain, Ernest Hemingway and, dare I say, every film John Wayne and Ronald Reagan ever made.

Further, while ""Killing Time"" is at times uncomfortable to watch, one has to question the apoplexy some of these negative reviews have exhibited. Are these reviewers really oblivious to the racism evident in US society and it's military during the mid century?  Surely they can't be. I think they just don't like to be reminded of it.  To Foyle's War's credit, some of the brits don't come off any better (except our lead characters naturally).  Minorities rarely fare well under the pressures of war or economic hard times and America is no exception.  To show outrage at having it ""shoved down their throat"" is akin to denying it ever happened.  And that is, I believe, what we fought WWII over, at least retrospectively.

I do have one minor gripe for Series 6 as well as for the previous ones involving the US military.  Whomever the US military advisor on the series was dropped the ball on the wearing of the uniform.  Almost every scene shows gig lines not straight, epaulets not properly tucked under lapels, ribbons not properly sequenced and worst of all, brass worn out of position and numerous times upside down.",1276128000,2,3956,4.780882352941177

This is one of the best series ever, in my view and that of my husband. Not only do we learn somewhat about what England endured before, during, and after WWII, but we get to see good detective work as Foyle quietly gathers and puts together bits of information that might well escape all of us if we were to try to solve some of the crimes. In addition, relationships are realistic, there is nothing exceptionally offensive to watch, but the full impact of each situation is realized. Again, we hope for more episodes to come.",1276041600,3,633,4.51304347826087

5005765,2,B006MK6Y8Y,"Foyle's War was overall one of the best detective series I've ever seen. Much of its appeal resided in the profoundly refreshing integrity of the main characters. Apparently, the writers forgot this in bringing it back. Not only are the scripts not as well-written, but the writers seem bent on making the characters presumably more ""human"" by having them do or confess to things that are not only unnecessary to the plot but utterly out of character from what we've come to expect of them from the first 5 seasons. As excited as I was to hear of more episodes, it was a disappointing comeback.",1274832000,23,594,4.666666666666667
5005766,3,B006MK6Y8Y,"I own Series 6.  I must say that I, along with many others, was disappointed when the series ended, but it is obvious that season five was supposed to be the end.. After all, the name of the series is ""Foyles War"".  I get the impression that this series was made due to demand for more, but it is a real disappointment.  The original series family is nearly destroyed with departure of several members of cast, and weakness in the plots.  The things described did happen, as far as racism and such, but the way it is portrayed, does not help the plots.
I really think this series was an ""Add on"", and was a waste of money.  A shame, because I really enjoyed original series.",1274832000,21,674,4.317460317460317
5005767,1,B006MK6Y8Y,"The earlier seasons were excellent, and I was disappointed when it was announced that Foyle was retiring. Creator Anthony Horowitz was disappointed too, since he then had to abandon several existing wartime-era scripts and write Foyle into retirement.

After the high ratings of the last season, though, the producers decided to tack on more episodes. And unfortunately, these new episodes feel completely ""tacked-on"" and unnecessary.

The ""Russia House"" episode shows all of the major characters moving in new directions that are by turns uninteresting, unappealing, and perplexing. Sam no longer drives Foyle, but seems to exist merely to occupy a bland, less-than-lukewarm romantic subplot. Milner is now inexplicably rude to Foyle, and Foyle himself is sometimes petulant and graceless (as when he later refuses to accept Milner's repeated apologies). The good vs evil themes of earlier seasons have been replaced by moral relativism, and Foyle's main goal is to settle personal scores rather than to fight the larger injustice that is supposedly going on.

""Killing Time"" is where the series really hits rock-bottom, though. The politically-correct script dwells endlessly on Foyle's moral grandstanding and on cartoonish negative depictions of American soldiers, but fails to develop the paper-thin characters who turn out to be the villains. Even worse, the motivations of the characters are completely unexplainable. (*Spoilers ahead*) Why would the mother's ex-boyfriend want to adopt her baby from another man? Why was the Major willing to murder and risk it all in order to steal a measly payroll? Especially for a base that seemed to have only about 10 or 15 soldiers? And after going to all that effort, why did the villains admit guilt immediately in response to Foyle's wild and unsubstatiated theories? Honestly, this was one of the worst dramas I've ever seen.

The problem of unexplained motivations carried on into the third episode, which I turned off partway through after deeming it unwatchable. What a huge disappointment.",1274572800,38,2045,5.38125

5005769,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"In a perfect world, the producers and stars of this series would realize that they have even more stories to tell. However, unlike some long-running American shows, the British know how to parcel out TV pleasures in small doses, and they have found a poignant ending for this series....should it end here! (And I selfishly hope that it doesn't.) ""The Russian House"" was good Foyle, the second episode was even finer. But I believe ""The Hide"" might be the best chapter of them all about Foyle, Sam and Milner. From the bittersweet use of flashback to the amazing performance of the young actor playing the accused traitor, all the way to our last views of Foyle and Sam at the sailing of Foyle's ship to America, I felt a real tug for these characters and a greater understanding of the whole history of this era as it affected a small but significant part of our world.

I assume that anyone reading this has watched the whole series and is just looking for further affirmation that it was all worth watching. But if by some chance you are new to Foyle's War, start at the beginning and know that you are in for a real treat!",1274227200,6,1125,4.487804878048781

I saw 'The Hide' last nite on channel 13 here in New York.  It kept me glued to the TV set.  It is so nice to watch a television program that is not geared toward insipid vanity and partial nudity, but a program which provokes an individual to strap in and apply their intellect.

When I first noticed the program guide, PBS was going to air a Foyles War episode. Even though I have the DVD series 1-5, it never dawned on me that this was a new episode and yet I still recorded it for a later viewing date.

I believe England has the best detective stories including wonderful acting. My favorite series is because of the calm, soft spoken and charming character of Michael Kitchen. His simple approach while answering a question or questioning another weather a subordinate, a superior or a next door neighbor is a tilt of the head proffered by a simple smile. This series is impossible without Kitchen.

When I reviewed my DVD collection prior to going to bed the next evening, I noticed that YES. the episode I had recorded was indeed a new episode and simply did not wait. So I'm going to bed 100 minutes later. It was so worth it.

As a Yank, I do at times have to play back a few scenes where the British accent or wording of perhaps some metaphor that is difficult to understand.

There were three items to me that were brilliant. Not to spoil your enjoyment but two of them were the words  spoken by DCS Foyle to a proud jr. detective and then once again the simple yet powerful diction later in the episode to his former male employee.

One last thing, perhaps speculation on my part. If this series is continued and is received well, did anyone pick up the possibility of the encouraging sign from Foyle's answer to Sam when she asks him about retirement or did that go over your head?",1273190400,3,1603,4.506896551724138
5005773,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"""Foyle's War, Set 6"", the latest in a British mystery television series produced by Britain's ITV stations, miraculously arrives in this country, on DVD, released to coincide with its debut on American PBS stations.  So, just when we had reluctantly said goodbye to this outstanding police procedural --it had reached its planned conclusion -- we get more.  Thank you, gods of ITV.

The historical mystery series set in the quaint - and historical--south coast English city of Hastings during World War II, made its ITV debut in October, 2002, and its PBS debut in February, 2003.  Set 6 comes to us now as a boxed three DVD set consisting of the complete UK broadcast edition of three new mysteries, approximately 300 minutes.  And to add to the general joy, there are subtitles, too.  As with the previous episodes, that took us through World War II, these encore episodes, that are set immediately after the end of the war, are based on  substantial research into lesser-known facets of the war and its aftermath.  They are handsomely filmed on location, with excellent period costume, accurate transportation, and interiors, no lack of extras and vehicles; the cop shops and streets are bustling, as they should be.  The plots are intriguing, complex, many-layered, driven by compelling characters, chief of which must be Michael Kitchen, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-Africa-25th-Anniversary-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00371QQ5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of Africa: 25th Anniversary (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reckless/dp/B0001WTUKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reckless</a>) playing Detective Chief Supervisor Christopher Foyle, a man of undying rectitude, yet with a sly sense of humor.

In addition, the current series features such guest stars as Tim Pigott-Smith (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jewel-in-the-Crown-Complete-Set-VHS/dp/6303084095/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jewel in the Crown - Complete Set [VHS</a>]), and Eleanor Bron (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-House-of-Mirth/dp/B00003CXSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The House of Mirth</a>); also Max Brown, Christopher Good, and David Yelland.

The mysteries are:
The Russian House.  June 1945. The end of the war finds Britain holding 20,000 Russian prisoners of war, who fought for the Germans.  The country is anxious to repatriate them without incident, as the Russians are somehow holding a similar number of British POW's that it wants back.  A couple of Russians escape.  Foyle, who wants to retire, still agrees to help British Intelligence officials search for them.  His investigation bumps into a murder investigation run by his former subordinate Milner: there's some conflict between them.  Sam also shows up: she'd been working for the murder victim.  As I have noted before, scriptwriter Horowitz is always at his strongest in tales of father/son conflict, and he's created one here.

Killing Time. July 1945.  Black American GI's are being warehoused in Hastings, killing time, as they wait to be returned to the States.  Racial tensions accompany these men, and impinge on the British.  Should prove emotionally resonant for most Americans.

The Hide.  August 1945.  DI Milner looks into the murder of a young woman in Brighton; Foyle is drawn into a search for the motives of an accused traitor who refuses to defend himself, and therefore will be hanged.  The investigations converge.  Another of Horowitz's particularly strong stories of father/son conflict.

This series is literate and thoughtful, as it has explored the moral gray areas of war.  It has won numerous awards, been greatly praised by the critics, and proven extremely popular.  If you are a mystery fan who isn't yet familiar with it, you don't know what you're missing.  The episodes are free-standing; you can begin here with set 6, but untold pleasures await you should you go back to the beginning, with set 1.",1273017600,5,4745,6.387147335423197

I fell in love with this series years ago for all the reasons that all of the other reviewers list...intelligence, great story lines, wonderful acting,  fantastic research....etc....etc...

I own the first 5 season DVD and already pre-ordered season 6.

5005775,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"If Sherlock Holmes can be brought back from death at the Reichenbach Falls, then Christopher Foyle can certainly be recalled from permanent retirement at the Hastings Police. And fortunately for viewers, British ITV has had the good judgment to bring such a scenario to fruition. As far as this viewer is concerned, Foyle, Sam, and Milner--such wonderful characters, they seem like old friends--can go on solving mysteries as long as possible, not only in the period immediately after the war but also into the Cold War, the beginnings of which are intimated in ""The Russian House.""

As usual, the mysteries are absorbing. I especially enjoyed watching the low-key, snail's-crawl 'car chase' in the first episode; the slowness of the pace heightened the suspense even more than would the customary high-speed television cliche of cars careening through the streets in wrong-way traffic.

In addition to being a superlative detective series, ""Foyle's War"" continues to act as a mirror of history. It is fascinating to discover some of the War's dirty secrets that had been first hidden and then, conveniently, forgotten, such as the one that serves as the background for ""The Russian House."" The best thing about the continuation of the series, however, is its concentration on a period of history that is so often neglected--the depiction of what it was like to live in Britain just after the war, with rationing, food shortages, bomb-damage, displaced persons. Especially compelling is its portrayal of  the men and women who had given their hearts' blood to service for so many years, dreaming that there was no place like Home, and then upon returning sometimes discovering that Home had no place for them. All the characters of the series have been defined by their wartime personae, as Sam and the young man she meets in London indicate (She has spent most of the war as Inspector Foyle's driver and the young man has spent the war code-breaking at Bletchley Park). With the end of the war, they are analogous to actors who had been performing in a very long play after the applause has died down and the curtain has descended. They must go back to reality, but to a new reality.

So here's to Christopher Foyle: may he (and Michael Kitchen) continue to flourish! And thank you, ITV, not only for allowing him to do so, but also for providing us television viewers with such outstanding entertainment.",1272844800,27,2406,4.948019801980198
5005776,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"Post War!-What everyone who's seen Foyle's War was anxiously awaiting. Triumphant 3 NEW EPISODES of Foyle's Post-War (summer 1945). Done in the same 6-STAR excellence as the British home-front WWII series. Period drama done to perfection providing history, drama, action, romance, mystery, and suspense (6-STARS) in every episode. Its barely off the telly (aired April, 2010) and available WITH SUBTITLES only 2 months later. Wow!

Foyle's War will certainly be a classic--if not already so. It is indisputably the FINEST war drama and crime mystery combo ever produced in Britain (the world?)  Hopefully this encore will be only the start of years showing the post-war conditions in England, through the eyes of Foyle.

Michael Kitchen is back as Foyle--the series is impossible without him. Anthony Horowitz is writer/creator. And what a blessing to again see 'Sam', Miss Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks) back helping Foyle in Hastings, solving crimes and dealing with post-war issues. She has such a beautiful face--and more. A jolly voice. I just love her.

In the Series, Foyle longs for retirement, away from crime, death, and political intrigue; but now all the world longs for Foyle to be on the job for many series to come.

If you watched ""Foyle's War: Series 1-5 -From Dunkirk to VE-Day"" then Set 6 is a MUST. These 3 feature-length episodes do stand alone, but after viewing them you WILL want the complete wartime set. Don't expect to watch one episode at a time. They are so good, you'll watch them back-to-back, all 300 minutes.

Foyle's War is fiction, but so authentic and accurate to detail and events that this series is a MUST for historians. it is so historical detailed it becomes educational. Above all else, it is 6-STAR ENTERTAINMENT.

Still not enough...check this listing...""We'll Meet Again (4pc) (DVD)""",1272412800,11,1826,5.10738255033557
5005777,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"""Foyle's War"": we own and have greatly enjoyed this superb five-part series.  We own quite a few excellent British full-series productions, to include ""Inspector Morris,"" ""Inspector Lewis"" (only Series 1 & 2 in NTSC Region 1), ""Prime Suspect,"" As Time goes By,"" and two other excellent mini-series productions, ""House of Cards"" and ""State of Play.""  The Brits win the prize for exceptional masterpiece presentations.  But of all,""Foyle's War"" remains our favorite.  Naturally we have purchased series six; look forward to receiving it in June, and hope that the production continues on.

5005778,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"I saw the first episode of the new Foyle's War Series ""The Russian House"" last week while on holiday in England.  The story was excellent. The writers took off where ""All Clear"" left off. The previews for the 2nd episode about racism in the US Army at the end of the war looked like a great story line as well.  Foyle's War is one of the best programs I've seen on TV.",1271721600,12,368,4.097222222222222
5005779,4,B006MK6Y8Y,"An interesting series that is set in WW2 England, and there is no attempt to cover up the fact that they hated their enemey. Political Correctness is no so eveident. This is really just a side bar as the series is about a detective who has to work with war time shortages to solve murders. A real solid series, with great sets and a real feel for the time.",1271030400,8,356,4.173913043478261

We own sets 1-5 and have enjoyed watching them many times (they are so well done you do not tire of watching).  In fact, we will probably view them again in preparation for the new series on PBS.  Much thanks to whomever was responsible for Foyle's return!!",1270771200,17,349,4.338461538461538
5005781,5,B006MK6Y8Y,"This, and the preceding Foyle's War series entries, are the very best of the best.  The writing is compelling and true, the production very accurate and real, the history impeccable and the acting just magnificent.  It is hard to over praise this series.  Not only is everything done so beautifully, but the discs include sources for more information on the background of each episode.  There is such a sense of reality in these episodes.  If you value accurate history and want more of why or what happened, these writers and producers are for you.  The characters are so believable and the background so true, that you feel as if you are part of the events as shown.  It is not often you find a production with everything at such a level of accomplishment.",1269820800,80,758,4.654135338345864
