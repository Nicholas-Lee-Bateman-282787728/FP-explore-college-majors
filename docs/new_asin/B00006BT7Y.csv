He would then carry out his mission and return to the official whom he had robbed to report."" Thus did a young filmmaker who found himself in British Intelligence during WW2 describe Eddie Chapman. Certainly if Chapman didn't exist, you'd have to invent him. Playboy, conman, burglar, spy, a member of the pre-WW2 `Gelignite Gang' and the only British citizen to be awarded the Iron Cross, during WW2 he was recruited by the Nazis as a spy only to end up spying on them for the British. Terence Young would appear to be the perfect director to bring his story to the screen - not only did he direct three Bond movies but he had been a friend of Chapman's: in fact, he was the young intelligence officer who gave that realistic appraisal of his abilities and weaknesses. Unfortunately, the book 1967's Triple Cross was based on was heavily vetted by MI5 and the film had even less to do with the truth, either as Chapman (who didn't care much for the film) told it or as it really happened.

One of those international co-productions so popular in the late Sixties (in this case Anglo-French), it has a good cast - Christopher Plummer as Chapman, Romy Schneider, Trevor Howard, Yul Brynner and Bond veterans Gert Frobe and Claudine Auger - and a more than healthy budget. On paper, the Private War of Eddie Chapman, Inc. certainly has everything it needs for an above-average thriller, with Chapman a potentially perfect 60's antihero. Arrested while posing as a financier (""I handle other people's money"") in the Channel Islands and still imprisoned when the Germans invade, he's quick to offer his talents to the invaders on the grounds that ""I'd rather live for Germany than die for England."" After being vetted by Frobe's policeman and Schneider's Countess he finds himself under exclusive personal contract to Brynner's old school general and eventually sent back to England to destroy an aircraft factory, only to immediately offer his services to the even more suspicious British - for the right price.

Yet while it maps out a steady course it all seems a little unambitious, happy to settle for enjoyable enough Saturday night fare. Moments ring true, such as Chapman being paid in British Stirling taken from troops captured at Dunkirk or Howard refusing Chapman's request for a Distinguished Service Order because ""I happen to wear it myself when I'm in uniform and I'm a snob about whoever else should wear it,"" while the film is particularly successful in showing the gradual defeatist attitude that overtakes the Germans, from generals merely grunting a reply to a Heil Hitler to Chapman's working for the British becoming an open secret in the German intelligence community that no-one cares enough to do anything about. Plummer's a convincingly amoral Chapman, blithely untroubled by any semblance of conscience and enjoying the ride, but it's Frobe's suspicious ex-policeman, secure in the knowledge that police are always needed whatever regime is in power, who is the most interesting character despite never being developed as enough of a potential threat. Unfortunately, there's rather a lack of threat throughout despite a couple of minor moments of suspense, Chapman's unshakeable self-belief being mirrored by a script that never seriously conveys the possibility of discovery.

If he's not as lazy as he'd later become, Young's diehard bad habits are present, from the trademark dodgy dubbing of bit players (step forward Robert Rietty at the microphone) and casting of old pals like Anthony Dawson (Professor Dent in Dr No), with the film managing to be a rather slick package that's perhaps not as well wrapped as it could be in places - to use a metaphor the famed bon vivant probably would have approved of, a good wine delivered in a slightly cracked bottle. Chief among the cracks is the oh so happening Sixties title song that's so wrong it's almost loveable, with dementedly cast-off Bond-song lyrics -

""You've been crossed,
And even crossed double,
If you've been around, that's normal for the cooourrrsssse,
But you won't believe the trouble,
You'll find in just one man,
The man of the Triple Cross!!!
Give him love,
He will always keep taking,
He can only win,
And you will take the loss,
So before your world is shaken,
Escape him if you can,
The maaa-aaa-aaannn of the Triple Cross!!!!""

There have subsequently been two books about Chapman's exploits this year, with Ben Macintyre's Agent Zigzag highly recommended if you want to find out the true story. But as rainy day take-it-with-a-grain-of-salt entertainment, Triple Cross does well enough.

No real extras on the UK PAL DVD - justa few pages of text notes - but an acceptable 1.66:1 widescreen transfer.",1202860800,9,4924,4.926506024096385
1741561,4,B00006BT7Y,"For those who still wonder whether this title is available or not in DVD format, the answer is YES but, not in NTSC (U.S. Format).

The only two versions available are in the UK from Amazon.co.uk from an obscure Label called Prism Leisure (An Odyssey Bestseller) and includes the movie in a very shortened format (about 120 min. in PAL, equivalent to about the original U.S. Theatrical Release which in NTSC would come to about 125 to 126min. in length - The British version was originally cut at 140min.), and the other in Germany from another obscure DVD producer called E-M-S.

While I have no idea how the German copy looks like, or sounds like, the British copy I own, despite the 20min. cut-down, is fairly decent, with a clear transfer and a 2.0 channel Monaural sound, which on modern DVD players could be even further enhanced through Dolby Pro Logic.

Funny that at the opening we are served with the legendary WB, Warner Bros. Pictures Shield logo, and indeed, this movie was originally distributed by  this Company. Why they didn't decide to release it in the U.S. is beyond me. Perhaps due to copyright fights and other stupid legal stuff going on behind closed curtains.

Anyhow, the picture is presented in a letterbox (non-anamorphic) version, reproducing the original theatrical 1.66:1 Aspect Ratio which, even on Standard Screens shouldn't really be too bad.

Finally, if you are lucky enough to own a code-free (region free) DVD player, you should be able to enjoy this picture without problems. The movie is fully English spoken (even the Germans speak English).

The German copy, probably includes the fully German-spoken version of the film, but as is usual for German internationally released DVDs, (see other titles from Germany such as ""El Cid"", ""Fall of the Roman Empire"", ""Circus World"" or even ""55 Days at Peking"" which amazingly are all not available on DVD or in Widescreen either in the UK, nor in the States) which all sport an English Track (perhaps in Mono, usually though in 2-channel mono), accompanying its German one.

I only hope that Warner, Paramount, Columbia (through Sony perhaps), may work up the time and the guts to finally find pristine copies of said movies, remaster them either in Stereo (there are copies around) or even in Dolby Surround 2.0/5.1.

In the case of movies such as ""Fall of the Roman Empire"", one would have expected a rediscovery when in 2000, ""Gladiator"" was released, which was set in the very same period of time.

But then again, this movie, such as ""55 Days in Peking"" and ""El Cid"" were  all produced by Samuel Bronston, the black sheep producer.

Funny, because just recently, another product by Bronston has been splendidly released on DVD, and this is ""Becket"", starring Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole.

""Triple Cross"" is not Bronston's child, it is more a James Bond son-in-law, because of who directed it, Terence Young (director of the first 4 Bond movies) and the prominent presence of Gert Frbe (Goldfinger) in it.
This is why I cannot understand why nobody in the U.S. seems to care about this movie release on DVD.

The story is losely based on a true life adventurer (and  jewel thief) of the period (an opportunist if you will). Eddie Chapman, became overnight from a nobody, but in grand-style (he had some very luxurious ambitions and habits), one of the most sought spies in Europe.
Hired at first by the Germans, who actually liberated him from a British jail on the isle of Jersey, when this was occupied by them, he then was caught by the British Military Intelligence and blackmailed into becoming a double agent.
Although caught in the middle, Chapman managed masterfully to play and manipulate the two sides, the one against the other, in order to gain more out of them both, hence the title of the movie: ""TRIPLE CROSS"".
Originally, the movie was known as just ""The Eddie Chapman Story"", which subsequently became the subtitle, and then completely disappeared altogether, leaving ""Triple Cross"" in place.

This is a wise buy, for all those who like spy thrillers of a certain nature, and due to the flamboyant figure played very skillfully by Christopher Plummer, the grand seigneur of the English-speaking stage, and an exceptionally great cast, varying from Yul Brynner to Romy Schneider and from Trevor Howard to Claudine Auger (Thunderball), it shouldn't be too difficult to decide to acquire this DVD.

I gave it just 4 stars, because the extras are a little bit skinny, and a second or a third language track and/or subtitles would have been in order. As said, the transfer is pretty decent and the sound is very clear, enabling everybody to enjoy this movie to the fullest.

In my humble view, a MUST BUY.

UPDATE 2011

Still not available in the United States, yet re-released in Germany in 2010 with a new cover as ""Triple Cross - Spion zwischen zwei Fronten"" (ASIN: B0030E7NB2) by Best Entertainment (amazingly it appears that it was produced in 2007), it does not change much from the previous UK release, except for the reworked sound.

Be AWARE! It is not 134 minutes long, as specified on the label! More to it later...
Pity! Because it would have been nearer to its original length of 140 minutes.
Not such luck!

The English version, once again, as its British cousin, is just 121 minutes in length, which again, is about 125 to 126 minutes in length, were it shown in NTSC (US TV system).
Only the German version is 134 minutes long and the copy used is not as good as the English version, although not terrible (it is just that it shows
the age of the movie).

I do not understand how they could come up with a longer ""German"" version and not find its ""British"" counterpart, since the English version was 140 minutes long when first released. This makes the ""German"" copy the longest version available to date.

Another thing I do not understand is that the same disc has the choice among the two versions, but once you have chosen, which one to view, you will be stuck with it. You cannot switch among languages, probably because they burned two different movies on one DVD.

Why could they not just Remaster the German movie, adding the missing scenes to the British version, then burn it on DVD and leave the language open for the viewer to chose?

Was it just laziness of lack of funds?

Criterion has released many minor movies of the '50s and '60s. Why can't they take care of it?
I am sure they would be able to transform the German copy of the movie into a masterpiece and do exactly what I have exposed before.

The only thing changing here, as said earlier, is the sound. But seemingly, also just for the German version, which rather than being as they specify on the sleeve in DD 5.1, just in a very discreet 2.0 Stereo mix.
This time we have a re-worked (enhanced) 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo Sound. Same applies somewhat to the English version.
Yet, when checking on my OPPO player it correctly states that it was recorded in DD 5.1. Where have the other 3.1 channels gone?
It's funny, because the original copy of the movie just sported a conventional Monaural soundtrack.

It is said that there were some copies which sported a Stereo track, and I would be satisfied with this, but why then boasting that it was remastered in 5.1, when sound-wise all you get is Left, Right and Center channel.

The result is not too bad, mind you, except maybe for an occasional slight echoing of voices and some special audio effects which are really a bit
too bombastic for a movie of this kind.

But in the end it is still a very entertaining and watchable movie.
For those of you, lucky enough to possess a code-free DVD player, this is simply a must.

But if you expected the full-length feature, at least in its English version, then you better pray and wait until they will finally dish it up from some well-hidden vault, or until the people at Criterion take notice and buy the rights to give it the usual luster.

So far, the standard length is 121 minutes (126 in the US), due to different ""reading"" speeds between PAL and NTSC systems.

So, if you want it in English, it's a game of either or, meaning either the copy available in England (which is just in English), or if you cannot resist the temptation to watch a longer version (but in German), then buying it in Germany.

Oh, and one more thing. The German version seems to be in an aspect ratio of 1.78:1, while the English version, on both DVDs (British and German) is just at 1.66:1. Not much of a difference, but still noticeable.

The choice is yours... Do you feel lucky?",1191456000,7,8553,4.6786666666666665
1741562,5,B00006BT7Y,"Eddie Chapman is a wily safe cracker who, while stuck in jail, is recruited by the German intelligence to spy for them in WW2. In return, he is promised cash and his freedom.

1741574,5,B00006BT7Y,"Triple Cross, 1966 film

This is based on the true story of Eddie Chapman, a burglar who was in prison on the Isle of Jersey when Nazi Germany invaded this island off the coast of France. The Gestapo interviewed him and offered him a choice: return to England as a German spy, or be sent to a prison in Germany. Eddie chose the first option, of course. A criminal like Eddie would best know how to elude the English police. He was trained to use a radio and then parachuted into England. He was to immediately contact German Intelligence upon landing. But Eddie thought he would outsmart the Nazis, and decided to turn himself in to Scotland Yard. He discovered the truth from a farm wagon: he was still in France! He then acted appropriately. After passing the tests, Eddie was dropped into England with money and instructions. His first action was to turn himself in to the British authorities. They were blas about it. He parachuted into England with a German radio; that made him a spy like the many who were hanged! Like other captured German spies, Eddie was used to transmit misleading information that was more or less correct. The whole story is told in the books published in the 1970s (The Double Cross System). Every German agent sent to Britain was captured, and either turned around or hanged.

A person who works for the other side is known as a Double Agent. One who works for the other side but is secretly working for his own side is called a Triple Agent. They will be paid by two sides but will work for only one side. The Twenty Committee (XX) operated on the double cross system: the German spies were turned around or doubled so they worked for the British. There is always a problem in using spies since some will really be working for the other side. The British had The Ultra Secret to determine who was doing what. Eddie Chapman wanted his criminal record to be expunged for his work. He is told this will be done. At the end his request for a medal is denied (as it would be in most cases). When asked about his criminal record, he is told all his records were burned up in the Blitz!

Books have been written about Eddie Chapman, they will contain more facts. The autobiography of Dusko Popov (Spy Counterspy) is a better story, but unlikely to be made into a movie. Do read his book if you can find it. One reason for the unavailability of this film is the presence of Gert Frbe; he is on a blacklist because of his film work in the early 1940s.
