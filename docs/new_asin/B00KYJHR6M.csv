6453801,5,B00KYJHR6M,"A well-done production, focusing on an extremely difficult time in our country.  This video reminds us of the pain and grief we all felt on 9-11 and the days,  weeks, and months afterwards.",1419292800,,189,4.696969696969697
6453802,5,B00KYJHR6M,"This documentary tells the story of financial services firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, and its employees and employees' families following 9/11. Cantor's corporate headquarters were on floors 101 through 105 of the North Tower. All 658 Cantor employees on those floors at the time of the attack perished (nearly 2/3 of the company's entire workforce).

The first 3/4 of the film focuses on how CEO Howard Lutnick handled the dual-problem of addressing family concerns (transitioning from whether a loved one was alive to what kind of financial support Cantor would provide) and keeping the company afloat. JPMorgan very nearly took complete control of the company after throwing a $70 billion lifeline to Cantor in the first week after the attacks.

At first, Lutnick received significant praise for his compassion for and dedication to the families. Lutnick himself lost a brother that day. The media quickly turned on him after dissatisfied family members publicly questioned his sincerity. The last 1/4 tracks Cantor's financial support and political advocacy for the families in the years after 9/11.

The director, Danielle Gardner (who lost her brother, as well), is clearly sympathetic to Lutnick and the work Cantor did in the aftermath. Still, it was a cold reality check to peak into how banks, investment firms, and exchanges behaved in that first quarter. Crass or not, these institutions carried on. Highly recommended for a little-discussed part of 9/11.",1419033600,4,1461,5.316017316017316
6453803,2,B00KYJHR6M,"I had to turn it off after about a half-hour.  For me, it's a very hard thing to tell a story about how tough it is to get a business up and running, when the backdrop is 9/11.  Listening to testimony about how they had to write stock orders on napkins or they only had a skeleton crew working on the first day back because everyone else was...dead - pretty difficult to not wince.  It feels like the doc was conceived as a tribute to the CEO and his ""heroism"" in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy.  I understand that money was needed to help families, but it almost seems better not to be discussed or maybe it's still too soon.  Aside from being a little repulsed by the focus of the film, the direction itself is wanting.  The reenactments feel a bit like something from a low-budget true crime show.  Overall - can't recommend this documentary unless one has a particular interest in how the financial markets resumed post 9/11.",1416268800,5,927,4.385964912280702
6453804,5,B00KYJHR6M,The documentary is a timely reminder of the both the losses incurred on September 11th and of the resilience of the survivors.  The in depth look at how the tragedy played out for Cantor Fitzgerald is an inspiring story of the challenges of leadership in the darkest of days.,1415664000,5,275,4.612244897959184

6453809,5,B00KYJHR6M,Since I knew the Shes brothers who died that da and were featured in the documentary. The movie had a special meaning for me. Great doc.,1445904000,2,136,4.269230769230769
6453810,4,B00KYJHR6M,"This is the story about the aftermath and struggle of one company that lost two thirds of its employees in the collapse of the North tower.
It portrays the roller coaster of emotion on both sides between the those who run the company and the families of the lost loved ones.
A story of compassion, consolation, and compensation that took years to resolve.",1443744000,3,355,4.650793650793651
6453811,5,B00KYJHR6M,"Great film that dovetails Cantor Fitzgerald's 9/11 tragedy with the critical needs of the business. Seeing and hearing the CEO cope not only with the loss of his own brother, but also with the loss of almost all of his employees (many of whom were personal friends)---so sad. And dogpiled of top of all the human stories, the pressing need to upright the business so it would be solvent to provide financial support in future years.

This film is a wonderful tribute to those who were lost and those who worked to bring Cantor Fitzgerald back. For those of us that witnessed this history live in 2001, the footage and interviews will certainly recall that time vividly. This is suitable for older kids to watch, it will give more dimension to the idea that ""recovery"" from 9/11 means more than just cleaning up Ground Zero. My kids were particularly touched by the fact that Cantor Fitzgerald fought to have names listed on the memorial in an arrangement that showed association between people who worked, knew, and loved one another.",1443312000,7,1034,4.776536312849162

8662628,5,B00KYJHR6M,Excellent documentary.  It gives one important lesson which is to avoid the media hype of headlines.  The manipulation by Bill O'Reilly and others in reporting about the CEO and his decisions in the first weeks after the terrorism was uncalled for and put their lives in jeopardy when they were trying to save the company to be able to give the family members what they ultimately received.,1531094400,,390,4.8059701492537314
8662629,5,B00KYJHR6M,"This riveting documentary shows how the Cantor-Fitzgerald Financial Services company literally rose from the ashes of the September 11th terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. The company lost 648 employees who showed up to work on floors 101 - 105. Tragically their offices were above the impact zone of American Airlines Flight 11, which crashed into the North Tower. Their tragic location left them trapped with no way to evacuate the building.
This film follows Howard Lutnick, the head of the company as he struggles to rebuild, cope with the incredible loss of life, including the loss of his own brother and compensate the families of the friends who were lost in that fateful day.",1526256000,,694,4.991379310344827

8662634,4,B00KYJHR6M,"This shares the story of a CEO whose company lost more employees than any other company on 9/11. He cries in front of the media and says he will support 700 families! He has to beg banks for 70 million $ to support the company and family members demand paychecks of their dead family members. When the checks re not forthcoming the media blast the CEO and he is vilified and threated by people caught up in a stream of blame. Sad.

The CEO aspires to make things right/better. At times heartbreak and sad. Surreal. Swearing.",1488672000,,524,4.458333333333333

8662637,5,B00KYJHR6M,"This is one of the best 9/11 documentaries I have seen.  I am currently getting a Masters Degree in Global and Homeland Security so, I have watched a lot of 9/11 footage for classes and papers.  This one was beyond compelling.  You watching things like 102 days that changed America and others and this one really made me feel the human aspect of that day, and the lose of people not just office buildings and iconic economy power towers.  Listening to the families describe the emotions from one minute to the next following the collapse is heart wrenching.",1455840000,3,558,4.663265306122449
