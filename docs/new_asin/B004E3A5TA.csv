8426431,2,B004E3A5TA,"After waiting almost a month for the delivery from Toe Tag and several e mails later I have not been able to see it complete, through our own inability to understand the dialogue. If it had captions, maybe, but the accents and delivery are almost indescipherable. The acting was also not very believable and the make up is atrocious. Not the best from Fred Vogel. I will not be buying from this seller.",1472601600,,402,4.52054794520548
8426432,5,B004E3A5TA,"Well built story about a war veteran who came back to his family after contacting a disease which slowly transforms him into a zombie.

Quite possibly the best zombie character ever made in all movies. From Fred Vogel (August underground trilogy and Murder collection Volume 1).",1442102400,,278,5.043478260869565

8426435,4,B004E3A5TA,"For those people who want to like gore films but aren't sure where to start, this movie is pretty solid. Fairly realistic blood and gore (nothing like the AU trilogy) with a solid plot overall great acting and makeup and palpable tension. Props to Fred on this movie, great casting choices, and for a low budget independent film damn impressive. I really liked it and recommend it. Wasn't too crazy about the plot twist at the end but the gore and seeing Jade Risser in a soft core scene really made up for it ;)",1331596800,,512,4.4
8426436,1,B004E3A5TA,"I've seen all of Fred Vogel's films now, and I'm more convinced than ever that he's not capable of anything more sophisticated or compelling than faux-snuff films.  I was genuinely offended by Mordum - and that doesn't happen often.  It was a movie that stretched my boundaries - in an interesting way.

This film had a strong premise that was let down by bad makeup, terrible dialog, bad acting, one dimensional characters and a total absence of tension or menace in the build up to the finale.  Sure, a family dog gets eaten, a jawbone gets ripped off, a skull gets crushed, a neck is impaled on broken glass...yawwn.  In other words, gore for gore's sake has been DONE, endlessly, and ad nauseam (literally).  I was hoping that Vogel might show an ability to craft an interesting yarn with multi-levelled characterisation and punctuated with effective, well-timed horror.

Erm.  Nope.  Nothing to see here.",1304294400,3,909,4.888888888888889
8426437,4,B004E3A5TA,"I recommend Sella Turcica. See it if you are an intellectual fan of low-budget horror.
Amazon's Editorial Review offers the plot already. Thus, I shall not re-view that.
Rather, this review offers some criticisms and compliments. But, as stated, buy Sella Turcica; you won't be disappointed.

I shall mention Sella Turcica's possible weak points first. I have but three. Most prominently, the acting is very hit & miss. Keaton and Maruscak perform solidly throughout. However, quite often, other performances remind a viewer very distinctly that he's just watching a performance. The line-reading, emoting, and chemistry are sometimes very flat. A second issue is Brad's make-up effects. They are very hit-and-miss too. At times, they are as though Savini himself did them. At other times, they look like a Halloween kit, a cheap one. And, again, the film's illusion is broken. As for the effects, they are a lot of gross-out. And, that is my third criticism. Sella Turcica grosses out a viewer more often than it horrifies him.

So, why recommend Sella Turcica? Sella Turcica's mystery is one of its strong elements. A viewer enjoys piecing together possible explanations for the illness. Horror and sci-fi fans will have especial fun. Is this film about alien abduction, ghouls, witchcraft, a maniac, a surreal experience? What?
As mentioned, the film is very hit & miss. But, when it hits, it hits dead-on. I mentioned the effects. Effects proudly on display, the film's finale is a real masterpiece. It is beautiful and memorable for its imaginative and well-done craftsmanship. Gorehounds should admire this scene for a long, long time. However, even more impressively, the finale is also profoundly effective emotionally, not just visually. Horror and pity envelop one while viewing. And, unfortunately, I cannot discuss the denouement much without ruining the film. But, the scene's underlying statement is heartbreaking and hits home. The film's allegorical discussion comes to a helluva conclusion.

Before the end, Sella Turcica offers plenty of imagery worthy of analysis. One particular metaphor works brilliantly. Brad becomes agitated by certain high-pitch sounds. That is to say, certain sounds set him off. And, that's PTSD for you--although his condition may or may not be PTSD (I'm not giving that away). I must praise also another ongoing underlying metaphor. Brad has black crap--potentially necrotic--flowing from his ears and butt, and he wants to hide the material within him from his family. The material originates seemingly from his head in which the veteran holds a severe pain. The sella turcica is part of the brain. A viewer could interpret these symptoms and images in many ways. Perhaps, memories of combat and death torture Sgt. Roback. Perhaps, he holds now death inside his skull and guts. Perhaps, his memories eat him from within. Throughout, his family experiences/encounters Brad's illness and anguish more and more--despite him hiding it (as many vets do from their families). Perhaps, metaphorically, war eats everyone's psyches and guts. Thus, Sella Turcica has the tagline ""For Brad the war is over; for his family it's just begun.""

As indicated, Sella Turcica does not hesitate to shock. The gross and gruesome effects do so. The film's chilling events and images do so. And, the dialogue and situations do so.
I am not a military veteran. However, Brad's dialogue describes an Iraq experience that many have described to me. And, it recounts life-changing events that a vet's family perhaps does not want to hear. One very memorable scene is the monkey story. Brad attempts telling a humorous story from Iraq about a monkey. But, he is so sick--from his war experience--that the funny tale becomes utterly depressing. It tears his family's heart out listening. The war's geist consumes this ""joyous"" moment this way.
I mention one other scene. The opening has the family awaiting their returning soldier. And, I thought the scene touching and well-done.

Consider buying, supporting, and viewing this well-crafted, well-thought work. Sella Turcica is a film by thoughtful horror fans for thoughtful horror fans.",1299456000,3,4157,5.254518072289157
8426438,4,B004E3A5TA,"Most people think of Toe Tag as the guys who made the August Underground Trilogy. Some people loved that series, while others (like myself) thought it was rather mediocre. Now, Toe Tag has released a movie that will satisfy gorehounds and people who actually want to watch a good movie. Sella Turcica is about a man coming home from the war in a wheelchair, but it is obvious that something else has happened to him. That's all that I'll say because there is a HUGE twist in the last 20 min. of the film. I thought the twist was a little disappointing (the only reason why this got 4 stars instead of 5) because SPOILER the movie played like a drama but changed abruptly into a full-fledged horror movie. The reason why I thought it was disappointing was because I thought that a more realistic twist would have been very cool to see. However, throughout the entire movie there was a sense of dread and nervousness building up that I thought was one of the best things about this movie. The gore effects were good even though there was really only one gory scene in the whole one hour forty five minutes. There are also some stars in the movie. The only two that I know of are the once little girl from Murder Set Pieces and Camille Keaton from the original I Spit on Your Grave. The performances were very reputable all around. I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants to see something a little different and definately to Toe Tag fans. And Toe Tag, I can't wait to see what you bring next.",1293753600,2,1501,4.422382671480144
