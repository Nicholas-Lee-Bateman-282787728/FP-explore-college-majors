8413340,5,B0042AGN96,"This is a very good DVD with some very good lessons from coach Ditka.  I also have the Bobby Bowden DVD.  While the coach Bowden lessons focus primarily on religion and family, the Ditka DVD is basically an a** chewing so to speak.  The Mike Ditka DVD is well worth the money and can be watched over and over.",1425859200,,309,4.203389830508475
8413341,5,B0042AGN96,"This DVD is quite amazing and well done.  I've shown it to several coaches and players and they all love Ditka and the way he delivers the messages.  I feel it's important to defend against another review I saw here.  i think the reviewer really misses the whole point and design of these DVDs and frankly I'm guessing the reviewer is probably out of touch with ""pop culture"" and the most effective way to get messages across to todays consumer.  The production is actually a big part of why I really enjoyed the DVDs.  The messages are delivered and produced in a very powerful and visceral way.  They are delivered in succinct/contained 1 and 2 minute increments.  i would much prefer this to a long ""lecture"" type delivery while a coach is sitting at a desk or on some stage in a hotel conference room.  The music, editing and actual NFL footage provide an extra layer of impact.  They are also indexed in a way that I can find exactly the type of message I need when I need it versus trying to scroll through one long speech.

And as far as the originality of each coaches message-not sure where to start-every coach talked about so many different subjects in a way I have never heard before.  Do you really think legendary coaches like these would just go on camera and read ""cliches""???  They all speak from the heart and in their own unique context based on ""THEIR INDIVIDUAL"" life experiences.

And by the way-I visited the Victor 1 site and noticed that Adam Schefter from ESPN and Michael Lombardi from NFL Network raved about the DVDS-as any football fan knows, these two guys are the real experts.

All in all pretty good stuff and I really enjoyed the product.",1291593600,3,1673,4.533333333333333
8413342,3,B0042AGN96,"This is a very difficult review to write. It is difficult because the message contained in GET COACHED by Mike Ditka is well worth hearing and if I were basing this review solely on message content, I would have rated it higher.

I bought the entire GET COACHED set with very high expectations. When it comes to motivation, I believe sports coaches are some of the very best at it. I hold the late college basketball coach John Wooden in the highest regard and have handed out numerous books of his to clients, employees and friends. Some of the best and most inspiring speeches I have heard were delivered by coaches. So it was with great anticipation that I waited for this set of DVD's to arrive.

As with all of the DVD's in this set, the message Coach Mike Ditka delivers is fantastic and should be heard be everyone. The problem is, anyone who has ever read just about any book on self improvement has heard every bit of this before. I hate to say it because I really like Mike Ditka, but there is nothing new here.

My biggest complaint, however, is with the overall production of the series. The viewer is given a brief segment of what might be termed a motivational ""one-liner"", then the camera breaks away to what becomes a very annoying graphic reminding you this is COACH DITKA, brought to you by VICTOR 1.

The entire thing would have been much better, much more effective, and much less annoying if they simply had the coach standing in front of a group or even sitting at his desk talking to the viewer and not subject the viewer to the endless message breaks.

My favorite portion of this DVD came when Coach Ditka quoted Vince Lombardi, ""The quality of your life is in direct proportion to your committment to excellence"". Unfortunately the production crew at Victor 1 did not ""commit to excellence"".",1291593600,,1817,4.561349693251533
8413343,5,B0042AGN96,This DVD really got me charged up!  Listening to Mike Ditka's inspirational lessons was just what I needed.  I know so many buddies who would benefit from this one!,1289865600,2,164,4.620689655172414
