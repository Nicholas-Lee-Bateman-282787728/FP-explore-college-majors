4254283,3,B0043988JY,"Jungle Book: This is just a cheap copy of Disney that appears to have cost a lot less and lacks the Disney touch. The story is OK but not great.
Aladin is the same as Jungle Book.",1329350400,10,179,3.864864864864865

4254290,5,B0043988JY,"A truly wonderful film  especially in 3D..
Many DVDs are released in uncut, 3D or Blu-ray versions - encoded for A-2.  A-2 will not play on most players sold in USA.
Get a universal player from a company like OPPO  sold on Amazon USA.  Believe me it is worth it.",1474588800,3,262,4.18

4254294,5,B0043988JY,"I saw this film in the theater in 3-D. I thought it was extremely well done. As it was filmed in 3-D I prefer to purchase it in that format.  I want to add this title to my collection, but I will not do so until it is released in Blu-Ray 3-D.",1469923200,28,242,3.6538461538461537

8414397,5,B0043988JY,"Disney is ""backing out"" of it's original ""promise"" of filming all of it's content in 3-D.  Although releasing MOST of it's films in 3-D to
theatres, they do not release them in 3-D on Blu-Ray in the USA.  This means if I want 3-D Blu-Ray discs, I must get them through
Amazon from the UK.  In spite of Disney's ""squeaky-clean"" image, they are nothing more than a greedy, money-grubbing corporation !!!",1478476800,6,401,4.619718309859155
8414398,5,B0043988JY,"It is the best movie I have seen in a very long time. The 3D is amazing, and the movie kept you holding your breath at times. I suggest everyone see it.
