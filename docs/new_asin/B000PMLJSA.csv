8192807,3,B000PMLJSA,"It's a low-budget, sometimes melodramatic, but beneficial movie exploring the problem of cheating. My favorite scenes are any with Monique Edwards, who plays an exemplary teacher, and the scenes where Robert Loggia interacts with John Amos or Craig T. Nelson.",1326499200,,259,5.5
8192808,2,B000PMLJSA,"AGAINST TIME is a dreary little film meant to be uplifting. It's the story of ""Z.T."", a popular, handsome high school ballplayer and down-cellar inventor who is suddenly visited by himself as an old man, ""Zack."" Zack's a sloppy, weeping drunk who has come back through time to warn himself not to foul up his life.

It's a good premise, a kind of serious version of BACK TO THE FUTURE, but Z.T. is too slow to recognize himself in Zack, and Zack is too slow to get to the point. Instead, Z.T. and Zack do a kind of mopey nostalgia dance around each other while not-so-pleasant things happen to the people in Z.T.'s life.

This is a cautionary ""carpe diem"" tale about how life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans (to quote John Lennon), but it would have been better had Z.T./Zack been just a little less self-absorbed and just a little more interested in the people he/they value.",1284336000,2,904,4.5060975609756095
8192809,3,B000PMLJSA,"I had great hopes for this movie, not only before watching it but virtually all the way through the story.  Then, in the last scene comes a twist that makes all the previous movie seem confusing.  I thought it was a fantasy, or a 'Heaven-can-wait' movie, but the last scene completely upsets that notion.  It certainly has a good fantasy premise, that someone comes back from someplace in time to help someone on earth avoid mistakes that could ruin his life.  All I can say is that you may watch this movie and try to figure it out for itself.

Also, on the DVD I had to watch, for a long time in the middle of the movie there is a very annoying background chatter of some men talking.  At first, I thought it was a background radio in the scene, but it keeps going way beyond one scene.  I even took out the DVD and started over, but that chatter continued in that portion.  This, also, grades the movie down a grade.",1193443200,2,919,4.271676300578035
8192810,3,B000PMLJSA,"I was really hoping to discover an overlooked gem when I ordered this movie. Robert Loggia does his best to carry the film, but he's not given enough dialog or plot to support his histrionics. Craig T. Nelson delivers a most surprising turn as an indifferent father, and it was good to see John Amos again, even in a throwaway role with no meat to chew on. The youngsters are enthusiastic and sincere, but all in all it comes across as nothing more than a low-budget, lightweight TV movie that may end up best remembered as one of Loggia's final starring performances.",1185062400,,568,4.578431372549019
8192811,5,B000PMLJSA,"It was simply a great, heartwarming movie. If you want to feel really good, check it out. The writing was really well done, and the actors did a great job of bringing the story to life, especially the main character and his girlfriend.

This is one that can be enjoyed over and over again.",1184198400,8,289,4.351851851851852
