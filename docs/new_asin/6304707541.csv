musical piece. Just wish the bass were a little louder. It's great. It was fun watching Tim Roth play the keyboards. Very nice.
  The story is very interesting and keeps you waiting to see what happens next. The sound on the DVD is excellent. No regrets.
 Nope, none. Never seen Tupac before. He did a great job playing his part. I'm sorry he's gone. Get this and you'll have a lot of fun.",1404777600,,516,4.354166666666667
7875956,5,6304707541,"Before his untimely death, rapper-actor Tupac Shakur left behind a number of completed films in the can. The first to see the light of day is Gridlock'd, the energetic and enjoyable screenwriting and directing debut of actor Vondie Curtis-Hall (Broken Arrow, TV's Chicago Hope and Cop Rock).

After his girlfriend Cookie (Thandie Newton) falls into a drug-induced coma, heroin junkie Spoon (Shakur) decides to lay off the dope, forcing his comrade-in-blow Stretch (Tim Roth) to join him in detox. This simple decision sets off an exhausting chain of events where Stretch and Spoon run around town dealing with bureaucrats of varying rigidity and flee from a drug kingpin (Curtis-Hall) and the police, who suspect the two when a fellow drug fiend and his girlfriend are murdered.

Sounds like pretty heavy stuff, and sometimes it is. But like the big heroin-themed Trainspotting, the film is often quite funny, deftly walking the thin line between the harrowing and the hilarious. And the humor does not come out of nowhere and feel out of place; like life itself, comedy sometimes spring forth naturally from tragedy, with some inherent dark humor being found in what can be seen as the most serious of moments. But this is not to say that Curtis-Hall glosses over heroin addiction. Spoon and especially Stretch are seen for what they are--loser junkies--living in a dirty, cluttered apartment and getting into messes they could easily have avoided, often getting out through sheer luck alone (which results in some overly contrived moments). Curtis-Hall does add some interesting visual flair to the proceedings, using flashy editing and whatnot.

But even with Curtis-Hall's able efforts behind the camera, Gridlock'd could not have possibly worked without a convincing, charismatic lead duo, and Shakur and Roth fit the bill perfectly. Roth has the showier role, playing pathetic, dirty, and just plain wacky Stretch, and he pulls it off as well as one expects (even though his natural British accent sometimes slips into his on-screen New York accent). Shakur's more sensible Spoon is the straight man, but he is far from upstaged, holding his own with his confident, commanding presence; he truly had a bright future in film. Roth and Shakur's rapport is so natural, so effortless that you have no problem believing that they are longtime friends. It's too bad that a reteaming of the two is out of the question.

The pileup of films currently released amounts to one big traffic jam at movie houses, but the entertaining Gridlock'd should have had no problem clearing a path to box office success.

Rest in peace Tupac Shakur.",1142467200,7,2632,5.083333333333333
7875957,4,6304707541,"I have seen most of the films that Tupac acted in and I think this is easily his best performance, anyone who thinks he can't act should definetely watch this.  In fact it is credit to both Tupac and Tim Roth that I have given this film 4 stars as very little actually happens in the film, it is basically just a day in the life of two drug addicts, trying to kick the habit.

After their band member and shared lover has an overdose at the start of the film, the two main charaters run around town trying to get enrolled on a detox program.  Everywhere they go though they are prevented from doing so by various problems and they are given the run around all over town.  Meanwhile they unwittingly end up as the main suspects in a drug related murder, and they are also chased by drug dealers whose stash they unknowingly took.  By the end of the film the plot is cleverly linked together, and the film is at times very funny.

I would urge people to watch this film to see great performances by both Tim Roth and Tupac, and though there is little action in the film, their performances and a clever script make this an enjoyable film.",1133136000,4,1136,4.285046728971962
7875958,5,6304707541,"Tupac & Tim Roth plays very convincing as 2 drug-addicts trying to kick the habit.
Vondie Curtis Hall really should make more movies, couse all fits like a glove: the acting, camera-work, the editing, the score all are supreme.
The story is really good, and even people who aren't fans of Tupac can't deny that his acting isn't great, becouse it is.
I'll ADVICE EVERY MOVIE FAN TO WATCH THIS ONE",1074384000,,395,4.577464788732394

7875960,5,6304707541,"There's definitely a lotta film buffs who watch this movie and jus' look at it as a poor cousin of 'Trainspotting' and thas' really a shame, 'cause this is a great piece of work that truly stands on its own.  For one thing, the comparison to 'Trainspotting' is kinda unfair, 'cause while the two films are dealing with similar subject matters, they approach it in completely different manners, and, though I enjoy both movies, I prefer 'Gridlock'd' hands-down.  The performances are all outstanding, particularly the late Tupac Shakur, who here (as in all his movies) steals the show from even a veteran an' respected actor like Tim Roth.  This is a lost little gem of a film that, after five years, has sadly STILL yet to find a REAL audience outside'a die-hard Pac fanatics.

The movie plays like a black comedy.  It centers around two heroin addicts, Spoon an' Stretch, both of them burgeoning musicians who have a jazz trio with their other friend Cookie, played by Thandie Newton.  These three share an apartment together somewhere in the broken-down inner-city and spend most of their time playing nightclubs, havin' ""philosophical"" discussions about the Jerry Springer show, or shuffling around town, partying.  But then, one fateful New Year's Eve, after playing a gig Cookie overdoses, an' Spoon and Stretch desperately rush her to a hospital.  While she lies in a coma, and on life support, Spoon decides that its time for he an' Stretch to kick their drug habit.  Thus begins a very LONG day in which the two try everything in their power to find a rehab program for themselves.  But in a cruel an' unfeeling bureacracy, it seems like all the cards are against them.  They circle endlessly through a series of social-welfare agencies that almost seem to be deliberately plotting to keep them away from help: They find they can't get medicards without being on welfare, can't get into detox without filling out forms and waiting 10 days, can't get into a rehab center because it's only for alcoholics, can't get the right forms because an office has moved, can't turn in the forms because an office is about to close. And if that wasn't enough to drive them crazy, they've also been mistaken for the murderers in a drug-related double homicide, putting their faces on the 6 o'clock news as fugitives on the run. Daaayyyuumn! Jus' relayin' all that to y'all stresses ME out! So anyways with local cops closely in on their tail, as well as the real killers after them to reclaim 3 ounces of heroin that the two stole from the crime scene, Stretch an' Spoon are finding it harder and harder to get clean.

The two leads, Shakur and Roth, are the heart of the movie.  Their chemistry together is terrific, and their closer-than-two-brothers act is incredibly convincing.  Their dialogue together, whether they're cool an' relaxed, or frustrated an' angry, or filled with remorse an' regret over how they've lived their lives up until then, is always interesting.  They are real people caught up in the absurdity and unfairness of this life, which adds something I think 'Trainspotting' sometimes lacked: humanity an' compassion.  Writer-director Vondie-Curtis Hall wrote the screenplay and makes his directorial debut here.  He does a fine job, and seems to have a good handle on keeping the audience involved, without shutting them out by being overly-cynical in his depiction of street life and drug addicts.

I'd highly reccommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it.  If you are turned off by the grim-sounding material, believe me, you will be surprised at how human and fun it is.  There are several scenes in this movie that are absolutely hilarious, in which the resentful social workers blow up at the two from across the counter.  An ER nurse lets loose all her frustration an' anger at Spoon while making him fill out forms before they can admit Cookie into the hospital, and, in probably my favorite scene, a desk clerk at the department of welfare completely snaps: ""Yeah, we all been waiting for the day you come through that door and tell us you're ready not to be a drug addict. After five, ten years, you decide this is the day, and the whole f---in' world is supposed to stop!?""  Life is hard, the film tells us, and getting through it with all your marbles is the hardest part.  Abstract as it is, I think this movie gets the message across perfectly.",1015718400,20,4379,4.801597869507323
7875961,5,6304707541,"in most of pacs movies hes just one of the great actors in the movie.  he never really had to carry a movie, until gridlock'd.  he is one of the main two characters.  i think he gives his most memorable performance in this movie.  the movie is kinda sad if u look at it, about to heroin actics tryin to kick.  its a dope fiends ""friday""  the storyline isn't very compelling.  its just a feel good about fellin bad movie.  tim roth  also gives a very good performance.  i cant say enough about this movie.  for some reason this s** was very funny.  there is alot of humor and fun things about this movie.  get this to see pac bein a real down to earth touchable person.",1010448000,3,668,4.165354330708661
7875962,3,6304707541,"Imagine 'While You Were Sleeping' set in a milieu of junkies, gangstas and cops.  While their friend Cookie lies in emergency after a New Year's Eve overdose, musicians Spoon and Stretch decide to finally kick their habit.  However, they quickly get lost in a Kafkaesque urban labyrinth of bureaucracy, its servants blocking their good intentions with rules, paperwork and (admittedly justified) resentment; they also get caught in the fire of gang warfare, as two lethally relentless hitmen (one dubbed portentously 'the Reaper') try to retrieve 3 oz of heroine the scallies found on a murdered friend.
The air of unreality produced by cramming a fantastic amount of life-changing and -threatening incident into one (holi)day is underlined by the generally comic tone, in which events seem more frustrating than genuinely dangerous.  The situation of two wannabe-streetwise petty criminals forced to deal with the inanities of the welfare service is in itself funny.  But the possibility of their friend dying is an urgent one, as is their desire to change, reinforced by the flashbacks revealing a trio of musicians on the brink of a big time they are now close to throwing away (it is important, however, to note the idealising function of these flashbacks, a kind of lost golden age against which the nightmare present is compared).  The rapport between Tupac Shakur and Tim Roth is genuinely charming, not because they're super-funny or hyper-articulate like Tarantino characters, but because they're ordinary, likable blokes like most of us, down on their luck, with a poignant gap between their dreams and debilities, and an admirable, unexpected resourcefulness.
Comedy is one thing, though; it seems a bit of a cheat when the climax dissipates into cartoon, undoing the goodwill that helped the viewer overlook the lacklustre script and sometimes irritating visual tics.",1009929600,,1879,5.291946308724833
