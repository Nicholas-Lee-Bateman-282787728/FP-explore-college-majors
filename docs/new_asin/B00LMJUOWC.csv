6491588,5,B00LMJUOWC,"A lot of great ideas compressed into one film.  The first 20 minutes or so you might be a little bored, as not much happens, just character setup.  But what the film expresses as it unravels is really on-par with other sci-fi films like Moon.  Don't approach The Signal on a literal basis.  Look at it as a constant struggle between what a person should do (logic) and what they feel they must do (emotion).  If you view the entire film in that basis, then you will embrace every aspect of it.  Because everything in it comes down to logic/emotion.  Visually stunning, eerie, subtle, and memorable.  The two young guys in the film were superb, and Laurence Fishburne was great.

Also, don't watch the trailer, it gives too much away.  Just watch this film.",1407801600,3,756,4.574626865671642
6491589,3,B00LMJUOWC,"""Due to circumstances surrounding your condition I'm afraid our information is extremely limited."" Nic (Thwaites) and his friends are going on a road trip through the desert on the way to drop off his girlfriend. While on the road they find out they are being hacked and the signal is just off the road they are on. After debate they decide to check it out, but things aren't always as they seem. This is yet another movie where the idea is much cooler then the actual film. I'm not saying this is a bad movie but much like Transcendence I felt like they could have done a lot more with the idea. This starts out as a typical group of friends alone of the road movie but when they are taken to the area where the signal came from it starts to take on it's own identity. There are so many neat ideas that they come up with but nothing is ever as cool as they make it sound. When you watch you will see what I mean. In terms of sci-fi this isn't bad but the smaller budget seemed to hurt it a little because it ended up being a little too repetitive. The twist at the end is worth watching it for but don't expect anything super exciting until then. Overall, if you liked movies like District 9 or Under The Skin this this is something you would enjoy. I give it a B-.",1407369600,2,1266,4.150406504065041
6491590,4,B00LMJUOWC,"The Signal is a film that I wish I could like more than I do. The cast, director, cinematographer and composer--all did work of surprising originality, mastery,excellence...but

It contains the flaw of those brittle gems churned out by film school majors--every imaginable touch of technical brilliance is there but the screenplay just doesn't fully engage or sustain a viewer's interest or emotions.

The actors--save Laurence Fishburne who is as usual enigmatic, and as controlled as is humanly possible (and, in this particular instance, beyond humanly possible)--are all unknowns. These actors turn in a believable, if not engaging, performances.

The lone actress spends more time in a coma than anyone in recent history (This is perhaps a punishment for being an initiating cause for plot movement--the absence of which is the film's central flaw).

The two non-comatose males are unlikable. Why these three bright young folk are on their way cross country attempt to solve a mystery of who broke into a MIT mainframe is less likely than Nancy Drew solving a mystery in a fifteen minute coffee break in a night school adult keyboarding class.

The plot divides in three parts. Part One follows these young folks leaving MIT to travel to CIT.  The young woman travels westward for a year of nearly-abroad ( in joke) study.

Alas, she is also traveling with a recently crippled ex-lover. He is ill with something unspecified that might presage brilliance ala Stephen Hawking but he has a disability so  he can act like an ass but still not incur our judging him a jerk and as a plot device.

Why the girl is traveling with the ailing ex or why these three on the road take up an investigation best left to the feds or why she didn't just fly is never made clear.

Part One ends with a Blair Witchy sorta image-- all are transfixed by a tree lit by lightning or something more mysterious. This scene is noted a snarky manner because it is the single cheesy moment in an otherwise well edited movie.

Part Two, follows the Stephen Hawking sort of guy awakening, trying to figure out where he is and struggling to understand what has happened and what is really going on. After he finally awakens sufficiently, he gives a speech where he reveals both intelligence and every inconsistency in the movie's plot. He plans several escapes but is always stymied.

When he finally becomes aware of how easy escape might be, he breaks free of the facility. Why he so long missed an easy escape and why he is allowed to escape is never quite explained since those who are studying him seem to have absolute control to stop anything he attempts.

Part Three traces the escape as he, his recently awakened ex-girlfriend, and the other fellow who has been off screen reconnect and flee. The special effects budget kicks in here, action gets ramped up, and spectacles of superhuman abilities abound for reasons unclear.

I think I can reveal final merit of the movie but not spoil the ending for a viewer: where with Inception we longed to see a spinner topple; where with the Sixth Sense we wanted Willis to come to his final understanding, with The Signal, we get a God's eye view of the  hero's moment of understanding--and it is as vast and cold as space.

My pondering a grade will probably matched by your doubts should you see the movie.

Is it worth seeing?  Yes...! ...?...",1407283200,9,3370,4.751286449399657
6491591,3,B00LMJUOWC,"I really wanted to love this movie. The acting is good and visually it is very effective at eliciting the correct emotional response. I normally love this type of movie, but this one left me feeling disappointed. The premise is great, I loved it, but the writers could have done better in the execution.

6491592,4,B00LMJUOWC,"There has been a subtle trend in the past few years -- low-budget science fiction that doesn't actually look low-budget... or at least overcomes its limitations.

A good example: ""The Signal,"" a hauntingly creepy little sci-fi movie that builds up lots of tension to some genuinely shocking twists. While the slender budget is pretty obvious for much of the movie (hello, white corridors and rooms!), it finishes with a heartrending, action-packed finale, rich with metaphor and the clash between emotion and rational thought.

A mysterious hacker known as Nomad is sending MIT students Nick (Brenton Thwaites) and Jonah (Beau Knapp) bizarre emails. So the two decide that when they accompany Nick's girlfriend Haley (Olivia Cooke) to her new college in California, they will track down and confront Nomad. Nick is a little distracted, though -- he is crippled by muscular dystrophy, and believes that Haley would be better off without him.

But then Nick wakes up in a mysterious underground facility, run by strange people in Hazmat suits. Dr. William Damon (Laurence Fishburne) tells Nick that he had contact with an extraterrestrial creature -- Haley is in a coma, Jonah is supposedly dead, and Nick may be going insane.

But Nick begins to figure out that not everything around him is what it seems -- especially when he learns that bizarre modifications have been made to his body. His only chance is to grab the unconscious Haley and find a way out of the bizarre desert that they are lost in. But they have little idea of what is really going on -- or who Damon really is.

Director William Eubank apparently wanted ""The Signal"" to be kind of like a movie-length ""Twilight Zone"" episode, mingled with some Platonic philosophy and the eternal clash between the heart and the head. It sounds pretty dry, but he manages to meld these things effectively, with lots of tension and haunting buildup to the big sci-fi twists -- as well as a finale that is all about surrendering to love.

He also keeps shifting from one setting to the next, abruptly unsettling the viewer with one eerie, blank space after another -- be it the sun-blasted desert filled with insane people, or an eerie white space populated by sterile, slow-moving people who hardly ever speak. And for a movie whose budget was a measly two million, the special effects are lovely -- this is the kind of CGI that a new generation of filmmakers are taking advantage of, in conjunction with glittering warehouse sets and bulky prosthetics.

The downside? You can kind of see the ultimate twist coming if you pay attention... and can spell. And while some questions left unanswered are good, there are just a few too many here. What's up with Mirabelle and the trucker?

But it does have some very good acting -- Thwaites is absolutely mesmerizing here, as a young man who is constantly thwarted and frustrated in his efforts to just RUN (both literally and metaphorically). His heavy brows and piercing eyes give Nick the intensity that an intelligent, driven young man needs to have to escape all this. Cooke doesn't do much except sleep, while Knapp has a brief, powerful role as Nic's best buddy.

And Fishburne? He gives a beautifully subtle performance here. It's not clear what's going on with this guy until the final moments of the movie, but you can see flickers of it in his overjoyed reaction to Nic's intelligence and cunning.

""The Signal"" is a twisty, slow-moving little science-fiction movie that relies on the heart as well as the head. Although it leaves a few too many questions unanswered, it's proof that clever sci-fi doesn't need a blockbuster budget.",1407024000,60,3639,4.87378640776699
6491593,4,B00LMJUOWC,"Despite how horrible The Quiet Ones was, and how I honestly thought it would turn me off from watching Olivia Cooke in any movie she was in, the inclusion of Laurence Fishburne made me think this movie was worth giving a chance. After all, as noted in my Transcendence review, there aren't a lot of sci-fi films which aren't comic book adaptations, or based off cartoons from the 80s and 90s. So I walked in hoping Olivia Cookes name wasn't as bad of a sign as Johnny Depp without Tim Burton.

Characters & Story
Two MIT students, Nic (Brenton Thwaites) and Jonah (Beau Knapp), are on their way to California for Nics girlfriend Haley (Olivia Cooke) is going to be there for a year and they wanted to join her for the road trip. But, as much as they want to send Haley off they want to also track down this hacker named Nomad who damn near ruined their life. Leading to a series of events in which the three of them find themselves face to face with Damon (Laurence Fishburne) who is a man in a contamination suit within what looks like a secret government facility. One which our protagonist are kept in the dark about everything and are forced to try to escape from this world they have been transported to.

Praise
To me, The Signal feels like a really good SyFy movie if they weren't obsessed with animal hybrids. It has a nice mystery element to it, utilizes technology in a basic way and yet doesnt look cheap and, in a good way, you are left wishing there was more to the story. For I feel the film just gives you enough to get the idea of what they want you to know, the story they want to portray, and it builds the characters up just enough for you to care about their fate.

Like with Nic and Haley. They give you just enough background on them as a couple to make you hope that in the end everything will be alright and despite whatever Nic is going through, they will remain the cute couple they seem. As for Jonah, I must admit I didn't give a damn about him until after Damon is introduced and he sort of reinvented, or just finally defined, his character.

And as for the story as a whole, it comes in three parts and in each part I feel it tries to mix sci-fi with other genres to help keep you on your toes a bit. For the first part where we meet everyone it has a mix of coming-of-age story and then a little bit of The Blair Witch Project as they investigate where they think Nomad is. Then, upon a certain event, it becomes a sci-fi with a mystery element and you are trying to fully understand the who, what, and where of the situation. Leading to the final part where it becomes similar to an action movie and ends in a way I won't say is perfect, but good enough to make you want more.

Criticism
The only real criticism I have when it comes to this movie is how underdeveloped Cookes character Haley is. Her character doesnt evolve much past being Nics girlfriend, and as Jonah and Nic go through these really cool changes, Haley doesnt evolve with them. If anything, she devolves to becoming the damsel in distress who has some moxy, but not enough to be considered on par with the boys. Outside of that though, recognizing this is a low budget film, I don't see any other major issues.

Overall: TV Viewing (Rental)

As can be seen by looking through my archives, I seek out indie movies which aren't necessarily on everyones radar. Something which often leads to me finding films which justifiably are not well known, and films like this which may not be mind-blowing, but certainly are worth seeing. For, as said, The Signal comes off like a good SyFy original movie and truly makes me feel that if Olivia Cooke is really going to damn her career and become the go to girl for sci-fi films or mysteries, then she is better off in films like this where at least the story is interesting. Especially since there is a true air of mystery which actually makes you want to explore what may or may not be happening, as opposed to you wondering when the film will be over for you figured out all that was going to happen within the first half hour.",1406419200,9,4070,4.333333333333333
6491594,4,B00LMJUOWC,"This enigmatic Sci-Fi was submitted by the US to the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival. We follow a trio of college students into the desert after they are challenged by mysterious hacker.

This first threatened to be 97 minutes of ""Don't Go In The Basement!"" but it soon settled into a little more involving head-scratcher.

The cast:
  * Brendon Thwaites (""Maleficent"") is Nik, who starts out using crutches. Flashbacks show us how that happened. He is uncommonly smart and as a grad student from MIT, he accepts the challenge.
  * Olivia Cooke (""Bates Motel"") is Haley, who mostly seems to be set decoration. Nik loves her...
  * Beau Knapp (""Super 8"") is Jonah, Nik's friend, roommate and probably classmate. He too, is uncommonly smart.
  * Laurence Fishburne (""Man of Steel"") is Dr. Wallace Damon, an imperturbable fellow bundled in a hazmat suit, because our hero is ascertained to be ""EBE"" or ""Extraterrestrial Biological Entity.""

This turns into a white-knuckle ride and I was surprised how engaged I had become. I think it helps that the lead guy is such a handsome devil! The DVD from Amazon will probably have closed captions, that will help a LOT!",1406160000,4,1168,4.908163265306122
6491595,4,B00LMJUOWC,"I understand i cannot say anything about the blu-ray since it hasn't been released yet, but i can talk about the movie.

The Signal, co-written and directed by William Eubank (Angels & Airwaves' Love), tells the story of three friends on a road trip to California who are also tracking a hacker named NOMAD, who nearly got them expelled from MIT. But, when they track him down to the middle of nowhere in Nevada, the three are separated and attacked by an unseen force. When Nick (Brendan Thwaites) wakes up in a facility being questioned by a man, Dr. Wallace Damon, Nick does whatever he can to escape the facility and find his friends.

The Signal is a very under-appreciated sci-fi thriller, and i honestly don't know why. Mr. Eubank's direction is truly superb, and is a kind-of mix between Stanley Kubrick, Chris Carter, and even Christopher Nolan or Wally Pfister. The way he captures in-your-face moments, as well as beautifully intense, slow-motion action scenes is just incredible (Michael Bay, take notes). The script, while not the best part of the film, is still wonderful in its own way. The non-linear story-telling (if you ask me) works best for the film, how at pivotal moments for the characters we see flashbacks that represent an old and current obstacle, or simply cherished moments long past. Plus, the characters seemed like real people, real college students in over their heads. While i loved Brendan Thwaites as Nick, it was Beau Knapp as Jonah who stole the show towards the end, with his tear-jerking performance as the best friend. The visual effects were spectacular, and make me think of District 9, and how it had a huge impact inspiring other lower budgeted films that boast brilliant effects with masterful story-telling. The acting was good overall, but no award-winners. Laurence Fishburne deserves a shout-out for his creepy portrayal of Damon, a really strange and somewhat sinister 'man behind the curtain' who knows more than he's letting on. The musical score by Nima Fakhrara is good and minimalist, adding to the tense and eerie atmosphere of the film. The cinematography is very gorgeous, especially considering it's shot in New Mexico and in the same places Breaking Bad was shot. Then, there's the story. I'll agree with some people in that there are unresolved plot points and plot holes, but they're reasonable. In fact, the ending (which i absolutely love, very Twilight Zone) leaves the door open for a sequel, and a massive sequel at that if it's pursued, which i hope it is.

The Signal is a mostly impressive SF tale that favors beautiful filmmaking over story-telling, but does not sacrifice good story-telling for visual splendor. A must-see for hardcore sci-fi fans, but not recommended to those who aren't big on sci-fi. Let's just say, if you liked District 9 and/or Moon, you'll like this.",1405900800,156,2848,4.929166666666666

6491610,5,B00LMJUOWC,"Sometimes, I buy movies for the great writing/acting. Sometimes, I buy movies I think will be cult hits in the future. Sometimes, I purchase a movie because of the atmosphere alone, regardless of the story. This is the third one. It has a very surreal atmosphere that feels abstract-ish but doesn't become too disconnected (at least not to me). Springer Rider was dead-on about the comparison (""if you like movies like The 13th Floor...""). That's so accurate. -and yes, I do :)

This is a quiet, almost ambient-feeling movie so it kind of pulls you in and quiets the mind. You will get more out of it if you're not distracted or in a room with lots going on. The soundtrack is mostly minimalist which only added to the ambience, feeling pleasant. For me, at least, there was a slight creepiness to it, even some parts making me a little sick. I'm a seasoned sensation-seeker so I liked that. I was glued throughout the entire movie, leaning forward, forgetting the world around me. I feel like this movie will be later dubbed underrated, maybe in about a decade. It's a decent science fiction. It has a simple but still engaging plot.

Added comparison: Back in 2005, I was prescribed triciclic antidepressants (Remeron) and it gave me these insanely detailed, vivid, slightly terrifying sci-fi dreams (almost all incorporating some kind of way-too-advanced technology). This movie reminds me of those.

The movie hits too close to home, with me so I'm biased. If you are on the fence, though, just rent it and check it out. See if you like it. Maybe you will, maybe you won't but definitely give it a watch.",1518480000,10,1608,4.715302491103203

Laurence was all Morpheus and what-not, which means his acting skills have gone with the wind.  I swear I thought he was going to ask the kid with the alien legs if he was happy with his pill choice.  ""Did you find what you were looking for?"" Really.

The first hour or so of the film is effective and makes for compelling viewing as Eubank succeeds in building tension, unease, and mystery. The performances, from a mostly unknown cast, are uniformly good as are the low-budget effects. But then, in the later stages, the plot begins to unravel. The story suddenly becomes muddled and the final reveal, even if it takes you by surprise, is disappointingly mundane. (The rather ho-hum ending also calls into question everything that has gone before, much of which suddenly makes little sense.)

6491681,4,B00LMJUOWC,"A good movie! I was worried it was going to go the art house/indie route and be confusing and while pretty to watch, not give the viewer any real answers. It did give answers, in fact pretty much everything is answered right at one of the best endings of any science fiction movie I have seen in some time.

The movie starts off - having seen the trailers - as a completely different movie almost. We meet three friends traveling across country, friend Jonah and hacker friend Nic along with Nic's girlfriend Haley, all helping Haley move from MIT to a university in California. Johah and Nic are obsessed with a powerful and cryptic hacker called Nomad, who they track down to a very, very rural area of Nevada. More or less along the route they take, the three end up investigating, hoping to confront Nomad in person.

Until they reach the place where their GPS coordinates lead them to Nomad, the film (a few creepy overtones of the hacker skills of Nomad aside), feels like a beautiful shot indie film, with gorgeous light, beautiful skies, a long road trip through farmland and forest and desert, the three of them dealing (or not dealing) with Haley leaving their lives for a year and Nic coming to terms with an illness that in the future will put him possibly in a wheel chair and how he views that changing (or ending) his relationship with Haley.

Once they get to the strange home in the desert where Nomad supposedly lives, it gets a bit of a horror movie vibe, with lowlight cameras revealing a strange house, cryptic house hold items, but no sign of Nomad. Quickly things get worse, as Nic and Jonah, in the basement (!; not a place I want to be in a such setting), hear Haley screaming...and it gets strange from there, with Nic waking up in some sort of secure government facility, surrounded by people in contamination suits, the only one that talks to Nic being Jonah (with a wonderful calm and soothing voice).

I don't want to give anything more away, but it was a good and original science fiction film. I liked the flashbacks to the life Nic had before the events of this film, the time before the encounter grounded the characters (though not entirely sure the trajectory of Nic's and Haley's relationship really played out post encounter), and the effects (especially the slow motion photography) were good.",1474588800,,2332,4.625603864734299

6491683,3,B00LMJUOWC,"I am a bit disappointed in this film's plot which seems like two college boys obsessed with tracking down a computer hacker and confronting him personally.  It appeared that their female companion, whom they were accompanying to some Wets Coast college, had more common sense.  The rolling of her eyes several times as the two boys plot the course of their obsession should point this out.  Of course they all eventually get their comeuppance when they encounter ""The Signal"" and the plot takes an almost 90 degree turn.  Without spoiling the ending, I would say it leaves you wondering about entire intention of the proceedings of the plot.  I had a lot of unanswered questions even after viewing this film a second.  Googling the film's plot will not help.  As Science Fiction films go there are better to be viewed like the Maze Runner or The Giver.",1472860800,,852,4.755102040816326

6491690,3,B00LMJUOWC,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of The Signal.

BLU-RAY DISC: The quality of the blu-ray disc is excellent as to be expected for a modern science fiction movie.

EXTRA'S: There are lots of extra's. For starter's there is a director commentary. There is a featurette called ""Behind The Signal."" There are deleted scenes and alternate scenes.

PLOT/SYNOPSIS: I'll keep this brief because if you go into any kind of detail then their will be lots of spoilers.

A small group of friends, two teen boys and a teen girl decide to take a cross country trip. Nic has a deteriorating condition that is taking away his ability to walk. His girlfriend, Haley is going away to school for a year. Together with their friend Jonah, they decide to drive her to school. They start receiving messages from a mysterious hacker and decide to go investigate the source of the signals while on their road trip. That's about as far as I can go without giving away all sorts of stuff about the plot.

IMPRESSIONS: This movie shows influences from several good sci-fi movies of the past. Among them are 'The Matrix' and 'Dark City' along with found footage movies and take your pick of 'contagion' movies; and alien abduction movies. The main problem with this movie is that it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. You will get a resolution to the main story arc but you will not get answers to a lot of other plot points which I find frustrating. This could have been an excellent movie. For the budget, they did a tremendous job, especially with the special effects.

Ultimately, I can only give it 3 stars because of the failure of the writers and director to put together a more coherent story.

Recommended for all sci-fi fans. Even though I only give it 3 stars it is an interesting movie and worth a watch.",1463011200,,1797,4.596875
6491691,4,B00LMJUOWC,"It's a low-budget sci-fi puzzle, a little bit reminiscent of Cronenberg's creepy style. The acting is good, and overall I found it worth watching.

6491692,2,B00LMJUOWC,"The movie has some absolutely stellar scenes of slow-motion visual grandeur as well as a hefty emotional element to the narrative.

Unfortunately, several flashbacks are never explained (thus feel completely unnecessary) and worst of all, the ending is atrocious. The movie is completely serious until this parody of a climax delivers terrible dubstep and a lame twist that completely negates the sincere tone/atmosphere of everything that came before it. Leave that crap in the club where it belongs.",1462579200,,501,5.423076923076923
6491693,5,B00LMJUOWC,"William Eubank's The Signal is ultimately a lot less unusual than it appears. The story of three hackers whose cross country road trip is interrupted by mysterious forces is captivating for a long stretch, though, keeping viewers guessing about the nature of what has happened to these sympathetic youths.
Nic and Jonah (Brenton Thwaites, Beau Knapp) are MIT students engaged in an online altercation with someone called Nomad, who recently found his way onto their network and destroyed some servers. Though they're currently driving Nic's girlfriend Haley (Olivia Cooke) from Cambridge to Caltech, where she's transferring for a year, they get a lead on Nomad's whereabouts and persuade her to take a detour into the desert.
In a scene that plays like a horror film, the three find an abandoned shack with telltale signs of recent habitation. Before they can put clues together, though, strange things start to happen. We see Haley pulled up into the air, alien-abduction-style, and everyone loses consciousness. Nic awakes in what seems to be a secret hospital, unable to feel his legs and tended to by silent workers in hazmat suits.
A Dr. Wallace Damon (Laurence Fishburne) attempts to address his disorientation and anxiety, but is clearly holding things back. He will say, though, that the friends have encountered an EBE (that's ""extraterrestrial biological entity,"" for people who think an ""ET"" isn't understood to be biological), that it's very dangerous outside this facility, and that all this secrecy is maintained for a good reason.
Like us, Nic doesn't buy it, and he's impatient with being observed in a locked room while Damon rations out information. So he MacGyvers himself some escape strategies and starts moving this film away from less-is-more territory, toward something closer to action mode. Without giving the story's sometimes confusing surprises away, one can say that the film breaks free of the hospital, with Damon and company chasing Nic while he struggles to make sense of what he sees and to understand why his friends, with whom he reconnects, are behaving like whacked-out shadows of themselves.
There are golden moments during this mystery of transporting weirdness. Lin Shaye has a brief, standout appearance as a religious woman who hears noises in the sky and has lost her grasp on everyday idioms. And David Lanzenberg's cinematography is eye-pleasing even while we're trapped in bunker-like quarantine.
Throughout the third act, though, the cat-and-mouse game grows more conventional. You might start to suspect the film is a little less trippy than it seemed; that whatever big revelation awaits us may be inadequate to explain the action leading to it but one that will let you draw your own conclusions and still want more.",1462492800,,2769,5.183035714285714

6491699,1,B00LMJUOWC,"HOW SURPRISING that The Signal actually has good photography. Yet given the content, the photography doesn't matter. In fact, it's quite pointless, along with the rest of the production. This a picture that never leaves the exposition phase. Apparently someone had an idea for a situation, but never developed the idea before shooting began. I'm surprised at how many films have this flaw, and it seems like a trend. Other examples are Mr. Holmes, Gravity, and Mr. Nobody.

THE PROBLEM is particularly frequent in science fiction movies: As if science fiction automatically contributes sympathetic characters and a credible, compelling plot. But there's no science to that, and no fiction, either. Typically of this pseudo-genre, The Signal provides weak characters and snaps them into pre-fab ""episodes."" The relationship between these ""episodes"" is very weak, almost spurious. Editing would have been easy, because the ""episodes"" could be in any order. The plot, so much as we can say there is one, is all filler.

Spoiler Territory

The plot of this train wreck, is convoluted at worst and counterproductive at best. Each of the three teenage leads is infuriatingly intolerable, and you will be rooting for the ""bad guys"" the whole time. I will leave ""bad guys"" in quotes, for that gets into the convoluted plot territory.

You start off with the three teenage friends headed off to California to drop the girl off at college. She has a name, but spends the whole movie passed out, wandering off, looking sad, and sleeping. When the two boys get alien super powers, she does not, and adds literally nothing to the plot. She is simply there to motivate her boyfriend into saving her. A job that could have easily been replaced by the other male character who disappears right after they are abducted, and comes back right as they are about to escape. She literally serves no purpose, it is infuriating.

So our three ""heroes"" are abducted, and taken to an apparently secret underground facility. Our main character is unbelievably insufferable towards those who are trying to help him, and attempts to escape right from the get go. Even though they have told him he is infected by the aliens who abducted him, and he has seen the black tar goo come right out of his own damn face, and the inhuman rashes that appear on his body. If his disrespectful attitude was not off putting enough, his blatant disregard for literally everyone but his friends is exasperating. His selfishness has you cheering for him to get blasted away, every time he opens his mouth, and with every poor decision he makes along the way.

As our ""heroes"" are escaping, the scientists who were keeping them contained head off to get them, picking up the two ""civilians"" the ""heroes"" have met along the way. Both of these people get blasted away. Which would be fine seeing as they too start leaking black goo from their face holes, and are obviously infected; but the issue lies with the last five minutes of the movie. As the main guy makes a desperate, and hilarious attempt at saving his girlfriend, in the most over the top and laughable CGI I've ever seen, we find out that - surprise surprise - they were on the alien spaceship the whole time! Shamalamadingdong plot twist!... Why did the scientist kill those guys? They were in a completely controlled test the whole time, why even have any humans there at all. Both of them were beyond odd, and were literally the only people around. Keeping them there to have it seem ""authentic"" is ridiculous as both characters are such caricatures of real people anyway, a robot (which seemingly everyone else in the test is, with absolutely zero unbeilevablilty) would have been just as good. It is all so stupid. And for what end? To give selfish kids super human powers? Why? Because they are smart? Because they could hack MIT? Because they went looking?

Just don't even bother. Even if you can watch it for free, don't. Anything but Eragon is better than this piece of crap.",1449187200,2,3122,4.646739130434782

This isn't some kind of sprawling mythology and monster space western. It's a claustrophobic set piece that hones way in on the most basic questions, the fundamental what-ifs. Recommend if you like Asimov and Vonnegut, possibly Philip K. Dick (would depend on why you like him and more on this would spoil).

6491722,3,B00LMJUOWC,"The blurb on the dust jacket of this Blu-Ray/DVD isn't too helpful.  This is an independent sci-fi film by Focus Features, shown at Sundance Film Festival in 2014.  Laurence Fishburn, as a researcher dressed in what looks like a hybrid space suit/hazmat suit, is the big-name actor here but not the lead character.  The 3 major characters weren't known to me: Brenton Thwaits as Nic, Olivia Cook as his girlfriend Haley and Beau Knapp as Brenton's best friend Jonah.  As the film begins, they (Nic and Jonah) are taking Haley across country to go live with her family for a while.  Haley seems to be fed up with Nic's paying more attention to his computer than to her.  Nic and Jonah, the film makes clear early on, are computer hackers who were accused of hacking into MIT's network.  They then get a message from ""Nomad"" that it was he who hacked the system and diverted the blame onto them.  This immediately throws them into a frenzy of efforts to track down the physical location of Nomad's email; the one location they can pinpoint is only a couple hours off their intended course driving Haley home, so of course they divert in that direction.

This leads to phase 2 of the film: they end up in a deserted, ramshackle house on a dirt road in the middle of the night.  It starts looking reminiscent of a low-grade horror film.  Exploring the house they hear a scream from Haley (who was waiting for them in the car), run out, are surrounded by brilliant white light and lose consciousness.

This leads to phase 3 and the bulk of the film, in which Nic awakes in a modern-looking research sort of facility and is being asked questions by Fishburne, dressed in his hazmat suit.  Nic has plenty of questions of his own, but Fishburne either doesn't answer them or gives answers that seem dodgy.  Nic notices he has been tattooed on the wrist with the numbers 2,3,5,41.

When alone in a holding cell Nic hears Jonah talking to him through an air duct.  Jonah asks if Nic has a tattoo like he does, and when Nic says yes, Jonah says he's figured out the meaning: it is not a personal ID but an area location: the digits add up to 51 and they apparently drove right into area 51.  Things continue to get progressively more weird from there until the end of the movie, which reveals what actually happened to them (to those clever enough and quick enough to take in a brief scene and make sense of it)

Reading comments made by the writers/director, they compare aspects of this film to the Twilight Series, The Wizard of Oz, Plato's allegory of the cave, rational vs. emotional decision-making and what role emotion might play if we become super-intelligent in the way posited by computer artificial intelligence.

I was disappointed that there wasn't more discussion of the concepts behind the film in the special features on the Blu-ray disc.  In fact I found the special features pretty much worthless.  I also thought the movie was a very long way to go to reach an ending that, to me, seemed a bit of a disappointment.  I see the many reviewers are all over the map on how to score this film: fairly well distributed between 1 and 5.  I definitely did not feel it was anywhere near the most interesting sci-fi film I've seen in the last year or two but I am leaving out the majority of the plot details, to avoid spoilers for anyone who wants to see the whole thing.",1444176000,6,3371,4.517298187808896

I both loved and hated it as I watched it, but in the end it was just too bizarre to recommend.  Amazing effects for an indie. The acting was excellent, and it, combined with skillful editing (both visual and sound) offered all the impact without deafening us and numbing us to the nuances of a complicated and at times hard to follow story.  Together they made the unbelievable believable.  For that I gave it five stars. I always enjoy Lawrence Fishburne's ability and addition to any story.

People sometimes say, There is a great movie buried somewhere in this. Thats what I thought after seeing The Signal, a thriller that could have been much better with tighter and more focused writing. It tries to cover such territories as mystery and willpower, but, though the process leading up to the climax is intriguing, what follows is rather disappointing.

After all, the basic idea about the doctor and his team is nothing original.

Indeed, If you combined EYES WIDE SHUT with TWIN PEAKS, this is what you might get - a lot of promise, a lot of confusion, a lot of misdirected clues, a lot of actual clues providing that you freeze-framed the DVD, took out a magnifying glass, and were familiar with 1950s sci-fi movies, a surprise ending that still left too many questions unanswered, and a feeling that they made it up as they went along.

Best of all, imagine those space aliens have a particular fondness for ersatz sci-fi in which various plot elements don't actually add up if you pause for more than 1 nanosecond to think about it.

6491891,5,B00LMJUOWC,"I TOTALLY get why you wouldn't like - or even HATE, The Signal, even though I don't myself. Then again, I AM the target demographic: the kind of guy who loves twisty, confusing, bizarre, ambitious sci-fi with human emotion and gorgeous technical wizardry thrown into the mix. If you're a fan of those, then by all accounts pick up a copy of The Signal, because this film delivers on all those accounts.
But If you're a fan of straightforward, logical, tightly plotted, tidy films that put themselves on a plate for your consumption, run like the hills. The Signal doesn't so much as make itself a hard meal, as force the viewer to wrangle a wild, kicking animal into their system (excuse the metaphor). So once more: DISCLAIMER. If you like fast-paced, easily understood films for entertainment and easy-watching, look for another film. The Signal isn't so much your cup of tea as a completely different beverage (think...orange juice).

But if you like smart, thought-provoking, visually stunning, powerfully acted, mind-bending and stylish science fiction with a twist and a kick, then The Signal is by all accounts, a rewarding experience. The story centers on three brilliant young people who encounter a mysterious and sinister alien entity in the Nevada desert, and their subsequent experience with a bizarre government research facility with its own dark secrets. Leading the film is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brenton-Thwaites/dp/B00Q4F7HGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brenton Thwaites</a>, an Aussie newcomer who is coming out of nowhere to become a huge talent to watch. His intense performance as brilliant young hacker Nick carries the entire film, delivering some real gravitas and drama.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Olivia-Cooke/dp/B00M8KHJNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Olivia Cooke</a>&nbsp;is excellent as strong, smart girlfriend Haley, while Beau Knapp will break your heart as fellow hacker Jonah.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laurence-Fishburne/dp/B0094K35S6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laurence Fishburne</a>&nbsp;is a real pleasure as the creepily secretive Dr. Wallace Damon.

Director William Eubank has a brilliant grasp of space and visual clarity, and The Signal has a stylish and gorgeous visual palette. The imagery is bold and strange, the camera intimate and epic. The special effects are amazing, there's some impressive CGI and awe-inspiring slo-motion action scenes thrown into the mix. The writing of course, is where the film is weakest. Yes, the film's conclusion could have been sharper, and the middle half could have been tighter. And is it too much to ask that we get some ANSWERS? The Signal says nope. Use your brain and think. You'll be pondering this movie and its outrageous themes for days. Aliens, androids, signals, hackers, and bodily modifications will be running through your head like a parade. Throw in some beautiful editing and a moody, cool score...and you have a slow-burning, suspenseful, ambitious, even arresting film with some hard science fiction and some moving human drama thrown in there.

Trust me, if you think you can handle The Signal, you should check it out. 4.5 signals out of 5! Cheers!",1420329600,5,3299,5.86875

Nice Break from the overused formula of quiet scenes interrupted by senseless loud noises.

Cons:
Classic horror movie syndrome. Nobody acts like, says things or makes decisions that are even remotely believable behaviors.
Not much science or movie physics but just ruins the little bit there is. The realisticness of some scenes made me wonder if this movie was targeted at 10 year olds.

Even knowing that much, nothing else made any sense whatsoever and even if it did, who would care? The slow as hell moments which were entirely insignificant...like people who do slow claps in comedies for no reason just to make fun of slow claps. (idiots) *spoilers follow.........*
Then I didn't understand why they were given new body parts, especially Jonas or why they wouldn't explain anything to them at all. They clearly wanted them to assimilate and not freak out yet the stupid ass aliens made the humans freak out by scaring the s*** out of them. This movie was so stupid that I HATE it and wish I could get that wasted time in my life back. Hey - screen writer - you suck. Thanks for nothing. What a waste.

I suspect that is why the contrast between the 5 star reviews and the 1 star reviews. If you're looking for easy answers and a simple straight forward story line this isn't the movie for you. Another thing I liked about the Signal is it started out feeling like a road movie, three college students travelling across the country and two of them are obviously a couple coming to some sort of crossroad in their relationship all the while trying to find some hacker called the Nomad. After they find the Nomads hideout in the dark nothing is ever the same. Even when you think you know what is going on you never really do. I was also pleasantly surprised at how good the acting was by three actors I have never heard of or seen. As usual Laurence Fishborne is excellent and creepy.

Laurence Fishborne...the man is an acting ace. You never understood his characters motives or thinking until the very end...well done.

The General Premise...its a good 'what if' but do to slowness and plot holes (who takes that long to look at their legs!) It fizzles out.

The Signal is a little slower pace than a lot of mainstream cinema, but if you're open to that category of film-making, you won't be disappointed. It started fine, progressed fine, and had a pretty good ending.

It wasn't a perfect story, there were things we saw coming, but how often are movies literally 'unpredictable'? (And for that matter, how many times do we criticize movies for going in directions contrary to what we thought appropriate? - A little predictability is probably a good thing, meaning it unfolds appropriately.)

I kept hoping that the twist would turn out the way I predicted, but the actual ""twist"" wasn't as great as the one I imagined.

It draws on elements from Cube, Animatrix and Akira.  It's executed nicely enough, great footage, nice style.  It's pretty aimless and drawn out through most of the film, but I could tolerate it as it kept on building to the big question, what is going on here?

Well, I'll just stop here and say that there is an ending, and there is an answer, but it might as well have not ended at all,  the end of the movie is a total joke to to anyone to sits through this film.  Seriously it makes you feel like a big idiot and you can practically hear them laughing at you.  Even the soundtrack towards the very end of the film, which was all serious and gripping, turns into some kind of circus like theme.  You might as well have seen the movie cast yell out ""SURPRISE! it's just a film you dummy!""  Just a bit of fun.

6492090,5,B00LMJUOWC,"I'm glad I ended up ignoring the poor reviews because they couldn't be more wrong. This was a really interesting, intelligent and original sci-fi movie. I honestly have no idea why so many reviewers are confused since everything is explained quite clearly in the end. Yes, it keeps you guessing because the big reveal doesn't happen until the last minute or so, but if you're in ""a fog"" the whole time then you aren't paying much attention to what's going on. I'd explain the plot, but that would ruin the fun. (And yes, part of the fun is NOT knowing everything until the end.)

All I'll give away is that the three friends are subjects in an experiment - that should be pretty obvious to anyone from an early point in the movie. Just what the experiment is and who is performing it is what you have to wait until the end to find out. But it's not like it's some mysterious arthouse flick with pretty shots of landscapes that don't mean anything. The movie gives you one puzzle piece after another and it's not until you have all the pieces that you see the big picture. The plot makes sense, the pacing is good and it's shot beautifully.

If you get impatient when you have to wait for answers, like to be spoon fed everything and/or need to see things blowing up all the time then avoid this. (Not that there is no action, but it comes late.) If you like intelligent sci-fi, then you'll like this.

Film makers aren't stupid, they are story tellers and they are crafting their message for an agenda.

No Spoilerswell maybe a couple minor.

SoIt was a good movie but highly flawed. It kept my attention which for me is a rarity. Reminded me of Primer same kind of pacing and weirdness. Maybe a film student attempt at worst.

Problems are not in the story per se but the pacing and character development. it was difficult to identify with any of the main characters. One spends much of the film trying to stay awake and one wonders if it was part of the script or because of the script!

Too much time is spent as filler, several scenes seem repeated to tediousness but they do build suspense.

As for the good; it does keep you thinking. I'd figured out much of it early on but was still rewarded with some surprises.

Don't expect a masterpiece. Be prepared for a rather slow developing film but it has a couple freaky scenes that wake ya up. It reads like a who-done-it and invites you to try to stay one step ahead of the plot. So it requires attention.

For those who like their science fiction from Sundance rather than Michael Bay, this little $4 million film might just be your ticket.  Directed by a former cameraman, William Eubank (also co-wrote with his brother Carlyle and David Frigerio) tells the story of a trio on a cross country trip.  Nic (Brenton Thwaites, ""The Giver"") is a student at MIT.  His girlfriend, Haley (Olivia Cooke, ""Ouija"") is transferring to Cal Tech.  Nic is not too happy about it, but is helping her move.  Their best friend, Jonah (Beau Knapp, ""Super 8"") is along for the ride.

All 3 students are in a bit of hot water with their university due to a hacker called Nomad.  He had broken into the school's computer system and left evidence that our trio is responsible.  Along the way, they discover that Nomad has also been tracking them.  They trace the signal to a small town in the Nevada desert and decide to confront him.  About this time, things get a little creepy.  Rather than find him in daylight, they decide to do it in the middle of the night and manage to locate a dilapidated trailer in the middle of nowhere.  This tired horror-styled clich seemed out of place in this film.  In any case, loud noises ensue and the film goes to black.

When Nic awakens, he discovers himself in a sterile, isolation unit.  He's not hurt but is clearly confused as to why he is there.  He's met by the man in charge, known as Damon (Laurence Fishburne) who has more questions of Nic than answers for him.  Nic is only partially ambulatory due to an earlier accident referenced only in flashback, but manages to find Haley in a coma.  Damon and the entire staff are shrouded in yellow hazmat suits with the suggestion that Nic and Haley have been exposed to some nefarious biological agent.  Nic isn't buying any of it and manages to escape with Haley literally in tow.  The chase is on, which ultimately leads to the big reveal.

As a viewer, Eubank keeps us guessing as to what's going on.  And while it may be a surprise, it isn't unexpected.  Eubanks film reminds me somewhat of the work of Shane Carruth (""Primer"" and ""Upstream Color"").  If anything, Eubanks and his co-writers might have put a little more effort in the relationships, especially between Nic and Haley.  There just isn't much chemistry there and it's mostly because the words aren't.  Still, I have to recommend the movie, especially to those who can't get enough sci-fi.

The Blu ray disc is excellent.  The video comes with a 1080p resolution and a wide 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The bleak landscapes and sets are perfectly presented.  The colors and skin-tones are honest and natural.  Detail is crisp and black levels are excellent.  I could see no anomalies or transfer irregularities.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is also excellent.  Dialog is clear and properly focused upfront.  This isn't a film fully of explosions and other ear popping sound.  But the film does get a bit loud at times thanks to an effective score by Nima Fakhrara.  Sound effects are often subtle with desert ambiance and medical lab movement.  No complaints.  Extras are limited to a 10 minute ""making of"" piece, some deleted and alternate scenes, a blooper and a few trailers.  Subtitles are available in English, Spanish and French.",1414800000,,3285,4.70298769771529

It is a movie worth watching, but if you're looking for something in the same vein that is far superior, I recommend The director's previous film ""Love,"" which is inexplicably unavailable on DVD or Blu-Ray.

6492187,3,B00LMJUOWC,"""The Signal"" is an unconventional first encounter science fiction story that takes a number of intersting twists and turns. It's ambitious and delivers a lot of the goods but not all of them.

SPOILERS:

Nic (Brenton Thwaites)finds himself sitting across from a scientist named Damon (Laurence Fishburne)in a hazmat suit. Damon tells Nic that he and his two friends who were traveling west had an encounter with an extraterrestrial. They are in quarantine and Damon needs is there to provide a ""transition"" back to real life but only after answering his questions. From there things become more complex and more interesting as Nic speaks to his friend Jonah via the air vent only to find out that something is happening to him. What, he can't quite describe. To give any more details would spoil some of the fasincating twists and turns of this unconventional science fiction/horror flick.

END OF SPOILERS:

Director and co-writer William Eubanks demonstrates a remarkable ability with shifting tone and creating a credible thriller with very little money (the budget ws $4 million). Unlike most low-budget movies, ""The Signal"" actually has a story to it and well developed characters with an intriguing mystery at its core. Eubanks takes a number of science fiction cliches and and turns those cliches on their heads.

So why not a higher rating? Eubanks ambition is still a bit beyond his grasp here but ""The Signal"" promises some interesting work from this young UCLA film school drop out. By the conclusion of the film the various twists and turns results in the last third getting away from him (and falling into a chase movie cliche) before a surprising and--stunning--unresolved conclusion. The fact that there are too many unanswered questions and some narrative side trips that don't quite make sense in the context of the conclusion doesn't mean the film isn't entertaining.

For the Blu-ray:

The blu-ray transfer looks quite stunning especially consider its low budget origin. Blacks are solid throughout and the color (which, if you pay attention, changes ever so subtly in terms of saturation depending on the setting and were we are in the story)is solid as well.

The 5.1 mix makes nice use of the surround speakers. Dialog remains clear throughout and subtitles are provided in English.

The special features are limited but interesting. We get a commentary track from the director and co-writer David Fragenio which occasionally settles into describing the action and could be a bit more revealing.

There's also a featurette on the production of the film providing a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the film. The last special feature is a brief outtake of Laurence Fishburne that's amusing.

""The Signal"" is a cut above most conventional Hollywood fare with the largest flaw of the film being a lack of payoff in terms of the conclusion. If you're looking for something that spells everything out then ""The Signal"" isn't for you. The comparison to Kubrick isn't too far off in terms of the clinical and detached clinical style of parts of the film (Lynch is a bit of a stretch. The plot twists remind me a bit of Spielberg's films like ""A.I."" and ""Minority Report""). ""The Signal"" is a very good film that gets a bit twisted up in its own plot twists at the expense of a clear narrative but is still worthwhile.",1412467200,,3329,4.969424460431655
6492188,5,B00LMJUOWC,"I have to say two things first. I am a Sci Fi guy, and this may contain spoilers. First off, this is a movie styled like a throw back to a Twilight Zone episode. Not an exact episode, but it keeps you guessing even after the credits roll. I will be honest and say, I wish it was longer. I would have also liked a few more answers. But unlike the 1, 2, and 3 star reviews, I appreciate the style of film ""The Signal"" succeeded at being. It wasn't cheaply done, and it wasn't a bad movie. Lots of people out there are looking for a two dimensional point A to point B style movies. I think this broke out of the box. It gives you something more than a story book, predictable chain of events a 5 year old can put together.

The visual effects and sound were very well done. I didn't look at it and say ""That looks cheap."" I enjoyed the story and character development packed well into a 1 hour and 30 minute run time. The effects felt like Elysium and District 9. I honestly don't think anyone will have a problem with it in that regard.

I liked the story. There are people that will hate it, there are people that will say ""Meh"" and there are more people like myself, that will appreciate it. Don't look for an in-depth birth to death style of character development, enjoy it for what it is. Like a Twilight Zone episode. If you look at it like that, you'll be fine. Appreciate it for what it is, not for what some want it to be. If you go in with no expectations, I feel like you'll enjoy it much more. The ending will leave you wanting more, and with unanswered questions, but those are the endings you remember. They keep you talking about it.

Overall, I bought it blind, and don't regret it. This is definitely a rent me first, but if you enjoy it, add it to the collection. It's a good movie. Not great or an epic, but it is definitely a solid 7/10. I'd give it a 4 out of 5 stars, but I think people are being waaaay too critical, so I'm trying to give it a bump so those on the fence might take a chance to see if they like it. Again, rent it first, and see. I'm not upset at all I own it forever, and I will definitely watch it again. Hope this helps.",1412467200,13,2159,4.063380281690141

6492201,4,B00LMJUOWC,"Yeah, four stars!  Let me explain.  It's not worth owning, so DO NOT BUY THIS.  Once you see it, you will probably never watch it again.  But you WILL be glad you watched this, if you are a fan of science fiction, aliens, and conspiracies.

This is the kind of movie that leads you along in suspense and curiosity, springs a bunch of surprises on you, and blows your mind with a big ending.  The plot is paced slower than most, first endearing the main characters to you.  This it does really well.  We follow them on a heart-breaking road trip during which a mysterious hacker keeps invading their lives.  By the time they get involved with the mysterious agent (Fishburne), we already care about each of them.

They fall prey to a greater force than they could have imagined.  Trapped, observed, studied, questioned, and toyed with, they constantly struggle to escape and make sense of their predicament.  We follow them through this tantalizing experience--slowly, yes--but in a way that builds tension.  What the heck is going on?  Which explanation for their circumstances makes the most sense?  The film keeps you guessing until the very end.

The end?  You won't expect it.  Weird.  Frightening.

If you can keep calm and follow along, you will be rewarded.  Transformers this is NOT.  Independence Day this is NOT.  Frankly, while it is not action-packed, neither is reality.  And if you have ever read about aliens and government black projects, or you enjoy shows like Ancient Aliens or Unsealed: Alien Files, you will find this movie reflects that kind of speculation well.  In its own way.

However, it stayed above that and kept going with a decent bit of tension and plot movement. However, when it came to the final act, I was left scratching my head. I sort of enjoyed it, but by the end, there didn't seem to be any point to it all.

It wasn't exactly a bummer ending, but just a big meh that didn't really resolve much. Without giving away too much which I'm sure others already have, it just fell flat. If they'd have done the ending differently, maybe I would've liked it a lot better. This time, instead of the ending being a bummer, which is a no-payoff ending, it was just a plain no-payoff ending because it went nowhere. It was unsatisfying.

Morpheus,

How could you let those guys talk you into doing this weak flick? An hour and 38 minutes listening to you talk about your awesome filmography would've been better spent.

That said, all of the actors in The Signal put on really good performances. However, they were just saddled with a really slow pseudo sci-fi script. Point - slo-mo (imaginary) action is no substitute for real sci-fi.

Hope you follow this one up with more stellar performances.

6492252,2,B00LMJUOWC,"In spite of a slow start, this movie had some potential, once the characters have their uncanny encounter in the desert. Then it all starts going downhill as the movie hits you with one weird thing after another, with nothing to connect them or suggest some larger whole that they could be part of. Each scene is full of cool strangeness, but they keep raising more and more unanswered questions, and the movie itself seems undecided about what is really going on, pointing in one direction, then another, and finally just giving up and ending on a really bizarre FX shot that hangs a huge question mark over the whole deal. This isn't a story - this is bits of stories scattered about like jigsaw pieces, and maybe they all fit together, but maybe not, and I personally didn't have enough faith left in the film after that last reveal to go back and waste time on the pieces scattered about.

This movie could have been good, but it turned out as disorganized junk. If you liked the grab bag of plot threads and plot holes that was Prometheus, then you'd probably enjoy this one too. Otherwise, give it a miss - there's better stuff out there.

Having said that, I have to give this movie at least one credit - it was NOT recycling the same old crap and it was not just a bunch of eyecandy. If it'd had some kind of unifying narrative, even if it kept the answers a secret, it could have been a contender :(

This movie started off slow, but once the main characters encountered...whatever they encountered (trying not to spoil) things seemed to get going. Then it all descended into weird for the sake of weird, with lots of questions and no real answers, and the big reveal at the end was just a big ""What the hell did I just watch?"" for me.
There's lots of interesting weird stuff, but it never adds up to any one thing, so you have no idea what is going on. If a movie
I don't mind when movies raise questions, but if they're going to leave those questions unanswered, they need to create a coherent picture so the VIEWER can come to their own conclusions.

6492255,4,B00LMJUOWC,"First off let me start by I love any movie about Aliens and anything to do with them. When I first watched the trailer for this I had to click ""buy"" before the trailer was even over, it looked that good. The whole idea and concept of the movie is brilliant, how our government knows EXACTLY what is going on with alien abductions and they hide it all from the public. I loved the fact after the ""abduction"" happened they ""woke-up"" in a secret underground government scientific laboratory (I believe all of this is true in real life). Our government is so quick to hide any real information of anything ever happening like this in real life, but it does happen and it happens every day. I am a believer that our government allows these things to go on and keep the public hidden from the truth as long as they receive technology from the aliens (which they hide from us as well so we continue spending the ""petro-dollar"" ). This movie hit it right on the nose about a lot of topics that are very interesting, but I believe it could have been a lot better then it was. First off, if the aliens did change your legs from human to ""alien"" why did it look so robotic ? It would have been more believable if it was more ""flesh"" like, maybe half humanoid, half alien. It would have been a bit more realistic then robot legs and arms that have special powers? Secondly it should have gone more into a realistic view of the secret underground bases that they have all over the Area-51 zone. That whole scene when he escapes with his girlfriend was just extremely hard to watch for me because I know that would never happen in real life. Those bases are miles and miles and miles underground with all types of crazy security forces on every floor. It would be next to impossible to escape. Besides that I would have liked to see more examples of other people who have been abducted and they were studying there as well, they did show a scene when he was being wheel-chaired back to his room when they were cleaning out other rooms that seemed to have had some kind of alien ""Goo"" all over them. They could have done some really cool scenes down there if they had made a few more realistic points of view. That cow scene, what was that about? Would have liked to see something better then that. Thirdly I thought the movie would have been better if they didn't get so much into the feelings of the characters. I would liked to see the real life damage that happens to people after they've been abducted. I wanted to see more of the side effects from what happened to them during their ""experience"". And what even happened to the girl? it didn't show anything different about her other then a little probe like object on the back of her neck, other than that why did his friend get new arms when his arms were perfectly fine to begin with? I understand the boys legs got switched because he couldn't walk, but the other boys arms? The girls neck? I just think that could have been better detailed about what happened to those two. With real life abductions, they have found a lot of weird metallic unknown objects imbedded inside the abducties skin. As far as I know, these objects are unknown what their function is or why they are there ( the government probably knows exactly what they are and why their there though ). Although this movie was a little over board at times, I did enjoy it. I liked the scene at the very end when he ""broke-through"" the ""realm"" ( if thats what you call it ) and was looking at all kinds of different dimensions, that was cool. I also enjoyed when Fishbournes character revealed himself as a humanoid as-well and told him he was chosen for this to happen, it answered a lot of questions I had about how and why did an alien contact them through an online deep internet chat. I enjoyed this movie a lot, I loved the whole concept and idea of this movie, i just wish it focused more about what happens during an abduction and what happens after the abduction more than the feelings of the boy and him trying to escape. This is an extremely interested part of life that I wish was more publicly known about the true life events that are happening to people and what our government is doing.

To pass their time - it would be a waste to actually see the country - they chase a hacker who hacked them (huh?), fast forward through some tech mumbo jumbo and presto they find themselves in the middle of nowhere at night in front of some seemingly abandoned house in the desert to confront the 'hacker'...

This is where the wheels come of, because the next thing you see after some jerky 1st person cell phone footage they wake up in - what looks like - government facility, one guy has a set of mechanical legs that allows him to run as fast as the flash, the other gets some cool hulk hands that can smash stuff, why? No idea, and nobody ever bothers to explain it, the chick is in a coma, no explanation as to why is offered either, but she wakes up more or less right away. They spend the rest of the movie trying to get out of the facility in the most uninteresting way you can imagine and with ZERO suspense, past the guards and speed through the roadblocks with a stolen truck and as they make it to supposed freedom they smash through a glass wall and ... Wait for it ... Find out in the last scene that they are in a spaceship and ol'lawrence is actually an alien and not a very interesting one at that... Credits roll

All this has been done before and a lot better, this was aggravating to watch with no explanation offered and no pay off at the end and the spaceship you got to see for maybe a 5sec scene before the credits rolled looked like one of the domes from frickin 'silent running' which BTW blows this movie out of the water.",1410652800,6,1688,4.239130434782608

6492259,5,B00LMJUOWC,"I didn't read much about this movie before watching it. I think that's why I liked it so much. The way things unfolded, the viewer couldn't be sure what was fake, if it was some psychological game or something else entirely. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, wondering what would happen next. I can't write much else or it will give away the story but I really liked the way little things added up at the end and even at that point, when I figured what was happening, it still was cool the way the answers had been right there. For anyone who likes being kept at the edge of their seat during a movie, this is a perfect movie to watch....just please don't read any spoilers.",1410652800,2,680,4.27906976744186

You're left with half a movie, if that. I totally would not recommend it.",1410652800,4,356,4.1
6492261,2,B00LMJUOWC,"My biggest pet peeve in film is when characters don't act like real people, and The Signal had me peeved throughout half the movie for this reason. Honestly, everything about the writing was bad except maybe the first ten minutes or so. Everything was either too convenient or too inconvenient, characters either overreacted or didn't react at all, characters told me how much they cared rather than showing me, etc. And the ending was surprising in the same way it would be surprising if the police killed everyone at the end of The Godfather: surprising doesn't make an ending good, and this movie proves it.

On the bright side, the effects are good for an Indie move, and there are scenes that I liked a little bit out of context. I think if these filmmakers got their hands on a better script, they could make something special.",1410566400,,833,4.666666666666667

6492263,2,B00LMJUOWC,"This was an extremely internalized film.  It relies on the ""we have just been screwing with your mind factor"" with relatively little action or excitement to sustain it.

Prior to getting to the truth of what is going on, you will have to deal with the frustratingly slow aspects of the film.  ""We are being held by men in contamination suits that watch us and ask inane questions."". The boring laboratory type scenes are lengthy and lack anything that will bring any type of suspense.  You are presented with ""you have been exposed to extraterrestrial biological entities (EBEs)"".  There is a cow, we darken the window, you hear a thunk from a chair, and there is no cow.  It is loose, and you return to the hall scene to see ripped metal walls.  There are attempts to escape, and then you find out the real truth.  This is the whole film.

Didn't the above paragraph read as boring?  Now imagine watching that for 2 hours.

When you are finally presented with the ending, you can't imagine what the purpose was behind the events in the film.  Really, what was the purpose?  What were you trying to do?  Did you really have to go to these lengths to get answers?  I scratched my head for a very long time and decided it was a very poorly done and inexpensive remake of two much better films.

6492270,4,B00LMJUOWC,"Driving west from Cambridge toward Pasadena, three friends (two male, one female) opt for a brief detour in Nevada to find ""Nomad,"" a gifted, but mysterious computer programmer they have previously encountered online.  At his secluded desert home, they hear an unusual signal and become disoriented.  The trio then come to in an underground government laboratory.  Answers prove elusive in this frightening, sterile environment as a team of scientists study them and pose ambiguous questions regarding extraterrestrial biological entities.  The Signal is a neat and tightly crafted science-fiction mystery and horror film.  It is best to enter without knowing very much because a significant part of the film's charm is its ability to distort viewers' perceptions and upend our expectations just as the characters find their world turned upside down, building to an old-school, Twilight Zone-style twist ending which put an enormous smile on my face.  The experience is, I admit, not particularly profound or resonant (this is first and foremost a coldly teasing exercise in spectacle-on-a-budget style and mind-teasing plot curlicues), but it is definitely engaging and entertaining, buoyed by a perfectly deadpan performance by Laurence Fishburne as the scientists' authoritative, yet ambivalent leader.",1408406400,4,1305,5.666666666666667

Fortunately, it exceeded even the little expectations I had for it. In this film I found the tri-fecta of cinema; a well crafted-story, a talented and engaging cast, and well implemented special effects. Very rarely does a Western film resonate with me, but when they do, I know that the creators have really crafted something special. I will be buying this movie to add to my collection as soon as it is released. An amazing achievement in Sci-fi cinema, as far as I am concerned.",1407888000,,620,4.594594594594595
8666661,2,B00LMJUOWC,"By it's very nature, science fiction is going to be unusual, confusing, and sometimes just plain weird. When it's done correctly, that can be a very good thing, but when it's not done the right way, audiences are left confused and annoyed. In 2014's The Signal, three friends are on a road trip, headed back to school for another semester of higher education. To their disbelief, a hacker who had been bothering them for months is still at it and is making things personal. Nic, Haley, and Jonah have some tricks of their own and ultimately track down the hackers address. To no ones surprise, it's on their way to school and they decide to pay them a visit. What should have been a fun moment, turned into something more sinister, when a deadly scream leads to darkness, and Nic (Brenton Thwaits) winds up in a quarantined hospital with no memory of what happened that night. I enjoyed the premise of this movie and as far as story goes, the idea wasn't all that terrible, what was terrible was the way in which it was presented. This buddy road trip film ends up in a hospital, where the friends are held for way too long. The hospital scenes are just strange, unexplained, and kill the movies momentum. Towards the end there are some better scenes, hinting that the film may be building up to an epic conclusion, but it's just more of the same, as things take an even stranger turn, and an anti-climatic one at that. As for the stars of the film, Laurence Fishburn gives yet another flat robotic performance. Morpheus was the perfect character for this guy, but he never seemed to be able to leave him behind, and now plays this same role in every film. On the other side, Brenton Thwaites, somewhat known for his breakout performance in The Giver, made this film for me. He was enigmatic, on target, and just fun to watch. I said it in my review of the Giver and I'll say it agin, this kid is going places. The Signal had all the ingredients for a great science fiction film, but when the cake was done it didn't taste so good. Most of the acting was flat, the story went off in too many different directions, and it was frequently anti-climatic.",1532304000,,2150,4.487244897959184
8666662,3,B00LMJUOWC,Just watched this on Netflix and though it could have been better it really didn't matter because it was a pretty good sci-fi movie with a decent ending.

8666665,3,B00LMJUOWC,"I probably liked it a little more than 3 stars, but that's only because I find Olivia Cooke's take on the characters she portrays endlessly fascinating (check her out in the film Thoroughbreds).  And the Laurence Fishburne reveal at the end was a true surprise.  But the ending was unexpected only because it didn't really connect to the bulk of the story that preceded it.  You never get a handle on what the ""signal"" actually is or the reason behind why the subjects have alien appendages after encountering the mysterious whatever-happened-to-them.  The acting is very good despite the plot holes, though, and you do feel for the young college age characters, if only because you as the audience are as tortured and confused about what's going on as they are.  It's not a bad movie, it's just that the key moments feel rushed where a little more exposition would have helped the story.",1530576000,,888,4.777777777777778
