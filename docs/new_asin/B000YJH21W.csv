Porn movies have better acting. Not to worry the story line
is worse, what a  POS I am sending mine back for a
refund. I don't know what kind of drugs the past reviewers
were on, but I want some....",1235606400,,250,3.9019607843137254

8233092,5,B000YJH21W,"I really enjoyed this film...From its bizarre cast of characters(Captain Happy, a creepy robot dressed in black, a naked biker, etc.) to its bizarre worlds(Fog land). The film oozes a thought provoking sci fi tale that's brilliantly wooven together by its writer/director Mike Lyddon.  A well balanced blend of humorous and dead serious.",1195516800,,337,5.3584905660377355
