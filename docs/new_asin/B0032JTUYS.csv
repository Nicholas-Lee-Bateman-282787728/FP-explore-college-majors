4060843,5,B0032JTUYS,"The tagline of Durham County season 1 was ""Smaller the town, Darker the secrets"", and that was a very fitting tagline, as it seemed everyone was hiding something, whether they were ""good"" or ""bad"" characters.

With the DVD release of Season 2, we have a new tagline of ""Same Town, Darker Secrets"", and once again that's a very apt description of this series.

Returning with a second set of six episodes, we pick up with the Sweeney family as they try to somehow salvage some semblance of a familial structure in the aftermath of Ray Prager.

It seemed that Ray has left his fingerprints on virtually everyone in the show as the show begins.

Sadie is dealing with her interactions with Ray in the finale of last season and just like her father, we don't exactly know what went on. She's obviously still dealing with the lingering affects of what happened, and you can see it's tearing her apart inside. And while we don't know exactly what it was, although we have ideas, it's way too much for her to hold inside, which is what she's trying to do.

Mike is struggling to come to grips with how his family has disintegrated in the wake of the events of last season. His marriage is practically over, he's having to move out, and he's constantly bouncing back and forth between a bubbling rage and constant anxiety over the possibilities of what Ray Prager did to his daughter before he got there to save her.

She won't answer his questions, which only makes him more on edge.

Then there's Ray's son, Ray Jr. He's in love with Sadie, however Mike isn't having any of that. There's obvious parallels between Ray Jr/Sadie and Romeo/Juliet, only the relationship between Ray Jr. and Sadie wanders away from the ""meant for each other"" aspects and more into the ""this is a bad idea"" areas.

You can tell they sort of have feelings for each other, however Ray Jr's father's actions towards Sadie, and Sadie's father's actions towards Ray Prager have created this huge wall between them that it's hard to see anyone overcoming.

Sadie's so internally damaged over what happened, and her decision to keep the crux of the encounter to herself, leads her to try to deal with this in any way she can. This includes trying to coax Ray Jr. into helping her recreate the encounter with his father, which freaks out Ray Jr.

Sadie is trying to come to grips with her feelings and her trauma by meeting with a therapist, Pen Verity (Michelle Forbes), who is an old acquaintance of her father's.

Verity has some issues of her own dealing with the death of her son which may or may not have been an accident, the divorce from her husband which is growing more and more acrimonious by the day, and an affair with Sadie's father, while treating her.

Forbes is an amazing actress, and shows once again that she's heavily underrated when it comes to this acting game. She played the role of Verity with such humanity and intensity that you totally understood her actions, even while finding yourself repulsed by them.

You see her doing reprehensible things, and yet much like Ray Prager in Season 1, you can almost see the method to the madness. And with Verity there was a definite sense of madness about her, a result of trauma in her past.

At one moment you find yourself empathizing with what she's gone through and what she's currently going through, and then you see her poisoning some chocolates to harm someone close to Mike and your feelings change, and you see that this same person you're sympathizing with earlier you can see her in her full on evil mode, and then you can STILL feel for her later in scenes where she's falling apart. It takes a special kind of actress to pull that off, and not just make a one dimensional villain.

Her confrontation with Mike after he finds out what she did with the chocolates stands out as my favorite scene of Season 2, and it is a nice showdown between two very strong willed actors.

In all, every character in this series is damaged seemingly beyond help. At times it's difficult to imagine a scenario in which they can ever be whole again.

The entire season is building towards the endgame, which is Sadie testifying against Ray Prager (played this season by Romano Orzari due to Justin Louis' role on Stargate Universe), which is something she's dreading and not sure if she can do.

Complicating her decision is friends of Ray's (some of which are in the police department) are determined to make sure she doesn't testify.

While the first season was a dark and disturbing look into Suburbia and the secrets it hides under it's idyllic image, this season goes even deeper and presents these characters as even more flawed. You see how they react to adversity and hurdles, and the results are often not pretty.

There were a few things that I had reservations with, mainly Orzari's replacing Louis as Ray Prager. Louis was fantastic and just flat out owned that role, and while it was difficult to imagine someone else playing it, Orzari did a capable job.

In fact he was covered in makeup to illustrate the burns that the character suffered after setting himself on fire out of seeming remorse for his actions. During the first several episodes he was mostly hidden in shadows, and until he was fully shown I didn't even realize it wasn't him. That might be a combination of the fact that I didn't pay attention to the credits, and hadn't heard that Louis wasn't back, and also because Orzari was very good in this role.

Not as good as Louis, but good nonetheless.

All in all this was another fantastic season to what quickly became one of my top five television shows of all time. The upcoming third season, scheduled currently to air in October, will be the final season according to the show runners. This is a disappointment to fans of the show, as of course we want to see what we love as much as possible. However there's a delicate balance between ending a show too early, and staying too late.

Many popular shows tend to overstay their welcome, because they're still getting decent ratings, but creatively they've been stagnant or declining for years. And then you look back on the show and think ""well it was good, but man was it bad at the end"".

With Durham County, unless this upcoming season is a disappointment, and there's no reason to even imagine that being possible, we'll see the show off in style, still at the height of it's creativity and brilliance in acting, writing, direction and presentation.

Besides, we'll still have the scheduled movie finale, so we still have at least a year or two before Durham County is done for good. Maybe more, depending on how the movie is received.

****THE PACKAGING DETAILS REFLECT THE CANADIAN RELEASE. THE AMERICAN RELEASE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT WHEN IT IS RELEASED****

SEASON 2 DVD DETAILS
-------------------------------------

Unlike last season which came in slimpaks inside a slipcover, this one has only two discs with three episodes on each disc, and one of each of the two behind the scenes videos on each. It also comes in a standard amaray dvd case, with an insert that holds a second disc inside. There's also a slip cover for your dvd case that features the same artwork as the main case.

I have to say that it seemed they were perhaps saving money this time around on the packaging. I don't know if that's because the first season didn't sell as well or what, but it's a noticeable difference. Doesn't change the quality of the show, which is top notch, just something I noticed.

The Bonus features are lighter this time around as well, with two videos. One is an ""Interview with Cast & Crew"" which is pretty enlightening and a nice insight into the making of the show, and the other is a ""Making of"" Durham County.

FINAL THOUGHTS:

This remains one of my favorite shows of all time, and definitely one of the best shows on TV now. A slight hiccup with the replacement of Justin Louis for Ray Prager, although it was an unavoidable situation seeing as how Louis got a lead role on Stargate: Universe. Hopefully he'll return sometime for Season 3 or the movie, but there's no guarantees of that.

Great show, decent packaging, a little skimpy on the extras, but the extras that are there are very good and very insightful on the making of this great show.

4060855,3,B0032JTUYS,I viewed on Series 1 and 1/2 of Series 2 on Netflix but all three parts of the series were taken down before I finished.  Therefore I purchased last few episodes of Series 2 and all of Series 3 from Amazon. Series 1 was pretty good. Series two was a little disappointing and Series 3 was AWFUL!. If I could have I would have gotten my money back.,1382659200,,346,4.088235294117647

4060858,5,B0032JTUYS,"Durham County is not perfect and there are some flaws in the storyline and from what I hear the production of this series. However there is far more good things than bad about this show. The series is dark and places one at the edge. It'll keep you guessing and is shot/cinematography is nothing short of brilliant. The actors standout and can be appreciated through proper character development and a good storyline. The series reminds me of a poor man's version of Dexter but not that poor. Like Dexter, it's creepy, well written and not very predictable. So help me out anyone...when is Durham County 3 going to be released in DVD format? I can't get any info anywhere.",1311724800,,672,4.65546218487395
4060859,2,B0032JTUYS,"After thoroughly enjoying the intrigue and mystery of season 1, I was really disappointed in season 2.  It just doesn't have that ""gotcha"" feel about it to make you want to see the next episode.  Could be intertaining to some, but not my bag of tea.",1305763200,,249,4.391304347826087
4060860,5,B0032JTUYS,"Despite changing actors for one of the most important roles from Season 1, Durham County Season 2 manages to stay compelling entertainment. With the introduction of the great Michelle Forbes as a psychologist with just a few 'issues' of her own, the story propels forward as Ray Prager goes to trial for his crimes and Mike Sweeney's daughter is the star witness against him. More 'secrets' about all the main characters are revealed here and the jaw dropping actions of all concerned continues to make for a riveting series. If you haven't come across this show I recommend purchasing it as it may be hard to find and its a cut above most other shows currently on TV in my view.",1298332800,,679,4.619834710743802
4060861,5,B0032JTUYS,Durham County is one of the best drama shows to come in a long time. The story line is so dark and at the same time so full of energy which no doubt comes from not only the writing but the excellent acting especially Hugh Dillon (DET.SWEENY).,1295827200,3,242,4.170212765957447
4060862,4,B0032JTUYS,"While the show itself is as good or better than Season One, why is the U.S. version formatted in 4:3. With slight letterboxing as well!
Do these people think it's 1995?

The first season, which in my case was the Canadian version, was anamorphic wide screen. Has the manufacturer of this DVD heard about this feature?

Could Amazon mention this ""feature"". You say "" widescreen"", but not that it is buried in a 4:3 image.",1292284800,2,420,4.586666666666667

The story in both vol. 1 & 2 will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to see more. It is well worth every penny you pay. Now I can hardly wait for season 3 to come out on DVD. Hats over to Hugh and the directors, producers and writer great job.",1291334400,2,428,3.875
4060864,5,B0032JTUYS,"I really liked the first season of ""Durham County"" and, frankly, was ready for a bit of a let down in Season Two, but I can easily say that the second season is EVEN BETTER! Maybe it's because we know the characters and have an idea of what to expect from them. Maybe it's because the production values have only gotten more impressive.

I have enjoyed the show on television and am looking forward to the unedited and uncensored DVD version.",1288828800,2,442,4.45679012345679

Much attention is paid to the location and ambiance, it might seem dull but then it's also sinister. Love the little discussion about the location of the new house and how a row of trees will block out the power line view - which is visually brought up again and again.

 I made sure it was not my dvd player, and the dvd  isn't messed up because when they showed scenes from season one when the dvd first started they were not dark.
One of the main carrectors is a diferent actor so maybe that is why, but the director or who ever is responsible is an idiot.
I have watched two episodes and that is all I could stand, it was so dark I can't see what is going on. I sure wasn;t going to ajust my T.V. just for this one show and mess up the picture for all other shows just to watch one of these episodes every so often.
