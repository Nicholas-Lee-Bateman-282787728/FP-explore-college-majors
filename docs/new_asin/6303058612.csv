553471,5,6303058612,"I give this DVD 5 stars simply because its Diana Ross. The fact that there are only 6 music videos which all come from the 80's is very disappointing. Its still better to have some of MISS ROSS'S videos on DVD rather than none at all, but this is not the way a DIVA of her caliber should be recognized. Fans want more of Diana's videos, not just a small portion. I would have also included her videos:
* Mirror Mirror
* Chain Reaction
* Eatin Alive
* Dirty Looks
* Workin Overtime
* This House
* Take me Higher
* I Will Survive
* Until We Meet Again
* Not Over You Yet
* Upside Down (Live)
* I'm Coming Out (Live)
* The Best Years of my Life",1084060800,16,641,3.9384615384615387
553472,3,6303058612,"Although it is nice to have a DVD at last, containing some of Ross's greatest 80s moments on music video, the HUGE disappointment is that the original tracklist from the 1985 VHS release (re-issued in 1993) has not changed at all.  The same six videos! This is quite disappointing - us fans expected the DVD to be expanded, with an additional 6 videos, like my suggested additions below:
* Mirror, Mirror
* Work That Body
* Eaten Alive
* Chain Reaction [her best music video ever!]
* Dirty Looks
* Missing You [original 'more Motown' version]
To be honest, I was surprised when 10 years ago, the VHS edition was reissued with no additional selections. Now, I am even more surprised and upset that this still hasn't been expanded and revised. This DVD could also have new cover art to make it improved.  Ultimately, while these videos are treasured by Diana Ross fans and this DVD will be nice to have, it falls far short of the star treatment we expect our favorite singer to receive.",1083888000,6,984,4.5852272727272725

""Why Do Fools Fall In Love"" finds Diana Ross under the lights & glamour of Las Vegas, ""Eaten Alive"" is an interesting Black & White video that will remind you of ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" with superb make-up. ""Chain Reaction"" is a highlight here, Diana Ross walks into a T.V station for a shoot, & suddenly we're are taken back to the early days. . .

In this stunning video you can witness Ross  dancing away as if on some 60's type, t.v. show such as Hullaboo when all  of a sudden it transfers into colour and you can see the dazzling  transformation of Miss Ross of how she is today - an icon of glamour! The  video is great fun and the track itself is a true classic although it did  surprisingly fare very badly on the U.S charts.  SWEPT AWAY and EATEN ALIVE  are also notably good, creative and enjoyable videos whilst WHY DO FOOLS  FALL IN LOVE features Ross running and dancing her way round some of the  most dazzling sights in Las vegas.

Surely someone of Diana Rosses stature, deserves a complete career videography? capturing all of her work from the 60's to present day (another diva who needs the same is Donna Summer)

553562,2,6303058612,"La Ross fans enjoy seeing their diva preen, put on a fashion show and glam it up, but this sort of behavior does not lend itself that well to the directoral concepts applied in these videos and ultimately the concepts are way too thin in many of these videos. Granted, ""Pieces of Ice"" is an avant-garde and surreal work and the video should fit that element of the song, what is up with the WIZ-like Zebra costume? It is laughable, although the concept tries to fit the song. In ""Muscles"", why is there that lone still shot which shows up twice from a black and white movie with a man flexing his muscles amidst other shots of other muscle-bound men surrounding Ross? Here there is quite a discontinuity. Then, La Ross tries to rip off Pat Benatar with the cat fights in ""Swept Away"" which is a direct rip-off of Pat's work in the ""Love Is a Battlefield"" video. Then, the most absurd video has to be for ""All of You"" which is the type of song for which a video should never have been made. All these people bust into a contrived and ornate style dance at a dinner party - what gives? With all the money behind Diana Ross, couldn't she do better or is this all her imagination can deliver? The songs are great and the producers behind her delivered some great music in her career, but the fact she has admitted to being the force behind her videos  volumes about why in part she is floundering now - it must be from a lack  of potent creativity.",1097366400,3,1444,4.324723247232472

 With regard to the ""The Visions of Diana Ross"" for what it is - it is great. However, I am very disappointed that unlike the European version of this as well as the earlier European VHS, ""Chain Reaction"" was not included. By far one of the gem's in Ms. Ross' song book. How easy it would be to include this item allowing many Americans who have never seen it to have the experience that long time Diana fan's and all of Europe have had.

 Let's get real with the amount of storage available on a DVD why not really provide a special product and charge more. I am sure that those that purchased this are only the Di-hard fans and we would easily fork over additional money to get more of one of our leading ladies of the twentieth century.",1091232000,3,911,4.27906976744186

553666,5,6303058612,"This time last week there were 15 reviews of this item including mine. Now there are only 4. As a long time customer I'd like to know why were they deleted? The only common theme I can see, except for one bash review, was the criticism of Amazon for editorializing Ms. Ross' problems in Tucson 4 years ago. I stated in my earlier review that it's totally inappropriate for Amazon act like the tabloids when reviewing an item they are selling. It's interesting to note that Amazon's policy for posting customer reviews specifically state: ""Comments that are not specific to the item's content may not be posted on our site"". Amazon should practice the same.

 I for one am happy this re-issue of Diana's RCA videos, released in the 80s, has finally come to DVD. The transfer is clear and crisp and the sound quality is great. The videos contained in the disk are: Why do Fools Fall in Love, Swept Away, All of You, with Julio Iglesias, Muscles, the beautiful Missing You and the underrated and surrealistic Pieces of Ice. Could there be more? Definitely yes. If this disk sells well maybe the US fans can finally get the One Woman Video Collection, which has been available to European and Japanese fans for years, but never released in the States. The Supremes greatest hits is also currently available in Europe on DVD. Maybe the powers that be will read these reviews and listen. Lady Sings the Blues played at the Gary theatre in Boston for over a year! Why isn't it available on DVD? How about TCB and GIT? Mahogany? Lets hope someone is listening and we can get more.

""D. Myers"" from Florida, call an exorcist ASAP. you need one for all the hating you spew. I am equally insulted as Amazon's own reviewer, Sam Graham, who started his own alleged review by referring to Ross' DUI arrest. And by the way, Sam...she was never booked, she was released by the officers who chauffered her back to the hotel so there WAS NO MUGSHOT. When you reveiw Paul McCartney's stuff, do you start off with his marijuana arrest and jail time? And to you Ross haters, God Bless you and do grow up. But it's nice to know you can't stand her so much, you actually took the time to chronicle her life and went out of your way to tear her down by searching for one of her DVD's.

7836615,3,6303058612,"I first bought the VHS version of this back in the early 90's and, pre-internet, it was nice to have.

Fast forward nearly 2 decades later; this was given as a gift, and while it was nice to see the videos again on a large screen and wax nostalgic, in this age the re-release is a letdown.

The videos are not particularly brilliant, but there's some imagination at work (""Piece of Ice"") some 80's camp (""Swept Away"", ""Muscles""), some 80's kitsch (""Why Do Fools Fall in Love"", ""All of You""), and one video that was classily done (""Missing You"").

That's it. Six videos. Running time less than 30 minutes.

By my count, Ross had done 3 other original videos at this point (the UK video for ""My Old Piano"", a Top 10 smash there, ""Mirror Mirror""- a simple video that's actually superior to some included here, and the novelty cheese of ""Work That Body""). Since this collections release in 1985 she has done at least 20 more music videos (my count could be off, but I'm citing ""Eaten Alive"", ""Chain Reaction"", ""Experience"", ""Dirty Looks"", ""If We Hold on Together"", ""Workin Overtime"", ""This House"", ""Paradise"", ""When You Tell Me That You Love Me"", ""One Shining Moment"", ""Heart (Don't Change My Mind"", ""The Force Behind the Power"", ""Where Did We Go Wrong"", ""Your Love"", ""The Best Years of My Life"", ""Take Me Higher"", ""Gone"", ""I Will Survive"", ""In the Ones You Love"", ""Until We Meet Again"", ""Not Over You Yet"" and the Westlife remake of ""When You Tell Me That You Love Me""). I realize most of these weren't commercial successes in the US (some not even released), but a Diana Ross fan would enjoy them, as some of them (particularly ""Chain Reaction"" and ""Take Me Higher"") are probably her best music videos. And really, who is the intended audience for a collection like this? I doubt a casual fan is on the hunt for the video of ""Pieces of Ice"". This is for Diana fans, period. I think ultimately the following inclusions would've helped:

-Mirror, Mirror
-Eaten Alive
-Chain Reaction
-Dirty Looks
-Workin' Overtime
-When You Tell Me That You Love Me
-One Shining Moment
-Your Love
-The Best Years of My Life
-Take Me Higher
-Gone
-I Will Survive
-Not Over You Yet

i realize it's two different music labels, but if that were an issue, the first 4 songs i listed could've been added with no problem, as they were all from the same label tenure (RCA). A MUCH better, career spanning retrospective WAS issued overseas on VHS. Sadly, it's incompatible with our VCRs in the US.

For long-time fans of Diana Ross, the reissue of the 1985 VHS tape may be a good purchase just to update the collection. For newer fans, it is a solid look at Ross during a period of mostly solid productivity in the studio for RCA Records, while embracing the music video revolution with style and class.

Three of the six songs reached the top ten on the single's pop chart - Why Do Fools Fall In Love (#7, 1981), Muscles (#10, 1982) and Missing You (#10, 1985), the touching tribute to Marvin Gaye - with Pieces of Ice (#31, 1983) and the top twenty releases, Swept Away and All of You (w/ Julio Iglesias), completing the collection.

But the 31 minutes is only the music videos. With nearly 25 years since the release, it would seem obvious that some background information into each selection would have been a welcome - and an important - addition  to the production. The historical perspective is lost by simply airing one video after another, since music is not created in a vacuum.

The DVD could have expanded on the artistic vision of Ross, but ends up being a period piece that could have delivered so much more.",1231372800,2,1210,4.4818181818181815
