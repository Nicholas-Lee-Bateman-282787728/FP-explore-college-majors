7923726,5,B00004U5KK,"I absolutely LOVED and TREASURED this movie when I watched it when I was younger on VHS; I have long since lost the VHS tape and don't own a VCR anymore either; I ended up purchasing the DVD version ""Once Upon A Time"" which was a disgusting and BUTCHERED version of the film... sadly, it seems as if this movie, originally a wonderful masterpiece of story and art combined, which should have been heralded and gone down in history as a true ""classic"" film, has instead been lost in the digital age due to what seems to be a horrific trend of meddling with animation sleeper hits like this during their transition from analog to digital... I've seen the same thing happen with other such films as well, and I do not approve of it -at all-

I would gladly pay to in the neighborhood of $100+ to get a digitally-remastered version of the original VHS version of the film, no re-dubs, no cuts, no edits whatsoever other than simply digitally remastering the EXACT same version that appears on the original VHS tape, word for word, frame for frame... but again, sadly, it seems this will never happen.",1468108800,,1096,4.5353535353535355
7923727,3,B00004U5KK,"This little-known feature from 1986 didn't receive much attention when it was brought in America, but I have a strange attraction to it.  WINDARIA was probably my absolute FIRST experience with mature-themed Japanese anime.  I purchased this title blindly without knowing the meaning of the catch phrase ""animation for adult audiences"", but viewing WINDARIA left me with surprise.

No, it's not graphically violent or sexually explicit like some other ""adult"" Anime available, but WINDARIA is very much an animated fairy tale aimed at grown-ups rather than children.  Set in a lavish countryside where a giant tree looms over everything (shades of Miyazaki's CASTLE IN THE SKY here), WINDARIA's plot involves two kingdoms at war with each other.  The prince and princess from each empire are deeply in love with each other, but their romance is both forbidden and doomed by the unyielding conflict between their siblings.  This ROMEO AND JULIET style set-up is merely a back-story to the tale.

The real main character is a young farmer who dreams of a chance to be a hero and famous.  When a mysterious stranger arrives with an offer to act as a spy for the warring kingdoms in return for wealth and fame, the young farmer jumps at the chance.  He ends up paying a terrible price, however, for in carrying out his mission, the farmer betrays both his devoted wife and homeland--and even destroys an entire kingdom.

If the above sounds downbeat and depressing, it is.  Indeed, I was totally unprepared for such a complicated, dark story involving deceit, greed, and infidelity.  What made WINDARIA appealing, however, were the artwork and the lovely soundtrack.  The frame rate is a bit on the stiff side, but the character designs and backgrounds are gorgeous and imaginative.  Satoshi Kudakura's score is beautiful and tearjerking, and can easily hold its own against Joe Hisaishi's works for Hayao Miyazaki's films.

This release, however, is another story.  At the time I purchased the video, I did not realize that I was watching a heavily edited, outrageously rewritten version of what was once a more complicated story.  From what I have learned across the net, U.S. distributor Harmony Gold and its script writer, Carl Mecak, saw fit to market this adult story toward children, hence why some of the more intense scenes (involving the farmer's wife being beaten horribly to death) were omitted and, probably all the characters were renamed from Izu, Marlin, and Jihl to the likes of Alan, Marie, and Roland, respectably.  In addition to which, they even added a narrator (the protagonist at an older age who recalls his vile deeds from long ago) which was NOT in the original version.  This is why many Anime purists have held this edited dub (in addition to many others produced by Mecak and his equally controversial company, Streamline Pictures) in extremely low regards.

I can't tell you how dismayed I was to find out about this, because I was emotionally impacted by what was left of WINDARIA, even before learning about what was done to it (heck, I've never even seen the original Japanese version).  I've read scathing comments about the voice acting and the narration; I haven't seen this movie lately, but I didn't remember cringing at the quality of the vocal performances.  It's unfortunate, however, that WINDARIA was cut down from its 101 minute running time.

Equally dismaying is that this is the only version of WINDARIA that is available on our shores to this day.  Indeed, the DVD from ADV Films, a company who has the resources to redub older titles (they did a stellar job redubbing an earlier title from Mecak's, Gainax's NADIA:  THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER), is basically just the Carl Mecak dub (with its new title, ONCE UPON A TIME) with NO JAPANESE LANGUAGE TRACK.  I can imagine Anime fans skipping over this, especially since it has become common nowadays to release Anime with its initial language track as well as an optional dub.

Yet as I write this, I credit WINDARIA for being the title that introduced me to Japanese Anime; without it, I probably would never have discovered the countless amounts of titles that exist from this multi-faceted genre (Miyazaki's works, LODOSS, NADIA, SLAYERS, HIS AND HER CIRCUMSTANCES, COWBOY BEBOP, OUTLAW STAR... the list goes on and on).  It's a shame, though, that this title fell into obscurity; for in spite of its grievous edits, WINDARIA remains a powerful, compelling drama with meaningful messages to take away from.  Here is hoping that this underrated title will receive a better treatment with an all new, uncut, faithful dub and its original Japanese language track.  It would certainly be best for both the original creators and devoted fans of animation.",1125532800,7,4744,4.968354430379747
7923728,4,B00004U5KK,"If you like a lot of action/romance I would highly recommend this video!  This story involves two couples(2 peasants and 2 royals) who get caught up in a war destined to destroy....  Alan and his wife Marie are peasants who live in a neutral valley between two nations that are on the brink of war. Veronica is the princess of one nation, and Roland is the prince of the other. They are secretly in love, and many touching scenes take place between the two. However, their parents soon declare war on eachother, much to the dismay of Veronica, Roland, and everyone living in the valley. Alan unwittingly gets caught up in the war and looses sight of what's important...  Veronica and Roland(with the deaths of their parents) are forced to join the war, and thus comes many bloody battles and more touching scenes. To see the outcome of the war(and romances!) and the changes in the nations, I recommend watching either the dubbed or subtitled version of Windaria!",978480000,3,963,4.720238095238095
7923729,5,B00004U5KK,"For all of those who remember the series ""Macross"" (""Robotech"" in America), the animation and quality of ""Windaria"" should bring back wonderful memories of 80's anime.  ""Windaria"" is a fantastic tale of a romance between children in  conflicting royal families, involving residents in the neutral valley which  separates them.  The mature ""Romeo and Juliet"" theme, set in a  perfect mixture of technology and simplicity, appeals to fantasy lovers of  all types.  Whether dubbed with voices from the identically-animated  ""Robotech"", or in Japanese with English subtitles, this is a  video that every serious fan of anime should have in his or her collection.",961372800,4,658,5.372549019607843
