Reading the synopsis.",1387152000,,165,5.111111111111111
8502766,5,B006PFXSBC,"After watching Bride and Prejudice, I've been waiting patiently for this movie by the same director!!!  It's a Wonderful Afterlife is funny and sweet comedy about a Mother's love and wish for her daughter to get married.  FIVE STARS!!  For English, make sure you select It's a Wonderful Afterlife, not Hai Marjawaan! in the Audio Selection which is the default.",1357257600,8,361,4.983333333333333
