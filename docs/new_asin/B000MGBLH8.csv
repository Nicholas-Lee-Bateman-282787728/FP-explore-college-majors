2733896,5,B000MGBLH8,"This is yet another great workout that Prevention have put out.  It's great, fun and enjoyable and best of all, you'll get results if you do this often enough.  To be honest, it isn't this dvd that will get rid of cellulite - it's excerise in general (enough of it).

This has a lot of interval routines and toning for your thighs and glutes.  Chris Freytag continuously changes moves so you don't get bored and you get the most from the workout.  The six minute intervals get a little more intense each time which keeps you on your toes.  Overall it's around about an hour if you do it all in it's entirety.  I find it pretty effective and it kept me puffing a little and encouraged because Chris is a great instructor.

You can always do lower impact moves if you aren't fit or want to slow things down.  Either way, you'll get a great workout and the mere fact that you are getting your blood flowing through your body and toning your legs, it will make cellulite almost disappear and be much smoother.  I really like this one.",1178928000,13,1030,4.373684210526315
2733897,5,B000MGBLH8,"This workout is organized very well into six segments and really is alot of fun.  It starts out with a low-impact routine for 2 1/2 minutes and then the routine is repeated high-impact style for 2 1/2 minutes.  However, you could just repeat it low-impact again if you prefer.  It is very fun, the time goes by quickly,and I'm sweating like a dog at the end.  I consider myself an intermediate exercise who really likes fairly basic moves.  I think anyone beginner or intermediate would really enjoy this dvd.  Even a more advanced could ""pump it up"" to cater to their level.  This reminds me of her previous 3-2-1 workout in that it's divided in to the six segments.  I really like that, I know how much I have completed and how far I have to go.

After the cardio it has upper body strengthing and a lower body section.  There may be one more, but so far I have only done the cardio on this.",1177718400,10,893,4.325301204819277

If you don't pay $6.95 per month after the 3 month trial period the product will no longer work, so you if you don't plan on spending $6.95 per month don't buy it.

2733972,4,B000MGBLH8,"Summer in Qatar brings days with temps on many days 50c+ and going outside is a 'non starter'. So that I can continue working out I order in a supply of workout dvds and this time, despite not knowing anything about her, I ordered a couple of Chris Freytag's....and I'm so glad I did.  The Fight Cellulite Fast dvd is challenging, it gets the heart rate up and even if cellulite isn't your issue it still provides a thorough cardio workout.  After a 40 min cardio section there's a 15 min (approx) weights section that can be done directly after the cardio or done separately if you're short of time.  Also bought Chris Freytag's 'Walking Cardio ShapeUp' which is lots of fun. Its like doing a workout with a friend.

Did anyone else notice that the music used for the cardio section is the same music Leslie Sansone uses in a couple of her dvds?",1344988800,2,846,4.438709677419355
2733973,5,B000MGBLH8,"I purchased this DVD for my girlfriend as she likes to workout four nights a week and wanted a workout to reduce the "" I am all lumpy and weird looking now that I am over 40"" stuff that makes her feel self-concious. I can say that I thought she lookes delicious before she started using this workout and now looks even more so , even her self critical eye sees the difference. She does the entire workout four consecutiv nights in row monday through thursday , this workout really works.",1341360000,,487,4.362637362637362
2733974,5,B000MGBLH8,"This is an excellent fitness DVD in my opinion.

Chris (the fitness instructor) is really likable. She is not annoying like many fitness instructors on workout DVDs. She is easy to follow along with.

There are two other instructors in this DVD that go at different paces. You can follow along at whichever pace you feel is best for you. The slower pace is also easier on my joints which is a positive for me.

I feel like the workout itself can be as easy or as challenging as you wish to make it. I personally can get a very good workout in and can build up quite a sweat.

Overall I like this fitness DVD and am happy I purchased it.",1334620800,,636,4.188524590163935
2733975,3,B000MGBLH8,"Chris Freytag is one of my favorite workout instructors. She's very encouraging and makes you feel like you CAN do it. This dvd has two workouts, but I've only used the first one(cardio)for the past few months. It really gets you sweatin'! You get to choose level of intensity. This workout could easily be a HIIT(high intensity interval training)! On days when I'm feeling more energetic and want to burn more calories I may do jumping jacks instead of side-heel digs(lower-impact). The reason I gave it three stars is because of the excessive amount of lunges in the second workout(lower body). As an intermediate exerciser, I like to incorporate some lunges and/or squats in my routine, but 3/4 of workout is overkill. -",1313452800,4,723,4.8861788617886175
2733976,4,B000MGBLH8,"This is a 2-part workout with a 36-minute cardio and approximately 15-minute lower-body toning, plus a warm up and cool down.  I did the toning workout only once, so I don't have much to say about that part.  I love the cardio workout because it's pure cardio with tons of variety - none of the exercises are repeated across the segments.

The cardio workout contains 6 segments that are approximately 6 minutes each.  Each segment is broken down into 3 individual segments: the first is a series of low-impact moves (about 2 minutes 30 seconds), the second takes those same moves and makes them high-impact with some jumping and hopping (about 2 minutes 30 seconds), the third is the power blast which is usually one or two of the moves done at high-impact/intensity (about 45-60 seconds).

Chris's queing is great, letting you know what's coming up so you can make the transition and keep moving.  She has two people exercising with her and the modifier is shown frequently.  They all smile through the entire workout (I bet you won't though!), and I can only image that there's someone off-camera constantly yelling ""keep smiling!"".

You're moving the entire 36 minutes of this workout, even during the transitions between segments when you're marching in place.  It definitely gets your heart rate elevated, and you can increase the intensity by doing the high-impact moves the entire time (you have to remember those on your own, Chris only gives you the high-impact moves during that portion of the segment).  I have also added light hand weights (about 2 pounds) to increase the intensity even more.

I gave this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 only because the DVD should have been set up so that you could design your own workout by selecting the order of the segments and repeating segments to get a longer workout. So the 4 stars instead of 5 is for the functionality of the DVD itself.  The workout is great and merits 5 stars.  You will definitely get results if you do it 3+ times a week.",1296259200,5,1995,4.698275862068965
2733977,5,B000MGBLH8,"I bought this dvd because I wanted to tone my bottom and burn fat. I've been doing it for about a month now, and I can see a difference. I have less cellulite!

I highly recommend this dvd if you're committed to exercising & and want to get rid of cellulite. Just remember it takes time to see results!",1294963200,9,420,4.197530864197531
2733978,5,B000MGBLH8,"This is by far my absolute FAVORITE workout DVD. I purchased it after renting the DVD from netflix and loving it. It includes a warm up, cardio, lower body strength/toning segment, and cool down/stretch. I only do the lower body strength/toning segment which is about 15-20 mins. and it is AMAZING!!!!!! I only do this segment because I am all about toning my lower half, but the other segments are equally good. The instructor is upbeat but not annoying...the workouts are well paced to get a breather or a quick drink if you need it...the directions are very clear and easy to follow, and there are modifications for beginners, etc. IF YOU BUY ANY WORKOUT FOR YOUR BUNS, BUY THIS DVD!!!!!

I've been trying various different workout DVDs and they always seem to be so easy that I end up adding wrist and ankle weights to give me a challenge.  This DVD is certainly challenging!  I got it today and tried it after my normal cardio workout.  After 4 minutes, my thighs and butt felt like they were on fire and I actually had to stop!  I clearly need to build up my muscle in these areas, but I'm going to continue to stick with it and I'm very much looking forward to seeing results!",1289779200,,595,4.230088495575221
2733990,4,B000MGBLH8,"There's just one step on this that I have trouble following, so I improvise there.  Otherwise, a good cardio work-out, easy to follow.  A good challenge without being too much for someone who's in good but not excellent shape.  The Prevention dvd's with Chris Freytag seem to be consistently good products.",1273708800,2,306,4.96078431372549
2733991,4,B000MGBLH8,"This is an awesome workout DVD.  What I like about it...the instructor has a pleasant voice, is not overly hyper, cues well, and the workout left me sweating hard and I didn't even make it through all the cardio before moving on to lower body toning. I like that there is a person to follow if you aren't quite to the high level the instructor is.  I also modify moves when I need to (a knee injury keeps me from doing the low squats and the twists) and just keep going at the pace set and do what I can do when they are doing something I can't.  It is one of the best work out dvds that I've done and that's saying a lot because I own about 30 of them and I've been through and got rid of many times that.
Here is the one thing I don't like about this work out and it's a mistake I think too many workout DVD's make...the wordy descriptions at the beginning of each segment about what is to come.  It interrupts the flow. It's fine the first time you do the workout to get an idea of what is to come and to learn about something but by the time you've done the workout 5-10 times, you get really annoyed to hear the same thing over and over and finding the remote to fast forward just creates a negative energy for me. They need to make a seperate section of the DVD that talks about all that, explains the sections of the DVD and leave it out of the actual workout.  When they make the workout and play it back they need to listen to it and say okay, is this something one would want to hear over and over if they make this workout part of their regular routine?  If the answer is no, leave it out or move it to it's own section of the DVD that you can skip over.",1271635200,,1665,3.984984984984985
2733992,3,B000MGBLH8,"This DVD is in my point of view an old school way to work out.
I only did it once. It is a bit too violent for me. I almost didn't make it in the cardio. I run and dance several times in a week and this DVD is cardio challenging. It is not very fun to do it is hard work. Not really my style. But I am not out of shape and I like to dance and do Pilates based exercises. I you are a bit out of shape or need something more challenging, this is challenging. And you will ""shock your legs"" like another reviewer said. I think that this one gives you a bit too much of muscle legs.",1270512000,,578,3.707317073170732
2733993,5,B000MGBLH8,"This Prevention dvd is one of my favorites! Chris Freytag is encouraging & friendly & you can tell she really wants you to get the most out of this dvd. It has 6 different intervals of various exercises so that helps to keep things from getting boring. Each interval also has one person doing a basic version of the exercise so that when Chris kicks it up, this exerciser stays at a basic level, especially helpful for those just beginning to exercise or those who have been out of the game for a while.  The strength training program also is very good & the combination of the two makes for a wonderful workout.",1268870400,,612,4.415929203539823

I'm now up to doing four intervals and the strength training and have lost 7 pounds and see a big difference in being more toned and having less cellulite.

When I first worked out with this DVD the pace seemed a little too fast, but the steps are easy to fallow and after a few times it didn't seem fast at all.

You can read everybodys review about Chris's work out and how exciting she is.  But I would like to give a personal review on my own body after doing the DVD.  My cellulite had minimized on the front of my legs, I used stand and flex and look down and there it was especially after a shower when it seams most agrivated. Its still there but not as much the potholes are dimishing I think after another 6 months i feel like I will be able to get into shorts again.  The best movement i heard was good for fighting celluilte was consistent movement like jogging and also jumping.  So as for the jumping aspect in the DVD you are off your feet 2.5 minutes 6 times, so if you have cellulite on the back of your calves or poor circulation in your ankles this will take care of it.  I have already seen results in that area as well.  If someone else has also experienced results please post it here.

I am in pretty good shape, have been exercising 6 days a week since I was a teen and now I am 33.(but I am no extreme athlete)  My mom tried this with me (she is in her late 50's) and she does not exercise regularly but she loved this work out as well.  She said she liked it because the moves themselves were easy for her to keep up with and figure out, while giving her a good workout.  She had to stop early, but thats not a bad thing, I mean, if you are not in as good of shape, it will take you a few times then you can build up to it.  Anyway, I absolutely love this.

The second segment is primarily squats and lunges and is really hard on the knees, so be wary. I wish she would have done some other butt shaping exercises other than endless squats.

I do a lot of DVD workouts, and the cardio section in this DVD is demanding and original. There is also a 15 minute toning section that is quite demanding.

2734049,4,B000MGBLH8,"I really enjoy this video.  I am always looking for new stuff and I love this one.  I am intermediate/experienced and need variety.  I was surprised at how much her intervals challenged me.  Chris F. is an excellent instructor, makes me wonder why I never tried Prevention workouts before.  The extras are great also because they taught me great info on cellulite.  If you need great cardio and toning, this is the way to go!",1196294400,2,425,4.6
2734050,1,B000MGBLH8,"I was hoping for something new and different.  Well,  this is definately the same old exercises that I steer clear from, they overdevelop my quads. I don't see how the strength portion of the DVD gets rid of cellulite.

Chris Freytag may be an awesome personal trainer and have a tight and toned body, but if she anticipates making any more choreographed cardio segments she needs to learn how to be with the music.  I just couldn't do the cardio part because it was off the beat.  And, the combos are not easy to follow, the patterns are not logical.  Sorry I have nothing good to say.  I am an aerobics instructor , so I know my subject well.",1196208000,16,644,4.361344537815126
2734051,4,B000MGBLH8,"This is a combination of one 36-minute high-energy cardio workout and one 15-minute targeted strength routine, in addition to a 4-minute warm up and a 4 minute cool down, designed to burn calories and minimize the appearance of cellulite.

The cardio workout offers six 5-minute routines designed to elevate your heart rate and get you burning calories.  The lower-body strength routine focuses on toning and tightening your hips, thighs and buttocks with the use of medium weighted (5-8lbs) hand weights for added resistance.  Both workouts can be done separately or together for a total body workout.  As with all the Prevention workouts, there is a participant who demonstrates the modified versions of the routines and Chris's cuing is flawless.

One of the things I appreciate about the Prevention workouts are the Smart Ways To Live Well bonus segments.  In What is Cellulite?, a doctor breaks down the two types of cellulite, why we women have more of it, and how we can reduce it. In Break It Down, Chris explains the lower-body moves that one might have a bit of trouble with.  Finally, in Attack Arm Flab, Chris demonstrates four moves designed to firm up those flabby upper arms: the Tricep Overhead Extension; the Tricep Kickback; the Hammer Curl; and the Push-Up.

Highly recommended.",1193616000,14,1297,5.02803738317757
2734052,5,B000MGBLH8,"I'm a big fan of prevention dvd's...and this dvd's is one of my favorite cardio work-outs. I exercise a lot and this dvd manages to get me sweating. It's got an awsome toning section, and yes there are many squats, lunges, plies and curtsies. Your thight and but will look awsome in no time with this one. Chris Freytag is great in this dvd as all her others...great motivation.

2734053,5,B000MGBLH8,"I am very pleased with this video.  In the cardio segment, I like that there are 6 different intervals (about 6 minutes each)....it helps to keep your workout from getting monotonous.  Plus, I like the varying of intensity in each interval.  The toning segment is also great and is definitely challenging.",1191542400,,305,4.9411764705882355
2734054,5,B000MGBLH8,"I own a few of the Prevention Fitness System DVDs and this is by far the best.  The cardio is great.  I am a intermediate/advanced exerciser and it gets my heart rate up.  At 40 minutes it is a good length.  The toning is only 15 minutes or so but gets the legs and butt to burn a bit.  I would get this for the cardio.  You don't need too much room axcept in the first interval, but you can always modify.  As always Chris is great with queuing and gives you time to get used to the move before adding on.  She is one of the least annoying fitness instructors out there.",1184284800,26,571,3.9911504424778763
2734055,4,B000MGBLH8,"This is one of the better fitness DVD's I have purchased.  Consistant, upbeat, the rarity of actually working the left and the right evenly, (most videos don't from the ones I have purchased in the past.)  Good for all levels, acutally points out on more than one occasion the person doing the lower impact and lower intensity moves.  Not for the weak kneed.  Really gets the heart rate going, like the fact that it is done in interval style, so you actually can get the fat burning effect.  Wide variety of movements, not just your squats and lunges.  Chris isn't overly exuberant, overly chipper, nor is her personality cold.  She does try to stay informative, encouraging and doesn't make false promises during the workout.  What kept me from giving it a 5,  Chris seems to be out of breath already during the warmup, some of her chit-chat can be annoying, (but there is not one tape out there whose instructor doesn't hit a nerve on some days,) really wish the stretches were held longer during the cool down.  Will definately look into some of the other ones she has out.",1182124800,17,1076,4.61578947368421
2734056,5,B000MGBLH8,"This is a great workout!  Press the ""Play all"" and you get a great 60 minute work out.  The six intervales really get your heart pumping and make you sweat and this is what takes off the pounds, along with a healthy diet.  The strength training segment is also done very well.  In order to reach your weight loss goals you have to make the commitment to exercise.

After having my second child, I put on 55 pounds more than I wanted to.  I work out each day in the early AM, following high aerobic DVD's.  I changed my way of eating, more fruits and veges, lean meats, cut out white flour and cut way back on white sugar.  I have lost the extra 55 lbs of baby weight, and an additional 20 lbs!  I feel better than ever!

Great job again Chris, I would recommend any of your workouts!",1179360000,16,783,4.16
2734057,5,B000MGBLH8,"Chris Freytag, lead in many Prevention videos, zeroes in on one of the most illusive problems shared by tons of women---- cellulite.  Her video attacks the problem through exercise and strength training then the problem is adequately discussed in a special section of the video.  Well thought out video and super exercise guru.

I would say it is for the intermediate exerciser. There were a couple of moves that were hard to follow since she doesn't stop and explain how to do the moves but there is a section on the dvd that you can go to, to help you learn the moves. I didn't do that since I was in the middle of the workout and didn't want to stop.
