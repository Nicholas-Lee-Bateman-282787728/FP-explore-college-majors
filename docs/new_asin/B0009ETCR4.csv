2284381,1,B0009ETCR4,"Oh, how precious, another-little-film-that-could!  Except, this couldn't, and shouldn't.  I got about 30 minutes into this cheese-fest and changed channels.  One of the first characters that's introduced to us drove me up the wall nearly instantaneously -- the personification of quirky, donning her h-i-l-a-r-i-o-u-s oh-so-silly hat and $3.99 Wallmart platform flip-flop, if I ran into on the street I would run in the other direction as fast as possible.  Other unbelievable and irritating characters quickly follow.
The storytelling folksy music, some of the worst dialogue ever committed to screen,  acting which veers from average to laughably bad, and characters that ring untrue, this is an absurd movie and worth skipping.",1278460800,2,730,5.6
2284382,5,B0009ETCR4,"Yes, there is a predictability to it, and the broken, collaged story lines are a little frustrating in the beginning.  But the film delivers - it is deceptive and warps our sense of time.  Its power is in its understatement; and, the divine spontaneity that brings the characters together as you know the plot is destined to do.",1245456000,,328,4.637931034482759
2284383,5,B0009ETCR4,"Stay with this movie. It moves slowly, as you move into the lives of the participants.  In an era of one hundred million dollar movies, special effects, sex, and endless violence, it is a touchstone of humanity. It will make you smile.",1163289600,7,235,4.595238095238095
2284384,5,B0009ETCR4,"Interesting look at how the lives of complete strangers intertwine.  Even though most day-to-day interaction is very casual, we all have lives with great depth.  This movie calls attention to the diamonds we discover when we get the chance to establish deeper relationships. The true stuff that makes life worth living.  Likable characters struggling with their flaws in hopes of new opportunites.  Watch it with someone you hope to get to know better.",1162771200,3,452,5.1506849315068495
2284385,3,B0009ETCR4,"Here's the second-most common genre of film being produced -- the New York movie, second only to the L.A. movie. In this one, five disparate people end up in New York for somewhat related reasons. Only one of these actors, Alan King, has any star power and is a name you may recall from your past if you are of a certain age or if you watch ""GoodFellas"" every time it's on.

Eric Schaeffer's portrait of troubled people coming from different compass points to New York is a largely sympathetic portrayal of people from all kinds of backgrounds and ethnicity. In other words, it was made to show there was something for everyone in the movie.

One of these people is a 70-year-old meandering around the city in dangerous places on his way to a destination; another is a quirky woman that spent her life caring for her bitter and dying mother; still another is, again, a quirky woman, a street singer with a bad heart looking to make good; a fourth is a black man seeking absolution for wrecking his marriage; the fifth is a man and his son seeking resolution of the father's past life. They all end up in New York in the end on their way to someone or something.

This movie tries to care for all these people and tries to show the goodness that exists in everyone, even among the midst of depression, death and defeat. The optimism of the ending follows a lot of heartbreak and grief throughout, creating an old school, old world film that harkens back to a time when emotion was what moviemaking was all about.

You'll probably like a lot of what's going on in this movie and, if you are a New Yorker, you may be able to identify with some of the action or locales. Otherwise you will like some of the characters, who come off as real people -- albet ""New York-ized"" for the screen, if you will -- and drag along with them their real problems.

My undying wish is that someday, somewhere, a filmmaker will make one of these movies about a city other than the big two and get out of this parochial fix. There might be 50 million Americans on the two coasts but there are 250 million of us living elsewhere seeking representation.",1161302400,15,2129,4.420918367346939
2284386,4,B0009ETCR4,"What happens when you title a movie ""Mind the Gap"" and lead the credits with Alan King? Few people under seventy become interested. But this is a great movie about life, relationships, and ""the gap"".

Jill Souble is darn cute, and the overall acting good to great. King did his usual pro job too.",1156636800,5,296,4.481481481481482
2284387,5,B0009ETCR4,"Filmed on a stringent budget and time schedule, ""Mind the Gap"" is a brilliant ensemble piece that follows 5 life stories in a heart-warming, life-affirming web of coincidence. Director Eric Shaeffer, who also plays the part of Sam, has woven this magical tale into a film I will never forget. It is a love song to life, and it is also about courage. The courage to do the things that result in a life lived without regrets.

The cast is superb. Alan King plays a cantankerous old man on a mission, and this was sadly to be his last film. Elizabeth Reaser plays Melissa, a young woman born of a rape, who has a heart full of strength and love. Reaser is luminous, a beauty that will no doubt be a superstar in the near future. Christopher Kovaleski is Rocky, Sam's gangling, bright and shining son, who is a delight to watch. Singer Jill Sobule is Jody, a petite dynamo with an extraordinary talent as a songwriter and as an actress, and the film features many of her songs. Charles Parnell is incredibly moving as John, a man despondent over his divorce. There are many other great performances too numerous to name individually, all of them memorable characters, played to perfection, and the thread around them is Julio Diaz, the Times Square salsa dancing man.

Watch this film several times, and you will see its many layered quality, revealing more with each viewing. It is a quirky, beautiful, warm, and lovable film, and deserves one's time and attention.  Filmed on location in New York City and Vermont by Marc Blandori, the music is by Veigar Margeisson, with some mystical, lovely selections by Krishna Das. The DVD extra is the commentary for the film, which is chatty and informative, and total running time is 130 minutes.",1124928000,37,1736,4.685245901639345
2284388,4,B0009ETCR4,"Though I've not seen this one - I know it will be incredible.  For those of you who've not ""experienced"" his movie - FALL - please do so.  It is a truly wonderful movie.  As the other reviewer stated about the music in Mind the Gap, the music from Fall is, too - simply wonderful.  The singer is Amanda Kravat formerly of the group Marry Me Jane.  Also - check out Schaeffer's movie, ""Never Again"" w/Jeffrey Tambor, Jill Clayburne and Bill Duke.  You will scream with laughter.",1123632000,5,477,4.425287356321839
2284389,4,B0009ETCR4,"This is a terrific film by Eric Schaeffer, who also stars in this ensemble piece in the tradition/spirit of the better Robert Altman films.  Every scene makes sense.  The performances are all excellent, including a wonderful job by the late great Alan King, one of the best American talents of the past half century.  This is a movie well worth seeing. See it yourself and be surprised as I was.",1121731200,12,395,4.614285714285714

8059700,5,B0009ETCR4,"This film never made it back to me after I loaned it out some time ago.  I first discovered it while looking for a movie to rent at Blockbuster (when there were Blockbusters).  I saw it on the shelf, never heard of it and rented it without knowing anything about it.

I love this movie!!!",1412467200,,288,4.2
8059701,5,B0009ETCR4,I love the movie. It is a sleeper with several interconnected story lines. I don't want to give anything away. So refreshing to have fully developed characters and a well thought out story line.,1404432000,,194,4.735294117647059
8059702,5,B0009ETCR4,"Eric Shaffer is one of my favorite directors.  Sharp, raw, and real! A great movie and hands down the best ensemble film ever! Underrated!",1391385600,,138,4.75
8059703,5,B0009ETCR4,"10/30/13  Well, we, my fiance and I are reviewing this together, we thought this was wonderful!  We see reviews from some who apparently just thought this was a horrible group of stories and we cannot figure out how they see it that way, but that is their opinion which they are entitled to.

We just enjoyed this tremendously.  It is very creatively done and probably we all know people like or similar to the characters in this collection of stories.  This dramatization of peoples lives and what they go through emotionally is probably quite accurate.  We thought the music was fabulous.  We are familiar with Jill Sobule as a singer and musician...not as an actress...but she did a fine job with her part.  There is some very interesting music used in this production, but it does not appear that a sound track was produced for purchase for this film.

We definitely recommend giving this film a try.  We viewed it via Netflix, however, obviously it is available for purchase.",1383091200,,980,4.745562130177515
8059704,5,B0009ETCR4,"I liked the story lines, and the music in this movie.  I think this movie has appeal to families, single adults and older people.  i think it also would be a nice conversation starter.",1369008000,,184,4.382352941176471
8059705,5,B0009ETCR4,Had seen this movie on cable and could not find it again.  I highly recommend this movie.  It is not your typical movie and is thought provoking.,1353888000,,145,4.333333333333333
8059706,5,B0009ETCR4,"I was given this film to watch because my friend wanted my opinion.  At first, I felt like some of the reviewers here, unmoved and annoyed by these quirky characters, and confused by how we would spend so little time with one and then be jutted off to another.  After about 20 minutes, however, I began to change my mind.  I suddenly saw that we were being given a vision of how life actually is beneath the surface.  I know, I know, some of the more cynical find this impossible!  I say, to them, lighten up, and get out of your head, it is not as large as you imagine it to be.  Grow a heart, for it is much more intelligent!  Great acting, and music too.  And Krishna Das brings an even more mystical feeling to the film.  I ended up loving it which honestly surprises me.  I will watch it again, perhaps to see it for the first time.",1335398400,2,837,4.142857142857143
