8561950,4,B00B361FTK,"Wrestlemania 9 was a significant of firsts and lasts. For starters, it was the first Wrestlemania to take place outdoors, emanating from Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada with an interesting Roman Empire/toga theme. It was the Wrestlemania where good ole J.R made his WWF debut, and it was the last Wrestlemania Bobby Heenan would be a part of until 2001 as he would leave the company later that year. Now that you know all the interesting facts and trivia, lets delve into the show!

To really play up the Roman Empire theme, the show kicks off with an ""opening ceremony"" as Howard Finkel introduces ""Caesar and Cleopatra"". Randy Savage comes out next, being carried to the ringside area on a royal sedan, followed by Bobby Heenan who hilariously rides to the ring backwards on a camel.

1.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Shawn Michaels (c) w/Luna Vachon vs Tatanka w/Sensational Sherri

This was the first PPV since becoming his manager that Sherri did not manage Shawn Michaels after causing her to get hit with a mirror a few months prior at the Royal Rumble. This was Michaels' second year opening Wrestlemania as a heel and by this time, he was really cementing himself as being one of the best heels the company had at the time. This was a terrific opening match that was very fast paced as both men displayed great agility. The end of the match is a bit confusing and shady as Michaels throws the referee out of the ring and he and Tatanka get into a short scuffle before getting back in the ring. Just as Tatanka hits a Samoan drop on Michaels and goes for the pinfall, the referee gets back in in the ring and instead of making the count, rings the bell to signal for the end of the match. The referee weirdly awards Tatanka the match via countout but Tatanka is mad about not winning the title. Somewhat of a disappointing ending to an otherwise spectacular fast paced match. Luna attacks Sherri after the match and Tatanka chases her off.

2.) The Headshrinkers vs The Steiner Brothers

We follow up with some fairly good tag team action. J.R. says this match will be a slobberknocker which was his first time using the term that would become much more popular throughout the 90s. Scott Steiner gets worked over most of the match by the Headshrinkers and took some pretty nasty shots during such as getting launched almost face first out of the ring and getting hit in the back of the head with a sick bamboo shot. Rick Steiner ends up getting the tag and gets set up for an LOD Doomsday Device like double team move, but just as Samu comes off the top for a clothesline, Rick reverses it mid-air with a powerslam in an impressive counter. Rick tags Scott back in and he and Samu brawl on the outside, while Scott hits somewhat of a botched Frankensteiner on Fatu for the win. Impressive and competitive tag team bout!

3.) Crush vs Doink the Clown

Mene Gene Okerlund conducts a pre-match interview with Doink who criticizes Doink for his antics and attacks on Crush. I must say that Doink was an amazing and creepy heel for the early 90s. His heel persona pretty much reminded me of one of those creepy, psychotic clowns you'd find in a 80s/90s horror film. The match starts with Crush chasing Doink around the ring before catching up to him and attacking him at ringside and throws him in the ring. Crush controls Doink in the early minutes of the match with lots of powerhouse moves but Doink comes back with some offense. Doink ""accidentally"" back hands the referee, knocking him out for the time being, leading to a second Doink coming from under the ring and nails Crush with a prosthetic arm before retreating back under the ring. The real Doink covers Crush and the referee revives to make the 3 count fall.

4.) Razor Ramon vs Bob Backlund

This was the first Wrestlemania for both Backlund and Razor. Razor was the heel going into this match while Backlund was the face, but it seemed not many cared about Backlund anymore as he got little to no reaction and even a few minor boos while Razor got cheered and even got some chants from fans during the match. This match was a quick one. After a little bit of back and forth action, Razor gets the win with an inside cradle pin. Short match, not much to be said about it, other than the fact that this was simply to put Razor over

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Mene Gene interviews Money Inc. about their upcoming match with Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake and says their chances don't look good. Dibiase and IRS give a basic heel promo on Hogan, Beefcake, and Jimmy Hart, and IRS hints that Hogan had an ""accident"" leaving the gym last night and proclaims they'll beat both their faces in

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: Money Inc. (IRS and Ted Dibiase) (c) vs The Mega-Maniacs (Brutus Beefcake and Hulk Hogan) w/Jimmy Hart

The match starts with Money Inc trying to attack the Mega-Maniacs as they enter the ring but their attack backfires. Beefcake in a yellow face mask to sell the injury he suffered from Money Inc starts the match with IRS, who works over Beefcake before making the tag to Dibiase. Eventually the favor starts to steer in the Mega-Maniacs favor as Hogan and Beefcake display great teamwork and work over. Money Inc try to get counted out but referee Earl Hebner has it announced that if they're counted out, they'll lose the titles. This brings Money Inc back to the ring and the match continues. Hogan gets worked over for the second half of the match by IRS and Dibiase. Just as Dibiase has Hogan out with the Million Dollar Dream, both Beefcake and IRS jump in the ring at the same time to try and interfere. Hebner focuses on IRS, allowing Beefcake to temporarily put Dibiase out with a sleeper hold. With both Hogan and Dibiase down and out, they slowly recover and make the tags to Beefcake and IRS. Beefcake's momentum is cut short when he's hit from behind with IRS's briefcase by Dibiase. Dibiase gets tagged in and rips off Beefcake's mask and he and IRS both begin working over the his injured face. Hogan gets the tag and takes out Money Inc and the ref ends up going down during the chaos. Hogan nails Money Inc with Beefcake's mask and the Mega-Maniacs pin Money Inc. The referee was slow to revive so Jimmy Hart takes over and counts the 3 count fall for the Mega-Maniacs. Moments later, the shady referee that was in the Michaels/Tatanka match comes in and DQs the Mega-Maniacs and awards Money Inc the match. Jimmy Hart assaults the referee after the match and the Mega Maniacs celebrate in the ring. Great match! But unfortunately Hogan's night was just getting started....

6.) Lex Luger vs Mr. Perfect

Lex Luger made his Wrestlemania debut here with an impressive entrance featuring scantily clad women and light up mirrors. This was a highly competitive and aggressive match between Perfect and Luger. Probably Luger's best match (behind his Wrestlemania bout the following year with Bret Hart) he had in his entire career. In the end Luger gets the win with a backslide pin but Perfect's feet were on the ropes which the referee never saw. After the match, Perfect argues with the referee about the finish and ends up getting laid out by Luger with the steel plate forearm. Perfect revives moments later and angrily tracks down Luger in the backstage area and attacks him. Shawn Michaels gets involved and takes out Perfect with a trash can and continues to beat down on him before having to be separated by referees and officials. Macho Man and Bobby Heenan get into it about the altercation and comes close to getting physical but J.R plays peacemaker

7.) Giant Gonzalez w/Harvey Wippleman vs The Undertaker w/Paul Bearer

This is where the PPV begins to dwindle. The Undertaker in his third Wrestlemania appearance takes on the 8 foot tall Giant Gonzalez in his first. The Undertaker had an impressive entrance that featured him coming to the ring aided by a vulture. It'd be the first of many ominous and cool entrances Undertaker would have at Wrestlemania. This was the first time that The Undertaker really had an opponent who was a threat to him and could likely topple him. This match was nothing impressive and nothing to get excited about as the entire match was mostly just strikes and wear down holds. All 7 minutes of it. Gonzalez ends up stuffing a chloroform soaked rag in Undertaker's face and knocks him unconscious to get DQ'd. The Undertaker is rolled out on a stretcher but returns shortly after to a large pop from the Caesar's Palace crowd and takes out Gonzalez with a series of flying clotheslines. So Undertaker goes 3-0 via DQ and the match is over. Horrible match with no significance about it. Luckily it was a short match so no one really suffered from having to endure it for a long time but still. It's considered by many to be the worst match of Undertaker's entire streak and I don't blame them. Sure his match with Big Boss Man, King Kong Bundy, Sycho Sid, and Big Show/A-Train were bad but it wasn't Giant Gonzalez bad.

Mene Gene Okerlund interviews Hulk Hogan about his thoughts on the WWF Championship match and tells Bret he and the Hulkamaniacs are on his side and says he wants the first shot at the title from the winner of the match. The interview did a bit of foreshadowing at what was to come to close the PPV...

8.) WWF Championship Match: Yokozuna w/Mr. Fuji vs Bret Hart (c)

In what was Bret Hart's first of 3 Wrestlemania main events, the Hitman met the 400 lb Yokozuna. And similar to Undertaker's match with Gonzalez, it was Bret's first biggest challenge in the company. Bret gets in some shots here and there on Yokozuna, but for the most part Yokozuna controlled Bret for most of the match. Bret manages to take Yoko down with a few clotheslines but Yoko pretty much no-sells them. The crowd chants ""USA"" at one point, despite Bret being Canadian. Bret accidentally takes the padding off one of the turnbuckles and slams Yoko's head into it following a counter. Bret struggles but manages to get the Sharpshooter in on Yokozuna but Mr. Fuji comes around and throws salt in the Hitman's eyes. Yokozuna takes advantage and pins Bret with ease to win the match and the championship. After the match, Hogan comes to the ring and checks on Bret. Mr. Fuji gets on the microphone and challenges Hogan to a match for Yokozuna's WWF Championship. Hogan accepts and you already know where this is going......

9.) WWF Championship Match: Hulk Hogan vs Yokozuna (c) w/Mr. Fuji

Hogan enters the ring and is jumped immediately by Yokozuna. Yokozuna holds Hogan back and Mr. Fuji attempts to throw salt in Hogan's face, but Hogan escapes and the salt flies into Yoko's eyes instead. Hogan knocks Yokozuna down with a clothesline and follows it up with a Leg Drop. 1, 2, 3 winner and new WWF Champion, Hulk Hogan. Hulk Hogan wins yet another championship, ending Yokozuna's in less than 5 minutes as well as being the first one to pin and cleanly defeat Yokozuna. Wrestlemania 9 goes off the air with Hulk Hogan celebrating with the championship. This would be the last Wrestlemania Hulk Hogan would be a part of until 2002's Wrestlemania 18.

Overall: In my opinion Wrestlemania 9 is highly underrated. Way too many people give it low ratings and say it's bad but I don't think it's as bad as most people make it out to be. Most of the matches were fairly good. The PPV didn't really start to drag until Gonzalez vs Taker which was towards the end of the PPV. Really, I'm willing to overlook the horrendous Undertaker vs Giant Gonzalez. I'm not however, willing to overlook the overrated Hulk Hogan being the first one to cleanly beat Yokozuna. There was absolutely no reason for Hogan to win the match nor be associated with this main event in any way, shape, or form, especially considering the fact that he left the company for WCW just 2 months later.r Bret should've been the one to go over Yokozuna but I guess Vince didn't see it that way. Overall, Wrestlemania 9 was a good PPV---minus the ending",1428364800,2,13126,5.133489461358314
8561951,2,B00B361FTK,"WrestleMania 9 is prominently know for two things: the spectacular pageantry that the WWF made out of the event with their toga party motif and Hulk Hogan winning the WWF Title in nine seconds from Yokozuna after Yoko had dispatched Bret Hart. Neither aspect is a fondly remembered part of WrestleMania's legacy nor does the rest of the event hold up once you look past the silliness.

There were several bad matches on the show, including a comedy match between Doink and Kona Crush, an all together too short bout from Razor Ramon and Bob Backlund, a tepid Tag Team Titles match with Hogan making Money, Inc. look terrible, and, of course, a horrid match between the Undertaker and Giant Gonzalas. None of these matches are worth watching, mostly because they were either too short or outright bad wrestling.

There were a few solid matches on the show like Shawn Michaels/Tatanka, Hennig/Luger, and Hart/Yokozuna; however, none of them are must watch bouts. Hart and Yoko's main event is hurt by a truncated runtime (Yoko cut it short after getting gassed in the first eight minutes) and the infamous Hulk Hogan incident that ended the show with Hulk presiding as the Heavyweight Champion.

My favorite match on the show is a stiff-as-crazy tag bout with the Steiner Brothers and the Headshrinkers beating the crap out of each other for fourteen minutes. A very fun match that was stiffer and more impactful than was typically seen in the Federation at the time.

While this isn't the worst 'Mania, I can't find anything overly memorable on the show. About the only thing anyone recalls from this one is that Hulk Hogan somehow walks out with the top title in the promotion after defeating the company's top bad guy in less than a minute. I can't say that bodes well for he event's notoriety.",1427500800,,1795,4.780645161290322

8561953,4,B00B361FTK,"I choose this rating because 1993 Was a good time for wrestling.
I liked all the matches solid matches but the Hulk Hogan match bored me.

8561954,3,B00B361FTK,"A couple of notes here in that this is the exact same version of this event taken from the WrestleMania Anthology set meaning that all references to ""WWF"" & various music has been changed to due the rights expiring but there is no blurring of the WWF logo since this event happened before the ""Attitude Era.""

WWE went back in time as WrestleMania IX was held in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace for what they termed as the ""World's Largest Toga Party"" that featured various animals from exotic birds to elephants, roman soldiers, Caesar & Cleopatra, and with the unforgettable entrance of Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan while it should also be noted that this was the first ever WrestleMania after the debut of ""Monday Night RAW."" This event also featured the WrestleMania debuts of various superstars & legends like Jim Ross, Luna Vachon, Steiner Brothers, Scott ""Razor Ramon"" Hall, Bob Backlund, and Yokozuna.

The WWE Championship was defended by Bret Hart against Yokozuna but was most memorable for what happened afterwords that resulted in history being made while the other main event featured the return after a year of Hulk Hogan teaming with Brutus Beefcake challenging Tag Team Champions Money Inc. in what would end up being Hogan's last WrestleMania for close to a decade. Other matches include Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Tatanka, Steiner Brothers vs. Headshrinkers, Crush vs. Doink The Clown where everyone ended up having ""double vision"", Bob Backlund vs. Razor Ramon, Mr. Perfect's last WrestleMania match vs. Lex Luger, and Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales.

The in-ring product was really suffering at this time as the best matches on the card where the first two opening ones while the other matches were either solid at best, served their purpose, or just very short so I would just suggest that fans of this era check this one out but everyone else can skip it.",1364601600,,1887,4.965189873417722
