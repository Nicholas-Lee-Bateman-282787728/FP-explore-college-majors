886773,5,6304468164,"You'll LOVE ""The Joy of Stress"" DVD by Loretta LaRoche!  She is a very dynamic speaker and draws one in from the moment she starts speaking until the minute she stops.  Her sense of humor keeps you laughing and teaches one that life is to be lived -- not to be spent in pessimism.  Look at the positive side of life!  Laugh -- and see how much better you feel.  If you can possibly watch this DVD and not laugh, then I recommend seeing a doctor because your funny bone is broken!  She's awesome.  You want to decrease stress in your life -- buy ""The Joy of Stress"" today!",1194480000,,571,4.18348623853211
886774,5,6304468164,This was hilarious and really does point out what stress can do to you and how to overcome it!  I used the video in my staff meeting and it was a huge success.  I think we'll watch it yearly just to keep it fresh in our memories!  I'd highly recommend this video.,1168560000,8,263,4.019230769230769
886775,5,6304468164,I am a mental health therapist and I used this video  with my counseling groups.  They gave the video  rave reviews.,1122076800,11,116,4.428571428571429
886776,1,6304468164,"Many people find Loretta Laroche (the presentor in this video) very funny, but personally I found her extremely irritating and annoying.  Her loud whiny nasal tone really got under my skin.  I did not laugh once throughout the entire video.

None of what she said is original.  There is nothing surprising about the fact 75% of peoples conversations tend to be negative and what you say and act like affects how effectively you can deal with stress.  If you walk around the place complaining and sighing, chances are stress will get the best of you.  The way you see yourself is often the same way others will see you.  We also already know that laughter and finding humor in things helps us cope with stress better.  What Loretta Laroche said in this video could have been summarized and presented in a ten minute talk.

Everything in my day was going just fine until I watched this awful video.",1102809600,2,896,4.620253164556962
886777,5,6304468164,The video is funny. It points out and pokes fun at the irrational beliefs and attitudes that amplify stress.,940377600,6,108,4.7368421052631575
886897,5,6304468164,"Actually, this is about the 5th one I have ordered since the late 70s when it first came out in VHS.  All through the years I've used Loretta's presentation to show at staff meetings when I was working, and to share with friends and family; especially, so to bring smiles to faces that are going through some difficult times - Loretta's material makes you see everything with a different perspective; makes you see the big picture and worry less about the trivial, mundane issues we wrestle with on a daily basis.",1429488000,,513,4.637362637362638
886898,5,6304468164,"So funny - great for office environments to watch together. She has a great outlook on life and helps to reinforce that you shouldn't take everything so seriously. It may be old, but the stories and everything are still easy to relate to 20 years later.",1428451200,,253,4.521739130434782

886963,1,6304468164,Some of the information was valuable and slightly entertaining; however the DVD content is incredibly dated - looks like it was made 20 years ago. Overall - disappointing.,1292889600,,171,5.142857142857143

Instead, it was was just a stand up comedy routine.

I didn't get it just to hear jokes.

Not helpful at all",1252800000,,223,3.911111111111111
886966,5,6304468164,"I think EVERYONE would love this video. I purchased ""The Joy of Stress"" to inspire my fellow coworkers to relax a bit during an upsetting transition we were enduring. I scheduled a small meeting and it turned out to be a great team building experience that brought us closer together during such a difficult time. I was so impressed that I even purchased a second copy to share with my family as I feel laughter is the best medicine!
I also brought along some props for the meeting, a few pair of groucho glasses, one tiara, a viking hat, and a few stress relieving grippers and of course some snacks. This video was a hit and was so enjoyable to me and my coworkers that I highly recommend it to anyone!

(side note) It was also funny to see our personalities reaching for the props, it turned out that the personalities fit our chosen prop and made us laugh at ourselves.

Thank You Loretta!",1234137600,,893,4.439024390243903
886967,5,6304468164,I would recommend this to anyone--man or woman--who has not laughed in a day or so. I am 60 and enjoyed her work and played it for adult women in their 20's and they appreciated it as well.,1207353600,,189,4.0

7872578,5,6304468164,I LOL and clapped and learned a lot about stress and laughter.  Loretta La Roche is like a cross between a caring psychologist and a stand-up comedian.  The info and her delivery is timeless.  I can't wait to get her other DVD's.,1504915200,,229,4.404761904761905
