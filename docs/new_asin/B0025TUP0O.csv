8351165,3,B0025TUP0O,"I did enjoy watching this DVD.  Unfortunately, the 'references' towards Islam and Muslim life as a way out of gang life was unexpected and a little disturbing. Nevertheless, the view is left with an honest portrayal of the rise and fall of a gangster; a side the public really doesn't get a true picture of. Good for parents to see.  Would not recommend for the 'under 18' set.",1295913600,,377,4.529411764705882
