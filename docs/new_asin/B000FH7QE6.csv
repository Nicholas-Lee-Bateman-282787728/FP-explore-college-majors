8122528,5,B000FH7QE6,"Bill Fields was always working out his personal matters on screen. One almost constant in his comedies is an overbearing wife and obnoxious family, these based on an angry estranged wife of several decades and young son (Claude) whose head was filled with hatred (by mom) of a father he never knew.

Another is one of W.C.'s fantasies, that of a loving and devoted daughter. Even going back to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/POPPY/dp/B000LC4C0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">POPPY</a>&nbsp;on Broadway, this element was a constant.

In MAN ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE (1935) we have that young lady, plus Bill's most troublesome family of all: a battleax wife, a shrewish mother-in-law and Claude, an effeminate, fat, lazy, sneak thief good-for-nil, back-stabbing brother-in-law, played by Grady Sutton, later Og Ogilby in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-BANK-DICK/dp/B00004TX1R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE BANK DICK</a>&nbsp;(1940). In Simon Louvish's exhaustive Fields bio&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MAN-ON-THE-FLYING-TRAPEZE/dp/0393318400/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MAN ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE</a>, W.C.'s son, Claude Fields admits he was hurt by having this despicable character bear his name. Claude also wanted the world to know he wasn't effeminate (no addressing the other character flaws).

Given no screen credit here is Carla Monti as W.C.'s secretary. Monti was his mistress for many years and was with him when Bill died on Christmas Day 1946. Without the support of Fields she never would have been in movies, for Monti's acting was very wooden and amateurish.

Not so Kathleen Howard as the repulsive Leona Wolfinger, wife of Ambrose. Howard is perfect as the little woman you'd love to throttle and is arguably the best of several who served this role in Fields comedies. Vera Lewis as Cordelia Neselrode, the hatchet-faced mom-in-law is equally offensive to even the dullest of sensibilities.

Also here in an early basement break-in sequence are Fields film regular Tammany Young (as 'Willie' the Weasel) and a very young Walter Brennan ('Legs' Garnett). The two get bombed on some of Ambrose's illegal ""applejack,"" poured straight from the wooden barrel, and launch into an inebriated ""Banks of the Wabash."" This awakens Mrs. Wolfinger, who hounds her reluctant husband into investigating what's going on in the cellar. By the time Ambrose arrives with a loud crash and fall onto a giant nail, a local patrolman has handcuffed the two trespassers and he's joined them in their cups and serenade. Ambrose soon makes this offkey trio a drunken quartet. His overloud warbling is worst of all.

Finally, a bright spot of our story. Mary Brian, aka ""the Sweetest Girl in Pictures,"" had a history with Fields dating back to the stage and a couple of now lost silent screen failures. She has the beloved daughter part down pat, and proves to be her dad's savior in the end.

Bill's standard format of a man beset and oppressed who overcomes all to be triumphant, which usually means falling into money, applies here. ""Trapeze"" is nothing less than a comedy classic.",1375142400,2,3208,5.755274261603375
8122529,5,B000FH7QE6,Wonderful - my husband is thrilled with this purchase.  Very hard to find DVD is now part of his collection. Great service - thanks again.,1354924800,,138,4.52
8122530,5,B000FH7QE6,"WC Fields is at his best in this hilarious comedy about a henpecked, socially abused man who just wants a day off for once. He's a memory expert who has all the files regarding the clients of the company he works for all in his head - which means he can't be fired. But he hasn't had a day off in 25 years, so invents a story that his mother-in-law has died (poisoned) and he must attend the funeral. His real goal is to go to a wrestling match. Lots of crazy things happen, some of the best being the drunken sing-along with burglars who've broken into his homemade hooch in the basement, sharing a jail cell with a scissors murderer, and all the delays he encounters going to the wrestling match - not to mention the wrestler himself. Fields puts all his family tormentors in their place by the end - a most satisfying conclusion. Fields is great here, but so is the supporting cast, especially Kathleen Howard as his wife. A Hollywood comedy classic, and a WC Fields gem.",1162512000,,974,4.386740331491713
8122531,5,B000FH7QE6,"I first saw this movie in the late 1970s on television, and fortunately I taped it -- but unfortunately, it was on a BetaMax!  I must have watched it 15-20 times over the years, before the BetaMax broke.  This has become one of my favorite classic comedies, just as funny as It's a Gift and The Bank Dick.  It has not been available commercially until recently, so I bought a copy immediately when it came out.

The classic stereotypes are all there: shrewish wife, batty mother in law, doltish brother in law, devoted daughter by a previous marriage ... and many others.  Plus the absolutely fabulous ""burglars singing in the cellar"" sequence.

Listen for ""why would the maternity hospital be calling YOU??""

Good ole WC suffers indignity after indignity -- with uncommon grace -- and I think you'll very much like the ending!  I won't give it away.

I can tell you without hesitation:  if you like W.C. Fields in classic comedies, then you will like -- maybe even love as I do -- Man on the Flying Trapeze.

BTW:  There is no trapeze in the movie.  Go figure!

(P.S. For vintage car buffs, there are lots of close ups of cars of the 1920's and 30's, in what appears to be Los Angeles.)",1149724800,5,1187,4.485981308411215
