8297374,2,B001EAWMDI,"This film is not at all what I expected it to be.  The entire first half is a presentation promoting Las Vegas in general, and, more specifically, the MGM Grand's production of EFX.  If I wanted the design, technology and construction details behind the EFX show, I would have purchased a ""making of"" video.  Granted, there is a dialogue with Michael Crawford throughout which has him onscreen for a total of maybe 10 minutes, and he is -- indeed -- charming.  There are also very short clips of some of the numbers from EFX.  It feels like false advertising to claim it's a film about Michael Crawford; it's more like bits about his life and career interspersed with a huge Vegas/MGM Grand advertisement, and I resent having paid for the privilege of watching it.",1392249600,,764,4.6716417910447765
8297375,4,B001EAWMDI,"This film gives you a nice taste of Michael Crawford's career, except it goes overboard on the Las Vegas EFX period. The worst part is a brief segment where, for some unknown reason, a stripper is thrown into the mix.  This has absolutely nothing to do with Michael Crawford and should not be on this video.  Otherwise, there are many parts of the video to enjoy for Crawford fans.",1358380800,3,381,4.507246376811594
8297376,2,B001EAWMDI,"This dvd is mostly about las vegas and the EFX show, starring Michael Crawford. This film is not what i expected at all. A majority of it is about the efx show which is highly unknown. Plus, the plugs that are put in to promote Las Vega are just strange, especially when they show a clip of a nude pole dancer.... Have no idea why thats in there. They briefly refer to his other work and lightly touch on Phantom of the Opera which has to be his most popular and noteworthy work. All in all this film is confusing and would only refer it to die-hard crawford phans. He is interviewed throughout the whole film and he is simply enchanting.",1304899200,11,638,4.2809917355371905
8297377,4,B001EAWMDI,"The first segment views like an extended promotional video for Las Vegas and the FX show.  It takes a while to get to the details of Mr. Crawford's life and career.  His storytelling is so endearing, he enjoys it as much as the audience.  His joie de vivre and boundless energy come through wonderfully.  This video, along with his autobiography, should satisfy new fans like myself who somehow managed to miss out on this phenomenon the first time around.",1272585600,6,456,4.734177215189874
8297378,5,B001EAWMDI,is bound to be great! I just wish they'd cut out the 'plugs' for Las Vegas. A bit much advertising for me.,1252022400,6,106,3.8636363636363638
8297379,4,B001EAWMDI,"This DVD is excellent for anyone interested in Las Vegas and its shows and, of course, in Michael Crawford. There are a lot of scenes of the show EFX, back stage and from the show, and although the show opened in the 90s, the technology still seems amazing.

Michael Crawford is his usual charming, talented, and versatile self and comments on his career and life up to EFX and on the show.",1225756800,11,390,4.416666666666667
