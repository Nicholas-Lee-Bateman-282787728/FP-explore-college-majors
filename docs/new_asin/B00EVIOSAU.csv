8609857,4,B00EVIOSAU,"This is one of the more unusual films in Cecil B. DeMille's resume.  It was made before he devoted his entire career to fully mainstream entertainment and spectacle, a time when DeMille wasn't afraid to satirize modern culture and society as he did in entertaining oddities like ""Madame Satan"" and ""Four Frightened People""--the latter which flopped and burned DeMille from attempting such risky ventures again.

A previous review called this mere ""Depression-era rabble rousing.""  While there might be a tiny grain of truth, there is nothing in this movie that suggested the unrest was caused by the Depression.  The real enemy of this film is an underworld boss that corrupted the local government to such a degree that even the mayor is on the take.  And this isn't one of those loveable Edward Brophy types of gang leaders that you kinda want to stay on top.  This one is a hard-core true to life gangster that kills innocent bystanders without so much as wincing and is able to spin the story in his favor.  Charles Bickford plays a superb antagonist in this, so contemptible that you can't help but to laugh at his plight once the students have their way with him.

That's right, students.  The main protagonists are graduating seniors who dream of building a better tomorrow once they get out in the real world.  But once a local shop (and shopkeeper) gets blown to bits for refusing to pay protection money and one of the now-orphaned law students expects to see the great American justice system that they read so much about in school deliver some well-deserved justice.  Except he doesn't.  In fact, the student is so disillusioned by the injustice he just witnessed that he decides to hire some friends to sleuth for more clues Hardy Boys style.  But even this fails to the point of the unjust imprisonment of a student.

This is where the satire really sets in, the sort of fantastic situation students and adults alike wish could happen in such a situation.  I won't spoil it much further but the students decide to take the law into their own hands and deliver some tried and true high-school justice to the town bully in a surprisingly unique way.  There are some serious laugh-out loud moments throughout.

That same reviewer I mentioned earlier also states that the students marching was ""eerily similar to a Fascist rally.""  Hardly.  About as much as a typical homecoming march could pass as a Nazi rally.  In fact, it would have been lambasted as Communist propaganda had it been released 10 years later with its depiction of the student intelligentsia leading a march on city hall.  Out of context, it seems that way but it much more in the vein of ""populism"", local communities banding together against an identifiable force of tyranny, much like some Frank Capra films.  There are no pro-Red or pro-Nazi speeches in this, so any such label is up to very warped and strained (and mistaken) interpretation.

This is certainly a pre-code film, but not in the usual sense.  Sure, there are skimpier outfits worn by the women in Bickford's night club but the bigger difference is how the American justice system is portrayed.  One year later, the Production Code of America would ban any depiction of a corrupt judge or an unjust trial in contemporary times, additionally strongly limiting depictions corruption or incompetence of the police department.  This ban remained until the PCA dissolved in the late 60s when coincidentally such depictions of the ""establishment"" were all the rage.

The DVD transfer itself keeps this from getting 5 stars.  It's old, probably sourced from a laserdisc-era video print.  Satisfactory by 1990s standards, but pretty weak when viewing on anything larger than a 20"" TV screen.  Despite this, the transfer could be worse and is currently the only legal way to view this film.  The audio is pretty clear so no issue there.",1387756800,,3874,4.850837138508371
8609858,3,B00EVIOSAU,"A few years after making ""The Godless Girl"", DeMille revisited the youth film with one of his hardest to find sound films, This Day and Age, which stars the ever-likeable Richard Cromwell as the leader of a gang of kids who decides to bring about the downfall of a group of gangsters who killed their (adult) friend. With the exception of a couple of well-executed crowd scenes, one would be hard-pressed to name DeMille as the director of this work if they did not know in advance.  The film is a hoot, not least because of a cracking performance from Richard Cromwell and a fine script which includes some welcome pre-code snappy dialogue and other pre-code faithfuls such as sex, violence and references and accusations of homosexuality.  At 82 minutes it, too, moves along at a fast pace and is remarkably entertaining.

While I'm happy to enthuse about the film, I can't enthuse about the DVD.  It's great to have this film available again, it really is.  However, I have to agree with other reviewers that the film has received a poor transfer.  While we can't expect releases like this to be remastered or even touched up, a decent transfer of the print in its current condition shouldn't be too much to ask for.  As has already been said, this is soft in focus but, worse than that, there are digital artifacts at certain points throughout.  I have no objection to the burn on demand idea, and Warner's titles are normally done very well.  This is the first I have received from the Universal series, and I would certainly think twice about further purchases if this one is anything to go by.

I'm overjoyed to have the film in watchable quality on DVD (and I recommend this for the film itself), but it should have been better than this.",1387411200,3,1746,4.621359223300971
8609859,3,B00EVIOSAU,"An absolutely fascinating oddity, typical of the early Depression in which political and economic chaos resulted in a series of bizarre films which posited radical action to fix America's problems. Scenes of roving bands of vigilante high school students are eerily reminiscent of Fascist rallies. Only a so-so transfer.",1382140800,2,320,5.551020408163265
8609860,4,B00EVIOSAU,"...says the vintage poster on the dvd case. This was just to lure in the public who had been mesmerized by ""The Sign of the Cross"" (1932). The only bloat in the present film is several hundred high schoolers marching and singing through the nighttime streets.

This 1933 film has some sensational aspects about the warped justice system, gangsterism, shootings, and sexual abuse of a young woman--and snippets could surely add up to a hot preview. Though the Motion Picture Production Code had been adopted in 1930, it was not enforced until 1934, so this picture slipped through the crack.

This Day and Age was the fifth of director DeMille's sound films--so no problem with that aspect. His direction is good and earnest--he doesn't just shrug off this ""minor"" assignment, while saving himself for Cleopatra (1934) and The Crusades (1935).

As for the quality of the dvd image, I find it quite satisfactory for a vintage film.

STRANGE BUT TRUE

High school seniors assemble to hear the Principal (John Caradine, credited as John Peter Richmond) announce the several males who, as a civics project, will assume city offices such as mayor, district attorney, police chief. It's a casual concept until a warmly regarded  Jewish tailor is shot dead by protection-racketeer Charles Bickford--which student ""D.A."" Richard Cromwell witnesses (this actor is 23, so doesn't look boyish). When the court case is quashed by Bickford's mouthpiece, disillusioned Cromwell decides he and his buddies will strike back with their own unethical means. Caught up in this dangerous situation is Cromwell's girlfriend, Judith Allen (this actress is 22), who bravely endures the advances of a Bickford henchman and, cornered in a hotel room, is subjected to some impure innuendo. Bickford is finally kidnapped by senior boys, and crumbles under their noose and rat pit, and is paraded through the streets by the large ""manly"" chorus right into the judge's chamber.

A LITTLE SURPRISE

As students surge up the high school stairs, several black students are included, one in a spiffy Reserve Officers Training Corps uniform. Later he assists in waylaying Bickford by masquerading as a shoeshine boy and rattling on like Step 'n Fetchit. I considered it a nice touch, not demeaning then or now.

NO, I don't think this is a film of great merit. But it's a good example of DeMille's professionalism, and it's a curiosity as mob action led by kinda oblivious seniors saves the day.",1380412800,11,2466,5.054187192118227
8609861,1,B00EVIOSAU,"THIS DAY AND AGE is one of those terrific, little-known Paramount films of the 1930's which have been tucked away in the studio vaults and largely unseen, but now finally available via Universal's made-on-demand DVDs.  UNFORTUNATELY the image is so soft that it appears to be sub-VHS quality (close-ups are okay, but detail is quite poor), a HUGE disappointment for those of us who have been waiting so long for a decent DVD release.  It's offbeat DeMille and well worth seeing, but with such a weak, almost blurry image on view, it was hardly worth the effort.  Is there any hope that Universal can upgrade their video master so that we can have a respectable look at this film, with SOME justice to the visual integrity of the original?",1379289600,16,738,4.705426356589148
