8196744,5,B000QQF2GU,"David DeAngelo's Approaching Women Review

In my opinion, this is by far, like DavidD says, the most comprehensive program ever created on how to approach women.

You will learn so many techniques and mindsets, that it is impossible to understand them all or remind them at once. This is, just like his other programs, a program to watch regularly because you will keep getting new insights again and again.

In this program you will learn everything about how to overcome your obstacles with regard to approaching women, how to deal with rejection, how not to care what other people think of you, what to say when approaching women etc.

This way you create a lot more awareness around the whole subject of approaching, where you are right now, and how to develop yourself to where you want to be.

Next to the awareness, the `Approaching Women' program will also give you a boost in your confidence and motivation to really get this part handled.

Like David DeAngelo says in this program, the ""Agora"" of dating is to master the skill of starting conversations with women in every situation.

Also, the different perspectives from all the quest speakers are mind-blowing.

Dr. Paul for example created a whole model, the Mind OS, for how to get confidence points by using courage. Sean Stephenson gives, as always, a speech that will really motivate you to `get of your butt' and take action without `if's', `when's' and other excuses.

I really recommend this program to every man who is wondering why he is feeling so much anxiety with approaching women, plus every guy who's looking for tools and strategies to overcome this fear.

After all, if you can create enough courage to do his, it will have a lot of advantages in the future like getting more confidence, having more choice with women, feeling more relaxed, knowing how to talk to people etc.",1339804800,,1856,4.789968652037618

8196747,4,B000QQF2GU,"I used to have a lot of fear/trouble approaching women and having them be attracted to me. I might be able to make them laugh but I couldn't make things go any further. I was seriously lacking this department. This series helped me communicate confidently and generated interest and attraction in women. I was able to go on more dates and eventually found the girl of my dreams and have been happily married for 3 years now. This series is definitely worth it if you have trouble in the ladies department. Also, David Deangelo's stuff is helpful in just building confidence in general and overcoming fears and obstacles in your life.",1306022400,,633,4.711711711711712

8196749,1,B000QQF2GU,"Okay. I'm am attarctive, smart woman in her twenties who has had some great dates, some terrible dates, some hott dates and some loser dates. And I am here to tell you to BURN THIS BOOK and never read anything David DeAngelo writes again. I disagreed with practically EVERYTHING in the book. A girl wants a genuine guy - that's it. It doesn't matter if you do or say some lame or dorky stuff if you are genuine. If a woman blows you off for being a sincere (albeit occassionally goofy) human being, then you don't want to be with her anyway. And NO - women like that are not all ugly and boring.
But if shallow, selfish women are what you are after, then by all means, David DeAngelo may just be your godsend.",1200700800,10,709,4.2592592592592595
8196750,4,B000QQF2GU,"Great program that will dissect the whole approaching women business into digestable parts.

The danger with this can be overanalyzing the content.

Because really, all you have to do is approach.

Do you need a DVD program for this?

Nope.

But what it will give you is a lot of ideas that you could use. The speakers in this program will spoon-feed you with lines that you can use. But they also preach the importance of coming up with your own stuff.

The great thing about this program, is that it presents you with views from different experts in the same area. And if I haven't watched this program years ago, I would have never met one of the speakers in that program in real life.

He's helped me more with my ""game"" than ALL of the programs and books I've read on the subject combined. And that's what I'd suggest to you as well. Get around people who are good!

With that being said, this program can be pricey and if you really have a hard time approaching then get it. If not, I'd suggest you look into his other products.",1184198400,13,1034,4.348958333333333
