1535896,5,B00005JMTD,"I saw this most moving of documentaries at a community showing and eagerly await its release on DVD. It is an amazing testament to the power of the people to demand democracy in the face of antagonistic political and corporate powers--in this case, American backed powers. Watch the US backed coupe in 2002 against president Hugo Chavez of Venezuela fist hand as the documentary crew was fortuitously on the scene when it occurred. Watch the Venezuelan media lie to the public about the coupe, while the state run channel has been taken off the air and is unable to broadcast the truth. Watch Chavez be taken forcefully out of Venezuela with the help of the CIA. Watch the people of Venezuela flood the streets and demand their president back. Watch the soldiers of the military eventually realize the truth of what is occuring and refuse to continue to support the coupe. Watch the people win their country back and the return of their president--the one they voted into office. Watch Colin Powell lament the failure of the coupe. All Americans need to see this. Americans need to see first hand our government supporting the subversion of another democracy, how it was executed, and how it was thwarted.",1127260800,38,1205,4.826086956521739
1535897,5,B00005JMTD,"This is one of the best documentaries that I have ever seen, it's a travesty that it isn't available.  The film makers should release it on bit torrent.",1113350400,20,152,4.428571428571429
1535898,5,B00005JMTD,"I watched the TV version of this film (The Revolution will not be Televised) and I was enthralled and horrified at what I saw, and filled with respect for those who filmed it. I am a former journalist and now work in communication for development, and I can say that this is one of the best pieces of journalism - and great entertainment - that I have ever seen. It shows so clearly the power of the media and the cynical manipulation of reality by Washington and its greedy puppets. Given the lies, lies and more lies coming out of the White House over Afghanistan, Iraq - and Venezuela (to name just three) - this should be shown in every school and every community centre across the USA. Brilliant stuff.",1066694400,26,707,4.446153846153846
7940947,5,B00005JMTD,"This is indeed a powerful, outstanding film of tremendous historic significance. Even though I personally had some understanding of the situation in Venezuela (both before and after the coup), I was blown away by this film. No matter what you think you know about Venezuela and its government - once the tape is rolling, you just can't look away. And nor should you. Many thanks to this wonderful (and very brave) documentary team who had the nerve to shine a beam of truth on the illegal coup that tried to topple a democracy, and the people who came out by the millions to support and defend their elected government.

The bottom line - do whatever you can to get your hands on this one - and once you do, watch it, and then pass it on...",1331424000,2,740,4.4411764705882355
7940948,5,B00005JMTD,"While time may have arguably dulled Chavez's sheen somewhat as a leader, (depending
on whom you believe) there's no denying the power of this `accidental documentary',
whatever your politics.  If your mind is at all open, this is a must see.

The filmmakers were an Irish film crew doing a general portrait of the popular Chavez,
when they found themselves in the midst of an attempted coup by the rich right wing,
likely supported by the CIA.

The film is almost unbearably tense and exciting as the tens of thousands of people
surround the palace and demand Chavez's return to power.

Some important details get short shrift, but this is like watching a Costa-Gavras film,
with the added intensity of knowing it's real life.

Does it have a point of view?  Yes. What documentary doesn't?  Is it the whole truth?
I don't know.  But I do know I learned a lot more about the coup attempt then I got
from reading The New York Times.

If you hate Chavez with a passion, then this will not be a film for you.  But if
like most Americans, myself included, you don't know enough to really judge,
and only get the soundbites of our corporate run mainstream media, this is
a valuable document.

Note: I was able to get a copy of the DVD with a quick Google search.  So while
it shamefully has not been given mainstream exhibition, it is possible to buy
a copy.  I'd love to know the exact story behind the film's lack of release!)",1320364800,3,1422,4.4863813229571985
7940949,5,B00005JMTD,"With part reconstruction and part direct shooting, the directors made a formidably limpid documentary on a coup d'tat against President Chavez in Venezuela, organized by a foreign secret service and fully supported by the wealthy Venezuelan minority, the political opposition, the Church (a cynical laughing cardinal) and the US government. It was another chapter in the history of US foreign policy, which Steven Kinzer calls `Overthrow' or `sowing democracy American style'. In fact, this foreign backed intervention was not only a coup d'tat against President Chavez, but also against the democratic majority which elected him.

That this is a brilliant documentary is mightily confirmed by the violent reactions for and against it on Internet.
As Saint Augustine said: `Men love truth when it bathes them in its light; they hate it when it proves them wrong.'

This movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in.",1244073600,3,948,5.14935064935065
7940950,5,B00005JMTD,"The fact that this DVD has been blocked for release in the United States and other countries speaks volumes. It is about a CIA backed coup attempt to overthrow Hugo Chavez in 2003. Despite a media blackout, loyal adherents of Chavez, and more importantly to Democracy and the Constitution of Venezuela, were able to overtake the palace and return Chavez to power. Important elements of the film include Chavez in his interactions with the poor and his cabinet. Hint: this film can often be found on Ebay. Every American with an open mind should make it their duty to see this film.",1221436800,3,581,4.705882352941177
7940951,5,B00005JMTD,"Regardless of your opinion of Chavez this documentary will shake any understanding that you have of Venezuela and Hugo Chavez.

A film crew happened to be in Venezuela to do a documentary on Chavez at the  time of the coup in April '02. They document a side of the coup and the people's revolt that reinstated Chavez as President, that was not shown by the Venezuelan press.

Don't take this movie as your sole source of information about Chavez, however this film shows happenings that were not recorded by any other source and without it, it is certain that Chavez opponents would have been able to paint a far different picture than what we now know really happened.

This documentary doesn't just record history, it is a part of it.",1210550400,,736,4.638461538461539

7940953,5,B00005JMTD,"This documentary was made by two independent filmmakers, who was in Venezuela for a film about President Hugo Chavez when the coup against him occurred. They immediately shifted focus and filmed the event as it happened. In addition to the coup as the main event, the film also includes some backgrounds on Venezuela's politics up to that point, which helps to explain why the coup happened.

The film is valuable in that it shows the western public the truth about Venezuela: that it has a real participatory democracy, one that people in the US have never had a taste of; that it has a government leader that actually cares about the people, again something that has not happened in the US for a very long time since Kennedy; and that so much of what is said about it in the West is lie, lie and damned lie.

Beside the value of its accurate accounts, the film contains many moving footages about the interaction between President Chavez and the people. I was especially moved by a footage that shows Chavez listening to a mentally handicapped boy singing. Amid a world ruled by psychopaths, it is hope-inspiring to see that there still exist such leaders.",1190246400,7,1158,4.699507389162561
7940954,5,B00005JMTD,"All people in the US and in my country the UK and all over the western world should watch this essential film. I have just been to a showing of the film and logged on to amazonUK to order it, but only found this forthcoming release here at amazon.com. This film displays the utter depravity of the kind of puppets that western imperialism is prepared to support to subvert popular progressive governments in the developing world,in this case the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela of Hugo Chavez. The lying of the oligarchy-owned media is exposed here like in no other film I have seen:We are shown the scene in the Presidential Palace in Caracas just after the coup plotters have been ousted,and their friends in the corporate media are still telling people that Carmona is still in power and totally in control! We also listen to someone posing as the Venezuelan Attorney General ,when this post had been abolished by the coup plotters themselves! To all Brits reading this:recall how leading new Labourite Dennis Macshane actually welcomed this fascist coup.

Now let us all recall how we were told that we invaded Yugoslavia,Afghanistan and Iraq to bring democracy,freedom and sun-tan lotion to the eternally grateful people of these countries...",1182729600,7,1250,5.009615384615385
7940955,5,B00005JMTD,"This remarkable piece of filmmaking provides viewers with the rare opportunity of viewing a U.S.-backed political coup from an insider's perspective. The filmmakers were actually holed up in the Venezualan presidential palace as the coup drama unfolded. Amazing stuff. The film does a particularly thorough job of exposing the cynical, manipulative lies of the coup plotters - upper class Venezualans allied with high ranking military leaders (and the American CIA). In the end, the Venezualan people emerge as the true heroes of this drama - risking everything to demand democracy. An immensely inspiring film that every American should see - both North and South.",1179446400,12,665,5.403846153846154
7940956,5,B00005JMTD,"This excellent documentary film had been withdrawn from commercial distribution indefinitely.  Please check out the British Venezuela Solidarity Campaign for information on availability of this film.

as far as the film...

There is a lot of nit-picky criticism from Chavez opponents pointing out that that some interviews and scenes in the ""before the coup"" part of the film were actually interviews or street scenes filmed after coup - the critics apparently unaware that all movies are made this way!  Nonetheless there has been no credible evidence that the events and viewpoints depicted in the film are not substantially correct.

Considering the above, one one can't help but to think that there is something more sinister behind the ban on commercial sales of this film.  Amnesty International did confirm that it withdrew this film from their 2003 Vancouver film festival due to threats of violence, not due to claims of innacurate content.  At risk of digressing, this was awful cowardice on the part of Amnesty International - especially in light of the their orgainzations stated mission.",1138665600,36,1100,5.251428571428572
