6253077,5,B00I791IAW,"Aside from the voice, which is a voice for the ages (we only have no or poor recording of past tenors so there may have been other voices the equal of his) what I enjoy the most is how happy he is after each selection, and I don't think it is that he is only pleased with himself -- he seems overjoyed to sing for 50 or 500,000 and to be able to please them. This may be what makes him unique.",1399334400,7,393,3.8048780487804876

6253087,5,B00I791IAW,"First the audio: 1960s-2000 with variable quality, PCM stereo which on my home theater sounds just fine. The picture is great.  Now for the music: this is a great representation of the work of this legendary tenor. From his recitals , television appearances, concerts., and his fundraising concerts with pop stars like Bono, Eric Clapton,etc. the booming gorgeous Pavararotti voice demonstrates the power of an opera singer contrasting with the pop vocals- a treat for all music fans. This is a great disc. If you love music, get this and enjoy the Voice of the Ages""",1404259200,6,567,4.90625

8639686,5,B00I791IAW,What can I say? Lucciano Pavarotti was one of the best tenors ever!  This DVD is a combination of singing and interviews and it just shows what a nice man he was.,1500249600,2,162,4.0625
8639687,5,B00I791IAW,"The VOICE of Pavarotti in the late 1980's was at its best. I bought this DVD having read all the reviews and I must say I am thrilled with the excellent quality of the sound (SONY- TV and Amplifier) and the video of this Performance of Pavarotti in Barcelona in 1988! Bravoooooo! Bravisimoooo!
I highly recommend it. Vasya- Los Angeles.",1497052800,3,336,4.616666666666666
