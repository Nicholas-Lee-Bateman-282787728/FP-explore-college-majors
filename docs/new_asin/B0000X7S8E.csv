8004257,1,B0000X7S8E,"WARNING !

The DVD title and picture here are wrong: there are two versions of the film Deewaar -- one from 1975 and one from 2004 -- this listing has the poster from the 1975 film but the date of the 2004 film. Amitabh Bacchan is in both films, but the 1975 film is directed by Yash Chopra, the 2004 one by Luthria.

Amazon has messed up and intermingled these two films in most of the listings for Deewaar (and to confuse matters more, both films are sometimes also mistransliterated Deewar).

Amazon gets a low one star rating for confusing one of the most popular Hindi films of all time.

Beware before you buy.",1201219200,6,616,4.37719298245614
