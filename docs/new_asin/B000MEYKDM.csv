2729128,5,B000MEYKDM,"I loved this film and was so excited to learn that it would finally be released on DVD.  It's the first horror film to use real bodies!  Also, the story line is pretty cool.  I highly recommend it for those who are true horror fans.  Very suspenseful and leaves you with the feeling that you have to go to sleep with the lights on.",1170979200,7,331,4.125
2729129,1,B000MEYKDM,"Ok,

again. Not the best movie or scariest movie i have ever seen, in fact probably the least scary horror movie i've seen in years claiming to be one.

This is about how you should not screw around with dead bodies, the spirit may require revenge. but it was done in a Degrassi Junior High way.

Much too much moral hesitation and never really delivers any scares at all.

More drama than horror.

Thanks Lion's Gate, can't wait for the next Horrorfest!

Maybe we'll get more comedies and musicals for the next installation of HORRORFEST FILMS!!!(insert evil laugh here)",1170979200,12,571,4.717171717171717

Horror is created when the boundaries of alternative realities intersect at a point where unexpectedly disastrous results of their crossing complicate the character's life. In Unrest, our protagonist's life becomes increasingly complicated. The story ends with a suitable resolution of conflict while leaving many questions left in the viewer's mind.",1455840000,,493,6.454545454545454

I would not pay any money to view this film.  It really wasn't that good, but it's o.k. if the viewing is free.",1450656000,,281,3.982142857142857
2729142,5,B000MEYKDM,"With most movies & shows I can predict what's going to happen which in turn bores the heck out of me. I could only predict half of this one at best which is great. I plan to buy this one to have around for myself & I seriously recommend this movie. It is actually pretty good. The acting doesn't suck, the characters actions/motivations are 80% of the time right on & believable. It makes you laugh, keeps you entertained & best of all, isn't so far fetched that it's a waste of time to watch.

With that said, we all have our own different preferences, likes & dislikes. Personally, I can't agree with any of the reviews that are under 3 stars. Normally I read the reviews before bothering to watch a movie. I did the same with this one but today decided to give a chance. I'm happy I did or I would've missed out on a great movie.",1449878400,2,832,4.2

2729158,3,B000MEYKDM,"Supposedly a ghost story (but without a ghost).  Unrest concerns some `supernatural' happenings that occur when people disrespect a cadaver named Norma.  The four lab students assigned to take her apart start to get creeped-out when one of them (Corri English as Alison Blanchard) insists on personalizing the cadaver.  She wants to know everything about her.  Her obsession leads to breaking the rules as well as breaking into a doctor's office to steal a photo of their cadaver.  Soon, people start to die in increasingly mysterious ways (sadly, off screen).  Eventually, the Aztecs are blamed, hence the occasional chanting in the background.

There are some very elementary `chills' through the use of lights that fail on cue.  Blood is heavily featured as a drawing tool.  It isn't the least bit scary.  It's more psychological than overt horror.  Too much depends on the main character (Alison) who just comes across as annoyingly flaky.  Her irrational need to know more than she should isn't rooted in anything logical.  She's just a nosy `atheist"" (a designation that's hammered home once too often, as though that had anything to do with a restless spirit).

Eh, I've seen worse.",1431907200,,1189,5.061855670103093

2729165,4,B000MEYKDM,Not bad for a low budget movie. Story got a bit tangled in spots and you really needed to help it along but as a Amazon Prime free-bee I didn't think it was bad at all.,1421452800,,168,3.6944444444444446

2729167,4,B000MEYKDM,"I'm a big fan of horror movies, but I want to make a distinction regarding this one. Unrest isn't so much of a jump scare ""horror"" movie, rather it falls into the category of a foreboding, ominous, intriguing ""creepy"" movie with a back story that actually catches your interest when it's revealed.

Even in scenes where I was SURE that they were going to use a cheesy, cliche effect with the corpse (""oh no, the hand reached out from under the sheet!""), I was proven wrong just about every time. The movie is more tactful than that.

Parts in the beginning can seem kind of eye-roll inducing because they don't have a decent basis, but I was really impressed with the eventual reveal of the back story. The movie managed to captivate me with all of the crazy things that were revealed to have happened OFF screen, (rare for a scary flik) and that's why I give this movie four stars.

Bonus points for all of the really cool dissection shots, which had a well balanced amount of gore. (Plenty of flesh, but not as gut churning as, say, Evil Dead.)",1420502400,2,1046,4.465968586387435

4. Storyline: *** stars (The entire story, more beginning, needed to be told)

And I remember attending the first After Dark series event. I spent an entire weekend in a dark theater from sun up to sun down. I love the storyline behind this movie. It was rather new and refreshing to me at the time. It's not my favorite After Dark movie, but it's in my top 5. It was very creepy. It was a bit more suspenseful than scary.

2729185,4,B000MEYKDM,"I'm tempted to knock a star off here for the fact that NONE OF THIS STUFF WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAPPEN IN A REAL HOSPITAL!!! I mean, the main characters would have been expelled in Act I. There's a scene at the end (spoiler, eh?) where Corri English's character is dragging a body bag down a hospital corridor, leaving a trail of blood on the linoleum floor and we're supposed to think, what? That the security guards are just busy doing other stuff? Or this is the one hospital in the western world where there aren't security cameras catching every loose movement?
But you know what? It's horror. Dead bodies don't concoct elaborate posthumous revenge schemes either. A real hospital would be a no fun place to have a horror movie, so let's just accept this screwed up make-pretend world and go on with it.
Oh, yes and Corri English. Wow! Talk about beauty, grace and a sexually informed intelligence that comes in a package that doesn't fit the image that Hollywood somehow thinks we all want to see. A little ""too short"", little ""too curvy"", but I could spend a lifetime looking at her, and she's a damn good actor. Corri, call me maybe? jk",1414454400,,1146,4.541062801932367

2729189,2,B000MEYKDM,"Unrest starts off as a nice supernatural horror flick.  Paced well, creepy atmosphere, and nice build up.  And about a 1/2 way into it, it takes a left turn into a brick wall for no apparent reason.  Maybe the producers fired the screen writer and director at the 1/2 way point.  Or it was running out of money so the producers rushed the last half.  Whatever the cause, the pace was way off and the atmosphere lost my interest.  By the end, I really didn't care who lived, died, or the answer to the mystery our heroes were trying to solve.  The ending was lame.  NO SPOILER- Our fearless heroes solved the mystery and figured out how to fix things.  So, they go through some trouble to fix things, but right at the end they realize that maybe their solution won't work.  Really contrived to think that they'd go through all that trouble and not realize that they may have some problems with the solution.

The music was distracting- some sort of primitive jungle noise meant to be Aztec-ian, I guess.  It made me think that a jaguar was going to leap out of some dark corner rather than a supernatural haunting.",1414195200,,1113,4.455445544554456

And if you've ever been in one late at night or in a wing of a hospital that is totally empty... yeah I can scare myself silly just over thinking about scary stuff. Or get into an empty elevator and push the Basement or B1 or B2 button... sub levels to the basements. We all know what is down there, but no way am I gonna press the button. So yeah the premise for the story was cool, and respecting the dead was a very nice element there (still does not want me donating my body to science) I think well for me anyways, a few more scares or even implied scares would have been nice. All in all I think it was worth watching.  I wish the rating system had a bit more to it. I just watched a movie not as good as this, but it was Ok. I gave it 3 stars also.

While spirits and tormented avenging soul stories aren't new to the genre the addition of a possessed cadaver who kills and maims those who are disrespectful towards her body/spirit is a new and refreshing twist. This is another movie that has many of the necessary elements needed to produce a good horror movie, but lacks the depth of good and knowledgeable writing to meld the decent acting, direction, plot/premise together for a successful production. They shot in an actual hospital and used (genuine) human cadavers combined with its good direction and acting the movie falls way short due to the writing. The director was also co-scriptwriter and may have just been overwhelmed or his lack of writing experience may be to blame. I don't think that the budget had anything to do with the writing issues and I would like to see them (The production group) remake this movie minus the writer to see how much better this can be with good writing. For me that says a lot about what I thought of this production as a whole and the only real glaring flaw with the story was in its writing. This was a good attempt at making a memorable horror flick on a small budget using unseasoned actors and a director with only two prior works and co-screenwritters with zero and one prior work. This is the first time that I have given praise for a so...so movie that has so much potential from a newcomer in the industry. Is it worth a watch? Yes, but don't set your sights to high. 2.3 stars

2729224,2,B000MEYKDM,"I remember seeing this movie in 2006, and I remember both liking and disliking this movie, but I forgot why. Seeing it again yesterday, I remembered. I LIKED this movie because it has an interesting storyline, creepy atmosphere, and well done effects. What I DIDNT like about this movie was the lead actress...Brittney Spears evil twin. We'll call her...""Whittney"". So, ""Whittney"", a ""brilliant"" medical student, finds her first day of dissecting class a little hard to handle. See...she doesnt like dead bodies. She develops a weird love/hate relationship with her cadaver, and since she is ""atheist"" doesnt believe in an afterlife, even tho she believes her cadavers 's spirit is not at rest. (Yeah I know, makes perfect sense). Ok, moving along...she spends the rest of her time at med school trying to have sex with a fellow classmate (who isn't really interesting or interested), takes her shirt off about twenty times (dont get hot, guys...she's not toned), and...wait for it...does THE STUPIDEST THING I've ever seen a character do ANYWHERE...she jumps into a formaldehyde filled cadaver dunk tank, not once...but TWICE to ""grasp"" her unrest/undead zombie lover/whatever. Cadaver hook? What cadaver hook? ""Whittney"" apparently loves fishing round in corpse tanks...either that or its just another excuse for her to take her shirt off and show roll-adge to her nerdy f-buddy. But I digress,...

If this was the end if it, so be it. But I had to sit thru her terrible over acting, and that way certain girls (who may be cute but not anything spectacular) THINK they are gorgeous...and do that whole "" look at me, hee hee, im perfect, hee hee"" routine. Not to mention that there are absolutely no students, janitors, teachers, staff, etc, at a practicing hospital...awwwkward!

I have to say, the best actor was the rubber cadaver played, to a T.
Great effects, great idea, but damn, shoddy writing and very poor choice for lead ruined it.

2729231,3,B000MEYKDM,"More like so boring it was banned. I can't say that I really disliked this move or hated it though. I did watch it till the end in one sitting. Brittany Spears did a good job acting... oh wait it's not her but her look alike. Well what can I say about this movie? It's not very scary or suspenseful, and it doesn't really make a good horror film. It's an alright mystery film. That is if you can solve the mystery of how any of these people died because I sure didn't see anyone kill them. They were just dead! That's all you get. You'll never see the corpse do anything other than lay on a table and ruining any arousal the naked female body gives you (well you might like it if you're Ted Bundy).

I can see where a lot of people wouldn't like this film but it's not that bad. It does bring something new and different in terms of the setting and how it's used in the story. Everything happens right under the roof of the hospital/medical school. Gave me that resident evil feel (the game not the movie) in how you spend hours in one building uncovering a mystery and fighting for your life. That's an important atmosphere to have in a horror flick and even some of the more popular ones in the genre don't really capture that feeling like they should. That feeling of being closed in and not being able to just escape to safety. You're forced to deal with the problem because you just can't run away.

Although what I said is kind of deeper than this film really is it does get 2 stars for providing that atmosphere that I like. The additional star is for the special effects in the morgue with the bodies. Since they used real bodies and such for some of the scenes. I can't say anything was really cheesy except for a few things. 1. The inside of ""Normas"" body didn't look too realistic. Atleast in how it was detailed. 2. later on in the movie when ""Norma's"" body is being dragged she leaves a massive trail of blood. I don't understand that? Her blood has been drained she's a Cadaver. Why would she leave a trail of fresh blood?

2729233,2,B000MEYKDM,"Unrest is a horror film that, like Autopsy, plays on the fear of corpses in a medical setting.  Unlike Autopsy, Unrest is more about what happens to your corpse afterwards.  As one of the characters explains early on, ""Never, ever donate your body to science!"" Unrest then graphically explains why: inexperienced medical students will ogle your corpse, discuss your history, investigate your past, use your body like a whoopee cushion (nothing quite like squirting fluid out of your mouth at an unsuspecting med student, HAW!), unceremoniously dump your dead body into a closet full of formaldehyde, and show your stinking cadaver off to their prissy girlfriends. Unrest pretty much violates every medical principle in the book, and then when makes up a new book so it can violate that too.

Alison Blanchard (Corri English) is a new med student with psychic powers who meets cute with another student (Scot Davis as Brian Cross) over their shared concern about their class assignment.  That assignment is Alita Covas's corpse (Marisa Petroro), who was once an archaeologist that discovered a mass grave of Aztec sacrifices -- in Brazil, of all places.  Covas' personality gradually decayed from a prim scientist to a pregnant prostitute capable of murder before she finally took her own life.  Who is responsible for this sudden shift becomes clear from the soundtrack, which is filled with tribal drums: Tlazolteol, Aztec goddess of fertility and prostitution. That was probably your second guess, right?

When people begin dying around Covas' corpse, Unrest becomes a murder mystery. The pressure is on to get to the bottom of the curse before Blanchard becomes the next victim. Unfortunately, the rules as to how the evil dead operate are never quite clear.  There's a feint at making Blanchard seem very similar to Covas, right down to her therapy sessions, and it appears if Unrest will actually be more in the vein of the Exorcist.  If that was the intent, the plot got lost on the cutting room floor. Instead, Unrest is basically a ghost story without a corpse instead of a ghost.

Unrest has its moments.  There is something disgusting about the cadavers and how cavalierly they're treated by medical students.  If you buy the hype that a real corpse was used somewhere in the film, it only heightens the ick factor.  Unrest doesn't have a lot of gore for a film about dead bodies, so it relies on scares that happen off screen - a refreshing change of pace for horror fans but sure to disappoint gorehounds.

Unfortunately, the majority of Unrest rests on English's petite shoulders and she's simply not up to the task.  A cute blonde surrounded by tall brunette males, she looks like a cheerleader who wandered onto the set.  Her emoting isn't particularly good, she has a stilted delivery, and it's clear she was chosen more for her ability to wear a bath towel than a lab coat.

The other problem is that Unrest has no respect for medical conventions. The formaldehyde closet becomes something of a running joke. Almost the entire cast at one point ends up being dunked in this stupid closet, alive or dead - but those who escape from it should most certainly BE dead.  One doesn't just take a dip in formaldehyde and walk away. One also doesn't usually find Aztecs in Brazil, but why quibble?

If you're not too picky about the details, Unrest has enough occasional scares and wacky drumbeats to entertain.  But if you're looking for dead bodies, medical accuracy, or acting talent...you might want a second opinion.",1298937600,,3530,4.900840336134454

2729236,3,B000MEYKDM,"Unrest has more than its fair share of problems, but I have to admit I did enjoy watching it.  I can't give director Jason Todd Ipson too much credit, though, because he wrote as well as directed the project - and this storyline has some gargantuan holes and death-defying jumps of logic interspersed throughout.  The inclusion of several really annoying little things (such as the fact that first-year med school students are constantly referred to as Doctors) also take something away from one's enjoyment.  Still, I have to admit that there's just something about Unrest that I liked.

First-year med student Alison Blanchard (Britney Spears lookalike Corri English) isn't the first student to ever pass out at her first sight of a dead body, but she may be the first to explain her lunch-tossing reaction as a response to a strong feeling that something isn't esoterically right with her cadaver.  She recovers in time to help her lab partners start dissecting the body, but she becomes obsessed with finding out whatever she thinks the exceedingly dead corpse is trying to tell her.  So far so good with the creepy atmosphere, which is further heightened by the fact that poor Alison actually has to reside there in a dark wing of the hospital until her financial aid comes through.  Her professor and lab mates just think she has typical first-year med school jitters, but it becomes obvious that something far from typical is going on when individuals connected to the body start turning up dead.

The casting in this film is, if nothing else, interesting.  I think Corri English does a pretty good job in the starring role, and the fact that she bears such a strong resemblance to Britney Spears makes her even more interesting to watch.  Speaking of very attractive women, you're also treated to the captivating performance of Deal or No Deal's Marissa in the role of a rather mesmerizing minor (yet crucial) character.  You also have Jessica Alba's brother playing the role of one of Alison's dissection partners, while Derrick O'Connor makes for something of a quintessential gross anatomy instructor.

This film reportedly used real human cadavers, but that fact doesn't make Unrest a better or more provocative film - especially if you only learn about the use of real human cadavers after you've already watched the movie.  As always, the story's the thing, and this story just has far too many problems to qualify as any sort of stand-out title in the After Dark Horrorfest collection.",1254182400,,2500,4.923809523809524
2729237,1,B000MEYKDM,"It sounded promising. I was watching my usual Saturday marathon. This week it was hospital-based horror movies. I watched this right after Autopsy, which was much much better than this.

The lead actress had a simply irritating personality, she was the kind of person who usually gets killed off in horror movies, but as cliche goes, the girl always survives in the end. She attends med school because she thinks that if she can understand the human body, she'll understand all the mysteries of the universe, or something to that degree. Right off the bat, she proves ill-suited to her chosen profession by puking on herself & passing out withing the first 5 minutes of her first class.

The insulting part is that they keep insinuating that she is either an Atheist or an Agnostic, but she is clearly a Theist or Spiritualist with strong beliefs in her own psychic abilities to detect the presence of evil spirits. Real Atheists don't have these kinds of ""feelings"" she keeps insisting upon, so the movie is insulting real Atheists.

Back to the story. The girl just sort of snaps into a state of paranoid schizophrenia & causes lots of unrest & irritation among her peers & superiors & keeps finding lots of dead bodies, yet she is neither institutionalized, transferred to another school, expelled, suspended, or made into a suspect for murder. Seriously, there is murder after murder & no one is brought in for questioning, they don't even close the school down for an investigation.

Another thing I hated about this movie was the lack of gore, because they don't show you anything, not even a walking zombie/ghost cadaver. The ""antagonist"" of the movie doesn't so much as twitch in this movie. You are even left thinking that it could possibly have been the girl; she was there, she found the bodies, & she's definitely crazy & that the possessed cadaver killings are a manifestation she made up in her head.

Yet another irritation comes from the genre switch near the end of the movie, when it goes from a psychological horror movie to an in-your-face sci-fi paranormal ghost movie, & the ghost's special effects were very disappointing because the ghost is invisible. If the cadaver had become animated, it might not have been so bad.

According to the Wikipedia ""Formaldehyde is classified as a probable human carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. At concentrations above 0.1 ppm in air formaldehyde can irritate the eyes & mucous membranes, resulting in watery eyes. Formaldehyde inhaled at this concentration may cause headaches, a burning sensation in the throat, & difficulty breathing, as well as triggering or aggravating asthma symptoms. "" Well, this girl & her boyfriend strip down to their underwear & go swiming in a tank full of it!

2729239,3,B000MEYKDM,"Unrest (Jason Todd Ipson, 2006)

According to IMDB, the tagline for Unrest was ""the first film to use real bodies."" Oops. To the best of my knowledge, the first film to use real bodies was released almost twenty years before (T. F. Mous' 1988 exploitation flick Men Behind the Sun). And I probably missed a few that came before that. Someone forgot to do a bit of research there, I think. That's not surprising. Like a number of After Dark Horrorfest movies, Unrest is one of those movies that actually had a great deal of potential, but failed to realize it at every turn.

The story revolves around Alison Blanchard (3: The Dale Earnhardt Story's Corri English), a new freshman in medical school who, like most medical school students, goes through the usual initiation: she and her classmates are given a cadaver to dissect as soon as they start classes, and will be dissecting it for the rest of the semester. As she knows no one, Alison kind of stumbles in to a group who needs a fourth; her new pals are Brian (12-24's Scot Davis), Carlos (Alpha Dog's Joshua Alba--and yes, that is a family resemblance you notice), and Rick (Fashion Victim's Jay Jablonski), and, of course, the four of them make for as heterogeneous a group as one might expect in a horror film containing young-and-beautifuls. Weird things happen from day one, and Alison becomes convinced that the soul of their cadaver has been somehow harnessed to the body, and begins to consult occult specialists to find out how to go about freeing it. The others initially scoff at her beliefs, but as the strangeness piles up and other members of the group begin to be affected, Alison finds a reluctant partner in crime in Brian, who may not believe, but is willing to accept that something weird is going on.

It seems to me that the problem here lies in the script, co-written by Ipson and first-time writer Chris Billett. This is the kind of thing at which the Japanese are superlative, and many times while watching this movie, I wondered how the material would have been handled by someone like Shinya Tsukamoto (whose Vital is, thematically, quite close to this). But that's not what we got, and Unrest must be judged on its own merits. While it does have a few--there's some decent acting (English is good when she's not overdoing it, and some of the minor characters are quite fine) and some striking scenes, but the whole thing never quite comes together in the way it seems it should. There are ideas culled from other films that don't quite work as well here as they did in their original places; one of Alison's encounters with Rick, for example, was pulled straight out of Verbinski's remake of Ring (there's that Japanese connection again), and where Verbinski's take on it is undeniably powerful, here it just left me with a sense of puzzlement.

The thing about the Japanese New Horror movement that has made it work for so long is that the movies that fall into that category are absolutely loaded with atmosphere. Ipson grasps that idea a few times (pretty much any scene with the body tank is a success here), but it's never sustained long enough to give the movie the creepiness that the material deserves. I really did want to like this movie, especially given my love for Vital, but I never quite managed it. ** ",1243814400,2,3301,4.664948453608248
2729240,5,B000MEYKDM,"I have seen quite a few horror flicks, and I am pretty discerning. I don't care for slasher flicks, vampires and zombies are generally pretty boring and overdone, and werewolves aren't scary at all. Give me a good ghost/possession story any day. As soon as I finished watching Unrest the first time, I knew I had to own the DVD. It was THAT powerful.

Now, I agree that there are a lot of discrepancies in this movie, especially regarding the biggest plot point about the Aztecs. I have studied ancient civilizations with the Aztecs being one of my favorites, so I was a little irked that the writers of this movie so blatantly disregarded the facts. If it had been less of a plot point it would not have bothered me that much, but they kept bringing it up and kept trying to tie it into what was happening. I was able to ignore the medical issues until much, much later though. And none of the discrepancies bothered me enough to change my view of the movie.

The acting in this was top-notch, and I really cared about the girl and her boyfriend. I was very happy with the way the movie ended. To me, the pace of the film was not slow at all--rather, it was building to the climax in a logical, ""realistic"" manner. The setting they chose for this was a great one, and not generally seen in horror films despite the obvious associations. It had a good script with interesting dialogue as well.

I for one feel that this is one of the best horror movies made in recent years.",1240876800,,1474,4.372262773722627
2729241,3,B000MEYKDM,"UNREST

Unrest is one of those movies that had all the potential in the world and for what it is was ok but still did not achieve its full potential. The After Dark Horror Fest is a tricky little thing since ever since it was started it was supposed to be an outlet for the best in unseen horror. On the topic thus far in my opinion it has only delivered on that promise a little, most of the releases thus far have been average at best, but I am glad that they found distribution since they are at the very least entertaining. This film also has the fact that real bodies were used to its advantage, so that is cool although it is far from the first to do so.

Alison Blanchard is new to the hospital and is a first year employee and is losing her mind it seems. Once she joins a group of newcomers like her self to dissect human bodies she begins to not only hear things but sense things as well. This would be only normal for your average everyday ghost story but she does not believe in spirits, so I guess that makes different. So after countless attempts at telling her self it is not possible she starts to believe little by little as people who come in contact with the body start to die. She learns all kinds of things about not only the person to whom the body belonged but also some interesting things about something that may have influenced this once live body.

This is thing that kinda upsets me the most about this movie, the back story involving the person who is now the corpse is way more interesting than the lead girl. I don't know why this seems this way but to me it felt more compelling. Writer/director Jason Todd Ipson and co writer Chris Billett really need to pen a prequel to this, that would not only be the first prequel from ""The Fest"" but it could also be the first sequel to ""The Fest"" [Butterfly Effect 3 started outside The Fest with the first two]. This movie is pretty good and shows that they have the potential to craft something really good; the back-story to this could be excellent.

I guess my biggest complaint about this is the lead actress Corri English, she is fine at times but at others she struggles and over acts [maybe it is just me]. Every one else seem ok to average and do fine in the supporting roles. The guy who played the instructor was really the only stand out and the girl who is now the body did well in her flash back scenes. Other than that this is just a pretty good movie that is on par with most of the other films in this yearly series. In fact from the three I have reviewed this may be my favorite or at least on the same level as ""DARK RIDE"" and better than ""WICKED LITTLE THINGS"".

Over all for those who must have every movie in the series then this is a worthy addition but for those looking for better horror films, trust me when I say there are better. This is not a horrible movie and is at least worthy of a rental, who knows this might be for you. I know people who loved ""WICKED LITTLE THINGS"" and hated ""DARK RIDE"". I didn't love either but I would think the latter was better than the former, or at least more entertaining.",1239667200,,3107,4.215126050420168

2729245,3,B000MEYKDM,"This was the first After Dark Horror Fest movie that I saw, and I must say that I was a disappointed after watching it.

Synopsis: The story is about a group of medical students who join ""Gross Anatomy"", one of them being Alison.  She teams up with a group of three other students, Brian, Carlos and Rick. Their first assignment is to examine a cadaver of a young woman. However, Alison starts experiencing strange things from the moment she starts to cut upon the body. Little does she know that, whoever is in contact with the cadaver, die of mysterious circumstances.

Positive aspects:
1. I must admit, I found the initial plot of the story somewhat intriguing. It had a good potential to become something really suspenseful and thought provoking.

2. The actors also did a good job playing their roles. They can only do so much with the material they are given.

3. The movie focused more on the storyline rather than the gory details. While this wasn't such a wise move, it was good to see a movie rely more on the psychological aspect than the queasy details.

Negative aspects: Where do I begin? There were SO many plot holes in this movie, medical and otherwise, that made me lost interest in this movie. I divided them into 2 categories, because there are so many unexplained and unbelievable things that just don't make sense.

*NOTE: This Section contains spoilers so if you have not seen the movie, please don't read any further, unless you want to know how the movie ends*

Medical issues -

1. I am not a medical student, but its common sense that just a whiff of formaldehyde is dangerous, and if you do research on it, you will find out that a few drops in your eyes can make you permanently blind. Large dosage of it could put you in a coma, or worse, death. So I found it ridiculous that in the end, Alison was able to get her boyfriend out of the tank, open the glass top, throw her boyfriend out, and go back in to get the body, without anything happening to her.

2. Also, bodies are generally drained of blood before they are used for autopsies. So I don't understand how such large trails of blood came out of the bag when Alison was dragging it in the end. Even if you don't know anything about this medical aspect, its kind of silly that you don't see any blood coming out of the body throughout the movie when they initially examine it, and all of a sudden, it is coming in the end when Alison is dragging it.

I'm sure people practicing in this area can find out many other issues, but since I don't know much about it, this is what I was able to figure out from just watching it once.

Non-Medical -

1. Since when did the Aztecs come from Brazil?!? They lived in Mexico. The writers of this movie obviously did not do their research. This is probably the most ridiculous point that was repeatedly mentioned.

2. Okay, historical and medical reasons aside. Let's get to the film itself. I agree with building the suspense, but this movie was just building it the whole time without giving any explanations. For around 20 minutes of the whole movie, I think I only saw Alison walking in the corridors with the lights switching on and off and some Aztec chanting in the background. In the beginning this seemed spooky, but later it was just confusing. I don't think the director had any material for one and a half hours, so he had to put these unnecessary scenes to stretch it.

3. Furthermore, I thought the professor was already dead when Alison saw him in the examining room with a chainsaw in his hand. Now we don't see what happened to him, but in the end, he seems fine again. This did not make sense, because if the spirits spared his life, it should have spared the others as well. I mean, Carlos was just doing research in the library and he dies, whereas the professor disrespects the body by putting it in the tank again, and he only loses a leg? What's going on??

I think that if the storyline was a little more believable, this would have been a very interesting movie. It wasn't totally bad, but it wasn't that good either. All in all, I would say that you can rent this movie once, just out of curiosity, but unless you are a fan of the whole After Dark Horror Fest series, you can skip this one.",1209686400,19,4240,4.409731113956466
2729246,3,B000MEYKDM,"This movie's main interest point was that is was the first movie to use real dead bodies, not a good sign of quality here, but fortunately it turned out to be a pretty good, if somewhat tame ghost story. There's really not much I can talk about here, it was just across the board average, acting, direction, blood, atmosphere, it was all just good. Nothing horrible, nothing spectacular. People will surely be disappointed if they go into this expecting great things, this is a time killer and nothing more. Enjoyable, but you'll probably only watch it once.",1208908800,,558,4.762886597938144

The story is a little different. Very tense and not a lot of gore. The entire cast is pretty good. Corri English is much more than just a cute blonde in this movie. Loved the music, it really takes to from a ""B"" movie to something better. The scenes in the body tank left me holding my breath.
Great rental!",1206748800,,464,4.344827586206897
2729249,5,B000MEYKDM,"Unrest is part of the ""8 Movies to Die For"" series, and thankfully, this is one movie that didn't disappoint.

The writers of the film understand how spooky camera angles and a dreary, quiet setting can really elevate the feeling of being frightened.  Furthermore, we find out what actually takes place in hospitals with the doctors performing autopsies isn't THAT far off from what they do in real life.  That makes the story feel more realistic.  It will definitely make stepping in an autopsy room that much more uncomfortable.

Of course the movie isn't based on a true story or anything.  It's about an evil dead woman who has the power to, in spirit-form, kill the doctors and other people who happen to touch her, or aggravate her in any way.  The writers understood that building up a lot of suspense can really make the whole experience even better.

Don't give the viewers cheap and obvious killing scenes- give plenty of time to build up the excellent suspense and let us figure out whether there really IS any kind of unusual activity going on in the autopsy room with the dead woman laying in that bed.  The story really works.

Furthermore, there's plenty of segments that leave you guessing which direction the story might be heading in.  I could have sworn there was going to be a major twist at the end involving one of the doctors, but it didn't turn out that way.  That's not disappointing- it meant I couldn't predict which way the story was heading, and I appreciate that.

Overall, a suspense that truly was a satisfying late-night experience for me last night.",1203638400,,1583,4.692028985507246
2729250,2,B000MEYKDM,"Just to clarify a couple of terms:

""Overrated"" doesn't necessarily always mean something isn't good.  It just means that the merits do not measure up to the perceived standards or expectations, whether justified or not.  Whether it applies to movies or musicians or athletes or meals or an indefinite list of other categories, there can in some cases still be room for praise even if one expected something better.

Similarly, though the term ""disappointing"" is generally considered non-complimentary, it doesn't necessarily always mean something is bad or that there is no merit or room for praise.  Like the previous term, it also technically means that the merits do not measure up to the expectations.  What may be disappointing in some cases, such as Ryan Howard hitting ""only"" 28 home runs in an ""off season"" or Peyton Manning being ""held to only"" 200 passing yards & 2 touchdown passes in a game, the result is still better than the vast majority of other players in their respective leagues, which happen to represent the best level of baseball and football competition in the world.  Again, this description is sometimes geared to expectations which may or may not be accurately or fairly imputed.

Both of these terms are wholly and inherently subjective by their very nature, and generally apply to a particular (generally individual) perspective.  Both terms could also be used to describe the movie UNREST, but not in a sense that suggests a sublime quality in spite of overreaching standards of expectations.  Rather, they are fitting adjectives for UNREST because the film isn't especially impressive, in spite of a sensationalistic marketing & advertising campaign to hype it as a horror film.

For those not aware but interested in the plotline, UNREST mainly tells about a medical student named Alison Blanchard (Corri English) whose current stage of her residency/internship takes place in the morgue.  One of the cadavers she comes across is that of an alleged prostitute.  Soon afterwards, Alison claims to sense an ominous and eerie ""presence"" in the lab.  It's not long after that deaths begin to befall those around Alison - particularly anyone who has had some kind of contact or direct association with the cadaver.  Through her persistent and increasing sense of foreboding, Alison begins to suspect there is a supernatural connection to the dead woman (whose identity turns out to be more of a mystery than first realized) and that grave danger still awaits those unlucky enough to come into further contact.

To be fair, UNREST isn't a bad movie.  It has modest though adequate production values.  It has a gorgeous actress (Corri English) as its lead principle character, and it essentially has a promising storyline with good potential as a horror film.  What it lacks however is a tangible sense of terror or horror or even much suspense.  The killings are not shown happening and are either implied or the result is shown after the fact, and even then there is not a lot of explicit gore in the aftermath.  Even though the pacing is not especially bad, the lack of suspensefulness or palpable tension gives the impression of a more leisurely cadence.  This makes it a subpar to poor Horror movie, however.  In addition to its weak display (or lack) of horror substance, another thing that makes this film seem worse (or perhaps just weaker) is the exaggerated buildup of its merit as not just a horror film, but as a uniquely and revolutionary type of horror film whose allegedly unprecedented content was supposedly (and improbably) deemed initially too extreme for theatrical release and distribution.  This dubious advertising pretense is not only disingenuous (since it was in fact release in theaters was planned as a part of the over-hyped 2006 Horrorfest/8 Films To Die For marketing campaign), but has been essentially disproven upon viewing the film, which is actually less graphic than many straight-to-rental films with smaller budgets.  Overall, most horror fans have not responded enthusiastically in their feedback.

Blame falls on LionsGate Films for their ambitious and highly sensationalist promotional campaign which gained short term benefits (immediate audience interest) but which also may result in long-term drawbacks (diminished reputation and credibility for future marketing).

As you may recall, in October and November of 2006 there was a hefty marketing campaign launched at targeting horror film fans.  Specifically, the ""HORRORFEST 8 FILMS TO DIE FOR"" campaign, which purported to distribute horror films whose content was allegedly so extreme, that their releases had been hampered for general audiences.  The commercials depicted an effective series of commercials which used a montage of trailer scenes and haunting noises and eerie narration which was broadcast in fairly heavy rotation.  The clips were skillfully put together as to feature abridged footage briefly enough to be intriguing yet remain slightly ambiguous.  The foreboding narrative claims seemed believable, and in combination with a pretty decent website and an imaginative touring itinerary where certain films were available in certain cities on certain days, many people no doubt believed they had unfettered access to a collection of cinematic taboo.  However, many of us pretty much figured out what was going on and what would be the end product (and reaction).

The truth is that these films were not really any more graphic or violent or scary than the films which were getting distribution through Theater or Straight-to-Rental releases.  Granted, these were better-made films than many or most of the marginal work that can be found in the latter S-t-R category, but ironically some lesser films actually have more explicit content as a way of trying to make themselves more marketable and to compensate for their lack of production values.  The resulting opinions about the films of this collection, according to the customer reviews and other forms of feedback, have not been overwhelming favorable.

Hard-core horror fans have 2 things (psychology notwithstanding) which makes them a difficult demographic to impress:  The first is a fairly high capacity for gore and violent content; the second is an increasing gradient of expectations.  These contribute to a rather challenging threshold for terror and fright, which most of the time is not satisfied.  Among the featured films of the package, there were stratifications between the stronger films and the less impressive efforts. Where preferences began to form depended as much on the individual audience member's own psyche and the visual effects proficiency, according as the film's budget production values.

As it turns out, UNREST isn't a particularly scary or gory or even a very suspenseful film - not that these characteristics (or lack thereof) necessarily make for a poor film or that they are even a recommended standard by themselves for what films should aspire to be.  But the people who will want to see this film are Horror fans, or those who are interested in the grandiose (and ultimately dubious) claims of the exceptional and remarkable horror content that this film makes.  A further example of the disingenuous hype surrounding this film is the claim that UNREST is the first film to ever use actual human corpses on film.  It's a pretty boldly provacative and luridly sensationalist assertion (assuming it's true), and even if technically not untrue, it's not in the way that people will likely anticipate (I won't spoil it; I'll let people see if they can spot the ""authentic"" corpses themselves).

At the risk of seeming presumptuous, I am confident that the clear majority of those who see UNREST will be disappointed or at least probably not all that impressed.  Of the eight films from Horrorfest 2006, there are some okay & decent ones.  But UNREST isn't one of the better ones.  Unless the other four movies from Horrorfest 2006 just suck something awful (I saw GRAVEDANCERS, which was okay, and PENNY DREADFUL, which wasn't all that great, and THE ABANDONED, which was well-filmed although languidly paced - and how it got selected as a fan favorite is a surprise and mystery to me, but I digress), then UNREST will be in the lower half of this batch of over-hyped and overrated `horror' films.

The good news is that this year's batch of Horrorfest (2007) films looks better than the previous ones, though that doesn't exactly make them immune to disappointment as well.  Let's hope for the best...",1200268800,,8534,5.144822592324402

Since the film's Director actually was a med student at one time, he's able to offer first-hand familiarity with the terrain. Through his commentary and through the film's action, the viewer is ushered into a very authentic experience of the kind of Gross Anatomy class taken by first-year med students. The dissecting tables, the arrays of dissecting instruments, the formaldehyde tank where bodies are stored, the bodies themselves - are all there.

The plot has been gone over so I won't do that. I will say, though, that the plot was a good, original one. Like 'Penny Dreadful', it leaves things open for a possible follow-up.

The acting is done well... not overdone. The filming itself is very well done with effective use of dark and light. No fancy camera tricks, no over the top special effects. The movie actually relies on the story to pull everything through! Novel idea that seems to have been discarded of late with all the meager offerings (even with remakes).

So what makes these films so special? Well, to me at least, they are as I noted above. They rely on the plot and acting and subtle special effects to pull them through. So far I have seen 'Penny Dreadful', 'Wicked Little Things' and this one. I think 'Penny Dreadful' has been the best so far, but the others are good also.

There is the obligatory atheist/pagan/Christian tirading, a possessed friend, some obligatory bra shots, a fiancee who must obviously go, an ancient curse, a random bee-YATCH send-off, budding romance, a mysterious history, a therapist, a skeptical med professor, off-camera slayings...this is all really too much to try to handle in an under-90-minute framework as this tries to.  The film is simply overloaded, and so it loses all rhythm and drive.

It's a shame that this film couldn't trust the simplicity of the ickiness of a cadaver and the creepiness of it being a little bit alive, something that could have been pursued with great result.  But instead, it has to pile up turn after turn, and the result is this--two stars, but hope that SOMETHING in this fest might produce some true shudders.",1178668800,6,1936,4.830815709969788

2729267,3,B000MEYKDM,"Alison Blanchard is a medical student who is beginning a course on Gross Anatomy. Unfortunately, there seems to be something wrong with the cadaver her group is assigned. The body is of a young woman who appears to have committed suicide due to the wounds on the corpse. The audience actually meets the young woman in the very beginning of the film as she stares at her reflection in a mirror with an unsettling intensity (fans of the game show ""Deal or No Deal"" will be startled to learn the young woman is played by the model Marissa who usually holds case #18). Alison seems to be the only one who notices something is wrong with the  cadaver. She has a feeling something isn't right. This is the general tone of the film. Its all about atmosphere.

The movie is never really about what you see but what you don't see. There is always a tone of menace and dread. A scene early in the film summons it up nicely. Alison has to live alone in an abandoned part of the hospital the students train in due to financial aid complications. The lights activate by motion and immediately turn off when you leave a section. The camera moves along with Alison, who is framed by darknes before and behind her. There is a constant fear of something lurking in the dark around her and you clench up waiting for the motion activated lights to reveal some unspeakable nightmare. In this department, the movie gets it right. Too many films go for the gore and shock factor but forget to be suspenseful. Thumbs up to the filmakers.

Now, the reason the movie only gets 3 stars (maybe 3 1/2) is because there is never a payoff. I love suspense but suspense needs to be released. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. I am one of those few people who did not like ""The Blair Witch Project"". It was a great idea but I needed a sense of menace. Everyone was running around, reacting to things only they seemed to hear and see. If just once during that film the camera passed over a quick moving image in the distance, something to instill physical harm, I would have been hooked. This is the same with the Unrest. You'll get bodies (there is a storage tank filled with formaldehyde that almost becomes comical when every time it is opened it reveals another victim), you'll get an explaination (original but a little underdone), but never a ""watch out for the killer"" moment. It left me a little flat.

I recommend it as a rental. There are some creepy moments worth the time and I will definately keep my eyes out for any future endeavors from the film makers.",1177545600,10,2559,4.449893390191898
2729268,3,B000MEYKDM,"This movie was worth watching, I'll give it that. It didn't need to be as long as it was and it definitely wasn't as scary as they made it out to be. I still want to watch all of the horror fest movies - just out of curiosity I guess.",1177459200,,234,3.7
2729269,4,B000MEYKDM,"It should be confessed that the plot is not especially groundbreaking. Indeed, it is fairly standard. Four medical students begin their quest to become doctors in gross anatomy, where they are given a cadaver that one of them, Alison (played superbly by Corri English), has bad feelings about. Soon, bad things begin to happen. The fianc&eacute;e of one of the four dies shortly after seeing and touching the cadaver. More deaths follow as Alison and another student, Brian (played wonderfully by Scot Davis), try to figure out how to end the string of deaths.

The plot is thus fairly conventional, but director Jason Todd Ipson convinced me early on that this film was worth watching. Once the movie starts in earnest (i.e., when the students begin their first gross anatomy class), the cast takes over. Derrick O'Connor, as the instructor, is wonderful. Watching him welcome the new students, I fully believed that he had been teaching young doctors for years. Indeed, everything about the initial scenes had a clear air of verisimilitude, notably the cadavers and the students' reactions (from vomiting to puerile games). That realism is no doubt testimony to the director's own experience in residency.

Before long, the two young stars, English and Davis, become the focus of the film, and they carry the movie with their performances. The pair, an unlikely combination of an atheist/agnostic (she) who senses spirits and a deeply spiritual man whose theology is not precisely identified, begin to fall in love, and they look so natural and believable that it is hard not to root for them.

There are, of course, flaws. One seems to be the fact that an Aztec curse comes from Brazil. As far as I know, the Aztec Empire was almost exclusively limited to what is now Mexico. But a contrived source of evil does not automatically condemn a film. Think of Loomis' explanation in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/6305546789/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>, the reason for Jason's rampages in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B0002JP572/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>&nbsp;films, or the reason for the emergence of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Evil-Dead/dp/B00005R24K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Evil Dead</a>. On the other hand, Unrest avoids, for the most part, clich&eacute;s despite numerous chances to engage in them.

In the end, what made Unrest work for me cannot be easily listed. Yes, the three actors I mentioned were superb, and yes, the verisimilitude early on helps solidify the scene. But there's something more here, something intangible. There are shades--or perhaps echoes--of John Carpenter. As in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/6305546789/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>, Unrest does not have much onscreen violence or gore (though the scenes of dissection are unflinching). What is suggested here is the key. Unrest does not have the suspense that Halloween does, not by a long shot, but there are indications that with a couple more films, Ipson could truly find his stride. Until then, I'm glad he produced Unrest.",1177459200,3,3301,6.002123142250531

It is interesting that they used real cadavers and I guess if you get grossed out by medical stuff, then this might be a little upsetting, but overall it was a weak film.

The plot was easy to follow and did not meander.  The one thing I really had trouble dealing with:  Was that formaldahyde they were swimming in?  Holy smokers!!!

2729276,4,B000MEYKDM,"this really isn't a horror movie (at least until it gets closer to the end). it's really a suspense thriller. a lot of the criticism for this movie comes from people expecting certain things from the it (and being that it was marketed as one of 8 films too shocking to be released, that is understandable.) but the music, the directing, the acting and the script are all very solid. it's not a slick hollywood film, and you can sense that it had a modest budget. but the film manages to hold the ""suspension of disbelief"" that most movies of the genre fail to do. while it doesn't do anything especially different than things you might have seen in other movies, it is a very good low-budget movie.

of the three movie i have seen from the ""horror fest"" (gravedancers and dark ride being the other two), this is the best, although the least ""horror""-like and with the least amount of ""special effects"". if that is what you are looking for, you may be disappointed. if not, you should be pleasantly surprised with this indie thriller.",1176336000,8,1033,4.553763440860215

Sometimes there are movies that I think have a terrible plot (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-in-Space/dp/B00004RCK5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost in Space</a>), but are still entertaining (mostly because of the absurdity of it), some movies are entertaining because of a very well thought out plot (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000M5AJQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>). Either way, if I've been entertained, that's the point.

But after watching this movie, I'm not even really sure that I was entertained.

We went to see ""Unrest"", part of the 8 Films to Die For series, which has not gotten a lot of publicity as of late. I'm not sure why their marketing department has done such a minimal job of advertising, but this whole series of movies had great potential to be something big...unfortunately, it wasn't.

First off, it was shown in the middle of November, with a run of the 17th-19th only. Why wasn't it done over Halloween? That's when people are expecting scary movies, and the timing right before the 31st would have been perfect. People are starting to get into the Christmas movie mode now, as was evident with The Santa Clause 3, which was showing at the same theatre as the Horrorfest.

Second, the advertising. We didn't even see commercials for this thing on TV until a week before. For something as bold as this, 8 movies over one weekend, you'd need to plan this event well in advance. If you're a scary movie buff, like some of my friends are, this would have been an entire weekend at the theatre. You can't just drop everything when you find out about things 4 days before they happen. Better beef it up for next year folks! Get the message out early!

On to the movie - Unrest. Here's a brief synopsis from the movie website:

  ""Alison Blanchard begins her journey to become a physician in her Gross Anatomy class, where she must confront rows of cadavers and her own fear of mortality. When the sheets are drawn back revealing her cadaver, Alison senses a presence in the lab. Her jaded professor chalks it up to first year ""jitters"" but her worries increase when a friend is found dead in the basement. Alison must find out the truth behind her cadaver before its angered spirit can wreak further vengeance on those who dared to disturb the body.""

The movie has won all sorts of independent film awards (actress, director, art direction, picture), but I'm really not sure why. I didn't see any of the other 7 movies, so I don't know what it was compared against, but this movie just did not entertain me as a whole. Did they get awards because they actually used real cadavers? I don't know - they should have hyped that part up more in their marketing...that would have brought in the goth crowd I'm sure.

The opening sequence, I will admit, freaked me out. It's just a camera looking into a woman's eyes, and she doesn't blink, ever. The camera moves, her eyes move with it, no blinking. It made me absolutely uncomfortable. I started blinking just so I wouldn't have to see her not blinking. I'm sure this is some sort of phobia, but let's move on.

The cinematography was actually very good. I liked the use of light, camera angles, and the realism of the shots. You actually felt like you were inside the hospital and experiencing the claustrophobia of it. Unfortunately, the plot did not back up the well-done visuals.

I don't have any negative comments about the acting, it was a group of actors I've never seen or heard of before, so I know nothing about their backgrounds, resume, etc. They were all fine. The plot however, was scattered at times, and overly predictable at others. So that's what I want to focus on.

The cadaver that the main team is assigned to, in their Gross Anatomy class, apparently was an archaeologist who uncovered a ruin of about 50,000 bodies, thus releasing their spirits that are not at rest. The spirits can't rest until they are properly buried. Apparently this made her go insane, and she began to think she was an ancient Aztec god, and became a serial killer. She was also into S&M and regularly cut herself with glass, who knows why.

The lead female character senses that something is wrong (maybe that the body breathes while they cut it? or maybe because the body is warm to the touch?), but she is an atheist/agnostic (we never know really), and that creates some strange plot element with her and a peer - but it doesn't go anywhere so doesn't really add to the film.

The lead female sees a psychologist (we don't really find out why she went there or who this woman is - she's an undeveloped peripheral character), who is trying to help her understand that these feelings are normal for first year students. But the girl is insistent that something is wrong, and she sets off to find out who the cadaver really is (they don't know at this point, and she's risking getting kicked out of medical school just for trying to find out).

In a plot jump that is not well explained, they discover who the woman is, and receive video tapes of her from Brazil. Why she was video taped, who knows, and why someone in Brazil would disclose them, who knows that either. But it happens. Meanwhile, people are dying: The fiance of one of the students, two of the cadaver handlers, and a policeman. The guy whose fiance died, he's now gone insane and kills himself. Who is next? Apparently anyone who has touched the body. And that would be another one of the students, while doing research on Aztec gods - killed in the library.

They have to put her body to rest before she can kill again! Ahhhhhhh!

But before they can do that, they have to find her body, because the teacher has ""gotten rid of it"" at the request of the psychologist. But guess what? He didn't really get rid of it, he simply put it into the body holding tank! Oh no! You know what that means, the kids have to get it out of the tank in order to give it a proper burial. And things are never as simple as they sound.

The most tense part of the movie, when I could actually feel the entire audience getting worried, was the scene in the tank. It brought up fears of claustrophobia, drowning, and being in a big waterbath with dead people. Yuck. Ew. Gross.

But anyway - they get the body, after a few more accidents happen (namely the professor gets his leg cut off and the lead male getting slashed in the back), and the body parts of the cadaver get shoved into an incinerator (after being drug down the hallway inside a conveniently large black duffle bag, trailing blood through the entire hospital which is apparently completely uninhabited), with a gratuitous ""Die B****"" from the lead female. Really unnecessary line I think - sort of like ""I'll be back!"".

Anyway, the story ends with the lead female realizing that in order to really put the cadaver's soul to rest, they have to return the ashes to Brazil where the woman had uncovered those 50,000 bodies. Suddenly she and her boyfriend (another student who has helped her along the way, and the one who was slashed after the dive into the tank) are in the mountains. They dump the ashes at the entrance to a cave, realizing that since the body was incinerated at the school, her soul might still be there and not here with the ashes. Oh my! Please tell me there won't be a sequel.

And thus ends my review of Unrest. It had so much potential...but plot jumps, and non-intuitive story connections made it more confusing, than entertaining.",1175644800,12,7768,4.721565731166913
2729280,2,B000MEYKDM,"The story line is not very cohesive, ideas are just kind of tossed around, maybe this maybe that. A person dies, well just another day sort of feel. Music is used to create tension instead of actual happenings. This can be annoying when mundane activities are masked with music filled anticipation which then falls flat. You know these kind of movies.

Heres an example of one occurrence in the movie....

After a few minutes, a guy finds his fiancee dead in a large puddle of blood. She bled out they say. It is later found that something ruptured inside her heart. OK, why all the blood outside her body within minutes?

The creepiest thing in the movie is a vat where cadavers are kept in the lab, no its not that bad.

No you don't see any zombie action either, its only suggested and leaves you waiting for it.

2729281,5,B000MEYKDM,"I don't understand how the previous reviewer gave this 1 star.  It seems that more and more people these days think horror is supposed to be an over the top gore and creature fest.  I live in San Jose and was lucky enough to see this film originally at Cinequest and believe me, there were plenty of people disturbed by the images that they saw.  I've never seen such a realistic portrayal of a gross anatomy lab and now I'm glad I never pursued the medical sciences.  Believe me, I'm a big fan of the horror genre and about 90% of the stuff seems to be more campy than creepy, but this movie is a keeper.  Especially if you know somebody going to med school.  I have a couple of friends who are in med school and I'd sure like their opinion of the gross anatomy lab.

This movie was part of the After Dark Horrorfest that I missed locally so I'm glad the whole collection is out on DVD.  Personally, I'm glad that there has been a revival of Horror films and I would encourage everyone to support these kinds of films because they are at the forefront of content (video games also) that is targeted when people look to place blame on all that ails society.  Am I being overly generous with my 5 star rating?  I think not.  I usually only give such ratings to movies that have genuinely moved me, made me change my perspective on a subject or teach me something new.  In this case I see autopsies and organ donation in a whole different light.",1175040000,9,1443,4.284132841328414
2729282,4,B000MEYKDM,"The one thing I can say for sure about ""Unrest"" is that if you ever thought it would be a good idea to strip down to your underwear and jump into a tank filled with corpses floating in formaldehyde, then this 2006 horror film will persuade you otherwise.  Alison Blanchard (Corri English) is a new medical student who is sleeping in an unused wing of the hospital until she gets her financial aid.  The first assignment in her Gross Anatomy class is to dissect a cadaver and her group consists of Brian Cross (Scot Davis), Carlos Aclar (Joshua Alba), and Rick O'Connor (Jay Jablonski).  The order these guys appear in the credits is important because whoever is first is going to be Alison's love interest and the lucky guy who gets to go corpse diving with her.  Things start to get interesting when they discover that their cadaver is a young woman who has been mutilated.

Alison's first reaction is to lose her lunch and pass out, but the more they work on ""Norma,"" as the guys have named her, the more Alison feels that there is something not just right (she literally says, ""I think my cadaver wants something from me"").  When people start dying, Alison becomes convinced this has something to do with the cadaver and she starts trying to find out where the body came from, who ""Norma"" really is, and why she is trying to communicate with Alison from beyond the giant tank of corpses floating in formaldehyde.  We know it has something to do with what we saw in the prologue of the film, but connecting the dots is not easy.  However, the Aztec music that starts popping up provides a clue as the body count starts to rise.

That tank is really what you are going to remember from this first feature by director Jason Todd Ipson, whose short film ""The First Vampire: Don't Fall for the Devil's Illusions"" is now in pre-production as a full-length film.  I should say that is what you will remember in terms of what creeps you out about the film, because the selling point is that Alison's Gross Anatomy comrades look like they showed up for the casting call for ""Grey's Anatomy.""  The character of Alison has the virtue of being smart, if unwise, in finding out what is up with ""Norma,"" but then again I always have my doubts about characters in horror films who have sex when they know horrible things are happening.  Usually the sex scenes are reserved for the idiots who are totally unaware of what is going on.  Originally I rounded down on ""Unrest"" because of the bit with the guy in the straightjacket, because I would think a hospital should know how to restrain somebody for their own safety, and some other bits of business that provoke laughs instead of suspense or horror.  But this was a DVD where the commentary track tipped the scales the other way.

In terms of the Special Features on this DVD, Lionsgate is into this bit where when you put the disc in your immediately get trailers that you have to skip through to get to the menu.  The trailers are one for the Horrorfest DVDs and then the other six films that got released along with ""Unrest"" (""Abandoned"" got left out because it earned the general release).  However, the commentary track by director Jason Todd Ipson and film editor Mike Saenz, a USC film school buddy, is excellent and well worth listening to, not only in terms of dissecting the film (hee hee) but also for Ipson's explanations as to what really happens in Gross Anatomy classes in med school.  Consequently a lot of things in the film where I thought, ""No way,"" Ipson says ""Way,"" and I have to take the man at his word.  There is also a 7-minute ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette where Ipson does cover some of the same ground as the commentary, but does give everybody else a chance to talk about the film on camera.  So if you are on the fence regarding checking out ""Unrest,"" the commentary track should definitely get you to give it a chance. However, I do have to add that the head shots of the characters used for the scene selections do nothing to help me find a given scene I want to select.",1174694400,5,4043,4.512328767123288
