8661983,4,B00KVQ74DE,"Valentine gift for pre teen boy, perfect choice. Grandpa likes it too. Exciting adventure. Good stories well written. Videos a little sort of the full book version, but that is ok. If you like Lost in the Barrens video then go get the book by Farley Mowat, it has a lot more story, excitement and values to share.",1425945600,,313,4.413793103448276
