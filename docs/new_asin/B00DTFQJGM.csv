8597554,4,B00DTFQJGM,"If you knew a person who was a member of the 442 Combat Team, you need to see this video. Be aware that the DVD is a copy of film shot during war time. At times the original film was underexposed, therefore a four star rating.  From a historical perspective, the product is excellent. Thank you to Combat Reels for making the footage available to us Grunts and history buffs. Thank you members of the 442 for your bravery and sacrifice.",1455667200,,436,4.382716049382716
