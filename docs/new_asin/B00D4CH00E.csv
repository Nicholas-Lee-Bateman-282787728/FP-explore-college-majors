The content of ""An Unsung Muse - Classical Song of Black Composers"" DVD was both educational and inspiring. Various narrators described and put into historical context the contributions to American classical music made by several African-American composers.  It was nothing short of a revelation to me. This DVD brings out of the shadows and showcases beautifully many classical compositions by black American composers.
The performances by professional African-American classical artists singing the beautiful and sometimes haunting compositions were simply AWESOME! The ""Unsung Muse ..."" video is a valuable resource to acquire for anyone who is interested in the contribution of African-Americans to the cultural wealth of America.
