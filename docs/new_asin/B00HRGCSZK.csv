8634792,4,B00HRGCSZK,"This is another Japanese TV movie that I saw on a fansite first. I do this often then buy the official DVD or manga when it is released to try and encourage more releases. This is NOT a review of the special movie but of the DVD itself, speciality the English subtitling.

Compared to the DVD of the TV series the DVD quality had a highly consistent quality. I really wish the words that pop up (as they do in manga) and the signage and evidence text had been subtitled as you would for hearing impaired viewers. Only once did the speed of the subtitles mess up but only by about 10 seconds and then it was caught up. Otherwise it was easy for my family to follow the evidence and the mystery along with the main characters I'm very glad I bought this.",1454025600,,752,4.222222222222222
