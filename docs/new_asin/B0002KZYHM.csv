2102775,4,B0002KZYHM,"From a production and visual standpoint ""The Empty Mind"" is definitely a 5, but from the standpoint of a deep discussion about Mushin (No Mind) it is lacking. The film is marketed with a focus on Mushin...however the subject is only briefly touched on. Those expecting an in depth discussion of the spiritual aspects of martial arts may be dissapointed in the film.

However, if as a lay person you are interested in a well produced, visually impressive film that depicts martial arts in a realistic and beautiful fashion, ""The Empty Mind"" is a great film.

I give the film a 2-3 for its treament of Mushin, but a 5 for its production value and good basic knowledge of martial arts.",1179100800,2,682,4.628099173553719
2102776,4,B0002KZYHM,"This is a great film with insight and no insight. It's The Empty Mind.

Masters thoughts and views are priceless.",1178928000,,113,4.65
2102777,4,B0002KZYHM,"The key thing about this documentary is that it only revolves around the analysis of the ""empty mind"" as opposed to analysis of the martial art itself. If one should choose to buy this product, be forewarned that it provides little to no description of how to practice any of the martial arts.

Also, note that if one does not practice martial arts, it would relatively difficult to comprehend at the level that they are expecting you to. Although this review was not meant to attack non-practicioners, it is most definetely NOT a starting point for beginners.

Besides that, the DVD includes a great deal of unique footage that is worthy of watching. If you have any interest in the mindset of the martial artist, this is definetely the DVD for you. If you're looking for a DVD that teaches, this is not for you.

Quality is top notch. Scenery, footage, all filmed on the spot with no interference from the producers. No stage was set up (apparently) during the filming. Everything that you see in this DVD is exactly what you would see if you walked into a martial arts practice environment.

Overall - Highly Reccomended for anyone interested in the philosophical aspect of martial arts.",1175299200,13,1190,4.734299516908212
2102778,3,B0002KZYHM,"As an entry level movie for those beginning to look at Empty Mindedness, this movie is good. It captures some key points of what Empty Mindedness is about in Martial Arts, but some of the Martial Demonstrations are disappointing. The majority of the demonstrations of Shaolin were the usual scenes which one will find in most documentaries about shaolin with nothing truly standing out. The fighting was choreographed in a modern wushu style but it was to the point where one could tell that it was choreographed and the preformers were boxed in by a rigid routine. The Qi gong conditioning with the spears is always impressive but again it was nothing new. Also the Kendo conpetition was nothing more than people yelling and beating each other quickly with sticks. Not much technique could be gathered from the preformance but there was plenty of yelling and hesitant blows. What used to be tactical, and focused fights, mocking what was once a life or death match of steel swords.

The demonstrations of the Karate impressed me because of the knowledge and skill of those preforming the technique and this p art of the film is worth watching a few times. Also the Aikido was well preformed although there was not enough to show its application in an actual situation like many of the other arts. The scenes from Wu Dang mountain were impressive in some ways but not in others. The flexibility of the practitioners were impressive some of the other skills like the forms. However,the sparring again seemed to choreographed although done better than the sparring from shaolin, it was not free.

The most impressive scenes in the movie came in the form of the Qi Gong ( all of it in any section) and the masters practicing unchoreographed in the park in Bejing. These masters/practictioners truly followed the mushin or no mindedness technique of immediate reaction to any situation. The movements as displayed were choreographed in the forms but not in application. Also, it is as if they have practiced the forms to the point where they have become part of the practitioner and not a choreographed series of steps. They have gotten to the point of no form.",1168905600,13,2157,4.827027027027027

Braeley has the unique pleasure of finding and interviewing these masters of so many arts. It is worth getting the disc just to see one master let alone the many listed. However, at 81 and been interested in the martial arts for 50 years I am pleased to see that I am not the only one getting a few wrinkles here and there, but can still strike like a thunderbolt..!!

There were only a couple of segments that I didn't care for, like the acrobatic show wushu in the beginning. No matter. This documentary has top-rate directing, editing, narration (and music) of professional filmmakers. It's artistic and colorfully shot.",1465776000,,340,5.5576923076923075
8028741,5,B0002KZYHM,"Great documentary film about the ""empty mind"" within the different martial arts, including Kung Fu. I would recommend this documentary to martial arts practitioners only, since other people would not understand nor appreciate the subject. It is not a ""fun movie"" to watch, but a highly professional film on a specific subject -for connoisseurs only!",1443139200,,349,5.363636363636363

8028744,3,B0002KZYHM,"I was going to purchase this one for a while. I saw that Amazon is playing it for really cheap. I rented it through amazon and watched it once, no need to see it again. Thanks Amazon.

It is a must see for those that love the art. You won't really learn much. This is not a HOW TO video. It is a broaden your horizon video. I enjoyed watching it very much and would watch it again if someone asked me to.",1304035200,4,404,3.8674698795180724
8028745,5,B0002KZYHM,"I really enjoyed the in-depth look into the various Eastern martial arts, particularly karate. Those who practice martial arts will find much value in the words and insight these masters offer through this documentary.",1296000000,,218,5.4411764705882355
8028746,5,B0002KZYHM,"Jon Brailey has yet again done a terrific job in bringing the philosophical and psycological side of the far east to us in this terrific film showcasing some of the top masters of the martial arts.  Names like Ueshiba, Kanazawa, Okazaki and many more show the art the way it is meant to be practised.

Hats off to yet another fabulous film I enjoyed from the beginning to the end.

I think the film touch only the surface of the things. The problem may be the want of the film maker to touch to many kind of martial arts. Maybe a focus on 2 or 3 of the martial art was enough. I find the DVD nice but a bit shallow.",1187222400,,442,3.868131868131868
