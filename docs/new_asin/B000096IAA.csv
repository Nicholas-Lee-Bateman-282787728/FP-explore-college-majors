1879974,1,B000096IAA,"This film is appropriately titled, because that's all it is. Absolute trash. I couldn't look myself in the eyes in the mirror for a week, knowing that I actually paid for such waste. The description for this movie is completely innacurate, and I'm absolutely perplexed as to why the British Broadcast Corporation would ban this. I wish that I could meet the director of this defilement of cinema, simply to spit in his face and demand my hard-earned money back.

 Reading this, I am absolutely sure that Amazon will not post this review, and it is likely the first and last time that you will ask me to post a review. But it is good to let you know that I just paid you for absolute putrescence.

 Aside from this purchase, and other than the order that I have been waiting almost one year for, all of my other orders have come in a timely fashion and have proved quite enjoyable for me. Thank you.",1229731200,5,898,4.424242424242424
1879975,5,B000096IAA,"This DVD was the last of my short lived fascination with British crime. In ""Scum"" we got to see some of the English Youth Correctional system in action. Apparently this movie was so controversial that it was banned for life by the BBC. It is disturbing but not nearly as haunting as the American version ""Bad Boys"" starring Sean Penn. Yes us Yanks tend to make things better (or worse depending on who you talk to!) We do take things to the extreme, but this film is already out there.",1222128000,4,485,4.4
1879976,5,B000096IAA,"I watched the first version of this film, but had to wait a couple of days before I viewed the latter version of two years later.  It was THAT strong -- brutal and vile.  ""Man's inhumanity to man"" fits this film perfectly.

Yes, out-of-control youth must be dealt with, but not by inhuman, depraved authoritarians!  The administrators of this borstal  (reformatory) were all sick, demented sex perverts, who seem to get pleasure out of watching these young men devour one another.

Both versions are brutal, but the remake went even further, especially the greenhouse rape.  In the first version, there were two harmless-looking lads who attacked ""James"".  In the sequel, three toughs were the perpetrators. The attact went on for what seemed, several minutes (screen time).  For the victim, it probably felt like hours.

Both films are nearly identical with some of the same actors repeating their roles, especially the lead, Ray  Winstone, but the actors were so good, it didn't matter that all of the originals didn't return.  It was interesting to see other actors take on the parts.

The latter version does seem more ""modern.""  But the sexual angle was played down.  In the second version, Winstone's character didn't seek out a ""wife"" to take care of his sexual needs.  Also, the suicide of the rape victim was more graphic, therefore shocking.

A hardcore version of the movie is now out called ""Borstal Boy"" and it provides what even SCUM couldn't: graphic sex, which was probably the major activity that went on in these institutions, out-ranking violence.",1180742400,10,1566,4.984555984555985
1879977,4,B000096IAA,"Since reading ""The Gulliver's Travels"", an ancient black and white classic publication, a grey color is being associated with too many UK masterpieces.

This movie depicting a brutal ignorant juvenile correction institution has definitely exceeded my expectations by cynically exaggerated screening of human life meaningless and oppressive state employees of whom the major factual task highlighted is annihilating even a shadow of intelligence and individuality of inmates.

Bushing, same-sex gang raping and in-charge deployed voyeurism, suicides, explicit provocations to suite the wards and masters of wards at all governing levels in exchange for own perverted gratification and miserable-in-outer-world benefits, are shocking testimony to a movie- authors' reality for viewers worldwide.",1163980800,4,793,6.2
1879978,5,B000096IAA,"This film made in 1979 pulls no punches in its depiction of life in a maximum security British Borstal institution. Set roughly in the 1960s, the main character, Carling, played by Ray Winstone(LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS) is sent to maximum security for punching a warden at his previous institution, and soon has to face up to a taste of his own medicine from both prisoners and wardens alike. But when he stands up to the 'daddies'(watch out for Phil Daniels of QUADROPHENIA and BREAKING GLASS fame as one of them!) that run the wing and becomes a leader himself, this only a small part of the story. Regular beatings and frame-ups from the wardens are an everyday occurrance. Racism is rife, the language used would never be allowed in a santised Hollywood production today! The violent scenes are extremely graphic, most notably when Carling confronts the daddy of another wing in the prison. Finally, during gardening duties, there is a brutal rape scene and a very disturbing aftermath. In amongst the brutality, a young prisoner called Archer is continually making life difficult for the wardens. The verbal exchanges between him and the Governor(a religious fanatic) are well worth watching and provide much-needed satirical comic relief! So if you can get hold of a copy(it's available in the UK much more easily now since the ban was lifted), it comes highly recommended, but be warned, it is not for the squeamish!",1085529600,7,1433,4.925619834710743
7989840,5,B000096IAA,"""Scum"" is one of the best films of which you've never heard primarily because it features a graphic male on male gang rape scene.  Concerning the imprisonment of teenage males, the movie is ""Lord of The Flies"" on acid.  It is a portrait of the abuse of government power and illustrative of how tenuous a grasp individuals hold upon their own freedom.  ""Scum"" was commissioned...and consequently banned...by the BBC because of its shock factor.  Surely, teenagers weren't imprisoned and subject to conditions that left them raped and suicidal.  Not in The Queen's England!

Of course they were.

""Scum"" is still being enacted in reality...in England...in America...anywhere a person in a position of power on a government payroll can commit a crime and get away with it.  Diplomatic immunity has its privileges, does it not?",1454716800,,823,5.08955223880597

7989845,5,B000096IAA,"The phrase ""banned"" always gets my spider sense tingling and this movie doesn't disappoint. Although by todays standards the movie is tame I can understand why it raised the red flags back in its day. Ray Winstone steals the movie and it was great to able to watch both versions which are included in the dvd set. The film serves as a window into a time, place, and situation you may never get to experince and thats what all good films should do.",1368576000,2,447,4.397590361445783
7989846,4,B000096IAA,"This is one of the best underground films of the 70s I have never heard of that think I have seen. Its a bold, dark and relentless story of just how unforgiving unfair and brutal life can and does get inside of a boys reform school in England, or for that matter, just about anywhere where children are subjected to crude and unusual punishment at the hands of their own peers. And a corrupt reform system that simply doesnt work correctly because adults responsible for runing such programs effectively give over to turning a blind eye and the result is a corrupt way of thinking and lack of responsible rulership. This is truly a depressing and dark film that offers very little in the way of a positive message. There is however a moment here and there where one individual decides he will not be dominated by cruel and brutal human beings, and takes action. That is indeed a memorable segment of this film. While the movie has no social redeeming value, it does subject the viewer to consider just how completely rediculous the situation of incarceration for youngers can become when a beaurocracy that is meant to control it has no honorable leaders to implement it appropriately. The film is realistic, well acted, and moveing at moments, and I think its one of the better films you may have never heard of from the 70s. A better film than I expected.",1367625600,2,1357,4.6115702479338845

7989848,5,B000096IAA,Brilliant! It's a time capsule as well as real timeless drama. The dirty 70's. And the biggest honor to the publishers of this DVD version for to have kept the original aspect ratio intact on the release.,1298160000,,204,4.54054054054054
