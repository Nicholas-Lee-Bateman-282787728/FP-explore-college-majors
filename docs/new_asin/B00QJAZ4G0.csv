6872161,1,B00QJAZ4G0,"The only highlight in this turd of a film was where one of the Baldwin brothers gets kicked in the face in the beginning. The rest was a convoluted, poorly written, even more poorly acted pile of crap. You would be better off spending 90 minutes banging your head against a wall than watching this nonsense.",1428192000,4,307,4.5
6872162,2,B00QJAZ4G0,"I kill every day, but Im not a criminal. Thats crazy. In the future the planet is ruled by a corrupt government. When rebel agent Sponge (Glover) sends Ryan (Baldwin) to collect evidence that will bring them down, he thinks it will be a quick stop. Things begin to change quickly and after mercenaries are dispatched no one is safe. This is a movie that is pretty much exactly what you expect. A bunch of actors past their prime trying to pull off an Expendables like movie. This is a movie that is hard to review though. In terms of plot and quality its pretty terrible, but on the other hand when you see the cover and rent it that isn't what you care about. Pretty much if you like movies like this you are going to rent it anyway, if you don't you wont. Overall, exactly what you expect, I give this a C-.",1426464000,,809,4.225806451612903
6872163,1,B00QJAZ4G0,"They should have released it on April 1st because this had a group of good actors purposely performing as though they had never acted in their lives. Bad dialogue, bad cinematography, bad sets, bad costumes, bad musical score, bad everything. Hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. This makes Sharknado look like a work of cinematic art. If you really love truly bad movies you will not be disappointed.",1422489600,2,409,4.774647887323944
6872164,4,B00QJAZ4G0,"The film takes place somewhere USA in 2047. Sponge (Danny Glover) opens up with a confusing narration as an explanation for the current state of the US. Sponge belongs to an organization called ""Green War"" who are at war with the ""Confederacy."" They hack into satellites and use them for communication, then destroy the information when the Confederacy re-hacks into it. A particular satellite went down without the data being destroyed. Wilburn's (Stephen Baldwin) job is to destroy the chip. Unfortunately it fell into one of the many ""radioactive zones"" where nuclear waste is haphazardly dumped. While there, the radiation is ""fryin'"" his brain. Colonel Asimov (Rutger Hauer) has a phantom operation going in the area and hires Lobo (Michael Madsen) to burn the mountain of bodies and help out. Daryl Hannah is there because Neva Leoni couldn't handle all the eye candy.

This film was a stinker. It was so bad, I liked it. Madsen had his own swagger music to open a car door, light a cigarette and stand there. Three bullet shots to the head to far from fatal. Rutger Hauer looks like he is wearing a converted German Nazi uniform and what was that cracked skull on Hannah's uniform? Just an extra patch laying around?

The nuclear science was a farce. There is no such thing as a anti-radiation drug. Radiation would effect the brain last, not first. It does not cause hallucinations. There is really no need to dispose of radioactive material in a haphazard fashion, even if the industry was allowed to do it. I had to laugh when they showed multiple cooling towers when they talked about radioactive waste. While the towers are ominous, many plants don't have them. They simply cool the cooling water before it goes back into the river. They are not radioactive. That comes from ""the stack."" And you don't venture into any area ""saturated with cesium and plutonium.""

The first kill scene of a shotgun to the head made me laugh with the blood splatter. However, after that the film didn't live up to its original grindhouse style and attempted to become a message film instead.

Some lines from the film :

Madsen: ""You can trust me. I believe in God.""
Hauer: ""I kill everyday, but I am not a criminal.
Hauer to Hannah in uniform: ""Stop looking so sexy.""

Politically the film meets at the far left and far right with common conspiracy theories about haves and have nots, Illuminati and Bilderbergs.

The film works as a cult drinking film with everyone wearing aluminum hats to keep the government from stealing your thoughts.

8691543,1,B00QJAZ4G0,What did I just watch?  I'm pretty sure this movie is a joke because I find it hard to believe that someone would or even could make a movie this awful unintentionally. I kind of feel like maybe it has to be like a genre mockery like snakes on a plane only they're mocking dystopian sci fi but did a really bad job? It's bad.

8691548,1,B00QJAZ4G0,"My expectations on ""Death Squad"" was that it would be a B movie but that it might be entertaining. I also wanted to see it because of the cast. It starts out as an average low budget postapocalyptic sci-fi movie but soon tries to be deep and smart but only ends up a confused mess with a convoluted plot that gets less interesting with every turn.

Despite the impressive cast, the movie has absolutely nothing to offer. It didn't entertain at all and I was glad when it was over.",1455148800,2,480,4.333333333333333
