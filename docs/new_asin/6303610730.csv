691613,5,6303610730,Kids love this video. I'm a home daycare provider. Over the yrs I have collected over 100 kids videos. Barney Songs seems to entertain my daycare kids ages 14 months to 5 yrs greatly. My kids cheer when I put this video on. I'd say it's in the top 10 favorite videos of my daycare kids. This a must have video for anyone who has a Barney fan in their house.,1127088000,12,357,4.042253521126761
691614,5,6303610730,"Hey there!  Lauren here.  I hope everyone is doing well.  I just wanted to let everyone know that this video is WONDERFUL!  I just bought it and I LOVE it!  My nieces do too.  This video has some of my favorite songs.  And it stars three of my favorite kids.  Julie, Kathy and Min!  The songs teach things like how to use your indoor and outdoor voice, not to leave the water on when you brush your teeth and how much fun it is to eat healthy snacks.  It's really a good lesson learner for kids and fun for fans who like certain kids in the show.  Some of the songs that are in it are:

""I Like Autumn""  from ""On the Move""

""Growing""

""Mr. Sun""

""Riding in Barney's Car""

""Here Kittycat, Here Kitty-Kitty""  from ""Camera Safari""

""Snackin' on Healthy Food""

""Taking Turns""

""Our Indoor and Outdoor Voice""  from ""Room for Everyone""

""Alphabet Soup""  from  ""Room for Everyone""

""The Bread Song""  from ""Any Way You Slice It""

""The Airplane Song""  from  ""Up We Go""

""Brushing My Teeth""  from  ""Brushing Up on Teeth""

""Scary Stories""  from  ""It's Raining, It's Pouring""

""I Love You""

And many more!  This is a must have for any Barney fan or any child just being introduced to Barney!",1108080000,15,1179,4.382075471698113

691616,5,6303610730,"My daughter, at 20 months, used to only watch the Julie Clarke Baby Einetein Collection.  She started showing some interest in the Barney television show so I bought this video.  She absolutely LOVES it!!!!  She only wants this video played.  Since there is not much storyline, and mostly singing, she is mesmerized by the video and even copies the choreography.  I would highly recommend this video for any child used to the genre of Baby Einstein Videos - Baby Bach, Mozart, Doolittle, Shakespeare, and Van Gogh.  My daughter used to only want to watch those videos, but now only wants to watch this video in particular.  I am trying out the other Barney videos, but I haven't found any others that captivate her like this one.  I think it's the fact it has more songs than dialogue.  I would highly recommend this video for the under two child, who appreciates more song than dialogue!!!",1012694400,23,890,4.7272727272727275
691617,4,6303610730,"Almost an hour of non-stop Barney songs! My 12-month-old boy loves this tape. Now, he's figured out that if he points to the videos and says ""Ba,"" he gets to see the Barney video, so he asks a lot. This  video is pretty good as Barney goes. I find I like it better than the show.  One of the songs is about using your ""inside voice"" in the car or  at school, and your ""outside voice"" when you're playing outside.  It's very cute. Another one that makes me laugh is about not letting the  water run when you brush your teeth. So specific! :o)
Some of the other  songs are:
Because I'm Growing, and So Are You
Mr. Sun, Please Shine  Down on Me
Alphabet Soup
Five Butterflies Sitting on a Fence
Green  Grass Grows All Around
I Love You, You Love Me (of course)",945648000,67,757,4.172413793103448

This is a compilation of songs from the older episodes. I have purchased older and newer episodes and my daughter prefers the older episodes too. I feel like the older episodes are geared toward a younger age group. Maybe because the episodes grew as the fans grew older, when Barney was first popular....(?)",1475971200,2,448,4.6125

692042,4,6303610730,"Too many children in the Barney videos. Would rather see more Barney, Baby Bop and Mr. __. But you certainly get a lot of songs!!  We're going to wait til our girl is 18mo. For a one year old, there's just too much going on and too much scenery. We have a Brazilian video that is just singing and dance moves by 1-3 large animated characters and she loves it (35 short videos). We were surprised to find that ""Barney Songs"" plays on Region 4 DVD players as well. All the other Barney videos we purchased only play on Region 1, as given in the description. We also have a "" ""Barney Sing & Dance"" sampler that came with the Barney stuffed animal. This seems to be a better Barney introduction for the pre-toddler or one year old.",1335312000,,727,4.268115942028985

After watching this DVD daily, she ask to brush her teeth, say's airplane and so much more.  For these reasons, I rate this DVD 5 stars.",1311552000,,407,4.373333333333333
