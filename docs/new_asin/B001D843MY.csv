8430089,3,B001D843MY,I liked that the animal in it appeared to survive. Far too often they have to kill off the cat or dog to show how evil someone is.,1518566400,,130,3.6785714285714284

8430094,2,B001D843MY,"Sorry...  I can't go higher than a 2 on this one...

Pros - I thought the lead did a really good job / Most of the camera work was reasonable / I wasn't paying very close attention, but I liked a couple of the background songs they played during specific scenes / I actually like the plot line as well

Cons - Very predictable / The movie moves WAY too slow...  it's starts out quick, and I'm like ""cool""...  and then it just drags for the next hour...  Yes, I got it already, the lead girl is depressed...  You don't have to make me depressed too / The ""jump"" scares weren't very scary at all

So, overall, my vote is pretty much a pass on this one...  That said, I do think the lead actress did a really good job, and I hope she continues doing movies...  just better movies...  the ""shadowy stalker behind the girl as she shifts in her chair"" is just WAY too cliche...",1516233600,,871,4.155688622754491
