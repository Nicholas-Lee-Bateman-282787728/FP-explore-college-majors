7921718,5,B00004S4YW,"I agree with the others here who have given this four or five stars. I recently tripped on a leg of my sofa and went straight ahead for a fall. I studied some martial decades ago, including a combination of aikido and jiu jitsu, and I did a forward roll and thus avoided any injury. At some point in one's life one is going to fall, particularly when one gets older. I have been trying to convince those who work in the area of physical training for seniors to work with aikido or judo professionals to develop and teach Baby Boomers the safest ways to fall. Unfortunately, I have had no success. Books, videos, and classes throughout the country teach only how to try to prevent falls, an effort that is inadequate. Hopefully someone will step to the fore and remedy this.",1429315200,,773,4.450704225352113
7921719,5,B00004S4YW,"The insight that Sensei Bookman was clear, logical and simple to follow.  It is a must for any beginner Aikidoka.  Good Ukemi allows for better involvement and understanding of the art.",1149552000,2,185,4.935483870967742
7921720,4,B00004S4YW,"Bookman sensei explains things well and the demonstrations are excellent.  Some of the actual ukemi taught is a little - well - harsh.  I felt like more time on rolls and less on breakfalls would have been a good thing.  Having said that, though, there was a good deal of time spent on other aspects of ukemi that was excellent.  The time spent on subtle details was especially good for those of us who used to be good at ukemi but are just getting back to Aikido after several years away.",1008633600,9,489,4.34065934065934
