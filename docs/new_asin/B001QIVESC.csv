3765531,1,B001QIVESC,Nowhere near as comprehensive as the Acoustic Rock DVD by Andy Aledort. However a good starter tool for fledgling bluesmen.,1343347200,2,123,5.2
3765532,5,B001QIVESC,"There's almost nothing not to like about this DVD. It probably would not go over well with a real beginner. To really get in to this DVD you kind of need to have the pentatonics drilled in to you sonically so you can pick up the notes by ear in one or two passes. It helps immensely if you've already started scale based improvisation and know the I-IV-V song structure by feel.  That's kind of true of almost all ""blues"" DVDs though outside of the very beginner variety, and is not a shortcoming of the DVD. It had always been hard for me to look at the tab while following the DVD anyway. If you're just building your foundation, this would not be a good choice. An intro book, I think, would be better (I like the Musicians Institute series of books). I think this DVD targets ""intermediates"".",1307059200,9,796,4.378378378378378
3765533,2,B001QIVESC,Without TAB's or fingerboard diagrams of the demonstrated material it is very difficult for a beginner to pick up the licks and techniques.  The close up of the hands does not adequately define the strings being fretted nor the strings being picked.  All in all it is probably pretty good for someone who can pick up these things from watching a guitarist in concert.,1292284800,11,367,4.71875
3765534,5,B001QIVESC,"The Guitar World DVD's are a great way to study the guitar.  I have a degree in music performance (percussion), and have taken to the guitar recently.  These lessons are a great way to study to style, with a teacher who is very solid.  Andy saves me from wandering from teacher to teacher, and these are very cost effective ways to get the information.",1281139200,6,352,4.46875
8335845,5,B001QIVESC,Great starter video,1485216000,,19,5.666666666666667
8335846,5,B001QIVESC,"Andy Aledort is a monster player. You need to know dominant, minor, and 9th chords (yes...that means barre chords) employed during a I-IV-V blues groove. You also need to have the minor pentatonic scale-and the blue notes-very comfortably under your fingers...all 5 positions. At a bare minimum, you need to know position 1 and 2 cold. Mr Aledort communicates as if he is speaking to experienced musicians. He talks about intervals and specific notes. If explaining a phrase in the Bm pentatonic scale, he'll refer to bending the E...he won't say bend the G string at the 9th fret. Certainly not for beginners, but if you've been playing for a bit and want to work on your phrasing/solo chops this is a great DVD. This is certainly more advanced stuff, but you need to challenge yourself along your guitar journey in order to become a more complete player. Every time I watch it I learn something.",1456617600,3,897,4.756410256410256
8335847,2,B001QIVESC,"person who is teaching is not helpful for for the beginner. could be much better with a little instruction to the students,.",1455494400,,124,4.681818181818182
8335848,3,B001QIVESC,"I certainly expected a LOT more given the instructional source for the material presented...  Overall, it has a 'let's get this over and done' feel and overall the individual segments are not very lengthy.  I cannot believe that the pentatonic and blues scales with their scale degrees and fretboard shapes/positions over the neck are not covered...  very hard to imagine one of the target audiences here is beginners and this was NOT included.  I'll keep mine and the price was not too bad, but I am mildly disappointed.  The playing content is quite good, and no doubt there is useful content here, just not a lot of it.  The 'soloing' menu contains only brief overviews of famous blues and blues rock players' styles.",1452124800,2,720,4.813008130081301
8335849,5,B001QIVESC,"AWESOME INSTRUCTION FROM ONE OF THE BEST BLUES GUITARISTS FROM TEXAS. I RECCOMEND HIGHLY IF YOU ARE A MEDIUM PLAYER. I FEEL A BEGINNING PLAYER MIGHT RUN INTO SOME OBSTACLES HOWEVER CAN JUMP OVER THE OBSTACLES WITH ADVANCED STUDY. GOOD LUCK MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

8335851,4,B001QIVESC,Good tutorial,1412640000,,13,6.0
8335852,5,B001QIVESC,"This is a great hands on playing but it is not for someone just starting to play because the licks and turn arounds to songs are for advanced players to be able to learn it. This is a DVD to move you up a few notches to really enjoy the guitar. This DVD is packed with  great styles. To me it is a real straight shooter  hands down. If you are a player then you can get alot out of this.
 I play a 2014 AMA Standard Fender Stratocaster with Custom Shop Fat 50's and it blows me away playing some of the leads on this DVD.
