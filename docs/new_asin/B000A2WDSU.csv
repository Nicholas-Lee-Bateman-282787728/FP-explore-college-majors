8072700,5,B000A2WDSU,"A beautifully executed profile of this venerable sambista and his music. An indispensable piece in understanding the many facets of samba. It also illustrates the background of many Da Viola's famous songs, and shows how the musical tradition is passed on across generations. I saw excerpts on YouTube and decided I must own this one. No regrets.",1295049600,,346,5.087719298245614
