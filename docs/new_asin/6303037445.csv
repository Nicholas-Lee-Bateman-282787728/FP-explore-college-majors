539122,4,6303037445,"Vernon Simpson (Ray Milland) is a graduate student at a Midwestern university with two seemingly unrelated problems in his life.  The first is that he hasn't completed his doctorate in chemistry yet and so isn't qualified for any of the positions, in the academy or in business, that would enable him to marry and support his girlfriend, Deborah Greenleaf (Jean Peters), who just happens to be the dean's daughter.  The second is that starting in April and lasting into October he becomes oddly preoccupied and suffers from a strange tendency toward absent-mindedness--it happens every spring.  That span of months, of course, coincides with baseball season and Vernon, it turns out, is a die-hard fan of the St. Louis club, which just needs pitching help this season in order to be a contender.  So even as Vernon struggles to make his experiments work and to finish his thesis, he hangs on every pitch of every game, oblivious to all around him, including his students and Deborah.
But then the hand of fate intervenes and solves all of Vernon's problems--well, kinda.  A baseball comes flying in through his laboratory window from the nearby practice field and, though it irreparably damages all his hard work, it quite accidentally creates an entirely new and uniquely valuable formula.  This remarkable substance, of which Vernon is only able to salvage one panfull, makes the baseball that landed in it avoid wood.  The next morning Vernon tests his discovery on the practice field and finds that his pitches are indeed unhittable (note that his batting practice catcher is Alan Hale, Jr.--The Skipper), swerving around and hopping over the wooden bats.
Hastily asking a leave of absence from Dean Greenleaf, Vernon hops a train to St. Louis and presents himself to the club's incredulous manager and the initially hostile owner demanding $1,000 for each of the thirty wins he guarantees.  Soon Vernon, calling himself King Kelly so that Deborah's sports-hating father won't know how he's earning a living, is pitching St. Louis to victory after victory.  Veteran catcher Monk Lanigan (Paul Douglas) is put in charge of the flaky but valuable phenom and together they lead the team to the World Series.
Entirely predictable zaniness follows every step of the way, but it's all great fun.  Milland is surprisingly daffy and Paul Douglas is great.  The special effects are joyously primitive.  The fact that Vernon is cheating is a little disturbing--though a strangely common theme of baseball movies from Angels in the Outfield to Damn Yankees to The Natural--but in the end he is inevitably required to rely on himself, rather than weird science.  It remains inexplicable that even a minor baseball movie like this one can be so engaging and entertaining, while other sports (with the exception of boxing) produce almost no good movies.  I've no more explanation for this phenomenon than Vernon evers offers for his formula, but this film proves it true once again.  Watch it every spring.

With this terrific movie available from Amazon on DVD, I've watched it more times and still love it as much as I did at first.

As mentioned in the title of this review, there's something for everyone here. The physics shown in the movie require some ""suspension of disbelief"" by you, the viewer, but the ball-hopping effect is so enchanting that you'll want to believe it. Likewise, the story line wanders off a bit here and there, but keeps you captivated so you'll eagerly follow everywhere it goes.",1402012800,2,770,4.539568345323741

539670,4,6303037445,"I had no idea that Amazon makes DVDs on demand.  This is great, especially since I've wanted this particular movie on DVD for many, many years back when it wasn't made available.  My 7 young children enjoyed this movie just as much as I did way back when I watched it as a child one lazy Saturday afternoon on TV.  It's a classic, innocent movie from when times were simpler (before I was born).  It was a treat to watch this again with a new generation.  I recommend this movie for a wholesome good time (some will point out that it can't be too wholesome due to the premise of cheating - all I can say is that it comes off as innocent & at the very worst it can be a good teaching opportunity for parents).

I'd say the quality was very good - obviously it's an old movie so it's not high def, but I found the picture quality to be more than acceptable - there must have been some digital remastering involved.  Overall, I could detect no difference between a mass produced DVD and this one made to order by Amazon.

someone ate their lunch on it. It also WILL NOT play on early generation dvd players. It won't play

The print is very crisp, considering the movie was made in 1949 and the plot is as delightful as I remembered it.  Ray Milland is a chemistry professor who stumbles on a formula that makes objects repel wood.  Well, he applies this to a baseball....and then guess what.  If you've never seen this film, I give it a whole hearted recommendation.

Twentieth Century Fox has done a marvelous video transfer to DVD.  The clarity is very good, and has a much clearer picture than the old VHS edition.  The only drawback from the DVD is that there are no extras (ie no trailer to watch like on the VHS version) but that is a minor complaint. I'm just so happy it has been put on DVD.  I know people have been waiting and waiting for this transfer to DVD!  So grab a hot dog and a soft drink, or some popcorn and watch King Kelly (aka Ray Milland) make batters swing and miss in this hilarious baseball comedy!",1354924800,17,701,4.312977099236641

They knew that their talent wasn't good enough but if only they had some secret hitting technique or magic pitch that would propel them to the big leagues. Well this movie is the fulfillment of the fantasy.

This is a simple, good entertaining drama. Its black and white but there are some superb special effects for that era. You know that Ray Milland is too old to be a pitcher and Paul Douglas a catcher, but you still root for them. I especially like King Kelly's tryout.",1339977600,,610,4.545454545454546
539823,5,6303037445,"This is a great show!  Humor, sports, science... (well, fantasy science...), likable characters, a little romance, the works!  We start with the poor struggling professor, and the dean's daughter, perhaps not ""forbidden love"" but given the academic class structure of the time a formidable obstetrical to their hopes to find a little happiness.  The plan, complete a long term commercially promising chemistry experiment that will help them better their meager financial situation and give them something substantial to support them when they approach the dean/father with their ""proposal"".  One afternoon as the professor labors at his laboratory - suddenly a baseball flies through the window and the professor sees his great experiment, on which his blissful hopes are riding, dashed (literally smashed) before his eyes, and his dreams run, like the now errantly mixing chemicals, down the drain.  But wait!  Something strange is happening to the baseball that is soaked with the unknown mixture...  And this is where the little kid in us all is released to live the magic that says that anything is possible, and somehow good and even great things can be found in every disaster.  That good people can reach their dreams, even if all the planning and hard work seems thwarted by the harsh realities of life.  This is where the magic comes alive!  Is there still some conflict?  Is there some light moral dilemma still to resolve.  Of course, but in the end even these are resolved with a little more of that magic/disaster mix with which we started.

539870,4,6303037445,"Talk about dated!  However, that's not a knock because ""dated"" many times means fun to watch, and nostalgic for some. This is an entertaining film and very likable.  In one respect, it's very up-to-date: cheating in baseball!

But, if you are a baseball fan or know anything about the game, be prepared. The actors in here have NO CLUE how to throw a baseball or how to bat. This has the hokiest baseball scenes ever put on film. It's almost like those corny Ed Wood and others sci-fi films of the 1950s that are so bad, so corny that they are good, if you know what I mean.

The story is at its funniest when Ray Milland pitches and the ball dispy- doodles around the baseball bats of all the hitters. The college professor had invented a substance in his classroom lab that when applied to something makes it avoid touching wood, so swabbed on a baseball, a bat could never make contact with the ball!  Presto.....Milland goes from geek to baseball hero - without steroids, too (although it's still cheating).

Dumb...but innocent fun and definitely has enough laughs to make it worthwhile watching.  Before every couple baseball seasons, I put this tape in the machine  and laugh. It's got a lot of charm. I'd buy the DVD if someone would put it out!",1235606400,5,1253,4.5625

Surprisingly they haven't remade this one, it is a great movie too. Good cast, story, and direction make this fun for the whole family. When a professor comes up with a material from his lab that causes a baseball to avoid wood bats the results are hysterical.

Ray Miland, and the rest the cast give good performances. Ray Milland typically did serious roles like his award winning ""Lost Weekend"", but he does a fine job in this slightly zany comedy. I am sorry to see this is out of print and the scalpers here want your first born to buy it. We can only hope the studio puts this out on DVD soon. Until then I will keep a sharp eye out for it being televised. Great movie or not I'm not paying thirty-five plus dollars for a VHS tape.",1075334400,36,903,4.375
539877,4,6303037445,"Even if you're not a big baseball fan, this good-natured comedy should still grab you.  Ray Milland stars as a mild-mannered, but all-American college professor who has a secret passion for baseball, and gets a little nutty every Spring, when the season starts up.  His twin passions -- baseball and chemistry -- collide when he accidentally invents a substance that repels wood... just the thing to use if you want to become a major-league pitching star overnight, and rake in the big bucks when every hitter you come up against gets dusted when you use the super goo.

What's weird about this Truman-era film is that Milland is never confronted as being a fraud or a cheat, even though he's obviously behaving unethically and taking unfair advantage of friends and foes alike.  He's worried about getting caught by his fiancee (the reason he's trying to raise the money  is so he can settle down with her), but when he becomes a national sensation, everybody jumps on the bandwagon and becomes a fan, including her sports-hating father, the campus dean. But nobody ever ever discovers his secret and delivers a big lecture telling him it's not right to cheat, etc. etc., and Milland makes it through the season with his fraud undetected.  Setting ethics aside, the screwball elements of this film are quite enjoyable, and even if you're not a big sports buff (I'm sure not) it's a lot of fun.  Recommended!

539878,4,6303037445,"Ray Milland was a rather underrated actor who was equally adept at comedies as he was in dramas.  Here, Milland shines as a professional scientist-turned-baseball-wizard in a side-spitting comedy that has since become a minor classic.  Valentine Davies, who wrote the marvelous script for MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, came up with another winner here. Ray is a mild-mannered chemistry professor in love with the lovely Jean Peters.  Milland's meager salary won't suffice in supporting her however, and he keeps putting off marriage.  While developing a bug repellant for trees, he invents a solution that repels any kind of wood it comes in contact with.  Being an avid baseball fan, Milland concocts a clever scheme to earn additional money...There are many hilarious moments in this little gem, such as Paul Douglas mistaking the solution for hair tonic - his hair does the St. Vitus dance when he uses a wooden brush to comb it!  The hilarious scenes in the baseball fields are terrific because the special effects appear completely natural.",1030320000,12,1039,5.118343195266272
