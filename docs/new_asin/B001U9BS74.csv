8343170,5,B001U9BS74,"signed up for olympic distance NYC Nautica Triathlon.  I needed help w/ swim portion.  Ordered the dvd, which did help me improve my swim and learned all about perpetual motion in the swim leg.  This was my 1st triathlon.  In my opinion, I did well, overall.  DVD gave me confidence and kept me cognitive of how to swim relaxed, use less energy or keeping a good pace for a longer distance, also helpful w/ sighting.  all about open-water swimming.  highly recommended for anyone new to the triathlon circuit or even to those that are seasoned can benefit from great T1 instructors.",1279843200,4,582,4.702970297029703

8343172,4,B001U9BS74,"I really enjoyed this video.  It gives helpful tips on improving open water swimming.  It was mesmerizing to watch.
I highly recommend it.  I don't recommend the basic videos -- freestyle and breathing.",1255737600,3,202,5.0606060606060606
