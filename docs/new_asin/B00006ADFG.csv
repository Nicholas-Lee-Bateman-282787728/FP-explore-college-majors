And Deep Purple hopefully recognizes his importance to that band.",1506211200,,300,4.4363636363636365

7966129,2,B00006ADFG,"Definitely not what I expected. This is a well done documentary on Ian Paice, that mostly deals with how Pearl creates his drums, and Paiste his cymbals. Nothing out of the ordinary, or really custom-made, so if you already know the process, might even get bored. Since he comes from the old school of ""just sit down and do it"", the hand technique section makes no sense at all. I love the attitude but once again, there's no real instruction.

One section that specifically bothered me, is the one where he talks about his sound. His tips on bass drum muffling and tuning are dated and narrow-minded, as are his opinions on sound reinforcement (""This is called a microphone, and this things don't like drums""). He did strike me as someone explaining a subject that he knows little to nothing about. I'm sure it works for him, but yes, once again, nothing you can call ""educational"".

The rest of the DVD is comprised of live shots with Deep Purple. Nothing you won't find on youtube.

Ian Paice will always remain one of my All-Time favourite Rock drummers, Top-5. But this is as far from being an instructional video as you will ever find.",1425600000,,1141,4.610837438423645
7966130,2,B00006ADFG,"First I must say that Ian Paice is my favorite drummer in rock, and I have bought every album/cd from Deep Purple for over 40 years.  I am a drummer myself, and have learned alot from him.  But this cd lacks what is should be, a real teaching aid.  It is basically Ian either promoting his equipment lines, ( which I suppose he gets paid to do) or talking about his life, or just playing live.  There is no real instruction on his drum skills here.  You  can get get much more from him or others for free on Youtube videos. Seeing him play from the side doesn't teach much, because he is playing too fast to learn from.  How can a drummer put out a cd that doesn't actually teach you how to do his beats or solos?  I never thought I could waste my money on anything from the Purple crew, but it seems all the cd's from the Purple gang,  past and present have been disappointing from the past 10 years.",1371772800,3,901,4.132183908045977
7966131,5,B00006ADFG,"ian paice,the backbone for my kinda rock..as i do share the same profession,though am a Maldivian,touring around Maldives..passed 25 pleasant years of performing rock..still i do keep an eye on him...",1274227200,,200,5.483870967741935
7966132,3,B00006ADFG,"I am and always have been (I'm 47 years) a Purple fan (especially mark II). I was looking forward to this dvd. I must admit that I didn't quite know what to expect but certainly not this. It is mainly a presentation of how his drumkit is being build. That's interesting, but I was expecting some personal quotings and some practical drumming from the Man. So maybe it's a good dvd but wrong expectations from my side. Well, in two weeks I will enjoy him live in Copenhagen on the Rapture of the Deep tour. What I say is that it is not a bad dvd as long as you know what to expect.

7966133,5,B00006ADFG,"I have listened to Deel Purple for about 30 yrs and have listened to the drum solos over and over. Unfortunatley when I finally got a chance to see them live, he did not play a solo.
This DVD shows him talking about drumming, making of drums and also lots of footage of him playing live. It is a great DVD for any Purple fan, especially if you like the drumming. I wish I could have attended a clinic while they were in town, as they are shown on the DVD to be very interesting and a good chance to meet a Legend of the drums.",1102636800,7,526,3.9716981132075473
7966134,5,B00006ADFG,"See the man behind the sticks. Ian Paice,the man ,the myth,the legand. The driving force behind my favorite group ""DEEP PURPLE"".A very well done production of life behind the kit. I really felt a natural connection,like he was talking to a fan, not a drummer. But I would think that if you were a ""stick man"", you would get alot of useful information. I just love to here and see him play. He comes across as a guy that anyone could talk to.",1038960000,26,441,4.325301204819277
