1043749,4,6305470286,"Aelita, Queen of Mars is certainly a gem of a movie. Made in 1924, it is a look at how Communist philosophy plays out in speculative fiction during the silent era. Purportedly, it was made on a fantastic budget, and the sets on Mars show it. The costuming for the Martian aristocrats concerns styles that were non-existent at the time, and seem to have arrived out of the 50's American Sci-Fi films. The Martian sets were indeed, outlandish and worth getting the DVD just to see.
The story is slightly weak, attempting to cover too much ground and too many genres for the amount of time presented. However, it does not detract from the important historic value of the picture and the simple enjoyment of watching the tale unfold.
The film displays the humorous exploits of the Bourgeoise Zie, and the stark poverty the Proletariat suffered in 1924 Russia.
In a way, this film could be an equal criticism of both. It takes an inordinately long time for the main character to reach Mars, although Mars is shown throughout the film, following Aelita, queen of Mars as she goes about.
The DVD has no special features worthy of note.  The average scene selection and nothing else, but the restoration work is excellent, keeping true to even the few parts of the film that were intended to be poor quality. It is truly a film worthy of being presented on DVD.",1042156800,2,1353,4.6375
1043750,3,6305470286,"No, this is not some sort of 1950's space babe film! AELITA is a science-fiction SILENT film from the early days of SOVIET cinema! REALLY! The FUTURISTIC SETS here rival those of ""Metropolis"" (which was made three years later)! The story is quite simple! An engineer in Moscow builds a SPACESHIP to travel to MARS so he can meet the GIRL of his dreams! Of course, once he gets there, instead of romance, he becomes involved in a REBELLION by the PROLETARIATE! Are you really surprised? This is a SOVIET film from 1924! Almost TWO HOURS long! Directed by Yakov Protazenov! A FASCINATING film! This DVD also features an ORCHESTRAL score! So none of that organ music nonsense for this film!",1004745600,3,687,4.68595041322314

Still,  for those interested in classic sci-fi or early art films, this is a  one-of-a-kind movie. And the more the filmmakers try to make the  imperialist Queen Aelita look evil, the more alluring she becomes!

1043752,2,6305470286,"Perhaps the first Science Fiction film, ""Aelita, Queen of Mars"" was created in 1924 in the Soviet Union. It was a big-budget feature in it's day, and I image it was quite the spectacle. Today it wears very thin.
I  was hoping to see an adequate silent feature, as many of the Russian films  of this era are quite astounding; ""Battleship Potemkin"", ""Mother"" and  ""Strike"" can all hold their own to modern films. ""Aelita"" is much  different, the plot is quite confusing, the space costumes are laughable  and the acting is, to be frank, lame.
The plot is split into 2 areas; On  Earth and on Mars. A message is sent to radio stations on Earth and  somehow, everyone knows it is from Mars. An engineer named Loss is  fascinated by it and, as my favorite title card reads, ""Works all night to  construct a spaceship to take him there"". The plot on Earth gets muddled by  a murder and some stolen sugar (we're talking post-revolution Soviet Union  where rationing was a part of survival), but the rest of the plot is simply  filler. Meantime, the queen of Mars, Aelita, is spying on Earth,  specifically to Mr. Loss, and is falling in love with him. The short of the  movie is that Loss ends up flying to Mars, makes out with the Queen and  unites the workers of Mars into the comradeship of a socialist Martian  government. This is the common ending to most Soviet films of this  period.
So generally old science fiction films can still have an  unintentional comedic value, and watching the cardboard-box robots, the  plexiglass hats and the `protruding wires for no reason' seem silly.  ""Aelita"" misses on the silly front too, simply by being to long. There are  wide gaps between the ridiculous scenes and the monotonous plot, barley  enough to hold someone's attention. In fact, there are times when it was  just too painful to watch at normal speed.
So I gave this movie 2 out of  5, simply because the costumes are worth laughing at, and the quality of  the film print is decent. The soundtrack is pretty much un-noteworthy, and  there are no extras on the DVD. If you are curious to see some good Russian  Silent films, check out the work of Eisenstein and Pudovkin, and don't  worry about ""Aelita, Queen of Mars"".",963705600,6,2217,4.586734693877551

1043834,4,6305470286,"This silent film leaves a number of different impressions. The first, of course, is happy surprise that this film has survived in such good condition - compared to many other silents, it maintains high image quality throughout. Another impression comes from the remarkable art deco styling of the Mars sets and costumes. I'm no expert on older films, but this offers the most fantastical look of any I've seen to date. Yet another impression arises from the Soviet underpinning of the film, including swipes at self-serving authorities and the workers' bold revolution (complete with hammer and sickle).

The plot had some loose moments, but this remains a wonderful look back as well as an entertaining movie in its own right.

1043835,4,6305470286,"MAIN PLOT POINTS--
The story opens at a radio monitoring station which receives a mysterious message from outer space. In a cubist-like Martian palace, Queen Aelita watches with fascination the alien activities of Earth. She sees the struggling masses and becomes fixated upon a scientist named Los who dreams of building an interplanetary spacecraft.

The Russian portion of this movie has a few subplots that weave loosely around the main issue of Los's suspicions of his wife Natasha's infidelities with an unctuous boarder. His seething anger compels Los to shoot his spouse. He then dons a disguise and builds the rocket (the interior of which looks like a boiler room-- we never do see the outside). Los lifts off for Mars along with a bored ex-cavalryman volunteer (Gusev) and a stowaway wannabe detective (Kravtsov), the movie's bumbling comic relief.

The three Earthlings land safely, and for Los and Aelita, it's love at first sight. While they dally, the amateur sleuth petitions for the seizure of Los, who is now Aelita's consort. There's a coup against Los and Aelita, who in an effort to save herself, exhorts the many Martian slaves to revolt. With chaos rampant, the military swears fealty to the queen, and she betrays the rebels by ordering the army to run them off.

In a deus ex machina twist, the entire Martian scenario was an invention of Los's vivid imagination-- the indecipherable space message is only an ad for a brand of tire. Los returns home to accept his fate but discovers the shots fired at Natasha missed her; the couple have a tearful reunion. The scientist burns his spaceship blueprints and vows to daydream no longer.

Sergei Eisenstein's BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN (released one year after ""Aelita"") is his account of the naval mutiny that had great repercussions throughout old Russia.

(6.5) Aelita: Queen of Mars (USSR-1924) - Yuliya Solntseva/Igor Ilyinsky/Nikolai Tsereteli/Vera Orlova/Valentina Kuindzhi/Pavel Pol/Konstantin Eggert

TECHNICAL NOTES--

The orthochromatic film used reproduces Kuindzhi's (Natasha) eyes as having no iris.

Aelita's head gear looks like a beat up roof TV antenna, and the Martian soldier uniforms, with their squared-off pasteboard helmets, are laughably quaint.

Print transfer is sharp, but occasionally jittery.",1221609600,2,2362,5.274666666666667
1043836,4,6305470286,"While Aelita is considered one of the first science fiction films, the story focuses on the daily lives of several people after the Russian Revolution and is more of a propaganda film of sorts. The story revolves around a young scientist Los (Nikolai Tsereteli) and his wife Natasha (Valentina Kuindzhi) who symbolizes the new Russia. Each works hard in their respective government jobs although Natasha appears to see more of the hunger, homelessness and fear in the aftermath of the war. The characters of Ehrlich (Pavel Pol) and Yelena (N. Tretyakova)are diametrically opposed to the main characters and characterize the old bourgeoisie Russia, clinging to wealth even if they have to steal it from the ""common man"".  The ""good communist"", common man is represented by the Red Army soldier Gussev (Nikolai Batalov)who is recovering from his wounds in a local hospital making the most of things and often portrayed singing with a guitar in hand and a smile on his face.

While Los seems happy in his life reconstructing Russia, he dreams of visiting Mars and has long been assembling plans for a spaceship. Through his daydreams the audience is introduced to life on Mars where the working class is enslaved by a monarchy ruled by the King of Mars, Tuskub(Konstantin Eggert). His Queen, Aelita(Yuliya Solntseva), is unhappy with him keeping secrets from her, the biggest of which is a new telescope that allows the King to view distant life. With the help of the energy guardian, Gor(Yuri Zavadsky), Aeilta gains access to the telescope and begins to fall in love with Los and his way of life.

When Los receives a cryptic message at the station where he works, it forces him to move up his plans for space travel. As with most tales of alien expeditions, Los and his fellow travelers are in for more than they bargained for when they arrive on Mars. Aelita convinces Los and the others to help her in creating a slave uprising (perhaps the most propagandist element of the film in forming the Socialist Republics of Mars). But all is not as it seems and Aelita hides a secret that Los could never imagine.

The sets and cinematography are cutting edge for their time as well as the mere idea of Mars travel. The only negative aspect of the film is that it seems somewhat disjointed at times and the cut scenes are more to what is happening rather than actual dialogue as in later silent films. Also, the musical score on the DVD is not as good as in some other films making it somewhat tedious to watch. Sifting through the communist components of the script may be difficult at times but Aelita is a must see for sci-fi film enthusiasts.",1198022400,2,2641,4.734782608695652
1043837,5,6305470286,"After leaving the hall of cinema, I asked to myself how could this movie to surmount the ideological prejudices and brutal censure, if presumably didn't count with a kind overlook by part of adverse enemies of the regime. Because the whole contain of the underneath message was terribly mordacious.

An engineer decides to design a spaceship to try to find in Mars the woman of his dreams. Until now everything s works; but when he arrives to the red planet he finds a Proletarian upraising. This film not only inspired the genial mind of Fritz Lang but since its release has been an portentous document in the history of cinema.

This smart collection of elements: danger, humor and love were the primordial factors that could stand the inquisitive scrutiny of the Big Russian Brother; the iron fist ruler, and certainly the most bloody tyrant in the XX Century.",1176076800,4,863,4.824324324324325
1043838,3,6305470286,"This is not the early silent sci-fi film to start with (that would be Metropolis) or the first classic of Russian cinema (that would be Battleship Potemkin) though it predates both of them. The science fiction elements are okay but the ordinary plot elements and the Marxist commentary weigh it down and it becomes dull after a while. Then again you must remember special effects were in their infancy and also the Soviet regime basically required that all films produced include Communist rhetoric and that plenty of science fiction films with neither constraints are also obvious, plodding and over-rated (the Star Wars prequels perhaps?).  Anyway, if you have time to kill and you are in a film course and want to impress the other students with an influential film no one will have heard then this might be of interest. Or if you can see parts of it as a camp classic (the scenes on Mars obviously influenced Sins of the Fleshapoids). Otherwise there are better places to start.",1141171200,2,982,4.810650887573964

You'd think that in the 20's they tried to be close to the original, but not in this case - the movie is quiet a bit different from the book. Warning: spoilers ahead! Where in the book most of the action happens on Mars, in the film our hero doesn't get to the red planet until into some time the second hour of the movie. In the book Aielita dies after taking poison, Los' tastes something bitter on her lips, but it's too late. In the movie Los' kills Aelita, and then realizes that the whole shebang was a dream.

It's a good movie non-the less. The actors' play is wonderful, and many parts are funny.

1043840,2,6305470286,"Aelita is a film riddled with stories of uprisings, rebellions, and communism. What is interesting about this film is that it is seen from two worlds. Hailed as the first science fiction film from Russia, it depicts the social economy in Russia during 1924, and compares it to the Martian capitalist society that is watching from the Red Planet in the sky.  A radio signal from an unknown source has been sent all over the world, and while some disregard this as just a innocent jumble of messages, Los, a individualist, yet jealous engineer thinks that it is a message from Mars. He begins work on a space craft that will ultimately take him to the uncharted planet, but also ruin his personal life.  On Mars, The Queen, Aelita, has discovered that some of her scientists have created a telescope that can watch the planet Earth up close. Trying not to get caught, odd because she is Queen, she sneaks a peak through the telescope and sees our favorite murderer and engineer, Los.  She immediately falls in love with him and even appears in one of his dreams.  When he arrives to meet her on Mars, he discovers a world not unlike his own that he was trying to escape.  Riddled with similarities, Los must fight for not only for Mother Russia, but for the surrounding red planet.

For  my first viewing of a silent film, I was unimpressed.  I thought that it was going to show a short, simple story that would show me the techniques that Hollywood uses today.  While I did see some of sci-fi's beginnings with this film, I felt that it stressed too much on the symbolic nature of these characters instead of developing a story.  I will say this, the director is daring to make this film.  It involves several character development, a hard task to tackle in the silent film era because it was hard to keep track of who was who.  One aspect that I thought was interesting that lost itself in the translation to DVD was the music.

This was a harsh film to watch.  A little over two hours, it was too much silent film for me.  I found myself getting angry at the music, and a headache because I couldn't follow which character was which.  I also don't know much about the history of Russia during this time, so I had trouble following why these characters were acting in this style.  What I did find interesting was the turn of events in this film.  I really never saw them coming. I never thought that Aelita would be such a power hog.  The director was again trying to make a statement about life in Russia, but it still made me stop and make sure I was capturing the moment correctly.  Had some good psychological moments tied with some great characters that no doubt came from Russian literature.

Overall, strong moments with a very weak plot made it a tough watch.  I will have to give that it was a powerful film for a silent movie, but just not what I was hoping for or expecting.  Check this movie out if you are a big sci-fi history buff. I think this is right in your corner, but for everyone else...I will continue to search for the best.

1043842,3,6305470286,"Aelita is a spectacular failure. Made to compete with the great productions from Germany and USA, it was the Leviathan of Russian silent movies; hyper-expensive and long in the making.
It became the victim of a critical backlash (too much capitalist wishy-washying) and was quietly withdrawn from circulation soon after its bombastic premiere opening, featuring larger-than-life models of Aelita's characters outside the cinemas and advance hype of the highest order.
Soon even the rumour of it faded into obscurity, yet some remembered. The Soviet State Film archives didn't destroy the negative (apparently, they have preserved everything, however subversive!) Aelita was still mentioned fleetingly during the years (John Grierson tried to aquire a copy) but not until Glasnost was it released to new audiences. And now it's on DVD.
This is a film you will want to see just once. Oh, you can probably return to it and watch individual scenes, but I myself wouldn't ever want to see the entire film again. It's badly directed and the story is complete hokum. The special effects are perfunctory. Just take a peek at that lens or telescope the Martians use to watch life on earth. Whoever conceived that one? When Aelita looks into the telescope, it's from a distance of 50cm from the ocular, which means she can't see anything at all. The space-ship looks like a pot bellied boiler from the Titanic.
I've seen much better effects in other films from the 20ies.
The planet Mars, however, is imaginatively rendered and the costumes and make-up are a sight to behold! Check out those hair-dos!
The scenes from earth are interesting. Not for the melodramatic story, but the social aspect of it. Post-revolutionary Soviet had great housing and food supply problems and this features strongly in Aelita. If only they had got rid of that terrible counter-revolutionary villain and his obnoxious wife, Aelita would have been so much better.
Buy it only if you want to support the release of old silents on DVD, or is an avid collector of all things rare and silent.",1057795200,5,2058,5.002915451895044
1043843,3,6305470286,"An early piece of science fiction cinema, Aelita is an interesting gem of a movie.  It is from the silent era and will probably not gain a lot of followers from those raised on the big budget productions common from Hollywood today.  It was made in Russia in 1924 and is little more than Marxist propaganda, however, as a piece of science fiction and cinema history, it is of interest.
The movie starts with radios around the world receiving a mysterious transmission.  It is decided that the signal is from Mars (for no apparent reason), and a Russian scientist (Loss) decides that he will build a spaceship to travel there.  (Title card: ?[Loss] works all night to construct a spaceship to take him there?!)  Meanwhile, Aelita, the queen of Mars, uses a viewing device to watch the people of Earth.  She sees Loss and falls madly in love with him (so much for long courtship).  At the same time, we are shown the struggles of the Soviet people in the early days of Communism and a group of conspirators who prey upon the simple hardworking Soviet citizens.  One of these conspirators tries to seduce Loss? wife over to the ways of the old (capitalist) society.  Loss becomes enraged when he believes that his wife has cheated on him and kills her.  He must now use his rocketship to escape from the law.  He takes off in his craft with a Soviet soldier, Gussev, as his traveling companion (a police detective in pursuit of Loss also stows away).  When they arrive on Mars, they find that the rulers there (including Aelita) are tyrants that enslave and torture the common people.  Led by Gussev, the people stage a revolt to put down the tyrants and establish a socialist society on Mars.  Loss kills Aelita then awakens to find that it was all a dream and that he had never traveled to Mars and that he had never shot his wife.  He discovers that she did not really cheat on him and the two are reunited.
The movie is essentially a Marxist parable.  It shows people who have lost faith in the ideals of the revolution but eventually are swayed back to the side of socialism.  In this sense, it a less of a cinematic feature and more of a propaganda tool.  It is an interesting piece of movie history though.  It is an early attempt at science fiction and an interesting window into the nascent Soviet Republic.  The special effects are so-so, but hey, this was made in 1924.  The cubist imagery used to depict the Martian society is fascinating.  And the spacecraft used to travel to Mars is actually based on sound scientific principles.  It is a liquid fuel propelled rocket, though it is bloated and unwieldy in appearance.  Tracking in at almost two hours (111 minutes), the movie is daunting at times even for the most dedicated of viewers.  But still I would say it is worth the effort for sci fi and movie historians.

The plot is a jumbled mess, with very little set on Mars. The story is mostly about things happening in Moscow and Kursk in the year 1921 and 1922. Thus is really a portrait of ordinary life in Russia just after the Russian Revolution. The science fiction is minimal, and rather disappointing. I found it a trial to go through as what happened was confusing and not clear. The scenes on Mars are a dream and make little sense, it seems to be a projection of Loss's anxieties, as Aelita changes to the image of his wife twice, so while he is embracing Aelita, he is really thinking of his wife on Earth. The so-called Revolution on Mars happens far too quickly to be believed, and much of the scenes are simply improbable propaganda for spreading the Soviet cause everywhere. As a science fiction film it fails to work at all. Lang's Metropolis is a much better film and should be compared to this one. Aelita is notable as one of the first feature length science fiction films, but the science is buried under too much social realism to be serviceable as science fiction.

The movie is set at the beginning of the NEP (New Economic Policy) in December, 1921. The version I watched has English titles by Kyril Dambueff and Mark Bennett. Really annoying piano music by Alex Rannie.

On December 4, 1921 at 6:27 p.m. Central European Time, radio stations on Earth received a strange signal. It is intriguing to see all the instrumentality of the deciphering office. The speculation on Mars is Sort of the first X-files.

Loss (a scientist that is obsessed with going to Mars) imagines a Mars with Aelita (Yuliya Solntseva,) a vamptress with a fascination with fascinators (a form of head gear.) ""Touch my lips with your lips as those people on Earth did.""

Mean while back on Earth his wife, Natasha (Valentina Kuindzhi) seems to have a thing going with their new male squatter.

We are presented with a feudal society on mars where the workers discover the great communist ideals of earth which they embrace and everything is peachy. The later divulgence of Stalin's atrocities and the failure of communism in every aspect really put this film into historical perspective.

7890992,3,6305470286,"To me, this movie was mostly two plots which barely had anything to do with each other: the hard-working engineer and his loyal socially-conscious wife dealing with counter-revolutionary elements in post-Civil War Moscow on one hand and the imperial intrigues going on way up there on the Red Planet (get it? Red planet? Reds?? Never mind). The engineer is so smart that he is involved in radio engineering, branches out into industrial work and eventually builds a spacecraft capable of reaching Mars but he can't see that his wife is faithful to him and not interested in the profiteering enemy of the people who ends up living with them. Meanwhile, Mars Needs Fashion Sense. And eyebrow-plucking technology. Apparantly ""Aelita"" is Martian for ""Unibrow.""

When, towards the end of the film, the engineer finally does reach Mars he is accompanied by a detective who makes Clouseau look like a highly-trained professional and a Red Army veteran who boasts ""I helped set up four soviet republics!"" Earlier he arrived at a hospital badly wounded... a result of trying to make a reluctant Poland into another soviet republic?

One thing leads to another, until the Earthmen help organize a worker's revolt (complete with banners which probably read ""all power to the Martians"") only to have it fall to counter-revolutionary elements.

While this movie is an interesting look at the NEP-era of the USSR, prior to the rise of Stalin, and you see indirectly ""war communism"" and the party bureaucracy firming up, from an entertainment point of view the film is not that good. I've seen U.S. silent movies from the same period which had better production quality and better written than this one. Metropolis came out only a few years later and it puts this film to shame. The models of the Martian city were somewhat impressive and it is obvious that the producer tried to create some elaborate sets under trying conditions.

7890994,3,6305470286,"During the 1920s the Russian film industry was in some respects more advanced than those in the west, and many Soviet silent films continue to be watched and studied today. At the time, the 1924 AELITA: QUEEN OF MARS was a major undertaking, and while it was a major popular and critical success in 1924, it has not worn as well over the years as such films as THE BATTLESHIP POTEMPKIM.

The original 1923 novel by Alexei Tolstoy concerned an actual flight to Mars and the hero's effort to save the dying planet by establishing a USSR-style goverment. The 1924 film is only vaguely similar, with a USSR engineer, Los, day dreaming about life on Mars, which he supposes is ruled Aelita, a woman prone to excessive make-up and bizarre hair styles. When his marriage experiences difficulties, Los has fantasies of fleeing to Mars, where he attempts to establish a USSR-style government. Given the way it all turns out, it is fortunate indeed that his fantasies are mere day dreams.

The earth-bound portion of the story takes up most of the film, and we are presented with a confusing series of plots and subplots and hard-to-follow characters--but no one ever went to see AELITA for this part of the movie, they went to see it for its scenes of life on Mars. The costumes, make-up, hairstyles, and most particularly the set designs were startling and extremely influential at the time. Even so, the film is obvious USSR propoganda, and seen today the whole thing seems overlong and a bit foolish. Even fans of silent film are likely to find AELITA a bit of a bore, so it is really best left to students of film history.

Aelita (Yuliya Solntseva) is a Frida Kahlo-like queen from Mars with unibrow and spectacular costumes! I am not sure she had 4 breasts, but one of the outfits did actually have 4 cups. Maybe we'll never know if martians actually exist or if they practice monarchy...
According to what I see, martian women dress in elaborate and complicated gear, not friendly to use in daily life (designer Aleksandra Ekster) and the same go to buildings and other landscapes. I can not picture 3 or 4 women together inside an elevator with those headdresses, they could end up injured!

I am sure this futuristic movie influenced other like METROPOLIS, FLASH GORDON, and who knows, maybe even TRON's costumes... I liked the segments that took place on Mars over all, and not so much the ones on earth... with the situation in Russia and all that.",1316822400,,1017,4.7727272727272725
7890996,4,6305470286,"I ran across this title while researching attempts to receive signals from Mars by our military in the mid-1920's.  A VHS tape copy of ""Aelita-Queen of Mars"" was available for a reasonable price, so my curiousity got the best of me and I ordered it from a reliable Amazon vendor in Florida.

The film is not too difficult to follow if one recognizes the political situation in early 1920's Russia.  There is much social turmoil as people recover from the effects of the Revolution and war with the Whites.  A prominent engineer and his wife must take in boarders, one of which is a greasy scoundrel who is an opportunist greedy for money, position, and the engineer's wife.

Meanwhile, the Martians have built a ""viewer"" that can see the activities on earth.  Aelita, the unhappy Queen, sees the handsome engineer on her screen who coincidently has a plan to build a space vehicle to travel to Mars.  At this point, it is easy to see the influence of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars series on the writers for this film.  I was impressed by the outrageous costumes and imaginative sets which were echoed in the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930's.

Regretfully, this film was an obvious propaganda vehicle for the Communists and the characters reflect the stereotypical cast in Orwell's ""1984.""  Even so, I actually enjoyed the whole thing including the surprise ending.  My favorite character was the handmaiden of Aelita who hoofed her way through many of the sequences with overly-dramatic exhuberance.  Enjoy!",1267920000,,1506,4.8858267716535435
7890997,3,6305470286,"Aelita is a science fiction film that features the first space travel by earthlings: Destination Mars. I recommend it highly for film history buffs and aficionados of the science fiction genre.

 It is hard to believe that impoverished and ravaged Russia still in the midst of that horrible Revolution that was to destroy the country econnomically for decades and that certainly tried its best to pulverize most of its traditional culture,  could produce something so advanced as this film, but here it is, a definite proof that in many ways, the avant-garde is to triumph where least expected. It also shows that artistic creation is almost always subversive by creating the new against all odds and trascending political or ideological barriers that may not at all have been the intention of the propaganda ministers.
The film is muddled with a supporting plot that describes how a scientist on earth, Los (Nikolai Tsereteli)  receives a signal from the planet Mars and builds a spaceship to go there and investigate. He is helped along by a series of badly dressed, intrusive characters that make the story hard to follow. It is interesting to see the contrast  from two worlds. The hardships of a rapidly changing Russia during 1924, compared to the Martian monarchy that is surveying the earth from the Red Planet. The radio signal  has been sent all over the world, and while most disregard this as just a  jumbled static noise, Los, an engineer of talent and determination, thinks that it is a definite message from Mars. He frantically begins to  work on a space craft that will ultimately take him to Mars, while ruining his personal life (not much change there in career challenging relationships since then and now).  Mars' Queen, Aelita,  (Yuliya Solntseva) has discovered that some of her scientists have created a telescope that can watch the detailed life on planet Earth.
She sneaks a peak through the telescope device and of course, concentrates on the first appealing sign of earthy interest, engineer Los, who come to think of it, looks a lot like Vladimir Putin. She immediately falls in love with him and finds it hard to concentrate during her Martian day while constantly thinking about that man on earth. When he arrives to meet her on Mars, he discovers a world not unlike the one that they were trying to get rid of in Russia at that time: The priveleges of a monarchy and the class divisions of a feudal system based on slaves and masters, here all perfectly dressed in elaborate costumes that include a special all-inclusive helmet-mask device for the slaves and delicate transparent plastic layers and arm decorations for the upper classfor a very chic-futuristic look  which surely influenced the bold designs of Paco Rabanne in metal and plastics a full forty years later. These outfits are quite extraordinary for being the first in this genre and are the direct ancestors of Sci-Fi fashions.  Los must now fight not only for Communist Russia, but for the liberation of the oppressed in the Red Planet, an altruistic mandate that Aelita plans to manipulate for her benefit while at the same time seducing him.

Aelita is gorgeous, beautifully dressed and wears a striking proto-atomic headdress that is most becoming, though a little cumbersome when she begs him to ""unite our lips, like they do on earth"". She looks striking trailing her gown in the gorgeous Constructivist set, that is surely a Modernist's dream of decor. Alexandra Exter, one of the women artists in the Russian acvant garde is credited with the designs, and I think she may also have had a hand in the costumes, which was the chief reason I wanted to see this film. Los sides with Queen Aelita's  struggle to overthrow the regime of exploitation, finding nothing wrong in the 'revolution' being conducted by a Queen in her regalia, proving once again that love is blind, even in interplanetary relationships.

This was a harsh film to watch, and that is why I gave the three stars rating,  because not unlike other great Russian films, the length and timing are just so much more extended that we are used to in the West. A little over two hours, it was too tempting for me not to fast forward the action, specially during the drab scenes of Russian reconstruction which are interesting only to building engineers, and possibly third rate Republican politicians, and are here only part of propaganda. There is a scene though that I thought was priceless: There is a secret ""pre-revolutionary -styled-conspiratorial"" ball, at which all the guests arrive wearing the drab clothes of the Russian proletariat only to shake it all off and shine in their jewels and tuxedos dancing the foxtrot and the tango like the Tsar was still in St. Petesburg. One wonders how such a scene could have escaped censorship seven full years after the Revolution, for there is NO doubt these people look a heck of a lot better in the 'capitalist' garb, so I for one would have gotten their propaganda message backwards. There is also an episode, almost surreal in the way it interjects into the Russian reality plot, where a worker breaks his chains and fashions the hammer and sickle symbol all by himself, like a demigod. The man's naked torso with the chains is the first we see of this allegorical concoction, he looks like one of the medieval heroes that are in full-life size in bronze outside of St. Basil's cathedral in the Kremlin, but shirtless, showing off the brutal splendor of Slavic manhood, a great and unexpected delight that may well be the first unintentional homoerotic intervention in official Communist propaganda, a detail which should make it a must-see for social historians and all those interested in the study of the manipulation of desire and eroticism under totalitarian regimes.",1249430400,,5790,4.892857142857143
