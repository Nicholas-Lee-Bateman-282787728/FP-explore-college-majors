2513026,5,B000EBGE9Q,"Dr. Katz is getting its long overdue DVD release. If you've seen Home Movies you'll have an idea of what kind of humor to expect. The 1st season is only 6 episodes, so if that's all there is on the DVD it's unfortunate that it wasn't combined with season 2. Oh well. I'm just glad that Dr. Katz is being released on DVD, but we'll have to wait til May. I'm hoping for some nice extras and looking very forward to future seasons of Dr. Katz on DVD.",1139011200,33,447,4.090909090909091

2513040,5,B000EBGE9Q,"I normally don't watch animated film much, but when I stumbled onto this tv show years ago I became immediately hooked because it is totally fascinating to watch, as this psychotherapist Dr. Katz deals with his patients, whose voices are actually those of very popular personalities of the day and who are very funny with their various true-to-life issues, and then there is his secretary who is strangely compelling as a young woman with an attitude problem, to say the least, but a really nice voice.  And their is Dr. Katz's grown son who lives with him in his one-parent home and who apparently is very bright but unmotivated to find work or get out on his own.  And there's more and it is all very interesting and fun.  The animation style is unusual in that is is kind of sketchy and kind of vibrates and this may throw off new viewers, at first, but once you get used it, it becomes comfortable and not a distraction.  Love this show, sorry it didn't go on for more than two seasons.  I am so glad Amazon had it and at the right price, too.",1364601600,,1047,4.404145077720207

I personally did not like the content at first, however, after several views the program is quite comical and even endearing at times, especially when Katz interacts with his son.  The best part about Dr. Katz is the constant barrage of different comedians who act as his clients.  Their unique styles of comedy as well as the animation sequences with which they coincide keep the show fresh and amusing.

Also, the plot of the shows is often about Dr. Katz and his son who is in his 20's and still living at home.  Their relationship is filled with humorous arguments and silly sarcastic conversations.  If you are mainstream and into vulgar humor or lots of action, you will probably think this is boring.

Anyway, Jonathan Katz and his son Ben are cute as usual, eating cereal and not doing much...Laura is nice and disgruntled, and the extras they offer are commendable for only a ten-dollar DVD...

Dr. Katz's couch served as a stage for comedians to showcase their best (cleaned-up) routines.  So many great characters, but for me the best part is Dr. Katz's hilarious interactions with his slacker son.

Dom Irrera, Dave Attel and Larry Miller. Some of this works

and some of it doesn't. Jonathan Katz is always funny along with

his son Ben(Jon Benjimin), and his bored secretary(Laura Silverman). Ray Romano is good. Some of the other comics are

spotty. The commentary by the creators(Tom Snyder, Katz and Benjimin)

is what makes this especially interesting(it would be a three

star without it) Filmed in squigglevision, which gives the

illusion of movement, when actually only the lips and eyes move.

They talk about how some people got ill watching squigglevision. I enjoyed

the show when it first ran, but watching no more than one or two

episodes at a time is enough. I suppose they are waiting to see the response before issuing more on DVD. I hope they do, but

2513065,3,B000EBGE9Q,"This is a beautiful, one of a kind show but the first season isn't too hot. Dr. Katz, stunningly to me, is up there with the most endearing television programs ever created, due mostly to the individual characters of Katz and his son, and the two's relationship. The best bits in the season generally come from spontaneous dialogue amidst the two, usually with an underscore of either 1) Nothing or 2) Ben and his inability to... do anything. The clients and their therapy sessions with Katz aren't too funny this season I'm afraid, and surely my least favorite (who coincidentally became the most reoccurring guest on the show) is the now famous Ray Ramano.

Every show finds their niche with time and my most treasured are often (especially in hindsight) a bit painful to watch. The first season here of Katz is still totally worthwhile because it establishes the main characters and setups, but it lacks on the laughs, especially in comparison to the following seasons of the show, which I hope hope hope are coming out SOON. Indispensable for admiring fans of the show, like my true self, but gut-busting entertainment this is not. As Jonathan Katz says near the end of an episode's commentary (which is ho-hum overall), 'are we sure we're watching this at full speed?'.",1154649600,3,1274,4.8173515981735155

2513080,4,B000EBGE9Q,"I am glad to see this show finally make it to dvd. Definitely the best cartoon to appear on Comedy Central. My only quibble with this dvd is that the shows, are presented in a wider screen format than full frame (perhaps the originally broadcasts were chopped off at the sides?), however the dvd presents them letterboxed, which means if you have a 16x9 screen, close to half the screen is taken up by the letterboxing & the image is much smaller than it needs to be.",1151712000,2,467,4.379310344827586

2513082,5,B000EBGE9Q,"Dave Attell called ""Dr. Katz"" a ""comedic garbage dump of material."" He's right, but only in the sense that this show dwells on the humorous and dark personality quirks of celebrities including (in the six episodes of season one) Ray Romano, Dave Attell, Dom Irrera, and Larry Miller. The psychoses of the ""cast"" are fleshed out in hilarious, yet dry, detail. Romano and Miller are my favorite patients from this season, but all the patients are strange, demented, and delightful. One of my favorite features of the show is the inset or flashbacks of the issue being discussed on the couch, the visual images of which are generally hilariously disturbing.

I am also fond of the fact that Katz and his son, Ben (a 23 year old slacker) have as many (if not more) issues than the patients. One of my favorite recurring plotlines is Ben's attempt to get Katz's receptionist to date him, which only works when there is great opportunity for embarrassment for her boss at an ""open mic"" night. (I also particularly enjoy her creative hostility when she helps Ben park and subsequently get towed from a no parking zone.)

This show (which really was made in Tom Snyder's pantry) is very dry and full of a bizarre mix of subtlety and snideness and is a true wonder of low budget animation. It not only introduced the world to the delights of Squigglevision (which propagated to the first season of ""Home Movies"") but made cartoons acceptable for adults again after years of focus on kids.

This is a great, funny, intelligent, and surreal animation experience and I recommend it highly.",1150934400,9,1577,4.769230769230769
2513083,4,B000EBGE9Q,"And release additional seasons, please.  I have been waiting FOREVER to get Dr. Katz on DVD.  I love this show - I recorded some videos on tape, but have NO idea where that VHS is.  I have been missing Benny!

I ran across it yesterday in a retail store, bought it without question and am watching it now.  I LOVE Dr. Katz! Squigglevision rocks.  The only thing I don't like is that there are only 6 shows in this episode.

We watched each episode carefully, knowing we only had six fantastic shows to view.  Dom Irrera, Ray Romano (before his huge TV show) Laura Kightlinger, Dave Attell, if you're a fan of stand-up, you must add Dr. Katz to your collection immediately.

I can't recommend Dr. Katz Season 1 more highly.",1150156800,3,576,4.5

2513088,5,B000EBGE9Q,"Dr. Katz is a comedic cartoon with stand-up comedian Jonathan Katz in the starring role of a psychiatrist who has more than his share of professional comedians as patients. This enables them to do their stand-up comedy routines as part of their therapy sessions. Dr Katz' 23 year old son, Ben, still lives with the good doctor and is chronically unemployed. Ben is constantly trying to start up a romance with Dr. Katz' receptionist, Laura, with no luck whatsoever. For example, when Ben meets Laura for the first time he asks her if she'd like to go out for coffee, and she does - leaving him to answer the phones. Laura receives a paycheck from Dr. Katz but in many ways is as chronically unemployed as Ben is. She has no interest in pretending to be busy, being nice to the patients, or at times, even showing up for work. For example, when Dr. Katz suggests that Laura to be nicer to the patients she replies ""Do you have any idea what it's like to deal with crazy people all day?"" In the series premiere, ""Pot-Bellied Pigs"", Dr. Katz rides Ben pretty hard about being out of work. Ben's solution to his cash flow problem is to buy two Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs and breed them in their small New York City apartment. When Dr. Katz asks Ben if he thinks this is a good plan Ben's response is ""Dad, the ad says 'Stay Home, Make Money' ....these are good things!"" The third episode ""Bully"" is also one of my favorites in which Ben gets very upset when Dr. Katz throws away Bully, the stuffed bull from his childhood. Ben labels everything that belongs to him, and expresses fear that perhaps his father wants him out, too.
Dr Katz employs a novel animation technique called Squigglevision, which can be visually annoying to some people. In SquiggleVision there is virtually no lateral movement by any of the characters or objects, with only lips, eyes, and the like animated. However, the edges of the characters are in a constant state of zigzagging flux, and this gives the impression of movement. There are only six episodes in this first season, but the DVD set is reasonably priced considering the season's short duration. I highly recommend this unique comedy as one of the smartest and funniest offerings that Comedy Central came up with before they started trying to appeal to the least common denominator with stuff like ""The Man Show"".",1148169600,23,2348,4.660240963855422
2513089,5,B000EBGE9Q,"Point of fact re: other reviews, this show does not take place anywhere specifically, but if you know anything about Dr. Katz and H. Jon, this show most closely takes place in Boston.  Among the several subtle references to this, the most glaring is the name of the bar ""33"", a clear reference to Larry Bird, as well as Dr. Katz himself being from Newton, MA, H. Jon's history in Cambridge, etc.

This show is THE seminal TV show and served as the launching pads for all of the best modern-era TV shows out there.  Everything from Raymond to Chapelle to Insomniac - point a finger at a successful show and there exists a great likelihood that it has its roots on this show.  Obviously there is the connection to each comedian's stand-up material, but this showcase - the straightman Doc with his neurotic patients (even David Duchovny came across as incredibly funny on this show) delivering their material - the way it was presented, and the underlying subtleties of his relationship with Ben, Laura, et al, those kind of sophisticated machinations no longer exist on TV.

It is wit and humor of a bygone era and I for one was fortunate enough to have taped every episode when it ran in marathon form on Comedy Central at the tail end of my college years, thus I have had the pleasure of having the entire episodic catalog in my constant possession for nearly 10 years.  The fact that it is coming out officially on DVD is a huge triumph and one I am so excited to partake of as a consumer.  Truly timeless - a collection of all the greatest humor of the late 20th century all in the same recognizable format and the catchy jazz loops to complement the squiggles.  Simply put - the greatest TV show ever made.

And for anyone who has yet to see Jon Katz live - it is worth every moment and every penny.  He came to Jimmy Tingle's near Boston last year or so and it was as if I could have died and gone to Heaven.  None before and none after.",1147737600,13,1942,4.381615598885793
2513090,4,B000EBGE9Q,"Well finally, a decade after its debut, the cult classic comedian-curative careerist cartoon Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist is on DVD. Like the American version of The Office, the first season of Dr. Katz had merely six episodes. That this necessitates a low-cost single disc compilation could be fortunate or unfortunate depending on your wallet-to-patience ratio.

The disc comes in a clear plastic DVD case to allow the episode information to be seen on the back of the cover insert when you open the case. This is handy since there's no need for chapter listings, however the clear plastic makes the case much flimsier than more common packaging.

The main menu is of course done in the signature Dr. Katz style. An image of Katz is animated in Squiggle-Vision to lip-synch with several psychiatric phrases from the show as the theme song plays. After it repeats once, the music stops and Katz just sort of stares at you and occasionally glances at the menu selection.

As any Dr. Katz fan should know, the PC-based animation won't win any awards. Though the picture is clearer than it's ever been, the minimalist style of the pixelated MS-DOS scenes and monophonic audio mean you won't need to hold out for an HD version. The show is presented in full screen as originally aired, although it is framed in fake widescreen that is not anamorphic. Considering the quality, it's probably better when viewed small anyway.

On the selection menu, there are six commentaries spread across five episodes. Four of them are by Jonathan Katz, H. Jon ""Ben Katz"" Benjamin, and series creator Tom Snyder (not the talk show host), and are as informative as you'd want and hilarious as you'd expect from the cast of an improvised comedy show. The third episode has a second commentary with Ray Romano and Jon Katz (who sounds to be joining via phone). Episode #105 also has a Romano/Katz commentary.

The back of the DVD mentions commentary by Dave Attell, and although this may be misleading, it's not entirely false. While the Attell episode lacks a full commentary track, a five minute section of the phone discussion with Dave and Katz is relegated to the bonus features section. I'm guessing the commentary was either too short, too blue, or Dave was just too bored for them to bother including it in full. Since Katz, on another track, mentions Attell pretending to get ""calls from Hollywood"" during his session, I'd bet on the latter excuse.

In addition to the commentaries are a small selection of other extras. ""The Biography of Mr. Katz"" (not ""Dr."" as the case states) is not some hastily thrown together text bio, but rather an eight minute short predating Dr. Katz that shows an early Squigglevision version of Jonathan dictating his life story to an unseen biographer. It's hardly uproarious, but still amusing to see how the style developed. ""Shrink Wrapped"" is a roughly 40 second short supposedly about a shrink that features more cartoonish voices than fans are used to, but it's rather inexplicable and aimless. Two of the original Short Attention Span Theater shorts featuring Dr. Katz are included and are as funny as the regular show. However I certainly remember there being more of them. Perhaps they're being saved for future sets.

Scant as it is, there's enough here to tide fans over until the next season is released, and for $15 or less it's hardly a nail-biting decision. Insert clever therapy pun here.",1147392000,14,3425,4.884681583476764

Even comics that I despise have made me laugh on this show. Somehow it just seems so much more funnier. It's the structure of the show. So unique and fresh and funny. Not to mention the regular cast. Dr Katz is such a subtle yet ingenious host to this array of regulars and guests. H Jon Benjamin is amazing. And Laura makes me want to have sex with a cartoon (i find funny girls attractive). If you're a fan of the show then you have to pick this up. They've done a really good job with the DVD (even the commentaries are really funny). If you've only slightly heard about it, please check it out. It's an amazing, simple, creative and hilarious series.

8108087,3,B000EBGE9Q,"I love this show, but this particular DVD sucks because when you first put it in, they make you watch like 10 minutes of ads for other shows that are available on DVD.  You can't go directly to the disc's main menu.  We like to turn our DVD player off when it's not being used because it makes a buzzing noise all the time.  So every time I would turn it back on to watch a few more episodes of Dr. Katz, I'd have to wait through all the ads again.  That really, really sucked.",1500336000,,477,3.9894736842105263
8108088,5,B000EBGE9Q,"Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist--I believe there were six seasons in total, but for whatever reasons, only the first 2 have been released in full on DVD. A pity, because this was a great, funny series produced by Comedy Central back in the 90s. I think the main hook--or at least, the biggest draw for me--was that Dr. Katz's patients were mostly stand-up comedians, and having the power of animation, added to the mostly great material when the patients would come in for their sessions.

I think the biggest laughs might come from the first episode when Dom Irrera was on the couch. Something about him talking about dressing Dr. Katz in a red gown and riding him like a bull had me dying. The interplay between Dr. Katz and Ben, and seeing how the Dr. relates with his rude secretary and his friends at the bar is also great.

Season 1 also has many appearances by Ray Romano, another funny guy. Again, hopefully one day, someone will eventually release all 6 seasons of this classic cartoon....",1496966400,,999,4.670454545454546
