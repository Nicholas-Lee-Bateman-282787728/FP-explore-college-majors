8602864,1,B00E96AYFW,"This was a real disappointment. Most of the film is dry tedious shots of ""experts"" talking about Death Valley versus footage of the actual place.",1434672000,,145,4.84
8602865,1,B00E96AYFW,"I had hoped for a serious, albeit brief, expose' about geology in Death Valley.

8602866,5,B00E96AYFW,"If you're looking for pretty, scenic videos, these aren't for you. If you want in-depth information about our National Parks, you'll love this entire series. They tell you not only about the park, but about the ecology and history of the entire area.",1395532800,2,250,4.837209302325581
