8434578,1,B00173263I,"This DVD serves no purpose at all. It is painful to hear Frank Lucas talk let alone do an interview. Whoever was doing the interview was  fumbling with his words at times and seemed unprepared as if he was thinking of questions as he went along (ad-libbing). VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!! If your are street savvy you know all of this information anyway. BE CAREFUL with these ""COME UP"" DVDs. They are extremely short, under produced and just plain SUCK!!!!",1312588800,,449,4.756410256410256
