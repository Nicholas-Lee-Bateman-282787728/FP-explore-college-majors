7153951,3,B00WU5B5FC,"The last of the movies based on the outstanding series of books by V.C andrews. The acting is top notch , it sexy and its entertaining. But the story its not on par with the book , which I understand books and movies are like apples & oranges. But it felt very rush and the ending was waterdown version of the book. But it still has lot good merits and his must see for any V.c Andrews fan .overall 3 out 5.",1436486400,5,407,3.975609756097561
7153952,4,B00WU5B5FC,I thought this was the best of the four Lifetime films based on VC Andrews books. Pacing was good and the production values seemed better in this film then the other three. James Maslow who plays Bart is very handsome and reminded me of Adam Levine every time I looked at him. Good acting especially from Maslow and the actress who plays his Mother. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this film,1434672000,7,394,4.410958904109589
7153953,5,B00WU5B5FC,"This movie is the best of all of these movie versions of the Dollanganger series, which is ironic since I thought the book is my least favorite in the series.  But I think this one stands out because unlike Flowers in the Attic and Petals On The Wind they didn't try to compress so many events in one film and James Maslow was just outstanding! I've never paid much attention to him before and never even heard of him before Dancing With the Stars but now I see what a great actor he is he was great as the sociopathic Bart Winslow Jr! He pretty much made this movie for me. It's definitely worth watching even if you like me didn't really enjoy the rest of the movies.",1434585600,8,669,4.2265625

7153955,5,B00WU5B5FC,"Out of the four Flowers in the Attic movies, Seeds of Yesterday I think was the most entertaining.  Like the other movies though, for those like me who never read the novel, it was still pretty predictable with scenes you could see coming as well as the overall storyline.  The fact Bart now is some sort of Tycoon that rebuilt the mansion that his parents were tormented in as kids, did seem like the sort of thing his now fully embracing evil and liking to inflict psychological damage on his family members at every opportunity, man that he has grown into would do. But  I don't see how he would have.  One he hadn't inherited his grandmother's money yet (sure it was the 90's there may have builders and others who would have built it on a promise they'd get paid when he turned 25, but I doubt it).  His parent's controlled the money up to then, when he came to them and said, hey I want to rebulid that place you were kept in the attic as kids in, can you write some cheques?  Why would they say yes to that?  But evidently they did.

Other than a few aspects like that though, Seeds of Yesterday is still a really fun movie, with a psychopathic character that is so well done, a complete hypocrite with his own behaviour, that  you've just got to applaud a great movie villain.  Bart is well acted to by James Maslow, you hate the character and that's what you're supposed to do.  The movie works because he along with the writers, does it so well.  The acting from some of the other actors wasn't the best, but he carries the film along with the now 15  year old version of his adopted sister Cindy, played by Sammi Hanratty.  Her character would have been hard to portray where you viewer don't automatically think of her as the same way Bart portrays her to the world, yet still having that sex appeal and letting you realise why Bart has reached these conclusions with his warped family upbringing.

For a made for TV movie, this is easily five stars.  You're entertained, you've got a great villain that you just want someone to give him his comeuppance the whole movie, it's good.",1470614400,,2093,4.411458333333333
7153956,5,B00WU5B5FC,I love James Maslow his so amazing and I Love the movie,1465430400,,55,3.6666666666666665
7153957,3,B00WU5B5FC,"The first movie in this series was pretty good - yes there were deviations from the book but nothing that took away from the enjoyment of the movie.  In the last three movies from this series the same cannot be said.  They are okay to watch but how the characters are portrayed strongly differs from the book.  For instance, Cathy is portrayed too delicately - she comes across as emotionally weak-willed.",1459987200,,405,4.676056338028169
7153958,5,B00WU5B5FC,Thanks for delivering it early. You don't understand how happy y'all have made me.,1457308800,,82,4.928571428571429
7153959,4,B00WU5B5FC,I had seen this movie when it premiered on Lifetime. I was so happy when it was released onto dvd. The only downside is that there aren't any special features,1455062400,,158,4.3
7153960,5,B00WU5B5FC,Love V.C Andrews books and movies,1453766400,,33,4.666666666666667
7153961,4,B00WU5B5FC,"having read the book, parts feel rushed and there are some added plot points that you could take or leave.  plus a certain character that was in the book is completely omitted.  but of the series, this is my second favorite.  i love jason lewis as christopher, he's perfect!",1453593600,,274,4.551020408163265
7153962,4,B00WU5B5FC,"Lifetime TV used to be the ""He done me wrong,"" channel, focused on women (I've seen The Betty Broderick Story MANY times as it ran almost monthly at one point  a Lifetime TV staple film, for sure). They've moved away from a lot of that recently but they still retain some of the essence of it. They've made some interesting films (The Anna Nicole Story, The Capture of the Green River Killer, Fatal Honeymoon  WITH HARVEY KEITEL!, for example, and many others) in the past years and this one is the last in a series of four films about the Dollenganger family. I have so many conflicting emotions about this film, like it's so bad, it's brilliant.

This one picks up where Cathy's children are grown and living their own lives. Bart, however, has become somewhat of a religious fanatic. Their adopted daughter is a bit of a (for lack of a better word) slut. This is the darkest of the four films, in some ways, as it really gets into the head of Bart, who is mentally ""off,"" to put it mildly. In his eyes, everyone has done him wrong. And in some ways, it's true.

Bart's religious fanaticism in the spirit of his great grandfather (Corrine's father) has permeated his soul. He's angry, manipulative and well, just evil, and like his grandmother Corrine before him, he will do what he has to do to get rid of anyone he feels is in the way of his money and way of life. But even after a few attempted murders and the crippling of Jory, Cathy still can't seem to turn her back on Bart.

Seeds of Yesterday brings up all of the family history repeating itself in the worst of ways. But, unlike the other films, there is some strange form of redemption at the end for all of them, even for Bart, although we end with the one surviving Dollenganger sibling from the attic, remaining at Foxworth Hall while the next generation moves on.

What a CREEPY film!

I must add that except for If There Be Thorns, these films are so bad that they really do border on genius. And yes, I purchased all four for that reason.

Watch at your own risk!

Recommend. Sort of...",1452643200,4,2055,4.401055408970977

7153966,1,B00WU5B5FC,"Positive:
It can't get any worse. Can it?
Negatives:
1. The character and story development was about as unbelievable as can be. The characters actions were just made-up fantasy from some not-so-imaginative writer's stealing of TV soap dramas. Definitely written for daytime TV soap addicts that have no life outside of the tele and shopping.
2. Camera and directing were boring standbys from the opening scene of a helicopter view of a car on a wooded roadway; as overused and stolen an opening scene as there is in film. Continuing this trend was camera/directing work filled with lots of talking head shots - a cheap way to make a film.
3. Acting was stilted, robotic, artificial and forced. Actors were so not into their roles that seven words was often the extent of their lines before a cut for the next scene. The drama was also between characters although meant to be tension filled was so misplaced that laughing was the only intelligent response.",1447891200,,956,4.835365853658536

there was another book after this one and I wish they would make it into a movie - about the grandmother's horrible life with malcom sr and that how it started the whole beginning of flowers in the attic
I also wish they would make a movie about the prequel book and how Kristin finds christophers diary among the ruins of the mansion as well as other things in the book-just sayin",1437436800,,460,4.2988505747126435
7153983,5,B00WU5B5FC,Loved it but was a little surprised because i wasn't a huge fan of this book and I think they should make Garden of Shadows into a movie too so ppl who never read the books will understand it better and that theres more f**ked up twist that no one saw coming..
