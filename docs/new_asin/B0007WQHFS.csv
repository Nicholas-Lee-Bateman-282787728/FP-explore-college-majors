2247182,5,B0007WQHFS,"I love Three's Company and I can't wait until the fifth season DVD is ready for release. This is the last season in which Susanne Somers appeared as bubble headed Chrissie Snow before she was fired. Both her husband and her agent gave her some really bad advice that came back to bite her on the ass and it was a shame because Chrissie was a great character and Susanne was absolutley hilarious. When Chrissie was written out of the show they brought in the character Cindy Snow who was Chrissie's cousin, she was played by Jennilee Harrison and a lot of fans of this show didn't like Cindy but I liked her. No Cindy wasn't as good of a character as Chrissie but she was still quite funny and charming and I liked her better than Terri who was basically a carbon copy of Chrissie with maybe not being quite as bubble headed but the facial expressions that Terri made when someone or something shocked her or she got mad at Jack or Janet were the same expressions that Chrissie made whenever she was shocked or mad! You know with the eyes getting all big and the mouth dropping open and the hunched shoulders etc.",1123027200,4,1112,4.402912621359223

2247184,2,B0007WQHFS,"I'm sorry, but no matter how you look at it, the dynamics of this show were with the original six, including the Chrissy character, which made Jack and Janet funnier, since Janet was always watching over Jack, since Chrissy was always unknowingly sexy. The replacement characters didn't have that quality, and the show was never AS funny again. Please note this comment is not about the actresses. The character of Cindy was clumsy but not desired by Jack, and the Terri character was smart and more of a comic sidekick for Janet. You can't re-create magic. The Chrissy character truly had it.  I wish I could give this season more stars, but like many fans, I really invested in the Chrissy character, and her completely unbelievable disappearance to take care of a sick relative without ever hearing from her ever again was a slap in the face to the fans of this show.  Although this season rates the lowest for me, it picks up more stars in the next season, so I have to give this season a two.

Now, in the case of Suzanne Somers, the sitcom star, many people are in deep denial here: it takes a very smart actress to play a dumb blonde. Ms. Somers is and has been underrated. On top of that, she opened the door for future TV talent to get a fair share of the pie. The female leads (DeWitt and Somers) both received a lot less in salary than Ritter, a fact that would be overturned in 1981 if they were men. The contract called for any increase in one actress' salary to match the other's, and for that increase to also increase Mr. Ritter's contract, keeping his salary significantly above the actresses' salaries.  Now I'm not here to speculate what each one deserved, but the fact is that they ALL deserved a raise in the fifth year.  The producers, who were taking in big money for a number one show by this time, were unwilling to negotiate with Suzanne's request for an increase in the contract renewal. It is important to recognize an artist's contribution to the success of a show.  Today's TV stars get much more respect and better treatment, and they have Suzanne Somers to thank for that.

And why does all of this matter in reviewing Season Five of Three's Company? Because a radical shift in direction like this changes the tone of a show. Each cast member, including the imaginative John Ritter (whose contribution to television history is indisputable) and the committed Joyce DeWitt (bless the trouper) are important comical pieces of a puzzle. As a result of this shift, the writing changed, the suspension of belief changed, the quality changed. No one really acknowledged Chrissy's absence in any profound way (were they really a family of friends after all?), nor did Cindy even mention her cousin.  Come on, people!  Have a little more respect for your loyal audience, who follows the show.  It became watered-down, and a bit more goofy, a bit more corny and silly.

Maybe that's okay - as the change from the Ropers to Mr. Furley didn't seem to harm that tone. But take a closer look at seasons one and two. There is some truly groundbreaking work there in the writing and the message sent to America about people living together back in March, 1977. It was funny and sexy, and yet there was some serious social commentary underneath the humor (almost in the way All In The Family had). In terms of the story of these characters, Three's Company became a completely different show. While the original show was more daring (and leaving Jack and Janet alone, unmarried and living together would have been a move forward to keep it daring), fans will clamor for the full series on DVD to enjoy the works of the late John Ritter and Joyce DeWitt, with the latter seasons to enjoy Don Knotts.  For the talent alone, it is worth the watch.

To her credit, my favorite Joyce DeWitt moment is in a non-Chrissy episode later in season six. I know what I've stated - but she holds her own in ""Some Of That Jazz"", where she believes she has what it takes to make it as a dancer, and her mentor/instructor has less than honorable intentions. Toward the end, Jack has a tender moment with Janet and share a slow dance with her. That moment for Ms. DeWitt is REAL, she's really crying, and I tear every time I watch it to this day. That's the show I wish it turned into.

To sum it up, here's my final two cents: if there was ever gonna be a sequel to Three's Company, it should have been called JACK AND JANET!!!",1120521600,7,4426,4.530075187969925
2247185,5,B0007WQHFS,"The 1980-81 season,the fifth for Three's Company began late due to an actors' strike. The strike began in the summer and ended in the early fall. TC's spinoff The Ropers got the Nielsen axe but would appear for the very last time at one point during this season. Here we see Jack(the late John Ritter) entertaining four different women in three different apartments(his,his buddy Larry Dallas's(Richard Kline) and landlord Ralph Furley's(Don Knotts). Jack being harrassed on the job at a diner by his female boss(Jack thought that but actually he was fired due to unsatisfactory performance and misconduct). Chrissy's(Suzanne Somers) high school friend staying at the trio's apartment because her(the friend's) hotel lost her reservation. Jack,Janet(Joyce DeWitt),Larry and Ralph spending the weekend at a ski lodge. Jack working as a mechanical man in a department store window(in that episode Jack falls in love with a woman whom he delivers flowers to as a favor to Janet. The woman is Larry's girlfriend also with three other boyfriends!) Jack working as a busboy in a fancy French restaurant. Jack and Janet welcoming Chrissy's clumsy but beautiful cousin Cindy Snow(Jenilee Harrison) to the apartment(here is where Harrison begins her tenure with TC. She would appear first during the end credits while Somers continued appearing in name and face during the opening montage). Cindy would fill in for Chrissy at her place of employment as a typist/secretary. So in the next episode,her(Cindy's) boss temporarily fires her,thinking she's tired of running errands for him. Jack takes a chef's job at Angelino's restaurant,under the name David Miller(Jack would be fired and rehired several times from this point on. Also Jack's tenures at Angelino's led to his opening of Jack's Bistro in late 1982). An elderly widow practically adopts Jack(she washed the trio's dishes,cleaned their oven and mended two pairs of Jack's pants). Janet on a date with Jack's girlfriend's widowed father. Janet's parents visiting the trio and Jack and Janet pretending to be a married couple to please the parents. Cindy trying to escape the clutches of a wife-hungry millionaire(Jeffrey Tambor,late of The Ropers). The millionaire was married five times before,and as a matter of fact,the third marriage didn't last one day! After Ralph loses his apartment to his termination as landlord,he stays with the trio but ends up winning back his apartment and job(Ralph's brother Bart Furley appears for the first and only time during the series). Jack and Larry ""trade places"",but the arrangement fails. Not even one day,and Jack missed Janet and Cindy sorely. Jack teaching culinary arts at the L.A. technical college,where he graduated with a degree in that subject in the final episode last season(this is a reunion between Jack and Dean Travers(William Pierson) who ran the college. One of Jack's students is Travers' beautiful niece Betty Jean. And another is Janet!). Thinking Cindy is pregnant,Jack proposes marriage. Who's actually pregnant is Kelly,one of the Regal Beagle's waitresses. The father is Doug Cooper(John McCook,late of the CBS daytime serial The Young & The Restless and who would later become one of The Bold & The Beautiful cast),a fashion phtographer Cindy was dating. The late Norman Fell and the late Audra Lindley reprise their respective roles of the trio's former landlords Stanley and Helen Roper for the very last time when they visit the trio while celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary. It turns out after a heated argument,Helen strayed from Stanley. Helen and Stanley stay at Ralph's apartment,exactly where they lived before. Ralph was supposed to be away for the weekend and ended up coming back home after a disappointing experience. Jack pretending he has a twin brother named Austin from Texas(Austin dresses exactly like Jack. Jack performs the pretense for Ralph's beautiful visiting niece Veronica. When Ralph leaves his apartment,Jack goes back to his real self in front of Veronica). A jealous man plans to kill Jack for involving himself with his(the jealous man's) girlfriend. Jack fakes his death so Max,the jealous man wouldn't have to kill him. In real life,Ritter died in September 2003 following a heart disorder. Also,Jack and Janet think Cindy has been kidnapped but Cindy was with her father. While Jack and Janet were at the movies,Cindy's father showed up at the trio's apartment,and the pair took off immediately. Jack and Janet found Cindy and her father at a motel. Also,Jack learns that honesty is not always the best policy. Jack's honesty led to a break-up with his girlfriend,Larry breaking up with his girlfriend and a heated argument between Janet and Cindy. In several episodes,Chrissy was seen on a telephone in Fresno where she was taking care of her ailing mother,talking to either Jack or Janet. Just before this season began,Somers requested a raise in her weekly salary. After the request was denied,she threatened to sue and spitefully didn't show up for work. Also,Ritter and DeWitt were upset with Somers and at the end of this season,she was officially fired. At the beginning of the 1981-82 season,Harrison stayed on,thus appearing in the opening montage. But she'd move out of the apartment to attend UCLA(University of California at Los Angeles).",1115251200,8,5313,5.244418331374853
2247186,5,B0007WQHFS,"In Season 5, Suzanne Somers(Chrissy Snow) appears in only two full episodes: ""Upstairs, Downstairs, Downstairs,"" and her last full episode ""A Hundred Dollars A What?."" After letting success go to her head, she demanded an outrageous pay raise. After her salary demands were refused, she was absent from a few episodes(one of which had to be scrapped). As a result of her absences, Chrissy Snow is sent home to take care of her sick mother, and is cut down to a 60 second telephone scene in a few episodes.(Her telephone scenes were filmed earlier in the day and behind the show's set since the other actors no longer wanted to work with her). Meanwhile, Jenilee Harrison moves in as the third roommate, Cindy Snow, the cousin of Chrissy Snow. Cindy brings a lot of comedy to the series as Chrissy's very clumsy, but well-meaning cousin. I actually do prefer Cindy over Chrissy, just as I prefer Jenilee over Suzanne. With or without Chrissy, John Ritter's comedy is what made the show a hit, for he was(and is) the show's undisputed star. Suzanne is fired at the end of this season, and Chrissy Snow is never again mentioned, and no reason is ever given on the show as to why Chrissy does not return. She brought everything on herself. Thank You, Suzanne, for allowing new characters to come on the show, and for allowing the show's star, JOHN RITTER, to shine brighter. You are not a nice person, Miss Somers.

She and the other women DID deserve more money and if Joyce Dewitt had stood behind her, maybe a comprimze could have been met and things might have been different for everyone.  Forcing Suzanne to film her final shows the way they did was just punishment for what she had asked for.  There could have at least been an explanation as to why Chrissy never came back.  I actually liked Cindy snow WAY better than the charater of Terri.  Also they way the booted Jenilee off in season six with absolutely no explanation either was also rotten.  I wish that in the end, during the last season, everyone could have made up, Suzanne could have come back at least for a full final reunion episode or something like that.  At least in this season you do get to see Suzannes final apperances.  In syndication, they cut out the scenes she did at the end of the show ""on the phone"".  I'm sure Suzanne wasn't all innocent in what went on and she may have pissed a lot of people off, but I think she truely did regret it and I think SOME kind of comprize could have been made.

2247323,4,B0007WQHFS,"...this would be the one to miss. However, this show's low points are still way better than most other shows' high points. But Season Five finds Three's Company in awkward company as Chrissy is reduced to the now legendary ""we'll teach you a lesson"" snippets of her calling on the phone from some relative's house usually at the end of the episode, and very obviously filmed while no one else was on the set. About five episodes in, Chrissy's cousin Cindy comes to take her place in the apartment and unfortunately her one-trick-pony klutz routine gets old even before that first episode is finished. Janet is given more sexy things to do, I guess to make up for Chrissy's absence. And you'll also notice a LOT more Larry (bad) and a LOT more Mr Furley (good). A notable thing about ""Three's Company"" was its resilience to make itself work and stay funny, regardless of the major cast changing that was done during its course. Whether it was the Ropers or Mr Furley, Chrissy or Terri, it always kept the laughs coming, and coming hard and fast.

I've been watching Three's Company ever since I was a kid and to this day it is still one of my favorite shows, if not THE favorite. I still always have to catch the reruns on TVLand. I, like so many others, always preferred the Chrissy or Terri episodes over the Cindy ones, that is until I recently re-watched this one episode on TVLand where Cindy moves in and it made me laugh out loud. So to Amazon I came to buy this DVD set for this specific reason. For that one episode where Cindy moves in -- It has got to be one of John Ritter's funniest episodes because Cindy ends up putting Jack through so much, and there is Jack tripping over things and being knocked everywhere by Cindy's clutziness... Showing John Ritter for what he was awesome at - physical comedy.
Not to mention Joyce Dewitt (Janet) is funny in these episodes too.

So why do so many people knock it? It's hilarious! But then again when is Three's Company not funny. Still makes you laugh after all these years!!

2247353,4,B0007WQHFS,"By now, we're all up to speed on the behind-the-scenes machinations of this classic television sitcom from an era where there were only three television networks to choose from (besides UHF).

 For its time, especially the '70s seasons, 'Three's Company' was pretty risque for prime-time television with its ribald/charmingly naughty look at three adult 'kids'(gasp)living together in Southern California and the male roommate (Mr. Ritter) supposedly gay. Groundbreaking stuf and with the writing, production and acting talent to pull it off.

 Season 5 is the season where all of America knew something was going on behind the scenes but the public relations machine of a bygone era kept most of it at bay, unless you were watching daytime talk shows and saw either Suzanne Somers, clearly unhappy and marginal, on talk shows or the genuine enthusiasm of Jenilee Harrison on the same circuit rallying viewers that all was okay.

  As for Jenilee Harrison, of the revolving roommates in the wake of Mrs. Somers, she is similar to the many James Bonds in the 007 franchise. For my generation, it depends on when you were able to watch 'Three's Company' every week (without being sent to bed) that you latch onto whichever actress was prominent at the time. For me, it was Jenilee...she brought a slapstick, gorgeous innocence to the roommate-dynamic that not only reassured a lot of viewers but also was metaphorical for the offstage turmoil happening around them. As a worker in the entertainment industry now in my late 30s, I can only imagine that Jenilee's addition to the cast soothed the proprietary egos and tension that affected the entire production staff.

  Season Five is the same comfort food TV that any regular viewer of the show remembers. As other reviewers have mentioned, Joyce DeWitt has more room to play and becomes the clear-cut alpha female of the show. She is a deft comedian with perfect timing, a more sophisticated style and perhaps it's just natural time passing by and our knowledge, in hindsight, of the pressures of the show that makes some of her acting 'business' seem more slapstick and shrill, as if the directors want to fill up every second. John Ritter, the male star, is even more elastic and affable and his talent is missed. Don Knotts and Richard Kline have more airtime too with mixed results, depending on your fondness for them in the first place. Suzanne Somers' now infamous 'tags' at the end of the show get increasingly more far-fetched, taking the 'dumb blonde' schtick to a nadir I'm sure even she didn't appreciate, wardrobe and disco ponytails notwithstanding. By the time she stops appearing, it seems almost merciful to both role and actress.

  All in all, a fun season to replay and witness the professionalism required of a juggernaut show giving its A-game to stay a hit and not unravel at a critical time. Again, I'm team Jenilee on this one. I liked Suzanne Somers and, later, Priscilla Barnes' refreshingly lucid take within the show's formula, but considering that Jenilee was only 20 years old and had to mesh with actors long ensconced in their roles, she deserves credit for smoothing the fences and endearing herself to millions of fans at a time when every viewer counted.

While much smarter than Chrissy, Cindy proves to be a klutz, frequently tripping, knocking things over and running into people...usually Jack, who was the main source of physical comedy to this point.

Although Somers still appears in the opening credits, she only appears in small segments at the end of episodes, where she is supposedly at her parents' home, calling her old friends. This was, supposedly, because Somers had walked off the set upset over her salary, and was no longer on speaking terms with the cast. (In fact, Somers came to the studio to record her end of the telephone conversations early in the day, before either John Ritter or Joyce DeWitt, so she would not have to interact with them. The scenes were later edited to appear as if the characters were together.)

While providing some sense of continuity, the calls are rather ridiculous...even for Chrissy, who had always been portrayed as ditzy and dumb. Her end of the conversation is always so exasperating that Jack or Janet are shown rolling their eyes and putting down the phone in frustration. Instead of showing a connection with their old friend, it seems more like writers felt a need to keep showing Somers in some fashion, yet were venting their frustrations toward her with over-the-top, superfluous scenes.",1167264000,16,1416,4.970464135021097

A show that generally treated its lead actors as equals was in the early stages of appearing lopsided. John Ritter's role would begin to expand, culminating in a virtual ""one man show"" by the 7th and 8th seasons.

Still, season 5 has wonderful moments. Suzanne remained for the first few episodes and, at this point, she, Joyce, and John have their act honed to a perfect pitch. Jenilee at least brought an on-screen distraction to the off-screen legal battles that continued for many months. The scripts still seemed original and it was wonderful having Mr. Don Knotts return for his second season. The roommates really get their groove on in season 6, when Priscilla Barnes makes her debut.

2247378,3,B0007WQHFS,"The idea of making a sitcom based on roommates living together and the troubles that living together could produce generated a successful comedy sitcom named Three's Company.  The show aired between 1977 and 1984, and it is initial major twist was the senseless beauty Chrissy (Suzanne Somers) and attractive flower girl Janet (Joyce DeWitt) who live with culinary student Jack Tripper (John Ritter).  At the time, it was very controversial for men and women to live under the same roof if they were not married, as stereotypes often caused people to make strong sexual implications about people of opposite sexes that co-inhabit the same apartment.  This might have been the major reason why Three's Company was successful, as it often built its comic scenarios around stereotypes, misconceptions, and misunderstandings.

Jack has got away with living with Chrissy and Janet by telling his landlord that he is gay, which indicates that he would have no interest in the women in the apartment.  However, the lie also backfires on occasion to create additional awkward situations for Jack.  There are also many other situations that arise through other people's misunderstandings of what is being said or done, which builds up new situational humor for the audience.  It is in Jack's attempts to get out of the situations where he often worsens the moment with his clumsiness.  It is within these situations that the sitcom finds its value, as it offers an insight to the social context of the moment through a comic approach.

Early on in the fifth season, Suzanne Somers left the show when her demands on an increase in salary were not met.  Her dimwitted presence, as Chrissy was dearly missed, but Chrissy's cousin, Cindy Snow (Jenilee Harrison) picks up where Somers left off with a refreshing breeze of slapstick humor to complement Ritter's comic skills.  However, it is noticeable that the show has begun its slow decline until its end, as the shows began to feel more repetitive and unoriginal.  Nonetheless, the sitcom offers moments of terrific humor through its 22 episodes of the fifth season.",1132963200,3,2105,5.0520231213872835
2247379,3,B0007WQHFS,"While this show is one of my all-time favorites, there are many factors that made the 5th season less enjoyable than any of the previous 4 seasons, or the following 3 for that matter.

The first and most obvious is the departure of Chrissy Snow, the original blonde roommate as portrayed by Suzanne Somers.  Personally, she was my favorite of all the blondes, especially in the earlier seasons where her character was more naive than stupid.  Admittedly, Chrissy's stupidity became distracting and slightly annoying toward the end of her run on the series, but in my eyes, the show never regained the original chemistry it once had.  Besides, there is no closure when it comes to Chrissy; they should have at least tried to air a goodbye episode to explain her sudden disappearance.  However, the show was notorious for these unexplained departures, such as Cindy later on and Lana in the previous season.

I in no way blame Jennilee Harrison for the show's drop in quality during the 5th season.  Though it is obvious she is an untrained actress, she entered the show during a tense period and handled better than most people could.  She had big shoes to fill, and it's too bad they made her character so similar to Chrissy, because when the inevitable comparison comes, she does not quite match up to Suzanne.

Lastly, because of the void that had to be filled several times during this season, Richard Kline's role as Larry Dallas expanded significantly.  I love Larry, but I think he makes for a much better minor character, only coming in once in awhile to bring some variety into the roommates' lives.

Overall, despite knowing that I would not enjoy this season as much as my other four DVD sets, I still purchased the Season 5 set for a couple reasons.  I was most curious about all of the taglines that are usually cut out in syndicated episodes where Chrissy Snow makes her final appearances.  Though Chrissy is dumb as ever, it is the only opportunity a Three's Company fan will have to see Suzanne's final episodes.  Also, Chrissy's final two full appearances happen to be two of my favorite episodes.  And lastly, I think the show is still funny, despite all of the setbacks during this season, and I look forward to buying Season 6, when Terri Alden moves in and becomes the third (second best) blonde roommate.",1132444800,12,2325,4.72029702970297

I don't think that Joyce could have been replaced like meantion earlier. I enjoy Cindy alot too. She is my second favorite blond next to Terri. Her timing with John was great aswell. The extras on this set were weak, I do agree. Hopefully we can get better extras next season. And get ride of the ""BEST OF"" IMO that is just a waste of space.

2247402,4,B0007WQHFS,"Season five of Three's Company while remains consistantly funny, it is also the year that is known as the last season that Suzanne Somers appeared in, and then, in only two full episodes.

In year five, Three's Company was sold into syndication making a ton of money for the producers, and its three stars in terms of residuals if Somers and her husband had looked in the long term; but Somers and her husband tried to re-negotiate while the show was in full production for more money. Somers started to miss work, conveniently blaming it on a back injury she sustained. So entered Cindy Snow, played by Jennilee Harrison.

With all due respect, Harrison was not an experienced actress, much less an experienced comedic actress. Unlike Priscilla Barnes, whom the producers had ample time to find, Harrison was a last minute replacement that the producers had to scrambled to find with pratically just days on their hands. Furthermore, while Teri Alden was a completely original character, Harrison was stuck with a character whose purpose was use up the scripts that was already written with Chrissy in mind. You have to admit that Harrison was faced with a bunch of hurdles while on the show.

While I sympathize with Harrison, I still have to admit, she is no Chrissy Snow or Suzanne Somers, although she did made a good effort and showed that another blonde roommate other than Chrissy is possible for the show. After Suzanne Somers left, something did went out with the show that it never could quite replace. Ironically, Harrison would have some her best moments in Season Six, particularly in the episode ""Maid to Order"", where the storylines were actually written with her character in mind.

In any case, season five still managed to generate a lot of laughs in episodes such as ""And Justice For Jack"", ""Downhill Chaser"", ""The Case of the Missing Blonde"", ""Dying to Meet You"", ""Father of the Bride"", and Somer's last full show: ""A Hundred Dollars a What"". But still I wouldn't say that this year deserve a five stars rating, which is another problem I have with people who review on Amazon.com...they give out five star ratings like Halloween candy.

As for the DvD cover, it is misleading to show Suzanne on the cover, but perhaps, it is done contractually....during the entire season of Seasn Five, Suzanne is still billed as the star while Harrison got relegated to ""guest-starring"" status. No doubt her image will probably be on one of the discs.",1130544000,19,2458,4.828978622327791
2247403,5,B0007WQHFS,"Yes I love Chrissy as much as the next person, but I found Cindy just as entertaining. The comedy writing is what makes a show and Season 5 was at it's best! I have all the season dvd sets and Season 5 is the ONLY season I feel compelled to write a review for. This season is the one I've been waiting for and this is the FUNNIEST! Teacher's Pet, Case of the Missing Blonde and the best episode ever ""In Like Larry""! I still vividly remember these 3 episodes from watching them as a kid in the early 80's. Not to mention Mr Furley gets even more hysterical and really comes into his own! MUST BUY!!!",1129507200,4,599,4.128205128205129
2247404,5,B0007WQHFS,"Ok, stop the Jenilee bashing!  Yes, we were all disappointed when Suzanne left, but that's no reason to take it out on Jenilee.  Jenilee Harrison actually got better as the season progressed.  She was particularly funning in 'Janet's Secret', 'Father of the Bride' and 'Double Trouble'.  I was disappointed when she eventually left the show.  Besides, this season has some of the funniest episodes, even though some people refuse to admit it.  And yes, Jenilee does deserve to be on this cover.  So buy season 5 asap and watch Cindy 'knock Jack off his feet with a door'!

I'm also interested in watching those tag scenes with Suzanne, which seemed to have been edited out for syndication.

This is also a season where Joyce and Don do some of their best work on the show.",1129420800,12,772,4.659259259259259

Upstairs, Downstairs, Upstairs, Downhill Chaser, The Not So Great Imposter, Janet's Secret, Furley vs. Furley, In Like Larry, The Night Of The Ropers, Dying To Meet You, & Honest Jack Tripper.

Same goes for the other seasons. It's Ritter who makes the show worth watching, not Somers. You're missing out if you plan to avoid this season or 6, 7, & 8.",1128988800,4,415,4.594594594594595
2247406,1,B0007WQHFS,"The cover of the DVD boxset is misleading. Since Suzanne Somers only appeared in a few episodes, her image should not be put on the cover. Jenilee Harrison (Cindy) appeared in most of the episodes during season 5. In my opinion, ""Three's Company"" went downhill during this time. It did not become interesting again until Priscilla Barnes (Terri) came aboard. I do not plan to purchase the season 5 DVD when it's released in stores. I'm looking forward to the season 6 boxset when Barnes was introduced to the cast. The show greatly improved once she became part of the cast.",1128556800,2,574,4.693069306930693

2247408,3,B0007WQHFS,"I was a great fan of Three's Company until Cindy showed up.  She was one person who truly was not funny.  She was not a good actress and there was no chemistry between her and  Janet and Jack.  I think the character of Terri was able to save what was left of the show but the truth is, once Suzanne Sommers was gone, the show just wasn't quite the same.  Take Care... Rest in Peace, John Ritter....you were awesome! :-)",1127347200,4,419,4.1875

I don't rightly care when they release season six as I won't be buying it. This is one of my most favorite shows of all time and I really think the show suffered from the loss of Somers. Poor executive decision. As far as I'm concerned, the series ended with this season.",1125619200,5,409,4.256410256410256

Loved Three's Company. ..one of my all-time favorites but stopped watching it once Suzanne was replaced. Gave 3 Stars only  in an effort to not seemingly disrespect the Execellent art and talent of the cast...wouldn't dare do that....they're legends.
