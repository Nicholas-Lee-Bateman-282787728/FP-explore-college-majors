7789472,5,0780618653,"I just today found a twenty seven year old set of tapes I recorded in the fall of 1986 on PBS in Tacoma Washington.  Guess what they were?  After all, what else could anyone think or say when a SATURN 5 ROCKET ignited on the launch pad?  The series ran all week in the evening and at 7PM my whole family was on the couch, all five of us, watching, and I had a remote control with a wire going to the VCR in one hand.  I just finished watching it again for the first time in a couple of decades at least, and recalling the awesome wonder of those days when I was a boy watching the space program happening in real life from the 1960's.  Then I was able to share it with my own kids and my wife in 1986 during that October week.  I called my son who is 32 yrs old now and he remembered it. That old set of VHS tapes played pretty well, but now I bought it commercially for the first time, eager to compare the new set with my OLD ORIGINAL!!  Why has it not been remastered to DVD????  It would sell EXTREMELY well!  I recommend this video set to anyone and everyone.",1370044800,,1064,3.981132075471698
7789473,5,0780618653,"Why is this not available in DVD? As a space flight enthusiast, I have probably reviewed every significant video presentation and most books on its subject matter. This set remains one of my favorite sources for its superb retelling of this exciting and adventurous time with excellent footage selection and factual accuracy. Martin Sheen's narration is authoritative and captivating. The soundtrack, which PBS later released separately, is bold and exciting -- just as a sonic representation of the story should be. It is hard to do better than this series, and the majority of attempts at retelling that have followed have largely fallen well short. Even though the material presentation is a bit dated in its appearance, its historical value and quality of production far outweigh those minor disadvantages. Highly recommended. Fingers crossed that someone will one day see fit to re-release this in a quality DVD package.",1315612800,,925,5.256756756756757
7789474,5,0780618653,I have not bought this video from Amazon as I still have my original taped ones from the series when it ran on PBS....I HOPE Amazon is selling the later version (Post Challenger accident). I have both versions (I call them A and B)  but either one is excellent viewing. The B version was released after the Challenger disaster and the commission findings and included that info on the revised video yet did not leave anything out from the rest of the series. Wish they would make an updated version with Sheen again providing the narration.,1169251200,,540,4.625
7789475,5,0780618653,"This series made in the late 80's chronicles the US space program but goes much deeper into the history of flight and space travel. The historical aspects and investigation that went on behind the scenes is well evident in the quality of a production that this series is. If you are looking for something like a Hollywood movie, this is not it. If you are looking for an excellent tool to learn something about the space program, this is one of the best resources out there, even though it is almost 20 years old, even with the upcoming retiring of the Shuttle in 2010 (not too far away) it is still relevant and enjoyable to watch.

Martin Sheen does an excellent job as narrator and the producers were able to get many personal interviews of people who were involved in various stages of rocket development. I had the enjoyment of waiting for each episode to be aired on PBS (WHYY-Philadelphia), each week, and taped it on my recorder but the copy is well worn, so I purchased a new copy.

It gives you some insights into the minds of some of the developers caught up in the politics of their day during WWII (in their hearts and minds wanted nothing to do with war but hoped for the future peaceful uses of rocketry) an insight we do not often get. Their vision was of weapons of war turning into weapons of peace and for the betterment of others as well as protection against agression.

The series has lots of excellent historical footage and a decent soundtrack (not THE greatest but it adds to the series and generates some excitement).

The Spaceflight series is one of the most underrated and still unknown gems of space flight historical documentary film making.",1136851200,2,1672,4.581939799331104
7789476,4,0780618653,"First time I viewed this series was when my local PBS station aired it following the Challenger disaster. I had taped the shows but in the last 20 years they are long gone. So, I'm purchasing the Spaceflight series through Amazon.com. Too bad it's not on DVD. I loved Martin Sheen's narration as he walked us through the history of space flight. Most importantly however, I will view this series in the aftermath of the Columbia accident, a long return to the shuttle program which is now and the U.S. space program stuck in neutral. Perhaps we can regain the wonder and promise of manned space. This series showed us how it started.",1128816000,3,633,4.610619469026549
7789477,4,0780618653,"For any space flight buffs, or anyone interested in the history of this subject, this is an excellent excursion through one of the miracles of science.  This PBS film from the masters of educational documentaries highlights flight in space, from past to present, taking a look at the technology through the years.  Although some parts may be slow in pace in this tape, I still recommend this one to anyone interested in anything from early rocket models to modern-day space shuttles.",990662400,6,483,4.950617283950617
