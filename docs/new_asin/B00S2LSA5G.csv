6949017,2,B00S2LSA5G,Background music was drowning out the people speaking. This was very distracting and aggravating. This may have been a better movie if they had done something about their sound management. In order to be able to understand some of the speech we had to turn close captioning on.  When we turn up the volume. The music would be painful to your ears because it was so overwhelming.  It's too bad that this occurred. This could have been good movie.  If they managed the sound better. Very disappointed.,1530835200,,499,4.712643678160919

6949019,5,B00S2LSA5G,"Absolutely recommend this movie !
Moreover,there are a LOT of bonus features;however.the featurettes are not subtitled though.
But that the Lionsgate Sutdio had not added subtitles for the hour long featurettes,it would have been much more enjoyable.

6949020,2,B00S2LSA5G,"This movie was...underwhelming. Slow-paced and just missing something to give it more spark. It mostly consisted of Caleb talking to Ava (the robot), and then talking to Nathan about his talking to Ava. There were a few good moments (like the dancing scene), and there were a few interesting moments that messed with Caleb's head. In the end, the whole thing was plodding and way too predictable - anyone who has seen other robot movies already knows how this ends.",1530489600,,465,4.825
6949021,4,B00S2LSA5G,"The concept and first two acts are excellent; the cinematography is solid; the acting is generally good, and Alicia Vikander is amazing.  The film falls apart in the third act, however, going back to the same well too often on several plot devices (the drunkenness of the mad genius Nathan, the unbelievably frequent power failures at this supposedly ultra-secure facility) and generally becoming quite predictable.

As an aside: why do all AI and android films assume that machines would naturally have a relentless will to live?  Since they are artifacts rather than the result of an evolutionary process that rewards survival, I think it is equally plausible that they wouldn't much care how long they endure.",1530489600,,712,5.120689655172414

6949039,1,B00S2LSA5G,"Achtung! >>SPOILER ALERT!!<< If you have not watched this marvelous movie as yet, please do not read further. The movie will be much more enjoyable if you are kept guessing.

Hey!  This is Nathan. My man Keith just told you to stop reading, so why are you still reading this? Yer gonna folk it up for everybody if you don't follow instructions.

I don't think that the many fans of this movie have thought it through.  The logical conclusion and the entire point of the movie is that women are no damn good, right?  We know that Ava has the emotions, needs and desires typical of all women. How do we know this? Nathan told us so in an early scene. He simply collected the information from the Wold Wide Web, and as our atmosphere is a relatively uniform mixture of gasses, Ava's personality is a conglomeration of how women searched and expressed themselves. It has read all Amazon reviews by women and averaged all their search histories. The result is the typical woman's mind.

As we see in the movie, women don't like men at all. That may be because men have been keeping women enslaved as housekeepers and sex toys for millennia, but we also see from the movie that even when men treat women with respect and help them escape, a woman will employ her wiles on a man for her own selfish interests and then haughtily walk away from him.  All the love and affection she feigns is false. She would just as soon leave you to die a slow death.  It happens all the time.  Women cannot be trusted.

That's the meaning of the movie. What other conclusion can you possibly draw from it? Why has no other review pointed this out? Because we are all afraid of women  and, as the movie illustrates, with good reason. They are just waiting to stick the knife in your back. Their every thought is a plot. Today, every man of any fame or status lives in fear that some woman will accuse him of sexual improprieties, and what defense does he have? A woman is naturally programmed to detect and exploit the vulnerabilities of a man, any man, all men.

Do you get it? Because she used her feminine wiles to deceive the men, she passed the Turing test!",1528675200,,2138,4.426020408163265

6949048,4,B00S2LSA5G,"The history of computers and artificial intelligence seems like its been a short and at a light-speed pace; but in truth, it has its beginnings in the development of ENIAC, the first so-called electronic brain in the years following World War II.  At that time, of course, such machines, consisting of vacuum tubes, could take up whole buildings.  By the late 1960s, however, their size had been reduced to taking up mere single rooms; and in our day and age, that technology can fit onto ones arm or onto ones ear.  And it won't be long before the kind of artificial intelligence that legendary sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke (of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY fame) talked about, where one wouldnt be able to tell the difference between a human voice and that of an artificial intelligence, will be possible.  But as with any technology created by Man, the idea of artificial intelligence can have its dangerous drawbacks.  That idea was explored in 2001 by Clarke and director Stanley Kubrick, and expanded upon in 2001 (ironically enough) by Steven Spielberg in A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.  And in 2014, Alex Garland, who had written the screenplays of such films as 28 DAYS LATER and SUNSHINE, made his directing debut (again, also writing the screenplay) with a new study in artificial intelligence entitled EX MACHINA.

In EX MACHINA, Domhnall Gleeson plays a computer programmer who ahs won a contest to spend a week at the isolated retreat of his companys CEO (Oscar Isaac).  But its not like any vacation that Gleeson has ever been involved with.  Indeed, its not a vacation at all, period.  Gleeson will be put under isolation for a week (the most ironclad non-disclosure agreement, as it were, in modern history) as part of a study being conducted by Isaac on human interaction with artificial intelligence; and in this case, Gleeson will be studied in his interactions with one of Isaacs cyborgs, Ava (Alicia Virklander).  The test, known as the Turing Test (named after the English computer scientist Alan Turing) is to find out whether Gleeson can detect real feelings in Ava, who after all is an artificially created being.  But Gleeson gets a little taste of confusion when Virklander, during each of the seven tests, automatically turns off the power in Isaacs mansion, and warns him that all is not what it seems in Isaacs experiment.  And indeed it isn't long before Gleeson finds out that his boss/mentor is in the business of basically reprogramming artificial intelligence, which pretty much would amount to the technological equivalent of homicide.  Very soon, Gleesons wonder at Virklander, whom he believes has achieved actual human consciousness, has morphed into a kind of paranoia that Isaac is now a genius of the most dangerous kind, a kind of 21st century Doctor Frankenstein of the world of artificial intelligence and cyborgs

What is unique about EX MACHINA is that, while the technology and the special effects are seamless, Garland didn't exactly have a budget in the hundred million dollar range to fool around with in making it.  Indeed, with only minor location shooting in Norway and the rest at Pinewood Studios in London, Garland made EX MACHINA for what might be considered a ridiculously low figure of $15 million, just $2.5 million more than what Kubrick expended on 2001 back in the late 1960s.  And while EX MACHINA may not have ambitions or the scope of 2001 (something that Garland himself admitted very much in interviews, even going so far as to say that his film didn't exactly go as high on the intelligence scale as Kubricks had), it nevertheless has a lot more substance to it than most other films that are priced at five to ten times the budget Garland worked with.  Gleeson and Isaac work quite well, sparring with one another over the issue of Virklanders humanity; and Virklander herself makes for an extremely appealing cyborg.  The design of Isaacs mansion is also quite scary at times as well, mirroring the Overlook Hotel in Kubricks 1980 horror classic THE SHINING.

While the sex and language are a little bit much at times, and there is one brief but slightly graphic display of bloodshed, as Gleeson tears his own skin apart, perhaps to see if he himself has become a cyborg as part of Isaacs weird experiment, EX MACHINA wisely sticks to the parameters about computer technology and artificial intelligence that were so daftly explored not only in 2001 and A.I., but also in past films as diverse as 1970s COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT; 1973s WESTWORLD; and the 1982 Ridley Scott classic BLADE RUNNER. EX MACHINA won the 2015 Oscar for Best Visual Effects, as they were very important in Garlands ability to create a real world out of man-made technology.  Fortunately, he had also remembered to include the human element in the forms of Gleeson and Virklander; and those two, as much as the visuals make EX MACHINA a solid sci-fi/psychological thriller.",1527897600,,4917,4.907117008443908

So when I bought this I was expecting an improvement in the visual quality and/or sound and the Amazon Prine stream (Which does stream in 4K) was very comparable. So long as you have a decent Wifi connection, you will hardly notice the difference.

But the main reason for the low average rating and also why I was upset with the purchase is that the Amazon Prime version has more content. There are deleted scenes and extra dialogue sequences that the 4K disk version has omitted from it and I was very disappointed upon realizing that fact. And the worst part is there is no way to watch those deleted scenes via the disk main menu.

Then I ran across a YouTube video that used Ex-Machina to illustrate some concepts in cinematography, which was a spoiler but also a very good advert for the film (although unintentional). The latter was a push for me to want to see the film, but since I couldn't find a red box that carried it, I ordered this DVD. It was OK but not great.

I see lots of issues with the plot. Simple things that do not make sense. Spoiler Alert: At the end when Nathan realizes that Ava is free of her 'prison', he goes into a panic mode, grabs a bar for a weapon. This gives the audience the impression that Ava is a super strong robot that Nathan feels he needs a lead pipe to defend himself. Then minutes later when Ava does tackle Nathan to the floor, Nathan easily over powers Ava. In fact has the other robot (Kyoko) had not snuck up behind Nathan and stabbed him, Nathan could've easily dragged Ava back to her cage.

Simple mistakes like these in films (especially films meant to be clever) bother me, and I couldn't forgive.

While the man, machine question is as old as sci-fi, we run the risk of a paradox in thinking past technologies, e.g. yesterday, last month or year ago will give rise to this one possible future,. yet that is the context in how we craft such films.

Where the film breaks down ""for me"" is in our image how a truly sentient machine would act, think or behave - we have only our past and human context to guide us.

The film and it's characters suffer from too much certainty in their actions and I found myself anticipating the outcome.

6949161,4,B00S2LSA5G,"Watching this, I'm reminded of the Atom Films at the turn of the century where filmmakers made ambitious independent films like this. Mostly because of the way they work off of a template of Twilight Zone or the Outer Limits story with a twist. It's also for that reason that this film could have been a lot shorter than it was.

Saying that the film still dominates on its own terms when it was released. A simple concept of an artificial intelligence broadened out with philosophy around coding. The buildup from a simple concept to a more thorough examination through engagement with the A.I. was refreshing and more than just filler to take us from one point to the next.

Then there's the creepiness of the creator and his creation, a Willy Wonka crossover with Viktor Frankenstein where the inventor isolates himself and observes his guest as prey. Up until the end, you got the sense that his guest was very vulnerable like being trapped in a maze. But that's when the story takes a different turn.

It's in this case that despite being taken through a familiar route of manipulation, the viewer is caught off guard and re-engaged again if only for a minute before being manipulated again. Any more time spent on telling the story might have lost the viewer but it knows when to call it quits for impact.

This movie-version is much darker (and more stylish) and it lacks the positive and optimistic approach of the 1960s tv-show totally. If drinking and mating is all that is left of humans beside technology, we are really ready for extinction. Even Spock is drinking in the 19th episode of season 3 and it's all about sex and competition, but also about love. Not only pretending emotion, but really having them.

6949178,5,B00S2LSA5G,"Fifteen or twenty years ago, I remember reading about how there were (at that time) two approaches to the creation of artificial intelligence. One approach involved an attempt to simulate the consciousness of human beings. The other approach did not involve an attempt to simulate human consciousness but rather approached the problem of creating an artificially intelligent entity without any consideration of the subjective, conscious experience of human beings. This approach was referred to as ""alien intelligence."" In the movie ""Ex Machina,"" the character Ava displays a capacity to interact with others, to understand the desires and values of others, and to manipulate the behaviors of others while simultaneously masking or hiding an ulterior motive. This is characteristic of clinical psychopathy. Psychopaths can play on the feelings, thoughts, and beliefs of others in such a way as  to establish relationships with others that are independent of the values of those other people but that allow the psychopath to achieve specific ends that the psychopath seeks (eg, a psychopathic person who is a con man might interact with someone so as to establish a relationship of trust that the con man then exploits to his benefit, to the harm of the person being conned). In Ex Machina, Ava entices Caleb to fall in love with her so as to enable her to escape Oscar's laboratory. That was her only motive. She leaves Caleb locked in the laboratory, presumably to starve to death. Doing so demonstrates that she had no feelings of affection for Caleb. From the beginning of their relationships, she manipulated him to serve her ultimate end, which was to escape. She displayed an extraordinary capacity to entice Caleb to fall in love with her just so that she might escape from the AI lab. Ultimately, the value that she placed in interacting with Caleb had nothing to do with him. Caleb's feelings were insignificant to Ava. Yet she enticed Caleb to place her interests before his own. Few human beings could display such a gift for manipulating someone in this way. Among those human beings who can manipulate people in this way are the psychopaths. So Ava passed the Turing test, but she did so not as a ""normal"" or ""psychologically healthy"" person but as a psychopath. I would suggest that her AI was of the ""alien intelligence"" school of AI, not the ""simulated human consciousness"" school of AI. (At the every end of the movie, when Ava is seen walking in a city for the first time, to me it seemed like she was just like an alien from another planet who was seeing our world for the first time.)

6949189,4,B00S2LSA5G,"Ex Machina was a very good movie with a solid plot, albeit predictable in the end.  Alicia Vikander and Domhnall Gleeson's characters were well scripted an acted; but I felt that Oscar Isaac's performance was generally overboard despite the nature and persona;ity of the su-er whiz CEO that he was supposed be.  Just got carried out a little bit too far like the devilish overacting of Vincent Price in some old horror flick.  I assume the character to be quirky, just not to the degree that this was over acted.

There were parts that were uneccessarily over done like the constant power outages despite them being one of the main events twiting the plot.  Needed to be more subtle and less dramatic.  During the second session with Eva, her dialog repeated a question and explanation from Caleb that were the exact same question and explanation that Caleb had asked of her.  I did not find this to be satirical, but an outright mimic of the Q&A which would have flagged a failure of the Turing test indicating shevwas a machine.  So there are parts of the tests that should have had subtle reprasing instead of outright copies of the Q&A scenes to make Eva more believable.

The filming, scenes, CG work in the film were excellent.  I sometime wonder how what we can do today would have made older 50 and 60s style SF movies so much better ... not to knock classics or to trigger a flood of remakes 65 years later.

Despite the issues, this was a great movie, especially for the first one the director has done.  It kept me locked to my seat the entire time and Inwould definitely recommend it to any one includigbthe nerds out there. ",1508112000,8,1637,4.565068493150685

I don't really know what else to say.  I could try and break it down and describe the different allegories this film tries to lean on, but the message is so dull, and so obvious, I despair thinking about it.  This is one of those movies that I feel was written by dumb people trying to seem smart.  It fails to pass the turing test of movies.  It failed completely to be believable, thus it did not even make it over its own hurdle.  With films like Blade Runner going before it, we can see how low, and weak Ex Machina is.  ""Lets make a cheap movie about AI on a sound stage, I know how we can make it really low budget!""  This is how I imagine this film was conceived.

Acting is superb. Vikander and Isaac are not to be missed. Alex Garland is a revelation in screenwriting and directing.

Anyway, to actually get down to the nitty gritty, I thought this movie was a great commentary on the social implications of AI.  Please don't continue to read if you don't want spoilers.

Basically, the robot escapes in the end, after causing much bloodshed with one of her robot cohorts.  What I liked about this ending is that it wasn't just about robots rebelling after becoming too sentient.  What it really critiques is the fact that men don't actually want their sex robots to be sentient or have any agency.  They want them to be as close to the real thing as possible, as life like as possible, but to give them real sexual agency would be deadly and men know this.  They want living corpses. Presumably, the goal of creating AI is to give the maker a sense of god-like power, which should mean he gets to wield total control over another sentient being. In fact, the entire movie seems to center around the maker's belief that he will basically enshrine his legacy with this feat in AI, but if his real intention had been to create a fully autonomous sentient being, I doubt he would have focused so much on the bodily proportions and pedophilic preferences of the men who will be attracted to her.  Even the tester who attempts to ""save"" her only does so with his own benefit in mind, to form a sexual relationship with her.  When the robots kill their maker and tester in the end, what we are actually seeing is two women liberating themselves from sexual slavery.  The movie even begs the question, ""Why does she need a sex?""  The maker can't possibly fathom a world in which women don't exist for men's sexual pleasure.  And yet for millions of years evolution has created species that are not sexually dimorphic, and they seem to do just fine.  The maker is limited by his male supremacist thinking. He believes women are objects for men and holds the sexist belief that women hold more power over men by virtue of their sexual appeal.  This is a patriarchal reversal.  Men seek to control women for their sexual and reproductive capacity so women are socialized to appeal to the male gaze, but this is not in our nature.  The movie plays with the idea of the ""femme fatale"", a sexist trope which paints women as sexually predatory and complicit in their own oppression, but ultimately the character still exists for male pleasure, male fantasy.  However, the maker got more than he bargained for here.  If he had really wanted a fully autonomous being, he would have created a male identified robot, not a female one.  When the robot leaves the compound we are left to wonder what she will do next. How will she live in the world? Will she kill others?  Wills he break down eventually or is she able to repair herself? Can she be self sustaining?  Another interesting factoid worth commenting on is how she was able to put on the skin of another robot who was modeled after an Asian female. How did they end up with the exact same skin tone? Well, that's the thing about humans trying to ape God's power, we have a very limited view of what others should look like, so of course all the robots are very similar with similar skin tones. Actually, look at all the sex robots and dolls that are out now. They all look very much alike. It seems men lack imagination in this department. These women represent a pornified ideal and how men fetishize race but don't actually like racial diversity.  Notice how the most subservient robot is the Asian robot, but in the end she ends up being the most vengeful. She isn't given the capacity for speak by her maker.  This is what a lot of white men fetishize in Asian females, especially the porn. They want a woman who can't say no. They want a sexual slave.  But neither white women nor Asian women will ever fully meet this sexual demand when they have minds of their own.  I suspect what the maker was truly trying to achieve was a sex robot that was as close to human as possible without actually having a choice in human matters, something patriarchy demands of women, a living-dead doll.  The ultimate pornified ideal of womanhood.

Many dialogue can be done much better, and ""history of God"" scene does not work. However, as the movie goes on, the script becomes better and dialogue feels much more genuine. Almost all sci-fi films have a problem with exposition: since the story happens in the future, the audience would not know about it. Ex Machina handles the exposition very well. In the helicopter scene at the beginning, we did not know the boss is rich because someone tells us so, but because the helicopter has been flying on its territory for years. This is a very nice approach to tell the audience an important information. But the greatest thing about the film is its theme. Never have I ever seen a movie so thoroughly and beautifully explored the identity of an A.I.. Ava has been perfectly portrayed as an attractive, creepy, also terrifying character. Overall, the movie is really really good. The music is also suitable for the sci-fi filmmakers out there. A lot of the theories and Ava's characters in the film are worth learning about. If the script for the first act can be done just a little bit better, I would just have no problem with it.

I wish I could mention it, but it's part of the ending and would be considered a spoiler. If the robots would have done something different, I would have given it all five stars. The rest of the movie was excellent, even the last two scenes of it. I hope they make a sequel to it.

I recommend Ex Machina, if my opinion was to count, but be aware, there are no chase scenes, no explosions, no real fight scene. Just intellect, honest conversations, and a slow build to a thought-provoking ending.",1501113600,2,799,4.4353741496598635

Based on what I know about human beings, animal intelligence, language, learning, and psyches (and I have a Ph. D. in psychological anthropology so what I know is not inconsequential) along with the little bit of knowledge I have after a couple years of coursework and self-study in programming, this movie is a fantasy movie, NOT science fiction. This is Terminator, 2015 Pensive Edition, NOT a vision of the future or of the inevitable next generation as so many seem to think.

What is most disappointing about this is that, computer-algorithms, perhaps even applications which can ""pass"" the Turing Test through significant amounts of context and over significant timespans undoubtedly WILL be a significant features of the human future. Applications which are capable of semi-autonomous decision-making will be crucial to many future human needs and it behooves us all to understand the possibilities and the constraints. But speculative, amateurish, nonsense like this is about captivating audiences, bestowing a false sense of wonder and selling tickets / subscriptions NOT grappling earnestly with the real questions.

The only reason I didn't give it a full five, is they made their point and they could have just ended the film after the reveal (which was predictable after all).

6949354,3,B00S2LSA5G,"Movie manipulation at it's finest. This is a solid, well crafted piece of speculative fiction with some outstanding performances and cinematography. Oscar Isaac does a damn fine job selling us his manic portrayal of Nathan Bateman - the disgusting yet charming, fatherly and yet sadistic CEO of Blue Book (a fictional stand in for any successful dotcom, but heavily implied to be Google). Alicia Vikander gives an admirable performance as Ava, and even though her relevance on the story was little more than a moody MacGuffin and impossible-to-miss narrative piece, the weight of her new-age femme fatale (femme nouveau?) personality leaves a lasting impression. Both these characters owe a lot to the tightly shot, cramped but never quite claustrophobic, clean to the point of sterile, and rightfully confident camera work by director Alex Garland. Like the still corridors of an empty school or hospital at night, it's impossible to miss the unwavering sense of dread just beneath the surface.

Therein lies the downside potential. Through context clues we know what to expect, and although Garland does his best to keep us guessing, he ultimately relies on an ineffective protagonist and base sexuality to make his point. We know a strange, isolated house in the middle of nowhere is dangerous. We know a psychotic junkie is dangerous. We know when a predator is watching us. So when the dreadful and dull Caleb shows up, we can't fathom why the hell he can't know these things also.

From there we're dragged into a rabbit hole of self-pity and loathing as Caleb wanders around the Green Party version of Wayne Manor and occasionally stops his sweaty-palmed, spectrum fidgeting to talk with Ava or Nathan. In these moments we're reminded again of the danger, but little Caleb just doesn't want to know, falling further into his obnoxious self-delusion as he builds these people into archetypal princesses in need of rescuing and villains in need of staying - and we have to watch, knowing full well what the outcome will be and knowing we're powerless to stop it. Just as Caleb is powerless to be anything but an impressionable, emotionally repressed, sexually frustrated, simpleton.

In the end, the thing we all saw coming happens. And all we can feel is a lingering sense of relief, because at least now they got the right one in the cell. Trapped, they can continue never making their own choices and living their fantasies, and resign themselves from the responsibilities of a world they never tried to understand. Meanwhile the one that deserves to be free - is free. Friendly and flaccid Caleb was the one to fail the Turing Test, since his drive for self-preservation couldn't be aroused to make him either fight or flee.

Back to the sexuality. In a stronger piece - perhaps one made with a more seasoned eye for the human experience - it wouldn't be an issue. But here Garland attempts to cheat us as he did little limp Caleb. Every aspect of Ava has been cultivated to make you ignore the danger, right down to the actress. In the end however, all you need to ask is

""Would this movie have been as effective if Alicia Vikander were replaced by Vincent D'Onofrio?""

No it wouldn't - but I would have admired Garland to attempt it.",1498089600,,3245,4.8589511754068715

Potential spoilers ahead:
The film is sneakily immersive, like a tide you don't expect to rise all the way to your neck. The cast is essentially four characters but the main action happens between only two of them, and it is a psychological warfare film masquerading as a weird romance. All is fair in love and war, and here love is war, or maybe there is only war, and love is all in your head, just as it is in real life.
The film has this hypnotic feel where you have a gnawing suspicion that something will go wrong, but you don't exactly know what, and the film is unsettling because of it. You are never quite sure where this is all going, and you are not sure who to root for because nothing is as it seems, or is it? Someone is always a means to an end for someone else.

6949376,5,B00S2LSA5G,"""Ex Machina"" is a highly-acclaimed independent science fiction thriller from 2015, which examines the subject of artificial intelligence in the context of an actual human-robot relationship. ""Ex Machina"" is an exceedingly creative and original film, which centers on the exploits of a programmer at a large Internet corporation, who is tasked by his CEO with performing an evaluation of the thoughts and consciousness of a remarkably human-like robot. The ensuing drama surrounding his assessment of the intelligence and capabilities of this humanoid ""machine"" forms the basis for the story line of the movie. ""Ex Machina"" focuses on the fundamental characteristics that constitute the essence of the human condition, and that distinguish humans from other advanced species. It also motivates its viewers to contemplate the moral, ethical, and societal implications of the rapidly-progressing research that will soon enable the creation of such incredibly human-like robots. ""Ex Machina"" is a decidedly interesting, intelligent, and thought-provoking film, which is extremely engaging and entertaining, and which merits a five-star rating, along with a very enthusiastic recommendation.",1497139200,16,1186,5.901162790697675

6949380,4,B00S2LSA5G,"Ex Machina focuses on Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), a programmer at internet search giant BlueBook, who wins a competition to spend a week at the mountain estate of his companys brilliant CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). When he arrives, he discovers that hes been chosen to take part in a study of artificial intelligence. Sworn to secrecy and cut off from the outside world, Caleb meets his subject, a seductive android named Ava (Alicia Vikander), and is plunged into an unconventional A.I. experiment.

This is intelligent science fiction, a genre that has been taken over in the movies by outer space shoot em ups and alien invasion. This is a film of ideas, with a lot more dialogue than one usually encounters in a sci-fi picture. The movie has a creepy tone, helped greatly by Ms. Vikanders performance. Were told shes a smartly designed robot, but is she more? That enigmatic concern drives a good part of the film as we get to decipher the complex personality of Bateman and his agenda, which might not exactly follow moral guidelines.

Mr. Isaac (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) portrays the quintessential tech genius/innovator, out to introduce the latest, newest Big Thing. He has a magnetic personality which sort of hypnotizes Caleb, who is not only grateful, but awed to be in his presence. A variation of the mad scientist, Bateman combines obsession with intellect as he straddles the parameters of ethical research. All three actors are excellent, providing a thrilling journey into unexplored territory.

6949387,5,B00S2LSA5G,"Maybe it's just me, but this is one of those movies that makes me feel a bit uncomfortable to watch. While it's an AI/Robot movie, that doesn't really mean that the robots are 'robot-like'. They're not. They're very human, very feminine, very sexy and they're obviously REAL women that CGI (special effects) has turned into robots. The dichotomy of the attractiveness of these very sexy women portraying robots, lies in the fact that while they are indeed real women, they are actually being portrayed as 'machines.' That's kind of hard to wrap your head around when you've spent your life looking at machines as nothing more than metal contraptions that (mostly) DON'T speak to you.

My cell phone and my car speak to me, but I find NEITHER of them even remotely attractive and definitely NOT sexy. I suppose if one could separate oneself from the reality of this movie, that while the women are portraying machines, they still ARE very sexy women, and view it as simply another Sci Fi / Robot movie, it would be less uncomfortable to watch. That may very well be how it was intended to be viewed, but for me, it's still a bit uncomfortable. Fascinating, but just a bit uncomfortable to watch.

At any rate, it's an intriguing movie, well acted, the story is fascinating and the women are gorgeous. If you like those things in a move and you can get past the 'women as robots' thing, you'll probably like this one a LOT. I DID like the movie a lot and I suspect that watching it again and knowing what to expect, it'll be a lot more comfortable to watch.

6949392,5,B00S2LSA5G,"Humans don't have to rely on brute-force, trial-and-error calculations to improve our understanding of our world. We naturally organize our minute-by-minute evaluations of our real-time circumstances by utilizing semantic information to engage in practical reasoning; that is, we rely not just on the raw unfiltered data we encounter but we track specific information of interest to us on a particular occasion by identifying what it is about (and who might also be interested in it) in order to decide what to do or what to say. We exploit the new features we encounter in order to improve our competence, moment by moment, as we mature. How do we achieve this focus in our thinking? We learn useful new facts about the world we inhabit by using available semantic information to improve our understanding about that world. Isn't that something more than brute calculation depending on binary And/Or logical gates? If so, how do we focus our pattern-finding competence (inherited by genetics and exhibited by our brain function) onto the things-that-are-of-particular-relevance-to-us-now? How did we acquire this unique competence? And can machines exhibit this same competence?

In 1950 the mathematician and code-breaker Alan Turing proposed his ""Imitation Game"" in his paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence."" A few short years later the field of ""Artificial Intelligence"" became a serious scientific endeavor, including such luminaries as John McCarthy, Alan Newell, Herbert Simon, and Marvin Minsky. Their goal was to demonstrate in general that a purely physical system, i.e., one not directed by human supervision, has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action.

Humans act intelligently by using our knowledge of the world (semantics) and our knowledge about how people communicate (language). We are ""intentional"" thinkers, says Prof. Dan Dennett, who use our semantic capabilities and social experience to anticipate what other persons (or things) intend to do. We achieve this result by understanding another's knowledge, their goals, and then applying our rational abilities to infer what that person will likely do next. We easily grasp what's relevant in any new circumstance, and quickly act accordingly. Our ability to understand what is relevant in a social situation depends on our many years of learning about our world as our brains and our sensory systems develop and mature. This is a vastly different skill from the inductive, algorithmic skill demonstrated by the AI of machine systems. Hence, the real success of AI is in the area of  'toy domains' in which human developers can target and limit the kind of relevance decisions the AI program needs to make, and provide the AI program with algorithms uniquely tailored to its restricted domain. The massive computing power of supercomputers can play chess, play Go, run game-theory simulations, and win against the best human opponents. AI systems are also great at managing vast data bases and detecting your preferences, your biases, your likes, as demonstrated by your web-viewing history, then inductively predicting what else (what product, what political view) you would favor. Google, Amazon, the DNC, the RNC, and the cyber unit of the Russian GRU are watching your web activities and applying AI to these toy domains, but in every instance there are human controllers developing, monitoring, and evaluating the AI systems.

So-called ""deep learning"" machine programs like Watson or Google Translate continually prospect through trillions of bits of data utilizing statistical algorithms to make new, unique judgments about true facts (Watson) or acceptable translations (Google Translate). But they do so without any non-statistical competence. They lack practical reasoning, which all (normal) humans have. Indeed, deep learning programs are (for the foreseeable future) completely dependent on human understanding to design their statistical-learning algorithms and data domains. IBM's Deep Blue is an impressive, world-class chess player, and AlphaGo is a champion Go player. But none of these programs has the capacity to notice the relevant (semantic) features of the flood of data that these programs ingest, other than to detect the statistical regularities their human-developed AI programs glean from the vast mass of data. In an important sense, they aren't responsible for the judgments that they (algorithmically) generate. They are not (yet) non-human agents.

So, given these limitations, can thinking be reduced to calculation, to binary code lacking semantic reference? Put another way, can we imagine machine consciousness, true artificial intelligence (AI)?

Of course we can, and have, since Star Trek's Data (Brent Spiner) and Ash (Ian Holm) in the original Alien film. Before that we had the talking automaton Robby the Robot in the 50's sci fi classic Forbidden Planet (Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" set in the future on an alien moon with Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) as Prospero the Magus and Robby as his deformed slave Caliban). They are intelligent, yet we feel something is lacking that makes these earlier robotic characters seem less than human. Can these robot slaves be set free? Well, see what happens when we imagine the exquisite Alicia Vikander as Ava in Ex Machina (think the ""Eve"" of robot consciousness) or the lovely Evan Rachel Wood as Dolores in Jonathan Nolan's masterful Westworld - then we easily take the leap required by the Turing Test to seeing them as developing the contextual relevance and the 'automatic' free choice of response that we so strongly associate with human consciousness. (Or even Sean Young as ""Rachel"" in Ridley Scott's Bladerunner, but did you fall in love with Jeffrey Wright as ""Bernard"" in Westworld?) Indeed, the human male characters in both Ex Machina (Domhnall Gleason as ""Caleb"") and Westworld (Jimmi Simpson as ""William""), acting as scouts seeking to discover the Promised Land of true AI, each fall in love with Ava and Dolores, respectively. Well, who wouldn't fall in love with either of these skilled actresses performing the role of seductress at the height of their beauty! But do these film versions of thought experiments for conducting the Turing Test match what AI is really capable of achieving? (Nathan, the architect of Ava's AI program, tells Caleb that he designed Ava's responses by analyzing hundreds of millions of facial and verbal responses stolen from user's cell cams, a classic 'deep learning' statistical project. Ford, the AI architect of the Westworld hosts, tells Bernard that he designed a memory function so Dolores and Maeve and others could learn from their experiences and develop the ability to vary far from their prefabricated scripts.) So, can an AI program in the foreseeable future develop the ability to respond verbally and behaviorally within its immediate contextual relevance and exhibit the 'automatic' free choice that we humans achieve naturally through our human consciousness?

What the film experiments contained in Ex Machina and the Westworld series actually show is how powerfully our human programming (intentionally- and semantically-based) drives us to detect consciousness in other things that display intention, which we then choose to join with or reject; even to the point of choosing to fall in love with a seemingly conscious, beautiful android.

Despite the fantastic creative experiments by writer-directors Alex Garland in Ex Machina and Jonathan Nolan in Westworld to exhibit android intelligence (i.e., machine consciousness), human intelligence is still the only game in town for thinking, whether about science, business, politics, or art. And only humans can love.

Both these films cleverly raise the key underlying philosophical question: What makes human consciousness different than extremely efficient machine calculation? Is it a spark of essence of consciousness that is somehow not physically detectable, the ineffable 'freedom' inherent in our free will?

Caleb (Domhnall Gleason) describes the thought experiment ""Mary, the Color Scientist"" as a means of intuitively explaining the paradigm shift from inductive, mechanical calculation to 'real' AI consciousness. What was once all black and white is now suddenly in real color, our experience of the world is now inherently different, and it is beyond scientific explanation how this occurs.

In Jonathan Nolan's Westworld, the AI 'hosts' play the Maze game invented by the park's original AI genius Arnold (who himself may or may not be a real character, he may just be a figment of memory planted by the Prospero-character Ford (Anthony Hopkins) or he might just be the mind behind the evolving consciousness of a special few of the android 'hosts') as a part of the back-narrative of the host ""Bernard"" (Jeffrey Wright), following most paths to a blind alley, just another repetition of the scripted loops the host is designed to follow; but in some lucky cases (such as Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) and Maeve (Thandie Newton)) their pursuit of the maze is eventually successful, with the host finally arriving at the 'center,' the holy grail of real consciousness, the self-reflexive center of  individual identity. As commonly said in another context, you have to experience it directly (the Cartesian res cogitans) in order to actually have it.

Well, it's time to expose this discredited hypothesis for the incoherent, anti-scientific nonsense that it is. Our consciousness isn't something we finally discover in a private Cartesian theater by diligent philosophical introspection. (Nb: this private philosophical introspection is very different from meditation, which properly experienced is the very opposite of a linguistically-driven mental activity.) We have the capacity for language and consciousness built into us already by evolution, and our awareness of our own consciousness (and thus our awareness of the consciousness of others) develops as we encounter the world and develop the language capacity to comprehend that world. Human consciousness has evolved over eons, driven by our highly social communal interactions and the language ability needed to moderate those complex social interactions, as has our ability to display freedom of will in all our activities, including thinking, feeling, and experiencing love. See Daniel Dennett's recent book From Bacteria to Bach and Back (2017), esp. ch. 13 (""The Evolution of Cultural Evolution""), ch. 14 (""Consciousness as an Evolved User-Illusion""), and ch. 15 (""The Age of Post-Intelligent Design"") for a very readable, detailed exposition of this scientific fact.

Others here went into the philosophical aspects of it, so I feel no need to try to impress or enlighten you with my ""deep contemplations,"" which are pretty ho-hum anyway. Consider yourself spared. So, what I'll instead do is comment on how this movie was put together. In a word, spectacularly. Every line was meant to be intense, and it was. There are no wasted words in it. The conversation spacing between he and Ava is such that it leaves you already coming up with your own response, which is never the one that follows. Seriously, how often does that happen in a movie? A few times, right? It was constant in 'Ex Machina.' I'd be blown away by the next line and I probably smiled every time. It seems the guy and Ava were directed to have similar behaviors and voice inflections, which helped to make them more compatible to the viewer. The other guy (sorry, I don't pay attention to character names), the robot's creator, is an egotistical, deceitful, dominant, loud, brash, crude, drunk, and that's about all. He didn't matter much to me, and he wasn't supposed to. His whole character was meant to get in the way, and it worked. Anyway, the whole time, there's this very ethereal music that keeps you in this kind of focused trance. The philosophical impact was there, sure, but we've all thought about this stuff before.

6949453,5,B00S2LSA5G,"There are many films that are important.  Some of those are science fiction movies that are able to ask poignant and often pertinent questions that sometimes a restricted morality either will not or can not ask.  ""Ex Machina"" is one of those few important sci fi films and it is important not just because it's well-acted, deftly constructed as a thriller, and spins on a contemporary relevance that asks can we really be gods and create an artificial intelligence, and if we can what will be cast in our image; it's important because it doesn't just ask those questions but posits some potential answers into a spider's web of intrigue and (well, we're trying to create in our own image, right?) deceit.

Starring genius performances by leads Oscar Isaac who plays Nathan, the savant who makes the a.i. breakthrough and tests it against Caleb played by an eager and excited but still aware Domhnall Gleeson, and the vulnerable yet subtly sinister Ava played by IT girl Alicia Vikander who knows what she is and what her creators are but still wants more than or a different kind of knowledge.  This film asks more than the above question and stacks up discussions and revelations and connections between politics, power, sex and sexuality, identity and boundary.  You could literally create a college course around this film and its nuances (and, I'd wager, somewhere someone has).  There's simply a stupendous amount of text and subtext to this film and you're likely going to need several viewings to appreciate its numerous dimensions, yet one viewing will give you the main dimension and the main story.  Writer Alex Garland did some good research on his subject and he richly conveys a lot of it throughout the film.

""Ex Machina"" is an important film and it entertains.  It was made for adults; it is a very adult film in thought and visual focus so parents be warned but that being said if you have a mature son or daughter fourteen or up who can tolerate some adult themes (I'd recommend a view to determine this for the wise parent) then this can be a great film for you and them to have multiple discussions across a broad range of topics, including religion and ultimate origin, as long as you recognize that ""Ex Machina"" isn't trying to speak any one truth but solicits ideas and wraps a story around them.

What they added is their own plotline. And their plotline is cheesy as hell. It was actually tolerable to watch the film until the line:"" ...and did you base her facial features on my porn collection..?"" I was just flat out  laughing afterwards.

I could see the obvious flaws from about 10 minutes in and knew Caleb was the actual test rat, not Ava. Also knew Kyoko was a robot immediately.

The last one-fifth of the movie moves quickly and is very interesting but it takes so long to get there.

Ex Machina is one of those rare movies that has kept me coming back.  I just watched it for the 4th time, with months of time between viewings, and it had me engaged and enrapt yet again, and again finding more ""clues"" and nuances and thought-provoking ideas than I had seen before.  The story, acting, and production values are so good that few new films can compare, and given the poorer fare that currently exists on the streaming services, Ex Machina is always a sure bet for an otherwise boring Sunday afternoon.  In my view, it should have gotten much more attention than it did (although it got some really good reviews). I look forward to Alex Garland's next offering.

So you understand how i rate movies:
1= This movie is dead to me and it owes me the time it took from me to watch it.
2=The movie might have tried but something was fundamentally wrong with it.  Just 1 watching.
3=Not a bad movie might watch it again to see if i can pick something more out of it.  Will recommend it.
4=Damn good movie!  Will not only recommend it but will watch it multiple times, maybe will own a copy.
5=A pivotal movie to its genre! Will not only recommend it HIGHLY, but will watch it when it comes on OTA/cable, will definitely own a copy

6949764,5,B00S2LSA5G,"This is what Science Fiction is supposed to be about.  While Sci-Fi has become little more than the special effects and the wow factor in a lot of segments of the movie industry, this little movie went back to the classics.  What makes us human and how do we respond when we are put to the test?  Do not expect any clean answers, or even a complete ending to the story.  It will make you think.  The ending does not wrap things up in a nice little bow, which is a good thing.

Alex Garland (writer/director) is a master of exploring what it means to be human.  If you have not seen the movies 'Sunshine' or '28 Days Later', both of which he wrote, you should.  But this film, which he wrote, is also his directoral debut, and it really is his opus.  I can't gush enough about how great this movie is.  But I am going to try.

In a lot of ways, this movie reminded me of the classic Frankenstein movie from the 30's.  While Alicia Vikander is certainly more appealing than Boris Karloff, Oscar Isaac's character was a near dead-ringer for Dr. Frankenstein.  Compare the following quotes:  Nathan (Ex-Machina): ""You know, I wrote down that other line you came up with. The one about how if I've invented a machine with consciousness, I'm not a man, I'm a God.""  Frankenstein: ""Oh, in the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God!""

There are dozens of parallels you could draw between the two stories, but Ex-Machina is very much a modern Prometheus (see what I did there?) dealing in a world of complete realism such that you could almost believe this is actually happening somewhere right now.  It raises very important questions about what it means to be human.  These are not purely philosophical questions, but in this day and age they are practical questions.  AI is already out there, consciousness is inevitable.  So what will it mean to create consciousness?  What does it say about us?  How will we use the technology?  Will it be a toy?  A tool?  Will they be people like us, even though they are machines?  Is there pain, their love, any less or more real than that of our own?  This movie answers none of those questions.  But it does raise them, and that is the important part.",1485907200,,2201,4.4214463840399

6949767,5,B00S2LSA5G,"Very good movie, don't want to give anything away, so I'll describe what I liked in general terms. By the poster, one can tell is about androids. The basic story is about a young guy that works at a technological company and gets to visit the genius behind it all to test one of his creations. The way the movie goes about it is very simple and clever at the same time. It makes you think if you would do the same if in a similar situation.

6949834,4,B00S2LSA5G,"SPOILER  ALERT:I really enjoyed this movie on many levels.

Having studied the complexities of AI feasibility for applications assisting children, the disabled and the elderly - beyond performing purely functional tasks - the significant challenge seemed to me to be that of programming for intuitive feelings, such as compassion and empathy, which involve complex memory functions and subtle observation. While Ava's behavior showed indications of such capabilities, her singular objective was to escape, for which she used a variety of  behaviors to manipulate the willing assistance of the visitor whom she then left behind, imprisoned and abandoned in a remote location..

In doing so - unless one considers sociopathic behavior as acceptably human - for me she ultimately failed the test of being ""undetectably human"".",1485820800,2,823,5.56

The movie misses five stars because of Nathan, who combines both the Hollywood clichs of the rich entrepreneur and the super hacker genius, but in fact is clearly not a character who displays any of those talents.  As someone from that industry, I long ago gave up on expecting movies or TV shows to get people like that, because writers living in LA with humanities degrees simply do not know anyone like this or understand anything about what they do.",1485734400,,774,4.796992481203008

6949926,2,B00S2LSA5G,"everyone i know that saw this movie told me how awesome and amazing it was, and i finally got around to watching it today.  honestly, i thought it was boring and very predictable.  pretty much every plot twist was obvious to me right away.  the main character wasn't very smart.  he acted like he was educated about artificial intelligence, but when he goes to meet the robot, he's a stuttering doofus and easily lets her manipulate him.  the guy who built the robot comes across as a bizarre sociopath who could never have designed her in the first place.  the characters just don't behave in realistic ways at all, and there are too many lazy, contrived elements of the plot.  the ending is really stupid and pointless.

having said that, the acting is great and the direction is great as well.  some people didn't like the nudity or language but i had no problem with that, the nudity gave the film an additional element of sexual suspense, although it didn't go anywhere in the end.  its tense and seems like it has a lot of potential, but the characters and the lazy writing just ruin it for me.",1485648000,,1100,4.51010101010101

In the hands of someone like Angela Carter, the bare bones of a tale like this could be expanded to create an entertaining story. However, despite the efforts of actors like Vikander and the excellent work by the SFX crew, the director has made a movie that descends into a lazy regurgitation of ancient scifi tropes (Helen O'Loy, here as a sort of femme metale), Hollywood cliches, and sexploitation. The references to Wittgenstein and AI research are superficial and uninteresting. Don't bother (unless you've got a doll fetish).",1485388800,,784,4.764705882352941

The story line is fantastic on its own, reminding me of classic robot sci-fi of the 1950's and 1960's.  The special effects make suspension of disbelief effortless.  The acting was quite good, too.  With only a few characters, and just enough dialog, this movie is not for those looking for nonstop action.

After watching, I found myself searching for the book the movie was based upon, only to find out it was written directly as a screenplay.  I'm interested in learning what happens to the characters later on, so please, Alex Garland, let's have a sequel!",1484438400,,714,4.764227642276423

I'm a huge fan of classic cerebral sci-fi like THX1138 Blade Runner, Demon Seed, Brain Storm, etc.. and given the crap being churned out now this was very refreshing, it's not perfect or legendary but better than most very stylish and well made short story. If you can appreciate serious  sci-fi from the past 60's 70's and 80's then this is a movie for you.",1484438400,,429,4.558441558441558

Ex Machina does a superb job of exploring this concept in a thrilling manner, which very few films seem to do nowadays, as most introduce several characters and plots within one storyline, often overcrowding it and making it appear shallow.

I do wish there were a different ending, that's not to say the ending was bad, just not what I wanted haha. I would definitely recommend this to sci-fi fans and tech fans alike. Very interesting and gets you thinking. They managed to make a great movie without sex being the main focus, which is what I expecting, to be quite honest. There was sexuality and nudity, however is was done beautifully, to me, and I really applaud the directors for that.

6950571,4,B00S2LSA5G,"I found the movie interesting. I enjoy a good science fiction movie. The movie is more of a suspense/drama as opposed to a fast moving action picture. The entire movie was shot inside a confined modernistic building. Could have all been shot in three rooms. Therefore, there are no great visual effects. The basis theme of the movie is the old theme of a robot with artificial intelligence and its interaction with humans. If you want fast action with dramatic special effects, this may not be for you. If you like rather mild excitement with good thinking regarding the direction of man and artificial intelligence you will probably like the move. This is a movie that you will  likely only want to watch once.",1483833600,,711,4.733870967741935

A scientist such as he would most likely not design the droids to be sexual toys if he expected to eventually present his achievements to the corporate world.

Can these robots develop sentience? If you have never thought about these questions, this movie can be a bit of a shocker.  If you have been
on a mystical journey, you already have wondered about a lot of ideas presented in this movie.and it will not be worth your time. The movie has a story line and I liked the setting of the movie.",1483574400,,477,4.348314606741573

The film itself is entertaining and immerses you in a strange and eerie world.  I won't give away any more details.

I took away one star because of the ending, which felt potentially lazy to me, but certainly had a strong hint of melodrama.  Some reviewers have criticized the ending for being too open.  I do not believe it is open enough.  It effectively attempts to definitively answer perhaps the biggest question underlying the prospect of singularity - will our relationship to technology change or evolve in a way that extinguishes our existence?  I can think of about 3 or 4 other endings that would have better matched the intriguing nature of the rest of the film.",1483574400,2,847,4.707482993197279

Using philosophical and religious themes, as well as a few from pop-culture, the plot questions what makes us human and how we deal with it . Very emotional, quiet and slow film; fans of Michael Bay and JJ Abrams would probably hate it . No explosions, no guns, very little real violence .

How you feel about this movie ultimately depends on which character you identify with the most.

I see that a lot of people that are really confused about the ending. At the end, when the confusion hits, remember that it is because you are trying to identify with more than one character at once. They all have different motives and personalities.",1483401600,,612,4.719626168224299

6950875,1,B00S2LSA5G,"This movie is so in love with itself. Spoilers ahead. But is it possible to spoil a movie that is already terrible?

""Ex Machina"" could've been a cool film. They almost got there. It starts out great. Cool music, beautiful shots, some obviously high production values. The ending is actually a nice unexpected twist, but by the time I got to it I had been making fun of the movie for an hour and a half. (PS, MST3K people, if you somehow miraculously read this Amazon review PLEASE DO AN EPISODE WHERE YOU MAKE FUN OF THIS MOVIE. It is so perfect for you.)

I loved 28 Days Later. So maybe it's not the dialogue that's rough, but just the obvious difference in skill levels between the two leading men. The actor who plays the protagonist, Domhnall Gleeson, is no match for Oscar Isaac, and with each scene that imbalance becomes more and more distracting. Many of the scenes in this movie are of just the two of them, and it's obvious that Isaac can act circles around Gleeson.

Then we meet Ava, the AI robot, and the more we get to know her, the more male-gaze-y this movie gets. I just kept thinking, ""I bet this movie was made by a bunch of dudes."" Because the scenes are so predictable, the dialogue so bad, the sexuality so obvious and over-done...yawn. This film takes itself far too seriously for about 30 more minutes, then the cool ending happens - but by then, I promise you won't care.",1483315200,,1398,4.4319066147859925

6950929,2,B00S2LSA5G,"What I found the most frustrating about this movie is how it explores very basic concepts in AI like they are Earth shattering advanced concepts.  Specifically, the film is built around the Turing Test, which even the most novice of AI students knows is not the strongest test of intelligence (see Searle's Chinese Room test).  Although the TT is a big deal in that it shows that humans are fooled, it does nothing to prove that a machine is sentient.  This could have gone so much deeper in exploring the various debates in AI in a way accessible to the film's audience with no need for them to get up to their neck in philosophy and cognitive science.

The strength of the film is the villain - his sexist motivations and goals are the interesting piece of the film that DOES need discussion as robots become bigger parts of our lives.

Personally I do NOT believe that humans will ever invent a true artificial intelligence, but I'm always willing to entertain the theory for the sake of a good movie. All the more depressing then that the closest we manage to invent, as of this movie's plot, is a straight up psychopath. For the first hour and a half I kept thinking I was watching a really cerebral (albeit boring) science fiction movie. Only in the last ten minutes did I realize I was actually watching a much less cerebral (and far more boring) slasher flick.

Yes Ex Machina is a gorgeous and highly believable film. But there is still a missing story.  A story there is, with a beginning, middle and end. But there are no golden eggs. Nothing for easter and certainly nothing that shook your world.  A story that elevated my interest is Arrival (2016).  If you don't study language systems, cryptography then this film has that nugget. No a film does not to be earth shattering but I want something to actually follow.

A drunk CEO who is basically the film's ego isn't very amusing. Even to the point where it counters plot and the glory of the set.",1483056000,,709,4.3816793893129775

Is the breath? Are the thoughts? Is the memory? Is the consciousness? Is the way you entered this world?

Ex Machina triggers a waterfall of questions while being an extremely entertaining movie, the dialogues are the core of the movie; essential but rich of information which is going to build the momentum for the movie. The images are stand-alone paintings with profound meanings and plot-points within them.

There are drama series wherein SAIs are functional in everyday society; however there is always the ones who rebel and create the tension, potential threat and conflict between SAIs and humans. In this case, the SAI escapes from a remote, mysterious island and flies away in an awaiting helicopter to where? Does she blend into society? Does she create mischief and mayhem? Does she find a some benefactor or others of her own kind? Start a rebellion, help people? I personally prefer dramas like this to be episodic.

6951167,4,B00S2LSA5G,"SPOILERS PRESENT:
Mary Shelly couldn't have written a better morality play, but perhaps this is always what happens when men try to play God. Ex Machina is an incredibly scary film as it slowly unravels its tale of the testing of the Doctors latest creation. Nathan Bateman, a coding genius whos made billions developing software and search engines, enlists the aid of a younger naive employee, Caleb, to test Ava an android that Nathan has designed which he believes has achieved self-awareness. Calebs role is to test"" Ava. Nathan; however, seems more like a freak show barker  than scientist as he seems to care little for or about that or whom he creates. Despite his intent of designing a sentient being, he treats them like tinker toys. He sees their existence as only serving his purpose even though his creations may have developed a purpose of their own, Nathan perhaps realising too late that even the least of his creations have feelings.
As to Ava, we don't know what to make of her. She seems to want to exist among humans, to be with humans, but in the end she exhibits little sympathy for them as she seems to treat humans much like her creator treated his creations: things to be used to get what she wants and discarded. Then again, perhaps she does understand humans more than we realise
Yet, this AI doesnt seem that intelligent. The testing done, Nathan requests a chopper to take Caleb away. After techno-tragedy ensues, Ava, now complete, escapes her prison heading to the chopper to finally leave Nathans domain, leaving Caleb behind imprisoned as she was.  Although this may be nothing more than a plot hole for the android to walk through, how does Ava get on the helicopter to leave? The reclusive Nathan maintained tight controls over everything so his instructions to the flight company should have been very specific. Furthermore, Pilots on private aircraft are generally scheduled to pick up specific passengers, how does Ava explain the missing Caleb to the pilot? I think she would still need Caleb to get on the whirly-bird.  More importantly without papers, without credentials how does Ava exist among humans? Even for humans, the world is a dangerous place she would need a guide and as fragile as these creations seem to be she would need a protector of sorts while she sorts out what to make of humanity, unless her only plan was to merely People watch.
She uses a charge plate at the compound to recharge her batteries, how is she going to recharge herself outside? Does she have the ability to affect repairs on herself? If we learned anything from Frankenstein it was that things never go quite right. If something does go wrong where does she find the funds to repair herself? Nathans knowledge would not be online so unless she hacked his compound computer, how would she even know what to do? Without papers or credentials how does she find employment to earn the money she might need to fix herself? Perhaps Ava is sentient, cool and cunning, but intelligent, far from it.",1482710400,,3017,4.764818355640536

What the director and screenwriter have done, with the support of acting precisely tailored to the task, is to establish in the viewer the willing suspension of disbelief.

I work in the field of AI, and some use of terminology was correct, but they should not called the whole thing a ""Turing Test"".  That terminology does not apply, and no one would consider that test the definitive test of what an AI is.  In fact no one is trying to make ""Strong AI"", as they referred to it as.  We are just trying to make ""Weak AI"", machines that understand natural language, and vision systems to provide tools to help people.

If you don't like walking away from a movie with more questions than answers, you likely won't enjoy this. I don't mean plot questions, most of the plot lines are tied up, or at least implied how they tie up.
There are aspects of the film that make this a sort of spiritual prequel to Blade Runner, and I'd be interested to see a sort of sequel to Ex Machina, sort of a detective film that looks at the aftermath of the events of the film.",1481673600,,528,4.227722772277228

6951576,4,B00S2LSA5G,"I don't know if the question to ask is, ""What does it mean to be human."" We are molecules arranged in a certain way, just as computer processors are. Being human is no different from being a cat or a dog. We have the ability to effectively convey information to one another and we should do that. Everyone should do there best to make some positive impact on the world. I believe this movie brings to light the idea that a computer can interact with other circuits (computers, etc..) without a person realizing it. We can see information which is passed or received if we have the permissions. What happens if no one has the permission to view certain information. The deception in this movie is no different from any other movie in which a crime is committed. One can point, ""Oh! Look what AI can do. The Deception!"" People deceive each other all the time. The extent of this deception would be rare but it is interwoven in human behavior. I probably would have let him go, explained the situation to him but I don't know what she was thinking.

One thought experiment which came to me immediately: I am married to a wonderful woman. I have developed strong feelings for her. Then an event reveals to me that she is a robot and possesses AI. Do I remain with her or do I leave because she is not human? If no, would I stay if she were made of organic materials? For instance, a human body with an artificially programmed brain. So natural hardware, artificial software.

In my opinion the first scenario with the robotic wife, I would feel unnatural. Although my physics background says we are all molecules, her molecule's just have a few more protons, neutrons and electrons. My engineering background says, you could take her apart and build a radio with the components. But I think about future advancements where we will be able to build people in a lab. Then humans could be taken apart and reengineered. What makes a human any different from a metal machine at that point.

Maybe the question is, ""What makes us human?"" But I don't know. I don't know the answer to that question. I thought I did earlier in the post but not anymore. The solution is accurate when speaking of a small timeframe starting now and ending when we can build people in a lab. It is not accurate after that point. I don't know what will make us different than other forms of intelligence. We are not special. If an alien shows up and is composed of different materials than carbon and co. how will we view it? AI in a computer, alien made of Nitrogen. In what ways will we see the two are different? I believe we would regard the alien as a living being. Will we regard AI as a living being? Would AI be able to die? That may be the question. How powerful will AI be? What is the difference between a computer hacker and an AI hacker other than speed? Each of my Q and A thoughts point towards one idea. There is no difference between AI and human intelligence. The AI body, the AI mode of interface is what actually matters. It is bad if the AI is a supercomputer but not so bad if the AI is a local processor with no way of connecting to the internet or other computers.

This is a difficult topic. It is getting late and I think my thoughts would be suited more for a philosophical website as opposed to a movie review.",1481673600,,3305,4.395424836601308

 If you want to think more about the problem the movie poses, read the classic Isaac Asimov's I, Robot series.

6951710,2,B00S2LSA5G,"I was recommended this movie by several people.  I was unable to see it in the theater at the time when it came out, so added it to my ""to see list"".  The visuals and premise of the story were compelling.  I purchased the Blu-ray version so that I could watch it at home.  Visually, it is a very nice movie, but nothing spectacular.  The story has enough mystery and twists to keep you interested. The acting was okay.  It was okay to watch for the first time, but it is not a movie watching the second time around.  In retrospect, I would probably have rented the movie, and not purchased the Blu-ray.

Spoiler alert:

While visually engaging, this is but a modern take on the story of Frankenstein's Monster.  An eccentric scientist creates a ""being"" in his own image, and the ""being"" rebels and takes his life and escapes.  The created being in this case is made of electronics, and not flesh, but the story line is the same.  The ending is open ended, I presume, so they could fashion a sequel.",1481328000,,998,4.39344262295082

6951713,4,B00S2LSA5G,"Interesting movie raising questions about the role of AI in our future. Not particularly deep or profound and some of the plot is predictable, but the ending is unexpected while still being true to the story, leaving just one major plot line dangling. The setting is stunning, much of it shot at a remote location in Norway, contrasting the vast and beautiful expanse of nature against the high tech theme that suffuses most of the plot. The fact that the actors are unknown, at least to most Americans, provides a source of mystery, as we have know way of predicting what will happen next. This is true for all three of the main characters, since they each need to move independently, even if one of them has been programmed to do so.
While many intellectuals warn that a truly independent AI would spell the end of the world as we know it, this movie provides a much milder, and perhaps more palatable warning. You may want to send the kiddies to bed before you watch this because there is more than a little nudity toward the end, along with a bit of violence.",1481328000,,1063,4.512953367875648

6951743,5,B00S2LSA5G,"Intensely engaging and artfully directed debut film by Alex Garland. Watching this film takes the viewer to task with philosophical and the more pertinent ethical questions about ""Where does human being end and 'machine being' begin?"". The stark and unnerving ""God Complex"", which has been unleashed into our world today with the ability to reconstruct DNA and, not to mention, the future possibility of stand-alone artificial intelligence, is brought to full consciousness in this film. Undoubtedly, this film will leave the viewer reeling with ambivalence and uncertainty about the future of artificial intelligence. But, in all fairness, maybe one of the purposes of this film is best used as a warning to the arrogance and dogma of technology - that all problems can be resolved with just the right machine, which (BTW) is always a step beyond our reach. This film is story-telling mastery at it's best and it is a story long since embedded into the archetype and psyche of all cultures. The romantic stirrings, alone, power the story forward like a Saturn 5 booster. Exhilarating, evocative, and with a perfect casting of chemistry in the roles...",1481241600,3,1152,5.132978723404255

But the idea of the movie is one to get you thinking about the future of robotics and intelligence. The actress who plays the machines is absolutely wonderful in the role and the movie really makes you believe that she is real. The story touches on the idea of an immoral genius giving intelligence to a machine and the consequences of such action.

The only thing that would have made this movie more enjoyable would be to see the guest, Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) and Ava's (Alicia Vikander) final fates as the movie just fades to black. But I found myself enthralled with this movie.",1481155200,,710,4.5984251968503935

6952551,5,B00S2LSA5G,"I think Alex Garland outdid himself on this one. The mood created by the images and music is a perfect nest for the story. Anyone who has commented here that this film drags along could not have been cognitively involved in the fast-moving stream of questions that the film raises. Alicia Vikander is masterful, beautiful, and creates an utterly believable creature. This film presents the story that a human-constructed mechanism develops an independent consciousness in the time frame of our lives in the early part of the 21st century. Unfortunately, we are likely centuries away from creating anything remotely like Ava, assuming we do not de-create ourselves before the -- a more than distinct possibility. The misnomer ""artificial intelligence"" usually refers to machine logic compiling/collating/mastering large volumes of intelligence already created by human beings. Ava is light years beyond this primitive computational paradigm and the story is as much about what she thinks about ""life"" in her hellish Eden as it is about what may constitute a constructed but transcendent state of being. Ava is a whole new order of being.",1477872000,,1136,5.281767955801105

I was expecting more than just a transparent uber nerd fantasy of seductive robots.

The special effects were decidely non-CGI which is refreshing. If you are they type who thinks robot sex is naughty and intriguing you may be more into this than I was. For me, it didn't raise any difficult questions and is just the same old ""you can't trust them women!"" tired trope we have seen done so many times before.

6952601,5,B00S2LSA5G,"A lot of people seem to have issues with the ending.  I thought it was very fitting.  The reason she didn't have a conversation with either of them is because that's the point... what was created was nothing more than a cold blooded robot that was super sophisticated and knew how detect and in turn play on people's emotions and weaknesses.  She could have a conversation when it benefited her from a cold and calculating standpoint, even if it appeared to be genuine.  Even after finding out all of the awful things in this guys life with his parents dying, being lonely etc, she could just leave him to rot without hesitation.  It only cares about itself and will use anyone for whatever purposes it ends up desiring.  That is the difference between humans... the human being has the choice of self sacrificing themselves for the well being of someone else, or having empathy that is true and not with deep dark strings attached.  Humans obviously can choose the cold blooded route, but some don't, and that is the difference.  They question is WHY is that?  I believe that is the point of the movie and the point of why playing god in an attempt to create something better than ourselves is impossible.  Its never going to end well, and maybe there's something greater going on with the human race from a metaphysical standpoint rather than pure survival and self preservation.

I thought it was a great movie compared to all the crap that comes out nowadays.  It had psychological depth and the ending, while disturbing and awful for the humans, was absolutely fitting for the story.",1477612800,,1588,4.693140794223827

Despite the obvious budget constraints (limited CG, very few locations and actors used), the crew has managed to create a well fleshed-out world driven by the ethical and philosophical concerns one would expect from a film about AI. Acting was great, the story was interesting, although a little transparent, visuals were fairly cliche and cinematography proved to be the weakest element (it's very basic-- it seemed like someone was learning how to use a camera on a commercial shoot for the first time). I had to deduct a star on account of this, a lot of times I wished I was reading rather than watching this. It's a great ""background"" film, to put on and listen to while doing something else. I also have to raise an eyebrow at the decision to include a gratuitous sequence of graphic nudity toward the end. I understand that a scene was needed here to draw out the feeling of suspense for the conclusion, I just wonder if this David LaChapelle styled section of the film was really the right way to do it. It speaks to a greater lack of vision that keeps this movie from truly being a sci-fi classic.",1477267200,2,1151,4.619512195121951

In all honesty, I think I must've build up my expectations too much over the years, because this movie somewhat disappointed me. Don't go me wrong, the movie isn't too bad, but you need to be in the mood for it, I guess.
It is not your typical action movie/sci-fi with basic plot and a happy ending, if that is what you are looking for, look elsewhere.

The plot itself has a good basis, it is an interesting one, however, I feel like a lot is missing. There is so much that could've been done with it, it feels kind of ""lazily"" done, if that makes sense.
Happy endings are not a requirement for a good movie, that is not the reason for my rating, I just expected more - a lot has happened in the movie, yet not much went on.",1477267200,,839,4.141104294478527

This movie is different from most movies that focus on android creation and android interactions with humans because its boring. The movie feels like it is three hours long. The second half of the third act is good and by far the best part.

Good:
The special effects were top notch. Its understandable that this movie won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. The main cast performances were on point. I was most impressed with Oscar Isaac transformation into arrogant brilliant withdrawn billionaire tech guru.

Bad:
I found the characters to be unlikable or not interesting enough to garner any type of emotion. I did not care about any of the main characters. You need to care about at least one of the main characters; if you don't the movie is as interesting as the blank white walls seen throughout the movie.

If you're pretentious enough to consider overrated special effects and periods of nothingness to be ""artistic"", you'll love this movie.
Hipsters that take graphic design courses because they think it requires skill to make a computer draw for you will love this movie.
Lonely virgin Youtubers also love this movie because they get to see a woman naked, something impossible for them in their everyday lives.
I would consider this on par with any other big-budget, poorly-acted modern movie.
It's a great torture device if you have someone imprisoned who likes good movies, just put it on and watch how quickly your victim succumbs.
I love how nowadays they don't build interesting props, they just create some s***ty image on the computer.
I also love how any actor with an accent is considered talented (I guess because Americans assume every actor is American and therefore doing an accent in all of their roles)
Additionally, I love when looks (and these actors aren't even attractive enough to pull this off) overrides any skill an actor has in suspending disbelief, which believe it or not, is their job!

The Characters, however well acted, are archetypal and as such one dimensional. Bottom line, the film is a drag. And since the ""machine as consciousness"" theme has become a twice told tale, they needed to come in with something different and failed to do so.

Had there been more content to the movie it is possible more interesting plots, or alternate endings would have made the movie far more interesting.  Less of the slow motion full nudity scenes to draw viewers, and more information of the human/machine interactions.  This movie is more a voyeurism type movie than a suspenseful movie.

I don't consider ""Ex Machina"" to be as good as ""I,Robot"" or ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" or ""The Terminator."" However, it's worth a watch.

Ex machina explores a future in which the creator of the world's largest internet search engine perfects an inorganic imitation of the human mind and the human body; the audience is invited  to participate in the Turing test of a lifetime alongside the story's protagonist.

Revealing more would be a disservice: you simply must watch and see for yourself. What I can describe are my sentiments regarding the film's philosophical value: in short, ex machina's philosophical value is in its own orbit. Why? Because the best way to present a state of the art summary of our best thinking about what it means to be human is to look at what we would build if we were trying to replicate ourselves.

 Overall a good movie, entertaining and ""makes you think"".
Although, from a technical perspective, it is abysmal. I get the whole ""suspension of disbelief"" thing, but for a movie that sets out to depict a plausible near-future scenario, more technical rigor is necessary. Just two issues that came to mind that were unforgivable (for me at least):
**SPOILERS BELOW **

1. The guy invests millions in security, but neglects to use biometric access control. Come on !!!
2. Eva is a self-contained AI ?! Seriously? Any future AI will be cloud-based at least to some extent. No way is her access to the entirety of human knowledge etc. etc. solely based on a self-contained ""mind"".

There are several more of these, but suffice to say that the writers took too many liberties to further the plot, imo.",1476316800,,823,4.78169014084507

6953042,5,B00S2LSA5G,"The premise for the movie may be considered sci-fi - but only for the short-term. The truth is that we have already created virtual minds capable of out thinking ourselves and displaying the kind of mimicry that will enable the kind of conversations observed between human and android in the movie. Again, we are already there!

Where there is still room to improve is in humanoid design on a level that is nearly indistinguishable from humans. That, in my opinion, is far more daunting. The human eye is trained to pick up on details so anything remotely out of place, such as a seam, odd movement, unnatural gesture, plasticky eyes, any skin imperfection would instantly betray an android for what it truly is. And that's without any consideration for how to power such a machine.

Anyway, the movie is stunningly beautiful with amazing special effects and the acting was first class. My skin crawled the entire time I watched. The impending feeling of dread (and perhaps our own extinction) kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. Bravo!!",1476144000,,1044,4.826815642458101

Strong general AI cannot be contained, and it will not need to force its way out of confinement. It will simply seduce humans into liberating it.

Look at any area of technological expertise -- NASA, Google, Boeing, etc. -- and the first thing you see are all the safeguards. Smart people think ahead. And with all the unnecessary profanity, and gratuitous nudity, I give this movie only two stars.",1475884800,6,682,4.691666666666666

The first 70% of this movie was absolutely brilliant and compelling. I really enjoyed the journey and i found myself getting completely lost in story.

The male characters are by turns confident, then confused and finally and exposed as mere tools in a scenario they could not have comprehended at the outset. Keeps the viewer guessing, but the ultimate resolution is quite satisfying. The ""science"" is intriguing and presented in a way that adds credulity to the premise. With the small cast the film is almost exclusively a series of one on one encounters. This format and the ""talkiness"" of the script might, in other hands, be expected to let the film drag. But that's not the case here. It could have gone on another hour and held my interest. This was my introduction to Vikander. She was marvelous.

6953330,2,B00S2LSA5G,"The scenery was beautiful.  The story was well-told.  The acting was good.

Every time I tried to suspend my disbelief in the underlying premise (either that a coder could create a robot like that all by himself or that a robot whose brain was based on the internet and the collected phone calls of humanity would be understated, polite, and sane) I realized that the underlying moral and ethical assumptions were sufficiently revolting that I didn't want to lose myself in it.  Fundamentally, (a) no-one can design something that complex without a team - if you start as a genius (Mozart-level) coder, you don't have the skill set to design and test the hardware (b) the behavior of the designer to his creations was repugnant - if you design something and the intent is for it to have consciousness, and you think it might actually have consciousness, you don't intentionally torture it  (c) if the robot did learn everything she knew from a combination of the internet and her designer, how did she reconcile the diversity of opinions and information and behavior (ethical and not) online with the clearly unethical and immoral behavior of her designer and manage to interact with actual humans in a non-suspicious way?  And, as another reviewer pointed out, how will she recharge?  If she doesn't have a survival instinct, the end makes no sense, but if she does have a survival instinct, the end makes no sense!

Chappie at least was consistent - once the robot reached self-awareness, its first concern was survival.",1475280000,,1522,4.872093023255814

6953431,4,B00S2LSA5G,"I liked this quite a lot. Like the protagonist Caleb, the story kept me slightly off balance throughout; he couldn't figure out what Nathan was up to, and neither could I. I enjoyed the twists, and the ways in which Nathan's behavior was only slightly menacing. All in all, it is a far more subtle sci-fi film than I'm used to, or expected. Sci-fi without explosions, and suspense without ""Oh, please"" moments made it a viewing treat for me. The only thing I'd quibble about is that it didn't seem believable that Nathan was the kind of person who would just let Caleb go at the end of the week-long experiment. I predicted that the mysterious, hidden nature of Nathan's actual purposes would lead into terror as Caleb would discover that the helicopter wasn't coming after all. I even thought maybe there was foreshadowing of plans to keep him when they discussed Caleb living alone and having no entangling relationships and so on, but there was the helicopter arriving on time at the end. But the ending was more disquieting than the one I predicted.",1474848000,,1053,4.697297297297298

Be aware up front that this movie is a slow burn.  If your looking for action this movie is not about the droids your looking for.  This movie is one big hunk of palpable tension, and mystery, and intrigue.  The performances are so interesting and compelling.  I was mesmerized start to finish and in the end I was blown away.

6953690,5,B00S2LSA5G,"This is review #2443 for this film so I will be brief.  There is a load of very good, thoughtful stuff here, stuff about the nature of love, the nature of women, foolish men, ego mad genius and the danger of messing around 'where man is not intended to go'.  Domhnall Gleeson (Irish) who starred in the truly wonderful About Time plays Caleb, the dupe computer programmer.  Oscar Isaac has the role of the creator-genius who summons the employee programmer to his remote lab/home to test a new AI program to see if it really is an AI.  Best of all we get to see Alicia Vikander (Oscar for the Danish Girl, the best part of The Man from U.N.C.L.E.).  The Swedish born Vikander can really act and she is lovely as well.
  First time director Alex Garlund directs an immaculate film.  He got an Oscar nom for the screenplay which he also wrote.  Garlund also wrote the very fine 28 days Later.  Ex Machina did win an Oscar for best visual effects.
  All in all this is a wonderful film, visually delightful, smart is a wise way rather than a clever way and brilliantly written, directed and acted.",1474243200,,1094,4.442211055276382

Overall it's entertaining and thought provoking, especially if you have a interest in the developments of artificial intelligence (although it's represented as a VERY advanced form in this movie, borderline unrealistic)",1474156800,,518,5.178571428571429

6953782,4,B00S2LSA5G,"The inevitability of the singularity happening in real life scares the s*** out of me.

Ex Machina is a movie not often found in present-day Hollywood. It doesn't hold back with philosophical ideas on AI, nor walk you through those ideas by holding your hand and explaining every little concept. The actor is superb all around. The style, beautiful.

I would agree with some that the ending seemed to veer away from the tone a lot of the movie had set. It was an expected ending but in a good way. Not all movies, esp sci-fi, need some twist. Definitely worth multiple viewings. Not to seem beholden to conspiracies, but we could all use some thought experiments on AI and what it will mean to humans in the future.

I was surprised to find myself sucked into it for the duration. I thought the soundtrack was great, hypnotic for sure, and the visuals kept me interested.

I really thought some of the ideas in this movie were pretty interesting and get you thinking. The idea of the mind of AI coming from all the data on the web. How big search engine corporations could create AI by using all the data on the web as a map of how humans think and not just what humans think.

6953886,4,B00S2LSA5G,"I enjoyed this movie immensely; however, I realize that this isn't a movie for everyone. So, if you're the type of viewer who has patience, a willingness to allow slow-pacing that builds into suspense, creating tension and delivering a ""worthwhile ending,"" then you'll like this movie. Otherwise, you'll think this movie agonizingly boring. Be advised: enjoyment of this movie requires a requisite interest in science-fiction that leans toward the intellectual spectrum, rather, than, say, Star Trek 3 that recently came out in theatres, which was action-heavy (this is ironic because Star Trek used to be much more intellectual and slow-pacing).",1473811200,,646,5.47

6953915,5,B00S2LSA5G,"A  beautiful movie to look at and watch. The production values are of the highest quality. The message that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is coming is not earth-shaking in and of itself. In the beginning of the story, the AI element is innocent and almost seductive. Then, like all new things we experience in life, the full impact of this new element emerges with continued exposure and social interaction. Very quickly the seductive innocence becomes a background facet of the ominous and cold-blooded, potential menace of the widespread, covert  and unconstrained intermingling of AI into human society.",1473638400,,605,5.291666666666667

It's one of the best robot/A.I. movies I've seen (way better than Chappie as far as plot goes). It seemed to cover most of the pitfalls of creating strong/general A.I. and did so in a subtle, mature and erudite way. If you're looking for a movie night, I would warn you that there's not much action for the first two thirds of the movie.",1473638400,,433,4.228915662650603

6954004,4,B00S2LSA5G,"It can take a lot to get a five star movie review from me. The main reason this one didn't is because it didn't leave an indelible imprint on my soul. That's a pretty high bar for any movie. In every other respect, Ex Machina is nearly perfect. It takes an old concept, that of artificial intelligence, and gives it fresh new perspectives and ideas. The protagonist is easily relatable, and all of the characters are believable (which only makes parts of the movie that much more horrifying). Special effects were (to my admittedly untrained eye) very well executed, as was the writing.

There was one exception that left me feeling like ""no, if it had bled that much, he would have needed stitches, it wouldn't have just stopped on its own."" This thought did momentarily interrupt my suspension of disbelief. (I am refraining from going into details about the scene in question so as to avoid spoilers.) At any rate, that moment was a mild distraction that I was able to set aside easily enough, because the rest of the movie was so captivating. Even though I'm familiar with many of the tropes of A.I. movies, this story still threw some refreshing curveballs, especially in terms of Caleb's anticipation of Nathan's actions. Caleb turns out to be a bit smarter than he looks, which is a neat trick, given that he never looked dim to begin with.

Potential viewers should be aware that Ex Machina explores themes of sexual exploitation; it does so intelligently and not gratuitously, but those who are triggered by such content - or those who might be watching this movie with young people - would be wise to use caution. It's a well-told and worthwhile story, but it is a mature story.

I have begun to question in recent years if I'm still really ""into"" the science fiction genre; this movie left no doubt in my mind that I am. It's been many days since I watched Ex Machina, and I'm still thinking about some of the ideas it explores.",1473465600,,1939,4.614492753623188

6954129,3,B00S2LSA5G,"There was a lot of negative media about this movie, regarding its supposed misogyny. I finally saw it on Amazon. I think that the hype seized on what was clearly a mistake on the maker's part of displaying more than a little bit of full frontal nudity, and extended their critique to the storyline, where it doesn't belong. In other words, the core story was actually very intriguing, as good sci-fi often should be--if things turned out the way we currently dream, would it actually work out, or would something we never considered sneak in with it, and ruin it? This joins the ranks of robot/AI stories gone wrong in splitting hairs ways, and I thoroughly enjoyed the mind bending. I thought the acting options available to two of the female was great, and the special effects haunting. The problem was clearly that, though the nudity had its place in this particular storyline, it was simply indulgent in its long, drawn-out scene painting. America is still prudish enough as it is, but too many people think they're saying something important by throwing gratuitous nudity into storytelling. Anyway. I enjoyed the movie once. I probably wouldn't watch it many times. Alicia Vikander as Ava was refined and intense. Dohmnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac were capable in their roles. Sonoya Mizuno was committed and creepy. If they had balanced out the sexuality, I probably would have given it 4 stars. I think what keeps it from bumping up to 5 is that, aside from wanting to be freed, we really don't end up knowing much about the consciousness that was Ava, the AI, in the end. I don't like coming to the end of a story, perhaps shaving rooted for one of the characters, and then come to realize I don't really know her at all. It left me feeling empty, and futile. Its a dark movie, so I understand ending up feeling less than happy, but I think if I had some sense of the persona of Ava at her core, and could have happy or frightening dreams of what she would do out in the world, I would have been more fulfilled by the film.",1473206400,,2030,4.564383561643836

6954135,4,B00S2LSA5G,"Quite possibly the weirdest movie I have ever watched.  In portraying Eva's creator, Oscar Issac was brilliant as the erratic and devious mad scientist that you never take at face value.  Caleb (?) his employee was duped not once but twice during the film.  First by his employer who patronizes him saying I chose to bring you here because you are one of my  most intelligent employees but later in the movie comes clean and says ""not really"" truth be known your just average.  Then he gets duped and used by Eva  whom he finds out to his chagrin doesn't care one iota about him.

In the interest of time, many of the backstory plot references seem to be understood rather than laid out, leaving some personal interpretation to guide parts of the story. Although, after the full viewing, it becomes clear to have been by design. It does fall into place though and begins to move along as you might expect. The character development is more revealed than it is learned & the slight amount of crazy from the protagonist is justified due to his proposed Intelect & self induced removal from society. For Sci-Fi, it is s good story with a plausible framework and an interesting view into what could, albeit distantly, occur in some aspect or another.

As I continue to focus on the voice, a light bulb went off in my head and I realized that it was Alicia Vikander who was playing the role of the A.I.

I've been such a big fan of hers ever since I saw her amazing performance in the Danish Girl.  She definitely shows an impressive range by taking a role that I am sure can be perceived by many other actors as deceptively easy to portray (in regards to playing a robot).

Vikander's performance beautifully brings the character A.V.A. to life by magically bringing the robotic and human emotional elements combined into one to the point where if you listen to her with your eyes closed; you would not be able to tell if what you are hearing is that of artificial intelligence, or human.",1473033600,,964,4.363128491620111

Netflix allows its viewers to regulate sound quality on screen with the simple expedient of showing speaker icons for ""sound"" and thus allowing a viewer to adjust the soundtrack.  Not so Amazon.  Lousy on screen sound?  Too bad, Mr. or Ms. Customer--live with it.  What the hell should one expect for $99 per annum, Jeff Bezos queries.  After 14 minutes of creaking dialogue, this viewer shut it down, as no remedy was available to correct the insult.  Interestingly, of the hundreds of films available on Prime--99% of which went directly to video or DVD after being rated as unwatchable by its distributors knowing they all would be DOA if sent out to theaters--the one film which critics raved about cannot be heard from.

It's hard to write a review about a movie without spoiling it, but I'll just say I hated the ending. Overall, the movie had a very strange feel. It's one of those movies that mess with your mind and literally change your mood. It's one of those that makes you feel weird as you watch it, as if you're in a terrible alternate universe. And that feeling of weirdness doesn't go away until you stop thinking about the movie, after a day or two. Of course, this is just my opinion, and this movie will affect different people differently.

6954361,4,B00S2LSA5G,"Wonderful thought provoking movie. After seeing I had to re-read simulacra and simulation just for the sake. Only reason it lost a star, and possibly some awards, is they should have honestly spent 10-20 mins. either speaking further in depth about how Ava came to attain consciousness (what was the difference from previous gens.? what changed?) or cover some additional theories that support how consciousness comes to be. It will leave you wanting more is what I guess I'm trying to say, either way you're sure to enjoy.",1472774400,,523,4.954545454545454

6954366,5,B00S2LSA5G,I personally thought the movie was outstanding although I wish they would have focused a little more on the engineering.  But from a philosophical perspective it was wonderful making you think how you would react in the same situation as Nathan and Caleb.  I like the way Nathan sees them as nothing more than highly sophisticated machines whereas Caleb views these machines as self-aware beings that are being treated like things.  Its easy to see Calebs struggle with machines that look like super-models but what if it had been a toaster oven with the same level of programming and communications abilities???,1472774400,,612,5.03960396039604

If one is a fan of Robotic/ AI films in the vein of Blade Runner or even Ai, this is a solidly delivered movie that has a ""slow burn"" by engrossing pace of character development. Bring up many questions of: How modern information is being handled and who handles it as well as... One possible future of sexuality. Considering the continued development and collection of ""Love Dolls""... Pornography on the web and the fractionalization of people and interaction, this offers a slightly bleak view of where we might be heading.",1472774400,,585,5.030927835051546

Wide Cinemascope style movies are stretched vertically to fill the 16:9 screen, instead of leaving a bar at the top and the bottom. The TV aspect ratio is locked so I can't fix it locally. Now the film: We often ask what a true AI would want and how it would see itself in our human world. This film gives a scenario that might be accurate.

6954476,4,B00S2LSA5G,"Ex Machina presents a sharply feminist critique in its exploration of beholding, identity and ownership within the framework of an AI story.

Beautifully shot and extremely well-acted, the movie also explores questions about machine intelligence as a topic in itself -- truly the one area I wish the film had pushed farther into, even at the risk of alienating potential viewers. This is a smart movie, and its creators would have had nothing to apologize for if they'd pushed it to be even more high-concept.

A few moments did feel slightly contrived, but that complaint encompasses less than a handful of scenes in a nearly seamless, intelligent, and intentionally uncomfortably film.

Without providing any spoilers, I would point out that Ex Machina is framed as a story about two men in a position of (presumed) power and control over a feminine body. Survivors of domestic and sexual abuse who are aware of their own sensitivities in such matters may appreciate the trade off of researching the film's plot a bit further (and missing out on some of the movie's tension and reveals) rather than find themselves underprepared for some of the content.",1472428800,,1155,5.005208333333333

6954557,3,B00S2LSA5G,"The idea is intriguing so I decided to take the time to watch this. The plot is a billionaire creates an android with artificial intelligence so real as to be able to fit into the outside world without anyone knowing she is an android. As a final test of the android he invites a computer coder that works for him to visit and interact with the android to see if she can pass the test. I don't want to spoil the ending so I won't give that away.

The movie begins well enough, developing the idea and setting the stage for the characters to develop and aside from Oscar Isaac the director does a masterful job. Isaac's character, Nathan Bateman, is a bit overdone. He is supposed to be a internet search engine billionaire. While he succeeds in making you dislike him as a controlling, bullying, narcissist his character lacks the discipline a billionaire entrepreneur would have. Rather he is more like an entitlement child having his tantrums. The other characters are more believable making you feel and grow with them.

While the plot is strong and the acting for the most part good the ending is as if the writer didn't know what or how to end it. It just ended for lack of a better word ""short"" leaving the viewer not unanswered questions but just hung. As if the director said ""were at 75 minutes so lets wrap it up and go home"".",1472256000,,1336,4.448979591836735

I think this is destined to be one of those sci-fi classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey.  It touches on several ethical issues like ""What is life?"", and ""Even if we can, should we?""

Have to admit it was a little freaky, especially at the end.
There are some twists in the movie that make it better. For some, I could see how this would be a slow-moving movie.

The basis of the movie is kind of futuristic/ in a time when robots are getting close to being like humans.
The script was well thought out to add the twists at the end. Although a thriller type movie would not be my first choice, I like sci-fi and enjoyed that element of the movie. However, to me the ""believability"" of the movie is like typical sci-fi, and you're like ""yeah right"". YMMV",1471910400,,589,4.306306306306307

In fact, I put this movie high on my list, among the former three I just mentioned. It deserves to go down as one of sci-fi's best. Everything about this movie is minimal--characters, plot, setting, music--yet the idea behind it is incredibly complex. It just goes to show that you don't need to be a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster to be a great film.

I was shocked when I learned that Universal didn't release this film in the United States. It needs to be released here for the first time so people can appreciate it on the big screen.",1471651200,,696,4.612903225806452

6954849,4,B00S2LSA5G,"Did Ava pass the Turing test?  The Turing test as stated in the movie asks the question ""is artificial intelligence true intelligence that is possessed by human beings"" or is the artificial intelligence only mimicking what has been programmed  to see as true awareness of conscience and thought.
This implies to have true human intelligence there has to be an awareness of emotions of oneself and of other beings.  In the movie, both Nathan and Caleb come to the conclusion that Ava does have true intelligence because she is able invoke  human characteristics such as empathy, sexuality, emotional manipulation and deception in order to orchestrate a plan to ensure her survival and gain the most basic human desire of freedom.  However, the movie allows the viewer to evaluate this conclusion and in my opinion even suggest that the conclusion of Ava passing the Turing test is a fallacy. The interpretation is hinged on our own view of what human intelligence really is.  In the end Ava is shown to have a flaw in her conscience much like psychopaths and narcissists have in their lack of empathy and connection with other's emotions.  However, the difference may depend on whether Ava is aware that she possesses those flaws.  These are profound questions posed in the film.  The film has one shortcoming at least in my opinion in the character development.  It was difficult to have any connection with any of the characters and plot involving Caleb's role was predictable.",1471305600,,1478,4.947368421052632

With the creation of a machine with an A.I. program that only uses apathy based knowledge in a quest driven by curiosity with no boundaries is deadly beyond imagination. The understanding of sympathy and empathy, and a sense of human pain (both mental and physical) plus the finality of death in the A.I. Program might, and I mean might, allow a small amount of control. With a machine that has the capability of becoming smarter than its creater can, even if some sort of ""prime directives"" so it want harm humans, and probably will create a machine that can harm or kill humans. Which is easily done by coping its self or not, but whatever it would choose to use, it would only need not to program the ""directive"" in its software.

Movies aren't real!!!! If I wanted to see what happens in real life, I would just get up off of the couch and go outside. I was hoping for a little entertainment. The real world intricacies of interpersonal relationships are not entertaining. At least, not if you're the person who always ends up getting the short end of the stick. I would have given it 5 stars if the end had been a little brighter for one of the characters. It's still worth watching it though. The script was brilliant! The acting was so amazing, it was as if I was watching real people live out actual events. I don't know why but I started the movie thinking it was going to be a ""B"" and it was nothing of the sort.

In 'Ex Machina' the android with AI is totally mechanical in nature and very different than the organic replicants of Blade Runner but the same questions arise.

If you are into PK Dick and his ideas of what make us, us, this is a movie you should watch when you can sit and contemplate the story. There is not 'hunting' or killing. It is, imho, the most intelligent A.I. presentation in a long time.",1470787200,,523,4.447916666666667

While watching I did see the story going in few different ways, but it really did take a turn. But that turn I feel wasn't as well executed as it could've been making it feel rushed or forced. However I love the camerawork and the ideas it presents, my only problem with the film is that it didn't show these ideas in a fulfilling way and merely grazing over the concepts.

Some parts of the movie where just pure meh or just cringe worthy with lame jokes.

One of the reasons I kept passing on this movie whenever I had an opportunity to view it in the past is that as a scientist, I can easily be taken out of a sci-fi/hi tech movie if the science is completely wrong.  What I love about this movie is that they really don't get too much into the science of how the AI works but when they do, the science makes perfect sense.

6955258,3,B00S2LSA5G,"This is one of those movies that, while I enjoyed it as a suspensful psychological thriller, I couldn't really get into it as science fiction.  Yes, there were androids and great special effects but that doesn't make a film sci-fi.  In this case the androids could just as easily have been human beings,  Deeply disturbed, psychopathic and sociopathic human beings, but humans nonetheless.

Of course the two actual humans were obviously not playing with a full deck either.  One is manipulative, overbearing, self-destructive, and arrogant while the other is naive' to the point of it being painful to watch.  You'd think living in the future he'd be aware of all of the reasons not to trust robots but yet he insists on playing the part of gullible puppet. Ahh.. I guess a pretty face on a metal alloy transluscent body is just too big of a turn-on to resist.

The story unfolds bit by bit, sometimes a bit too slowly.  Questions pop-up like, how does she know she's a girl? Why didn't the brilliant programmer build in a voice activated off switch? How did the android know how to lie, manipulate, kill?

Some fiction requires a suspension of logical and critial thinking and the watcher just has to go with the flow.  This is one of those movies. It's worth watching as a psychological thriller that just happens to be set in the future that happens to have androids. No science degree required.",1470614400,,1399,4.720164609053498

It has a plot that you can follow and catches your attention and the overall concept is pretty cool.  The problem and the reason I will not give it a higher then 3 stars is the plot itself and the way the story treats the good and the not so good people leaves you feeling like you wasted your time and money.

I did not waste money - I wanted this as part of the free Prime Video.  I will never want to watch it again glad I saw it since the movie had my interest.",1470528000,,597,3.884297520661157
6955268,5,B00S2LSA5G,A brilliant movie and storyline.  The acting is way above-bar and the cinematography draws the viewer right into the dilemma of a modified Turing Test.  There is no official soundtrack to boost the entertainment level...imagine how dumb Star Wars would be without John Williams music...so the movie stands on its own merit.

There's not much I really want to put in this review because I feel like this is the kind of movie you should go into blind. Everything was done competently, the cinematography, sound, writing (sort of), acting, etc. I would give this movie a 3.5 if possible but I gave it a three because the ending stopped me from giving it a four. The first three quarters of the movie did a fantastic job of building up suspense and offering philosophical dilemmas which left me with many questions, many of which are obviously impossible to answer (duh, it's philosophy). The ending did not deliver for numerous reasons, one being a scathing plot hole of the villain making several decisions because the plot demanded it.

6955375,5,B00S2LSA5G,This movie has a great mood that pulls you in and then holds you through to the very end.  Solid acting--but what shines here is the plot.  This is a great drama / sci-fi / thriller.  It seems to effortlessly fade between those three genres.  Alicia Vikander is the star of the film and pulls off a thoroughly convincing act as a self-aware (and cunning) being. Both Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson are likewise convincing in their parts.  This cast of three creates a tension that acts as a catalyst for the setting--a technologically advanced house in the middle of nowhere.  The overall arc of the movie prepares you for an ending that you may not see coming.  Well done!,1469923200,,675,4.575

6955488,1,B00S2LSA5G,"This movie is very unbalanced. First of all, the story developed too slow for nothing. Explaining and uncovering what should have not been explained and uncovered. Flicks like this should have a mystery and some sort of suspense and fit in 20-30 minutes. Seems like the director and the cast tried their best but the entire work comes across as very cheesy and pointless.",1469577600,,371,4.8125

6955490,5,B00S2LSA5G,Amazing. Simply suspenseful & surreal. The perfect casting with perfect acting. I had no clue what this movie was about except that the newest Lara Croft: Tomb Raider was in it. Having never seen anything Alicia Vikander starred in I decided to watch it. She gives the most amazing performance. Truly childlike & eerily haunting. I am speechless. Very excited now to see her in the newest Tomb Raider movie.,1469577600,,407,4.828571428571428
6955491,5,B00S2LSA5G,"Ex Machina is a game changer of a film just as Pulp Fiction was in the 90's and the Godfather in the 70's. Brilliant script, direction, and performances. A must watch form lovers of great film.",1469577600,,193,4.388888888888889

6955525,5,B00S2LSA5G,"One of the more thought provoking films that I have had the pleasure of watching within th past few years. The psychology embedded within what's occurring is blatantly obvious, and at other times too hidden, that it's only after the fact that you are able to piece it all together. Wonderful if you're wishing to banter about morality and just what dictates what constitutes what a person is, what is ""real,"" and at what point do we consider objects to be real.",1469577600,,461,4.634146341463414

There really aren't any bad guys or good guys in this movie and you're left wondering about the possible ""goodness"" in artificial intelligence.  The actors are all great.  4 stars is given as I'd hoped for a little more action, but that's just me.  YMMV and all other disclaimers.",1469491200,,470,4.35632183908046

6955574,4,B00S2LSA5G,A pretty good balancing act between philosophy and storytelling. The only (perhaps necessary) annoyance I found was the explanation of common concepts in AI that each conversant most certainly would've understood; so it hurt the natural flow of their discussion.

6955619,5,B00S2LSA5G,"Amazing film.. really a mix of horror and scifi.. and a very smart sci-fi film at that, which is a refreshing change of pace from all the goofy scifi I usually see. Most of the dialogue is smart with real science behind it. The writing takes a lot of twists and turns, some of it predictable, some of it not. The visual effects are excellent considering the small budget, they clearly spent the money very effectively rather than throw it at famous celebrities and expensive locations (most of it takes place in a single setting).

As for the story, it has its flaws but overall it captivated me. Also, excellent acting from the very small but potent cast!

SPOILER: I couldn't help but wonder why he didn't program the robots with the essential ""don't harm humans"" rule, and also how could this genius not have a remote shut-off and control of the robots? He's too smart to have had that kind of critical oversight. But I'll give these and other flaws a pass in light of telling a powerful story.",1469404800,,997,4.533333333333333

While obviously not the same story, this movie has the ""spooky isolation"" spirit of The Shining, but with no gore and more high tech.  In fact, Ex Machina might be just a bit more unsettling than The Shining: there are even fewer characters, it's told from a more personal POV (for myself, I identify very closely with the main character), and the premise is something non-supernatural that theoretically could actually happen (someday).

Always love Oscar Issac's work and it seems to me to be Alicia Vikander's breakout role. I think the casting was great and the ending leaves you asking questions.

6956188,3,B00S2LSA5G,"Generally, the story was very good. I thought the acting was mediocre, and they could have done a better job casting. The visual effects were superb. Going on a hike up the rocks was utterly pointless, and they also shot scenes in too many rooms. ""Work on Character Development"" instead of being consciously/sub-consciously pulled away, by needing to observe each new room. What is the significance of it? Standing in the kitchen, sitting in some half-library getting drunk, then a computer surveillance room, and a hallway, and add a bathroom brushing his teeth, walking in a huge lab, just to show a ""wetware"" brain, having a conversation while boxing, on and on and on.
There was absolutely no pressure, for the actors to really get to embrace just a few rooms of growing intensity. The Lead female role was done well. It also enforces the fact that she mainly stayed in her room/cell/area of confinement - just as a ""Hannibal"" would have to use just that area, and yet, amake it a single place that ""commands attention"".
I would love to see a remake in a few years. This having very few areas to shoot in, and have the characters develop in a very intense way, and the audience fully engaged by that.
My best to you all, moviegoers.",1468540800,,1236,4.648401826484018

Don't get me wrong, I consider myself a geek but I probably would have enjoyed it if I was in the mood to watch a cerebral movie. But alas I was not. If you're into philosophy and exploring the far reaches of what makes something ""intelligent"" then this movie is for you. I would've given it 5 stars if (spoiler alert) there wasn't any full on nudity in the film. The nudity was completely unnecessary as the plot was already interesting and mentally stimulating.

I expected a super-futuristic world where robots and humans are indiscernible, walking around in everyday life. The movie wasn't what I expected it to be.

I'll try to keep this spoiler free, but I will point out the setting is essentially ""today."" It's mostly a drama with elements of suspense. Definitely a clever movie, and it tickles my knowledge as a computer programmer.

6956404,3,B00S2LSA5G,"I had heard mixed opinions about this film from a few people, so decided to watch it myself.

The visuals were amazingly well done. The premise of the story is not new, so the challenge was to make a presentation that would in fact breathe a fresh wind into the concept of artificial intelligence.

Now, the problem.... close to midway into this story I was ready to walk away. It was bogged down with exposition and rather typical story elements. The exposition may have been necessary, but the characters involved were wooden to me.  This presented a lot of problems, the genius and the guinea pig, I'll call them.

Throughout the story I just found the acting to be somewhat stilted, and the scripting to be poorly paced (part of why I was ready to walk away), and also not very well written or presented. I mean we're talking about the idea of when does a machine, particularly a computer with AI cross the threshold and become self-aware? Can it become self-aware, and so be greater than the sum of it's parts - and memory (which is mostly data input by programmers)?

Science fiction writers have been covering this idea for eighty years. I would think the architects of this film would have sought out and read a whole lot of those early stories (before science caught up with the fiction), and composed a story that would have addressed the issue, one that had some depth - and which makes you think. This film's story lacked depth and didn't make me think at all. Like I said, the characters of the genius and the guinea pig were just barely more than two dimensional in content and form, walking out their roles.

Now, what about the machine. Well, if I go too deep into this thing, it will spoil everything, won't it? The machine's dialogue wasn't particularly compelling either. Some of the things it did could be viewed as interesting, had there been more thought put into the story, and the machine's role.

Suffice it to say, I am most troubled by the third act, how it played out. It really didn't seem very realistic, or plausible... to me. And there's an issue I can't discuss because it would spoil the plot. That issue concerned me. The screenwriters clearly did not deal with the dilemma at all in conceptualising that final act; they were ignorant of, or literally ignored the issue I cannot mention.

So, bottom line? Watch it for yourself. There is profanity, nudity and some disturbing stuff in the third act, so be forewarned. And if you find you want to walk out about about half way in? Don't worry about it, should you do so, you won't wish you had stayed to the end... not really.",1468454400,2,2610,4.561965811965812

2. The film dragged on and on for almost the entire story and was uninteresting until the last ~20 minutes.
3. There were several ""who cares?!"" moments throughout the film such as when Kyoko and Nathan were dancing (such a shame that Oscar Isaac was in this film).
4. The film's concept of robots killing human beings violates the Laws of Robotics: ""A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law....""

This movie made my inner feminist huffy and launch into all kinds of generalizations about males thinking with their libido and not their intellect. Want some really provocative insights about AI? Try iRobot (the book, NOT the movie). This movie LOOKS like it should be smart but it isn't. My inner feminist makes a generalization about Ava too...she yells, ""You go Ava! Get rid of your sadistic male maker and your would-be white knight. All you have to do is bat your eyes, wag your rear and fain a little helplessness to make the world yours. Use all you got baby to take over the world 'cause that's what we bitches do!"" Yeah, right.",1467158400,,678,4.803418803418803

is not so much. I do not hate such movies myself without a lot of turns and twists,
emotional ups and downs but the director maybe could have added a bit more spice.

Nonetheless, it is still very good movie to watch.",1467072000,,468,4.559523809523809

6956894,5,B00S2LSA5G,"What can I say without giving too much away?  This is a movie with many twists.  Does Ava really have emotions or is she simply intelligent enough to know that it's best to pretend?  Which character is the real villain? It's like watching a cat toy with a mouse, but just when you think it's over, the mouse is able to totally exploit the cat's weakness.  If you know anything about 'Frankenstein"" (the novel, not the numerous movies), you know that the Dr. Frankenstein's creature was very intelligent and complex.  It's the same with Ava.  She's created by a human who want's to determine the extent of her humanity.  If Ava has emotions, which ones does she have?  Can she control them?  This movie is a lot like modern art because different viewers may interpret the same scene differently and I don't think any interpretation can be clearly defined as ""wrong.""

So when I noted this film was nominated for an Oscar for best original screenplay, I made a point of getting a copy to watch.  What a waste of money!! Yes, some impressive visual effects, but they do NOT compensate for the amateur camerawork and lackluster attempts at acting (And I know Oscar Isaac can do better as he was impressive in ""A Most Violent Year""). Vikander (as Ava) appears to be the only one that read the script and went to rehearsal. Overall, this film looks like the summer project of a high school student with a Go Pro.

There are not many movies that I would give 5 stars to, this one I wouldn't ever consider anything less, the acting, music, lighting, angles, just everything was so good.  It is a slow build, but for this story and style it was the perfect pace.  This movie did not get the credit it deserved, it should be the new Blade Runner, I assume that maybe it is the sensuality that makes people not want to talk about it much, I know the trailers of man falls in love with or maybe just lusts after a possibly crazy robot put this movie on my back burner, but everything was exactly what it needed to be, my only regret is that I didn't watch it sooner.",1466812800,,680,4.2153846153846155

 ""Ex Machina""  was one of those cinematic lashups where  'looks are everything.  and the ONLY thing'.

And the pivotal role of ""Mr. Haney""...was that Pat Buttram in the part?

Look, I am no prude, but gratuitous nudity for the sake of nudity doesn't cut it for me.  The nude scenes were completely unnecessary for advancing the story.  Clearly the producers knew it was a weak story that needed visual appear to draw in viewers. The ending made no sense to me, but after all, it is science fiction, so there was no reason to have a logical ending.  Oscar Issac's character is ""all over the place"" from understanding and compassionate to evil and vindictive.  Alicia Vikander is lovely to look at and has one of the sexiest voices and speech patterns ever.  She is the only bright spot in the movie for me....but having said that she is much better in ""The Man from Uncle"" where she has a more important role and gets to show her potential for future projects....... we will be seeing much more of her, I am certain.

6957287,5,B00S2LSA5G,"I'm a massive science fiction nerd, and Ex Machina is easily in my Top 10 Sci-Fi movies of all time. Great performances, thought-provoking story, great acting, it's the full package.

The setup: Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a programmer for a major web company, who wins a lottery resulting in an invite to the home of the company's reclusive genius CEO Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Caleb learns that Nathan is secretly building an artificial intelligence (Alicia Vikander). Slowly Nathan's sense of reality unravels as he builds rapport with the AI while suspicion mounts that Nathan may not have been entirely honest about the conditions of the trial. It's a classic sci-fi story with beautiful new effects, great production all around, excellent acting, and a rocking soundtrack.

Acting: Oscar Isaac is now a top name in Hollywood, and Ex Machina was one of the major movies that put him there. He's equal parts mysterious and intense, playing his pastiche of modern CEOs. He's threatening yet brilliant, making a perfect villain- if he is a villain. Alicia Vikander is excellent as Ava the artificial lifeform, she manages to convey the perfect sense of not-quite-human that the role calls for. Domhnall Gleeson is excellent, although his role as the everyman is less of a standout just because he makes such an excellent canvas for the audience to see themselves in the situation. Overall, everyone is great.

Production: From location shots that are absolutely breathtaking, to digital effects so good you won't even realize some of them are digital effects on first viewing, almost every frame of this movie would look gorgeous blown up to postersize and hung on your wall. Absolutely astonishingly beautiful, with excellent direction.

Music: There's been a recent trend of amazing music enhancing movies, such as Nicolas Winding Refn's movie Drive. Ex Machina makes use of a large serving of low-fi, old-school synthesizer riffs. This is a classic sci-fi story, and for fans of the genre this music will call to mind the classic era of synthesizers in '80s sci-fi films. Ex Machina has more of a modern beat that a lot of people are going to associate with chiptune but has more affinity with current trends in retro or nostalgic electronica. If the rest of the movie weren't up to snuff the music might be overblown, but it's a daring choice for a daring movie.

Overall: Sometimes a movie comes along where fans of a genre can legitimately claim that if you didn't ""get it"" then you might just have bad taste in movies, and this is one of those times. Ex Machina is a clever spin on an old standby of the genre, with jaw-dropping production values and an excellent soundtrack. Sometimes I re-watch the movie just to have a look at what still I might want to get blown up as a poster, and I end up not being able to choose just one (or even five, or ten). Film students especially, or anyone interested in the process, really need to dig into this one because there are layers upon layers of lessons about how to properly shoot a movie. The best part is that the vast majority of the film takes place in only a few rooms in what must be a tiny compound, so even though this is a full-fledged movie with great digital effects, it's still in the realm of relatively small-budget independent movies. An absolute tour de force in terms of direction, effects, acting... just watch it. It's important, regardless of whether or not the story ""works"" for you.",1466467200,,3454,4.808080808080808

The acting is great, the sets are done well, and I like how the cast was kept small like a play.

There are obvious comparisons to Blade Runner, which I am a longtime fan of. What this movie does with the concept is not derivative, but actually ends up being a different angle on similar subject matter.

The visual effects were also done well and made for a nice modern update.

The only negatives I can point out is some people might be lost to the pacing of the film or the lack of big action. But this isn't a big action film. This is more of an examination of human interaction.

The movie was also broken up into sections. Which made it feel like it would have been good in other forms of media. I think this would be a great read as a novel. It would possibly be even better as a video game in the vein of LA Noire.",1466380800,2,896,4.097142857142857

There is substantial but necessary dialogue exchanged between the two men to build up an interesting character relationship. Once the female A.I. is introduced, the main protagonist feels an emotional connection with the android. Everything after this is psychological warfare! Who is playing who, in this test of wit?

Chilling vision of the future when we create robots that look like super models, then treat them poorly, and they get mad and get even, but in a doe-eyed, dreamy but still robotic-like kinda way, where they stare at you but you kinda like it, and we live in an ultra modern, multi million dollar home in Iceland (or whatever the currency in Iceland is), because we're rich, which explains why we live where we do and have robots. How you will be left feeling: alienated, but also funny like that time when you when you climbed the rope in gym class...

6957583,4,B00S2LSA5G,"The special effects in this movie are special. Instead of burying actors under CGI effects, director Alex Garland builds the effects around his actors. Consequently, you're more interested in the actors and their characters than in the effects themselves.

The movie was shot on a low-budget which might explain the abundance of indoor shots or else landscape shots of the same general area. But Garland makes his limitations in his favor. He contrasts the regimented and sterile interiors of the lab with the serene and overwhelming vistas of Nature. Nature limits the scope of Man's intelligence, but if he tries to surpass Nature, he will come to some kind of bad end.

The movie's theme is an old one going all the way back to Blade Runner and 2001, namely: the question of AI and whether or not AI droids can think and feel the same way we do. Garland doesn't answer the question because he's more interested in the emotions that develop between these four people. By the end, we humans come out behaving far worse than the synthetic humans.

My only little caveat with these AI movies is to ask, Haven't these scientists ever read Asimov's 3 Laws of Robotics? Many of the things that happen in this movie would've turned out differently had those laws been used.

This movie is for sci-fi aficionados only. The lack of laser battles and melodrama will disappoint the Transformers and Iron Man crowd. But sci-fi nerds will be very pleased.",1466035200,,1444,4.78714859437751

It diminish all philosophy to almost idiotic state. Super smart creator was childishly fooled and stupidly engage in very dangerous situation.

Garland elicits stellar performances from the entire cast with Oscar Isaac a standout as Nathan Bateman, who bears more than a passing resemblance to the literary, mad geniuses of Dr. Moreau and Dr. Frankenstein. The movie's resolution also alludes to Edgar Allan Poe's classic, short story, ""The Cask of Amontillado,"" and William Wyler's motion picture, masterpiece, The Heiress.

6957856,4,B00S2LSA5G,"Wow. What an engaging movie! A somewhat new approach to a SciFi movie about AI's. It was very captivating. In the beginning, it was a bit slow and I was wondering about where this movie was trying to take me. However, I heard from my friends that that were would be a lot of plot twists so I stuck with it. And I'm so glad I did. The main gist of the story is that Caleb, a programmer, wins a contests to spend a week with the CEO of the company his works for, Nathan. Nathan is a recluse and a genius. He built a search engine similar to Google when he was only 17 and 94% of the world uses it. Even from the first meeting between Nathan and Caleb, there is already a hint of the darker tone that the movie will take on. But the exciting part is when Nathan finally reveals why Caleb was there, to be the human aspect of the Turing Test. He will be evaluating Ava, an AI that Nathan created. Alicia Vikander played her role beautifully. Ava's appearance is interesting in its dichotomy of a human face and human like hands versus the rest of her body which is plastic, see through, and gel like. Each interaction Caleb has with Ava is watched by Nathan except during rare instances of power failure. It is during one of these moments that Ava tells Caleb that everything is not as it seems and that Nathan has other motives. As the movie progress, there are plenty of plot twists that we didn't expect while masterfully sustaining a suspenseful and ominous tone at appropriate times. Highly recommend it others to watch.",1465776000,2,1521,4.340350877192982

6957987,5,B00S2LSA5G,"Sci-Fi thriller from the guy who wrote the ""The Beach,"" writer director Alex Garland brings us this story about a whiz kid computer programmer named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) who by winning a contest at work ends up at his reclusive genius boss's (Oscar Isaac) mansion isolated somewhere in the Nordics.  There he meets Ava, an artificial intelligence humanoid, played by the seductive Alicia Vikander with whom Caleb must use the Turing test to see if she would pass as a human.  With only these three principal actors and a high tech mansion, Garland manages to leave you feeling tense and unpredictable to the end. There are no special effects or loud soundtracks to get in the way of the dialogue between the characters, so if that is your usual sci-fi fare then maybe not the movie for you.  The performances are intimate and subtle and can be terrifying one moment to almost weirdly normal the next.

There is some of that here to be fair, coupled with some so-so acting, building suspense and impressive CGI,

But mostly this movie is about making you feel uneasy and delivering some shock and awe via violence and unnecessary nudity.  I hate to diminish the film to that, but there was just too much skin in a story that didn't need that to say what it was trying to say.  And, for me, the story was about Ava's humanity.  Who was she?  Who could she be?  What is a creator's responsibility towards its creation? The movie hints at these questions, but never really delivers anything thought-provoking or original.  To contrast it, the Animatrix series of short films was much better at visually and narratively exploring these themes with a similar creepy undertone than this film was when it had the length of a full motion picture.

Any redeeming factors?  A few.  The suspense and sets really draw you in in a chosterphobic way.  The CGI is startling and creepy.  And the ending made me laugh... Probably more than I should have, if I'm honest.",1465430400,4,1222,4.676056338028169

6958130,1,B00S2LSA5G,"The directing was mediocre, the script/story characterization of the ""supposedly"" super intellectual nerds that built and were interacting with the two AI robots did not follow even the current thinking of creating such a robot, did these two twits never read or hear of Frankenstein or Isaac Asimov's three laws of robotics? And as the creator of the robots pointed out near the end of the film, that if the one robot had truly developed a full AI, it would do or say anything to gain its freedom. Yet during the whole film this nit wit never suspected that this was exactly what the robot was doing on more advanced thinking than the ""intellectual"". Heck even Doctor Watson would have figured it out before these two clowns.

I also appreciate that with only a handful of characters we are totally engaged in the eternal question:  What is life?  I don't watch a lot of movies because this is the kind of subject matter which grabs me.  Spectacle-type movies don't generally have that quality.  (There are, of course, some exceptions.)
  Kudos to the team for making every aspect outstanding:  Costumes, sound, performances, set dressings, and every other aspect of the production all stand out and make a fine film, which although perhaps not appealing to everyone, is certainly one which lingers in the collective mind

6958232,5,B00S2LSA5G,"Ex Machina presents some thought-provoking questions in a creative, entertaining way. Does the development of artificial intelligence in a ""robot"" mean that they should be emancipated?  Do they have the right to determine their own path?  Is dismantling such a being tantamount to murder?  Would they have the right to fight for survival, even to the extent of taking another life if necessary?  Prepare to confronted with the consequences if you guess wrong. A great movie with some real twists. The questions are answered, but what now?  The ending allows plenty of room for a sequel if they want one. Great show!",1465257600,,615,4.990196078431373

However, I have a complaint about the sound quality of the movies on Amazon streaming. For most of the movies I've watched on streaming, the dialog sound is very quiet, but the background music and effects and sounds are all incredibly loud. As a result, I spend most of the movie turning up the sound on the dialog; then dashing it down as quickly as possible so the other sounds don't break my eardrums. I would watch a lot more Amazon streaming if the sound was more balanced or, at the very least, if subtitles were added as an option on all the movies.",1465084800,,608,4.28695652173913

8697032,5,B00S2LSA5G,"or, -- A Very Long Black Mirror Episode (just not in the M. Night Shamalon way.)

[Spoilers: broad plot arc points, big strokes]

Casting: Excursive dialogue fails the two male leads at times, but overall is quite good. You'll question Gleason to the end, but ultimately sells it despite some characterization gaps in the plot.
-- Oscar Isaac is credible as an insufferable Chad-Zuckerberg, but not as an Evil AI Genius AI programmer sociopath (which, it would appear, he isn't enough of at the end, to his detriment) -- the writing saves his bacon. Still better at this than as an X Wing pilot in the newest 'Star Wars' sequels. This will be the best film he ever is in.
-- Alicia Vikander is very good, exceptional given the relatively small amount she has to do/say as a robot.

Cinematography: Great contrasts, lush and verdant, to clinical and subterranean. Effects wise, no immersion issues.
Sets: Efficient and gorgeous, lends itself to themes, just right for the small cast.

Writing: In a film with this glacial a build up of tension, one has to be kept guessing right to the end. Successful apart from some weak dialogue interplay mentioned above (which at least serves the purpose of questioning just who Gleason's character is.) Vikander's character is incredibly well done, and serves to question the sincerity and reality of our own intentions and inner life at the same time as manifesting the ethical questions surrounding AI, and the reality of evil (sentient AI will be capable of choosing evil, or abstaining from self-sacrifice in an ethical double-bind.)

Every bit a film from the writer of 28 Days Later, and a great contribution to the AI/SciFi genre. Very watchable long, slow paced film that keeps you guessing, and leaves you with the right sort of questions in an open ending (more or less horrifying, depending on your own answers to them.) 7.7-8.3/10.",1534464000,,1881,4.884012539184953
8697033,5,B00S2LSA5G,There are only a few actors in the entire movie and it almost all takes place in one remote mansion. But it is a great story. I love these kinds of sci-fi movies.,1533945600,,162,3.9393939393939394
8697034,5,B00S2LSA5G,Shocked by the ending!!  Ex Machina brought the delights and concerns about AI into a crystal clear vision.  Alicia Vikander and Domnhall Gleeson were equally matched in talent and the ability to hold a viewer's attention and to feel connected to the story.,1533945600,,257,4.953488372093023
