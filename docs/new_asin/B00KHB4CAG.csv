6429416,3,B00KHB4CAG,I bought this DVD a few months ago. The show is a classic. The DVD would skip while it was playing. I love rocket power. I'm glad Amazon has it,1480204800,,143,3.8

6429418,5,B00KHB4CAG,"What's not t love it's rocket power!  My daughter was so excited to get this DVD as this was  a show she grew up on.  It's a simple show; after all it is a cartoon, but it shows friendships  between friends who enjoy a host of sports, competitions and just plain hanging out like kids do.  No bad language and/or questionable activities like some of the cartoons of today.  Overall, it is a decent, clean show for little ones to watch as it shows no matter what life throws at you, your friends and family are what matters.",1472774400,,523,4.285714285714286
6429419,5,B00KHB4CAG,"UPDATE:  SWITCHED TO MY SONY BLUE RAY PLAYER AND ALL SYNC ISSUES ARE FIXED BEWARE XBOX USERS OF THIS PROBLEM.

I used to watch this with my daughter when she was an infant.  So I was excited to rekindle the past.  I wanted to test one of the discs since they all came kind of scratched up at the edges and about an inch in.  I threw it in my Xbox 360 so I didn't have to mess with my nightly show in my Blue Ray player.  I played the first one and the picture was fine but the voiceover is totally out of sync with the characters lips.  Kind of ruins it.  I thought maybe it was just the first one and once it was done went to the fifth episode.  It was a little better but still just not right.  I didn't even watch the fifth one all the way through.  I haven't tried any of the others or tried it on the blue ray player, but I'm guessing it won't make any difference for the sync and their all probably the same for the first season at least.  So beware this issue.  It's still cool to have it's just a shame with all this technology that most modern stuff is garbage and in the old days with what they had they did better.",1470441600,2,1125,3.924778761061947

6429421,2,B00KHB4CAG,If you don't have a remote for your DVD player don't get it. It won't let you go beyond the 1st episode of each disc without the remote. Just a helpful tip.,1465689600,2,156,3.90625

6429423,5,B00KHB4CAG,"Around the same time Digimon debuted on Fox, Rocket Power debuted on Nick, also in August of 1999! This was also the time SpongeBob was just getting his sea legs, as Mr. Krabs would say. As for the 1st season of Rocket Power, all 20 shows, or 40 individual 11-minute episodes, are in this 3-disc DVD-R set! Needless to say, Otto Rocket, alias Rocket Boy, is the leader of Team Rocket, hence his picture on the front cover here & on the enclosed discs' menus, who always loves extreme sports and getting himself into trouble doing the most extreme stuff, or just by disobeying his elders! I can certainly relate to Otto & the rest of Team Rocket, since I have 2 nieces, who don't do extreme sports mind you, who rarely listen to me or our elders to save their lives, as of 2016. Reggie, alias Regina, alias Rocket Girl, is also great at such sports, but not quite as competitive and extreme at them as Otto always is, she has senority & smarts on her brother and the rest of the team! Twister, alias Maurice, alias Twist, Rodriguez idolizes Otto but has a gullibility streak, especially with his punk-like big brother Lars! Sam, alias Squid, alias Sammy, Dullard might be considered a nerd or dork by many, but he's actually one smart cookie, in fact smart enough to be in the same grade as Reggie! You never know what Team Rocket will face next, or get in trouble for! I noticed that every season of Rocket Power has at least 1 holiday episode in them; in the case of season 1, it had one for Halloween! Rocket Power came from Klasky Csupo, the same studio that made Rugrats, AAAHH!!! Real Monsters, The Wild Thornberrys, Duckman, The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald, and 2 more hits to follow, As Told By Ginger & All Grown Up! Even with its level of cool lingo and extreme sportsmanship, even smart cookies like Sam Dullard or myself will get a kick out of this classic Nicktoon, and all 4 seasons have closed-captioning to boot, as an added bonus to them! On top of that, every episode (except A Rocket X-Mas in season 4) starts off with a modern Nick jingle, and even a letterbox-widescreen version of the jingle in 1 episode of disc 1 in this set, as every episode was originally made in Fullscreen, and thankfully remain that way! What an ""epic"" epic this series can be!",1459382400,6,2280,4.483173076923077

6429448,4,B00KHB4CAG,"My girlfriend picked up season one for us. No extra's or anything like that. That's ok because for under $15 and the entire season, it's well worth it. It has every episode from the season. Simple main menu, with a play all function. Looks just as it did on TV. My only gripes with the set would be the disc images and a lack of chapter points. Kinda lazy that they are all the same images on the DVD's are the same with just disc number being different. When I want to skip through to the second part of an episode it skips to the end of the full episode just before the credits. I hope that gets fixed in the future. Other then those minor things, well worth the money.",1413504000,4,671,4.129770992366412
