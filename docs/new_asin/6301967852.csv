387271,4,6301967852,"Review of Father of the Bride
Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

What a timeless classic! I don't usually like Spencer Tracy, but Father of the Bride is a must-see classic nonetheless.

Every parent, but fathers in particular, needs to watch this movie. If youd rather see the remake with Steve Martin, go ahead, but the original has Elizabeth Taylor, and you really cant compete with that. In Father of the Bride, a man has to adjust to, accept, and bless his daughters engagement. Shes the apple of his eye, and all of a sudden, another man becomes the sun in her universe. Its heartbreaking for all parents, especially those who treasure their little girls. But how can you stay mad at sweet Elizabeth Taylor?

The original novel is absolutely delightful and hilarious. The tone is hilarious and borderline tongue-in-cheek, which is perfectly reflected in Spencer Tracys narration throughout the film. If you like Spence even a fraction more than I do, youll like the film that much more. I don't usually like him, but he emanates gruff and grumpy, which is exactly what the part calls for! In the remake, Steve Martin isn't as grumpy, and if you read the original book, youll see the father character has to be that way for the story to truly work. And no one can say the name Buckley with such disdain as Spence; it never fails to amuse me.

The iconic scene: Liz is getting ready to go out on a date with her fianc, and Spence suggests she put on a coat since its cold outside. She refuses. Her fianc makes the same suggestion as he picks her up at the house and she looks up at him adoringly before selecting a coat. If that makes you smile, youll probably like the rest of the movie. For a bonus, watch this movie with your parents!",1500422400,,1736,4.501587301587302
387272,5,6301967852,Parents Spencer Tracy and Joan Bennett plan daughter Elizabeth Taylor's  Wedding with amusing results in this delightful domestic comedy from 1950 .  Fine  performances from the entire cast .  Skillfully directed by Vincente  Minnelli.,1497830400,,235,5.794117647058823
387273,2,6301967852,The movie was fair. The remake with Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. I bought this because someone told me the version with Steve Martin was a remake and I wanted to see it to compare. I most likely will not watch it again. Wasn't that good.,1494374400,,239,4.217391304347826

387276,3,6301967852,"So I cant help but to review this original version against the Steve Martin remake which I was first exposed to and enjoyed. The original, as viewed now, is certainly dated and while the focus was on Spencer Tracy as the titular father conveys the put-upon nature that the film is trying to convey this original version doesnt allow Tracys warmth for his family, and his daughter in particular, to shine through like it does in Martins more contemporary version. Both versions have dads pockets being ransacked to pay for the blessed union while biting their knuckles in frustration and angst, but Martins version is the one that shines when it comes to the fathers deep affection for his daughter. I cant help but credit this lack in the original to the director or to Tracy but to the times they lived in. It was okay to be affectionately demonstrative as a papa in the sanitized white American culture that the film portrays, but the affectionate demonstrations were only allow to go so far. There was a veneer of white middle to upper class reserve that had to be maintained. Tracys portrayal maintained it, and the film lacks for it IMO. I far prefer Martins version to the original.",1489536000,,1188,4.688995215311005
387277,5,6301967852,Entertaining and very amusing.  Much better than the remake with Steve Martin.  The drollery exhibited by Spencer Tracy was amusing and could be that of any father giving his daughter away in marriage.,1488067200,,201,5.0606060606060606

387346,5,6301967852,"It may be sacrilege, but I've always preferred Charles Shyer's 1991 remake to Vincente Minnelli's classic tale about the chaos involved in 'getting married'. Bought this as a completionist and lover of Elizabeth Taylor - looking utterly ravishing as 'the bride' and Spencer Tracy - a fitting and frazzled papa. The movie is mired in 50's sexual stereotyping - understandably, not a byproduct of its own time but of changing tastes and impressions about the sexes since; but the biggest bungle herein is Minnelli's obsession to delve into a nightmare involving Tracy's arrival at the church too late; a horrifying and thoroughly unnecessary diversion. Minnelli takes the joie de vivre of the big event and submarines it at every turn with dark and apocalyptic impressions that are meant to be funny, but instead transform this Father of the Bride into a very unsettling and ironic story indeed. No movie with Taylor and Tracy is a loss, however, and their performances hold up rather well considering the dated quality of the material they're working with. Bottom line: it's considered a classic and probably - rightly so. Buy today. Treasure forever.",1463184000,2,1150,5.08994708994709

Spencer Tracy completely at home in the role of the put-upon dad of newly engaged teen beauty Elizabeth Taylor. She is stunning and does a good turn here and the chemistry between daughter and pop is exceptional. Tracy does some of the best frustration double takes in film, he's a riot as the bills and the demands mount for the upcoming wedding reception circus to be held in his house. Remade later w/ Steve Martin but this original is best.

The sequel a year later, Father's Little Dividend when daughter Kay has a baby, includes most of the same cast (also directed by Vincente Minnelli) and is a perfect complement to this one.

387522,5,6301967852,"I love how this film starts with Spencer Tracy wearily observing the foibles of fatherhood and the marriage of his only daughter to a guy who ""just won't be pinned down!""  When quizzed by her father, daughter Kay (Elizabeth Taylor) admits that she doesn't even know what her future husband Buckley (Don Taylor) does for a living!  Her father then worries that ""he might be a counterfeiter!""

Spencer Tracy plays a father who can't seem to keep up with all the turmoil swirling around him.  This includes a lavish wedding and a crowded reception.  No one wants to listen to him; he has concerns about everything.  He worries that the new in-laws might be teetotalers then tries to drink them under the table when he finds they're not.  He doesn't want to support the young couple (""there's only 2 syllables between bank and bankruptcy"").  All things considered, he'd rather they elope.  The plot is based on the premise that if anything can go wrong, it will.  It's fun watching havoc happen to someone else.

Father of the Bride was nominated for Best Picture (losing to All About Eve), Spencer Tracy was nominated for Best Actor (losing to Jose Ferrer for Cyrano de Bergerac), Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich were nominated for their screenplay (losing to Joseph L. Mankiewicz for All About Eve).",1397865600,3,1301,4.815315315315315

387691,5,6301967852,"`Father of the Bride' is a film to warm your heart, a beautiful tale of fatherly affections and the bond that is formed, at times silently, between a father and his daughter.  There aren't many father/daughter films, the majority of the father films made have to deal with the bond between a father and his son, so it is nice to see a film like `Father of the Bride'.  Where Steve Martin's 1991 remake of this classic was far more centered on the comedic aspects, going the slapstick route in parts, this 1950 original is far more reserved and ultimately far more rewarding.

For those of you not familiar with the plot, `Father of the Bride' (as if the title was self-explanatory) tells the story of Stanley Banks.  Stanley opens the film slumped over in a chair, broken glass and debris on the floor, and he proceeds to recite a monologue about weddings.  You see, Stanley has just endured his daughter's wedding, and he is about to relay to you the events that led up to that fateful day.  Stanley has two boys, but he only has one daughter; Kay.  Kay is young and charming and beautiful.  Kay is in love, with Buckley Dunstan, a boy whom Stanley is unaware of.  Stanley isn't keen on the idea of his precious little girl getting married, but soon he corralled into planning the extravagant wedding he didn't want while his wife goes a little crazy with the idea.  As the day looms over his head, he begins to warm to the idea, if only to see his daughter truly happy.

And then he has to back away from the bride and take his seat next to his wife.

UGH.

I was not expecting the sublime quality of this film.  I mean, I like the 1991 remake and all, but it isn't even in the same caliber as this Vincente Minnelli charmer.  The tones here are far more subtle and the humor is allowed to sneak up on you.  It hits you in all the right ways, giving you an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia; as if their life were a beautiful mirror into your own.  The scenes are set up with a splendid crispness, and the performances are uniformly superb.  Elizabeth Taylor was the image of perfection; an iconic beauty (one of the most beautiful human beings ever created) and she shines with such delicious purity.  For an actress wholly confident in her sexuality, Taylor tones things down to create a young girl filled with bridled innocence.  Joan Bennett is just outstanding was Ellie, Kay's mother.  Her stares alone are comedic genius (the drunk scene, at the Dunstan's home...priceless), but she also has moments of such tender emotion, like when she confides in her husband her shattered dreams of a lavish wedding.  But, this film is all about Spencer Tracy; one of the finest actors to ever grace the big screen.  His paternal naturalness is so tender and endearing, and his eyes, the way they `take in' a scene, he's just spellbinding.  Every movement he makes is grounded in an authenticity; etching out for us a man who is an `every-man'.  His concern for his daughter's happiness and the pain in his heart for the loss of her innocence is breathtakingly sincere.

You can feel him.

At the end of the day, `Father of the Bride' is a treasure.  This is one to make a grown man cry (it happened), especially if you have that little wonder in your life that you dread `giving away'.",1318291200,4,3282,4.4983108108108105

387731,4,6301967852,"At some point since the dawning of the age of home videos, we all must have experienced what you might call ""filmus interruptus.""  Movies, almost by definition, were meant to be watched from start to finish, over a span of about two hours (with plenty of exceptions).  They were never designed to be ""put down"" like a book or viewed episodically, like a TV series.

But in our busy and eminently interruptible daily lives,  it's not uncommon to view a single movie over the course of two or three sittings.  And it's sometimes surprising how different a take you wind up having on the same film after as little as a twenty-four layover.

Something like that happened to me recently when I started watching Vincente Minnelli's original FATHER OF THE BRIDE.  I was sleepy when I started to watch the film on a Friday evening and never expected to be able to watch it to the end.  Watching the first hour or so,  I found it as witty and charming as I'd expected.  Like Minnelli's classic musical MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, it was a gently mocking valentine to American family life--with human foibles not merely tolerated but actually embraced.  FATHER OF THE BRIDE, in fact, could be viewed as a kind of 1950s update on the earlier film's  major themes:  the durability and value of hearth and home over all else.  Fathers might see themselves as benign despots, but clever wives and daughters always knew how to wrap the ""head of the household"" around their little fingers.  Social conventions and rituals, especially those surrounding courtship, might be portrayed as somewhat silly, but ultimately harmless.  Or maybe even essential--they just may be the glue that holds society together after all.

That this movie's themes reflect (and reinforce) Post-War all-American values is no surprise.  One can watch this film with a bit of nostalgia for an era in which a father's biggest worry on learning of his daughter's impending marriage is whether or not the girl's fianc will ever be able to ""feed her.""  (And please, no Joan Rivers type jokes about that being a legit concern, given that the daughter in question was played by Liz Taylor).

We have indeed come a long way since then.  Almost sixty years on, middle class marriage is a whole `nother institution, more the merger of two career paths than the joining of ""man and wife.""  Not surprisingly, a lot of people miss those ""good old days.""

But the dark side of 1950s suburban life and love has also been successfully portrayed by filmmakers with a less benign vision and a more critical eye.  And it just so happened that I between watching ""part 1"" and ""part 2"" of FATHER, I caught (well, re-watched, actually)  Todd Haynes' devastating take on a similar theme (and--significantly--also set in the 1950s),the powerhouse melodrama FAR FROM PARADISE, which with its themes of racial tension and sexual conflict laid bare the underside of 1950s conventionality.

When I went home and innocently starting up FATHER OF THE BRIDE again,  I found I almost couldn't bear watching it.  A feeling of claustrophobia suddenly crept in that was as surprising as it was discomfiting.  Perhaps it had something to do with my picking up the film with Spencer Tracy's genuinely disturbing dream sequence (a hallmark of nearly every Vincente Minnelli film, I'm told).  Problem was,  Tracy's Stanley Banks character wakes up from the dream to find himself psychically renewed and quite prepared now to deal with the minor hassles and frustrations of the actual wedding. In my newly skeptical frame of mind, I wasn't feeling so tolerant: suddenly, it all seemed like a big lie.  This is not how people really live their lives--and never was.

Flash forward yet another twenty four hours later, and I find I'm feeling much more charitable towards the film.  Yes, there were at least two sides to the 1950s, and, yes, I've known that for years.  It doesn't make FATHER OF THE BRIDE any the less  witty or warm.  Was the world more innocent then?  Or was it striving to be more innocent than it could ever really be (especially after the horrors of the WWII).  Is there more implicit criticism in this bit of escapist fare than first meets the eye?  I'm not sure what might have been the filmmakers' intentions (although it certainly is interesting that Minnelli himself was married four times and has been ""outed"" as gay or bisexual in more than one bio of his most famous partner, Judy Garland).  Escapist works implicity suggest that there is something to escape FROM.  True enough.  But under most circumstances, I probably would have just succumbed to the film's considerable charms.  Let's be fair: when it came to escapist fare, no one did it better than Vincente Minnelli.",1254009600,3,4714,4.816936488169365
387732,4,6301967852,"For those who like a light comedy diversion, this was pretty good stuff. Spencer Tracy is excellent as a ""father of the bride"" and he gives us a good idea of what it's like to have a daughter married off. Of course, Hollywood exaggerates a bit, and not everyone's daughter looks like Elizabeth Taylor, but that's what made this fun and, I think, a hit movie.

A re-make  was done 40 years later, starring Steve Martin. I watched both versions and would select this one over the re-make. As in most cases, there were more values and family togetherness in the classic-era movies than what Hollywood usually shows today. Nothing against Martin, but it was too difficult trying to top Tracy's performance in here.

This version actually was honored quite a bit, up for a handful of Academy Awards including ""Best Picture."" I don't remember this movie being THAT good, but everyone's sense of humor is different. Not being a father it was hard for me to relate to the mom and dad's predicaments here. Tracy and Joan Bennett played the parents. However, married friends of mine who saw this movie all loved it.

Obviously, some of this is very dated and a little unrealistic. Any father who still sees his daughter as someone in pigtails and tomboyish when she looks like Taylor ain't paying attention! Then again, maybe all dads see their daughters as little girls, no matter what age.

We see something else employed in this film you don't see anymore: someone talking directly to the camera as Tracy does here. I kind of like that. Daffy Duck did that in cartoons, with hilarious results. So did Groucho Mark. It made us, the audience, feel we were involved with wedding, too.

All in all, still a good film which holds up reasonably well.",1234396800,3,1737,4.678688524590164

387772,3,6301967852,"This piece of 1950s froth is expertly served up by Vincent Minnelli, Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, Elizabeth Taylor, and a wonderful supporting cast that includes Billie Burke, Moroni Olsen, and Leo G. Carroll, the latter doing a priceless turn as a supercilious wedding caterer.

The film is as interesting as a record of the values of the times, as it is for the masterful performance by Spencer Tracy, who manages to make something out of what is, essentially, nothing. Well, that's what froth is: air with a bit of cream in it.

Kay Banks is twenty, the only daughter of a successful lawyer, who is living the upper-middle-class Life of Reilly at home with her parents in an immaculate suburb. She has left high school, is not attending college, and clearly does not have and never has had, a job. She is manifestly waiting around for Mr. Right to appear. Mr. Right's appearance is only a matter of time, because Kay is played by an 18-year-old Elizabeth Taylor who is so astonishingly beautiful that the film generates heavy ruminations about the random injustice of the bestowal of genetic gifts. The film also hit the public relations jackpot by being released within a week of the young Taylor's (first) real-life wedding to hotel heir Nicky Hilton, in a bridal gown considerably less demure than the one she finally appears in at the end of this film.

Kay, with three brothers, is her father's darling. Dad is played by Spencer Tracy, who manages to be simultaneously gruff, tender, baffled, and shrewd. It's no small feat to walk off with a movie alongside two women as lovely and charming as Taylor and a still-striking Joan Bennett, whose fair, brunette looks, slender figure, and blue eyes make her eminently plausible as Taylor's mother, if not as the middle-aged mother of four grown children. Bennett's no-nonsense Mom is a perfect foil to Tracy's nonplussed-Dad.

As the film opens, Kay announces that Mr. Right (""Buckley Dunstan"", if you please!) has indeed appeared, and she is engaged to be married. The rest of the film is taken up with Stanley Banks's struggle with the idea of giving up his adult daughter, and his vain attempts to resist the feminine wedding fever that steamrolls over him and the rest of the household. The film culminates in a very pretty wedding in which the camera focuses dreamily, almost nonstop, on a nearly mute Taylor. The Anglican wedding service (this is Middle America's Dream WASP Family) DOES require both parties to recite the ""to have and to hold"" litany, but all Taylor gets to murmur is ""I will.""

The film supports Minnelli's reputation for flair with surface style and charm. But to a modern viewer, the film is most remarkable for the question it does not address: what is a reasonably intelligent, twenty-year-old woman doing living at home with her parents, having never earned a single penny, still sleeping in the adorably fluffy bedroom she grew up in?

The short answer, for the film's purposes, anyway, is Taylor's looks. Because, really, would anyone accept her as a nurse or a kindergarten teacher, or a secretary, or any of the other careers that might have been thought suitable for a girl so placed in 1950? Taylor's almost surreal beauty makes anything but a social destiny ludicrous to contemplate, and justifies the film's underlying premise: all this girl is fit for is to wait for Mr. Right, get those looks off the marriage-market and out of the way of other girls, and into a nice house where she can set about passing on her genetic windfall.

Among women today, struggling to juggle careers, advanced degrees, mortgage payments, divorce, children, etc., the film may cause some twinges of vestigial envy. Kay's father is SO proud of her on her wedding day: she waits for EXACTLY the right moment to start marching down the aisle! At twenty, that is the greatest challenge she has ever faced. The worst moment Kay has throughout the film is finding out that Buckley wants to go fishing in Nova Scotia on their honeymoon, rather than someplace where she can show off the lovely frocks she has purchased (that is, that her father has purchased) for her honeymoon trousseau. Even Mr. Banks is stunned at the uproar she creates over this discovery.

For those who have not always experienced the social upheavals of the last few decades as entirely beneficial, this film occasionally hits below the fantasy-belt, as Kay moves effortlessly from the adoring shelter of her father's lap to the adoring shelter of her husband's.  Kay Banks's life, of course, didn't reflect reality even in 1950 - but that the fantasy of her life can still generate so much secret longing accounts, I suspect, for the affection in which this ridiculous story continues to be held.

Sigh. Well, it is a deliciously ridiculous story, with endearing performances, and worth having if only for Tracy's, which confirms his status as one of the canniest and most skillful of American actors.

But is it really just 60 or so years since audiences turned this film into one of the era's biggest hits?  Watching it today, it might as well be 600 - only Kate Middleton could relate.",1201305600,3,5129,4.835803876852908

The vignettes are applied with the light Minnelli touch at its most charming, and they are acted with captivating nonchalance by the incomparable Spencer Tracy in the title role and by the beautiful performances of Joan Bennett, Liz Taylor, and Don Taylor...

As the complaining middle class father, thoughtful to his daughter's welfare and watchful as to the distributing of his money, Tracy is incredibly amusing... Torn by jealousy, Tracy is all good-natured father exhausted by the complete weight of the problems leading up to the happy day...

The film is also augmented by a witty voice-over narration by Tracy.  I think it unfair to compare this film to the Steve Martin remake.  I think both film's succeed and the remake, though adding some nineties touches, retains enough of the original's charming elements to stand up by itself.",1153526400,4,741,4.983739837398374
387778,4,6301967852,"Another ""classic"" that I had not seen in years and I could only remember the inspired and hilarious dream sequence where Spencer Tracy tries desperately to get down a fun house of an aisle to get to the alter while his daughter the bride and attendees look on in horror. This one sequence brings the audience out of a rather normal and traditional looking world and right into the noir for a moment before bringing us gently back to suburbia again. I also love the ""slice of life"" (as filtered through Hollywood's eye) approach to the film. By this I mean that it's rather fun to see what a modern middle class suburban family and home was like in the late 1940s to the early 1950s (servants and all). I loved seeing lovely Elizabeth Taylor dressed in rolled up blue jeans and a flannel shirt and kerchief, (That woman could wear a potato sack and look elegant) and calling Tracy ""Pop"" in her genuinely affection tone. The entire cast of characters is great with seasoned professionals like Billie Burke and Leo G. Carroll to name just a couple. But Tracy alone is the anchor to this piece, bringing a rye wit and quiet sense of dignity and patience to the whole mess, even when surrounded by the aftermath of the wedding in what looks like a bombed out city complete with with crepe paper. The whole film has such a sweet, satisfying quality that I think, in the hands of a lesser man than director, might have fallen flat. But Minnelli pulls it off brilliantly, balancing charm, sentimentality, humor and even fantasy with just the right touch. And, as others have mentioned in other opinions posted here, it is difficult to compare the original here with later remakes. I do like Steve Martin very much, but there is really nothing to compare next to Spencer Tracy and the subtle expertise of the folks at MGM, circa 1950",1148688000,5,1824,4.581039755351682
387779,5,6301967852,"Unlike some previous reviewers, I have to say that I think that the original ""Father of the Bride"" has stood the test of time and I found it to be just as enjoyable, if not more so, in some cases, as the Steve Martin remake.

Spencer Tracy stars as Stanley Banks, an attorney happily married to his wife Ellie (Joan Bennett), with three children and a lovely house.  His only daughter Kay (Elizabeth Taylor) drops a bombshell on Stanley and Ellie one evening by announcing that she is getting married to someone named Buckley (Don Taylor).  From that moment on, the Banks family's life is turned topsy-turvy by the upcoming wedding.

I found Spencer Tracy's performance to be very genuine.  I didn't see him as being so consumed by the cost of the wedding (although what father doesn't worry about the financial bottom line?) that who his daughter was marrying was secondary.  I found his performance reflected the shock and sadness over losing his daughter to Mr. Right and the confusion over getting lost in the wedding shuffle, as most fathers of the bride do.

The engagement party, where Stanley is left to tend the kitchen, thereby missing the entirety of the party and the excitement showcases this fact perfectly.  Again, Stanley is left out after the ceremony, when he wants to kiss the bride and cannot seem to get to her.

Joan Bennett is wonderfully cast as Ellie, rivaling Myrna Loy as the perfect cinematic mother.

Elizabeth Taylor is lovely as the bride to be and although her big fight with Buckley over where they will honeymoon is a bit farfetched (would they really break up over their vacation destination? - - and if they would, wouldn't that signal much larger problems?), her wide-eyed innocence and concern for her father during this time is touching.

Interestingly enough, Taylor wore her wedding dress in this film to her actual first wedding to Nicky Hilton, at the time this movie premiered (and was divorcing him by the time they began filming the sequel).

This film isn't necessarily Oscar material, but it's a wonderful cinematic collection of some Hollywood greats on film (Tracy, Bennett, Taylor, Billie Burke as the groom's mother) and a definite feel good film for the whole family.

387780,2,6301967852,"I am not afraid to stand on my little soapbox and say that typically I find that originals are enormously better than any remake could ever dream to be.  When creating a remake, one can never seem to find that perfect balance that was found in the original.  The characters, the unique situations, and the overall charm seem to be thrown out the window in luau of big box office names, CGI, and overdrawn clichs.  We all complain about them when we leave the theater and snicker when we see it.  Well, I am here to say that finally, I have been proved wrong.  The 1950s version of Father of the Bride was a far inferior version to the recent Steve Martin remake.  Yes, you have heard it here first, but the Spencer Tracy/Elizabeth Taylor version lacked the humor, wit, and realism of insanity that the remake had.  Tracy seemed like a distant father, not caring much about his actual daughter, but more about the expense of the wedding.  Joan Bennett was nothing more than an emotionless cardboard wife that seemed to be harboring a disturbing hatred towards her present life.  Elizabeth Taylor was a rich snob that was used to draw in audiences by using the classic ""eye candy"" trick.  The story, the characters, the actors, the ""dated"" sensation of this film only confused me further on how this version of Father of the Bride could ever be considered a ""classic"".

I do not want to use this forum to compare this version to the Steve Martin version, but there were obvious problems with this film from the beginning.  The complete lack of excitement from either parent when Taylor announces that she is getting married (and did anyone find that scene entirely random?) shocked me.  Even though we live in a completely different era, shouldn't there have been at least some reaction from Bennett and Tracy?  Tracy tried hard to convey the idea that he was worried about loosing his ""little girl"", but what I witnessed instead was an issue of money.  You could read in Steve Martin's eyes that he loved his little girl, and his focus was making sure that she wasn't marrying the wrong man.  This older version of Father of the Bride has a central theme that revolves around money.  Everything that happens in this film eventually leads back to Tracy complaining about how much money they are spending.  I was surprised because I wanted to see Tracy react to who Taylor was marrying, not how much he had to spend to make her happy.  It seemed to debunk the entire film and place this negative image on the entire marriage/event.  The scene where Tracy asks Taylor to just run away and get married for $1200 was idiotic.  This only solidified the randomness of the film and how Tracy had trouble grasping the true meaning of the picture.

When the centralized theme is completely destroyed, one can only guess that a domino effect will occur which will hurt other avenues of this film.  That is why the acting was so atrocious.  Tracy showed no emotion about his daughter getting married.  From the moment she informs the family of her decision until the final anti-climax climax when he shuffles around to find her, he never really opens himself up to her.  That is what I needed to see between Tracy and Taylor, one of those father/daughter-bonding moments.  Director Minnelli tried with the ""late night snack"" scene later in the film, but by that point I had lost it with Tracy.  The same can be said for Joan Bennett, who literally went through every scene without a smile or a hint of emotion.  I felt as if Tracy and Bennett were the epitome of a waspy family whose main concern was money instead of emotion.  Could we get some passion into anyone in this film?  Hugging seemed to be the most valued way of demonstrating love, and while I realize that cinema was different then, did it have to be so unrealistic?  I hated Tracy and Bennett's portrayal of husband and wife, which eventually turned me away from ever seeing them as an actual family, which only hurt this film further.

Finally, I would like to say that there was one scene that I did enjoy and if the entire film would have had the same creativity then perhaps it could have redeemed itself.  I loved the dream sequence that Tracy had about walking down the isle.  I though that it was reminiscent of director Tim Burton's early work.  The black and white stripes gobbling up Tracy was perhaps a bit of an excited moment for me because it was something I was hoping for.  Some evil floor devouring this mismatched actor.  Alas, it was only a dream, but can't we all dream?  There was more scenes like this needed to really demonstrate the fears (outside of monetary issues) of loosing a daughter and the insanity of a marriage.  There wasn't, which again, hurt this film further.

Overall, I didn't enjoy this film as much as I was hoping.  I had always heard that this was a better version than the remake with Steve Martin, but upon watching it I found out it was not.  This was a very unemotional, unapologetic look at the financial side of getting married.  Tracy cared more about the dollar amount that he was spending instead of the interest of his own daughter.  It was pathetic.  There were a total of two decent scenes in the entire film (Tracy getting eaten by the floor and when he gets plowed at the in-law's house), but outside of that it was nothing but shambles.  It hurt to watch this film because you knew it could have been better.  With physical comedy, better actors, and a stronger emphasis on the true themes of the film, Father of the Bride may have been a winner.

387801,1,6301967852,"Viewers who have fond memories of America of the 1950s may find this film amusing. Others will find it dated and wonder how anyone could have ever enjoyed it.

The problem is one of values. Spencer Tracy plays a upper middle class lawyer, whose innocent daughter Elizabeth Taylor (somehow even a young Liz fails to cut it as as an ingnue) announces one day that she has decided to marry Buckley Somebody. (Here, as in life, the groom is a cipher. It is telling that a no-name actor plays Buckley).

At first Dad is concerned that Liz will be marrying a pauper, but not to worry, Buckley's family turns out to be rich -- in addition to having a larger house, they have a white maid, while Liz's family only has Delilah, a black maid! Good stuff.

The most interesting aspect of the film is its depiction of 1950s ""sophistication"": Mom and Dad sleeping in separate beds in pressed nightclothes that leave everything to the imagination, the heavy drinking of hard liquor (Tracy comes across as an alcoholic, but a ""loveable"" one), and a formal wedding meant to generate lots of presents and impress the business associates of the parents.

The inherent tension and humor in this situation and all that follows makes for a sweet film with no sour spots except that its B&W nature makes it impossible to fully appreciate young Liz Taylor's remarkable eyes.

387842,3,6301967852,"""Father of the Bride"" is the Vincente Minnelli comedy that introduced us to the angst of hosting your daughter's wedding reception.  Spencer Tracy is the careworn 'dad' in the title, Joan Bennett, his adoring wife and Elizabeth Taylor is the bride.  In comparing the original with the Steve Martin remake of the early 1990's, its remarkable to see how much of the brilliant screenplay was simply imported for the update.  But for classic buffs, there will only be one ""Father of the Bride"".
After their sterling efforts on ""Mildred Pierce"" I had high hopes that Warner was going to continue their excellence in catalogue title remastering.  Perhaps I was mistaken.  Although the original film elements of ""Father of the Bride"" have worn remarkably well, there remain chips, scratches, camera flutter and a few nasty occasions of tearing that crop up on the negative used to remaster this DVD.  The picture has an uncharacteristically soft look to it.  Aliasing, pixelization and edge enhancement are all present, sometimes obviously so. Shimmering of fine details is also a cause for concern.  Over all, this release is a definite step down in committment and quality from other Warner DVD's of the classics and I, for one, find the sudden ""ho-hum"" attitude a bit alarming. The audio, as expected, is mono, as it originally was and, in general, it is nicely represented with little to no background hiss.
Extras: REALLY DISAPPOINTING! - two featurettes - one celebrating Elizabeth Taylor's real life marriage to Nicky Hilton, the other, a photo op with then, President Truman, meeting the cast of the film - BOTH WITH NO SOUND!!!  Honestly, what is the point?
BOTTOM LINE:  Although most people will not be disappointed by the transfer quality of this disc, it should be noted that Warner has definitely begun to pare down their restoration efforts, especially where there MGM catalogue titles are concerned.",1052784000,4,1908,5.047770700636943
387843,5,6301967852,"Another oldie I adore. What a great concept, to do a wedding movie from the father's perspective.  Spencer is the head of the household, or so he thinks, who gets steamrolled into giving his most beloved daughter, Kaye (Elizabeth Taylor) a wedding bigger than anything he could have ever even dreamed (or nightmared) of!
Spencer narrates the story, starting from a scene of frightening carnage, at his home after his daughter's wedding reception. From his daughter's annoyingly coy announcement of her impending marriage to Buckley Dunston, yup, that's right, Buckley, to the wedding rehersal, Spencer hardly knows which end is up.
This movie, although in black and white and made ages ago, still rings true.  While buckets upon buckets of movies show the mother daughter relationship, this movie shows the ties that bind a father and  daughter, and the difficulty and emotion that ensues when that relationship changes forever.
This movie is funny, touching and very sweet. So if you're an old, crusty cynic, this is not your cup of tea!",1047427200,2,1038,5.058479532163743
387844,3,6301967852,"That's because her first real-life wedding (to Nicky Hilton) was tied in to the publicity for ""Father of the Bride"", in which she plays the engaged daughter of Spencer Tracy and Joan Bennett. It's really Tracy's movie, though, as it's told from the father's point of view via constant narrative. He's an upper middle class man being ridden roughshod over by bride Liz and mother of the bride Joan, picking up the tab for everything and just being driven to the point of blowing his top. By the end, his never being able to enjoy an iota of this spectacle he's financing is a little overdone I think, but it makes for a good laugh here and there. The best single shot is when he comes to escort Liz to the church and sees Liz in her beautiful dress--what a lovely creature she was way back when. Everybody who's ever even gone to a wedding should see ""Father of the Bride"" so they can compare notes.",998956800,,898,4.4156626506024095
387845,4,6301967852,"First, a warning: this is the colorized version of this classic black and white film, so avoid it if you're a film connoisseur. The original black and white version is infinitely superior to this poorly done colorization.
Now, the good news. This film showcases Spencer Tracy's remarkable acting ability and he delivers a witty and intelligent performance as Elizabeth Taylor's long-suffering father. Spence has several monologues which are a joy to watch. His acting gift (along with Charles Laughton) is an absolute wonder and it's always a pleasure to watch him. Joan Bennet is adequate in a supporting role and Elizabeth Taylor is breathtaking as the 18-year-old soon to be wed daughter. Liz's performance is actually quite good and her interplay with Tracy is especially effective.
Yes, this movie is dated in places, but Tracy's performance is worth watching the entire movie. He is in nearly every scene and transforms a seemingly average movie into something really special.",969408000,25,982,5.2215189873417724

387847,4,6301967852,"Spencer Tracy is the whole show in this story of a man who faces the  ordeal of his daughter's wedding, an affair that grows to be much more than  he ever expected it to be.  Caterers, clothes, decorations, guest lists,  and especially an escalating cost give him endless headaches, not to  mention the fact he will be losing his only daughter.  Tracy is excellent  in a role that moves between being the voice of reason to being the voice  that stirs up more trouble.  He's very funny and his natural acting style  makes him the perfect everyman / typical father.  Joan Bennett stars as his  wife, in her glory planning the wedding she never had, and she's very good.  An incredibly beautiful Elizabeth Taylor is the bride, and it seems very  ironic watching her in a movie about weddings!  The humour is real since it  is based in human nature, and so many of Tracy's frustrations over the  wedding are still valid today.  It's a very good film.",965865600,4,947,4.535714285714286

387849,4,6301967852,"""Father of the bride"", starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth  Taylor and Joan Bennett is just magical. It's basically the story of a  young girl who's anouncing to her parents ( Tracy and Bennett ), that she  is getting married at age 20, to a young man they hardly know. the news  comes has a shock to her father, who's afraid of losing her. And the whole  process of planning the marriage comes along. Bennett wants a big wedding  for her daughter,to replace the one she never had. But Tracy doesn't want  to ruin himself, and tries to keep the wedding as cheap as possible though  it doesn't quite come to this.  The movies is fun, charming and just as  magical as a Tracy film can be. Tracy never acted really but impersonnated  his values and morals through passionnate characters that believed in what  they were saying and stucked to it. And in this particular performance,  he's more vulnerable, than we've seen before, showing the real depth of  what a father goes through when is daughter gets married. Because as he  says in the film, A son doesn't mean the same to a father than a daughter.  And that's what the movie is all about. The relationship between a father  and a duaghter, in between the constant love of a mother.",961632000,4,1235,4.540909090909091
387850,5,6301967852,"FATHER OF THE BRIDE is not a Tracy-Hepburn film.  That is Spencer Tracy, giving another peerless performance in the title role.  But that's Joan Bennett, perfectly cast as his wife, making a brilliant transition here to  mother roles from the femme fatales she played in classic Fritz Lang film  noir films of the forties.  The bride, of course, is lovely Elizabeth  Taylor. They're all first rate in this top notch Vincente Minnelli comedy.",937872000,9,441,4.972602739726027

7817907,4,6301967852,"Nearly 70 year-old movie - yet easily stands the test of time.  How can you go wrong with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor?

The start of the movie sets the stage.  The Father of the Bride (Spencer Tracy) sits in a chair looking exhausted.  He looks back on the wedding he has just lived through, sitting amongst a mess from the reception in his large house - and tells us:

""I would like to say a few words about weddings. I've just been through one. Not my own, my daughter's. Someday in the far future, I may be able to remember it with tender indulgence, but not now. I always used to think that marriage was a simple affair. Boy and girl meet, they fall in love, get married, they have babies. Eventually the babies grow up, meet other babies, and they fall in love and get married, and so on and on and on. Looked at that way, it's not only simple, it's downright monotonous. But I was wrong. I figured without the wedding.""

The movie is then seen through the eyes of Tracy's character (one doesn't feel like Tracy is acting - he IS the father) - starting with his daughter (played by Elizabeth Taylor) announcing her engagement - then for the next 3 months up to and through the wedding.

The movie is hilarious!  The acting is epic.  The characters interplay well with each other.  Some great scenes
- the engagement party where he is advised ""from now on, your only function is to pay the bills.""
- his first meeting with the groom-to-be - and how he never gives the groom a chance to talk
- his nightmare about how truly bad the wedding ceremony might be
- how he keeps coming back to the ""money pit"" as every expense adds up

What really makes this good is truly Tracy and Taylor though.

I'd probably give it 5 stars if I were writing this in 1950 - but there are some points that have become dated; not enough to detract much",1524268800,,1841,4.304347826086956
7817908,5,6301967852,"Fantastic Movie! Spencer Tracy is SO much better than Steve Martin. Better script, too. Never get tired of it. Not an Elizabeth Taylor fan, but she plays her part well, as well as the other characters. Much of the appeal is that it is so true to life and family reactions to marriage and the planning of it. My kids are in their 20's and all 5 of them love this old movie!!",1523145600,,373,4.123287671232877
