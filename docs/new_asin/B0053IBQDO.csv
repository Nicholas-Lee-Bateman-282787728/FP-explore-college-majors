4533966,5,B0053IBQDO,"Genocide is a terribly difficult subject to address - in any medium - especially when lots of people would rather ignore it. But director-cinematographer Mark Bedrossian does it. This documentary makes it possible for all of us to return to 1915 and see not only what happened to the Armenians, but why and how it happened. In my opinion Mr. Bedrossian both makes the journey possible and palatable without turning it into cliches. Every schoolkid in America should have to watch this documentary, because what happened in 1915 to the Armenians is repeatable today. That's why this film matters. The evil that conspired to overwhelm the Armenians still exists, in a variety of forms, under many flags, in many places in the world today. We ignore this at our peril. It is important for all of us to know how such things happen, under what cover, inside of what excuses, lies, hatreds and rationales. Revealing this is the job of the documentary filmmaker. I salute this man for his work of wrestling a very tough subject into comprehensible, relevant shape. This documentary performs on all counts. In a media universe of gimmicks, special effects and painful shallowness that obscures truth, this film rises above and allows me to consider the Armenian Genocide from a fresh perspective - without sugar-coating. Is it emotional? Absolutely. Is it honest? Without a doubt. And yes, as such, the scalding honesty will bother some people. Some will be disturbed by the subject, the brutality; the gut-gnawing horror of what happened to the Armenians and, the laser-clarity of the telling. The words ""unblinkingly honest"" and ""gripping"" come to mind when I think of how to describe this film. It's well shot, beautifully edited and thought provoking. See it. This history demands an honest telling. Thanks, Mr. Bedrossian, for honoring this terrible period of human history, these people and the future generations, worldwide, who need to see the truth.",1361836800,23,1950,5.059006211180124
4533967,5,B0053IBQDO,"""Writing history with lightning"", President Windrow Wilson described The Birth of a Nation when premiered in 1915

Is the only way to describe this film.  A cinematic treatment bridging antiquity to the present through film making worthy of Kubrick's 2001 Space Odyssey (the primeval scene suddenly catapulting to the space station with a singular cut)
No film, to my knowledge, reveals the Armenian Genocide with the force and impact felt in this documentary. I saw the newly released Special Edition with an IMAX sequence ...the moviemakers have arguably put together an epic.
1915 The Armenian Genocide is a must see!",1361750400,8,620,5.19

4533969,5,B0053IBQDO,"A powerful stunning and provocative treatment of the brutality of man and how a group of people were able to survive. The narration, music, direction and editing was unlike any documentary I have ever seen with actual footage of survivors being interviewed. A must see for anyone that is serious about world history and the plight of man. Mr. Bedrosian has created a masterpiece!",1307491200,16,379,4.9375

Among other things she remembered playing with lots of gold coins with her brother. She remembered her mother being behaded in front of her eyes near water fountain still with tears in her mothers eyes.....",1417219200,,328,4.672413793103448
8455279,5,B0053IBQDO,"This film is awesome and is highly recommended for all those who see the truth about the depths that man's inhumanity to man can sink to when power gets in the wrong hands and when we act like barbaric animals in our intolerance of other peoples, nations, religions, ideologies, etc.
Did you ever notice how the only people who deny this holocaust, and the Nazi holocaust of the Jews (and others) are the same people who would just love to have another one?
I am not Armenian myself, but my best friend growing up was and I was very close to his family (parents and grandparents) and I can attest to the level of sadness they still felt 4 to 5 decades after the Armenian Genocide. I grieved with them knowing what a wonderful people they are. I applaud those who honor the memory of those who were so brutally murdered. I also applaud the efforts demonstrated by films like this for not letting anyone try to sweep this key historical event under the rug; and holding those who might not have perpetrated this themselves responsible because they are nearly as guilty by not having the decency to even own up to it.",1406851200,3,1114,4.4926108374384235
8455280,5,B0053IBQDO,"I have read and viewed many documentaries on the Armenian genocide and I must say that this DVD is very factual in content, well produced with first hand interviews, and if one is keen on the various pychopathic lies from those who committed the genocide, you can see the transformation of lies from decade to decade including the one from the loser ambassador in this film. Thank you to the producer and director for producing an important piece on the greatest crime against humanity. Great Job!!!!",1406073600,8,500,4.825581395348837
8455281,5,B0053IBQDO,"this film or any other film about a genocide of any race is very important to the whole man kind so something like this never happens again I would not wish this kind of crime even to our worst enemies ""turks"" , My grandparents were directly involved in the 1915 nightmare that came upon the Armenians they have lost loved ones in this tragedy and I for one pledge that this part of our Armenian history is never forgotten , the film is awesome and also very educational",1390262400,6,470,4.3522727272727275

I had heard about Mr. Bedrosian's 2 recent films, '1915 The Armenian Genocide' and 'Romans Armenians and The Coming of the Messiah', but it wasn't until I chanced upon a youtube trailer that I finally took the time to purchase them. I did not expect to give either film more than one viewing, then add them to my collection.  To my and my film aficionado friends' delight, we proceeded to study these two gems with admiration.  There is something new to be learned each time we view them.

Although the subject matter is predictably intense, Mr. Bedrosian executes a multi millennial composition of, not only the history, but existential nature of this ancient race that has survived the grandeur and calamities incessantly brewing in the world's most active historical crossroads of the Caucuses.  The culture that brought so much value and enlightened progress to the human race, theology, mythology, technological and social progress, integration of cultures and races, is finally presented in it's multi- dimensional splendor through a rare and captivating cinematic time transedence technique, flawlessly executed.  Lovers and students of film, get ready for a treat.

Mr. Bedrosian, an accomplished director and cinematographer, is also an artist and visionary historian.  In these, his latest works, he has utilized his far reaching knowledge and insight of history with his gifts and experience in technical cinematic production and fine art. This combination of talent all in one rendition, alone, would be reason enough to study and enjoy  these films.

In the classical format of a docudrama, the '1915...' film contains IMAX sequence, original historic footage I have not found anywhere else, and superb cinematography, photography, and the list goes on.  To top it off, the art film is shot in 70 mm film, making it a rare artistic gem that will be a subject of study and admiration in our collection for all generations to come.

For anyone interested in film, history, art, music, composition, this is a must have.  Mr. Bedrosian, please offer an exhibition of your art and possibly reproductions suitable for framing.  I will purchase more copies for unique gifts to select individuals.",1371859200,13,2621,5.68974358974359
8455284,5,B0053IBQDO,"I have spent over two decades sitting in the dark watching film as a Senior Executive in the Motion Picture Division of both Paramount Pictures and M.G.M. Studios. Not only is this piece exceptionally photographed considering the modest budget but more importantly, the factual Historical information provided is extremely significant because so few are aware of the magnitude of this genocide. One person who did take note was Adolf Hitler.
The film will be difficult to watch for some people at times due to the actual footage incorporated into the project however it is used in a way necessary to punctuate the atrocities which occurred. This is a film worth watching.",1363564800,34,671,5.054054054054054
8455285,5,B0053IBQDO,"Wow. As a mother I can't imagine this happening, but I know it does. I will show this to my children. It is a teaching tool.

I ask the critics of this history and this film:  How else will we learn unless someone tells the story? Healing begins with the truth. No matter how difficult that truth is.

I pray this never happens to anyone again, and pray for those to whom it did. I applaud the people who made this documentary.
