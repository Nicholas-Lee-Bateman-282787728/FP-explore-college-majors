7029488,5,B00U7DLSVK,"DCI Vera, played by Brenda Blethyn, is in her fifth year as a series. I like Vera a lot. She is overweight with mussed up hair, never wears make-up, dresses in old fashioned dresses with sweaters, sensible shoes and a god awful long coat with a dodgy hat. She drives an old Range Rover and is always in charge. She is good at her job, damn good, has been at it long enough that she has an instinct which serves her well. She gets her man or woman most of the time, because all of her cases involve murder.

This season the old trusted DI Joe Ashworth is gone. Joe played by David Leon, knew Vera well and her him. A mutual respect and I think a motherly love from Vera. He is onto better things, and Vera now has a new brash young man, DC Aiden Healy. Things are rough in the first couple of episodes but they seem to even out as time goes on. DC Kenny Lockhart, played by Jon Morrisey is still on board. And, we are introduce to several new players. Hopefully we will learn more about them as time goes on.

The episodes are 90 minutes and all concentrate around a murder of some sort. All are well done. Personally, I would like Vera to have a personal life. We know a little, but Vera deserves some romance or a child. Come on, writers!

7029490,5,B00U7DLSVK,"Series five of Vera includes four 90-minute episodes.  There are subtitles but no subsidiary material on the discs.  The skies are a little brighter than in some of the earlier episodes, but most of the human behavior remains dark.  Veras sidekick, Joe, has moved on.  In the first episode there are references to his success in his new position.  Veras new DS is Aiden Healy.  Aiden has had some difficulties in his previous assignment and has to prove himself to Vera.  By the fourth episode, he has done so.  The other new addition to the cast (the rest of the supporting cast remains) is Helen Milton, an intelligence officer.  Played by Lisa Hammond, Helen is confined to a wheelchair but she is truly differently abled.  A computer whiz with a slightly acerbic voice and wit, she is a welcome addition to the ensemble.  We also see more of DC Kenny Lockhart (Jon Morrison) in these episodes.

The four episodes (summarized briefly in the Editorial Reviews) are solid and workmanlike.  There is no diminution in quality from previous seasons.  The scripts and acting are strong and the Northumberland atmospherics remain an interesting dimension to the series.  Vera is still hitting her bottle of Irish whiskey when she returns, alone, at night, and she is still bringing bad guys to justice.

These discs will not work on American dvd players.  However, the cost of all-region players is now very reasonable and you can obtain one through Amazon.com.  We have Pioneer all-region players and they work very well.  You do not need to program them (as in the past); you simply pop in a disc from any region and the machine reads it and displays it.  Having an all-region player enables you to compare prices internationally and see material before it is released in the U.S.  We have found it to be a solid investment.",1433116800,20,1822,4.7756410256410255

7029498,5,B00U7DLSVK,"Great show seasons 1-4. The major change in season 5 left a pretty big hole and it seems like the writers started writing Vera to be less complex of a character. Also seems like they couldn't come up with anything interesting for the new guy so they decided to morph him into the character that was previously written out... which came across as pretty sudden and forced.

7029507,5,B00U7DLSVK,"Vera is now officially my favorite British detective. (Sorry, Morse, I did love you a lot. But Vera has surpassed you by a hair. ) Blethyn is one of the great British actors. She has the kind of talent I could watch all day. She is sort of a female Columbo with the sloppy dress and the raincoat, but the writing and acting are so much better. In fact there are a number of great actors in this show. I especially noticed the tiny girl in the office always in front of the computer screen. She is a natural actor. I hope she gets more roles. Vera's new sidekick is also very promising. It is a great ensemble. Give us more!!!!",1499385600,2,626,4.181818181818182

7029523,4,B00U7DLSVK,"""Vera"" Series 5 (2015) sees DCI Stanhope's sidekick and partner of four years, DS Joe Ashworth,  promoted up and out of the Northhumberland & City Police. His replacement is DS Aiden Healy (Kenny Doughty), who recently shot a criminal and is in need of redemption. He's swarthy and single and a little too outspoken for Vera's taste. Healy is a minor heartthrob for the ladies, as was Ashworth, but he's not squeaky clean. In fact, he makes one mistake that sticks in Vera's craw in each episode. He's not yet up to Vera's standards. DC Bethany Whelan (Cush Jumbo) is back after a two-season absence, and a new character, IO Helen Milton (Lisa Hammond), is introduced. Helen is confined to a wheelchair, and, as the team's researcher, is perpetually stationed at her computer. And DC Kenny Lockhart (Jon Morrison) is still with us.

The episodes are:

One of the chalets in a trailer park for vacationers catches fire and explodes in ""Changing Tides"". The body of a woman is found in the trailer, and the niece Dina of Jim Viner (Wayne Foskett), who owns the park, and her friend Sally (Katie Brayben) are missing. The explosion occurred following a stag party around a nearby bonfire for Ryan (Elliot James Langridge), fianc of Jim Viner's daughter Claire (Katherine Rose Morley). Neighbor Malcolm Raggert (Dorian Lough) is a frequent complaintant about the noise and about Ryan's small cannabis farm, but he claims to have been elsewhere at the time of the explosion. What initially looks like an accident, caused by a defective light in the cannabis farm, looks like murder, when traces of accelerant are found outside the chalet.

""Old Wounds"" opens as DS Healy chases a suspect through Hollowthorpe Woods and stumbles upon the skeletal remains of a young woman. The team's new researcher, Helen (Lisa Hammond), digs up the case of 17-year-old Carrie Telling (Blaise Simmons-Johnson), who disappeared from her working class neighborhood shortly after clashes between police and miners in 1984. Carrie's father Bill Telling (George Costigan) always suspected his daughter was a victim of foul play, but DCI John Warrick (Daragh O'Malley), head of local police at the time, dismissed her as a runaway. Found with the body was a credit card issued to ""REC Imports"", which had been found, then lost, by teenaged employee Michael Tennant (Martin Marquez), now an MP, adding to the mystery.

A body surfaces in a slurry pit on a dairy farm owned by Danny Pryor (Mark Bonnar) in ""Muddy Waters."" The dead man was strangled, then weighted down in the pit. Suspicion initially falls on the Eastern European migrant workers employed on the farm, including Zamir ""Sammy"" Ilic (George Lasha), who also drove a day cab, and their manager Milosh Beqiri (Velibor Topic), as Danny Pryor and wife Karen (Alex Reid). But when the deceased is discovered to be Jack Reeves, a ""traveler"" previously resident of a nearby camp, Vera and DS Healy turn their attentions to Reeves estranged parents, Billy (Mark Womack) and Deirdre (Jennifer Hennessy), and to Frank O'Brien (Lee Ross), father of Jack's former fiance, teenaged Sigourney (Aisling Franciosi).

A family man, Owen Thorne (Keith Newby), gone to pick up his foster daughter Lila (Carla Melaco) from her prom falls to his death from the top of the car park in ""Shadows in the Sky."" It's not clear if by accident or foul play, but Thorpe's colleagues at the docks blamed him for a fatal accident in which a young man was trapped under a rig. That man's father Mick Mckittrick (Rob Jarvis) vowed to get to the bottom of it. Lila's biological father, a drug dealer named Logan Tilly (Niall Greig Fulton), had upset her just before Owen arrived, and he opposed her adoption by the Thornes. Owen's wife Ellie (Nadine Marshall) suspected him of an affair, and their son Cameron (Daniel Ezra) suspected it was with Hannah Ferris (Levi Heaton), a young addict Owen was helping through a local charity.",1486166400,,3931,4.921568627450981

7029578,5,B00U7DLSVK,Vera is great to watch.  She reminds me of Columbo!  She looks dowdy but is sharp.  Her supporting cast is pretty and smart.  A much a thinking persons show.,1482624000,,157,4.310344827586207
7029579,5,B00U7DLSVK,"Vera isbabsolutely terrific entertainment; well written and excellent acting; miss David Leon's character ""Joe"", but ""Vera's"" new Dectective Asst is developing into an interesting character.  Love Brenda Blethyn!!!",1482278400,,214,6.642857142857143
7029580,5,B00U7DLSVK,The countryside scenery is absolutely breathtaking!,1482105600,,51,7.666666666666667
7029581,5,B00U7DLSVK,"Vera, with its unlikely heroine, at first blush, seems like an English ""Murder She Wrote"". It is anything but. The plots are complex, and a real affinity for the actors develops across the board. In most American mystery series, I am usually able to have a pretty good guess as to the criminal, though maybe Columbo was an exception. Vera takes time for what seems very much like real police work, with enough twists and turns and sometimes a lucky break, but usually gains the results with old-time gumshoe work. Nothing is ever easy, and the police characters are fashioned for you to get a real sense of them as people.",1482105600,,622,4.612612612612613

7029585,5,B00U7DLSVK,Love this character. She reminds me of all hard working women. She's not all glammed up with 5 inch heels and a pound of makeup. She's there to do a job! Brenda Blethyn is fantastic in this role and brings it home with her little idiosyncrasies like the little smile she gives everyone including the bad guys. She disarms them first and then pounces.,1481932800,,350,4.484375

7029702,5,B00U7DLSVK,Vera is such a well written series set in beautiful northern England on the coast. Each episode gives a little bit more insight into the character of Vera.

7029705,5,B00U7DLSVK,"Great detective series with very likable characters.  Vera is a no-nonsense, sometimes hard to work for boss, who
pushes her subordinates to work harder.  She is usually aloof, but deep down she really cares for her staff.  It is not
your typical, easy to solve murder.  There are an array of characters, any one of them could be the suspect, so you are
never really sure until the surprising, twisting end.",1473465600,,407,4.690140845070423
7029706,4,B00U7DLSVK,"I love Vera and I would have given Season 5 a five star rating but for the fact that there is no closed captioning.  I will say that it seemed like the accents were easier for me to understand  this season but I still would have liked the cc. At first I was dismayed that Joe was gone but I like Aiden a lot. The episodes never bore me and have twists end turns that surprise me. I just started Season 6 (the final season) and I know I will miss Vera, Kenny and the lot.",1473465600,2,470,3.8854166666666665

The locations  are breathtaking and Vera and her relationships with her staff pull you in.

7029739,4,B00U7DLSVK,"It is interesting to watch Vera unravel a mystery. She will not give up and along the way she is bullheaded, rude, and at times a bully. Not an easy person to be around but her heart is in the right place. Every once in awhile she shows her compassion. Let's just say she's a complicated person and no one gets in her way. Good supporting characters you can sympathize with also.",1470700800,,379,4.277777777777778

7029767,5,B00U7DLSVK,"I love everything about this series.  Characters are believable and the story lines stay relatively uncluttered, I.e., there are usually not multiple convoluted murder plots. Brenda Blethyn plays Vera with such a depth of competing emotions that she never becomes predictable.  And the scenery is magnificent, I have visited the area and it is one of my favorite parts of the UK.  I will admit that I miss David Leon's ""Joe"", and there are a lot of characters coming and going, but that tends to be the norm with UK dramas.  I am eagerly awaiting Season 7 now and I hope many more seasons to come.",1468540800,5,597,4.60377358490566

She cares about those she works with but doesn't express such thoughts and feelings. Those who work under her are often silent on the subject, also. Vera is bright, capable and an example of what a good detective can accomplish. Above all, she is not boring or predictable.

This had added immeasurably to my enjoyment since the various accents and different terms (who knew ""kip"" means sleep?) At least I saw the word and could ck my dictionary for it. These characters have grown over time; even Kenny now comes in for a little praise here & there.

The real beauty and charm of Vera (or used to be) is that it was rough around the edges, darkly-schemed and themed. This season is a total visual/aesthetic departure and it is jarring.",1461024000,,330,4.426229508196721

7029956,4,B00U7DLSVK,"I've loved this series since it's beginning. Vera is all ""law and order"" but with a heart. Excellent writing also. However, I was disappointed in the episode I just watched, as her ""law and order"" went out the window when an illegal woman and her son, who were illegally on public assistance, came into the picture. In this episode, the focus was on family (the ills and good) and her police partner had just had a baby, and is paying (by taxes) for that extra public assistance money that is going to all the illegals (a whole hostel full of them - not a spoiler, it's a side note in the show). She says ""no one owns the land""....well, yes, the Creator owns it...but that's not the point. The point is we are countries with laws and boundaries and private property. Is giving to others good? Heck yes! Is hording all you have and not sharing, bad? Yes, it's GREED...but the government is the wrong place for doing the ""taking and the giving"".",1460332800,,943,4.456647398843931

7029978,4,B00U7DLSVK,The series has been great in previous seasons.  This season seems more formulaic though and the first episode struggles with the formula and seems muddled.  Stay with it though because the rest of the episodes get better and better.

7029985,5,B00U7DLSVK,"I was disappointed to see that her second in command had changed, but he did great.  This is one of the best series around.  Each story lasts about an hour and a half so it is long enough to develop some complexity, but not so long that it takes more than one evening to watch.  I always look forward to the next installment of this series and I will continue to buy them as long as their quality remains first rate.  So far so good.  I'm not going to go into all the plots. These are murder mysteries and therefore intended for adults.  It is not that they are so violent or vulgar that a child would be damaged; it's just that the episodes are somewhat gritty and there is no whimsy like one might find in an Agatha Christie mystery.",1455753600,5,735,4.177304964539007

7029998,5,B00U7DLSVK,"A friend of mine can't get into Vera's exploits -- her dowdy appearance, bad hair, bad temper, bad habits, and lack of social graces make it hard for him -- but what's great about Vera is a lot about what's wrong with American TV dramas. She's a real person to her many fans. She's not impossibly thin or impeccably made-up; her shirts don't plunge to her navel; her shoes are sensible.  In other words, this is a character that fans can imagine could really be in charge or (in control of?) a disparate team of pretty competent detectives.

I find her stories very engaging too, although one of the distinct and consistent tones of many of the episodes is sadness. There is grief, loss, not a clear black-and-white clarity of good and evil; young, old, the unlucky, and the innocent can be ""evil doers"" as well as victims. Some viewers may not like this; a lot of us have become trained to expect the happy ending, the villainous bad guy to get his comeuppance, and the missing child to return safely. What this series offers is a more clear-eyed look at the way crime affects families, how well-intentioned actions can result in tragedies, how the troubled teenager can actually bear some responsibility for a heinous crime. If viewers find comfort in the concept of catharsis, they will find it in Vera. Pity and fear and the ""oh, no!"" in many of her stories does raise the game for this series, and I really really hope Vera keeps going!

On a side note: Viewers may remember Brenda Blethyn for her many film roles, but her range as an actress is really impressive: from the mild Presbyterian mother of Brad Pitt in A River Runs Through It to the screaming banshee of a parent of a troubled girl in Little Voice. She can do it all.",1454025600,14,1735,4.519108280254777
7029999,5,B00U7DLSVK,"Can't get enough of Vera. Love this UK police procedural.

7030013,5,B00U7DLSVK,"It took awhile, but I have grown to love VERA. From her calling everyone ""luv"" to her rumpled wardrobe (shades of COLUMBO, in a way...) Vera is like a beloved aunt. Except beneath that deceivingly frumpish personality is a steel trap mind when it comes to solving crimes.

Not a lot of guns. No offensive language. This is one show among a handful (GEORGE GENTLY and MIDSOMER MURDERS come to mind) that you can sit down and watch with your Mum and not feel the slightest bit uncomfortable.

VERA Set 5 sees the wonderful Brenda Blethyn with a new partner and an expanded support team that includes a lovely young actress named Lisa Hammond who might be best known for her role as Donna Yates on EastEnders. Ms Hammond was born with a restricted growth condition and is quite small, sometimes using a wheelchair (as she does on VERA) to get around. Her role as Helen never seems like political correctness. She is there a) because Ms Hammond can act and b) Helen contributes significantly to Vera's crime solving success.

7030042,3,B00U7DLSVK,"We've watched every season of Vera so far and love the storyline and characters. Unfortunately, this season was a bit of a disappointment. Aside from some pensive glances and one opening scene of Vera falling asleep in a chair, there's no inkling about what's driving her character outside of the cases she has to solve. It seems unrewarding not to get to know Brenda Blethyn's character more because she is just SO GOOD. Also, some of the cuts in this season are implausible and annoying. For example, the jump cut from an interview of a suspect to the detectives finding DNA then a cut back to the same interview where the DNA is mentioned. The sequence didn't make sense and just leaves you scratching your head. I would have given this season only two stars but the last show saved it a bit -- almost like the new cast started to get into the swing of things by then.  Interesting story and better dialogue. I'll probably tune in to watch another season but will always feel this one was the weakest of the lot.",1446336000,2,1015,4.516304347826087

Excellent supporting cast  + great atmospheric photography of the area.

7030073,5,B00U7DLSVK,"I remember the first time I watched some episodes of Vera Season 1, which originally aired in May 2011. I wasn't sure what to make of this new detective. Her most frequent phrases were Mmm and Mmm? uttered in a squeaky little murmur.  And, after 5 seasons, I still feel unfamiliar with her calling strangers love and pet.

The difference is that NOW I know there is an intelligence and intuition behind her shuffling that is proven by her cases solved.  And she is not some grandmotherly figure mistakenly given a badge. As a matter of fact, DCI Vera Stanhope is driven and alone, if not lonely, likes to drink and isn't always pleasant. In Season 5, her longtime sergeant, DS Joe Ashworth, is replaced by a transfer, DS Aiden Healy. In episode 1, Aiden makes the mistake of mouthing off a bit and Vera gets snappy. DC Kenny Lockhart, whos been with Vera since series 1, tells Aiden: She doesnt like them cheeky.
Aiden: Ill bear that in mind.
DC Bethany Whelan: Dont worry. The first three years are the hardest!

Above all, it is the plotting that keeps me coming back to Vera. I enjoy a good mystery, and these are good mysteries. They take place in NE England, shown in red on the attached map. Her precinct is called the ""Northumberland and City Police.""

If you didn't already know, the characters are based on the mystery novels by Ann Cleeves.  I can highly recommend another TV series based on Ann Cleeves mysteries, the new Inspector Perez stories titled Shetland, because its on those stormy islands the mysteries occur:

The 4 episodes of Vera Set 5 originally aired in April 2015. They are about 93 minutes each, for a total 371 minutes of engaging mystery viewing.  If you buy the DVD Set 5, the show is presented in 16:9 widescreen and stereo. English subtitles are available. There is only 1 DVD extra, a 2 minute Photo Gallery.

Episode 1 Changing Tides The sun is barely over the horizon when a huge explosion rips through a caravan park, what wed call a trailer park in the U.S. The fire spreads to the caravans on either side, which fortunately were empty at the time. Unfortunately, the first caravan was supposed to be empty, too, but the police find a womans body inside. As the door was locked from the outside, it becomes a murder investigation.
I found this a very human, moving plot. Its not always about greed.

Episode 2 Old Wounds The body of a young woman is found in Hollowthorp Woods. Its fully decomposed, and the 1st clue to when she died is a button on the clothing: Coal not Dole. Thirty years before, the Hattington Colliery was home to a violent miners strike and thats when a teenaged Carrie Telling was last seen.  As her bitter grieving father tells Vera, the police wouldnt budge to solve the disappearance of a half-caste miners daughter. After leaving the father, Vera says to Aiden: Should never have brought uniform. Sore thumb. Winds people up.
Aiden: Pensioners mainly, aren't they?
Vera: Meaning?
Aiden, joking: Less likely to jump us.
Vera: Theyve got long memories, love,
Trivia: A colliery is a coal mine and its surrounding buildings. The 1984-85 strike in the TV show takes place at a fictional colliery, but the nationwide coal strikes of 84-85 were very real. Margaret Thatcher made her name by breaking the miners union. By whatever means possible.

Episode 3 Muddy Waters At Danny Pryors farm, his foreman, Milosh Beqiri is trying to hook up a pipe to the slurry pit. It sloshes and stops and the exasperated Milosh tells Danny it is blocked.  It sure is, by a mans body. Couldnt be an accident because its been weighted. When the leads don't come fast enough, the irritated Vera snaps to her crew, Why are we still referring to our victim as Slurry Man? How hard can it be to find a name?
Trivia: When Milosh has trouble at the slurry pit, he gives an exclamation in Serbian, Zaboga! As near as Ive been able to find out, this translates to something like, For Gods Sake!

Episode 4 Shadows in the Sky Its a strange beginning. A young woman in her prom formal is quietly crying. Her Dad comes to pick her up in an upper level of a huge empty parking garage. She stays in the car while he goes up one level to find a payment machine that works. Then he doesnt come back. He doesnt answer her phone call. She leaves the car to investigate, just in time to hear his body fall from an upper story and land on its back on a car below. Head first, on his back  and he already paid the parking fee. That doesnt sound like he jumped of his own volition.
I thought this episodes plot was a little contrived, but the acting is great and it does a great job of showing the grunt work involved in police work.

Good entertainment!

7030074,5,B00U7DLSVK,"Vera Set 5. This is the  latest release in the hit British television series that stars two-time Oscar nominee and multi-award-winner Brenda Blethyn,  (PRIDE & PREJUDICE, SECRETS & LIES, ATONEMENT), as the title character, the cantankerous  but brilliant Detective Chief Inspector Vera Stanhope.  It is based on Ann Cleevess bestselling crime fiction, set in northeast England. From the streets of Newcastle to remote rural Northumberland, Stanhope tackles cases as diverse and wild as their settings: a deadly blaze at a vacation park on the windswept North Sea coast, the 30-year-old disappearance of a schoolgirl from a distressed former mining town, a corpse decomposing in a dairy farms slurry tank, the suspicious death of a family man in a multistory parking lot. As overweight  in fact, I think our girl has put on a few pounds-- badly dressed, rumpled and caustic as ever -- think a female  Columbo--DCI Stanhope, has lost her trusty second in command  DI Joe Ashworth, and must learn to live with a new assistant,  Detective Sergeant Aiden Healy (Kenny Doughty, STELLA, SNOWPIERCER), who is still recovering from an on-the-job trauma.  DC Kenny Lockhart, played by Jon Morrisey is still in the cop shop. This box set, which I received as a review copy,  consists of 4 discs, containing 4 feature-length mysteries, for approximately 371 minutes of entertainment.  It has subtitles, thank goodness, for the vast majority of potential viewers not familiar with Geordie-speak.  Its not for the squeamish, contains some profane language and disturbing images.

The Geordieland scenery is beautiful and forbidding, with its stone houses, fences, swamps, pounding seas.  The plots are tight, taut, riveting, resonant, complex, vivid; the cases involve violence.  The acting  is as strong as the totality of these British mysteries.  And Vera? DCI Vera is a secret tippler; her personal/love life/family life is, in this series, non-existent. Her hair is a mess; she never wears make-up, wears old fashioned dresses/sweaters, sensible shoes, a long Mackintosh coat, a floppy hat, all that have seen better days. She drives an old Range Rover; unusually enough, in this series as in its predecessors, she actually does the driving.  (In the many, many British police procedurals I have watched, its almost always the junior officer who drives).  DC Kenny Lockhart, played by Jon Morrisey is still on board. Vera is getting on, but she is still rough, tough, obsessed with her job. Evidently, she always calls the shots, gets her man, or woman. The episodes are:

1. Changing Tides. Vera investigates a fatal caravan park fire; lots of raucous misbehavior going on among its young denizens.

2. Old Wounds. A skeleton found in a wood reopens a 30 year old cold case. The corpse is identified as the teenage daughter of a strongly pro-union former miner.  In solving the case, the team acquaints itself with the desolate former mining town, reacquaints itself with the famous miners strike at the time of the girls death, a landmark in the prime ministerial reign of Margaret Thatcher, and of the once-strong British labor union movement.

3. Muddy Waters. A young mans body is found in a dairy farm waste tank. The farmer employs foreign day help; travelers (formerly known as gypsies), used to be next-door, are still nearby.  A multitude of suspects.

4. Shadows in the Sky. A waterfront figure, a family man, falls to his death from a Newcastle multi-level parking garage.  Suicide, accident, or murder?  Once again, a multitude of suspects in a case that raises a lot of emotion.

Theres no doubt but that this series is female-centric; not only does it star a smart, tough woman detective, but each episode, at least in this set,  revolves around families, parents and children; sisters, nieces, nephews.  Although, in this set, oddly enough, there is  no sign  of Veras  sister, whom weve previously met briefly, and no mention of, or flashbacks to, their dead father.  So is it a chick flick, if TV productions can be so described? Nope, this detective drama is bare-knuckled noir.  And while there may be more to our Vera, shes still got her snap, crackle and pop.",1442966400,9,4172,5.049707602339181
7030075,5,B00U7DLSVK,"Im making the assumption that anyone searching for reviews on this set has seen at least a few of the 4 previous sets  probably all  and so there is no reason to tell you who Vera and her staff are. Nearly all are the same. She gets a new assistant this year and as they progress through the four stories here, he tries not to slip up, and usually he doesnt.

There are  as I said  4 episodes here. Each runs 92 minutes (The show was produced in 2015 by the commercial British network ITV. )  There is significant graphic violence (well images of dead and mutilated bodies) but I don't even remember on swear word.

It really doesnt mater what the incident is that starts with the dead body, We are here to see Vera do her best at solving it. Vera is frumpy and overweight (and calls nearly everybody Luv, and is not unlike Peter Falks Columbo in her interrogations,

I won't give any spoilers here. No reason for that  or for plot summaries of each case. (Im not sure why some reviewers feel this is needed. In fact Acorn has set up the menu so you have the option of seeing a plot summary before you play it or you can skip it.
I understand Brenda Blethyn (Vera) Northumberland accent but I sometimes need help with the characters. Acorns has some of the easiest to read English subtitles of all the DVDs I review. I thank them for that.

We are up to the 5th set so no bonus behind the scenes featurettes. There is one VERY small bonus. I photo gallery that plays silently for 1  minutes. Nothing to write home about <g>.

Though the character is based on the center of Ann Cleeves books, the stories now are newly written. For me, its all about Vera so Im with her as long as ITV continues to churn out the stories. Like other reviewers have pointed out, there is almost nothing about the personal life of Vera or any of her staff. So each 92 minute story stands on its own and they can be watched in any order.

The DVD will be released on September 29, 2015. I was provided an advance copy in exchange for an objective review.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7030076,5,B00U7DLSVK,"DCI Vera Stanhope is rough, untidy, obsessed. She wears a Mackintosh & floppy hat. She's a female Columbo. She's a determined sleuth, aging but tough enough, most days. This new set has 4 episodes [WITH SUBTITLES]. Teens and older recommended for violent disturbing scenes. Characters are adapted after Ann Cleeves' mysteries. The Northumberland filming locale & settings are an enchanting backdrop, but crime riddled. Cases are as violent as the country is ruggedly beautiful.

Brenda Blethyn (Atonement, Pride & Prejudice) as Vera, convincingly leads the team. Forensics via Dr Marcus Summer (Kingsley Ben-Adir) and DC Kenny Lockhart (Jon Morrison) return in all 4 eps. DC Mark Edwards (Riley Jones) is back in 3 eps. Appearing in all 4 is lovely DC Bethany Whelan (Cush Jumbo) who returns from a past season, and 2 new faces, DS Aiden Healy (Kenny Doughty) as Vera's assistant, and Helen (Lisa Hammond -`Bleak House') a handicapped techy guru. Strong acting and vivid drama in every episode.

SUBTITLES available/optional for all episodes in set 5
1===Changing Tides
Vera investigates a multi-caravan park fire that kills. Another unit was growing weed. Vera's new assistant is a bit confrontational, not yet aware of his boss's quirks, personality, and detecting style. See Katherine Rose Morley (`The Mill' `Last Tango in Halifax').
2===Old Wounds
A teen skeleton found in a wood gets Vera's team onto a 30 year cold case. ID-ed as a missing miner's daughter forces the team to review strike activity of the past.
 3===Muddy Waters
A body floats up in a dairy farm waste pit. Foreign farm day help, farm family, and gypsy travelers all fall on the suspect list. Was it the farmer (Mark Bonnar -`The Paradise' `Line of Duty')?
 4===Shadows in the Sky
A Newcastle multi-level parking garage's victim falls to death. Could be suicide--or was he pushed? A long list of family & coworker enemies appear as murder suspects while secrets unravel. Raquel Cassidy (`Downton Abbey' `Land Girls') is a guest star. The best episode of a truly great finish to a grand season.

7030078,5,B00U7DLSVK,"Brenda Blethyn returns in the titular role of Vera in Number 5 of this excellent (dare of say brilliant) British detective series. She plays the part of DCI Vera Stanhope with gusto and relentlessly pursues a case until she and her colleagues get their man or woman.  This is not the cerebral character of Agatha Christie's Poirot or Miss Marple. Vera is reminiscent of a slightly less rumpled Peter Falk of Columbo fame. Indeed, Vera balances an aggressive and almost motherly approach as she vigorously conducts an investigation until she wears down anyone she has to (including her own staff) in order to catch the guilty party. Her sidekick and sometime ""legman"" is now capably played by Kenny Doughty (The Couple, etc.) as new recruit DS Aiden Healy. Doughty replaces David Leon (another fine actor - see IMDb) who played the same role as Joe in the previous 4 Series. This new Series contains 4 Episodes, as did its predecessors. However, there are two very important new features: 1) It is now far easier to
get the Sub-titles to work which is absolutely essential if you don't want to miss any of the dialogue given the northeastern accent of the British Isles; 2) There is also an audio accompaniment if you wish to use it. A male or female narrator describes much that is going on which adds a great deal to the visual presentation. This addition may be there to allow anyone with a sight impairment to follow the story as well. Series 5 is also somewhat brighter and more colorful and not as dreary as the first 4 Series which gave the
impression that it was always wintry and frequently rainy.  The 4 Episodes, which I will list below, are based upon characters
created by Ann Cleeves but the style of Series 5 is seamless with respect to the previous 4. Both Doughty (who is given a summary back story in order for the viewer to better relate to him and understand his behavior) and newbie Lisa Hammond as Intelligence Officer Helen Milton (who is in a wheelchair but might as well be a motor bike) comport themselves quite well. As for the stories: To quote from a popular Summer TV show: ""Be prepared to expect the unexpected."" There are plenty of false trails and ""red herrings"". Yet, everything makes sense in the end and the viewer will not be deliberately misled.  The twists and turns that lead to the final denouement make it all worthwhile. And Vera & Co. are real 3-dimensional people. Without giving away any ""Spoilers"", here are the 4 Episodes that comprise Vera 5 with a bit of a tease of inducement: 1) ""Changing Tides"", which opens with an explosion in a Caravan Park (read Mobile Home) that claims one victim. Was it an accident or murder?  2) ""Old Wounds"", which opens with a skull being found in some muck in the midst of a forest. This leads to an investigation into a 30 year-old cold case. 3) ""Muddy Waters"" (my personal favorite), which - after some preliminary opening scenes - leads to the discovery of a body in a farming slurry pit (a mixture of water, cement, and other material). Who is it, how did it get there, and why? These are the questions that Vera, et al. must then answer. 4) ""Shadows in the Sky"", which is perhaps the most convoluted episode of all which only makes it that much more challenging. A man suddenly falls from the top of a Parking Garage  and lands on his back on the front of a car parked below in the street.  Is it murder or a suicide?
A final note: There is a nod to David Leon who played Joe when Vera mentions that he got a promotion elsewhere and also has his hands full with wife and family. Cheers!",1441584000,10,3571,4.520123839009288
