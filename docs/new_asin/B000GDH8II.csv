This is all about Manny though,which is why i like it so much!!!All i can say,is he is CRAZY.This has a lot of intense moments in it,and Manny is very brave,as well as knowledgeable!!I would recommend anyone to buy this if you like action packed wildlife footage,a long with his show from the Outdoor channel. I know you will enjoy them both! I can't wait for more to come from Manny!!!!!!!",1311811200,,502,4.239583333333333
2604795,5,B000GDH8II,"I actually had the pleasure of Meeting Manny Puig (a Fellow Cuban) Who autographed this dvd for me and my brother. this guy knows what he is doing
and is great at it, you will see sharks, Gators in here, Manny A Fellow Miamian and Cool Cubiche is in his zone. Highly Recommended and do NOT try it at home or anywhere, leave it to the pro's.!",1242000000,2,341,4.104477611940299
2604796,3,B000GDH8II,"Fans of MTV's The Wild Boys know exactly who ""The SharkMan"" is. Manny Puigs adventure on the WB's is what made the show watchable through all the male nudity. Manny has the reputation for only being interested in extremely dangerous creatures, he's quoted as saying ""if it can't kill you i'm not interested in it"". With an attitude like that I was ready for some intense footage, and there are certainly some hair raising moments. But the problem is alot of it is extra footage from the Wild Boys tv series.  Now that's not bad if you never saw the WB's, or are a devote fan who just can't get enough Jackass inspired material. But I was hopeing for all new Manny. There could also be more educational conversation, most encounters are merely touch it and run before it can kill you. It does do a good job of introducing Manny to an new audience through candid interviews with Manny and several Jackass alumni, but falls into the norm of people who do crazy things to, or with dangerous animals.",1227571200,,995,4.527777777777778
2604797,5,B000GDH8II,"There are parts of this film that left me shaking my head in amazement.  I have never seen anything like it.  I did feel that the Jackass tie in kind of added an element of stupidity, but make no mistake about it---Manny Puig and Mark Rackley are in a league of their own when it comes to this kind of stuff.  I highly recommend this DVD if you enjoy watching people interact with dangerous animals.",1214784000,,399,4.293333333333333
2604798,5,B000GDH8II,"Forget about Jackass and the Wildboyz, this documentary is solely about Manny Puig!

The DVD boasts Johnny Knoxville's name, but the entire DVD is Manny being Manny.

This documentary tells the story of Manny's life, his triumphs and defeats with the wild. Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O and the rest of the gang tell their stories about Manny throughout the movie.

Manny isn't some wannabe that got famous on Jackass, he is the real deal.
A professional in his field. He spent years developing his techniques and loves all the creatures that he studies.

If you love nature, the wild and those who try to tame it, Ultimate Predator ""Manny Puig"" is for you!!",1210636800,3,654,4.8125
2604799,5,B000GDH8II,"This is a great documentary that the whole family can enjoy. Its got romance, adventure, and of course, all types of predators. But seriously, this is crazy stuff. Manny has no fear and all other nature guys pale in comparison to his greatness. Even that guy, you know the guy, yeah well all I can say is that Manny wouldn't take any guff from a stingray. Anyway, you won't be disappointed.",1167782400,4,390,4.507042253521127
