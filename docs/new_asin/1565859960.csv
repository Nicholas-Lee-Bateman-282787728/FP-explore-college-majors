7796596,2,1565859960,"I was looking forward to this course because I have enjoyed other history courses. However, this professor not only swayed back and forth but he appeared to be projecting his voice to the back of he studio as if he were in a classroom. It would be more enjoyable if he modulated his voice and used the microphone.  Usually I can almost binge watch these lectures but I was lucky to get through one at a time. It's too bad because the subject is fascinating.",1515456000,,457,4.376470588235295
7796597,3,1565859960,"The materials is good. It is a little overwhelming even for a history teacher to comprehend in one sitting.
The professor sways to the left then to the right while speaking causing distraction. Rufus Fear's DVD a far better for the history lover.",1506384000,,246,4.744186046511628
7796598,5,1565859960,"I had studied the topic covered in these lectures before in a variety of ways. Nonetheless, it doesn't make any difference how much one has ""learned"", there is always more to learn. That said, I especially appreciated this course. I feel I learned much that I hadn't before, and remembered much I had ""forgotten.""  The lecturer clearly knows his topic. What's more, he loves it. He gave an expansive overview of each of the issues: the French Revolution, the industrial revolution, the impact economics have on the world situation, the rise of ""nationalism"" in Germany, the Piedmontization of the Italy, the events leading to WWI, the loss of hope and dreams afterwards, the impact of trade on international relations, the perceived need of empire and consequences ... All this and more is covered in these lectures. I can honestly say that Professor Robert I Weiner is one of my favorite lecturers in the Great Courses, and I own very many. I never settle for a one time listen/watch, and I will certaily be reviewing these lectures again. Another benefit from the Great Courses is the bibliography. I have had many great reads because I bought the books the lecturer suggested, listed in the accompanying booklet along with the outline.",1491004800,,1238,4.923444976076555
7796599,5,1565859960,"This superseded my expectations. The time period is covered about as fully and compactly as could covered in such a project. In my view the professor was engaging (although I could certainly fathom a differing opinion in that regard), and explained big ideas in a constructive way, not getting bogged down in too many specific details.

This is definitely an academic project (as most of the history great courses are), while technically still being a ""survey"" type of course. If you have basic history down, then you should find this interesting (assuming you enjoy European history).",1457568000,2,585,5.09375
7796600,5,1565859960,"This course looks at one of the most important times in Western history: the tumultuous change in Europe wrought from the French Revolution to the outbreak of The Great War. The professor goes into great depth of the intricate power plays, periodic revolutions and uneasy peaces of this period.",1195862400,6,294,5.020408163265306
