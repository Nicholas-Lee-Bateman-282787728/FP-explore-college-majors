The picture quality was good, I watched it anyway in silence cause I had done spent money on it but I was very disappointed.",1373328000,,260,4.553191489361702
8236495,5,B00101ED7Y,"I do not have the DVD yet; I TiVo'd the game, and have just now ordered this DVD to be able to free up the hard-drive.  But this was a superb game, with the added bonus, of course, of seeing the Badgers take their second-in-a-row national championship.  A word for those either not familiar with the women's game, or confused as to this point:  The women's game is a much better brand of hockey than the men's game.  As Cammi Granato put it during one of the recent USA women's games at this year's Winter Olympics, because the women's game doesn't allow checking, you see a lot more finesse.  Translation:  ALL these women have to be able to skate extremely well, and to pass extremely well, as well as score.  The women's hockey game is what hockey is supposed to be, and it is beautiful to watch.  An aside:  The NHL is dying, financially.  They still ""think"" that what hockey fans want to see is hitting and fighting.  All they would need to do to turn their fortunes around would be to adopt the rules of the women's game.  Unfortunately, they're just not that smart.",1270512000,,1072,4.441025641025641
