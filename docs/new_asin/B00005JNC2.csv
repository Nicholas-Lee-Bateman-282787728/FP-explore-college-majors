1515209,5,B00005JNC2,"...Garden State is a great movie.  It's not an ""original"" idea.  It's someone looking for someething and finding it.  The part that makes this movie stand out so much to me is the feeling of REAL that is in it and the rich performances from the actors in the film.  Give it a shot - it's worth the sit!!",1098489600,6,303,4.084745762711864
1515210,5,B00005JNC2,"To live in Los Angeles, one has to put themselves into a Garden State just to emotionaly survive the day -  Zach Braff has an amazing eye for everyday american life, especially the long road home of searching for ones self...  This has been the most gratifying movie experience I have had in 2004.  I hope Zach makes many more films from the heart-

1515211,4,B00005JNC2,"I loved this movie, mostly because it wasn't a polished pop-tart package but, rather, a portrait of where I found myself in life on the day of its release.

Zach Braff is a genius, and he's pretty hot, too. He plays the role of Large superbly -- on the silver screen, you look into his eyes and just see his confusion and apathy and yet his spark that keeps him going.

The real selling point of the movie, though, is its soundtrack, which literally picks you up and transports you through the rabbit hole that is Large's life. All I have to do is hear the opening chords of Frou Frou's ""Let Go,"" and I remember sitting in the theater, thinking, ""Yeah! I feel like that sometimes, too!""

This film is probably more for the Gen X and Y set, and I think it's one we will watch over and over again once we can own it in our personal collections. I, myself, will keep it next to my copy of ""Reality Bites"" -- every 10 years, a movie seems to come along that I deem as my ""functional"" movie, and ""Garden State"" very accurately captured my confusion, my heartbreak, my hope and my fears and let me know it's OK to not know where you're going next, just as long as you don't stand still and let the decisions be made on your behalf.",1097798400,6,1225,4.2042553191489365
1515212,4,B00005JNC2,"In a nutshell, this is a very worthy rental even if it doesn't quite live up to the odes hailed by critics. In fact the general tempo of Garden State is reminiscent of a recent film with similar idiosynchratic tones, The Station Agent.

But director/writer/actor Braff's ability to underplay his befuddled stance in the midst of wacky comedy without appearing silly himself, is quite impressive. His sublime sensibility permeates the entire film as our protagonist visits his mother's house after a patch of nine years to attend her funeral, in the process reuniting with his old high school buddies as well as his family.

The characters are interestingly quirky, some less hokey than others, but I couldn't help leaving with an intense personal disdain for Natalie Portman and her incredulous antics.

The humour is endearing and generally clever, plus we get a certain ""detour"" that turns out to be thematically quite relevant. Much of the film's fizz wears out by the tail end though.

A word for the soundtrack: it is stellar, throwing into the fray some cool chill-out inputs from Zero 7 and Coldplay. I recommend it more than the film itself, get a copy if you like your music relaxed and downtempo.

Overall, Garden State is a likeable little charmer with incidental pleasures, but it's not quite the cinematic Eden that critics promised. Recommended rental.",1097280000,100,1366,5.0
1515213,4,B00005JNC2,"Zach Braff, he was on ""Scrubs"" they tell me it was a T.V. show, wrote, directed, and plays Andrew Largeman--affectionately known as Large to his friends--in this offbeat comedy.  The film is similar in both style and story to ""The Graduate"" (A Simon and Garfunkel track is even used at one point) and at times resembles a Wes Anderson film.

  The film opens with an obvious dream sequence which ends when Large is awakened by a phone call from his father (Ian Holm).  Large's mother has drowned and he most return home for the funeral.  In the next few scenes we learn that his mom was a paraplegic--ahh the plot thickens-- and that he's on a lot of drugs.  In fact, Large is basically in a Lithium induced coma that has made him numb to the world for most of his life. While home he hangs out with old friends who spend their days doing nothing before drinking and drugging away their nights, meets Sam (Natalie Portman) a somewhat strange girl with her own medical problems, and comes to grip with his life/problems.

  The film moves at a moderately slow, but steady pace and its scored with a superlative soundtrack thats very effective. Its rarely, if ever, dull, quite funny, very refreshing, sad at times, always unpredictable and excitingly original.  If you're under thirty you will love this film.",1096588800,7,1308,4.668122270742358
1515214,1,B00005JNC2,"Not even mildly entertaining.  Weak script.  Story that's been done by many.  Obnoxious performance by Natalie Portman.  Just very, very bad.",1096329600,15,141,5.571428571428571
1515215,5,B00005JNC2,"I found so much of this movie answered the questions i had been having in my life.  It made me feel so good about what I have and ok with what I don't have.  It made me see what is important in life.  It sounds cliche to the maximum, but I laughed, I cried, and.....well I laughed more than I cried, but I left the theater (twice) with a complete and utter sense of awe.  This is a spectacular movie.",1096243200,53,400,3.9625
1515216,5,B00005JNC2,My girlfriend and I became so obsessed with this film that we drove 100 miles to see it in Hollywood four times since it wasn't showing in our town. We then saw it two more times when our town finally began showing it. The film is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again and never tire of it. The soundtrack is also very well put-together and makes each scene that much more enjoyable.,1096243200,24,399,4.128205128205129
1515217,5,B00005JNC2,"This was an amazing movie.  I think first time writer and director Zach Braff did a wonderful job.  The movie was perfectly cast.  Natalie Portman's character was so real and alive that it seemed as though she was not even acting.

I saw the movie when questioning things in my life and I felt as though it helped me.  It is like watching someone come to life and seeing just how important living and feeling every emotion is.  Braff was great and I will purchase this movie as soon as it is released.

The soundtrack is also perfect.  Each song matches each scene and gives a feel for what is going on.  I recommend purchasing the soundtrack, I did and I love it.  Go see this movie!",1095897600,5,684,4.31496062992126
1515325,5,B00005JNC2,"Weird and Wonderful! Quirky and Quotable! Off-beat and Outstanding! Alliteration aside, I love watching this movie, but then, I always loved Braff's humor in Scrubs. Zach and Natalie have fabulous chemistry that works flawlessly in this film. My daughter doesn't like it because of the dark humor and ""sad parts"" but it's a keeper for me!",1515024000,,338,5.053571428571429
1515326,5,B00005JNC2,"One of my all time favorites. The movie gets the 5 stars. Zero stars for offering it on BluRay which implies HD. The image quality seems slightly worse than DVD. Personally I would watch this movie on VHS using one of those old tv/radio combos as the screen and love it all the same. I do feel deceived with it branded as BluRay though. Yay Zach and Natalie, BOOOO 20th Century Fox.

1515437,5,B00005JNC2,"Zach Braff is a tremendously talented actor as evidenced by the way he is subsumed by the characters he portrays. He is one of the few actors who is able to assume a protagonist's role and lose himself in it. Tom Hanks? Nopeall I see is Tom Hanks. Same with Mel Gibson and Kevin Costner and most other actors. Tom Cruise? From time to time. But Zach Braff? Always.

More surprising, or welcome, is the quirky, off-center, but somehow completely stable character played by Natalie Portman. I found her work in the STAR WARS movies plodding and flat, but she is at her best in small independent movies where her own unique personality can flourish. This is one of those.

OK, on to the movie itself. If you like your stories with a defined beginning and a completely resolved and happy ending, then this may not be for you. Think ""happier"" DONNIE DARKO and you'll have a bit of a feel for this movie. Though DARKO had its light moments (yeah, I went there), it was still mostly a fascinating downer. This one is more of a twisted and poignant upper. It can't be described as well as a typical movie because, well, it isn't typical.

If you like to see people suddenly breaking into dance and song for no discernible reason, if you see nothing inherently dangerous about singing and sliding on the edge of a giant waste dump that could suddenly engulf you whole, and you think jokes about psychiatrists are funny, then you will absolutely love this movie. Bonus points for including a scene with a knight in shining armor. There's too little of that in cinema. Though I did notice there were no cowbells anywhere.

An absolute gem.",1491523200,4,1628,4.565068493150685

1515483,5,B00005JNC2,"As writer, director, star, Zach Braff can navigate the most uproarious, still sophisticated, often dark, humor and the most intensely serious to tragic content, spanning that range with unique dexterity.  Here, as the story begins, Andrew Largeman (Braff) appears blank, expressionless, seated on a plane experiencing wild turbulence, everyone screaming, oxygen masks deployed.  He receives a call in which he learns his mother has died -- still blank. Bottles lined up edge to edge in his medicine cabinet suggest he may be seriously overmedicated.  We're immediately transported to his mother's funeral, where an older woman with a heavy New York accent sings ""You're Once,Twice,Three Times a Lady, tremulously and grotesquely off key. This same woman, while sitting shiva, proudly presents Andrew with a special shirt matching the pattern of the newly-papered hall bathroom; a closeup captures him blending into the wall with his head appearing as a hanging object. And that's in the first few minutes. But just as we're about to laugh again, and we will intermittently, a very serious and important story emerges. I won't reveal more. Natalie Portman is brilliant as his costar. All the acting is first-rate, as are all  filmmaking disciplines. This is an exceptional film to be seen more than once, over time. Another favorite of mine, in which Braff also writes, directs and stars, is ""Wish I Was Here,"" which can also handle multiple viewings.  I highly recommend both.",1488067200,3,1476,5.237288135593221

1515492,2,B00005JNC2,"I like Zach Braff and usually find him whimsical and entertaining, so I looked forward to this movie.  Sadly, I found it disappointing and pointless.  It seemed like a series of mostly disconnected episodes strung loosely together.  It was a collection of potentially promising sketches which lead nowhere.  For example, one of the hero's friends has a mother who is in a relationship with a fake knight who works at Medieval Times and speaks Klingon; we never see him again, and nothing comes of it.  The hero visits a couple who live in a boat near a quarry, and they are interesting, but nothing comes of it.  Basically, nothing comes of the movie--it's a bunch of quirky characters in search of a storyline which never materializes.  I bought the movie at half price, and that was half too much.",1480550400,,799,4.705035971223022

1515568,5,B00005JNC2,"I have enjoyed this movie several times.  Zach Braff and Natalie Portman portrayed two wounded characters who fall together under challenging circumstances.  Both play delightfully delicate, understated characters that grow on you.  This is not your normal romantic drama, and the story does not move as quickly as some people might wish it to.

I have no idea why it's so popular, because even as it bills itself as ""quirky"" or ""unique"", much like its characters, the movie manages to be generic and predictable instead.

1516104,5,B00005JNC2,"This isn't a review of the movie... because I CAN'T WATCH IT!  I tried renting it.  Then I tried to ""download"" it to a PC for my daughter to watch during a trip we were making over Thanksgiving, but after doing so, I realized that I no longer had a PC with the ""name"" I selected to download it to (this was an actual option from the movie rental screen).  To add insult to injury, I cannot find any place to set up a new ""PC"" to download it to.

Now the movie is in ""limbo"".  My daughter can't watch it streaming and couldn't watch it as a ""download"", so I've paid the rental feel for this movie, but Amazon won't allow us to watch it.  Also, keep in mind that even with a ""download"", the DRM is set to expire at the end of the rental period, so why not allow ""downloading"" to as many PCs as I have (or can) set up... or at least more than only one!

My daughter has seen it before so I'm giving the movie itself a 5 star rating because she loves it.  However, Amazon REALLY needs to get their act together on the whole ""download"" vs. streaming thing.  I cannot see ANY reason why I couldn't download the movie (it has NEVER been downloaded) AND/OR watch it streaming.  Especially if the download never occurred!

Also, if it is an ""either/or"" situation, Amazon should have warned me before I selected to ""download"" the movie.  Also, they REALLY need to make the add a PC and/or the download to a PC much more flexible.  This was a real disappointment for both my daughter and myself (because I had to listen to her complain about not being able to watch it.

The plot is not super interesting or compelling, its more of the characters that give this movie character (see what i did there). Zach Braff's character is very relatable, as he struggles with anxiety and depression and parental problems that many of us humans have also experienced. Natalie Portman's character on the other hand is a classic un-relatable quirky manic pixie dream girl. It feels more like she was written to fix Zach Braff's problems than to be her own character, which is a little disappointing in my opinion. Not really well written female characters, but also not the worst movie in the world. I say give it a try.",1414540800,,855,4.5519480519480515

The movie takes it's time and calmly portrays the crazy lives of these folks in a subtle, yet interesting way. No one thinks themselves as odd, but everyone around them does. But it's ok and friends just accept the strangeness of others without trying to change anyone.  The main character is the only one who can't accept himself as he is, even though everyone around him does. Eventually he realizes his problems aren't going away and he can enjoy his life without regret and feeling like a failure all the time.

1516612,4,B00005JNC2,"The first half hour of Zack Braffs debut as a writer and director establishes him as a filmmaker of immense talent, and I hope hell get to make more films soon.  It's opening act high captures a youthful sense of upper-middle class depression, alienation and ennui as well as Ive seen, with comedy that makes you hurt inside, and inventive visual story telling.

After that the film comes down to earth somewhat, but its still full of goodies. Peter Saarsgaurd in particular creates an unforgettable supporting character while being complexly understated.

This story of an depressed actor in his late 20s returning home after 9 years has a lovely mix of quirky humor, and well-earned sadness. Braff satirizes small town America without putting it down, and pokes fun at depression and family tragedy without it feeling shallow - neither very easy feats.  Great use of music as well.

Where the film falters for me is in the love story, which feels bizarrely familiar and unimaginative compared to the storytelling  all around it.  Also, while both fine actors, I never really felt any great chemistry between Braff and Natalie Portman.  In some ways Braff's relationship with Saarsguard feels more nuanced. Last, Portmans character feels so young, so unformed next to Braff that its hard to believe shes ready for a serious relationship.

The very end has received some justifiable carping from critics as a bit of a cop out, but it didn't bother me nearly as much as such things usually do.

But all that said, this is a terrific debut film, and a terrific film about being young and lost.",1383350400,3,1591,4.859259259259259

It is the story of a kid who turns out to have had issues with depression who comes back to New Jersey to attend his mom's funeral. Along the way, he reconnects with a few old friends and classmates and teams up with a quirky girl played by Natalie Portman. Much of the movie has a very subdued tone which sort of emphasizes a feeling of numbness surrounding the main character and his father. A couple of scenes in the movie have a somewhat surreal tone to them either because of the backdrop of because of what happens in them. In the end, most of the characters seem likable, even a few who appear to be unsavory at first. There are a few scenes in the movie that portray drug use or sex which, for me, detracted somewhat from the plot, but they are not the main focus of the film. While there is a romantic side to the film, it's more of a story of how someone who is numb to the reality of his former life manages to reconnect to reality and his past.",1373068800,,1017,4.141414141414141

When I watch really old movies what strikes me is they had to depend on interaction of the characters and plot development to be a success.  This movie was about dialogue and plot rather than car chases and super heroes.  That was refreshing.  You get to like and understand the characters as the movie progresses so the movie gets better as the plot progresses.  There was a lot of foul language and I'm not sure that was needed to enhance the movie but it wasn't over the top.  The relationship between the main characters was really genuine and they didn't hop into bed first thing and that was a plus.

Rated R. (off color moments)

Spectacularly quirky Indie film with something important to say.
Let's face it, the advent of silent Velcro rocks but the random abyss may not
be so random after all.
Hilarious. sad, romantic, odd, charming and brilliant. New every time I see it.
So many keen observations and weird ideas, and NO stupidly gratuitous
sex scenes.
Garden State is about as irresistible as an offbeat film can possibly get.
Highly original and free spirited. Unpredictably off the wall and breezy with no cookie cutter
characters. It is definitely its own brand of movie, so very original and thought
provoking throughout, with a real heartfelt bent.
The scene in the doctor office waiting room with the dog is a real hoot.

1516798,3,B00005JNC2,"I am a fan of Zach Braff and I think that he's very funny, but this movie did not make much of an impression on me. At times, it can be very funny, but this is outweighed by a stifling layer of depression that coats everything throughout. I believe it was supposed to ultimately be an uplifting tale of finding one's own place in the world, standing up for yourself, etc., but this is tarnished by the fact that every character is self-centered nearly to the point of narcissism. Particularly bad was the character who lives with his mom, digs graves for a living, ROBS the dead of their jewelry, and shoplifts in his spare time... and yet, this is a character that we're supposed to feel sympathy for, and applaud his supposedly noble deed at the end of the movie (which I will not spoil here).

As for Zach's character, he spends so much time feeling sorry for himself, wallowing about, and disregarding responsibility, I simply couldn't get on board with him. I get it: You're twenty something and depressed, because you don't know what to do with your life and what the future might hold. But this is incredibly boring (especially after an hour and forty minutes), and it inspired pity for the character, not empathy. I suppose if you're currently in that state of being, this movie may offer more value to you, though I fear it may just serve to depress you further (""spoiler"": Natalie Portman will not suddenly appear in your own life to magically rescue you from your depression).",1356912000,,1487,4.611320754716981

This is a great movie. Over the years I've come to realize that Natalie Portman doesn't do bad movies. This is no exception. It's a very cute romantic comedy.

There he meets impetuous, sweet and adorable Sam (Natalie Portman), a compulsive liar and epileptic who is far from numb. Their relationship helps him wake up and face his pain.

1516843,1,B00005JNC2,"Zach Braff, tired of being lively and appealing on Scrubs, decided to do a 180 in his first (and hopefully last) feature film, where an emotionally stunted waiter (who's an aspiring actor) goes home after news that his mother has died; and here we follow the exciti-mind numbingly dull adventures of a narcissistic whiner who's unhappy (cue the violin).

Here's a summary of Zach Braff's emotional range in Garden State: =I. Actually I think that emoticon had a little more range to it but basically Zach Braff looks bored or high or something throughout his movie. The hip fanboys will probably argue that the reason Zach Braff doesn't emote much is because he doesn't know how to express himself but unless you count dressing up in garbage bags and yelling into a hole, Zach Braff never shows any emotion or revelation or whatever the movie was going for, and it seems like an excuse for him to smoke a joint or whatever during the shooting (and probably pushing his crappy music on Natalie Portman).

In fact it's not just Zach Braff's lack of acting, the whole movie just reeks of laziness. The set designs are boring and uninteresting, the directing is bland and completely uninspired, and the writing is typical indie garbage about *slightly* dysfunctional people doing *quirky* things like crying over a pet cemetary or wearing a shirt that matches the wall; wow, that's so deep/clever/original Zach Braff, anything else to say in your bloated turd of a movie besides 'let the little stuff go'? No? Wow, it's like a 2 hour fortune cookie, how deep man.

It has a slightly melancholic undertone to it which tends to make the relationships and storyline that little bit more poignant. It also has some funny laugh out loud moments, so you get a good mix of emotions in the one film. What's more it has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a film for ages.

Not only does it have Natalie Portman in it, but it's one of those rare movies which really combines a good story with good, maybe even seminal, humor. It's also full of really amazing observations, an outstanding script, also by Braff.  Different and enjoyable, dunno why it was not bigger. Perhaps because it plays at a slower tempo than movies tend to do these days, but I think it was absolutely the right choice.

I thought I read where this was Braff's THX1138 (aka college idea). Hope there is more coming. Scrubs was very good and now over. His second film had the independent feel but was unremarkable enough for me that I don't remember the name. I thought he might have been coasting with Scrubs for the last 2 yrs or so and I don't blame him. Time to step up Zach!

Cast was perfect. Can Portman be any more attractive or interesting? No plastic needed for her beauty. Smart and pretty. Sarsgaard's semi dark role was spot on. Dude in the suit of armor was surreal. Not a clunker in the lot.

1516931,3,B00005JNC2,"Continuing on in my `all things Sarsgaard' I'm actually getting to one of his greatest performances; yet sadly it is not in one of his better films.

Coming off as more of a gimmick than anything substantial, `Garden State' is one of those cult films with very rabid and devoted fans as well as very cruel and hatful detractors.  I am one on the fence.  I enjoy the film, and I remember when it came out I actually loved it and found it an amalgam of jovial fun; but as the years have gone by my adoration for the film has melted away to uncover a mere toleration of it.  It remains one of those clever films that, over time, proves itself less clever and more pretentious and even superficial.

The film follows an actor who is distanced from his former life only to get thrust back in when his mother dies.  Nine years removed from all he used to know he is know stuck in a town he wants to forget, with an angry father and aimless friends and an intriguing girl who holds the key to release his inner contentment.

I really like Zach Braff as an actor.  In fact, even here I really like him.  In fact, to be honest, the acting in this film is rather remarkable from all parties.  The thing is, Zach doesn't understand how to make a complete story.  He was so focused on creating a visually appealing film complete with `hip' music and clever tricks that he lost focus on creating a moving STORY.  It is generic and serviceable, but it becomes overwhelmed by the visual impact of the film.  I do wholly believe that some of the best films are built around beautifully constructed sequences of memorable events, even if those events are mere images that burrow themselves in our mind and keep us in rapt attention, but where `Garden State' fails to live up is in the area of cementing those `sequences' with heartfelt purpose.

The film winds up becoming forgettable.  I remember the pool sequence (a sublime example of `beautifully constructed sequences') but I don't know why (thus proving that it wasn't a `memorable event').

Like I said, the acting is sublime.  Natalie Portman was nominated for an Oscar this year for her work in `Closer'.  Both her performances are vastly different and both are career highlights for her.  She is stunning here as the hyper Sam, an intriguing character with flaws and demons of her own.  To me though, this film belongs to Sarsgaard, who just shimmers in all sorts of glory as the aimlessly charismatic Mark.  He steals every scene he is in and just proves that a great performance can help carry a rather shallow film.  When you couple this with his breathtaking work in `Kinsey' it becomes clear that Sarsgaard was the man in 2004.

How Oscar eludes him still is baffling to me.

So, I can understand the draw for this film, but I strongly feel that the love for it is blind.  It is visually compelling, and the acting is stellar, and that soundtrack is very, very likable; but the lack of substance becomes apparent ones the glossy veneer fades away and we are left with only half the movie we vaguely remember enjoying.",1257292800,,3065,4.519056261343013
1516932,5,B00005JNC2,"Garden State was a movie I had not heard of when I first watched it. I found myself drawn in by real down to Earth characters with believe problems, like self esteem, death and changes in ones self. Zach Braff and Natalie Portman give performances that are hilarious and touching. You get the sadness in Sam's eyes and you can see how annoyed Andrew is with his friends that just haven't learned to grow up. I would recommend this movie to anyone who like a good story to add to their collection.",1256601600,,496,4.4021739130434785
1516933,5,B00005JNC2,"Another reviewer called this a ""coming of age"" story.  I think it's a coming-to-life story....something that some people never do, at any age.  I've read the staggering statisics of the number of people on medication, legal and illegal in our fair land, and it's not a pretty fact. To reduce the film to it's basic message: it's better to face the pain of life--that's where the joy is.  But it's so much more than a message film.

This is a deceptively simple story but it's so wise and so well told that it really touches the heart.  I don't have TV so I didn't know who Zach Braff was.  Now I do!  I will look for his work in the future.

I won't re-tell the story because it's been told enough times here.
I just want to add my applause to the others'.  Braff very skillfully walks the line between humour and pathos.  His character has been likened to that of Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate"" but I think this is much better.  The whole cast is super.  It was great to see the wonderful Jean Smart in a small role, as the mom of his grave-robbing buddy.  Ian Holm plays his father, an unsympathetic character, in a very human way that does give the viewer the glimpse of a fundamentally decent man who is as lost in the events of his life as everyone else.

Much of the joy and magic of the film goes to Natalie Portman who plays the wonderfully screwy epileptic girl, Sam, who helps the Braff character come back to life.  The role is well written but it could have been butchered in the hands of a lesser actress.  I just saw her in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" where I didn't much like her, so I was amazed at how good she was here.  Her naturalness really made the character touch your heart.  This is the sign of a good actress and good direction.

There's more I could say but there are a lot of excellent reviews here.  I predict this film will become a classic, 'cuz it has such enduring qualities of real humanity, humour, wisdom and warmth.

1516935,5,B00005JNC2,"Garden State is a flat-out great film. I often talk about films with simple but altogether moving stories, like The Breakfast Club and Adventureland. This more than falls into that category. This is one of the finest first features from any director since Sam Mendes' American Beauty. I know that's saying alot, but Braff lives up to it. It's nothing less than a stroke of genius when a filmmaker so clearly defines himself with only one picture under his belt.

The film centers around the homecoming of Andrew Largeman, a second-rate Hollywood actor who's been over-medicated by his psychiatrist father since his pre-teen years when he was blamed for the crippling of his mother. Now his mother had died, and Andrew is coming back to Jersey for the first time in 9 years. He encounters high school friends, many of them trying to mooch off his ""status"" back in Hollywood(possibly a commentary on Braff's own personal life being a well known actor), but he also meet a few worthwhile people, one of them being Sam, a quirkier-than-thou girl(but one with a true soul that's uncovered not-too-late in the film) who seems to be the first person in Andrew's life that tries to dig deep into him to find his true spirit. She is MUCH more than a ""love interest"".

This film is truly about renewed life; Andrew gets rid of the drugs that has paralyzed his mind in the same way his mother's body was, he breathes true air for the first time, and finds that life might actually be worth living. That last message should be enough to warrant that you see this film if you haven't; it's inspired me to find the joy in life more than anything in recent memory. As for Zach Braff, I owe a huge debt to him; his next directorial project might be upcoming in 2 years(though it's been put on hold numerous times), but even if he never does direct another film, then I will still be eternally satisfied by this golden staple of independent film.",1246838400,2,1929,4.604651162790698

1516938,5,B00005JNC2,"Garden State is certainly more than the sum of its parts.  What I love so much about this movie is that it doesn't condescend, by explaining to us every little detail but letting us feel this eerily real couple of days experienced by Zach Braff and Natalie Portman.  The beautiful backdrops and cinematography would initially make you feel distant and disconnected from the characters or the places you are watching, but the feeling is intentional in replicating the psychological displacement the characters feel at home.  You feel at ease again when the story beautifully undulates and cleanly unfolds, again treating you like an adult.  The movie is like a great book to cozy up with and a coming-of-age story you will find comfort and commonality in.

1516989,1,B00005JNC2,"The Garden State is one of the most pretentious movies of all time.  From first hand knowledge of living in LA, Zach got the entire soundtrack from KCRW, the local ""hip"" music station in the area.  It's like a bad playlist for the show ""morning becomes eclectic.""

Did you know that the movie was ""sold"" to movie producers when Mr. Braff sent them mix cds of the soundtrack?  That spells disaster to me, when a movie is green lit without more than just a ""I know how this is going to make me feel"" outline of the movie. I think that is how Michael Bay movies are made.

I can't say anything that hasn't been said yet except this: If ever, in real life, a girl as pretty as Natalie Portman starts following you around like a lost puppy, you better watch your back son.  A girl like her SHOULD have dozens, if not dozens upon dozens of suitors.  The fact that there isn't one around AND that she prefers you, then it means shes absolutely, completely f*cking insane.  She's already scared off/killed everyone if she's now chasing after the quirky depressed boy.  Just remember, things that are too good to be true are either 1., not true or 2., in a cheesy-poorly-written-hack-of-a-director-cliched film that doen't deserve your patronage.",1238889600,7,1237,4.6118721461187215

Turns out, his wheelchair-bound Mom drowned in a newly remodeled bathroom. His Dad wants to talk, but Andrew's clearly avoiding the family scene--and has been for the past nine years.

While exploring his old home, Andrew gets caught back up in the party scene with his old friends. Some have succeeded.  Some have grown up and moved on to other careers. Yet others are pretty much the same.

While seeing a neurologist on what at first appears to be a quest for more medication, Andrew meets Sam (Natalie Portman) a young girl who at first seems completely normal, but suffers from epilepsy and compulsive lying.

As the layers of character are peeled back, you start to see both Andrew and Sam as far deeper people than the initial partying slackers.

The star, Zack Braff of ""Scrubs"" also wrote and directed this film. It's a far deeper comedy than I would have expected and also has some excellent numbers for the soundtrack.

When the action starts, a young man named Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returns home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral after being estranged from his family for nine years. Andrew has been moderately successful as an actor in California; but he is largely tormented by the pills his psychiatrist father gives him to keep him calm, or, as Andrew puts it, ""numb."" At the funeral (and after) Andrew meets up with some old buddies Mark, Dave and Jesse (Peter Sarsgaard, Alex Burns and Armando Riesco, respectively). They have some mildly fun times; but things go in a whole new direction for Andrew when he meets Samantha (Natalie Portman).

Samantha and Andrew befriend each other and slowly Samantha's warmth and natural charm make Andrew feel true emotions again; this is helped in part by Andrew's going off his medication for the first time in many years. Although Andrew feels some pain and there are ups and downs with Sam, he slowly begins to trust her and they being together as friends.

Of course, things get more complicated. What would happen if Samantha and Andrew start a romance and Andrew decides to go back to California? After all, he's only been in New Jersey four days when he has to return to his job in California. In addition, Andrew and his father (Ian Holm) have unfinished business to clear up between them--how will that work? And what about Andrew's guilt about an accident with his mother? No plot spoilers here, folks--get the movie and find out!

The DVD comes with deleted scenes, ""blooper"" scenes, a running commentary by Zach Braff and Natalie Portman, the ""making of"" extra--and more. That's very good.

Garden State is truly a film for those of us who like romantic comedies. I'm not especially wild about this genre; although I will admit that Garden State is one of the better romantic comedies out there.

1517042,1,B00005JNC2,"When I first saw the preview for Garden State, I was in awe. I thought it would give me the same melancholy satisfaction and joy as did The Royal Tenenbaums. But what I got was a terrible performance from Zach Braff, with a terrible script, and some of the most unlikable characters I've ever had the misfortune to see on the big screen. One star is far too generous. There really was not much acting involved, Braff decided to simply state all of the emotions and experiences we are supposed to see acted out. But apparently, these people were far too high and/or drunk to actually have emotions beyond Portman's random crying.

Perhaps the most frustrating part of my Garden State experience were the excellent reviews and recommendations. I've never had such an urge to tear apart the screen. The characters only seem to be capable of ""finding happiness"" through drug-use, stealing, and ignoring their problems with the aforementioned. I'm one of the most open-minded film goers in existence: There is no ""type"" or genre that doesn't have at least a few movies I love. But never have I seen something advertised as a beautiful, sensitive film about self-discovery only to find out it's nothing more than a bunch of idiotic future-alcoholics and addicts partying to forget about the things that should really matter. I have a hard time enjoying a film filled with characters I wouldn't be able to stand in real life. And ""quirky"" is not the word for this film. I love quirky. Am&eacute;lie is quirky. Edward Scissorhands is quirky. Garden State is a bad attempt at looking deep and clever by some people who seem to think the only way to ""feel alive"" is to do as many drugs as you can because they think crap like meth is better for you than antidepressants.

1517043,2,B00005JNC2,"Garden State starring Zach Braff and Natalie Portman is somewhat entertaining for the first half hour but the movie shifts and suddenly becomes a silly comedy! Braff wrote and directed this film and his performance as a numb Hollywood actor is quite good but he isn't the one who messes up the acting, that honor goes to Portman. Her performance is so childlike and idiotic, you just want her to hide under a rock. The story isn't golden or groundbreaking, the film travels through too many dynamics, I don't even know how to catergorize this film, whiny drama or pathetic dark comedy.

1517046,5,B00005JNC2,"I was walking down an alley to a car park in a neighboring town and I saw something written on one of the concrete supports of the parking structure.  I suppose I'd passed it a hundred times, but I never read it until that day, ""Good luck exploring the infinite abyss"".  I looked as it oddly because it is an odd thing to graffiti.  Later, I saw the movie Garden State and I figured out that it was not only an odd act, it was an inspired one.
  Garden State has such an amazing message attached to it as it subtly encapsulates what it feels like to be 20 something and lost.  It could be a simple throw away movie of boy meets girl, but Zack Braff puts so much heart into the script, acting and music that you can help but feel it strike a chord.  The characters slowly grow on you instead of being instantly indeared.  Every character feels real; real flaws and real beauty.  This movie may only resonate with someone that has felt like one of the main characters, but I think that is true for most things in life.  Whether you have felt so numb that you just stopped caring about life, felt like a loser towny that has to do drugs to feel good about anything,or felt like you got dealt a bad hand and you are trying to stay positive.  And how all of these different lives come together until you are screaming on top of a bull- dozer.
  I would definately recomend this movie to anyone in their teens to early 30's.  But, don't be fooled by Zach Braff's televison persona.  While there are comedic elements in the film, this is definately very dramatic.",1196985600,,1556,4.280821917808219
1517097,2,B00005JNC2,"Zach Braff (television's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scrubs/dp/B000Y856DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scrubs</a>) is without question an immense and versatile talent.  He directs, writes, and acts as the film's main protagonist in Garden State, a film with flashes of near brilliance.  He is no doubt worth looking out for and deserves quite a bit of credit.  However, Garden State should be judged as a film without taking that into account and although it does contain some genuinely sweet moments and some even better moments of natural humor, it just isn't consistent in how compelling it was for me.  I'm sure that experience will be different for everyone but to me it contains some very unlikely and unnatural moments.

Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a quasi-actor and full fledge waiter who returns to his hometown for his mother's funeral.  He stops taking his medication (he was on zoloft, depakote, and lithium among many others) and begins to awaken a little bit.  He meets old friends and reflects on his family life before he left his hometown.  He then meets a new friend named Sam (Natalie Portman) who helps him realize what is really important to him.  Although clich, the film's end is satisfying and I can't pinpoint why but I really didn't expect it from a character I didn't like very much in Largeman.

I want to believe that Garden State is semi-biographical for Braff, and it probably is (I might write a movie where I fall in love with Natalie Portman too) but if there are scenes influenced by reality, then it seems very simple to see which ones are and which ones are completely exaggerated for the sake of comedic storytelling.  The other thing that troubled me about Garden State was how selfish every character is.  It makes it very difficult to care about characters that you wouldn't have any respect for in real life.  The only exception to this Portman's Sam who is very likeable and quirky but is probably the only character that isn't based on some degree of reality.  I don't see any real serious undertones in Garden State or any real commentary beyond reflecting some aspect of real life.  It failed to do that for me and that's probably why it comes off as pretentious.  In some ways it really is only a few steps above pure teenage comedies because it wants to be adult so bad at times and maybe that is a strength for some people, but to me the way it masks its comedic goals with unconvincing drama is almost unforgivable.

Garden State is in the frame of a very good movie and for the most part I didn't think it was as bad as I'm detailing here, I think I just couldn't identify with it.  Performances from Portman, Braff, Ian Holm, Peter Saargard and others are genuine, at times amusing, and overall pretty solid.  The actors do struggle at times with the more ostentatious and less believable dialogue. Portman is especially enjoyable to watch but you really wonder how long she can be the potentially great actress everyone has been waiting for.  Despite what some people may suggest, this movie is not the vehicle for Portman's career defining star moment, which may or may not ever come.  She probably doesn't care though and is fine slumming it in quirky little films like this that have very little to say.  Anyway, it is worth watching if you like the talent in this movie.  It shows some budding talent from Braff and some solid actors at work. It also happens to have a smart sense of humor that I suppose I appreciated.

1517098,2,B00005JNC2,"Hmmm...just saw this film and was left unimpressed. Watching a 20 something who is lost, finding his way (and it's questionable if he ever does) is less than captivating, unless maybe you are in the same state the viewer is in. His old friends are immature and irresponsible partying 24/7 with no care in the world. One of the film's leads has the most despicable of habits to pay for his drug use. Is it supposed to be funny? The characters are two dimensional and poorly scripted. The whole premise just seems unrealistic, unresolved and unintelligent. If the critics say this is a great movie, maybe it's because they do that for a living. Not a waste of time but close to it.",1196726400,,679,4.528455284552845
1517099,5,B00005JNC2,"From time to time, we use to watch - thanks to the unrestricted rules of the conventional circuits - films that breath a warm poetry, a fine artistic feature, surrounded of an accurate sense of existential vertigo.

An aspirant to actor, who lives in Los Angeles, is notified about his mother has paused away. A long time has gone since he left his birthplace; his childhood friends have grown up and have decided to undertake different professions. That sad reencounter with his family and circle of friends dates him back to his origins, but besides will allow an unexpected love.

The film has three brilliant sequences, the first one  is when we realize the emotional burden that represented the horrid accident suffered by his mother  that affected him since his early childhood (he was nine, by then), carrying with him the enormous weight of the guilt over all those years; on the other hand the brief but memorable clash with his father (brilliantly performed by Ian Holm) and third that mesmerizing metaphor of the unfathomable abbeys in the coda of the plot, that works out as an admirable mirror image of his own existence, acting over him as a powerful device to bring him back to the lost emotional equilibrium.

Nathalie Portman steals herself the show with her memorable acting. She looks so natural through her dialogues, absolutely identified with her role that constitutes one of the sever highlights of this unconventional portrait of what the lack of love may infringe on the human behavior and at the meantime how this same feeling brings him back to the normality.

GARDEN STATE evolves into a marvelous, emotionally satisfying ride with offbeat characters and a unique sensibility.

Little details like that make the picture even more enjoyable on repeated viewings.",1183334400,,365,4.71875
1517104,5,B00005JNC2,"This is a triumph for Zach Braff who directed, wrote, and also stars as Andrew Largeman who finds that love beats the holy heck out of lithium and assorted drugs bizarrely prescribed by his unfeeling father who just happens to be a shrink.  Ladies and gentleman never let your father be your shrink.

I was quite taken with Natalie Portman who plays Sam who turns out to be Large's true love, and such a kinky, quirky, beautiful true love she is.  Portman eschews beauty in every scene but manages to be cute and sweet and very emotionally evolved, which I liked.  She is of course beautiful and brilliant as everybody knows, but here she tries something different.  She strives to be ordinary and slight but with great emotive power.  Nice performance.

The sound track which reminded this old guy of something from Simon and Garfunkel, and in fact there is a Simon and Garfunkel tune on it, was the sort of sweet, nostalgia-producing, alternative rock kind of sweet angst sound that lets you know that this is what youth is all about.

Largeman, wanna-be and somewhat successful/somewhat failed actor out on loan, comes home from the big city to rural New Jersey because his mother has died, unaccountable in a bathtub--which can happen if you are a paraplegic.  He deals with a childhood tragedy and acquired guilt, meets his old buds, including Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) who is a full time slacker and part time dreamer and consummate doper.  Largeman unveils his sidecar mobile--the only thing willed from his grandfather's estate--with its white star on combat green, and tools around town, parties a little and meets quirky Samantha who likes to tell lies as a kind of way to deal with the world.  I knew a girl like that, only she knew when she was lying--if somebody caught her.  Sam figures it's a tick like Tourette's, and anyway her lies are harmless.

The movie is sweet and mildly comedic with some original shtick, and at times a bit of a tear-jerker.  More than anything it's a touching love story, which I can never resist.  And, yes, it's very New Jersey like Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi, although no songs by them on the track--not to mention Elizabeth Shue who was a classmate of Braff's in high school.

1517138,3,B00005JNC2,"I was really looking forward to this movie cause I love Zach Braff in Scrubs, but if you're expecting anything like Scrubs, just chuck those expectations out the window. This movie is NOTHING like Scrubs. My expectations being what they were, I was very sadly disappointed throughout the first half of this movie. It was slow, uninteresting...I didn't care about the characters or their problems. But beginning with the scene in the bar between Natalie Portman and Zach Braff, that started to change. We get a little more of the back-story of Natalie Portman's character until Peter Sarsgaard and co. interrupt. The scene with Natalie Portman and Zach Braff in the bathtub at his house adds a little more to Braff's character, but one of the two defining scenes in this movie, for me, was where the four are in the mansion sitting in front of the fireplace. Braff's character reveals the heart of the story and the source of his pain. The second scene that makes the film is toward the end between Braff and his dad, played by Ian Holm. It is touching and seems to be the entire point of the film. Braff's character relates that he's been on a sort of journey since he's been home and he's right. This is just the beginning of the bigger journey.

Overall, because of my high expectations, I was let down. But the movie does suffer a bit from inconsistent writing. The film is essentially a series of dialogs that, together, tell the whole story. So when some of the pieces aren't as strong as the rest, the whole story sags.

As far as the DVD goes, the deleted scenes are EXCELLENT. You should probably watch all the scenes once with the commentary off, but then be sure to watch First Talk and Bathtub Talk with the commentary on to hear why Braff cut the scenes the way he did for the final film. Very insightful. The blooper reel is obligatory, but still pretty funny. One thing that I will always complain about is no theatrical trailer. This seems to be a very egregious omission with newer DVDs.",1174953600,,2003,4.576601671309192
1517139,5,B00005JNC2,"I loved this movie, I found it to be a very reflective experience.

Aldous Huxley's book 'Brave New World' is referenced in the story. ""Community, Identity, Stability"" is the motto of Huxley's utopian World State where everyone consumes daily grams of soma, to fight depression.  Andrew Largeman,  Zach Braff's character decides to escape his soma/lithium existence and finally open his eyes, start feeling again and actually find community, identity and stability.  That awakening is Garden State. What an excellent poignant and comedic debut by Zach Braff

A couple of themes explored are: 'being homesick for place that doesn't even exist' our idea of what should be, but often isn't, and finally coming to terms with that. And the other as sung by Frou Frou  ""There's beauty in the breakdown',  change takes courage so Let Go. Largeman doesn't so much breakdown as breakout.

Two great young actors, Peter Sarsgaard as Mark and especially Natalie Portman as Sam are prefect bookends to Andrew Largeman. I can hardly wait to see what Portman does over the next 30 years she is a sensational talent.

The soundtrack is fantastic. There are many great little visual touches, such as his neurologists having so many plaques that he hangs one on the ceiling. The automated faucets all triggering as Largeman walks by them in the airport bathroom. Sam's family applauding after watching her skating videos and the lights go out, clap on, clap off. For Harlan Coben fans, much of the movie was filmed in and around Livingston NJ the setting of so many of his wonderful books.

1517140,4,B00005JNC2,"A surprising winner in my book, Garden State is entirely likable, and also one of those films that is capable of being simultaneously deep and funny, light and fun, welcoming and imposing, all as it slips out from behind its misguiding exterior and brutally confides things to us we'd almost as soon not know. Natalie Portman definitely earns her paycheck as Sam, a charmingly weird girl who manages to love life (and inspire a love of life in others) even as she deals with problems that would send most of us into a tailspin of self pity. Writer Zach Braff of NBC's Scrubs was equally great as director and actor, playing the part of a young man named Andrew Largeman, who has returned to New Jersey after nine years of living in California, where he has won moderate fame on a TV series playing an intellectually-stunted individual. (A left-handed compliment in the movie has someone telling Andrew, ""On that show I really thought you WERE retarded."") Andrew returns to his hometown to attend the funeral of his mother, whom he accidentally crippled when he was a child: something he has clearly never been allowed to forget, and which has understandably haunted him ever since. In New Jersey Andrew reconnects with a number of old friends, including one whose sudden wealth comes from having invented a form of ""silent Velcro"" and he stares down some old demons, including the biggest one in the form of his judgmental father. Above all else Andrew unexpectedly finds love, and it is the story of this love that gives (the almost dreary) Garden State its well-found balance. Garden State is a refreshing movie that never loses the feel of its indie roots. Andrew and Sam are the sort of people it's impossible not to root for, and the entire film has a ""what will happen next"" feel that's rarer than ever for any writer to accomplish.",1173916800,,1838,4.728971962616822
1517141,4,B00005JNC2,"Braff seems to have reversed the ancient Orpheus story -- if you're trying to get out of hell, and the woman calls for you, you should turn around, grab her, and hang on tight.

I'm learning to respect Portman more as an actress. She keeps Sam's quirkiness believable, even saving some dialog that's a bit clumsy and melodramatic by making it part of her melodramitic, clumsy, and insecure character. It's a shame she was involved in that whole Star Wars mess!

I do have some doubts about the little sex jokes throughout the film.  Not that I mind sex jokes -- I love Kevin Smith movies -- but they seem a bit forced and out of place in this one.  On the other hand, the movie might get kind of maudlin without an occasional masturbating pug dog.

I pulled the DVD out of the machine without finishing it and I can't decide whether to keep it against the day I feel far too happy and need a tug back towards 'neurotic' or tie it to a brick and toss it in the sea.

I found myself really impacted by the artistic pauses and snapshots of the ""human-experience"".  It had me so entranced, that I was as glued to my TV during the credits as I was during that long middle part.

Natalie Portman really brought out the life in Zach Braff, and it reminded me of being young again, and being vulnerable.  I felt vulnerable the next day at work and I really believe Garden State has changed my approach to how I carry myself around the office (which is where I spend most of my time - you know you do too!).  I stop and stare more often, I'm more sensitive to loud noises, and I've really gotten into the Shins too!  You have to hear them!  ;-)

Within about 10 minutes into the movie, I knew that whomever directed this was definitely talented, and whomever had written it was equally talented. By the end of the movie and the credits, I realised who was behind all this, and I was surprised. I like Zach Braff very much for his acting, but until then it was unknown to me that the guy was so gifted behind a camera and a pen.

Even though the main plot is relatively simple, this movie has truly compelling bits of weirdness and oddities. If you're into details, you'll probably love this film as much as I do; not a second of this movie is a bore, and I'm still amazed at the tireless richness of it. The direction is splendid and the substance is pure, not to mention the soundtrack which lets you know that someone is a tasteful listener of music (that being Mr. Braff, again).

Natalie Portman is absolutely stunning in this movie. She blew my mind. I guess that seeing her as queen Amidala in Star Wars made me think she wasn't anything special as an actress, but in ""Garden State"", her true potential comes out shining and exploding. She truly is amazing and talented; that film totally changed my perception of her as an actress, now I know she is genuinely good. So is Braff; and the two together - well they're just a fantastic pair.

Compared to most movies, this one comes as a breath of fresh air. It's inspiring too because it does so much with ""so little""; for as I said before, the details here matter. To name but a few: silent velcro, skating alligators, epilepsy security helmet, house-boat, etc.

I can't recommend this movie enough. And I can't wait for more work from Zach Braff, who I now know is very promising as a director and writer. Honestly, I put very much hope in him.

My particular preference is to have the music lift the emotion to a place the visual couldn't have reached on its own - definitely the case here.  I heard Zach Braff won an award for the sound track - and he doesn't play any music!  Well, now I know why.

Natalie Portman was born to play the female lead.  The humor was fantastic, and I understand, alot of the material was autobiographical.  But theres plenty of morbidity here too. One of the main characters takes jewelry from corpses as he's burying them, and took jewelry off of the mother of the main character!  Somehow, this is all forgiven, given the otherwise sincerely of the script.  Braff does a nice job of avoiding the tendency to fill every void with dialogue.

The point, I think, is that most people are wasting their lives away unhappy, bored, or alone.  The two main characters seemingly, avoid this fate, recognizing the potential contained in their new love.

My wife only hung in thru about 10 minutes, though I encouraged her to give the rest of the movie a chance as it really picked up once Natalie Portman got involved as Braff's new girlfriend. It's nice to know that she got such a fun role after (before?) suffering through her time as queen in Star Wars the last. The whole film has a grittier feel than ""Spanglish"", which helped make it more to my taste. It's R-rated, but aside from a few ""MF's"" and some fairly substantial drug and alcohol use in the first 10 minutes, the story's probably OK for kids down to 11 or 12 (at least by my standards).

1517194,2,B00005JNC2,"Zach Braff of ""Scrubs"" fame wrote, directed and starred in ""Garden State.""  The flick has a lot of good ideas, but at its heart there is a sodden, dull story that cannot be enlivened by copious amounts of wit.

Braff plays ""Large,"" a once-successful actor now reduced to waiting tables in a Vietnamese restaurant.  He returns home to Jersey when his mother dies, stirring lots of ugly family history.  Once home, Large's emotional zombie-status becomes evident, but is almost matched by the toneless muddle of high school friends he runs into.  The only spark is Sam (Natalie Portman), who for some reason falls for this sack of dull platitudes.

The script is too clever by half, invoking hamsters, silent velcro, an abyss, infomercials on real estate, and other inanities in an attempt at edginess.  The movie feels like it was written by a hyper-depressed writer cut loose from the sad last year of ""Northern Exposure.""  Couple this with a too-on-the-nose soundtrack and a wasted crop of actors (why, Ian Holm, why?), and you've got ""Garden State.""

It tries way too hard, and every ""idiosyncratic"" element seems forced and insincere.

I hate to offened any reader out there, but the entire time I was watching this flick I had one re-occuring thought:

""This is a movie for Tools.""

You know those big-budget, well-shot TV commercials for Cars or Cellphones? It's about two hours of that: Vapid and pretty, micro-managed and insincere.

The compulsive, overstated attention to detail is obnoxious and trite. The Director and cinematographer are more concerned with framing shots ""well"" than making a decent movie.

Skip this one!

Cliched, derivative, phoney, forced.

1517261,3,B00005JNC2,"This is an interesting movie worth seeing.  The theme that emerges, once you get to know the characters and their history well enough to put it all in perspective, is that the main character was damaged by psychiatric drugs all his life, his father being a psychiatrist who thought he knew what he was doing.

When he was a little boy, our hero lost patience with his constantly complaining mom, and gave her a push.  She fell over something, injured herself, and spent the rest of her life crippled.  In response, the father put the kid on prescription drugs, his way of saying that the boy was dangerous and out of control.  The ""fact"" is that it was just an accident, and the little boy was not dangerous or out of control.  The mother was extremely annoying, so much so that she got her son to give her a little push out of frustration.

Years passed, and then the woman accidentally drowned in her own bathtub.  Again, the father would want that to seem like the son's fault, for that push he gave his mom so many years ago.  He wouldn't want to take the blame on himself.  Personally I think he should have had a talk with his wife way back then, letting her know how inconsiderate it is to be complaining all the time.  If he had given her enough verbal pushes, maybe the child wouldn't have had to give a physical push.

The father is ponderous.  By the end of the movie you realize what a villain he is.  Fortunately, most of the movie leaves him out of it.  It follows the son and his friends.

His most interesting friend is Natalie Portman, a young woman with an odd sense of humor that has her making up tall tales.  Much is made of her being a ""liar"", but I don't see it that way.  Is a comedian called a liar for telling stories?  Once you accept the fact that Natalie's character enjoys putting people on with tall tales, I don't see a problem with it.  I'm fine with her sense of humor.  Can you only be considered a comic if you are getting paid for it?  Is a stage the only place you are allowed to put people on?

One drawback of this film is that since the main character is supposed to be drugged into numbness, how do you make him interesting to watch?  I think the movie had to struggle with that.",1153699200,,2221,4.270983213429257

1517264,5,B00005JNC2,"I had intended to see GARDEN STATE when it was in the theaters, but for some reason I never got around to it.  Then when it came out on DVD, I kept intending to see it, but for whatever reason didn't, until now.  As they say, better late than never, and I'll add that this ends a personal losing streak of seeing one disappointing movie after another

The movie is basically about a struggling actor in Hollywood who returns to his hometown in New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral.  Like so many movies involving a trip home, this one becomes a journey of self-discovery and renewal, as Andrew Largeman confronts the shape life has taken since the moment he caused a serious accident his mother suffered when he was nine.  Heavily medicated for most of his life, he resolves to get off the host of drugs he is on.  Meanwhile, just as he is determined to get off anti-depressants so that he can feel again, he meets a charming yet quirky girl who has her own set of problems.  For whatever reason, they click and embark on their own romance.

Plot in a movie is not the same as execution, but luckily the film is executed marvelously, maintaining a perfect balance between funny but quirky weirdness and emotional authenticity.  The film is full of laughs, but it is much more than just a collection of laughs.  All in all, it is a very impressive movie.

You have to love what Zach Braff did in this film.  Few have pulled off the triple feat of acting, writing, and directing as well as he did here.  What is remarkable is how well he managed all three.  As an actor, he is a performer of immense likeability.  I think if he manages to stay within the range of that fundamental likeability as an actor, he is going to have a remarkable career.  The general feeling is that next year will be the last for SCRUBS, which while a great vehicle for Braff is probably keeping him from the movie career that beckons.  I hope that at some point he returns as well to both writing and directing.

Natalie Portman is enjoyable in her role as Sam, the epileptic girl he meets and falls in love with.  She is an actress.  I mean by that that she performs roles, she doesn't just play herself in films.  This isn't one of her most impressive performances to date, but it is further evidence of her considerable talent.  Unfortunately, much of her time was eaten up in recent years by the lamentable STAR WARS trilogy.  I'm very anxious to see what she does from here on out.  Her character gave me a bit of a pang because of the way it reminded me of a major ex-girlfriend of mine, who like Sam was a compulsive liar (as with Sam, she would lie on all manner of incredibly small--as well as big--things) and who also like same carried about the tattered remnants of her ""blankey.""  A definite moment of deja vu for me.

GARDEN STATE contains one of the most celebrated soundtracks of recent years and it isn't an accident that it has enjoyed considerable success on its own.  In addition to all else that he did on the film, Braff picked out all the songs on the record.  It is a very well chosen selection.  I've often wondered how much of a role, if any, he plays in the music selection of music on SCBUBS, which has some of the best music of any show on TV.

All in all, this is a superb movie.  If you like intelligent, serious yet eccentric comedy, you will almost certainly enjoy this one.",1149811200,4,3388,4.381410256410256
1517265,4,B00005JNC2,"After hearing wonderful things about this movie from many people, I finally bought the DVD. Some of my friends hailed it as the best movie they have ever seen, some the most romantic. Does it live up to expectations. Well, yes and no.

First things first, if you're expecting humor in the vein of Scrubs, don't even bother with this. It is not even remotely close, in fact it doesn't even try to be. The story is about Andrew Largeman, who is on so many drugs, that he basically sleepwalks through life. He has no emotional connections with anybody. He feels empty, that is until his dad calls him one day crying, and says that his mother has just passed away. Andrew then goes back to his hometown, Jersey where he meets some of his old friends and forges a relationship with someone new. The story then revolves around these people over a span of about 4 days. A journey of self discovery ensues...

While the story is hardly groundbreaking, I actually fell in love with this movie, largely because of the fantastic cast and superb dialogue. Zach Braff's directorial debut is actually very good. The characters are a delight to watch. They seem so real. They have their share of good moments and self doubts, just like us. Zach Braff, who practically typifies wackiness in Scrubs does pretty much the same here, but toning it down a level and it works wonderfully. Natalie Portman, who I feel is one of the best actors of our generation (or my generation, at least) is great as Samantha. Portman has been in such diverse roles in her short career, and she pulls it off very well each and every time. Her performance here adds a whole lot of ""heart"" to the movie. The rest of the cast, Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm and even Jean Smart provide memorable supporting performances, that stays with you even after the show. As I said, the conversation between characters are also something that drew me into the show. Watch how something you've always thought as petty, turn into something thoughtful. An example of this, is the idea of a ""home"". Don't get it? Watch the movie.

Another thing I would like to comment was the cinematography and music. They went hand in hand, the shots of the neighbourhood were beautiful, fitting the story exceptionally well and Zach Braff has an ear for good music. A nice selection of songs that leaves you with some sort of emotion, for the characters and their experiences.

All in all, a good movie that's worthy of my recommendation. Just take it for what it is and enjoy the moment. In fact, I think that's what the people behind this movie are hoping for. Great effort!",1149811200,2,2604,4.605603448275862

1517268,4,B00005JNC2,"****1/2

""Garden State"" is anything but a garden variety romantic comedy.  Brilliantly written and directed by Zack Braff (who also plays the lead role), this quirky indie triumph is one of the most delightful and disarming little films to come our way in a long long time.

The ironically named Andrew Largeman is a bit like Holden Caulfield, but without all the articulation about his alienation and angst.  In fact, for Andrew, the angst is buried so deep within his psyche that he is completely unable to verbalize what it is that is bothering him.  All he knows is that he isn't happy with either his life or himself as a person.  Andrew confesses that for most of his time here on earth all he has been able to feel is ""numb.""  As the movie begins, we meet Andrew as a struggling actor living in Los Angeles, having fled his hometown in New Jersey years earlier.  Virtually estranged from his parents, Andrew receives the shocking news that his paraplegic mother has died suddenly in a drowning ""accident,"" thus precipitating Andrew's first trip home in ages.  As with many literary and cinematic characters, Andrew learns a great deal about himself and about others by making that return trek back to the place of his roots.

It's hard to convey in words just how charming and lovable an experience ""Garden State"" turns out to be.  It is a movie filled with originality, humor, warmth, poignancy and a sly comprehension about life and how best to live it.  As Andrew reconnects with his childhood buddies, he learns that not much has changed in their lives either and that they are no closer to finding true happiness than he is.  So even though fleeing the town may not have been the answer, staying there certainly wasn't the answer either - or at least so he believes until he meets an idiosyncratic young woman named Sam, delightfully played by Natalie Portman.  The two hit it off almost instantly, finding common ground in their peculiarities and eccentricities.  What's impressive about Braff's work here is that he never overdoes the quirkiness as so many other filmmakers do.  He allows it to filter through his tale in such a way that we find ourselves laughing with the people rather than at them.  The folks in this town may not be the smartest or most ambitious people we will ever meet, but somehow they have managed to make life work for them and have remained generally positive and upbeat in the process.

Braff, looking a little like a young Ray Romano, perfectly captures the befuddlement, fear and almost crippling self-consciousness that lay at the root of Andrew's unhappiness, while at the same time conveying the good-naturedness and capacity for loving that provide him with the hope that, against all odds, he will someday achieve fulfillment.  He and Portman make such an endearing romantic couple that we just know they will wind up making it in the end.  In addition, there are strong supporting performances from Ian Holm, Peter Sarsgaard, Ron Leibman and a whole host of other talented performers.

""Garden State"" provides a subtle little homage to ""The Graduate"" in its closing line - a fitting tribute from a film that captures the offbeat vision and youthful spirit of that earlier classic of anarchic cinema.  But ""Garden State"" is a visionary film in its own right as well.",1143936000,,3316,4.790861159929701

I can see how this appealed to younger movie goers, but I couldn't quite swallow it all. Andrew's ability to overcome these obstacles almost instantaneously was unrealistic, and I thought the movie lacked a point of view about the events around him--particularly about the father, whose conduct was grossly unethical, and Andrew's despicable friend Mark.

Peter Sarsgaard's performance was outstanding, and his character's complexity was mesmerizing.  Ian Holm was in perfect form as the psychiatrist/father, flawed by his inability to accept what is as opposed to what he would prefer. My favorite scene in the movie is set in the quarry, when the 3 main characters stand atop an abandoned piece of equipment and shout into the ""infinite abyss"" before them, after which the awakened hero embraces and enfolds his lover in one of the most tender, realistic, and heartfelt kisses I've ever seen on film.  It was also quite unexpected and delightful to hear ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" by Simon & Garfunkel for the first time in decades.

1517370,4,B00005JNC2,"Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a young man who has spent most of his life on prescription drugs. All of his experiences have been numbed down to where they are less memorable than they actually are. Andrew receives a call from his father, Gideon (Ian Holm), telling him that his mother has just drowned in the bathtub. After nine years of being absent from his hometown in New Jersey, Andrew returns for his mother's funeral. He doesn't cry at the graveside ceremony. Later in the film he confesses that he tried to, but couldn't. He thought of the saddest things he had seen in movies and even pictured a haunting photograph he had seen in a magazine, but nothing worked for him. He thought of everything except the passing of his mother. This says a lot about how his psyche has been warped.

Andrew, according to his father, is responsible for his mother's death. When Andrew was nine he got frustrated with his mother and weakly pushed her. She fell and hit the back of her neck on the kitchen counter, paralyzing her from the waist down and confining her to a wheel chair. In theory, she wouldn't have drowned had she not been paralyzed. This incident plagued Andrew with psychiatry and prescriptions that sedated his inner being for sixteen years. He is now twenty-five, motherless, and trying to find his place in life.

He and his father lack stable communication, and in an early scene we can tell that Gideon, to some degree, hates his son. Andrew claims that he was only a kid who didn't know what he was doing or what he was capable of. ""Garden State"" doesn't argue whether or not Andrew is truly guilty of his mother's death. It  depicts the release that Andrew has when he accidentally leaves his medications at home, flies to New Jersey, and begins to experience life for the first time ever.

At his mother's funeral, Andrew runs into his childhood buddy Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), who works as a gravedigger at the cemetery. So apparently uninterested is Andrew in the passing of his mother that he makes plans to meet up with Mark and his crew later on that evening. That night he is at a drunken party with Mark and his friends, high on ecstasy and playing Spin-The-Bottle. The game soon requires a beautiful girl to kiss him, and she does so with more than just willingness. We wouldn't be the least bit surprised if this were Andrew's first kiss.

Andrew's hometown is populated by strange people, but none so distinguished as Sam (Natalie Portman), a free-spirited young woman whom he meets in a doctor's clinic. Occupied by an odd persona, Sam begins to show Andrew a side of life he has never seen before. Its as if this beautiful woman with unusual quirks (""Whenever I feel unoriginal, I make a noise that no one else in the world has ever made and then I feel good about myself."") has rescued him from a prison that he has been held in all of his life. Interesting how she is better at therapy than drugs or psychiatrists.

""Garden State"" is a strange movie in the sense that it is about real people. Let's face it, we are all weird in some way, and that is what the movie depicts. Some characters are marginally weird and others, like Sam or Mark's mother (Jean Smart), are off the charts. The reality of the film is what makes it strange, and the world that the characters inhabit functions like a microscope in which we can closely analyze the people around us. Its actually very brilliant.

A film like this is a showboat for acting ability, especially for the film's writer and director, Zach Braff, in the engrossing role of Andrew. And let it be said that Natalie Portman delivers what has to be the most colorful and energetic performance of her career. She handles the role of Sam with a graceful aplomb in a role that should be talked about and studied for years to come. Placing Sam in this universe of delicate detail is something that Braff did with care; few writer-directors are as passionate about their films as he is.

In his writing, directing, and acting debut, Braff has visualized the newfound joys of a young man who is out of touch with reality. Braff's film is also out of touch with reality, but also in touch with reality by its oddities. We, as people, would hate to admit that some of us can relate to these characters. Just imagine Roy from ""Matchstick Men"" coming across a few of them and you'd have a spinoff worth seeing. - Isaac

1517371,2,B00005JNC2,"Whenever I watch a movie, I ask myself this question--""Why should I care about the characters and what they are going through?""  The answer to that question is absolute nothing as far as Garden State goes.  The characterization is so paper thin that I half wished that Sam and Andrew will never see each other again.  There is nothing sympathetic about story's hero Andrew.  He is just another loser who can't get his act together.  His story is not worth telling.  Natalie Portman did what she could with her role, Sam.  Her presence is the only saving grace.",1136160000,3,560,4.653061224489796
1517372,4,B00005JNC2,"Garden State is actually a drug trip movie in reverse.  Whereas other movies about drug addiction subject the viewer through the insanity of hallucinations, silly antics, and run-ins with the law, Garden State starts out in the doldrums of a barbiturate-induced malaise.  Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) wanders aimlessly through life, suffering from a recurring nightmare that he's on a plane that's about to crash.  While everyone screams, ""Large"" just turns up the air.  That pretty much sums up his life.

The death of Andrew's mother calls him home to New Jersey (Garden State, get it), and it's only then that the pieces start to fit together.  A quadriplegic, Mrs. Largeman and Andrew have a bitter past.  It doesn't help that his father, Gideon (the magnificent Ian Holm) alternately blames Andrew for his mother's condition and coldly distances himself from his son.  The confrontation between them is a long time coming.

Along the way, Andrew reconnects with all of his old friends in Jersey.  It's not a particularly flattering portrayal. They're all in service roles, be it outrageously offensive police officers, meandering stoner gravediggers, or knights for the Medieval Times dinner restaurant.  Okay, that last job is cool.  But the character is a jerk.

It seems that Andrew didn't miss much.  While he was on mind-altering medication as a struggling actor in Los Angeles, his friends (and in at least one case, his friends' mom) are all toking up in the mansion of a guy who invented ""silent Velcro.""  And yet, with all that money, all they do is waste it away getting high.

Thankfully, that fate is not for Andrew.  Away from his drugs for the first time in his life, he begins to wake up and the audience is encouraged to wake up with him.  The film's music, dialogue, and camera angles shift from dreamy floating sequences to a much snappier pace.  It almost makes suffering along with Andrew worth it.

The turning point is the arrival of Sam, played by Natalie Portman.  An inveterate pixie of a liar, she comes from a wacky household where burying pets (in the pet graveyard, of course) is a sacred obligation.  Fans of Portman always knew she could act, but Garden State forcefully reminds us as she ranges from timid vulnerability to passionate love, from heart wrenching sorrow to boundless joy. She turns Sam into a living, breathing woman and a worthy counterpart to the not-quite-awake Andrew.

In between, a lot of things don't happen.  Andrew avoids his father but visits the bathtub where his mother drowned.  The question as to whether or not her death was a suicide is left hanging--except in the special features, where the confrontation between father and son is fleshed out.  They go to a lot of parties, visit some wacky characters, and go on a quest for a treasure at the bottom of an Abyss (Braf played Dungeons & Dragons, I can tell).

Garden State's biggest flaw is that it wants to be an art film, a tale of redemption, a coming of age story, a father/son weeper, a small town homage, and a music video.  Because Braff also wrote and directed, his artist sensibilities are perpetually at war with what makes for a good story...and it's all on screen.  The beginning is slow and meandering, but that's on purpose and appropriate for an art film.  It doesn't make for a compelling story though.  The ending is forced and more than a little odd--there's a feint at a different ending, dancing at the edge of art-house sensibilities, only to pull back at the last second.  Which is a good thing too, because otherwise we'd end up with the same kind of non-ending as Lost in Translation.

Ultimately, Garden State is about that verdant state of being in every one of us, the child who has no idea his actions will have repercussions for the rest of his life.  Returning to that raw human condition of love, hate, vulnerability and strength, elevates Garden State to more than just a hokey hometown film.",1136160000,3,3942,4.791111111111111

I am usually not one for these types of movies. I usually go more for the comedy genre (the only reason I even know of Zach Braff is that I am a fan of Scrubs). I just liked that the movie is real. I like Zach's idea to not follow the standard, expected and boring 3 part movie set up and just have the movie run over the course of the 4 days that he is back home.

1517377,5,B00005JNC2,"I have to admit that I may be biased because this is my favorite movie of all time. I think Zach Braff is a brilliant genius.

Sam, played by Natalie Portman, is adorably comical. She knows she has imperfections, especially lying, yet she almost seems flawless, and I think there is an instant connection with this character; you can't help but adore her.

I think from the start, you fall in love with the characters in this movie. I think a lot of people, especially with the way society is today, can even identify with Andrew's decision to finally live life, whether that means leaving a lithium induced haze, or finally appreciating everything around you. My favorite scene from the movie:

""Andrew Largeman: You know that point in your life when you realize that the house that you grew up in isn't really your home anymore? All of a sudden even though you have some place where you can put your stuff that idea of home is gone.

Sam: I still feel at home in my house.

Andrew Largeman: You'll see when you move out, it just sort of happens one day, one day and it's just gone. And you can never get it back. It's like you get homesick for a place that doesn't exist. I mean it's like this right of passage, you know. You won't have this feeling again until you create a new idea of home for yourself, you know, for your kids, for the family you start, it's like a cycle or something. I miss the idea of it. Maybe that's all family really is. A group of people who miss the same imaginary place.""

Brilliance! I don't know anybody that cannot identify with feeling that way at some point. I think everyone needs to see this movie at least once. It will make you laugh, it could make you cry, but overall, it leaves you with with this feeling that you are okay, and life, if not perfect, is okay.

1517408,5,B00005JNC2,"There have been many reviews here which have given the blow-by-blow of the plot behind the movie.  They have focused upon Andrew Largeman's return to his hometown following the death of his mother and his short journey back to himself and the people and circumstances that shook up his life and set him in a direction that will bring him from being numb to feeling life again for the first time in many years.

Yes - this is a big part of the film.

AND what delighted me more than the plot was the artistry that was exhibited in the story telling.  Actors filled supporting roles and cameo roles with incredible intensity and flavor, take Jean Smart, who played the mother of one of Andrew Largeman's best friends from his home town who now spends his time taking hits from a bong while at home and digging graves while at work.

The role of Andrew's father, a Psychiatrist who has medicated his son into a no-feeling state for year-after-year-after-year was admirably played by Ian Holm.

There was a woman who sang at the mother's funeral who was SOOOO New Jersey I was amazed: I am not sure of her name but I did love her moments on stage.

I was completely wrapped up in the storytelling - I wondered about the metaphors unfolding (such as one with Andrew and Sam sitting on a staircase at an airport with an escalator constantly in motion behind them.)  I wondered: was that on purpose, about movement and life and being stuck in life or am I putting WAYYYY too much into this?

I loved watching Andrew come back to life - when talking to his father he said, ""I was a little boy and some one made a sh*tty latch"" - and that latch defined the intervening years of his life and now, now NOW he was choosing differently.

I adored ""meeting"" Sam with all her beloved eccentricities - she reminded me of what I imagine my youngest daughter will become - I had to have my eight-year-old daughter watch the scene where Andrew ""witnessed a completely original moment"" and I wondered what would happen if we each became conscious of creating completely original moments?

And then there was the surprising geological find... in Newark, NJ and another line I will carry with me forever - ""Have fun exploring the infinite abyss"" and exactly the perfect response, ""You, too.""

He could have been speaking to you - or me - or your neighbor, your best friend.

I was moved to tears when Andrew began to parent his father, ""We have to work on being OK"" not to fabricate that we were happy.  Very powerful.  What if we all worked on being OK?

Zach Braff was incredible - goofy smile and all. Natalie Portman did an incredibly subtle and believable New Jersey accent....(I grew up in NJ, whether or not it makes me an expert is up for question, I suppose.)

This movie, obviously, will stick with me. I hope you will watch it with your heart and mind wide open... and enjoy exploring the infinite abyss.",1135468800,2,2893,4.500956022944551
1517409,4,B00005JNC2,"As a foreigner who has lived in the US and is the same age as the main characters in 'Garden State' many things look familiar. This is not strange considering Zach Braff based part of the story on his own life in New Jersey, also known as the Garden State.

The story is quite simple. A guy comes home because his mother drowned and died and while back he meets some of his old friends, has to confront his psychiatrist father who has been medicating him since the age of 10. He also meets a new person in his life, the girl Sam played brilliantly by Natalie Portman in one of the best roles I've ever seen her in.

The characters are very familiar to me. Twentysomethings with dreams for more but stuck working as a knight in a foodstore or burying people. During the night they try to forget things by taking vast amounts of drugs. It is not so much a drama however, there is also a lot of comedy in the movie. It's a typical independant movie.

Another thing that has to be mentioned is the soundtrack, handpicked by Braff himself. If you are into indie music you will love the soundtrack. It is so good that it even won a grammy award.",1135036800,2,1139,4.263888888888889
1517410,5,B00005JNC2,"I'd like to call it a dark Comedy but it's a sad dark drama.  Each time I watch it I get something more from it.  It's one of those movies that you grow attached to the characters each time you watch it.

""Large"" plays an Actor/Waiter in L.A. living his life as a walking zombie due to the fact that he is on so many anti-depressants.  He comes back to his home state, NJ for his mother's funeral after a nine year absence.

He meets up with all his old friends who seemingly haven't changed a bit from the high-school days of petty stealing, spin the bottle and pot parties.  However this time it is different, he stopped taking all those horrible mind-altering drugs and starts to feel for the first time in years.  Good, bad and ugly but to feel anything again is a wonderful thing.

He meets up with quirky Sam (Natalie Portman) and starts a friendship that blooms into a touching warm relationship.  They both lend a hand to each other.

There are some scenes that are pretty meaningless like when he and his friend goes to meet up with a guy to swap money for a helium ballon machine which is actually in a hotel that has peep holes in the rooms where men are ""enjoying"" the ""show.""  However, these non-functional scenes are covered up with clever camera shots and FANTASTIC music.

By the time I've watched this movie about 8 times, I realized the big draw is not just the movie but the soundtrack.  A must!  Buy it...you won't be disappointed.  It will go down as one of my must have CD's (as well as DVD) of 2005!

It does have a happy ending with Large realizing he needs to stop with the prescription drugs and deal with the problems at hand and maybe share a life with Sam.",1134518400,4,1685,4.318471337579618

I guess it happens everywhere though and honestly, that's refreshing.

There are life parodies within the story, be it the aunt who makes the ugly wallpaper shirt for Large, Large's father to name a few. The psychiatric drug story is one which ppl under those medication might relate to for most, as those were the exact things that I went through as well.  Those drugs are worthless though they to work at the beginning, but then again psychiatrists seem to want u to stay on medication for the rest of your life. They (pills) make you numb, emotionally, dulls your senses so that you'd be *far* less reactive = ""normal"".  After that, u're a zombie.

Boy, did I hate this movie.  Oh, there's parts to like.  Peter Sarsgard's perfomance is particularly good, and Portman also does well in her hopeful effort to break away from wooden Star Wars roles.  But overall, what writer/director/actor Zach Braff delivers is more of what has become Indie formula.  If you `ve seen (starting with) ""The Graduate,"" ""Donnie Darko,"" ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" ""The Royal Tennenbaums,"" ""Rushmore,"" ""Ghost World"" and any number of other ""indie"" efforts, you've seen better versions of the same.  Actually, ""The Graduate"" isn't really an indie, but it nailed for all time the whole detached/alienated youth thing that has been a well for indie directors to go back to again and again. (But it also had terrific soundtrack to help it along.)  And you know the story: quirky boy or girl in quirky unexpected plots filled with quirky friends, with lots of dead stares (usually one or two from a couch) suggesting some kind of existential void that will be filled by movie's end (inadequately of course, since that is Life, but recognizing that fact is itself a victory - of sorts).

Zach Braff, from tv's ""Scrubs"", is director, writer AND actor in his major debut. And his job is fantastic.

The story is that of a struggling actor, Andrew ""Large"" Largeman (Braff), who returns to his hometown New Jersey, when his mother suddenly dies. There he is faced with a lot of things, namely his dad (Ian Holm), who has had him on numbing medication for most of his life. There, one day in the doctor's surgery after a party at his friend's house, he meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a quirky girl with a love for The Shins, lying and doing things that are ""totally unique"". The rest is yours to discover.

It is accompanied by a soundtrack which sounds incredible, from all the clips I've been listening to, and I will be buying it soon. (it features The Shins, Coldplay, Zero 7 and Simon & Garfunkel, to name but a few)

I hadn't read up on the film, really went into it blind, not expecting too much, needless to say I was impressed.

The plot concisely evolves around Andrew Largeman (Braff), who is effectively `sleep walking' through life, only awoken by the death of his mother. He finds himself at home for the first time in years meeting old friends and making new ones, in particular Sam (Portman). The real key to the film is the characters and their relationships, such as the contrast between the `numb' Braff and quirky-happy-go-lucky Portman. The relationship between father and son is also enjoyable to watch, raising questions on just how much control a father should have.

Zach Braff comes home for his mother's funeral after years of being away. Of course coming home brings up all the reasons he left and never returned before. And he has to deal with and resolve these problems. That is both perceived and real. His portrayal of going home and meeting old friends and family seem very realistic to me.

Eventually we have the ever-beautiful Natalie Portman enter into his life and she starts to accompany him during his last days with his friends of his youth. Her character as well as some quirks she needs to work through.

The characters in this movie have their own unique ways about them. And get just enough screen time to fill out the story line and seem real. The movie takes us through a range of emotions. And yet there are a couple of classic scenes that you will find yourself laughing at.

The soundtrack of this film is as enjoyable as watching the film was. A mix of golden oldies and fresh indie-pop, this is a mellow sweet collection. The sound track stands on its own merit. But the beautiful music of ""Garden State's"" soundtrack serves as a poignant reminder of the movie.

Unlike other's who have written bad reviews I think that this quirky movie stands on its own and is worth seeing. Watch it with a date.",1129939200,,1580,4.415807560137457
1517508,5,B00005JNC2,"I think ""Scrubs"" is a terrible show, so I had no desire to see Zach Braff's movie ""Garden State"" when it was released. I heard a lot of good things about it, though, and the soundtrack rocks, so I finally decided to watch it when it was on cable, and OH MY GOD! This is SUCH an amazing movie! Braff wrote the script as well as directed and starred in the film, and he did a fabulous job. Braff's character, Andrew, is a small-time actor in L.A. who returns to his home state of New Jersey following the death of his mother. Andrew's emotions are in high gear and he passes the time by hanging out with some old school buddies (including the very talented Peter Sarsgaard, who plays Mark) and beginning a tentative relationship with a slightly crazy girl (Natalie Portman) who somehow brings him comfort.

Braff, Sarsgaard, and the rest of the cast of ""Garden State"" are amazing in this film, but Portman steals the show with her hilarious performance as Sam. This movie is very touching but also very funny, and I enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice in a row! It's a wonderful story about seeking out what you want in life and making the most of it. I highly recommend it!",1128988800,3,1179,4.383561643835616
1517509,2,B00005JNC2,"This movie has potential, but fails in a big way. There is absolutely no plot. Nothing really happens. Maybe if there was less telling and more showing, perhaps with flashbacks so that we can get to know the main character's mother and understand, there would be some kind of story going on. The film does a good job of showing the numbing of folks nowadays with the prescription drug culture that exists today, but does not illustrate any reasoning or thoughts behind it, the fears that people have of life. The ending was the worst with again, nothing happening. Yeah, it's like life, but this is a movie and by golly, without a story, why bother watching? I can observe life around me already. I really wanted to see if the main character would stick around after experiencing one of Natalie Portman's character's seizures. I also thought that her character was much too young to be involved in a realtionship with the main character. How old was she anyways, especially since she was still living at home?

A very 2-dimensional film that does a good job of being cute and quirky, but no attempt is made to scratch below the surface and to reveal any story whatsoever.",1128470400,10,1171,4.657004830917875
1517510,1,B00005JNC2,"And ""Garden State"" will. If you can listen to the music they feature in most Starbucks outlets without wanting desperately to find the nearest scimitar and give yourself a full van Gogh, then this is your movie. (Me, I hear a few minor chords on an acoustic and a Dan Fogelberg wannabe on the vocals, and I'm out the front door before you can say ""double latte extra venti mocha skim decaf"".) The annoying Zach Braff stars in and also directs this way-too-edgy coming-of-age depressicom, and he throws in so much gratuitous homage to ""The Graduate""---including a silly pool scene, a mom-teenager affair a la Mrs. Robinson, a couple of surreal airport visits, and--what's this?-- a floppy-haired, quirky protagonist suffering from alienation and emoting all over the place---that when you finally hear an actual Simon-Garfunkel tune (""The Only Living Boy In New York"") about three-quarters through the film it sounds as natural as Teddy Kennedy screaming at a slow bartender.

Unlike Dustin Hoffman's Ben Braddock, who was an outsider by temperament, the character played by Braff, Andrew Largeman (get it? not sure I do) has some very legit reasons for his inability to connect. I won't give away the plot secrets here, but if you go out for popcorn at exactly the wrong minute, none of this movie will ever make any sense. On the other hand, there probably is no wrong moment in this movie to go out for popcorn or even for a two day business trip. Anyhow, because of some really really bad stuff that happened a long time ago (involving a very young Andrew and his mother, OK? Don't ask, really), Largeman is estranged from his psychiatrist father, and only comes home from Los Angeles to the eponymous eastern seaboard locale in order to attend said mother's funeral. Back in Jersey, he meets up with some of his quirky stay-at-home high school chums, including the oily Peter Sarsgaard as a cemetery worker with some very strange hobbies not limited to filching jewelry from cadavers.

A meet-cute encounter at the neurologist's office with the quirky Sam (Natalie Portman, with Spock ears intact, a bit of Naboo still in her eyes, and a sign on her forehead reading ""I'm seriously nuts"") introduces Andrew to the kind of family he wishes he had--warm, loving, lots of hugs, adopted African student (making ""Garden State"" the second movie in very recent memory-- the initially promising but ultimately disappointing ""I Heart Huckabees"" is the other---to establish a family's big heartedness by plunking an African adoptee into the middle of the love-filled zaniness). In Sam, Andrew's finally found the kind of girl who's bound to change his life forever if only he'll let her inside the walled garden (get the double-entendre of the title?) of his soul. Lots of fun follows as Andrew introduces Sam to his shifty pals, but before you know it, Andrew's four-day visit is over, and he has to head back to LA to resume his movie ""career"". But first things first: a rapprochement of sorts with the icy Dr. Dad, a crying scene with Sam, and, of course, the obligatory self-discovery trip to a major geological find in the center of Newark right on the site where some crass capitalists were about to build a mall before they were foiled by the, uh, quirky urban homesteader whose sense of purpose opens Andrew's heart.

I though the two principals were perfect for the roles they were playing.  Of course, Braff wrote his own part, so that should be expected.  What constantly amazes me about Portman is that she is so adaptable to the parts she is playing.  I was dismayed at her performance in Star Wars III, but after watching this film, I realize... that is what was asked of her - and where Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson, or a more forceful actor would gripe about the lines or pacing... she just did exactly what was asked of her.  Just food for thought.

Also, you really should watch the deleted scenes... some are funny, some are poignant and some explain plot a tad bit better.

The tone of the movie, the photography and the acting are really good, Natalie Portman standing out (As usual!!!) portraying Sam.  The humor is candid and the script is nothing less than beautiful and smart.

The movie's music was perfectly chosen, playing an important role in the movie by setting the tone for the plot. Frou Frou's song wraps up perfectly the movie's message in less than 3 minutes!!!  The acting is well done and is credible, the characters have some depth in them although not that much, but still they don't feel superficial or poorly developed.  This movie is about coming to terms with our lives, living the moment and taking life for what it is. And there, dear friends, is where its beauty lies.",1126915200,3,1047,4.445026178010472

I don't understand how anybody who knows anything about film could take this trash seriously, the acting is absolutely terrible (shut up and die natalie portman!), the writing is discustingly selfindulgent and the direction equally so.

Smells like a giant music video scam for all us indie rock suckers...""oh I loved the music and wasn't the movie just darling."" Never mind that the movie seemed to be a bunch of ideas from main actor/writer/director Braff's old college notebook written when he was most likely under the influence of his own ego tripping and stoned out of his gourd. He used these clever ideas in his notebook and pasted them together, added a little filler, and voila a movie was born. Some of these ideas from his ganja-ridden notebook actually are funny and clever. It is the pasting together of these little ""spots of time"" where the movie turns sour. The movie becomes cliche, downright stupid, and so utterly predictable emotionally. When it isn't predictable emotionally it suffers from randomness for the sake of randomness (which isn't a talent). Too often mister director often seems to rest trite little indierocka film's foundation on such randomness.

1517548,5,B00005JNC2,"Garden State is the directorial debut of Zach Braff, better known as J.D. on Scrubs, the wildly popular comedy on NBC. Zach plays the lead role of Andrew Largeman, an actor in Hollywood whose biggest role was playing a mentally challenged person on a television show. It was apparent though that he wasn't doing many acting roles as of late since he was working in a Vietnamese restaurant at the start of the movie.

Andrew returns home to attend the funeral of his paraplegic mother who drowned, and over the course of a few days, he looks around to notice that while some things change, a lot of it stays the same. It's a clich&egrave;, but the saying ""you can't go home again"" is pretty apparent throughout this movie. Looking around you see all of his friends from high school, save one, are complete losers, and even the one who isn't that invented silent velcro isn't exactly a model citizen. They are all in dead-end jobs and drug and alcohol users.

The turnaround point comes when Andrew talks to his father, who is a doctor, about headaches and sets him up with a colleague. In the doctor's office, he meets Sam, who is played by Natalie Portman. I have seen Natalie Portman in quite a few roles, and of all of them, the character she played in this movie is my personal favorite. It turns out that Sam is an epileptic pathological liar with a love for all things animal and works in a law firm. Throughout the movie, the two of them get to know each other better, and strong romantic feelings develop. You can just tell there is chemistry between the two. They find a niche early on and it just seems natural.

Among my favorite parts of the movie is in the beginning, when Andrew gives Sam a ride home on the motorcycle, but she refuses to ride in the sidecar, because that would imply she was his bitch. While that was amusing, it was more amusing later in the movie when we see Mark riding in the sidecar. I'm not sure if it was meant to be implied, but that would mean that Mark was Andrew's bitch.

As with any love story, this one ends with a happy ending, but I am not going to say how, because I don't want to blow the movie for you. I definitely put this at the top of my list of must have movies of the year.",1124668800,2,2229,4.3253588516746415

There was no drama (the character's mom dies and he goes back to visit his estranged father and he's as listless as someone standing in a very long line for an ATM).  It was as humorless as a drive across northern Texas on I-40.,1124409600,6,401,4.32
1517550,4,B00005JNC2,"There is a lot to like about ""Garden State"", the story of a young actor's return from Hollywood to New Jersey for his mother's funeral.  There are a lot of wryly funny jokes.  Several good and interesting songs can be heard in the movie.  Zach Braff and Peter Sarsgaard convincingly display different flavors of ennui.  There are many memorable scenes and images in the movie -- it was thoughtfully written and filmed.

But there are at least two things that bothered me about the movie -- one that struck me while I was watching it, and one that occurs to me as I look back at the film.  One is, simply, Natalie Portman.  She's supposed to be the mysterious pixie-next-door who's both enchanting and a bit damaged, but I did not find her remotely believeable.  The chemistry that should have developed between her and Braff just fizzled.  Over and over I kept thinking ""Oh God, she's annoying"", and waited for her to show some appealing characteristics, but I never saw any.  It was very frustrating -- in the middle of an otherwise nicely acted indie film was this Hollywood star, apparently cast because of her big-name cachet, who just didn't have the screen presence to make me like her character at all.

My other complaint is that Braff's character is supposed to develop, shaking off the shackles of his complacency and medication and father's stern gaze, but it's not really visible.  I can only recall one scene where Braff is actually dynamic.  I liked his performance in general, but I thought there should have been a little more, I don't know, fireworks in the movie.  I probably wouldn't even have this complaint if Ms. Portman didn't let me down so much -- she should have seemed like a catalyst for his development, and not just like a girl with nothing better to do.

But don't pay too much attention to my grumbling -- I still thought ""Garden State"" was worth seeing, worth hearing, and worth thinking about afterwards.",1124409600,3,1938,4.6923076923076925
1517551,2,B00005JNC2,"Like many other reviewers here, I wanted to like this movie, but was left dissapointed, and for the life of me I  can't understand the critical acclaim for this fluff, because there are just so many movies in the same genre done much better.

I'll spare the synoposis and cut straight to the problems...

1) Lack of Depth camouflaged with cinematography.  The movie is plagued by relatively long camera angles of competently framed suburban backdrops with long camera zooms and MTV style time lapse.  Think ""Volkswagen commercial"" except a 1 1/2 hour long volkswagen commercial.  The writing isn't horrible and the acting is OK -- there's just nothing really here that you haven't seen before.  Chip away at the facade of the meaningless existence of these 20 somethings and you find there's nothing left to see.

2) Zachs big face.  This guy is IN LOVE WITH HIMSELF!!!!  Wanna play a drinking game?  Watch this movie and take a drink every time Zach's face is full frame looking straight ahead past the camera with a blank expression on his face.  You'll be drunk in 15 minutes.

3) Scrubs style comedy.  I admit it, I can't stand scrubs, as it quick cuts Ferris Bueller style to utterly contrived comedic sequences and screams in your face ""Isn't this funny?""  Braff draws heavily from the same material, but whereas scrubs at least quick cuts, Braff has to draw out the material for a minute to get to the stupid (and predictable) punchline.

4) Dissatisfying conclusion.  This movie keeps leaving you thirsting for something to happen, for some character development, yet from the first minute to the last 10, the character is essentially unchanged -- he life is just as lifeless and meaningless as when he first started (except that I guess being in love with someone equally as screwed up makes it all ok??!!!!) -- then in a dramtic twist, he confronts the source (and solution) to his problem in an argument with his father, and we are left with the answer.  How satisfying is this?  Where's the development???

Watch Reality Bites or Ghost World if you want to see a coming-of-age film of disenfrachised youth across a bleak post-modern backdrop.",1123372800,8,2154,4.817438692098093
1517552,2,B00005JNC2,"I don't want to say anything insulting about this film, because I don't consider it to be a bad film -- I just didn't like it.  And there are basically two reasons why:

1. I didn't find any of the characters likable.  I didn't care what happened to them.  When Zach Braff's character is hanging out with his friends, I was thinking ""If those were my friends...I'd have to get new friends.""  Even Braff's character came across as unlikable -- it seemed like he thought he was too good to be there.

2. With a few rare exceptions, every character in the film sounds like every other character.  You could take any line spoken by a character, and give it to almost any of the other characters and it wouldn't sound out of place.

There are a couple of funny moments in the film, but it's not a comedy, and I wouldn't consider the film as a whole to be funny.  To me, it was a film about a bunch of characters I didn't like, who all spoke exactly the same way.",1122508800,9,957,4.214285714285714

You know how music can change how the way you feel? Well this moive has done that for me.

1517554,2,B00005JNC2,"I must say I had high expectations for this film.  It is not often that a person writes, directs, and acts in his own film.  While Garden State does include some impressive cinematography and camera work, I wish I could say the same about the acting and screenplay.

There was something redundant about the entire film--a seemingly depressed protagonist that returns to his hometown, only to find that his family and former acquaintances have changed for the worse.  We must believe that everybody is in a crisis.  Thus, as the viewer, we are treated to watching twentysomethings engaging in some drug and alcohol binges.

The characterizations were flat and uneventful.  Natalie Portman plays the most upbeat epileptic I've ever seen on-screen, though her apparent lack of a seizure almost shreds the character's credibility.  At least she's not playing a Prozac candidate--Zach Braff is actually given that role.  What can I say about Zach Braff's performance?  Perhaps I'm used to seeing him on the NBC show Scrubs because I was waiting for him to start cracking jokes at any time (probably since he has the same smart-aleck smirk throughout the film).  The film might have had a raw, emotional feeling if Zach Braff switched roles with the more emotive Peter Sarsgaard.

However, a role switch probably wouldn't have had any affect, since the screenplay cops out at the conclusion for a happy ending.  In fact, the film seems to come undone by the last twenty minutes (which included a pointless sex scene that didn't involve the main characters, and the irritating addition of buffoonish Method Man), and tries to make up for its lost momentum.  I think this film had potential, but it was not enough of a ""garden"" variety for me.",1122076800,4,1735,4.917525773195877

I'm not going into the plot. You can read that from other reviews. What I'll say is that the plot is a familiar one and I was dissappointed by that fact. The cast is pretty stellar. Natalie Portman gives a top notch performance. There is nothing wrong with her acting but I still could not find her believable. For me, Peter Skarsgaard stole the show. I kept hoping for more from him. His lazy detachment was a little mesmerizing for me.
I did not expect nor like the constant use of foul language,the constant drug use and vulgar sexual display by the dogs. I thought it all unnecessary to the plot. More could have been done with Ian Holm. He is such a great actor. Furthermore, the ending was so hugely contrived and predictable, I nearly gagged.

I enjoyed Napoleon Dynamite, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Real Women Have Curves, and Tart. None of those movies had serious 'action-packed' plots, and they all could have been about real people's lives. So since this movie falls into the same genre I thought for sure I would like it. Well I was wrong. The overuse of the word 'f***' and all the drug use just seems like it was added in to make the movie more interesting. There is no depth to the characters, they are one-sided and you cannot feel any emotion for them whatsoever. It's like one of those praised pieces of art by indie hipsters that you think you're going to like but you don't, and then the indie hipster walks away shaking his head saying, ""You just don't get IT, do you?""

Yet, the whole plot finally falls into a ""I-love-you-and-I-don't-want-to-leave-you-anymore"" ending. The closure of the movie is disappointing as it seems unconvincing how Largeman (Braff) and Sam (Portman) heal each other's pathological habits and attitudes. Largeman suffers from depression. Why did he experience a siginificant state of epiphany later on? Not clear. Portman claims to ba a pathological liar. Does she really stop lying? Not clear? What is there is merely the romance plot, which, inevitably leads to whole movie to end in a commercial way, like many others high-school romance. Garden State is about the troubled generation, about how the troubled individuals survive in their difficult lives. As a view, I can see how they are troubled, but I can't see how they are relieved. Portman gives an impressive performance, which really revives my memory of her in Closer. Braff's is dull, monotonous and flat.

THEN his mother is killed in an accident and he has to go back home to confront his the loss and his past. In the beginning this character and his (whom I feel) depraved friends are very hopeless.

  Then comes the girl (Natile Portman) into his life-she's,yes just a little left of center but unlike him has no difficulty with emotional expression. For example she and her family have a bad history with pets AND because of her epilepsy is forced to where a helmet to work everyday. Well as the relationship grows Braff finds himself beginning to deal with himself and touch on his repressed feelings. In the end he does and the pair both find comfort in eachother.

  The movie has some dull streches and can be a little slow but the general theme is numbness and as the leading man's emotional 'numbness' regresses the pace of the film quickens. In the beginning 'Garden State' comes off as a highly depressing dark comedy to me and by the end there is some emotional release. It's definately worth seeing once for sure because it deals with how human beings can put repress their true heart on a dime if it suits them. But 'Garden State' is also one of those films of which your opinion of it will depend highly on your mood.

  As for me personally I watched the movie in a rather depressed and lonely state of mind. The feelings it engendered weren't exactly negative but the comedy of the film largly escaped me at times. I knew the jokes were there but they really didn't hit me. Basically I kept sympathising alot with Braff's character-he seemed to be a decent human being in all the wrong situations until he met the right person for him.

  Watch 'Garden State' alone or with a family member-it's not exactly a fun,popcorn movie to have on with a bunch of friends because parts of it are a downer and the sudtle comedy often borders on the morbid. Themes of death,endings and alienation are a recurrent theme throughout-it's not a angst film at all but it's more of a mature kind of sadness. But sadness nevertheless. So watch this and follow it with something more comedic-this film needs a stress reliver afterwards.",1120521600,2,2595,4.509594882729211

This movie should be outlawed or burned Indians with torches. If you want to see a movie that will have you laughing, on the edge of your seat in anticipation and suspense, or even remotely entertaining, I suggest you walk right past this movie, and never look back.

However, since I purchased the DVD ~ 3 weeks ago, I haven't actually watched the film in its entirety because I've been too busy watching the special features!  The set of deleted/shortened scenes was extensive; there is a very thorough ""making of"" movie, which was fun in itself; and (of course) commentary for the film.  I recall trying to go into the theater with an open mind, since I had heard many comments - both good and bad about it.

I always say that if you can want to know what happens next at the end of a movie without the expectancy of a sequel... You've got yourself a good movie. With so many akward moments that almost seem out of place and ponder worthy, it gives you a sense that everything you see is really going on, not to mention the soundtrack... The soundtrack is in the film, I can't say this enought that so many times do you see a film like a few of the songs you hear and then buy the soundtrack and wonder where in the world did that song come from... Not Garden State... Even though I didn't know each and every song that played, once it started it seemed to belong there... It had a certain human thought process to it's placement, and I don't mean the director and music director got together and said 'here here and here' no... It's as if the soundtrack was synced to the characters thoughts and emotions... I'll stop going on tangents now...

1517648,3,B00005JNC2,"At the risk of sounding trite, I would have to say that this movie helped me reevaluate how I looked at my life. It is my belief that anyone who has red blood running through their veins will deal with depression and emotional detachment at some point in their life. This movie, from a purely psychological point of view, helped me at least to make a little bit of sense out of why I feel the way I do when I'm depressed (not that it happens all that often), whether it be family problems or overt dependence on something that merely numbs the pain rather than heals it (in Andrew Largeman's case, anti-depressants). The characters were real, with sincere emotion exuding from their dialogue and action. Braff definitely has potential in writing, and his directing is decent as well. It's an all around good movie.

As far as some other reviews go...well I just have to say that some people are not very good at critiquing art, just criticizing the artist and cutting down people that appreciate the artwork to make themselves look intelligent. Word of advice to all those writing reviews anytime, anywhere: at least use proper grammar and spelling when you're insulting other reviewers.

I did not view it as a comedy, and it certainly isn't ""hilarious"", though being a native of New Jersey I was amused to see how the movie depicted it as the wasteland it is; how people still think it's cool to chain-smoke and do drugs and party and be superficial and boring. The lead character, Andrew, returns to this for his mother's funeral, after having achieved a moderate amount of success as an actor in California. He has been overmedicated and emotionally numb since his mom became a paraplegic many years prior in a freak accident when Andrew was nine. Andrew has just discontinued these meds when he meets the Natalie Portman character, a compulsive liar among other things I found irritating, but under the circumstances and compared to the other slugs he has for friends there in Jersey, he opens up to her, eventually falling in love. As they embrace in Newark Airport, what happens next remains to be seen because that's how the movie ends. My personal instinct would be to board the next flight to anywhere so as not to be sucked into the sludge of New Jersey quicksand. Four days there undergoing Zoloft, Paxil, etc. withdrawal leaves one rather defenseless, but I don't know how much of this story will ring true with viewers from Peoria.

As for the DVD ""extras"", they are no more than hyper-inflated egos actually believing that viewers really care about their every move, what they had for lunch, etc. Now THAT's funny!! (Also typical NJ.)",1118880000,,1621,4.707746478873239
1517650,1,B00005JNC2,"Listen up you ""geek"" filmgoers. This ""movie"" is an overrated pile of frog droppings. Why all of you are prasing it, is beyond me. I think you all suffer from the worst kind of cinema groupthink that happens once a year with idiotic films like this. You and the critics latch onto something in these type of movies that simply isn't there. You project meaning onto shallow simpleminded wannabe ""deep"" indie movies.

This flick, and it's ilk, like Lost in Translation, get critics and cineanerds juicy in their pants for nothing. You want, no need, to think these movies are saying something about the human condition, when in reality, they say absolutley NOTHING. Alternative college indie music, slow paced stories, and trying so hard to be ""quirky"" characters does not a interesting film make.

This film is generic film school stuff. The characters and story have been told a hundred times before in a more original and unique way. The emotions it tries to hit are shallow and amatuerish. This is the kind of drivel that 95 % of wannabe filmmakers at college film schools make. Go to any colleges film festival and you'll see this type of film made by most of the students. It's wholly unoriginal without adding anything new or interesting to the genre. The characters are one dimensionally retarded, their situations are unrealistic even in the movie world they inhabit, and on top of that it fumbles through on the simpliest acts of emotional truth.

Also, on an aside, it even throws in the cliched quirky pretty girl who doesn't know shes pretty with a great, funny, insightful personality that has a tender heart who understands pain and see past the main characters flaws and annoyances. It's maddening how many generic characters they threw into the stew. The emotionally closed off main character. the cold father, the free spirited friend, dumb locals who stayed in town but every now and again spout words of wisdom.

I could go on, but you get the drift. I hated every second, and it feels every second of it's hour and 45 minutes, of this pretentious over praised, shallow, lame, cliched piece of you know what. I pity anyone who owns this, and has seen it more than once.",1118534400,8,2186,4.759894459102902
1517651,5,B00005JNC2,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I know that this is a pretty simplistic statement, but then again I thought that many of the messages conveyed through this movie were subtle and simple.  As someone who can identify with the idea of walking through the haze of life in a medicated state for false reasons, I felt this movie really spoke to that side of me.  There is more to life and things are not as bad as you might have been led to believe.  Things are not always your fault and it is possible to find happiness through it all.

Okay, this is supposed to be a review, not a personal revelation.  I thought the acting and directing were wonderful, especially for a first time director/writer.  Zach Braff has a brilliant way of getting his point accross in a way that is easily taken, even when the material is a bit more difficult.  I like it when movies are more subtle on subjects and less ""in your face.""

The bottom line for me is that I own this movie.  I don't go out and buy a lot of movies for my collection, but this is one of them.",1118275200,4,1042,4.217171717171717
1517652,5,B00005JNC2,"Easily my favouite film from the last year, this film by Zach Braff succeeds completely on it's own terms. By turns it is wholly engaging, hilarious, sad, touching and profound.

Natalie Portman plays her very best role here, in fact the entire cast seem to completely understand Braff's universe and relish his attraction to faulted but ultimately endearing characters. Here is a film with no right and wrong, no bad guys and good guys and no simple answers - just a willingness to understand the chaos that makes people what they are.

Braff's performance at once emotionally numb and brimming over with feeling somehow draws you in by making him simultaneously an object of pity and amusement, whether waiting in an MD's waiting room with an alsation humping his leg, or standing on top of a van with a plastic garbage bag on screaming, he cleverly embodies all the uncertainty and comic pathos of being young.

I recommend this film to literally anyone - the soundtrack is perfectly married to the film (one of the best in years) and while the aesthetic  is that of a quaint indie production it cuts through to anyone with a heart and a sense of humour.",1118275200,,1157,4.712871287128713
1517653,4,B00005JNC2,"There are some really artful moments captured by Braff, whilst Andrew's friends seek to null themselves in drugs he inversely begins to wake from such a state.

The story goes on to resolve a number of important issues for Andrew, during which, Braff makes it clear that everyone around him suffers a similar fate. Everyone around him deals with issues of their own. In hindsight, its a simple story blown up to chaotic proportions, but I guess that is the story of many people from a higher socioeconomic background. It deals with suffering of the western man. Baff makes contrast of this with the ""african brother"" who's life struggles and accomplishments could put all of them to shame. Its a realization that goes begging... to each is their own I guess, for a state of depression is a curse just as awful as any other misfortune. Anyone who has suffered from it, can tell you this.

There are many concepts to be drawn from this movie, which I found quite intruiging. However, I wish Andrew's life had not involved a tragic childhood experience and strong medicated drugs (Lithium), because often there doesn't have to be apparent excuses for such an incapacitated state. I feel that somewhat undermines the message of this movie.

On top of that, it plays stage to one hell of a soundtrack with some of my favourites, such as 'the shins'. I would have never thought I'd see their ""new slang"" track on a hollywood movie back in 2001. Finally some indie rock getting the attention it deserves. Cleverly hand picked and incoporated by Braff. Respect!",1118102400,2,1553,4.765799256505576
1517654,5,B00005JNC2,"I was told that seeing this movie would ""change my life."" In a way, I think it did.

In no way, is this a conventional film. In no way whatsoever. It does not follow your conventional plotline scheme, the situations are completely unexpected and the relationships characters totally neurotic (all in their own ways.)

Braff does an excellent job in crafting a story that is connectable yet very off the wall. His performance is equally as striking as the emotionally distance twentysomething. His world is turned upside down when he meets Natalie Portman's character, Sam, who is her own brand of girl. She's smart, delightful, vibrant and off-the wall.

The soundtrack is fabulous, especially Frou Frou's ""Let Go"", ""Such Great Heights"" by Iron and Wine (a postal serivce cover), and ""Don't Panic"" by Coldplay.

This is really a story of the human condition. It's about finding yourself, living each day and never becoming numb to life. It's also about companionship and love. It's about finding that person that brings out the life in you, the vitality.

I love this movie, because it's so original and really thought provoking. It's characters are off-beat, and not cookie cutter types. They are original and real, like real people. We are all a little odd aren't we?!? This is a beautifully written, directed, imagined and presented work of art. Something that I hope Zach is proud of, and something that you MUST see. Go get it.

I've seen enough quirky, feel-good love stories that I've grown a bit jaded on them. But from the start this one feels different. It is quirky, but not in a canned, contrived way. Each little episode lives and breaths on its own. I laughed out loud several times. Natalie Portman is great. Her role here reminds me of the child actor she was from Leon (The Professional), and that's a good thing. She's versatile and full of life and bubbling with humor. So, it's not that anything in this movie is surprising. It's just that its done so lovingly, with great care and craftsmanship. Zach Braff obviously wanted to make a lasting, quality film. He's done that, and this one will last as a favorite just as Say Anything or Heathers or Edward Scissorhands has.

1517656,5,B00005JNC2,"Andrew Largeman has been on anti-depressants and mood enhancers so long he doesn't know what to feel when he gets the call that his mother has died. The one-time actor, best known for playing a mentally challenged football player in a television movie, drops everything and heads home to New Jersey for the first time in eight years.

Largeman may have boarded the plane with just the shirt on his back, but arrives in the Garden State with more personal baggage than the Hilton sisters at a sleep-over.

Garden State, which marks the writing-directing debut of star Zach Braff (Scrubs), is a finely- tuned character study that has a lot to say about the human condition. All jokes aside, Garden State emerges as a breath of fresh air in a stagnant late August, a film that not only has something to say, but does so in a refreshing, off-the-cuff approach. As the film's triple threat, Braff is to be commended on not just making an assured debut behind the camera, but for making a film that should stand up to the test of time.

As the film's writer, I was constantly amazed at Braff's observations and depth of reference. You never feel that these characters only exist within the confines of the frame. As director, Braff has picked a winning cast who bring his characters to life. Each and every one draw us into Braff's world, hitting just the right pitch to match the script's unique blend of dark comedy and raw emotion. Once we become part of this world, it's hard to leave.

Braff peppers the script with casual insights and bits of business that captivate us with their simplicity and honesty. There are revelations, but their design isn't to slap us across the face but expose us to another level of the truth, and it's this sincerity that makes Garden State so inviting. These may be dysfunctional people, but at least their not afraid to admit it.

Once home, Largeman makes the rounds, connecting with old friends (Peter Sarsgaard, perfectly laid back), new loves (Natalie Portman, sweet and engaging), marginal acquaintances (half the town thinks he killed himself), finally settling down for the much dreaded father-son confrontation with Ian Holm as the appropriately distant patriarch.

Braff is to be admired for making a film that is as entertaining as it is thoughtful. His talent and connections have afforded him the opportunity to create rather than regurgitate. He didn't squander the opportunity.",1117584000,2,2423,4.854721549636804

Spell broken, you have a few more scenes to savor Natalie Portman's thespian stylings as ""wacky Queen Amidala in the burbs,"" Zac Braff's bizarrely puffy lips and a soundtrack that keeps things moving but never adds up to much. The DVD extras are painful: Everyone talks like they're making ""Citizen Kane"" or something. I guess they didn't read the script.

1517699,5,B00005JNC2,"First and foremost, a little bit about myself.  I was very reluctant to watch this movie.  My tastes in film, I thought, were quite narrow, limited mostly to ""indie"" films like Requiem for a Dream, Memento, Dogville, stuff by David Lynch, documentaries, foreign films, political/social themed films, and so forth.  I detest 'cookie-cutter' romatic comedies, and forget the plot rather quickly if I happen to watch one.

When I first heard of Garden State (at my book store after it came out on DVD!), I had no clue as to what it was about.  The cover graphic didn't suggest anything of great interest, but the word of mouth was pretty good.  I had no reason not to see it, so I decided to pick up a copy at my library.  The film was great and had to be watched multiple times.

What makes this movie so unique is the richness of the characters, the development of the plot, and the geniune emotions that are evoked.  Garden State will appeal to many men like myself because of Zach Braff's character, to whom many young adults can relate to.  Natalie Portman, whose character isn't introduced until about half an hour into the film, is completely unlike any other movie she has starred in, much better I would say.  The humor is not overwhelming, but very tactful and sometimes hidden, making for a much more authentic emotion.  The development of the story and the climax is less predictable than in most films.  This nature of the characters in addition to the way the plot develops makes for a very unique 'emotional' experience that is lacking in most movies that contain romance, at least for men.

The soundtrack to the film is great, - every single song is nice to listen to, especially the Coldplay's opening credits, and the ""Let Go"" of the end credits.  There are certainly some plot 'flaws' that other reviewers mention, including the lack of depth and story behind Natalie Portman's character, but is just too minascule to have significance, especially for a comedy that is not exactly meant to be completely realistic.  Those who dislike this film, it seems to me, cannot relate in any way to the characters or the story, which is understandable.  Most people, however, should not have this problem.",1116720000,4,2212,4.71875
1517700,4,B00005JNC2,"This is a movie that makes a good try at being ""deep meaning"" with a little humor thrown in but falls short.  Zach Braff plays a displaced New Jersey young man who has moved to California and when he is not playing part-time actor he is wearing ""Charlie Chan"" make-up in a pretentious Vietnamese restaurant.

Zach gets a call from his father to return home to New Jersey because his mother has drowned in a bathtub accident.  The dreamy, kind of insensitive Zach feels it is his duty to go.  He kind of day dreams through the ceremony at the cemetary and then goes out partying with heavy drugs with his friends.

Zach complains to his father about sharp headaches and his father sends him to a neurologist to get checked out.  While there, two significant things happen.  First he meets Natalie Portman who is kind of spaced out herself and then he learns that his problems are probably related to the drugs his psychiatrist father has been proscribing for him.

Zach happens on Natalie later on and the two start hanging out together.  There relationship slowly blooms and as there relationship improves they both realize that they are not really losers.  Zach's problems relate to both the drugs he was taking and the guilt he had been carrying from a childhood incident involving his mother.

1517702,4,B00005JNC2,"""Garden State"" is a delightful, quirky film, geared to entertain with its eccentric characters and bizarre, dark humor. A coming-of-age tale long overdue, this is a magical, edgy romantic comedy, (that guys will enjoy), with some hilarious moments, as well as a few tremendously moving ones. And the acting is excellent! I was left with a warm and fuzzy feeling for hours after the conclusion - a welcome change from the film I saw prior to this, which gave me a headache!.

Zach Braff wrote the intelligent screenplay, directed it and plays Andrew Largeman, a twenty-six year old who hasn't had a feeling since age nine, when his psychiatrist father, (Ian Holm), medicated him with almost everything available on the pharmacological market to block anger, anxiety, and depression. (The reason for the pill consumption will be revealed in the movie). Since Andrew was always too zombied-out to consider changing shrinks, he has been on meds every since. All Dr. Largeman wanted, and wants, (so he says), is for his son to be happy. Originally from the great state of NJ, Andrew now lives in LA where he pursues an acting career and works as a waiter. He's best known for his role as a retarded quarterback in a TV series.

Dad calls Andrew one morning to inform him his mother died, (she drowned in the bathtub), and asks him to come home for the funeral. In his heart and mind Andrew knows you can't go home again - he hasn't even tried for almost a decade. However, his mom's funeral is a worthy enough cause to justify his return to the Garden State. When he boards the plane, he leaves his pills behind.

After the funeral, Andrew studiously avoids his dad and reunites with some boyhood friends. Almost all are major underachievers. Pal Mark works as a grave digger...who occasionally robs the dead, and is almost permanently attached at the mouth to his bong. His mom (Jean Smart) is, literally, a space cadet. Another buddy works at a medieval reenactment restaurant as a knight, and wears armor to work. The group's success story is Jesse, (Armando Riesco), who invented a silent substitute for Velcro, has made mega money, and gives great parties. Into this crazy mix comes the luminous Sam, (Natalie Portman is absolutely terrific here)!

Andrew visits a neurologist because he is experiencing brief but acute headaches. He meets the free-spirited Sam at the doctor's office. She is totally charming, fresh, and epileptic - something she does not tell Andrew for some time. He gives her a ride home and she invites him in just in time to bury her pet hamster. He gets to attend yet another funeral, this time at the family's overpopulated pet cemetery. The combination of zero meds in his system, the knowledge that he can indeed cope without the prescription cocktail, and Sam's warmth, courage and acceptance, allows Andrew to open himself to emotion again. He is even able to confront his father.

""Garden State"" is a perfect date movie, also good for rainy days and Saturday night at home with popcorn. The scene at the abyss is memorable - something to look  forward to!

The one thing I thoroughly enjoyed was how you noticed his attitude about life changed. At first, Largeman was so disaffected and numb to everything, mainly because of his ""treatment"". Towards the end he was smiling and enjoying, and BEING in the moment.

The one thing I would have changed was the discussion with his dad about his mom's death. One of the deleted scenes really delves into the convo, and it should have been part of the movie.

First of all, the acting in this movie is not that great.  Braff's character of Largeman in the movie is supposed to be an actor, but it is laughable that the constantly sedated character could ever be even a bad actor because the character has no personality whatsoever.  I like Braff's character on Scrubs, but I don't think he hit the mark in this movie.  Portman's acting isn't that great either and I agree that her character is pretty annoying.

Secondly, the plot of the movie is stupid.  Largeman's mother became a quadraplegic by hitting her head on the dishwasher and later died by drowning.  These events are even less believed when Braff describes them in his sedated state.  And the romance between Braff and Portman plain and boring.  Finally, I don't really know what the whole point of them going down into a gorge was and way it was a big deal that they stood at the edge and screamed.  It was not a pivitol point in the movie, it was lackluster.

There were so many things that I wanted to happen in this movie that just didn't happen. It sounded so promising, but unfortunatley it was disappointing.  I think that my only favorate part was that one character in the movie collected Desert Storm trading cards.  I remember those when I was a kid.  I thought they were pretty stupid back then but it was funny that the makers of this movie remembered them.",1116028800,8,1630,4.493197278911564
1517705,3,B00005JNC2,"This is a hard movie for me to rate. Its probably more like 3.5 stars. I enjoyed it and thought it was very well made, especially for a first time write and director. There are some very funny moments but it is not hilarious as I've seen some reviewers say. It is a very good character piece that is quirky and odd but not too much so that it turns you off.

Zach Braff plays an emotionally disconnected actor who comes home for the first time in 9 years for his mother's funeral. He spends his time reconnecting with old friends and avoiding his father. He meets Natalie Portman's character, an odd girl who he falls in love with. I liked the way the romance was underplayed and yet was integral in Braff's character beginning to come to terms with things in his life. I thought Portman was great in this movie, although the character could be slightly annoying.

Overall, Garden State is funny, but not hilarious. It's very well done, if a little too slow in pace at times.",1115337600,2,975,4.411111111111111

The soundtrack is excellent; the cast is great, the acting is very good, the story is interesting and Braff shows he has an excellent eye behind the camera.  I would recommend this film.

Extras include two commentary tracks, one with Braff and Portman, the other with Braff and his DP, editor and production designer; 16 deleted scenes with optional commentary; a 27-minute making-of featurette; 3 minutes of outtakes; and a soundtrack promo.

1517707,3,B00005JNC2,"Definitely has a Jersey feel to it - I spent about 5 days there once.

The ""you can't go back home"" plot is believeable; some of the plot devices are a little too trendy for my tastes. Portman's acting is way over the top and embarassing, but possibly she's doing the character as written. I mean - would a dog owner really tell you to ""kick the dog's balls"" over and over again? The music is great and I'm sure inspired many an iPod download, but the visual effects are a little too impressionistic and forced.

One warning is that there is a strong ""drug theme"" to this movie. The drug use isn't over-abundant and doesn't descend too far into complete decadence, although I hope my kids never experience the kind of meaninglessness and drug experimentation that's in this film. Mostly it's a plot device representing who's in control, ""letting go"", etc., and is set against the legal 'script' medication that the guy's father has him on.

Braff tells the story of an emotionally distant young man learning to reconnect with life, as he returns home and faces his old life and a fascinating girl. The story is crucial today, as Braff's obvious detachment from the world is representative of how many people live their lives (in a less obvious way). The movie breaks no boundaries and it has no need to - the beauty of its execution stands alone. The acting, set design, cinematography and music are perfectly chosen. All of this gives the movie an ethereal air to it - almost like we are in some strange fairy tale dreamworld where Braff makes his way through various bizarre situations until he is finally allowed to wake up.

One of the songs featured in this movie is a song played by Sam Beam (a.k.a. Iron and Wine). Though he did not write the song, I tend to relate Iron and Wine's music with this movie - it is honest, beautiful and slow. Maybe that is why some people find this movie to be boring - it does not move along at a fast pace and is content to tell a story in a very beautiful way. Those who don't connect with the story are bound to be bored with the movie. Those who do connect will be greatly rewarded.",1114473600,4,1254,4.313559322033898

1517763,3,B00005JNC2,"Garden State is a quirky little love story written, directed, and starring Zach Braff; the atypical residential intern of NBC's Sitcom Scrubs.

The film centers around Andrew Largeman (Braff), a two-bit actor just scraping by in Hollywood. At the beginning of the film, Largeman receives a call from his father (played by Ian Holm) to return home because his mother has died by drowning. Largeman returns home as the conquering hero, resting mostly on the laurels of his made-for-TV movie, in which he played a handicapped individual.

Largeman quickly reacquaints himself who his childhood oddball friends, which include: a kleptomaniac gravedigger, a knight's-of-the-roundtable dinner theater waiter, and a guy who has invented ""no-sound"" Velcro (which also made him rich).

As the story progresses, we learn that Largeman has been away from home for quite so time due to a childhood accident in which he permanently paralyzed his mother. His psychiatrist father has had him under medication since the age of 9, and has never quite gotten over blaming Largeman for the incident. Largeman has also decided to use his mother's death, as justification to discontinue his medication.

Along the way, Largeman meets Sam (played by Natalie Portman), who is everything that he's not; and a relationship is formed. With Sam's help, Largeman is finally able to face his demons, his father, and start living his life coherently.

Garden State is bizarre at times; however, always genuine. It's a cute little film worth looking for.

From the initial meeting of Portman and Braff up to the very last scene, every moment is authentic and true.  One cannot help cheering for them both.

For a director, Braff's acting is quite good but few actresses are capable of putting forth a performance like Natalie Portman.  In fact, I can't think of any. She is utterly amazing and by far the most compelling character in the movie. Portman is an idealization of the pleasant, playful, penetrating coquette we've all read about but rarely meet.  Frankly, it's a joy to have  her on the screen.  I read online that Portman's father was a fertility specialist--I should say so! I don't know how any man could resist her, particularly in this alluring role.

Garden State is a movie about love, friendship, life, and family and its effect is total gratification.  I'll go out on a limb here and say that this one's now lodged into my lifetime Top 10.

1517779,3,B00005JNC2,"Progressing from the rather limited realm of television productions to the far more expansive universe of major motion pictures can be quite an overwhelming experience for any aspiring young performer, as some have found out the hard way. The cast members of Friends, for example, with the exception of Miss Jennifer Aniston of course, have had little in the way of success making the transition - David Schwimmer has had no box office hits, Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow have each at least one cult classic (in spite of both being ruined by their unnecessary sequels - when will Hollywood learn), Matt LeBlanc had the Charlie's Angels franchise (though he was never featured prominently), and Courtney Cox made the best with both the Scream franchise and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (all of this in spite of the fact that she is married to David Arquette). Is it so much a mystery now as to why they demanded so much money per episode in the final season? They knew they would not be finding much in the way of work after the show ended. Sure there are success stories, but those who take make the leap gamble their future career opportunities in Hollywood.

The story follows a man coming to grips with who he is and where his life is going following the death of his mother. Andrew Largeman did not live a carefree childhood back in his home state of New Jersey. Following an incident when he was young where he pushed his mother, causing her to be placed in a wheelchair for the rest of her life, his father, a psychiatrist, ships him off to boarding school. He also prescribes to him dozens of anti-depressant medications which cause him to feel numb to the world around him. Now a moderately successful actor, Andrew makes the decision to go cold-turkey off the prescription drugs he has taken for fifteen years and return home to reconcile not only with his estranged father but also with himself following the death of his mother in a bathtub. In the short time he spends back in New Jersey, he reconnects with all his old friends who have each gone their separate ways in the world and meets Sam, a girl who is everything that he isn't, who teaches him how to open himself up to the world. The story for Garden State, albeit adequately endowed with the comprehensive themes relative to the condition of the human spirit and the adolescent reflections upon life its key demographic necessitates, remains lax in terms of the script's focus and direction. Braff is hell-bent on presenting to his audience every little quirk and peculiarity he can recall about the state of New Jersey, some of which were well established long before this film came out, so much so that blowback occurs where in the pacing within the more somber moments of the movie feel way off from the rest of the picture. Another fortuitous result of these eccentric occurrences is that Garden State develops this tendency toward creating transitional sequences, most notably the one in which Method Man cameos as the operator of peeping-tom business in the back of a hotel, which serve no purpose in stimulating the storyline and only adds further hindrance to the movie's moderate pacing.

For what it is worth, acclamation should be given to Zach Braff for a valiant effort in soliciting the responsibility of acting not only as the film's screenwriter and director but its leading man as well, all of which were firsts for him with Garden State. As anyone who has ever embarked on such a cinematic challenge of the limits of both patience and ambition, even for those not in their initial effort, can tell you, achieving the proper tone and style in which to win over the audience is an intricate balancing act so rarely achieved in the modern mainstream Hollywood environment. With that in mind, Braff's efforts in the role of Andrew Largeman, the protagonist of the picture, are like those of the character himself in that they are only moderately successful. Specific scenes opposite Portman or Holm in which they are seen interacting with each other through a segment of honest dialogue successfully demonstrates his proficiency in bringing out the intensity within his character, but at the same time fails to properly illustrate to his audience the dramatic shift in emotions Andrew experiences from the beginning to the end of the movie. Not to say that he should be seen on the floor near the end balling his eyes out but at least show some variance from the insipid, melancholic countenance expressed through nearly the entire picture. Natalie Portman gleams with this illuminating radiance in the role of Sam, the romantic interest of Andrew Largeman, and is suited perfectly opposite Braff in the charming subplot of the film, though it was felt as if this portion of the screenplay could have been expanded upon earlier rather then later in the picture, but in any case it works out fine. Though this is certainly not what one would consider as being Oscar-caliber material in the sense, still if Julia Roberts could be nominated for her rather simplistic role in Pretty Woman then anything is possible - as long as you play a hooker that is, she is a treasure to watch onscreen in this film nonetheless.

Ian Holm, the brilliantly talented British actor more commonly remembered for his recent appearance as Bilbo Baggins in the highly successful Lord of the Rings trilogy, is greatly underutilized in the role of Andrew's father, Gideon Largeman. The rather intense interactions and conversational engagements held between Holm and Braff sprinkled sporadically throughout the film are intriguing and poignantly insightful into how divergent the relationship between father and son can become as a result of elevated variant emotions in regards to a single incident involving a loved one. The lack of development within this specific element of the screenplay is truly what made the end result of Garden State all the more disappointing to witness. Time would have been better spent concentrating on the elaboration of the anguish and resentment held for each other which has brought their relationship to a head at this point in their lives, rather then the mindless quirks of the town's residents. Speaking of which, Jean Smart's Carol (Mark's mother) and Armando Riesco's Jesse (a friend of Andrew's whose newfound wealth has stemmed from his creation of the silent Velcro) are two within the film's cast of quirky characters that should have been given something more valuable to do that would have merited their time and involvement in the project or else cut out entirely.

Overall, in regards to the emotions Garden State invokes, it would appear as though art does imitate life - the intense anguish and sadness it produces from the prospects of what might have been make it nearly unbearable at times, but when all is said and done you do not regret having taken the ride. Putting it more sincerely, Garden State is not exactly a fantastic film, but there are enough memorable moments contained in it to make it at least recommended for someone else to watch. The film's most egregious oversight would unquestionably have to be its ending, which comes off as being half-assed and anti-climatic to audience members unreceptive to ludicrous clichs. Sensing perchance that he could not tangibly achieve the ""happily ever after"" outcome that both he and his audience naively desired with the direction in which the story was heading toward, Braff in total disregard to the characters he created rashly ties up all the loose plot elements instead of allowing them be who they are. Although there is nothing unethical about using maledictions and nudity in movies, within reason of course, a complexity does arise when these are used in excess of what is necessary. And what was with Andrew Largeman going completely cold-turkey on the anti-psychotic medication his father prescribed for him? Having taken what would seem to be an exuberant amount of prescriptions for over fifteen, had he never heard of medical withdrawal? This is not a huge sticking point but realistically speaking this would not have been feasible and should not be recommended for anyone on with such considerable prescriptions. Instead the larger deliberation lies in what is presumed to be Braff's assumption which is that anti-depressant medication has made people numb to the world around them and that it has done far more harm then good, admirable their intentions or not. Although one can certainly argue that the modern generation has evolved into a society which has sought quick-fix solutions to their problems through prescription medication with little, if any, risk of side-effects, it would flat-out ignorant to believe all are unnecessary. Sure, there are those who take this medication for a condition they do not have, there is always a bad apple somewhere in the bunch, but a majority of them do need these prescriptions, in combination with psychological therapy, in order to restore the balance of their lives. And yes, there are no guarantees and uncertainties do occur in which the person may be placed in a high stress environment, but these risks need to be taken in order to reclaim a role in functional society. As much as we would like to, we can not logically shun away the world whenever we are hurt emotionally, or even physically, so we must learn to overcome these hindrances and move on with life, one way or another.",1112745600,3,9418,4.90282131661442

1517781,4,B00005JNC2,"Since we watched ""Leon - The Professional"", my wife and I have been dazzled by the performances of Natalie Portman, and continued picking up several movies just because she performed in them. When weighing whether or not to try this film, I knew that it was not the kind of story I liked, but decided to give it a chance anyway because Portman was starring. The overall result was not bad at all, since even though I did not feel strongly identified with the characters, I got to see an interesting story that is mostly driven by its well-written dialogues.

Andrew (Zach Braff) left his parents' house several years ago and traveled to the other side of the country to establish himself in Los Angeles and start an acting career. He was relatively successful at first, but things cooled down and now he is working as a waiter in a Vietnamese restaurant. He has been taking medication for his depression for a long time and lives a vacuous existence. Everything is about to change though, because his father, with whom he has not talked in a while, calls him to reveal that Andrew's mother died. Now he has to go back home to New Jersey and face the world he left behind, including his friends and family. In the process, he meets Sam (Portman) who has issues of her own; but the relationship that begins delivers a thoughtful view of what it feels like to be lost in life when one becomes an adult, and how sometimes we need to shake things up to start moving forward again.

Zach Braff undoubtedly meets expectations in his debut as a director and writer, with an engaging script and a well-filmed movie. His performance as Andrew is inspired and completely believable; but he is assisted in this aspect by the excellent Natalie Portman, who has an uncanny ability to portray extroverted girls that speak their mind. These two guys are complemented by an array of colorful characters that add spice to this film. The result is a production that is filled with funny situations and that has a considerable degree of emotions involved.

In a movie such as the classic Slacker, this is the point.  But in Garden State, I thought the idea was to show some brain waves.

There are some great visual sequences in the film and I give Braff credit for his cinomatic eye.  But, if I had to see one more scene with Natalie Portman doing that doe-eyed, grimace crying face, I was going to have to shut the TV off or launch it out the window.

1517839,4,B00005JNC2,"Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a semi-successful actor in Hollywood who returns home to the Garden State of New Jersey for his mother's funeral. ""Large"" hasn't been home in over nine years and there is a serious riff between him and his father. Over the course of four days Large attends several parties, meeting up with many of his old high school chums who are working at a variety of occupations: one is a grave digger, another works as a knight at a Medieval Times, another lives in a mansion after having invented noiseless velcro. While sitting in a doctor's waiting room, Large is introduced to Sam (Natalie Portman), a young girl with a very quirky, personal, and forceful personality. Over the next few days the two share in a series of casual adventures and fall in love, but not knowing how to express that love to each other.

GARDEN STATE is the directorial debut of Braff. Braff is best known for his starring role as J.D. in the television comi-drama, SCRUBS. Many people who are fans of SCRUBS don't like GARDEN STATE because the two are two completely different formats and Braff is actually a very talented actor & filmmaker and not just a lucky caricature who has a pretty face. The film is not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a great directorial debut.

The movie doesn't really have much plot and instead tends to rely upon style, technique, and meaning. The film has several shots that just in and of themselves are pure art; they are like moving snapshots in a virtual photography gallery. There are also several interesting filmmaking techniques incorporating throughout the picture that shake up the pace and keep things interesting. But the heart of the movie is the meaning behind it all. Large's life is like millions of people throughout the country--he has just been existing in a dream-like, drug-enhanced state since the time he was a child. Excluding the unhappy childhood, his whole life has been nothing but one moment of existence from another. All of that changes when he meets Sam. She causes him to look at things differently and tenders the desire within himself to begin living life, in all of its pain & suffering, joy & sorrow, adventure & mundane. When Large meets Sam, he stops just existing and begins truly living.

That idea is full of all kinds of implications and could be seen as a spiritual allegory. There aren't very many experienced filmmakers who can pull together art, technique, and substance in a way that makes sense and is worth watching. Hardly any freshman filmmakers can pull off such a task, but Braff has succeeded where many others have failed. Add in a mix of a beautiful soundtrack (Braff was also the soundtrack producer) and some high-quality acting from Braff, Portman, and Peter Sarsgaard (who plays Large's best friend, Mark) and it makes for one fairly impressive directorial debut.",1111536000,,2885,4.800804828973843
1517840,3,B00005JNC2,"Garden State is a heady combination of innocence, saccharine sweetness, indifference, and inexpertise that never quite jells into a finished product.  A few well-delivered monologues, some fabulous cinematography and a substantial performance by Natalie Portman fail to lift this film out of the rank and file.

The film opens to a shot of our protagonist's nightmare of a plan crash.  While all the people around him are crying, panicking, and otherwise coming to grips with their immanent death, our hero Andrew Largemen just sits there with a blank look on his face.  Nothing fazes him - not the screaming stewardess, the bags falling from the overhead bins, or the 60-year-old woman on his left clutching his shirt and crying in his ear.

Luckily, the phone rings, and Andrew wakes up to the sound of his father's voice.  Unluckily, it's bad news: his mother has drowned in the bathtub.  Thus Andrew, living in L.A. and estranged from his family for a decade, must return to his hometown in Jersey for the funeral.

After the funeral, Andrew runs into a couple of his old high school friends.  (It's just one of the film's many strange situations that these two particular friends now work as gravediggers and are waiting with a bulldozer to fill in his mother's grave.)  They overcome the situation's awkwardness and invite Andrew to a party later that night.  He's got nothing better to do, and so commences the strange round of reconnections with friends, family, acquaintances and strangers.

Andrew's medical history plays a pivotal role in the film.  His father, a psychiatrist, has been prescribing Andrew drugs for emotional problems for 16 years.  For some time now, Andrew has been getting sudden headaches, and while he's home he goes to a specialist to figure out what's wrong.  Of course, while he's away from his medicine cabinet in L.A., Andrew finds his headaches improve.  And he wonders whether or not the drugs are really helping...and why his father prescribed them in the first place.

While he's at the doctor's, Andrew meets a local girl, Sam.  They begin spending a lot of time together.  Played by Natalie Portman, Sam is both innocently delightful and annoying.  She's a self-admitted pathological liar, lives with her mother in a cloyingly pink house, and harbors her own medical history.  She usually accompanies her stories with gems of advice like ""You always have to laugh at yourself"" and ""Life is what it is.""  Amazingly enough, Ms. Portman manages to make these trite fancies into something more than just trite fancies - a tribute to the genuineness of the girl herself.

In general, the script is sometimes clunky and the plot stretches into bizarre flights of fancy.  A junkyard owner living at the bottom of a quarry turns out to embody wholesome family values.  Sam's adopted brother serves to show that hard work really CAN make your dreams come true.  And rather than adding anything to the movie, these tricks seem peripheral to both plot and character development.  It's as if we are take them like pills, swallowing them with the rest of the drugs in the big cocktail that is Garden State.

The movie is written and directed by its star, Zach Braff.  Perhaps this explains the oftentimes wooden quality Zach's character, Andrew, has onscreen.  Due to this impassiveness, Andrew seemed one-dimensional: a blank piece of paper that the other players write upon.  It's unfortunate that the movie turns upon Andrew's emotional development: so much of the film is spent without Andrew evidencing any emotion at all that when he actually does try to show some passion, it just feels fake.

Ultimately, Garden State is a mess of many different parts, none of which exactly line up into a finished product.  The writing is spotty and though the cinematography is amazing, the editing is quite awful (hey, if I can catch choppy edits in the middle of scenes, then the film editor needs a day job).  The performances of peripheral characters (Peter Sarsgaard as Mark, Ian Holm as Gideon) are quite good but can't quite cover for Zach's expressionless face.  And though Natalie is cute, the total lack of chemistry between her and Zach make their relationship a wash.  If you're into quirky movies about people in really strange and awkward situations, this might just float your boat.  Otherwise, I'd just  recommend another, better feel-good movie (say...Ameli?).",1111449600,2,4402,4.971272229822161

1517846,4,B00005JNC2,"I was genuinely surprised by Zach Braff's _Garden State_.  To be honest, I did not think I was going to like it and the first five minutes of the film seemed to confirm it.  I found his character dull and uninteresting.  But as the movie developed and the character's dullness was revealed to be an extension of his sedated state (both emotionally and physically), the film really took on a new shape.  Unlike many who have commented that the film is not a comedy, I certainly think it is.  I found myself laughing my ass off at a few lines in particular and thought the entire movie was delivered with a nice touch of humor.  Moreover, it is a comedy in the sense of the overall arch of the main character.  However, I suppose that if one's definition of a ""comedy"" is a film done in the style of a SNL production, then this film will probably not please.  This is not _Old School_--it is a bit of a dark comedy about reconnecting with the world again.

There are a few scenes in this film that are superbly well done, parts where the script connects with the audience and everything comes together.  Fortunately, there are enough of them to make up for any awkwardness in the pacing that results from any movie attempting to balance itself between humor and emotional intensity.  This film is certainly worth a rent and even purchasing if you can find it for a decent price.  With wonderful acting, a great oddball script and premise, and what is quickly becoming acknowledge a stellar soundtrack, _Garden State_ delivers exactly what it promised and much, much more.

There are only one or two good scenes in this movie: the one where we find out WHY the young man is so lost, and the scene where he stands up to his father.  Other than that, there is NO drama at all in this film.  It is a pageant of absurdity and sadness.  It is probably the most depressing comedy I've ever seen.  It angers me that there are people sad enough to like it.  It ""speaks"" to you?  Just how sad ARE you?  Feel better now you've seen someone in a movie who has REALLY suffered?  Good for you.

I give it two stars because the cinematography and acting is good.  But since the main character does virtually nothing throughout the film but let stuff happen to him, I must call this film terrible art.

The film is a cinematographic song for the alienated, lifeless, pointless, lonely Gen Y horde.  It ends with SOME sense of value (i.e. love), but this struck me as an afterthought which cannot save the film from its depressing, existential, meaningless (and consequently pretentious) core.",1110672000,3,1280,4.3872340425531915

it ended up being a really funny movie that was just a story about normal people doing...well, some strange things, but still about people who you can see yourself with everyday, because thats who you are with every day, normal people. it didn't have that big of a movie plot (like someone trying to find a magic idle or a killer on the loose) its just them doing things, with more subplots than big plots. the whole movie doesnt revolve around the guy coming home, meeting natalie, and trying to hook up with her. throughout the movie, it feels like their more friends then girlfriend/boyfriend.

I guess he's satisfied.  The film did well and it even got a couple of awards.  I just can't understand it.  This film was pretentious, stupid and boring.  And that's the nicest things I can say about it.

The plot revolves around a young man, living in Los Angeles, who comes home to New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral. He's been on mood dulling medications since he was 9 years old but he decides to give them up cold turkey before he gets on the plane.  He's an anti-hero type.

In fact, he is Andrew's psychiatrist, who prescribes pills that are suppose to make Andrew feel happy.  Blinded by his own vision of a ""happy family,"" Andrew's father is unable to control Andrew's ""happiness"" for a few days, as Andrew forgot his medication in LA.  This created an opening to Andrew's eyes and mind.  This small breach leaked out light to Andrew's gray character.

During his short-planned stay in NJ, Andrew learns that life is not all that bad.  All his feelings that were bottled up from his youthful past finally spilled out before him and to people he loved.  Although the movie seems to insert random events and scenes, one can quickly relate easily that many of life's events are nothing but random.

It is worthwhile to see how Sam and Andrew help each other out healing each other, and learning life's most important purpose--just to live it.

The beauty of this movie is that I can tell you that and I know that it will not ruin your movie-going experience. I can say that because I follow it with this: this movie will mean something different to everyone that sees it. I came through with my character defining laugh that annoyed every person in the theatre minus myself many many times throughout the movie, though the encompassing plot was not a comedy.

This is a compassionate tale of a dysfunctional family that through a series of tragic events may have found a way towards functionality. The movie more than anything to me meant hope. It was great to walk out of this and just feel good. Mind you, this was not a feeling of ""boy am I glad I was not forced by my parents to take Lithium for the majority of my life"" kind of good, this was the restoration of faith in humanity to make a story that had no explosions, no nudity, and plenty of fun.

1517885,5,B00005JNC2,"""You know that point in your life when you realize that the house that you grew up in isn't really your home anymore?"" Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff), along with millions of American twentysomethings, has reached that point. He has returned home to New Jersey for the first time in nine years for his mother's funeral, except all he's found is the house he used to live in; no home in sight.

In L.A., he is a Z-list actor, obscurely known to some as a mentally-challenged quarterback in a bad TV movie. Listless is an understatement of Andrew's sedated life. That is, until he meets a young lady named Sam (Natalie Portman), who at first seems his opposite, what with her outgoing nature and tendency to lie for no reason, but as we get to know them better, we find out that they want the same things.

Throughout the film, Andrew runs into people who may have been his friends years ago, but are now just people that he used to know. Most notably among these is Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), a grave digger with big plans, but no ambition to carry them out. In fact, it seems like a lot of Andrew's old acquaintances are exactly the same way - and he's not much better. Meanwhile, Andrew's father (Ian Holm) wonders what happened to the happy son he had, but Andrew wonders where his father got the idea that he was happy once.

First-time writer-director Zach Braff has crafted an excellent film that I think perfectly captures the feelings of restless youth. Nothing can be done fast enough for us. Can't wait to get out of the house. Can't wait to be rich and famous. We want to be Large Men. Except while we're doing all this rushing around, we cut ourselves off from the lives we could be living, and turn around nine years later and wonder what happened to the life we thought we'd have.

The performances, in my opinion, are brilliant, in that they are subtly nuanced. They take what in a lesser movie would be stereotypical characters and turn them into real live people that you might know. You may have even had some of the same conversations that they have. I think that in 20 years, we may look back on this film when we want to remember what we were thinking in 2004.

Braff has a bright future ahead of him if he continues to make films. He is able to shift between comedy and poignancy at the drop of a dime, and doesn't cheat to get the desired effect. That's not as easy as it sounds or as he makes it look.",1110153600,2,2418,4.388392857142857

The same can be said for Portman's character, she is sweet and fun but ultimately unbelievable.  Every one who watches this says I know a girl like that, but the point is that the girl in the movie is a overblown caricature of this girl.

Just because it is the kind of little story that is often done in many countries, but somehow this one is elevated because of its country of origin. I know this isn't Zach's fault, but there is a big wide world of low budget, humanistic movies around. (Mind you, any non-Hollywood American film is good by its difference.)

Apparently, there is intended to be a sense of place (the

'Garden State'), but this is pretty hard to feel. There are a lot of foreign films (which this is for me) that can convey that with breathtaking results.

That said, I thought a lot of the writing was good and how it was put together. ""Fresh"" as everyone says. Most of the performances were OK to good, but some are thin. Some cameos, like the mad phone number man in the shop are funnny. Soundtrack was good,too.

But the heart of the story is a bit thin...probably people do get locked into apathy and ennui by medication, but is true happiness just a matter of stopping? I think I am a bit down on tacked-on happy endings at the moment, too. All a bit too predictable, although with some twists.

See it, but keep it in context. It is a little like 'Lost in Translation', a European film made by an American (also with a tacked on happy ending). OK, but if it had been made by a European it would not have been out of the ordinary.",1109289600,,1482,4.370909090909091

If you're a youngster.. 20 something.. you'll understand this film. I saw myself and situations I'd been in throughout.. from the party scene where you don't know everybody at the the start.. to talking to people you haven't seen for years.. it's all captured perfectly.

Zach Braff does an excellent job as an actor and director.. and Natalie Portman is just amazing as Sam. She constantly made me smile.. and the 'original moment' scene was classic.

The love aspect of the film is done nicely.. it really is everyones dream as said to find your soulmate.. which is what I think happened with Sam & Andrew.. and unlike other films.. it was totally believable.

1517916,4,B00005JNC2,"This movie hangs on the understated performance of Zach Braff, who travels back to his small town home after his mother dies to deal with her death and his father, a psychiatrist who has kept Andrew (Braff) on lithium since he was 9 years old.

The emotionally numb Andrew is coming off of his medication for the first time since he was a boy, and he meets Natalie Portman, a quirky girl who seems to love him. The film basically tracks Andrew as he spends time with high school friends and tries to come to grips with his mother's death.

This sounds like a depressing movie, but it's really not. The emphasis is on the eccentricities, and unexplored corners, of small town life.  Something about this set of offbeat small-town characters is more realistic than the traditional Hollywood paean to the wackiness of rural life. Everyone has problems, and there's nothing cute or empowering about a grave-digging buddy who makes a habit of making off with the jewelry of the corpses he buries.

The dialogue is particularly well done, with lots of unfinished thoughts, interrupted conversations, ""likes"" and ""you knows"" combining to make the interactions seem very real.

For all the serious subject matter, this is actually an uplifting movie, with plenty of very funny comedic scenes that make and happy spots to make us feel good. One scene in particular, featuring a Medieval Times Knight who romances his friend's mother in Klingon, is very funny.

This is the kind of movie that abounds in independent film, but which has combined art and realism with the commercial value and production value that make it viable for a major studio to get behind it. I highly recommend it.",1109030400,2,1677,4.825783972125436

This may sound harsh, but there was very little about this movie I actually enjoyed. It becomes obvious more effort was put into the movie's soundtrack then the actual elements of the movie, in particular it's painfully lacking narrative. In the end, mediocre acting (Which I can only assume is the work of director Zach Braff as his movie had talented actors but it didn't show), unimpressive cinematography, excessive teenage angst, and nauseating self-indulgence make this in my mind one of the worst movies of 2004.",1108944000,34,677,4.886956521739131

1517969,1,B00005JNC2,"Garden State

The title is, of course, ironic. The central character is a bit actor living in California (his big claim to fame is having played a ""retarded football player"", so lets just call him ""retardoactor""), who earns his living as a fake Vietnamese waiter in an oriental restaurant. He hears a message from his father via his answering machine, who obviously cannot get his son to even talk to him, that his mother has died. The most amazing thing in the whole movie is that he actually goes home to New Jersey for the burial - why bother, he's had no or essentially no contact with his family for ten years? At the burial, he meets up with a couple of old school chums, the backhoe operators burying bodies at the cemetary. His ""best friend"" is a pot and meth or crack smoking fellow who we find out earns money for his drugs from shoplifting and stealing the jewelry from the corpses of the people he buries. We could call him ""graverobber"", but I prefer ""methead"". He roundly castigates retardoactor for not bringing home all the drugs he had obtained in California. We meet a couple more of his friends. The one person in his circle of buddies who apparently had some brains is a nerd who developed a revolutionary fabric closure substance, ""silent velcro"". He is paid off handsomely to keep the stuff from coming to market, and now lives in an empty mansion. Lets call him tycoonboy. His life has dissolved into a boring fog of drunken drug/rape/sex orgies, fed by underage cokewhores  who threaten blackmail with less passion and reluctance than I show ordering an ice cream cone. His is the success story in the movie. After retardoactor goes to tycoonboy's house for an orgy, where he smokes dope and drops (apparently) acid, he comes down from his trip at  methead's house-in every way quite representative of a speed freak's domicile-torn curtains, mismatched broken furniture and dirty squalor. Retardoactor meets up with a pathological liar, with at least one other mental disorder, while being dry humped by a lady's seeing eye dog in a doctor's office where they are both being treated. During his catscan, he finds out that methead's mother has covered his body with obscenities in waterproof ink, including comments about the size of his penis. Apparently, she had a good time with him, too, although he was too stoned to know it. After their respective exams, retardoactor and patholiar find they are attracted to each other,so they begin a relationship immediately. Patholiar's most salient advice to him in the entire movie is to kick male animals in the balls, repeated several times. We meet more of his old buddies, and the real losers are the ones who are maintaining steady jobs. The one who is advancing at a chain restaurant, the one who is working as a clerk ""for awhile"" and the nerdboy at a thinly disguised Home Depot clone where methead is shoplifting-nerdboy might as well be wearing a big rubber nose and plastic glasses. At patholiar's home (she actually seems to have a fairly nice, if fruity, mother) they talk to each other about their lives. She still has a Christmas tree up, and she accuses him of being Jewish, but he assures her that he isn't really Jewish and doesn't even KNOW any Jews who go to a Temple (the type of congregation in the most liberal branch of Judaism) more than one day a year. We find out that retardoactor was sent away to boarding school because his parents felt he was a threat to their well being after he crippled his mother for life (paraplegia) by attacking her because she was insufficiently pleasant for his tastes. He has a confrontation with his father, where his father advises him to forgive himself (anyway-his father obviously has), and that all he had ever wanted was for them all to be happy. Retardactor advises him that he was NEVER happy, and that he would (graciously} forgive his father for trying to make him happy. Retardoactor and methead and patholiar all go on a quest to a fencing operation (the fence and his family was by far the most sympathetic and normal family group in the movie) where methead obtains the locket he had stolen off of the dead body of retardoactor's mother. Retardoactor decides that he has to go figure everything out in California, or some such thing, and patholiar accompanies him to the airport, where they say their tearful farewells. The denoument is when he gets off the plane and returns to her. He's decided that there is nothing to reach for, and that he is going nowhere, in an ending of emptiness which makes the bus ride in ""The Graduate"" look like a romantic, committed, heroic quest.

1517970,5,B00005JNC2,"Ok...how to sum up the plot of this movie? Well, in a way it reminded me of one of my other favorite movies also featuring Natalie Portman-  Beautiful Girls (if you haven't seen it- go rent it now!). The major similarity was that this guy has come home, back to his parents house & town he grew up in- after being away for a very long time. And naturally, he has a strained relationship with his parents, or in both cases, their fathers. So here's this guy who's so out of place, back to where he once belonged; running into friends, trying to cope with his family; trying to sort his whole life out.

Of course, this is a great story. I mean, it's so human. Being 25 and trying to figure out your life and where you're headed, trying to deal with your past. It's the past in this movie that really keeps it flowing- and how the character deals with it. That, and his chance meeting with Natalie's character and their subsequent dates. Both Zach and Natalie are naturals for these rolls and I think- really give Oscar worthy performances. I don't know how else to describe it- other than they were so real.

I whole-heartedly recommend this movie. I think Zack deserves to at least be nominated for an Oscar for such a well-written, thought-out, well put together, funny, sad and interesting movie. The music was also chosen perfectly to fit and the cinematography gave the film a very artsy feel. While it's not overly-dramatic or action filled, I think most movie-goers will enjoy the movie & it's story. Because it's a story with a lot of heart.",1108684800,2,1548,4.501779359430605

1517972,5,B00005JNC2,"I rented this because I had heard so many good things about it and after watching it a couple times, it certainly did not disappoint.  Zach Braff has done something remarkable for a debut film project, and its an achievement he should be very proud of.  This film works on several levels, but mostly, its a relevant film for the younger generation that is too often assigned to take drugs to solve whatever problems their parents don't want to deal with.  The numbing of the emotional pains of life doesn't lead to a life fully lived, and in a sense, we are turning our children into emotional zombies.  This film is a wake up call...get off the drugs and experience life the way its meant to be experienced.  Emotional pain is a burden everyone has to work through and deal with, and finally accept before moving on.

The great thing about this independent film, as in many independent films, is that it doesn't follow the standard Hollywood formula.  You are taken in with the character and experience his life over the course of four days, as Andrew (Zach Braff) returns home to attend his mother's funeral after a nine year absence.  At home, he avoids his father and hooks up with friends who seem to all be stuck in dead-end jobs (some, quite literally).  Andrew is the only one trying to make something of his life, as a struggling actor in Hollywood who's claim to fame was playing a mentally handicapped football player on a TV show.  He meets the lovely and quirky Natalie Portman at the doctor's office.  Some people have doubted her abilities as an actress after seeing her in the ""Star Wars"" prequels, but make no mistake...see this film and ""Closer"" and you will be captivated by her range.  I loved her performances in both films, but she especially has unique charm in ""Garden State""...helping Andrew come to terms with his long-delayed grief over an incident that happened when he was much younger, guilt that he put aside for years.

There are many quirky characters in this film and a couple of them seem caught up in some pyramid schemes.  My favorite small performance is by Method Man, who almost steals the film by his very brief, but hilarious scene.  Perhaps the only person who seems out of place in a film like this is Ian Holme, whom I can't view in any film without thinking Bilbo Baggins!  He often appears like a ghost in this film by his wardrobe choices, and his role is small (his most significant scene is cut and on the deleted scenes special feature) and he just doesn't resemble Zach enough to convince me that he's his father in the film.  It was a minor distraction and what I think is a serious miscast of that role, but not enough for me to subtract a star from the rating.  That's because the overall message of the film is simply powerful and one we should all take to heart.  We should live a life that's uniquely ours and seek moments where we attempt to do things no one else might have ever done before.  To live is to risk, and we can't truly live if we are drugging away our personal pains (whether through doctor-prescribed zoloft/ritalin, or through ecstasy and other illegal means of artificial happiness).  We control our own happiness and we can't be responsible for making other people happy.  That's the garden state of our own desires.  See this film again and again.  Its simply amazing and Zach Braff deserves huge kudos for making this film.",1108598400,2,3402,4.585123966942149
1517973,5,B00005JNC2,"But it does to speak to many 20 something year olds.  Of course, as with anything that has people's opinions, not everyone will like it.

I've read many reviews of the film, that were clearly written by older folks who were looking for something other than what the film is about.  Some complain that the story between Andrew and his father only plays a minor role- this makes me think, did they miss the whole point of this movie? It's not about father-son relationships, it's not even about a love interest.  The film, IMO, is about the feeling of being lost and having no direction, looking for a way to find home.

The protagonist is Andrew Largeman, a overly medicated 20 something year old, who lives a life of aimlessly going from day to day.  You know, kind of like when your days just start blurring between each other, because it's the same old routine.  Many of us have felt that, especially after we are done with college and try to find a job we'll like.  We usually start on jobs that are so mindlessly boring, that we just go through the motions day, after day.

Andrew's life is about to change though, as he gets news of the death of his mother, prompting his return to New Jersey.  He returns home and has awkward interactions with his family, especially his father.  This made sense to me, since my relationship with my own father is awkward, so much so that I really can't talk to him except to say hello and a few small words of small talk; imagine how weird it felt for Largeman, who harbors a reasonable hate for his father, which will be further explained as the movie goes on.

Many will dimiss the rest of the movie as a aimless jump from one scene to another, but then, they are also missing the point.  It serves to remember, for those of you who've gone away to college to come back 4 years later.........how weird it felt, and how out of place one feels as one tries to reconnect with old friends; how we wander around, going from one friend's house to the next.

The love story itself is not so much real, but more of a wish.  Every 20 something has the dream of meeting that special someone; she's interesting, she's funny, she's beautiful, and she makes the first move by talking to us.  Yes, it's our fantasy that gets played out in this film, and many older folks will fail to see it, and just think of it as a cop-out when it gets to fruition in the end.

In the end, I don't think many people over the age of 30 will ultimately enjoy this film as much as someone younger, mostly because they most likely already have their lives together.  For many 20 somethings, we are still looking for our own family and home, as the moving quote from the movies goes ""maybe family is just a bunch of people who miss the same imaginary place.""

It helps to think back to the feeling you get, after you finish college and come ""home.""  Something doesn't feel right, you can't really place your finger on it, but even though you still love your parents, their home is no longer your home.  Your parent's home is not what you imagine your home is anymore, but rather, you beging to imagine a home of your own, with another person who imagines the same home you do.",1108598400,3,3185,4.364406779661017

1517975,4,B00005JNC2,"Star-director-writer Zach Baff's ""Garden State"" is a consistently engaging film although not a perfect one.  I thought when the film started off it was a little too quirky for it's own good.  It had kind of a sitcom feel to it which I found a little inappropriate for a film about a young man returning home for his mother's funeral.  The film got it's legs when Natalie Portman's character enters the fray as the epileptic love interest to Braff's psychologically damaged actor.  The chemistry between these two is palpable and unforced.  The film's main strength is when it focuses on their relationship.  Peter Sarsgaard gives an excellent performance as Braff's gravedigger buddy.  In smaller roles some older actors shine:  Ian Holm as Braff's father, Ron Liebman as a doctor, and Jean Smart as Sarsgaard's mother.  By no means a classic but I can envision this film developing a devoted cult following.",1108512000,2,908,4.960264900662252
1517976,3,B00005JNC2,"I watched Garden State yesterday after hearing great things about it from my brother.  It's a character-driven movie (the kind I typically like), more about everyone's quirks and interactions than about any actual events.  And while Braff succeeds in many ways, the movie also bears a few flaws that keep it from being great.

For the most part, Garden State is very well-acted.  Ian Holm (as the main character's father) and Peter Sarsgaard (as an old friend from high school, Mark) fare particularly well, creating vivid people out of a relatively small number of lines.  Holm is of course a veteran of considerable stature in the craft, fresh from his turn as Bilbo in the Lord of the Rings.  He brings not only a frightening countenance to the role of Gideon Largeman, but the kind of expertise that only comes with decades of acting experience.  Sarsgaard is another excellent actor, whom I had already seen in Center of the World.  Here he exceeds all reasonable expectations as a stoner with some questionable habits and less than perfect social skills.  Whether he plays a leading role or a supporting one, Sarsgaard is always a pleasure to watch.

Natalie Portman does a good job with a poorly conceived character in Garden State.  As Andrew's unlikely girlfriend Sam, she is a compulsive, giddy liar, more annoying than appealing.  Everything about Sam says ""run far, far away,"" and yet Andrew Largeman feels drawn to her.  I suppose this is only possible with a protagonist who has been on one medication or another for fifteen-plus years.  And yet, even if that makes their match a credible one, it doesn't necessarily make them a couple who are enjoyable to watch.

Furthermore, much of the movie is spent focusing on Andrew Largeman feeling nothing when he should feel something.  It's tough to sympathize with this kind of person, and the viewer consequently feels almost as detached from him as he feels from the rest of the world.  By the time he finally does start to exhibit emotion, you have to wonder: why did it have to take this long?

Garden State also suffers from what can only be called too many coincidences.  We're talking about New Jersey, people, not a prairie town in South Dakota.  Not everyone has to know everyone else.  And yet Andrew can't go anywhere or do anything without running into someone he knew in high school.

For all its flaws, Garden State does boast some memorable dialogue and the soundtrack is very nice on the ears.  Although I won't be buying a copy of the movie, I will be picking up the music which scored it so perfectly.

It's nice to see Braff put together a competent movie, as writer, director, and leading actor.  He's no Orson Welles, but we don't see many auteurs these days.  Garden State will resonate best with emotionally stranded twenty-somethings and intelligent teenagers who are ready for something with more depth than the next sequel to The Fast and the Furious.",1108512000,,2937,4.789264413518887

1518016,2,B00005JNC2,"I am a trailer junkie, I admit it.  When I saw the teaser ad for ""Garden State,"" I fell in love with it.  I downloaded it and watched it literally hundreds of times without ever having seen the movie.  I'm talking about the one that's just images from the film, no dialogue, with that Frou Frou song playing over them.  It moved me to tears, to words beyond speaking.  I simply adored it.

But I never had a chance to see the movie in theaters, so when it came out on DVD, I just bought it.  For one thing, I figured that the trailer would be on the DVD, so even if I wound up disliking it, at least I'd have the trailer.  But I wasn't worried.  After all, with a trailer like THAT, how could this film *possibly* be anything but magnificent?

Like this:

1) *THE TRAILER ISN'T ON THE BLOODY DISC!*  It isn't included with the extras at all!  Not even the regular trailer, much less the one I fell in love with.  This KILLS me.  It's truly devastating.  What in the world were they thinking in excluding it??

2) *My big, fat, cliche-filled movie.*  So here's the ""beauty"" of this movie's breakdown: Boy is sad.  Boy meets Girl.  Girl makes Boy happy.  Boy falls in love with Girl and everyone lives kookily ever after.  The End.  This is an overused, entirely tired formula for any movie, but it can work if it's done in a new and interesting way.  (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" for instance, is an excellent example of how this formula can be twisted around and made almost unrecognizably new.)  ""Garden State"" simply fails to make this a new journey for its audience (or at least for me).  I did NOT believe that in four days Natalie Portman's character could have changed him that completely.  I do not believe that she did anything remotely special besides be kute and krazy with a kapital ""K"" for the entire movie that would have endeared anyone to her.  But she's Natalie Portman, so everyone buys it.  Everyone, apparantly, but me.  Aside from that, the cliches made the plot completely predictable.  Anyone who couldn't see from the beginning of that airport sequence that he wasn't going to get onto that plane was probably just in the bathroom when it started.  After all, who WOULD get on a plane to Los Angeles when they can stay in New Jersey and build a relationship with someone they met four days ago?  That makes PERFECT sense.

3) *Underdeveloped characters.*  Someone needs to inform M. Braff that a laundry list of ""quirks"" doesn't make someone a character, it just makes them a random person with quirks.  Portman played an epileptic girl who ice skates in alligator suits and buries hamsters and makes weird faces at weird moments.  Peter Sarsgaard was a pot-smoking grave-digger who stole things from dead bodies and hung out with odd people.  Few explanations are offered for any of these behaviors; they are just presented to the audience and people are expected to respond.  I resepct the choice to leave some things open and let the audience make up its own mind about certain aspects of character, but what I cannot accept is caricatures as opposed to well-developed characters.  I think Braff gets away with this primarily because of the actors he has chosen for these roles.  Portman and especially Sarsgaard are both such amazing talents that it's almost impossible to see how little they've really been given to work with in the way of character development from the script.  Maybe I've just spent too many hours analyzing movies as a film major, but I did see it, and I would like to register my disappointment formally.

Braff's character was also really unbelievable to me.  If he was so drugged up and zoned out for so many years that he couldn't even bring himself to express normal emotions, then why in the world would he have the desire to become an ACTOR?  Additionally, I thought Ian Holm was wasted in the role of the father.  If you have Ian Holm in your movie, then dammit, you freakin' USE Ian Holm in your movie.  There are some deleted scenes with him that give us a bit more insight into his completely one-dimensional character, but even if they HAD been included, it wouldn't have been enough to overcome this fundamental problem.

The one positive thing I CAN say about this DVD presentation is that at least Braff didn't waste his commentary tracks.  He has two, which seems to be a bit excessive, but he manages to avoid repetition for the most part.  He doesn't offer any insights into the failings of his script, but I didn't expect that anyway.  :-)

I gave it two stars because in spite of the fact that I didn't really like this movie, I have to admit that it isn't TERRIBLE.  If I had paid $8 to see it in theaters, I would have felt just fine about it, and I wouldn't have felt my money was wasted.  But I never would have bought it on DVD.  Since I did shell out $20 for the DVD and don't plan to watch it over and over again to get my money's worth, I DO feel that my money was wasted, but I guess I can live with that.  Braff obviously has a lot of talent, and I look forward to seeing what else he can come up with.  Maybe his next script won't have the same ""I wrote this as my film school thesis"" gleam to it and will be a bit more mature, and a hell of a lot more believable.",1107907200,15,5255,4.438284518828452
1518046,4,B00005JNC2,"I feel that Garden State is more of an artsy and emotional film than anything else.  While the plot was a little weak, the theme stuck with me, which is to live life to the fullest.

Zach Braff plays Andrew Largeman, a struggling actor who has basically been doped up on medications his whole life (mostly because of his psychiatrist father).  He decides not to take them with him when he goes back to New Jersey for his mother's funeral.  While in New Jersey, he meets up with some old friends and also befriends the free-spirited Sam, played brilliantly by Natalie Portman.  She helps him in his quest to find himself and ""break free"" of the medications that have been holding him back his whole life.

I didn't really understand the purpose of some of the scenes in the movie (for example, the party at the beginning of the movie), but otherwise, I enjoyed the movie.",1107907200,2,870,4.544871794871795

1518048,2,B00005JNC2,"I hate people with iPods.  Really, I do.  And it's not just because I don't have one, though that's a big part of it.  No, what I hate is that lots of people have them just to have them.  Oh, I see them walking down the street with their little white headphones, nodding at each other like they belong to some secret society.  Oh, they may say they're listening to the Shins, but it wouldn't surprise me if they actually didn't know how to work the thing and were just listening to nothing at all.

What does any of this have to do with Garden State?  Garden State strikes me as one of those flicks people say they like without actually liking it.  Give Zach Braff credit.  With Garden State, he accomplishes a lot.  He writes, directs, and stars in his own first feature.  He gets to make out with Natalie Portman (though after hearing her character talk, you may not think this is such a good thing).  And he gets to show people what great musical taste he has.  The Shins?  Check.  Zero 7?  Uh-huh.

The problem?  There's no real movie here.  There are lots of musical interludes that don't advance the story.  There's lots of quirky anecdotes.  But there's no story holding everything together.  Some of the pieces are there, but Garden State takes so many detours it doesn't end up going anywhere.

And frankly, despite all that, I probably still would have liked the flick if Portman's character never appeared on screen.  In what's easily the most awkward comic performance since Heather Graham ruined the second Austin Powers flick, Portman intrudes on the film like the girl in college who lived across the hall and never, ever, shut up.

It struck me watching Garden State that Portman is this generation's equivalent of Winona Ryder.  I knew someone who worked with Ryder, who said everyone was so transfixed by her beauty that they didn't realize her performance was terrible until it was too late.  And so it is with Portman, who can't pull off the sort of character that Kate Winslet made indelible in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  In a quiet film, her Sam is the grating character that everyone in the movie likes but no one in the audience does.

But I've complained too much.  Some people are programmed to like movies like Garden State, because they don't want their barista to be angry with them.  And that's all right.  But one day, Zach Braff (who is clearly talented) will realize the importance of what his movie is as opposed to what's in it.  And that's the movie I'm waiting to see.",1107820800,24,2518,4.56152125279642
1518049,5,B00005JNC2,"Not only has Garden State topped my fave films of 04, it also eased it's way into my number 9 spot, of my favorite films of all time.

Garden State is the directorial debut of TV's ""Scrubs"" actor Zach Braff, and also stars him as the leading role. Braff plays Andrew Largeman, a twenty-something detached numbed-out wannabe actor living in Los Angeles, who is doused up to the eyballs on medication. After recieving a call from his almost-non-existant father, telling him his mother passed away, Andrew flys back to his hometown of Newark, New Jersey for his mother's funeral.

Andrew stays in Newark for a few days, catching up with his frinds, among them is the hilarious Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), and his white trash cougar of a mother (Jean Smart), and a few more. But above all, during a chance encounter, Andrew befriends a quirky cute girl named Sam, brilliantly portrayed by Natalie Portman, in a performance that should have got an Oscar nod. Sam brings out a part of Andrew, that he though never existed in him.

This is a heartwarming, tragic, sad, hilarious, and everything-in-between tale. A great film for whatever STATE your in.",1107734400,,1141,4.811224489795919
1518050,4,B00005JNC2,"Garden State is a prototypical ""independent film,"" and I mean that in a good way.  It has all the ear-marks of an independent film: quirky, funny, odd, off-beat, edgy, innovative.  Writer/director/star Zach Braff is best known as an actor on the wonderful NBC sitcom, Scrubs.  (He brings the same comedic sensibility to this film.)  However, he is an honest-to-goodness filmmaker - he went to film school and everything.  Like Kevin Smith before him, Braff has made a feature film homage to his native state of New Jersey - those of you who don't live here simply wouldn't understand.  He plays an actor/waiter in LA who has to return home for his mother's funeral.  Once there, he goes off his antidepressants and meets Natalie Portman, who gives the best performance of a Jersey Girl I've ever seen.  The movie meanders a bit and is probably better viewed at home, but still it is an impressive debut.  I hope to see more good things from Braff in the future.",1107388800,2,961,4.706586826347305

There really wasn't too many bad things to be said about this movie except for the fact that it was completely unmemorable and its storyline didn't seem to fit into the 102 minutes duration time of the film. After about 80 minutes I kept looking at the digital minute counter on my DVD player. So I guess what I'm trying to say was that it really dragged on.

I'll give the movie some credit as far as interesting characters and catchy dialogue go. And there were some pretty funny parts throughout the picture. But this is just the kind of film I watch, enjoy it to an extent, and completely forget about it the next week.",1107302400,6,818,4.453333333333333

Mike Nichols and (apparently) Zach Braff know how to get the best out of her, 'cause here, as in ""Closer,"" she's luminous.  (Are you paying attention George Lucas?)  As for the rest of the film, this is one more ""Graduate"" wannabe, far too whimsical for my taste (i.e. forced humor), thinking it's saying something about disaffected youth and family relationships, but really isn't.  The Braff character is a complete cipher, one whose last-minute change of heart is too little too late.

1518053,3,B00005JNC2,"I like Zach Braff; I think he's a funny actor. His show ""Scrubs"" is one of my favorite sitcoms on television right now. When I heard of this movie I was excited to see Zach directing in a film in which he plays a serious part.

After watching this film, I must say I didn't feel the way I was expecting to feel. I wasn't disappointed nor was I satisfied. From all the hype that surrounded this film, I guess I expected something a little more.

Zach Braff is likeable in this film. Although I didn't feel a connection with his character, I did feel sympathy for him. Zach plays the character very well. He proves that he can play a comedic role as well as a dramatic one. Natalie Portman's character, I found to be very annoying at first. Her hyper over-the-top character takes a while to tolerate, but never fully becomes likeable. And it's nowhere as good as Kate Winslet's wacky character in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"".

I felt disapointed about several things about this movie. One huge thing that disappointed me was the fact that this film lack any emotional scenes. While watching the movie, I patiently waited for a scene where the characters show some heavy emotion, but every time one was about to happen, I felt that director Zach pulled back by adding some quirky humor. One scene in particular was one towards the end where Zach's character finally cries for the first time, but the scene just fails after Portman's character ruins the moment by acting quirky.

I also felt that the relationship between Zach's character and his father wasn't explored enough. I would have liked more scenes with them together where the sort out their differences.

The ""adventure"" the characters go on, if you can call it an adventure, felt kind of forced. The ending of the film also seemed a bit forced and cliched.

However, despite these setbacks, the film has strong moments. One of them is the opening dream sequence of a plane going down with Zach's character in it. I thought this scene would foreshadow something that perhaps would have happened in the end (which probably would have been better), but the scene is just there to show a disturbing dream. I like the party scenes and the scene at the pool. One of my favorite scene is one at Portman's backyard pet cemetery. This scene was probably the strongest scene emotionally.

The soundtrack is good and the imagery and sets are good to look at. I would recommend this film to someone who wants to see it so they can make their own judgement.

I do give credit to Zach Braff for making a decent directorial debut and for giving a superb performance. I look forward to seeing his future work and hope his next film will be much better.",1107129600,10,2707,4.590062111801243

This review isn't dedicated towards those who like or would like this film. This review is dedicated to those  like me and serves only as a warning. So with that, something to think about:

What's remotely funny about a bunch of self indulgent, self centered, unintelligent, foul mouthed, screwed up young folks engage in very rude, dangerous behavior?
What's funny in seeing young kids dope up and swap partners? What's funny about watching a dog for the blind allowed to rape the leg of a patient while in a doctors office waiting room? What's funny about watching a group of people engage in illegal voyeurism (peeping): the incident where the Bellboy wants his buddies to shut-up so that he can fully pay attention to a man c-m (his words)? This is an utterly disgusting film, depicting the very base of human existence...not a romantic comedy!! There wasn't a single, normal, well-adjusted character in this movie. Many people will not be able to identify with these characters. God forbid that they should!

1518105,5,B00005JNC2,"I think that everyone should see the movie Garden State. It was a very moving movie for me and most people that I know that have seen it. It hits a college kid on a very personal level by addressing the fears and complications that we have experienced or are experiencing. It opens your eyes to the simplicity of life and the things that matter. It takes you through a journey of one guy that has been battling with his life and his unhappiness for most of his adult life until he finds a very querky, awkward girl.

I think that everyone should at least experience this movie because it is a very off the wall, touching movie. It is excellently made and brings about all kinds of feelings that you never addressed before. It captures the feeling of going away and starting your own life at college or after college and coming home to hang out with the same people you did in high school. It completely captures the awkward return and the collaboration of everyone's feelings of not knowing how to relate as well as they used to.

Garden State is a movie that will open your eyes to the world we are all living in. It makes you feel very good after watching it and opens up the door to certain feelings that you didn't know how to address. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I think that any one who has ever gone away from home and came back later with a new life and new experiences will find that this movie really touches that part in your heart.

If you never see another movie in your life, at least make time to see this one. It's not like anything I've seen before in the way that it touched my emotions and made me look at the world differently. I feel that if you are ages 18-22 this movie will completely effect the way you feel about your life and what you really want out of it. If you are older than that, this movie will bring you back to a time, any time, in your life that you felt unhappy or like you were missing something. It will take you through the feelings you felt and then bring you to a point where you remember what it was like to finally figure it out.

1518106,5,B00005JNC2,"Much like homemade pharmaceuticals, Garden State at first would appear to have all the ingredients for a potential disaster. A twenty-something star of a slightly better than average sitcom with big ideas aspires to create a new generation ""Graduate,"" a wake-up call to all of us wallowing in ennui, ironic detachment, or just plain self absorbed malaise. Honestly, would the idea of Jared Leto or Mark Paul Gosslenger adapting ""Catcher in the Rye"" for the silver screen have intrigued anyone? But, alas, Garden State just may be the best film you'll see all year. Writer/Director Zach Braff gives a fantastic performance as an anti-depressant guzzling would-be actor who returns home for a few days to reunite with his friends and distant father following his mothers sudden death and Natalie Portman is heartbreakingly charming as his eccentric love interest. Both tender and hilarious in turns, Garden State is a compellingly warm and intelligent story that may leave you thinking differently about life. It truly is a shame that Oscar talk never really gathered around Garden State (Portman and the screenplay both seem especially worthy of nominations,) leaving it likely to slip through the cracks and become a cult classic, sitting on the shelves next to Harold and Maude and Ghost World.

After my sister bought it, I began watching it constantly, finding new levels of depth within the layers that Zach Braff created. I have had epiphanies about my life, about how i should live it and change it for the better. Never before has a movie given me such insight into life. Zach Braff's work on the movie is truly astonishing. His humor, while subtle, compliments the movie and uses sarcasm as a tool to develop his character Andrew Largemen.

Artistic without being anticlimatic, genuinely funny without being fake, charmingly quirky without being too weird...  Indeed, the whole thing has a ""genuine"" feel that lets you see the tragic and uplifting parts as equally touching.

The deleted scenes were nice to see... IMO, the one they really should have kept in the movie was the extended scene in the bathtub... It brought even more depth to Andrew's character.  I haven't seen all the extras on the DVD, but look forward to viewing the commentaries.

I don't have a problem with that label. What's admirable about the film is its setting, these are real characters with awkward lives. Braff's grave-digging friend is funny and scary. Portman who is usually comatose (not counting Leon: The Professional) actually wiggles her toes in this role.

The problem is that with so many wonderful visuals, camerwork, and really shining points the film has no plot, story, and the character growth is artificial. This is a flawed script. The most glaring flaw is the forced ending, the second most glaring flaw is the role of the father played by Ian Holm. This is simply a waste of talent. Holm's character is scenery and color. Nothing more. He stares flatly perhaps waiting to be directed. Maybe he was not motivated, or perhaps it was as I am more inclined to believe, a lack of a role to work with. It is nice that Holm gave this young director a chance, that shows that Holm is an artist willing to take risks. What isn't nice is the result.

I found it hard to not like Garden State - especially once Natalie Portman showed up in it. She's VERY likeable in her role. (And I'm not just saying that because she's hot.) Her and Braff have great chemistry together.

Garden State's non-existing plot and direction by Zach Braff allows us to follow a guy we hardly know anything about as he re-connects with his high school friends and an eccentric girl he met at a clinic, who he winds up falling in love with. The film attempts to stand on it's own feet with the cast's performances and the script's dialogue alone, but ultimately, it falls over. The ending of the film is completely cliched. The fact that high school kids think it's so ""deep"" baffles me. It's as if they're attempting to read between lines that aren't there.

The dialogue is flat, unintelligent, & not particularly believable. The limp attempts at comedy & melodrama are obvious, irritating, and just plain bland. How unintelligent & insensitive a writer do you have to be to come up with supposedly-funny lines such as, ""Are you really retarded? Because that Corky actor is really retarded in real life, and you're a better actor than him"" - oh brother. What's more criminal, the insensitivity, or the sheer blandness of it. As such, the characters are far too self-absorbed and well, dumb, to be likeable. Nothing to relate to here.

If a film is meant to both entertain and lend insight, ""Garden State"" fails on both fronts. Instead, it comes off as the director/lead actor's sloppy attempt to be taken seriously as a filmmaker. Because it's ""cool"" to be a director, I guess. How a script this bad ends up getting the greenlight is a mystery to me.

Definitely not the quirky, ""indie"" film it tries to be. If  spending two hours watching some guy give annoyed, half-bored facial expressions at every random, 'odd' thing he encounters sounds appealing to you, then this is your film.

Me, I'd rather watch ice melt. A few critics might've gushed over it, but all I saw was a weak, tedious, pretentious, flat, poorly written, uninspired film.",1106611200,12,1444,4.82995951417004

The opening scene sets up the story. A man who is heavily medicated finds out that his mother just died. He flies back to New Jersey to attend the funeral. He meets some old friends and makes some new ones. The dialog is good. The friends and strangers are interesting. The movie even takes the viewer to interesting spots in Newark, New Jersey. The movie drives home the point that life is not all happiness, but that's okay. Without experiencing pain, life would be numb and worthless. Real life is in experiencing the pain and the joy.

The movie is like a winding path through some valleys and hills. It has some nice surprises, touching moments, and small laughs. This is a very impressive directorial debut for Zach Braff.",1106524800,,894,4.694267515923567
1518163,5,B00005JNC2,"I saw Garden State in the theater when it was first released but wanted to see it again before writing my review.  I finally viewed it on DVD recently and I have to admit, I was concerned my opinion of it would change after viewing it a second time.  I was fearful it was one of those movies that, upon multiple viewings, would turn out to be not nearly as clever as I originally thought.  (This seems to happen often to me with movies.)

I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed the film perhaps even more than I did the first time.  I recall a friend of mine going to the New York premiere before it was widely released - she was excited because Zach Braff was going to be there.  When I spoke to her afterwards, she said she enjoyed it but that she could see that it was Braff's first effort behind the camera.  I have to disagree with that assessment.

Garden State was definitely the best movie I saw in 2004.  Now, I'll admit, I didn't see a whole lot of movies in'04, but Garden State would probably beat out most other ones I could have seen.

Zach Braff stars as Andrew Largeman, a guy from New Jersey who is spending his days out in L.A. living the life of a struggling actor - that is, waiting tables and getting bit parts.  He does apparently land the role of a retarded quarterback though, which is brought up several times.  However, this recurring joke seems realistic, coming up about as frequently as you would expect it to.

Andrew comes home to NJ for the first time since leaving for boarding school when he was 16 - he's home because his mom has died.  Along the way, he runs into his old friends from high school, with all of the meetings reminding me a lot of running into old friends in Jersey (probably the same as a lot of areas of the country, but since I'm from Jersey, I felt connected).  He also meets Sam, played absolutely brilliantly by Natalie Portman.  Portman evidently shocked Braff by wanting to be in the film and I have to say, if this is how she acts in every film she's in, then she'll be winning Oscars very soon.  The character Sam is very vulnerable, yet strong-willed and sarcastic at the same time.  We see nothing of her father, which may explain part of her guarded nature - at the same time, it also explains her emotions, which are expressed at various times in the film.

Andrew's father is also brilliantly played by Ian Holm.  He has also served as Andrew's psychiatrist for years, loading him up on more drugs than one would believe possible.  Witness the doctor that Andrew goes to see because of his recurring headaches, who says ""With all the Lithium you've been on, it's amazing you can even hear me.""

What I found odd about this film was the way it was reviewed by the mainstream media.  The cover of the DVD says ""Hilarious and Heartfelt.""  Hilarious?  It's as though the curmudgeons who review movies for a living weren't even sure what this movie was.  It was most certainly not a comedy, at least not foremost.  There were certainly funny scenes and some good lines, but the Garden State was a drama; a story about not only Andrew Largeman, but a number of people in their mid-20s who don't have life all figured out and who are struggling with that bleak reality.

I don't expect people of older generations to find this movie to be good at all. I'm certain my parents wouldn't like it at all.  But the fact is, the film truly speaks to people who are under the age of 30 and understand what it's like to be that age in the early 21st century.  Thirty years ago, life was figured out by your mid-20s.  People were married, had kids, knew what they wanted to do for a living for the next 30-40 years of their life... nowadays, it's not like that.  Being unsure of what's coming next when you're 26 is a fairly recent phenomenon, but it's not a crazy one.  Garden State explores those feelings and the psychological barriers that go along with them.

It is rare that I see a film that I feel so strongly about once it's over - Garden State is one that I really feel like I ""get.""

The soundtrack is excellent as well and the songs are in the exact order that they are in the film, as per writer-director-star Braff.

If you have the chance and you're under 30, check this one out.  I'm willing to bet you'll understand where all the characters are coming from.",1106524800,5,4325,4.367959949937422
1518164,4,B00005JNC2,"Zach Braff's directorial debut has similarities to the groundbreaking, timeless film ""The Graduate"".  Like Benjamin Braddock, Zach Braff's character, Andrew Largeman, is numb and uncertain as to where the future will lead him.  Zach's prescription drug dependency (for whom his father, a psychiatrist played by Ian Holm, is responsible) is symbolic of a numb existence and a lack of direction, similar to the scene of Benjamin Braddock floating in scuba gear in his swimming pool.  Largeman's encounter with Sam, portrayed by Natalie Portman, is reminiscent of Benjamin's relationship with Elaine. There is an almost immediate sense that these two are soulmates - that they can laugh together and cry together.  There are some tender, sensitive scenes such as when Andrew and Sam bury her hamster, ""Jelly"", and when Andrew and Sam sit in the empty bathtub together talking.  There are, however, some moments in the movie that made me cringe, mostly because our kids are usually watching most of the movies that we watch, or the parts that we allow them to, anyway. Maybe I'm not a fan of realism when it comes to male dogs...or voyeurism. In my opinion, these parts do nothing to enhance the film, and should have been removed or edited, and that's why I give the movie 4 out of 5 stars. The swear words could be toned down a bit, but much like other movies of 20-something characters (such as ""Good Will Hunting""), the language is to some degree necessary. I especially loved the scene where the three main characters (Peter Sarsgaard is the third main character) visit  a couple and their baby in an old ark-like boat located next to a natural wonder, a very deep chasm. The rain is pouring outside. Inside the landlocked boat,it's  cozy, warm and dry.  The couple share their feelings about making a mark in life being less important than being wholely and deeply in love.  As they leave, Andrew wishes the father good luck in exploring ""the infinite abyss"".  He calls back to Andrew, ""You, too!"", conveying that Andrew is in the process of discovering his own true nature and path in life.  The three main characters leave the peaceful comfort of the ark and stand at the top of the chasm in the rain yelling to create echoes and release all their tension and anxiety. When Andrew impulsively kisses Sam, it seems moving,real and tender - one of the few truly romantic screen moments that you want to relive over and over - and I did! This entire scene is perfect.  The music helped create the mood.  Simon and Garfunkel's ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" seemed perfect for the three characters dressed in garbage bags wandering around the chasm amidst the bulldozers. Now I have this scene from the movie etched in my mind when I listen to this song over and over! The movie's quirkiness - almost surreal or fairytale-like - is reminiscent as well of ""Harold and Maude"", another favorite of mine.  The characters' individual tics and shortcomings make them all the more real, vulnerable and believeable.  The final scene (plot spoiler) for Andrew and Sam again seems very ""Graduate""-like.  Okay, so they know they want to be together - what next?  Just like the classic scene of Benjamin and Elaine in the city bus...",1106524800,4,3224,4.801084990958409

1518197,5,B00005JNC2,"This movie's protagonist, Andrew Largeman, returns to his hometown for his mother's funeral after consciously avoiding it for years.  His familial relationships have been strained since childhood, and his ""friendships"" from school ignored.  He's been on multiple types of mood-regulating drugs for years, thereby going through life in an almost robotic stupor, unable to fully react to things or feel much.  When he returns home, he meets a girl who is his opposite--a bit of a neurotic mess, but charming nonetheless, who opens him up to the possibility of letting his guard down and really experiencing life.

This film is funny, serious, romantic (in a non-cute way), clever, artistic (without being too pretentious) all at the same time.  While a few things seemed a bit strained (I don't think that the main character really *needs* to be on drugs to feel alienated from his hometown, father, emotions, etc.--it seems a bit gimmicky in a way, though overmedication is definitely a real problem), in all it flows really well and is believable in its dialogue.

I really related to Large's feelings of disconnect and sense of no direction.... Probably 90% of people just out of college or in their early to mid-twenties can relate to it, as well as people who can still remember what that time in their life felt like.  I would definitely recommend that everyone check out this film.",1106265600,2,1386,4.974025974025974

1518201,3,B00005JNC2,"I liked this movie because I identified with its atmosphere of late twenty-something angst.  However, I cannot understand why people who review this film constantly venerate Natalie Portman.  Even the people who didn't like the film laud Portman's performance. I, however, wanted to strangle her.  This woman could not act her way out of a shopping bag.  I have despised every role I've seen her in. It's bad enough that she contributed additional lameness to the Star Wars prequels, but does she have to ruin an otherwise solid story by an amateur director? Who cast this girl, anyway? I found her performance contrived, forced and thoroughly annoying, a further testament to her inept acting skills. Why Zach, why? However, her performance did not ruin the film entirely and it is still worth watching and maybe even owning. The soundtrack is great too.  Maybe a future special edition can have a version with Portman's character completely edited out of every scene, dialogue and all, so it looks like Zach Braff is talking and interacting with an imaginary person. I wonder what impact that would have on the story in relation to Braff's character who is already loaded up on medication, taking hallucinogenic drugs, and at a point in life where nothing is as it seems. That might even make me add another star to this review.  For now, I will continue to cringe at Portman's hapless ineptitude.",1106092800,4,1399,4.906779661016949
1518202,3,B00005JNC2,"Zach Braff puts forth a noble effort in his writing/directorial debut. He develops interesting and mildly quirky characters, but unfortunately, they are left to support only an adequate plot involving themes of love, death and ""what am I going to do with my life"" angst.  The plot, much like the characters, seemed to be in a stage of twenty-something limbo. If it was intentional, I don't think it worked in the manner it was intended and managed to dull some of the luster from the shining characters.

Beyond the plot weakness, Braff does a good job of acting the emotionally numb lead role while Natalie Portman (whose previous acting I don't care for) gives her best performances to date in the supporting role. Their characters initially, are on two opposite ends of spectrum. His character is numb and emotionally distant while hers is supersensitive.  Somehow, a romance seems to bring them together and balance them out a bit before the story ends.  There's also some interesting but subtle commentary and insight which illustrates the potential overuse and mis-use of both recreational and professionally prescribed drugs.

The cinematography, visual imagery and soundtrack also do a good job of keeping this movie slightly above average.  The soundtrack featuring Coldplay and The Shins does an excellent job at capturing the mood of the generation-X angst. It's a melodic blend of mild indie-pop, rock and alt-country. Many generation x'ers seem to have enjoyed the soundtrack more than the film itself.

The documentary about the making of the film is also worth watching.

Overall, Garden State is a good directorial debut for Braff and one worth, at least, the cost of a rental.",1106006400,2,1693,5.0647482014388485

I got the feeling that Garden State was a tutorial in mid twenties limbo, the career isn't there, the life isn't there, where is my life for that matter? Seemed like I used to have one. Why do I feel numb to my surroundings? Zach Braff just made an excellent movie. I however have a better relationship with my parents, though not by much, and I don't have the dependancy on drugs that Zach's character has, prescription and recreational.

1518236,4,B00005JNC2,"The directorial film debut of television actor Zach Braff (who also wrote the script and stars) seems to be in danger of getting carried away with its own quirkiness about every five minutes. However, sheer earnestness, a keen ear for dialogue and a strong cast prevent this movie from going through the trapdoor of Braff's eccentric, heavily stylized view of his world. Inspired in part by his own life, Braff's movie tells the story of Andrew Largeman, a struggling television actor/waiter who returns to his hometown in New Jersey for the funeral of his mother. He is nearly catatonic with denial about his estrangement from his family and in particular, his father. He also reunites with some of his old friends, notably his grave-digging stoner buddy, Mark, and most importantly, meets and falls in love with Sam, a motor-mouthed Holly Golightly-type, who helps Andrew find himself again. It turns out that Andrew's psychiatrist father has been prescribing medication for him to stabilize his mood swings, one episode of which accidentally caused a deep and what seems to be an irreparable rift with his parents.

The film moves fluidly between humor and pathos, and fortunately Braff knows when to avoid making the story more heavy-handed than it needs to be. At various times, the film gets lost in its own visual style (such as the use of fast motion surrounding the static protagonist) and heavy use of symbolism (for example, the ark on the edge of a crater), making it feel a bit more contrived than it should. And the alternative rock soundtrack, while terrifically evocative, also creates that aura of creeping irrelevance. But Braff is smart enough to know to focus primarily on his characters, and that's the film's saving grace and greatest strength. Quite a remarkable cast has been assembled for such a small film. British acting stalwart Ian Holm is oddly cast as Andrew's father, but he is briefly effective in spite of the fact that most of the footage explaining his character's remoteness ended up on the cutting room floor (as seen in the deleted scenes). As pot-smoking, guitar-strumming Mark, Peter Sarsgaard proves again what a fiercely intelligent and versatile actor he is. It's hard to believe this is the same actor who played the conscientious magazine editor in ""Shattered Glass"" or the beguiling sex researcher in ""Kinsey"". Jean Smart has a funny cameo as Mark's blowsy mother, and they have a hilarious scene around the breakfast table talking to Mark's brother about his medieval castle job and speaking Klingon. As Sam, Natalie Portman is charming throughout, even though her character's random eccentricities constantly threaten to overwhelm her appeal. Braff himself seems less assured as a leading man perhaps because he sets up his character to be more of an observer until he comes to life in the concluding scenes, yet he does create a sense of good will that makes you want to know what will happen to him throughout the story.

Some of the plot strands do not work as smoothly as one would hope, for example, the burgeoning love between Andrew and Sam seems a bit jumpy in treatment and the reconciliation with his father feels fairly pat considering the painful history that preceded it. But on the plus side, Braff captures his childhood environment and adulthood angst with pinpoint emotional accuracy. At its best, the movie will remind you of the sense of isolation Benjamin Braddock felt in Mike Nichols' ""The Graduate"".  There is a good making-of documentary included in the DVD, as well as a series of deleted scenes that actually do help fill in some blanks left in the final film.

This is helped immensely by a superb soundtrack and assured performances by both Natalie Portman and Zach Braff, who pulls off an unlikely feat in not only writing and directing but also starring in his own feature film.

I opted for 2 stars only because its Braff's writing and directorial debut. He deserves at least some credit for his relatively average, if not meager, storytelling. That is where my optimism ends, however.

Before I establish anything else, let me first say that Zack is no actor. He attempts acting but fails miserably every time. On his  silly comedy, Scrubs, with 2 second takes and plenty of post-editing, it hardly matters. His inabilities make themselves all too evident, however, when sprawled uncomfortably over his first feature-length drama.

The acting is forced while Braff and Portman struggle to convey real emotion between the events that start their relationship. We first meet Portman when Zach goes to the doctor's office and we find out she likes the Shins - ""ooh.. I'm so Indie and quirky.. and I want you to know it!""

This movie tromps all over subtlety trying to convince us that these two have fallen from the status quo to truly discover what life and love are all about. Unfortunately, it fails.

Some create alternative realities with drugs and parties, and some just dream of what could be.  But the hero of the film, Andrew (Zack Braff), seeks a happy youth that never existed.  His nostalgia is for a home he never knew and joy he never felt.

""Garden State"" is Andrew's return to the hometown of his youth to attend the funeral of his mother.  While there, he struggles with the realities that have kept him medicated and in therapy for most of his life.  Numb and unemotional, Andrew seeks meaning and inspiration amid the ruins of his childhood.  He finds answers in the passionate and spontaneous Sam (Natalie Portman), his opposite in every way, except degrees of affliction.

Sam teaches Andrew lessons that the film tries to convey to the audience.  She promises the rewards of non-conformity and challenges Andrew to embrace life, even when it dishes out pain.  Ever the heart-stealer, Portman's irresistible performance will remind viewers of her break-out role in ""Beautiful Girls"", where even as a young girl, she provided direction and answers to a lost male in his mid-twenties.

Portman's livewire Sam fits nicely in this sometimes somber and slow-moving film.  Also helping prevent a boring tone is a wicked sense of humor.  Comedy sprouts up with incidents that focus on the peculiar elements of life, like Dessert Storm trading cards and noiseless Velcro.  Rather than manufacturing unrealistic comic situations, the film instead explores the nuances of life and allows humor to grow naturally.

Justly compared to ""The Graduate"" for its mood-establishing and generation-reflecting soundtrack, ""Garden State"" decorates its scenes with fresh, relaxing sounds.  Some have described the soundtrack as a ""lazy, rainy afternoon"", words that can be also applied to the film.  While that description may not sound like an enjoyable movie, one must not forget the charm and beauty of lazy, rainy days.",1105488000,2,2066,5.119402985074627

I'm a cinema buff and really watch a LOT of films every year, but there are just a small hand full of films that I hold in very high regard. When you watch as many movies as I do you tend to get a little jaded because there's just SO MUCH garbage out there, but I can tell you right now that this isn't the case with Garden State. Zach Braff has really constructed a fine piece of art that was just a breath of fresh air from start to finish and breaks the mold in almost every concievable way. I suppose that it also helps that, being 25 myself, the film really speaks to where I'm at in my life. That is not to say that the film doesn't speak to people of all ages, because it certainly does. There are themes in this film that people of all ages can appreciate, and that's the real genius of it. I can't give this film any higher recommendation.

 3. Are there any obvious mistakes (easter eggs) that should have been caught before it was released?

 4. Good story?

 5. Will scenes or songs haunt me after I see it?

This movie did it all for me. Gorgeous and stunning and heartfelt from beginning to end, scenes I'll never forget, dialogue that still rings in my ears and songs that are playing in my head every morning when I wake up.

  Same old story? Love and peace and hope...that's what spins the world---the quest for these is in every minuet and great detail of a person's life; most people just don't realize that they can choose to be happy. What works for one doesn't always work for another. Maybe someone who needed a different take on life found solace in this movie, that he/she wasn't alone.

No, it's not a flawless masterpiece. And yes, it does, ""borrow"" heavily from other more seminal films (Harold and Maude, The Graduate, Annie Hall).

But for what it is, a first effort for a very young writer-director, it is quite good.

This is Natalie Portman's best acting since The Professional.

1518363,4,B00005JNC2,"Our introduction to Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) after seeing him calmly sitting in the middle seat on an airplane that is apparently going down is to see him lying in a white bed in a white room looking like he is almost catatonic.  When the phone rings he does not answer it and we here a voice that turns out to be his father who has called to inform Andrew that his mother has drowned the previous night in the bathtub.  Although it has been years, Andrew will go home for the funeral and for the experience he decides not to take any of the pills in all of the neatly arranged bottles on the shelf in his medicine cabinet.  Clearly the drugs have something to do with his mother and by not taking them Andrew ensures that he will arrive back in New Jersey in a different state of mind.

In good time we will find out why Andrews' father (Ian Holm) has been proscribing drugs all these years.  The relationship between father and son is one of the ways we can gauge the progress that Andrew is making in the film as he finds his own voice again.  We also learn that despite being overmedicated Andrews is a would-be actor who has managed to score a gig as a retarded quarterback in some sort of cable movie.  This means that every time he runs into somebody back home it becomes clear they are going to mention the movie, comment on how long it has been since they have seen Andrew, and say something about his mother being dead.

I keep hearing that ""Garden State"" is ""The Graduate"" for this generation, but instead of seeing young Dustin Hoffman I keep thinking young Ray Romano (heavily sedated on drugs) every time I see Andrew.  I get the idea the film is also about growing up when you do not want to, but since Andrew does not sleep with Sam's mother there are some significant differences.  One of the problems of ""Garden State"" is that the character arc is basically Andrew waking up.  The movie petty much has to end when Andrew gets to the point that his eyes are finally open all the way, and that is basically what happens.  The other problem is the love story between Andrew and Sam (Natalie Portman), simply because the reason Sam likes Andrew is that Zach Braff, who plays Andrew, also wrote and directed the film.  So either the relationship only works because it is simply written that way or Sam puts a lot of faith in the opinion of a dog.  You decide.

What Andrew discovers when he gets home is that while his life is pretty sad none of his old friends and acquaintances are doing any better.  He might think that his life does not make sense, but then he runs into Kenny, Jesse, Mark and a bunch of other guys he went to high school with and it is clear he is doing better than most.  This helps him start to get his mind wrapped around the idea that his glass might be half full instead of half empty, and we await either his final epiphany or for the character to crash and burn (remember the airplane bit at the beginning?).  At least with ""Garden State"" we know it can legitimately go either way.

""Garden State"" is more different than it is brilliant, which is what makes it stand out as an example of Independent filmmaking.  If you do not cotton to its Indy sensibilities and sense of humor, then there is a good chance this film will not click for you.  This is a film where what is considered funny are things like ordering bread in a Vietnamese restaurant, a hamster too dumb to figure out the rolling wheel, a couple living on a boat at the bottom of a quarry, and returning knives without a receipt.  ""Garden State"" is a dark comedy, stopping well short of being a black comedy, but just like eating chocolate some people will find it to be to dark to enjoy.  But Braff gets major props for including ""One Of These Things First"" by Nick Drake in the soundtrack.",1105315200,2,3800,4.343705799151344
1518364,2,B00005JNC2,"A) Bad Casting. I've spent much time and Jersey. The actors in these roles seemed more like Californians or Midwesterners. Not very believable. I'm not saying stereotypes would have been better, but these actors seemed out of place in the Garden State. And Brit Ian Holm as a Jewish Jersey doctor?!

B)Too Cute on Too Many Levels. You can be cute a la ""Napoleon Dynamite"" with random quirky scenes, or you can be cute a la an endearing Ferris Bueller-type character (Portman's) who shows a pouting downer of a dude how to embrace life. This movie tries to do two things. But it does neither of them successfully. It's like putting both chocolate syrup and strawberry jam on your fried dough. Either is good. Both together are gross.

C) Loose Ends, Pointless Points. So many uninteresting questions left unanswered. Epilepsy? What about it? So what? Stolen jewelry? So what? Goofy cop? What about him? Things could have been tied together, related better. Yes, it leaves the viewer's mind free to Wonder, but not to Ponder. Give me a catharsis or a twist of an ending, and I will Ponder. Give me a bunch of loose ends without even trying to connect them, and I will Wonder why in the heck I just spent $4 on this rental.",1105315200,3,1220,4.617511520737327

I used to think Natalie Portman saved all of her bad acting for the Star Wars movies, but she is wooden and annoying in this one as well.

I rented this the other day - having always wanted to see it in theatres since I love Natalie Portman, but never having gotten around to it - and was just stunned. I sat there and was just stunned! Zach Braff's directorial debut was every aspiring writer/director's debut fantasy. Funny, heartwarming, touching, sad, dramatic, and romantic. The angles and the wide shots truly complemented the story and I suggest you all rent the DVD and look at the deleted scenes as there are a lot! They are incredible. Of course, the music - the soundtrack - was very well used, the Shins complemented the movie perfectly and I must say that sound editing was used very well as I understand that it was very noisy to film. You'd never guess.

A word about the actors - Braff proves himself opposite to SCRUBS in this film (it's almost worth it just to see Jean Smart smoke a bong) and really comes into his own, while his onscreen/offscreen chemistry with Natalie Portman drives the movie. She is an incredible talented actress and I am a huge fan. They are both fabulous together in this movie - you really believe they are in love and fighting for each other. It's amazing to witness. Plus, the feature commentary is also awesome.

1518412,4,B00005JNC2,"This movie is probably one of the best of year in my opinion. While far from perfect it is a fairly impressive script and I think the movie definitely connects on an emotional level. I have never posted anything on Amazon, but I felt like a couple of the recent posts have probably portrayed this movie in a somewhat inaccurate light and it would be a shame if people were steered away from enjoying a very good movie because of them. I just wanted to say to Firedancer that ""Yes, I do think you've missed something."" I think FD's preoccupation with exposing ""keenly obvious"" ""alternative"" (whatever that means) constructs permeating the movie is probably inaccurate and, in any case, definitely beside the point. I felt that the characters were effectively portrayed and resonated as maturing, somewhat confused and troubled young men and women. I also found the believable dialogue to be one of the stronger points of the movie. There is some emotional detachment between the main character and some of the other characters but I felt that was an accurate portrayal of coming home afer having been away for so long and trying to re-establish your bearings coupled with the residue of many years of pharmaceutically-induced emotional numbness. While it can be said that some of the scenes could be accused of being shot for ""cuteness,"" this is a romantic comedy (albeit of a somewhat darker grain) after all. I think it is thoroughly enjoyable and emotionally touching movie which should not be missed!!",1105142400,3,1504,4.901960784313726
1518413,3,B00005JNC2,"I can't say that I didn't enjoy Garden State. I found it rather cute, and yes, there were some situations and characters I could relate to. Anybody who's in or out of college has probably gone through the premise of losing touch with your hometown and drifting away from old friends. Garden State conveys this feeling of being out of the loop rather well in the first half. Natalie Portman also gives a rather good performance as Zach Braff's love interest, and if her quirks seem a little over-the-top, I've known people like her so I didn't find her character terribly unrealistic.

The problem with the film? Braff writes himself into a corner by the end, and he can either take the clich way out (which he does) or go the depressing route which would've alienated most of the audience. To me, the ending just didn't seem believable; it wrapped things up too nicely.

Being a 20-year-old college student, I know most people my age are treating this movie as a revelation, or ""my generation's"" film. But in all honesty, Sideways, a much more complex and emotionally rich film about forty-somethings, moved me much more (to tears almost). As well, I'd choose The Graduate over this any day. Garden State is worth a rental, but not worth the heaps of worship bestowed upon it.",1105142400,6,1276,4.691964285714286
1518414,2,B00005JNC2,"I kept missing this movie at the theatres, so I had to wait until it came out on DVD.  By the time I was able to rent it, I was extremely excited to see what all the hype was about.  I'd already purchased the album, and the musical score sounded great and exactly what I'd expected.  I'd assumed this movie was going to be this deep, intense, intimate excursion into a young success's reluctant but eye-opening return home to the simpleton life he once led.  At least, that's how I thought it was pitched and marketed.

Wow, was I sorely disappointed.  For starters, the movie is an abyss of the beginnings of really great characters...and that's where you are left, with a handful of characters, completely lacking development or depth.  The actors do a great job running with the roles that they're given, but the problem is, the character portrayals don't go deep enough to allow you to connect with them.  I don't believe this is the fault of the actors, but rather, of the script itself.  Largeman (Braff) is a relatively mute, expressionless character, who seems to try too hard to say something interesting when he does open his mouth.  Sam (Portman) is a conundrum of incredibly ridiculous actions and words, all thrown together in order to force the painful objective that this girl is really ""weird.""  These abstractions in the characters and their unnaturalness really prevent the audience from connecting as Braff intended, in a sort of ""Everyman/woman"" context.  The scenes are unquestionably shot with the idea of being ""alternative"" (it is keenly obvious, since the triteness of some of the scenes is excruciating), as a great deal of what is said is for the sheer and awkward aim of being ""different,"" and not so much for the value of the words or their relevance to some coherent story line.  For instance, the kissing scene on the back of the dump truck (the scene probably most publicized, with the three main characters screaming off the back of a truck) is so out of place, it's uncomfortable.  The relationship between Sam and Largeman is entirely without true depth, and the scene closing out the movie between Largeman and Sam is surprisingly unemotional and completely unrealistic.  The same goes for the relationship between Largeman and his father; although there, it's actually supposed to feel uncomfortable, yet it feels the same as the feelings evoked from his relationship with Sam.  It seems like nothing in the movie quite meshes, yet everything successfully butts heads with everything else.

I apologize for being one of the few voices of disagreement, but I had to let you know that this one let me down incredibly.  I watched it with a friend, who wholeheartedly agreed with my opinion of the movie, so maybe I'm just not ""alternative"" enough to understand this movie.  My recommendation is to buy the soundtrack; that's money well-spent.",1105142400,16,2876,4.868583162217659
1518415,4,B00005JNC2,"""Garden State"" is a quirky Generation-Y love story written, directed, and starring Zach Braff. Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returns to his hometown in New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral after a 9-year absence. Overmedicated since he was 10 years old by his psychiatrist father (Ian Holm) for problems that may never have existed, Andrew decides to go without his meds for the trip. He catches up with old high school friends and meets an eccentric, talkative woman named Samantha (Natalie Portman) whose unusual ways of coping with her own problems might be the perfect match for him.

""Garden State"" is one of those films that is populated with idiosyncratic characters. Fortunately, most of them are not written over the top or overplayed. Peter Sarsgaard is almost too good an actor for his role as Andrew's old friend, Mark. It's nice to see him, but his performance begs for a meatier role. Jean Smart has a couple of good scenes as Mark's mother. Ian Holm mostly creates an impression, rather than a character, as Andrew's father, because he has so little to do. This supporting cast is so impressive that it left me feeling that their talent had been underutilized. But Zach Braff's Andrew and Natalie Portman's Samantha (Sam) are the film's focus. Andrew is a quiet, introverted, slightly dweeby man who tends to view life from the outside looking in. Sam has so many eccentricities that it stretched credibility and became a little annoying. I found her childlike nature to be particularly odd and unlikely -or, if not unlikely, at least unattractive. The character is a mish-mash of too many things and would benefit from some paring down. But ""Garden State"" belongs to the genre of ""quirky love stories"", and that is what it delivers. Many of the film's best moments are found in its absurdist humor. The love story is sweet. And the characters are distinctive.

The DVD: Bonus features include 16 deleted scenes with optional commentary, a making-of documentary, outtakes/bloopers, a ""Soundtrack Promo Spot"", and 2 audio commentaries. ""The Making of Garden State"" (27 minutes) is a loosely organized documentary that features short interviews with the film's producers, cast, principal crew, and even the craft service guy. I can't say that its very informative. There is more information on making the film in the audio commentaries. The first audio commentary is by writer/director/actor Zach Braff and actress Natalie Portman. It primarily discusses filming from the point of view of an actor or a director dealing with actors, not technical aspects of filming. The second audio commentary is by Zach Braff, director of photography Lawrence Sher, editor Myron Kerstein, and production designer Judy Becker. Discussion of the technical aspects of filming are in this commentary. Both commentaries are casual but interesting, without long lulls between remarks. If you listen to only one, I recommend the second, technical, commentary, which is a little more engaging and substantive. Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing is available in Spanish.",1105142400,,3107,5.162698412698413

Natalie Portman SHINES as Sam, a highly spirited, optomistic, good-hearted young woman who brings this missing presence into the life of a shattered person.  Everything in this movie works, from very strange and wonderful moments like a hamster funeral or a figure skating crocodile, to very romantic and emotional moments that anyone can relate to.  When in the movie, Braff's character screams in the rain, it is almost representative of him letting go of everything, in this swirling revelation in a near-religious experience, and it is one of the most wonderful moments in any film of 2004.

1518473,5,B00005JNC2,"Zach Braff's directorial debut, Garden State, is the essence of an independent film. Made for a paltry (by Hollywood standards) $2.5 million, it has gone on to gross over ten times its budget and, more importantly, become the defining film for a generation of young, disaffected people who clearly identify with this personal movie and its fascinating characters.

There is an audio commentary by Braff and Portman that is quite engaging and personable. Not surprisingly, Braff dominates while Portman gamely asks him many questions to keep things going.

There is a second audio commentary featuring Braff, director of photography Lawrence Sher, editor Myron Kerstein and production designer Judy Becker. With his dry wit, Braff MCs this track as the participants talk about the more technical aspects of the movie.

Also included are 16 deleted scenes with optional commentary by all the participants from the second commentary. Braff puts the footage in its context and talks about why they were cut (for time).

""The Making of Garden State"" examines how Braff put his movie together. There is quite a bit of decent behind-the-scenes footage and plenty of interview soundbites from the cast and crew. For a Making Of featurette it is refreshingly free of an excess of clips from the movie that always pad out the running time of these things.

There is also a fairly amusing collection of blown lines and bloopers.

Finally, there is a promo for the film's soundtrack.

Garden State is a film bursting with ideas, keen observations on life and memorable images that make most other films look inert by comparison. There is a tendency for first-time filmmakers to throw everything into the mix on their debut because they aren't sure if the film will succeed and they'll get a second chance. Based on the strong critical and commercial success of Garden State, I don't think Zach Braff will have this problem.",1104883200,8,1911,5.0284810126582276

There is no new, good humor and at the end it's just a sappy love story. Now, maybe the movie would be better if people hadn't told me it was ""amazing"" ""the best movie ever"" before i had seen it, because it definetly IS NOT. If you like corny love movies, or want to cuddle with your honey then i suppose this is a good movie, other than that do not expect too much depth out of this movie.

1518476,5,B00005JNC2,"Garden State may resonate with older classic films like The Graduate, or more recent ones like Beautiful Girls, but the film still manages to carve out its own beautiful identity through wonderful characters, rich performances, and the meticulous, careful eye of its writer and director Zach Braff. It was also impressive enough to snag Braff The national Board of Review's award for this year's best debut by a director.

You may know Braff as the wacky Dr. John ""J.D."" Dorian on the excellent sitcom Scrubs on NBC. Though in Garden State, Braff does a complete 180 turn on screen and behind the lens, taking us on a journey of rediscovery, redemption, and love. Braff plays Andrew Largeman, a wannabe LA actor, who's only notable credit is playing a retarded quarterback in a made for TV movie. He leads a nearly comatose existence, terminally numb from any real feeling, largely due to the fact he is medicated to the hilt with every anti-depressant known to man. His hazy existence is abruptly interrupted when he's summoned back to his home state of New Jersey, after being informed via answering machine by his estranged father (Ian Holm) that his paraplegic mother has drowned to death in the bath. Don't fear; Garden State is a comedy above anything else.

Void of any medication back home, Andrew slowly begins an emotionally awakening as he cleanses his body and soul of years of somberness, which had been caused partly by a medicine cabinet full of drugs, and more so by the emotionally baggage he's been carrying regarding his now dead mother. He starts re-connecting with the familiar places and people of his past, and is ultimately transformed by Sam, a free-spirited, Shins loving pathological liar wannabe, played by a wonderfully funny and touching Natalie Portman, who steals almost every scene she's in. She accompanies Andrew throughout his visit home, and ends convincing him that life and love do indeed exist after Zoloft.

Garden State is further enhanced by great supporting performances by a superb Peter Sarsgaard, who plays Andrew's childhood friend and companion throughout most of the film. British thesp Ian Holm is also effective as Andrew's Psychiatrist Dad, who attempts throughout the film to reconcile with his son, and finally does if albeit a small way at the end of the film. The film is also rich with small, quirky performances by all the people from Andrew's past. All of that, partnered with a truly awesome soundtrack featuring the likes of the aforementioned Shins, Nike Drake, and Simon & Garfunkle, make for a long-remembered anthem for the 20-30 something's who are looking for one good thing to come along that changes their lives forever.

The Garden State DVD is chock full of extras, including 16 deleted scenes, most of which are extensions of scenes that made the final cut. In watching them, you will immediately appreciate the caution first time director Braff shows with sacrificing the overly dramatic and over written portions that got cut from the final film. The DVD also features two great commentary tracks, one with Braff and some of the other filmmakers, and the second, most enjoyable track which just features Braff and Natalie Portman, who exchange witty banter and give us insight into the real story behind silent Velcro, as well as exchange other quirky back stories that are just as enjoyable as watching the two act on screen. A ""Making-Of"" Featurette, and a short blooper real round out a comprehensive collection of special features that will make your Garden State experience all the more meaningful. It's a small film with a huge heart, and one of the best films of the year.

1518477,5,B00005JNC2,"Garden State is not phenomenal.  The script is not genius, the acting is not Oscar calliber and, believe it or not, there are better sound tracks out there.  However, this movie is pretty irresistable.

Zach Braff (writer, director and star) wrote the screen play for Garden State while in college, a fact made pretty obvious by the lovely angsty cliches.  But in Braff's subtle hands, what could be tarnished by the shallow pathos of a twenty-something is allowed to flourish into a touching coming of age story.

The premise is simple and effective: Braff plays Andrew Largeman, a young man who has recently decided to ""take a vacation"" from the numbing antidepressants he has been on for a decade.  He flies home from LA for his mother's funeral, and happens to meet a quirky beauty named Sam (Natalie Portman).  As Andrew reimmerses himself back in his home town in the Garden State, he must deal with old friends, new love, and deep family issues.  All within four days, of course.

Lucky for us, four days is equivilent to about a fast paced hour and a half.  Natalie Portman steals every scene, with her charming lies and intense facial expressions.  Although Braff and Portman don't seem to exude tons of sexual chemistry, their jarring interactions are flawless.

No, Garden State won't win a slew of Oscars.  But it will win you over anyway, dead hamster or not.",1104796800,21,1372,4.762711864406779
1518478,5,B00005JNC2,"My viewing of Garden State was pure happenstance, I went to see one film and changed my mind once I got to the theatre; I will forever be grateful for that random moment of fate.

I loved this movie probably more than I should; it is not without its flaws. But having been subjected year after year to the over budgeted, overblown and over hyped mainstay of major studios this film was truly a godsend for those of us who love film. It is not for everyone, some will hate it, some will find it pretentious, some will find it too slowly paced, but others will ""get"" it and truly love what Zach Braff has created.

The acting is brilliant, real, and heartfelt (welcome back Natalie, Peter brilliant as ever, Zach you are so much more than a loveable clown), the script witty and smart, the cinematography, beautiful and the composition of some of the scenes are astounding considering this is Braff's first feature film.

The story is simple - the redemptive power of choosing to live ones life - not the life your parents have chosen for you, not the life society says you must live but your life. There is so much power in that choice, to live life without reserve, without fear of failure, without the fear of giving and receiving love.

An impressive debut Mr. Braff, thank you.",1104710400,4,1280,4.504310344827586
1518479,5,B00005JNC2,"I was fortunate enough to view Garden State twice in theaters. The long wait until it came out on DVD was aggrivating, but the soundtrack was able to keep me occupied for awhile. This movie presented a different way of telling a story. Zach Braff (actor/director/writer of Garden State) was not in it for the shock value or the sob fest, but in it just for his own personal fun and pleasure of making a movie he enjoyed. The casting was superb. Starting out in the film festivals, I'd say Garden State was definitely a sucess story to be remembered for all time. Not only is this movie full of hilarity, but a touching love-story as well. This movie does not exactly have a clear problem and resolution. If you do, in fact, buy or rent this movie, I would recommend watching the extras, including deleted scenes, bloopers/outtakes, and The Making of Garden State, along with the commentary by Natalie Portman and Zach Braff and the commentary by Zach Braff and the crew. They are very worth while and you learn a tremendous amount about the movie and why things ocurred. Overall, this is the best movie I have seen in a very long time and would encourage everyone to watch it. It will definitely change your life.",1104710400,,1213,4.568807339449541

Garden State is, simply put, one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Certainly, one might argue that the idea has been done before, but with untold thousands of movies having been made already, what idea hasn't yet been explored?

It's the way Zach Braff does it that makes Garden State such a work of genius.  The movie is fresh, it's original.  It's not Hollywood, trying to make a buck before all else.

The acting is superb, the jokes witty enough to require thought, and deep enough to be watched several times in the space of only a few days.  Not to mention the DVD extras, which are at once hilarious and informative.

There are lots of people who say that Natalie Portman deserves an Oscar for her performance as Sam.  I'm one of them.",1104710400,,989,4.263440860215054

1518493,5,B00005JNC2,"First-time director Zach Braff also stars in and wrote the screenplay for ""Garden State"", 2004's most original and charming American romantic comedy after ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". The movie is a little uneven - some of the scenes do not work as well as others. Overall, though, it is a satisfying delight. And I doubt any recent movie addresses the angst of contemporary twentysomethings as well as this one does.

Andrew Largeman [Braff] is an aspiring actor living in Los Angeles. He works as a waiter in a trendy restaurant. He hasn't been home to New Jersey in nine years, but when his wheelchair-bound Mom dies, he has no choice but to return. There, he reunites uncomfortably with his psychiatrist father [Ian Holm]. He meets up with his childhood buddies, most of who seem to have met dead ends in life. The one who has `succeeded' by making a fortune has found a dead end of his own. Along the way, Andrew meets a very unique girl [Natalie Portman]. Something in her awakens a part of him, something which, because of his very unfortunate childhood, has long been dormant. But is it too late? Can Andrew, who has survived on anti-depressants and therapy for a dozen years, break free and become himself for the first time?

The cast is sublime and manages to override all of the mostly minor script deficiencies. The music is exceptionally appropriate.

For everyone who has ever been estranged from their roots, then found a route home, ""Garden State"" is a real find.",1104537600,2,1492,4.7528957528957525
1518494,1,B00005JNC2,"Upon hearing that his mom has passed away, a young Ray Romano flies back to his homeland in New Jersey -- a.k.a., the Garden State. (Think about it.) The death of his mother ostensibly creates an opportunity for Ray to bond with his coldly British father, Ian Holm, but things are as awkward as ever and pop remains distant... probably because he has nagging doubts about Ray really being his progeny. Ray is torn. Ray is confused. Ray is trying to find himself. It's a shame about Ray. I am Ray's seething revenge. Wait a minute...

Ray is a sensitive guy. We know this because he maintains a superior air and only reluctantly participates in the wild orgy of young-person debauchery that surrounds him. (Contents include drugs, alcohol, smoking, and sexual situations, i.e. kissing. Oh, those young people, with their kissing.) Ray is coming of age, and through Ray we explore universal 'coming of age' crises and conflicts. For instance, Ray is surrounded by his old friends, yet he feels alienated by their efforts to exploit his success in Hollywood. Little wonder that the stress of Ray's constant soul-smirking catches up to him in the form of devastating ""split-second"" headaches, which prompt a same-day appointment for an MRI -- again, a universal rite of passage into adulthood. How will he ever get to the Garden State? Exit 12, maybe?

Forty-five minutes into this ""The Graduate for the 90's, er, 00's"" and the lead character has yet to express an emotion other than mild scorn. Eventually, Queen Amidala shows up and uses her newfound Jedi mind tricks to bring him out of his shell. Hey, that's a new one! Finally, a film where a krazy-kooky, unpredictable woman gets a repressed guy to open up and show his emotions and even cry! In your face, Dharma and Greg!! Strip away the hep-cat soundtrack and you've got, I don't know, Along Came Polly but without the ferret, or Rocky III without the boxing.

For the past nine years he's been sedated on a ton of antidepressants but for this trip home he's decided to leave it all behind.

Very well done Zach Braff!",1104451200,,617,4.669724770642202
1518496,5,B00005JNC2,"You ever have one of those ""wow"" moments after a movie? You know, the final scene darkens, the credits roll, and you just sit there thinking. It's like a good song or a good book: you just feel satisfied when it's over. Garden State gives you one of those moments.

One of the best things about it is that it's nothing like any movie you'll ever see. It's not a movie where you can coherently answer the question, ""What's it about?"" because the plot doesn't follow the average story line. I guess you could say that Garden State is about people. It's a love story of the highest sort. Not only between a man and a woman, but between a man and himself. It's the story of the most significant journey in a man's life--the journey home.

What really makes this movie stand apart from others is the writing. Zach Braff, who also directed and starred in the film, brilliantly crafted a screenplay that both connects you with the characters and allows you to examine your own life in their context. However, it wasn't brooding or dark in the least. In fact, you often laugh despite yourself throughout.

This is due only in part to the writing, as the acting is also superb. Braff really develops his character (Andrew) as the movie progresses. Natalie Portman shines as the quirky, lovable Samantha who absolutely transforms Andrew's life. All of the other characters are relatively minor in comparison, but they're all well played and accent the depth of Braff's character.

The soundtrack also gets an honorable mention. Featuring Colin Hay, Nick Drake, Iron & Wine, Simon & Garfunkel, and the Shins (among others), the soundtrack is more than just background music. It adds to the mood and meaning of the movie. If my life had a soundtrack, and I wish it did, I'd want it to be this one.

A number of characters in Garden State talk about doing something unique, something like nobody else has ever done. Zach Braff has in creating this movie.

1518497,4,B00005JNC2,"It seems that every few years, somebody has to make an independent, critically acclaimed version of that classic, Dante's Inferno.  Usually I lose interest once I realize where the plot is coming from, but Garden State kept me watching through a mixture of fascination with Zach Braff's soft inscrutability and a clever mixing-up of the story elements.  This is one ""Inferno"" that took me by surprise.

Zach Braff  both masterminded and starred in this film about a twentysomething guy trying to find himself on a visit home to lay his mother to rest.  Through a combination of ceaseless drug ""therapy"" and emotional alienation from his family, Andrew has been numb for years and can't even seem to summon up tears at the funeral.  He meets up with some old school friends and tries to console himself with the same old-same old toxic remedies of loveless sex and altered states, but somehow they have lost their effectiveness and leave him hungrier than before for something meaningful. Even worse are the series of characters that Andrew encounters throughout his home town; each one is living some kind of illusion to the point of becoming caricatures of real people. Then he finds Sam (Natalie Portman), the first person in his life who has no self-delusions.  Sam is openly flawed, funny and compassionate.  She challenges him to look for truth in everything, even his pain.  It is a turning point that leads to important revelations.

I loved the way this film was written and paced so that Andrew's feelings of being lost and confused are infectious to me, the audience, yet it never becomes morose or dark.  This same slowness did work against it at times, but there are also some genuinely funny moments and some genuinely touching scenes. It did seem to lack a little in the way of intensity when Braff makes his self-discoveries ( I was left wondering if there wasn't more to his weirdness than the mundane reason behind all his pain). Overall though, Garden State was a well-acted and well-crafted offering for the cult-classic-to-be crowd.  Besides - who *doesn't* like Natalie Portman???

Garden State is sure to satisfy when you are looking for something more than a summer blockbuster clich.  Generally recommended for generations Y, X and Portman fans.

1518498,2,B00005JNC2,"I can see why many have compared this to the Graduate. It has that im awake but still dreaming kind of feel. When watching this, it feels like there's an adventure happening but really the plot itself is just a link of quirky gimmick after quirky gimmick. The film however is easy to watch and really is visually stunning. There are plenty of quirky scenes, characters and visuals to keep us from falling asleep, but these quirky gimmicks, however, were just that. They were petty, shallow attempts at adding entertaing value-- each one worth about half a second of chuckling. I can here Braff thinking to himself, ""this scene is missing something... oh, lets add an overexcited dog! Ooh, that's witty!"" The movie is filled with this kind of cheap tactic to make the empty and meaningless characters' lives actually interesting enough to follow, but really they don't make sense.

First of all, no one makes shirts out of left over wall material and gives them as gifts. That's not comfortable. No one is that shameless. No one who works at Medieval Times goes to work in full plate mail armor. They don't even wear that expensive stuff. I'm not even sure they wear helmets. That bit where they try to return stuff for cash at the giant hardware store... retail stores don't work like that at all. Loss prevention would be all over those crooks. And what was up with Zach Braff living in LA working at an Asian restuarant. That is ridiculous. Ethnic restaurants always hire family or local immigrants because they can pay them ridiculously lower wages. They won't hire young, smug wannabe actors. The list just goes on and on...

On a positive note, I have to say this movie has really opened my eyes on how to rate movies. It makes it so much easier! This movie is an exact 5 out of 10! Whenever I see movies now, I think back to this. Was it better or worse than Garden State, and then rate accordingly.

This movie is completley overrated. After reading a couple of reviews for this movie, I just had to write my own. There are too many wannabe roepers and far too many unemployed film students who like this movie. This must have something to with this movie being about 26 year olds who haven't done anything with their lives. Yeah, I bet that's it.",1104364800,9,2254,4.574257425742574

Natalie Portman- amazing.  She really captured her character and I can't imagine anyone else.

1518561,4,B00005JNC2,"Who knew within the confines of Zach Braff's mind rested such a beautiful, moving script as Garden State. And who knew he had within him the directing skills to pull off such a powerfully quiet performance and movie. Garden State takes off with a vision of quirkiness, and lands nearly perfectly on its two feet at the end.

Braff, who wrote, directed, and starred in this movie, plays Andrew Largeman, a one time California actor who's forced to return to his childhood home after the untimely death of his mother. Landing in New Jersey, zombie-like Largeman is placed in the middle of his many issues, having at once to begin to deal with them. In the mix, Natalie Portman plays Samantha, a seemingly bizarre girl who's the most refreshing wind in Largeman's stale life. They meet, and a fairly predictable story ensues.

However, the beauty of this script lies not in the story, but the quiet craziness that Braff inhabits in the movie. Nearly every scene revels in something bizarre, be it a shirt that matches wallpaper, or Samantha's hamster-loving house. Never once is this quirkiness exploited, but unfolds as naturally as Braff's performance as Largeman. You can trust Braff's unpredictability throughout the movie, because it's rich and gentle at the same time. There are too many moments in this film that are memorable, and visually stunning.

It's only the ending of the film, which I shall not reveal, that somewhat betrays the rest of the tone of the film. Sure I was pleased with it, but it all in all felt somewhat false and forced on us. Many people I'm sure love the ending, but I wasn't convinced with it. That being said, it wasn't enough to ruin any part of the rest of this film.

If this is the world that Braff inhabits in his imagination, the world is in store for more beauty from him in the near future. In the meantime, sit back, relax, and enjoy spending time with the oddness of New Jersey in Garden State.",1104364800,3,1937,4.671554252199414
1518562,3,B00005JNC2,"I realize that my review will probably be marked unhelpful as mine is not the popular opinion.  I make no apologies, except to say that what I am writing is, in my opinion, fair and not an outright slam of the film.

First, I have to profess my admiration and enormous respect for Zach Braff as an actor. He is talented and charming. I was extremely excited to see his debut as both a writer and producer. I heard Garden State compared to other creative indie productions I enjoyed such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Lost in Translation. Unfortunately, I am not of the same opinion.

I found the majority of the films quirkiness to be refreshing. Braff's personality and humor really shined through and provided much needed comic relief. It could not carry the film though.

I felt the dialogue and acting was wanting. My main problem with the film was that the quirky and creative moments were peppered with contrived moments. At times, I felt the message of the film was shoved down my throat. There were beautifully shot scenes illustrating Braff's loneliness and struggle that were undone by spelling it out ad nauseam via dialogue. Pivotal moments in the movie were lost on trite rhetoric. Braff was ineffectual in scenes that were meant to be riveting, such as the scene where he confronts his father. I didn't feel the coldness between them. There was little passion and anger. Braff's portrayal of a cold, unfeeling, Prozac-nation bi-product, was wonderful. But when his lust for life was revamped, it didn't come through. It felt like it was missing a piece, ultimately falling flat where it really needed to shine.

Overall, I had a hard time connecting with characters. Braff would grab me, but the interaction with the other cast members was often times forced or uninteresting. I felt Portman's character was overtly eccentric, making her more annoying than endearing in certain scenes.

The premise of the film was certainly interesting, but it was undercooked. Perhaps if Braff let someone else direct it would have melted together more smoothly. It takes a very special talent to both star and direct a film, especially one attempting to challenge human emotion paradigms. I don't think he has it together yet. That said, I look forward to future ventures from Braff. He does have promise. Hopefully he has learned from his rookie mistakes and will turn out a more even and compelling film the next go.",1104364800,10,2433,4.836538461538462

1518566,5,B00005JNC2,"Zach Braff is a talented guy and in creating GARDEN STATE (first known as LARGE'S ARK) he demonstrates not only a sense of the looney and surreal, but a tidy handling of the fallout of emotional isolation that plagues many of our youth, our baby boomers, and yes, even our older fugitives from life.  It is rare when a film is conceived, written, directed and acted by one person and the result is a unique and timely little treasure like this one.

Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) lives in Los Angeles as an actor and is in a vegetative state of emotional paralysis supported by mind-numbing medications.  A call from his cold and distant father (Ian Holm) informs him he is needed at home in New Jersey to attend the funeral of his physically paralyzed mother who has accidentally drowned in the bathtub. Andrew flies to New Jersey (in a film sequence of a crashing plane that is unexpectedly hilarious) to the family and friends he has not seen in nine years.  His friends include some of the quirkiest folks you're likely to meet: Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), Kenny the cop (Michael Weston), Dave (Alex Burns) among others.  These folks are all as odd as Andrew and it is only when Andrew encounters Samantha the chronic liar (Natalie Portman) that he is able to begin to absorbs Sam's lust for living and ultimately get a grip on his aimless life, face his demons (the major one having to do with his mother's paralysis...) and commit to change.

The action is fast, with pauses for some absolutely ludicrous events that are at once hilarious and tender.  All of the actors are superb, with Portman, Braff and Sarsgaard the most outstanding.  It may take a while to filter the storyline and process of filming through your mind: this is creative filmmaking at a new level. But the ultimate effect is a piece of work that deserves repeated viewings and serves notice that Braff is a talent to watch. Grady Harp, December 2004",1104278400,3,1921,4.662721893491124
1518567,5,B00005JNC2,"I have never been so touched and inspired by a movie than I was as I sat in the theatre watching Garden State. This movie is extremely funny, wonderfully romantic, and undeniably intelligent; I sat there in awe throughout the whole movie. This movie is a must-see, you will not regret escaping reality for 109 minutes as Zach Braff takes you on a journey that will have you laughing histerically and crying your eyes out at the same time. Every character in this movie is very well acted and each serves as a piece of the puzzle which makes this movie fit together so well.

Do yourself a favor and buy this movie, I can assure you it will be the most worthwhile movie experience you have had in a long time.",1104278400,4,708,4.363636363636363
1518568,5,B00005JNC2,"I've been a fan of Zach Braff ever since SCRUBS aired on NBC for the first time in 2001. I've followed Scrubs every season thereafter because of the witty humor and the intelligent jokes (not found too often on other network television shows) So I was genuinely excited when I picked up a magazine one day and read about Zach Braff's intentions on making a movie all his own. Months  went by and the website for the movie went up and I stopped by often to see what progress had been made. All of a sudden I realized that this movie is going to be something different. A few more months went by and the trailer was finally released. A symphony of melancholy shots set to the beautifully arranged track ""Let Go"" by Frou Frou (a band that this movie has helped me 'discover') I knew from then on that I would do whatever it takes to see this movie in theaters. I live in a rural area and knew that there wasn't much of a chance that Fox Searchlight would be able to send a reel to a theater too close by so I started looking up the distribution list and found that a theater 90 miles away was going to show it in August. I gathered some friends and we road-tripped to see this movie. It was worth it. This was one of the most emotionally touching film's I've ever laid eyes on. When you leave this film you start to analyze your own life and wonder if there's any way you can recognize the smaller things and appreciate them, instead of getting lost in all of your problems. Zach Braff has already proven to the world that he's a talented visionary of a director and did an absolutely amazing job writing and acting as well. I'm very excited about this film's almost surreal success as it will most definitely provide more opportunities to Zach to share with us some more heartfelt and meaningful content. I still watch Scrubs every Tuesday because, like Garden State it's a show that has hilarious shenanigans to show you, but at the same time, provides a powerful message.",1104278400,,1971,4.385245901639344
1518569,5,B00005JNC2,"Every so often there are films that come along and are able to elicit very strong emotional reactions from viewers based on specific scenes or characters that can be related to.  This movie came out of nowhere and gobsmacked audiences with it's raw tenderness and sincerity.  Zach Braff (lead actor, writer and director) creates a portrait of a young man coasting through life in a perpetual state of medicated-numbness until the accidental death of his mother forces him to return to the home, family and friends he abandoned seven years prior.  While hom, he has a chance meeting with a girl who embodies an energy and spirit that is something that he hadn't realized had been missing from his life, and everything in his life is turned upside down.  For the first time he begins unleashing his emotions and actually lives his life instead of letting it slip through his fingers day-by-day.  In order to live in the present he has to revisit the past he has been avoiding for so long.  Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm and Natalie Portman offer excellent supporting performances as characters that go beyond the typical cookie-cutter melodrama casts that seem so common in recent movies.  Despite being genuinely touching, the movie has great elements of humor and clever wit as well.  Much like The Breakfast Club and Reality Bites before it, Garden State is a great representative film for it's generation and will doubtlessly become a classic.  It is one of those rare movies that you just can't quite get out of your head after you see it for the first time, whether you relate to it personally or not.",1104192000,,1601,4.792727272727273
1518570,5,B00005JNC2,"I have been recommending it to all of my friends and I will continue to do so. I was immediately and irresistably drawn into the characters. Zach is beautifully awkward as Andrew, giving a convincing performance as someone who is gradually waking up after years of living life in a fog. Natalie Portman is stupendous and glowing. She manages to be goofy and beautiful and sad and joyful without overplayingn or being maudlin or sentimental about it. The chemistry between Andrew and Sam seems authentic and the supporting cast certainly holds their own. The soundtrack is amazing, rich, and well matched to the action in the movie. Yes, the movie has its small flaws (the dialogue is occasionally stilted and awkward, and a couple of scenes seem a little forced), but overall I thought that the movie's heart more than made up for any of that. It may be, though, as a friend and I decided, that you'll have to be in a certain stage of your life or identify with Andrew's situation in some way to truly appreciate it.",1104192000,,1016,4.65
1518611,5,B00005JNC2,"Natalie Portman is awesome in this excellent movie. Probably my favorite movie of 2004 that no one has heard of. Check out Portman in ""Closer"" as well.",1103932800,,151,4.62962962962963
1518612,5,B00005JNC2,"Garden State is such a great movie on so many levels.  It has its moments where it is funny, sweet, and sad yet is done in such a way that it flows very well.  Writer-Director-Actor Zach Braff does a good job of capturing moments in these peoples lives that have a heartfelt and lasting impact long after the movie is over.

  Just as esential to the movie and its story is the soundtrack.  Braff used a great selection of mostly indie bands including coldplay, the shins, nick drake, and an excellent cover of 'Such Great Hights' by Iron & Wine.  Listening to the soundtrack is like listening to a live cd by your favorite band and remembering what it was like to be at the concert.

  There is only so much I can say about this movie without telling the whole plot, but if your are just a little interested you MUST see this movie.  Who knows, it might change your life.",1103932800,3,872,4.320987654320987
1518613,5,B00005JNC2,"It really is a great romantic comedy, but really it's more than that. It's about this twenty something guy who returns home, after many years, when he finds that his mother has died. This is a film by first time writer/director Zach Braff (yes the guy from Scrubs), but don't let that shy you away from it. It definately doesn't come off as a first film. There is a nice blend of drama and comedy through out the film. Some of the film will bring a small smile to your face, but other parts will have you laughing out loud. In my opinion this is one of the better comedies that came out this year. It's atleast worth a try....",1103932800,3,626,4.225
1518614,5,B00005JNC2,"Garden State, Zach Braff's directorial debut, is an impressive achievement. I have, since I saw the film last summer, become a huge fan of Zach and the music of ""The Shins,"" a band featured prominently throughout the Grammy-nominated soundtrack. The character played by Natalie Portman is quirky, but no less charming. The plot consists of a young man who has not yet fulfilled his dreams of becoming an actor. He returns to New Jersey for his mother's funeral and reunites with old friends. Along the way he meets Natalie Portman, who essentially changes his outlook on life. Anyways, I won't say much else, other than this was a great movie...sweet, romantic, cool, and visually engaging. Enjoy!",1103760000,2,697,5.017241379310345
1518615,5,B00005JNC2,"I just want to say, that Zach Braff is awesome. Not only is he a great director and writer, but a great actor as well. The movie is funny and serious, a nice balance. Braff really knows what he is doing.",1102896000,2,203,3.975609756097561
1518616,5,B00005JNC2,"Wow. This movie is probably one of my favorites. I hadn't seen trailers or reviews for it but had heard my friend talking about it. She said I should go see it and boy am I glad I did. I saw it and fell in love with it. I was about to see it again but they weren't showing it at my theater anymore. If you don't end up liking the movie (which is very hard to believe anyone not liking it) then the soundtrack alone is worth going to see it. Garden State has characters that you would know in your own life. Natalie Portman and Zach Braff play people that are so realistic that you feel like you are in the movie and hanging out with them. If you haven't seen this movie then see it. And if you have, then see it again.",1102550400,,718,3.9246575342465753
1518617,4,B00005JNC2,"I related to the film on a more personal note. This film showed me what its like to feel again. Its simple but also very complex, two concepts which are hard to balance. The film portrayed reality more vividly than anything I have seen in a while. I could relate to every character. The soundtrack is also amazing. The Shins avante garde compositions tie the film together.",1102377600,4,373,4.582089552238806
1518618,5,B00005JNC2,"I'll have to admit that for the first ten minutes or so of the film, the casual coarse language used by Largeman (Zach Braff)'s high school buddies seemed like a gratuitous and slightly strained reach toward ""hipness,"" in effort to appeal to a younger generation of moviegoers.  Blame this in part on my being on the other side of the generation gap.  But as I began to know the characters better, it dawned on me that this WAS the younger generation (at least a real part of its disenfranchised subculture, one of which I know very little) and offers an honest representation of the way they speak.

There is a tremendous heart to this film, characterized when Braff, Natalie Portman, and Peter Sarsgaard's characters both literally and metaphorically unleash a scream into the ""eternal abyss.""  Their pent-up frustration stems from the recognized irony that each of us is trapped in a world not of his own making with all of its seemingly irrational expectations and demands.  Though we may anesthetize ourselves from the sad truths behind our sustaining myth of self-determination, we risk blinding ourselves to the great redeeming aspect of our existance: the love of the people around us.

Natalie Portman as Largeman's girlfriend, Sam, is utterly luminous here.  Not to mention she made me fall in love.  I am embarassed to say I had to wait for the end credits to discover who this wonderful actress was (I have religiously avoided the obscenely over-merchandised Star Wars films of late and knew little of her adult work since her childhood debut in ""The Professional."")  Meryl Streep -- your spiritual daughter and future heir is growing up quite nicely.

The film's great heroic act belongs to Sarsgaard's character who leads Largeman and Sam on a bizarre odyssey through the small town's seamy underbelly in quest of an equally bizarre ""gift"" for Largeman.  His gift becomes an understated but moving act of redemption.  Redemption is what the film is about.  The fact that each of us posesses the power to in some way redeem one another is the movie's great hope.

I understand the squeamish who might balk at the R-rated language.  But the lesson here is that there can be redeeming qualities (and even shared values) among those who don't quite view the world through the same eyes.  Before you close yourself off from someone else's world that you don't understand, just stand there for a moment -- as on Boo Radley's porch -- and view the world from their shoes.  The universe soon begins to look a little different.  And a whole lot larger.  Don't miss this one.",1101772800,38,2579,4.83371298405467
1518619,5,B00005JNC2,"i went to this movie with absolutely no idea what it was other than a few friends telling me it was good. from the moment it started i was completly thrown back at the brilliance of the simplicity in this mans life. I was that kid who moved to Hollywood, and when i came back to my Jewish family, i met up with old friends, and everything dramatically changed. granted i didn't fall in love or have someone tell me ""you gotta hear this song, it will change your life i promise you!"" but it wasn't too far off. the honesty in this film and the pure brilliance of its deeper meaning underneath the simplistic outer layer is a DAMN good reason for you to not only see this movie, but heck, don't even bother previewing it, just buy it right off the bat. But don't come into this movie expecting ""jurassic park"" and then only getting ""the terminal"". when you do, you are just setting yourself up for disappointment no matter HOW good or bad the movie is. this movie will be as good for you as you WANT it to be. and it will relate to ANYONE, as much as anyone WANTS to relate to it. see this movie....

1518620,5,B00005JNC2,"Well, i was one of the few people i know that actually liked this movie, which is sad, because that suggests they are all to accustomed to their straight predictable storylines, sex and violence. What go me the hardest was the innocence amidst such tribulations, in a town he left a long time ago, he finds himself imediately immersed in serious things, but soon thereafter meets Sam (Portman) and through the movie you can see her innocence affecting him. and it all comes to culmination when they are about to go to the ""ark"". Large is so sure his friend is going to give him a present he is trying to get away from if you will.

Another of the best parts of the movie was in fact the lack of overexagerated sex scenes. They are unnecessary. There is real emotional developement to this. All the stages are there, they don't just hop in bed and immediately love each other...there isn't a person that can tell me that is always how it works in real life....this is a good, real depiction...

The screenplay was amazingly well-written, and the soundtrack is phenomenal -- probably the best 'song only' (as opposed to soundtracks with only musical score or a combination) soundtrack I've heard.

I think this is a movie that many people will feel a strong connection with and can relate to, because it portrays everyday events -- simple and complicated ones -- that can occur in anyone's life.  What makes this movie so wonderful is that these events are shown with such beauty and poignancy, you can't help but feel for the characters in the movie.  This is a movie that will make you smile, laugh, cry, and, at times, a viewer may be awe-struck by the creativity and vision that went into making this movie -- a superb directorial debut for Zach Braff!",1100908800,7,993,4.755813953488372

1518644,5,B00005JNC2,"I have always been a big Scrubs fan so I had to see this movie.  It did not disappoint me.  The movie was so good because it felt so real.  It was not stuck in the world of Hollywood where everything is perfect.  I do not want to give away the movie, but it really had a good take on life.  For example, in a touching part of the movie, Braff's character defines love as a Mother giving her sleeve for him to wipe his nose.  Additionally, the two main characters, Portman and Braff, both have flaws.  They truly love each other, but they love each because of and in spite of their flaws.  This simulates real life and real love in comparison to the type of love that Hollywood generally protrays.  Hollywood generally only shows us the bliss that people feel whe they are idealizing their mate.  Many romances that survive in movies would die in real life quickly, because once this bliss wears off there would be nothing left.  This movie was different because you felt Braff and Portman saw and acknowledged each other's flaws.  Great film and great accompanying soundtrack.",1100217600,8,1076,4.518134715025907

Keep in mind that this is the first movie of Braff as a screenwriter/director, so in general, you shouldn't come expecting a masterpiece.  State your opinion, but don't make it sound like a fact that the movie is brilliant.  As it happens, I agree, but my friend's grandmother walked out at one point (not sure which point though).  Please, for the sake of everyone's enjoyment and realistic expectations, don't build this up.  (BTW, I love the movie, Amelie, but hate hate hate the tagline, ""She'll change your life"".)

It's kind of hard to describe this movie. I think on the surface, and to someone who doesn't read between the lines, this would probably be considered a romantic comedy. Really though this movie is about making decisions to evolve your life for the better, going with your gut instincts, and learning that going back to the basics in life is where you will find happiness.

Really what makes this movie is the performance of Natalie Portman as the character Sam. She is very quirky, and this gives her a realistic personality that is easier to connect with. In all reality this movie is good solely because of her performance, and she kills it.

Coming from a guy who basically loathes most romantic comedies, I think this is a movie both men and women could enjoy. It has the love story aspect for the woman, and I think most guys will really enjoy Portman's performance. Opposed to a movie like 500 Days of Summer which is full of characters with no personality that feel fake and over complicated.

I would recommend this movie to most people with an open mind, that don't want the standard same old love story.",1521676800,,1258,4.533039647577093
