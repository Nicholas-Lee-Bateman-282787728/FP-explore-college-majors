5372203,5,B009YA9PVW,"The producers show how deadly toxic waste is being added to the drinking water of many English speaking countries and calling it Fluoride. It's sold under the idea that its good for your teeth, when it's not all. In fact, it's poison that causes everything from cancer to sexual problems and obesity. This film features an impressive line up of doctors and dentists. The toxic waste is causing many health problems including death. There's a segment that covers Phosphate mining, which is the main producer of these poisons.",1353196800,47,524,4.965909090909091
5372204,5,B009YA9PVW,"I could not wait to receive this.  I have heard about the dangers and toxicity of fluoride for years now but wanted to watch the documentary.  It is even more terrifying than I had thought before.  Very credible professionals speaking here, along with every-day citizens who have lost their health while working in the industry.",1400284800,4,328,4.927272727272728
5372205,5,B009YA9PVW,"I must admit I found the title and editorial review misleading and almost didn't watch it.  But I did watch it and found it to be a very good and recommended documentary about the negative side of fluoridation, a subject I have a fair bit of knowledge about.

In 1999 I knew nothing about fluoridation other than it was supposed to be good for you.  As a professional engineer for a major engineering firm, I was charged with designing the fluoridation system for the City of Las Vegas.  As I researched the design parameters, I found that there was a lot more to the story.  It is a ""very"" dangerous chemical with two very opposing viewpoints on its use in the drinking water supply.  I felt caught in the middle and then designed the safest system I could for both the operators and the public.

I continued to learn about both sides of fluoridation.  I followed the Flouride Action Network (fluoridealert.org/news/) for some years containing news from around the world and read a book on the detailed history of fluoridation titled ""The Fluoride Deception"" by Christopher Bryson.  I learned that it is a very complex issue, but as I learned more I became very opposed to its use.  I now drink distilled water whenever I live in a community that fluoridates water (the film stated that distilled water still has fluoride, but I think they may be incorrect on that).  For communities that don't fluoridate, I filter my water through Brita filters to remover other chemicals such as chlorine that are part of the treatment process, but are not good for a human body.

In closing, except for some minor items I find the film agrees with what I know about fluoridation.  I especially agree with the statement that fluoride will follow the way of lead but it will take some years. Perhaps the main item holding the true assessment of fluoridation back are the potential lawsuits if it were admitted that fluoride causes harm to the human body.",1384473600,15,1940,4.687315634218289
5372206,2,B009YA9PVW,"Fluoride may or may not be dangerous. Unfortunately, ""The Great Culling"" isn't an objective look at the problem, as can be seen from the wild claims that the dumbing down of America is caused by water fluoridation making IQ levels drop. The film further implies that the racist establishment might want to destroy the African-American community by putting fluoride in the water supply.

""The Great Culling"" is an ostensible documentary made by Paul Wittenberger, a conspiracy theorist who also gave us ""What in the world are they spraying"" (about so-called Chemtrails) and ""After the Tribulation"", an explicit religious fundamentalist film about the Anti-Christ, the Rapture and the Second Coming.

The real point of ""The Great Culling"" is that the government might be killing us through slowly poisoning our water supplies, or perhaps is planning to kill us in the future by contaminating the drinking water in more brisk fashion. The goal is to kill off most of the world's population. Apparently, a mysterious monument known as the Georgia Guidestones prove that the Illuminati want to reduce the Earth's population to 500 million, etc etc. Why most European governments (including those damned Swedish socialists) have stopped fluoridating the public water supplies seems to be a serious problem for this particular conspiracy scenario...

""The Great Culling"" might have a certain interest for those interested in the health issues surrounding fluoride (or who hated the Swedish ""fluoride lady"" as kids!), but due to its conspiracist-fundamentalist agenda, I can only give it two stars.",1378684800,6,1590,5.352
5372207,5,B009YA9PVW,"Very happy with purchase.  If you like documentaries, you will like this one. It makes you wonder what else are we being told that is harmful to us.",1377388800,5,148,4.285714285714286
5372208,5,B009YA9PVW,"This movie investigates the health consequences of water fluoridation.  Here is some quick facts supporting the movie: Sodium Fluoride Reacts With Acids To Form Hydrogen Fluoride Which Is Highly Corrosive And Poisonous. Keep Away From Strong Acids. (See ""60:60 RINSE: APF SOLUTION, PART A"")  Sodium fluoride 7 ppm reacts with stomach acids at 3 PH where half the fluoride ion morphs into hydrogen fluoride to form corrosive and toxic hydrofluoric acid (see Molecular mechanisms of fluoride toxicity)(Hydrogen fluoride 3 ppm Exposure limit per 29CFR 1926.55) We also get hydrofluoric acid from water fluoridation (See Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for Fluorosilicic Acid by Solvay Fluorides). Sodium fluoride, Fluorosilicic Acid, and Hydrofluoric Acid are severe poisons (Div 6.1) Poisonous material (Division 6.1) means a material, other than a gas, which is known to be so toxic to humans as to afford a hazard to health during transportation. Hydrofluoric acid is more toxic (See MSDS HYDROFLUORIC ACID Seastar Chemicals).  Hydrofluoric Acid corrodes steel faster than 0.2 in per year per USDOT Hazardous Materials Table 49CFR 172.101.  Fluoride supplement of 7 parts per million intended to be swallowed per 76 FR 2383.  In fact, it is slightly more toxic than lead and slightly less than arsenic. These two are only allowed to be present in tap water at 15 parts per billion and 10 parts per billion respectively (See EPA 816-F-09-0004), yet this poisonous solution is allowed at 7,000 parts per billion. Lethal Dose: Lead Acetate (450 mg/kg), Sodium Fluoride (52 mg/kg), Inorganic Arsenic (1 mg/kg/day). Some fluoride may be from China? See ""Chinese fluoride is a homeland security matter"" National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals does not contain exposure registries for fluorides.

5372210,5,B009YA9PVW,"Video contains a great deal of information on the subject of water poisions and pollutants.

8545203,5,B009YA9PVW,"Wow. Since 2010 I've mostly drank water that has been through a home reverse osmosis system  then remineralized to create high alkaline water. I already knew fluorIDE (Anagram of DIE - like pesticIDE, chlorIDE, homicIDE, infanticIDE, suicIDE, pesticIDE...) was bad, but this documentary puts it all together and then some. I never really thought much about the fluoride that is in the food I eat - now I am. Nor in beverages I drink, though other than water I've mostly cut those out anyway.  I've used fluoride free toothpaste for a long time now. Most recently, something called Earthpaste. A documentary called TAPPED you might find interesting. Also PLASTIC PLANET. This documentary reminds me to go upgrade my shower filter, which only does chlorine.

I enjoyed the director's testing of bottled water and common drinks. Those fluoride testers are pricey compared to pH and TDS testers.

I didn't care for the first 1 minute of the documentary where the director talks about the Georgia 10 Commandment stones, but after that, the documentary captivated me and held my attention. Comprehensive in scope of people interviewed and locations. Phosphate fertilizer mines in Florida was fascinating. The things we don't know.  Didn't know much about fluorosis, I do now. Didn't know much about the different sources of fluoride.

The title of the documentary would be better if it was just labeled with something more descriptive identifying it with fluoride or something more descriptive, rather then ""the great culling"" IMHO.  On another note, there is a certain irony with the author using closeup shots of his cell phone, for the EMF from cell towers, mobile phones and wi-fi is polluting our air.....but maybe the director will touch on that in the future.

You might also enjoy a book titled QUIET FREEDOM, which addresses the root cause of why we are collectively in this situation to begin with, a world where health takes a back seat.",1501200000,,1942,5.02803738317757

8545205,5,B009YA9PVW,"Just watched the documentary. Shame on America, our government, and unworthy elected officials. People we need 4 things to live/survive; 1)Water, 2) Food, 3) Air, and 4) Safety. This documentary proves that forces are working to ensure we US citizens don't have either. If we fail to successfully regain these areas, we (including future generations) will be TOO SICK (if not dead) to even defend our home, land, or country.

Just imaging, you're (USA) the #1 customer of China/Mexico TOXIC waste and you're loving every drop you consume, but your health doesn't. And due to genetic design, people of color consume 2 times more. This is another reason why ADD, Bipolar, Crime, and Incarceration (among other things) are so prevalent in communities of color.
