8383153,1,B002WIIOMO,"I'm a pretty serious fly fisher and I had high hopes for this video based on word of mouth from other anglers as well as Confluence's general reputation.  This video is basically a glorified commercial for fly fishing guides-without direct advertising.

Each place visited focuses very little on the fly fishing, and more of the stories behind the guides who dominate in those areas.  Be ready for a lot of talking about how great of an angler that these guides are, and how special their guide service and respective waters are--but if you want to see people FISHING and catching fish probably choose another DVD.

For me, I passionately hate guides.  They aren't bad people, everyone needs to make a living and you should do what you love, but the price of guided fly fishing is so outrageous their is just no way to justify it, and this video is basically the priciest of the pricey guides talking about all their great stories and how lucky they are.  To me, even if I didn't dislike the idea of guided fly fishing, this is just a turn off..a mood killer..  a downer..  After awhile you aren't even thinking about fly fishing, your just thinking about getting to the next part of the DVD and hoping its better than the current part.

Sorry Confluence, but this DVD wasn't made for fly fishers or the fly fishing community--it was made for guides.  Spend your money on another DVD like Metalheads or Eastern Rises.",1365120000,6,1417,4.632
8383154,4,B002WIIOMO,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It takes the viewer along on journeys to places must of us would love to fish, and it's masterfully filmed and edited. The single most intriguing segment was the one about the hatch of palolo worms that occurs briefly once a year and turns on the tarpon in the Florida Keys. Each of the other five segments is compelling in its own way as well: aggressive bonefish in Venezuela, trout on Henry's Fork in Idaho, big rainbows in Alaska, redfish in post-Katrina New Orleans and sea-run brown trout in Patagonia. The variety is nice and the personalities of the fishermen and guides--and their stories--are interesting enough, though there isn't a narrative thread, really, tying all these stories together. Lots to dream about here.",1325808000,,773,4.908396946564886
8383155,4,B002WIIOMO,"...this was still a good movie.  Lots of amazing destinations and good photography, with enough story to tie it all together.  I would still recommend watching it.",1315267200,,163,5.0
8383156,4,B002WIIOMO,"I really enjoyed Rise.  It's not quite as good as Confluence Film's first video, ""Drift"", but it's still enjoyable.  The Florida tarpon fishing was the best part.",1267142400,2,162,4.962962962962963
