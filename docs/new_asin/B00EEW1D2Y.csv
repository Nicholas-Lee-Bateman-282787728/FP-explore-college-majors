5910582,5,B00EEW1D2Y,Julia Roberts has been in a league of her of her own for a vey long time and I thought I owned all of her movies. This was not only a great DVD collection; it's simply has some of the movies that I missed. Its a very cute collection of a superstar woman that continues to be just herself and a hell of an actress as well. I think this collecion finishes out my current collection and will await for the newest releases to come forth so I don't miss a beat!,1403654400,5,456,3.967391304347826

5910585,5,B00EEW1D2Y,"Because I like all 4 movies, but Larry Crowne was my favorite in all of the aspects. Show people that age doesn't mean that you are dying, or can go back to school to get a better education or find another love. I love  to see Tom + Julia together.",1393891200,2,248,3.96

5910587,3,B00EEW1D2Y,"These weren't Julia Roberts best movies,  but Notting Hill is the best.

Larry Crowne was okay,  but Julia Roberts was in a bad mood most of the time.
Tom Hanks played a likable character.

I did not like Duplicity. Too much trying to figure out what was going
on and too much fighting between them to make it an enjoyable movie.

Charlie Wilson's War was good,  but not one you want to see more than
once.",1382659200,4,406,4.276315789473684

5910613,3,B00EEW1D2Y,"My husband and I had seen ""Notting Hill"" in the theatres and maybe once on TV before I purchased this 4-in-one.  We like the movie, but think it's a bit unrealistic as a story.  However, it's entertaining.  Hugh Grant is Hugh Grant, with his special forehead-emphasized tousled hair and his eye expressions.  That's worth a star right there.  ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is a really good movie, well produced and fast paced.  We should have used ""closed captions"" right off the bat because Philip Seymour Hoffman's dialogue is so rapid-fire, we older folks with aging ears needed a ""slow-up button.""  ""Duplicity"" was fair and kind of nutty.  Julia Roberts is versatile and her acting in that role is believable, even when she is mean.  We haven't watched ""Larry Crowne"" yet, because I saw it on TV and got a little bored.  Maybe we'll watch it on the 4-in-1 soon.",1420934400,5,858,4.736486486486487
5910614,3,B00EEW1D2Y,A generally pleasant collection; Charlie Wilson's War being edgier (thanks to Phillip Seymour Hoffman) than the others.,1420675200,,119,6.0588235294117645

I actually bought this for my mother for Christmas ... so Shhhh... I'd rather not ruin the surprise. We watch Knotting Hill together every year when I visit.
