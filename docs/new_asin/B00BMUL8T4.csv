5652881,4,B00BMUL8T4,"The Cleaver's is just a fun movie. It show about the family dynamics of the Cleaver's in a realistic & fun way. The Cleaver' s grandmother is the star of the movie, their are no words to describe her. I would suggest that you purchase this movie if you just want to laugh alot.",1410134400,,277,4.148148148148148
5652882,3,B00BMUL8T4,"Everyone in the movie played their part well and the grandmother could have stolen the show if her mouth was not so foul.  She was obnoxious and certainly NOT funny or cute, and ruined, somewhat, an otherwise nice family movie.  From the gay sister, to younger brother Will, to James and his wife Stacey, to James' brothers, George and very likeable, Harry, Uncle Nipsy and his air-head girlfriend, Sunshine, etc.-They were all likeable and helped make the movie interesting.  But as for the grandmother, Bobo the dog beat her out.  Minus granny, I would have given this movie 4-4.5 stars.",1388793600,3,589,4.86

8571076,1,B00BMUL8T4,"You didn't have a rating for ""trash,"" therefore, I gave the rating of ""I hated it.""  It was totally a disgrace.  When are you going to wake up and see that saying the ""N"" word  that is meant to keep you and the next generations to come in their place on bondage.  The ""N"" word is to program you to think that you are less than a dog, you will never amount to anything, you will never be anything, tell me how can that be funny to a race of people.  It is a disgrace because you are keeping a word alive that another race of people created for you to remind you that no matter what degrees you may obtain that you have worked hard to earn or the positions of power that you have worked so hard to earn, it means absolutely nothing in this world.  When are you going to wake up and stop promoting negativity in the African American race.  Using the ""N"" work is not entertaining when you equate that to many African American men, women, and children, use children have lost their lives because their lives were not significant, and yes you are promoting and support that mindset.  How can allow another race write a story for you when they have not lived it or know anything about the struggle.  When you let another race write for you, you will see the ""N"" word used because that's what they think of you.  Grandmothers do not talk to their children in that manner.  Grandmothers speak life into their children because Grandmothers and Grandfathers are the foundation of the family.  Please do not get involved with any other ""trash"" movie that does not make the African American race proud.  If you want to write a good family reunion that has a message, please be an under study of the Johnson Family Reunion (1st class all the way).",1447718400,,1733,4.361370716510903
