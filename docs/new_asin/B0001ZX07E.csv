You can have some fun with the title when you give/loan it to others, but otherwise it is a clean program referring to the Strip District of Pittsburgh - which is not the ""Red Light"" district.  Warning - have food ready because it can also make you hungry!",1458000000,,334,4.459016393442623

8019227,5,B0001ZX07E,"I live 45 minutes from Pittsburgh and I'm a family and consumer science teacher. I use this movie in my country living class to highligh what our area has to offer as far as food and local business. A great movie about family values, entreprenuership, and local history!",1347235200,,270,4.645833333333333
8019228,4,B0001ZX07E,"The Strip Show refers to a current and historical district in Pittsburgh. At one time, my grandfather ran a wholesale grocery down on the Strip. There are elements of this documentary that are very interesting and entertaining even if you are not from Pittsburgh. At other times, it really slows down and seems more like a long commercial or a public relations piece. Because the history of the Strip is tied closely to food, the documentary should be engaging to those who enjoy the many food related programs on cable these days.",1254096000,3,531,4.782608695652174
