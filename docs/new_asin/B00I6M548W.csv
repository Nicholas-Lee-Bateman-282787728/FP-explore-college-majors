If you enjoy it, consider buying Amazon's Audible course on Wagner and his music, and learn a great deal more than you can from the movie.",1472083200,,273,4.372549019607843
8639605,2,B00I6M548W,"It was disappointed about the quality Wagner epic series, during the view I have seen imperfections and many artifacts, you should remaster these masterpieces. Anyhow I am ready to purchase other DVD on Wagner, before that I would like to ask you if it would be possible to exchange the Spanish version  with the English version with Italian subtitles?Another question is :do you have an Italian version?After all the Maestro lived in Italy for a such long time and died in Venice one of his favorite town.
