2247846,4,B0007XBN38,I don't think i watched the same movie all these bad reviewers watched!?! The movie i just watched was way too good to be the same movie getting these ronchy & VERY uncalled for reviews. SHALLOW GROUND boils the slasher genre together with the supernatural genre & the result is a excellent new horror film  with plenty of jolts & tingles & buckets O blood! I'M SHOCKED BY THE HARSH REVIEWS! the movie i watched was a breath of fresh air!,1123372800,,438,4.407407407407407

Where did they get the director for this movie, from the drive thru at McDonalds? Honestly, I have seen many horror movies in my days - some good, some not-so-good, but few as bad as Shallow Ground. The movie tries too hard to be dramatic with everything other than the story.

There are many parts in this movie that are so ridiculous that you would rather burn the movie than return it to the video store and let someone else be tortured by it. For example:

When it begins getting dark, we see the sheriff in a cabin loading a shotgun. Very loudly, we hear the wind heavily whistling outside. The wind even blows out the sheriff's lantern when he goes outside. But, and a big but, when the sheriff does go outside we still hear the loud wind but nothing is moving! Nothing! All the trees are perfectly still. There are a few frames in particular where some hanging tree branches are in frame and they are as still as a corpse is dead.

You would be better off saving the money you were about to spend on this movie and purchasing sewing needles and sticking them into your eyeballs because it would be more entertaining than watching Shallow Ground.

And next time you go through McDonalds, be extra nice to the drive thru employees because they probably took part in making this film.",1123200000,8,1339,4.493827160493828
2247848,3,B0007XBN38,"That was what I was thinking about at the end of the credits. I hate it when I feel in the middle of a movie, c.d., book, etc. It's a very rare thing for me to be in the middle of a horror movie, yet this movie did in fact leave me left in the middle. This movie was not terrible, nor was it great.

All you see in this movie really is blood, blood, and more blood, usually coming from this naked boy who just sits there staring at nothing. Yet, sitting there watching this naked, bleeding boy leaves you endlessly curious about what he truly is- a spirit, a real boy- what? You wonder what is also going to happen to the dull- ish actors that are centered around this bleeding mystery.

The actors are truly a bore mainly, there are no real stand- out characters in this movie but the sheriff, the naked bleeding boy and finally the antagonist at the end. The others I think were just filler, you find yourself not caring about the others too much. Then the nudity in the film could have easily have been cut out but the director decided for some reason it had to be shown. I could have lived without it honestly. I hate how I have to see so much unnecessary nudity in horror films, but at least it's not overdone in this film like in so many others.

Then the ending just never seemed to come. I don't know if others felt that way, but I did feel like the ending stretched out way too long. They put a few things in the film that made me think they should have been in the deleted scenes pile, and thanks to a few of those unnecessary scenes, there was not enough time really for the final enemy in the end of the film to explain why they did what they did. So you only get a short explanation, which leaves you pushing the rewind button. Then the ending itself was a little strange, an ending that leaves you a bit confused and makes you wonder why they wrote it like that, when they could have done it one or two others ways possibly. Yet the ending for sure is creative, and finally one horror movie that was not predictable. I certainly did not predict the ending that happened. It may have been a bit of a confusing ending, but creative and different, nonetheless.

So through the sifting of the negatives and the positives, I found myself not saying 'stinks' or excellent'. Just 'okay'. It's an okay horror film, worth checking out once at least.",1122768000,2,2354,4.259507829977629

2247850,3,B0007XBN38,"A low budget horror film (less than $100,000) which manages to succeed on at least one unique level (the bloody boy character) but also borrows liberally from other classic horror flicks like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (dinner with corpses)and Scream (murdering black hooded figure/dead woman hung from tree).  The acting was pretty blah and certain concepts were stretched a bit (the ""identity"" of the bloody boy), but I'd recommend this for a rental over most other straight to dvd horror.",1121212800,8,488,5.177215189873418

It is a horror movie made to be a horror movie it serious and does not have all this humor like horror these days does, which is fine but i still do love a good scary serious flick. This movie is not really scary but bloody and gory and interesting. Its a straight to dvd  flcik so the acting is good but not great which is given it is a b-movie. Long story short i brought this the day it came out with out ever seeing it or reading reviews. All i read was some 3 or 4 page article in fangoria's magazine.  It cost $17.00 in best buy and I have no complaints a very cool flick to have very original I cant think of anything similar, maybe rent first  to see for your self.

2247852,5,B0007XBN38,"First off I would like to say this movie was the scariest movie I've seen since the Exorcist, Yes its been a while. I loved just about everything in this movie. I thought the acting was great and the story plot was a breath of fresh air, especially from all the past scary movies i've seen. If your whining about the budget of this film or the ""handfull of characters"" then just go back to your usual boring horror movies with all the rappers and singers attempting to be actors and actresses. Sure it wasn't difficult to figure out who the killer was, but that wasn't even the main part of the movie and quite honestly i never understood what was so fun about sitting through a movie thinking about who the killer was the whole time. Your reading the wrong reviews if the rating is under 5 stars. This movie was very good and really does have a kick ass ending. I don't think the movie goes overbored on the blood and gore at all, and the fact that the boy covered in blood is very unpredictable will honestly scare the hell out of you. That dude had me guessin through the whole movie. Go ahead and buy this movie i promise you'll like the change.",1121040000,5,1149,4.299539170506913
2247853,2,B0007XBN38,"This is about a small town that has just completed building a damn and so the 4 cops of the town are packing up and moving away. But they have to stay because a boy has been found covered in blood and weird things start happening.

The story bored me for most of the movie. It took about 50 mins for the plot to thicken and kick in and then it doesn't pay off well in the end. It's a low budget independent film which I usually support, but this one just left questions un-answered and dumb twists and turns. There is only a handful of characters in this film, and you can easily pick up on who the killer is.

It's not original, it's not scary, it's not horror, it's not a thriller. It's a movie where you sit there waiting for things to unfold and are highly un-impressed with the outcome. A bloody boy and his unrelated to the end plot interrogation looks like it plays a part for the film, but at the end it doesn't tie in together. People telling them not to touch the boy makes no sense other then, ""let me kill them, I'll show you why.... even tho i'm dead and you cant kill me""

2247854,4,B0007XBN38,"In the past few years big studios have destroyed true horror, with a few exceptions (the ring, the grudge and a few more) but most of them are rubbish. I have always been a low budget horror fan but this movie seemed to take me back to the early 80's when horror really scared you. There are disturbing images, plenty of blood and bare breasted hotties, have the big studios become too politically correct, I think so. I am not saying you have to have naked chicks to make a good horror film, but if done right and in the right situation it can add to the despair and horror of the viewer. If you liked Evil Dead and Friday the 13th than this movie is right up your alley. It has the same eerie, desperate feel of an early 80's horror film. I was also very pleased with the acting.

Splashing buckets of blood on the floor and on a naked boy who walks throughout the entire film with creepy crawling bugs  DOES NOT MAKE IT A HORROR MOVIE . 45 mins into this film i seemed to have lost a bit of interestsbut i was hoping for a tragic ending or even something out of the ordinary but sadly i was not impressed. The movie doesnt seem to go anywhere but under ground.  97 mins was long enough some of the acting was below standard acting  and the story line itself had potential but failed by not giving a full detail ending.  worth a rent but do not expect much at all",1120003200,6,767,4.305555555555555

This indie horror started of strong with buckets of corn syrup in the credits alone!

The story itself does jump around a bit in the beginning and might cause confusion, but not enough to pull one's attention from the film. After the weird jumping around in the beginning the story pulls itself together nicely and is freshly original, and did well not telegraph the ending.

Editing was great and I found no awkward cuts in the film. The movies score did an excellent job setting up the mood of the film. Also I found the films grading was excellent and seemingly done with a just subtle black. On the special effects side of the house the feature contained a nice blend of real world effects with digital ones which reminded of something you would see from Eli Roth.

My recommendation; If you dig the horror genre give this one a watch.",1420502400,,854,4.568627450980392

We find out near the very end the reason for the killings and have a better understanding of the characters. After watching this movie again, I now have a better understanding of the who's, why's and how's of what it's all about. Maybe I was just not in the mood for this movie the first time or was just to tired to really pay close attention to it, but it did make more sense the second time around. There are several continuity issues that plague this movie and the use of sound effects/music is also ill timed/placed and cause more harm than good to a given scene. The movie does have a few eerie scenes and its story is decent and somewhat of a compilation of other movies in this genre that will be recognizable to many. I just wasn't able to get past all the issues with this movie including its somewhat disjointed storyline to enjoy it. You may recognize the lead actor Jack Sheppard (Timothy V.

This one gets right down to the nitty gritty. There is lots of blood and not a lot of time wasted on silly and often formulaic plots. Yet an atmosphere of suspense. I would give it one star for ME personally as entertainment. But my sense is that horror fans might like it because it is kind of different. Just relentless immersion in blood and weirdness -- no hockey masks or teenagers on camping trips or who gets killed first, second, third, etc. Kind of minimalist!!

So my three stars are sort of for a technical accomplishment that maybe SOME horror film fans might appreciate. It is sort of like a relentless and disgusting bad dream not held up by a clear plot (there is actually a sort of plot, but it is not the point and can be done without).

 In SOME ways it reminds me of some of the David Decoteau low-budget films that just kill people off sort of randomly, with ""thin"" plots, though of course without all the shirtless young men. He seems to have a sort of minimalist vision that sometimes works better than others.  Shirtless guys are HIS novelty, but the novelty value in this film seems to be mostly the blood covered kid that appears right at the opening of the film and just keeps appearing and disappearing along with the creepy sound effects. Different. What can you do with a camera and only a few dollars? Low budget film makers quite fascinate me no mater what genre they are working in. Sometimes they really put a lot into their films and get a lot out, but of course sometimes they quite flop.

I suspect that within the genre (and again I am not that familiar with it) they are TRYING to do something different and interesting for their target audience. That has to count for something!! This is one of the most interesting horror films I have sat through, ""technically"" so to speak, though pretty darned disgusting.",1357516800,,1934,4.4491525423728815

This movie is not your typical independent B zombie movie.  Well actually, it seems that every zombie movie uses dense woods as a setting, and this movie is no exception.  What separates this from other zombie movies is the unique story and plot.  Basically what it comes down to is that murder victims across the world are rising up and seeking to find their killers with the intention of killing them in revenge.  The movie is quite gorey and twisted.  The special effects are pretty impressive considering this movie's budget was a whopping $78,000.  The acting is pretty good overall.  There is a lot of nudity.  The music throughout the movie is pretty decent.  This is a rare B zombie movie that actually has some substance to it, rather than it being a mindless attempt to scare the audience, like so many B zombie movies are.  The camerawork is good and normal.  What I mean by normal is that the camera doesn't shake intentionally like it does in the B zombie movie Severed - Forest Of The Dead, for example.

Although this movie starts out promisingly, it taxes the patience of the viewer and never pays off.  The frustrations are of two types:  1) nobody in the movie can figure out what's going on, and 2) neither can the the viewer.  Why did the naked boy walk into the police station oozing blood from every pore?  Dunno.  Why do people become homicidal and/or extremely stupid when they touch said blood?  Search me.  But surely, the frenzied activity on the screen will result in everything being resolved, right?  Surely, the two naked women strung up from tree limbs will not have suffered without explanation, right?  Not on your life.  And just when you think the agony of watching terrible acting and baffling behavior has come to an end, the movie finishes with a scene from out of nowhere.  Reminds me of another horror movie with a perplexing ending...the viewer was rewarded with a fade-out of a cemetery caretaker looking into the camera and laughing his @#$ off.  Well, it's not funny.  If you waste time or money on this, the joke is on you. The only things that prompted me to give it two stars (instead of one) are the vividly photographed scenery and, for once, some realistic-looking blood.

Surprise surprise, the director refused to explain it, saying only that he was amused the audience was baffled by it.

I realize it makes absolutely no sense and doesn't tie in to anything that's happened in my movie before.

It feels like a callback to classic horror, from the hundreds of gallons of blood, to the rural forest setting.

theres about 8 different storylines going on throughout the movie and you might lose track of some of the subplots as things go on. it might have been trying to say too much at times, but things always stay interesting. basically its the story of a backwoods slayer capturing and torturing those unfortunate enough to wander alone, but there are also strong super natural elements at work. to reveal to much about that here would ruin a lot of the fun to be had with the movie. ill just say it was all very well done (never cheesy or campy), although some of it could've been explained a little better.

With the small budget, this movie made money irrelevant with some damn-near brilliant cuts and directorial choices that kept the movie from being cheesy at any point.

2247917,4,B0007XBN38,"Shallow Ground (Sheldon Wilson, 2004)

It sometimes pains me to pick up straight-to-DVD horror releases. Not because they suck-- though, assuredly, most of them do-- but because I inevitably compare something like Shallow Ground (or the more recent Deadbirds) to (a) the complete unwatchable trash that shows up as ""Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies"" and (b) the complete only-slightly-more-watchable crap that's coming out in theaters under the horror banner. I can't begin to tell you how much more Shallow Ground deserved to be on a big screen than did the recent Hills Have Eyes or Dark Water remakes or, Jehosephat help us, Haute Tension. Yeah, it's got its problems, but when you put it up against any of the three other films mentioned, or scores of others, it's Oscar material.

The plot: a small town, made into a boomtown by an influx of temporary workers building a dam, is deflating again after the dam is finished. Sherriff Jack Sheppard (Skeleton Man's Timothy Murphy), his deputies Stuart (character actor Stan Kirsch) and Laura (Lindsey Stoddart, whose biggest role until now has been a minor part in The Ring), and town paramedic Darby Owens (Scab's Natalie Avital) are all getting ready to go their separate ways when a stranger wanders into town, naked and covered in blood. Suddenly, there's a reason to hang around town, especially when Jack starts to suspect that to silent man killed Amy Underhill (Tara Killian, of American Pie Presents Band Camp), whose murder still haunts him. The truth, however, is a whole lot weirder...

The script could have used a good rewrite or two for the purpose of patching up holes and doing a bit more character development. This, however, is true of a lot of microbudget movies, and we can't really give points off for it here any more than we did for El Mariachi. Besides, lack of character development is pretty much a staple in horror films, no? I can't help but think, though, this one's got enough stubs from which real characters could grow to make a rewrite (and a remake, preferably with the same connections) worthwhile, in the same way El Mariachi grew into Desperado. But if you look past the script's shortcomings and a relatively silly final scene, this is a fantastic little shocker-- well thought out, with enough plot twists to keep you looking like you're trying to follow Wimbledon, some decent acting (coupled with some scream queen action, but again, in a horror flick that's kind of forgivable), and a good deal of convention-flaunting.

I liked this movie a whole bunch, and I hope it ends up getting the attention it deserves. It's the kind of fresh, new horror film that Hollywood needs to understand is what's going to hook a new generation. Cranking out crappy remakes of good films is going to do nothing more than inspire contempt and desensitization. *** ",1151452800,15,2838,4.891891891891892
2247918,4,B0007XBN38,"Like others, I found this on the Sci-Fi channel today and decided to give it a chance. Though I recognized two actors, the cast is full of unknowns. And I learned that this is a low budget, direct to video movie.

This movie is filled with suspense and blood, rivers of blood. And the score to the movie is perfect and enhances the eerie feeling. And the movies creepiness value just builds. It took me longer then most movies to solve what was going on and who was who, but I like that. It makes you wonder why this movie was low budget when it is better then most recent horror films.

2247919,4,B0007XBN38,"This low budget shocker may not always make sense throughout it's running time, but for the most part, Shallow Ground is a surprisingly inventive indie horror flick that is worth checking out.  Timothy V. Murphy stars as a burned out sheriff called back into action when a naked boy (Rocky Marquette) covered in blood wanders into the police department in a quaint town.  The boy has some sort of supernatural powers and a connection to the mysterious killings of recent people, and as Murphy and his deputies (Lindsey Stoddart and Highlander: The Series' Stan Kirsch) soon learn, some things should remain buried.  For a low budget film of this type, Shallow Ground manages to avoid many of the cliches of the genre, and the cast is surprisingly decent throughout as well.  The story is inventive and the gore effects are nicely done, even though the final frame of the film could have been done without.  Despite that, Shallow Ground is worth seeing for horror fans, and it's certainly better than any theatrical PG-13 horror movie has ever been in the last few years.",1147651200,5,1070,4.825136612021858
2247920,5,B0007XBN38,"I saw this just last night on Sci-fi channel, and was quite pleased. There's lots of gore to keep a horror fan (like me) satisfied. It's original, scary, gorey *drools with rememberence of gore in movie*, unpredictable, etc, and you'll probably like it. (I don't remember any of the character's names, so I'm just going to call them by appearence) Probably the goriest scene is when the boy covered in blood pushes his fist right through the old woman's throat, which causes her to collapse on herslelf. Apparently, ever since this woman lost her husband and daughter, she's ""gotten revenge"" on the people in this city, and has shot them and butchered them. Then, she takes their corpses into a secret room in her home and puts them into a lving room and makes it look like they're having conversation and whatnot. This teen - formed by the blood of those people - kills her in return for her sins. Then, a cop (who turns out to be the main character) and a local (whose daughter lost her life to the old woman) bury her corpse in, well, shallow ground, and drive back to the local area. It ends with the gorey kid staring at the car, and he walks off...

..But there's more. As he walks off into the forest (should I spoil the end for you? Ehh, why not), a pitch black being covered in blood with thick white eyes and pointy devil ears, gritting its teeth, comes out from behind a bush and jams it's fist right through the kid! He falls with a thud. Then, this new creature, looks around, pondering what its next move would be. And, as I would imagine, it decides to head back to where it all started!!!!

Who that being is supposed to be, I don't know. It may be the old woman, or maybe one of the cops that was killed. Or maybe it's a combination of all the people who were killed by the bloody beings bakc in a new form, wanting revenge on these people (!). Whatever. Overall, I think Sheldon Wilson did a pretty good job directing it, and the acting is also pretty good. Watch it! Rent it or something. Actually, I have seen a little bit of this movie before, but never had the chance to see the whole thing. Thankfully, Sci-fi played it again.

This one delivers nicely. Spooky, heart-hammering music in all the right places, fleeting glimpses of some *thing*, and for the most part the plot leaves you guessing 'til nearly the end. I'd figured out some of it, but not exactly the why, and I like that. Most movies these days you figure out in the first 15 minutes or so and what's the fun in that?

The reason Shallow Ground gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the unnecessary goriness of it. Blood I can handle - and BOY was there a lot of it - but fishhooks and hands punching through bodies (slowly) just didn't need to be seen. To me, something half-seen or only heard is much scarier.

The special effects were beyond special; they captured real artistry at birth. The music score was more than fitting for this film as if they had viewed the film then scored it. The title of the film caught me by surprise; I am as dense as dense gets. The director must be mentally challenged and this film was his therapy; quite exceptional attention paid to details.

The plot basic is what horrorfies and terrifies. According to religion sins were bought and paid for by the Son of God and there will be no paying for sins if forgiveness is asked and of course it is given. Not in this movie! The dead who were murdered are given the opportunity to exact revenge on those living who murdered them but through one blood covered naked boy. One character surprises me and might have you saying: okay what the hell?

I enjoyed the film in all of its aspects. It is worth the purchase after the rent and I would love to see this film in novel form or get a hold of the script because clever as it may seem; you look for explanation in the dvd extras forcing you to overhaul the whole creation.

The blood of the dead form a type of humunculous to enact revenge against the people who took their lives. This is not a completely original concept in term of world religion/mythology; but it is an interesting idea for a horror film. I could cite examples but that would take too much time. I actually liked this film quite a bit more than I thought I would. I don't like movies that I can figure out in the first 5 minutes, (this one took about 15)... As far as being a low-budget/indie pic, it holds up a lot better with most of the recent hollywood remake/regurgitations. I like the soundtrack as well, the music was creepy and atmospheric, a bit overwrought but then again, what big-budget flick in recent memory hasn't used ""jump music"" every time a character turns around or a cat farts?

One reviewer said something about just creating an eerie atmosphere, okay, that is what attracted me to watch this little gem. The atmosphere is truly ambrosiac, and like some of the other positive reviewers have noted, he does it during the DAY. While most horror films rely on the dark, this one pulls it off during the day. One other thing that that was nice was to see Stan Kirsch in another role, I missed him from his years in Highlander, and John Kapelos was awesome as Schanke in Forever Knight, these genre shows gave the actors some great experience to pull this film off. Now everyone has an opinion, and mine is now more or less important than anyone elses, but I would be so bold as to compare this director to the work of Lucio Fulci, it is gutsy, gorey, and does provide some chills. Most movies I watch provide some catharsis from an active day of work, but don't really make you think. This film really makes you think, yeah it could have been the somewhat confusing plotlines, but so was JU-ON, and that movie was great. I really recommend watching this film at least once.

While some of the elements were cliched and unexplained, the actual concept was fairly new and fresh for the genre. There are a few interesting twists to the movie, and the use of the dead as a heroic rather than threatening force is a fairly underused element in the genre. A lot of the actors are unknowns and fairly new in their carrears, but held their own. What it lacked in great actors, it made of for with tons of atmosphere.

I am tired of ""horror"" movies trying to be all that by 1) blatantly ripping off other horror movies 2) throwing in creepy effects that make no sense and 3) having horrible scripts. In order to prove my point, here are some spoilers (don't continue reading if you want to actually waste time watching this movie)

- Throw in a deranged old lady who decides to hack everyone up because her husband and daughter are killed because of the construction of a dam from the ""outsiders"" who come into their area? What the hell? There is no story build up to really set up this character going so off the deep end that she needs to go around killing everyone and everything that may have been an ""enemy to her"". Not to mention she also kills the friends of her daughter? I saw shades of Jason's mom (from Friday the 13th) and Happy Birthday to Me in the set up of this character--not very original, and not at all that cohesive.

- Moronic supernatural elements. OK. We have the crazy old lady who hacks everyone up, then this whole subplot of the dead coming back for revenge. We basically have two stories going on here. The old lady seeking revenge and THEN supposedly the dead coming back to haunt their killers to seek justice. It is supposedly going on ""everywhere"" (based on the comment by one of the characters). The plot makes no sense. We got these events going everywhere? There is no explaination. No explaination why the boy covered in blood supposedly looks like a combination of all the people the old lady killed is yet more confusing, but the Junkie the crooked cop shot earlier in his career comes back looking just like himself. Why not have ALL the people the old lady killed come back? How the hell did they supernaturally come to look like one? What for? Why the nonsense? What? Did they all copulate with one another??

- Scary effects for no purpose. We got the old lady hanging and hooking people up with chains and hooks (Texas Chainsaw, Hellraiser, I Know What You Did Last Summer anyone?) putting them all around dinner tables in her house (Happy Birthday to Me anyone?). We got blood flowing and oozing everywhere with a mind of its own (Can't recall what horror flick this was ripped off from, but there is one out there), and creepy spiders and other assorted nonsense crawling on people just, well, just because it looks creepy. Not that it makes sense. Not that it serves a purpose in the context of what is going on.

I could go on but honestly, this movie is a real bad rip off of all things Horror. Man, if you are going to make a horror film, it takes more than buckets of fake blood and cutting and pasting together plots and ideas from other movies.

2247941,4,B0007XBN38,"SHALLOW GROUND is an independent shocker heavy in atmospheric chills with a complex if ultimately confusing storyline.  Featuring a rather talented cast of unknown actors (with the exception of Patty McCormack, best known for her role as the demonic child in the original BAD SEED), the movie accomplishes some frightening scenes in broad daylight, which is an accomplishment in itself, and some gory scenes of mutilation and terror.  It ultimately is a tale of the dead getting revenge on a murderer who has been making people disappear, with some additional plotlines that somehow tie in.  While the movie never totally explains itself, it does manage to offer some originality and some subtle horror in its delivery.  Its ending is rather ambiguous and hurried, but SHALLOW GROUND is better than many of the horror movies we've been saturated with lately.",1125360000,14,858,5.151079136690647
2247942,2,B0007XBN38,"In the DVD Special Features, it is revealed that this movie was made for only $70,000. With that in mind, the cinematography, music, acting, cast (including some experienced actors), and special effects were much better than expected. The one missing feature was a coherent plot. This is strange, because screenplay is generally the least expensive element of a movie like this, and should not have been shortchanged. If you can get the Budapest Symphony Orchestra to provide the background music (as they miraculously did), surely you can find someone who could write a story that makes sense.

There were some shocking, scary scenes and some suspense, but no real payoff. I watched very closely, and I still have not resolved many loose ends regarding who did what to whom....and how or why they did it. If the villain is indeed who they seemed to be, they simply would not possess the strength or stamina to commit the atrocities depicted. Also, the ""surprise ending"" creates more questions than answers about what was happening. I think it was simply tacked on for shock value rather than any coherent addition to the plot.

The confusing nature of the plot was definitely not due to a clever, intricate screenplay and skillful direction, such as in ""Memento"" or ""The Jacket"", in which you have to watch very carefully to catch each clue....instead, I think it was simply a result of amateurish editing and an inability to see the story as a whole. I fault the writer/director. Despite the limited budget, he obviously had all the necessary resources to make an excellent independent film, and he dropped the ball by focusing on small details (such as the way that blood flowed on the floor), rather than telling a good story. There were individual, shocking events, but they did not flow together coherently.

For all the reasons stated, and many that were omitted due to space, I suggest that if you absolutely must view this movie, rent the DVD and do not buy it....I can assure you that one viewing is more than enough.",1124668800,5,2027,4.835734870317003
2247943,3,B0007XBN38,"Reading the front and back cover, all these reviewers said this film was basically a bloody and good horrow film. This film was probably one of the better straight-to-DVD horror films I enjoyed watching.

Now her and his deputies must figure out where the boy came from & what to do with him. The officers seem uncommonly nonchalant given the situations in the film, a small quibble perhaps, but I found that it took me out of the film. Willing to plow on because I found the story intriguing in some small way And it turned out to be a suitable enough time-waster, nothing great, but the ending was really, really bad and the writer/ director dropped the ball on that one.",1517270400,,679,4.573770491803279
