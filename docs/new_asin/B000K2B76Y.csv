I did notice that there was some ""fluff"" added to give length to the video, like, I did not want to pay to watch Buck lope circles to lame music.  Not what I was hoping for.",1390780800,,250,4.1020408163265305

Hackamore DVD

Buck explains what the hackamore is and how its size is determined.  He also gives very clear instructions on how to tie your mecate and reins to the bosal and how to adjust it so that it fits your horse correctly.  And he shows you how to shape your bosal (A note of caution:  Buck uses a shaping block on his bosal, but if you use a shaping block you will want to be careful not to pound it down too hard.  The only thing holding your bosal together is the heel knot.  You can break this pretty quickly if you overdo it with the shaping block and then you're out of a two or three hundred dollar bosal.)  Buck uses a mane hair mecate in this video.  If you've never used one of these, I would highly recommend it.  They have a different feel than a cotton rope that I can't quite explain.  If you want a really nice mane hair mecate, you might want to check out Sara Hagel's web site.  She makes them herself and each one is a work of art.

Buck explains some basic maneuvers that you will want to do, some of the pitfalls that you might encounter and what to do when those things happen.  He demonstrates several different exercises, such as hind quarters to the left/ front quarters to the right with a leading and supporting rein; exercises at the walk, trot and canter while maintaining a soft feel; haunches in; smooth transitions between gaits both upward and downward; two tracking; spins; exercises at the lope, such as spirals, or loping short circles (I've found that his particular exercise helps a lot with controlling my horse's speed at the lope); counter canter; lead changes - both simple and flying - and how to achieve them; how to get some speed and a soft feel on a back up.  (I've found that this method really does work.); how to back in circles - (this exercise has helped me to develop a better feel for how my horse is actually operating).  And he demonstrates these things on a 16/2 green horse, not a finished hackamore horse, so that you can see what you might expect from your own horse.  Buck is very good at striving for precision with this horse, but having patience and not demanding perfection.

Then, he briefly shows how he puts all of these exercises to use by doing a cow working segment at the end.  Here he explains what he is trying to accomplish with a green horse while doing a little cutting and a little roping.

Both the sound and the video quality are top notch.",1165017600,9,2442,4.37250554323725
