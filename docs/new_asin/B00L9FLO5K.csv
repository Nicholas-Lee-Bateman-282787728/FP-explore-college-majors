6476537,5,B00L9FLO5K,"I love love love this film....

This is one of kind love story, not the typical love story you see in movies. The movie feels like a documentary because of its real like characters that make you feel part of the movie. You make a connection with the characters. You will be complete in love like me. You will feel all kind of emotion as you watch this film. I remeber that I laugh, cry, got mad all in one and more. You will find yourself rooting for the characters to be together.

Its a wonderful and inspiring film.....

Love, love, love!!!!!",1404345600,21,545,4.323529411764706
6476538,4,B00L9FLO5K,"Hank and Asha is a delightful film.  It is well directed, well acted, and an interesting script.  We saw it during the Sundance Film Festival and it was awarded ""Audience Best Film"".",1404172800,6,182,4.65625
6476539,5,B00L9FLO5K,"With the benefit of modern technology, it feels like were able to be in communication with anyone at any time. At this very moment, I can use free technology to talk and see someone on the other side of the planet. Its a level of global intimacy that has never been available to mankind before, where you can know someone better than you know anybody elsebut you have never been in the same city before.

Asha first heard of Hank when she saw his film at a festival in Prague. Smitten by his talent, she decides to send him a video of appreciation. When he receives the recording in New York, he returns the favor. Then she responds. And he responds. And she responds.

What they create is something special. The entire film is composed of these recordings they send each other with the titular characters looking right into the camera as they imagine the one they care about on a different continent. While a show like Peep Show uses this device to bring the audience along into their spiral of awkward destruction, Hank and Asha uses it to make you part of the romance. We become even more invested because, more than any other film, we feel that were in the room for their most sincere momentseven though nobody technically is.

This experiment could have easily been a series of Skype calls with the leads always moving a bit too close to their laptop camera. Since both characters are enthusiastic documentary filmmakers, this allows director James E. Duff to make every video they send each other to be more visually dynamic. These are two people who want to depict their own individual truths. So they create experiences that they can capture on film to share with each other. This includes setting up the camera before they try the famous beer from the Czech Republic for the first time or when they are at their most emotionally confused, they press record so they can convey exactly what they're feeling when they receive surprising news.

Enough cannot be said about the two actors who have to carry the film. Andrew Pastides and Mahira Kakkar never miss a beat for even a millisecond. They have no one else to react to but the all seeing-lens and the results are incredible. They control the frame with their expert understanding of the characters as Pastides and Kakkar are able to portray all the emotions the characters mean to put onto film and the ones they cant hide. This gimmick is incredibly challenging for actors and without them this could be an unfortunate disaster. Instead, thanks to their charmingly perfect performances, a beautiful vision and a wonderful script by Duff and Julia Morrison, this is one of the most likable and rewarding romantic films in years.",1403913600,71,2690,4.704883227176221
6476540,4,B00L9FLO5K,"very sweet. some parts a little cliche, but that's a love story for you..",1498348800,,73,4.285714285714286
6476541,4,B00L9FLO5K,"spoilers ahead: the movie sucked me in. the artistic sensitivities were enthralling. i kept waiting for the train-wreck  or the happy ending and got neither.  the clue that i just watched something meaningful/deep/well done  is that  i wanted to throw things at the screen and slap the bitch.  and it got me upset for about an hour after the film... but then i realized that SHE did not invite to Paris. he did. he pushed past the friend zone. she did not.  she kept her maturity, kept good boundaries, and honored her traditions.  where she screwed up was not nipping the Paris talk in the bud.

honestly, if you were her, would you choose the doctor or the entry level film dude sent for coffee in new York.  be honest.",1497744000,,721,4.484615384615385
6476542,4,B00L9FLO5K,"Rather straight to the point. The two title figures are like video communication all the way. Also, we the viewers are introduced and acquainted with the two lovers, in breaking-the-fourth-wall sort of fashion. Can't help but love Asha's energy for the first half.  The narrative could have used a little more build-up, so it wouldn't feel so rushed. Except for that, more realistic and less commercial than a lot of the lovey-dovey stuff we've seen in over thirty years. Heartbreaking as the film ultimately is, it's a reminder of where we are on an interpersonal, communicative note. And that hyper-connection only SEEMS like a must, but it's not. We just have to slow down and pay attention--and put our body-weight into it, instead of just camera-weight.",1497484800,,758,5.015873015873016

It made me laugh and then cry...but most of all, it made me grateful to have found love several times in my lifetime. It made me revel in the possibility of something beautiful at any point in life.

6476548,2,B00L9FLO5K,"I don't get the gushing reviews on this.  Video chats in this day of Skype and FaceTime are the first major flaw.  Second is Asha's incongruous behavior.

That's kind of how I felt about this movie. It was only a mirage. It had the appearance of greatness, but it left me wanting the real thing.  The writers had me at the first video chat hello between Asha and Hank. I wrenched free of all affection I had previously felt for this film when I realized what the ending would be in the last five minutes. They would never meet. Asha's ties to her family and tradition held her fast and unmoved. I will give the writers high marks if the goal was to create a film based in a realty made of cold hard steel. I think what most people long for and wish to see is a character with brass, a mark of distinction-something that sets these two a part from all the rest of the world. A Romeo and Juliet. Two people willing to risk everything for love. We find in the end, however, they are much the same as everyone else-going through the motions, chasing a mirage that leads to emptiness and and a sub-par existence. What if they had given everything for love instead of going through the motions? I guess we'll never know.",1472860800,,1199,4.258771929824562

And unlike just instant video messaging.., (well, I'll let you see the film). Both characters were very believable and likeable, their acting really connected with me as audience, giving you their eyes and open faces as they shared. The cultural differences which so often are so attractive also can have those 'wow, hard to relate to the way you guys think' elements that people who fall in love from different countries often find; but that also made it interesting.

6476798,3,B00L9FLO5K,the film riveted my attention to the screen during its earlier half or so.  Then the cultural differences aspect started trashing ti all out.

It is a different type of introduction to a relationship. Within the narrative, the emotions are unassuming and authenticly naive through the modern medium of the video communications. Interestingly, I appreciated how the screenwriters decided to mail the video rather than just send them. The outcome is as many relationships can end through two people who love each other but can't be together because of life, culture, expectations, etc. In the ending, the result is not the Disneyesk relief for the viewers but the beautiful disintegration of two hopeful beings.",1467331200,,723,5.135593220338983

At the same time Asha is portrayed with a curiosity and intensity that very much bespoke the sort of person we would expect.

This was a good movie and if you let your heart follow will be even better. It's not what American's would typically call a ""love"" story but in the end it is.

6477145,3,B00L9FLO5K,Sweet storyline but not a very satisfying ending. Unfortunately the story reinforced the power of family on vulnerable females in most Asian cultures.

I laughed hysterically and was left feeling pretty good about my own train wreck of a love life at the same time.  Sit down, and just try to absorb what the director and actors are trying to show you.  It's fun to watch, and at the end, you'll be ok with it.  I promise.",1453248000,,453,4.113636363636363

6477189,5,B00L9FLO5K,"Seeing the awards this film received, I was intrigued. After viewing it, I was in agreement with the critics. It is completely unconventional in that it features unknown actors, and only the two of them, for the most part, appear in the film. Viewers watch videotaped vignettes filmed by Hank, a 27-year-old filmmaker in New York whose day job is as a production assistant for a reality show, meaning he sits in a van and is at the ready to transport the production crew to and from locations, and Asha, a 25-year-old woman studying film in Prague for a year until she returns to her native India.

Asha contacts Hank, whom she hopes is not a stodgy old man, regarding questions she had after seeing one of his movies at a film festival in Prague. From there, Hank responds via videotape and the two begin a sweet friendship that turns into a budding romance. When Asha reveals to Hank some crucial news, the relationship is altered.

I don't want to give out too much information because even just telling a potential viewer details would not give the film justice as it is definitely something one has to experience to appreciate. It's an atypical film in every way and speaks volumes of how social connections forged via technology can be real and yet fleeting.

I'm glad I got to know Hank and Asha--even for a little while--and wish I could follow up on the rest of the story.",1453161600,8,1381,4.582995951417004
6477190,5,B00L9FLO5K,"This is a unique film. There are only two main characters, and the action takes place in a series of video messages between them. It may sound boring, but it is not.

Not being pessimistic about relationships it is just that sometimes not all the elements align ''Time, Place and Body'' the way we wish they would. The movie was simple, but with a wonderful message.  Just because we can't Love someone exactly the way we want, doesn't mean we shouldn't share our heart (at least in the name of friendship).

But Her innocuous flirtations mislead the boy who has a different agenda. In the end reason prevails. Very mature girl and excellent portrayal of a typical Indian Girl in the 21st Century. Ambitious, yet well grounded and respectful of the value system of the ecosystem of origin. Some very subtle angles of her thinking are well presented - example the discomfort in an ecosystem where she is is not accepted a 100% and possibility reinforcing her resolve to gravitate back. This is a good movie for all young nationals in this FLAT world. The compromises in a cross cultural marriage are not directly touched on but can be extrapolated - example the boy's description of his family.  These descriptions are so good you almost feel these people breathing down your neck.

The actors were both exceptional. The cinematography in Prauge and NYC was good.",1446422400,4,1019,4.953216374269005

I would like to have seen Asha wrestle more honestly with her emotions. I reserve articulation of the other frustration I have with the movie so as not to be a spoiler. Some of the writing and acting, especially that of Andrew Pastides, is compelling enough to induce me to push the rating partly into the fourth star.

As they kept talking about meeting in Paris, I kept wondering what would happen beyond the initial meet and where the movie would take us.  How would they end up together.  Then the twist was thrown in there and I was very disappointed with her from that moent through the end.  She mentions ""that's not who I am"" but she's the one who initiated all of this!  She sent adorable vids that were playful and intimate.  Then she tells him she can't meet him after leading him on this whole time....but uses the ticket to Paris anyway after telling him she wasn't going to Paris.  What?!  I really fell in love with her character and his as well...both so adorable but he turned out to be the only honest one with genuine intentions.  He was too good for her.  When he hung the ribbon that she said was made for him to ""Wish new fortune at the beginning of a new journey....so Hank this is for you."" it's telling that she never had any intention of meeting him and he handled it far better than I would expect after being played.

6477438,2,B00L9FLO5K,"Hmm....coming from the other side of the world (i.e., Asha's side of the world), I can totally relate to her emotions and reactions in the movie.

Of course, being a sucker for a HEA, I was expecting a similar one.

There can be two schools of thought with a movie like this - it can be construed as a pen pal in video, or it can be construed as a love story which slowly develops over time.

This day and world, both men and women stand as testimony to their choices, and Asha in this movie is not exempt from it.
I feel she led him on, with her intense reactions and stark portrayal of emotions - no, neither of the protagonists had a poker face!

If Asha had never had the intentions, she should have made it clear to Hank first off. Notice that in the two hours, neither of them really indicated a liking to the other person. The idea was all circumspect and left to imagination.

If this movie has one of its motives to show South Asian women in a different light, and show how their character could be flawed, I will vehemently deny the same. If it portrays an average South Asian woman, who falls in line with her parents just for the sake of the ""verbal agreement"", I think the research done was not enough. Sad effort leading to a bad result, I would say.

If on the other hand, the protagonists had a plan all along to just be pen pals, then they beautifully carried it off. Nothing wrong in having a ""boy"" friend, who can hear you and your arguments out and provide insight into what should and should not be done.

You could always be madly passionate with your spouse, AND STILL REMINISCE PARIS WITH YOUR FRIEND!

The last scene where she puts a lock and throws the key in Paris - was unnecessary if the ending was the way it was - unless the Director is planning a sequel.

Not bad to watch, watch for photography.",1439510400,,1828,4.2601156069364166

He lives in a fancy big city of China where I dreamed to meet him there. I tried and failed. Before going to college, we end up being good friends, just friends. I couldn't face to him for a long time. It is so easy to disappear when you are only talking through tech tools. You just need to turn off the computer, hide your cellphone and get away from Internet. When you were heading home, there will not be a surprise that he's standing in front of your house. After a long time, he wrote me a letter which said whenever I turn around, he'll be there for me, as the best friend. Then I replied to say so will I. End of story.

The ending left me sad, but her opening comments came back to me.  Their relationship was meaningful.  It was beautiful.

Once I learned there was a possibility of them meeting in Paris, I skipped ahead to see if they would actually meet after all, and of course they didn't.

While Hanks takes a chance to discover himself and learn and grow from his experiences, for Asha this is an escapism. I was disappointed with her character, it just reflects the hypocrisy of Indian values.

Folks, I really had to power through on this one, primarily dull, boring and repetitive. However, the promise of a conjoinment in Paris kept me hoping for more. Given the beautiful capture of Prague and it's cityscapes, could it get even better with both of their videocams in Paris??? I'm IN!

So there I was yelling at the screen...C'mon kids move it along pahleeeze! Let's have some fun in Paris, and when I observed there were just minutes remaining, I sighed knowing this was not to be. What a cop out you freaks, she is so modest but takes film of her in bed and shares many intimate moments, but FLOWERS, OMG this X-rated scene permanently scarred my soul.

What a sweet concept of a growing romance between two cultures and how they overcame their differences and somehow could end up together, OK maybe at least at her wedding...

But wait, there's actually more! This guy is really seXy with his Risky Business Hindi Dance and could not get a date as a PA in NYC???? Just too many non-credible variables and slow dialog that truly disappointed.

Recommend for Prague capture and better than Tom Cruise undie dance. I know, low budget, but so are many prized possessions.",1424044800,10,1222,4.665116279069768

6477748,5,B00L9FLO5K,"""Hank and Asha"" is a great film in many ways:

The caliber of writing in this small film is truly exceptional. Although some of the dialog appears to be improvisational, my guess is that the majority was written by the filmmakers and there's not a false note of dialog in the entire movie.

You would never know that this movie was filmed on a shoestring budget. The cinematography is outstanding. This film looks like anything but a low budget movie.  Beautifully shot!

I can only imagine the difficulties of editing a film like this. It seems as if it was edited down to the best possible 73 minutes. Yes, it's a short film, but it doesn't feel like one. Kudos to the editor (Julia Morrison) for not being tempted to turn this into a two-hour movie.

Both lead actors are extremely good and believable. I fully expect to see the male lead (Andrew Pastides) in an ABC TV sitcom soon, or if not, then he could be the next Paul Rudd.

Finally, James E. Duff is obviously an extremely gifted first-time director.  I can't wait to see what comes next from the filmmaking team of James E. Duff and Julia Morrison.

""Hank and Asha"" is a must-see. Certainly one of the best independent films of 2014.",1407283200,7,1195,4.5
6477749,5,B00L9FLO5K,"In their first outing, Duff and Morrison have a magical movie on their hands in Hank and Asha.

8664612,5,B00L9FLO5K,"A wonderful and painful modern love story. I really found the two actors so adorable, lovable, real, and enjoyed their youthful enthusiasm for exploring connection and creativity with each other. I grew up in an age of no computers and often find the internet age overwhelming. Yet the way this story was done with video sharing I came to appreciate how connected two people can become through this medium and actually fall in love.
I absolutely loved the Bollywood dance scene of Hanks!! And Asha's eyes.....oh who would not fall into those incredible big, beautiful, expressive orbs and find love!
Of course I new the choice Asha had to make because of her culture and yet she was able to try on other feelings and realities in her ""video reality world"" with Hank. Something that was not expressed in the film is that often Vedic Astrology charts are done for the couples in arranged marriages so that compatibility can be viewed in that way. One cannot take people's choices out of their cultural context and understand them.",1519776000,,1028,4.813559322033898
