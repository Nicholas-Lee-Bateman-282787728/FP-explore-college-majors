8691030,4,B00QDGJYNE,"New Years Eve concert 1996

This disc, recorded at the end of 1996, shows the hall and the stage to be rather dark areas with subdued lighting being the nature of the event. The re-mastering for Blu-ray has coped with the lighting rather better than the previous DVD release and has significantly improved stereo sound on offer. Nevertheless it would be misleading to suggest that the result approaches the clarity of sound and vision associated with a more modern recording.

The program itself is also rather limited in so far as it is less wide-ranging than many such concerts and presents a program that, almost by definition, will limit the appeal of the disc. It must be stressed at this point that this observation refers to the program content rather than to the delivery of the program which is uniformly excellent.

The program concentrates on the work of Brahms and Ravel before concluding with the Hungarian march of Berlioz which is given a particularly lively and exciting performance. The whole program runs under the unifying title of Dances and Gypsy Tunes and the Berlioz march therefore makes a fitting and uplifting conclusion to the theme. Indeed, all the items of the program fit the theme precisely and all are delivered with expertise and panache.

The soloist for the evening was Maxim Vengerov whose delivery of Ravels Tzigane is simply astonishing in its virtuosity placed at the service of an amazing insight into Ravels comprehensive assimilation of the gypsy style of violin playing that inspired the work.  It is difficult to describe how this is achieved as the whole concept of identification and delivery seems to be in a class of its own. It is such a revelation that it is tempting to comment that it may even be worth the purchase of this disc for that alone!

The other piece by Ravel is his La Valse which is given a fine performance even though the gypsy connection seems somewhat tenuous given its links to the disintegration of society in the lead up to war and shown via the distortion and collapse of the waltz representing a collapsing civilisation.

The rest of the program is devoted to Brahms, and in particular to his interest in gypsy themes. There are six of the Hungarian dances in their orchestral clothing, the 7th being played by Vengerov as his well-deserved encore with the orchestra.

The rest of the program consists of his five Gypsy Songs Op. 103, the song Es tont ein voller Harfenklang and the eight Op 52 Liebeslider-Waltzer. These are all sung in German and if ever there was a case for sub titles to be included as an essential aid for non-German speaking viewers this has to be it. These are not well-known songs and are meaningless without help with the language. This should have been an essential part of the re-mastering for Blu-ray. If that was not technically possible then there should have been texts provided within the booklet.

It is for that reason that I suggest that this disc will have limited appeal  limited to a German speaking audience interested in rather a peripheral part of Brahms output. That apart, the performances seem to be excellent and are given with enjoyment and conviction by the excellent Swedish choir.

A good upgrade therefore but also a lost opportunity. Recordings from 1996 were not HD so it would be misleading to suggest that this is competitive in that way. This will be of considerable interest for those undeterred by the limitations of the program content or the lack of sub titles.

A well performed concert which explores the gypsy world heard through the ears of Brahms, Ravel and Berlioz but lacking useful sub titles

New Years Eve concert 1997

This was a spectacularly successful concert on DVD and, now in its newly re-mastered form for Blu-ray, it is irresistible. Previously the compromises in terms of visual clarity at anything longer than short range and the curtained bass response on DVD simply failed to match the sheer verve and brilliance of the performances. This is no longer the case with this re-mastered Blu-ray with provides far greater clarity visually plus stereo sound of greater range, clarity and realism throughout.

These comments have to be understood in terms of the original date of 1997 which is pre true HD, but there is no alternative to be had of Anne Sofie von Otter and Bryn Terfel, Mikhail Pletnev and Gil Shaham combining together in such as display of concert fireworks!

The sub-title of the concert was A tribute to Carmen which must be taken rather loosely in some cases. The opening however, is clear enough. The concert opens with selections from Carmen with Terfel being on commanding form as Escamillo and Anne-Sophie von Otter clearly demonstrating why she was later chosen for the title role in the McVicar production at Glyndebourne. Alagna shows his empathy with his role of Don Jose to good effect too. The choral and supporting roles are also excellently done responding to sparkling leadership from Abbado.

Mikhail Pletnev follows with a stunning performance of the Rachmaninov Paganini Rhapsody, a performance to match any with its cool virtuosity, wit and sensitivity. The link with Carmen seems somewhat tenuous but also irrelevant given the quality of the performance. This is simply an altogether outstanding musical experience judged by any criteria.

Gil Shaham was faced with How do you follow that? as he took the stage next with his performance of Sarasates Carmen Fantasy. There have been many fine recordings of this famous display piece but none to outdo this for sheer bravado and with concluding tempi of increasingly jaw-dropping pace and total accuracy. In summary, this is yet another remarkable experience from a world-class soloist at the very top of his remarkable form.

Staying with the Carmen experience through nationality, Abbado directs sensitive and ultimately exhilarating performances of Ravels Rhapsody Espagnole and Manuel de Fallas Ritual Fire dance. The concert concludes with a rousing pair of Brahms Hungarian Dances, numbers 1 and 5.

All in all this can arguably be considered to be one of Abbados finest concert achievement on audio-visual disc and of a standard to match his renowned 2002 concert from Palermo or his thrilling interpretation of the Tchaikovsky Symphony 5 of 1994 in the Suntory Hall, Tokyo. It fully deserves serious consideration from collectors, not least those considering the expense of upgrading from DVD to Blu-ray.

A particularly fine concert deserving of superlatives and in greatly improved mastering for this Blu-ray release

New Years Eve concert 1998

The sub-title of this Blu-ray reissue of the New Years Eve concert from 1998 is Songs of Love and Desire and the emphasis, not surprisingly is fixed firmly on the operatic depiction of these sometimes contradictory concepts. Unlike the 1996 concert, this time the stage and the auditorium is well lit and this makes the whole event more user friendly to watch for the home viewer.

As with the other two titles in this mini-series conducted by Abbado, 1996-1998, this re-mastering for Blu-ray brings significant improvements both in visual clarity and with stereo sound providing greater clarity and range than before on DVD. The bass is far firmer and the treble has greater sparkle and the whole experience is more realistic. However, this has to be seen within the concept of the original recording being just pre-HD vintage. The producer, Paul Smaczny, moved into HD cameras only a few months later in 1999 and that difference is obvious with the recording of the Mozart Requiem where the skin tones and distance shots benefit markedly.

The concert itself is a very high quality event indeed with Abbado constantly demonstrating his complete mastery of the repertoire and unusually sparkling performances at generally brisk tempi are the order of the day. The three overtures by Mozart, Rossini and Berlioz sizzle and the Tchaikovsky Polonaise is a masterclass on how it should be done to create the sense of spectacle, even without staging to assist.

The four soloists are uniformly superb and well matched to the chosen repertoire and to each other where they are paired together. Christine Schafer has made a fine Gilda on DVD and, as here, was paired with Marcelo Alvarez who makes for a suitably self-congratulatory Count in La donna &eacute; mobile. Her other arias from Mozart simply reinforce her reputation in that repertoire as does Alvarez in his Verdi. Simon Keenlyside is no stranger to Mozart either and here he reprises his magic Flute and Don Giovanni roles with easy flair. The final soloist of the eventing represents an older generation but Mirella Frenis delivery of the Letter Scene from Eugene Onegin is equal to all that had gone before.

The booklet is informative and satisfactory, but as with the 1996 re-issue, there are no subtitles provided which is a significant lost opportunity. Well-known though these arias may be, there are considerable advantages for those who are generally familiar with the words to have a more specific understanding of what is being sung, word by word. The loss to those unfamiliar with the exact meaning of the texts being sung is obvious and should have been addressed, especially on a full priced re-mastered vintage disc.

Apart from the lack of sub-titles this is a particularly fine concert which will be of great attraction to opera enthusiasts who are thus able to hear favourite arias performed superbly by all concerned. This is a high quality concert and the video and stereo sound is a clear advance on the previous DVD issue even if it, naturally, falls short of the latest HD technology.

A fine concert of favourite opera highlights, well re-mastered for Blu-ray from the 1998 original but without sub-titles",1427587200,,10012,5.123926380368098
8691031,5,B00QDGJYNE,"This set of three New Year's Eve concerts, although focusing largely on lighter fare, gives ample evidence of what the music world lost when Claudio Abbado died in 2014. I've yet to come across an Abbado-led performance that didn't sound unerringly right. And when he was inspired, no one could match him.

If you're an Abbado fan, as obviously I am, you won't want to be without these Blu-ray discs, which I was lucky enough to receive review copies of. However, allowances must be made for age. The picture quality of these Berlin Philharmonic concerts from 1996-98 is several notches below what one would expect in a recent high definition release. The image is coarse and not sharp. I'm sure there's only so much that EuroArts could do with the older source material. Wisely, I think, the original 4:3 framing has been reformatted to 16:9 so that it fills your HDTV screen. And it's been done with care; not once did I notice awkward cropping.

The good news is that the sound is excellent, although it's PCM Stereo, as opposed to 5.1 surround sound (which I generally prefer). It still sounds spacious when routed through a receiver, and the lossless audio provides a full dynamic range without congestion or distortion.

Unfortunately, there are no subtitles for any of the vocal works.

Now, some capsule reviews of the individual discs:

1996: DANCES & GYPSY TUNES

As is often the case with these New Year's Eve concerts, almost all of the works on this disc -- like the Hungarian Dances and Gypsy Songs by Brahms -- are quite short, making it somewhat episodic. The two longest pieces are by Ravel: Tzigane (about 10 minutes) and La Valse (about 14 minutes).

One of the pleasures of the older performances on these discs is seeing now well-established artists at an earlier point in their careers. That's certainly the case with Russian violin soloist Maxim Vengerov, who subsequently became a conductor as well. He shows how he earned his virtuoso stripes in the two showpieces he's given, the Tzigane and the Brahms Hungarian Dance No. 7. At a mere 22 years of age, he already has technique to burn -- and burn with bow he does.

As usual, Abbado conducts everything without a score, which never fails to amaze me.

This disc is on the short side, only 73 minutes long.

1997: A TRIBUTE TO CARMEN

The picture quality gets somewhat worse in this 90-minute disc. Ghosting and artifacts abound, probably because edge enhancement was applied too aggressively in an attempt to sharpen the image. The audio, though, remains excellent.

The ""Carmen"" section offers familiar arias distinctively sung by Anne Sofie Von Otter, Bryn Terfel and Roberto Alagna. The singers bring none of the generalized approach that one often gets with concerts. They're quite committed. Orchestrally, it's more smoothly professional than thrilling, lacking perhaps that extra ounce of excitement.

Mikhail Pletnev (now better known as a conductor) then arrives at the piano for Rachmaninov's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. I couldn't help but compare his approach to that of another Russian pianist, Denis Matsuev, who seemed to equate ""passion"" with blurred runs in Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 2 in another disc (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yuri-Temirkanov-Conducts-Rachmaninov-Rimsky-Korsakov-Blu-ray/dp/B00N70J0MY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yuri Temirkanov Conducts Rachmaninov & Rimsky-Korsakov [Blu-ray</a>]). Pletnev articulates the notes clearly and is quite precise, without any showiness -- and is more effective in the end for it.

The temperature rises further with the arrival of American violinist Gil Shaham, who expertly fuses passion and virtuosity in Sarasate's Carmen Fantasy.

That's followed by Ravel's Rhapsody Espagnole. Under Abbado, the orchestra captures all the magic and colors of this piece, right up to the fiery finish, which leads nicely into the next piece, Falla's Ritual Fire Dance from El Amor Brujo.

That would have provided a fitting end to the concert, but it continues with the Brahms Hungarian Dance No. 1. Oddly, the last piece on the program, the Hungarian Dance No. 5, is not listed on the case or the booklet or even the Blu-ray menu of chapters. Both works were included in the 1996 New Year's Eve concert program as well.

1998: SONGS OF LOVE AND DESIRE

The picture quality improves a bit in this 92-minute disc. Surely, no one is obtaining this for the chestnuts -- pieces by Bizet, Rossini and Berlioz -- that are interspersed throughout, as lively as they are in the Berlin Philharmonic's hands. This is about the singing.

The younger performers -- captured here as they were hitting their stride in their distinguished careers -- are all excellent in arias and duets from Mozart and Verdi operas. Christine Schafer (born in 1965, although the booklet says 1959) has a superbly clean tone and rock-solid technique perfectly suited to the Mozart arias. One could wish for a bit more warmth and expressiveness in the ""Caro nome"" from Rigoletto, but the voice remains impressive. Simon Keenlyside does equal justice to his arias and duets from Don Giovanni and ""Eri tu"" from Un Ballo in Maschera, the latter of which for some reason was left off the Blu-ray case. Marcelo Alvarez, four years after his debut at the age of 34, shows why he made such a splash on the opera scene in the Rigoletto duet and aria.

Then arrives Mirella Freni, who by this point had been singing for 43 years (she would retire seven years later). I braced myself. Not many sopranos sound good this far into their careers, and one often has to let affection for previous performances carry one through. I needn't have worried. Freni is a marvel. Her tone remains beautiful throughout her range and she doesn't hold back on involvement in the long letter scene from Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. Then she leads the ""Libiamo"" from Verdi's La Traviata, sounding much as she did earlier in her career in one of her signature roles. Brava. It provides a great finish to a very enjoyable concert -- and this three-disc set.",1426982400,,6077,5.064064064064064
8691032,2,B00QDGJYNE,"Iv'e just received this set to replace my existing dvd's, I ordered them on the basis that the packaging stated 1080i full hd, hoping that they might look at least as good as the Maazel Wagner 'Ring without words' from the same venue in 2000, clearly hd. Well, it was not to be, the picture quality was no better than the dvd's. Euroarts should be admonished for releasing these at full price, what a waste of money!",1423440000,6,416,4.415584415584416
8691033,4,B00QDGJYNE,"In spite of the labeling on this Blu-ray disc, the concerts are not in HD. Oh yes, of course they are ""upconverted"" from their original standard-definition source; but this does not, and never can, restore detail that was not there in the first place. (Also, bear in mind that every Blu-ray player and every HDTV automatically upconverts to its native resolution; so the only conceivable non-fraudulent point of this would be if the producers of this Blu-ray were able to do a better job of upconversion than the aforementioned; but I see no evidence of it here. Compatibility wouldn't be an issue either; Blu-ray players that don't also play DVDs are exceedingly rare if they exist at all; and DVDs are compatible with far more players than Blu-rays.) The picture is a tad better than VHS, but not even DVD quality, which begs the question, why does there not seem to be a DVD version available?

Oh, in case anyone suggests, ""These are from 1996-1998; what did you expect?"" I'd point out that there is plenty of HD-worthy material that predates the twenty-first century-- on 35mm film, the original ""hi-def."" That is what I was hoping for here. Didn't happen.

Thus in terms of audio/video quality, this set is rather over-priced; but the performances are excellent, the occasions special, and the presence of Claudio Abbado priceless. The audio is stereo--no surround; but otherwise it's fine.",1423440000,4,1396,4.9361702127659575
