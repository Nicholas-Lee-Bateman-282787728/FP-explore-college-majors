7983859,1,B00008G98T,"Advice:  don't waste any more time looking at this product or reading reviews. The content is stupid, the video quality is horrific. Most of the discs aren't even labeled at all.  Yuk!",1376870400,,184,4.71875
7983860,4,B00008G98T,"If you want your money's worth when it comes to instructional dance videos, then you can't go wrong with this choice.  I bought this in the store once and wanted to buy a backup so I ordered it on here.  That's how good it is.",1358121600,,226,4.0
7983861,5,B00008G98T,I bought this for a newly single friend she loved it. I am very happy with everything.,1284163200,,86,4.117647058823529
7983862,5,B00008G98T,"This box set includes ""Invitation to Ballroom Danceing and Invitation to Latin Danceing"". The instructors are Kyle and Susan Webb, and they do a great job in my opinion. These two DVDs are sold individually for $7 to around $10 each, plus shipping. The DVD with dances from the 50's to the 80's is only just interesting. It is very, very basic and not real detailed on any of the ones I actually took time to look at. I did a Fast Forward through it. The two DVDs, ""Your Wedding Dance and Swing Dance"" are as good as any. They are easy to understand and to get started with. The last three ""Country Line Dancing, Partner Dancing, and Partner Dancing - Intermediate to Advanced"" looked OK at a quick glance, but I have not really spent much time looking at them yet. The set says 14 hours on 5 DVDs, but 3 of them are two sided DVDs so it is really like 8 one sided ones. I don't know where else you can get so much information for so little. I have been taking lessons at Fred Astaire and the Ballroom and Latin are very close to what I have been taught so far. I would be hard to go wrong with this set.",1179446400,3,1104,4.1395348837209305
7983863,5,B00008G98T,"I bought this DVD set mainly for the dances of the 50s and 60s DVD. I was wanting to learn those dances and it is impossible to find any DVDs that teach you these solo dances - it seems like everything is for partner dancing.  Anyway, you'll learn the Alligator, the Swim, the Fly, the Monkey, the Mashed Potato, the Jerk, the Frug, the Shimmy, Watusi to name a few. The dances are broken down step by step and then at the end of a series of dances, you put them together in a ""let's dance"" segment.

The dances are only demonstrated a few times so be prepared to rewind the DVD.

I'm looking forward now to moving on to the 70s and 80s dances!

This is a lot of fun and a great way to exercise!",1161561600,3,695,4.0510948905109485
7983864,5,B00008G98T,"As mentioned in previous reviews, it is actually the equivalent of 8 DVD's, since some are 2-sided.  There are different instructors for the different types of dances.

This is a great set for a beginner in many dance styles.  (Watusi, fruge, mash potato, running man,  rumba, cha-cha, ballroom, line dancing, & many others.  It is basic enough to help the person who is so shy they don't even want to go on the dance floor, but comprehensive enough to aid an experienced dancer in learning a different dance style.

In instances where there are different steps for the male & female, the instructor turns his/her back to you, so that you can copy the steps exactly, and avoid turning your back to the screen and looking over your shoulder to follow.

I recently checked into private dance lessons where I live, and they are $45 an hour.  This set has about 13 hours of instruction.  A bargain at double the price.",1154563200,10,914,4.627329192546584
7983865,5,B00008G98T,"It might depend on what you need, but this is a great set for beginners, or those looking to learn new styles or add to their knowledge, which covers a wide spectrum of styles at a low price.  Of the 5 DVD's three are two-sided thus closer to 8 DVD's worth of material!  You could easily pay the same amount for only one instructional disc.

It does appear to be less expensive because it was taken from various individual VHS tapes - which is an advantage over the VHS format for ease of replaying the varios dance steps, and doesn't cover the latest pop or hip hop dance styles.",1154390400,5,580,4.302752293577981
7983866,4,B00008G98T,"Three generations of my family recommend this DVD. If any DVD can teach dance successfully without personal coaching, this one can! 1. The music is great. 2. The teaching is easily understood. 3. The teachers are experts in their field. 4. It's a bargain!  5. It's huge! It will take years of free time to learn all the dances on this set. Drawbacks: One of the instructors is a bit tense teaching to a camera but his moves and verbal instructions are outstanding. Some of the outfits are now dated, but that is unavoidable. Overall, it's well done! If you can't afford individualized lessons, this DVD is the answer!",1106438400,15,617,4.660550458715596
