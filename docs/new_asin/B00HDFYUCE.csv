Go and find out for yourself by watching this great s***!
Exciting and funny, too.

Great stuff!",1392854400,,283,4.3584905660377355
6154960,4,B00HDFYUCE,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started watching this film.  I enjoy classic sci-fi such as Doctor Who, Fifth Element, Cloud Atlas and Matrix etc etc and this isn't special effects-heavy like those and yet it stands with them as a good, engrossing, entertaining movie.
I would think if you liked Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or (the other film many reviewers are mentioning) Memento then you will enjoy this film too.
I liked the way the film kept me thinking and trying to work out what was going on (in a good way don't worry) which is something you often don't get the fun of except for in whodunnits and it was quite unpredictable.
I didn't get bored and I didn't fall asleep - which is not something I could say about Inception.
This is a film you need to concentrate on and not one you can watch while chatting or wandering in and out of the room. It requires your attention all the way through and is the sort of film you will want to watch a few times because each time you'll find something new you missed the first few times.
I think this may well end up a cult classic for sci-fi afficionados.",1392854400,19,1117,4.319047619047619
6154961,5,B00HDFYUCE,"I was so impressed with this movie after seeing it.  It immediately captured my attention, had me thinking and wondering what was happening and what would happen as the movie progressed.  Rudolf's acting is superb, intense, real and so impressive that you'll be there with him to the end.  I would recommend Pig to anyone.  It's a unique & well done film.",1392768000,,355,4.67741935483871
6154962,5,B00HDFYUCE,"""Pig"" struck me as a very clever mystery/thriller in the vein of ""Memento.""  i don't want to spoil anything so i'll keep it a bit obtuse.
""Pig"" repeatedly features a main character who is lost and struggling to survive (and thrive?) in the world - a very relatable metaphor.
finding your identity and finding your place in the world are strong themes.  are there people in conflict to your growth, or even your existence?
are there people to help and love you along the way?
this movie does a great job of exploring those themes in a clever, well produced way.
director Henry Barrial gets a lot more from his actors and environment than the small budget would suggest.
very good movie.  well worth watching.",1392768000,2,707,4.64
6154963,5,B00HDFYUCE,"This film not what it appears to be. Be prepared to think.

With an unconventional, surprising storytelling approach, great acting and gorgeous cinematography, you won't find a better undiscovered indie gem with a science fiction twist. It won a ton of awards on the festival circuit and deserves every one of them. Definitely worth checking out if you like mind-bending Christopher Nolan films like Momento and Inception, or the TV shot Lost.

6154966,4,B00HDFYUCE,"""Pig"" is a clever and unsettling sci-fi thriller of sorts, in the same vein as 'Primer' or 'Memento', though it is very much it's own film. Anchored by a great lead performance by Rudolf Martin, the film explores themes of identity, grief and memory while while telling a very compelling story. It's the kind of movie you can watch a second time and catch many things you did not see the first time. I've seen it a number of times (full disclosure, I know the filmmakers) and I am always up for watching it again, it's that kind of movie.

6154969,3,B00HDFYUCE,Didn't quite hit the mark.  The beginning gave too much away for me.

6154971,4,B00HDFYUCE,"Four PUZZLING Stars! ""PIG"" is another superb movie in the front-rank of the `amnesia-missing identity' genre of films. A 10-time film festival winner, it begins with a man coming out of unconsciousness in the desert with a hood over his head and his hands tied behind him. He tosses off the hood and begins wandering through the desert until losing consciousness and waking up having been rescued by an unlikely, concerned person. He has no idea who he is and begins the journey to self-discovery down the road in Los Angeles. As he closes in on his true identity, something very unusual happens, and the twists and turns begin. Ends up far from its beginning with no jolting surprise, but lots of breadcrums along the way. Starring Rudolf Martin, Heather Ankeny, Keith Diamond, and Ines Dali. Definitely Recommended.

This is not a terrible terrible movie. But it's not a good movie. The lead actors were all TV-show competent. But the minor characters would have had a tough time breaking into community theater in Minneapolis. But hey. We are a theater town.

The biggest compliment I can give ""Pig"" (stupid name, by the way--oh, right...COMPLIMENT) is that it reminded me a little of a less smart but more approachable ""Pi."" Which is to say that this movie is not all that great. But it gestures at capabity.",1418774400,3,633,4.410256410256411

And it's acting, direction, pacing, and you get the idea.

This film shows one of the ways of what sci-fi at it's best is meant to be; a cautionary tale of science that develops faster than our human wisdom, and a thought provoking look at what happens when that wisdom fails.

In this film, the man is not the monster, science is.  And Mary Shelly is smiling down on us all.",1399507200,3,612,4.495495495495495
6154996,4,B00HDFYUCE,"Pig

Pig is a Sci Fi Thriller, indie gem, award winning and Ive never heard of it.  But Sci fi isn't just about aliens.  Its science based fiction and good science fiction films are few and far between.  Yes there is always room on my plate for radioactive monsters and end of the world by god/alien/humans but its been a long time since Ive been engaged by a film, not intellectually, but mentally.  Not that the themes and story arcs were profound or deep; but the artistry in revealing truth through images is mentally stimulating.  And in fact the premise that is revealed at the end is not just science but is real science.  Today this is actually being done chemically if not with technology.  But this film seems intended to make all the little regions of your brain wake up as the story unfolds.  And it succeeds nicely starting with the name of the film.

So did you hear the one about the guy waking up in the middle of the desert in handcuffs with a black hood over his head and a set up footprints leading away?  Would you think maybe the footprints might be a clue?  Not our hero.  But through the magic of film editing we don't have to think about anything because our thoughts are being guided by a superb script.  In the next scene he awakens in a bed in a house in Page, AZ.  A doctor is just leaving and the pretty young womans child calls our hero daddy.  Our hero has no memory.  But he has the name Manny Elder written on a slip of paper in his pocket.  The woman, lets call her Mommy Dearest, has a gun in a box on top of the fridge which she takes out and puts in a drawer.  A picture of our hero was also in that box under the gun.  And then in an exchange about the little one mistaking our hero as his daddy, Mommy Dearest declares Id do anything for him.  Id kill for him.
Well thats the thriller part and I just cant wait to see the Sci-Fi part.  So far my pattern matching brain has been induced to believe he was left in the desert by some bad drug/gambling mobster in nearby Las Vegas.  But I know Im wrong.  So I release the parking brake on my mind and ease into the film allowing it to take me where it wants to go.

I learned in film school that there is nothing in a scene that is not fully planned for even down to a few paper clips on a desk.  There is nothing in a scene that isn't placed there for a reason.  So when he picks up the local paper and sees a headline that says Deadly Drunk Driving Accident Kills Child my mind races to a conclusion.  The toddler is his child, Mommy Dearest has lost her son and husband to a drunk.  And the drunk is the guy who woke up in the desert.  Im still not seeing the Sci-Fi-fi part of this, but the point is the director and screenwriter are going out of their way to direct our attention to things which may or may not be germane to our heros fate or history.  She has left a note and breakfast supplies and he finds the gun in the silverware drawer.  Breakfast chit chat reveals that her husband was a drug dealer and was killed on his last drug run.

It only takes 21 minutes til the sex scene.  Is that a lump on his back?  And a few moments later they're heading to LA in Mommy Dearests car just cuz they think Manny Elder is from there and of course, he takes the gun cuz you never know when you're going to need one of those.  And why do guys always think their butt cracks are the perfect place to put their guns?

So Manny Elder is the apartment manager and apparently our heros name is Justin.  Up in his apartment he begins putting the clues together.  Is Mommy Dearest still waiting for him in the car?
We don't know where she went but suddenly another woman pulls up in a convertible and begins speaking German to him and whatchaknow, er spricht perfecte Deutsch.  His name is Lukas.  Is this the Sci-Fi part yet?  Dinner at friends where he meets a Doctor who offers to do an MRI in the morning.  Thats the Sci-Fi part  free MRI.  Back to the hotel where Mommy Dearest was waiting but she left a note.  Back to Mannys where he finds a flash drive.  Back to school where he was a substitute teacher.  Meet computer teacher Whatshisname and find a lap top to insert that drive.  Not that Id expect anyone who has lost all their memories to know what a memory stick is or how to access one but he does and he learns who he is.  Sort of.  And for a guy with no memory and no wallet he sure does get around easy.  Several more clues later and the Sci-Fi payoff begins.  We learn the what and the why.  And it all makes sense.  And it all has some rather chilling implications once it sinks into your head and percolates for a bit as to what you have just seen.  Bravo.  Standing ovation.  Not mind blowing, and not trying to be.  Just a nice tight little movie that was really enjoyable and didn't involve creating scenes in order to have car chases, a wall of bullets or kung fu.

Stay for the credits to find out why little Johnny can't smile.",1399248000,2,4935,4.143459915611814
6154997,4,B00HDFYUCE,"This is a unique movie that is appropriately difficult to understand what is going on and why in the beginning, and that is the point-of-view of the main character and a purposeful aspect of the movie. Although I would rate the content PG-13, I don't think this movie would be interesting to youth. The story begins at a gentle pace of unfolding. It has some complicated, nuanced situations that make sense from the context of adult experience. It has suspense and intrigue, but is not really an action show. There is a sci-fi component, but it is not the focus. If you're a thinker, you'll be left with a pleasant aftertaste of something to ponder. I'd categorize it more as an essay on a social/ethical topic, but doesn't try to be a documentary or a sermon. For disclosure on content related to movie ratings, there is one scene of sexuality (obvious cues and not essential to the storyline), some language (some conversational expletives, a couple lewd messages on voicemail), some obscure nude images (blurred image of a topless woman on a beer glass, covers of pornographic magazines that are in view but not distinguishable).",1399248000,4,1132,4.84020618556701

The kind of film you always hope you're going to discover at a film festival. It won the Best Feature Film there and rightly so. The sci-fi part of it really snuck up on me. For most of the film it was an intriguing drama/mystery, with a lead character you could really care about. And then in the end, it reveals itself to be sci-fi, or more accurately, ""speculative science,"" (but I won't say more about the ending than that). This film really made you think. First, you're constantly trying to figure out what's happening to the lead man as new clues appear, some throwing you for a loop. Then, after the final reveal, you're asked to consider the ramifications of the story, something that no doubt as a society we will be contemplating very seriously soon enough.

If you like Memento, Clockwork Orange, Sci Fi, Mystery/Suspense, or if you just like a well-told story that's plausible, riveting and at times bewildering - you should see this movie.",1392854400,,394,4.865671641791045

8631647,4,B00HDFYUCE,"There are two kinds of movie watchers. Those who like surreal mystery and those who want everything to be very clear and concise. If you're one of the latter, don't bother. But if you enjoy surrealist mystery, you'll enjoy this.

Everybody who enjoyed this movie, i'm sure, had a theory on what was going on. It's not a difficult mystery to crack mid-film but it's atmospheric, well paced and very personal story nonetheless. I've got a weird skill at uncovering plot twists before they happen so if I had been unable to do this, I would have awarded this movie the final star.",1489017600,3,577,4.601941747572815

8631649,2,B00HDFYUCE,"I know it's all probably leading to some twist, and there's obviously more to the woman's story, but I can't suspend my disbelief enough to believe that even an amnesiac wouldn't question why a single mom would just invite him to live in her house because she found him in the desert. Yeah, ok, maybe he's confused, whatever, but it just seems such a contrived scenario. No thanks.",1487030400,,381,4.617647058823529
8631650,3,B00HDFYUCE,"This was an okay movie. I mean, the acting wasn't the best and the plot was just average... but it's still worth checking out.",1455062400,,126,4.291666666666667
8631651,3,B00HDFYUCE,"Not an easy one to grasp, but definitely interesting to watch. This one resembles memento a little bit in its structure, but the story and characters are interesting enough to set it apart, and there is definitely futuristic sci fi vibe in there. It's well directed, interestingly composed and performances are great, and though I might be biased here, Rudolf Martin is amazing in subtle, yet impactful changes of a character throughout the movie. The biggest strength of the story here is that it doesn't shy away from exploring its themes while leaving it open for the audience to draw conclusions. Definitely an underrated film, worth the time.",1444262400,,647,5.0
8631652,1,B00HDFYUCE,a colossal waste of my time. Gave it a 1 star because there was nothing lower to give,1436054400,,85,3.7777777777777777
8631653,3,B00HDFYUCE,"I enjoyed this movie though it could have done without the few shots of obscene material and foul language. They weren't needed to advance the plot or tell the story. Otherwise, very cleverly written and well done. Without giving too much away you will enjoy this movie more if you have any background or understanding of psychology. And as others have said, watch through the credits for the source material that helps tie it all together. You won't find any action so if long movies with just talking and a shroud of mystery are not your thing then don't waste your time.",1435881600,,573,4.627450980392157
8631654,4,B00HDFYUCE,"To be clear: I'm not associated with the film in any way.  My wife and I watched this and we both agreed that it's a good, solid movie.  If you're expecting intense action scenes with explosions and tons of visual effects then you may want to keep moving forward.  This is what is known as a ""Character driven story"".  The characters move the story forward.  In my opinion, the acting is good enough to keep me engaged with the characters and wondering what is going on.  It gets 4 stars because the main character, who loses his memory, is curious about his past but seems to not be curious about those around him.  The second reason is that I'm not a big fan of exposition and while some is ""ok"" there's a bit too much towards the end of the film.  I think little clues sprinkled throughout the film, with a tie-together at the end, would have made for a superior film.  But that's just my opinion.  Take it for what it's worth.",1431820800,,930,4.323699421965318
8631655,2,B00HDFYUCE,"The first two-thirds of this movie is ok/suspenseful, the rest of this movie falls apart. Someone summed this up best when they said, ""this goes nowhere fast"". I would rent, not buy.",1431561600,,182,4.71875
