5615671,5,B00BFWKE76,See the picture (in your mind) build the picture (in the real world). Why not build a photograph? Not a fake something presented as real (documentary) but something emotionally authentic (fiction).,1442793600,2,197,5.387096774193548
5615672,2,B00BFWKE76,I absolutely love Gregory Crewdson work but the Brief Encounters video is full of video clips you can find online with hardly anything new added to it.,1438819200,,151,4.62962962962963
5615673,5,B00BFWKE76,Very interesting and informative.,1434499200,,33,7.5
5615674,4,B00BFWKE76,Loved this film and the artist's unique point of view. Crewdson says he believes each artist has a single message to convey.  That is reflected in the photographs he creates. I watched it twice to fully appreciate his artistry.,1426032000,,227,4.82051282051282
5615675,4,B00BFWKE76,"Very interesting movie that looks into the life of photographer Gregory Crewdson. It is amazing to see how his production team creates these beautiful images. After watching this, I purchased his Beneath the Roses book.",1419984000,,219,5.285714285714286
5615676,5,B00BFWKE76,"great for photo students. an interesting documentary, well shot as are all things Crewdson.",1416614400,2,91,5.571428571428571
5615677,5,B00BFWKE76,Very good inside view of how Crewdson thinks and works. You get to see the actual set ups and process of various photographs which are as much work as a film set.,1411430400,2,162,4.09375
5615678,5,B00BFWKE76,Nice,1410134400,,4,4.0
5615679,5,B00BFWKE76,"It's a little dark and disquieting, like his works, but a must see for anyone that has viewed them close up and wonders about the process.",1402790400,,138,4.346153846153846
5615680,4,B00BFWKE76,I like having the book but the DVD documentary is more fascinating for a newcomer.  I do like the book and never realized everything he went through to set these photos up.  Like many things I thought it was all digital manipulation.  Get the book after you have seen the video if you want.,1401926400,,290,4.333333333333333
5615681,5,B00BFWKE76,I love Gregory Crewdson's work! It's ethereal and yet completely accessible. It's great to have this documentary of his process.,1399766400,2,128,5.45
5615682,5,B00BFWKE76,"For serious photographers learning fine art photography, this is a delicious feast.  The film follows Gregory's development from a young age to a celebrity photographer.  More importantly, Gregory demonstrates the attention to detail that produces a fine art image.  Even if you are not a photographer, but appreciate photographic work or films, i would think this has a lot to offer.  I've been a serious photographer since 2007, have had some success at selling prints during a recession :-(, and also have donated photographic work at a playhouse.  There is a lot of art in this film, and its a delight to see it so well documented.",1395964800,3,635,4.897196261682243
5615683,5,B00BFWKE76,"The movie is very well done and the topic is very interesting. Definitely recommend seeing it, especially if you are into photography.",1380326400,2,134,5.136363636363637
5615684,3,B00BFWKE76,"I had seen previews for this and read raving reviews.  I was looking forward to this documentary, but ultimately found it not overwhelming.  It wasn't bad, perhaps it just wasn't my style of show that I can follow.",1378166400,,214,4.605263157894737
5615685,4,B00BFWKE76,A fantastic insight into the psyche and creative drive behind a remarkable and inspiring photographer. I will watch this with my students again and again.,1377734400,,154,5.2
5615686,5,B00BFWKE76,"I've been a follower of Crewdson's work, in particular his ambitious ""Beneath the Roses"" project, and was hoping that this documentary about him wouldn't somehow disappoint -- I'm happy to say that it delivered, for me, on all levels:  I learned more about the man and his development as an artist, I learned more about the way he develops his image concepts in ""pre-production,"" and I learned more about his shooting methods.

We viewers are fortunate that the filmmaker had access to Crewdson over the course of a number of years, so there is a very real sense of process and development, rather than the compression of a rather large story into a manageable number of shooting days.",1377302400,7,685,4.796610169491525
5615687,5,B00BFWKE76,"A great glimpse into Crewdson's work from behind the scenes shoots, to interviews with him and friends/colleagues. A must see for any fan or anyone interested in contemporary photography. Also, very inspiring to see how his work and process evolved over time for a photographer.",1373587200,4,278,5.2
8567844,4,B00BFWKE76,"Love his work. It was an interesting look at behind the scenes of what it took to make his images. SPOILER ALERT: I was very surprised to see that Gregory never was actually the one who pushed the shutter and focused the camera at the work, only the director of all of the subjects within and around the frame. It's worth a look if you enjoy photography. The cinematography is a very cheap 1990's era video style which was disappointing.",1487721600,,437,4.475
8567845,5,B00BFWKE76,"I had to watch this movie for an art appreciation class I am taking.  I had never heard of Gregory Crewdson before taking this class.  If I do not learn anything else in the class, it will have been worth it just for learning about him, his photographs, and this movie.

Gregory Crewdson's photographs are so beautiful.  That is an incomplete, inadequate description, but that's what it boils down to.  It is so interesting to see what goes into making these photographs a reality and a chance at learning a little about Gregory's thought process.

This movie will appeal to anyone who is interested in photography, movie making, and to those who find beauty in our everyday world.

Do yourself a favor and see this movie.",1476403200,5,722,4.682539682539683
8567846,3,B00BFWKE76,"Interesting from a photographer's perspective, but probably not that appealing to a wider audience.",1475539200,,99,6.142857142857143

8567849,5,B00BFWKE76,"Loved, loved, loved Crewdson's photography.  One of the most impacting photography books that treats the artist as well as the art he produces  honestly and sensitively.",1461456000,2,169,5.461538461538462
