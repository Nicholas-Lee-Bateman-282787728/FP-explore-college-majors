1808378,5,B00007G1V9,"Juana De Loca, or Mad Love, is one of those movies that you end up watching and become released into and willingly lost in. this is how powerfull movies all are. this movie has so much passion in it i could not help but come to BECOME TOUCHED myself, brought to passions mighty edge. this movie is very captivating its too easy to fall in love with the look of the characters alone, let alone the beautifull sets, and scenery. this is to say nothing about the Acting, because it was flawless! every character worked perfect, you forget your watching a movie. you know those movies where the actors cannot carry the part or even worse aren't right for a part and cannot even act? this is not one of those movies!
it was majestic, inspiring and brimming with beauty.
so much passion, if i could use one word to describe it, would have to be passionate.. but then i would go on and change my mind again later,then back again driven, just as this film has the ability to move the viewer backwards and forwards towards all its parts of perfection in every detail - never to be forgotten. 5 stars PERIOD",1089504000,8,1097,4.4088669950738915
1808379,5,B00007G1V9,"It is a pity that this movie has lost its essential title of ""Juana la Loca"" for ""Mad Love""... it definitely detracts from the appeal of picking it up off the shelf. I saw the movie when it was released in Granada, Spain in Fall 2001. I have never forgotten it. It is an incredible, sweeping film and fascinating to watch. I'm not sure if it's subtitled or not, but regardless, it is a gorgeous and sexy film.
There seems to be so little on Juana's life in terms of English material, that this film provides an interesting glimpse into her life. Very, very good movie.",1081728000,6,568,4.367924528301887
1808380,5,B00007G1V9,"RECOMMENDED for anyone who enjoys a well-directed, historical film.  Aranda fills this film with accurate details and with an interesting contemporary and feminist twist.  His interest in forlorn love is at its best here, utilizing one of the lesser-known, but significant personages (among those in the U.S.,) as a tour-de-force vehicle into the narrow-minded, fickle, and antiquated Spanish 15-th century concept of women.
Though Aranda is notorious for explicit sexual portrayals, the ones in this film are not excessive nor senseless.  Everything seems to have its place, and is quite believeable.  FIVE STARS!!!",1078876800,15,616,5.591397849462366
1808381,2,B00007G1V9,"Pilar de Ayala is the main saving grace of this movie, namely her huge expressive eyes and flawless naked body of which we get a couple of deliciously lingering glimpses.
Otherwise this film is hard to sit through.  It reminded me of another vomit-inducer, ""Breaking the Waves:"" after about the first 15 minutes it's painfully obvious that this poor girl's all-too-pure/passionate/devoted heart is going to be torn to pieces over a hopeless, undeserving scoundrel of a husband.  Namely: she's madly, obsessively in love (and lust) with him but he can't reciprocate with the same...probably because he can't stop boinking other luscious young women left and right.  In many ways a very Catholic movie: we are supposed to be deeply moved and edified by watching a hapless twit of a lamb get crucified on the altar of her sacred heart's insatiable LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE!
That's it.  Have fun watching Jesus bleed to death on her cross for about 2 hours.  All the beautiful costumes and scenery can't save this one.
Instead I'd strongly recommend one of Vincente Aranda's first movies, ""Lovers,"" which also touches on this theme but is far more complex, original and unpredictable.  It was beautifully existential; in contrast ""Mad Love"" is basically a one-dimensional ""For Dummies"" version.",1078358400,6,1281,5.164251207729468
1808382,5,B00007G1V9,great story from beginning to end. this movie is definitely a keeper.,1059868800,,69,4.833333333333333
1808383,5,B00007G1V9,"I will not go on about the story of this film, as it has been very well reviewed by others, needless to say it is an excellent period piece, very well acted an directed..another film from this new Spanish cinema revival, where many new directors are finally having the opportunity to share their talents with cinema lovers worldwide. I just like to mention how misleading the sexual element is, plastered all over the DVD.
Intimacy, Romance X, Sex and Lucia or the Ages of Lulu it is certainly not. What sex scenes  and nudity there is are very tame in comparison to the above mentioned films.
Certainly there is a lot of passion, but expressed very well by the actors more emotionally than graphically.
So don't believe the marketing hype about the 'sex' in this film, and instead watch it as it truly is, a wonderful drama from very talented actors and director.",1047513600,11,864,4.647058823529412
1808384,5,B00007G1V9,"Juana la Loca remains on of Spain's most interesting royal characters.  Her life has been canonized by Opera, by books, and by previous films. None of these approaches the quality of this very fine period piece as directed by Vicente Aranda.  Whether or not the young daughter of Queen Isabella travelled her inherited genes of 'madness' when she goes to Flanders to marry Phillip of Austria is a matter of interpretation to this day. If the delirious, blind passion for her husband and the accompanying jealousy and rage induced by Phillip's infidelities is categorized as 'madness', then mad she was. Aranda presents both sides of this marriage bed conflict  in a way that we feel for both character's needs.  As Juana, Pilar Lopez de Ayala is extraordinary in her grasp of the vulnerability of the Queen and Daniele Liotti not only acts his role as womanizer convincingly, he also has the appearance physicallly of a man women would desire even to the point of madness!  The supporting cast is excellent, never teetering on caricature.  The reconstruction of castles, costumes, and lighting make this film a visual delight.  In every way this is a superb movie that embellishes everyone's knowledge of 16th Century Europe.  Highly Recommended.",1044921600,9,1246,5.04390243902439
1808385,5,B00007G1V9,"In 2001, for six months, I was studying abroad in Sevilla, Spain.... and every Sat. or at least 2 times a month, I would go to the movies to get more of a feel of Spanish and Juana la Loca or Mad Love was a major hit in Spain. I saw it and fell in love with the movie; plus, I am a history major so, I love this sort of thing. However, after I saw it, I thought to myself ""I can't wait for it to come out in the states!"" and guess what? It did not and I kept waiting and waiting and now I checked Amazon.com for the heck of it and it is going to come out in Jan! It is a great historical movie and yes most of the facts are accurate... now did she go mental crazy??? or wast it just for love??
you have to see this movie!!

1808402,5,B00007G1V9,"This is an excellent historical portrayal of Joanna the Mad (Juana La Loca).  For those unaware, Joanna was the mother of Charles V and the great-great-great grandmother of Louis XIV (Sun King).  Joanna is also the daughter of Queen Isabella.  Although it is believed the ""mad"" gene was carried on the maternal side and contracted from her maternal grandmother, it is also understood that those in power feared having Joanna as Queen or Holy Roman Empress.  Great and true story.  Good acting also.",1416873600,,498,4.951807228915663

1808406,5,B00007G1V9,"I had no problem with this movie being in Spanish with English captions.  I LOVE history and the sound of the Spanish language.  Personally, I think that Juana was most likely Bipolar, but there were no prescription drugs back then to help keep her ""balanced out"".  Most of the movie showed instances of her infatuation with her husband, ""Philip the Handsome"", who was really ""Philip the Philandering Pig"".  I wished the movie could have been longer and I would have loved if it showed more about the interactions she had with her children. Like when her son Charles and her daughter Eleanor visited her.  And how her son Ferdinand was snatched from her by her scheming father. Also, more about the relationship she had with her youngest child, daughter Catalina, who lived with her for quite a few years in virtual confinement. The acting was superb.

1808420,5,B00007G1V9,"Excellent historical movie about the love of Queen Juana (Joan) of Castile. If, like myself, you've read a bit about the so-called ""Mad queen of Castile,"" then this movie will be a treat like no other.  The story itself is a gem, but add in the passionate love and vengeful jealousy and you have a script willing and waiting to be dramatically performed.

The acting goes well with the plots and subplots.  This is the story of every woman who ever loved a man so passionately and unconditionally that it blinded her to actual circumstances.  Queen Juana just happened to be such a woman, with much power but blinded by love.  Her reputation as a Mad Queen brought wolves seeking power to her and Felipe's (Philip) throne. For all their faults, you could say they were definitely made for one another and the love they shared likely contributed to their demise.

Mad Love primarily focuses on the story of Queen Juana's love for Felipe, but there's so much more surrounding these two misunderstood historical figures. I urge anyone interested to read up on the two and their royal offspring.",1338854400,,1091,4.746031746031746

1808426,5,B00007G1V9,"This is the best film in my collection. I love historical films. I loved the way they portrayed the main character as a passionate, all consuming, blindly in love (loca)woman. Even after her husband commits infidelity, she loved him. Even after he tried to have her locked away, based on incompetence (insanity), just so he could rule the Kingdom. She still loved him. Even when he was dying from a disease, she still loved him. Very passionate movie. 5 Stars.",1261008000,,460,4.7625
1808427,5,B00007G1V9,"One of the finest films on Charecter Development. Thought I am not familiar with the Historical accuracy of the film, the film manages to capture its time pretty well. Pilar Lopez de Ayala is pure brilliance, she steals the show easily, succeeds in  delivering a performence so mesmerising and wonderful. She is easily immersed in the charecter of the 'Queen' and you can't help but feel every bit of her emotion, pain, sorrow and love. A fine piece of cinema.",1252886400,,460,4.75
1808428,2,B00007G1V9,"My wife and I both agreed that the not-so-merry Juana was decidedly bonkers halfway through the film, but the film's point of view that she was simply love-obsessed drained any other sympathy that might have been developed for her condition. The result: detachment from the characters, indifference as to the outcome, and yawns.

Only the magnificent costumes kept our eyes open.

Maybe those steeped in Spanish culture, sexual sacrifice, and the whore/Madonna dichotomy will find much to enjoy.",1188777600,,495,5.333333333333333

1808432,5,B00007G1V9,"Note: Castillian Spanish with English and French subtitles.

Based on historical accounts, director Vincent Aranda has created a lavish, sumptuous film set in 16th century Flandes, Spain. Princess Juana de Castilla (Pilar Lopez de Ayala) as come to fulfill her aristocratic obligation in an arranged marriage with Archduke Felipe of Austria (Daniele Liotti).

What begins as a great romance quickly degenerates into a very sad and depressing tale of infidelity on the part of Felipe and obsessive compulsive paranoia displayed by the frantic Juana. Juana's obsession with her husbands affairs escalate behaviors that are soon the main subject of gossip for the aristocracy and the labeling of the desperate Juana as ""Joan the Mad.""

When Juana's Mother and older brothers' die unexpectedly she now becomes heir to the throne of Spain. Will she reign as Queen, or will Felipe succeed in having her proclaimed mad by the Spanish court and put away?

Fine performances all around by this all Spanish cast, especially by the two main characters; Pilar Lopez de Ayala and Daniele Liotti. Also in a small but memorable role is the seductive beauty Manuela Arcuri as the Moorish princess Aixa-Beatriz.",1134172800,15,1194,5.203125
1808433,2,B00007G1V9,"One has to wonder if she really wasn't mad . . in her unfathomable feeling for her less than stellar husband.  He was able to find water cooled by ice some 500 years ago, and as soon as he started drinking glass after glass of it, one knew that there was something in that water that would do him in.  And seeing the Spanish nobles so anxious to take the crown from their legitimate Queen made no sense . . . there were too many unanswered questions, and too obvious shifts in plot to make this anything more than a pleasant view of early sixteenth century fashions and mores.  It was not a very good story, not very good history either, and I would not recommend it.",1112400000,8,667,4.2362204724409445
1808434,4,B00007G1V9,"Personally, I think it's terribly unfortunate that Juana of Castile has been reduced to being either brainless or insane.  Considering who her parents were, she must surely have had a highly complex up-bringing (as did, apparently, her mother before her).  It wasn't as if she was just Juana Smith from down the block.
To my mind, something early on set the stage for her extreme behaviour later on.  Her love for Philip looked idealistic, the type that seems to grow in very solitary people.  And the way she locked onto him had IMO more to do with her desperate loneliness than anything else.
Now I might have thought otherwise if Philip had shown any redeeming characteristics - but he didn't.  There was no reason whatsoever for him to be the life-long object of his wife's adoration.  Of course, Juana's problems were immensely complicated by Flemish disdain for Spanish ways and by the political power-plays against her.
Anyway, Juana's suffering was brilliantly conveyed by Pilar Lopez de Ayala.  Her feelings were so realistically reflected in her facial expressions that I felt quite sympathetic.  Juana wasn't weak though.  Pilar showed her to be willful, determined and very aware of her 'station'.  And she was certainly loved by her people.
""Mad Love""  truly is visually beautiful and affecting.  It has a very Bronte-esque look and feel to it, which drew me in right away. I must admit though that the subject matter made me uncomfortable.
It does seem to jump over time periods and exclude obvious characters, but I think it's meant to be Juana's recollection of her feelings from 47 years earlier.",1096329600,9,1613,4.933333333333334
