1819283,5,B00007L4I8,"This was one of the most notorious movies of the 20th century--references to it even made Mad Magazine in the 1970s, surely proof of its universal reputation as forbidden cultural fruit.

It shows frontal nudity, simulated sexual intercourse, and, probably most shockingly at the time, the lead actress Lena (also the name of the character) kisses her lover's (flaccid) penis--in a kind of tender, funny way . . . her gesture is far removed from pornographic imagery, believe it or not.

But the sexual aspect of the movie, which was no doubt responsibile for the fascination it exerted on the American public imagination of the late 1960s and 1970s, has been long ago superceded by standard film fare.

Is the movie still worth watching?  Absolutely.  The main point  of the movie is showing the difference between young Lena's poltical and social views, which are amusingly portrayed as idealistic and Left wing, with her approach to her own love life--which is ferociously traditional.  Lena passionately marches against the Vietnam War, protests against Franco's Spain, and interviews inarticulate middle-class functionaries, putting them on the spot (is this where Michael Moore got his idea for ROGER AND ME?) about the injustice of the Swedish class system.  All this is expected, and would almost be a cliche if it wasn't handled with such humour by the director.  But we simultaneously watch her personal life develop, particularly her love life, and here she acts according to a very different set of values--despite her belief in the power of non-violence in politics, she points a rifle at an unfaithful lover and seems ready to shoot him.  This satire is extended and very well done.

There are also many aspects of the movie, related specifically to the time, which actually enrich the experience for viewers watching in the 21st century.  For example, Olaf Palme makes an extended cameo appearance as a young junior government minister; this is the same man, of course, who rose to become Swedish Prime Minister and was later assassinated with a .44 magnum while walking one evening with his wife, in a crime that was never solved.

On the whole, aside from cheerfully and amusingly portrayed sex that seems almost naive and innocent in today's terms, the film succeeds in asking enduringly relevant questions about the inter-relationship between private behaviour and public political beliefs.  In Sweden, they may have been the stuff of effective  satire, as in this movie; in the USA of the same period, the same basic dynamics played out very differently in the strange scene that unfolded in San Francisco, New York, and places like Chicago and Michigan:  full of political rage, drugs, sexual experimentation and--ultimately--violent crimes.

The mixture of deliberate and accidental elements in the movie (including its historical context) add a subtle, foreboding quality that enhances the satirical, sexy and intelligent tone.  I AM CURIOUS (YELLOW) is an early, and still insightful, movie about Western society and culture.  Highly recommended.",1107475200,77,3070,5.203252032520325
1819284,2,B00007L4I8,"I've wanted to see I Am Curious - Yellow for what, 35 years now? It made headlines back in the 1960's when it was banned for having too much sex. Now I wonder what all the fuss was about. There was a little bit of sex, a little bit of nudity - but only slightly more than Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl. Only the government could get worked up over this movie.

The other 98% of the movie had to do with commentary on excessive militarism (this movie was made during the Vietnam era - the 1960's version of Iraq), Western support for Spanish dictator Franco, and social justice in Sweden. It might have been relevant at the time - and a small portion of it still is - but many of the ideas shown then seem quaint today.

The movie (as well as the Blue version) might be good for historical purposes, but it just doesn't seem entertaining these days. I would have enjoyed it more in 1968.",1098576000,23,888,4.2176470588235295
1819285,2,B00007L4I8,"I saw ""I Am Curious (Yellow)"" and ""I Am Curious (Blue)"" when they were originally released in 1967. ""Yellow"" and ""Blue"" were filmed simultaneously and released separately less than a year apart.
A young female sociologist is taking a survey on sexual mores and attitudes, and this flimsy premise allows her to have sex in various places and in various positions while holding her clipboard and taking notes (sort of like an x-rated Eve Arden).
There's lots of full frontal nudity, male and female, and the two leads are very attractive; but the sex, while explicit and real, is neither erotic nor pornographic which was the whole idea -the point being that the film's ""political message"" is more important and controversial.
I still have the Grove Press screenplays (""with over 250 illustrations!"") and here are translations of some of the signs the political protesters carry:
""Have You Established a New Class System?""
""Even Sweden Once Believed in the U.S. Now We Are Ashamed""
""I like Communism Without Slave Camps! I Like Socialism Without Tyranny!""
""Non-Cooperation! Sabotage! Fraternization! NOW! - A Message to Humanity: Down With Privileged Societies!""
and last but not least:
""U.S.A. Murderers! U.S.A. Get Out of Vietnam!""
YAWN... (...excuse me...)
And here are some quotes from the ecstatic European press which I've edited together into one succinct but representative rant: ""'I Am Curious' accuses, with amazing poisonousness, monarchy, Social Democracy, neutrality, and the Swedish standard of living...[Director] Sjoman's ferocity is despair...he pulls down all the barriers he discovers, including the outermost sex barrier. But the prison remains: the stronghold of Puritanism, nationalism, egocentricity...A naked, desperate revolt againt well-fed, self-congratulatory, hypocritical, blue-and-yellow-flag-waving Sweden....""
Yes, the films caused a sensation and there were ""Freedom of (everything)"" trials in the cities in which the films played (or attempted to be played). They are still too ""hardcore"" to be shown on The Sundance Channel or IFC; but on the other hand they would probably bore people to death if they turned up on the Playboy channel.
As usual, Criterion's presentation is outstanding (can't wait for ""The Honeymoon Killers""!); but if you're looking for cheap thrills or hoping to be politically outraged, this dated ""socially conscious"" wannabe doesn't even make it as an exploitation film.",1059350400,26,2427,5.526881720430108

The film's sexuality was likely avant in the 60s, but it's very tame by today's standards.  Additionally, by the time one wades through the cloying mire of Socialist/Communist platitudes, it barely matters because one is so bored that it's hard to pay attention.  This is NOT a film of a young woman discovering her sexuality:  it's four hours of anti-America prosetlyzing.",1049587200,18,454,4.947368421052632
1819287,2,B00007L4I8,"I AM CURIOUS YELLOW/BLUE got massive publicity and made a bushel of bucks because of the explicit and frank nudity.  The mountains of free publicity made further headlines when it was seized by customs upon entry to the United States and subjected to a heated court battle and banned in cities across the country.

Vilgot Sjoman's document of Swedish society during the sexual revolution has been declared both obscene and revolutionary.

It is neither.  Sadly dated, it is laughably pretentious and boring.  Almost butt-numbing.

Lena (Lena Nyman), a searching and rebellious young woman, seeks to understand 1960s Sweden, as well as her own sexual identity. Shattering taboos of its time and freely traversing  between fact and fiction, I am Curious-Yellow is a two-disc set with I am Curious-Blue, a parallel film with the same characters further blurring the lines between fact and fiction.  Much more sociological than strictly erotic.  It has an amateurish, pretentious, voyeuristic patina was probably not intentional.

This one's for nostalgic videophiles who recall college days skipped to see this taboo film and then sitting around a coffee shop and discussing its deeper meaning.",1049241600,13,1191,5.320855614973262
1819308,2,B00007L4I8,"Not really much of a movie.  Misleading in that it is more of a documentary , and not much more.  Although maybe more when it was originally released.",1391299200,2,150,4.321428571428571
1819309,5,B00007L4I8,"I almost skipped this one.  The film started and it seemed almost too experimental and I had that same feeling I had the first time I saw `Citizen Kane' and the opening (of that film) scared me into thinking that the film was going to being obnoxious and over-conceptualized.  With both director (Sjoman) and star (Nyman) singing over the opening credits about how this was the first movie with two colors (""this one's yellow"") and that I should buy it, I was slightly turned off.

I love art house films as much as the next cinephile, but sometimes I'm just not in the mood for it.

I'm glad that I waited it out.  I'm glad that I let the introduction pass and allowed the meat of the film to engulf me.  About ten minutes in, I was hooked and I could not look away, and it wasn't just because of the blatant sexuality of it all.

Some will instantly refer to the film's blurred lines when it comes to sex.  The film really isn't shy to show you everything, and there are many scenes of simulated sexual intercourse as well as full frontal nudity.  In fact, both lead actors (Nyman and Ahlstedt) have a long argument in the nude, where the walk around, yell, hit one another and make love.  While this is certainly a talking point and something that has made this film `controversial' and `taboo', it is not the only reason (or even the main reason) why one should be interested in this film.  Sex certainly plays a vital role in the storytelling (and the overwhelming theme of sexism and class differentiation plays into the `frolicking') but there is more at play here, and one would be amiss to overlook it.

This movie within a movie within a movie centers around a director (played by the director himself) and a young actress named Lena who are making a movie about a social activist having an affair with a salesman named Borje.  As the film progresses we see the blurred lines of reality and fiction as we become consumed in the fictional love affair only to be uprooted abruptly as we see Sjoman looming overhead, filming in outright jealousy (for he is having a real life affair with his star).

The film's themes of sexism, social equality, social responsibility, political expression, sexual freedom and oppression are seen from scene to scene and are fully expounded on in ways that don't initially feel as heavy as they are.  Lena Nyman and Borje Ahlstedt handle their dual roles magnificently, especially Ahlstedt who manages to show so many layers of physical and emotional presence.  The way his character shifts from flirtatious playboy to dominant lover to degrading abuser to arrogant actor to downtrodden loser is magnificent to witness.

Sure, the shock factor is there.  This film thrives on giving us more than we bargained for, and yet it is so much more than that.  `I Am Curious' asks a lot of profound questions and actually attempts to answer them in a way that feels organic and understanding.  The film, while shocking and abrasive in parts, is often times tender and intimate; a perfect balance.",1381968000,4,3028,4.656015037593985

I Am Curious - Yellow was perhaps the most misunderstood film in a period of transition: Censor-ship days were numbered nearly everywhere. But what the film was about, much more aggressively, was the passivity and ignorance of world developments by the average arrogant Swede. It was meant to insult and ridicule - and did it quite well - the authorities, who had no other lever than to strike through the censor and the police. Like with Fellini's La dolce Vita (1960) under papal ban, this was the best advertisement for the film and for its makers and actors.

The film was very popular at the box office, earning an estimated $6.6 million in rentals in North America alone. Two main reasons: ONE It was first movie with sexual relations performed onscreen that was not confined to the porn movie theaters on 42nd St NYC. TWO It became popular among ""stars"" to be seen going to this movie.

I would not want to guess how many people saw the aggressivness of the movie in political terms: It attacked the Swedish social and political system (including the monarchy), the stupidity of its politicians and the near-total ignorance of the Swedish population about anything beyond their country. It even turned against itself when Soviet dissident poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko could not use the mike at a staged protest: YY told them mildly: make sure the mikes work when you go for the real revolution ...

On the second film - the blue: Quote: The same movie with the same characters, cast and crew as I am Curious (Yellow), but with some different scenes and a different political slant. The political focus in Blue is personal relationships, religion, prisons and sex.

1819313,4,B00007L4I8,"I'll cut to the chase. The Curious films are not for everyone. At times they are boring, pretentious, contrived, and don't make a lot of sense. They are badly written (if written at all), badly edited, and are largely outdated in the political issues they address. Any criticism of these films is valid. However these are darn interesting films that are eminently worthy of the attention of an intelligent and discerning film watcher.

If you are reading this, then you yourself are curious about these films. Are you curious about watching a film in which documentary and drama are combined into a sort of fictitious reality, kind of like modern reality TV shows? Are you curious about the history of film as an art form? Are you curious about exploring European politics from a socialist/leftist perspective in a way that will make you consider the politics of your own country here and now differently than you have before? Are you curious to see Swedish women and men running around the screen fully nude? If you are then you should definitely check out Criterion's I Am Curious boxed set. The Criterion release has some of the best packaging in the industry and is loaded with worthwhile supplemental features, not the least is the director's introduction in which he discusses how and why he made the film in the first place. It is amazing what you can do with a long roll of film, no script, a pretty blonde college student, and a little bit of imagination.",1311552000,7,1464,4.741176470588235

The first hour is a rather dry docudrama in a faux-cinema verite style about the class system that exist(ed) in Sweden. The second half is mostly about Women's Rights and the point of controversy sex scenes are there to show case the gender based power struggles in society rather than as porn. Overall a rather silly and rambling movie, the Pacifist Army Training bit is pure Monty Python - I kept expecting to see John Cleese pop up with his ""and now for something completely different"" line.",1252195200,10,790,4.570422535211268
1819316,3,B00007L4I8,"Vilgot Sjman's I Am Curious: Yellow was seized by U.S. customs when it was brought to the states and a court battle ensued over whether the film was obscene or not. This meant free publicity for the film and it ended up being the highest grossing foreign film in the U.S. until the `90s. Despite the controversy and box-office earnings, many people felt it was a pretentious bore, hardly worth the controversy it stirred up. Even critics weren't very generous in regards to it, with Roger Ebert giving it one star.

This Criterion Collection release features both I Am Curious: Yellow and its little-seen semi-sequel I Am Curious: Blue. Both are presented with flawless picture and sound and include great special features like trial transcripts, an introduction by Sjman, and a brief history of the ""Yellow"" film. Now: about the movies themselves.

YELLOW:
We are introduced immediately to drama student Lena Nyman, age 22 and director Vilgot Sjman, age 42. The film goes from there in an unconventional way combining a loose narrative with a pseudo-behind the scenes storyline. Lena walks around Sweden asking citizens if they feel a class system exists in their country. When Lena sees Vilgot interviewing Martin Luther King, Jr. she becomes interested in nonviolent protest. She begins actively protesting various political issues, particularly the Vietnam War. But it is Lena's sexual awakening that she experiences with Brje that forms the core of the film.

There is certainly an element of absurdity and tongue-in-cheek humor in the film. A sign appears in the film reading: ""Board of Censors. Meeting Censored."" Furthermore, there's a scene where Lena struggles to film a scene of her doing yoga, so Vilgot and the entire film crew demonstrated its ease. The film is fully aware of these little absurdities, but I'm not sure the U.S. censors were.

As far as the film being a tedious bore, I was personally never bored by it...However I wasn't particularly interested in all of it either, especially when trying to piece together its purpose. It's certainly not ""one of the best films ever made,"" as Norman Mailer asserted. As for it being pretentious, I only found it pretentious while watching it as I couldn't see it's important, but once it was over the fact that it WAS important became clear.

While the sex scenes in the film are pretty tame, the nudity in the film pushed the boundaries of what exactly you could show. The nudity is more graphic than what you see in most mainstream American movies today and its clear why it shocked people in 1967. This is what makes I Am Curious: Yellow culturally significant. Sjman's frank handling of sex and full-frontal nudity changed the entire landscape of American cinema (even bolder an accomplishment, being it's a Swedish film). The film's politics are not what people take away from it and they are, in my eyes, irrelevant to the film's story. Lena's interest in politics seem symbolic of her rebellious attitude toward sexual matters and seemingly serves as a way to add depth to the character of a young girl breaking from conventions in a time of both political and sexual liberation. Whether this was Sjman's intent or not, this is the impression I was left with.

BLUE:
This film contradicts most of what I just wrote. This film works as the political counterpart to ""Yellow."" There is sex in ""Blue,"" but the focus is more on political issues at a time where the political climate was changing throughout the world.

In ""Blue,"" Lena and Vilgot discuss making the film and Vilgot informs Brje he'll be doing ""a love scene with consequences"" with Lena. Later, Lena continues asking people about a possible class system in Sweden. Soon, her political endeavors have expanded to issues like the separation of church and state and the prison system. Still, the production of the film occasionally interrupts the actual film.

This film has a more story-like structure than its predecessor, as well as a more movie-like feel to it overall. Though, like ""Yellow,"" ""Blue"" does not have much of a plot itself.

""Blue"" is neither a sequel nor a mere retread of ""Yellow."" Basically, the two films seem like the result of two writers simultaneously writing a script based on the same idea. Both films differ from each other in some way, but basically follow the same concept. The only purely static characteristic of the two films is Sjman's blatantly apparent adoration for Lena.

This film's biggest accomplishment is the fact that it serves as a visual record of the change in attitudes that occurred in the late `60s concerning sex, religion, and tradition.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
The few people who actually watched both films seem to agree that ""Blue"" is the better of the two and to be honest, it probably is. It's the more entertaining one (neither can really be defined as entertaining though), but I personally ""enjoyed"" ""Yellow"" more. This may have to do with the formula growing repetitive to me while watching ""Blue."" These films are not for everyone and I don't think I'll ever be watching them again, but both are culturally significant for different reasons and should be seen by those that care. If you don't, it's best you just find something else.

BLUE: C+",1241136000,14,5239,4.900677200902934
1819317,2,B00007L4I8,"The films are based upon the two colors of the Swedish flag- a scheme that a quarter century later Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski would use to far greater effect with his Three Colors trilogy based upon the colors of the French flag. Neither of Sjman's films are a good film, although Blue is better, for it has a bit better character arc, is less self-conscious, more meditative, and is fourteen minutes shorter (107 vs. 121), but neither are outright horrible films- merely dull and, with time's leveling, pointless exercises in puerile political masturbation. Blue does reuse some scenes from Yellow- such as scenes at a car dealership and a sex clinic. The films just seem sort of pointless all these years later. In retail language, they had a very short shelf life. Artistically, they are Ingmar Bergman on a really bad day, although Bergman was Sjman's filmic idol, and politically they are about as deep as a thimble, larded with the nave Left Wing tripe that the 1960s overdosed on, in reaction to the dying Right Wing Colonialist culture that arose for a last time after the Second World War. That Sjman was 42 years old when he made these lightweight films is the only thing surprising because their ranting is more in line with a teenager's to their parent, when they are not allowed to do something destructive.
  The two films follow the same tale, from slightly different perspectives. The putative lead character in both, Lena (Anna Lena Lisabet Nyman), is a 22 year old drama student sleeping with the 42 year old filmmaker Sjman. The film is semi-documentary, and yet the camera also goes behind the scenes of the making of the film within the film, as well as ostensibly following Lena and other characters, like her onscreen and offscreen lover Brje (Brje Ahlstedt) in places where it could not go, but the viewer is asked to believe unquestioningly. Of course, this mushes up the real, the `real', and the staged, but not in a good nor profound way, and since none of the characters are deep nor well drawn, a viewer really has no interest in sniffing out which level is which, assuming that the levels confuse any viewers of intelligence....Like Bernardo Bertolucci's lame Last Tango In Paris, a few years later, neither of the I Am Curious films have relevance for anyone outside of their generation, which is a surefire marker that the art is bad. The acting is uniformly atrocious- Nyman later had a small role in Ingmar Bergman's 1978 Autumn Sonata, as the spastic daughter, but then faded from film history. Her co-stars were even less successful, and the I Am Curious films deserved their oblivion, for the years' passage has seen what at least seemed bold and innovative get pared down to dull and pretentious. Both films end abruptly, with no power nor insight, and if done to give verisimilitude to their `reality', it seems a waste, for no one really can buy into what either film is selling- just as their self-conscious tv-style hucksterism seems aimed at children, not adults.
  Vilgot Sjman may have made some good or even great films before or after these, but these are a waste of most viewers' time, and do not even hold the historical power that the Up films from Britain do, for those films are real documentaries, while these are mere fantasies of a Utopia that never was, and could never be- as evidence by Lena's simpleminded anti-education raps. Thus leveled, time seeks a new Ozymandias.",1221177600,6,3440,4.805743243243243

This is the best Goddard film ever made, except possibly ""The Outsiders"" by the man himself.  combining fiction, mocumentary and documentary in a dialectic dissection of the 60's these films are a dynamic time capsule, showing us far more about the times and the politics than any spot of frontal nudity could ever accomplish.  The central character's strength of character manages to carry the films quite well, and the director's commentary is largely helpful as well.  I watched these because I hadn't seen them when they came out - though I could have - and felt I owed it to myself to see what the fuss was about.  Once engaged with the films, however, I found myself in an altogether different sort of film than one designed for sexual controversy.  If only films of today spent as much energy on politics, questions, and social commentary!  These films are classics.  The editing is a bit choppy, and the artifice a bit too self-conscious to be seamless, but I still give it a 5 star rating, which I don't like to do very often.",1217894400,6,1207,4.660377358490566

1819340,1,B00007L4I8,"I Am Curious: Yellow (Vilgot Sjoman, 1967)

I borrowed a two-disc set of I Am Curious: Yellow and I Am Curious: Blue, intending to watch both over the course of a weekend. Then I actually sat down and watched the first one. After I was done, I couldn't bring myself to watch the second. There are other movies from the compiled thousand-best lists I've watched this year that I hated as much, but I haven't yet come across one I hated more. It's a plotless mess that aims (seemingly) to combine social consciousness and pornography. It manages to be clumsy, heavy-handed, and entirely artless while addressing both.

What story there is follows Lena (Autumn Sonata's Lena Nyman), a young woman who gets involved with the Swedish nonviolence movement while exploring her newfound sexuality. Yes, that's pretty much all there is to it. Sjoman seems to be trying to ape the cinema verite sensibility of Bresson, Melville, or Godard. To a point, I guess, he succeeds, in that many of the reasons I found this movie painfully unwatchable are the same things I can't stand about Godard-- the willful lack of coherence, the forced absurdity, the absolutely stupid dialogue. The sexual aspects of the film were considered shocking at the time (in America, at least); they're obviously a great deal less so nowadays, though those who miss movies where naked woman aren't shaved will probably have a few moments of blissful nostalgia. Unfortunately, they're few and far between, and require your listening to endless, and endlessly nave, political rhetoric in order to get your meager reward. Pass it up if you're ever unlucky enough to stumble across it. (zero)",1212105600,11,1652,4.938848920863309
1819341,3,B00007L4I8,"The film I Am Curious: Yellow was one of the most controversial films of its time, and the late Norman Mailer praised the film, calling it one of the greatest ever made (or words to that effect).  With all due respect to the late Mr. Mailer, the film isn't one of the greatest ever made (neither is its cousin, I Am Curious: Blue.  Most people didn't even know there was a 2nd film called I Am Curious: Blue.  I didn't.  I had heard of the first one, but the 2nd one, as far as I know, was never really well known in this country).  These films are good and are worth watching, but they are products of their time, the late 1960's, (the 2 films were released in 1967 and 1968, respectively).  With all the upheaval going around in the world, these films talked about sex and politics very openly, which was probably a revelation at the time.  Nowadays, the political talk is especially dated, and is not particularly fresh.  In fact, it's downright irritating at times.  The sex scenes, even for the time, are not particularly shocking.  They are very natural (which is a good thing), but the film's reputation makes it sound like the sex scenes are outtakes from a Ken Russell film.  This film would have probably played a few arthouses in the US and Europe but due to the narrow mindedness of censors and the purtiannical bent this country has at times, the film became a lightning rod of controversy, which stoked the box office take.  I would have seen the film because I hate when things are censored.  Unfortunately, this has led me (and others) buying things that really have no artistic value whatsoever (like Two Live Crew's As Nasty As They Wanna Be).

Seeing the film today makes me laugh at all the ridiculous controversy it engineered at the time.  These films should be seen as topical films of their day, similar to how a standup comedian talks about events of the day, a radio show host, or a documentary filmmaker.  In fact, these 2 films really have a documentary feel to them.  They feel like lengthy news pieces.  Some of the ideas and issues discussed here are still with us, but they are rather tamely presented, at least, to our modern eyes.  In 1967, it was shocking.  Nowadays, not so much.  As other reviewers have noted, this kind of film may shock the most conservative viewers, but for most people, it won't.

If you really want to see some early 70's films that are in this vein and that are still highly provocative today, check out Dusan Makajevev's highly controversial films WR: Mysteries of the Organism and the amazing Sweet Movie.  Dusan's films still are controversial to this day, and at least in the case of Sweet Movie, are still banned in many countries.",1195257600,2,2696,4.5592515592515594
1819342,5,B00007L4I8,"Lena comes up with this great and very apt slogan and sews it in letters onto her bicycle bag.

The point is, she goes about questioning Swedish labor leaders and regular citizens as to the lack of what she perceives to be real esprit d'corps amongst the Swdish population- her feeling is that the vaunted and famous social-democracy is nothing more than a regular capitalist state merely expressing its guilty conscience. And director Vilgot Sjomen, appearing as himself in the film as the director of the-film-within-the-film, questions future PM Olaf Palme about these topics, too.

Also, Lena personifies the ""liberated woman"" who wants to express herself sexually on honest terms and expects the same of her male partners. The re-writing of the Ten Commandments in line with the Sexual Revolution is another expression of this.

And I found this film to be very comic and lighthearted in feel. Lena's got a picture of Franco on her wall and counts the days since her old man allegedly fled the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War (which seemed to capture the flavor of the film, overall: under the portrait of Franco occurs liberated sexual liasion and clutter of neophyte, earnest political activism).

A sweet and comic film which gently satirizes (and also at the same time respects) the idealism of the nineteen-sixties.",1174089600,3,1335,5.027149321266968
1819343,5,B00007L4I8,"I initially got this DVD collection, because of my interest in Swedish culture and language. I knew that in the 1960s this film was unacceptably racy to Americans (but so was Elvis and the Beatles at one time). Nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It is far from smut, it is a candid view at the idealistic nature of the 60s and one woman's journey to find herself. I imagine many of the people who bought these films expected a raunchy sex film and were disappointed at a dramatically portrayed documentary.

I enjoyed the directing of this film, the interesting scenes of city life and the beautiful Swedish countryside. It chronicled the social turbulence and change which was taking place in Sweden. The sexual role of the film is Lena's lack of self-esteem and search for a pleasurable experience in a world of men who want to use her. This portion paints a picture of Lena sacrificing herself to appease male desire.

Overall, I know that some people here say this film is ""unamerican"" which is laughable, considering that much of America itself was ""unamerican"" at this time. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to see an interesting story of the 60s in Sweden.",1165881600,5,1203,4.723809523809524
1819344,2,B00007L4I8,"Unfortunately, I had planned on using as the title of my review ""I Am Bored,"" but George Hatch beat me to it. He couldn't have titled his review any more eloquently. I am very open-minded to films of varying backgrounds, styles, and national origins, and came by the Criterion release of the once controversial ""I Am Curious"" (Yellow and Blue) in an unusual promotion in which I received this box set free from a local bookstore when purchasing another box set. I am happy to report that I did not overpay for this set, but only by the slimmest of margins.

I had heard how controversial this film had been and was familiar with the court cases involved from reading extensively on cinema history, so I was looking forward to seeing what the commotion was about. The court cases boiled down to deciding if this was art or not, eventually allowing that it was. (I think the biggest argument in favor of that conclusion is that this is far too boring to be considered anything else.) While I had expected to discover an angst and obscenity-laden period piece about a young woman's journey during the social upheaval of the 1960s, what I actually found was four hours of unscripted, pretentious pomposity about the socialist movement in Sweden. The film is relentless in endorsing the socialist dogma so prevalent in Sweden in that era, but succeeds more in making the socialists look like a bunch of self-absorbed nits than anything else. The film frequently preaches an odd mix of revolution and non-violence (Martin Luther King, Jr. is even interviewed, though I doubt he would have wholeheartedly endorsed all the positions taken by the filmmakers) and dwells endlessly on whether or not Sweden in a ""class society."" The endorsed positions are actually right out of communist orthodoxy (the lead actress, Lena, is even seen studying a book by Mao Tse-tung at one point): extremely anti-religion, overtly stating that everyone should have equal incomes regardless of job responsibility, training, or personal aptitude, and explicitly condemning capitalism in numerous ""anti-imperialist"" protests which feature such chants and signs as ""USA-Murderers,"" ""Franco-Murderer,"" ""Viva Ho Chi Minh,"" and ""Indonesia is CIA's Gas Chamber: One Million People Murdered."" (The film is especially anti-Franco, particularly in ""Yellow."") In other words, right wing or capitalist societies are a scourge, but no socialist or communist society can do wrong.

Interestingly, while trying to make these points the prime socialists involved present themselves as so eminently unappealing as to make virtually any alternative look better in comparison. Never has this been more evident than in the very predominant scabies subplots (with attendant medical procedures including a bath of DDT, and a piece of music performed on banjo celebrating delousing) featured in both ""Blue"" and ""Yellow."" The intercutting of scenes depicting lack of self-restraint and personal responsibility with the social protests did not further the cause of socialism, certainly not from the vantage point of forty years of hindsight when most of the ideas espoused in the films look historically quaint and decidedly misguided.

The two films were released about a year apart and were cut from the same raw footage, though both are quite different in form. ""Yellow"" was the first released and features more unusual filmmaking techniques, and more interview footage. ""Yellow"" has a device, for instance, where you are supposed to guess the contents of Lena's bag, a game that was the inspiration for my title. ""Blue"" features slightly less social commentary, but a substantially uglier cast and gratuitous pole vaulting. ""Blue"" also features a mind-numbingly lengthy bike ride with Lena (and teddy bear) and some horrific folk songs, including one celebrating Torsten, a prison warden, introducing the subplot about prison welfare in Sweden.

Vilgot Sjoman directed this film and starred in ""Yellow"" opposite Lena. He is actually a gifted director, and by far the cleverest technique he uses in this film is the ""movie within a movie"" device, which sometimes obscures the action of what is actually occurring. For this attempt at making an artistically valid piece of cinema, I give him credit, and I find his commentary to be interesting as well. As with all Criterion releases the extras are superior, and from a technical viewpoint this is the definitive version of these two similar, yet divergent, films.

On balance I finally settled on giving the film(s) two stars: I really wanted to enjoy ""I Am Curious,"" but each time I was about to settle into the plotline I was jolted back to reality by self-aggrandizement and a political dogma that was otherworldly in it's 1960s approach to income redistribution. Maybe the courts were right: maybe this is art. Just remember, though, that like anything else, there's bad art, too.",1150243200,8,4885,5.162878787878788

The other day a friend said during a conversation that she was curious and I immediately asked if she was yellow or blue?  She had no clue what I was talking about and maintained she had never heard of the 1967 Swedish import ""I Am Curious Yellow"" or its counterpart ""I Am Curious Blue.""  It was the former, ""Jag r nyfiken - en film i gult,"" that was at the center of one of the most celebrated obscenity cases of the late 1960s.  The film was seized by Customs because of nudity and explicit sex, although the politics were probably the most controversial part of the film.  The following year director Vilgot Sjman released ""Jag r nyfiken - en film i bltt,"" which offers essentially the same characters but with different scenes and a different political focus.  The significance of yellow and blue is that those are the colors of the Swedish flag, and there is no doubt that these films would resonate quite differently for a Swedish audience in the late 1960s than they would for an American audience then or now.

""I Am Curious Yellow"" focuses on Anna Lena Lisabet Nyman, who has reached the age of twenty and is curious about everything in life.  Her apartment is the ""Nyman Institute,"" and during the film she experiments with everything from political activism to sex.  Lena spends the first part of the film interviewing people on the street about the class system in Sweden (Is there one? Is it a good thing? Why speak Swedish if you are not Swedish?), before she moves on to other issues and other people (both Olaaf Palma and Martin Luther King, Jr. are interviewed).  Periodically the frame is overwhelmed by subtitled (in Swedish) interjecting some humor into the proceedings and other times we see the filmmaker and his crew making the film.  Some scenes are clearly more ""real"" than others, but such judgments are totally subjective and clearly part of the mind games Vilgot is playing with his audience (is the director part of a triangle with the two main actors or is he playing a character who is involved with the characters? Or both?).

As for the sex, maybe I blinked at the wrong point but I do not see how it would be considered explicit.  The nudity might be explicit, but this is not a porno film (at least not by the XXX standard, which is why you will never seen Criterion Collection edition of ""Behind the Green Door"" or ""Deep Throat"").  Except for being filmed in black & white and not having an obnoxious soundtrack, it reminded me more of the sort of soft core scenes that are a staple of late night on cable movie channels; to wit, I think they are faking it.  When Lena's boyfriend Brje (Brje Ahlstedt) tries to make love to her standing up, she announces this will not work.  The couple stumble around with their pants around their ankles and eventually manage to put a bed together.  Facing each other on their knees they proceed as if the mechanics are an improvement over standing up.  We also have the first of several cut aways that defuse the situation.  So I did not see any explicit sex and what I was paying attention to was their inelegant fumbling rather than the scene's eroticism.

""I Am Curious Blue"" shifts the focus to slightly different elements in Swedish culture, such as the penal system and religion.  Lena and Brje have become more domestic this time around, but the times are a-changin', which produces a decidedly different set of tensions in the second film.  It is the lesser of the two, not only because it is privileged second, but because of the fusion of politics and sex is toned done considerably.  Besides, it is ""Yellow"" that was the biggest grossing foreign film in the U.S. for the next quarter century until ""Il Postino"" and ""La Vita  bella.""

As you would expect, the Criterion Collection extras are solid.  The ""Yellow"" disc has an interview with publisher Barney Rosset and attorney Edward de Grazia regarding the legal case, although you want to check out ""The Battle for I Am Curious - Yellow"" covering the whole mess first.  There are also choice excerpts from the trial transcript to read from the likes of Norman Mailer and others.  Director Sjman filmed an introduction and comments on several key scenes.  However, the excerpts from a 1992 documentary on him on the ""Blue"" disc are less that flattering, especially compared to the text of a 1968 interview conducted on the eve of the controversy in the U.S. in the liner notes.  The deleted scene is utterly superfluous.

Ultimately, the film is more interesting than the controversy, but sort of by default because clearly a film making an explicit political critique is going to have inherent social value and is going to appeal to more than prurient interests (the latter will find minimum gratification here any how).  These films are provocative, but the depth, dear reader, might be more in us than in what Sjman hath wrought.  There is so much going on that you should be able to construct your own meaning and given the title shared by the two films perhaps that is what we are supposed to be doing.  Ironically, talking about the films, either in federal court or around a kitchen table, is more interesting than watching them.",1142640000,24,5428,4.646750524109015
1819346,4,B00007L4I8,"Definitely different from other movies released around the same time, which of course did not touch sexual or political issues, even though these were the subject of considerable public discourse and ""buzz"".  The film is still enjoyable to watch, even if at times it gets a bit too ""experimental"" and we wonder if someone just left the camera running and didn't have much respect for editing.  As far as the sex goes, it can't compete with porn-saturated America in the early 21st century, but it reflects real life on a very personal level.  Most films have a puritanical bent when they try to portray sex, what with undies and bras and bedsheets held high and tight across the chest.  ""Curious"" shows us that genitals do get kissed (and occasionally get treated for crab lice with DDT, too!) in the course of an ordinary life.  The political angles in the film have worn well.  There is material here about Swedish neutrality and non-nuclear status, as well as commentary on Franco's Spain.  Other parts of the movie come across as banal...there is some argument about a ""hair dryer purchased at a discount"" or such.

7977914,5,B00007L4I8,"In the 1960s Sweden underwent an enormous social upheaval, which brought it from a rather rigidly stratified and staid society, which cinephiles might have seen in Ingmar Bergman's earliest films, to a place where the old sexual taboos collapsed and angry class war broke out just like in some other Western European countries. The Swedish filmmaker Vilgot Sjman decided to reflect those changing mores (and possibly spur some further more-changing himself) with his pseudo-documentary project I AM CURIOUS. He developed a script through a great deal of improvisation and then shot enough footage to release it as two films: ""Yellow"" in 1967, and ""Blue"" the following year. These titles refer to the colours of the Swedish flag.

The main actress of these films was 22 year-old Lena Nyman who plays... Lena Nyman, a 22 year-old drama student already well into sexual exploration and political commitment. From the home she shares with her alcoholic father, she runs what she calls the Nyman Institute, keeping an enormous collection of files and wandering around Sweden with a microphone to record the reactions of Swedes to provocative questions like ""Does Sweden have a class system?"" and (to holidaymakers returning from fascist Spain) ""What do you think about Franco?"". She has tumultuous relationships, mainly sexual, with suave yuppie Brje (Brje Ahlstedt) and idealistic bohemian Hasse (Hans Hellberg). The films have another layer, however, where we see Vilgot Sjman coaching his actors and establishing a sexual relationship with his lead actress -- but even this layer is fictional. One really admires everyone, director and his actors alike, for being able to play fictional versions of themselves at two different levels.

The two films have a yin-yang relationship, covering roughly the same themes but in different proportions. Yellow is more about political engagement and non-violence in the context of the Cold War, and it attacks the hypocrisy of the Swedish left (which had become entrenched and no longer a force for social change) and the monarchy. That film is set mainly in Stockholm and deals with Lena's home life. Blue, on the other hand, explores the themes of religion and the prison system, and more of it is set in the countryside where we hear some of the attitudes of rural Sweden as opposed to the capital.

Upon their release, these films (especially Yellow) were attacked as pornography, and Sjman as a letch (even though it was the real-life Nyman's idea that there be a subplot where the director seduces his lead actress). However, the sex and nudity here is not titillating at all, rather it is simply one of the many sociocultural themes that Sjman wanted to present and as unsexy as any real documentary. Furthermore, Sjman was really no letch at all -- among countercultural artists, he may have been ahead of his time in confronting the possibility that the new permissiveness wasn't just female liberation, it was also men finding it easier to coerce women into sex by accusing them of being uptight if they didn't put out, something which didn't occur to many 1960s idealists until the next decade. Another way in which Sjman critically examines the New Left is by charting how those who preach non-violence could be very cruel in their interpersonal relationships with friends and family.

I had seen only Yellow a few times and was prepared to consider this only a four-star deal, highly interesting as documentary material about 1960s Sweden, but missing something that truly moved me. However, getting this DVD set and finally seeing Blue provided that moving experience; it is quite impressive how Sjman made the two films interlock with just enough overlap to make it a convincing whole. There's also some latent humour that becomes clear only on seeing both.

The Criterion Collection's DVD release of the two films is very satisfying. Though DVDs can sometimes seem antiquated in our era of Blu-Ray and HD streaming, I AM CURIOUS was shot in black and white with an occasional television feel, and I wasn't usually conscious of the comparatively low definition. There are extras too. Though it isn't a conventional full-length commentary track, select scenes of each film can be optionally overlaid with Sjman explaining some of the context. There's a deleted scene from Blue that is part of Sjman's attack on the state church. We also get an informative 20-minute excerpt from ""Self-Portrait '92"", a documentary that Sjman made for Swedish television about his life and concerns -- he had an interesting education and career. Finally, since Criterion is a North American company, there's is interview with publisher Barney Rosset and attorney Edward De Grazia about the controversy about Yellow in the United States and the legal challenge to it.",1437868800,3,4799,5.10828025477707
