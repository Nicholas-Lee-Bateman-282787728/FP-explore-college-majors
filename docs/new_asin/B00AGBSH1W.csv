8551333,5,B00AGBSH1W,Beautifully shot with an emphasis on capturing artful scenery as much as modern-day railroading. The narration is professional. The video follows the entire subdivision of Cajon Pass from San Bernardino to Barstow.  7idea Productions is producing the best railroad videos on the market today. I highly recommend this!,1512691200,,317,5.604166666666667
