8090078,4,B000BO9ZB0,THIS GUY SHOULD JUST DO ADULT DVDS IS WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN I WATCHED THIS MESS IT CAME OFF AS TOTAL CAMP AND CHEESE WAS EDITED LIKE A ADULT MOVIE WAS KINDA STRANGE DID NOT EXPECT THAT.,1391299200,,183,3.972972972972973
8090079,1,B000BO9ZB0,"This is one of the worst work out videos I've ever seen. It starts off with 10 minutes of the male model posing and smiling while alternately giving the viewer work out advice along the lines of ""swimming is a great way to do cardio!"" If you bother sitting through the ""instructor"" posing and being interviewed, he gives you several exercises to do without giving you a routine to do them in. Some of the exercises are good but he doesn't give you any system to gauge your progress, only briefly saying that you should ""do as many as you can"". Also a lot of these exercises require equipment you're not going to have if you don't have your own gym, so working out while watching the video would be difficult.
If you like watching a pretty guy with a studly body posing while telling you how he used to be skinny in high school, this is for you.",1364169600,2,844,4.314465408805032
8090080,4,B000BO9ZB0,"Fitness Cover model Rusty Joiner shares his personal workout and this brief but helpful video produced by ICON MEN.  If the buyer is searching for a DVD of posing and flexing this isn't the product. But for serious information about how to condition the body against losing the summer muscle to winter fat, this is an inspiration.  As the package insert states, 'Complete with all American good looks and developed chiseled body, Rusty works through his personal routine and teaches you as he pushes, lifts, and curls each exercise - the very routine he uses to create his own dynamic physique. He instructs and then demonstrates exactly how each muscle group responds to his workout. ' And that pretty much tells it all.

Joiner was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia and is currently living in Los Angeles. He is an accomplished gymnast, gymnastics coach, cheerleader and continues to coach cheerleading camps and seminars. With a fitness modeling career that includes ads for Jockey Life, Levi's, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Prada, he was also named the STRUCTURE underwear man of the year in 2001. Rusty has been on the cover of 10 MENS FITNESS magazines as well as numerous other fitness publications. When MENS FITNESS puts Rusty on the cover they see their circulation increase significantly. So get it from a Pro.  Grady Harp, November 11",1321056000,,1344,4.933628318584071
8090081,1,B000BO9ZB0,"This is not a work out video. It is a sales ad. He doesn't do any exercises just talks about them.
A total rip-off. I con men is correct.",1318550400,6,137,3.7586206896551726
8090082,5,B000BO9ZB0,"I own this dvd and 2 others in the ICON male series and I'm very pleased w/the work routines in the dvd's they have been very helpful and I have been seeing results. I plan to order ICON Men: Christian Boeving - Shoulders, Biceps & Chest also..

Thanks Alex",1266364800,2,257,4.244897959183674
8090083,1,B000BO9ZB0,Watching this is similar to reading an elementary math book after passing a calculus class. There is nothing you couldn't figure out on your own just by typing a couple of words in google.,1178150400,,188,4.5588235294117645
8090084,5,B000BO9ZB0,"There's nothing more motivating then to be given workout and fitness tips from a master.  I really got my money's worth from the tips straight from the trainer himself as well as see the miraculous results in his own body.  I definitely recommend.

Rusty is by far the most recognizable and hunky fitness model out there!",1137196800,3,321,4.696428571428571
