8247890,5,B0012V1QTU,"Tambroni does a very nice job of explaining the basics of a motion offense uses the 2-3-1 as his example.  Both the ""chalk-talk"" section and the live examples are easy to follow and are well narrated.  Since different motions are set in different chapters of the DVD, it's easy to find a specific motion you want to review and watch it.  My kids watched sections as well and were able to better understand motion offense before they stepped on the field.  Definitely worth a look.",1209859200,4,480,4.6117647058823525

Concepts are well demonstrated and explained and the visual aids used are top-notch and inspirational. As a coach with 8 years of experience coaching grades 4 through 8, I am taking over the High School Varsity for the first time. This dvd series has helped imensely so far & I can't wait for the series to continue!",1204588800,4,443,4.55
