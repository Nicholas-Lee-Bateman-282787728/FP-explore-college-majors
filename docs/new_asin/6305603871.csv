1052147,2,6305603871,"Yes, the music was good... But in between each song is an interview. And some songs are only partial songs. Ozzy seems drunk throughout and seems obcessed with constantly screaming out the ""F"" word. It would  have been nice if someone would have labeled the DVD with 'parental  guidance suggested'. Ozzy, also moons the crowd to the guitarist's  enjoyment.  Also, the soundtrack must have been overdubbed, the songs  don't always match Ozzy's lips. Maybe Epic could have made a toned down  version or alerted the buyer to the obcenity on the DVD.",951350400,4,546,4.880434782608695
1052148,4,6305603871,"This is one hell of a show that walks you through the lives of Ozzie,Tony, Gezzer and Bill being on the road and the concerts are brilliant. You American and English fans can think yourselves lucky to see such a great  Rock 'N' Roll band, (wish Sabbath would come to the land of OZ  (Australia)). The humor between the band when talking of past experiences  is first class. I recommend this DVD to any Black Sabbath fan. If there is  one draw back its the interruptions of the songs when the band members talk  of how the song came about. This small hiccup is eventually over looked  when you seat back crank up the volume and drift off with with the Masters  of Reality.",950572800,2,671,4.362903225806452
1052149,4,6305603871,"I am a fan of the group. I started playing guitar just to learn every Sabbath's song(I know all of them). I was in one of the latest concerts at London. When I discovered that the band realeased a DVD based on that tour  thought that I should buy it. So I bought it. The live Sabbath Performance  is great, you can clearly hear all the instruments but the sound isn't  perfect(as in Metallica's latest Cunning Stunts). The video quality is good  but also not perfect. The songlist is the best part of the DVD, even  anti-Metal listeners liked that DVD. The angles used can give you a perfect  view of the scene but no multi-angle support is provided.  As other  reviewers mentioned the dialog in the middle of the songs is something very  annoying. That fact shows that the producer just copy the VHS version to a  DVD so he put the interview, which is very interesting, in the middle of  the songs. In any way that DVD is good and it must be bought by any hard  music fan, I rated only with 4 stars because I wanted to show that in  techical terms there are better productions but if you are interested only  in the music you hear then you will hear the ultimate hard music collection  by the fathers of Heavy Metal.",949881600,9,1217,4.323008849557522
1052150,5,6305603871,"I am so surprised by this DVD which produced with latest technology on 5.1 surround and indeed it was a recent wonderful live concert.  I envy those audiences who were able to buy the concert tickets  for the fabulous  days...... Is it really THE LAST SUPPER (last concert)?  It is a tragedy  for us to hear that ?  Anyway this DVD's sound quality, picture quality  are superb, I can prove that by using a high vision 16:9 TV as monitor to  view this concert.  In fact, would anyone be able to say never die, never  being old?  For the sake of reality, all members of 70's and 80's rock  groups are having the ages of between 45 and 50 years.  Thanks so much for  Black Sabbath who emerged for this latest concert, we do love you !  Also  thanks Sony Company who produced this fantastic music DVD with their super  technology for the sound, I can hear the difference ! I hope the groups  listed below who could come out for concerts with production of DVDs :- 1.  AC/DC 2. DEEP PURPLE 3. GRAND FUNK 4. STEELY DAN 5. DIRE STRAITS 6. BAD  COMPANY 7. PATTI SMITH GROUP 8.

1052151,5,6305603871,"My first Sabbath album was purchased when I was in 2nd grade back in 1972. This video was an absolute must for any true Black Sabbath fan. I was very disappointed in the interuptions during the songs. The editor did a grave  injustice to the band by mixing it this way. The line up of songs was a  very good choice, showing us that they could still drive solid. Ozzy is in  great form-His vocals were outstanding. My only wish is that he could have  sang live years ago(70's). Geezer does not show his age at all as he belts  out the bass. Bill has aged and weathered quite a bit but you could not  notice this at all. His hard pounding drums will really test your home  theatre system. Tony is my only disappointment. His sound has not changed  since Ozzy was kicked out. No one can ever duplicate what Iommi can do on  the axe, but in my opinion, he has not progressed his playing in the last  20 years. Ozzy, as everyfan will agree, he skyrocketted. However I think of  the reunion, this is one rock video which is at the top of my list simply  because I am a diehard fan who's dream has come true with an original  Sabbath line up,as short lived as it was. You have to love Sabbath for who  they were, not the mixing quality(?) behind this video. I gave  this video  a 2 stars for production quality but 5 stars because it's true Sabbath!  PS-Iwould have gave it 6 stars if they would have filmed the Birmingham  show. Where it all began back in '68",948326400,3,1453,4.221818181818182
1052152,3,6305603871,"I have been listening to Sabbath for over 25 years, and was highly looking forward to this disc. Be warned that VERY FEW of the songs are heard all the way through without cutting to an interview, or talking overtop the  performance. This happens song after song. The interviews were interesting  for one or two viewings, but to have to sit through that everytime you want  to watch some music is really annoying. At least if the interviews could  have been kept to only between songs you could skip them when you want. So,  there STILL isn't a Sabbath concert video! Also, the sound mix for 5.1 was  pathetic. Listen to Woodstock or Fleetwood Mac The Dance, and then to this.  This is mud. There are only three instruments playing, why can't you  clearly hear Geezer? His fingers are smoking, but it's all lost somewhere  in the mix with the drums. That is what was great about their albums, each  instrument was crisp and clear and you could hear how great a musician each  one is. The director and the sound mixer really dropped the ball on this  one, because obviously the show that they destroyed, was great.",948067200,75,1113,4.565656565656566
1052153,3,6305603871,"The real Black Sabbath together again! Doing some of their classic material. Good sound and video, decent DVD transfer.
Unexpected plus: It is wide-screen format instead of full screen.
Unexpected minus: There  are points where songs are interupted or faded into the background while  bandmembers talk about them. This is totally unnecessary, they could have  easily kept the songs intact by making the video several minutes longer or  by better using available DVD technology. This was annoying the first time  and will be more so in repeat viewings. You may want to rent it first to  see how much this might bother you.

1052257,5,6305603871,"I chose this rating because I give this dvd digital video disc 5 to 10 stars with a 100% percent rating. I chose to review and vote on this because black sabbath the last supper with the videos they perform live is an excellent concert of all time. The band the songs play off the dvd digital video disc is they start with program start Thats the introduction then they lead off with war pigs, n. I.b., electric funeral, fairies wear boots, into the void, sweet leaf, snow blind, after forever, dirty women, black sabbath, iron man, children of the grave, and they close out with paranoid with the closing credits. The band members of black sabbath that performed the last supper were Ozzy osbourne, tony iommi, geezer butler, and bill ward. The concert duration time is approximately 2 hours. I want to recommend the amazon.com customers to buy it because it's something they will enjoy for a lifetime. I want the amazon.com customers to buy it off amazon.com directly off the buyer amazon.com because the customers are guaranteed a 100% percent rating with the dvd digital video disc being sealed 100% plastic. When you buy something off a 3rd third party buyer off amazon.com you are taking a big risk of buying it new because it depends on the rating of the buyer like if it's 100% percent rating it's wrapped in plastic. If it is a 99% percent rating its still wrapped in plastic so the same with a 98% percent rating it's still wrapped in plastic, when it's a 97% percent rating it's still wrapped in plastic, when it's a 96% percent rating it's still wrapped in plastic, when it's a 95% percent rating it's still wrapped in plastic, when it's a 94% percent rating, it's still wrapped in plastic, and etc. When you get below the 90% rating the packaging could be opened not sealed. Like in the 80% percent rating range and under the amazon.com customers would know what I'm talking about. When you buy this item used from amazon.com the direct buyer with a 100% rating you'll get everything, but the third party used from amazon.com watch the ratings like the 100% percent rating, 99% percent rating, just be careful when the rating goes 90% and under. Now the collectible is okay to buy from amazon but just be careful when you buy from a third party buyer on the collectible and watch for the price range on all items from $0.01 used to $200.00 new and up. I don't want to insult the amazon.com customers they could buy from whatever they want its there preference. I hope I get the 10 ten out of 10 ten votes from the amazon.com customers for writing this review with 100% of the votes.",1391385600,,2595,4.5588865096359745

I wanted to hear the music and see the concert. They will not even show 2 or 3 minutes of any song. I was so frustrated I threw the DVD into the thrash. I have no idea why they did not have the concert and the interviews separate. It is like they were purposedly trying to piss you off. What a piece of crap.

1052316,5,6305603871,"If you've been a Sabbath fan from the beginning like myself and you're looking for some insight from the Heavy Metal Godfathers look no further! This dvd is and will always be the definitive documentary on Sabbath. While I will agree the interviews weaved in and around the concert might be annoying to some I personally enjoy them. Sabbath concerts are a dime a dozen but to hear them discuss the band beginning with the "" Earth "" days is priceless and very insightful. I've watched it over and over and love it!
Now on to the concert portion. The band is clearly in peak form and on top of their game here. It sounds like they were never apart. Geezer will always be Geezer, Bill Ward is Bill Ward and Ozzy sounds fantastic all things considered but to listen to how much Tony Iommi's playing has improved over the years since the beginning is the real treat here! Overshadowed early on by Hendrix, Clapton, Page, Beck, Gallagher, Blackmore etc Tony is finally getting some well deserved recognition!

However, just as many previous reviewers have pointed out, this DVD is a big disappointment. What could have been a fantastic viewing experience was instead an editing nightmare. Instead of just playing what appears to be an awesome concert, the producers edited in interviews over the music. Just imagine, you're sitting there listening to a favorite song anticipating a favorite solo and ""gone!"", cut to an interview! I would love to hear some stories from the guys, but NOT during Iommi's solos!! One would think that the producers of this DVD would include these interviews as ""Bonus Material"", but NO! Right smack during your favorite Sabbath song!

Shame on the producers for ruining what could have been a fantastic concert DVD from one of Rock's biggest bands and the founding fathers of Metal!

1052322,5,6305603871,"I've had this DVD on my shelf for a few months, never had the chance to watch it. Finally, on Friday night, I did.  GREAT STUFF!  But then again, how could you expect anything less from Black Sabbath.

Basically, the DVD shows a concert and interviews with the band at the start of their reunion tour, and all four original guys are there, looking a little older, but only Bill Ward noticably different - he's chopped off most of that hair and beard and looks like a pretty typical guy-at-the-pub... except that he's BILL WARD, the legendary drummer of the greatest band that ever played! All the members are in fine form, and the songs are great: War Pigs, NIB, Electric Funeral, Fairies Wear Boots, Into the Void, Sweet Leaf, Snoblind, After Forever, Dirty Women, Black Sabbath, Iron Man, Children of the Grave, and Paranoid.

Of course, Ozzy is amusing, but it's also interesting - and scary - to hear about the guys talking about how zonked they were on drugs. Bill claims he can't remember anything about the ""Heaven and Hell"" sessions, which is amazing - it's a great album. There's an interesting scene when Tony, who's probably told the story a million times, tells the tale of how his fretting hand was badly mutilated in an industrial accident and then actually shows off the prosthetic fingertips that have allowed him to continue on as one of the really great guitarists of our time. Then there's some pretty warm joking around, like when they make fun of Bill for claiming that Black Sabbath were poineers. Yep, that's right, get on the chuckwagon, feed the horses, that kind of ribbing. ""Life and death, man, life and death.""

Learned a few things I didn't know yet, which is basically about how bands that the guys had been in before Black Sabbath were called Rare Breed, and Mythology. Ozzy had attracted Tony and Geezer by putting up a sign that said ""Ozzy Zig requires gig.""",1274400000,3,1892,4.66966966966967

This could have been a magnificent DVD if they had allowed all the songs to play though uninterrupted and save all the interviews for in between or a separate disc.

The mix is excellent for guitar and voice, though.  Ozzy's singing is great, and more importantly Tony's guitar tone is absolutely fabulous, as good as on the records.

Boy, was I in for a suprise! I loved it! Every moment of it!

Plus, I think the editor did a fantastic job! I might be weird, but I really think that the people who edited the DVD must have put a lot of thought into what they wanted to achieve. I find that the interviews tie in wonderfully with what's happening during the concert, and the interviews and concert footage seem to support one another. I think it is very well done.

But, to give the other reviewers credit, I can conceive that if you want to get ""into"" the atmosphere of the concert, the editing will be a detractor and become a frustration. I found that the concert became so intense, that these breathers were actually quite welcome. Shows you - it's a matter of taste.

Both live footage and interviews are superb. The concert footage is clear and the sound is good.

The content of the interview footage is fascinating, to say the least. It is as intimate as any interview I've ever seen, and these guys shoot straight from the hip. Vastly superior to the interviews on ""Volume 1"".

However unlike most, I really liked the way this DVD flows together. Yes the music is interrupted in mid song from time to time, but the way they've done it, truly ads something to the very tune that's being presented at that time. To hear these guys sitting back and discussing what they were/are thinking about each song is truly amazing. To hear the heartfelt laughs from all the members again after years of issues between them is great. They are obviously very happy about the chance to play together again and this show tells you that. The song selection is great and the sound is better than average, but not outstanding.

This DVD is more of a documentary style look at a truly iconic band than  true concert footage. The concert footage, which is great by the way is just the topping to this reunion cake. I unlike many others here, loved to hear from each members of this great band. The tunes only add to the experience.

1052469,2,6305603871,"I've listened to Sabbath for most of my life, and was initially pleased to get the opportunity to see a video of the long-awaited reunion of the original lineup.  But whoever was responsible for editing this video left MUCH to be desired.

Do not expect this to be a live rendition of the REUNION CD's that this concert was supposed to mirror.  The song ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" was omitted entirely, and many of the other songs have interviews with band members edited in the middle of the tracks.  You will NOT see an uninterrupted concert of the show.

This DVD is obviously a ""splicing"" of at least two different Sabbath shows, because there are songs where Ozzy is wearing a shirt or else shirtless in the same song.  It can be a little unnerving.  And, . . . I appreciate crowd participation as much as the next guy, but Ozzy's constantly enticing the crowd to ""go f***ing crazy"" gets irritating FAST - this video and the REUNION CD would have been better without all of the profanities.

This otherwise might have been a great concert to watch, with maybe a second disc with all the interviews and bonus features.  Buy this USED if you are a die-hard Sabbath fan, but I don't recommend that the casual listener invest much into it.",1133827200,27,1238,4.5656108597285066

It started great but I was quickly disappointed when in the middle of the first song the music died because it was interrupted by interviews of the band members.  Why would anyone think it's cool to be listening to a great song and all of a sudden stop the music to hear someone talking?

Just like in 'The Black Sabbath Story Vol II', there are interviews right in the middle of performances. Either they cut to the interview room and cut the music out, or the cameras stay on the band and the music is dubbed over with talking. That is the worst example of how not to make a concert video. Espescially not for a veteran band like Black Sabbath who's music stands on it's own and does not need weak spots covered and filled in with interviews.

However, the performance for what you do see is outstanding. The ORIGINAL Sabbath, including Bill Ward, needs to be documented for rock n roll history.

One pet peeve I have is that the song Iron Man is always treated like a red-headed step child. Either Black Sabbath turns it into a medly with 'Children of the Grave' or the shorten it. I thought I could finally hear and see a live performance of Iron Man in its entirty, but alas, I get to hear interviews instead.

If you've never seen the original Sabbath, you need to get this to see what a great drummer Bill really is.

I wonder if the members of Black Sabbath have watched this dvd and thought to themselves is this how we payback our loyal fans who have followed us over all these years, yes the same fans who spent their hard earned money on vinyl,8-tracks,cassettes and first issue cd's which were also rubbish and the remastered cd's. Surely they must still have the full concert footage why not issue that. Be warned this is the type of dvd you might watch once or twice, when you continually hear rock stars talk about the old days it reminds me of Dell in Waynes World 2 you start hearing the same things over and over again whether on dvd ,tv or in print.

So, when I saw this DVD - I was excited because now I can own the reunion concert. NOT SO FAST. As other people have reviewed this...which I should have read before purchasing...it is parts of it that are live concert footage...but it cuts away to some lame interview snippet in the MIDDLE OF THE SONG!! TYPICALLY OVER TONY'S GUITAR SOLOS!!! UUUGGGG!!! This sucks!!! I was sooo disappointed by this. Don't get me wrong..I want to hear what they say in interviews...but as a separate track. Or give me the option to eliminate from the live footage...so I can watch the band!! I tried going through the entire disc to find a way to suppress the stupid interview clips during each song!!! During Sweet Leaf...I mean they cut it after a few minutes of the song...and never return to it. The clips that come in on Sweet leaf are lame...they talk about it being about smoking pot!!! Duh...like we didn't know that already. Who cares!! We want to see the live concert. All I can say is...for whoever made this disc...you blew it...BIG TIME!!! You should release the entire concert on it's own...no interruptions...no lame interview clips on top of the footage. Stay away from this DVD. The only reason I gave it two stars is that there is some other stuff on the disc that is pretty cool...and even the small clips of the live concert footage are great..and sound great. I just wish they could have done this right. What were they thinking here??? Oh well...I know there are other DVD's from this band...perhaps I'll try one of those.

If you REALLY  want to see what the concerts were like in this tour, try and find a tape from late 1999 of a Sab  concert in a London club; it does not have the same stage presence ( like Sab coming up out of the stage on part of the tour), but it gives a great look at the band in action, with lots of humour and plenty of cool guitar work.",1099526400,,704,3.9857142857142858

Included along with this is an interview with the band.  The interview is interesting, and very funny, but it is broken into several small pieces that pop up sporadically throughout the show.  If you just want to watch the concert, and not the interview, this can be very annoying.  Worse yet, they actually chopped off the entire last verse of ""Electric Funeral"" because of this.  They should have included the interview as a special feature, so that you could watch them separately.
But other than that, this is quite a good package.  The band is in top form.  Ozzy said it best himself when he said, ""We can still outrock most of these young punks anyday"".  I believe him.

If you are an older fan  (like me) and have fond acoustic memories of the original versions of the  songs, you will not be disappointed with this performance - it lives up to,  and even in places surpasses, the original.
fwiw, I personally love  Iommi's restrained and  meditative stage presence!  I really admire him for  'just playing' and channeling the True  Power of the Universe (embodied in  the Cross he wears), and not doing the usual rock  guitarist aerobics.
(just have a voodoo doll handy so when the  interview part stops the  music, you can rip off  the doll's head pretending it is the producer.  This will save your room's sheetrock walls and your own knuckle skin.)
i  would buy again, and recommend to any Black Sabbath fan.
the surround  sound audio mix is very good,  except the bass seems hard to hear in parts.",963446400,7,1174,4.669950738916256
1052818,4,6305603871,"""The Last Supper"" is a welcome DVD to add to the library of any major Sabbath or Ozzy fan--but as the other reviews below will attest, it is quite frustrating to have interviews cut into the end (or in some cases,  the middle) of every song.  Any Black Sabbath fan worth his salt knows they  were once called Earth, that Tony Iommi is missing parts of two fingertips,  that alcohol and drugs drove them apart in the late 1970s, and that at  times it is like a mysterious ""fifth member"" is helping them  write songs.  It would have been much better to let the music do the  talking--and then have full-length interviews with each member as a bonus  feature.
That said, it is great to get the reunited Sabbath doing many of  their heavy masterpieces with excellent camera work and sound (although the  song selection contains nothing from their two finest Ozzy-era releases,  ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" and ""Sabotage,"" quite possibly  because Ozzy's voice is somewhat shot).  Some of the backstage stuff is fun  (Ozzy and Tony doing a run-through of ""Paranoid,"" with Tony  playing through a small practice amp and sounding almost like any  16-year-old kid who just learned how to play the riff).  Having Henry  Rollins do the Epic interview was a cool touch as well.
Now we just need  to have someone release the 1978 ""Never Say Die"" or 1974  ""California Jam"" concert on DVD.  Until then, rock out with  ""The Last Supper.""",962150400,4,1418,4.697959183673469
1052819,3,6305603871,"I'm a fan of Black Sabbath and the concert is really fantastic! But I miss all the options a DVD gives to the viewer! Nearly all songs are interrupted by interviews you can't turn off. I think, there should be released fast a  new version, all the abilities of the new medium are included. For all fans  it is a MUST to own this one, because Ozzy, Tony, Geezer and Bill are in  great form and you dont't know if they will do one more Tour together!",962150400,,448,4.126436781609195

Right in the middle of the song!{:-/**? Well,let's  ask. Who doesn't know about Tonys fingers? Who doesn't know they were  called Earth before? But,why tell us right smack dab in the middle of some  of the greatist rock&roll ever? I saw SABBATH 5 times in the 70's. By  79' they just sucked horribly(live,that is)Ozzys vocals are strong.(but  with filters and processing junk they put in PA systems,they can make even  me and you sound good.(people like David Coverdale appreciate that fact.)  Pretty generic song list,the cd has better. Just hated turning the volume  up and down all the time! You would think they would know that! BUT IT IS  SABBATH,AND THEY ARE GREAT!  SO GET IT!",955670400,,854,4.943661971830986
1052821,1,6305603871,"Yes, all the songs are interrupted by LAME interviews. Fans really need to hear for the 1000th time how they came up with the bands name , how Tony lost his fingertips and other trivia that has been covered in every  interview they've ever done. With a couple of exceptions(Dirty Women,Spiral  Architect) the set list is the same old, tired one that is on every live  album and are the same songs Ozzy and Sabbath have been performing live  forever, BORING. Don't believe what the other Ozzy apologists are saying in  their reviews, Ozzy's singing in the DVD is embarrassingly BAD. Note to  Ozzy: please retire now, your voice is beyond shot. There are no studio  engineers to fix Ozzy's voice when performing live and you get to suffer  through every missed note. It gets worse. You'll notice that Ozzy can't  remember the lyrics to his own songs and just slurs out some nonsense when  he can't remember, despite the fact that he has a TelePrompTer in front of  him onstage. Maybe he needs to wear his glasses on stage so he can read it,  or get some contact lenses. The band sounds like they are playing ok but it  sounds like it was all recorded at a super-loud volume level inside an  echoey arena which doesn't sound so good acoustically. I'm a huge Sabbath  fan but I watched this DVD once before selling it, it was all I could take.  Save your money for when they release that 1970 Paris concert on DVD(I  wish).",954288000,9,1419,4.5019607843137255

Then again, who knows how many of the shows were documented, which is too bad, because Ozzy (despite already gaining his later in life reputation for being a drooling fool) still proved he had frontman credibility in him on this tour, Bill Ward was still on drums, and Geezer and Toni were both strong. The band was newly reunited as well. The show I saw was explosive from three songs in until the very end, and was a visual spectacle as well, and I can't believe in 1999, noone had the real sense to document the tour better. There must be tons of video out there, and just  intersplice it with audio from shows, which does exist, and put a fricking blu-ray out. People will buy it like popcorn.

I'ma  big Tony Iommi fan and I can't believe most of his solos were ruined with overlaid interview footage.  Don't the filmmakers know that we actually want to hear him play?  Is it too much to ask that the songs be left intact and the interviews be included as extras?  It actually makes me angry when I watch this now.  On top of that, the sound quality is muddy and weak.
