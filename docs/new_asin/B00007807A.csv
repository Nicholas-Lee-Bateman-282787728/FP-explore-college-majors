7974223,5,B00007807A,"From my perspective (someone who had serious spinal surgery) this has been one of the most significant teachings I've received in my Life.

Breathing made relaxing and simple! Not only are you guided in the breathing lessons through the mental process, you are taught at great length how each step is physically practiced, how it should feel if performed properly, and taught various feedback methods to ensure proper breathing.

One reviewer here says directly that it is ""eastern slant"" ""new agey nonsense."" While the instructor in the DVD makes mention at the beginning of the DVD about the origins of the technique and gives some insight into those origins- it is the shortest part of the DVD and does not require any belief or change in thought in the at home viewer! I'm really unsure if the reviewer has even viewed or followed along with the DVD!

I am posting to make potential buyers aware that I saw significant and immediate (within 3 days for myself) benefit from this practice that I believe all could obtain. If only I had seen this DVD after my spinal surgery years ago!

Much thanks to the instructor if you ever read this.

Highly recommended!",1316563200,2,1161,4.756218905472637

7974225,1,B00007807A,"Please look elsewhere for information on breathing.  This guy is one of those ponderous types that talks about his ""Acient chinese secrets"" and how you can have all the health benefits of the breathing exercises, all the while being at least 50 or 70lbs overwieght.

 Bad descriptions, no real content, don't waste the money. wish i had gotten a refund.",1119571200,,353,4.85
7974226,1,B00007807A,"I don't know if the other two reviewers watched the same dvd i did but this was a total waste of money. For one thing there was no real instruction on breathing just a view of this man breathing and some poor anatomy computer graphics. Second of all this man goes into a whole health diatribe on how breathing helps you with your health , all the while he is completely over weight.

 If your looking for some pointless eastern slant philosophy with a pure touch of new agey nonsense, then you found your dvd. If you'd like some real world breathing techniques then spend your money elsewhere!",1097020800,22,593,4.481481481481482
7974227,5,B00007807A,I am suprised that this has not been reviewed before.  This is a wonderful DVD.  The quality of excellent.  Things I have tried to learn from book and couldn't are on this DVD.  You can learn Tao breathing with this DVD.  I hope he does more things like this.  I am now able to understand what I was doing wrong and how to do it correctly.,1041638400,28,339,4.0606060606060606
