8314424,5,B001K98MI2,"if your looking for that perfect gift for an anime lover in your life especially a guy you won't go wrong with this. Now that Bandi entertainment is no longer this will be the last time you will see this collection like this more then likely don't kick yourself later buy it, well worth the money if you want something you, or that someone in your life may never see again even if another company picks this series up they won't make them like this again. I just have to say it's worth it in the long run if I had more money I would buy one and put it away.",1355702400,,557,4.027027027027027

8314426,4,B001K98MI2,"The whole packaging of two dvds into one issue with a prize still blows my mind. You get a good chunk of story, and are left BEGGING for more after dvd number 2- and a sweet bag! Being able to add issues 3 and 4 seemed like enough, but no. Each time you buy a new limited edition double pack you get another sweet prize with it. This one includes the drawstring bag with the Gurren Brigade's symbol branded on it and Gurren Lagann in type underneath it. The bag is like one of those Nike gym bags you might purchase in a sports shop. It's not a crazy high quality book bag but it does the trick for carrying a few things here and there. I used it plenty. There's even a zip up pouch within it to put keys and stuff in (Although all the people I know who have the bag have broken that pouch).

All in all, it's an amazing deal and a pretty decent bag. I highly recommend.",1269302400,,870,4.028901734104046
8314427,3,B001K98MI2,"I love the show and waiting for the last set to come out.
I now thing I should of saved the $10 dollars and just bought the plan DVD set. The back pack is more like a draw string bag were they just made the strings longer and looped them through the bottom calling it a back pack but the box it comes in can be used to store all the DVD's of the show.
So I say save the $10 dollars and buy just the DVD's",1241308800,3,404,3.6551724137931036
8314428,4,B001K98MI2,"Everything about This was perfect. I got the item on time, and the show is great. This show is kind of like Dragonball-z (without the endless power-up sequences, and it actually finishes the immediate conflict by the end of the episode) mixed with Gundam Wing. I'm excited for part 3 to come out!",1237593600,,296,4.60377358490566
8314429,5,B001K98MI2,"Gurren Lagann gets better and better with every episode, great dub and the soundtrack is awsome. Definetaly worth buying and the backpack it comes with is great as well. (I recommend it for real)",1234569600,,195,4.764705882352941
8314430,5,B001K98MI2,"Fantastic!

I said it with confidence when reviewing volume 01 and I'm saying it again for ""GURREN LAGANN SET 02' released by Bandai Entertainment.

GAINAX brings us a mecha anime series and having created so many and with so many created for so many decades, you often wonder if innovative, imaginative storylines can still be developed. Well, with ""GURREN LAGANN"", the creators of this anime series manages to create something unique, fun, explosive and just enjoyable.

With this first volume set, we get both vol. 3 (Episodes 10-14) and vol. 4 (Episodes 15-18) of ""GURREN LAGANN"". The popular anime titled ""Tengen Toppai Gurren Lagann"" aired on TV Tokyo back in April 2007 and completed it's 27-episodes by Sept. 2007.

Vol. 3 consists of five episodes and Vol. 4 consists of four episodes.  Vol. 4 is pivotal as it introduces the second arc of the series which takes place seven years later.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Each episode is featured in 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen. The character designs by Atsushi Nishigori are fresh and very different. I truly dig the character designs and the whole anime is quite colorful and looks stylish and pretty cool.

As for the audio, I've watched both episodes in Japanese 2.0 and English 5.1 and as much as I enjoyed the Japanese voice track, when I watch an action-packed mecha, Digital 5.1 soundtracks make a big difference for me in terms of enjoying a series and with that being said, I am very pleased with the English vocal dub. You have some quality voice talent with Michelle Ruff as Yoko (does the voice of Rukia for ""Bleach"") and Yuri Lowenthal (does the voice for many video games and anime such as Sasuke Uchiha for ""Naruto"").  Everyone does a fantastic job on both Japanese and English voice acting.

There is a lot of action, so you do get some good usage from your front channels and some surround usage. But the dialogue comes quite clear and overall, both video and audio were well done.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Unfortunately, unlike volume 1 and volume 2, there really aren't any major special features for volume 3 and 4.  Both come with the textless opening and ending songs and Bandai previews.

I can't help but think how awesome this series was to watch! From the stylish presentation, the wacky humor and the imaginative mecha Gunmen robots and attack modes, the battles and the fun characters and the music, there is just too much to like about ""GURREN LAGANN"". I absolute found the series to be quite fantastic!

If there are any major difference from the last set, there is much less perverseness.  Granted, the series becomes a bit more dark and dramatic because of the death of Kamina, Simon's worsening depression and the introduction of Nia.  But eventually, the series works itself out and volumes 3 and 4 literally becomes mecha porn because it's all non-stop action.  I have no doubt that fans who enjoyed the first two volumes will definitely enjoy these next two.  The series has been nothing short of fantastic.

I have to admit that I was pretty impressed with how the first arc ended but the second arc, definitely surprised of how things have changed in the planet and with the characters.  Really good planning and screenwriting.  Volume 4 leaves with such an intense cliffhanger that I definitely look forward in seeing how this is going to play out.  I want more!  With only nine episodes left in the series, I can't wait for the final two volumes in ""GURREN LAGANN SET 03'.

""GURREN LAGANN SET 02' is highly recommended!",1233619200,12,3498,4.78036605657238
8314431,5,B001K98MI2,"This show reminded me why I started to watch anime in the first place. Big bright eyes, eye-popping colors and bouncy busy animation that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The start of the second arc started with the same fast paced action as the first one had and the storyline keeps you interested. The nice short one-episode battles are also a nice break from what's typical in today's anime. Highly recommended for one who wonders what has happened to anime in the recent years.",1233273600,4,485,4.651162790697675
