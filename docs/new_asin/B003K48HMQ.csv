8398676,4,B003K48HMQ,"I recently read about some of the movies Barbara Eden made after her TV show ended, so I got this DVD. I was pleasantly surprised seeing how good she still looked, and what a good actress she is. She is no Meryl Streep, but she knows her work and is very competent in this movie, and believable in the role. The movie itself is a typical ""Made for TV movie"", but it was enjoyable, although somewhat predictable. It was money well spent.",1392854400,,436,4.329268292682927
