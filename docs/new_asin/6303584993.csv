685254,5,6303584993,"The DVD's are loved by children. I had the vhs ones for my youngest which she loved. In fact one of my older children wanted me to find them for her children, she remebered them, in fact can sing right along with them. Amazon was the only place I found them............Thank You very much my grandson loves them.",1178928000,,312,4.396551724137931

685256,1,6303584993,I bought this dvd for my grand kids .. and they are totally bored by it ..  They love all of the other Wee Sing DVDs.....but not this one,1141948800,7,137,3.7241379310344827
685257,5,6303584993,"My children loved this VHS. The songs were fun,and very catchy. This video teaches children how its okay to be different and how bad it is to  pollute. My children loved this under sea adventure and so would yours.",1031961600,,214,4.487179487179487
685258,5,6303584993,"When I was working in a child care facility this video was an all-time FAVORITE.  From the 2 1/2 year olds all the way up to the 8 and 9 year olds.  It was often requested on movie day, no matter HOW MANY times they  had seen it before.  The songs are fun and exciting and the scenery is  surprisingly realistic for a child's video.  Now that I have a daughter of  my own I am going to buy this video for her.  In my opinion you will  definitly get your money's worth with this video!",955584000,,484,3.9583333333333335
685259,5,6303584993,"This video was the first wee sing video we had and it was given to my toddler by a friend. I was so pleased with it that I was encouraged to purchase all the others. The songs are catchy, and children learn to sing  along quickly. As a matter of fact I find myself singing along too. All the  colors are bright, the characters are funny and exciting and this video is  a must for a young person's library!",918345600,,405,4.10126582278481

685326,5,6303584993,"Great kids video! Watched all the Wee Sing videos growing up. My one year old son has been watching them since he was 3 months old and he loves them! This one is not my favorite, but still has fun music, bright colors, cool sea creatures, and keeps my son entertained. Check out: SillyVille (our favorite), The Big Rock Candy Mountain, and Grandpa's Magical Toys!",1428883200,,363,4.6

685395,5,6303584993,"My kids used to watch this over and over when they were young.  Now I have grandkids and I don't see these WeeSing movies in the stores.  None of the shows on TV hold their attention, but this movie definitely does.  It has songs that stick with the kids.  The quality was good and the arrival of it was very timely.",1387411200,,316,4.131147540983607
685396,5,6303584993,"My daughter LOVES this movie. It has an environmental undertone (not that subtle), but I'm not offended by that personally. I think it's a good thing for her to learn that recycling is a good idea. Glad I bought this one.",1383782400,,221,4.414634146341464
685397,4,6303584993,"This wee-sing does not keep the attention of my grandbaby all the way through, but she watches a most of it.",1383264000,,108,4.190476190476191
685398,5,6303584993,I had the entire Wee Sing video library for my children 23+ years ago.  Most other children's productions are very annoying...All Wee Sing products are extremely entertaining for children and will not drive parents up the wall. I promise your children will be intrigued by the songs and colors (except for King Cole's Party...Our least favorite)  and they will be dancing and singing along in no time!  These are not DVD's you will feel guilty about letting the little ones watch...they promote interaction and are GOOD fun!  I'm now purchasing these for my grandchildren as well as our church preschool.  Perfect  for the rainy/cold weather coming soon.,1380844800,4,654,5.065420560747664
685399,5,6303584993,Our 6 year old loves all the Wee Sing DVDs.  This one is one of the most fun and will get them dancin.,1379462400,,102,3.4347826086956523
685400,5,6303584993,When my son was a baby (16 years ago!!!) he would watch this video without turning his head from the TV.  I bought this for my God-son and I found that both my son and I could still sing the songs!  We love it!,1376092800,,210,3.75
685401,5,6303584993,"As a preschool teacher I can assure you, young children enjoy live action to cartoon type shows. These teach valuable lessons all children should learn at a young age.",1372982400,,167,4.793103448275862
685402,5,6303584993,"Can't go wrong buying ""Wee Sing"" DVD's.  My granddaughter has almost all of them.  My daughter grew up watching them and now my granddaughter is.",1367798400,,145,4.76
685403,5,6303584993,"I have a small daycare, and the children love watching any of the Wee Sing videos.  They are so entertaining with all of the music, songs, and colorful characters.  With the setting being under the sea, the characters are so different from any of the other videos.",1362787200,,264,4.595744680851064
685404,1,6303584993,"The songs are not catchy, all the characters than sing are practically props that only open and close their eyes and mouths (not very engaging with kids)... It didn't keep my son's attention at all.  I'm glad I checked this out from the library before buying it.  We own the wee sing in the marvelous musical mansion (big hit) and my son also really likes the sillyville video.",1362614400,,377,4.529411764705882
685459,2,6303584993,Brought this for granddaughter was disappointed. She loved the old wee sing in sillyville and rock candy mountain. She didn't want to watch this one found this one boring.,1330732800,,171,4.931034482758621
685460,4,6303584993,"A little slower than the others, but still good.  I love all of the Wee Sing items.  I had them on VHS 20 years ago for my daughter, and just purchased the DVD's for her daughter.  She's 15 months old and loves them and sings and dances along with them.",1308700800,,253,4.02
685461,5,6303584993,My 2yr old daughter loves this dvd.  They have great sing along songs and teach our little ones at an early age about pollution.,1294272000,,128,4.333333333333333
685462,2,6303584993,"The Wee Sing Series is TOTALLY AWESOME...but my son informs me (in no certain terms...he's 2) that this Wee Sing product is his least favorite.  Maybe the songs are not catchy like in Marvelous Musical Mansion or silly like in Sillyville, but his attention frequently wanders when watching Under the Sea.",1264377600,3,304,4.96078431372549
685463,3,6303584993,"This is the weakest of the Wee Sing canon, and I believe I know why.  All of the earlier Wee Sings feature familiar children's songs, while this one has new music written especially for ""Under the Sea.""  The songs are okay, but they don't have the appeal of the old favorites we all remember growing up.  The ecological message is a little heavy-handed as well, IMHO.

The Wee Sing productions are fantastic, and my son still enjoys them even at 10 years old.  But if you're new to this series, I would encourage you to start with another title--one of the older releases--to get the true Wee Sing experience.",1261612800,2,609,4.5504587155963305
685464,5,6303584993,This is a great dvd for all children.  Great stories and music.  It has been around for many years and is still popular.,1253750400,,120,4.173913043478261
685465,1,6303584993,very disappointed.  the dvd was badly scratched and you can not view without having to FF through the skips.  misled by seller of condition.,1244937600,,140,4.791666666666667
685466,5,6303584993,"Wonderful! Educational! We first checked this dvd out to take on a trip to the Oregon Coast for our 7 year old granddaughter. We had hoped it would help pre-teach her how to explore and identify sea life. We combined this fun dvd with other educational books. She loved it! Then we loved it! She watched it 19 times in a week, every spare morning and evening moment, plus in the car. Of course she had every line and lyric memorized. So did we. We had to purchase it! Wee Sing Under the Sea is included in our vacation scrapbook!",1233273600,6,529,4.3
685467,4,6303584993,I got this for my little nephew and niece.  They have seen it a couple times and are not thrilled about it.  They're only 1 1/2 years old so they might not know enough to enjoy it.  They like Weesing Park though.,1231718400,,212,4.0
685468,5,6303584993,"All the Wee Sing DVDs are wonderful! I first bought all of them in VHS for my granddaughters who are now 16 and 15.  I have 2 eight-year-old granddaughters now as well as 2 six-year-old and 1 four-year-old granddaughters and 2 four-year-old grandsons. Since the children are in two families and the VHS tapes were getting worn, I was thrilled to find them in DVD.  The songs, the children and adults that interact with the puppets and other undersea inhabitants makes this DVD fun for the kids to sing along with, dance with, and pretend with.  The 8-year-olds even enjoy it. The 6 and 4-year-olds (girls and boys) could watch this and the other Wee Sing DVDs all day.  This is a fantastic purchase for your young ones.",1192665600,,719,4.59375
