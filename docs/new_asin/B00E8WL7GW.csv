5897735,4,B00E8WL7GW,"You'll be amazed at the beauty of the costumes, make-up, wigs, jewelry, furniture, architecture, coaches, horses, chandeliers, and gardens of the era. Likewise, the lives of the poor are portrayed with an equal amount of attention to detail, such as the background sounds of men screaming while being tortured in prison while Le Flock visits the place to make an inquiry of a Medical Examiner's review of a dead body found in the streets.

This TV series begins with the second novel in this series. Unless you speak French, I highly recommended that you read the first book, The Chtelet Apprentice, prior to watching these DVDs.  The reason is that if your eyes are concentrated on the subtitles while your mind is trying to figure out names, people, relationships, etc... you'll miss some of the great attention to detail that makes these DVDs a work of art. The other option is to watch them once by yourself, and then a second time with a friend.

The mysteries are complex, not easy to figure out entirely. Usually, Le Floch acquires some information toward the end of the program that allows him to piece everything together, leaving the viewer engaged until the very end. But the episodes are well-paced, and both the acting and writing are well-done.

The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the series was a bit to ""sexy"" for my taste. I did not appreciate Commissaire Le Floch's sexual appetite or the somewhat glamorous portrayal of prostitution.",1411084800,14,1472,4.8063241106719365
5897736,5,B00E8WL7GW,"The French language police series NICOLAS LE FLOCH first box set that has just been released in North America at the time of this writing is an excellent, beautifully produced alternative to most police procedural dramas on television today. The difference? NICOLAS LE FLOCH is set during the reign of Louis XV (and, apparently in later episodes not included here, Louis XVI). This immediately makes it unique, but does it make it good?

Some of the best period films ever made, including today, are the product of French cinema. Films such as Queen Margot and Henry of Navarre come to mind, or miniseries such as Gerard Depardieu's definitive The Count of Monte Cristo. There is a tone, a flavour, a believability about these and so many other French masterpieces that it is no surprise that NICOLAS LE FLOCH continues that tradition. The locations, the costumes, the wigs, the makeup--everything contributes to a series of 6 films (all feature length) that demonstrate quality and care. In the first film, at the beginning, the camera pans amongst a group of aristocrats. We see jewels, fine details on costumes, extreme makeup including powdered faces and rouged lips (on the men!) and painted on beauty marks on the women, and then someone smiles and we see rotting teeth beneath the veneer. That hooked me.

The first two mysteries seemed a little slow going at first. Perhaps the necessary absence of car chases and constantly ringing cell phones--as in most police dramas--affected the pacing? Or could it be the inevitable exposition that comes with a new series and a new set of characters? Be that as it may, the subsequent episodes more than made up for any initial lag. After all, maintaining a brisk pace in a police drama is essential. The viewer must get a sense that time is critical, that the policeman in charge--in this case, Le Floch--is under the gun to produce results or face the consequences from his superiors.

And of course, Le Floch gets the job done. Though not without stopping for a little dalliance here and there. After all, he is French!

To date, ten NICOLAS LE FLOCH films have been made. Six of them are included in this first box set. They just get better and better and more imaginative, too. One episode sees Le Floch sword fighting with an unseen spectre. It's very well done when it could've easily looked silly. In another episode, an evil count, whose impotence leads him to extreme measures to compensate for his lost sexual prowess, involves Le Floch in what is clearly an homage to the famous story/film The Most Dangerous Game.

One other observation about the incredible attention to detail on display. There is a scene in a later episode when Le Floch enters the room of one of his acquaintances who is in the middle of powdering his wigs. The wigs are mounted on wig stands and are being positively drenched with white powder. To avoid breathing in the powder, the man Le Floch has come to see is holding a long cone device over his face, with two eye holes to allow him to see what he is doing without having to inhale the powder! It is priceless, amusing details such as this that make NICOLAS LE FLOCH a superior program.

Another factor in the success of this series is that the actors are basically all unknown here in North America. This always works in a film's favour in my view, as it makes their appearance in a period setting more convincing. This is not to say that any of the actors are less than outstanding. Jerome Robart as Nicolas is especially good. He is alternately dashing, pensive, romantic, impulsive and, with his roguish grin, just a touch cheeky.

Ultimately, when watching something completely new with the thought of setting down one's thoughts about it later, two questions must be asked: did I enjoy it and why? and do I want to see more? In the case of NICOLAS LE FLOCH, the answer to both questions is a resounding yes.",1406937600,39,3902,4.712609970674487
5897737,5,B00E8WL7GW,"I am disappointed this is in PAL format. The series is soooo great. I saw it on the new MHZ cable channel, a channel only available in a few american cities, and it was excellent! I previously bought a PAL dvd just to watch other european shows and it died so I don't need to go there again. If they make this available in the format used in the U.S. I will purchase it. Wikipedia has a good description of this 18th century French detective, who works diligently, flamboyantly and romantically, for the King in a time before the French Revolution. Just watching the customs, the dress, the food, the homes, the horses/carriages, the social relationships, the sword fighting are all  fascinating enough, but then coupled with really engaging, intricate stories makes this a series not to be missed.

5897757,5,B00E8WL7GW,"A great swashbuckler with mystery and history on its side.  The side characters are goofy, interesting, and charming by turns.  I love the relationship between Le Floch and Bordeau, his right hand man, and I absolutely love the beautiful and independent Satin, Le Floch's most consistent love interest.

I consider the series mostly tame and acceptable for family viewing, however, the last two episodes do start tipping the scales to gratuitous sexuality, nudity, etc.  However, this, I do not feel, is enough to detract from the rest of the story.  This is certainly not light enough for very young viewers, but 12 and up could probably handle most of it.  I would say let the adults watch it first, though, to see how much or which episodes you may or may not want your young ones to experience with you.  It isn't so over the top with sex and violence that adult eyes would be disgusted by it, though.  Some modern movies are just too much, where even I feel a bit sick when watching them.  This is not one of those kinds of films.  In the main, it's fairly light hearted.  Definitely far tamer than the Elizabeth movie series with Cate Blanchet, or Coppola's Dracula.  Way more fun.

Highly recommended is the musical score, which is not only memorable but fantastic!  You'll be humming it after you listen to it.

Costumes and sets seem very historically accurate and are lovely.  Features some strong female characters. English subtitles, which may not always have the best translation, do a decent job and make the viewing for English speakers much easier.  Great product!",1424390400,,1580,4.771217712177122

5897759,5,B00E8WL7GW,"The Nicolas Le Floch TV series is based on a series of books written by Jean-Franois Parot and set during the time of Louis the XV and XVI.

Full disclosure: I know very little about this time period. I have not read the books (but see the last paragraph). The books are very highly regarded as historically accurate.

Currently there are ten episodes (with their length they could be called movies) of Le Floch (2008-2013; new episodes coming in 2014 and 2015), and they are a work of art. A thing to behold. Magnificent. The sets, the costumes, the music, the makeup and wigs, are wondrous. It is beautifully, exquisitely made. There are scenes that are simply breathtaking. An example is after the death of Louis the XV as a despairing Le Floch walks alone, away from the death chamber, while a mass of several hundred magnificently costumed extras move toward it. It is a long, gut-wrenching scene.

As almost anyone who's heard of the French Revolution will know, this is a difficult time (to say the least!). Much of the aristocracy is, if we are to believe the stories here, perverse beyond belief. They perhaps deserved what was coming to them.

Nicolas Le Floch was the illegitimate son of the Marquis de Ranreuil (thus he is referred to as ""Petit Marquis""). He becomes a police inspector under the real-life person Antoine de Sartine, Lieutenant General of Police of Paris, and promoted to Commissaire. Under Nicolas are inspector Bourdeau, and a sort of 18th century Medical Examiner (Sanson). Together they solve crimes with intelligence and serious intent during a time where forensic sciences is in its infancy (if that).

Jrme Robart is brilliant as Le Floch. His acting is superb and he lights up the universe with his smile. He appears to be an excellent horseman and swordsman (although what do I know? At any rate he looks good!). He is a joy to watch. Although as previously mentioned it is a dire and grim time, he seems to be able to keep his humor and his humanity, although clearly he sees the worst that life has to offer.

His compatriots are equally well-played. Bourdeau and and Sanson are trustworthy and loyal, but other characters such as Sartine are duplicitous, even threatening. Not only is it a grim time but dangerous time as well. Many of these wonderful actors and actresses show up in other fantastic shows like Engrenages and Le sang de la vigne.

Near the end of one episode Bourdeau, commenting on the fact that an aristocrat is simply shipped off to his estate outside Paris after committing several heinous acts, asks Le Floch when the law will ever be equally applicable to all. Thus the rub. it is a time of cognitive dissonance when it comes to justice. Le Floch is more than aware of this as he seemingly skirts around the dangers falling all around him and brings in the bad guys.

Thanks to MHz International Mysteries for showing this series, along with all the other excellent shows it airs. Le Floch is well worth your time and effort (the subtitles are excellent but it is a lot of work watching such a visually complex and complicated show with subtitles -- I find I need to watch episodes twice). You can also buy the DVDs from MHz, and if you like the series, I recommend you purchase them as they include additional scenes, and the money goes to a good cause -- more Le Floch episodes being available here in the U.S. when they are released!

If there is one negative thing -- it is the sexual ""conquests"" business. The multitude of liaisons are treated as commonplace. This is probably accurate but it does (as a typical New Worlder) make me a little ""squeamish."" In one episode Le Floch's current mistress announces she is pregnant. He seems joyous. But we never see her again. It seems odd to modern sentiments. In another episode, however, his mistress announces she is leaving him and he is extremely distraught and heartbroken; another gut-wrenching scene. So he is not callous. He just has quite the libido. Ce la vie!

Addendum: since writing this I have read all the available translated Parot novels. They are excellent. I recommend them heartily. Understandably, the episodes don't cover everything in the books, and diverge from the plots -- sometime in significant ways. The characters are (of course) much more substantially fleshed out. The scenes describing food... are fantastic. Even better... Nicolas adopts a little black and white cat (Mouchette), who has not yet materialized in the episodes. Being fond of cats, I smile when she makes her charming appearances in the books.

Worth reading!
