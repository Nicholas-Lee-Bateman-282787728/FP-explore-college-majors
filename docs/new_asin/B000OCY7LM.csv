8184406,5,B000OCY7LM,I used to have a bunch of these on VHS so many years ago.  It was wonderful to be able to buy these and share them with my nephew.  I just wish all of them were available on DVD.,1445817600,,178,3.5384615384615383
8184407,4,B000OCY7LM,Rankin Bass had there own style.  And both of these animated tales show that.  For the most part the stories here are close to the novels they are based on.  Simplified and abbreviated these films are a good introduction to classic literature.,1444348800,,243,4.738095238095238
8184408,1,B000OCY7LM,"Stay clear of this product, it was a very poor representation of the books. Would bore even young children.",1212969600,,107,4.684210526315789
8184409,4,B000OCY7LM,"""Swiss Family Robinson"" and ""Robinson Crusoe"" are the stories on this 45 minute DVD showcasing Rankin Bass at their best in 1971. Check out my detailed review for Volume 2.
Your children will love these, and if you miss the show from your own childhood, you'll enjoy the chance to timewarp back and see it again.
Let's hope the full series release is next.",1212192000,6,356,4.578125
