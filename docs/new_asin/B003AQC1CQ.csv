4104396,5,B003AQC1CQ,"This review is for the Blu-ray extended edition trilogy

these films are my favourite trilogy of all time so naturally I bought the extended edition DVD's when they were released and I would watch them regularly. I had been contemplating purchasing this Blu-ray box set for a while but the tipping point was when 'the hobbit an unexpected journey' came out and I purchased that on Blu-ray. I went back to Lord of the rings and even though the player upscales the DVDs its no comparison to Blu-ray. So I took the plunge and purchased this box.

The picture quality is amazingly sharp, detailed and very impressive, colours are more vibrant and the sound quality is top notch. It's made me fall in love with this trilogy all over again (even though I never stopped in the first place!) and can't believe it took me this long to decide on making the purchase.
The commentary tracks are worth a listen if you haven't done so as there is plenty of extra details they talk about. Hopefully if you are on the tipping point of making this purchase my thoughts have helped in some way.",1366502400,,1076,4.541237113402062
