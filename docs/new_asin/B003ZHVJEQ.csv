i think that the greatest war movie of all time has yet to be made, we need the structure of the thin redline, the philosophy of all quiet on the western front, the intensity and claustrophobia and outlook of lebanon and das boot and the acting of platoon and the production values of patton and top gun.

4234031,4,B003ZHVJEQ,"Lebanon is artfully done. To start the film, the audience follows a soldier reporting to a tankcrew. Once inside the tank, the soldier and audience never leave that environment. The story's p-o-v occurs almost entirely through a tanksight and the tank's interior.

Done by a veteran, Lebanon conveys the confusion of war as well as possible. Certainly, it explores combat's effects on conscience and emotion, both expressed and suppressed. And, yes, political discussion occurs throughout. The dialogue and situations are overall very realistic. Although, I agree with some Israeli Defense Force criticism (in the DVD extras); these soldiers are very freespeaking and insubordinate. Consider seeing Lebanon. Although, I have seen a better film about the same conflict: Waltz with Bashir. Perhaps, make Waltz more of a priority view.

As one might expect, Lebanon is arthouse fare. However, please know that it is neither soft arthouse (i.e. subtle, sensitive, quiet, non-violent fare) nor belles lettres (i.e. esoteric, erudite text understandable only by the tastefully ""educated"").

4234032,3,B003ZHVJEQ,"A very slow moving film despite a lot of intermittent military action with a decidedly anti-war flavor. That is, the soldiers are depicted as guilt-ridden, frightened and brutally deranged. The civilians are uniformly innocent and the victims of wanton cruelty.

The 3-stars are for the movies' treatment of a decades old military operation which had a large impact on world opinion at the time. A few of the characters are also interesting, although many of scenes are dimly lit which sometimes makes it difficult to tell who's who. Will appeal primarily to viewers interested in Middle East affairs.",1296432000,,601,5.13265306122449
4234033,4,B003ZHVJEQ,"Set in June, 1982, the first Lebanon war, Writer-director Samuel Maoz's ""Lebanon"" follows the four twenty-something soldiers on a tank, sent on a mission to a twon just bombarded by the Israeli Air Force. It was supposed to be a simple mission, which of course, it wasn't, as the four characters - the gunner Shmulik (Yoav Donat), the commander Assi (Itay Tiran), the loader Hertzel (Oshri Cohen) and the driver Yigal (Michael Moshonov) - will soon find out.

""Lebanon"" is not about combat itself. It is about ""action"" inside the tank, or emotions of four young soldiers. The outside of the tank is mostly shown as an image seen through a gunsight. Most events of the film takes place inside the tank. The Golden Lion winner at the 66th Venice International Film sometimes even unfolds like a drama on the stage. The camera frequently employs close-ups of the characters (including those outside the tank).

According to the press kit (you can read it on the official site), ""The tank scenes were shot in the studio and the battle scenes at two locations: a banana plantation and an abandoned industrial zone."" To me the film's battle scenes are not very convincing, not because of the shortage of explosions or gun shots, but because the film's intention is sometimes a bit too obvious, trying to direct our attention to whatever the director wants us to see. Also, I know the film wants to focus the psychological aspects of the characters (and I am no expert of military technology), but more detailed look of the interiors of the tank would have helped create a more claustrophobic atmosphere.

I have mixed feelings about ""Lebanon."" I am not sure the narrative device, which itself is surely innovative, is really effectively used here (the hatch will be opened more than once). All in all I was impressed with the film's good acting, and some of the scenes that are intense, but also felt that with a different approach this could have been more so.",1296259200,3,1955,4.77810650887574

I saw the film at the Toronto INt'l Film Festival a couple of years ago.  I was quite moved by it even though I have serious problems with the Israeli military  I thought it was a wonderful testament to the horrors of war, especially from the perspective of young soldiers who were basically kids.

Despite what the reviews say, this movie was not directed by anyone who has ever SEEN the inside of a tank, let alone ever served in one. I could go on forever with details, but suffice it to say that the ""tank"" in this movie is more like the submarine in ""Das Boot"" rather than any tank ever built. Similarly, the movie bears no resemblance whatever to tank crew tasks, tank tactics, or the ""tank experience"" in general. For example, the crew don't wear headsets (how else to hear?) and never once open the hatch to look around (although anyone on the outside can open the hatch and look in at will!). Utterly ridiculous in every aspect. Lastly, the entire final hour of the movie features only the crew members yelling at each other (in subtitles), inside the ""Das Boot"" set. I can't comment on the ""larger"" issues of Jewish guilt etc, but can say with certainty that this movie is so boring and absurd that it will bring tears of laughter! No redeeming qualities - avoid at all costs.",1295568000,12,1062,4.536458333333333
4234037,5,B003ZHVJEQ,"""Lebanon"" is the last of a small crop of acclaimed Israeli war films that addresses the First Lebanese War of 1982. The first was ""Beaufort"", released in 2007, followed by ""Waltz with Bashir"" in 2008. Curiously the first of these movies, Beaufort, depicts the last chapter of the war that involves the precipitous Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon. Waltz with Bashir  is an animated film mostly centered around the massacre of Palestinian refugees in the camp of Sabra and Shatila. Beaufort was honest, sad and difficult to watch due to the slow motion prevailing in the film. Waltz with Bashir is enthralling but morally murky for eventually placing almost the entirety of the culpability of the massacre on the actions of the Lebanese Phalanges. Lebanon, I feel, is by far the best of the three. It has a unique form of presenting its story. The movie alternates scenes of the inside of a tank with views through the gunsight of the gun turret. The four Israeli soldiers inside the combat vehicle experience the events of the first 24 hours of the war in a progressively deteriorating atmosphere, suffused with broken equipment, stench, filth and smoke. Through the gunsight, the audience can visualize the war in its total depravity. The movie does not preach, take sides or sanitize the insanity of combat. The horrific scenes of destruction of property, dead and dying civilians, and unending pain and suffering are only matched by the quick psychological deterioration of the soldiers. The tank crew is not in control of their fate or environment, and there is no attempt to create false heroism or glorify their actions. Samuel Maoz, the director, delivers an astonishing cinematic experience. It is difficult to make comments about this movie that will not involve spoilers. Lebanon certainly more than deserved the Golden Lion Award it received at the 66th Venice International Film Festival. So far, Hollywood has still to match the boldness and calculated delivery of this movie. One may need to understand the context of the never ending conflict between Israel and Lebanon to better appreciate Mr. Maoz's work. Lebanese movies about the Second Lebanese War such as ""Beirut Diaries & 33 Days"" and ""Under the Bombs"" are a good complement to ""Lebanon"" for those interested in this tragic confrontation. Lebanon is not a movie for those who believe that war provides acceptable solutions for political disputes. I wish without much hope that one day the leaders of these two creative nations will attain the insight, compassion and sensibility of their movie directors and bring an end to the hatred and destruction that still go on.",1295481600,29,2646,5.041095890410959

This film does not allow you to do that.  Rather it grabs you by the hair and forces your face into it, much as the war in Lebanon does to these IDF recruits.  They become as much casualties of war as their enemy combatants and the civilians caught in the way.  Rather than setup heroics, we see it from their own eyes as a battle for survival and sanity.

4234050,2,B003ZHVJEQ,"The way to get the most out of this film is to concentrate on attitude. The attitudes of the tank crew, the attitudes of the Paratroopers, the attitude of the command centre and the attitude of the Phalangists.  As for the Lebanese civilians, their attitude does not matter as they are there to be killed.

Given that what is happening to the Lebanese civilians is the most significant aspect of the Lebanese invasion, this omission condemns the film as second or third rate.

But even the attitudes were cliches, and predictable.  There was nothing in the film that allowed us to understand the conflict better than before we saw the film.  I acknowledge that the trauma and barbarity of war affects both sides, the film only shows the one side, and then not very convincingly.

I really liked the way the entire movie took place in the tank and felt very claustrophobic; I think that was a cool and interesting choice by the director and I can appreciate the movie for that.  Also if it was simply the director's choice due to budget concerns I can appreciate that as well; I would much prefer the movie as is verses a dull roar of bad effects or CGI.  Overall I think the ending left a little bit more to be desired; not necessarily more action, but I didn't have quite the sense of troop brotherhood I get from other war movies.

4234055,4,B003ZHVJEQ,"In response to the bad review by Forczyk, he seemed offended by the film's point of view, accusing it of making Israeli soldiers ""look like thugs."" I don't actually agree with that, as I saw more complexity in the soldiers depicted in the movie than Forczyk did. But for what it is worth, I was a peacekeeping (sic) marine in Lebanon in 1982 and the Israeli soldiers I encountered were brutal. The tankers in particular used recon-by-fire tactics frequently. They did not give a damn about the Lebanese and were not worried about wasting a few Americans as well with their Blackwater-in-Nisoor-Square-style tactics. I remember hearing about a marine captain jumping up on an Israeli tank at one point and threatening a particularly out-of-control tank commander with his pistol. (Google it for details, It was not my unit.) Regarding the cinematic depiction of a leaky tank and its dispirited crew, Forczyk offhandedly and arrogantly dismisses this as a ridiculous figment of the filmmaker's imagination, invoking his expertise as a former tank crewman as proof. Well, his opinion of Israeli soldiers is counter to my own personal experience. Unlike him, I do not expand this into any arrogant claims, but just add my story to the mix. As with the soldiers, one can figure that other tankers had different experiences than Forczyk. Perhaps they did not view their machines and their task with as much enthusiasm as he and his crew may have. I certainly have read many accounts of tankers in battle who found a tank to be claustrophobic. With the limited viewing slits available on a buttoned-up tank, it is an inevitable human reaction. It doesn't mean you want to jump out into the maelstrom, just that you must fight in a claustrophobic foul-smelling environment.
At any rate, a veteran like Forczyk can decide a film is terrible, but judge it on its own merits, not through preconceived opinions which he has expanded from past experiences into universal truths!

It was the tech inaccuracies that kept me from going to four stars.

That said, the film is not entirely without merit.

It does a good job, like Amos Gitai's Kippur ( http://www.amazon.ca/Kippur-Widescreen-Liron-Levo/dp/B00003CYBS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1387301105&sr=8-2&keywords=kippur+dvd ), of showing the confusion and, at times, seemingly ad-hoc nature of warfare as seen by the lowest level of the pyramid/pointiest end of the ""spear"".  Do what you have to do next, no need to see the bigger picture because you're too busy doing - move now, out.

At a different level, is this a bit of a parable, with the tankers representing Israeli society, getting fed just enough information to get the most critical jobs done next, with no real big picture view for a lot of people?  I don't agree or disagree with this viewpoint, but just saying there's enough there to merit the discussion.",1387238400,,1103,5.0
4234062,1,B003ZHVJEQ,"Despite what his bio says, it is clear that Israeli director Samuel Maoz has either never been inside a tank (it is claimed that he was a gunner in the June 1982 War) or has forgotten everything he ever saw inside one. The 2009 Israeli film Lebanon, about an Israeli tank crew on the first few days of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982, is easily the worst war film ever made. It is multiple sins: it is completely unrealistic in important details, the characters are ridiculous and unsympathetic and is essentially built around a gimmick, rather than a story. The director's idea was clearly to capture the claustrophobia of tank warfare and the intensity of frontline action through a ""gunner's eye"" view of events. This is not a bad idea in itself, just horribly executed here. For starters, I have never seen a tanker (having been one myself) suffer from claustrophobia; exact opposite - ""man, oh man, am I glad to have all this armor wrapped around me instead of being outside like the bloody infantry."" Tankers love their tanks (exact when they are broken down), and do not treat them like garbage piles as depicted here. The film is also very anti-Israeli at its core, which explains why it was both blocked by the Government of Israel and given an award - for political reasons -  in the Venice Film Festival.  It was an awful choice.

 To begin with, none of the film is actually filmed inside a real tank and the only hint as to what kind of vehicle it is supposed to represent appears in the last few seconds of the film - a brief exterior shot of a Centurion tank amidst a field of sunflowers.  It is clear that the Israeli military provided no help in making this film (why would it? - it makes them look like thugs). It's hard to believe that this is the same country where the best tanker movie ever made - the Beast (1988) - was filmed. It is clear that the director made a tank interior set, which is about three times too large inside. In one scene of the drivers compartment, one can see that the ""radio"" is actually just a plate with dials attached to a wall. The director also seems to have forgotten from his military service that Israeli tankers wear CVC helmets and talk via intercoms - there is no way that the tank commander could direct the driver without it. The water and trash on the floor, the water dripping on the hull inside (from where?), ammunition lying on the floor of the turret basket - these are all horrible mistakes.

 The film is essentially built around the gimmick of the ""gunner's eye view,"" except the view doesn't look anything like a real gunner's primary sight (or 105-D secondary sight). The reticule has no numbers on it, so how would the gunner determine range. Most of the ""sight pictures"" are zoomed in to 100x mag, looking right at people's faces and even showing the hairs on their face. This is ridiculous. The gunner never scans for targets, but instead focuses on a picture, on a dead chicken, on a Seven-Up can. Folks, this is NOTHING like what a real tank gunner does or sees. It is pure fantasy. At times, the director seems to forget how ""big"" his tank is and we see it moving under low overhangs and other times he seems to forget that there is a main gun attached to his sight and that it can traverse so quickly or easily in a city street. The crew never gets out of the ""tank"" - again ridiculous - but other people are constantly coming inside as if it were a bus station.  Israeli tank commanders are known for fighting ""unbuttoned"" so they have better situational awareness and can use their .50 cal machinegun against infantry. Operating buttoned up as in this film, would be suicidal. However, it is clear that the gimmick became essential when the Israeli Army refused to loan Maoz a real tank for his anti-war film.

 As for the characters, the director chose the ""small unit drama"" format and employed the hackneyed formula of internal strife. Rather than a crew, the four men are portrayed as inmates in a small prison, constantly at each other's throats. The gunner - obviously a self portrait of Maoz himself - is a hysterical jerk who sees everything with wide-eyed astonishment. The anti-war sentiment of the film is ham-fisted and presents the hardly-unique notion that war is hell. I believe William T. Sherman said that already. Folks, this is not how a tank crew talks or functions - it is an anti-military caricature. In real combat, these guys would be dead very quickly.

We are seeing more of that these days what with ""127 Hours"" and ""Buried"" among others.  If nothing else, it keeps the budget under control.

An excellent movie that I don't want to see again anytime soon.  It's that effective and thought provoking.",1321401600,,1005,4.472527472527473
4234068,5,B003ZHVJEQ,"I really liked this movie a lot, they did a great job simulating the Israeli tank scenes and what it felt like being inside a tank during combat, very realistic special effects and sounds. I liked it so much I already watched it 4 - 5 times since receiving it a few days ago, lots of suspense and adventure from inside the tank, it would have been a better movie if they had more scenes of the tank crew outside of the tank, another thing I noticed none of the tank crew wore a crash helmet? wouldnt a tank crew be wearing padded crash helmets to protect themselves during the rough ride? I guess they did it so the actors were more visable and easy to recognize, but it's still a great movie, I would recommend buying a used one in excellent condition, my copy was like new and only cost $7.48 and bargain well worth the price.",1316390400,,828,4.246835443037975
4234069,5,B003ZHVJEQ,"Writer/director Samuel Maoz has created in his film LEBANON a statement about war we are not likely to forget. Based on his own experiences, this film about the Israeli Invasion of Lebanon in June of 1982 (the first Lebanon war) internalizes the responses of young soldiers sent on a mission that should have seemed simple but became anything but simple. The reason the film's message is so strong is that it forces four young, virginal soldiers in a tiny enclosed atmosphere where they must by proximity depend on each other to confront the whole question of the validity of war. It is exceptionally powerful.

A solitary army tank and a small platoon of paratroopers are sent to assure that a hostile Lebanese town bombed by the Israelis is secure. In the tank are four soldiers - Shmulik (Yoav Donat), Assi (Itay Tiran), Hertzel (the exceptionally handsome and brilliant Oshri Cohen), and Yigal (Michael Moshonov). They are not seasoned soldiers and what lies outside their protective tank is terrifying to them. Inside the tank is a claustrophobic, filthy, smoky, and foul smelling space where the four soldiers are able to view the effects of war and their tenuous grasp on reality through only the periscope of the tank. Occasionally the lid of the tank is opened to drop in a casualty along with a moment of fresh air to breathe, but basically these four men must grapple with the horrors of killing and destruction outside their tank. The aspects of human frailty that war exposes appear like autopsies on the minds and gradual mental deterioration that overtakes each of these vulnerable and emotionally unprepared young men. They may attempt humor but it is thwarted by the gore outside their iron shield of the tank where Lebanese soldiers attack and mothers suffer the loss of their children in the bombings and shootings of the little village. Maoz wisely places enough of the battle scenes outside the confines of the tank, making the audience as shocked by the atrocities of war as viewed from the exterior as the restricted glimpses of that war available to the tank crew.

This is most assuredly an anti-war film but rather than waving flags of attack and endless scenes of gore, Maoz keeps it distilled and in doing so makes it even more horrific. The cast is brilliant, delivering performances so well crafted that they linger in the minds eye long after the film is over. The haunting musical score is by Nicolas Becker  and Benot Delbecq  and the almost impossible cinematography is by Giora Bejach . In Hebrew, Arabic, French and English with subtitles. Highly recommended. Grady Harp",1313798400,3,2606,4.889140271493213

4234072,5,B003ZHVJEQ,"In 2011, Americans are once again celebrating Wolfgang Petersen's masterpiece of filmmaking about WWII German U-boat crews,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Das-Boot-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Set-Blu-ray/dp/B004SUDQ4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Das Boot (Two-Disc Collector's Set) [Blu-ray</a>]. Yet another edition of the movie was released this year to the acclaim of critics and even a special National Public Radio report on the movie.

By contrast, very few Americans have ever heard of this remarkable Israeli film, which might be described as the Das Boot of tank warfare in the Middle East. It's called just: Lebanon. Don't confuse this with another 2011 release,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lebanon-PA/dp/B004VW4V76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lebanon, PA.</a>, which is the story of an American advertising executive who returns to his hometown. The award-winning Israeli film has just a single word for its English title: Lebanon.

While you could consider Lebanon as the Das Boot of tank warfare, that focus on the military hardware misses the kind of terrific discussions you can have with this film by director Samuel Maoz. Sure, if you're a ""war buff,"" this movie is essential for your movie collection. But here's what makes Lebanon so eye-popping and so sure to fuel spirited conversation: Samuel Maoz was an Israeli army gunner on one of the first tanks that crossed the border in the 1982 Lebanon War. His experiences burned themselves into his psyche so deeply that he worked for years to create this 94-minute drama about a tank crew similar to his own. Watch the extras on this DVD in which Maoz steps from behind his camera and describes the trauma of his own experiences.

I've watched Lebanon with American viewers who don't know much about this film and their first guess is that it's an Arab-made movie. It's certainly an anti-war film and not what most Americans viewers would expect coming out of Israel. Yet, Maoz won 4 Israeli Academy Awards for his production of Lebanon--along with other international honors the movie has racked up. The film's shocking and deeply compassionate scenes ring with the truth of Maoz's own experience. No one could have created this script out of sheer imagination. In fact, if you're a fan of this film by Maoz, you should also consider Amos Gitai's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kippur/dp/B00003CYBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kippur</a>, another war film based on the filmmaker's own trauma.

In my judgment, though, Lebanon is a far more fully realized drama than Yom Kippur. For instance, there's one final scene of compassion between an Israeli and an Arab soldier in Lebanon that's unlike any other war movie you've ever seen--period.

4234074,3,B003ZHVJEQ,"I won't rehash the synopsis of this movie.  I've heard this movie compared to Das Boot it's not even the same class.  The crew in Das Boot never (except one) lost their professionalism.  There were some positives but there were a lot more irritating features to this movie.  I expected a video of a crew as they dealt with the first day of the invasion of Lebanon.  There was no commentary on the why's of the military action and I won't discuss that here.  If the movies desire was to show the horror of war and it's impact on certain individuals it accomplished that task.  In order to do this though, it is as if the writer took a variety of stories of how some reacted and crammed them all into the individuals in this one vehicle.  As far as realism forget it.  The turret was HUGE, wow 4 individuals and a prisoner can all stand around and have a conversation and not be cramped up.  The interior of the tank looked as if it had been immersed in water and fungus was growing everywhere.  I was amazed at the moisture constantly on the bulkheads of the tank.  The oil and water on the floor, what did they leave it open and let the rain get in?  These tanks were sealed against chemical attack.  I also love how the hatch could effortlessly be opened from the outside.  That doesn't happen.  When sealed in the tank commander must open the hatch from the inside otherwise anyone can crawl onto the tank and drop in a grenade.  My greatest irritant was why, if the tank had trouble starting, did the driver kill the engine every time they stopped, he shut it down when they were following the car through hostile territory, even worse the gunner commented the could not fire the gun with the engine off, so why when behind enemy lines did he turn the engine off?  I wanted to scream when the driver had the total melt down, crying to go home when he couldn't get it restarted.  The rest of the crew, well the commander was useless, his vehicle was a total mess, he had no respect from his crew.  The loader was a insubordinate jerk who should could been arrested, the gunner could not pull the trigger and seemed more intent on sight seeing than protecting the paratroopers.  His inaction caused many deaths.  If this movies desire was to show the impact of war on the innocent and combatants alike it succeeded.  I just wish it would have done it with a little less of the ""over the top"" arguments and hysterics, and a bit more attention to detail.  What would have been the harm of the commander opening the hatch, or the tank looking a bit more realistic on the inside?",1307059200,3,2576,4.386075949367089

4234076,3,B003ZHVJEQ,"This film reminded me a lot of THE BEAST, the 1988 movie about a Soviet T-62 tank lost in Afghanistan during the 1981 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  Even more claustrophobic, this compelling drama from first time director Samuel Moez recreates a real-life situation he claims to have experienced during the Israeli/Lebanon conflict of the early 80s.  Most of the drama takes place in the severe, tight interior of the tank as four Israeli soldiers find themselves in a chaotic situation that quickly grows worse.  The men grapple with not only their fear of death and fragile mortality but with their consciences and rising sense of morality -- and mortality.  This is a searing film that lingers long after final fade out.",1299801600,,725,4.966942148760331
4234077,2,B003ZHVJEQ,"After reading reviews here I bought the video intrigued since my father prepped Centurian tanks before the 6 day war to send to Israel in the 60's.  They were in rough shape and he was impressed that the IDF upgraded the armor and the main gun and made them serviceable.  I wanted to get a sense what the tank was like in battle since my father loved driving and repairing the Centurian.  My uncle was one of the key evaluators of the Leopard mk 1 that Canada bought to replace it.  He built a banked test track with various other features to test the suspension etc. The movie Lebanon is really hard to like, first the tank interior is far too big. The cameras had to go somewhere I agree but the submarine analogy fits, the lack of discipline, hand wringing and lack of hygiene displayed did not reflect reality.  As a former infantry reservist I got really filthy on scheme but never got to the point these clowns display.  A commander who won't enforce discipline, a gunner who won't defend himself, a driver who is clueless about his machine. This is not a war movie at all! It is just a protest film! It did not inform, or make me think. The telephoto lense effect of the gun ports was ridiculous like a documentary film crew focusing on stuff they could not possibly see, or care about.  The script is atrocious, convoluted and chopped up. I doubt the director knew what he was doing.  He seem to be trying to exorcise demons and create anti-war sentiment with someones elses money. A total waste of resources! Buy Beaufort or some of the documentaries on the Israeli conflict made by actual film makers. You won't learn anything about the conflict from either the Lebanese or Israeli view points you didn't already know from news reports. Avoid this mess.",1298505600,11,1763,4.539432176656152
8410352,2,B003ZHVJEQ,"As a former US Army tank platoon leader (Desert Storm era but no actual combat experience), I can say that the depiction of life on a tank is totally unrealistic. The crew is shown entirely inside the tank when, in fact, tank crews spend most of the time with their heads out of the hatches when the tank is in motion and outside the tank inspecting the vehicle and doing maintenance when it is stopped. It is extremely difficult to navigate a tank in a buttoned up (hatches closed) state. A tank is not a submarine.  The crew never wears helmets in the movie (probably a cinematic choice) but without helmets the crews' heads would be totally lacerated in short order and they wouldn't be able to hear each other without the intercom built into the helmets. The tank is depicted as totally dark on the inside day or night when, in fact, tanks are brightly lit inside for daytime operations. The level of filth shown is not believable. Most importantly, the tank maneuvers across urban terrain which would be impossible to actually get a tank through including concrete parking structure ramps, etc. As with almost all tank movies, targets are engaged at unrealistically close range. The goal is to engage at thousands of meters. As one of my instructors said at Fort Knox, ""We don't joust with our gun tubes.""  That said, it's an edgy brutal war movie but not nearly as good as the movie ""Kippur"" about the 1973 war. That movie just plain old looks real. Still, this is a good opportunity to practice one's Hebrew.",1524355200,,1515,4.628252788104089

Written and directed by Israeli filmmaker, this film makes the viewer feel as if we are immersed in the war along with the characters. The entire film is set inside the tank itself, which I thought was extremely creative in terms of cinematic decision. I think that this claustrophobic-like experience points out some of the disturbing details of war, such as the fact that we are in such close quarters, none of the main characters ever appear to be within the whole frame. The perspective is interesting as well, because we are literally only shown one view, and some of the moments seen through this perspective can be horrifying. Although I did not enjoy the fact that the film is confined to the inside of the tank, I think it served as a powerful embodiment of the characteristics of war. Other critics state, ""the sweating, groaning tank is a fusion of flesh and machine. The floor of the vessel is a festering stew of foul liquids (water, oil, urine) and decomposing solids (cigarette butts, ammo shells, soda cans, spilled rations). This is what it means to be in the belly of the beast.""",1520467200,,1107,4.682051282051282
8410354,4,B003ZHVJEQ,"The movie takes a raw approach to beautifully portray the harsh realities of war. Using an object, the war tank, to humanize something so often dehumanized, the soldier, was a brilliant move. All that the characters see is through the tank and all that they know is inside of it. But still the fear and struggles and anguish and devastation of war are captured. This can certainly be interpreted as an anti-war film, but ultimately its just a story--one that tells us all the things we already know about war, but prefer not to think about.",1520467200,,540,4.635416666666667

The perspective of the Lebanese war in this movie is viewed from inside a tank, which allows the audience to see a perspective of war that is often not shown. The film displays the psychological toll war takes on the soldiers. From the view of the tank, the audience sees the death, destruction, and devastation left in the wake of battle. The mental toll it takes on the men in the tank are portrayed well by Oshir Cohen, as the film maker captures the intense emotions that are experienced from all the soldiers in the tank. This film is not an easy film to watch or the best produced film, but it speaks for itself. There is no anti-war or pro-war sentiment in the film.

8410356,4,B003ZHVJEQ,"Overall, this film was an interesting portrayal of war. It did a good job of highlighting the multiple emotions that a solider goes through and even showcased how parts of war can be boring and slow. The film took you through the progression of a soldier: the initial hesitation, resolve, facing the consequences of your actions and the actions of the people around you, and the undercurrent of fear that controls the situation. The point of view from the tank did an excellent job of making the audience feel like they are in the tank and in the action too. The dark color pallet also helped set the tone. I agree with another reviewer who said the war was neither pro war nor anti war. It seemed to be an honest portrayal. I did not like most of the characters, most of whom acted like this was the first ever combat situation they had been in (one of them was being discharged in three weeks, so he clearly had to have some kind of experience prior). However in a way, the characters' hesitations made the movie more realistic--people do not know how they would actually act in a conflict situation until they are in it.",1520380800,,1123,4.482926829268293
