4893023,5,B005TZFZLA,"In order to understand this movie better you should watch the first one. Both are great movies on what they propose. Knowing something about the Brazilian society also helps, but this is no different than regular American police and politician corruption kinda movie. Enjoy.",1329609600,,274,5.25
4893024,2,B005TZFZLA,I am sorry.  I like crime and action movies and this one just plods along.  If it wasn't for the exotic scenery it would be unwatchable.,1329436800,,136,4.1923076923076925
4893025,5,B005TZFZLA,"Only my second review on here IIrc, but this film was worthy I thought of a 5 star review.  I took the chance on this rental based on the previous reviewer's high marks, and great overall review, and this film certainly was worth the time and money.

Very intelligent plot, lots of gritty action scenes, and awesome realistic gun play.

This film feels incredibly authentic for a fictional movie.",1329436800,11,396,4.7101449275362315
4893026,5,B005TZFZLA,"Unless you've got your eye on South American cinema, you may not have heard of the 2007 action thriller The Elite Squad, but it was a hit in its native Brazil, and last year, its sequel, Elite Squad: The Enemy Within became the biggest box office seller in the country. One of the few movies to be cut from the Best Foreign Film Oscar short list, The Enemy Within picks up the story from the first installment after 13 years have passed, and its central protagonist, military police officer Robert Nascimento, has been promoted as head of Rio de Janeiro's branch of BOPE. When a prison riot massacre finds him favor with the general public, he's promoted yet again to Sub-Secretary of Intelligence, only to discover that new evil, separate and entirely different from the drug gangs he's put down for years, lurks within the halls of politics. Elite Squad: The Enemy Within isn't one of those ""eat your veggies"" foreign films; it's a bleak, unflinching look at Brazil's underbelly, told with raw, unstoppable kinetic force.",1329177600,2,1023,4.818181818181818
4893027,5,B005TZFZLA,"this is a movie filled with action but I don't know if we should call it an action film, theres extreme gore and theres violence but those are a must in a movie that tells this kind of story. I think this is more of a political film that an action one, it crawls deep into the reality of some countries fighting against drugs and criminality and they don't hold back trying to tell it in a pg13 way, they are crude as they have to be in order to picture the reality they want to describe,and they do it in a way so thrilling that I guarantee you will be glued to the edge of your seat, I know I was. but thats not it, you will also be intrigued by the political aspects of the film which I think is the main aspect and the one that deserves more merit as I found magnificent the way the director sucks you into the character perpective and makes you feel the powerlesness that he feels as a quixote fighting the corruption and status quo. I also found very interesting how the film involves you,without asking you, into the moral and political dilemma regarding the use of represive force to face delinquency to the point that, without noticing, your thoughts will reflect that you are already assuming a position, position that will be surreptitiously challenged trough the film by inviting you to analize the implications of the position you chose regardless which one is it.
botton line: for me this is more than a film, I like to think of it as an experience that will invite you to use your gray matter at least thats what I think so HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1328832000,,1557,4.353951890034364
4893028,3,B005TZFZLA,"The narration tells us what we need to know. The visuals illustrate some of the key points. They're good visuals. The information delivered is good information to know.  The delivery method keeps the audience distanced from any real emotional investment. Maybe that's necessary as audience investment would make a film that would be too difficult to watch, or maybe the filmmakers just didn't hit on a form for the story that could deliver the punch they hoped to.",1323561600,,464,4.948717948717949
4893029,4,B005TZFZLA,"I wasn't even aware there was an original Elite Squad until after I had heard about and had access to Elite Squad: The Enemy Within. The Enemy Within has been receiving rave reviews from pretty much everyone who has seen it. This is the type of movie that sucker punches you in the gut and you never see it coming, but all you can do is smile because that rush is unlike anything else you've ever experienced. Elite Squad: The Enemy Within makes full use of the term, ""thriller"" before turning it upside down and inside out and doing it all over again in a two hour time period.

Some rather interesting camera work is utilized throughout the film. You take notice of it in the very first scene as the camera catches every crack and break in a pane of glass as a car is riddled with bullets. Slow motion is also used in a refreshing kind of way mostly because slow motion has looked the same way since 2006 when Leonidas kicked the messenger into the pit in 300. While this was probably done in a cheaper way since the budget wasn't nearly as big as it was in a film like 300, the fact that it was done differently is what makes it noteworthy. This feels more raw and less polished. The ""size of a tangerine"" scene is fairly awesome, as well. The scene is frozen at one point, but you see that scene from two different perspectives.

Taken, Man on Fire, and The Man From Nowhere; these are a few of the films the action scenes in Elite Squad: The Enemy Within may remind you of. Those scenes when everything hits the fan are the main reason to see this film, but everything in between is so tense that you find yourself easily getting absorbed into all of the events that are going on. Corruption is fascinating in a very disturbing kind of way. This is Nascimento's (Wagner Moura) story, so he's pretty much your guide through this journey as he's removed from BOPE (the Special Police Operations Battalion of the Rio de Janeiro Military Police) and struggles to survive in Rio, but the way his story ties in with the stories of Matias (Andr Ramiro) and Fraga (Irandhir Santos) is rather brilliant as they're both involved with Nascimento in more ways than one. The bloody brutality of the film seems to be lurking around every corner even when things may appear calm.

In The Boondock Saints, Paul Smecker (played by Willem Dafoe) yells, ""There was a firefight!"" during one the most extravagant shootout of the film. Elite Squad: The Enemy Within almost seems to redefine that term. While there isn't a lot of property damage in the film, people get wasted left and right and blood sprays into the air whenever a gun is drawn. People get the hell beaten out of them before being lit on fire and dead bodies are burned as their teeth are pulled to hide their identities. There's a grittiness to Elite Squad: The Enemy Within that many films have barely scratched the surface of.

Remember when you first saw The Empire Strikes Back where you had this fairly awesome movie on your hands that left you with this rather huge cliffhanger ending? Elite Squad: The Enemy Within is similar in that aspect. Elite Squad is obviously going to be at least a trilogy, but it'll be one of those things that will be less of an issue when you don't have a long wait between films. In the meantime though, it feels a little cheap.

Elite Squad: The Enemy Within is a lot like City of God if it was on steroids; there's more action, more intensity, and bigger payoffs. Its biggest flaw is that it doesn't end and is obviously just building toward the next sequel. With an excellent cast and eye-catching cinematography, Elite Squad: The Enemy Within is a compelling look at the underbelly of society that's a must-see.",1322697600,10,3702,4.502976190476191

The entire movie seemed realistic. People fired their automatic weapons in such a way that they wouldn't be out of ammo 8 seconds later. No Bourne Identity car chases (fun to watch, but not very realistic). Corruption was rampant, but there were also good guys.

My impression is that the film makers were more interested in telling this story than they were in making a good movie for the sake of making a good movie.",1372118400,,779,5.824561403508772

On both the DVD and Blu-ray, the English subtitles are hardsubbed. What this means is that you will not be able to turn off the subtitles. Subtitles are useful and rather common on DVDs and Blu-rays, but it's also rather standardized the expectation to be able to disable them. There's really not a good excuse for hardsubs having been used in this release.",1353888000,2,476,4.678571428571429

4893078,5,B005TZFZLA,"We know from our experience that a sequel is rarely as good as its original. But of course there are exceptions to the rule, and ""Elite Squad: The Enemy Within"" (""Tropa de Elite 2 - O Inimigo Agora  Outro"") is one of them. In fact, the 2010 Brazilian movie is better than the first feature ""Elite Squad"" (""Tropa de Elite"") that was made three years before, with faster and more effective storytelling.

To suppress a violent conflict between prison inmates, Lieutenant Colonel Nascimento (Wagner Moura) and BOPE, a military police elite squad of Rio de Janeiro State, are sent out. The mission ends up with blood and death, sparking controversy among the citizens and media, which results in the demotion of Andr Matias (Andr Ramiro), Nascimento's successor, and promotion of Nascimento, who is now in charge of BOPE's operations.

Nascimento dedicates himself to improving BOPE so that he can fight the ""system"" involving drug dealers and bribe-taking police officers, but things are not so simple. Director Jos Padilha weaves an intricate web of characters including corrupt police officers and opportunistic politicians, skillfully keeping us interested in what happens next. The main story itself might be a little familiar, but the film remains interesting throughout, with a slick and suspenseful narrative and documentary-like action sequences.

To me the conclusion was a slight letdown, but that is perhaps because I had expected something similar to the original's ending. But you can enjoy ""Elite Squad: The Enemy Within"" as a stand-alone film, without watching the original. ""Elite Squad: The Enemy Within"" is a first rate crime drama.",1346544000,4,1647,5.2272727272727275

This time around the narration is even better, more organize, and more compelling.
I don't remember when was the last time Hollywood made such a compelling story.
No big mindless explosion, no sci-fi type over the top 3D computer effect.
Just plain old fashion story telling with a strong script and excellent acting on the part of all actors who played a part.
We certainly need more movies like this with a good story instead of just mindless eye-candies.",1344297600,,521,4.8

For anyone who loves foreign-language police and crime dramas you're in for a bumpy, intense ride.  Wagner Moura's portrayal of Rio di Janiero Police Captain Nascimento is one of the best acting jobs I saw in the entirety of films I watched this past year (and that's a lot).  The incestuous cesspool of corrupt politicians and corruptible police officers make Nascimento's job an unenviable one, and while embraced as a sort of people's hero, the congress of corruption see him as the perfect scapegoat.
Moura's performance is nothing less than brilliant and the centerpiece of a really, truly terrific crime drama.  Intense.",1343865600,,737,4.919354838709677

4893082,3,B005TZFZLA,"This sequel to Tropa De Elite lacks the first film's febrile intensity.  This one is more of a thinking man's movie about political corruption, questioning just who are the true criminals in Brazilian society?  While I prefer the first film overall, this one is not without its charms.  Be warned, however: the subtitles in this film are the worst I have ever seen bar none.  Small white lettering often set against light on screen scenery made reading dialogue impossible throughout.  If you do not understand Portugese, be prepared to use the pause and zoom buttons on your remote frequently.  I would have even preferred a hack dubbing job to this.",1341014400,5,651,4.872727272727273

4893084,4,B005TZFZLA,"""Elite Squad: The Enemy Within"" is a very interesting film, and one that I highly recommend.  If by chance you have seen/liked the 2007 film ""Elite Squad"" you will probably like this one as well, although this film has a more complex plot and larger scope, and focuses less on characterization of the individuals in the story.  For those unfamiliar with these films, give it a try - the movie deals with crime and corruption in Brazil, and features many great settings and action pieces.

It is a foreign language film, so be prepared to read subtitles.  I don't watch foreign films often, so at first it is very strange to read subtitles... but you mind adjusts and soon enough you are absorbed in the drama.  And of course, there are plenty of action sequences in the film (the universal language!).

The blu-ray has above-average picture quality.  There are a few moments where the image gets a bit shaky because it was filmed using handheld cameras, but its part of the visual style of the film.  The audio is the best technical aspect of the movie - the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround mix is very dynamic, and there are moments where the sound mix is really fantastic.

The only bonus material on the blu-ray is a ""Making Of"" featurette (45 min).  This set also comes with a standard DVD disc as well.",1339459200,,1308,4.575107296137339

4893086,4,B005TZFZLA,I had heard good things about this film from critic's reviews and word of mouth. So I had been looking forward to watching this film. I was not disappointed. It lived up to the hype. Not only is it an action packed film but it has a great storyline as well. Something that had been lacking in American action films from recent years. Also don't let the fact that this is a foreign film with subtitles scare you. After awhile of watching the subtitles become second nature to you. Once again this a great film.,1337212800,,509,4.368421052631579
4893087,4,B005TZFZLA,"""Elite Squad 2: The Enemy Within"" is the final film in Brazilian filmmaker Jos Padilha's trilogy about urban violence. It revisits some of the characters from ""Elite Squad"" (2007). Lt. Colonel Beto Nascimento (Wagner Moura) is a 20-year veteran of Rio de Janeiro's military police force BOPE. He is blamed for a bloodbath at the Bangu 1 maximum security prison, when one of his officers kills an inmate who is holding a famous left-wing intellectual hostage. Diogo Praga (Irandhir Santos) is Nascimento's personal and professional nemesis, a crusader against BOPE and now the husband of Nascimento's ex-wife Rosane (Maria Ribeiro). When Nascimento is promoted to Undersecretary of Intelligence, he vows to make BOPE into a war machine against the drug trade.

The film follows Nascimento's four-year transformation by the politics and realities of power. He is a man deeply committed to stamping out the violent drug trade and rampant corruption in Rio. He is obsessively dedicated and confident in his abilities and methods. But even the best-laid plans go awry, as Nascimento becomes the victim of the law of unintended consequences, and, at least for the non-Brazilian viewer, the film takes a few unexpected turns. On one level, ""Elite Squad 2"" is an action movie with a stoic, courageous hero and all-too-real gun battles in Rio's favellas. On another, it is an exploration of the complex power dynamic between the city's police, politicians, and criminals. It is ideological, but the complexities of Nascimento's character and his problem are engrossing.

The DVD (New Video 2012): The only bonus feature is a ""Making Of Featurette"" (56 min) that is too long but features director Jos Padilha's explanation of how his three films about violence relate to one another, the actors commenting on their characters, and behind-the-scenes information about making the film. The film is in Portuguese with English subtitles, as is the bonus feature. Subtitles cannot be turned off.",1335139200,,1980,5.242902208201893
4893088,1,B005TZFZLA,In my opinion this movie was senseless.  It was set in Brazil because they wqere speaking Portuguese.  I lost interest in less than 15 minutes.  Lots of violence and no real plot.,1334793600,2,179,4.53125
4893089,4,B005TZFZLA,"Well this full throttle action fest from Brazil should tick all the boxes and as a sequel had more money spent on it than the first. It stars Wagner Moura as Lt. Col Nasciemento who leads BOPE the elite force of non corrupt cops who have been fighting the drug cartels and government under funding.

In this follow up we see Nasciemento and his team going to the aid of a prison riot, where the cartels are doling out medieval justice on each other. It goes very wrong and he gets the blame or takes the rap as we should say in a crime flick . In order to take him out of harms way he is promoted to the Security Ministry to oversee things. This is when he realises that it is corrupt cops that are now the problem and the corrupt politicians that allow these extortions to go on, all the time feeding off the weak and poor in the favellas of Rio.

This is fictional and says at the beginning that it may seem like the recent past but it really is not. Well if it isn't then  it is as close as you can get to a critique or polemic about South American politics without actually being either. We also have the story of Nasciemento's ex wife and son who are now living with a `right on' left wing lecturer come politician who is diametrically opposed to everything he stands for and is driving a wedge between him and his son.

This is not a full on actioner, but when it comes it is done really well and the whole thing has a believability that should be incredible, but I think we are so jaded by corruption that it becomes all too easy to believe. We also have some great lines like `if you don't wanna die, you shouldn't have been born' -eat your heart out Shakespeare!

Jose Padhila wrote and directed this and I expect to see more from him. Despite this being a follow up he considers it to be the last in his crime trilogy, `Bus 174' was a documentary on how poverty breeds crime and that he considers to be part one. In Portuguese with good sub titles this is world cinema with an edge and a bang, and as a piece of cinema I found it both entertaining and a great journey.",1334707200,,2078,4.172069825436409

So far, this has been Brazil's highest grossing movie - ever. A movie that is made very much like a fancy documentary must have some truth that's very appealing to the average person if it achieved such a status. Yet the main character is fictional, and the movie's leftist undertones may have appealed to the majority of Brazilians, especially to those cable-dependent living in the slumps. Very tense and emotional, with a lot of militia & gang violence. Life seems to be cheap in Brazil - votes is all that counts in the end. Out of a room full of politicians at the end of the movie, maybe 5 or 6 were considered honest ... and that takes guts for producers not just in Brazil, but in any country. Great entertainment.

4893096,4,B005TZFZLA,"...with an interesting view on Brazilian politics and drug culture.

Let me say first that Elite Squad 2 has a lot of well written moments. It's paced well, has a long view of its own history, and isn't afraid to mess with its principal and supporting characters.

That said, it sort of suffers from heavy-handedness when it gets political. This is particularly so when we listen to the ridiculous opening speech of Fraga, the seeming enemy of main character and narrator Nascimento. But the same can be said for Nascimento's own comments as we hear his narration of the last few years of his life trying to deal with crime in his own, rather brutal way.

It's funny how the systemic corruption seems harmless at first... the product of a few bad eggs and blowhards teaming together to sway the public and fix elections, but that's how it starts. A few key figures get together and scratch each others' backs... and a new mafia is born. One that has no problem killing honest cops and reporters.

I love how both Nascimento and Braga do their best to remain pure in their own ways and protect the folks around them even as they are besieged both by each other (via their competing interests/politics) and the TRUE enemies, their colleagues in the Military Police and Government.

Cinematography-wise, Elite Squad 2 is pretty sweet, actually. All solid, competent work without relying on CG... gun play that is practical instead of artistic and edits that maintain the chaotic feeling of raids without relying on shakycam or quickcuts.

It's hard not to hate everyone in this film as there are NO innocents. Even Nascimento's son is a little corrupt (for a good cause) and that, to me, is the great message of the film... that, as we codify our vices, we only open the door for the exploitation of the ENTIRE population by a lucky few... yet still, there must be an answer for protecting society from crime. It's an interesting dichotomy that is explored well in this film... concerning the balance of law and freedom when both are co-opted by greedy men.

This example of great Brazilian cinema has me thirsting for more.",1332288000,,2121,4.7317073170731705
4893097,4,B005TZFZLA,"Dirty Cops and Corrupt Politicians exist the world over, and explotation of the poor has gone since the beginning of society. ELITE SQUAD THE ENEMY WITHIN shows the way Brazil has elevated these social ills to an evil perfection. Its a great topic, much like the writer's earlier film THE CITY OF GOD, which gave voice to the exploited poor from the slums of Rio de Janeiro. However, ELITE SQUAD has some problems that might keep people from enjoying it. I'm refering to the over-abundant voice-over narration of the lead character, Captain Nascimento. For starters, this films actual title is ELITE SQUAD PART 2, so there's a TON of back story from PART 1 that the viewer is filled in on at the film's beginning. If it just stopped at the beginning of the film, that wouldnt be so bad. Unfortunately this constant voice over by Nascimento continues unabated for over 45 minutes of the movie. (That's when he finally said ""We're up to present day now"" in his narration.) Since with foreign movies you're basically reading all this voice over and back story, and since this narration is almost constant, you don't get to watch the film as much as read the subtitles. I have nothing against subtitles, in fact, I love foreign cinema. Nevertheless when a film sacrifices soundtrack, and visual narration for a constant stream of conscousness loquaciousness, the poetry and depth of a film is sacrificed. This over-narration also causes another problem, namely, the sacrifice of character development, in order to explain intricate plot, and secondary character motivations. Its maddening! At one point I wanted to scream at that Captain Nascimento to shut up, and allow the actions of the other characters to be self explanatory. I mean, if a journalist is going to crash into a mob boss headquarters to get a story, do we REALLY need to know that ""journalists are curious""? Does EVERY bit of action need this omnipotent narrator to provide all the reasons why it occured? When the film ends, there is an odd lack of carthesis, even tho the narrator tells us that THE GOOD GUYS WON. I felt cheated having watchd almost two hours of film, only to have the denoument and ending eclipsed into a wordy public speach, and more voice over. I found the film's editing to be well done, and the actors are believable. However, the heavily verbose script narrates convoluted plots at the expense of visual storytelling, ruining what could have been a very good action adventure police drama. I liked the film as social comentary, but not as good cinema.  Therefore, I'd say 3 and 1/2 stars. One other point worth mentioning is that now BLU RAY Films are starting to contain a second DVD with the film shown in regular DVD format. OVer time, this will be a big selling point when people try to decide whether to buy a BLU RAY player, since they shall have collected many BLU RAY dvds inadvertantly, in this manner.",1331856000,,2900,4.7654075546719685

I really don't get what all the hype is.  The movie is a perfectly adequate workingman's addition to the crime and corruption drama but didn't rise above the chaff so to speak.

The acting is very good and the cinematography worked well for me, displaying the grime and grit of the various environs for which the plot took place.  But the constant voice over was too invasive and the film was completely predictable.

I think this movie means more to residents of Rio De Janeiro and Brazil as its making a statement at a societal level which perhaps elevates is worth in the eyes of Brazilian citizens.",1331769600,,739,4.6106870229007635

4893100,5,B005TZFZLA,"This review is for Elite Squad (Blu-ray and DVD Pack).  This is actually Elite Squad: The Enemy Within, also known as Elite Squad 2.  The DVD is identical to the Blu-ray disc in regards to the content.

The film is about the power that government, media, and politicians wield, how they effect the societies around them, how corruption comes into play, and how people are swayed to think certain ways by all three. Great, well-written film. This film was amazing.

The dialogue is in Spanish, with easy-to-read English subtitles. The camera-work and cinematography are excellent for most of the film. There are two scenes (one action and one dialogue) where the camera was more erratic than it needed to be.  In the action scene, it is difficult to see what's going on.  In the dialogue scene, it feels too shaky for a scene between two people sitting at a table having a discussion. Other than those two, the cinematography was excellent. Extremely sharp details in shots.  The Editing was also well-done. Nice cuts and lead-ins.

The only SPECIAL FEATURE is a 55 minute feature showing behind-the-scenes footage of the crew working, and interviews with the cast and crew.  I enjoyed the footage and interviews. Nice inclusion on the disc.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys action, a complex story, and material that is very true to life. 5 stars for the film. 4.5 stars for the Blu-ray/DVD disc. I was looking for a few more extras in addition to the 55 minute feature.",1331769600,,1488,4.77734375

Though subtitled movies are not my favorite, I find that I like the original cast dialog better than dubbing and that was definitely true for this film. I found this movie to be fascinating from the perspective that it mixed modern society - in a place I know little about - with the age old battle of politics, power, money and corruption. I was drawn into the story and really felt like I was seeing the story through the characters in their environment. I wasn't an outsider looking in, I was seeing the complex story unfold from the characters' view and it was not simply presented on a plate for the viewer to see.

The story was compellingly told with no gratuitous violence - that which was there was needed to tell the story. The acting was superb, all the way around. Obviously, so was the directing. The story continuously flowed, at no time does the movie drag along.

Technically the cinematography/video, the sound track and the acting and locations were magnificent. Overall, I found a lot to like and it is deservedly the highest grossing movie of all time in Brazil (so far, anyway!)

4893102,4,B005TZFZLA,"Elite Squad: The Enemy Within is a far better film than its predecessor, but still isn't in the elite category of corrupt-thriller films.  Still, it's a fun ride, and 4 stars.

For those who missed Elite Squad, a simple way to think about it was that it was Brazil's answer to a combination of Robocop (which Elite Squad's director will be remaking), Dirty Harry, and Death Wish.  Take one incorruptible crusading cop who is mad as hell, give him a bunch of guns and loyal subordinates, and let him take out the gangs that control the slums and drug trade without regard to legal niceties.  It's no coincidence that characters in both movies refer to BOPE as ""The Skull"" after the SS-like Death's Head that is their logo.

In other words, great action and plenty of things to cheer about if you're in the theater, but plot holes galore.  Overall, not a great film.

Elite Squad 2 is a far more balanced movie, which starts with now-Colonel Nascimento and subordinates screwing up a prison riot, but being too popular to fire, he gets promoted to a desk job.  Once there, he discovers that the results of his kill-em-all quest in the first movie have simply meant that the gangs he's wiped out have been replaced by corrupt cops, public officials, and businessmen - and that if anything he's probably made things worse.

It's a fun ride as Nascimento wises up, but while the marketing types have compared it to the Wire or the Departed, the storytelling doesn't even really get to the level of something like Homicide: Life on the Street.  Fortunately, that's made up with gun battles and action scenes that are nothing short of spectacular, but just be aware you're not getting an intellectual moral thriller.

4 stars, and if the rate of improvement continues in the next sequel, it'll be one heck of a film.",1331164800,,1809,4.6572327044025155

""You follow drugs, you get drug addicts and drug dealers. But you start to follow the money... and you don't know where the **** is going to take you."" Lester Freamon

Profundity Captain Nascimento (Wagner Moura), leader of the Brazilian Military Police's elite BOPE squad would have been well served by had enlightenment struck far earlier in this film. The story unfolds with Nascimento's team summoned to squelch a riot in a prison where warring drug dealing factions are housed in separate wings. When one of the gang leaders demands to negotiate only with a human rights activist professor who coincidently happens to be Nascimento's personal and professional albatross things rapidly take a ruthless course. Not surprisingly, self-aggrandizing political functionaries seek to serve up a scapegoat and Nascimento is the obvious choice, until public sentiment renders that action unpalatable. Alternatively, he is praised and promoted.

The emboldened newly appointed undersecretary decides to take on his new assignment with vigor, dedicating himself and his team to the eradication of drug dealers and trafficking in Rio's underbelly, the same slums that played so significant a role in another acclaimed Brazilian film, City of God. As his quest proceeds, he finds that cutting out one malignancy may very well leave an open wound for infestation by another, one quite possibly significantly more virulent than the first.

'Elite Squad: The Enemy within' is a sequel to the 2007 film, 'The Elite Squad.' While the recent version is sufficiently fleshed out to stand independently, I know my enjoyment of it would have been enhanced by familiarity with the earlier film as the dynamics between Nascimento, his ex-wife and her husband, as well as a host of other characters seemed under developed.

Prior to forming firm opinions regarding any foreign language film I view it at least three times and the second viewing typically includes disabling subtitles to facilitate concentration on artistic flourishes and subtleties. Unfortunately, the capability to disable subtitles is absent with this Portuguese language film. However, the distraction of the subtitle scroll was but one factor as I failed to find any of the characterizations engaging.

From my perspective, each central character meandered into monolithic form and previewing publicity blurbs had conditioned me to expect multifaceted portrayals comparable to the encompassing dramatizations of the The Wire. When Avon Barksdale opined, ""It's only business,"" the viewer knew Stringer Bell understood implicitly and emotionally. Here, Nascimento and other major characters failed to tap into my sensibilities in any manner remotely comparable.

With full acknowledgement of my own meandering to the professor Fraga (Irandhir Santos)leftist/ progressive side of the aisle, 'Elite' falls short where I found another Brazilian film, City of God, to have soared.  'City' was equally as violent however I found myself engrossed by the story, emotionally invested in the characters and anxious to find out if they could survive or overcome the obstacles confronting them. Here, whatever course was to be followed I only wanted it to be over as it seemed each character was constrained to stringent, largely simplistic views of self and purpose.

This is a good film but it didn't reach the level of `can't miss' for me.",1330732800,,3498,5.343636363636364

I found myself essentially ignoring the film and doing nothing but attempting to read the subtitles.  Aside from this, I found it wasn't really my type of movie.  It was dark visually and came across more about government and how public outcry or support impacts that.  Add in lots of violence and you pretty much have this movie.

4893106,4,B005TZFZLA,"There seems to be a certain allure to Rio De Janeiro but it is also supposed to be a horribly brutal place to live. This film depicts that to the nines.

Here's the scoop. Captain Nascimento heads BOPE, an elite unit compiled to deal with the drug traffic in the city. He's a bit too successful. In dramatically reducing the drug traffic he has cut the amount of graft collected by crooked cops, so they ""promote"" him to a position where he won't get in the way of business. The police have now moved on to screwing the average citizen so the Captain is befallen with a new set of challenges. There's more to it than this but this is the gist of it.

This is some rough stuff. It does not flinch from showing the city in a wholly unfavorable light. You have police gunning down normal citizens right out in the open. When a congressional hearing is imminent witnesses begin to disappear. Reporters who report the abuses are done away with. This is a nearly lawless existence. And when Nascimento fights back, as much good as he does, he has seemingly no effect. He realizes the system is resilient and those in power are going to do whatever they need to to maintain the status quo.

This is a tremendous movie. Nearly everything about it is outstanding. I watched it subtitled which is a bit rough in that, as exciting as it is, there is a lot of dialogue, so I might have missed certain things happening on the screen.

Elite Squad: The Enemy Within is actually a sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elite-Squad/dp/B001CDFY2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elite Squad</a>, but the film can be watched without knowing much of the backstory.

The BOPE is the state of Rio de Janeiro's special forces of the military police and Nascimento (Wagner Moura, with a stunning resemblance to Ray Liotta) was a Captain on the edge of burnout, eventually turning over the reigns to Matias (Andre Ramiro) so he can leave the force because his wife is pregnant with his first child.

All of that happened in the first movie 13 years ago. With that background, things didn't turn out as planned. Nascimento is now a Colonel in the BOPE. During a daring raid to control a prison riot, multiple high level drug dealers are killed. Nascimento's thrown under the bus by Fraga, a human rights worker who is now married to Nascimento's ex-wife and an influence on his stepson. However, popular support of Nascimento leads him to a promotion as an intelligence officer for the security services.  As BOPE takes down the drug lords of the favelas of Rio, Nascimento has to confront a worse sort of criminal: the ones that hide behind badges and suits.

Both Fraga and Nascimento find themselves at opposite ends of spectrum trying to combat a common enemy. They make for an unlikely pair, with Nascimento seeming that he's refraining from beating Fraga to death only out of respect for his ex-wife. The stunning amount of corrupt cops and politicians is hard to swallow, but it's the hidden underbelly to Rio's beauty.

The movie is high-kinetic, shot in a loose documentary style. It reminded me of The Shield in a way, with a gritty enough feel without going overboard like Michael Bay. There's a good discipline in the director's chair, and you'll probably be hearing Jose Padilha's name more as he gets work in Hollywood. The action scenes are well done, and quite bloody, showing that BOPE doesn't worry too much about civil liberties or shooting criminals in the back. It's a rough world, and only the strong can survive to go home. The movie functions as well as a political thriller as well as a police thriller.

While the movie is a great film on its own, I think you'd be doing yourself a disservice and by not watching the first Elite Squad. You'd truly get to understand the world that the characters inhabit, and find your feelings for the movie even more blurred.",1329868800,,2629,4.963636363636364

Yet this is nothing like a typical Hollywood action film. Nascimento's chosen life drives away both his wife and his son while his success against lower-level drug traffickers presents new opportunities for tougher, more connected criminal gangs (fueled by dirty cops).

Brazil's extreme social inequality, with huge swaths of the population living in slums while a select few party it up in mansions, gets depicted in brutal fashion. The viewer naturally roots for Nascimento as he fights back against corrupt, sociopathic officials in the government as well as street thugs. Nonetheless, 'the system' in all its impersonal yet brutal nature remains a problem bigger than any one officer, no matter how determined.

This is how I knew it was deep. Lots of movies try to convince you that theres just one button you can push or one person you can fire and everything will be OK. At the end of this movie I really felt that this problem was massively complicated but very human and real, something you can never really understand unless you live it.

I don't speak a word of Portuguese, but I found this movie completely riveting. I could not look away (and not just out of concern that I'd miss some subtitles.) I found the subtitles easy to read and follow while still not missing any parts of the actual movie. Cannot recommend highly enough.",1476403200,3,406,4.732394366197183
