7316346,2,B010S0704A,"This could have been a contender. Gaby Hoffman! A Rosemary's Baby plot. Unfortunately, it's under developed. Feels like a graduate film student's project that was rushed. Nothing really connects or makes sense. We really don't know if this is a ghost story, cult conspiracy, or about a mother gone crazy. This movie should be redone. Has great potential.",1445040000,,354,5.120689655172414

7316348,4,B010S0704A,"I did enjoy this movie, in the ""Rosemary's Baby"" tradition, and I realize it's a low-budget indy film, but I feel that it could have been a bit more polished. I do like that the music was written especially for the movie, and the casting was well done.",1444348800,3,252,4.270833333333333
8723091,4,B010S0704A,"i actually quite liked this little indie low budget film. it stars Gaby Hoffman (uncle Buck,Now and then, sleepless in seattle). really stripped down but entertaining in a sort've Hitchcock style but in a more sundancy way. if you like these type's of  movies give it a try. if your a big budget transformer's series type of guy then i suggest you move on.",1534377600,,356,4.5625

8723093,2,B010S0704A,"I had to hit the skip in the whole movie, fine acting by Gaby, but bad gay drama and terrible ending, no where near Rosemary's baby. It is an insult to the original.",1515715200,,165,4.03030303030303
8723094,5,B010S0704A,I loved it it was creepy and well acted. I do love me some Gaby Hoffmann but either way I liked it . but I like most movies people don't like/ get lol,1506816000,,150,3.5757575757575757
8723095,4,B010S0704A,"Worth the Ride to watch Gaby Hoffman act her heart out in this movie. Of course the reviews are all over the place because there are gaps as wide as the Grand Canyon and most of the other actors are terrible, the script is bad and and and there are so much that is just a mess.. but it didn't matter to me. It is a cheesy remake of Rosemary's Baby without the grace of Mia Farrow and the ultimate submission. What you get is a portrayal of a woman who, once those bulbs get ignited above her head in what could be a cartoon movie.... fights like the momma Lion.",1505865600,,561,4.063063063063063
8723096,1,B010S0704A,"Terrible movie and not in a good way. Total waste of time and there is NO ending. Movie ends with no resolution or any kind of ending. She gives birth and wham.....go to credits. Waste of time! How is this garbage getting high ratings? I'm beginning to think that most people in this world have no taste or intelligence. If you want to watch a movie like this about Satanist and such go watch the real deal original, Rosemary's Baby.",1505606400,2,433,4.425
8723097,3,B010S0704A,It was alright.,1447891200,,15,4.333333333333333
8723098,3,B010S0704A,stars for gabby...great actress but the movie didn't have enough umph....its a sin to say its like rosemarys baby...it didn't have one tenth of the quality. I wouldnt pay for this movie..free it would be ok.,1447027200,,207,4.777777777777778
8723099,1,B010S0704A,"Its not Rose Marys baby thats for sure. The pacing was off. Most of the actors and actresses  were really bad. The main character and the baby Lyle were the only good actors but the poor baby wasn't focused on enough. Well the land lady was good too. But thats it, the black friend is one of the worst actors ive ever seen. How do you fudge up that bad. If you watch this movie you will know what im talking about. The old saying who did he/she sleep with to get their part comes into mind. Also twist ending was cheap and you already know 80% of the ending by the first 20 minutes. Bad movie .",1445644800,,594,4.033898305084746
8723100,5,B010S0704A,"I'm a sucker for indie horror and this one is no exception. Lyle is an extremely well-acted little movie with some nice nods to Rosemary's Baby, a very moving, piano-driven score, and a tight script. Despite the short length, it feels like (and is) a fully developed film. Lyle makes good use of its running time: there is no extra padding, no scenes wasted, and expositional shots only where they are really needed.

Gaby Hoffman is incredible in this movie and the rest of the cast is also great. I found Lyle to be emotionally resonant and eerie. It's more of a dialog driven, atmospheric effort in comparison to its contemporaries, which only makes it stand out more. I find that I can't agree with reviewers who said the film could be more polished--I think the cinematography, editing, and lighting are all adequate and in some cases top notch. Lyle was shot digitally but that helps the movie feel more immediate.

And kudos to Stewart Thorndike for making a lesbian driven horror film. We don't get quite enough of those in horror. If you're a fan of independent cinema, throwback horror, Rosemary's Baby, or alternative cinema, Lyle is definitely worth a look!",1445558400,,1169,4.782178217821782
