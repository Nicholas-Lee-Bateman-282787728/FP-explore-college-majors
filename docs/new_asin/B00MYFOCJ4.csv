Do yourself a favor, crack a beer (or ten) and watch this movie with all your friends!!!",1413158400,,252,4.270833333333333
6604721,5,B00MYFOCJ4,"This movie is so funny.  It's obviously not a big budget blockbuster, but it's not meant to be.  That's part of its appeal.  With that said, at no time does it ever look like someone just went outside with a video camera and shot something.  The movie itself and the DVD and all packaging are all extremely professional looking.  I've watched the movie through twice now and I liked it even more the second time.  There are so many random moments that catch you off guard and leave you laughing out loud.  Nearly every line in the movie is hysterical and fit to be integrated into everyday conversation to garner laughs from your friends.  I have a whole list of people who I want to show this movie to.",1410566400,3,703,4.395348837209302

6604724,5,B00MYFOCJ4,"Funny movie, awesome actors and punchlines. The main character, Bloodsucka Jones is hilarious with his bell bottoms and Afro. This is a great buy! Going in my comedy collection!!",1410220800,4,178,5.172413793103448

6604726,5,B00MYFOCJ4,"I LOVE Bloodsucka Jones! It's one of the most hilarious comedies I've ever seen. BLOODSUCKA JONES mixes blood and gore as well as a gratuitous helping of cleavage, hot bodies, and sexy vampire vixens into a top notch, can't-miss screw ball comedy. You and your friends will be quoting this movie constantly. Definitely the ANCHORMAN of horror comedies.",1410134400,5,352,5.086206896551724
6604727,5,B00MYFOCJ4,Just a dam funny indie film!,1433635200,,28,3.8333333333333335
6604728,4,B00MYFOCJ4,"This was a riot to watch. The puns and gaffs were great.

Bloodsucka Jones takes over where Jack Burton left off and runs with it. Bloodsucka Jones is probably the funkiest, yet most useless, comic book super hero this side of The Great Lakes Avengers. The filmmakers succeeded in bringing you a successful comic romp and as long as you go into it with an open mind, a bowl of popcorn and some good friends, you've got it made. Just don't go in expecting an action packed horror movie.",1433548800,,485,4.449438202247191
6604729,5,B00MYFOCJ4,One of my all time laughing my head off from all the crazy ridiculous fun moments in this movie favorites!!!!! Can't wait for the sequel!,1433462400,,137,4.52

6604733,5,B00MYFOCJ4,I like how the person who gave this one star only watched 20 minutes of this she is crazy I saw this at a film festival in California and rented this on Vimeo a while ago and it is one of my favorite movies of the year. I wanted to hug this movie after watching it was so much fun even if it is kind of low budget. I bought the DVD and can't wait to watch it.,1433462400,,359,3.6153846153846154
6604734,1,B00MYFOCJ4,"I don't know how fair it is to judge a movie that you watched for the first twenty minutes. Perhaps not at all. But I couldn't do this one. I saw the cover, read the numerous accolades this movie has received, and decided to give it a chance. Someone saw me coming, just like I saw most of the jokes coming two miles in advance. The execution was bad, the acting amateurish, and the lighting .... I know, I know, it's a low-budget spoof, give it a break. But I've seen some excellent low budget movies. And I've seen great spoofs. This isn't either.

I'm not sure who Blooksucka Jones is, but someone sucked the life and the humor out his movie. Well, at least the first 20 minutes of it ...",1433030400,2,691,4.234848484848484
6604735,5,B00MYFOCJ4,"Bloodsucka Jones is a non-stop stream of laughs and beautiful women!  This independent comedy succeeds where so many others fail: it's actually funny! There's something in it for everyone, so I highly recommend it! You won't be sorry!",1419292800,,234,5.157894736842105
6604736,5,B00MYFOCJ4,Super funny movie. Great writing and genuine laughs all through out! Carrrlooooossss!,1416700800,,85,6.166666666666667
8675315,5,B00MYFOCJ4,Love love love this! Campy af!!!! Gotta make shirts dude!!!,1527724800,,59,5.0
8675316,1,B00MYFOCJ4,"After giving it a few minutes, I can tell you that watching this movie is a waste of time. The script was filled with middle-school jokes and the direction was incredibly amateurish. I can't believe someone would waste their time writing and producing this ""movie.""

All the 5 star reviews you see are from people that have starred in the movie and/or their families. It may sound critical, but seriously, don't waste your money here - find something nicer to spend it on.",1479081600,,472,4.686746987951807
8675317,5,B00MYFOCJ4,This movie's great. Watch it. You will love it. It's a severely under-appreciated film.,1473120000,,87,5.285714285714286
8675318,1,B00MYFOCJ4,Stupid premise with horrible acting. Story is slow and dumb. Whoever made this movie should call it a day and wrap up whatever plans they had for movie making.,1461715200,,159,4.517241379310345
8675319,5,B00MYFOCJ4,I love this movie! People that love entertaining people and have a good time doing it!! Check out my girl Maria Canapino in this flick as well. Fun cool laugh your ass off netflix and chill kinda good! Get on it people!,1449532800,,219,4.238095238095238
8675320,4,B00MYFOCJ4,"I was at the Days of the Dead horror convention this year and a booth was setup for this movie.  The name intrigued me enough to ask about it.  The guy behind the table I believe is the star and director of the film.  He said ""This is your new favorite movie"".  He gave me his sales pitch.  And said it's only $10.  Sure I could have rented it.  Or even bought it on Amazon for less.  But I'm a sucker for the underdog.  So I gave it a chance.  Now I'm not a huge reviewer but the guy said if I did I could get a free download or 10 to give as gifts.  So I'm going to write an honest review and lay it out there for others.

First with the bad...A bit longer than it needed to be (maybe 20 mins).  I chalk this up to first time director and movie.  Maybe even a lack of actual film school studies as well.  If you buy the physical copy, the liner notes explain how this labor of love happened to be.  That being said, I cut it some slack.

My only other complaint is Jones is not in it enough.  And if you see the movie you can take away your own thoughts on this but I'm guessing that it may have a LOT to do with how this movie was made over the years.  You get the people when you can for what you can pay or not pay and you piece together the movie how you can based on the footage you have.

With that out of the way I'm going to give tell you that this is actually a pretty funny movie.  Some juvenile spots, but no more so than say a dumb and dumber.  Not in the way that makes you cringe.  It has some very solid laugh out loud moments.  My whole family laughed when we were supposed to.  You are not watching Citizen Kane here people.  You are watching a low budget homage to 70's movies like Blackbelt Jones and 80's camp vampire movies.  And it shows the makers passion for the genre.

I truly enjoyed myself.  The story, though it makes sense (well in that you understand the story they are telling) is disjointed.  But again, I think they had a bunch of shots.  And put them together in a story that included many of their friends and or family and tried to tell a funny story.  And that is where I think the length comes from.  I don't remember a scene that actually went on too long in itself that it became gratingly bad.  More in line with too many scenes to try and fit everyone and everything in.

For $10, I feel we got our moneys worth.  I look forward to the further adventures.  And I intend to back another movie on kickstarter if it should happen.",1448841600,,2472,3.9918032786885247
8675321,5,B00MYFOCJ4,"By far this is the best independent movie I have seen in awhile. This destined to be a cult classic. Be a trendsetter and watch it now. We are making it a part of our Halloween tradition. William Cutting is Awesome in this movie. Don't go it solo, best watched in a group.",1447113600,,272,4.150943396226415
8675322,5,B00MYFOCJ4,"This is a low-budget spoof comedy that will certainly find its way into the rankings of cult classics. This is not Coen brothers level of film and entertainment, nor should it be judged under such criteria. But if you're into cheap laughs and punchlines you can recycle in your social realm, then this movie won't disappoint. Again, if you watch this film with the anticipation of finding the meaning of life, or to inspire you to eat, pray, and love yourself, then skip this film... because if this cinematic gem doesn't help you laugh your way to an escape from your miserable existence, then you should go search the book section for self-help literature.",1439769600,,658,4.780701754385965

8675324,5,B00MYFOCJ4,"As my home country is the great nation of Canada, I can officially announce Bloodsucker Jones has become the 3rd most favorite thing in all of the great white north, coming just behind Hockey and Labatts Blue.  Seriously, you can have a fun silly 100 minutes of people who made a movie for the love of making a movie.  A guy broke a bone in this movie damit just to make me laugh, And I did!  Quick one liners, surprising good acting and two hapless main characters that you know are just like your dumb best friends.  Blood sucker Jones himself needs to be the next super hero movie coming out before Batman XII.  Enjoy.",1433635200,,621,4.3652173913043475
