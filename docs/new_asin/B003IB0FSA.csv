4126063,5,B003IB0FSA,"The backyardigans are one of our favorites.  Since they are no longer broadcast in our area, we bought a few of the DVD's.  The great thing is that unlike other kids shows, my husband and I don't mind listening to the backyardigans over and over again.",1425945600,,252,4.456521739130435

4126067,1,B003IB0FSA,Unfortunately the disc did not play and I had one sad little boy. I am sure the movie itself is just as great as the other Backyardigans movies.,1395878400,,144,4.178571428571429

4126070,5,B003IB0FSA,"We love all of the Backyardigans videos (some more than others, of course). This is a great series for young kids. And enjoyable and clever enough that the parent can be entertained while watching with their child.",1373328000,,214,4.8108108108108105
4126071,4,B003IB0FSA,The kids continue ask for more Backyardigans.  This disk proved to be entertaining.  Much like other episodes/discs.  Quality product that should last longer than the kids interest.,1360281600,,181,5.62962962962963

4126073,5,B003IB0FSA,"We love the Backyardigans.  My girls have been enjoying these shows for the past 4 years and they show no sign of outgrowing them.  They are now 6 & 8 years old.  Our youngest, age 16 months, also loves them.  They're a hit all around because my husband and I enjoy sitting down with the girls to watch Backyardigans for family movie night! Treat your family to some fun, witty stories with great music, lyrics and choreography!",1355184000,,428,4.51948051948052
4126074,5,B003IB0FSA,"I wish they would come out with more episodes - I find the Backyardigans way more entertaining and engaging than Dora, Spongebob, or any of the other Nickelodeon franchises.  If they came out with more episodes more regularly, as well as merchandise, I'm sure Nick would make many children (and their parents) very happy!

The four episodes are in regular rotation at our house.  I particularly like the rock music style of the title episode, especially ""Elephant, Elephant, Where Could You Be?""",1354924800,,495,5.012195121951219
4126075,5,B003IB0FSA,"My two grandsons always want to watch the Backyardigan movies, and they love this one! They always go to the movie rack and pull this one out. The 3 year old one says it is ""Funny""!",1346112000,,181,4.055555555555555
4126076,4,B003IB0FSA,This is not one of the better Backyardigan DVDs but you can't go wrong with them at all. They entertain they whole family (myself included!) This one's stories just weren't as interesting and there are not as many catchy tunes as some of the others.,1336435200,,249,4.555555555555555
4126077,5,B003IB0FSA,"My little ones, 2 and 4, LOVE this dvd! They are entranced by it. They music is fun, they love ""Elephant on the Run"" the best but the others are just as fun. Backyardigans is a fun, safe way to entertain your kids!",1327881600,,214,4.0
4126078,3,B003IB0FSA,"I don't know exactly what to write since I haven't watched this with them.  All I know is that they are not at all engaged by this movie.  The Backyardigans ""Super Secret Super Spy"" is the bees knees for them and they can watch that show for all of 6 hours during long cross country car trips.  But they can't even make it through once of this DVD for some reason.  I don't know.  Since we watch these movies for road trips, I'm not in the back to watch it with them and I have really no idea what the difference is.

Further edit: i should say that my children have a tendency to either completely love an episode or be utterly bored by it.  They are bored by every episode on this DVD, whereas there will usually be 1 or 2 that they absolutely love.",1294099200,2,751,4.102739726027397
4126079,5,B003IB0FSA,My son loves the Backyardigans!  I've come to love them too!  They are one of the better children's cartoons.  I purchased this DVD to go with the theme of my sons gifts - elephants.  The Backyardigans are a wonderful teaching tool for kids. I recommend this purchase.,1293408000,,268,4.638297872340425
4126080,5,B003IB0FSA,"If your kids like Backyardigans, this is an AWESOME DVD.  My kids (age 2 and 3) love it and ask for it most nights. I also like that this DVD comes with 4 episodes - seems like a good value.  The only downside is that, unlike Mickey Mouse and other educational shows, this one doesn't teach anything like counting, letters, shapes, etc.  But if you're looking for a fun DVD that your kids will like singing and dancing to, this is the one.",1292889600,,439,4.265060240963855

8397289,5,B003IB0FSA,"I would definitely recommend this. I first discovered The Backyardigans back in 2008. My daughter was about one and a half and wouldn't stop watching, dancing, and singing with them. Now, fast forward to 2016 and my son who just turned two can't go a day without them. He does exactly the same with dancing and singing. It's amazes me how well put together these episodes are. If you haven't watched them, make the leap and buy one so you can enjoy the fun and exciting adventures.",1501113600,,481,4.540229885057471
