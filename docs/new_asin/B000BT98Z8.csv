2440138,5,B000BT98Z8,I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE ME AND MY 7 YEAR OLD SON LOVE BOXING. I WANTED HIM TO SEE SOME OLD FIGHTS AND I ALSO WANTED TO SEE SOME THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN. THIS DVD WAS ALL THAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AND MORE. WE LOVED IT AND GIVE IT TWO THUMBS UP AND FIVE STARS.,1173830400,5,256,3.508771929824561
2440139,4,B000BT98Z8,"I've searched, and so far, I have not come across a boxing (mainly Heavyweight) DVD, with more footage from the early years 1900-1950,
than this one. The only one that comes close is the DVD ""The Kings of the Ring"".

I realize, the earlier you go back, the footage will be horrible, limited camera views, but, its part of Boxing history, so, show it.
In VHS, you can probably find a few good ones with older fights,
if you look long enough.

The footage is fair to good quality on most of them. Lots of fights on here too, from 1909 to the 1950s, maybe one from the early 60's.
Going back to Jack Johnson, Jess Willard(Not fighting Johnson), James Braddock, Max Baer, Joe Louis, Jack Dempsey and many more.

More DVD's like this, need to be released. I wouldn't call this the best, I'd call this one, the only one, with a more complete history of the early fights. Some of these might be considered rare fights, that you might not find on other DVDs.

I say its worth the 10 dollars.

Buy it.",1173744000,27,992,4.34054054054054

2440158,2,B000BT98Z8,"It seems to me that there are a few different DVDs floating around under this title, as I have read reviews that list fights that I do not have on my particular copy. Mine has almost no fights from the 1900's or 1910's, but numerous fights from the '20's - '50's. In fact the only pre-1910 fight I have on my copy is the Jack Johnson/Stanley Ketchel fight from 1909 which I was thrilled to see in the menu, but I was utterly disappointed when the fight's conclusion (which is a classic one) is inexplicably chopped and removed. I've seen the same fight on youtube in it's entirety and the fact that this DVD edited out the ending totally baffled me. Sadly, this is the case with many of the fights on the DVD. Some fights are featured until their conclusion, others are horribly chopped, edited and incomplete. The highlight for me (at least with the copy I received) was that it contained the complete Jack Dempsey/Jess Willard fight. I was worried that it might be cut up, but thankfully it wasn't. So, at the very least, I do have that fight in my personal collection now.
Being a bit of a boxing historian I found it to be a nice little find especially for the price. It was kinda fun seeing old and rare footage of some of boxing's all time greats. (Granted some of the footage is of downright awful quality.) My DVD came with a ""biography"" menu which listed dozens of great and lesser known fighters and had a short career recap for each, which I found to be somewhat interesting. But, small positives aside, there's not much to be found on this collection and I'm certain many will be disappointed by it. This is a good DVD for hardcore fans of boxing history ONLY. If you are looking for a high quality collection of the greatest fights of all time, then you should look elsewhere, because this isn't it. It's just a random collection of old fight footage. Some of them are title bouts, others are included seemingly just because..",1440374400,,1939,4.480225988700565

2440187,3,B000BT98Z8,"As most of the other reviewers have noted, the production values of this Tango Entertainment dvd are def not great, but that can be expected given the price of this product AND the prohibitive costs of getting the rights to show MORE than the single rounds or (extended) clips from each of the ""Fantastic Fights"" on this dvd.

The ""value"" that I've found in this item is that it gives one a basic idea as to how each of the fighters on this disc fought (i.e. was he a ""brawler"" or a ""boxer"", did he have a good jab, was he a righty or a ""southpaw"", etc) and that it is less time consuming to watch than having to, say, jump from video to video on youtube to catch a glimpse of these same fighters in action (assuming that that site even has video of all of them).  And, yeah, the clips aren't pristine, but that's not only due to the quality of the transfers, but also the quality of the original prints.  Indeed, as someone who has bought boxing dvds from various internet sellers, the picture quality of most of the bouts on this disc isn't THAT bad considering.

And, although many of the boxers who appear on this dvd are not great - or even ""good"" - fighters, footage of boxing immortals, such as Jack Dempsey, Benny Leonard, and Joe Louis, and of little remembered, but outstanding pugilists, like Tony Canzoneri, ""Kid Chocolate"", and ""Bat"" Battalino, more than make up for the shortcomings.

The single, 2 hour, 45 min disc contains rounds/clips from the following bouts:

Jack Johnson-Stanley Ketchel 1909
Jess Willard-Frank Moran 1916
Dempsey-Willard 1919

2440196,1,B000BT98Z8,"This is a haphazardly compiled collection of badly-rendered fight footage.  There are some fights included that really aren't fights of the century in any sense, such as washed-up ex-champ Max Baer beating the tar out of mid-range contender Tony Galento.  The fights are presented in no particular order, as we lurch from the 20s, forward to the 30s, up to the 50s, back to the 10s, and then back to the 30s again.  The transfers of the fight films are far too poor to blame on their simply being old.  You can find better picture quality for most of these fights on YouTube.  For most fights, there is only sparse newsreel-style commentary that, coupled with the poor picture, makes it hard to figure out which fighter is which, and few of the fights are placed in context in any way, shape, or form (especially with the lack of chronological logic).  It doesn't really make sense to hear an announcer tell us that Joe Louis' only loss to this point was to Max Schmeling, and then see that very match two fights later.

The most inexplicable mistake of the entire enterprise, however, was the fact that at least two of the fights were repeated for absolutely no reason:  Dempsey-Tunney II and (if I remember correctly) a Luis Firpo fight.  Add to all of this the fact that the title cards are filled with careless misspellings (""Loe Louis"" and ""Primo Carnero"" are examples) and it becomes clear that the production company was trying to rush a haphazard product onto the market, and make a quick buck off of fight fans buying it blind.

2440201,3,B000BT98Z8,"There's just a wee bit of hyperbole in the title of this DVD.  Some of the fights are not fantastic, and the documentary covers only the first half of the century.  Except for very short bouts, only bits and pieces of fights are included.  The early fights are from old films that are hard to see and unrestored.  Many of the great old championship fights are not there--such as Willard vs. Johnson.  And of the more recent bouts, there is none with Jake LaMotta and only a couple of pieces of Sugar Ray Robinson fights, none of the classic Robinson/Zale fights, Robinson/Basilio bouts.

Perhaps the producers tried to pack 10 pounds of material in a 5-pound bag.  They might have given us a two or more DVDs in the package with a wider selection of material, or chosen better and complete bouts for a one DVD package.  There's no Ali, no Sugar Ray Leonard, Larry Holmes, Mike Tyson, etc.  The latest fights are from the 1950s, as far as I could see.

Still, this is better than nothing at all, if you are a boxing fan.  The Louis/Schmeling fights alone are worth the price.",1194307200,67,1074,4.484536082474227
2440202,3,B000BT98Z8,"Because it's hard to find anything on the older fighters, this DVD does fill a kind of boxing black hole; among the fighters on this compilation are ones that you rarely get to see at all.

For instance, you get the Will o' the Wisp against rough-housing Sandy Saddler; it was the first time I'd ever seen Pep fight, and he's simply mesmerizing (watch him and you'll see where Orlando Canizales picked up his style).  Jersey Joe Walcott's on this DVD too - he does the herky-jerky, slips and slides and shuffles his way past Joe Louis (though Louis gets the nod - go figure!). And the amazing Kid Chocolate's on the menu as well.

One of the truly great fights though, the 1909 Clash of the Titans between Stanley Ketchel and Jack Johnson, - a vicious middleweight against a skilful heavyweight - is extremely disappointing.  After several minutes of the fight - suddenly, magically, inexplicably - we see Johnson down and Ketchel on his back - without seeing the punches that did the damage!

Additionally, the Walcott-Louis fight included here needs redoing - Walcott's torso disappears into the dark background of the crowd so that Louis appears to be fighting just a pair of boxing trunks with legs attached!  And this DVD also gives you the Tunney-Dempsey fights twice - why? No man can say!

All in all, it's worth buying to have some of the old-time greats on your DVD shelf, but don't expect too much from either the film quality or the footage.",1181865600,8,1453,4.65234375
2440203,5,B000BT98Z8,"I did not realize such DVD's existed and found it by accident. It provides footage of fighters not seen in fifty years or more. DVD actually has footage of a Jim Corbett fight from early 1900s. It is not the best quality but neither was Corbett, who was at the end of his career. However, it provided a view of Corbett's boxing style and why it was so successful at the turn of the century.

There are several Joe Louis matches which allows viewer to see strengths and weaknesses in his boxing ability. It was surprising to see the number of times Louis was knocked down by different fighters and what allowed him to win so many fights: the power of his right hand.

It does not have many fights after 1950 but those matches are not as rare. Any boxing fan will love this DVD. I purchased a second copy for a friend because he is a big fight fan.",1175904000,10,846,4.248447204968944
2440204,5,B000BT98Z8,"Emma and I sat on the couch watching the DVD of the 45 Fantastic Fights of the Century. She bought it for me for Christmas, thinking that I would be pleased. I appreciated the sentiment, but I had not been following boxing for some time. Yet, Emma was young and believed in love and fairytales (which she would never admit), and had for years found an odd-fascination with my first husband, Rocco, a man that died before she was born, before I met her father, and before I decided that I hated sports of any kind. This statement is not entirely true, and I continue to long for the afternoons I can spend at the baseball park, hearing the crack of the ball, and eating popcorn and peanuts. But boxing is different. Boxing was my first love. Watching the video brought back many memories. Some fights lasted for, what felt like hours, others mere minutes. The men were strong and powerful, and vicious. That is what Rocco lacked. The last time he was scheduled to fight he swore to me that he would win. He ached to be like Jack Johnson and Max Baer. What happened next crushed him.

Prior to the fight, the promoters demanded that all new welterweight boxers report to the training center. The gossips said that the National Hall was only going to hold heavyweight fights. The rest of the men would have to find a new venue. Phone calls were made, someone put an ad in the Chronicle, and some of the fighters even made their own rings in backyards and empty lots. But Rocco needed the shine of the lights and the roar of the crowd. It didn't matter much that they rooted against him.",1175731200,6,1583,4.439862542955327

These fights are incomplete, skipping alot of rounds. Voice over is cheesey color commentary, video quallity is extra poor, at best. Don't get too excited.
Unless you need to see old school sluggers, who take big shots to deliver, it is alot different from modern boxing
due to the"" no decision victory"", no need to look pretty, just get the job done appreach, back in the day, and fights generally lasted untl there was an undisputed victor.",1481846400,3,540,4.75531914893617
