8115216,3,B000EWBNPA,"A beautiful period piece on nude men.  Having been filmed in 1994, we see hairstyles consistent with the period.  Another interesting aspect are all the speedo type tan lines on the guys.  If they spent anytime on the mountaintop as they are being portrayed they would have some serious sunburns.  All that aside, the filming of the men is well done. no gratuitous penis shots, more an attempt to naturally portray men being nude in the outdoors. A favorite was the martial artist on the mountaintop paying homage to his arts, beautiful.  Another favorite was the fellow hiking through the trees, dropping his backpack, and then jogging along the trails, the play of his muscles was great.  More favorites, the nude sleeper getting up in the morning to cook breakfast and the two buddies jogging nude and then playing in the mountain stream, all good.  The best of nude men, certainly not.  On the other hand not the worst either, thus an average 3 rating.  Pleased to have the dvd added to my collection.",1428537600,2,1005,4.7298850574712645
