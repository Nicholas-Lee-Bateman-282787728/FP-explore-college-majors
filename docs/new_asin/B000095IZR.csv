7989644,5,B000095IZR,"Here's the thing about Yu-gi-oh, and in general other anime too.  It's not just for the very young, but also for the young at heart.  For me, there's a poignant simplicity about ""kid's stuff"" which can be meaningful to anyone.  Sure, these episodes are a marketing tactic for the cards, but you can control yourself so you don't end up spending more money than you have to.

Yugi is out to save his grandfather's soul by dueling a notorious bad guy in a card game.  The idea is ages old, going back to old folk tales where the hero challenges the devil and puts up his soul as betting material.  His friends stick by him when almost all hope is lost, and he manages to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.  It's an endearing tale.  Good animation, pretty good soundtrack, very entertaining.  A must see.",1094342400,4,806,4.465753424657534
