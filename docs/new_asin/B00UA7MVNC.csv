Most of the food I will probably never make (although most of it seems great), but I love watching and listening to her.  Her delivery has a very calming effect on me.  Kinda zen !  If you like Nigella or British cooking shows, you will enjoy this one.  The edition I purchased was geared to the German audience, so the subtitles were the default, but I was easily able to turn them off on my DVD player.  This set is HARD TO FIND, so if you like Nigella, go for it!!",1470700800,,529,4.188118811881188
