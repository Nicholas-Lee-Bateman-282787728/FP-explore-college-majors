The only problem is that you're in for 2 hours of non-stop moral depravity. cause there's zero morals here at all. I don't find that to be an issue. Plenty of movies are made completely lacking moral compasses that are ultimately fun movies. The keyword there is fun. Here Takashi Miike indulges in his need to be an apostle for his unshakable belief in nothing. He wasn't at all concerned with that in Shield of Straw, which had a lot more room to really turn the screws and get people thinking, but MIike will be Miike and by that I mean sloppy. So, you're served up what's ultimately a sanitized version of American Psycho that is mixed up with equal parts American Psycho and Pasolini's Salo. You're not alone thinking that sounds awkward and not fun. Worse yet, the actors involved are all committed and put forth a lot of effort only to be let down sadly.

Lesson of the Evil despite having a goofy title and a distinct drive towards the didactic still has some decent moments and even a few moments where it seems like it'll turn the corner into good. Unfortunately, it doesn't. If you're a fan, it's an interesting watch as it feels closest in tone to his early work but without the wild moments of say Fudoh or the Dead or Alive films but to those who haven't been watching his career it's going to be a big ball of whatever. Worse yet, they might pick up the religion of nothing Miike is selling here and be just as inconsistent as him",1514937600,,1599,4.383838383838384
8585845,5,B00CSTO6DS,"Takashi Miike is one of the most interesting directors at work in the cinema today. This movie, Lesson of the Evil, confirms his standing.

Judging from the advertisement on this website, this movie from Takashi Miike appears to be a cheap rip-off of Battle Royal. After all, both movies are generally about the wholesale slaughter of Japanese high-school students. But there is where the similarity ends. While the blood and gore in Battle Royale originated from a bizarre social experiment conducted by the protagonist, the main character in Lesson of the Evil murders his students as punishment for cheating on tests and bullying. This is not a simple slasher movie. Miike abandons his typical non-linear style of story-telling to delve deep into the mind of a psychopath who manages to obtain a job as a high-school teacher. The use of flash-backs and hyperlinked segments are at a minimum. Miike produces real drama as the students are killed. It is testimony to Miikes versatility as a director that even in telling a simple slasher movie Miike can produce a compelling story.

The only downside to the movie is that it is available only in DVD regions not compatible to the US or Canada. The purchase of a regionfree DVD player is justified in order to view this movie.",1417392000,,1276,4.875576036866359
