8389972,4,B0036FKHB8,"The concept of the film - an artificial island in the ocean to support air traffic  foreshadows the development by 21st- century Chinas artificial islands in the South China Sea. Prescient indeed.

 Two popular German actors play Ellissen in the English and German verison:  Hans Albers (shown on the DVD cover) is quite good in the German version. However, Conrad Veidt  who could and should have played the role in both languages  is superb. It matters not a bit that Veidt struggles a little with the English dialogue - this was only his second English-language film  his performance is riveting.",1527465600,,599,4.93

8389975,2,B0036FKHB8,"I'm really not too surprise that F.P.I. doesn't answer !  The excitement of the outline of the story and the general format of the images suggested by the cover of the DVD lead me to expect some fascinating visuals 'of the future'. Unfortunately there was very little in the film, as produced and designed' too back up any of my epectations. All the settings were very ordinary and the idea of the floating aircraft landing island was completely undeveloped.  In comparison to earlier 'si.fi' films, like 'Metropolis', 'Aelita, The Queen of Mars' etc it was very poor and very disappointing.  The German version was a little better than the American but, unless you want to take an interest in lost opportunities I would advise - move on to better things. Sorry.",1355270400,3,762,4.801526717557252
8389976,3,B0036FKHB8,"This DVD contains TWO films, the English version and the German version.

In 1932, director Karl Hartl shot ""Flight Platform No. 1 Doesn't Answer,"" a sci fi/love story, with separate German & French & English casts. The French version starring Charles Boyer is presumed lost, but its poster adorns the DVD case. The English version (now 74 min) was reduced in length over the years, while the German version (114 min) is intact (but with NO subtitles).

Celebrity pilot Ellissen (Conrad Veidt/Hans Albers) goes to considerable lengths to implement his engineer friend Droste's plans for a mid-Atlantic floating landing/takeoff strip for airplane refueling. He also gets involved with beautiful Claire, a co-owner of the shipworks which will build the platform. Then in a round-the-world flight, Ellissen disappears for two years, while Claire becomes enamored of Droste.

A mysterious cartel attempts to sabotage the platform. Upon his return, Ellissen realizes that Claire's affections have shifted. The three principals are aboard the platform as the crisis climaxes, and Ellissen saves the day and F. P. 1.

""English version"" does mean actors from England, not the U.S. But accent-heavy Veidt was just beginning his career in England, and British-born Leslie Fenton does have American diction because he moved to the U.S. as a child (and in 1938 became a Hollywood director).

In the German version, Peter Lorre plays the photographer Sunshine; the actress playing Claire has a ""problem"" chin and mouth. Several male chorus numbers brighten the soundtrack.

A talkative picture, insufficiently gripping.",1270252800,9,1606,5.404
