8439246,3,B0007CIM42,"This video is an entertaining look at Cocos Island (off Costa Rica), or more specifically, the marine life around and below it.  Most prominently featured here are the sharks, especially hammerheads, white tips, black tips, silvertips, and the silky.  (If you're looking for Great Whites here, no dice!)  What is shown is natural shark behavior, so you will not see the divers interacting with the sharks; rather, you will see sharks hunting in a pack along the reef and a very violent courtship/mating ritual, which leaves the female rather battered and bruised (the way male sharks stay close to the female is by biting and holding onto her gills).  Not the most pleasant arrangement for the female.

Also included here is a warning about the effect over-fishing is having on the area, and on marine life in general.  Despite the fact that Cocos Island is supposed to be protected as a National Park, you are shown several boats engaged in illegal fishing within its waters.  The insatiable demand for things like shark-fin soup is driving this activity, and the lead diver, Howard Hall, tells us that his generation of divers may be the last to see shark gatherings of this magnitude in the wild.  Sobering thought, if true.

Three stars.  Interesting view of life on and below what Jacques Cousteau called ""the most beautiful island in the world.""",1217030400,2,1351,4.885964912280702

8439248,4,B0007CIM42,"This feature is one of the finest examples of filming and presentation of underwater shark behavior that I have seen. For anyone who enjoys scuba diving this film is even more appealing as the Director Howard Hall, his long time associate renown cinematographer Bob Cranston and the Producer of the film Michelle Hall all join together to give the viewer a rare inside look into the filming of their underwater documentary.

If your looking for Shark Week style viewing then this is not for you.  If however you are looking for an insight into the true behavior of sharks in the underwater realm and what it takes to shoot such action by the people who film it then this film is a work of art.",1153180800,3,693,4.536
