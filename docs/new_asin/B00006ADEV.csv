1736811,3,B00006ADEV,"A lot of matches that occured at this show probably won't be on the DVD, but the ones that have to be are a great six man cage match with Balls Mahoney, Axl Rotten, and New JAck, up against Mustafa, and the Dudley Boyz.  A lot of blood and a great jump by New Jack.  Also Shane Douglas against Justin Credible, Tommy Dreamer pouring urine on Lance Storm, Rob Van Dam against a returning 2 Cold Scorpio, and Taz vs Chris Candido, there were a lot of matches with jobbers and little known wrestlers (at the time) which probably won't be on this DVD, but should be, this is a good show for anyone who has never seen ECW!",1027468800,4,617,4.176470588235294
7966239,5,B00006ADEV,When ECW Cyberslam 99 first happened it was a VHS only show and didn't air on Pay Per View. Its nice to finally be able to see the show in its entirety on this 2002 DVD release from Pioneer. I won't go over the match list as others already have but I will say that there wasn't a dud on the card and it was cool to see guys like Taka and Papi Chulo after leaving WWF.,1361923200,,367,3.779220779220779
7966240,3,B00006ADEV,"Some really good matches on here. I bought it for the value, and because I still have the ancient VHS format. But like always there are some minor flaws to this low priced tape.----No replays-No original music-buffed out completeley sometimes. No interviews with wrestlers hardly at all. Very cut down, but action packed. Pluses and minuses to this, but I would get it if your an ECW fan.",1351728000,,388,4.720588235294118
7966241,4,B00006ADEV,"From ECW, you can always expect their events to be of the highest quality matches featuring athleticism and hardcore.  They're not always perfect, but they rarely miss the spot for a great pay per view.

Jerry Lynn vs Yoshihiro Tajiri
A classic technical wrestling bout.  It was rather fun, but there was little to make this stand out as a spectacular match.  Great effort by the debuting Tajiri and Jerry Lynn.  (9/10)

Nova vs Rod Price (later to become Nova and Chris Chetti vs Rod Price and Skull Von Crush)
Like someone else said, this was a bad match.  Nova is probably a good wrestler, but his gimmick doesn't make him much of an ECW star without Richards and Meanie to make up the bWo with.  The rest was pretty much as generic a brawl as you'd see on an average episode of WWE RAW or Smackdown.  (2/10)

LANCE STORM AND TOMMY DREAMER ALTERCATION!
They brought these two out for this?  Lance accuses Tommy Dreamer of steroid use, brings out his own urine sample to submit for a drug test.  Dreamer comes out, beats him up, and throws Storm's own urine in his face.  E-C-W! E-C-W! E-C-W!

Super Crazy vs Mosco de la Merced
When Paul Heyman brought Rey Mysterio Jr, Juventud Guerrera, and Psicosis to American wrestling, he created a new classic ECW style (until WCW took Psicosis, Guerrera, and Mysterio).  Super Crazy and Mosco continue with this with great passion and skill and pure wrestling prowess as to go beyond the cliche' struggle of face versus heel.  The fans don't care, and neither do we.  (10/10)

TAKA Michinoku vs Papi Chulo
Oh hey, it's the guy that would be Essa Rios in the WWF.  Both of these guys are actually to be WWF stars (though Taka already was in the WWF, feuding with Kai En Tai, before joining Kai En Tai).  Despite the shortness of the match, it showed that the WWF really missed out on these two, and horribly booked Taka to be a fool.  Damn Vince and his giant-fetish.  (10/10)

ECW World Television Championship
Rob Van Dam (C) vs 2 Cold Scorpio
Either I've been watching the wrong guy in old ECW/WCW matches, or Scorpio's gotten a lot bigger and muscular.  Despite the phenomenal talent of these two, the match was dull.  There was little chemistry between the two, and they didn't seem to really have much motivation to go at it.  (7/10)

ECW Championship
Taz (C) vs Chris Candido
Decent enough, but little in this match was memorable save for the ending where Candido kayfabe breaks his neck, and Taz, after applauding him, suddenly attacks him on a stretcher and puts him in a Tazmission, because he didn't let Candido survive this time.  (7/10)

Shane Douglas vs Justin Credible
I'm sure this was probably a good match, but that's all it was; a ""good"" match.  Not ECW quality, not great, not a classic, not even bad.  Just good.  (6/10)

The Dudley Boys and Mr. Mustafa vs Axl Rotten, Balls Mahoney, and New Jack
While another reviewer might say this was one of the most brutal cage matches they've seen, I must have seen too many (or too few) to consider this particularly brutal (for one, I point to Triple X vs AMW at TNA Turning Point 2004), but it was certainly, like the main event for Heatwave 98, fanservice for those who prefer the hardcore over the athleticism.  I didn't like it, but it was good.  (8/10)

While this was a good event, it was clearly a whole lot different from the ECW of 1997-1998 during its height.  In my mind, this was a good event, but could've used a bit more ECW.",1207353600,,3444,4.514563106796117
7966242,3,B00006ADEV,"I get all my ECW from ECW666 Videos. They have every ECW show in its entirety and are authentic, not Vince's version. Check them out at [...] . I get my videos within 3 days of ordering and they have the best prices hands down...",1142035200,,229,4.111111111111111
7966243,5,B00006ADEV,"Cyberslam 1999 takes place in the ECW arena in Philly. It starts off with a very young Tajiri fighting Jerry Lynn. The two have a great match and it sucks that now Tajiri isn't that quick anymore.  Then there is a dumb segment with Lance Storm asking Tommy Dreamer to take a steroid test. I just looked at Dawn Marie the whole time. Then there is a match with Nova fighting Rod price, their tag team partners get involved and it has a cool ending. Then you have Super Crazy vs Mosco de la Merced, this is a great Lucha match which shows super crazy as a real wrestler and not a gimmick. Then you have TAKA Michinoku vs Papi Chulo. The two have a decent battle that is worth watching. Rob Van Dam vs 2 Cold Scorpio. This match is one of RVD's many times that he defended the TV title so guess who won the match, but it is still very good. Taz vs Chris Candido let's just say that Taz will choke you out. Shane Douglas vs Justin Credible this match has a funny as hell intro by shane when the first words out of his mouth are ""YOU FU(KING PU$$Y!"" The match is great thought, unlike WWF they don't talk forever. Finally the main event: Dudley's and Mr. Mustafa vs Balls Mahoney, Axl Rotten, and New Jack. This is a real main event!! Everything is used, and you will see some things that WWF bootlegged from them (as usual). All in all this DVD is great and a must buy for people who live for ECW.",1125014400,,1393,4.159259259259259
7966244,5,B00006ADEV,"Just like you, I long for the days of ECW. The only way I can relive these times is through the releases by Pioneer. I stumbled upon on this dvd on a whim. I never saw this event, the card looked  excellent, so I paid my 22.48 plus shipping, and within 5 days, I was witnessing the best ECW event I've ever seen. People always say Heatwave '98 was the best ever. It's hard to disagree with that statement, UNTIL you see Cyberslam '99. My fave matches are:

Super Crazy vs. Mosco de la Merced - 10/10 - Holy f'n crap. Lucha libre's never looked so good. I would actually consider this half cruiserweight, half hardcore match. When your name is Super Crazy, you be better deliver and he certainly did. I never heard of this Mosco guy, but this match is worth the price of this dvd. There's a reason everyone else is giving this match their highest rating.

Taka Mchinoku vs. Papi Chulo - 9.0/10 - Yes, WWE's Taka vs. yes, the wrestler formerly known as Essa Rios. This was another clinic. A little short, but they made the most of their time.

RVD vs. 2 Cold Scorpio - I've only seen Scorpio twice, but he and his opponent as always put on entertaining matches. RVD takes a wicked kick to the face, OUCH!  Scorpio is one of the few wrestlers who actually gives RVD a run for his money.

Taz vs. Chris Candido - 9/10 - I'll be honest, I was never a big Taz fan, and for that matter, I was never a big fan of Skip, I mean Chris Candido, but this was an excellent match. People complain about the ending, but if you think about Candido's history with his neck, it makes sense. I saw moves in this match I've never seen before.

Shane Douglas vs. Justin Credible - 10/10  - I became an ECW fan very late, in 2000. So I'm a HUGE Justin Credible fan (Long live the IMPACT PLAYERS). This match was old school vs. new school. Excellent pyschology and the hardest chops you'll ever see. When Justin chopped Douglas, it sounded like a gunshot, once again, OUCH. I was very surprised about the outcome of this match.

I'm too drunk to write about the other matches, but believe me, I have never been so impressed with a wrestling dvd as I was for this one. Hell, I didn't even review Jerry Lynn vs. Tajiri!",1113350400,,2193,4.277777777777778
7966245,4,B00006ADEV,"This event was great, even though i expected more tables, but all in all a great event.
1. Jerry Lynn vs Tajiri: Tajiri's debut match. It has some stiff kicks from tajiri (as always) cool counters & some holds, 4/5
2. Nova and Chris Chetti vs Rod Price and Skull Von Krush: This is a card filler, skip it. 1/5
3. Super Crazy vs Mosco de la Merced: Mexican Extreme Lucha Libre, this match is great those two are ""locos"" they turned this wrestling match into an aerial warfare! Creazy is Insane and so is el mosco. 5/5
4. TAKA Michinoku vs Papi Chulo (Essa Rioss): Another aerial warfare brought to you by ECW, the fans welcomed back TAKA and he didn't let them down, the match included some wicked moves like an inverted suplex into a michinoku driver!! and a great display of moves by Essa Rios so bad that the match was so short 4.5/5
5. Rob Van Dam (c) vs 2 Cold Scorpio: I've never seen 2 cold Scorpio perform before and i was quite impressed when i saw what he can do (sommersault leg drop, a variation of an arabian press), RVD is good as always. This match includes the stiffest kick I've ever seen (I thought RVD was KO'd!), some interference by sabu. Cool match 4.5/5
6. Taz vs Chris Candido: This match could have been great but the spot whre Taz ""break's  candido's neck blow the match, the ending is cool. 3/5
7. Shane Douglas vs Justin Credible: ok match lot's of canning and blood (hey shane nice blade job!! _!!) cool match, 2 tables were used and an appeareance by dreamer 3.5/5
8. Dudley's and Mr. Mustafa vs Balls Mahoney, Axl Rotten, and ""The original gangsta"" New Jack: B R U T A L match.. lots of blood a cheese grater, a fork and a whole other bunch of weapons are included in this cage war. nice guitar shot by new jack, 3.5/5 (I'm not a fan of those guys)
You shoul give it a try it's a cool event! _!!",1061683200,4,1825,4.244252873563219
7966246,2,B00006ADEV,YES THIS DVD IS OVER PRICED BOTTOM LINE ECW CYBERSLAM 99 WASNT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED FROM PAUL E. HEYMAN ....,1041724800,,107,4.142857142857143
7966247,5,B00006ADEV,"Personally I thought this event was missing something, up until the main event there was only 4 tables used, 2 in one match. The Wrestling makes up for the lack of extreme and the main event just takes it past the EXTREME!
1. Jerry Lynn vs. Yoshihiro Tajiri (Debut). Tajiri, hit with Grey and Blue design short tights, with matching kneepads and blue boots, is a rookie in his debut match in ECW, barring a shaved face. Still the ruthless Japenese Buzzsaw that we all grew to love, though! Great methodical match with tremendous Counters and holds in this match. (4.5/5)
2. Nova and Chris Chetti vs. Rod Price and Skull Von Krush. The match starts off really boring in a one on one match with Nova (Same costume and stupid movements without the face paint) vs. Rod Price. Boring start but then Skull Von Krush comes out and starts the beating on Nova until Chris Chetti comes out and makes the save and the match ends about two minutes later. (1/5)
- Lance Storm/Tommy Dreamer Altercation. Everyone made it sound like it's a huge altercation, it's not. He takes Lance Storm's urine sample and pours it on Lance.
3. Super Crazy vs. Mosco de la Merced (Extreme Lucha Libre). Awesome match, very lucha but involved alot more high flying then I expected. Both of these men are excellent Cruisers and would love to see them in NWA: TNA (Where they care about the talent) or WWE (Where JR Tells You To TONE IT DOWN!). Super Crazy was extra special in this match and it's going down as a great Extreme Lucha Libre match, just like Juventud Guererra vs. Rey Misterio Jr. did! (5/5)
4. TAKA Michinoku vs. Papi Chulo. Named Essa Rios in the WWE, Papi Chulo and TAKA Michinoku show why they were the most under-utilized cruiserweights in the WWE! This match is awesome and TAKA just continue's to impress me and Papi Chulo takes my image of Essa Rios and takes it to the Extreme. (4.5/5 - Too Short!)
5. Rob Van Dam (c) vs. 2 Cold Scorpio (ECW Television Championship). Both men set out to impress but comes out short. My expectations of 2 Cold Scorpio were never high (not a fan) but this match disappointed me and I though It could have been better. Rob Van Dam and 2 Cold Scorpio, despite both being high-flyers, did not gel too well together. IMO it seemed they held back a little, and Triple H wasn't even in ECW! Despite being praised by alot of people, 2 Cold Scorpio has never raised my eyebrow for any match. But he did hit a nice variation arabian moonsault. Sabu makes an impact as the first table of the event was utilized in this match!(4/5)
6. Taz (c) vs. Chris Candino w/. Tammy Lynn Sytch (ECW World Heavyweight Championship). They kind of wasted what was to be an excellent match with a stupid ending but another table was used! Chris Candino impressed me in this match, more than he has ever and I am not the biggest Candino fan. (4/5 - Bad Ending!)
7. ""The Franchise"" Shane Douglas w/. Francine vs. Justin Credible w/. Jason and Unknown Woman (Jazz). Good match but got boring in parts. A total of 4 tables all together on this pay per view so far, as two tables were used in this match. Nice sequence of the Signapore Cane at the ending mark of the match.
8. The Dudley Boys and Mr. Mustafa vs. Balls Mahoney, Axl Rotten, and ""The Gangsta"" New Jack (Steel Cage Match). One of the most brutal cage matches I have witnessed (Besides the Hardcore History cage match)! Match starts without New Jack as ""He left the building"" 30 to 45 minutes before this match. D-Von Dudley vs. Axl Rotten to start the match off. Soon after Buh Buh Ray Dudley is brought into the mix, then Axl and finally Mustafa. New Jack appears as the countdown ends seconds earlier. The Six man tag is brutal, violent and took this pay per view to the extreme. Good aftermath as well. (4.5/5)
All in all, I recommend this DVD over almost all other Pay Per View DVD's. Won't be disappointed!",1037404800,9,3866,4.469589816124469
