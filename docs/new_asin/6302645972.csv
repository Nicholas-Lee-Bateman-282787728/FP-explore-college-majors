7828642,5,6302645972,"This is an unscary but quite effective Greggains workout. She rolls on your legs for 30 minutes with mostly squats, a bit of back lunges, and twisting your legs on the floor. To me, the floor work is most effective for the buns, but you will see that cottage cheese disappearing if you stick with it. Girlfriend is the way to go with this workout! If you're an advanced exerciser, then use ankle weights to get the results. You can't lose.",1249776000,2,439,4.432098765432099
7828643,4,6302645972,"I've had this video for a number of years and always return to it. It has a warm-up followed by approximately 12 mins of floor abdominal work using a chair on which to prop your feet, followed by the second half in which no chair is used. All the moves are basic and familiar. No moves are out of the reach of the beginner. The key to this tape is variety, and endurance. Joanie moves without hesitation from one exercise to the next. The workout is almost aerobic in nature. All parts of the abdominal wall are worked. She is constantly queing and giving out tidbits of information. I would recommend this video for any level of exerciser.",999388800,11,640,4.432203389830509
