901169,4,6304509022,"A nice concept by Rhino, having the four Monkees select and discuss their favorite episodes.  The dvd shows the episodes in their entirity with bonus features including commercials featuring the Monkees and interviews with  the band.  Three of the four episodes are excellent, but the Davy Jones  entry (Out to Sea) is a little weak.  Since no other Monkees TV episodes  are currently available on dvd,  this disc is a must for any Monkees fan  who wants to see the shows on a digital format.  It also makes for a nice  introduction to the group's shows for the new or casual fan.",955324800,19,580,4.598039215686274

901256,4,6304509022,"This DVD gives a sample of some of the Monkees TV episodes that the Monkees picked themselves as their favorites.
Two of my favorite episodes were Peter Tork's ""Monkees vs. Machine"" and Micky Dolenz's ""Frodis Caper."" The comments that the Monkees talked about were very good.  I especially liked Peter's comments on his episode.  The only reason I gave four stars to this DVD was because of the picture quality of the episodes.  They are watchable but have not been remastered.

If you are a Monkees fan, this DVD is for you.  Let's also hope that all of the Monkees episodes are re-released soon!",1310860800,,597,4.701923076923077

Anyway, she thinks the DVD is AWESOME, and the Monkee's rock. I think the DVD is pretty good. Nice to see the guys as they are now, and hear their comments about the 4 episodes on the disc. Well worth the money if you are a fan of the Monkee's, or of campy 60's tv shows!",1245110400,2,447,3.923076923076923

901329,5,6304509022,"I enjoyed the Monkees when I was a kid, and having them on DVD now is fantastic!  I love the slapstick humor and irreverance they exhibit, and to have their take on their favorite episodes thrown in there on top of it all was a very nice touch!",1192060800,,244,4.083333333333333
901330,3,6304509022,"The main reason I bought this DVD was ""The Frodis Caper"", in which Dolenz mocks the show itself while thumbing his nose at the censors with marijuana references(I imagine Micky and Jon Anderson engaged in a lotta Maryjane kissing while writing the story).

  It looks pretty much like a forerunner to their film ""Head"" and was clearly an indication on what the show would be like had it not been cancelled.

  The second reason was Mike's fave ""Fairy Tale"", which I haven't seen in 40 years. For some reason, it was never syndicated with the rest of the series. It wasn't as good as ""Frodis"", but it was a nice change from the usual Monkee tale.

  The other two, Davy's ""Hitting the High Seas""(a waterlogged Pirate Movie parody) and Peter's ""Monkees vs. Machine""(an sudtle attack on dehumanization.) were funny the first time, but after the next thousand times they get a little stale. You want these, buy the complete set.",1189382400,2,924,4.725
901331,5,6304509022,"GREAT DVD! it's funny, and worth seeing. the music is still good too. I've watched it a dozen times, and it's still hilarious.",1182816000,3,126,4.521739130434782
901332,3,6304509022,"I could never get this DVD to play in my DVD player.  It will play in my computer.  As a result, I have never actually watched it.  I have never had a disk fail to work in my DVD player before.  Perhaps this was just a bad disk.",1173916800,,228,3.6875
901333,5,6304509022,"In this DVD, the Monkees Davy, Peter, Micky and Mike pick their personal favourite episodes from their 60's series - 'Hitting the high seas', 'Monkees verses Machine', 'The Frodis caper', & 'Fairy tale' respectively. So you get the four episodes (naturally) and bit of reminiscing from each said Monkee (from the late 1990's). The episodes were all filmed in late 1967 (prog 44, 48 & 58), except for Peters filmed in June 1966 (prog 3). My daughter (11) wanted to see some episodes after singing 'I'm a believer' in her school choir and subsequently borrowing my new Monkees CD set - 'The Definitive Monkees limited edition two CD set' (also recommended).

My daughter has enjoyed watching this DVD many times, and particularly likes the 'Machine bit with Mike' (in Peter's episode choice). So highly recommended if going cheap. The complete Monkees 1st and 2nd series are now available though on DVD for diehard fans (which must include my daughter as she now has them both as well - and it all started from this DVD title).",1166832000,2,1025,4.823863636363637
901334,4,6304509022,Just this four shows brought back a lot of memories of my youth. It was priceless to see the old ceral commercials that were smartly installed in the shows. I would like to see more of dvds with special shows because the box sets can be rather costly and it was nice to see the favorite shows of the funny four. I was able to see the Monkees on their 20th anniversary tour and if you would have told me when I was young I would have ever seen them in person I would not have believed it. That makes seeing these shows even more precious to my memories because I loved these guys so much I had all their records and as an adult have converted my collection to include all of their cds. I will eventually be able to add more of their dvds to my collections when I can. This is a nice sneak peak into my past loves lives. Thanks,1154649600,11,825,4.036585365853658
901335,5,6304509022,"I am a first-generation Monkee fan and really enjoy escaping back to the funny stories and music of that time.  I had a VHS tape that I taped from their run on television (like MTV), but this is trully a collector's item.  I loved seeing the guys and hearing their comments on the stories.  My favorite was ""Fairy Tale"".  Mike really did a great job as Gwen.",1140998400,6,358,4.298507462686567

901405,4,6304509022,"This disc was Rhino's first attempt to package Monkee episodes in the then-new DVD format.  Clips of each of the Monkees from their 1997 documentary are used to introduce their favorite episodes.
It has already been noted that the episode that Davy mentions is really ""Royal Flush""  (""Hitting the High Seas"" is shown instead as his favorite).  ""Royal Flush"" would have been a better choice because it would've balanced the DVD better to have 2 episodes from the first season and 2 from the second, instead of having 3 from the second and only 1 from the first.
The film quality was a bit of a disappointment, especially during parts of ""Fairy Tale"".  The quality is much better on Rhino's second Monkee DVD (Monkees Volume 1 & 2) although there are some good moments on this disc.  Some of the episodes have the original end credits with Kellogg's products.  It's fun on both discs to pause the picture and use the ""step"" button on your DVD remote to discover things that have never been noticed before on VHS copies.
The chapter breaks are much better than on Rhino's second Monkee DVD and there are actually breaks for all of the songs in each episode; even the Kellogg's commercial shown during Mijacogeo has a chapter break.
Since the DVD format was still young when Rhino released this, it has no extras, not even closed-captioning.  It's too bad that the Monkees couldn't have recorded audio commentary in addition to introducing the episodes.  A photo gallery and some more Kellogg's commercials wouldn't been a nice extra also.
Fans desparate for any Monkee episodes on DVD will want to pick this up but keep in mind that the VHS edition is packaged better in a retro-style metal Monkee lunchbox with a mini-ceral box and puzzle.  This DVD will have to do as a ""stand in"" until Rhino gets around to issuing the entire series on DVD.",1027728000,58,1840,4.6894409937888195
901406,2,6304509022,"First off, I'm a 1st-gen fan (yes, I'm very old) and since this DVD has been well-covered by other reviewers, I wanted to use this space to explain Davy's choice of ""Hitting The High Seas"".
When this DVD was being produced, Davy was in the center of a protracted and one-sided snit with Michael Nesmith... seems the mystery surrounding Mike had drawn all the attention away from Davy, the self-professed heart-throb of the group, and Davy is not one who relinquishes attention easily. Its widely known that he chose this particular episode as his ""fave"" because Mike doesn't appear in it for more than 3 minutes!",1024444800,10,612,4.783018867924528
901407,4,6304509022,"I could see why ""Royal Flush"" and ""Mijaceogeo"" were included because the former is acknowledged as the first episode, and the the latter is the last.  ""Hitting The High Seas"" was one of my least favorite Monkees' episodes when I was a kid, and it continue to be.  ""Fairy Tale"" with Mike in drag as a bratty princess is good.
A better episode involving Davy with royalty would have been the one where he is a lookalike for a prince who's too shy to talk to women.  Also, the pilot, where the band is hired for a sweet sixteen party (and Davy falls for the birthday girl), could have been included (esp. for the screen tests of the guys at the end of the show).
I don't understand why there are three offerings from the second season, which had a lot of hit-and-miss episodes, when most of the first season shows were better.",1008720000,2,823,4.366013071895424
901408,5,6304509022,This is the first item I have bought through Amazon.com. They are very professional in their ordering and shipping process. My Monkees lunchbox/VCR tape/puzzle are a treasured possession in my home now. Even my children love to watch the MY FAVORITE EPISODES tape. The package was prompt in getting here and in good shape when it arrived. I love it!! The tape and all are wonderful. I've already put the Monkee puzzle together. I've always wanted their lunchbox and NOW I have it. YAY! I've watched the tape at least 3 times already. Maybe more. I just can't get enough MONKEES so I plan to order more Monkee items thru Amazon. Your prices are great also. Thanks!,998870400,2,663,4.6752136752136755
901409,5,6304509022,"I bought this DVD for my kids because they enjoy watching the Monkees. They already have a tape of them but they can recite the words! I would recommend this to anyone who likes the Monkees or who just wants to relive part of the 60's. It is very entertaining because my wife and I also sit down and watch it. Our favorite episode was ""Fairy Tale"".",997574400,,348,4.208955223880597
901410,3,6304509022,"Rhino really screwed up when they tried to figure out which episode Davy liked the best.  They included ""Hitting the High Seas"" on the disk, but Davy was actually refering to the first televised episode, ""Royal Flush"".
Davy said he liked the one with him fencing.  He also mentioned that the episode won an Emmy award.  Well, ""Royal Flush"" has Davy fencing, *and* it won an Emmy.  ""Hitting the High Seas"" has some sword-play, but it didn't win any awards.  (Davy also spoke of ""fencing on a table"" which is unique to ""Royal Flush"".)
If Rhino included ""Royal Flush"", then this disk would have featured the first (televised) episode, the last episode, and it would have been a much better presentation.",988070400,16,700,4.75206611570248
901411,2,6304509022,"I love the Monkees! So I'm not here to rain on anyone's lunch(box), but let's quickly review this collection for a minute. Each and every Monkee presents and discusses their favorite episode. Now if you're saying to yourself, ""Sounds great! I really CARE about the episodes THEY think are hillarious, and I can't believe I get a lunchbox to boot?"". Well, you may have a winner here. But if you're saying to yourself, ""I'd really like to see some of them old episodes again...oh, yeah, and the comments would be entertaining"", (e.g., 99% of the rest of us), then understand just why its being offered with a lunchbox. Read on...
Looking at the individual episodes: ""Fairy Tale,"" ""The Frodis Caper,"" and ""Hitting The High Seas,"" we have less laughs than Martha Stewart pressing parsley. Now maybe the Monkees themselves thought these particular episodes were hillarious, but you and I weren't offered the luxery of eating hash brownies while tuning in to Sgt Pepper between takes on the set. I mean, ANYTHING would have probably seemed funny at the time. Now granted, the episode ""Monkees vs. Machine"", (Tork's favorite), was classic, BUT it still won't make up for the other weaker episodes. Here's a brief synopsis of what you're getting into:
""Hitting the High Seas"" (Davy's favorite), has them joining up as seamen only to find out their captain is going to hijack the Queen Elizabeth.
Note: no laugh track.
Problem: one is definitely needed to remind us that it is supposed to be funny.
""Frodis Caper"" (Mickey's favorite), hey remember that episode with the big pulsing eye that froze people to their TV sets and it was really psychadelic and it was...oh never mind
Note: directed by Dolenz (...and you were wondering why it was Mickey's favorite?)
Problem: directed by Dolenz
""Fairy Tale"" (Mike's favorite), to be honest here, this was a cute episode, but certainly not classic Monkees material
Note: I can't remember how many takes they had to do during the filming of this particular episode, you might want to begin by multiplying
Problem: remember me mentioning the hash-brownies?
Anyway, for most of us, the Monkees episodes were full of sun, fun, and great little bubble-gum pop songs done to such visuals as the boys running (or riding a dune-buggy), across the sunny beaches of CA, riding bareback near the ocean, being chased by villians, girls chasing Davy, Davy chasing girls, etc. If anyone of those scenes embodies the Monkees for you. Then you'd do well to look elsewhere for some of the better material.",984960000,18,2522,4.908665105386417
901412,4,6304509022,"The metal lunchbox is probably the best thing about this set for ""serious"" Monkees fans, but the video is a pleasant diversion for  anyone.  Davy's chosen episode is extremely weak.  However, Peter's episode  is a classic 'traditional' Monkees episode (the story of how they foil the  plans of a greedy toy company owner).  Micky's entry is the one that he  directed, and Mike's is the Monkees' spoof of fairy tales, featuring Mike  playing Princess Gwen.  The interviews between the episodes are not very  long, so don't expect too much more than the episodes themselves.  A good  bet for casual fans of the series, or those wanting a video to brighten a  rainy afternoon.",967334400,12,673,4.849557522123894
