8620894,5,B00G5G7R2M,"What a gem of a special. A quarter of a century ago, Neil Diamonds Christmas album was the focus on a show in HBO and this is truly a holiday classic. Diamond is at the top of his game here with his distinct vocals offering unique takes on holiday standards from his uplifting blend of O Come, O Come Emmanuel"" and We Three Kings Of Orient Are to a barbershop take on God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen. Even Morning Has Broken, not exactly a Christmas song, hits home here. Diamonds gentle You Make It Feel Like Christmas is a great original song and his take on White Christmas will stay with you (I, yi, yi, yim dreaming...). Diamond shines here and his charisma and connection to the audience will stay with you. Easily one of the best musical specials I associate with the holidays. How is this not on DVD? Highly recommended.",1513555200,,824,4.427631578947368
