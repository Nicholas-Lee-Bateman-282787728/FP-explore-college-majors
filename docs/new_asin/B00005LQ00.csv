1622893,5,B00005LQ00,LL Cool j At his acting best it's like the part was written with him in mind and nobody could have played it better definitely worth watching You don't know what your missing,1317859200,,174,4.303030303030303
1622894,3,B00005LQ00,Its always good to see Victoria Dillard!!!!!  The film was decent given the era in which it was made.  The acting from LL is actually surprisingly good considering that this was one of his earlier works.  Get this for your collection.,1272931200,,234,4.658536585365853
1622895,3,B00005LQ00,"The only reason I got this was because of Gene Anthony Ray in a very minor role. I could have cared less about LL running around without a shirt on or him doing the damn thang with Victoria Dillard (Spin City) on a picnic table.

It's directed by Debbie Allen and prodcued by Tim Reid. As far as I am concerned, this should be in your collection because black people are behind the scenes.",1196467200,,389,4.256756756756757
1622896,3,B00005LQ00,"Out of Sync was a mid 1990's film that was set up as a vehicle for LL Cool J (James Todd Smith), and following New Jack City and Deep Cover, it follows in the African-American themed ""Urban Noir"" sub-genre of crime thrillers.  The film was produced independently (the BET network was involved with financing), it was given limited release in 1995 (apparently, one copy was made, shopped around to several major urban markets over the course of a few months) before eventually showing up on home video.  The film was directed by Debbie Allen (the former Fame actress who became a prolific TV director, and who has a cameo here) and also co-produced by Tim Reid (Venus Flytrap on WKRP in Cincinnati).  Here, LL plays Jason ""The Saint"" St. Julian, a popular hip-hop nightclub DJ who became a mainstream MTV-style celebrity, but who fell on hard times when his drug abuse got out of control.  At this point, he's living in a run-down apartment, owes money to a loan shark, and because no clubs will hire him, he's forced to DJ illegal rave gigs for cash.
A cop named Caldwell (Howard Hesseman) crashes Jason's latest party, and at the police station, gives him an offer--become a police informant on a drug dealer the police are targeting, or go to jail.  Jason agrees to the deal, and soon ends up the personal DJ for the lavish parties that a prominent drug dealer, Danny, gives--only, he also winds up being caught in the spell of Monica Collins (Victoria Dillard), the drug lord Danny's current girlfriend.  Eventually, Jason finds out that Monica is the sister to a former girlfriend of the gangster, and she intends on getting revenge--so Jason is torn--does he continue to inform on his boss and risk being killed, or does he continue his flirtation with Monica and risk being killed?  Seemingly, his only other option is jail time--and of course, there's still the matter of ducking the loan shark.  As in many such films, friends and enemies are not always what they seem.

All the actors do a decent job, given the low-budget circumstances.  Dillard as the femme fatale is very pretty, and yes, she does get a love scene with the hero.  Other actors in the film include Yaphet Kotto (""Homicide: Life on the Street"", ""Running Man"") as Quincy, bar owner and a friend to Jason's late father who gives him friendly advice; also, future Mad TV actor Aries Spears plays Jason's buddy Frank.

Trivia:  At the time, Allen and LL were co-stars on the sitcom In the House, which lasted 1 and  seasons on NBC before moving to UPN (where Allen's character was dropped).",1165104000,,2563,4.704697986577181
1622897,3,B00005LQ00,"This is an Okay Movie for LL Cool J. This is really early in his movie career so you can see his comfortable transition to the screen. I liked Ariel Spears as his buddy. The plot was mediocre and Victoria Dillard played her part well, but her I realized her outcome by the scene at the disco with her boyfriend the drug dealer",1152489600,2,326,4.190476190476191
1622898,3,B00005LQ00,"This was a decent movie to see.  Any movie with LL Cool J in it is worth seeing, especially when he is sexin up a beautiful woman.

1622899,5,B00005LQ00,"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS REALLY GREAT, SENSUAL, AND A REAL BACK STABBER.  YOU NEVER KNEW WHO WAS PLAYIN' WHO, UNTIL THE VERY END.  IT WAS ONE OF LL COOL J'S BEST FLICKS.  I SUGGEST YOU BUY IT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.  IT'S A  SHAME THIS MOVIE DIDN'T GET THE PROPER RESPECT FROM THE MOVIE INDUSTRY.  I  ALSO ENJOYED THE SOUNDTRACK.  UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T FIND IT (YET). BUT  I'LL KEPP ON SEARCHING. IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE I CAN GET MY HANDS ON A COPY,  JUST E-MAIL ME AT DDSTeach@MSN.COM",950572800,7,483,4.325842696629214
