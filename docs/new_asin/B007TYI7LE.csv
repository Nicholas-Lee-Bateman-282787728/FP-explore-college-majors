5110008,5,B007TYI7LE,"Hello Folks
This Murphy movie is I believe one of his top 5 movies he ever made. This movie is superior to ""The Fast Gun"" and similar in quality to my favorite Murphy film ""No Name on the Bullet"". Actually in reality, I have never seen an Audie Murphy film I haven't liked.  It simply is a question of degree of liking.  Burl Ives is an interesting singing and strumming friend of the Hassards.  Ives plays a role very different from many of his other films.  Here he can act tough but is gentle and wise with children.
 Ring Hassard (Murphy) and his dad (Dean Jagger) have a hidden valley in the mountains where they capture and tame wild horses. Their cabin is also hidden and it is the type of setting people today would love to camp in rustic yet comfortable. The story line runs about a dad who is blamed for a murder he didn't commit and escapes seriously injured from a fire and (lynch mob attitude) town to the hidden valley(mountain) along with his wife.  His wife is only referred to in the movie dies in the hidden valley cabin during their first year (all Ring says is that life on the mountain was very hard. We are left guessing if his mother died giving birth to their son Ring (Murphy) or from some other sickness. Ring's Dad has to raise him alone. Ring is taught that the people in the town below the mountain are not to be trusted nor visited but only by exception. When Murphy goes into town he only uses his first name Ring because his dad and the Hassard name are thought dead but otherwise his dad would still be wanted for murder. Ring's secret becomes known and now his dad, the secret valley and their wild horses are in jeopardy.  The town's naive and anti Hassard prejudiced Sherriff let's a group of unsuspected horse thieves lead a vigilante pose to track down the Hassards. In reality the pose (horse thieves) want to steal the Hassard`s horses and kill Ring and his dad before the truth and true justice can be revealed and served.  Well the good guys win and Ring's dad is cleared from the murder charges by a self confessed dying bad guy who vindicates him.  Ring and his new and serious girl friend Riley Martin (Audie's actual wife in real life Wanda Hendrix) are headed for marriage and they live happily ever after. Hope you are high on Sierra like me.
Hope this helps.
Blessings,
Phil",1369440000,7,2323,4.421545667447306
5110009,4,B007TYI7LE,"Picture sharpness, sound, colors, everything can't be better. And you will wish to be in this western because of the beautiful landscabes it is shot in. Audie Murphy is always good, determined and angry. The plot goes a little here and then a little there and is not really convincing but okay. Burl Ives is a great singer but maybe he sings a little too much in this film. And, oh, watch out for very young Tony Curtis and James Arness with the names of Anthony Curtis and Jim Arness. And it is always great to see mainstay actor Jack Ingram, here as a sheriff.",1367884800,3,562,4.3619047619047615

5110011,5,B007TYI7LE,"I'm a big fan of A.M. I'd pretty much say he never made a bad movie....but, I know... he did....... but his isn't one of them.  It is stock plot and acting... it is typical Audy... well, I have to face it... I've just never seen a bad Audy flick... or at least...one I'd never say wasn't good in part.  This flick is worth the bread.  Don't hesitate to get it.  You will enjoy this movie.",1351555200,3,388,4.065789473684211
