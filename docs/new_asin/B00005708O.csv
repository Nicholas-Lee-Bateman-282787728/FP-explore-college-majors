8563548,4,B00005708O,"This is a clever tale about an ambitious, if unscrupulous, young man on the way up or else. It is funny and irreverent, though in a slightly dated ambience. I am not giving it a five because the print has been resized to wide screen bu cutting off the top and bottom of the original framing. It means lots of headless dialog and action.",1483315200,,336,4.265625
8563549,3,B00005708O,"I will always enjoy anything with Alan Bates in it, but the pacing of the plot was at times sudden and jarring and the editing of the film sometimes made no sense - as in it felt like I was still in the middle of one scene and then it suddenly switched to the next. Though blushing, I will still admit that as this movie was made by the British for the British with no real anticipation of reaching an American audience, they had a lot more colloquialisms than I was used to and there were a couple of people that I could NOT understand for the life of me until I had acclimated to it (the fast, low-volume mumbling British accents). The performances, though, as to be expected of the theatrical school of actors based out of London was as ever top notch. I do not regret the purchase (and happily was able to watch it on my computer, though not on my American format DVD player) as this movie is so rarely in print nowadays, that it is worth the watch just to see what the generations will be missing out on if not carefully preserved! For whatever reason, I suppose based on the trailers and snippits I had seen, I had anticipated it would be more zany than it actually was (I got the vibe of ""The Trouble with Harry"" from the trailer/snippits with the trunk going up the stairs), but in reality it was a more lighthearted, comical version of Laurence Harvey's ""Room at the Top,"" which oddly enough I had watched just days before.",1442188800,,1432,4.327137546468402
8563550,5,B00005708O,"As a longtime Alan Bates fan, I find it frustrating that several of his best films aren't on DVD, and this smart black comedy is one of them. Clever script, sharp performances, memorable scenes--too many people are missing out on this forgotten gem.",1343347200,7,249,4.813953488372093
8563551,5,B00005708O,"One of the best performances ever by Bates and Elliot from Rafael's terrific, witty script.",1198368000,6,91,5.133333333333334
