7933746,5,B000059PET,"Kevin Kline is the most versatile, multi-talented actor ever.  No matter what he does, it's done perfectly.  Wish he'd get more parts while we still have him with us.  I just love this man!",1440979200,,189,4.5
7933747,3,B000059PET,"This film is truly educational to watch for any student or aspiring actor.  While I don't consider Kline's HAMLET the greatest ever, there is certainly something to be learned from his use of verse.  An excellent speaker and player of language, Kline explores the full range that Shakespeare's text has to offer.  Sadly, however, I found his performance almost startlingly melodramatic and gratuitous.  Interesting to see how far he has come as an actor since filming this.  While the supporting cast is quite strong and enjoyable to watch, I found Kline taking far too many opportunities to explore the pleasure he derives from hearing his own voice than approaching any semblance of honesty in his portrayal of this, one of Shakespeare's most difficult roles.  I think that it is quite difficult to film Shakespeare in the first place and this film utilizes an approach that is half stage and half film.  Not necessarily and effective technique, in that in trying to accomplish both, we miss out on a lot of the momentum of the work itself.",995500800,19,1042,4.886363636363637
7933748,5,B000059PET,"Made in 1986 and shown originally on Masterpiece Theatre on PBS, this is Hamlet at its finest. Kevin Kline brilliantly plays Hamlet. Set in a minimalist staging, this only helps to focus you more on the actors abilities. A definite must see for all Shakespeare lovers.",989280000,11,268,4.8478260869565215
