8318428,5,B001LM64IS,"Here is an easy and inexpensive way to build your collection of classic TV. Three classic series, The Lucy Show, Susie (Private Secretary), and I Married Joan.

Pop the discs in and have yourself a marathon of classic comedy. You'll find it much better than some of the new shows.",1368316800,2,424,4.379746835443038
