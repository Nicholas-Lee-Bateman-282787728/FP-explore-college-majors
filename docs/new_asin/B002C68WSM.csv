3904048,5,B002C68WSM,I didn't really realize how overlooked mushrooms are in the US.  Picking mushrooms is a big hobby in a lot of countries (Russia for example).  The documentary makes me want to study up on this really interesting subject.,1328745600,2,220,4.7631578947368425
3904049,1,B002C68WSM,"This movies has some useful information included in a large amount of speculation and inaccurate myths. All of the topic speakers are aged hippies, which is fine except they neglected to even take off their fantasy mushroom and tie-dye shirts or even stay in a lucid mindset for the movie. In a section where they're talking about several different mushrooms they sell at farmers markets with various qualities like curing a runny nose, they fail to mention the species other than ""It's this one -holds up-"". Included are small trivia bits about mushrooms, in one they bring up that Lewis Carroll is speculated to have written Alice in Wonderland partially based on fly agaric amanitas. This is pure conjecture, the book was written as a fairy tale for a little girl and also to refelct Carroll's views on newly developing theories of mathematics. Any actual documentary would have taken care to fact check high-school legends before quoting them.  Additionally there are several scenes where a narrator contradicts themselves (The mushroom grow this way because it's in a low carbon dioxide environment, the lack of oxygen is what causes this). Do not take any information here dear to heart, and DO NOT attempt to hunt mushrooms because the large blackish one supposedly cures a head cold.",1324425600,2,1291,5.004651162790697
3904050,4,B002C68WSM,"Gives you a little information on mushrooms, while following a ""mushroom gypsy"". Mostly made me wanna go do some some magic shrooms though. I enjoyed this film and have recomended it to some freinds.",1323907200,,199,4.882352941176471
3904051,2,B002C68WSM,"Eh, I guess I was expecting something over-flowing with information but this was just general knowledge about mushrooms.  Early they state that American know little about mushrooms, which is true, and then they proceed to give very little education about them.  If it does anything it makes me want to watch something with a little more facts about mushrooms, maybe that was it's intent. . .",1321401600,,391,4.909090909090909
3904052,4,B002C68WSM,"This a very entertaining guide to the world of Mushrooms.
It explains the do's and the don'ts for the first timers,
and everyone gets to taste the days bounty.
Very interesting to say the least.
We have put it on our to do list.
See you there.......",1312761600,,249,4.319148936170213
3904053,5,B002C68WSM,"I watched this movie after watching ""Grass"" by the same director, and to my surprise this movie was just as good. The surprising thing is how mushrooms of all shapes and sizes are discussed. The presentation is entertaining with a lot of clips from other media.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know more about mushrooms or biology.",1300320000,,353,4.693548387096774
3904054,3,B002C68WSM,"The first 5 minutes of the movie promise much. ""Wow,"" I was thinking, ""this is cheesy, but not too cheesy -- reasonably good 'special effects' and a quality documentary feel.""

The film moves along nicely from there, following the various mushroom gurus and fugiphiles as they go on forays, identify mushrooms in the field, speak at festival events, cook up mushrooms, and talk about mushroom induced hallucinations.

If you like colourful characters and getting to know enthusiasts with their blushingly wonky theories about the role of mushrooms in the evolution of our species, you will like the film. It has an almost tongue in cheek feel to it, a sort of halfhearted attempt to present what is clearly an eccentric subculture as objectively as possible.

So, for what it is, it is entertaining and even educational with animated interludes reminiscent of Bill Nye or the Nature Nut showing a little mushroom coming out and quizzing us on our mushroom knowledge. These have a nice ""don't take this too seriously"" feel to them too.

So, why not a higher rating? Frankly, this film doesn't do anything really well. It is not a straight forward documentary like a NOVA or National Geographic episode delving into the science of the mushrooms and their effects on the body, it is not a big-business-bashing muckraking expose showing the mushroom industries efforts to keep people from finding free mushrooms all on their own, and it is not a ""how-to"" video on finding, cooking, and enjoying mushrooms. It touches on all these things, but feels like the film maker never really made up his mind on what the film would be.

Now I actually am fine with the ""skipping stone"" approach to documentaries, giving a general overview of the subject as a sort of aperitif to deeper investigation. Trouble is, this film skips onto some rather odd folks. The experts don't come across as either reputable or credible, except for the enthusiastic Larry Evans, who we see in the field teaching the newbies. Gary Lincoff is underwhelming and the absence of fugi superstar Paul Stamets leaves me wondering if Mr. Stamets would not have anything to do with the project, and if that is true, I wonder why?

If you are curious about mushroom hunting, this film is enjoyable enough and reasonably well filmed, but if you are seriously interested in mushroom hunting, you will probably already know everything in this film, and enjoy it only as a sort of ""hmmmm, I guess I better be careful who I associate with in this subculture"" kind of way. Which is to say, I think this gives a distorted view of people interested in mushrooms.

I suppose what I was hoping for was an ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-In-This-Tea/dp/B001ORQSMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All In This Tea</a>"" and what I got was something closer to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Religulous/dp/B001MFNB5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Religulous</a>.""",1289606400,4,2978,5.270042194092827
3904055,5,B002C68WSM,"It's hard to tell what a general audience will make of Ron Mann's new film Know Your Mushrooms. It opens with a clip from one of the first motion pictures ever, Georges Mlis' 1902 Trip to the Moon. After their rocket smacks the moon right in the eye, the astronauts disembark to discover that the moon is covered with what Mlis must have considered the most other-worldly of life forms: mushrooms.
The film segues to the almost equally fantastical Telluride Mushroom Festival--playful enthusiasts, funny hats, costumes, and ceremonial Tibetan bells. The opening credits explode with the psychedelic animation of Mike Roberts, colorful and sparkling--he makes fungus dance. Just as we're beguiled into a world of mushrooms that are funny, exotic and frivolous, the canny filmmaker brings things down to earth with film consultant and mycologist Gary Lincoff explaining that a fungal mat underlies and nurtures all life on earth.
I've followed Mann's work since his first film, Comic Book Confidential, which came out while I was researching my book on the history of MAD magazine. He's very good at illuminating the many facets of a subject in vivid ways. For Know Your Mushrooms he cleverly chooses two complementary guides. Lincoff and Larry Evans are both middle-aged white guys with an obsession with fungus, but their sensibilities quite different. Evans is a pig-tailed, brilliant, chatty, self-described ""mushroom gypsy"" who can hunt down, field-dress, and cook up our favorites while spouting a stream of fascinating facts and lore. By contrast, Gary Lincoff is a bona-fide mycologist and much-published author who speaks in paragraphs and fills the audience in on the scientific side of things wit and verve. Interestingly, Mann chooses to have the Lincoff, the scientist, describe an hallucinogenic experience. John Cage, Andrew Weil and Terrance McKenna also make short appearances in vintage footage (strangely, Paul Stamets, about whom a whole film could be made, is absent).
Know Your Mushrooms is a collage of information about fungi, including the culinary, spiritual, ecologically remedial, and scientific aspects. The film is interspersed with jokey quiz questions, posed by an anthropomorphized Boletus edulis that are sometimes funny and sometimes an annoying interruption. But the ditzy little guy keeps an information-laden film light, as does the rest of the fabulous animation by Roberts, which appears throughout the film in various artful ways. The soundtrack features lots of songs that have fungus as a theme (who knew?) that Mann has collected.
The film, which was produced in association with Bravo, is meant for a general audience, but it's definitely fun for a more knowledgeable aficionado--you won't learn much, but the mix of documentary footage, great cartoons, vintage film clips from an international selection of movies and documentaries is almost as fun as being at your favorite foray with all your hunting pals around you. And if you have friends and loved ones, even kids, who are perplexed or curious about this fascinating life form and the people who pursue it, Know Your Mushrooms is a wonderful, inspiring, introduction.

3904056,4,B002C68WSM,"Great movie! Lighthearted, informative, and nostalgic.  Ron Mann does a great job of bringing mushrooms to life with animation and old film clips while tripping along with real life fungophiles Gary Lincoff and Larry Evans. Fun movie for everyone!",1251763200,2,247,5.333333333333333

3904058,5,B002C68WSM,Puts the fun in to mushrooms. Knowledge gives you the power to judge you mushrooms. Different and informative. Very colorful.,1390953600,,125,5.3
3904059,5,B002C68WSM,"Saw this on the Indie channel but they had the wrong title listed on the TV guide list,so it was hard to find.

  If you love to eat mushrooms,or just like a cool and fun documentary,this is a great video!

  This was one of those great finds.",1386115200,,243,4.0638297872340425
3904060,5,B002C68WSM,"So many things I never knew about Mushrooms. The people in the video are interesting as well. I had no idea that people even went to festivals for mushrooms till I watched this video.

Choose this rating because if you have not watched and what to know more about Mushrooms you should watch this video.
I liked the whole video very much.
I would recommend this product to anyone interested in expanding their knowledge about mushrooms.",1364342400,3,435,4.723684210526316
3904061,4,B002C68WSM,"Know Your Mushrooms is a quirky documentary that mixes informational interviews, psychedelic imagery, vintage commercials, and high school-style pop quizzes and animations to provide a rather interesting overview of a segment of biology most often overshadowed by the plant and animal kingdoms. Upon first viewing, you aren't really sure what to make of the documentary as it begins with a radio broadcast and odd visual imagery that seems to have been created by somebody who might have actually been tripping on psychedelic mushrooms at the time. Despite its odd nature, the film is actually quite interesting and very informative. It certainly holds your attention, and because of these qualities would definitely be a good film for high school and/or college biology courses to use. Although the film does look into the psychedelic qualities of certain mushrooms, it isn't a documentary about drugs. Much more time is spent on mushrooms as a food source, as a medicine, and as an important part of the ecosystem. It pulls from the great knowledge of noted mycologist Gary Lincoff, but mushroom hunter Larry Evans is certainly the stand-out because of his hippy-like appearance and fun personality.",1358208000,,1201,5.260416666666667
3904062,4,B002C68WSM,"I'm not sure why the negative reviews. This is a well-made, entertaining documentary that provides a good introduction to mushrooms and the people who are fascinated by them. The film is whimsical with some fun graphics that were a lot more sophisticated than I had expected from I thought would be a really rough, low-budget affair. This is a polished piece of work. If you love mushrooms or want to introduce someone to them, I suspect you'll like this film.",1358121600,,460,4.7625
3904063,1,B002C68WSM,"I am so thoroughly disgusted with this documentary that I have stopped it and needed to write a review.  There is almost no usable information in this film.  The plot rambles along with no discerning direction.  I was expecting a feast of information similar to ""Forks over Knives"" or other fine documentaries.  Instead I sat through almost an hour of watching Tommy Chong's idiot unfunny brother.

Looking at some of these reviews, I don't understand how someone can give this movie 4 or 5 stars.",1356652800,,497,4.8
3904064,2,B002C68WSM,"I'm glad I got this from the library. I'm newly interested in mushroom hunting and was hoping for a factual overview. Instead, this film is a mishmash of elements that I imagine would be entertaining to some people, but I was disappointed. In fact, the emphasis on the odd types (read: aging hippies) at, for example, the Telluride Festival was a real turn-off, though I'm grateful to be prepared if, indeed, mushroom events are full of odd characters getting off on being eccentric and unkempt. Bottom line, this dvd isn't very factually informative, but is nonetheless interesting -- or not -- depending on what you're looking for.",1356566400,,633,4.925233644859813
