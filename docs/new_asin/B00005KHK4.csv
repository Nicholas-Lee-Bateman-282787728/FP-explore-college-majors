7943444,5,B00005KHK4,"The Romulan commander asked Spock if he claimed to human or Vulcan. Spock said Vulcan.  The commander assumed Vulcan would not lie, exploit, or be immoral.  The romulans revered the vulcans as a root of their civilization.  The commander believed herself capable of sharing with Spock.  We learn through the commander that Spock believes himself a superior being to the humans.  This explains his degrading attitude towards McCoy, the voice of reason.  Spock behavior is more about control and power which the romulan commander  the commander agrees to give Spock command for his loyalty.  The Vulcan exploits the commander believing his cruelty is a cultural exchange, but in reality, it offends her and she says, ""how could you have done this?"". Spock reasons the romulans are cruel and treachery to advance federation interest justifies his extreme cruelty.  Kirk gets the cloaking device, the commander, and escapes the neutral zone. Spock is revealed to be superior to the romulans.  The commander will be at his mercy for the intimacy the shared.

Cowboy diplomacy is based on the idea that deception can be used to acquire an interest.  Kirk and Spock view federation interest supreme to all other specie interests.  Therefore, their actions, no matter, how evil are justified.",1311724800,,1284,5.144927536231884
7943445,5,B00005KHK4,"My brother is a fan of the original Star Trek television series, and has specific episodes that he enjoys. I was very glad to see that it was possible to order them through your site. He is having a great time watching it and sharing it with his friends",1238112000,,253,4.183673469387755
7943446,3,B00005KHK4,"After several average at best volumes, the volume just before this one was a refreshing surprise as we finally got two very good episodes that represent some of the best ever in classic Trekdom.  Alas, it was too good to be true as we now get in this volume a very mixed bag.  The first episode, ""The Enterprise Incident"" is a very good one where Spock gets a chance to do the romancing for a change in this cloak and dagger episode which actually ranks among the best episodes of Season 3.

Too bad the second episode is such a dud though; this attempt at rehashing the very good ""Miri"" episode falls flat on its face although the theme of how the innocent is easily manipulated by the evil intentions of others is a compelling one.  Bad acting and a weak storyline make this a very forgettable and indeed regrettable episode.

However, based on the strength of the first episode alone, this volume may be worth picking up.  Overall, this volume would fall under the nice to have but not essential category if you are picking the ones to add to your library.",1168300800,,1059,4.461139896373057
7943447,5,B00005KHK4,"The Romulan commander is lead too believe that Spock being a Vulcan can not lie.  Spock in the ""Undiscovered Country"" will lie and surprise his student calling it an ""exaggeration"".  Spock tells the Romulan commander, it is true that he can not lie.  After applying the Vulcan death grip on Kirk; Kirk is thought to be dead and beamed over to the Enterprise, but not before he can steal the Romulan Stealth technology that will be used far into the future, in ""Next Generation"" by a futuristic Riker.  Spock is attracted by the Romulan commander, demonstrating Spock inability to complete supress his human feelings; his statements suggest cooperation and consent towards the Romulan commanders enticements; Spock wants too bridge the chasm that exists between the Romulans and Vulcans; the Romulan commander could have provided the perfect mate and opportunity for form peaceful relations between Vulcan and Romula; Roman commander offers Spock companionship, prestige in the Romulan empire, and command (enticement to his ego); it seems far into the future, Spock will as an ambassador attempt to bring the two peoples together by exchanging history, culture, and customs with an underground Romulan movement.  After Spocks betrayal becomes known too the Roman commander, he claims the right of explanation.  Spock defense for lying is loyality to the Federation, ""the means are justified by the ends"" argument. The Romulan commander may have discovered a flaw in Vulcan discipline and that is ""Vulcans have an ego""; the Romulan commander was very effective in exploiting that flaw.  Even after Spock is freed and the Romulan commander is being set to the brid, Spock still yearns for her and she perceives his desire and tells him, ""You had your chance"".  The Romulan commander exploits a second weakness in Spock and that is ""Vulcans are warlike""; Sarek wanted Spock to follow the family path of peace without force, Spock chose to the Federation in pursuit of science, an event that drove Father and Son apart for eighteen years;  Sarek was probably right, the Federation military capability appeal too his Vulcan Warlike instincts.  The Romulan commander recognized this propensities and offer military command comparable too a general with all the power, rights, and privileges; she could see in Spock the potential for him to become a powerful warlord in the Romulan empire.",1132876800,2,2382,5.1796875
7943448,4,B00005KHK4,"Volume 30 of the Star Trek DVD series will draw the buyer because of the classic ENTERPRISE INCIDENT episode. However it will also repel many because the episode has had the ill luck of being coupled with the worst episode that came out of the original series; AND THE CHILDREN SHALL LEAD.
Those who say the entire third season of Star Trek is bad obviously didn't see THE ENTERPRISE INCIDENT.  The episode finds the Enterprise crew venturing into Romulan territory under a secret mission.  The episode is well written and well acted.  Joan Linville makes a fine appearance as the Romulan Commander.  Her scenes with Spock are very memorable.  A great action packed story with some great moments make THE ENTERPRISE INCIDENT a classic definetly worth seeing.  Especially when Kirk is disguised as a Romulan.
There is no doubt in my mind that AND THE CHILDREN SHALL LEAD is the worst Star Trek episode of the entire series.  The plot tries to take a sort of 'Children Of The Damned' status but comes out as a joke.  The casting is terrible as several bad child actors were hired as well as lawyer Melvin Belli (of The Rolling Stone's Gimme Shelter fame) who was cast as the evil spirit whom controls the children.  The entire episode is totally unconvincing but particularily because Belli looks more like a Christmas tree than a threatening entity.  This is best viewed as a joke but watch it at your own risk.
Overall the DVD is worth getting for the classic ENTERPRISE INCIDENT and perhaps if you are bored you should watch AND THE CHILDREN SHALL LEAD but it is the worst episode of the bunch. Recommended but don't get mad at me if your disappointed I warned you about AND THE CHILDREN SHALL LEAD : )",1040688000,6,1703,4.627906976744186
7943449,4,B00005KHK4,"Volume 30 of Paramount's complete reissue of Classic Trek contains two contrasting episodes from Season Three.
The Enterprise Incident is a successful and riveting story, even though its plot--full of Nixonian plotting and plausible deniability--runs counter to Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek philosophy.  What makes this episode work is the taut writing, tight editing, powerful scoring, and excellent performances from all involved.  The scenes between Leonard Nimoy and guest star Joanne Linville--as the Romulan Commander smolder with erotic tension.  The visuals are also superior to most of the series.  However, some of the Romulan makeup looks rushed, with some clumsy ear appliances.
Despite an interesting concept, And The Children Shall Lead is not a success.  The episode, essentially an allegory about religious cults, is undone by tortured dialogue, weak plotting, and the most egregious incident of ""stunt"" casting in Trek history: Lawyer Melvin Belli portrays the evil Gorgon.  Dressed in a silver gown with a floral patterned collar, Belli looks like a second-rate televangelist in drag.  Most of this episode is so laughably ridiculous that it's best ignored or viewed as a party gag.  What a wasted opportunity.
No complaints about the picture and sound restoration.  However, Al Francis' lighting and camerawork lacks the beauty and subtlety of Jerry Finnerman's, who resigned after the second season.",998524800,5,1419,5.562790697674418
7943450,5,B00005KHK4,"The Enterprise Incident isn't ""one"" of my favorites, it IS MY favorite of the original 79. Joanne Linvilles' performance is stunning. She shows us in so many ways glimpses of the Romulan culture we hadn't seen, and in many ways, things we will never see again. The ""score"" here is captivating and judging by some of the looks Spock gives, it sometimes makes you wonder what his thoughts truly were. This is simply the most rounded episode and most informative... now as for ""And The Children Shall Lead..."" the review of this dvd is scored only on The Enterprise Incident, I can't see holding ""And..."" against that superbly crafted episode. ""And..."" is just a poorly conceived romp....",998352000,2,685,4.863247863247863
7943451,3,B00005KHK4,"The ""Enterprise Incident"" has to be one of my favorite episodes because it involves the very rarely seen Romulans.  However, ""And the Children Shall Lead"" is absolutely horrible.  I might even go as far to say that it is the worst episode of the whole series.
This DVD is worth buying for hard core Star Trek fans.  No collection is complete without the ""Enterprise Incident!""",998006400,,376,4.753846153846154
