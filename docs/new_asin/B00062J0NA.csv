2163291,4,B00062J0NA,"I don't think that this brave, artistic film is an anti-American diatribe by any means. Each segment lasts 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame. You could certainly watch the segments from Bosnia-Herzegovina's Danis Tanovic or Burkina Faso's Idrissa Ouedraogo to see a vision of the repercussions of 9-11 done in a manner that expresses bewilderment or sympathy toward the catastrophe's victims. Others, admittedly, take a jaundiced view of the USA's involvement in world affairs, such as British director Ken Loach's segment or Egypt's Youssef Chahine, who perilously examine the tragedy within the grand scope of other historic days that shook the world.

Certainly, pain is pain. No American who grieves a loss of loved one that day (as I did, and do) can feel entirely receptive when someone says to us, ""well, you're hardly the first person or country to have suffered...""  But I do welcome these intelligent, frequently moving views. Best and worst?: Mexico's brilliant Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's (of AMORES PERROS and 21 GRAMS fame) short film practically uses only sounds in place of visuals - yet it is intensely powerful; Israel's Amos Gitai's is just chaotic and loud, not very involving and rather off-putting. Indian filmmaker Mira Nair's story of a mother in New York trying to exonerate her son after he is accused of being a terrorist (based on true events) is also quietly shattering.

It's difficult to think of anyone viewing Nair's film, with her nationalized Indian family, and not feeling somewhat proud to be American.",1136505600,6,1541,5.131474103585657

2163293,2,B00062J0NA,"While I watched this DVD, I was really torn.  On one hand, I want to truly believe that the US is truly a sentinel of freedom.  Yet in ages past our foreign policies have testified otherwise: from Kissinger's wretched approval of the bloody Chilean, Argentine and Brazilian military dictatorships to our strong support of both Saddam Hussein during the Iraq-Iran in the 80s war and Usama Bin Laden against Russia and her folly in Afghanisthan.  What is one to make of our support of the dastardly Mobuto during the 60s?  Himself seamlessly donning the robes of the slavemaster left behind by the inhumane Belgians.  Yet, to point to these cases, and to turn a blind eye to our efforts to be a good force would be grevious.

Where do I start?  The Marshall Plan-that blessed antidote to the humiliating Versailles treaty?  That is an equal case could be made for the US that has done equally well in being a benevolent force.  After all, we were the bulwark against the Japanese and Germans in WW II.  Kennedy's threat forbade the Chinese from invading India in 1962.  The strict enforcement of the no-fly zone during the 90s sowed the seeds for what now appears to be the beginnings of a strong Kurdish democracy.  Furthermore, George W. Bush chastising a petulant Putin over the Russian's abuse of the tenents of democray: free speech etc., appears to usher in light whence the darkness ruled.  Saudia Arabia and Egypt have not been spared for their hypocrisy either.  Bush has called them out.

I take issue with this DVD since it harangues the United States for the most part.  Even if the US is guilty of this sanctioning of barbarity in, say, Latin America, what have these countries done to rehabilitate themselves?  Has there been a truth and reconciliation committee that indicts members of the Chilean or Argentine country that willingly participated in this barbarity?  What of Yasir Arafat?  How did this man justify his hoarding of the millions when thousands of his people existed on the fringes of poverty?  And, yet, there are winds of change.  Witness the Iraqi election and the Lebanese protest against Syria.  Then, again, why does Bush endorse that dictator General Musharif  of Pakisthan?

A good companion to this DVD would be Granta's  vol. 77 Spring issue.  This issue is titled What We Think of America.  This little publication captures the complexity that America engenders in the world over: the good, the bad, the ugly and the beautiful.  Unfortunately, this DVD does too little justice to the United States of America.  This DVD will appeal to the shrill naysayers of the United States of America.  It will equally incite the America-is-good-no-matter-what-battalion to great acts of verbal fury.  Here's a toast that the US dollar will be strong as it once was.",1109980800,4,2791,4.861995753715499
2163294,2,B00062J0NA,"This DVD was just the opposite of what I expexted when I first popped it into my player.  As it turns out, most of the films in this collection put the blame squarely on the US for inciting the WTC attacks.  A few, like the Chilean story, imply that the attack was poetic justice.  Some actually seem to trivialize the loss of life on 9/11. Even the US entry, directed by Sean Penn, has an ambiguous ending that could be interpreted as seeing positives in the attack (flowers begin to blossom in the newfound sunlight created by the collapse of the towers).

On the plus side, all of the films are technically slick.  In particular, I thought the darkly comic Isreali entry was brilliantly staged and photographed.

I'm a liberal. I welcome a diversity of views. But I also value honesty.  This is just anti-U.S. propaganda masquerading under the title of ""September 11.""  If thinly disguised U.S. bashing is what you want, you'll love this.",1108512000,17,941,4.66060606060606
2163295,5,B00062J0NA,"French producer Alain Brigand gathered a collection of eleven film directors from around the world and gave them an assignment: to make a film of eleven minutes and nine seconds duration that symbolized their perception of the events on September 11, 2001. The results in this DVD, while occasionally uneven, are a brilliant response - thought-provoking, shocking, touching, cautionary, and confused. More important, ten of these eleven vignettes (excluding that of Sean Penn) allow us to view 9/11 through a non-American lens, an opportunity we seldom have to see ourselves as others see us.

The best of these eleven shorts are magnificent and heart-rending. Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) tells the story of a woman teacher at an Afghani refugee camp in Iran. First she wanders through the camp, retrieving the young children for school who are busy making mud for bricks to protect themselves from an American atomic bomb. She herds them into a makeshift classroom and asks them if they know about a terrible event that has occurred in the world. Two people fell into a nearby well, and one was killed, the children tell her. Following a marvelous parody of a philosophical discussion about God's plan, the children are coaxed into a moment of silence standing next to their own tower, the smokestack for their brick kiln.

Claude Lelouch (France) directs an intimate story of a deaf woman in New York who is busy writing a break-up letter to her boyfriend that terrible morning. She misses the entire event on television only to find her boyfriend standing at the door, covered in dust and crying. Idrissa Ouedragogo (Burkina Faso) tells the charming story of five boys who spot Osama bin Laden in their remote village and set out to capture him for the $25 million reward. Tragedy for some creates opportunity for others. Mira Nair (India) presents a Middle Eastern mother in a Queens neighborhood who is victimized by anger, discrimination, and sacrifice, ultimately having to deliver a devastating eulogy.

Two of the shorts take controversial but wildly different approaches. Ken Loach (UK) relates 9/11 to another 9/11 in 1973 when the U.S. backed the overthrow of the democratically-elected Allende in favor of Pinochet. The result was a horrific,  U.S.-inspired reign of terror that took more than 30,000 Chilean lives. The narrator writes that Chileans will remember the WTC victims on the first anniversary of their tragic deaths; he hopes Americans might remember the 29th anniversary of so many Chilean deaths. By contrast, the Mexican director Alejandro Inarritu uses a mostly blank screen, broken by flashes of human bodies falling from the burning towers, to transmit a simple question: does God's light guide us or blind us?

Each of the eleven pieces in September 11 are unique in story line and cinematic approach. A few, such as Shohei Imamura's (Japan) and Youssef Chahine (Egypt) fall flat, but they are far outweighed by the others. Some pieces may touch you, and some may anger you, but all will make you stop and think. The events of 9/11 were not just an American event, they were a world event. While we have every right to our own national perspective, we gain from opening our mind and hearts to the rest of the world, sharing our anger as well as our grief.",1108339200,33,3284,4.963636363636364
2163296,2,B00062J0NA,"If you're expecting a hard hitting account of the events of September 11th you'll have to look elsewhere I'm afraid.  This is a compilation of 11 short films from different directors around the world, many of which give only passing reference to 9/11.

  The first shows some Afghan kids and their teacher trying to tell them about 9/11.  The kids, who are war refugees stand in front of a chimney, the nearest reference they have to the twin towers.  The film is an interesting glimpse at these kids, but not that relevant to 9/11.

  The Egyptian one centers on a film director who talks to the ghost of a Marine killed in Lebanon in 1983, and he claims that the terrorists ""know the US is a democracy, therefore the people are responsible for their government's policies"".  A short-sighted and callous view to put it mildly.  The Mexican one showed a black screen for almost the entire film.  It used a soundtrack of sounds from 9/11 and split second glimpses of the burning towers before fading back to black.  Michael Moore referenced this concept in his Faranheit 9/11 film for the attack scene.

  The UK one focuses on a Chilean who narrated the September 11 coup in Chile that Nixon and Kissinger instigated in 1973.  This was a more poignant film than the others, as we saw scenes from that day that seemed to mirror the 2001 event.  Another poignant one was the Bosnian film, which showed scenes of Srebenica where a massacre in 1995 killed 8000 residents.  The surviving women were to have a demonstration of mourning the day of the 9/11 attacks, and we hear the radio broadcasts of news of the attacks, so they demonstrate for both their victims as well as the New York, DC, and PA ones.

  The Burkina-Faso film is kind of comic.  These kids think they see Bin Laden and decide to try to capture him for the 25 million dollar reward.  They almost did what Bush failed to do.

The Israeli one is another black humor take on it, as it centers on an attack in Jerusalem during 9/11 and a hyperactive reporter and police.  The reporter tells us all the other things that happened on different years of 9/11 in the midst of a chaotic post-attack street scene.

  Many of the films have a similar theme of silence, TV or radio broadcasts, and unfortunately an exploration of the director's ""artistic vision"" that has nothing to do with 9/11.  And the theme music runs through all films.  One film about silence is the French one about a deaf woman living right next to the WTC and she doesn't hear it, so doesn't know what's happening.  There's a similar theme to the most disappointing film:  Sean Penn's direction of Ernest Borgnine as this old senile guy living next to the WTC and he doesn't know what's going on either.

  The most obscure film of all is Japan's entry:  during WWII an Imperial soldier thinks he's a snake.  Has no 9/11 reference whatsoever, except when they tagged on at the end the phrase, ""there is no Holy War"".

  Overall a big disappointment if you're looking for something more than film experiments.",1103673600,4,3037,4.5914179104477615
2163297,5,B00062J0NA,"This film deals with the THEME of what occurred in the US on September 11. It allows the viewers to understand the viewpoints of 11 men chosen from across the world who used, as a theme, September 11 as the basis of a short film. As I understand, each director was given significant leverage in creating a short film, the only guideline being a financial budget and that the film must be inspired by the events of September 11. The directors did not discuss their own projects with each other, thus this film is not about one thing - it is NOT directly about Americas September 11. This being said, this film is not a critique, a tribute to, or even about the actual events of September 11, and should be viewed with this is mind. Many Americans see this film and, assuming it is about Americans September 11, are very upset and disappointed. This is a very selfish view, for Americans are not alone in their suffering. It is more about how people of different cultures and backgrounds deal with the highly impactive events occurring in our world. I feel this movie is a tremendous contribution to our society because it allows people to understand how people in other societies comprehend and deal with trauma. Whether or not we agree with these directors should not be what we get out of this film; what we should walk away with is the knowledge that while our world is diverse, we are all similar because at some time in our lives we will deal with our own ""September 11,"" be it in New York City or an anonymous town in Ghana. This film is a tremendous opportunity to learn about the world.",1103328000,14,1593,4.47766323024055
2163298,5,B00062J0NA,"This is an extraordinary compilation of 11 short films by directors from as far as Japan and as close as the U.S. All the films are aware of the still unbearable horror of the events of 9/11, but each interprets them differently. Some are direct, dramatic vignettes. Others, like Shohei Imamura's, are almost impenetrable allegories. Sean Penn's tale, featuring Ernest Borgnine, is as moving as it is mysterious. The British director, Ken Loach, provides a political parallel that will enrage some and amaze others. This is a film that will stay with you and offer perspectives you might not have thought of.

8037657,2,B00062J0NA,"Brilliant concept, unevenly executed.

Don't want to ruin the film for you by giving away each segment's plot. Will just summarize my reaction to it, and to offer, if you're pressed for time, which of the films I liked.

The first two of the eleven videos were wonderful, each in its own way, those by the Iranian and French directors. Perhaps they set the bar too high, as none of the remaining nine films matched their genius.

Some films were opportunities to rail against America or Israel, as by the Egyptian and British directors, with even Mira Nair, one of my favorite directors, diluting her film's message with a gratuitous slam against Israel.

The Burkina Faso film was tragicomic; sounds impossible but you have to see (and enjoy) it to understand.

The Japanese film never mentioned 9/11 but it indirectly referred to the horrors of war by mentioning Hiroshima. I found this film fascinating.

Bosnia's effort took me back to when I served there. During 9/11, in fact. But 9/11 was hardly mentioned in this video, which seemed to be telling us that as bad as 9/11 was, it didn't compare with Sarajevo, Srebrenica, etc.

The Mexican director tried something radical: to capture us with audio, and much of that unrecognizable. His eleven minutes had almost nothing on the screen except falling bodies from the towers. I tried to lose myself in his ""vision"" but couldn't, mostly annoyed at watching a black screen. You might be greatly affected, though, if it works for you.

Israel's video was another radical attempt, a single, continuous, also tragicomic, 11-minute shot of a terrorist bombing in a Jerusalem street...on 9/11. What I took from it is that terrible events around the world that day paled in significance to what was happening in America.

The American director gave us a sappy, minimizing of 9/11, as we watch an old man (the great Ernest Borgnine), lost in dementia or a huge romantic, and how 9/11 affected his lonely life. (Barely). Or maybe I failed to grasp Penn's message.

Is this disc worth buying? No. Worth watching? Yes. If short on time, or if don't want to feel your intelligence or patriotism insulted, view only numbers 1, 2, 5, 8, and 11. One and Two are for me unforgettable.

One last thought: not one of the eleven directors expressed any anger at the perpetrators of 9/11. And that's why my overall rating is two stars, not three or four. Either out of anti-American animus or excessive political correctness -- or even a valid fear of being another Salman Rushdie or Theo van Gogh -- none of the directors took on the perverted ideology that resulted in 9/11. Shame on them.",1486944000,,2624,4.770419426048565
8037658,1,B00062J0NA,None of the horror and terror of 9/11 is here.  You would never think most of the compilation was about 9/11.  Very antiseptic.  The filmaker could afford to be dispassionate.  It didn't happen in his country.,1338422400,2,209,4.722222222222222

This is one of the best effort you will see in any Film. Films like this are rarely made and appreciated. This film tries to touch every possible core of WTC. Here are some of the most important stories from the film that makes this film so unique.

There is the story from Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) where somewhere in Iran people are preparing for the attacks from America. There a teacher is trying to educate her students by informing them about Innocent People being killed in WTC massacare. Then comes a story from Youssef Chahine (Egypt) where a Film Maker comes across face-to-face conversation with a Dead Soldier in the WTC attack and a Dead Hard Core Terrorist who was involved in WTC attack. Then we see a story from Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso) where a group of Five Innocent childrens sees Osama Bin Laden and plans to kidnap him and win the reward money from America. Then we see the story from Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico) where you see a Black Screen and slowly you see the real footage of WTC buildings coming down. And the people who are stuck in the building are jumping out of it to save thier lives. The other most important story is from Mira Nair (India) where a mother is struggling to get respect for her Dead Son whose name is falsely trapped in WTC massacare!

After September 11 attack, Our heart beat automatically starts pumping if we hear two names anywhere in the world.. First is World Trade Centre and the second is Osama! This film totally changes our perception and makes a strong point by claiming something more to it.

I will definately recommend this movie to everyone who loves to have such kinds of Home DVD Collection. Definately worth every penny you spend.

Surprisingly, Penn's entry from the US is the least of all these works, and also the least connected to the tragedy of September 11th.  All the rest explore the events of the day from a variety of perspectives, including a surprisingly sympathetic view from Iran and a righteous polemic from Egypt.  Some of the stories focus on the personal, such as Lelouch's sad and fascinating vingette about a deaf woman and her hearing lover.  Others, such as Loach's history lesson on South American politics and the repercussions of American foreign policy, attempt to relate on a more global level.  Irritu avoids his usual multiple storylines to simply juxtapose horrific images from the day with total silence and blackness, as if to say that it is impossible to convey the enormity and tragedy of it all.

Many of these directors were ""undiscovered"" in the US when this film was made.  Several of them have either won or been nominated for Academy Awards in years since, and all of them turn in first rate work here(except Penn, but I've never cared for his directing anyway, so perhaps it is of a piece with his other work).

When I watched this for the first time recently, in spring 2007, I was struck with a profound sadness and anger.  This film was released in September 2002, one year after the attacks.  In the 5 years since, every shred of sympathy, compassion and understanding that is expressed in this film was squandered on a ill conceived war in Iraq.  Even the most confrontational of these films, Chahine's scathing depiction of an argument between a dead US Marine and an Egyptian filmmaker, expresses compassion for our tragedy.  Chahine suggests that the US look at our treatment of the Middle East and take this as a lesson, something to be mourned but also learned from.  Even though the filmmaker character is angry with the US for its unilateral viewpoint, he still breaks down with emotion when confronted with the enormity of September 11th.  Even though he feels the US needed a wake-up call, he cannot deny that the human cost is too high.

It would be interesting to get these filmmakers together again and make a 27'03""03, on the theme of the Iraq War.",1180224000,2,4365,7.140449438202247
8037664,4,B00062J0NA,"""September 11"" is not one film but rather 11 short ones, each directed by a different filmmaker. It attempts to give a variety of perspectives on how people around the globe received the news that the United States had been attacked. Featuring locales as diverse as Israel, Africa, and Japan, as well as the U.S., the film is predictably uneven, given the number of artistic hands at work. Youssef Chanine's Egyptian segment is unfocused and strident, while Shohei Imamura's Japanese piece and Sean Penn's American entry are elusive, at best. Ken Loach's UK piece, on the other hand, works quite well, as a displaced Chilean discusses his country's memories of a different 9/11, and Danis Tanovic's perspective from Bosnia-Herzegovina is also moving. Claude Lelouch's French contribution may be the high point, as it shows a deaf woman who spends all of 9/11 crafting a goodbye note to her lover, who has gone off to his job as a tour guide at the World Trade Center. For obvious reasons, she hears nothing of what has happened until he walks back in the door.

At the very least, the film succeeds in opening the mind to sensory and intellectual responses other than our own to these tragic events. History will have to be the judge of whether ""September 11"" is great art, just as history will be the judge of how the events of September 11, 2001 changed this country and the world.
