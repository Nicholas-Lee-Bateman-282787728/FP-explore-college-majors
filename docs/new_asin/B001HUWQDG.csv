8311026,2,B001HUWQDG,I'm a big fan of Malevolent..never seen them live..wanted to check them out on dvd..this is a disappointment. Whoever filmed this bootleg is a moron..it's shot from like 20 feet away. The only positive to this is that Brett Hoffman pulls off a great job singing all the classics..the second dvd with Kyle Symons is inaudible and poorly filmed. I recommend this for die hard fans only. For a band that has been around 20 years..this is inexcusable for a first dvd release. The behind the scenes footage doesn't even include the band and the photo gallery is blurry and pointless. I hope they produce a professional one soon.,1227398400,4,623,4.724770642201835
