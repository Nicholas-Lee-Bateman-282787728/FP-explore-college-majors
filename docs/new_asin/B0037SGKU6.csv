8390715,5,B0037SGKU6,"A wonderful video on making homemade dairy products so simple a child can do it! I love these women. They are beautiful, sweet and very informative. Everything is pretty much covered from the explanation to the actual making of the product. Butter, Buttermilk, Cream Cheese, Yogurt, Ice cream and more are very simply made. Highly recommended!",1391126400,3,343,5.142857142857143
8390716,5,B0037SGKU6,Great starter dvd.  I have alread used the info from this dvd to make butter and buttermilk.  I will try yogurt next.,1381363200,2,117,4.2727272727272725
8390717,5,B0037SGKU6,"Very basic instructions, but clearly presented and fun to watch. You will need to go further if you want to make more involved cheeses but this will get you started.",1366588800,2,165,4.533333333333333
8390718,5,B0037SGKU6,I really enjoy watching their videos. I have the breadmaking and herb video. The ice cream looked great but too much for one person. Next I will try the sewing video. I want to eventually own all their dvds.,1350518400,2,207,4.333333333333333
