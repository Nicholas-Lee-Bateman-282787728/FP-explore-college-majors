I am not sure if this set will include the final episode of the Pheonix storyline, but that whole plot benefitted greatly by the enormous acting talents of one ten year old actor named David Hennesy. That finale where he runs from the burning cottage and into Victoria's arms, sobbing and screaming---and you realize it was videotaped LIVE and only ONCE!  The actors did not have a chance at retakes. And there were several times througout the run of the show when one of the adults messed up (or he messed up) and his quickness on his feet saved the day. Incredible little actor!
I would like it if the box sets had more than 4 discs.  I think they should double the discs and episodes and add maybe $10 to the price. Or maybe use both sides of the discs.

3089722,5,B0012IWNSQ,"After jumping out of the frying pan and directly into the occult fire, Dark Shadows creator Dan Curtis knew there could be no turning back. He knew his decision to accept his children's advice to ""go supernatural"" would either save or kill the first-ever gothic soap opera, and it did.

With the ratings at an all-time low, he unleashed his first ghosts (episodes included in Dark Shadows: the Beginning Set 3) then kept up the pressure cooker in the episodes included in this boxed set. Amazed, he watched as the ratings steadily and miraculously rose from the dead (much like the reluctant 175-year-old vampire Barnabas Collins would do about six months later.)

In this boxed set, the Collins family is turned upside down by recent events: the murder of Collins Plant Manager Bill Malloy, the unexpected return of Roger Collins' wife, Laura Murdock Collins, and the abduction of Collinwood Governess Victoria Winters.

Roger (Louis Edmonds) had told his young son David (David Henesy), that his mother was dead, but she had actually suffered a mental breakdown and was confined in sanitarium. Since being released, she apparently had been living in Phoenix, Ariz., unbeknownst to the Collins family.

Without warning, Laura (Diana Millay) returns to Collinwood late one night and demands full custody of her son. Roger and his sister, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Joan Bennett) refuse to allow her to see David, who is fast asleep and turn her away. Even so, that night David mysteriously dreams of his mother coming out of powerful flames to kill him.

Because of his dream, David doesn't want to see his mother, but eventually agrees. Sitting together in front of the fireplace in the Drawing Room of Collinwood, Laura tells him the famous legend of the Phoenix, a great bird who remains immortal, but only because it dies by fire and is reborn the same way every 100 years.

In Collinsport, Artist Sam Evans (David Ford) inexplicably feels driven, compelled to paint a portrait of Laura - flames encircling her image.

Meanwhile, Victoria (Alexandra Moltke) is kidnapped but finds comfort in an unlikely source: the ghost of Josette Collins. Later, Elizabeth tells Vicki that her great aunt had once told her that in her youth she had seen the ghost of Josette who at that time provided guidance to save a fishing crew feared lost at sea.

Several of these episodes span the Christmas and New Year season, so viewers are treated to a holiday greeting as the credits roll.

Millay and Curtis are interviewed in bonus material.

These early black and white episodes occurred prior to the arrival of the vampire, played by the gifted Jonathan Frid. Once Frid joined the cast, the show skyrocketed to iconic status. Many fans who began watching once Barnabas became a fixture on the show, never saw these early episodes, so it's wonderful to have them finally available on DVD, to see how it all began!",1200096000,28,2903,4.918200408997955

3089724,5,B0012IWNSQ,I'm a huge Dark Shadows fan and I watch it form the very beginning.  Most people know about Dark Shadows after Barnabas Collins.  But Dark Shadows dealt with the super natural long before Barnabas made his appearance.  This collection deals with David's mother coming back to claim parental rights over David and take him away.  The only problem is the lady who looks and acts like Laura is not really David's mother but a Phoenix who has killed David's mother in fire and come to Collingswood to bring David into the fire.,1451260800,,523,4.6521739130434785

I've gone back and re-watched these and they're much better the 2nd time around. This review will contain spoilers. Vicky has been taken hostage by Matthew Morgan and receives help from Roger and Burke. Burke Devlin is one of my favorite characters because he's so charming, yet conniving. Pretty soon, Laura Collins returns to Collinsport to bring trouble for the Collins family. (Laura is the wife of Roger and mother to David) Laura wants to take David away, but Liz refuses. Meanwhile, Sam Evans begins drawing a grotesque painting of Laura surrounded by fire, but he has no reason why he's painting it.

3089746,5,B0012IWNSQ,"I had seen all the Dark Shadows episodes after Barnabus came on the show; however, I had not seen ""The Beginning Collection"" until now.  The first couple of Collections are a little slow, but entertaining, especially if you are a Fan. By the time Laura comes on the show, it really starts getting good.  Collection 4 is vintage Dark Shadows and is just as good as the stories after Barnabus.  Collection 4 is a must for all Dark Shadows fans.",1352160000,5,442,4.5
3089747,4,B0012IWNSQ,"Around a year ago, while killing some time in a Barnes & Noble video department, I stumbled across boxed DVD sets of ""Dark Shadows,"" including the ""Beginning"" episodes, of which I was unaware of. Not long after that, I heard the news about the Tim Burton-Johnny Depp ""Dark Shadows"" movie project (for which we all had such high hopes ... sigh...) and ""Dark Shadow"" videos began popping up wherever I turned. I know signs when I see them, and  decided to renew an old childhood acquaintance.

My first impulse was to pick up with the Jonathan Frid-Barnabas Collins episodes, but the ""Beginning"" sets I had seen in the bookstore were stuck in my mind. Being a completist at heart, I decided to go ahead and start at the very beginning. I can't say I was disappointed, the packaging (and on-line reviews and information about the series) made clear the early episodes were different in subject matter and tone than the shows produced after Barnabas's arrival. And the shows were enjoyable and addictive in nature. But it is with ""Dark Shadows The Beginning Collection 4""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-The-Beginning-Collection-4/dp/B0012IWNSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows: The Beginning Collection 4</a>&nbsp;that ""Dark Shadows"" for me became the show we all love so much. It is in Volume Four that the show, creatively, makes a huge leap in its evolution, struggling onto dry land, and developing lungs instead of gills.

For one thing, the story-lines that drove the show in the first 3 volumes -- Burke Devlin's schemes to ruin the Collins family, Roger Collins's mysterious car crash, Bill Mulroy's death, Carolyn's misadventures in dating -- are either resolved  or pushed into the background.  It wasn't that these plot-lines were awful, just that with very minor changes they would not have been out of place on any soap opera, then or now. It is in the episodes contained in  Volume 4 that ""Dark Shadows"" truly begins  to stake out its original place in the pop culture firmament, separating itself from the mundane pack of daytime dramas and becoming a show never quite seen before on network TV (or, for that matter, ever really seen since).  The pace and intensity picks up as well, if the earlier episodes at time moved at a glacier pace, with much repetition, (a bane of soap operas since the genre was first created) in Volume 4 things move at a faster speed, as one writer once put it, the show went from being a typical soap, building up to a climax on Friday, to making every day Friday.

Key sequences in this volume include Victoria Winters being abducted by creepy caretaker Matthew Morgan (all the actors are fine, but Thayer David gives a stand-out performance) and imprisoned in the old mansion where -- well, see for yourself, but Morgan's downfall is where the supernatural elements long hinted at finally come fully out of the closet, never to go back in; and the arrival of Laura Collins, Roger's ex-wife and David's mother, which starts the famous ""phoenix"" sequence. As the intensity picks up and the writing improves, so do the performances, there's less sleep-walking through episodes, less sense that the actors are phoning their performance in. Yes, there are times when actors blow a line or miss a cue and technical glitches pop up -- but that lack of slickness is one of those things about ""Dark Shadows""  that makes the show so endearing.

As with the other volumes, Volume 4 includes a collectible photo card of a character (Elizabeth Collins Stoddard in this case), an episode guide with very brief summaries of each broadcast, and bonus interviews with cast and crew members. I usually skip these things, but I do enjoy the interviews in the ""Dark Shadows"" DVDS, Volume 4 includes an interview with Diana Millay, in which her take on Laura Collins comes as a little -- well, spooky.

The quality of the tapes, given conditions under which they were made, is pretty remarkable (just the fact the tapes survived at all, given the fact that in the 1960s TV networks routinely taped over shows as a way to save money, is pretty miraculous).  Some people may find the special effects or production values crude by today's standards, but then those people probably would not be interested in viewing a cult favorite from the 1960s to begin with.  And all the episodes are in black and white, which actually adds to the gothic atmosphere the creators were trying to attain.

Recommended for: ""Dark Shadows"" completists, fans of the Barnabas Collins episodes who are curious about the show's first year, newcomers to ""Dark Shadows"" who may want to start at the ""Beginning"" but would prefer to begin on a supernatural  note.",1344124800,3,4720,4.986005089058525
3089748,5,B0012IWNSQ,"Many believe that it was Jonathan Frid who made the ratings spike on ""Dark Shadows"" and saved it from cancllation as many soap opera books wrongly state. However, it was the Laura Collin's story that made the Nielsen numbers go into the ratings sky. Six months into the show's run ABC informed creator and executive producer Dan Curtis they were cancelling ""Dark Shadows"" and that he had only 13 weeks to finish up the storylines.

 In order to save his family's legacy he fired the former writers and brought on Malcolm Marmorstein and Ron Sproat (both former serial writers) and told them to come up with something that was never done on daytime TV before and to make the story as gothic as possible. The result was the resurrecting of Roger Collin's wife who was said to have died in the early shows. In the ""new"" story Laura was in an insane asylum. She eventually moved to Phoenix and would arrive in Collinsport to see her son David. Unknown to everyone Laura was really a Phoenix, a supernatural creature who dies every 100 years and is reborn. Laura wanted to kill her son with her in a fire so they could live together forever. Almost from the time Laura arrived the ratings shyrocketed and the show would be renewed for another 13 weeks.

 What made this story so popular with viewers was Diana Millay's poignant and interesting portrayal of Laura. At times she could be soft-spoken then become brash and evil, but viewers couldn't get enough of her. Finally the writers had to kill the character off as Diana was pregnant in real life and she only signed on for the 13 week story arc. Then the writers, knowing the show was saved, had to come up with another story, even more interesting than the Laura Collins one. Malcolm Marmorstein would create the vampire Barnabas and the rest as they say is history.

 Enjoy these episodes as they are simply well-written, well-acted and involving and you will not stop watching at one episode.",1339891200,3,1945,4.65597667638484

Many fans who began watching once Barnabas became a fixture on the show, never saw these early episodes, so it's wonderful to have them finally available on DVD, to see how it all began!",1200096000,28,2903,4.918200408997955

3324221,5,B0012IWNSQ,I'm a huge Dark Shadows fan and I watch it form the very beginning.  Most people know about Dark Shadows after Barnabas Collins.  But Dark Shadows dealt with the super natural long before Barnabas made his appearance.  This collection deals with David's mother coming back to claim parental rights over David and take him away.  The only problem is the lady who looks and acts like Laura is not really David's mother but a Phoenix who has killed David's mother in fire and come to Collingswood to bring David into the fire.,1451260800,,523,4.6521739130434785

3324231,5,B0012IWNSQ,"These beginning episodes were great and addicting. Filled with gothic imagery and suspense. It's a shame that people skip these episodes to get to Barnabas. I've gone back and re-watched these and they're much better the 2nd time around. This review will contain spoilers. Vicky has been taken hostage by Matthew Morgan and receives help from Roger and Burke. Burke Devlin is one of my favorite characters because he's so charming, yet conniving. Pretty soon, Laura Collins returns to Collinsport to bring trouble for the Collins family. (Laura is the wife of Roger and mother to David) Laura wants to take David away, but Liz refuses. Meanwhile, Sam Evans begins drawing a grotesque painting of Laura surrounded by fire, but he has no reason why he's painting it. If you love this gothic soap, I highly recommend DARK SHADOWS: THE BEGINNING COLLECTION 4!!!",1405468800,2,857,5.0

Of course, it's tests our patience a lot less when we can just move on to the next episode right away!

The supernatural shows up in soaps from time to time, and by about this time it was clear: The supernatural will be a central component here!  If you never saw the pre-Barnabas episodes, they are a very interesting watch....",1365379200,2,546,4.608247422680412

3324243,5,B0012IWNSQ,"I had seen all the Dark Shadows episodes after Barnabus came on the show; however, I had not seen ""The Beginning Collection"" until now.  The first couple of Collections are a little slow, but entertaining, especially if you are a Fan. By the time Laura comes on the show, it really starts getting good.  Collection 4 is vintage Dark Shadows and is just as good as the stories after Barnabus.  Collection 4 is a must for all Dark Shadows fans.",1352160000,5,442,4.5
3324244,4,B0012IWNSQ,"Around a year ago, while killing some time in a Barnes & Noble video department, I stumbled across boxed DVD sets of ""Dark Shadows,"" including the ""Beginning"" episodes, of which I was unaware of. Not long after that, I heard the news about the Tim Burton-Johnny Depp ""Dark Shadows"" movie project (for which we all had such high hopes ... sigh...) and ""Dark Shadow"" videos began popping up wherever I turned. I know signs when I see them, and  decided to renew an old childhood acquaintance.

My first impulse was to pick up with the Jonathan Frid-Barnabas Collins episodes, but the ""Beginning"" sets I had seen in the bookstore were stuck in my mind. Being a completist at heart, I decided to go ahead and start at the very beginning. I can't say I was disappointed, the packaging (and on-line reviews and information about the series) made clear the early episodes were different in subject matter and tone than the shows produced after Barnabas's arrival. And the shows were enjoyable and addictive in nature. But it is with ""Dark Shadows The Beginning Collection 4""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows-The-Beginning-Collection-4/dp/B0012IWNSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows: The Beginning Collection 4</a>&nbsp;that ""Dark Shadows"" for me became the show we all love so much. It is in Volume Four that the show, creatively, makes a huge leap in its evolution, struggling onto dry land, and developing lungs instead of gills.

For one thing, the story-lines that drove the show in the first 3 volumes -- Burke Devlin's schemes to ruin the Collins family, Roger Collins's mysterious car crash, Bill Mulroy's death, Carolyn's misadventures in dating -- are either resolved  or pushed into the background.  It wasn't that these plot-lines were awful, just that with very minor changes they would not have been out of place on any soap opera, then or now. It is in the episodes contained in  Volume 4 that ""Dark Shadows"" truly begins  to stake out its original place in the pop culture firmament, separating itself from the mundane pack of daytime dramas and becoming a show never quite seen before on network TV (or, for that matter, ever really seen since).  The pace and intensity picks up as well, if the earlier episodes at time moved at a glacier pace, with much repetition, (a bane of soap operas since the genre was first created) in Volume 4 things move at a faster speed, as one writer once put it, the show went from being a typical soap, building up to a climax on Friday, to making every day Friday.

Key sequences in this volume include Victoria Winters being abducted by creepy caretaker Matthew Morgan (all the actors are fine, but Thayer David gives a stand-out performance) and imprisoned in the old mansion where -- well, see for yourself, but Morgan's downfall is where the supernatural elements long hinted at finally come fully out of the closet, never to go back in; and the arrival of Laura Collins, Roger's ex-wife and David's mother, which starts the famous ""phoenix"" sequence. As the intensity picks up and the writing improves, so do the performances, there's less sleep-walking through episodes, less sense that the actors are phoning their performance in. Yes, there are times when actors blow a line or miss a cue and technical glitches pop up -- but that lack of slickness is one of those things about ""Dark Shadows""  that makes the show so endearing.

As with the other volumes, Volume 4 includes a collectible photo card of a character (Elizabeth Collins Stoddard in this case), an episode guide with very brief summaries of each broadcast, and bonus interviews with cast and crew members. I usually skip these things, but I do enjoy the interviews in the ""Dark Shadows"" DVDS, Volume 4 includes an interview with Diana Millay, in which her take on Laura Collins comes as a little -- well, spooky.

The quality of the tapes, given conditions under which they were made, is pretty remarkable (just the fact the tapes survived at all, given the fact that in the 1960s TV networks routinely taped over shows as a way to save money, is pretty miraculous).  Some people may find the special effects or production values crude by today's standards, but then those people probably would not be interested in viewing a cult favorite from the 1960s to begin with.  And all the episodes are in black and white, which actually adds to the gothic atmosphere the creators were trying to attain.

Recommended for: ""Dark Shadows"" completists, fans of the Barnabas Collins episodes who are curious about the show's first year, newcomers to ""Dark Shadows"" who may want to start at the ""Beginning"" but would prefer to begin on a supernatural  note.",1344124800,3,4720,4.986005089058525
3324245,5,B0012IWNSQ,"Many believe that it was Jonathan Frid who made the ratings spike on ""Dark Shadows"" and saved it from cancllation as many soap opera books wrongly state. However, it was the Laura Collin's story that made the Nielsen numbers go into the ratings sky. Six months into the show's run ABC informed creator and executive producer Dan Curtis they were cancelling ""Dark Shadows"" and that he had only 13 weeks to finish up the storylines.

 In order to save his family's legacy he fired the former writers and brought on Malcolm Marmorstein and Ron Sproat (both former serial writers) and told them to come up with something that was never done on daytime TV before and to make the story as gothic as possible. The result was the resurrecting of Roger Collin's wife who was said to have died in the early shows. In the ""new"" story Laura was in an insane asylum. She eventually moved to Phoenix and would arrive in Collinsport to see her son David. Unknown to everyone Laura was really a Phoenix, a supernatural creature who dies every 100 years and is reborn. Laura wanted to kill her son with her in a fire so they could live together forever. Almost from the time Laura arrived the ratings shyrocketed and the show would be renewed for another 13 weeks.

 What made this story so popular with viewers was Diana Millay's poignant and interesting portrayal of Laura. At times she could be soft-spoken then become brash and evil, but viewers couldn't get enough of her. Finally the writers had to kill the character off as Diana was pregnant in real life and she only signed on for the 13 week story arc. Then the writers, knowing the show was saved, had to come up with another story, even more interesting than the Laura Collins one. Malcolm Marmorstein would create the vampire Barnabas and the rest as they say is history.

 Enjoy these episodes as they are simply well-written, well-acted and involving and you will not stop watching at one episode.",1339891200,3,1945,4.65597667638484
