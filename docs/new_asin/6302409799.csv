7826096,5,6302409799,"I watched this series religiously every Saturday morning when I was little. The baby cracked me up the most, though the rest of the family too has its very funny moments. I recommend this to anyone, young and old, who is looking for a cute, funny, and appropriate show to watch.",1136592000,2,278,4.470588235294118
7826097,5,6302409799,"Considering all the myriad BAD business decisions they've been making lately (they *really* passed on distributing Moore's new film?  WHEW, they're gonna regret that!) I guess we shouldn't be surprised that Eisner's Disney is hiding this great series in a sealed vault, as if it were a 20-year-old black-market shell of Sarin gas.

It just ain't fair.  Why does one of the most poorly-managed corporations of the 90s/00s get to own such GREAT stuff?!?

As I said on another review . . . I think they're missing out on tapping the SIMPSONS/SOUTH PARK fan base.  Idiocy!",1085788800,3,568,4.875
7826098,5,6302409799,"I want all these episodes on DVD. Come on!!
This is ""classic"" Disney fare, you know, it's made for kids but it's got humor that only adults will ""get"".  I have four or five tapes with three episodes each.  Great stuff.  I want ALL episodes on DVD.",1044489600,4,247,4.212765957446808
