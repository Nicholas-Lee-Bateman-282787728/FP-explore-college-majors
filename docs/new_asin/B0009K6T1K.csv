8062254,5,B0009K6T1K,The previous reviewer panned this video because it was mainly discussion.  I rented the video from the library and found the discussion to be very instructional - much better than trying to learn tips from watching a bowler.  Listen to what these experts have to say?  I was so impressed that I am going to purchase a copy.,1384128000,,323,4.5344827586206895

If you want to listen to two people talking in front of a camera for an hour, then you will like this.
My recomendation is don't bother.",1262908800,6,218,4.341463414634147
