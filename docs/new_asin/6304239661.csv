824756,4,6304239661,"My friend first saw this film back in '98 when Sci-Fi channel aired it on their ""Saturday Anime"" programing block; for two weeks he could not stop yammering on about it. Four years later he picked up this DVD and called me over to watch it. I had seen some of the TV series before, but Movie 2 amazed me. It captures all the slapstick elements of the show, but they flow with in the context of a deep plot where the same day repeats over and over, much like the film Groundhog Day. As clues begin to surface that might shed some light on the strange occurances, people begin to disappear.

This film is probably the most popular title in the UY universe and for good reason. With the exception of a few characters, a viewer can jump in totally ignorant to the prior portions of the series. Also, it has a nice balance to the light hearted antics of the TV show, but combines that beautifully with the deeper existentialist trappings of the plot. The ending is satisfying, although the home stretch does drag some. All in all its a great buy for some one who has had some experience with anime, but its not a good starting point for the uninitiated.

This DVD is the only title not put out by Animiego, but it was translated for CPM by the same team, so the continuity and translation is exicelent. This also makes it the only one that is dubbed. its only in fullscreen which might bother some people.",1172966400,5,1400,4.360153256704981
824757,4,6304239661,"When I watched this movie in 1984.  I stayed in the cinema for more than ten hours straight to watch the same movie three or four times that day.  (In Japan, once you paid admission you could stay in the cinema until you were physically out of the cinema.)  21.5 years and a few movies later, I have never seen any movie that gives me more goosedumps that this movie.  And many animation fans over 30 years old and a few greatest animation creators in Japan agree with me, including original Gundams' creator.

Urusei Yatsura was popular even when it was on the comics, so when it was recreated as TV series in the early 80s, it had got experienced voice actors (dubbers?).  And without their unique voices, expressions, dialogs, and strange dialects you are experiencing this movie only by 50%.  I watched the english version and I was impressed the work of translation, however unless you know the language, it's difficult to enjoy every aspect of it.",1133654400,7,953,4.636904761904762
824758,5,6304239661,"It's hard to describe the effect that first seeing this movie had on me the first time I saw it five years ago, but it's something that's sucks with me at the very least.

This was the first bit of UY I ever saw, and I quickly become addicted to the series because of it. The animation is wonderful, the characters are all nifty, and the mysteries that abound in the story are all intriguing. I sometimes find mindself just randomly whistling the music from this movie as it's so...so simply wonderful.",1129680000,2,502,4.456521739130435
824759,5,6304239661,"I'm not a huge anime fan, but there was some great imagery here. Scenes linger in your mind, touching on some great memory you know you had but can't remember.  You will begin to care abou the characters, and yearn to be part of their ""perfect world.""  Dealing with how to cope with a natural (or unnatural, in this case) calamity is what makes this a survivalist's story: the ability to live and have fun doing it.  Whoever made this needs to be acredited with making a modern masterpiece, because the experiance of watching Beautiful Dreamer is inspiring and intense. If you close your eyes you can almost see the broken ruin of Tomobiki high. I could see myself under the big sun above Tomobiki, listening to funky 80's japanese pop while taking in a beefbowl with a smile on my face, waving to Lum and Ataru as they tear up the lake in their Kawasakis.",1112832000,5,856,4.4743589743589745
824760,4,6304239661,"This is an awesome movie. Five stars, all the way. Unfortunately, this DVD must have been taken from one of the worst film elements in existence. Three stars, at best.

When this disc was first announced, I assumed that CPM would license the newly-restored, anamorphic widescreen video released on the Japanese R2 DVD. What CPM chose to do was clean up the cropped-to-fullscreen video from the original R1 DVD and release that for this edition. Proof? Check out the 2:15 position, close to the edge of the screen. That red dot that appears repeatedly throughout the movie was on the first release, too. Also note the hard subtitles for signs are same font/color as the older disc, while the soft subs have been improved for better visibility.

Just to rub salt into an open wound, the original Japanese trailer on this disc *is* widescreen. Aarrghh!

On the plus side, the ending is complete now, including the Japanese credits and the full version of ""Ai wa boomerang."" Sweet! I think the subtitle translation was updated, too.

I was hoping for a new dub, but that was never going to happen. Not for a twenty year old anime movie with one U.S. release already. Even if the existing dub sucks. Even if the movie is the GREATEST film ever.

Overall, if you have the first release, don't bother with this one unless you're obsessive and/or a rabid Urusei Yatsura otaku. If you don't have the original, buy it NOW. You'll enjoy it.",1087171200,19,1429,4.7
824761,4,6304239661,"""Beautiful Dreamer"" is the second Urusei Yatsura movie, and universally accepted as the best UY movie of them all. While not my favorite UY movie (that honor goes to ""The Final Chapter""), I still throughoutly enjoyed ""Beautiful Dreamer"", and am glad that it's a part of my collection.

Comedy wise, this movie is full of the wacky antics we've come to expect from UY. Fans of Mendou will probably enjoy this movie a lot, since he gets plenty of screen time. Two scenes of his that especially stand out are: 1) in his car with Shinobu where he giggles like a madman while trying to find an exit; 2) where he suddenly prances around in joy, laughing and giggling ""Oh, you really don't know??!"" at Ataru. Both scenes are hilarious because they are things that were unexpected yet ALSO expected from an insanely wacky series like UY.

Mendou aside, there are also many characters that get to showcase their unique personalities. Unlike the first movie, ""Beautiful Dreamer"" focuses on the humans rather than the aliens this time around. In fact, other than Lum and Ten (which are main characters, anyway) + a few other really small cameos, you don't see any other aliens in the movie. The spotlight is mostly put on Lum, Sakura, Mendou, Megane & Fan club, and even the usually neglected Onsen-Mark. Ataru Morobishi, the main character himself, gets a piece of the action during the last third of the movie. My only gripe is that some of the other funnier supporting characters don't get much slice of the pie -- Ryuunosuke gets a few lines, but doesn't contribute anything and disappears early on; her father, the ways funny Mr. Fujinami, gets about two or three lines at most, and isn't seen again. Worse of all, Cherry, a character that basically screams to be put in the plot, goes completely AWOL for most of the film and is only seen in about 30 seconds combined (which really sucks to me, because I'm a big fan of the deranged monk).

Moving on: the english dubbing is quite good. While there'll probably never be another person who can play Ataru as well as his original seiyuu, the english VA here comes very close. Vinnie Penna captures Ataru's sleaziness perfectly, and even adds another dimension to the character in some scenes. His Mendou is also great (especially at the comedy scenes mentioned above), although I personally would've given the character a slightly deeper voice. Marnie Head plays a PERFECT Sakura. I've always found the original seiyuu's voice to be a bit.. old, and thus fairly unfitting for a character that's supposed to be jaw-droppingly beautiful and in her 20's. Marnie's voice is younger yet maintains the maturity and sophistication that we expect from Nurse Sakura. Honorable mentions are Megane, Mr. and Mrs. Moroboshi, and Mujaki.

Unfortunately, the dub has its flaws, mainly: 1) Lum's voice does not have the spunk that the Japanese seiyuu had; 2) Shinobu sounds like she's supposed to be in college; 3) Cherry's voice is too high (I personally WOULD give him a high voice, but not THAT high..); and 4) Ten just sounds weird.

The music for the film is excellent. The score sets the mood for a lot of the scenes -- you have the bizarre music for the wacky scenes, cheesy music for the [intentionally] cheesy scenes, and happy music for the happier scenes. The ending song, ""Ai wa Boomerang"" performed by UY anime music regular Hiroko Matsuya (""Lum no Love Song""; ""Space Is Super Weird!""), is a catchy piece of pop music that'll stay in your head for a long time.

Finally, if you're still hesitant to pick this movie up because of its age, then let me tell you that it's really a non-factor. For a film that's about 20 years old, the animation here is superb. The quality is much better than the TV show (which, unfortunately, does show its age -- well, the early episodes, at least), and should certainly be able to satisfy today's anime audiences.",1078617600,4,3888,4.727138643067847

Oh. I forgot to stress how lucky you are to get hold of this film in DVD. In Japan, the Laser Disc and VHS videos have gone out of production, and for some reason or another, the DVD edition has not been released. In other words, this is the only legitimate release of DVD in the whole wide world.

824864,5,6304239661,"Although not a film I'd recommend for someone who isn't familiar with the cast of characters of 'Lum,' I nonetheless now place it among my all-time favourite animated features.
It this curious film, Lum, Shinobi, Ataru, and the rest of the central cast of the series find themselves the only beings left in perhaps the entire world. They later realize that the entire world has been reduced to a 2 km area around Ataru's house... and that's when things start to get really strange.
This film grabbed my attention immediately. The plot seemed to be something well beyond the standard 'Lum' wacky comedy that I'm used to from the graphic novels... there was a mystery here, and from the outset I was interested in seeing how it would be resolved. As the mystery deepend, the film actually started to get rather creepy--something I'd never thought possible for this particuarly property--and the mix of humour and mild horror was extremely effective. Even as the mystery reached its resolution, the creepiness deepened and for a time I wondered if it was going to be possible for the filmmakers to restore the light-hearted Lum-verse to its previous state.
They managed to do just that... and they managed to deliver a highly satisfying ending. What's even more remarkable, over the course of 'Beautiful Dreamer,' they breathed more life into Lum and Ataru than I thought could be possible; they've always been rather one dimensional characters to me--not it a bad way, but that's all they needed to be. But in 'Beautiful Dreamer,' we are shown another facet of Ataru, and Lum's character deepens as well.
This is a fine addition to any Rumiko Takashasi and/or Lum fan's collection. However, just stick with the subtitled Japanese version. The voice actors in the English language one leave a lot to be desired.",976060800,,1808,4.911764705882353
824865,5,6304239661,"After the fantastic Only You I expected the second Urusei Yatsura movie to be another laugh-a-second romp through outer space.
It isn't. What it is  is a little odd actually. It's a story which focuses on the human cast of  Urusei Yatsura, leaving the aliens (except Lum and Ten) out, apart from the  odd namecheck and cameo in Ataru's dream sequence. Instead we're treated to  a surreal, seemingly post-apocalyptic mystery world inhabited only by the  core Urusei Yatsura characters.
And very strange it is too. I don't want  to give anything away, although the title does that very well on its own,  but this story is not what you expect at all. Which is a good thing in many  ways. It's full of surprises and odd twists. But beneath it all, supporting  it like a stone collossus (sorry, in joke) is the old Urusei Yatsura  humour. Because the jokes, puns and slapstick are there, the rest of the  film feels fun, not complex and heavy. And in the end you come out having  been entertained, and perhaps a little disturbed. An utterly fantastic  film.

825253,5,6304239661,"The first time I saw this movie, my reaction was ""...what--?""  But that is one of the reasons I immediately loved it.  There's not much to say that hasn't been said here, but for those of you not familiar with the  series, this is a good introduction, although much of it is confusing if  you're not familiar with the plot and characters.  In the context, however,  this doesn't really matter--in fact, it adds to the surrealism!  The series  itself is not, in my opinion, quite as good, although I love it.

This  particular movie was done collaboratively by people who worked on such  anime classics as Project A-Ko, Ghost In the Shell (the guy that did Ghost In The Shell, Tank Police, etc., did this movie!), and a few  others.  (I have to agree with a friend of mine, who described the series  as being ""more Hanna-Barbera""!--at least at first; later on it gets much better.)

Okay, I have to say this.  I'm sick of hearing people complain about the dub.  It is very good.  Yet I hear people saying the new dubs for the other movies are an improvement--no no no.  The new Lum has a whiney voice that gets very irritating.  Okay, there are a few minor flaws in this dub, but no big deal.  And the decision to cast the same guy as Ataru AND Mendou, was pure genius.  If you are familiar with the series you'll understand why I say this, if not, just nod & smile.  :)

To sum up: I love the series,  love the comics even more, but this movie is, to me, the high point of  Urusei Yatsura.  (Oh yeah, the series constantly makes references to Star  Blazers; this movie is no exception!)",927849600,,1586,4.357388316151202

7866545,4,6304239661,"It seems like  for many anime viewers who have been watching anime for nearly or over three decades as I have has seem to comment on Urusei Yatsura's 2nd movie ""Beautiful Dreamer"" as a film that would be a classic.

A film that would deviate from the comedic style of the TV series and although still retaining its humor, to really show an almost sci-fi, yet almost serious storyline thanks to director and screenwriter Oshii Mamoru.

Many people know what kind of cerebral anime that Oshii would create after this film but this is where his talent was first displayed and where many anime fans at that time would clamor of how this was the ultimate anime film.

Originally released in theaters back in 1984, the series really had some major politics behind-the-scenes as Oshii who was really ticked off with how he had to change things for the producers for the first film, wanted to do things his own style with the second film.  Not only did series creator Takahashi Rumiko nearly canned the script, Oshii also drew the ire of anime fans of the popular series.

For me, back in the early 90's ""Urusei Yatsura"", ""Ranma 1/2' and ""Maison Ikkoku"" were Takahashi Rumiko fan favorites on the fan sub scene.  In fact, I remember when she came to San Diego Comic Con in the early 90's and rocker Matthew Sweet had a Lum tattoo.  ""Urusei Yatsura"" had its major fandom and people really talked about this film nearly ten years after it first came out in theaters in Japan.  And yet for me, I was talking about corellations between this film and a Star Trek: the Next Generation episode about time repeating itself.

With ""Beautiful Dreamer"", Oshii takes the Urusei Yatsura cast for a ride as the team is preparing for a festival but for some reason, it seems like things are repeating itself and Ataru, Lum and friends start to realize something is wrong when they realize that they are the only ones in their city that are alive.  Only Ataru's home and a nearby supermarket are the only functioning parts of the city and something has gone awry.

What has happened to the word?  What has happened to the school?  Who's behind it all?

Really, I don't want to spoil the film for anyone but what I will say that the fact that Oshii was behind the creation of this film and what he was able to accomplish in his career so far, you can look back at this film and just see how the famed director/screenwriter was able to come out of his shell and really make you think.  Granted, it's not as cerebral as ""Ghost in the Shell"" but nevertheless, with the humor that ""Urusei Yatsura"" is known for but to put the cast in a situation for a film like this was quite interesting.

VIDEO:

I did not own the original DVD release back in 1998 but according to the back cover, it says it features digitally remastered video.  From my viewing, I felt that the anime series on DVD looked great for a 1984 film.  I've read that the Japanese remaster of the film was great because it was anamorphic but US Manga Corps did not use that transfer and chose to remaster it their own way.  Signs still have its hard subtitles but all in all, not having owned or seen the Japanese remastered DVD, I can just tell you from my experience with this DVD that the animation looks great!

AUDIO:

I watched the film primarily in Japanese but I did watch certain parts of it with the original English dub.  But I wasn't really into the English dub (but my preference is more towards the Japanese voice acting anyway) but I'm sure those who prefer that, may enjoy it.  But watching it in Japanese and hearing Hirano Fumi as Lum and Furukawa Toshio as Ataru is just fun and I love watching those two interact.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Specia features include an art galler, original Japanese trailer (which is widescreen btw...), the US trailr and trailer for the first film.  The biggest special feature that makes this DVD worth owning though is the director's commentary by Oshii Mamoru.  For those who are familiar with his work know that this man is a man of few words.  And for him to give commentary for a film he did back in 1984 is special.  I mean...as in a rarity.  So, this alone enhances this DVD and makes it a ""must-buy""!

For nostalgia reasons, I really wanted to see this film again and you can purchase it online for a good price these days.

There has been so much said about this film, may it be looked as ""classic"" because of its storyline, because it was written and directed by Oshii Mamoru or enjoyed by many as it was one of the first anime films to be shown on television and many people watched it on the Sci-Fi channel and thoroughly enjoyed it's repeating timeline story.

But for me the DVD was special in that I watched it with many fellow anime fans during an anime club meeting and remembering the laughs and everyone enjoying it.  I remember just being around that ""Urusei Yatsura""/Takahashi Rumiko crazy fandom in the early 90's and how everyone would clamor for the fan subs.  And nearly 25 years later, after its release in the theaters and just realizing how much of a classic this film is, how much of a part Oshii Mamoru played and how it influenced him on works in the future and more.

I have no idea if a new version of this film will come out in 1999 for it's 25th Anniversary, I would imagine a Blu-ray release in Japan to celebrate it but for now and for it's low price, for those who have been curious about this film or wondered if it is worth purchasing, the answer is a ""YES""!.  It's definitely worth owning this film but also for it's rare special feature commentary featuring Oshii Mamoru.

Definitely check it out!",1221523200,,5621,4.472549019607843
