6984023,5,B00SHJLVWM,"So what we have here is the exact same plot of Vampires (2010). Difference is, this one actually gets it right. Dont get me wrong, I liked the previous movie, but this one is amazingly hilarious. The characters are downright brilliant and acted out exceedingly well. The direction is fantastic, moving from one scenario to another with ease. The humor may not be for everyone as it is kind of dry, but I thought it worked perfectly. Suffice to say, the movie is awesome and pardon me while I take off to go watch it again. 4.5/5",1422748800,46,528,4.453608247422681
6984024,5,B00SHJLVWM,I loved watching the random daily vampire lives of the silly cast. Great music and the after credits scene is what made me give it a 5 instead of a 4.,1534464000,,150,3.870967741935484
6984025,4,B00SHJLVWM,"This movie is about the lives of three vampires.  It is filmed as if it were a reality show or documentary style film.  It is actually pretty funny.  The director, who also plays a lead role in the film, is one of the masterminds behind flight of the conchords, which is a funny live stage comedy duo.  It's a little bit creepy, similar to adam's family.  but very funny similar to the office.  Enjoy!",1534464000,,401,4.351351351351352

6984028,5,B00SHJLVWM,"My wife and I watched this movie while on vacation, it is hands down one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  As soon as we got home I ordered it.  What We Do in the Shadows elevates the mockumentary genre to an entirely new level.  Step aside This is Spinal Tap, you're no longer the pinnacle of mockumentary, What We Do in the Shadows goes to 12! They twist every bit of vampire mythology in a hilarious way.  I don't want to spoil what they do in the movie just know that you HAVE TO BUY this movie.  You will watch it many times.",1534377600,,538,4.037735849056604

6984032,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I picked this movie up on a whim because my husband loves mockumentaries and I love Taika Waititi and we were NOT disappointed. This is easily among the top 4 funniest movies I've ever seen. We have made basically every person we know watch this movie.

As an additional bonus, Jemaine Clement finally gave me the perfect description for my fashion aesthetic: Dead but Delicious.",1534204800,,379,4.8307692307692305

6984037,5,B00SHJLVWM,"You will find plenty of laughs in this movie, from the ridiculous, to the cheeky, from the witty, to the satirical, the humour in this movie is varied and fresh. This Vampire mockumentary strips the too-serious ""ugh, I'm so hot and magical, ancient and perfect"" vampire visage and shows us what vampires are REALLY like, day to day. Through chores, getting ready to go out on a Friday night, making friends and navigating the social scene, this movie was a treat from beginning to end.

My favorite lines from the movie:

Vladislav: Just leave me to do my dark bidding on the internet!
Viago: What are you bidding on?
Vladislav: I'm bidding on a table.

Deacon: When you are a vampire, you become very sexy.

Vladislav: I go for a look which I call dead but delicious

I watch this movie about once a year. Watch it, you won't regret it.",1534032000,,837,4.516556291390729

6984052,4,B00SHJLVWM,"This is a very funny movie and it will sneak up on you. You'll find yourself thinking about it, and laughing, later! Anyone who is a fan of Flight of the Conchords will like it, I think. The actors have great timing and dead-pan delivery. Especially if you like ""horror"" movies that are silly/stupid or are really sick of the horror genre. Refreshing and unique.",1533168000,,362,4.584615384615384

6984055,4,B00SHJLVWM,"This is wonderfully dry Kiwi humor at its finest. Smart filmmaking and good chemistry between the actors cement this as comedic gold, and leagues above the trash that gets passed off as comedy in theaters.",1532995200,,205,4.885714285714286
6984056,5,B00SHJLVWM,"When I first watched this 4 years ago, I have to admit I found it terribly boring.  I didn't have a great understanding of vampire lore (still don't), I didn't recognize any of the actors, and I didn't take any time to examine the humor. Twilight and its million spinoffs had already turned me off of the whole trope. I couldn't even finish the movie.
  Maybe it's not true, but I'd like to think I've spent the years since then growing as a consumer of comedy (definitely not to my own credit) and discovering the brilliance of Flight of the Conchords (Jemaine Clement, Rhys Darby, yum) among other comedic geniuses with cult followings; after all this time, I revisited this movie and have honestly watched it five times in the last two weeks. I really do think that familiarity with Flight of the Conchords and the brilliant figures of the New Zealand film industry really do deepen your appreciation for this timeless piece of satire, but you don't have to be The Most Beautiful Girl in the Room to know that Jemaine Clemens and Taika Waititi mean Business Time with this cleverly developed mocumentary. The references to other vampire stories, nods to novels and films, and examination of the human condition at large combined with their unique brand of humor puts a deliciously witty and simultaneously relatable spin on characters in an otherwise tired genre that is usually overrun with emotionally inaccessible superhumans.  And to top it off, most of the footage is improvised. Seriously impressive.
  This has 76% 5-star reviews. Twlight: New Moon has 79%. Watch this with your friends and let's right the reviews.",1532995200,,1625,4.869565217391305

6984059,5,B00SHJLVWM,"This movie made me laugh. hahahaha I'm still laughing a little! It doesn't take itself too seriously and even breaks through the forth wall more than once. I though all the acting was great! Good comedic timing by all. If you know how to have fun and enjoy plain old dumb humor, this is the movie for you.",1532822400,,305,4.275862068965517

6984061,4,B00SHJLVWM,"great movie, and nothing was wrong with the movie. The only reason it gets a star off is because I was (slightly) annoyed that the case that I got for it was not the artwork that is shown in the picture.

It was boring and un-adventurous. this move doesn't deserve 5 stars, apparently the people that gave it 5 stars are DARK. this movie is so cheesy that it should be rated as a B movie, but every one has their own likes and dislikes.",1532390400,,277,4.346153846153846

6984072,5,B00SHJLVWM,What a surprise.  If you're a fan of vampyr you'll love this.  It was really well done.  I've watched it twice so far and the 2nd time was better than the first.  This cover's it all from  Nosferatu to Twilight in a goth manner.  Even adds a vampire similar to the one on the AMC series Preacher.  Classic cult material here.,1531958400,,325,4.229508196721311
6984073,5,B00SHJLVWM,"So glad I found this on a Prime movie recommendation list by doing a Google search! Funny, clever, sweet. Never thought I could get through the gore, but this is truly comical, cool and original -- with wonderful characters.

6984075,1,B00SHJLVWM,Couldn't even get 5 minutes in. What a stupid movie.,1531785600,,52,4.3
6984076,5,B00SHJLVWM,"Brilliant in every way, this is the pinnacle of horror-comedy-satire. It's incredibly endearing, and despite what you might think of it at first, it really is a ""feel-good"" movie. I knew nothing about it going in, and watched it on a whim, and I'm so glad I did.

Fun fact: there were around a billion hours of footage (a lot of improv) that took about a year to cut down to 90 minutes. I would have loved to have seen what they had to leave on the cutting room floor, I imagine a lot of that footage was a bit painful to excise from the final edit. I wish they could edit all that together into a short series.

I do here that there is a sequel in the works, but seeing how long it took to edit the first one, and that Taika Waititi had this little side project ( think it was called something like ""Thor: Ragnarok""? I don't know, has anyone heard of this? :p ), it may take a while before that happens. If it does, I do hope that ""We're Wolves"" is just as silly and, well, counterintuitively warm and human.

Also, still rooting for a series!",1531785600,,1044,4.158415841584159

It's on par with the best of the Spinal Tap / Guffman troupe.  It might not match their best moments or diversity of cast, but  it pays off.  The jokes are predictable but in exactly the right way.

The characters are all likeable, though VIago and Vladislav (""I am known as Vladislav the Poker"") are the two standouts in my opinion.",1530403200,,525,4.21

So many 'reality or faux pas reality' shows bore us to tears, but here it such a refreshing take of a different king of reality setting - and with so much hilarity, I threw up from laughing on several occasions - perhaps not what they were after - but how I laughed (and thoroughly love) this ingenious take on nocturnal reality films.

6984112,5,B00SHJLVWM,"Harmless fun with vampires (besides the few people who get their main arteries ripped open or guts torn apart). with the small, tight-knit group of roommate vampires who are unstoppably lovable (and definitely eat people...).

It's an amazing mockumentary that definitely ranks among the best. It finds it humor not only in playing with vampire lore (a cat with a human face had me rolling with laughter), but also just the little interactions between the characters. The film takes a delightful turn when the vampire boys, for example, fawn over their new human friend Stu, and it really is hard not to fall for Stu's mild-mannered good heart while he teaches the vampires how to find virgins online (""I don't think she's a virgin if she's doing that..."").

I can't think of a single wasted scene in the movie. In fact, I can't wait to watch this again to catch all the references I undoubtedly missed the first time!",1529625600,,918,4.767295597484277

Definitely not for the viewer who expects a Tarantino's kind of non-stop action, killings and vampire persecutions. No.!
 What we do in the shadows is a ""mockumentary"", with lots of sarcasm, dark and morbid comedy. For vampire lovers it is a must see!  It reminded me somewhat of Polanski's ""The fearless vampire hunters"".
There are many, many subtelties in the gothic scenery, the acting performances and the filmed segments. They have turns and twists and unexpected situations, which turn the movie into a visually pleasant and witty experience. Acting was OK for a ""mockumentary"".

It's not the one listed on the site.  My copy came with a different cover art (as you can see in the photo) and was missing an important extra, the commentary by Waititi/Clement.

6984198,5,B00SHJLVWM,"It's rare to find a movie that was obviously so much fun in the making, and yet is also so well-made. This is a mockumentary about a small group of vampires who've found themselves sharing a house in New Zealand together.
If you've enjoyed Jemaine Clement or Taika Waititi's work in the past (Flight of the Conchords), this is, in my opinion, easily the best project they've done together (and I really like Flight of the Conchords). But in this movie, the comedy, timing, acting, is really all peak-performance stuff.
The central-cast fit their roles perfectly, each mocking a variety of vampire-tropes: Anne Rice's sexually-repressed dandies, Francis Ford Coppola's Gothic womanizers, the ""Lost Boys"" in leather-pants, and... Nosferatu. And they actually work together, and make sense. They're a sign of their times, and they equally struggle in today's world, to hilarious results.
The movie at times feels just like a camcorder love-project done by a group of great friends, but only in the good way. Taika's directing is obviously technically-proficient and top-shelf, but his movies always seem to carry that amateurish delight. Something about the joy of the project actually permeates into the actors' performances and the film itself. This movie is a blast, and an extremely rare-treat in today's filmography.
This was funded by Kickstarter, because comedic-creativity in Hollywood has been clinically-dead for a while if you haven't noticed. I'm pretty sure Marvel's Ant-Man is as close to comedy as Hollywood gets now, except oh! -- look at that! They hired Taika Waititi to direct a Marvel movie!

This is simply a fun movie meant to entertain and in my opinion it was really well done. We can talk about the negatives of filming technique, the manner in which hand held cameras should or shouldn't be used, but at the end of the day the only question is, ""Did you enjoy the movie?' It was entertaining, witty, and kept me thoroughly amused, and that is all I need to know. The comedy about stating the obvious, and making fun of a genre revered by so many showed the essence of truly creative minds. One can tell this movie was made by, directed by, and acted by people who really enjoyed themselves and liked one another. For my part I was amused and entertained without any effort on my part.",1521849600,,886,4.408536585365853

What We Do in the Shadows is dry, witty, and whimsical -- as expected of Jemaine Clement and Taika Waitit -- with a dose of macabre, and it is definitely the funniest, most clever movie I've seen in a while.  This movie's fanbase will definitely include people who...

- Have housemates.  Ugh, the struggle is real ...for fanged flatmates, too;
- Shine their buckled boots and mark their calendars for the monthly Goth Night at the local club;
- Own a top hat, bustle, or entire suit made of velour;

With so many vampire related shows and movies out there that focus on how powerful and sexy and whatever vampires are, it's great to watch something where vampires are honestly kind of losers. I've always liked the concept of supernatural beings portrayed in a very mundane manner, and this movie does that very well while having some great lines and situational jokes.",1521072000,,467,4.924050632911392

Not over the top; not taking itself too seriously or being too ridiculous; this movie feels almost mundanely humorous about its subjects.  It reminds me a lot of The Office in that its memorably misfit characters in otherwise mundane circumstances with a very matter-of-fact tone about the whole thing.  Vampires fighting about the dishes feels like Dwight yelling about his stapler being in jello...comfortably mundane and ridiculous at the same time.

I don't like documentaries, particularly ""documentaries"" that are actually propaganda films.
This presents itself as a documentary about vampires.

6984356,4,B00SHJLVWM,"Very silly! Very dark sometimes, but then it is a vampire movie so that's to be expected. It's mostly just a comedy though, done in the ""documentary"" style, like a film crew is following around a group of vampires and filming their lives. It's fun to see them try to cope with the modern world. I think this should be turned into a TV series, or at least they could make some sequel movies. I love Jemaine Clement from ""Flight of the Conchords"" and mostly watched this because he was in it (he also co-wrote and co-directed it). There are some very funny moments, some not so funny moments, and some just gory or gross. But it's basically a silly and lighthearted comedy, just rather strange. OK, it's hard to describe. Just watch it.",1514246400,,734,4.485074626865671

The movie is shot as a documentary following several vampires around as they try to exist in the modern day.  I've got to say that it's good - maybe very good.  The humor is sometimes subtle and sometimes slightly ""slap-stick"" but it is continuous through out the entire movie.  The acting is good and the writing is clever.

I get the weird feeling from various reviews that people think this is highbrow humor or something with their comments about how it's ""subtle humor."" It's about as subtle as a Kardashian. There is nothing subtle about it. It's very obvious, very dull-witted humor. The only thing ""subtle"" about it would be the level of actual comedy. It's subtle as in ""not funny"" or ""so mildly amusing that it is not actually even amusing.""

Goofy & Witty. Cleverly silly. I'm really impressed with their choices, like throwing in special effects and contraptions only when it was really clever.  Like the spinning room fight for example.

There aren't really ""jokes"" per se as much as guys who are supposed to vampires say silly things - didn't really seem like jokes, though.
A guy saying ""pasgetti"" instead of ""spaghetti' over and over isn't funny. Just because he's supposed to be a vampire doesn't change things.

There's a point in the movie where the guys go to a club. It's supposed to be funny because they act silly.

It follows predominantly four vampires that live in a house in New Zealand and they give glimpses into what their lives are like. This mockumentary, like others have coined it to be, took me by surprised. The mockumentary kept a smile on my face most of the time. The one phrase that sticks out to me that made me chuckle a bit was when Nick said, ""I'm like Twilight!"" To that, my commentary was ""No, you most certainly not!""

(there have been funnier ones).  All in all, it was entertaining and worth the view.  I love 'mockumentaries', but Christopher Guest is the pinnacle of that genre.  The only non-Guest mocumentariy that got me to laugh out loud was 'Fear of a Black Hat'.  This one came close, but not quite there.

6984635,5,B00SHJLVWM,"Im not a vampire fan, but I do love mockumentary genre films and shows.  This was well done and funny.  Also, I love the juxtaposition of vampires getting along in modern life situations.

6984636,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I loved the movie and I'll talk about that last but I'm going to start with the product of the Blu-Ray which is usually the information I'm looking for when I buy DVDs. The item I purchased was the Paramount Blu-Ray listed as published in 2015. However the Blu Ray cover was different than what is shown on the website and I'm providing an image for that. The Blu Ray picture quality is great. A DVD would probably have been just as good for the content. There are great extras including a shorter film which is basically a rough draft of the movie which is a lot of fun because it's pretty good on it's own and it's interesting to see the differences in the creative decisions. I believe these extras are also on the DVD but I can't confirm that myself.

The movie itself is great however it has a certain kind of humor that might not appeal to everyone. It's produced by the creators of Flight Of The Conchords including starring Jemaine Clement whose profile has become indy-hot in recent years most recently co-starring in the quirky-weird (and wonderful) Legion series on FX. This isn't as head trippy as Legion and it's not heavy at all. It's just that quirky New Zealand dry comedy. It's fun and it takes the comedy just as far as it needs to without taking it too far. As a Vampire movie collector whose tastes run from classic to campy, to modern, this is just a lot of fun!",1499817600,6,1383,4.40234375

6984638,2,B00SHJLVWM,"It really isn't that funny. The bits drag on too long and the punchlines fall flat. The film misses opportunities to really develop the characters and doesn't really push the absurd situations a group of co-habitating vampires might be expected to have to deal with. It's a good idea that could really have worked with better execution, but is just a tedious exercise with far too few amusing moments. The guys who made this should go back and watch Spinal Tap a few more times, just to see how this could have been done.",1499731200,,521,4.553191489361702

6984645,5,B00SHJLVWM,"The humor of this mockumentary was dry and sly, but really grew on me after the slow start.  I was pleasantly surprised by the insights of this movie, both in highlighting the difficulties of vampires' integration into modern life, but also the dynamics of several different types of relationships.  I felt that the portrayal of the main characters added very creative twists to the stereotypes of their ""species"", and really echoed many people I know in everyday life.

Note, there are some risque and intense parts that not all parents may want their children to see - but they are were mild enough for our family.  It is a great addition to all the movies and TV coming from these guys in New Zealand that we love, such as Flight of the Conchords and Hunt for the Wilderpeople.

It will make you laugh. And if you don't like it when people leave pointlessly repetitive reviews then you should probably just stop reading this review. It's pointlessly repetitive.

If you've never heard of Taika Waititi, you would do well starting here. (and in case you weren't aware- he's the one directing the ""Thor Ragnorak"" flick).

The idea of a film crew being invited into a vampire's den for a bit of comedy lacked to actors to pull it off. It saddens me to realize that I've finished to movie and legitimately have no idea where the plot went. I'm not saying this to be mean or one sided, because I always like to point out some positive points to any movie, but this didn't really have any. I mean.. It was cool to see the writers pay respect to the first movie vampire (from the silent film era). Sorry folks, but I wouldn't waste your time. I don't see how people are reviewing this well.

I am very difficult to please when it comes to comedies - not much makes me laugh because it's usually so predictable and bores the brains out.

As the story progressed, it started to get really ludicrous, ludicrously funny.  This comedy wasn't written to be taken too seriously by anyone.  It was just so over the top unbelievable and funny that it had me hooked, I had to continue watching.  The characters were so zany and each reminiscent of their own time periods, oldest one dating far back as 8000 years, in which they had met their untimely demise that brought some interest to their present living situation.

6984810,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I didn't know Kiwis knew how to make films (just kidding). This hilarious film is supposed to be a documentary on the ""lives"" of four vampires who are flatmates. One is prissy, another is a slob, another is a pervert and another is a grotesque Nosferatu, and they squabble over clothing, chores, going out. There are a lot of details that jump out at you and are very funny. At one point another man is turned into a vampire rather than a meal and he causes havoc in their lives. The climax occurs when they go to the yearly undead get together---in a bowling alley---and they bring a mortal along whom they've grown fond of.",1492473600,,625,4.443478260869565

It's perfectly timed!  They actually care about each other.  They don't want to be mean -- which is refreshing.  Most movie characters are stuck up and superficial -- but these are more like real life.  They're not jerks.  It's fun.  It has a lot of dark humor -- which I love.  I love the supernatural genre or type of movies.  I've watched it many times and I almost never do that.  It lifts your spirits.  Yes, it does!  If you're lonely, this a great movie for outcasts; 'cause even if you are an outcast -- you're really not, 'cause there are so many of us like that, in the world.  This movie is an inspiration.  It's how people will get along in the future.  What a gem!  Thank you for making it!  5+ stars!  Superlative!

As a mock-u-mentary this film has what you would expect (random references to the camera, divergent interviews, unrelated events) but takes it to a whole new level.  Cheesy special effects only added to the experience.  Worth a viewing, but for simple entertainment value only... your IQ may test lower after you see the film.",1491091200,,350,4.8
6984857,4,B00SHJLVWM,"This movie has a clever premise, very good production values and is funny in a ""Three Stooges"" kind of way (I love the Stooges), but I think only if you're into the genre (I'm not). I was expecting a light urban comedy in a ""Three Men and a Baby"" (without the baby) mold. The movie is a mocumentary (the film crew wear crucifixes and have been promised they won't be harmed) and takes place in Wellington, New Zealand. It includes all the standard memes, the vampires must be invited in to a building, they have no reflections in a mirror and so on.

The flatmates are a rebellious 160 some years old youngster with an attitude, a prissy eighteenth century dandy (think Felix from The Odd Couple), an 800 year old Middle Ages type who used to live in a castle and terrorize peasants, and an 8000 year old hard case with make-up in the style of the Twenties silent film classic, Nosferatu. I'm not familiar with the actors but they do a fine job portraying the disparate characters.

""What We Do In The Shadows"" has plenty of spurting blood, assorted body parts and vampiric hissing. I began the review by awarding three stars but added one because I can't in honesty pan the movie due to it not being my dish of tea. If you are a fan of the genre and appreciate an outside the box take on it, give it a try.",1491091200,4,1307,4.330612244897959

6984860,1,B00SHJLVWM,Maybe it's a cultural thing. The trailer looked good and it seemed it would be funny but it wasn't. Great idea and concept just not executed well at all. I watched it in fast forward mode in like 25 minutes. I don't see how anyone thought it was funny but like I said maybe it's a cross cultural thing.,1491004800,3,302,4.135593220338983

I would tell you about some of the funniest scenes but I don't want to spoil it for you.

Do rent or watch via Amazon Prime. It's worth every minute of your time.  I loved it so much I've now got it in my cart fir purchase. Wanted to write this review before I got sidetracked.

6984914,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I love quirky. The more outlandish  the idea, the more I am entertained and amused. This mockumentary haling from New Zealand is hilarious. It gives ""Shaun of the Dead"" a serious run for its money in terms of making fun of the fascination popular culture has with the underworld. If you are intrigued by weirdness, enjoy out of the box dark humor and fantasize a tryst with the silly nature of the macabre then this is your movie.",1490400000,8,430,4.512820512820513

They have the same issues as humans with roommates with the unique issues that vampires face in a modern world. You have to like and understand vampire lore to enjoy this movie.

6984927,3,B00SHJLVWM,"Basically Napoleon Dynamite with vampires. It's cute and has its moments, but there were parts that were just incongruent with the tone of the movie. They actually do kill a few people and it makes you like them less because of it. I think it would've been funnier if they'd been so inept at being vampires that they basically let most people go. It's not that I mind violence and blood, I don't. But it didn't play well when juxtaposed with wardrobe dillemmas, erotic dances, and learning how to text.

Occassionally it slid into Borat levels of humor which weren't great. Three stars. Not an instant classic in my book.",1490313600,,621,4.6454545454545455

Obviously, it will never get the recognition it deserves, however that's fine. This mash-up of vampire mythology, Twilight, Nosferatu, and today's documentary-style of realism make this film a complete hoot!

6984987,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I put the subtitles on so I wouldnt miss any of the humor in this movie. Its a novel approach to see home life from the perspective of the undead and the entire cast does an excellent job with it. Even the special effects are good and the whole thing with the werewolves was pretty brilliant. I liked them dressing up to go out for the night to get some blood and not knowing if they looked good because there wasn't a reflection in the mirror. Pretty much all the vampire clichs were used and some new ones added like a quick scene from Coppolas Dracula. It does have a few slow spots and some tedious humor but, overall, it was a good view and it had a few surprises and plot twists. At free on Prime you cant go wrong.",1489276800,24,721,4.120567375886525

I won't repeat what all the other reviewers already have stated about this ""mockumentary"". But to me the funniest line was when asked why you like ""virgin"" blood...the darker one (sorry I don't know their names much) says ""Well it's just better to eat a sandwich knowing nobody f#%@ed it first ya know"". That and the fight scenes while the Cops come straight in were hilarious to me...so why only 4 stars? B/C I was so happy to FINALLY find a REALLY GOOD movie on Prime I wanted my husband to enjoy it too....instead about 1/2 hr. into it he asked ""what is this even about?"". No sense of humor at all...I just said ""Nothing and that's why it is hilarious"". This is my style of humor tho and happy I gave it a look.",1489276800,9,929,4.138121546961326

What We Do in the Shadows is about a group of vampires trying to fit in with modern-day society. The group is being followed around by a film crew who wants to record their everyday lives. I thought this movie would be low-budget, with bad acting, and cheap thrills. This movie is so much more. It contains everything from death, lost romance, roommate fights, and so much drama. If you're looking to laugh at a bunch of funny, drama-filled, and psychotic roommates- this is the movie for you. Please keep in mind this movie is not for everyone. The characters are so stupid & silly that you cannot help but grin. With everything that's going on in the world today, sometimes we just need to cut loose and laugh.

6984996,5,B00SHJLVWM,"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss your life good-bye! (figuratively speaking that is)
Filmed as a Documentry-this HYSTERICALLY FUNNY FILM is a MASTERPIECE of blood, gore and four....(er, make that ""three""...a nasty sunlight accident and all that) of the funniest group of mismatched Vampire's ever to share a Flat.
This mismatched group come from different era's and customs-yet somehow make sharing a home work.
Of course, as with any group of roomies, there are flare-ups from time to time, like doing your share and washing the 5 years of blood soaked glasses you left in the kitchen sink. Or being respectful of another's property by laying newspapers on their antique sofa before a midnight snack of fresh human.
Trials and tribulations aside, the gang even makes friends with the human ""best friend"" of a guy they recently fed on.
Ahhh...but sharing more would spoil the fun! Just know this film is a riot, is well written and acted, and I WANT MORE!!!!!!!!!",1489104000,16,968,4.981481481481482

6984999,5,B00SHJLVWM,"This is a dry comedy vampire documentary. The acting, writing, effects, and directing are all excellent.  The comedy seems to come naturally out of documenting the experience of vampires that share a house in New Zealand.  There are constant comic riffs on the vampire tradition.  The film successfully treats everything fantastic as if it were natural and in the real world.  They back that up with solid effects so you are not taken out of the world of the film when the action picks up.  An enjoyable film all around.",1489104000,,520,4.733333333333333
6985000,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I had never seen this movie before, but I went ahead and bought it anyway because I kept hearing rave reviews about it. And oh my lord, it does NOT disappoint. It takes all the vampire movie tropes and just runs with it. And it's not like it's a cheap gag-a-minute flick like one of the many parody-type comedies floating around out there---it's written in such a smart way that if you're paying attention you catch little details here and there that make you giggle. WWDITS has some happy and sad moments, so it makes you feel invested in the characters; this is an element that I feel a lot of parody-type comedies tend to lack, and that's a shame. They also tend to lack copious amounts of blood spraying all over the place. (Also a shame.)
So if you're a horror fan, or just like vampire flicks, I highly recommend this movie. Just don't forget to wear your track pants.",1489104000,,874,4.434782608695652

I wanted to laugh and enjoy it because the concept of vampires troubles living together and discussing who has to wash the dishes sounds funnier spoken then watched. All I can say about it is don't bother if you are a fan of horror and good comedy. Very few actors can put the two together and have a hit.,1488844800,2,483,4.366666666666666

6985022,3,B00SHJLVWM,"As a huge fan of Jemaine Clement's music with Bret McKenzie, I really wanted to like this movie... I really wanted to love it. But, although there were specific elements and scenes that I really enjoyed, I thought the movie, for the most part, fell flat. Anyone reading this, by now, knows that it's a mockumentary about modern life of vampires in Wellington, NZ... at least how these guys imagine it would be. But all of the comedy rests on that one concept and it never, ever goes any further than that. Ever. Clever set up, but I don't think they took enough time to develop a rich enough story to justify actually making a movie, but instead tried to make a movie out of that one idea. I did enjoy the lush wardrobe, sets and accents. And the acting was good also- the tender expressiveness of Taika Waititi's Viago and the sexy confidence of Clement's Vlad. Also, I enjoyed the interactions of the vampires and werewolves (led by Rhys Darby) and warmth of the female officer (Karen O'Leary)- that actress is a gem. But, honestly? I'm grasping at straws here, people, if I'm praising the work of someone who was only in a couple of scenes... there was just nothing else going on in this movie!!

I know a lot of people have loved it- perhaps you'll be one of them. But for me, this movie is nothing to write home about... because nothing happened.",1488672000,,1351,4.491869918699187

Filmed in mockumentary style, the movie is at its funniest when it mocks vampire and werewolf tropes and when it shows the vampires trying to be hip to modern conveniences like the Internet.  Luckily, it is not all cheap yuks: the movie's exploration of the not so great things about being a vampire such as loneliness, how immortality complicates maintaining romantic relationships, etc. gives the movie an underlying pathos.

I'm a pretty serious Dracula/vampire buff - seen all the traditional Dracula's, the Interview with's, the documentaries, the made-for-tvs, the tv shows, the kid's movies, the Dark Shadows, the Fright Nights... I could seriously go on. Suffice it to say that I'd thought I'd seen just about every take you could do on the same old song and dance.

And then What We Do in the Shadows came up in my recommendations.

For anyone who's seen This is Spinal Tap, this is sincerely the vampire version of it. It's a strange combination of adorably innocent and blood and guts. If cute could ever be used to describe a vampire movie, this would be the time. It's funny, it's clever, and it's the perfect feel-better movie (I should know, I was feeling really down when I stumbled across it, I couldn't stop smiling as I watched it).

All in all, couldn't recommend this movie enough. If you or someone you know is as frustrated about getting a fresh vampire fix as I was, suggest/gift them this.

Not that it's sappy in any way, it's just one of those great films that works on multiple levels.  Hilarious on first viewing, and wonderfully crafted & acted upon further studious viewing.

6985235,5,B00SHJLVWM,"Just when I thought I was burnt out and couldn't stand another cheesy, Twilighty, vampire movie, I finally rented this and it got fangs in deep! This is the 4th time I've bought this movie because my copy never returns. Consistent tears of laughter. It's my new favorite movie. Ow, it makes my face hurt. I was unprepared and astonished when I came across it. The fight over the dishes hooked me and enthralled with it's constant hilarity.

In case of an earthquake or apocalypse, it will be with my survival library with Socrates, Shakespeare and De Quincy (speaking of the opium eater, this movie is addictive). I wish there were more out takes, more extras, more footage. Really enjoyed ALL, including the intro and art, the c. 200yr old band's terrible music. I covet the oil paintings and loved the horrible, hand-made, 'chore' wheel. It 'pokes' fun at all the vampire 'types', and werewolves. Flying into the air to fight... but ya got no leverage so...uh, you can really only hang there and slap each other. Then poor Vladislav, 'never gets the heads right'. He's a growling cat scaring Nick which is now my screen saver (thanks Beast). I want everyone I love to see it. The police performances were fantastic. Brilliant movie. Jackie and her penis envy. The whole movie, super funny.",1477526400,23,1291,4.763392857142857

6985237,1,B00SHJLVWM,"Many factors can make an enjoyable movie:  good writing, characters which you can identify with or admire, characters with realistic motivations and reactions, innovative film ideas, good continuity with similar movies, impressive special effects, great production values.
This film had none of the above.
Suddenly, vampires can fly in human form (with wire suspension painfully obvious).
None of the characters in this film were likeable.  The lead character tried to appear cute, while talking about killing and eating others.  The police constable seemed like her primary aim was to get in as many implausible lines as possible.  The least annoying characters seemed to those which talked the least.
This film is like assigning an Addams Family episode to someone whos never written anything before, and filling in the many plot holes with grotesque imagery.
The closest similarity I can come up with is documented in Susan Olsens book about the making of the Brady Bunch Variety Hour, in which a couple of pages from the original script which were thankfully disposed of before filming, regarding a skit called The Fraidy Bunch.  It attempted to present the Bradys along the lines of The Addams Family or The Munsters, and was truly patheticmuch like this film.  At least Sid and Marty Kroft realized that this scraped the bottom of the barrel of their tacky standards, and cut it out.

This movie presents itself as a reality show.  Obviously, the writers are very familiar with the genre, as its got the format pegged.  However, where is the humor in confronting a vampire housemate with his not doing the dishes in supposedly hundreds of years?  Where is the humor in complaining about a housemates sloppiness, and spreading newspapers to supposedly help cleaning up after a planned vicious killing, and then finding it all for naught, because the idiot tapped into the main artery, and blood squirts everywhere?

Police come.  Instead of trying to hide themselves, the protagonists stay frozen in their wire suspended poses, hoping that the main characters weak hypnosis ability will keep the police from noticing whats up.

The movie is stupid, unpleasant, and steals with little creativity, from movies such as Twilight.

Typical pathetic dialog:  He turned my **** into a snake.  Thats not cool, man.

Youve got a woman who rounds up victims, jotting down orders, as if drive throughSo 18 to 30, then, both male and female.  Virgins preferred.  In whose mind is this garbage funny?

Its silly, but not silly clever, like Eugene Ionesco, or Monty Python.  Its silly stupid.  Silly implausible.  Silly gross images.

This film was so bad, it was irritating to watch.

Why did I watch it?  Fiance request.  She wanted to watch a comedy with a Halloween theme.  Halloween theme it had.  Comedy it wasnt.",1477353600,3,2810,5.03470715835141

You'll recognize certain obvious references to Dracula, Nosferatu, Interview with the Vampire, etc, and that is part of the fun. My particular favorite character was the dandy Viago, but all
of the actors did a great job making their characters amusing and believable, and even after a second viewing it was still funny. I had to botox my entire face after watching it though. I Can't have people thinking I laugh. It will kill my street cred.",1477180800,2,736,4.575757575757576

Imagine a bunch of vampires, all complete opposites, trying to get along. It follows the lives of vampire flatmates as they struggle to get into clubs (have to be invited obviously) and meet beautiful ladies (even if they're 90 years old). This is honestly so hilarious I never stopped laughing. It's incredibly well written, with amazing dry and deadpan humor. Each vampire has a personal back story based on when they became a vampire (middle ages, Renaissance, etc.) that makes you relate to them. Even Nosferatu makes you love him!",1470873600,27,646,4.881818181818182

So he's moving. up.  but this and his new one the hunt for the vilderbeast people. is also very good. It's on at your indie film spot for now.  This blu ray looks as good as the picture at the theater.  Because it has that documentary feel.  Which it of course isn't.  The cast is good and fun. And they pull this film off very well.

6985392,5,B00SHJLVWM,"Let me start off by saying that I freaking loved this movie and this is going to be a very long review but well worth the read if you are bored.  Furthermore, to explain the length, this movie provided so much necessary distraction, and laughs a plenty that I felt it necessary to inform others.  You just have to watch this!!!!  Thus, this review is not so much a review as more so to pay homage.  Personally, I could even see this becoming a television series, as to me its that good.  For instance I can just imagine the neighbors. Im sure they would have to keep stocked up if that is even possible, to protect themselves.  Maybe invest in some crucifixes, a lot of garlic, reinforced doors, windows, something to prevent against mind control, etc.  Yeah, naw.
Anyway, I swear I have watched this film so many times that I have most of the lines memorized.  I love the fact that they used a documentary style that totally works here.  Also, love the fact that two of the lead characters, Viago (played by Taika Waititi) and Vladislav (played by Jermaine Clement) co-wrote and co-directed the film.  Yet, even with the extra work load, both give simply unforgettable and riotous performances.  Hollywood take note because what these two have managed to come up with is pure comedy gold in my eyes with people like myself willing to buy shares.
I'm still not even sure which character I liked the best as they are all golden.  Everyone shines here in my opinion, which is rare to have such a solid cast and script.  So much so that you forget its scripted, I really got into this.  They literally created fully realized lives for our main characters and enough meat, pun intended, for everyone else involved.

To officially begin I start out with our writers/directors, Viago, the quote on quote pedantic one who is just too cute with his love/obsession of his sweetheart.  They don't make them like that anymore ladies.  I kid I kid.  Vladislav is really sexy to me in a deliciously dark and obviously twisted way.  He has some of my favorite lines in the film, like:  ""And the other day I dragged a mans body down the hallway and notice that their was no dust...like I kind of..I kind of swept the hallway.  The elder vampire Peter (played by Ben Fransham) is also hilarious to me in a muted way.  Hes not very sociable, I can relate to that.  Then we have Deacon (played by Jonny Brugh), the so-called younger vampire of the group.  I just loved his tale of how he became a vampire..  I could go on and on but really I loved all of the characters and how often do you get that.  From Nick, which brings me to another favorite line of mine...my eyes bleed heeps.  Stu, Nicks sweet as a cherub best mate.  Deacons familiar,  the over used and abused Jackie.  The werewolf clan who are actually concerned with swearing. Were not swear-wolves were werewolves.  Even more comedy gold with just that group alone.  Vladislavs ex nicknamed the Beast, the police officers, literally every character.  Im telling you I have not laughed this much in a long time.  In fact, it got to the point that if I had a bad day I would just put this movie in.  I guess thats why I know it so well now.  Haha
But seriously this movie for me is top notch which thankfully Hollywood did notice and has responded as a sequel is in the works that will focus on the werewolf clan aptly titled Were Wolves which I cannot wait to see.
I also wanted to add that my favorite pack leader, the alfa male, Anton (played by Rhys Darby) was featured as a monster in the new X-Files, Season 10, Episode 3 - Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster which aired back in February 2016.

Anyway, to wrap it up, I had to mention the awesomely unique soundtrack.  For instance the opening track, Youre Dead.  The little jig they played before going out on the town, vampire style.  The various club songs played.  Loved em all!!!!!  In fact, for a complete listing of the songs heard through the film, you can simply check YouTube.  I have also provided a link here to that:

It exploits all of the inane silliness of a season of The Real World and combines it with every Vamp Mary Sue archetype there is, and the results are truly funny.

Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement are both talents to watch out for.",1469059200,,471,4.340909090909091

6985432,4,B00SHJLVWM,"The minds behind 'Flight of the Conchords', and two of its actors present us with a very droll mockumentary of everyday vampire life in Wellington, NZ. Aside from the usual ""flatmate"" issues such as washing the bloody (literally) dishes, and etiquette involving ""dibs"" on victims, to inter-personal issues with human familiars, there are problems with bringing humans to unholy parties, even getting into local nightspots and the ever looming possibilities of run-ins with lycanthropes, who run in packs and are ve-ry tou-chy. This movie actually helps fill in all the little details and fleshes out, so to speak, the four flatmates leaving us with a few outright laughs. It is actually well worth seeing for Clement's, Waititi's, and Brugh's character performances alone. If you loved 'Flight of the Conchords' you'll love this; if you ever wondered what vampires must really be like, you'll love this. If you like dry, covertly intellectual humour, you'll love this. I know I did. PS: The answer to the title. to quote Jemaine ""mostly housework""....",1468454400,2,1051,5.188235294117647

6985512,4,B00SHJLVWM,"So many mock-umentaries take you down the path of dry humor (mostly smiles, with an occasional big laugh).  This one is different.  It brought out my inner hyena and then some.  By now you know the premise - a documentary filmmaker spends time with 4 flatmates, all of whom are vampires. The opening sequence, where Viago (hope I got his name right) arises slowly and jerkily from his casket, sets the tone.  It was obvious that he was on a board that tilted nervously upward.  Other hilarious moments include our introduction to Petyr, who lives in a closet in the basement. His Orlock (Nosferatu) features (including ears that droop ever so slightly), accentuated overbite, and reptilian eyes are creepy at first, but his communication skills (which need work) turn this into a very funny moment. The segment where one of them makes a disaster out of a human blood meal is gory, but it induces a kind of guilty laughter that is hard to suppress.

6985534,5,B00SHJLVWM,"This has got to be one of the funniest movies I have seen in my entire life. It is a silly mockumentary with surprisingly nifty effects. And it's not really scary, although I would say the humor is perhaps a little too ""sophisticated"" for younger viewers (kiddoes probably shouldn't watch vampire movies anyway, right?), and those completely unfamiliar with the vampire movie genre might not get some of the jokes. The humor ranges from subtle and nostalgic to the can't-help-yourself-thigh-slapping variety. I have watched it several times with friends who have never heard of it, and ALL of them love it and end up buying it themselves, and they think I am really cool for bringing it to their attention. There are parts in this movie that will make you laugh so hard that you can't make any noise. You know that kind of laugh: where you're laughing so hard that you can't stop laughing to breathe, so you can't make any noise after a few seconds, and your gut burns and then you're sore from it the next day. The ""ab workout"" laugh. That kind of laugh. Every one I know who has seen it says the same thing.
If you love vampire movies and you also love comedy, you'll dig it. Now I need to go see what else these guys have done!",1464048000,5,1230,4.471111111111111

This movie was honestly boring, and good for maybe a chuckle or two. However, if you insist on watching it because of the great reviews on amazon, I recommend watching it on your own for the first time. This is not a movie that I would recommend to watch on a first date (or any date). Perhaps watching it with friends who share a similar sense of humor lest you wish they tar and feather your for choosing a movie that... well, sucks.

6985595,5,B00SHJLVWM,"Hilarious and shot like a true documentary, What We Do in the Shadows follows four vampires.  At no point does the story deny what they feed on or how they get their sustenance, but what the film does really well is let you see that they are more than their appetites.  Each of the characters has their own quirks and personalities that are very different, and this is what adds to the fun.  At the heart of the story, it's about roommates.  Another thing that I really love about this film are the small nuances that the filmmakers added, which make it a little more believable.  In the first encounter with the werewolves of New Zealand, you see the men's eyes begin to reflect the light (like a wolf's) as they get agitated.  It vanishes as soon as they calm down, and that is just one example of the many subtle touches that have been added to this movie that make it a lot of fun to watch.",1462147200,3,894,4.291666666666667

For a time I was hoping that wed finally driven a stake into the heart of all things Vampire, but this movie re-animates the genre and brings it hilariously back to life.  Its a surprisingly sweet fish-out-of-water tale about three adorably quirky bloodsuckers (well, four, if Peter can be considered adorable) living in modern day New Zealand.  Delight in watching them as they do their utmost to fit in and be hip while still coping with their age old challenges. One of these challenges is the lack of a reflection and their solution is nothing short of brilliant! Every conceivable clich is trotted out and given a fresh, new spin and its done with considerable wit and charm.

6985648,3,B00SHJLVWM,"I loved this side-splitting, critically praised, award-winning horror spoof in the theater. It's an uproariously funny mockumentary from New Zealand in the deadpan tradition of ""Flight of the Conchords,"" a sublime mashup of the mundane lives and bizarre antics of a quartet of very quirky vampires who share a shadowy home in suburban Wellington and participate in urban nightlife with their parasitical pals.

You can imagine my disappointment and indignation when I purchased the movie from Amazon and discovered that over two hours of ""fang-tastic"" bonus materials offered on the Blu-ray do not appear on the DVD -- not even a trailer! No commentary by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi, no behind-the-scenes footage, no deleted scenes, no featurettes, no interviews, no posters, no nothin'! And no warning in the Amazon description about the huge disparity in content!

As a result, I had to buy the movie all over again in Blu-ray format to get the extras, costing me more than double what I expected to pay, all because of the apparent greed and stupidity of executives at Paramount, the American distributor. A caution to DVD buyers: the fiends in the film aren't the only blood-suckers you need to beware of!

6985706,4,B00SHJLVWM,"Mockumentaries have been an extremely popular genre since the cult success of This is Spinal Tap. What We Do in the Shadows is a faux documentary following four Wellington, New Zealand, flatmates who are vampires. They have typical roommate problems: Deacon doesn't do the dishes, Vladislav made a mess of Viago's antique couch when he killed a victim, etc. They have trouble going out at night too: their various fashion senses haven't kept up with the times (they range from 150 to 900 years old), they can't even check themselves in the mirror, they can't get in anywhere unless they are specifically invited (makes it hard to go clubbing, or even to fast food joints). They try to help each other out by giving fashion feedback or having each other's backs when they run into a pack of werewolves. The vampires have the interesting, quirky challenges and character traits that documentary film makers love to chronicle. The show builds up to them attending the annual Wellington Unholy Masquerade (a gathering of vampires, zombies, werewolves, etc.).

The movie does a great job mocking vampire mythology, housemate problems, and documentary conventions.  Best of all, the characters come off as real people with likable and unlikable qualities. They have triumphs, set-backs, and tragedies. All are played with good humor. The movie moves quickly too (it's only 85 minutes long) so things stay fresh and fun.

It's a delightful, light comedy about vampires living in and dealing with modern day problems and people.

I heard about this movie at B-Movie Catechism which has yet to steer me wrong (I wouldn't have seen Ex Machina or It Follows with his recommendation-I-'m on the hunt for Bone Tomahawk now).",1457308800,,1711,5.035335689045937

6985709,4,B00SHJLVWM,"This mockumentary had me chuckling from the opening credits.  One being given to the New Zealand Documentary Board.  A quartet of vampires living in Wellington has given permission to a documentary crew to film them in theiruhnatural surroundings.  The crew has been promised they will not be eaten and are given crucifixes to wear.  Ive always loved vampire movies, so there are several aspects of the comedy that hit home, not the least of which are various drawings, pictures and etchings from history that are placed throughout the movie.  Most importantly are the characters, ranging in age from 183 to 8000 (or something like that).

Viago (Taika Waititi, also co-director and co-writer) reminds me of Christopher Lee from the Hammer films of the 60s although hes a bit of a dandy.  Jemaine Clement (the other co-director and co-writer) is Vladislav who is a dead ringer for Gary Oldmans Dracula in Francis Ford Coppolas 1992 film.  Deacon (Jonny Brugh) is a compilation of various vampire versions but maybe closest to Frank Langella in 1979s Dracula.  But his sense of humor outweighs his romantic tendencies.  Finally there is Petyr (Ben Fransham) who is well past his prime and is a dead ringer for Max Schreck in the silent 1922 Nosferatu.  Speaking of that classic.  Early on we see Viago come out of his coffin by rising stiff as a board (which he was most certainly laying on), feet first which is how we see Count Orlok (Schreck) first appear.  There are numerous references to various films as well including The Lost Boys.  Vladislav tells his story of coming up in the dark ages when he was known as Vlad the Poker, wordplay on the historical Vlad the Impaler.

Viago decides they need to have a ""flat meeting"" to discuss Deacons laziness.  Hes just not pulling his weight around the home.  Theres blood everywhere.  He never does the dishes.  Those kind of things.  He promises to improve.  The big event in Wellington for the boys, and other creatures of the night, is the Unholy Masquerade where they all get together once a year.  Vlad has heard rumors that he may be honored guest this year, but alas it is not to be.  Instead they invite a former lover, one he calls The Beast aka Pauline Ivanovich (Elena Stejko).  Here we also meet one of the funniest characters, a Zombie (Ian Harcourt) who plays it straight.  In a conversation with Stu, a human companion of our quartet, he senses hes out of place at the ball and inquires if he is pre-dead.

There is a lot going on in the movie including a confrontation between the guys and a group of werewolves where they hiss and growl at each other.  Stu (Stu Rutherford), the human, is an IT guru who teaches the boys all about Google and e-Bay.  All-in-all this is one hilarious film, a reminder of something Mel Brooks might pull off.  The best thing is that Clement and Waititi did their homework on vampires and other things that go bump in the night.  A comedy but with a homage to those whove gone before.  Recommended.

The Blu ray includes a 1080p video resolution with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The images look very good, consistently reflecting some of the detail put into the sets and the make-up.  Petyr in particular looks just great.  The film gets into found-footage mode on occasion when the cameraman goes running after something happening on the other side of the house or in the open field.  Black levels are good and the red blood spurts seem plenty accurate.  Audio comes by way of a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix and it is excellent as well.  Good action in the surrounds and a center-focused clear dialog throughout.  There are some good extras as well, including a host of deleted scenes, an audio commentary with Clement and Waititi, some behind the scenes preparation, numerous video extras that include a 27 minute short film, some funny interviews with the cast, in character (love the Zombie), some 1-minute promos and some posters.  Finally, there are no subtitle options other than English SDH.",1457222400,,3991,4.727536231884058

I like the general idea and there was some fun exploration but it's hit or miss for a lot of it and while I enjoy the ""mockumentary"" approach to things, that doesn't mean the finished product shouldn't be polished and the humor can't be paced and hit like a regular comedy.

The idea works as well as it could----but the filmmakers were trying to go in both directions of scary and funny---and that is a tough combo to accomplish.

A great thing about this movie is it is tastefully done because they aren't dropping the F bomb every other sentence and it isn't  too crude and vulgar.  A lot of other comedies disappoint me with doing this. They didn't need any of that to accomplish this as a great comedy. They did a great job combining different vampire characters from iconic vampire movies.  Almost every moment of this movie is funny.  The ""silly dance"" is my favorite part.

I think I've become spoiled by Anne Rice's vampire stories in that I found the vampires in this film not very bright, especially as one of them is over 8000 years old. I just think vampires would be alot more intelligent than those on display in this film and that they'd have figured out a more comfortable lifestyle, especially given how much time they've had to work out the kinks. That being said, I liked the unusual approach the storytellers take in telling their story, though I didn't think it was ultimately successful. At least they tried something different.

6985920,2,B00SHJLVWM,"A unique concept whose dark, deadpan humor loses its bite quick.  Although the talented cast embraces their undead dysfunction with monstrous passion; the joke of this mockumentary doesn't fare as beastly with jokes that become predictable and stale by the first thirty minute's end.  As original as this indie tongue and cheek vampire flick is the mixture of a loose script and overtly obvious ad-libbing just doesn't blend well and, instead, feels forced and almost precocious.  Far be it for me to judge directing choices, but including the man behind the Green Lantern debacle as a partner might be well regretted in hindsight. I was truly disappointed in a film that could have been so much more and wasted far too much potential.  A movie that is it own worst enemy, or to put it more apropos; I liken it to a self-inflicted proverbial stake through the heart.",1448582400,,866,4.831081081081081

6985936,4,B00SHJLVWM,"This movie was crazy quirky, but hilarious none the less. If you liked Flight of the Concords, this movie is for you. It's about a group of vampires (a clan, coven, clutch?) who share a house together and is presented like a reality TV show, almost like the Real World or something. It presents blood thirsty, murderous vampires as normal people with everyday (night I suppose) problems, insecurities, and desires, apart from the murder and blood lust. New Zealand is really blossoming in the film world and this is a prime example of their subtle, yet very effective dark humor.

Somehow, the characters are very relatable and it's just a great twist on the modern vampire movie while lampooning reality TV culture in the process. I absolutely recommend this movie.",1447891200,2,766,4.892307692307693

A little like ""Entourage"" with fangs, much of the dialog was ad-libbed by the cast (mostly stand-up comics from New Zealand of all places - one of the actors is Maori) & the script riffs on all the vampire cliches - you have to invite them in (a problem when they want to go nightclubbing), they can't see themselves in mirrors so the vainest member of the group frets over his appearance, their ""familiar"" grouses to the camera about having to iron the ruffles on their shirts & mop up the blood after they feed, squabbles turn into ""batfights,"" & so on.

6985970,5,B00SHJLVWM,"This has become our go-to Halloween movie! Just about the funniest vampire story ever -- how would undead wannabe hipsters survive (?) in the 21st century? Read the other reviews for a summary of the plot, just don't watch 'What we do' while eating or drinking anything (even blood) or the consumables will come right out your nose!
One comment on the R rating: While I understand not allowing primary school-age kids to watch it (a few choice swear words and spraying blood), the violence is silly rather than frightening. I'd have no problem with middle-school kids seeing the hopelessly uncool vampires attempt to live in a culture of 20-somethings out for a good time, much less their inept attempts to fit in (""Hello, ladies!""). Any youngster with access to the internet has heard and seen much, much worse than this, and may realize that it's okay to laugh at our somewhat shallow youth culture when mocked by a popular befanged trope.
This is a movie I can watch over and over, wearing a silly grin each time. Why Hollywood wastes million$ on disasters like ""San Andreas"" when a low-budget production of relative unknowns can make something this brilliant baffles me.",1446854400,2,1174,4.845771144278607

6985974,5,B00SHJLVWM,"Absolutely brilliant!  ""What We Do in the Shadows"" is absolutely the funniest mockumentary to be made since ""Spinal Tap""! If you liked the Christopher Guest films--such as ""Best in Show""--you will LOVE this film (no disrespect to Christopher intended). The subject matter is hilarious; a ""documentary"" following a group of vampires who live in a shared flat. These are the vampires who didn't invest their money well over the centuries, and who lack that certain Je ne sais quoi that makes vampires cool (though they don't seem to know it). These are the vampires that would have driven around all Saturday night looking for Lestat's party, because all of the ""cool"" vampires would avoid telling them where it was.  The effects are low budget, but really well done, and timed perfectly throughout the film for maximum comic value. Over all this is an adorable and hilarious film.**

**For those with young kids, the special effects include a fair amount of B movie style gore  (though the context makes it hilarious). This is intentionally not a scary movie--it make ""Shawn of the Dead"" look like ""Reanimator"" on that score--but it's probably a bit too much blood and gore for a six year old.",1446768000,31,1192,4.8861386138613865

6985980,5,B00SHJLVWM,"Very funny indie film.  The humor is pretty low key, but that makes more than one viewing enjoyable as you can catch things you missed.  The characters are well written and for the most part very believable.  The special effects are actually pretty good considering this movie was made for less than two million, and I would guess most of them are practical effects rather than much computer work.  Since as of this review its only $7 on Prime I think it's well worth it to support these independent filmmakers.  I think my new favorite movie quote after watching this is ""We're werewolves, not swearwolves.""",1446681600,,608,4.752380952380952

6985982,5,B00SHJLVWM,"More silly and less satirical, nevertheless, the humor prevails throughout the movie which is something that some ""classic"" comedies fail to deliver on.  A mockumentary on the exceedingly over done Vampire (and somewhat Werewolfe & Zombie) horror genre, this is a movie that needs to be reviewed a few times to catch all the subtle humor.  That said, most of the humor is self-evident and I found myself laughing often.  There's a ton of material here to work with and some angles that I never would have thought to include were pretty freakin' funny.  Lost in all the accolades are the great performances by the 3 lead vamp's----each their own defined character having their own charm and quality of lines.  Being a big fan of Spinal Tap, I will say that while the humor is a bit more ""light on it's feet"", it's nevertheless, a great movie and one that will probably become a campy cult classic.

6986017,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I can't even explain how hilarious this movie is. I saw it in the theater twice. It's about four vampires sharing a house in New Zealand, each vampire is from a different period in history so they are riffs on the various vampire stereotypes - there is a ""Nosferatu""-style one, a ""sexy vampire"" style one, etc. It's filmed like a documentary of their lives, with interviews with them, scenes of them doing various things (arguing about who does the dishes, trying to get into nightclubs, attempting to pick up women and so on) and completely undercutting the whole vampire trope. Also there are werewolves who are possibly even funnier than the vampires.",1446076800,2,654,4.848214285714286

6986025,1,B00SHJLVWM,"What We Do In The Shadows, 2014 film

It begins with an announcement that a documentary crew was granted full access to a small group of a secret society in New Zealand. A digital clock say 6:00. Each crew member wore a crucifix and was granted protection by the subjects of this movie. The vampires awake, its the start of another night. Peter is given a chicken. These mates have a meeting over their responsibilities, one hasn't done the dishes in five years. Each tells about their past. There are complaints. Who washes dishes, who vacuums? They are subject to discrimination by people! [Can vampires be photographed?] They want to look good when they go to party in town. Vampires remain the same age as when bitten. Can they arrange dates for them? Begone!

He explains their unique organic diet. Then he makes a mess. There is talk about their life. They have preferences for blood. What about food tastes? One man tries to get away. They talk about this life. One comes in through the window; since he can fly he doesnt use the front door. Will he attract attention from neighbors? Their life sucks. They pass werewolves on the street, there is conflict. What if one is a vegetarian? They watch pictures on the Internet and make telephone calls. Next there is a Retirement Village. Did you see Twilight? Does telling people Im a vampire impress them? You shut up! Does Fish and Chips agree with one vampire? A woman complains about housekeeping. Sunlight causes one vampire to combust. Too late. A vampire hunter got into their home! Two woman Police Constables arrive due to complaints from neighbors.

The Constables inspect their home. No smoke detectors? They have complaints about Nick. He is wearing the same style jacket as another. Shame, bad vampire! He is evicted. Months later they get an invitation to a masquerade party. The Beast is the Guest of Honor. One will stay to use the Internet. [On the Internet nobody knows if you are a vampire.] Next we see the attendees of the Unholy Masquerade Ball. Stew tells about his work as a Software Analyst. He is a human! There is conflict. One vampire receives a wooden stake.

Outside there are conflicts with werewolves again. One vampire tells of a problem: all your human friends grow old and deteriorate. Unless they die young. The police arrive and see a body killed by dangerous dogs. Its not good at all. These are happening on a monthly basis. They find a dog to blame. So ends their night. Stew tells what happened to him: he was changed into a werewolf! One finds love at last - to a far younger woman.

Aside from the plot, the dark shadows subtract from this movie. [Symbolism of an old TV show?] You cant see how bad it is! This seems to be made by young men as a school project. I don't recommend watching it, it has no redeeming social value. There are better (and older) horror movies. The Abbott and Costello movies best parody the old horror movies. It takes talent and experience to write a parody of those old horror movies. Or their humor only appeals to their countrymen.",1445904000,2,3058,4.634686346863469

I looked it up to realize it was a mockumentary, and when I recognized Jemaine Clement (From Flight of the Concords) I knew I was in for a fun watch.  This is one of those movies you'll try to talk friends and family into watching, and they will be like ""What the hell are we watching?"" for the first few minutes, and (assuming they have an intelligent sense of humor) will walk away finding their own people to tell about it.

So the movie is a mockumentary set in a world where Vampires aren't a myth, and it deals in all the old-school and traditional vampire myths.  It is supposed to be funny but most of the humor is of the chuckle variety but you'll enjoy it the whole way through.

I remember bits and pieces of my favorite scenes, and immediately I have a smile on my face.  A friend bought it for me as a gift while I was down, and I treasure it -- the perfect pick-me-up, truly.  If you love horror-comedy, and especially vampires, this one's for you!  As for me, I'm a big vampire folklore and literature buff, so all of the little homages found in the movie are boundless.  Jemaine Clement's performance as Vladislav the Poker really makes me forget he ever was ""the Jemaine"" of Flight of the Conchords!  All of the characters are my favorites, I can't tell you which one I love the most, but Viago, played by Taika Waititi, takes the cake as the 18th century dandy vampire of the group, who makes my heart leap whenever he occasionally looks at the camera with a self conscious smile.  Bad boy vampire Deacon (Jonny Brugh) really does prove a guy becomes automatically sexy once he becomes a vampire when he performs an exotic dance for his friends during some down time in between hunting humans.

6986199,5,B00SHJLVWM,"What we do in the Shadows (2014)
 I can't tell you a movie that I have enjoyed more than this comedy romp from New Zealand.  These guys have serious comedy chops.
 Four chums live in a shared flat in Wellington, N.Z.  Their lives are recorded by a film team from a New Zealand documentary crew, much like the film crew in American Zombie.  We never see the crew but there are occasional references to their presence.  They have the usual friction of flatmates over cleaning duties and the like that we might expect.  The difference in their ages complicates things too.  Petyr for instance is 8,000 years old.  The friends are vampires.
 Petyr seems to be modeled on the vampire in the famous silent film era Nosferatu.  He never speaks, he has fangs, a bald head and looks like he could be that old.  He has by far the creepiest look of the flat mates but he supplies a presence rather than a character.
 Jonny Brugh plays Deacon, the youngest of the quartet at 186 years of age.  He is restless and energetic, not to say slovenly.  He hasn't done the dishes in five years, to the dismay of Viago.  Viago became a vampire in the 18th century.  He lived as what they called a 'dandy' in human life.  Even as a vampire he cares much more than the others about tidiness.  Vlad, the last room mate and a very traditional and terrible vampire from the Balkans in the middle ages, mentioned that Viago can be very fussy.  He can be and does.  He admonishes his fellows about getting blood on the furniture, to which Vlad replys Vampires don't use towels!
 When the trio heads out for the evening- Petyr has little to do with the youngsters- they cannot check their going out finery in the mirror, vampires have no reflection, so with careful kindness they help each other to look their best.  This and many other clever insights into vampire life make the film very enjoyable to watch.  Funny too.
 Jemaine Clement, Vlad, and Taika Waititi, Viago, have long collaborated.  They co-wrote and co-directed this film, a first for each.  This is far from their first outing however.  They have each done other jobs in film and TV.  They also worked together in a couple of comedy troupes.  We must think of them as the seasoned pros rather than as first time directors.  They have a wonderful sense of humor and they can and do translate that humor to the screen.  The scene when the vampires, out clubbing for the evening, run into a pack of werewolves just cracked me up.  As did many other scenes.
 Clement and Waititi are both of Maori ancestry.  They not only starred in the film, directed the film, wrote it but they also are among the producers.  They scratched up $1.6 million to make the movie.  The production values are totally up to professional standards.  The make-up on Petyr is particularly impressive.  And these talented film makers made money too!  The movie grossed $7 million at the box office so virtue is indeed rewarded.
 I am not the only fan of this very funny film.  It gathered some 13 awards from New Zealand all the way to Tallinn, Estonia.  It runs for an almost average for a Zombie film one hour and 26 minutes.  It rates a strong R marker for lots bloody bits, most of which are done for a laugh.  I give it an outstanding four brains.",1441756800,,3259,4.486348122866894

6986202,4,B00SHJLVWM,"""What We Do in the Shadows"" is a great deal of fun.

It follows four New Zealand flatmates (Viago, Vlad, Petyr, and Deacon) in the months leading up to a big social event. The kicker is that the social event is for creatures of the night and our flatmates are vampires.

It reminds me in many ways of ""This is Spinal Tap"" in that it is wonderfully straight-faced in its presentation. I found myself laughing out loud in several spots, and quite honestly that's rare. I also found myself unexpectedly feeling sympathy for several of the characters, which I didn't expect.  It is extremely funny, well-written, and well-filmed. A lot of the effects used in the film are practical ones, or a practical/CGI mix. I'll admit, I'm a sucker for practical effects well-used, and they're very definitely well-used here. The costuming and makeup are pretty fantastic as well.

To sum up, I highly recommend this film on many levels. As a fan of vampire fiction and movies, I found it very worth the purchase, and as a fan of comedy, even more so.",1441756800,5,1035,4.639344262295082

6986257,4,B00SHJLVWM,"In a time where Vampires, werewolves, and even zombies are being put through the ""Twilight"" treatment, stripping them of all their terror and replacing it with lukewarm sex appeal, What We Do In The Shadows takes the desiccated husk of all these poor horror icons and injects them with some humorous new life. Instead of making the monsters terrifying or sexy to braindead underage girls, they give them a sense of humanity and a desire to simply live life like us normal, pre-dead average joes.

With talents like Jemaine Clement of Flight of The Conchords in the lead roles, this film is filled with hilarious scenes of blood-sucking, shapeshifting, and in some cases monstrous vampires dealing the the troubles of modern day life. Ever wonder if vampires hate getting blood on the carpet during every meal? Well it's addressed here in hilarious fashion. How does someone who has recently been turned into a vampire essentially ""come out"" to his best friend while addressing the elephant in the room, that many of his new friends want to eat said best friend? You have the best friend introduce the new vampire friends to the wonders of modern technology! Ever wonder what happens when two vampires have an argument? They turn into bats and fight one another.

Simply said, What We Do In The Shadows is a hilarious film brimming with tons of dark humor lightened by the fact that these creatures of the night just want to have a good time and get the rent paid on time.",1440979200,25,1471,4.7421875

6986287,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I was leery of this DVD but now I'm glad I rented it.

In Wellesley, New Zealand, a documentary film crew follows a group of vampire flatmates for a year. In a parody of Big Brother, they film the four as they go about their night-to-night lives, documenting their trolling for victims and their various difficulties of fitting into mortal society: they can't go into night clubs without being invited, how they lure their victims, fighting with ex-lovers and yearning over lost loves, exchanging insults with werewolves, etc. Each one is introduced and a brief bio given, from 8000-year-old Peter, a Nosferatu lookalike to Vlad the Poke who is a mere 800-years-old.

The trouble starts when one victim refuses to stay dead and rises as vampire also. He's so thrilled to be Undead, he goes around telling everyone. No one believes him until he accidentally informs a vampire hunter and trouble begins. The vampire population isn't too thrilled with the news, either, and then, he brings a mortal friend into their midst...

I truly couldn't find anything to complain about with this movie. As I said earlier, I had reservations about watching it because I'd never heard of any of the actors, and usually a movie like this is generally a bomb. I'm glad I took a chance on it because it is by turns, funny, scary, ironic, sarcastic, and above all, entertaining.  It's well-acted, and well-written, and even the documentary, hand-held-type film technique which is generally so irritating, is good.  The illustrations and graphics are works of art in themselves and I imagine a good many horror film fans would love to get their claws...I mean, hands...on some of them. There's blood galore--gouts of it but it's still presented in an exaggerated way that shouldn't turn even the queasiest stomach. Rather, there's pity for the poor minion, given a To-Do list which includes cleaning up the evidence.  Love the kitchen, where the dishes haven't been done in give years!

Which is always bad do to since it often set the bar to high.  at times I laughed out loud and at times i rolled my eyes.  Here's how I think is the best way describe this movie: Think ""The Office""- style mockumentary, with a ""Napoleon Dynamite"" lens for absurdity in everyday mundane-ness.  Add some silliness and vampires and there you have ""What We Do in the Shadows""  If you do not like any one of these film motiffs, I think you will be disappointed.

6986345,5,B00SHJLVWM,"This movie was something that defiantly hit the sweet spots for me. I half-watched it one day after my friend insisted during a drawing session. After that I watched it again with my fianc and, eventually, again with my brother-in-law. It has the feel of a documentary and is quite impressive for being made on a budget of about $8000 or so. The various scenes of vampires in backpacks and ""fight on the ceiling like a man!"" Are done extremely well.  I had no quarrels with the music choices for each and every scene as they knew just how to give it a true humorous or informative feel.

Now, I certainly loved this but you will need to watch out for cussing. It's not excessive but is placed at the proper moments (so it's not an annoyance) but it is still prevelant. Just... Don't watch it with your 13 year old hence the whole ""rated R"" label.

This movie, as you can see from other comments, didn't please everyone. It does have some elements that take time to ramp up and, certainly, isn't as funny as other movies. That being said, if you are gonna watch and compare, then why watch at all?

One of the things I enjoyed the most is using an everyday event or process, for one person or another (if you can make a large stretch on the assimilation and insertion of a non normal humane), to provide a very comical manner of implementing the task/procedure and resultant outcome.

6986480,5,B00SHJLVWM,"Not since ""Napoleon Dynamite"" have I literally watched the same movie twice in a row IMMEDIATELY after viewing.  I laughed sooo hard and enjoyed this so much I simply just had to watch it again pronto!

If you like vampires, humor and Jemain Clement from ""Flight of the Conchords"" fame........ why not mix your pleasures?!

Some of the humor comes in the form of special effects and for what appears to be a low budget film (by Hollywood standards) the effects are not only good but perfect for the humor.  Really, without giving it away the effects are incredible but funny at the same time.

I had my Wife and Daughter watch it with me a third time and I had a great time as did they.  This movie sort of takes a few Vampire types and throws them together as characters sharing a house.  It is very funny watching a modern Dracula-type, Nosferatu-type and classical vampire get into an argument over chores.  And the Awesome ""BAT FIGHT!"" scene is hilarious.

What is interesting to me is that actually I really like serious vampire stories like those by Anne Rice and the like.  Usually parody isn't my thing.  However this caught me completely off guard, and even though I'm a huge supernatural/horror story fan... I walked away laughing and telling all my friends about it.

This movie is nothing like some of the other vampire parodies like the one with Leslie Nielson, or ""love at first bite"".  What we do in the Shadows stands on its own and is really entertaining.  Honestly, I laughed so hard and felt so good afterwards it was like I just got back from a 2 week relaxing vacation.

Some blood gore and violence and sexual content.",1439164800,2,1640,4.568493150684931

6986482,2,B00SHJLVWM,"Watch the trailer. Watch it 3 or 4 times. You have now seen everything funny in this movie. I am not sure what has happened to this world. Maybe Snooki ruined it for us - give a Snooki millions of dollars for saying and doing stupid things. Is that what is wrong? I don't know. I just know that this movie was funny for 20 minutes, then it got really, really old. Perhaps I was expecting too much with the 1100+ reviews. I really wanted to laugh, but then I realized each time I did laugh - it was at a joke from the trailer. DANG! The trailer was free!! and if you are wondering about my Snooki reference (it's not that obvious, I realize), it is that our culture has become a giant reality show - and this movie's premise of reality show style grew old really quickly for me.

Dry humor at times, but humor runs throughout.

If you liked the glittering vampire movies, if you tolerated Dark Shadows... awwwww... it doesn't matter. If you love vampire movies, you'll love this. If you hate vampire movies, this will easily become the one exception.",1438041600,,473,4.827160493827161

I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a fresh take on what supernatural creatures have to do to keep up with the times.  I thought all the characters were funny. This is a movie I will watch again and again.",1437696000,,430,4.195121951219512

6986586,5,B00SHJLVWM,There are not many good movies coming out nowadays. Movies are recycled and viewed again in another form. Finally a movie that someone put thought into.,1437696000,,152,4.884615384615385

6986591,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I came in with high expectations after hearing comedians and critics talk about it on the podcasts I listen to.  I rented it on Amazon and the turned right back around and bought it.  I probably watched it 3 or four times in the fist week.  I guess the style of humor isn't for everybody, but that's comedy.  It fit my sense of humor perfectly.  If you like Flight of the Concords, and similar comedies, or if you like horror that pokes fun at horror, you should LOVE this movie.",1437696000,,479,4.277777777777778

6986599,5,B00SHJLVWM,"This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in recent memory. This film is so smart and quirky that it is hard not to love. It reminds me, in a way, of Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil because it is a smart genre spoof. If you are like me, you may watch this because you are a Flight of the Conchords fan and take any chance you can at seeing New Zealand humor (which is very nearly British - but possibly newer, fresher). I grew up on Monty Python, so this type of comedy is what I usually look for but never find. We are inundated with Melissa McCarthy and Seth McFarlane. These types of comedies can be funny, but they generally go for low-hanging fruit and each ""funny"" attempt they make only gets raunchier or more offensive. Those types of comedies have no staying power. I believe this will be movie that will remain funny for years to come. I HIGHLY recommend picking this movie up.",1437609600,,885,4.242603550295858

6986603,5,B00SHJLVWM,Hands down one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I rented it on Amazon Prime and watched it twice in 24 hours.  I think there are only about 5 movies I've ever seen twice,1437523200,,172,3.8857142857142857
6986604,5,B00SHJLVWM,"This is not you average vampire movie. This is not your average movie period. I laughed so hard wondering who comes up with this stuff. If you saw MTV's the real world you'll recognize the format of the movie but this blows it away. It s a documentary about the life of vampires in a house-share situation and a view into their daily lives. The movie is well made, the plot is ridiculously awesome and the vampires are just perfect. It's cheesy, campy, sweet and messed up all at the same time.",1437523200,,494,4.380434782608695

6986608,3,B00SHJLVWM,At first it seemed funny and original but toward the end it became kind of.. The same jokes and not very well executed. It's funny but you can only take the joke so far and it seemed no fresh point of views came from it.,1437523200,,220,3.911111111111111

6986616,4,B00SHJLVWM,"A hoot and a half, and 4 stars for originality. While this flick does not quite rise to the vampire genre pantheon (as imo does the recent ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE), its take on the toll of modernity is unique and fresh. While the blend of hilarity and gore can be disconcerting, its spin on classic tropes--""the Count"", Nosferatu, Vlad the Impaler-- is inspired.",1437523200,,361,4.65625

6986631,1,B00SHJLVWM,This has to be the stupidest movie I have ever watched the first 20 minutes of. Was it written and filmed by an eight-year-old? I guess I shouldn't have said that. I think an eight-year-old could actually make a better movie. It definitely doesn't deserve the one star I had to give it. Don't bother watching it. It's a complete waste of time.,1437436800,4,343,4.4603174603174605

6986652,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I must admit that, while I was looking through the queue of recent releases to watch on Amazon, I passed on this one a few times. One of the best things that Amazon has that Netflix doesn't is the ability to view a trailer. Finally, once my curiosity was peaked, I had a look at the trailer. While the trailer( as with most trailers these days) gives away some of the film's funniest moments, it doesn't give away all the plot points. This is a quirky and often funny film. It's not laugh out loud funny all the time, but does provide a great deal of little jokes that will make you smile.

Bear in mind, this is NOT an American comedy. I say this simply to warn people that the humor is VERY dry (although it does have a few slapstick moments and lines). If you are a fan of British humor (like the original ""Office"") or ""Flight Of The Conchords"", you will certainly appreciate the subtleties. The humor is found in the mundane existence of these flatmates. They aren't gorgeous or glamorous, as you would find most tv and film vampires in modern culture. These are three average looking guys that are, to the uninitiated, just plain weird.

I watched this as a 48 hour rental here and immediately HAD to buy the blu ray. It is THAT good.",1437350400,2,1239,4.359307359307359
6986653,5,B00SHJLVWM,"Better than ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"", ""22 Jump Street"", and ""The Interview"".  I'm still baffled that so many Hollywood producers turned this movie down given Flight of the Concord's success.  In comedies, sometimes all the best punchlines are given in a preview and you're left with nothing to laugh at once you get to the theatre, but this movie has so much more than what's shown in the previews.  Jemaine and Taika absolutely nailed this movie!",1437350400,,458,4.7
6986654,4,B00SHJLVWM,"It was pretty good. I probably would have liked it more if I hadn't already seen so many clips of the funny parts before I watched the movie. That was my mistake. Like most movies, probablly best to go in not knowing too much about it.",1437264000,,235,4.130434782608695
6986655,1,B00SHJLVWM,"1500 reviews and counting, mostly one word, 5-star reviews.  It's clear that these reviews are being posted by people involved with the making of the film.  This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  It is a low budget (no budget?) home-made movie. Ridiculous (but not the funny kind of ridiculous). Amazon should not allow this kind of manipulation of the review system.  Amazon has allowed hundreds of one word, 5-star reviews, thereby misleading viewers into believing this film isn't terrible.*

6986661,4,B00SHJLVWM,"Basically this movie is a ""mockumentary"" (a la Spinal Tap) where a ""film crew"" follows our vampire friends as they negotiate daily life.  Sort of a ""real vampires of New Zealand"" type show.

One of my internal tests about a movie is -- at what point do I start wondering ""how much longer is this?""  This one, to its credit, I only started wondering about 10 minutes before the end.  So that's why I gave it four stars.  This is a nicely-done movie, but I didn't find it all that hilarious (as others have).  But it was clever.  The film makers had a good grasp of all the vampire legends and, though lampooned, the genre was treated with respect.  It had a lot of good qualities. Though I didn't find it amazing, I was glad I saw it.

warning:  Don't watch the trailer.  I have a habit of not watching trailers because they tend to give away major plot points and, often, the ending.  Since I didn't have a clue what this movie was really like, I did watch this trailer and found, ultimately, that they still make trailers that give away major plot points and the ending.",1437264000,,1071,4.353535353535354

The most brilliant part is that the writers were able to work in so many different aspects of the vampire mythos while also creating a vampire that is unique to this film. Another aspect of brilliance is that these are some pretty awkward vampires who are a bit bad at their jobs. We are so accustomed to seeing movies about the suave vamps, well, these are probably the type of vampires one would normally meet. They dress awkwardly, aren't particularly hot, and when they drink from a victim blood squirts everywhere.",1436400000,,594,4.833333333333333

Just the right amount of effects and all around done right. The humor had me laughing, even when it did get gruesome, nothing freaky, it was done with humor.  Like kids they do sometimes play with their 'food', the food being mortals. I loved the actors, they were good and convincing.

It's been a long long LONG time since I have given a movie 5 stars. I kept hoping it would go longer and longer, that's how good it was for me.
To me it didn't seem low budget, everything was just superb and I'm just a regular movie person. Not into all that movie lingo and dissecting it to pieces.  If you see the trailer, like myself, and are captivated by it, like me - the whole movie is just as good or better than the trailer.  A lotta trailers are just teasers, having all the good bits in that short showing. But this one more than lives up to it.

'Stu' (Stuart Rutherford) and 'Petyr' (Ben Fransham)
This is an off-beat documentary-style Vampire tale -
The Immortals 'Vladislav' 'Viago' 'Deacon' along with 'Petyr' live together, they enjoy each others company, however living in
modern-day New Zealand is a struggle for them.
They don't understand modern technology and don't really get why for appearance sake they should get to grips with every -
''nightly'' chores.
Going out at night to clubs is good, however going out with last-nights blood on your clothing perhaps isn't.
Their conversation doesn't really quite fit-in either, they often arrange for prospective victims to join them at their home, they
sort of offer food and try to entertain them so they feel at ease, then.............
Victim of 'Petyr's' attention 'Mick' now a new recruit doesn't quite get the idea of being a Vampire, not a great idea to tell the
humans they meet up with or indeed to have his human friend 'Stu' tagging along.
A tale of Vampires, the odd Werewolf, and maybe a Vampire Hunter, just adds up to a very different movie experience that
is sure to bring a smile or two along the way.

Its a fun movie, with great low budget special effects.  The wearwolves vs the vampire clan is one of the funnest fights on tv today.  I wish it was a series!",1435363200,,324,4.406779661016949

6986861,5,B00SHJLVWM,"Horror-comedy is probably the toughest genre to get right, so this movie is something special.  The humor is spot on, but the moments of horror and gore are better than almost any ""serious"" horror flick in ages.  There's one sequence with VFX as inventive as Eternal Sunshine or Being John Malkovich.  A new addition alongside Young Frankenstein, Shaun of the Dead and An American Werewolf in London.

6986909,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I cannot give enough praise to this movie. It was funny, fun, and full of detail. I love a movie I can watch over and over and still find little things to pick up on. The movie features four vampires living together in a deteriorating Victorian style house in New Zealand and a lead up to an undead masquerade. The whole thing is shot like a public broadcast documentary, and they really play up the mundane of day to day life for a vampire. Death and gore is abundant, but is less featured than the charming, ridiculous, and well formed characters. This is one I will love for years.",1435017600,,584,4.36697247706422

6986911,2,B00SHJLVWM,I am at a loss to explain the ratings and reviews of this movie. Perhaps they were written by friends and relatives of the cast and production crew? This was a campy and silly little low budget film that shoots for humor but somehow misses the mark more often than not. It was a bit unique in the exploration of its subject matter but certainly wasn't anything I couldn't have lived without seeing. There's really not much to say. If you find yourself really bored one evening you might give this a shot. Its about on the level of the old Munsters TV series.,1434931200,2,558,4.375
6986912,2,B00SHJLVWM,Some funny moments but I really didn't enjoy this movie.,1434931200,,56,4.7

6986914,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I smirked and grinned my way through the entire film, but never outright guffawed.  That pretty much sums it up.  It was enjoyable enough to consider watching again, something I very rarely do for any movie.  The preview does a good job of showing what to expect, a send up of every reality show you've ever seen and putting Vampires in the cast.  There are a few werewolves, witches and zombies too.",1434844800,,400,4.513888888888889

6986944,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I hugely enjoyed ""What we do in the Shadows"". The low budget is cleverly hidden with the mockmentary camera moves.

Some of the humor is subtle and I found that when I watched it a second time, many things that I missed or did not pick up on the first time.

Ftr, I dislike horror films and I had to suck it up for a couple mildly mean & mildly gross moments. But they're vampires. I suppose most of that couldn't be avoided*. when it was done, I ~adored~ all these characters and I was not ready to stop hanging out with them. Also loved the historical references and continued to be entertained by the funny bits for days. I want to flat with Viago. I guess a sequel would be the next best thing. Sequel!

*If the filmmakers are reading along, plotting part two, and taking feedback: the older gent who asks Vlad if he'd like to come inside <--- must say, my heart went out to him. But perhaps he was hypnotized, as Vlad is prone to do, and not just a kind soul as I'd thought. I'll just believe that.",1434499200,,876,4.27710843373494

If you're afraid it will be too gory, don't worry.  The ""gore"" is the over-the-top kind that is too funny to be disturbing.  And there isn't much of it.

But when you understand the concept of dracumentary (no, they don't use that one, but that is the level) of some of the more difficult aspects of vampire life, none of the jokes are really unexpected or of any quality that you would not have thought of yourself if you spent a day thinking about it (or perhaps a couple of hours).  I saw a youtube video of by a young lady (probably high school) of her life with her zombie boyfriend (e.g., the conversation is sort of monotonous:  What do you want to do?  Answer:  huuuh.).  There was about four jokes.  The jokes were no more predictable than in ""What We Do In the Shadows.""  But it was cute for a three minute presentation by a high school student.  ""What We Do In The Shadows"" has greater production values, but considering the underlying talent involved (as there is no doubt that ___ _____ from Flight of the Conchords has comedy talent; see Business Time), the predictability of the gags is, unfortunately, the only thing that is surprising.",1433548800,5,1031,4.590163934426229
6987081,5,B00SHJLVWM,"A documentary crew is given special protection and permission to follow around centuries-old vampires living in post-modern Auckland.

This is high concept and I thought it worked.  The acting was great, the writing was superb, and the situations brilliantly flowed from the premise. The best part of the movie was when the vampires' self-perceptions of youth, sexiness and uber-coolness were confronted by reality.

Actually, the best part was when Stu explained his job as an IT technician to a crowd of vampires, who immediately sensed from his job description that he must be a ""virgin,"" which created a scene because, you know, virgin blood is particularly prized by the deceased-New Zealand community.

Or the part with ""Werewolves, not Swearwolves.""

I wouldn't say that the movie was thigh-slapping, but it was light-hearted and elicited a fair number of guffaws.  So, it's not a waste of your time and money.",1433548800,,917,5.162162162162162

(The guys in here were all perfect in their roles, you actually cared about them, and, had favorites too)
I had no idea what this was, I accidentally stumbled upon it, I watched the trailer, then I hoped that what I was seeing was actually going to happen, a good, funny, and interesting movie about vampires, it didn't let me down. In this day and age of PURE D CRAP on regular T.V. with all of the REALITY shows, this showed them how to do it! For me, this wasn't a laugh out loud type of movie, I mean, yeah, I did, but it was beautiful to watch, it reminded me of the time I stumbled across The Fearless Vampire Killers (TFVK) years ago, I believe that it was the first time it showed on T.V. That movie was funny, for its time, too bad that the TFVK didn't age well, (for me) but this movie should.
Anyway, I seriously think that anyone that has a good sense of humor, and, likes horror movies, this is for them, I HOPE they do more work such as this, maybe not vampires, but something that catches us all off guard.

6987246,5,B00SHJLVWM,"Take one part ""Shaun of the Dead"", mix in three parts ""Waiting for Guffman"", and throw in a dash of ""The Castle"" and you have something approximating this wonderful film. It's a hilarious, on-target mockumentary of the travails of the ""modern vampire"". Four roommates share a house, each roughly an approximation of a character/archetype from vampire culture, and have to deal with the annoyance of daily undeath. You know, the bloody dishes that pile up in the sink, the annoying friend who keeps telling everybody he's a vampire (""You know Twilight? That was based on me.""), the roving pack of werewolves (a bit smelly, but otherwise all right), trying to decide where to hang out, and so on.

The poster for this movie put me off. I'm glad I saw it after all, because this was brilliant on-target humor, with nary a flat joke to be found.

The vamps worry about their appearance (it's hard to judge what to wear when you have no reflection in a mirror), keeping blood stains off the white sofa (put down newspaper before biting), and who is going to do the dishes.

It was witty, and haves humour and makes you want to rewatch again(mostly beginning til mid, it gets kinda bleak in the end, but still worth watchin), the cast is  really good, jemaine n taika who plays as the main roles and directed and produce this, know what they're doing and know how to deliver their vision, it makes you smile kine laugh, cause its like, ""of course, how could I have not known that or thats soo true"" type funny, its good all around, it gets kinda nowhere with the masquerade, but don't expect much but just let it be, and pretend your actually watchin a documentary of vampires, instead of looking for the plot or laughs, its funny don't get me wrong, but its not to me a burst out laugh out loud,  if that is what you're expecting,  but its more of a blended out really well laugh out smiling crack up, if that makes sense. Well I defiantly will have this in my movie collection, its fun to quote the spaghetti part, its fun after you watched the movie to recap on and laugh in your mind of, idk lol, well thats all I can say, if you're in a mood to watch something and you cant think of anything...pick this, also it kinda alil bit reminds me of ""Shawn of the dead"" type filmy film but a kiwi sense, its good good and I support it and its brilliance to think out the jokes its mocking, lol, its very thought out and thats something to appreciate aswel with its other attributes to enjoy the film. : )",1432080000,,2220,4.268408551068884

6987379,5,B00SHJLVWM,"I was truly surprised by the number of times I laughed during this quirky, well-written, surprisingly high-quality film. The mood of the film is quite campy, and the humor has much more to do with the presentation of the interesting characters than it does with a coherent plot. In fact, there really is no plot per se. It's just a mockumentary that follows the flatmates through some of their domestic happenings over a period of several months leading up to a fairly arbitrary ending point--the ""unholy masquerade"". However, the presentation is done so well and the little snippets of these characters' lives are so humorous that the film is quite successful and you will probably finding yourself repeating several of the humorous lines among friends.

I was also really impressed with the decor and the special effects--which, granted, were used minimally and often selectively to obtain the campy feel of the movie.",1431734400,,920,5.052631578947368

The best bits are the quiet, embarrassed glances at the camera, and the over-the-top Bela Lugosi accents that the characters adopt.  Laughed out loud at the boys (they all are ""flatmates"" in New Zealand) drawing pictures of each others costumes, before going out clubbing... because they have no reflection.

The film quality, audio, sets and makeup are fine. Most of the costumes are good but some are just silly (not a funny silly).

I just finished the movie and I never cracked a smile. I have no idea how it won so many awards. I found parts interesting enough to finish the movie they weren't funny, just oddly interesting.

I don't recall any cursing. The nudity scenes had blurring.

So why did I give it 3 stars. Because I am a fair person. It's my fault I only relied upon a few reviews and I did not find another trailer before renting so it gets 3 stars.

6987556,5,B00SHJLVWM,"Set in modern day Wellington (New Zealand) we meet a house share of vampires. They are all rather old but Nosferatu `look alike' Petyr is absolutely ancient. The marvellous Jemaine Clement plays Vladislav a love and care worn vamp. The narrator of the hose is a more spritely Viago who escorts our documentary film crew around the house and lives of his nocturnal chums.

This  film crew will be given access to hitherto unseen aspects of vampire life. This will include social life and the misery of night living, not being able to see your reflection and having to do the washing up.  We also get to meet a group or rather pack of Werewolves who have a sort of love - hate relationship with `the children of the night'.

Now this is played for laughs and it really gets them; the existential angst of being dead and the chore of getting your `fix' are all done with an eye for the funny. The acting is perfectly hammed up when it needs to be with location shooting that adds to the documentary pretence of the whole thing. Even the SFX are brilliant.

6987565,4,B00SHJLVWM,"How do four bachelor vampires make do in Wellington, New Zealand in the twenty-first century? This mockumentary, written and directed by Jemaine Clement (best known for Flight of the Concords) and Taika Waititi, answers the question with a wonderfully creative take on many of the tropes of the genre.

The four vampires in question represent some of the main vampire archetypes: the European dandy, the rebel ""youth,"" the warrior  a gag on Vlad the Impaler, and the ancient. They live together in relative harmony as they navigate the choppy waters of assigning chores, finding victims with the assistance of a human servant, and trying to get access to the best clubs when they can only enter on the invitation of a human. When one of them accidentally turns a victim into a new vampire, things get even more complicated. Add in ornery ex-lovers and werewolf rivalries, and there's a lot of fun fodder to work with.

With that said, although the film is relatively short at under 90 minutes, it still could have benefited from more editing and better pacing. The effect of the movie is diluted, particularly in the middle and third quarter, by jokes that have run their course.

A special mention has to go to the Nosferatu-like 8,000-year old vampire who is strangely endearing and always scene-stealing even when he does nothing more than hiss. The film is worth watching for him alone.",1427328000,,1390,4.877118644067797

I admit, it tries to rise above itself - the Nosferatu reference, although broad, suggests that someone did a little homework. And some of the tropes of the genre - the acolyte, willing to do what it takes for eternal life - translates well into modern terms. And that bit of hope for rapprochement between sworn foes - well, the agent that brings it about calls out to the nebbish in all of us. (Me, at least.)

6987572,4,B00SHJLVWM,"A New Zealand film that does a great job of character driven humour but somewhat lacks an overall storyline.  What We Do in the Shadows certainly highlights the reality as to what life as a suburban vampire would actually probably be like such as facing the same annoyances we humans do such as roommates who have a different standard of cleanliness, some don't pull their weight such as doing the dishes and the normal conflicts you have when sharing a house.  It also ridicules the pretty boy mortal woman throw themselves at you ridiculousness of True Blood, Twilight and well most other portrayals of vampire men with these guys being pretty average looking at best, and not being able to get into nightclubs much as the bouncers choosing who can enter don't invite them inside.

It is filmed in a handheld home video style, usually seen these days as found footage films, but the style actually works for this one as believable documentary look into the everyday lives of a group of undead housemates living in suburban Wellington. Shaky unprofessional look might not be for everyone's tastes but it does add an authenticity to the mockumentary.  Although the characters are well written and this is certainly a very unique addition to the very saturated vampire movie genre, I found I was happy with the characters but was just waiting for something movie storyline wise to happen that never really did.  So it was more like a giant skit than a movie.

New Zealand has delivered some pretty unique horror films in 2015, you definitely should also check out a brilliant film called Housebound, which adds its own spin to the often told haunted house tale.",1426377600,2,1660,4.807017543859649

6987575,4,B00SHJLVWM,"WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is a blast.  It's a low-budget spoof of low-budget reality shows (including shaky, hand-held camerwork, spotty lighting and questionable zooming) and it focuses on a group of room-mates who happen to be vampires.  The concept is amusing, and for the most part, the execution is excellent.  The film is a bit of a one-joke wonder...but these guys have found every variation of the joke/conceit, and made them work.

We're introduced to four vampires, sharing a ramshackle house in Wellington, New Zealand.  Part of what was amusing is that the vampires come from various parts of the world, and are given outrageous accents...none of which are New Zealand.  You've got the old-school Dracula-like vampire from Romania (or thereabouts), a decadent play-boyish type (or at least playboy wannabe) who reminds me of a sleazy, greasy, less suave & attractive version of Eric from TRUE BLOOD.  Then there's the European dandy, who is relatively new to being a vampire and still pines for his long-lost human love. Finally, and to me, funniest of alltheres Peter, the VERY ancient vampire who looks just like Nosferatu from the silent film days.  This vampire only hisses, he cannot speak, but hes one of the best sightgags Ive seen in awhile.

Much of the movie just shows these roommates squabbling, grappling with petty vampire problems and looking for a party.  Their immortality has rendered them indifferent to housework and easily bored.  As any full-length one-joke movie must do, eventually some plot is introduced as a brand-new vampire is introduced to the mix and the group must grapple with the training and responsibility for this insolent newbie.  Complications ensue.
The movie is just under 90 minutes long, but Ill admit that it occasionally feels stretched.  Inevitably, the joke must grow a little thin, and once in awhile, I felt that thinness.  What keeps the movie fun 97% of the time is the characters.  We actually grow to take an interest in these guys, and there are a few genuinely touching moments by the end.
The film does show some blood, but it is only graphic enough to remind us that were dealing with vampires.  It doesnt dwell on the violence, but you never feel its shying away.  The language can be rough, and overall, this is not a movie for kids.
This little film, which few will see, turns out to be a delightful, engaging and frequently hilarious surprise.",1425945600,36,2416,4.896805896805897

It seems like it's constantly right on the verge of doing something really hilarious, but can't quite flip the switch. The landscape is ripe for this kind of a satire, too, with so much empty romanticism hovering around the fantasy genre. Most of the fun comes from picking apart the hallmarks of the bloodsucker game, exposing them for the lame parlor tricks and absurd handicaps they really are. Mystically swapping a plate of noodles for worms, for example, to the mild annoyance of the victim. Failing to enter a nightclub because the bouncer doesn't explicitly invite them in. In most films, these would be appetizers for the main entree, but in this case there's no second course. This would've made for a brilliant skit on a sketch comedy show, but it just doesn't have the depth for its own feature-length. Even a very short one.",1425254400,4,981,4.845238095238095
6987577,5,B00SHJLVWM,"The level of hilarity in the New Zealand vampire comedy What We Do in the Shadows is almost unfathomable.  Spearheaded by Flight of the Conchords musical parodist Jemaine Clement and frequent collaborator Taika Waititi, the film is, beat for beat, one-liner for one-liner, set piece for set piece, one of the zaniest, most inspired, and most amusing comedies in recent memory.  The informal, improvisation-inviting storyline revolves around a documentary crew who, promised safety and adorned with crucifixes, film the day-to-day lives of four vampires ranging in age from a fresh-faced century to 8,000 years.  Whether going for the juvenile jugulara month-old vampire samples a plate of french fries and projectile vomits bloodor playing a more subtle and tender comic notethe undead flatmates are at once intrigued and mystified by the ever-changing technological world around themthe film is perfectly calibrated and performed with the utmost exuberance.  And it has an enormous amount of fun deconstructing and referencing popular culture's vampire mythology, shaped as it is by, among others, Blade, Nosferatu, and Twilight.  (It is hard to get into a nightclub when the bouncer must invite you in!)  All in all, this is a unique and delectable gem destined to find a place alongside such beloved genre-blending pictures as Evil Dead II and Shaun of the Dead.",1425168000,2,1365,5.325581395348837
6987578,5,B00SHJLVWM,"What this comedy lacks in budget is more than made up for with its ingenious writing. This is a group of characters consisting of individuals who are completely different from one another. Viago is old fashioned and meticulous, Deacon is rebellious and spontaneous, Vladislav is perverted and out of his element, Petyr is like this prehistoric fossil of the evolution of vampires over the years, and Nick is so overcome with the thrill of becoming a vampire that he lets that shout over reasoning and logic. Everyone is drawn to Stu because he's soft spoken, mild mannered, and easy to get along with. There's also Jackie (Jackie van Beek), Deacon's servant who is persistent about Deacon finally making her immortal.

The film juggles the documentary aspect, vampire humor, horror homage, and clever comedy quite well. Playing with selecting a victim, draining their blood, hypnotism, and not having reflections is something the film has fine-tuned to perfection. It's even able to take soft jabs at werewolves and zombies in legitimately humorous fashion. The humor is more of a tribute to the source material than a flat out mockery, which is one of the reasons the film is so enjoyable. The ""dark bidding"" bit may be the crown jewel of ""What We Do in the Shadows,"" but accidentally biting the main artery, a bat fight, and attempting to eat human food are also quite hysterical.

According to most folklore relating to vampires, they cannot be photographed. ""What We Do in the Shadows"" completely ignores this little detail and allows snapshots of these eccentric characters to be taken at every turn. It doesn't really tie into how entertaining the film is, but it's just an odd detail to alter since so much time is given to absent reflections and how to get ready for a night on the town without one.

The only flaw ""What We Do in the Shadows"" could possibly have is that it ends prematurely. The characters are so much fun to be around that you could easily spend more than three hours soaking in their wild antics, which saddens you greatly when the film ends after a mere 86 minutes. Superbly written with sharp, on the cuff humor, fantastic characters, and a well-polished story completely in tune with its source material, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" is an uproarious horror comedy that's every bit as funny as ""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Tucker and Dale vs Evil,"" and ""Zombieland.""",1424995200,5,2388,4.819512195121951

To date, I've seen it 10 times and loved it every time and I'm not one to watch things over and over again. There are such clever subtleties that I notice each time I watch it that I hadn't seen the previous times (take notice of the actual name of the building where the Unholy Masquerade is held). They cover the day-to-day experiences we might all share, both humans and the undead, like doing dishes, but in a way that you'd imagine vampires would. Even they hate to wash the bloody things!

6987582,4,B00SHJLVWM,"What We Do in the Shadows is a comedy horror from New Zealand, written and directed by Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement. They also star in this reality TV style mockumentary about four vampire roommates  379-year-old Viago (Waititi), 862-year-old Vladislav (Clement), 183-year-old Deacon (Jonathan Brugh) and 8,000-year-old Petyr (Ben Fransham), who looks like Nosferatu  all living together in an old house in the quiet Wellington suburb.

Their mundane life (including bickering over who should wash the dishes) suddenly changes when a new member Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) arrives, with his best friend, and still human, Stu (Stu Rutherford) in tow. Stu happens to be a computer programmer, so he shows these vampires the new technology including YouTube.

What We Do in the Shadows is very silly and genre-conscious at the same time, making fun of the conventions of reality TV shows and vampire movies. The overall tone of the comedy horror reminds us of that of Peter Jacksons earlier films, though the film itself is less gory and violent.

Some people die here as after all this is a comedy HORROR, but don't take the film too seriously. With fine acting (especially from Taika Waititi as a foppish vampire), off-the-wall humor and surprisingly effective visual tricks, What We Do in the Shadows is an entertaining comedy.",1424044800,5,1332,5.176744186046512

6987584,4,B00SHJLVWM,"It's always been hard being a vampire, what with peasant mobs with torches and pitchforks, damp castles, the odd vampire hunter. But it's even harder when you're trying to live a semi-normal unlife in modern times.

And those vampiric woes are the subject of ""What We Do In The Shadows,"" a delightful little mockumentary about vampire roommates in modern New Zealand. Director/actors Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement poke fun at vampire tropes and cliches in a sly, wickedly funny manner (""You know, they don't even wear shirts! They wear blouses!""), while also having a fairly likable ring of bloodsuckers dealing with comical woes (having to be invited into bars), and manages to actually be rather heartwarming at times.

It follows a group of four vampires sharing a rented house in a Wellington suburb -- Nosferatu-like Petyr (Ben Fransham), who is eight thousand years old and never talks; Viago (Taika Waititi), a romantic vampire with a streak of bad luck; Vladislav (Jemaine Clement), a wild medieval vampire once known as ""Vlad the Poker""; and Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), a wild younger vampire who likes to knit.

They have a fairly normal life for flatmates -- they bicker over chores, get dressed every night (despite the lack of reflection), trash-talk with werewolves, and go out on the town for victims. Of course, they have problems getting into bars without being invited, but if necessary they hang out at a club for vampires. And whenever possible, Deacon's long-suffering human servant Jackie (Jackie Van Beek) brings people by for them to feed ""pisghetti"" and then suck the blood from -- including her unfortunate ex-boyfriend Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer).

When Petyr randomly decides to turn Nick into a vampire, he turns out to be a boon to his new friends. He teaches them about the Internet and modern technology, and introduces them to his human friend Stu (Stu Rutherford). But after Nick's loose lips lead to tragedy, the other vampires are forced to exile him from their house. And when the annual masquerade ball for the undead (including zombies, vampires and banshees) rolls around, the vampires find themselves having a really crazy confrontation with shocking consequences.

""What We Do In The Shadows"" could be seen as a clever parody of many urban fantasy cliches, where vampires live in dens of luxury and elegance. These vampires live in a grotty suburban house where they never do dishes or put away towels, wear wacky ensembles stolen from their victims, and drinking blood can get really disgusting. Not to mention their battles with werewolves are more about mutual trash-talking and insults than actual fighting (but are STILL more dignified and interesting than anything in ""Twilight"").

A lot of the charm is simply that Waititi and Clement are gently mocking all the vampire cliches, from the vampire who falls in love with a mortal to the hypnotic mind powers (""How does it feel to have a snake for a penis?""). Scenes that would be scary in a serious movie end up being pretty hilarious instead, such as Viago's attempts to drink blood from a victim... only to get soaked when he accidentally hits an artery. Or when Nick is chased through the house by the various vampires, who just sort of float around making hissy noises and occasionally bursting out of his backpack.

But despite all the wackiness, there are some touching moments. Viago spends most of the movie moping after his lost love (his human servant put the wrong postage on his coffin, and he spent a few years in mail limbo), and Deacon gives a rather sweet, rambling speech about the loss of loved ones when you're immortal. Well, despite some odd examples of how people can die (""Or making the simple mistake of fashioning a mask out of crackers and being attacked by ducks..."").

There's not really a solid plot until the final quarter of the movie; until then, it's just sort of following these vampires as they explore the world of the undead, which is less glamorous than you'd expect. The dialogue is gloriously funny, such as the werewolves preparing to chain themselves to trees for the full moon (""Those jeans are gonna rip completely!"") or the vampiric reasons for liking virgin blood (""If you're going to eat a sandwich, you will just enjoy it more if you knew no one had ****ed it"").

And of course, all the actors do solid jobs here -- Waititi is quite endearing as a sort of romantic dork who still pines after his now-elderly love, occasionally putting on a silver locket that will set him on fire. Brugh and Gonzalez-Macuer do pretty good jobs as the young, unpredictable slacker-type vampires. Fransham does a pretty good job for a guy who never speaks around his mouthful of prosthetic teeth. And Jemaine Clement steals the show as a Vlad Tepes-style tyrant who hasn't quite adjusted to the modern age, and likes to use his power for intimidation... with mixed results. The sight of a cat with Jemaine Clement's face is both horrifying and hilarious.

""What We Do In The Shadows"" is a charming little vampire comedy -- not much of an internal arc until the last fourth, but the clever script, mockery of vampire cliches and the gang of endearing bloodsuckers make it delightful. Fangtastic.",1423267200,93,5221,4.9026047565118915

It's like Flight of the Conchords meets every vampire trope imaginable (even Twilight!), with irresistibly dry New Zealand wit.  I won't hesitate to buy this the minute it comes out!",1423094400,,329,4.945454545454545

Great comedic perspective and acting made this one of the best movies we've seen in a long time.  Needless to say, her mood did a 180 and we had a great day.",1534550400,,260,3.8679245283018866
