1858274,2,B00008R9M2,"Borderline is a whodunit with a slight twist - the ex-husband of a Psychiatrist (at a prison for the criminally insane) is murdered and the question is ""Did she do it or did one of her ex-patients do it, or did she get one of her ex-patients to do it, or ???"" Gina Gershon (1962) stars as the Psychiatrist. She is probably best known as the bisexual showgirl from ""Showgirls"" (1995) and as the lesbian from ""Bound"" (1996).

Handsome Michael Biehn (1956) plays a detective who is dating Gershon. He's probably best known for his roles in James Cameron's films as Kyle Reese in ""Terminator"" (1984), as good natured Cpl. Hicks  in ""Aliens"" (1986), and Lt. Coffey in ""The Abyss"" (1989). But I liked him best as the psycho Johnny Ringo in ""Tombstone"" (1993).

Sean Patrick Flanery (1965) plays the patient. Flanery is probably best known for his ""Boondock Saints"" films (1999, 2009) and for his starring role in ""Powder"" (1995).

Flanery is excellent as the ex-patient. Unfortunately Gershon, for all her acting talent, isn't convincing as a Psychiatrist, and Michael Biehn, one of my favorite actors, does nothing special.

A film like this depends on the script and the direction to keep us guessing, but both of these elements are a little lacking to make this a first rate film.",1311552000,,1277,4.760180995475113
1858275,5,B00008R9M2,"I just finished watching this movie and I was very intrigued by it. Sean Patrick Flanery is outstanding as a former mental patient in love with his therapist. Michael Biehn is believable as the new boyfriend/cop out in the middle of this Who-Done-It murder. Gina Gershon is great as the woman who wants custody of her daughers after a divorce. The movie runs sure and steady all the way. If you are a fan of any of the three major player or of thrillers in general, watch this movie.",1310688000,,483,4.438202247191011
1858276,3,B00008R9M2,"I saw this movie once and even though Gina Gershon did ok, I thought Michael Biehn was the better actor.  He is 52 years old now (he was born on July 31, 1956 in Anniston, Alabama).  I agree with the person who wrote about Gina Gershon's pout.  I saw her in the movie ""Showgirls"" with Elizabeth Berkley and I think she did better in that movie than in any other movie I've seen her in. Michael Biehn plays a cop in Borderline and his character is Gina's character's ""lover"" (at least thats what it looked like to me when I saw this movie on TV. I gave Borderline 3 stars only because Michael Biehn is in this movie. As soon as I can afford to get it, I'm going to buy this movie to add to my already growing collection of Michael Biehn movies (I'm rebuilding my collection because my original MB collection was stolen a few years ago).",1228780800,,835,4.238993710691824
1858277,3,B00008R9M2,"I am a BIG fan of Michael Biehn, since I first saw him in ""Teminator."" Ever since then I look forward to any movie or tv series he is in. Now...as for ""Borderline"" this is not a great movie. It drags,it is not well written, and some of it...well.....just does not work for me. But...I am adding a star because they(the Producers, etc) had the good brains to have Michael Biehn in it. But his talents are wasted in this part. Not enough of him in the movie to save it, really. I am not a big Gina Gershon fan. I think she needs lots more acting lessons. I get tired of her ""pout"" and she uses it alot in this movie.  As for Sean Patrick Flanery....he needs more acting lessons too. But I cannot fault him too much as his part was not well written at all. Never defined. As a matter of fact, none of the characters are well defined in this movie. You have to guess as to their motives, etc. But I do give it 3 stars and do mildly recommend it and if you are a Michael Biehn fan, like me, then I do recommend your seeing it as one of his latest endeavors. He is getting older....55 plus now, and good parts are hard to find for him.. sad to say. See him in  TV Series...""The Magnificent Seven"" and you will not be sorry. That is one of the Very Best TV shows I have ever had on DVD. I have both seasons. Sorry they did not make a third or forth as it was Everything that ""Borderline"" is not. Well written, Well Acted...and Very memorable, even if you are not a western fan. And an added plus...Dale Midkiff. Another underated actor who deserves better movie parts. But did find this TV series, thank goodness.",1189382400,5,1606,4.160771704180064
1858278,1,B00008R9M2,"Gina Gershon is one of the best actresses around now and usually makes really good choices of movies.  This one wasn't a good choice.  The acting, other than Gina, is horrid - although this isn't one of Gina's shining moments.  The writing is so much worse than the acting - a 12 year old could have come up with better lines.  The end teases a twist but then takes it away and just ends.  There are a few too many loose ends that I would have liked to have seen tied up but we all can't have everything.  If you're looking for a good Gina Gershon movieor a good thriller don't pick this one.",1149120000,7,592,4.149122807017544
1858279,4,B00008R9M2,"Gina Gershon is my favorite,modern day actress,who is to often given inferior scripts and roles where she usually is cast as a gorgeous, sexy,and (often dangerous)lady. While I certainly don't mind GINA ""strutting her stuff"",I do wish Hollywood would give her better roles. In ""Lies and Whispers"" she is smart,touching,and sexy,an oustanding performance,I wish she would be given more multi-dimensional roles. I think she would be GREAT in comedy,which when given the opportunity she delivers tart lines in the best Joan Blondell-Ann Sheridan tradition.

 In ""Boderline"" she is a loving mother of two girls, but is caught in a nasty custody battle with ex-husband,and she has recurring nightmares,from her childhood,which has left her with terrible mental scars. When here ex-husband and his girlfriend are brutally murdered GINA is the number one (1) suspect and put under more mental pressure. GINAs' performance is what raises this film to a 4-star level. She handles her role with tenderness, warmth,and just the right amout of mental anguish. Please, Hollywood do justice to GINAs' talents and give her the roles she (and her fans) deserve.

 The supporting cast includes Sean Patrick Flannery,Michael Biehn,and from the original ""DAMN YANKEES"",Rea Allen,as a symphatic friend of Ginas'is fine.",1148169600,7,1299,5.447761194029851
1858280,5,B00008R9M2,"Gina Gershon has never been best. She makes the sixty % in this film. She deserves major opportunities and I expect this film adds the expected desire in future projects.
Sean Patrick Flannery is a young promise and makes a credible role.
The script works out with organical flow . There are innovative situations that keep your attention and hold to your seat. The increasing mistery slowly goes involving you to a satisfactory ending.
The direction is another positive point to remark.
A little gem that might become in a status cult movie . In my opinion this film got it!",1087344000,7,575,4.702970297029703

7986365,3,B00008R9M2,"A psychiatrist who works in a prison loses custody of her kids, it's not long before her ex and his new wife are raped with a broken bottle and murdered.  But was this just a happy coincidence of a break in gone wrong for the psychiatrist, or did she do it herself?  Did she plan it and get someone else to do it?  Or did one of her patients now out on parole who all seem to love her, do it as it was the right thing to do so she could get her kids back?

This movie had a lot of faults, and certainly wasn't very believable, but it did have the I'm not quite sure who killed the ex and his wife for the duration of the film factor going on.  When that is a factor, you can't do anything but rate it five stars. Except for, when the film ends, and you still have no idea.  Both main suspects at this stage swear it is the other person. So hence you're pretty dissatisfied when you eject the DVD from your player.

This is a low budget movie.  The prison for one with its interior shots look like it was shot in an office building.  But you don't need a large budget to tell this tale so that doesn't matter to any great extent.  It's the writing that lets it down.  Some spoilers - How dumb are the cops?  You'd think the first thing you'd do is search the house for the intruder, yet they don't find two girls hiding under some clothes.  They also let the mother (the spouse or ex is always your first suspect) contaminate the murder scene and just walk wherever she wants calling her daughters' names.  One of the cops even starts sleeping with her, his boss finds out yet, he's still on the case.  I'm pretty sure in the case of a murder investigation, someone doesn't get part of the victim's estate until it's over.  Especially if they're are a suspect and even charged with the crime.  as if you murder someone you can't profit from your crime by still being in the will. There's no way she'd be able to sell his house to pay her bail.  Can you really ring someone from prison without it going through an operator?  I would have no idea but I hope not.  Why was she wearing makeup in prison?  Can you really visit someone in prison by giving a fake name, surely you have to show ID?

I also found it weird that they cast two actors who look pretty similar and even had the same haircuts as the cop and a parole.  When these two had a fight and were rolling on top of each other I didn't know who was who.  But as I said it's disappointing that we don't know who killed the ex and his wife.  I think it was her simply because when we see the murders the kids are surprised someone is there but not afraid, they also likely would have come out of hiding when the cops arrived unless they were instructed not to emerge before the mother reappeared, but the movie doesn't tell me if I'm correct so hence it only rates three stars.",1477094400,,2833,4.125912408759124
