784711,1,6304118937,I regret letting my kids see this. Need to work with my 4-year old boy to unlearn some of the words from the movie.,1511308800,,115,3.8333333333333335

784713,4,6304118937,"Let's discuss the product first; which is an extremely basic Blu-Ray, lacking any and all special features save for the movie trailer. I'm not an expert on picture quality, but the film and audio seemed to be standard Blu-Ray quality.

As far as the film goes, it's lost between being a loving homage to the original vision and a standard PG joke fest complete with double entendre and bathroom jokes. Personally, I would have preferred a full G rating with more emphasis on capturing the spirit of Our Gang.

What's missing? The illusion of real friendship. The movie suffers from a severe lack of chemistry between the lead buddies, Spanky and Alfalfa. Throughout the film it's difficult to believe that these two children are best friends. A much better job is done with the characters of Porky and Buckwheat; it's too bad all the casting wasn't better.

On the topic of casting, certain roles overall seem wasted. I hate to critique children so harshly, but the lackluster performance of Spanky, Stymie and Darla truly heightens the admiration I hold for the raw talent of the original actors! The most noticeable is Darla, who might have been cast solely based on appearance. This is an odd shame when one remembers how well the original Darla could sing, dance and act with a good degree of comic timing.

Basically, if you enjoy the Little Rascals and keep an open mind, you should enjoy watching the classic gags being updated. Just try not to judge this Rascal crew too harshly; there was only one George McFarlane after all!",1508112000,,1534,4.777358490566038

785844,3,6304118937,"Well, first of all. I really didn't expected this.
Most of the story didn't worked for me.
The kids pretend to be adults really was not what I wanted to see. I expected something like cute kids acting what they really are not pretending they are adults.
I bet that the kid actors didn't even knew what they were doing whille they were acting when they were talking about politicts and stuff.
The only thing it was truely funny was when these boys pretend they were girls and wore angel clothes and running away chased by girls. That was the only truely funny moment from the movie.
Other then that, I thought this movie was just a forged by the adults for adult audience, not for kids.",1452556800,,685,4.4015748031496065

My view is it doesn't translate well to the current day and age.  See the AV Club interview with Penelope Spheeris from 1999.

786451,3,6304118937,"Watched this one the other night. I have seen it plenty of times to be able to quote most of the movie. It's a silly remake of the original 1930 shorts for kids of the 90s. The child actors are all pretty decent and there are a lot of good adult cameos (mel brooks, lea thompson, donald trump, whoopi goldburg, reba macintire). The movie is a little raunchier than I remember, but nothing too risque.

I do have to say that this blu ray release is quite dismal. There are no special features - deleted scenes, outtakes, behind the scenes, actor interviews, etc. There isn't even a director commentary. Those are usually a given. I also felt that the image was really soft for a HD movie. The detail doesn't really pop, at least not to me.

Still a good movie form my childhood despite the flaws. Worth checking out on the cheap",1437696000,,827,4.398692810457517

787362,5,6304118937,"Grew up on this film and practically know the whole thing by heart.  The acting is actually very good amongst the loveable characters.
So many one-liners from this thing, one of which is the classic ""We got a dollar!"" duet between Buckwheat and Porky.

Kids will love the antics and adults will appreciate the solid dialogue too.  Not to mention the guest appearances!  You'll be surprised at who randomly shows up (here's lookin' at you, Donald Trump).

Have a look into the internet-lacking past when kids spent their days with their buddies in the He-Man Woman Haters Clubhouse.  You'll be glad you did.  Another of my favorite lines: ""You only make a once-in-a-lifetime friend....once in a lifetime.""",1424131200,,704,4.965811965811966

787367,4,6304118937,"I suppose the ob-vi-ous thing about this movie is that it is NOT original.
It's a, COLOR, 5.1-surround-sound, faux-simile of an 80-year-old, classic,
series of short-subjects.
THAT said, I enjoyed this anyway. I'm 66, and bought it for myself. The
ONLY fault I don't understand is why 9 or 10-year-old Alfalfa and Waldo
were smitten over a ---what?--- six-year-old Darla.
I'll leave t-h-a-t there. Otherwise, this was quite entertaining... if you
remember a FARCE is not supposed to depict reality... maybe I shouldn't
worry about an age difference. MY wife is seven years younger than me...
but, I'm NOT in school... maybe I should check my brain at the door, and,
just hit PLAY!",1422748800,,680,4.973684210526316

Unfortunately the theatrical cut is not presented here instead we get a home video cut that removes several scenes.
Universal only allows the theatrical cut to air on ABC Family (facepalm)

788483,4,6304118937,"I purchased this from Bull Moose at Midnight on July 1st, took it home, put it in, and started watching it. Universal Studios got the sound on the English and French tracks messed up. All the sound effects and music are in surround sound like they are supposed to be but the characters voices when they talk are supposed to be in the center but somehow they got put in the left channel and it drives me nuts. If Universal Studios did this on purpose, I don't understand what they were thinking. The DVD has the voices correctly placed in the center were the dialog is supposed to be but the blu-ray has the main dialog in the left channel only for the entire film. Because of this I cannot give the film five stars. I will try to contact Universal and ask them if this was done on purpose or if this is a glitch in the encoding of the sound on the blu-ray disc. Other than that, the film looks stunningly clear and shines on blu-ray. I can give the film picture quality five stars but not the sound.",1404086400,,999,4.2356020942408374

788694,1,6304118937,"I related to the ""old little rascals"" from years ago. This seemed like a great gift for the grand kids. And no I did not preview it...I just assumed. The movie has more sophisticated daring schemes and scenes and was in my opinion created for adults as well as kids to watch and enjoy. Perhaps older children say 9-10 years and up would be able to enjoy the humor without copying the behaviors and language. My little cherubs soaked it up and spewed it out over and over. This film lacks some guidelines for appropriateness and is better not shown to a younger age group.",1388102400,,571,4.447619047619048

788823,5,6304118937,"There are few films that bring me as much boyish delight as watching `The Little Rascals', a flawlessly modernized look at one of the greatest children's shows of all time.  `Spanky and Our Gang' was one of those timeless shows that really captured the joyousness of childhood innocence, and really none of that is lost in the transference from the small screen to the big screen.  This simply constructed plot flourishes under playful direction and a cast of natural talents who bring these loveable characters to life with fantastic results.  The action is exciting, the romance is believable and the core theme of friendship, loyalty and the ode to never growing up makes for one of the funnest children's movies released in the 90's.",1381276800,,737,4.92741935483871

They did a great job casting the kids too.  It's one of those movies that you curl up with on a rainy Saturday afternoon and just enjoy from start to finish.

789314,5,6304118937,"The Little Rascals is a 1994 family-comedy feature film directed by Penelope Spheeris(Wayne's World, The Beverly Hillbillies)that is based on the classic and legendary 1937-1944 MGM/Hal Roach Little Rascals/Our Gang movie shorts. In this remake, the Rascals are members of the He-Man Womun Haterz Club and they are mortified to find out that Alfalfa is breaking the rules by being a sweetheart to Darla. However, they have new troubles that are abound as their arch-bullies Butch and Woim are planning to steal the Rascals' prize go-kart and Alfalfa has a new rival in Waldo, who is vying to win Darla's heart. The celebrity cameos by Whoopi Goldberg(Theodore Rex, The View), Reba McEntire(Reba, Tremors), Darryl Hannah(Splash, Kill Bill), George Wendt(Cheers), Mel Brooks(Blazing Saddles), and the laughing stock of the Republican Party, reality TV trainwreck Donald Trump(The Apprentice)was one the highlights of the movie. Spheeris does a wonderful job casting young child actors, most of them new to acting. And to have them resemble to the original Rascals was pure genius. The Little Rascals is the one film both kids and parents will enjoy! :)",1354233600,,1150,5.2896174863387975

Alfalfa faces some competition though in this film from a refined young man who has googly eyes for Darla. It's unfortunate that the clubhouse of the He-man Woman Hater's Club gets caught in the flames of love and burns down. (It helps to know the number for 911 in case of emergency.)

The romantical Alfalfa is torn between his pals and Darla. His best friend Spanky doesn't make it easy on him. Acts of rivalry between Alfalfa and the refined Waldo, whose wealthy father just bought the oil refinery, continue and hits its apex in a go-kart race with a wild driving scene. After certain events, the He-man Woman Haters Club rethinks their club membership rules.

789612,3,6304118937,"Everybody raises their children differently but after watching this movie once with our two small children we've shelved it indefinitely. Maybe when the youngest is 10 years old we'll pull it out again.

There were several things that made us cringe.

One minor irritation was that they tried to throw characters of the 1920s and 1930s in a 1990s America. Kids don't talk like that anymore, don't dress like that anymore, and the divide between girls and boys has been shrinking - why reopen that???

This should have been a period movie like ""Christmas Story"" and they should have removed the modern crude humor.

What really bothers us about it though were the constant statements of hate, killing, murder and dying. Sure these are kids and those words don't mean as much coming from them as it does from an adult but these words should not be used so casually.

Our fear was that our two young ones would begin to use language like that more often. No thanks. We'll be happier letting kids be kids without the suggestions of killing, murder, hate, etc.

Our last problem was the sexual innuendo. There were several occasions that made us cringe. One was Alfalfa's hair suggesting an erection when he saw a cute girl. I'm fine with that sort of humor being aimed at teens but let's leave the cause and effect of an erection unspoken for really young kids - okay?

The other was Alfalfa runing through the streets in jockey shorts (why not BOXERS?) and then losing them in the pool in front of Darla and the rich kid.

Hmmm... I don't know how but a 1930s version of this situation would seem much more innocent than this movie did. Maybe it was the delay between the time he noticed he was naked and the amount of time it took him to be embarrased.

In an old movie the character would have likely fled in terror behind something. In this movie all I could think of was a modern kid enjoying showing off his stuff. Yuck. Maybe in a Porky's style ""college"" movie - not in a movie for little kids. I prefer for our kids to be a little shy about who see's what.

I see the original episodes are available on DVD. We will be purchasing those.

Fun, innocent entertainment for little kids is very important to us. They grow up plenty fast without Hollywood's help. This movie is not part of the kind of entertainment we are ready to allow into our house for the kids.

Parents watch this one without your children and judge for yourself. It's funny but it may not be the kind of humor you want to introduce into your house - yet.",1231200000,,2526,4.467391304347826
789613,4,6304118937,"New interpretations of some classic Our Gang bits, a few cameos and decent production value.  Its a fun little movie and the kids are fun to watch.  They're poor actors, just like the originals, although the Spanky and Alfalfa that people remember from the late 30s were probably more polished than any of these kids.

My only complaint is the DVD edition seems to be the same edited version as the old VHS.  There are a few gags that are either incomplete, or missing altogether, but you can kind of tell where they belong (like the gentlemen walking into the bank).  There is also a funny extended trial scene that is much abbreviated in this version.  I remember seeing the missing scenes on TV oddly enough.

Like all the great, classic ""kids"" humor (vintage Disney, Hanna-Barbera, Sponge Bob, etc.), its really targeted for adults, or at least I believe, you have to be an adult to get all of the fantastic humor.

This movie reminded me of my own kids at their funniest.  The attitude seemed perfect.  For this, I'm not sure who to credit other than Penelope Spheeris, but all of the kids acting in this movie seemed relaxed, fun-loving, and outrageously humorous.  Not to take anything away form the ""mature"" actors - There were some fantasic cameos including Mel Brooks, Reba McEntire, Whoopi Goldberg, Darryl Hanna, George Wendt, and many others.

789730,5,6304118937,"As a 20-something male, I don't exactly fall under the target demographic for a movie like this.  With no nostalgia for the classic Hal Roach shorts in the 1930s, I can write about this movie on its own merits.

First off, I love this movie.  I watch it at least every two months and try to share it with as many friends as possible.  The casting was perfect as the acting by the children is superb.  You'll find yourself empathizing with love-struck Alfalfa, disliking Waldo, and laughing at every scene involving Buckwheat and Porky.  When watching the movie, it is amazing to realize how young these kids are and how believable they come across on screen.

Aside from the celebrity cameos, I really don't see how this movie will ever feel dated.  Well, I suppose Froggy's haircut and the physical appearances of Butch and Worm aren't exactly timeless, but the rest of the movie gives no clues that it is a mid-90s production.

I keep hoping that they will re-release this dvd with more special features, as I will be the first one in line to buy it.  One could make the case that this movie is more of a romantic comedy than a traditional comedy (as in the original Little Rascals/Our Gang shorts), and I would definitely agree.  There is an innocent charm to this movie, and the message that ""you only make a once-in-a-lifetime friend but once in a lifetime"" is made even more profound when spoken by a childhood friend.  This is an excellent movie for all ages and I cannot recommend it enough if you haven't already seen it!",1138752000,,1530,4.564102564102564
789731,5,6304118937,"The Little Rascals (1994), *****, starring Travis Tedford, Kevin Jamal Woods, Jordan Warkol, Zachary Mabry, Ross Bagley.

I first saw this movie on the exclusive Starz On Demand service that came with Comcast Cable. I love the Little Rascals and that is my main reason for watching it again and again. In the movie, I love how there's every main movie genre--excluding science-fiction and fantasy and animation. There's romance when Alfalfa (Bug Hall) woos his words of love to his young soulmate Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes). There's drama when Waldo interferes in the budding, inseparable relationship between Alfalfa and Darla. There's comedy when Alfalfa goes about half-naked when he undresses from the ballerina costume and when Butch (Sam Saletta) and Woim (Blake Jeremy Collins). There's plenty of action during the cross-city go-kart race. That's the best part of the whole movie. I recommend this film for male and female, young and old. There's everything for everybody.",1136851200,,983,5.301282051282051
789789,4,6304118937,"This film version of the classic series The Little Rascals is cute and funny, but by no means as accessible and charming as the original series.

The plot revolves around the gang, especially the members of the He-Man Woman Hater's Club including Spanky, Alfalfa, Buckwheat, Porky, Stymie, and Uh Huh. Alfalfa, leader Spanky's best friend, has turned against them by having Darla be his girlfriend. When he invites her to the clubhouse for a secret date, it accidentally burns down. Not only does the club now have to worry about building a new one, it is also concerned with winning the go-kart derby race. And Alfalfa can only think of winning Darla back from rich kid Waldo who steals her away, even though he is on probation from seeing her.

Thankfully, the film stays true to the characters and plots of the series, and even employs many of the same gags and situations, mainly from the later episodes. The He-Man Woman Haters Club comes from the short ""Hearts Are Thumps."" Also from this short is the bubble scene where Alfalfa consumes soap and sings out bubbles. The ""high sign"" comes from the short ""Anniversary Trouble."" The scene in which Spanky and Alfalfa dress in ballerina costumes to escape Butch and Woim is taken from ""Rushin' Ballet."" In ""Teacher's Beau,"" the kids sit on each other's shoulders and put on men's clothing and fake facial hair to appear older. The idea of putting on a show to make money is found in several shorts including ""The Big Show"" and ""The Our Gang Follies of 1936.""

There are many cameos in this film including those by Mel Brooks, the Olsen twins, and Whoopi Goldberg.

Overall, this film is cute, but it is mostly accessible to children, a step back from the original series.",1128038400,,1723,4.714285714285714

What made the original work was that many of what was done was impromptu with the kids acting at being themselves.  In this movie, the kids are trying to copy other people working from a script and it just doesn't work.

While this is not bad for children or adults, why not just buy the originals instead? Basically all they've done here was take several of the original films, such as ""Mail and Female"" and ""Rushin' Ballet"", and string them together as a movie. Another problem I had was the clash of time periods - the characters dress like the originals and engage in the same types of activities, yet the film obviously takes place in the 1990's. Children simply don't build go-carts or wear bowties anymore. Why not just fully update the gang into the 1990's or make this a period piece instead?

Nonetheless it's a wonderful movie for all ages. You can see how kids their age see the world. They are growing up and learn that they can't hate women any longer.
About the movie, Alfalfa likes a girl named Darla, and tries to win her heart back from the conceited Waldo.
The clubhouse is burnt down because of a picnic and they are trying to find a way to raise money to build a new one. And Alfalfa is still going after Darla.

Also the time when they were racing their box durbe racers and they won by Alfalfa's hair.
This movie made the whole family laugh and i hope when you watch it will make you laugh to.  I also like the Director and how they made the movie realalistic by how the kids act when together.  I would like to encourage others to watch this movie if you like to laugh.",1020902400,,666,4.171875

789893,2,6304118937,"There's a whole school of comedy the premise of which is the comedic characters getting themselves into situations which would be anywhere from tense to outright horrible in any other kind of movie -- in other words, no kind of situation any of /us/ would /like/ to be in -- but we get to laugh at their discomfiture because it's them and not us who're looking stupid.  Abbott and Costello, the Three Stooges, The Little Rascals, all are examples of this kind of genre from the 20's/30's.  And the genre lives still -- in movies like ""Dumb and Dumber"" or ""The Klumps"".
When my mom was a girl, she used to sit in Abbott and Costello movies, and while everyone around her was howling with laughter, she was biting her nails worrying about how they were going to get out of it this time.  I'm kinda the same, only I find myself sitting there watching a family snipe at each other, thinking, This is SO painful, how can ANYbody think this is FUNNY?""  And yet, people do.
So if you're the kind of person who does find such things funny, you'll love Darla and Alfalfa eating peanut butter and used cat litter sandwiches rigged up by Alfalfa's ""He-man Woman-hating"" chums in their effort to foil his courtship of her.  As for me, I was able to stand it for about 20 minutes before I just had to turn it off.  Not even the ""deer in the headlights"" syndrome -- where it's so horrible but you can't stop watching -- could make me finish the movie.
In other words, it's absolutely true to the spirit of the original (even uses some of the original's routines), right down to the state of squirming in my seat in which I always found myself on watching the original.
