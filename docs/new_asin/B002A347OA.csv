8358902,1,B002A347OA,"My 1/10 mangaupdates review of the original series of which this is a direct adaptation: This Slum King is well documented already and Bennett The Sage didn't even review the equally abhorred ova which is banned in australia/germany when he reviewed in for real so you know what to expect. The ANN score is also a delight. Just look at (my) categories and know that cannibalistic futanari rape (yes that is a sentence) is a thing and not the worst part of the manga. Dick slicing and then devouring, child rape and.. are in it too with no further meaning to back them up so this is basically gore porn only. The first few volumes were published as shonen so that is just lovely, the art is meh at best, the continuity and tone make no sense, the camoes are a disgrace and i hate these characters already so let's stop. One day a group will unleash the entire thing on the world but i had my fill a decade ago. Till then you will have to imagine the fire or RUN FOR YOUR LIFE/SANITY. Berserk reigns supreme on the other end of the spectrum and only his Dante Shinkyoku (8,5/10) and to a lesser degree Mugen Utamaro (7/10) should be read but both are also adaptations. Amon - Devilman Mokushiroku (6/10) is the only part of the Devilman(4/10) mythos i can give to other people without fearing a lawsuit btw. Fun fact: Sho Aikawa wrote the ova's for V.J. and the ones for Urotsukid'ji (0/10) too. He also wrote most of the first FMA anime so that puts it's misguided gecko ending in perspective doesn't it?",1424822400,,1503,4.4296028880866425
8358903,1,B002A347OA,"(Update, 2/24/15: Today, Discotek Media have released an authorized, completely uncut DVD of all three OVAs. The mosaics are still included in ""Evil Town"", but unmosaiced footage from the Hong Kong VCD is included as an extra. I recommend getting the new Discotek DVD. Two audio options are available: English dub and Japanese audio with English subtitles.)

Unfortunately, aside from tracking down the uncut VHS tapes by Manga Video or downloading the series, this bootleg is so far the only English-friendly and uncut release of the ""Violence Jack"" OVAs on DVD. The video is transferred from the French DVDs and with fan-made subtitles. These subs, though, are often sloppy--not just in translation and wording but in format also, as it's not uncommon to have three whole rows of text on-screen at once in a very uneven shape and that flash by a little too quick at times. (At some parts, the subs will be shown for a split-second, forcing you to rewind and pause at just the right moment to see what's being said.)

Although the French DVDs these video rips are sourced from appear to be of passable quality, I believe this DVD is actually taken from torrent files and not a higher quality source (like a direct transfer of the French video). It looks OK, but it's fairly obvious that whoever released this DVD simply torrented the episodes and then slapped them on disc; you'd be better off skipping the DVD and not funding crooks. Also, something that's totally baffling is the end credits for all three OVAs are abruptly cut out within seconds of starting--you'll start getting into the kickin' music, and then bam, you're suddenly watching the next episode. This isn't the case with the original files.

Also, despite the back of the case stating this disc is 16:9, the second and third episodes are non-anamorphic widescreen, so the bums who released this apparently don't know what the 16:9 designation means. And being DVD, the video has been downsized to 480; the resolution of the original files is 720x576.

Don't buy this crap. Track down the uncut tapes (Manga Video released the series both subbed and dubbed) or wait for an official US DVD release and cross your fingers that it will be uncut unlike what Manga released on DVD in the UK.",1314748800,8,2254,4.816537467700258
8358904,1,B002A347OA,I've been looking for an english dubbed version for over 14 years now and upon purchasing this DVD and finally watching it I found out that this dvd is a lie.  There is no english dub whatsoever on the disc and I feel raped out of the 15 bucks i spent on it.  My rating is not based on the anime itself which in fact I am a huge fan of the devilman/violence jack series but on the fact that the bootleggers lied about the dub.,1300060800,5,426,3.941860465116279
8358905,1,B002A347OA,"This review does not reflect the quality of the anime in the least. This particular DVD release is a bootleg release by a company called Anime Manga Cartoon DVD. It is NOT an authentic release! I'm currently in an ugle A-Z Claim with the seller who sold me this to get my money back. If you want to support the anime industry, DO NOT encourage these bootleggers with a purchase!",1295913600,12,378,4.414285714285715
8358906,4,B002A347OA,"This is a decent anime. Art is a little different in every episode. It's pretty crisp, though (in this dvd collection). I haven't been able to find the region 1 collection anywhere except here. The ONLY problem that was a little disappointing was that the dvd says it has english subs and dubs, but upon going into the menu, both the ""sub"" and ""dub"" options only lead to english subtitles. At times, they can be annoying, but it is still worth the buy. A must have for any Go Nagai fan or Devilman fan (or any serious anime collector). If you love twisted and bloody anime, then you'll definitely like this. Not for the faint of heart, though. Some really sick images in (I think) the second episode. Rape and murder are re-occuring trends in this collection. All in all...I enjoyed the anime a lot. If it weren't for the subs (ONLY), I would give this a 5 of 5 rating.

Hope you enjoy, and don't say I didn't warn you. ^_^",1257897600,7,923,4.366279069767442
