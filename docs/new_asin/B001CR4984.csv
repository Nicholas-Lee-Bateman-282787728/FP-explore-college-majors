3517230,3,B001CR4984,"Did not dwell too long on first reviewer's ad for this film. Now, let's go to the film itself and a real review. Andes seems to be so busy romancing Susan Cabot and Philipino glamor beauty Paraluman that he doesn't find much time to organize and lead his troops of civilians and headhunters to defeat the Japanese. The script in fact seems to overplay the bravery of his female soldiers and spies more than his own--after all, Paraluman is captured and dies in a sacrifice for their victory. His speech while accepting a medal from Gen. McArthur about having ""learned to love another race"" was one of the film's best points. The trailer did go overboard in promoting risque scenes and suggesting more was there than ever really was.",1235692800,5,732,4.682170542635659

Blackburn (Keith Andes), a lieutenant in the U.S. Army, is in the Philippines at the outbreak of World War II --- Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, when American forces headed by Gen. Douglas MacArthur are overwhelmed at Bataan, Blackburn refuses to retreat or surrender and escapes to the hills with the help of a Filipino woman named Delia Guerrero (Susan Cabot) --- During their treacherous journey, Blackburn contracts malaria but recovers with Delia's help --- Later, locals lead Blackburn to the camp of Pilar (Paraluman), a Filipino woman who heads a group of guerrilla fighters. Although at first only thinking of his own freedom, Blackburn soon comes to respect and admire the Filipino fighters, who are capable and brave --- Blackburn then resolves to organize the informal band into a fighting unit to help defeat the occupying Japanese --- For the next four years, Blackburn trains and fights alongside the Filipino band, which includes many headhunting natives --- Eventually, the band grows to over one thousand --- Although the Japanese offer a 50,000-peso reward for Blackburn's capture, no one betrays him --- Blackburn and his men eventually become known as the Eleventh Army, and when MacArthur is about to take back the Philippines, they coordinate efforts with him by capturing the northern shore of Luzon, a strategic location --- Despite being outnumbered by the Japanese by more than ten-to-one, the guerrillas are successful.

8288937,2,B001CR4984,"This is an old-fashioned war movie from the 40's which is nonetheless interesting because it is based on a true story.  I remember studying this example of guerilla warfare in ROTC in the 60's.  The story represents the ideal situation where you have a truly ruthless occupying Army (the Japanese in the Philippines) and a small cadre of professional soldiers recruiting and training the locals to fight.  Not only is the movie black and white, the good buys and bad guys are similarly well defined.  This ad hoc military force tied down a lot of occupying Japanese troops who did not know the territory and were not trained to fight an army that would strike by surprise and disappear back into the jungle.",1428278400,2,707,4.723577235772358
