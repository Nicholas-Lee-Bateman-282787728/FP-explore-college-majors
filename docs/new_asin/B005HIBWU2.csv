8473093,4,B005HIBWU2,I like the movie. Though the case was pretty crappy and scratched. Disappointed that the disc is a purple one...DVD..R..that won't last long. I deliberately bought an older DVD so u could get one that was not a DVD R. Oh well. We live and learn!,1514505600,,245,4.3478260869565215

8473097,3,B005HIBWU2,"Unlike many film presentations, this plot improves [?] with each try: NOOSE FOR A GUNMAN [1959] with Jim Davis, Ted  DeCorsa and Barton McLain and THE QUICK GUN [1964] with Audie Murphy, Ted Decorsa [reprising the previous role] and James Best.
  None are really noteworthy or capable of impressing your friends.",1395619200,3,312,5.078431372549019
8473098,2,B005HIBWU2,"My husband and I watched this together and we both agreed this show had much to be desired.  It was slow moving and confusing.

Do not spend your money on it.  Use it to buy something else.

Obviously, I do not recommend this.",1393027200,2,226,4.186046511627907
