8578829,5,B00C94YYVG,"I was fortunate enough to see this realistic movie on the big screen first,
so I purchased the DVD.  Dialog is well rendered in English in large white
type in the black lower portion of the screen.  The object of the film was
to show the very capable police commissioner (Mr. Nana Patekar) testifying
as to the events of Nov. 26, 2008, which are depicted in flashback.  The
carnage is shown straight-on; there is no attempt to dilute the sheer horror
of this massacre.  Personally, I was dumbfounded that these ten young men
could perpetrate such atrocity in the name of God, but that's the sad fact.
Religion can be a force for goodness and compassion; but it can be twisted
into an excuse for barbaric evil, as we Americans learned so well on 09-11.

  The film details the courage of many Indian citizens during the attack.
A young lady employee of the Taj Mahal Hotel, instead of running, exposes
herself to certain death trying to save a little child.  The pitifully
outgunned security officers try to fight back against the AK-47-shooting
terrorists in the central railroad station.  A brave doctor at the hospital
shepherds patients and staff to safety as the shooters invade the premises.
Such shining examples of people rising to their best efforts help counteract
the nauseating feeling of the marauders' violence.

  Mr. Patekar holds the movie together as the tough police commissioner.  He
castigates the miserable wretch who was captured with well-chosen words.  The
bloodthirsty dupes, he says, were merely dogs, sicced upon innocent people by
even worse characters, radical plotters who are a disgrace to a great religion.",1397001600,2,1638,4.9523809523809526

8578831,4,B00C94YYVG,"What could a movie such as the attacks of 26/11 offer in terms of new breakthroughs or insights? Not many people are unaware of the events of Nov, 26, 2008 when 10 terrorists unleashed their terror in Mumbai killing 160 people and injuring 300. It was one of the worst terrorist attacks on Indian soil. However,Ram Gopal Verma who seems to be marching to the beats of his own drum while making films, chooses 26/11 as his new venture. He had expressed interest in making a film soon after the attacks without actually saying it so. Chief Minister of Maharashtra Vilasrao Deshmukh had to resign after a huge public outrage,  that he and his son Riteish accompanied filmmaker RGV to the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Colaba, post the attacks.  RGV intentions were to create the attacks and the emotional turmoil the country of India went through-  but he only manages to recreate the attacks on CST, Leopold Cafe and not the horror as I found the emotional punch in many of the scenes. The Taj Scenes were recreated with the help of a set. However there are moments in the film  which make you relive those horrific moments, the scene outside Leopold Cafe when the policemen come to investigate the commotion, with just batons in their hands and throwing stones supposedly to find signs of activity. This was just a  sad display of the law enforcement system crumbling in Mumbai because the cops were not only clueless but also unarmed in the face of the growing threat.  The system failed because not only were they able to prevent the crime but watched it grow in intensity by the hour. Also shocking is the ease of entry that the terrorists found in Mumbai and were able to get access to the city.
The film is narrated from the viewpoint of Mumbai police commissioner Rakesh Maria  ( Nana Patekar)and his struggle to contain the violence and finally his reluctant plea to the commandos for help. This docudrama hits you emotionally in very few places but does not offer much. Three stars. 3/8/3013",1368144000,2,1994,4.663817663817664
8578832,4,B00C94YYVG,"The conclusion of this movie directly confronts the ignorance of hatred. To view this in a foreign film brings home the fact that terrorism harms the global community; that people of good will must stand together and against what will probably prove to be THE challenge of the 21st Century.  The reason I did not give this 5 stars (Love It) is because it is not a happy, feel-good sort of film.... try another Bollywood production for that.",1367625600,,440,4.641025641025641
