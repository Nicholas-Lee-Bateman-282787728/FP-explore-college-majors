7894581,3,6305793913,"Not a particularly memorable Martial Arts film by any stretch of the imagination, this feature has nevertheless gained a certain amount of cult status due almost entirely to Kung Pow: Enter the Fist and garners an additional star for it.

One would find it hard not to recall lines from Kung Pow.  Thusly, it would be hard to take Tiger & Crane Fist seriously as intended.  You will notice that scenes do not follow the same order, and (not surprisingly) there's no Infernal Tonguey or a need to ""avoid the meadow.""  Some things will surprise however as there were several scenes and extended takes that were not used, and others that you may have thought were unique to Kung Pow.

Don't expect extensive remastering on this VHS title.  Only cleverly selected (though numerous) portions of the original master were used, and only those were remastered in picture and sound uniquely for the 2002 Steve Oedekerk film.

It would do some good to have this film remastered in its entirety, but the copyright owners likely fear numbers interested would be too few.

This VHS edition (printed in 1999 and in EP speed) is a full-screen presentation from the original source without the benefit of remastered picture and sound.  The opening and ending are abrupt - there are no closing credits for some unknown reason.  The far more rare and better quality SP-speed version has the full closing, which is simply the leads walking away from the camera and then a black-screen 'The End' in dual-language format.

Note: This film is AKA: *Savage Killers*, of which a repro poster is available here in Amazon.com.",1171324800,5,1600,4.845588235294118
7894582,5,6305793913,This is a good movie that inspired the greatest movie...Kung Pow. I would recommend this to all people.,1056412800,6,103,4.777777777777778
7894583,5,6305793913,I RECOMEND KUNG POW BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY HILARIOUS.ESPECIALLY THE BAD GUY(BETTY) AND MASTER TANG AND LING AND THE CHOSEN ONE. IF YOU SEE THIS MOVIE YOU'LL LIKE IT BECAUSE IT CONTAINS PHYSICAL HUMOR AND IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY SAY IT WOULD BE VERY FUNNY. I LIKE IT SO MUCH I SEE IT EVERY DAY. I EVEN KNOW THE LINES ALREADY. AND TIGER AND CRANE FISTS I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BUT I ALREADY ORDERED IT HERE IN THIS WEB SITE. I RECOMEND YOU SEE BOTH OF THEM.,1043366400,,457,4.146067415730337
7894584,4,6305793913,"Kung Pow's dazzling effects and sampling sparked intrest in the original movie it was made from, Tiger and Crane Fists. I just had to get this movie to see how the story really went, and find out if it was originally a sci-fi movie at all. This is a very emotional story of two adjacent clans in China that learn the hard way that they must overcome pride, combine technique, and unite to overcome the ruthless oppressing Master Paine or Betty.
The picture quality is ok, sound (music&effects) is retro, but in a cool way, and dialogue was before its time (suprisingly)
I enjoyed this movie, and I think anyone would who was intrigued by the masterpiece Kung Pow.",1035590400,8,663,4.579831932773109
7894585,4,6305793913,"This video is quite nice. I have seen some Bruce Lee's movies and I think that Tiger and Crane Fist  is better than some others. So for any Martial Arts fans, and those who wants to know else than Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Jet Li.... etc, this is a movie to see",1020643200,,259,3.980769230769231
7894586,3,6305793913,"Basically there is an evil Kung Fu master (who really shows no actual skill) who is killing all other kung fu practicioners in the village.  He kills two masters, one from the 'Tiger School' and one from the 'Crane School'.  These styles had been separate for a long time, but the only way to beat the evil master is to combine the two...
This one was pretty cool. I'm a huge kung fu fan, and enjoy seeing traditional kung fu styles reflected in cheesy kung fu movies. This one does not disappoint. Hung Gar Tiger and Crane is represented very well. The acting is of course marginal, but worth watching if you like old kung fu flicks.  Jimmy Wang Yu gives one of his better fighting performances.",986342400,2,696,4.464566929133858
