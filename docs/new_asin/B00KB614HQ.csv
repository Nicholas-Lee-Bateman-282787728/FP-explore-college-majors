6413008,5,B00KB614HQ,"Part of the fabled 2012 ""Doctor Who Missing Tapes found"" 'omnirumour', this story is said to have been found but then the info was squashed.  An interesting story for those of us who have seen it (even as a telesnap version),

The TARDIS lands on a deserted volcanic island and The Doctor, Ben, Polly and Jamie are captured and taken in a lift down a shaft below the seabed.

This episode holds more excitement for classic Whovians who long for the discovery of more original Hartnell and Troughton episodes.

Sadly, as of today, Steve Roberts of The Doctor Who Restoration Team stated that no further Doctor Who DVD releases are planned.

I am intrigued to know if Amazon knows more than anyone else.",1417219200,19,701,4.666666666666667
6413009,5,B00KB614HQ,"An awesome ""lost"" Doctor Who adventure from the Pat Troughton era. While the DVD isn't out yet, I've heard the audio tracks/dramatization that was put out several years ago of this classic who adventure.
It is 4 x 25 min episodes. Gets to the point, adventure, drama, resolution, and not at all drawn out to the point of being tediously boring as some of the 'Historical Hartnell' episodes could be.
The Dr (Pat Troughton) and friends land in a volcano and end up in Atlantis, an undersea world of fish people. Redolent of 'The Aztecs', there's religious characters whom at first seem friendly but then want the doctor (or his companions) to be religiously sacrificed.
No more spoilers, except to say the Doctor foments revolution and someone wants to destroy the world.
Regrettably, two of the original BBC episodes are missing. I'd heard they were to be animated, as have several Who adventures, yet it seems now this may be in limbo.
I hope they do. The animated episodes have not been disappointing to me,
Probably best recommended for serious old school Who fans. I'm sure many of the old who fan die-hards like me, who love the Dr Who animations and all the 60's era adventures, would express great interest if they knew when this dvd was to be released.",1416096000,37,1260,4.705882352941177
6413010,2,B00KB614HQ,"I love the classic Doctor Who stories and Patrick Troughton was a terrific doctor, but The Underwater Menace was a disappointment.  The missing stores are merely shown as story boards and not animation.  Not worthy of a new release.",1478476800,,232,4.923076923076923

6413012,2,B00KB614HQ,"I am a big fan of this story. Sure is cheep and campy, but really fun and enjoyable with some great performances in it and some great music by Dudley Simpson. So when I heard it was finally going to be released on DVD, I was thrilled. And it didn't bother me that the missing episodes were going to be telesnaps since they worked so well on other Dr. Who releases. In fact I actually prefer the telesnap reconstruction of Episode 4 of The Tenth Planet rather than the animated one. So when I heard that they weren't going to animate the episodes, it didn't bother me at all. That is until I seen it. The telesnap reconstructions on this release are terrible. There was no real attempt at all at making the missing episodes coherent and understandable. It was hard understanding what was going on. In other telesnap reconstructions, we've had subtitles at the bottom of the screen that told us what was going on if we couldn't understand what was going on by looking at the picture, but in this one we don't have any subtitles. The same picture stays on the screen forever even if it's no longer relevant to what is going on in the story. In previous reconstructions we also get an actual title sequence and end credits. In this one we just get a still title card reading ""Doctor Who"", and we get no end credits except for the producer and director. In previous ones we've also had the surviving clips, if any, incorporated into the reconstructions, but here we have to go to the special features in order to see them. Not happy with this release at all, and it's a shame because I actually really like this story. But it's not worth the money. I say save your money for a decent release instead of this crappy one in which there was not a lot of effort put into it. Not Recommended!",1477008000,,1782,4.403030303030303
6413013,3,B00KB614HQ,"I enjoyed the two existing episodes, but I was disappointed with the reconstruction via telesnaps. I don't understand why this didn't get the animated treatment like The Tenth Planet, Invasion, Reign of Terror and Moon Base. Considering the two existing episodes are already on the Lost in Time set, I expected more in the way of special features. But overall I enjoyed the story. That's why I'm being generous with the rating. Also the slipcase arrived with a little chunk taken out of the bottom corner. I think somebody would have noticed that.

As usual, even with some of the criticism of the story in general, I enjoyed it very much (as I do with anything of the second doctor). However, I think I was disappointed by the use of tele-snaps  where this could have been a greater experience if the BBC had went and animated the still, lost, episodes.",1468195200,,462,4.310344827586207
6413019,3,B00KB614HQ,"So, just to start off, I think it is AWESOME to have this ""Missing"" episode restored and out in DVD format.  As a Who fan from way back I always love to see stuff that I haven't before.  If I had to review the episode itself, I might have gone higher but...

So to start off, it is (to me at least) less than clear that episodes 1 and 4 are still shots with the sound track in the background.  While that is definitely a way to go, it wasn't clear from the onset that was the case and I was a tiny bit disappointed by that.  Still, that is probably down to me not fully researching and not necessarily a flaw in the delivery.

What I did find to be a flaw was the manner in which these episodes were put in.  While the sound track was intact, there were a number of sections where the stills did not line up with the sound track, leading sometimes to one still covering two separate and different scenes, making things very confusing.  What is worse, there is no linking narrative to fill in the blanks where no one is speaking but you are supposed to know what is going on, only the stills are from a different part of the story entirely.  I appreciate that they only had a very little bit of footage to take from, but a little bit of creative editing (along with a Voice over narrative) could have more effectively portrayed the action MUCH better than was done here.

All in all, it was a fun episode and something that I am glad to add to my collection.  I just want to warn people that it could have been done quite a bit better even given what they had to work with.  Be aware that certain scenes will be confusing at best and frustrating at worst.",1468108800,4,1654,4.150470219435737

6413021,4,B00KB614HQ,"Given the time period and budget limitations it was an ambitious story.  The 'slides' used to replace the missing video is a bit disappointing as they stay on the individual images too long, but as I have no idea where these images came from, we are perhaps lucky to have even these.  That being said it is still worth owning if you are a fan of the classic series.",1466726400,,365,4.27536231884058
6413022,3,B00KB614HQ,"Be aware, you are only getting 2 episodes out of four.  Parts 1 and 4 are audio with still pictures.  There aren't enough pictures to fill in all the plot, something you'll be guessing.  Not that it's hard, this is a very obvious and simple story.  Probably Troughton's worst.  I got it because I'm a DW completist but the causal fan may want to skip.  This is the earliest Troughton story with recovered episodes so start here until the find Power of the Daleks and The Highlanders.",1466726400,,483,4.494252873563219
6413023,5,B00KB614HQ,"Here it is...finally, in all its 'glory'! With Episode 2 being returned to the BBC in 2011, this release had plenty of time to be amazing. Sadly, after watching the reconstructions of Episodes 1 & 4, amazing is not the first word that came to mind. I am extremely pleased that the BBC did decide to release this title, even though it lacked almost everything that made the other incomplete Doctor Who stories mega-enjoyable. But, rather than pointing out all of the flaws in the final (at least until more lost episodes are located) classic Doctor Who DVD release, I want to point out a few of the good points.

1) The main baddie in this story is an over the top madman, and is spot on with a lot of the villains of mid-sixties television. It was good to see an off-the-chain character go brain-to-brain with the Doctor.

2) The interviews with some of the story's cast were enjoyable, like most of the stories released in this series. It's always nice to hear the actor's share their experiences while making the show. If you like the interviews that are available on this series' other releases, I think you won't be disappointed with what has been made available on this release.

3) Part Two of a documentary about the BBC hosted by Peter Davison (5th Doctor) and many of his companions and BBC staff. I love to watch the actor's walk about Television Centre as they recall their memories of decades ago. (Other than it having one previously lost episode, some might argue that the bonus features offered on this release is one of the main reasons to purchase this title.)

4) Getting to see the 2nd Doctor play his iconic recorder. With a number of Troughton's episodes still lost in time & space, this is one of the few stories you actually get to see the Doctor take a moment to blow out a little tune while contemplating how to get out of his latest predicament.

So, even though this story was probably not the best way to finish up a range of DVD's that have been slowly coming across the pond since September 2001, it does have a few good reasons to pick up a copy. If you are MAD ABOUT WHO like I am, not adding this title to your collection would have all the charm and sophistication of owning a famous hand painted portrait ...after someone had blacked out the teeth of subject with a felt tipped marker.

Long live the Doctor!",1466467200,,2343,4.488262910798122
6413024,2,B00KB614HQ,"God, I wanted to love this formerly missing episode, but it is one of Troughton's weakest.  The Doctor ends up on the lost continent of Atlantis(during contemporary times for the show-about 1970).  A mad scientist has told the inhabitants he will raise their lost civilization to the surface, but he really wants to blow up the world instead.  OK, I know he is a ""mad"" scientist, but really....  I could buy him wanting to rule the world but to blow it(and himself as well) up just in order to do it.......  Well.............  Pretty weak..........  And speaking of weak, episodes 1 and 4 are the soundtrack played with still images.  While this has been done well on other lost episodes, in this case the stills are clumsily done and do not keep pace with the background dialogue.  For those who want to see ever Dr. Who serial that exists, you'll watch it no matter what reviewers say(And I would do the same.).  Just don't expect it to be one of the better serials......",1466121600,,973,4.604651162790698
6413025,3,B00KB614HQ,"The last classic Doctor Who story to come to DVD, this features the earliest existing episodes for the Second Doctor.

The plot is absurd mad scientist stuff with an insane scientist who could think of no better achievement than destroying the Earth. In the hands of another crew, the story would become an absolute fiasco, but credit the cast on, Underwater Menace, the story is played with absolute conviction, so it rises above its silly, campy idea to become a perfectly watchable story thats a bit of a homage to many B American sci-fi horror films of the 1950s and early 60s. Troughton is superb and he is in full command in his third story as the Doctor.

The DVD release does have some problems. Mainly, its that the still used for the missing 1st and final episodes don't tell complete stories and the whole thing would have been helped by using the BBC narration tracks that have been used for the audio-only release so that viewers could know what was going during lost visual bits.. In addition, the closing message of the story is a bit of a non-sequitur to what actually happened in the episode.

Overall, not bad, and a mostly fun story.",1465516800,,1152,4.609756097560975

6413027,5,B00KB614HQ,"Amazon allows you to pre-order things.  I have had this on pre-order for well over a year.  At one point there were reviews on here saying that the project had been scuttled and this was not going to be released.  So it was a complete surprise when this showed up in the mail.

The first and last episodes are really a slide show but its not a bad way to view this episode.  Much better than never having it.  There is not much in the way of Special features either.  So I am thinking they may do a special edition later on.

6413028,4,B00KB614HQ,"I was disappointed in the fact that episodes 1 & 4 were not animated but presented as photographic still shots. Having it animated as many other missing episodes were would have greatly improved the impact of the story.

I particularly enjoyed Professor Zaroff, the stereotypical mad scientist. He really made the story I felt.

Even with two of the episodes being still shots, the story was pretty good overall and I'm glad to add this Troughton story to my Doctor Who collection.",1464739200,4,481,4.853658536585366

I know the cost is much higher but I hope after the next find they go back to animation. The DVD extras were very good. I do have an issue with the credits. They list Troughton, Hines and Wills as starring but not Michael Craze. He seem to be one of the forgotten companions.",1464566400,,438,4.104651162790698
6413030,3,B00KB614HQ,"What may be the final DVD release of the Classic series range(unless new episodes turn up that are still missing, making a re-release viable)  of this much delayed Second Doctor story first broadcast in 1967 is a decidedly bittersweet story to close the range. The good news is that the surviving episodes two and three look fine restored and re-mastered, and the extras(especially a making-of featurette with surviving cast and crew) are excellent, which these DVDs set the standard for. The bad news is that the story itself is dreadful, though Patrick Troughton in particular does all he can to elevate such an unusually(for this series) weak script. Perhaps worst of all is the presentation of still-missing episodes one and four in telesnap form, with no running scrawl narration at the bottom of the screen to inform viewer of off-screen action! Such lazy treatment is a distinct disappointment. Animation(as was done with five incomplete stories) worked very well on those DVDs, but sadly none of that here.

Still, for fans this will be a must-have buy to complete their DVD collections. Let's hope more missing episodes turn up so that this isn't the end...",1464566400,,1166,5.005154639175258

I have all 50 years worth of content and was excited to be getting something that was lost and new to my collection but this is even worse than the new ninth series. Thankfully I have all the old content to revisit. Still only missing 10 episodes of William Hartnell and 10 episodes of Patrick Troughton (this was supposed to reduce the number to 9). I now do not hold any hope of getting any of these. I had heard they found some lost reels in a closet in Nigeria? I guess this isn't it.",1464566400,,620,4.132231404958677

6413033,4,B00KB614HQ,"Let me begin by saying I am so happy BBC finally released the lost episode discovered back in 2011. Five years was an extremely long time to have to wait! Ok, the extras: A Fishy Tale; excellent behind the scenes history of this story. Television Centre part 2; This features Peter Davison, Janet Fielding and Mark Stricksons memories of their time on the show. While it feels a little out of place here on a second doctor serial, it too was a long time in being released it was great to finally see the conclusion. Part 1 came out as an extra on The Visitation back in 2013. Lastly the commentaries, they are superb as always. Now for the show itself, it is hard for me to critique something that I wanted released under any conditions, but I have to say BBC did what looks like a half-fast job with the two still missing episodes. I know the original plan was to have them animated, which fell through, but the telesnaps move slower than the narration. There is also no narration of the action taken place. Come on BBC, you could have put a little more effort into this, you did have five years to get it ready after all!

6413034,2,B00KB614HQ,"I was really looking forward to this, but it was difficult for my son and I to get through the first episode. Episodes 1 & 4 are ""restored"" meaning they use ""slides/still images"" as a replacement for the video which is apparently lost. The audio plays underneath the slide images. The problem is that unlike radio shows, where the stage direction is often built into the dialogue, in this presentation, it is easy to get a bit lost. I realize they did the best they could do, but it is still very lacking.

Unless you're an extreme die-hard Doctor Who fan, this will probably not interest you. Just sayin'...",1464134400,14,608,4.577981651376147

Overall, it's great; episodes 2 and 3 look great and are fun to watch, there is a cool special feature on the making of Underwater Menace staring a lot of the cast and crew and it's wonderful to see (at least through the telesnaps) and hear Jamie's ""bigger on the inside"" moment. The thing that took away from the feature were the way the telesnaps were set up. Maybe there weren't enough to make a full 25 minute episode, but it seemed to me that it lingered on the same photo for too long, even after the action had gone past that point. Got a bit distracting and boring at times. Some of the older shows I've seen at least had a scroll on the bottom to tell you what was going on, this had nothing. It's a shame that the company that was supposed to do the animation for the missing episodes went belly-up..would have helped a lot.",1464134400,6,936,4.264044943820225

6413037,4,B00KB614HQ,"This is the episode where Patrick Troughton developed his Doctor persona.  The documentaries indicate this was originally going to be the second story with Patrick as the doctor, but the BBC saw the storyline and bumped it off the schedule.  Problems with Patrick's third story prompted the BBC to put this story in the third story position (Jamie's premier story THE HIGHLANDER would be the second show).  Now Jamie had to be added to the script as he was now a part of the TARDIS crew, some of the dialog got transferred to his character.

I don't know why the BBC had problems with the story, I found this story enjoyable.  Patrick Troughton has some classic lines here, I am glad the episode was found.
Jamie: ""Doctor, do you know what you are doing?""
Doctor: ""Jamie how can you ask? Of coarse I don't know what I'm doing!""
As this is a very early Patrick Troughton episode and he is still finding his character, I think he really means it.

It is amazing how many ""Tele-Snaps"" exist on the two missing episodes, but I would ave preferred animating the episodes and including the stills as a bonus.

They were very badly done and you can find much better fan made recons of those eps online. I'm not sure why they didn't get these missing eps animated, but the least they could have done is put the same effort into the recons as Who fans have done.

6413039,4,B00KB614HQ,"At the end of ""The Highlanders"" episode, the 1746 Scottish War Piper, Jamie McCrimmon, joins the Doctor, Polly and Ben to travel in the TARDIS. As usual, the TARDIS goes where it wants to go. This time, it sets down on an island in the middle of the ocean.

The four of them are captured almost immediately, such is their luck, and they are lowered in a cage down, down, down into the ground, until they must be far below the sea level. They're given plankton to eat, and are visited by the priest, Lolem. He is rather friendly as he tells the travelers that they are just in time for the Festival of the Vernal Equinox.
Doctor: ""And just what part are we to play in this Festival of the Vernal Equinox?""
Lolem: ""A very important part... I regret to say.""
Lolem, to just the Doctor: ""Now stranger, say what you have to, and do not waste time. There is very little of it left for any of you.""

Oh, no! To be sacrificed to the goddess Amdo. There is one chance. The Atlanteans are harboring the evil scientist Zaroff, thinking he will help them raise their city above the sea again. Can anyone trust Zaroff?

""The Underwater Menace"" is a black & white series that originally aired January/February 1967 in four episodes totaling 100 minutes. Video is available for only episodes 2 and 3, and it has been digitally remastered for this DVD release. Episodes 1 and 4 are presented with telesnaps and existing soundtrack. The soundtrack is remastered, also, but it is still mono. All episodes are presented in TV 4:3 aspect ratio. English subtitles are available on all 4 episodes and the first two bonus features.

In case you're wondering, your average Atlantean is perfectly humanoid, except for maybe bushy eyebrows. The strange goggle-eyed and sequined creatures in the publicity photo are special Atlantis fish people. Lolem tells Polly that they are the plankton farmers, ""We give them plastic gills.... Some people get most upset when they find out they've had the operation.""
Look for the ""swimming"" fish people's wires in episode 3!

Bonus Features:

1. ""A Fishy Tale"" This featurette is narrated by Peter Davison, the fifth Doctor . Commentators include: Anneke Wills (plays Polly), Frazer Hines (plays Jamie), Catherine Howe (plays Ara), Gareth Gwenlan (assistant floor manager), Berry Butler (production assistant) and Robert Shearman (new series writer).
The water sequences were filmed at Ealing Studios. Gwenlan remembers: ""It was the first time I'd seen a film tank inside a studio and I could not believe that anyone was going to get in it. Because it was disgusting and dirty and smelly and although they had some kind of heaters that had been on for a month, it was still freezing cold.""

2. ""The Television Centre of the Universe  Part Two"" This was an episode of the children's TV show, ""Blue Peter"". Part One is a bonus feature on the 2013 Special Edition DVD release of the Peter Davison episode,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Visitation-Special-Edition/dp/B00BIR4VQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Visitation (Special Edition)</a>.
This is a very enjoyable bonus. Yvette Fielding narrates and leads a nostalgic tour of the huge BBC Television Centre complex. Opened in 1960, the building had just been sold when this two-parter was filmed, and the BBC was in the process of moving out. Commentators include Peter Davison (5th Doctor), Janet Fielding (plays Tegan Jovanka), Mark Strickson (plays Vislor Turlough), Alec Wheal (senior camera supervisor), Sue Hedden (assistant floor manager), Richard Marson (former Doctor Who Magazine writer), Bob Richardson (Exhibition Assistant BBC Enterprises), Jane Ashford (production assistant) and Simon Anthony (video tape engineer).
Hedden remembers the food: ""There was the famous dishwater coffee.... It was poisonous. And they sold funny sandwiches that curled up a the edges.""

3. Censor Clips. These are two scenes that were edited out before broadcast in Australia. This makes them the ""only surviving footage from episodes 1 and 4"".
A. Polly is fighting and screaming as the doctors hold a syringe of something that will turn her into a fish person.
B. Professor Zaroff is drowning in his laboratory.

4. Photo Gallery

5. Commentary Track of a sort is available on all four episodes, moderated by superfan, Toby Hadoke. No subtitles are available for the commentary tracks.
....Episode 1. The commentary plays part of Toby Hadoke's interview with Michael Troughton, who talks about his father, Patrick, the 2nd Doctor.
Hadoke: ""Your brother, David, has been on 'Doctor Who' and you never did.""
Michael: ""I am so jealous! I can't tell you how jealous I am of David being on 'Doctor Who'!""
....Episodes 2 & 3. These have a regular commentary track. Commentators are Anneke Wills, Frazer Hines, Catherine Howe, Brian Hodgson (special sounds supervisor) and Quentin Mann (floor assistant).
Hodgson notes: ""I spent a lot of time blowing bubbles. Working with all sorts of strange wet stuff round the microphone.""
....Episode 4. Hadoke introduces excerpts from four archival interviews. The sound on these is a little fuzzy.
A. 1987 interview with Julia Smith (director)
B.  1986 interview with Hugh David, originally selected as director for the series. He declined the job after some research. Knowing ""Underwater Menace"" had underwater scenes, he called the production office of the recently completed James Bond film, ""Thunderball"", which had underwater shots: ""I said, I think my overall budget is ... three and a half thousand pounds."" He was discouraged to find out that the scenes in the movie had cost three million pounds.
C.  1983 interview with Innes Lloyd (producer).
D.  Interview with Patrick Troughton for Dr. Who Magazine. Troughton touches on many topics, including how he came to settle on his Doctor Who character: ""If you're going to be good and moral, it's totally boring. You've got to color it.""

It looks like this is the last of the Classic Doctor Who episodes we're likely to get.

8657249,1,B00KB614HQ,"Poorly reconstructed, the BBC continues to dredge the barrel with replacing missing episodes. They seem to think if they can just get it badly enough wrong the fans will stop asking for more. They also take advantage of the special features section to crap all over the product I had just bought; more than that I had pre ordered and waited through delay after delay to finally get something that is so self-denigrating in the special features it should probably see a therapist. WTF BBC?! Why?!
If you ignore what they say about it and how crappily it is presented the story is actually quite good. A classic Who story with the magnificent Patrick Troughton in full form!",1508889600,,672,4.703389830508475
8657250,3,B00KB614HQ,"What to say about this?  Quite a mixed bag, really.  As far as the serial itself goes, well, it's not one of the best that the fine Doctor has ever graced.  Patrick Troughton is terrific, in this the earliest (partially) existing serial of his tenure.  But the story is pretty silly, and the fish people are truly ridiculous.  Mind you, that's a part of the charm, but be prepared for what you're getting in for.  The photographic restoration of the missing episodes (1 and 4) isn't all that great.  It's not up to the standards of other telesnap reconstructions, for whatever reason.  Indeed, in Episode 4, it gets downright confusing figuring out what's going on.  On the other hand, the commentary tracks are first-rate.  Episodes 2 & 3 have cast (Frazer Hines, Anneke Wills, guest star Catherine Howe) and crew, and are quite charming.  Episode 1 has Patrick Troughton's son, remembering his father.  And Episode 4 has archival interviews with people involved in the making of Dr. Who who have since passed on, including Troughton himself.  Quite entertaining.",1490313600,,1064,4.910112359550562
8657251,3,B00KB614HQ,it is a still picture I hope they will redo this to animated since the episodes are missing.  Animated is better the still picture but for now having this is better then nothing until they do every one with animated well for the missing ones,1487635200,,241,4.355555555555555
8657252,3,B00KB614HQ,"If you already own the Lost in Time Collection of Rare Episodes, you already have Story 32, The Underwater Menace. Part 1 is largely a series of surviving stills against the audio track.",1483747200,,186,4.666666666666667
8657253,2,B00KB614HQ,"It's an amusing 1960s Doctor Who story and a must have for collectors. Normally with ""lost episodes"", I happily overlook the normal animation they produce in order to bring these stories back to life visually. In this case however, they really cheeped out. Some episodes are done with slide show type photos. You will literally be hearing audio while sometimes looking at images of things like a wall light or a pot floating/sinking in water for FAR TO LONG. I personally hope that at some point they will invest a little more money to do animation to replace the lost footage.",1483228800,,577,4.7227722772277225
8657254,4,B00KB614HQ,"As some of the participants stated in 1 of the worthy included extras there were better Patrick Troughton Dr. Who stories than this one which was not without its challenges during production. However, in retrospect it holds up well enough all things considered within the given budget limitations.",1483142400,,297,5.208333333333333
8657255,4,B00KB614HQ,"Although I do wish this one had been given the animation treatment that others were given, it was good to view. I did enjoy the plot, and it brought the novelization back to life I had read back in the 80's. It was also obvious Jamie had been added at the last minute, as Ben seemed not to have all that much to say. The Market scene got an involuntary chuckle from me, as did the comment about the Irishman and the gift of gab.(What can I say? The Doctor has my people pegged right.) The primary baddie certainly was not considering the aftermath of his actions, as his statement, ""Nothing in the world can stop me now!"" showed he hadn't done his sums yet. I will miss the monthly releases, but the BBC have only themselves to blame.",1481241600,,734,4.287769784172662
8657256,3,B00KB614HQ,"Just finished watching the Underwater Menace and was upset by the fact that the first and fourth episodes were not animated but pictures and the soundtrack. The overall story was very good but,having read the information on many websites, the end results of the dvd were sad, there was a reason the release date kept being moved back. If your are as BIG a fan of Doctor Who as I am I suggest you get this for your collection, but for those how want a little more, i'd go for a different dvd, like the Moonbase, Enemy of the World, or pre-order Power of the Daleks.",1480982400,,564,4.330188679245283

8657258,4,B00KB614HQ,"I bought the DVD because it includes the long lost Episode 2 that was recovered in 2011. Episode 3 had been recovered years earlier and I had seen it.  The best part of the this DVD was watching Episodes 2 and 3.  It is a shame that over 100 episodes of 1060's Doctor Who remain missing or lost.  So when one is recovered it is like finding a pot of gold for Whovians like me.

So it goes without saying that I loved watching Episodes 2 AND 3. The rest of the DVD uses photo snapshots from the original broadcasts with the original audio thanks to UK Who fans of the 1960's.  The thing about the photo snaps is that they could do much more with them to make them at least a little more interesting. And they do not do that here.  Whats's wrong with occasional pan or zoom on the photo snaps?  It would make it more alive.  And there are a couple of ""censored"" clips out there that could have been integrated into the snapshots. Yes, they show them in the DVD extras but why not includes them in the body of the DVD?

I thought one of the extras was odd. There was a piece that included Doctor #5 and his companions reminiscing about working for the BBC in the 1980's.  While it was entirely interesting I did not see this as having any relevance to the DVD at hand.  This might have been a better extra on one of Peter Davison's DVDs.

But generally, for a Who fan like me it is exciting to have 2 of the 4 episodes of this story and they have been cleaned up nicely to make it more watchable. I have the complete run of the available DVDs if the classic series that I started buying in 2000. My DVD shelf is full. For obsessed fans like me this DVD is a must!  For casual fans - you might skip it and go with one of the completed stories.",1479513600,,1739,4.079411764705882
