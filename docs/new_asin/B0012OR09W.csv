8247109,5,B0012OR09W,"Of the four recent versions of Don Pasquale choice can be reduced to two with two clear winners and two clear losers.

In this opera it is important to understand the respective roles of the 4 main characters in this story and how they should interact. This is not a straightforward comedy. It is a comment about relationships that might reflect some reality.

To take the title role of Don Pasquale first. This is a successful and wealthy man living in some luxury. He is in his 70s but still has his mental faculties intact. He is astonishingly generous as shown in two ways - his lengthy support of his nephew, but much more importantly, his apparent marriage settlement when he insists on handing over considerable operational and monetary control to his new `wife'. He must also be portrayed as having a sense of fairness and even humour as at the end he is able to give his blessing to Norina and his nephew without rancour. He must not be destroyed by humiliation therefore.

Norina is in fact a young widow who must appear to be just out of a convent. She must be attractive and compliant enough to attract both Pasquale and his nephew who is far too idle to take on a problem wife. She must show an awareness of the damage she does to Pasquale and show considerable remorse for this part so that their relationship can be believably retrieved by the end. Pasquale must not be so humiliated that he is destroyed.

The nephew is described by the chorus as an idle wastrel. He does not appear to work but lives a life of sponging. A domineering or shrewish woman would be far too much trouble for such a character.

The doctor Malatesta is a friend of Pasquale and this friendship must be salvaged by the end so it can continue without rancour therefore the planned deception has to avoid cruelty.

So how do the 4 versions compare with the above in mind?

The much favoured version of Netrebko at the Met fails on several counts. Netrebko is portrayed as a merciless shrew who also displays open dislike of Pasquale. She is the youngest but most flawed of the 4 Norinas for these reasons and is most unlikely to have attractions for Pasquale. In this production Pasquale is portrayed as somewhat dirty and unkempt - far from the type of character as described above. So two unbelievable roles featured here and my first rejection.

The coupling of Florez and Rey at Zurich is also flawed by Norina who lacks sympathy, is unyielding and verges on the shrewish too. Her voice is somewhat hard, like her characterisation, and she is simply too old to be a believable choice for either Pasquale or Florez. Pasquale is OK but rather too decrepit physically and shown to be too silly to be a believably successful man in business respects. This is my second rejection. Interestingly this version has been slated by the British reviewers (.co.uk) especially on grounds of recording quality and poor singing. There are 16 generally more favourable reviews by American reviewers (.com) for comparison. I have had no problem as regards recording quality using DTS on hi-fi quality equipment.

That brings us to the clear winners. Eva Mei (2002) is young and attractive enough to be believable. She has a light touch (see her in Falstaff) and she shows not only remorse at the crucial slap moment, but also considerable distress for Pasquale.

This leaves Pasquale able to retrieve his dignity later and therefore not to harbour deep grudges but simply to see the error of his wanting a much younger wife. His friendship with Malatesta can also be retrieved in this way. Pasquale in this production is a younger and stronger old man and there is no suggestion of his being destroyed or just being the butt of unpleasant behaviour.

The 2007 version with Ciofi is also excellent. Ciofi is older than Mei but wears her age remarkably well having a very good figure. She has a natural feel for light and shade in her physical and vocal acting and her role never becomes cruel. (She displays similar acting talents in an outstanding Daughter of the Regiment too). The age problem is solved by having a much younger Pasquale more matched to the older young widow of Ciofi as well as an older nephew who is also a better match therefore. This production has considerable presentational flair and Pasquale is even shown at the end to settle for a compensating and happy relationship with his cook!

Either of the last two performances would be safe final choices and I would suggest avoiding the versions with Netrebko and Isabel Rey for the reasons given above. All four recordings offer good sound with clear and sharp video work. Blu-ray is not the best option this time.

...........................

Since writing this comparative review a further contender has appeared and one which I would suggest may well be the best choice of all. That is the version conducted by Muti on Arthaus Musik and which is presented in both DVD and Blu-ray formats. The full review can be read under Don Pasquale / Muti.

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

Again, I am with you on your assessments of the 4.  (U.S. review)

Thanks again. Since writing this comparative review I have been recommended by another reviewer to try the Muti version. I followed his advice and would rate it up with the best too. I have a review posted on .co if you are interested. I cannot remember if I have already transferred it to .com yet but it will be there eventually!

You seldom mention the tenor. Agree that Ernesto is some what in the shadow in this piece dramatically, but I have concluded, after listening to the top Ernestos like Alfredo Kraus and Francisco Araiza, that this tenor role contains some of the most demanding, yet beautiful bel canto tenor music!
I have several versions of the Don Pasquale on CD - the Sciutti/Oncina; the Freni/Winbergh; the Popp/Araiza; plus the Rey/Florez DVD and Netrebko'Polenzani DVD.
Vocally, Kraus in 1973 is way better than his 1978 recording. Oncina had great difficulty in the first Act's recitatives, so did Winbergh! Polenzani did not sing the C sharp at the end of the Act 2 aria's cabaletta. Florez sung everything, but not as beauitful as Kraus or Araiza.  (U.S. review)

8247110,4,B0012OR09W,"I like this version of Don Pasquale very much.  On the negative side, vocal performances are good rather than great, failing to bring out the humor inherent in the original (sometimes adding ""gimmicks"" which do not always work).  On the other very plus side, this is a visual treat with pleasant sound, which creates a ""modern-day fairy tale"" where people of all ages can find love when they search in the right place(those ""gimmicks"" do work)!

8247111,2,B0012OR09W,"I am not even sure where to begin. Very few times it happens to me that I find almost nothing good to say about an opera production.
I am a great admirer of Patrizia Ciofi [main reason for me to buy this production] and while I did like her singing, I don't think she made a convincing Norina on stage [putting it mildly].
I think this production, taking Don Pasquale to a modern scene, totally distances it from the Opera Buffa / Commedia dell'arte style - one might like it - I didn't! Another reviewer wrote: ""This updated production of Don Pasquale is refreshingly original"" - I totally agree that it is original not so much with the ""refreshing"" - I usually enjoy the ""modernizing"" trend of new productions, because I have seen so many of the ""traditional"" ones, but this one, to my opinion, totally misses the spirit of Don Pasquale and the whole genre.
Worse of all, I thought it was the least funny Don Pasquale I have ever seen. I bought the DVD reading the great raves of fellow reviewers, and got it a day after watching the MET HD broadcast of Otto Schenk's production with Anna Netrebko, Matthew Polenzani, Mariusz Kwiecien, John Del Carlo. This might have been part of the reason for my great disappointment - what a difference!
Pasquale and Malatesta were nothing to write home about [both as actors and singers] and the rendition of their great duet was sub-par in my opinion. Ernesto [Norman Shankle] was a total non entity on the stage.
On another note, I thought the DVD quality was great both in video and sound. My second star [instead of one] goes to Patrizia Ciofi's rendition and DVD quality.
I feel uncomfortable with my very negative description, but in light of the other superb reviews, thought that fellow opera lovers should read a dissenting opinion.",1291334400,2,1781,4.639240506329114
8247112,4,B0012OR09W,"Three stars would be an offense given the artistry here, but I wish I could give it 3 1/2.  The other reviewers are right that it's a gorgeous, creative staging, clever and detailed.  I also agree that Norman Shankle gives a pleasing performance that is topped, however, by the animated characterization of Don Pasquale by Simone Alaimo.  This is a sympathetic portrayal of a middle-aged man, not a one-dimensional caricature!

But now that we've acknowledged the artistry, I have to say that in my opinion, Ciofi's portrayal of Norina lacked warmth and was too broadly acted, in terms of facial expressions, given the closeness of the camera-work.  The expressions lack softness and subtlety, which would be appropriate when playing to the back of the theater. But this Norina comes across as hard-edged even before she becomes ""Sofronia.""

If you're not rooting for the Norina and Ernesto, the whole story starts to unravel from an emotional involvement standpoint.  If Ciofi's bel canto singing here left one with one's mouth hanging open from amazement, one could forgive the lack of heart, but that's not the case here.  Style?  It's all there.  But heart?  It seems to be a matter of opinion.  This isn't a disc that I'll be watching a second time, and given that the opera seems fairly well represented on DVD, one might consider other versions before choosing.",1282780800,2,1368,4.951754385964913
8247113,4,B0012OR09W,"This updated production of Don Pasquale is refreshingly original, with a colorful set and entertaining use of the chorus.  Simone Alaimo's great comic performance as Don Pasquale is the highlight of the show.  Marzio Giossi's novel and expressive Dr. Malatesta, a psychiatrist, also earns high marks.

The first time I watched this, I thought Patrizia Ciofi's voice sounded washed out and I gave this opera only four stars.  After viewing it a second time, I changed my mind--too late as I can't give it another star.  She sounded her usual clear and powerful self, with nothing held back.

Norman Shankle as Ernesto sang well enough but he was the least animated actor of the production, dwarfed by the comic antics of the other players.

I love this opera and this production does it full justice.  Recommended!!!",1224460800,9,815,4.9411764705882355
8247114,5,B0012OR09W,"This is a marvelous production of Don Pasquale.  The principals, especially Patrizia Ciofi, all sing well, but--let's face it--Pasquale is one of those operetta-like vocal comedies that's not gonna get featured in many opera highlight reels.  In addition, however, to featuring fine singers, this cast is flush with splendid actors, and their comedy (especially again, Patrizia Ciofi) sparkles.  But what sets this Pasquale apart is everything else.  The set is magnificent; the costumes are magnificent; the choreography--especially that of the chorus--is magnificent; the color palette is fresh and original; the cinematography is so perfect that it's hard to believe that this was all shot in one take.  There is not a creative hair out of place in this radiant production, and when so many of a performance's  elements cohere as well as they do here, it makes for a delightful video(audio) experience of a fine opera.  [I would, however, recommend that you ""audio"" select the ""PCM stereo"".  As Mr. James mentioned (above), the orchestra can, at times, be a little too intrusive, especially with the extra surrounds].",1213920000,18,1120,5.288135593220339

8247116,5,B0012OR09W,"Having been very satisfied with the DVD of Don Pasquale from the Zurich Opera that I had recently purchased (see review on this website), I was surprised to see another new version advertised from the Grand Theatre in Geneva with Patrizia Ciofi appearing as Norina. As Miss Ciofi has recently become a great favorite of mine, I decided to go ahead and acquire this latest one.

I was slightly disappointed that the overture with Evelino Pido conducting the Suisse Romande Orchestra did not have the subtlety or exuberance that Nello Santi was able to achieve in Zurich but, as soon as the cameras were turned on the stage, I knew that this was going to be a fascinating and entertaining couple of hours viewing pleasure. The gradual forming of the opening set took place as the overture was ending and, instead of being set in Pasquale's home the location was a restaurant/bar with seats and tables on the sidewalk. The major elements of the stage set remained unchanged throughout the entire opera but clever accessories and furnishings which were changed in full view of the cameras during the performance, successfully transformed the street scene into the bachelor's residence of Don Pasquale, then the outrageously modern and refurbished interior created by the new woman of the house (Norina) and finally to an exterior courtyard of the same villa. The stylish fashions of the chorus and extras, in tones of black, white and gray in the first couple of acts, have been done before but perhaps never so pleasingly. The change to colorful sets and costumes in the latter part of the opera created a huge contrast to what had gone before.

Simone Alaimo, as Don Pasquale, appeared not as the senile fool as in some other versions but as a sprightly, and certainly not elderly, bachelor who probably regretted never having married and was a little envious of the many couples he seemed to see everywhere. Norina was also presented as a fashionable, extrovert, and attractive young woman able to charm everyone she came in contact with, and she seemed to be very successful financially. It was great to see an African American singer Norman Shankle take the romantic lead role of Ernesto and, while his voice may not be able to compete with that of Juan Diego Florez (and is there anyone who can at the moment), it was very pleasant and, teamed with his acting and presence on stage, complemented the remainder of the ensemble who all performed and sang extremely well.

I liked this version enormously; the singing and acting of all the participants was very good without having to resort to comical caricatures. The sets, costumes and wigs were extremely stylish and appropriate for this updated version of this work. Maybe the orchestra could have shown a little more restraint on occasion as not everything needed to be played so forcibly, however, summing up - good audio and video, highly recommended, great fun, and hugely enjoyable.",1210809600,33,2941,4.889779559118236
