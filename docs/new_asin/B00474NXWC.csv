4277753,5,B00474NXWC,"I'm not familiar with Kaplan's work but there was such a positive outpouring for this film it seemed senseless to not see it. I'm glad I did.

As pretty much everyone has mentioned, this is an updating of the Cinderella story set in New York's Chinatown. The story was adapted well. The characters are all well realized. Yes the step sisters are nasty but they're nasty in a believable way given their station. They aren't two dimensional cartoon nasties. Likewise, ""mom"" is a great nasty. Like the step sisters there is real gravity in her character. The fact that it is alluded to that she has a drug problem puts that extra bit of scariness in her. Her lecherous brother is also interesting. He's not just a bad guy. He's more pitiful and seems he might, himself, be under the thumb of ""mom."" The hero, Johnny, is a way cool guy. A kind-hearted musician who you can't help but root for.

I was a bit hesitant to see this only because of the digital roboscoping technique used in the filming. That (or a similar technique) was used in ""A Scanner Darkly"" and I found it distracting. Here however it's used to great effect. It's much more subtle and is altered throughout to enhance the mood of a given scene. At times I thought I was seeing paintings from some of the great impressionists. This is a fascinating movie to watch.

I cannot say enough about this. For my money everything was just right. The plot elements were adapted well. The performances were good. The look was good. The music score was outstanding. There was nothing too cute or too maudlin. The elements were all graced with a deft touch.

Having grown up on Disney, it's easy to think I couldn't go back to something like this. That fairy tales are set a certain way and that's it. Not the case here. This is a great film by any standard and deserves a wide audience.",1297382400,,1839,4.497005988023952
4277754,5,B00474NXWC,"A re-imagining of Cinderella set in a massage parlor in New York's Chinatown, David Kaplan's film juxtaposes grime and exploitation with winsomeness and superstition.  A masterpiece of the 21st century.",1297123200,,202,5.733333333333333
4277755,5,B00474NXWC,"I saw Year of the Fish when it came through the Honolulu International Film Festival. It was amazing to see it on the big screen in a theatrical presentation. David's use of animation is visually stunning, and the beautiful animation effects never get in the way of telling the story. Quite the opposite, they always work to enhance the mood and story line of the film. David rotoscope animated the entire film from his original DV camera footage using a software program called Studio Artist.

4277756,4,B00474NXWC,"Adult themes. Not for children. Uniquely done using the amazing Studio Artist application (one of my favorites), this is an emotionally engaging film. Although filmed, the entire film was then painted. It did not get an adequate public release, which is disappointing. I can't quite give it five stars, but I'd give it over four. Some fine acting, especially by Randall Duk Kim who played three great parts. It took me forever to find a version I could watch. I was finally able to find a rental copy through AppleTV. As far as I know, this film is unrated. Some nudity. Adult situations. No sex. Rare language. Some violence, though not close to other films. I would suggest it might be a PG-13, though a good argument could be made that it should be an R. From several perspectives, this is art. Though a low budget movie, its story holds its own against movies costing far more to make. I am hoping to be able to find and purchase a copy.",1286928000,7,941,4.508771929824562
4277757,5,B00474NXWC,"This is a wonderful film, produced by David Kaplan. A live action fairy tale shot in New York City's Chinatown, it is a Cinderella story unlike anything released by the major cartoon studios which includes, in addition to significant adult themes, many recognizable folk and fairy tale elements - a talking fish, a character based on the Russian witch Baba Yaga and the essential ""They all lived happily ever after."" Newly released on DVD, this is a must see movie.",1261526400,11,465,4.825

4277772,3,B00474NXWC,"I enjoyed this grown up fairy tale.  I found the juxtaposition of fairy tale vs adult themes a little disconcerting. This is not a movie for young kids. It is set in a ""massage parlor"" and the protagonist is told at one point that she'd be better off learning to ""s*** c***"".  Found myself trying to figure out why Baba Yaga (from Russian Fairy tales) is showing up in a Chinese story. Don't they have any scary morally ambiguous magical creatures in Chinese folklore?  The digital effects confused me.  I don't completely understand the digital painting method but I liked it. Some of the images looked like fine art, some looked liked cartoons (Baba- specifically)  and some just looked liked actors acting.  It sort of looked like they filmed the whole thing in the regular manner and then added some kind of filter to it.  I tried and succeeded in finally putting aside all these questions while watching the movie and just sat back and enjoyed it. Loved that orange raincoat.  All the actors did a great job.",1449100800,,1013,4.651685393258427
4277773,5,B00474NXWC,"What a wonderful, thoroughly charming tale. This is a Chinese adaptation of Cinderella and its just as endearing too. This version takes place in Chinatown, NY and its carried by a cast each of whom deliver a sincere performance. I fell in love with the main actress Tsai Chin, who is so delightful she kept me engrossed from the moment she enters. The tale is heartwarming, simple and filled with Chinese magic.",1449014400,,412,4.736111111111111
4277774,1,B00474NXWC,"Was into the film until I got to the scene with the stereotypical Latino ""thugs.""

4277776,4,B00474NXWC,"Really a lovely retelling, not for children, but for adults. The story was original and the characters engaging. Some of the effects with the ""roboscoping"" were weird, but it did render live action into a half-animated look that had a certain charm.

4277789,2,B00474NXWC,"It was a Chinese attempt at a Cinderella-like story. Girls parents die and she is in a bad situation with a mother-like figure who mistreats her and makes her scrub the toilets and floors. Girl is mistreated by her new fellow co-workers at a massage parlor. Girl finds a hunchback, blind, fortune-telling ""fairy godmother"" that gives her a fish and ends up sending her off to a Chinese New Year celebration to find her accordion-playing ""prince"". I can appreciate the odd story line in between and cultural differences this version possesses over other versions I have seen.

4277790,5,B00474NXWC,"Cried my eyes out. Sweet, stylish, the perfect grown-up fairy tale without being kitchy or coy. Haven't seen anything like this in a long time. The director understands that fairy tales weren't originally intended for children. And if you've ever been to Chinatown, it captures the neighborhood beautifully.",1422662400,,307,5.416666666666667

4277794,4,B00474NXWC,"I may be a sentimental fool, but I was utterly won over by the charm of this film, an updating of the Cinderella story in terms of Chinese Americans living in New York.  Lots of magical realism, but at the same time, gritty and unflinching in terms of what the world can be like.  Wonderful performances by the lead and supporting actors, well defined characters.  As for negatives, I found the computer graphics manipulation of the images unnecessary, if not distracting at times, and was a little confused by the witch figure, but this may be a shortcoming on my part and future viewings may make me cough up another star.",1407456000,,624,4.603603603603603

4277797,5,B00474NXWC,"While the snippet about the movie says it's animated, in actuality it employs a posterized effect that takes a bit of getting used to, yet works well with the story line. I found the movie very engaging, partially because of the somewhat surreal images enhanced by this treatment. As suggested, the plot is reminiscent of the classic Cinderella story and revolves around a Chinese girl caught in a web of jealousy and conflict in modern China Town. The story is well written, nicely directed, and worth watching from all standpoints.",1401321600,,533,4.933333333333334
4277798,5,B00474NXWC,Just a good ol'fashioned love story.  Some of the supporting actors were a bit one dimensional but the principals were solid.  This story would also work on the stage if it hadn't originated there already.  Enjoy!,1393545600,,213,4.861111111111111
4277799,3,B00474NXWC,This really was a Cinderella story. Everything about it was slightly above average for an indy film on a budget. The acting or the parts as written were a bit too cliche for my real enjoyment. The setting was different which enhanced things. You must be a romantic for this.,1388707200,2,274,4.5
4277800,5,B00474NXWC,"""Cinderella"" has always been my favorite fairy tale.  I really enjoyed this Asian version that was filmed in NYC.

As a previous reviewer wrote, it is wise to realize that ""Year of the Fish"" is filmed with a digital painting technique.  For some people, I could see how this aspect would not be appealing.  However, I found it especially touching when the director would focus distinctly upon the faces of our heroine and her ""prince"".  This technique displayed so well the confusion, appeal and eventual realization of how the two characters connect with a gentle smile touched with tenderness.

I was also especially impressed with the actress playing Mrs. Su as the ""stepmother"" element.  Her final line in the movie shows the sadness/bitterness that can come from falling in love and its real-life consequences.  It fleshes out a slight subtext beyond what lies behind her hard and cruel exterior.

Ye Xian as Cinderella and Johnny as the ""prince"" have beautiful chemistry together and truly were well cast in their roles.

I recommend it to ""Cinderella"" fans and for those who have interest in Asian culture.  The commentary from the director helped me understand what was ""authentic"" about certain Asian scenes of the film and what he had borrowed from other ethnic cultures.",1384128000,5,1281,4.995283018867925
4277801,4,B00474NXWC,It was a unique take on the Cinderalla story. Because of the Asian influence it was subdued but well done.,1381449600,,106,4.35
4277802,3,B00474NXWC,"This sort of modern Cinderella tale has an interesting twist. If you want something different, it's worth seeing. If you're expecting intense drama, not my recommendation.",1371945600,,171,5.615384615384615
4277803,4,B00474NXWC,"Good movie, but a bit sensationalized with the visual effects and character development.  An indentured servant thinking she was going to have an honorable job instead gets offered a job as a masseuse, which she refuses, and instead, works as a janitor and cook at the massage parlor.",1361664000,2,284,4.916666666666667
4277804,5,B00474NXWC,Really liked how the movie was made.  Very good story line and a lot of emotion from some of the actors.  Would certainly recommend.,1357257600,,132,4.458333333333333
4277805,5,B00474NXWC,"this was a beautifully told film about a very relevant social issue. trafficking in the sex trade is a ongoing disgrace in today's society where we emphasize 'freedom' and Democracy. yet many still live in literal slavery and servitude. young woman, like the protagonist in this film, are often told that they ""owe"" their captors money and have to work to pay a ""debt"".
  so much of this movie was depressingly all too real. however, it is strangely told with a lightness of touch and is often very whimsical and other worldly. it's very look brings a new meaning to the term film as a art. it is literally a film that is done in bright, splashy, painted colors. this is due to it's being done in a rotoscoping, color process similar to 'A Scanner Darkly'. the process is used here with more purpose and effectiveness. the film is supposed to look much like a water color painting and it justifies it's colored look more pointedly.
  David Kaplan is a brilliant film director. so far he always works on a modest budget and manages still to capture so much fantasy and vision that other film's can only hope to achieve with their over-blown, multi-million dollar budgets. like his 'Red Riding Hood' masterpiece, this film digs deep into our collective folklore, re-creates it and fashions it into something that is traditional, but even more humanized and with more complexity than the original source material.
  i only recently discovered Kaplan and i'm so glad i did. his cinema is rewarding and enriching and very intelligently conceived. they are also fully loaded with exquisite surrealism that is both entertaining and often mind blowing. this is a really great little movie.",1335312000,2,1681,4.839721254355401
4277806,4,B00474NXWC,"""Year of the Fish""  is a modern-day adaptation of a ninth-century Chinese Cinderella story, the oldest known record of the tale, written 800 years before the European versions.  A lovely young girl named Ye Xian (An Nguyen) travels alone to New York City to try to earn money for her sick father back home in China.  She is employed by Mrs. Su (Tsai Chin), who runs a massage parlor in the heart of Chinatown.  Ye Xian refuses to do the sex work, so she is made into a lowly servant who must do all the laundry, cleaning, shopping, and cooking.  Her only comforts are an enchanted fish given to her by the mysterious hunchback Auntie Yaga (Randall Duk Kim) and her fleeting encounters with the handsome Johnny (Ken Leung), a struggling jazz musician.

The film was shot entirely in New York City's Chinatown.  A digital painting technique transforms the live action into a striking, evocative animated movie.  The effect is a painting come to life and adds to the fairy-tale feel of the story.

Bonus features include audio commentaries with the director and cast members and a behind-the-scenes look at the rotoscoping process, early rotoscoping techniques, and before-and-after rotoscoping images.",1297814400,2,1199,4.955

8417724,5,B00474NXWC,"I'm a big fan of ""re-imagined"" fairy tales, whether written, filmed, or animated... and this one did NOT disappoint!

Word of caution though... this movie is meant for adult viewing, not for children. No nakedness or sex, but enough that kids shouldn't watch it. Besides the setting, there's some very harsh events, reminiscent of the original fairy tales where bad things did happen.

The description says ""animated"", but it's not actually animated. It was filmed live, then a filter was added to ""posterize"" the images so they looked painted. It softened the film, getting rid of hard lines, which I think gave it a more dream-like or imaginary look.

Tsai Chin was just delightful as our Cinderella, so sweet and innocent! I was very worried for her character because of where she had to work, but she was able to avoid tarnishing her honor. Our ""prince charming"" in this story isn't a ruler or wealthy, but was rich in integrity.",1500336000,,933,4.81875
8417725,5,B00474NXWC,I like how this story started and ended. Each actor and actress played a good role in the film. I was getting worried for Ye Xian and of course her fish. I will definitely watch this again!!,1493942400,,190,4.162162162162162

8417731,2,B00474NXWC,"OK but the graphic style is dated and takes away from the movie story and degrades the presentation.  A modern twist on Cinderella meets Pretty Woman, a rags to happily ever after type movie, but one never feels the beauty component with the main character.  The magic is just not there.  The price charming is neither a price or really that charming.  The magical component is also a bit weird almost creepy.  Not sure why this movie is anything special to watch other than one feels the main character has integrity and deserves to be victorious.  Not enough to make the movie worth your time to watch.",1471564800,,604,4.598130841121495
