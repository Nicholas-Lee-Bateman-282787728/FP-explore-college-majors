2857661,5,B000R349I4,"I enjoy the detail with which David Starkey relates British history.  He is entertaining while also providing a real education about the British monarchy.  I bought both of his Monarchy series, and watch them over again.  I recommend highly.",1277424000,,241,5.128205128205129
2857662,4,B000R349I4,"This is good watching...although I didn't really need all the acted out scenes... What is it about people who need to see actors playing historical characters...even in a documentary. Starkey is an excellent narrator, even if he periodically insults the actual monarchy (in other forums) while making his money talking about them... All in all an excellent way to spend some free time.",1243123200,7,385,5.126984126984127
2857663,4,B000R349I4,"I know the title of this collection is ""Monarchy"" but the history of the monarchy in England is the history of England.  This rendition is particularly good.  The backgrounds for the telling of the history are the actual places the events took place.  The art, architecture, and scenery are very much a part of the telling.  The programs are informative and beautiful.  Part 1 of this two part series is just as good!",1240185600,8,417,4.657534246575342
2857664,5,B000R349I4,A bit too much of David Starky and not enough of views and re-enactments to hold my kids attention.  shame.,1237161600,2,107,4.35
2857665,4,B000R349I4,A continuation of the first set of Monarchy. Quite interesting and informative if you are into English history.,1227398400,4,111,5.222222222222222
2857666,5,B000R349I4,"Excellent documentary of the British monarchy.  As a couple of anglophiles and history buffs, my wife and I enjoyed it very much.  I highly recommend it to anyone with similar interests.",1205193600,13,186,4.967741935483871
2857667,5,B000R349I4,I very much enjoyed this dvd.  I have always wondered about the Kings and Queens of England.  There seem to be so many and it is hard to tell what time period they fit into.  The Monarchy gives you all the facts whithout a bunch of useless information.,1198800000,11,252,4.208333333333333
8198619,2,B000R349I4,"I had received the first Monarchy (the complete series) as a gift and loved it.  It ended with Queen Victoria, so I was expecting Set 2 to continue to the present day.  Instead, it was a rehash of histories from King Charles II and again ended with Queen Victoria.  Informative, but still disappointing.  This was NOT what I was expecting.  If you have the first set, DO  NOT get this one.",1492300800,5,389,4.408450704225352
8198620,3,B000R349I4,Not as good as set 1. There were less re-enactments with live actors. Mostly David talking into a camera while they showed pictures. Netflix never offered this set and I can see why.,1484092800,,182,4.545454545454546

8198622,4,B000R349I4,"Fascinating history, but a bit uneven in the amount of time given to each monarch and somewhat redundant. I do wish they had not included gruesome scenes (not as bad as the abattoir shots in the first series whenever they talked about drawing and quartering commoner traitors). Dr. Starkey's commentary is dramatic and ""veddy"" English, although I can't fathom why he pronounced every French word, including France, with a proper French accent except pronouncing the ells in guillotine. Most of all, this second set made me want to spend time visiting castles, palaces, cathedrals and chapels in England.",1430179200,2,603,5.163265306122449

8198625,3,B000R349I4,"This was OK and had a lot of information about the history of the British Monarchy.  I am a big history buff, and I especially enjoy learning anything about the Monarchy.  Even so, I found it a little difficult to watch this.  It was OK, but it wasn't GREAT!  David Starkey's voice inflection was a little difficult to understand throughout this DVD.  I would still recommend this for anyone interested in learning about the Monarchy and the various Kings and Queens that shaped Britain into what it is today.",1408147200,2,509,4.674157303370786
8198626,5,B000R349I4,"Absolutely awesome series which chronicles the Kings and Queens of England throughout history.  This one was part 2 which covers more recent events which date after the reigns of King Henry VIII and his children to the present.  Set 1 is a bit more exciting in that it covers the likes of Henry VIII, the War of the Roses and King Edward I....but as a whole the series is just fascinating.

For anyone interested in the history of the monarchy in England, this is certainly well worth it.",1408060800,4,488,4.5227272727272725
8198627,5,B000R349I4,DAVID STARKEY MAKES GREAT DOCUMENTRIES. WELL MADE AND EDUCATIONAL. ALSO VERY THOUROUGH. ALOT OF ART WORK AND PICTURES. THIS WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY.,1336694400,,149,5.25
8198628,5,B000R349I4,"I'll watch almost any history DVD.  I just love history, having majored in it as as undergraduate.  English history was always my favorite.  I know a lot about British history, but tend to get my kings, queens and timelines mixed up.  David Starkey does a great job of showing how it all fits together.  He doesn't beat you over the head with information, but imparts just enough to understand what went on.  He also includes interesting tidbits about important (and not so important) characters that enliven this really worthwhile DVD.  Get Part 1 too.  It's just as interesting.",1333584000,2,580,4.846938775510204
