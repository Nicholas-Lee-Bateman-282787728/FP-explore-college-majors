8731747,5,B006QXCINW,"I am a long time guitar player and habitual surfer for free lessons on youtube.  I ran across an arrangement of ""Georgia"" by Joe and was really impressed first by the arrangement and then by his ability to explain what he was doing without going too slowly or getting bogged down.  I decided to actually purchase this dvd and am very glad I did.  I am a dabbler in all styles (from rock to chet to jazz and country) and Joe presents a little of all these styles in a clear no nonsense and practical way.  He simplifies complex ideas and makes them instantly usable for a working musician. The amount of information in this dvd (and this is only disc 2) is astounding.  I obviously recommend it to any serious guitarist and as a disclaimer....I do not know Joe.",1490400000,,760,4.4
