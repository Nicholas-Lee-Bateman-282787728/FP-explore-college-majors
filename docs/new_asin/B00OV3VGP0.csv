6764584,5,B00OV3VGP0,"This movie was OUTSTANDING!  Although the very beginning was emotionally draining, it was an awesome movie.  So well done...so well choreographed that Keanu Reeves' fighting scenes flowed like artwork.  If you saw the promo, you already know that John Wick is/was a real tough guy.  (He actually gave up the hard life and settled down.)  When his wife died, he was devistated, until a package was delivered.  She had ordered him a puppy to ease his pain after she passed on.  Shortly after, some bad guys from a Russian mob broke into his place, beat the heck out of him, and killed the dog.  Again, all this was in the promo, and in the very beginning of the movie.

To say he was upset, would be a severe understantement.  Of course, he goes after these guys bent on revenge.  It is a very intense and very violent movie, but DARN it was good!  My son saw a special, explaining that Keanu learned his moves for ""The Matrix"".  Keanu was in his prime.  I definitely plan on buying the movie for my collection.

Of course, not for children.  Very violent.  Take some kleenex for the beginning.  If you don't need them, hand them to the person next to you.",1414281600,350,1154,4.466346153846154
6764585,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Reeves gets drawn back into a lifestyle he thought he had left behind.
Don't those crazy Russian mobsters ever learn???
I mean they brought their destruction upon themselves in the Equalizer and now another group draws their destruction upon themselves in this movie.
They are always doomed..  sort of like the Indians in the old Cowboy westerns...

But seriously...  lots of gunfire, lots of hand to hand combat...  some muscle cars from both by-gone days and a new one..  what more do you want?

The plot...  in case it matters...  some doofs steal Keaneau's car and kill his dog that his recently deceased wife left for him to get over her death.
That does it...  that just friggin does it..  you don't steal his car and kill his dog... :)

6764586,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Our hero retired after a successful career as a legendary hit man, but as a lark, some crooks took every last thing he cared about. Now he's mad!

Co-directed by David Leitch and Chad Stahelski from an R-rated script by Derek Kolstad (""The Package""), this action/thriller boasts endless gunfire, fisticuffs, martial arts, vehicular mayhem and even some blowie uppie stuff. The script is just witty enough to generate laughter in the screening audience, so everyone went home happy.

We watch:
  * Keanu Reeves (""47 Ronin"") is our eponymous hero, mourning his lovely wife and the all-to-brief life they had enjoyed together.
  * Michael Nyqvist (""Disconnect"") Viggo has been in business with Wick so he knows what happens when you get on his wrong side.
  * Alfie Allen (""Game of Thrones"") Iosef is Viggo's son. He gets on Wick's wrong side!
  * Ian McShane (""Hercules"") Winston owns the Continental Hotel. Patrons MUST abide by the house rules or pay the penalty.
  * Willem Dafoe (""The Fault in Our Stars"") Marcus is the hit man hired to put an end to all the violence.
  * Lance Reddick (""The Wire"") is delicious as the Hotel Manager who combines impeccable manners with wry understatement.

The bad guys are Russian mobsters; the money involved is astronomical; and the violence is endless. Clichs are served up with a straight face (they killed his dog!) and the climactic struggle is (naturally) fought in the rain. To me, this felt more like a cartoon than an actual situation, so I felt free to yawn during the violence and enjoy the humorous bits. (At least other reviews had warned me about the dog.)",1414195200,15,1609,4.821167883211679

The scenes of gun violence (which is pretty much the whole movie) are so well-choreographed that they look like martial arts fight scenes where guns are substituted for fists and feet.

The movie overall is pretty good (or more accurately, it's not bad). The acting is decent, and nearly every major character actor from the last 30 years has a brief role somewhere in this movie.

6764590,4,B00OV3VGP0,"With its emphasis on retro-hip craft and a detached storyline populated with self-conscious graphic-novel absurdities, John Wick is a solid example of a fashionable and largely fat-free contemporary action film.  It stars Keanu Reeves as the title character, a former hit man turned suburban square whose wife has just died.  Her parting gift to him is a dog.  When a gangster's son and his henchmen beat the dog to death during a home invasion, John flies into a rage and plots a campaign of vengeance.  Step one:  he goes into his basement with a sledgehammer to recover a substantial arms cache beneath the concrete.  Reeves is not the most demonstrative or nuanced performer, but this role fits him snugly, almost as if this were a sequel and he were reprising the part of this chic and distant action hero who moves with grace and wears a well-tailored suit with aplomb.

The film's finest points are its action sequences and its world building.  John navigates a distinctive and extra-cinematic criminal underworld.  Payments and bribes come in the form of gold coins.  A hotel, the Continental, is a neutral zone where no ""business"" is allowed.  A phoned-in dinner reservation for 12 is code for a dozen corpses requiring disposal.  There are many such playful details, and a couple distinctive actors, including Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane, briefly show up as former peers in the rogue's gallery John left behind.  When violence erupts, the result is filmed with clarity and a tantalizing sense of motion and strategy.  A second-act nightclub showdown is a dance of gunfire and hand-to-hand combat on par with vintage John Woo spectacles or either of the celebrated Raid films.  Unfortunately, this grand sequence also proves a tad problematic because it represents a culmination of the previously building tension, and, in my opinion, the film begins to lose steam afterward.  Perhaps because John is just shown to be too adept an assassin and kicker of Eastern European butt, so the home stretch's bid to even the odds and place him in danger are contrived, strained, and not as fun as what came before.",1414195200,,2114,4.946175637393767

Unfortunately for the scum that took his wife's last gift, John Wick is the person who is sent to kill the Boogeyman. Watch it and decide for yourself.

_________________________________________________________

After a disappointing reception to Carl Rinsch's `47 Ronin`, Keanu Reeves returns to action in this gritty hard hitting film about a man seeking for vengeance against those who took everything away from him. Director's David Leitch and Chad Stahelski helm the film as Lionsgate presents a return to fashion when one day John Wick loses everything to the son of a mob, Iosef. After realizing that John Wick isn't no ordinary man the mobs men are on high alert as Wick makes his way through the city searching for Iosef and as he continually threatens his former boss Viggo in giving his son up. This action packed film leaves you highly entertained and is a definite reprieve from Reeve's last outing.

Let's start with the marketing because going into it I knew very little of what we could expect in `John Wick` from just the trailer. However, there wasn't enough exposure in theaters or television for audiences to get pumped up for the film. It's almost similar to the marketing of Doug Liman's `Edge Of Tomorrow` (review here) that although received praise not only by critics but the majority of audiences who went to see the film didn't even know or were put off by the poorly conceived trailer. What will happen here though is with good word-of-mouth people will begin to take notice on `John Wick` that it will succeed in the end but not to the expectations the studio hoped it would be.

Keanu Reeves was amazing in `John Wick` cause he kicked major butt as an ex-hitman who worked for Viggo (Michael Nyqvist) before going into retirement. They set up Wick's character to where you got to know him personally as he loses the love of his life due to an illness. Then when he receives a dog by his late wife in the will left to him your moved by the words she leaves for him. You can connect with Wick as a person and somebody who isn't treated as a god or an indestructible machine.  One of my pet peeves with protagonists is that they show no signs of weakness as your left to assume they are unstoppable; just like in Denzel Washington's `The Equalizer`. So to watch John Wick get physically and mentally challenged there's an added element of suspense.

All I can say about the non-stop action in the movie is: WOW!! Your taken away by Keanu Reeve's performance that he really showed technique and style to his character of John. He kills nearly 30 or more people in the film and in so many clever ways as he's quick to take out Viggo's men to get to his son Iosef (Alfie Allen). And all of this is due to Iosef running into John at a gas station and confronts him about his car while not knowing who Iosef was dealing with. Reeve's character is smart, quick, and calculative as he's nearly dominate in his altercations with the mobs-men.

The supporting cast did what was asked in terms of fulfilling the plot as they were overshadowed by Keanu Reeves. One that did stand out and caught my attention was Adrianne Palicki's character of Ms. Perkins who works at an establishment and tries to take out John Wick. There's a scene where she puts up a fight and takes some pretty tough shots by Wick in his hotel room. She looked to be a formidable opponent who spies on Wick even after his altercations with the mob. Another mention goes to Willem DaFoe's character of Marcus. Although his role is minor he plays a fitting friend to Wick and your even thrown in for a loop when your made to assume he'll be trying to go after his best friend John Wick.

As serious as the film makes it out to be with the violence your left with moments of comedy. Added humor in between takes of the action was nice and sometimes unexpected. It reminded me of Liam Neeson's `A Walk Among The Tombstones` where Neeson's character had wit with the killers on the loose. What was interesting too was how nonchalant John Wick did his business and even the police were not to get in the way of his work. From the police to Wick's close friends and associates they get out of the way of the carnage and leave the business to Wick. One of the funniest things we see is a clean-up crew who come to Wick's house after mob members try to kill him. After-wards a salvage crew arrives and returns the house to normal by cleaning up the mess.

I mentioned Denzel Washington in `The Equalizer` earlier because unlike his character, here they give focus to John Wick's background and they show vulnerability in Reeve so you can connect with him at some level. I will say where the film suffers like in `The Equalizer' is that the end-game becomes lackluster when Wick finally gets to Iosef as the final encounter between the two is over in two seconds. But to it's credit, Wick does show weakness when he's shot or stabbed or attacked that by the time he gets to Iosef nothing at this point will stop him. I see so many similarities between Denzel and Keanu that as a fantasy I see them combating one another after their recent performances; we could even add Liam Neeson into the mix. That would be an epic clash of some of the best actors in Hollywood who would spare off in a tangible storyline. We'll leave that to the studios to ponder about.

Not getting the right amount marketing it deserves, `John Wick` is a fun ride that never puts on the brakes. Your constantly stuck to the screen as Keanu Reeve's battles the mobs-men to oblivion. After watching it you'll be tempted to re-watch it because of how smart and gritty the experience is. Most definitely a return for Reeves in this solid based action movie by director's David Leitch and Chad Stahelski that's one hell of a rush.",1414108800,2,5682,4.551859099804306

Take away that precious gift from an assassin that fellow assassins and hoodlums fear, and youve taken the leash off the beast. John Wick is a non-stop bloody action-filled movie that thankfully minimizes the gore while maximizing the body count. But watching John Wick in action is somehow at times catharsis for our loss of hope and happy endings.

6764688,2,B00OV3VGP0,"I really wanted to love this movie... I really, really did. But at its core, John Wick is a thinly plotted, over-the-hill action movie.

First, the good:
The cinematography, set design, lighting, and wardrobe is great. Some really nice imagery that puts you right into the John Wick fantasy world. There are also some great 'freeze frames' where John Wick looks like an absolute bad*** - so I understand the fans loving that aspect. Also, Keanu is handsome and brooding as usual. If that's what you came for, you might just like it.

The bad:
The plot is very weak. We never get a back-story, and the characters have no depth. They are given very few choices, and the choices they do make almost no human being would relate to (in fact, my girlfriend interrupted the movie several times laughing at me because I was apparently making ""WTF?"" gestures without realizing it). I kept hoping for some amazing twist to shock me out of my quiet head-shaking, but alas there was none (well, there was one small but predictable twist involving Willem Defoe's minor character, but that's really it).
Also, the close-up fight scenes are terribly choreographed. I mean, like cringe-inducingly bad. Even the worst movie can be somewhat 'saved' by great action sequences, but if that was the goal they should have budgeted the extra cost required to convince us a 50-year old Keanu can move like a young Jason Bourne (spoiler: he can't. not even close).",1530316800,,1439,4.798387096774194

All you have to do is skim the one-star reviews and look at the grammatical skills of the reviewers. The audacity of these people to call anything else stupid is pretty astounding. At least these one-star dummies are in the minority and a Trilogy of movies will highlight their meaningless opinions. No, they did not actually kill a living puppy for the making of this film, but Wick's (a fictional character) dog was killed at the beginning of the film to justify his rampage. A hitman chose a life of peace, but soon after his wife dies from a terminal illness and her final gift was taken from him. A professional killer would have a different reaction than a barista. Why do people need this explain? For the people thinking he is not old enough to play this character Keanu Reeves is now in his late 40s or early 50s",1522972800,,991,4.573033707865169

Reeves plays a retired hit man who is a legendary Bogeyman to other hit men. Several people (very) politely ask, ""you workin' again, John?""

Of course no one in the universe could suffer this physical abuse and still function, but the fight and gunfight scenes are as carefully crafted as the Borne movies.

6765064,5,B00OV3VGP0,"John Wick is grieving and angry, very angry. His wife just passed away. In addition the son of a Russian mobster just broke into his home, beat him up with the help of his gang, stole his car and killed his new puppy that was a gift from his dead wife.

John is a retired master assassin for the mob and he was the best in the world at his trade. He is called the Boogeyman in some circles as you never see him coming and you stand no chance to stop him.

He is coming after the mobsters son and nothing can stop him from seeking and getting his revenge.

This is a bloody and violent movie and if you like that style of film then this is one you should own. I purchased the BluRay version with the DVD and also a digital HD movie with it. I downloaded a VUDU HDX and I streamed it to my digital projector. Both the HDX digital movie and the BluRay disc had excellent video and audio.

I liked this film and gave it 5 stars for being entertaining and action filled.

I watched the trailer, and the premise seemed okay. A revenge tale with lots of shooting. I wasn't very hyped about it.

That's 'nuff said but I'm sure to leave it that wd garner some negative feedback.

This is basic blood-and-guts but with panache and some nice imaginative touches  the whole concept of the hotel, e.g.

You also get to see a TON of actors you surely like, if you like movies.

And they, there's Keanu Reeves, whose movies are always a crapshoot. Are they going to be truly terrible, or perhaps passable, or maybe even doggy-head-tilt decent. This is mash-up of all three, with an emphasis on the first two.

Keanu is a real deal gun guy (as opposed to so many of the Hollywood actors) with actual practical shooting skills, and brings that to this movie. He works closely with Taran Butler on his 3 gun skills and it absolutely shows in this movie. Also, this is the first movie I have seen to features the Center Axis Relock technique of defensive pistol craft. It is refreshing to see an action movie that  foregoes the typical ""hollywood guns"" approach and applies some actual martial disciplines into the action sequences.

6765257,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Ok, it is a pulp fiction quality movie. Kill lots of things, mess up lots of stuff. Don't pay much attention
to the plot. Now that is out of the way, this movie is a guilty pleasure similar to watching young women jump up and down.
Ashamed of yourself but it is enjoyable.  Sometimes you just have to have fun even if your girlfriend looks at you like
you are a creep. (Secretly she is having a little bit of fun too.)

(Spoiler alert: stop reading now. Besides it is all in the trailer.)
The plot is very simple. Really stupid kid wants to buy John Wick's car. John will not sell so the moron breaks in,
kills John's dog and steals his car. Beats up John.  Wants to put the car through a chop shop and then things start
to go wrong. Moron's dad gets in the action. Sends lots of meat for John to slaughter. Here comes John.  If you
care about the plot then forget this movie. The fun is watching Keanu kick some butt. You want a great movie in this genre,
watch Eastern Promises. You want guilty fun, watch John Wick or Tom and Jerry cartoons.",1510704000,,1044,4.17910447761194

6765270,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Bought this on the recommendation of my brother who flipped when he heard that I hadn't watched it. He assured me that it's worth owning and it's incredible. He wasn't just hyping it up. It's a simple tale of revenge with a tragic protagonist, both elements I love. The way it's dished out is smart and savvy as John Wick progresses. It has an excellent cast who shine on screen. I love how John is portrayed by Keanu Reeves. He reluctantly steps back into the world he left behind. With each step closer to his revenge he shows how unforgiving he is, but also keeps a sense of humanity and civility. Letting someone go who he is familiar with when he knows they have nothing to do with his quest with a ""why don't you take the night off"" shows professionalism and class. The action sequences are a ballet of bullets and martial artistry I honestly thought Reeves was incapable of. Easily, this is the best action movie I have seen this year, and it was released three years ago. For buying something on one man's recommendation when I have not seen it, I am definitely not regretting it. If you haven't seen it, just do what I did and buy it here. One of the best $10 I ever spent.",1510358400,,1182,4.352941176470588

I LOVED Constantine (and Matrix and Man of Tai Chi... he plays dark so well lately.) and so many people recommended this that I figured I may as well buy it.  Action scenes are solid but the story is crap.  Minor spoiler alert but you get this is the first five minutes.  World's greatest assassin is retired and the schmuck from GoT steals his car and kills his dog (he's had for one day) so he has to wipe out like 100 people.  Wish I had rented it or found a copy someone had thrown out their car window in disgust.  I know this will generate big paydays for him with future installments but the story-line is just weak.,1509926400,3,666,4.2047244094488185

6765336,1,B00OV3VGP0,WOW really a hitman retired living a life of peace and happiness with not a care in the world. Yes I know he is in morning for his wife who died after a long illness. Suddenly he has a run in with the Russian Mob and they manage to invade his house. What no security for the retired hitman. HMMM no worries and no one out there looking to exact revenge not even the relatives or business associates of the three people he killed with a pencil??? has anyone watched Casino. Then to add insult to injury he loads his new ready to go potty trained puppy into his rare and endangered mustang to go for a suicidal joy ride. RIGHT!!! like anyone would take that car out and do that to it. He could obviously afford a 2017 GT350SR. My wife also wants to know why the producers had to include the puppy in the joy ride. we could only stand 15 minutes or so of this trash. Did it  get better I doubt it. Archer rampaging while undergoing Chemotherapy was a kabillion times better. Plot line should have been- botched robbery leaves wife dead now that would work not his painful exercise in stupidity,1508112000,2,1090,4.29126213592233

6765342,4,B00OV3VGP0,"If you are looking for deep character development with a typical protagonist's arc, this is not the movie for you. If you like shoot-em-up action movies, though, this should be on your viewing list.

The action has a minimalist feel compared to most other similar films. The gunfights don't have a zillion bullets being fired - John Wick uses his guns with surgical precision. It's a nice change from the unrealistic gunfights with nothing but automatic fire and apparently unlimited ammo.

You won't find the plot to be anything highly original. The outcome is predictable. But it's well executed, and this role is a great fit for minimalist actor Keanu Reeves.",1508025600,,662,4.954954954954955

6765348,5,B00OV3VGP0,"This review is for the movie, not the picture quality. The PQ is definitely below what is experienced in Chapter 2 due to missing HDR. Once you see movies with and without HDR, the difference is jarring. John Wick needs a HDR release.

That said, the action is great. The acting is also great (Reek is just so easy to hate lol). The music complements the action perfectly and I think this is where Chapter 1 is much better than Chapter 2. Bring Chapter 3!",1507939200,,455,4.352941176470588

So in essence, the good guys are horrible at strategy and fighting and only win on a fluke at the end. Even Superman, Batman etc technically lose the fight but end up winning in the end. Not John Wick! I don't like violence and I usually cover my eyes during movies at the violent parts, but this move was SO satisfying and even though I cringed, I did not cover my eyes this time because the bad guy deserved every hit, shot, bruise, break and death! So take THAT bad guys. John Wick won't put up with your crap.

Keanu did an amazing job. Totally believable and I was really on the edge of my seat throughout the entire move. I had to remind myself to breathe.",1506124800,,838,4.017964071856287

And as John Wick, he answers the lifelong question: what would you do for love? For Wick, it's killing. Killing a LOT of people. And he doesn't do it in a sloppy, Rambo-esque way. This movie would be terrible if he did that. No. Wick does it with finesse, with dignity and respect (most of the time). And the movie runs almost as if it was just one, very well choreographed dance. A dance with lots and lots of guns. Willem Dafoe plays a rival assassin. Alfie Allen as the stupid punk that draws Wick's ire and the poppa patriarch and Wick's former employer played by Michael Nyqvist (rest his soul). This is a great movie.

6765557,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I'm not a big fan of over-the-top action movies.  I was a police officer for 7 years, and I've been in a lot of fights and dangerous situations.  Most of the movies I see are so fake, they're hard to watch.  When you watch John Wick, you'll see the main character wrestling with foes to get their guns away, running out of bullets mid-fight and having to reload, and most fights end up on the ground, just like they do in real life.  When he suffocates someone, it takes them a while to die, and the actors struggle for their lives in a believable way.  It's all-around good acting from the main cast and everyone that's just there to get the body count higher.  The stories in John Wick and John Wick 2 are great.  In the first, John Wick tries to retire from his assassin career after his wife dies of an illness.  She gives him a dog so he can love something when she's gone, and he finds a way to have hope through his relationship with the animal.  That is until someone breaks into his house to steal his car and kills the dog, causing him to get back into his old ways to get revenge.  It's a believable setup and the love and loss of his wife and then dog are heart-wrenching.  There is a main set-piece that deserves special mention as well: the Continental Hotel.  It's run by the shady element John Wick comes from, and is filled with people like him, but there's one special rule to the place, that no ""business"" can be conducted on the premises.  This makes the hotel a sort of sacred ground and gives it its own life, as it features prominently in both the first and second movie.  What also makes the world of the John Wick movies feel real are the use of gold token coins.  John has a lot of them, and they're accepted as currency in different places and by different people.  When he pays someone in a coin, it makes the world feel like it has existed long before we see it, that the ecosystem didn't just start when the viewer arrived to see it like some movies do.

The second movie's plot involves John Wick having to repay a debt he owes someone from when he first started his career.  This forces him out of retirement until his debt is paid.  The plot of the second movie isn't as motivating as the first, but the action is even better.  There are more fight scenes, and the quality and duration is higher.  The gunplay in both of these movies is outstanding.  John Wick has supernatural aim with weapons, and it's not like other action movies where the heroes spray bullets everywhere and no one can ever hit what they're aiming at.  Keanu moves like a police officer or a soldier, always aiming down sights and prepared for what is coming around the corner.  He shoots people in the foot or chest to cause them to drop their guards so he can finish them off with a headshot.  He's also not a ""good guy"", so he kills the people that are trying to kill him without a second thought.  I often watch movies where the hero lets the bad guy go and regrets it later.  This would never happen with John Wick, and I appreciate him more for that.

I rented the John Wick movies at Redbox, and after I had returned them I found myself thinking about the action sequences again and again.  I had to buy them to add them to my collection, and they were just as good during the second and third viewings.  They've topped my list of favorite action movies, and I recommend them to anyone who likes expert gun-fighting scenarios without being unrealistic or over-the-top with gore and explosions.  I recommend both movies.  You don't need to see the first to appreciate the second, but you really should see both as they're that good.  Eleven out of five stars if I could.",1502668800,12,3681,4.342606149341142

Unlike like Keanu Reeves' typically somnolent acting performances, he actually shows some passion in this one.

6765675,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Okay, I liked this movie MUCH more than I should have. It's a story of how you can never escape, which in itself is sort of depressing, and you almost feel sorry for the guy until you remember he is a ruthless, legendary killer. The action is non-stop, and there is no shortage of bullets. I am almost embarrassed to admit I have watched it three times already. My only complaint is about Blu Ray in general; I also have the DVD, and because the picture is more 'true' with Blu Ray, the picture is sometimes darker than the DVD, and at least for me, a little more difficult to see, but that may just be the way my TV is set up.",1501027200,,627,4.105691056910569

6765679,4,B00OV3VGP0,"A good bit of mindless action and violence. There really isn't much of a story here: John Wick is a retired hitman brought back into action and most everyone dies. The film editing is fast, there's plenty of style, and the film holds your interest start to finish. The biggest negative I found is that seeing Keanu Reeves in action makes me nostalgic for more Matrix-style kung fu incorporated into the action, but instead a majority of the action involves guns, with a limited amount of hand to hand. It is what it is, I suppose.",1500940800,,530,4.53125

I am not usually one for the whole revenge style action movies.  That whole concept tends to grate on my nerves, and I have a hard time feeling sympathy for the main character as he leaves a trail of carnage in his wake.  However, this is the exception...this is so much of an exception I cannot even put it into words.  This is such an incredible movie and Keanu Reeves is amazing in this role. Every bit of this movie is so well thought out from the backstories to the intricately and creatively choreographed action sequences that appear completely effortless to John Wick. I especially love the concept of the Continental Hotel and that entire underground society complete with its own currency.

Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast and is clearly giving it his all in this film. This franchise is worth every penny.

6765818,4,B00OV3VGP0,"It's uncanny as I have the exact opposite view of the Top Critical Reviewer. I thoroughly enjoyed the original movie, John Wick, but believe the sequel, John Wick 2, fell flat from start to finish. I was quite disappointed in John Wick 2 because it began with a lot of action and violence which seemed purposeless since I was unaware of the original episodes/scenes occurring in John Wick. The Top Critic may have points regarding Mr. Reeves lack of prowess in the martial arts and possibly being stiff during his one-liner deliveries but, after all, he is a hit-man, once retired then returned from retirement, and not a Shakespearean-role actor. Overall, John Wick is an action packed film that is entertaining and I believe will be enjoyed by its viewers. Keanu makes a good performance in his role overall.",1499040000,,810,4.83453237410072

6765823,4,B00OV3VGP0,"I hate it when people give away something about a movie before I see it, so I won't include any spoilers here.  From the description of the movie, you likely already know that John Wick is an ex-hit man that gets pulled back into the life after something happens.

There was only one scene that deeply disturbed me (some folks hate that scene, others don't really care), and it happens near the beginning.  I had foolishly thought the day that I got this that I could pop it in at night and watch the first ~20 minutes before shutting it off and going to bed.  That scene happens in the first 20 minutes, and after that, I had to watch the rest of it just to see John Wick unleash hell upon a certain group of people.

Oh, and he does.  In spectacular fashion.

If you enjoy watching bad guys get what's coming to them - you're going to love this movie.  (Granted, John Wick is/was arguably a bad guy, too...but not in this movie.)",1498953600,,931,4.28

6765894,5,B00OV3VGP0,I have e always been a Keanu Reeves fan. Even his flops have been somewhat pleasurable because of his performance as an actor. Despite what some people may think I think Keanu can actually act. But before seeing John Wick I have not seen Keanu Reeves in a movie for a while. Not knowing a whole lot of what John Wick was about and seeing the trailer once or twice I missed it's run in the theater. I think I red boxed it one night and was completely blown away. The movie was actually really good. I loved it. So when I got my Sony bravia 4k tv with hdr and my Sony 4k blu ray player with hdr the first 4k movie I bought was John Wick for 15 bucks at my local walmart. One of the best investments I have made in a movie considering that most 4k movies run from anywhere of 20 to 25 bucks maybe even more depending where you buy one. I won't give a synopsis of the movie or praise how good it was considering most people agree that it is great. I will simply say that the 4k transfer of John Wick is spectacular. The picture is perfect. It looks amazing and sounds even better with Dolby atmos. If you are so inclined to purchase a true 4k tv with hdr and a 4k blu ray player with hdr then I highly suggest getting John Wick and the sequel which I will also be reviewing.,1497398400,,1270,4.023715415019763
6765895,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I'm not a big Keanu fan but I really like this flick. And really like him in it. Suspend your disbelief and enjoy.

plot is a little thin, but it's delivered nicely,

R rating is likely for the constant F-bombs throughout the movie.
There are many intense scenes,

There are plenty of interesting characters,
but this isn't the movie if you're looking for deep character interactions.

6765948,3,B00OV3VGP0,"Another Keanu Reeves failed attempt to act in a movie. If there was a list of actors whose presence in a movie adds nothing then Keanu would be near the top. Hes so one dimensional pretty much everything Ive seen him is little more than dry, emotionless dialog with him doing his duh imitation to the camera. This movie had lots of action and included many different ways to kill someone to the point you actually cant keep up with the body count. Theres also nothing in this to make a viewer really care about why he went off the deep end but its pretty clear one reason was to make as many sequels as possible. Replacing him with someone like Jason Statham would have added some dimension and likely some dark humor to it. The action sequences were good, the supporting cast was well chosen but the star of the show did nothing and even no emotion shown regarding his wife or dog. There seems to be a trend on movies to develop a franchise on a film with little regard to plot and little to none on plausibility so why would I expect anything more than someone showing up for a movie and if it turns out to be good its pretty much a given that its because he has a following or it happens to be popular for whatever reason.",1496448000,2,1225,4.261802575107296

6766036,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I do believe Keanu Reeves probably had only 2 pages of dialogue to memorize for this movie, but he worked overtime with the choreography of the fight scenes and plot twists and an intensity of his character's persona.  Watched again to prepare for John Wick 2 which came out this spring in theaters so I would be ready to follow the series.  Loved it.  Please make more in this series.  The fact that innocent people are not involved per se and the rivalry of different underworld factions have some many rules/regulations and variety of players makes this pure fun and enjoyment.",1494374400,,580,4.712871287128713

6766042,5,B00OV3VGP0,"John Wick is so gorgeous to watch that one forgets that Keanu Reeves is a non-actor. It's not important, what is important is that we honor innovators. I don't watch a lot of movies like this, but as far as I know it's the first time I've ever seen Gun Fist Fighting. The majority of shooting in this movie seems to be from a distance of a foot or so and is done with some serious Twyla Tharp influences. It's an entirely new genre, and it is nothing short of sincerely gorgeous to watch. The rest of the movie is rot, including the misuse/marginalization of a real actor, Willem Dafoe, and some good music that is used wrong/too loud as though the producer paid a lot for it and was really intent on getting some bang for that buck. Anyway, innovation doesn't have to be perfect, it has to push something to the next level. I've seen this movie several times and will again, yes it's a dirty pleasure, but it's also innovation. It's the start of Gun Ballet.",1494115200,2,958,4.35754189944134

6766046,5,B00OV3VGP0,I liked how this Matrix reboot is more grounded in reality. I'm glad they brought back the original Neo. I'm sad that the dog died. I would rather they let the dog live and instead of a lot killing there was just a couple hours of Keanue Reeves being dreamy and playing with a dog. Maybe have more brunches in the next movie.,1494028800,,325,4.174603174603175

It is that entertaining and worth watching more than once.  And, of course, the puppy!!

6766395,3,B00OV3VGP0,"So let me get this straight. Neo finds a decent tailor, Seville Row maybe, and starts hanging out w/ Tom Brady's exe. She croaks in the first 3 minutes of the film, sort of like the NY J-E-T-S secondary in, well gosh, in any game after the preseason. Anyhow Neo's lost love (deceased wife/ girlfriend/ one-night stand) Erin Regan-Boyle gives him a yapping ankle bitter with whom Neo never really bonds and is unsure if he is in or out of the matrix. She coulda left him Magnum's Ferrari but no, a bleepin' dog. I digress.

Shortly thereafter said ankle biter is killed by Theon Greyjoy. Just. Well. Just because. I guess. We need to have a plot somewhere right? As if Theon didn't have enough dudes ticked as heck at him. He had to go and kill Neo's dog. So you know now with like 487 minutes left in the film Neo's gotta take some red pills, get mad as heck, and do some funky stuff on the computer while dodging hyper-quasi-realistic bullets or whatever to avenge this dang dog he never really liked in the first place. And that is just what he does. Bom bom bom.  Avenge the dog.

Oh and some weird Asian/American/Philippino version of Tybalt Capulet pops up for like 3.2 seconds for no real reason. Cameo maybe? Dude needed cash for fair Verona? Who knows. Not important. Flash forward.

Greyjoy of course enjoys the protection of Russia's most brilliant (read-- dumb as nails) body guards and assorted hitmen. All of which are under the direct control of Theon's ruthless father Russian mob boss and reluctant journalist Mikael Blomkvist. Don't mess with Russian-Swedes if you know what I mean. He'll slice a b*tch if you know what I mean. You've been warned. If you know what I mean.

Obviously Blomkvist can't stand for Neo seeking revenge on dull-witted Theon. So he calls up the Sons of Anarchy pre-season 6 to mount up and regulate. Wait no. Sorry. Mixing my metaphors. He calls up 12 random dudes who are more or less there just to die in order to shore up this week as poop plot. And they do. Pretty quickly. And rather undramatically. WIthout any real regard to the story line.

The whole time Agent Paul Smecker (AKA The Green Goblin) is chilling like a villain in the back forty waiting to make his entrance. Far as I can tell he is still waiting for his close-up. At some point Al Swearengen pops in for a sec to kill someone (Tyra Collette if you're curious. Meaning John Riggins is mad as heck, and pretty much leaving an opening for a sequel right here and now. Yah thats right you heard it here first). Pretty sure that was in the fine print of Swearengen's contract. He wouldn't make an appearance unless he gets to gun someone down. Preferably a lady. More preferably a cheap gun-slinging-whiskey-swilling-Texas-whore-lady. So yah he did. In a scene that doesn't really make much sense in a movie that well frankly doesn't really make much sense. But who cares cause thank you Jesus its almost concluded.

And then there is a car chase. We like car chases right bullet? Neo vs. Blomkvist. A car chase where a blacked out 300hp (at best) mid-level Dodge sedan pushes an even blacker 350hp Chevy SUV off a cliff. Even though the Chevy weighs easily 1500lbs more then the super hero Dodge. Thats the magic of the red pill Neo. This is how deep the rabbit hole goes. Stop questioning. This is your last chance. This is what happens when you let Mayehm drive Neo. Shoulda called All-State. And then the movie, finally for the love of god, ends. I'm not sure how. By then I wasn't really paying attention. I had a Tindr hookup or a root canal. Not sure which. Doesn't matter. Either would be better then spending another minute watching this train wreck of an action flick. Hey I took the blue pill. Don't fault me.",1490140800,,3731,4.543154761904762

6766434,5,B00OV3VGP0,"When this fantastic action movie (John Wick starring Keanu Reeves) first came out in 2014 I had no desire to see it; however, after I read an article in one of the many gun magazines I read, I just had to see this movie and purchased this DVD.  As a gun (and all kinds of other weapons) enthusiast I was very impressed with how Keanu Reeves was trained in combat firearms and self-defense for his role in the first John Wick movie.

I have not seen his recent movie yet,  (John Wick Chapter two) but if it is anything like his first one, (shooting 76 people thugs) I know I will love it.
Keanu Reeves is an ex-assassin and some vicious young and stupid thugs steal his car and kill his dog.  Needless to say, this unleashes the hell of John Wick, who is known as the assassin of assassins.  If you are into action movies this is A MUST SEE DVD.

If you like authentic gun battles and fights in an action movie, this is a must own DVD.  I cant wait to see the newest chapter in what I hope will be a long running action movie series.  I also heard they were thinking of making a comic book series with the John Wick character? In any case, this is a fantastic move.

6766498,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I wanted this to by my first 4K movie, and it certainly doesn't disappoint.
I've seen this movie 3 times before and watching it in all its' pixel fidelity, being 4 times the amount of detail, really pleased my eyes. There is a noticable amount of detail from the standard John Wick Bluray that I tested by switching inputs from my regular bluray player to my UHD bluray player.
Some scenes are just a little better while others are a LOT better with the extra information. In my experience, I'd say the 4K in this film shines when characters are just far enough away from the camera to pick up more detail. Close-ups of things like John Wick's hands or coffee-mugs don't seem all that much better because they're already pretty defined up close... But at a moderate distance, this extra resolution picks up a bit more detail on faces than the standard bluray of John Wick. Of course, the whole film seems to have the added fidelity that comes with 4K, but some scenes benefit from it more than others.

Bottom line, you need this movie in your collection. If you have the hardware to play UDH Blurays, this would be a fine edition to your collection.",1489104000,,1150,4.528846153846154

6766528,4,B00OV3VGP0,"I'm not a super pro-gun type person, but the violence and killing in this film is just so creative, well staged, and interesting to watch.  It certainly doesn't hurt that the tone expertly straddles the line between po-faced and tongue-in-cheek.  It is at times funny and at others, borderline comical.  After all, John Wick gets shot, hit by cars, and dropped off ledges throughout and always walks away intact.  He also kills probably 100+ guys through the course of the film.  So, obviously it's too ludicrous to be taken too seriously.  As for action chops, Keanu has still got it, and as for acting chops...it's Keanu Reeves.  You either love every word and expression the man produces, or you don't.  You know exactly what you are getting here, and sometimes there is nothing more satisfying than watching a film that gives you precisely what you thought it would.",1488931200,4,870,4.831081081081081

With well-choreographed action scenes and accurate depictions of firearms handling and capabilities, _John_Wick_ breaks from the Hollywood tradition of infinite ammunition, zero reloads, and perfect accuracy. Reeves's Wick speaks little yet conveys a broad emotional spectrum in facial expression and gesture. Color palettes reflect his character's journey and the excellent sets and framing allow for complete immersion. The brutal set-up allows the audience to continually cheer for Wick even though he is ultimately a bad guy among worse in standard social roles.

For some strange reason, which I have yet to figure out, this film gets five stars. In my opinion, it is just an excuse (and a poor one) for gratuitous violence and a record number of exploding heads. The film has a minimal plot, not much of a script, and I would venture to say that Keano has no more than fifty lines in the entire movie. Frankly I only watched the tiny portions that had a bit of dialogue because the rest was so nauseating.

Thatnobody is John WickThey call him [The Boogeyman]John wasn't exactly the boogeyman.  He was the one you sent to kill theboogeyman.

John is a man of focus, commitment, sheer willI once saw him kill three men in a bar with a pencil.

The above comes from this neo noir (new black) action thriller film with Keanu Reeves as John Wick.  It was co-produced by Eva Longoria (probably best known for her role in Desperate Housewives).

Yes, this is a revenge film where an underworld legend (Reeves) comes out of retirement.  However, its definitely not your standard revenge thriller since it boasts good performances as well as terrific visual and action sequences.  The musical background score is also good.

All the cast give good performances but I have to give special kudos to Reeves, Adrianne Palicki (as Ms. Perkins), Michael Nyqvist (as Viggo Tarasov), Willem Dafoe (as Markus), and John Leguizamo (as Aurelio).

This movie is a slick, stylish, and satisfying revenge thriller with wit.  You can think of it as an underworld fantasy, a ferocious B-movie funfest.

Dont kid yourself.  This movie is violent.  As a result the body count is high.  (I actually lost count.)  This is understandable when you consider the Wicks motto (which he has tattooed across his back from shoulder to shoulder) is the Latin proverb Fortis Fortuna Adiuvat (meaning Fortune Favours the Strong).

The DVD itself (the one released in 2015) has no extras.  (This is keeping in line with the movies no-nonsense style.)

Finally, this movie has grossed, so far, over four times its operating budget.  A sequel was released in Feb 2017.  I, for one, cant wait to see it.

In conclusion, this movie shows that Keanu Reeves as John Wick is back with a vengeance!!

6766619,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I ordered this disc mainly out of curiosity. I wanted to see if my Blu-Ray player ( an OPPO 103 'firm-ware' improved to handle 4K discs) would play the 4K and feed it to my 1080p Panasonic plasma. It wouldn't. I don't know exactly why but I'm researching it ( is my Yamaha A/V receiver blocking it I don't know). Anyway, I decided to put the humdrum BluRay disc in and watch the movie. Right from the get-go I knew something good was happening. The DOLBY-'ATMOS' logo came on and sound effects started dancing around the room (the Yamaha is a 7.1 player ). Gee, I thought I might not get 4K but at least I have the sound of a 4K movie (hopefully). Then the movie started and my thoughts were 'what the he..' : The image was not only good, it was 'Ultra' good. It was like BluRay on steroids. There was color, contrast and sharpness (not to mention sound) that I had never seen on a BluRay disc before and I have some good discs to compare it to (Ben Hur, Fifth Element).

I'm sure some find the movie itself over-the-top when it comes to violence and the capacity of Keanu Reeves to withstand pain when he dispatches bad guys ( who needs Superman when we have John Wick? ). But if you've seen the movie and like it and are considering buying the BluRay you might want to go the 4K route right now for future reference. If the 4K disc is anywhere near the viewing quality of the BluRay you will be very pleased with your decision ( anybody know what the expectant life of a Panasonic 1080p plasma TV is?)

After seeing this disc I also purchased the movie 'Sicario' in 4K to see how it shaped up image-wise. Right off the bat that beautiful DOLBY-'ATMOS' logo came on and the sound was dancing around the room. Again the movie started and visually it was stunning. I can't figure out how this is happening. A disc is made in the 4K format and they make a BluRay from the master that ends-up upgraded as well? Is the BluRay disc which comes with these 4K discs made from the 4K master? That's the question. How else could they incorporate the DOLBY-'ATMOS' sound in the BluRay movie. It's a quandary. I'm hoping somebody out there will beat me over the head with technical sagacity and explain all this.
Please be gentle.

Back in the day of vinyl records every audiophile had what he called a 'reference' album or two that brought out the best sound from his audio system. This 'John Wick' 4K/BluRay disc is now my reference BluRay. The sound and visual presentation are both very good. No, let me fix that- they are extremely good.

If your system is up to the task and you like technical improvements that enhance your movie viewing experience  you will be very pleased with this purchase. Highly recommended.",1488067200,,2710,4.412

Even though this film recycles well-trodden action movie clichs and tropes, unapologetically, it still manages to deliver an enjoyable experience.

For those looking for an intricate plot, character development or even a slight nod towards realism... this is not the movie you're looking for. No, this film takes place in that alternate universe where punches, kicks and stab wounds do little to diminish combat effectiveness. The same world where low-level henchmen wear tailored Armani suits, and where the bad guys love to party in the trendiest underground clubs.

If the producer's goal was to market a movie to teenage males, I'm sure he accomplished his goal of making money. If the director wanted to make a movie with some substance, the script didn't give him much to work with. What little plot  exists you can see coming down 5th Avenue. Speaking of 5th Ave., at least the movie is set in NYC so there are some decent background shots.
I have nothing against action movies and I understand they aren't supposed to be very deep. However, John Wick is little more than a series of action scenes strung together with a thin, foreseeable plot. What little dialogue is present is almost entirely overwhelmed by the rest of the soundtrack. Even with some real talent such as Willem Dafoe, the movie struggles to be mature.
Once again a good potential movie is dumbed down for an immature audience and a fast buck at the box office.",1487980800,,936,4.4678362573099415

6766645,5,B00OV3VGP0,"If you like movie like The Expendables or The Matrix series then you'll  LOVE  this movie!  Reeves plays John Wick a retired hit man who is grieving the death of his wife when he has a break in by the local Russian mob bosses kid who steals his beloved 69 Mustang Mach 1 and does a bad thing to the last gift from his deceased wife.  Wick learns that it was the son of his former employer that stole his car and re-enters the seedy underworld he left to deliver some payback to the kid.  Michael Nyqvist plays Viggo Tarasov Wick's former employer, Russian mob boss and father of Losef Tarasov the kid who stole the car.  Losef is played by Alfie Allen who turns in an excellent portrayal as the spoiled punk mobster in training who learns why you don't steal the favorite possession in the world of his dad's former top assassin.  Adrienne Palicki plays Ms. Perkins a female assassin and one of Wicks acquaintances from his old hit man days.  There's an interesting scene where her and Wick mix it up.  Another excellent scene is in the Red Circle Club where Viggo has planted Losef as bait to draw Wick in for the kill, there's some VERY NICE scenery in the bathhouse of the club...  Willem Dafoe puts in a good performance as Marcus, an old friend of Wick's from back in the day who winds up saving his ass a couple of times, a friend in need is a friend indeed!  Dean Winters appears as Viggo's personal assistant, you know him from those annoying Allstate mayhem commercials he used to do.  Bridget Regan plays Addy a bartender at the members only assassin's club bar of the Continental Hotel where all the assassin's cool their heels and let their hair down on neutral ground where no ""business"" is allowed to be conducted.  Kevin Nash you may know from his WWE wrestling plays a doorman at the Red Circle Club whom Wick has a little catch up chat with before he infiltrates the club in search of Losef.

The scene with the puppy's demise could have been omitted, and just have been heard and not seen.  But I understand it was done to amp up the revenge motive.  The pictures of the wife or girlfriend are probably  in my view just filler.  I doubt that John Wick would telegraph his intentions to his former mob boss.  The Boss would get the picture fast enough after his men started dropping.  The violence quotient is high, but then I suppose it would be, when the main character is running on emotions.  The Bosses son doomed himself, then in his arrogance thought he could fix the problem.  I liked it, because it was interesting to follow a character who had nothing left to care about.

I actually looked it up once I saw how well reviewed the sequel is because I want to see that while it's in the theater.

Allow me to stress to best part of this movie: it is CRAZY VIOLENT! Once the shooting started I thought ""okay this is pretty gruesome."" Little did I know it was just getting started. The makeup/special effects departments should win an Academy award for some of these bullet wounds. At one point John Wick puts his gun to a guy's head and point-blank pulls the trigger and you can see a piece of his head fly off!! That was the high point for me. I like how the movie pushes the boundaries of what we find acceptable violence-wise, and I think it helps that the violence is enclosed in a pretty decent emotional story about John and his wife.

I've always enjoyed Kenau movies but this one will go down in the history books for me, and I will never be able to watch his acting again and think that he accepted a part in a morbid movie that killed a dog to get ratings.  The plot and story line was all too predictable anyway.",1487548800,2,579,4.293577981651376
6766678,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Keanu Reeves at his shoot-'em-up, smack-down, fast driving best! Amazing that the whole storyline started because of a stolen car and murdered dog. Just don't mess with this guy. Awesome movie, interesting characters. Very rarely does one root for bad guy. That is what Keanu brings to John Wick. A broken heart, more grief and loss, and using it to settle the score. As the viewers, we understand his reasoning, and we don't forget it, even during the most violent scenes. The bonus feature is definitely a bonus. Interviews with the cast, as well as the director, who happens to be Keanu's long time stunt double. It makes sense that someone who has been working with Keanu for all these years, would easily be able to direct him in a movie. I highly recommend this movie.",1487548800,3,774,4.698529411764706
6766679,5,B00OV3VGP0,"A lot of action. Although typical man-movie, I loved it and by the end of the movie, I was hoping for a sequel. Love me some Keanu.",1487548800,,131,3.888888888888889
6766680,4,B00OV3VGP0,always a good movie,1487548800,,19,4.0
6766681,2,B00OV3VGP0,"As much as ""John Wick""  is pure fantasy, several pivotal aspects are completely unfathomable:

Considering Wick's previous ""job"", the idea that he would allow himself to be waylaid so easily in such a ""soft"" house is ridiculous.

Wick had the opportunity to whack the deviant who killed his dog; yet hesitated until he could get closer to ""make it more personal"".

At the end, Wick needed to put the old Russian down like a rabid dog.  Rather than shooting him immediately, Wick engaged him in an ""honorable"" fist fight that turned into a knife fight instead...

This movie is a bit like the ""The Pink Panther"" with a mean streak, except that ""Inspector Clouseau"" and Cato were  actually funny.  It is not nearly as smoothly choreographed as any of the ""The Transporter"" films; nor is Reeves as funny or relateable as Statham, or Sellers for that matter.

My advice: avoid ""John Wick"", unless you are into non-stop ""Kill Bill""-style gratuitous violence.

Now, this DVD is going where it belongs:  Into the trash.",1487462400,,1012,4.825581395348837

Lots of blood and quite a body count.  For the genre, it has story with a good plot line, and well formed characters.  Very few eye-rolling elements and no ridiculous, convoluted, cheap plot twists.  Pacing is fast, but engaging.  Soundtrack is dark, driving and intense.

The 4k hdr is breathtaking with incredible detail in what are often very dark environments.  The rich colors (often driven by lighting) pop without making the movie look ripped from a comic book.

6766706,5,B00OV3VGP0,"If ever an action movie was underrated and overlooked, it has to be ""John Wick"" (or as it's now becoming known, ""John Wick: Chapter One."" The plot is as old as the hills: top hit man retires to start a new life, tragedy strikes, and said hit man returns with a vengeance to kill anyone and anything that gets in his way.

What really distinguishes ""John Wick"" from the rest of the pack is the execution (no pun intended). Keanu Reeves plays the role well, maintaining a stoic demeanor through much of the film. He portrays a convincing human killing machine, with an extremely dry sense of humor on the very few occasions where there are laughs to be had. For the most, however, this is a grim and dark film, with a massive bodycount and terrific action sequences in which scores of bad guys and gals are dispatched with bullets, blades, and vehicles. We've seen it all before, but rarely has it been done so well, and ""John Wick"" makes for a great action thriller that only improves with multiple viewings.

In 4K Ultra, the movie looks beautiful. The blacks which dominate the cinematography are sharp and crisp, the colors are vibrant, and the level of detail is superb. So far as extras go, you get a number of behind the scenes featurettes which focus on various aspects of the production. It is particularly impressive to see the amount of work that Keanu Reeves put into the role before a single frame was shot. All in all, the asking price (current about $15) for a 4K Ultra disk is unbeatable, and you'd be well advised to pick this one up before heading to the movie theater to catch ""John Wick: Chapter 2"".",1487376000,3,1617,4.515358361774744

6766712,3,B00OV3VGP0,"First off I didn't hate this movie. It's an action movie starring Keanu Reeves so I pretty much knew what I was getting into with this flick. The action scenes were well filmed and choreographed, and like in ""Taken"" where I wanted Bryan Mills, Liam Neeson's character, to save his daughter, I wanted Wick to win. The climatic scene in ""Taken"" when Mills walks in on the yacht to find the sultan guy holding his daughter, there was no hesitation, Mills shot.

What are the chances that the guy you beat up, kill his dog, and steal his car will be a retired mafia hit man? Not just any hit man, but the king of all hit men. In ""John Wick,"" that's the major story plot. Similar to ""Taken"" where the girl you kidnap to sell into slavery turns out to be the daughter of an elite CIA agent. This alone is so overdone it's more of a joke than a viable story line. Then we get a hotel where everybody pays in gold coins and contract hits are off limits. Right, like hired killers have ethical standards. There were so many things in this movie that made me laugh, even though I imagine they were meant as deep. Wick's dog was a gift from his wife before she died. The bad guys kill his dog. The hotel, I laughed out loud at that story fiasco. When they capture Wick, rather than simply killing him right there, they tie him up and go on a speech, giving Wick time to be saved and escape.

This is a revenge movie, pure and simple, and I understand that, however I think this movie would have moved much more quickly and had far more action if the hotel were removed completely. Instead of having a location where all the ""elite"" contract killers meet, discuss their craft, and commune in complete safety, why not simply have the Russian boss, the father of Wick's target, have everybody in his organization gunning for Wick? From what I've read about crime organizations they don't hire so called free lance killers, they have their own, loyal, in house killers.

John Wick, a man with nothing left to lose and the single minded purpose of killing the three men faces off against the Russian mob.",1487289600,,2088,4.404145077720207

6766723,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I watched this movie on a flight, without hearing anything about it.  I like action films, but have strong feelings on violence in film.  Is it exploitative?  Is it misogynist?  Is it justified within the world of a particular film?  I've read a lot on this topic and therefore can't watch a film without considering how violence is used and portrayed.  With that premise, I loved John Wick.  It's a classy action film with a serious nod to Asian martial arts cinema.  The action choreography is downright poetic, and very unique for Hollywood.  This is a gamechanger in the genre.  Now I've just come back from seeing the sequel, but I won't review that here.  Except I will say that the clear vision of John Wick continues to Chapter 2.  It needs to be a franchise in a way that most movies DON'T need to be (if you know what I mean).  Excellent film to be stored in the annals of film history.",1487030400,,896,4.423312883435583

6766787,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I really liked this movie, although I feel guilty for saying so. On the other hand...they killed his dog! What I really want to comment on, though, is the high visibility the film gives to the use of gold coins by Wick and Vigo. This is not accidental or a random plot device. There's a war on cash going on in the real world, with governments everywhere working towards making all money digital. The alleged reasons are to diminish tax evasion and criminal activities. The real reason is to gain knowledge of and control over all transactions. If you don't believe this, search on ""war on cash"" and find out for yourself. Hollywood's culture warriors never met a globalist policy they didn't like. Watch the movie again, and note how they hit you in the face with the stacks of gold coins in Wick's and Vigo's safes.

Of course, the other side of this is that they're noting the historical role gold has played as money. In fact, as Alan Greenspan has noted (post-Fed), gold is the only real money. So perhaps there will be an unintended consequence here, as Wickians buy their own gold coins as a store of value. And really -- a one ounce gold coin as a cover charge?

The basic plot is a variation on one we have seen over and over, but well done. Especially for a bunch of directors in charge of a film for the first time. The John Wick character is a great choice for Keanu. The bad guy who reformed for a woman, then lost her. The spoiled brat delinquent who thinks he can humiliate others with impunity. The silent pain and the deadly focus John carries into his revenge plan... it just fits. They picked the wrong guy at the wrong time to mess with. It goes from there. The bonus features were even interesting to watch as they described who was involved and how they created the effects of the film. Often, the movie trailer is the best part of the bonus features, but not so in this case. Keanu has another winning series of movies, I think. I look forward to Chapter 2.

(SPOILER ALERT) I tried to have my girlfriend watch this with me, but she intentionally locked herself in the bathroom when they killed the puppy (she really likes beagles). She also did not appreciate my description of John coming to staring at the poor puppy's bloody corpse, but how else would she have really understood John's insatiable bloodlust for the remainder of the film? Dexter would have a field day with the amount of head shots and gratuitous blood spurting that happens in this film. Theon also reprises his role as being a spoiled little brat rich kid who ends up getting his comeuppance, really hope Alfie doesn't get typecast but his face is v puncheable.

6766910,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Although this film is in the writer's own words a ""simple revenge story"", it is brilliantly written, acted, and shot. (BTW do you need another reason to watch when the supporting cast includes John Leguizamo, Willem Dafoe, Lance Reddick, and Ian McShane?!). The fight sequences are second to none, and excepting the bad-guy thugs (who are necessary for the high body counts), all the significant characters are three-dimensional and have histories with each other. They speak in a shared code that lends believability and ethics (or should I say humanity) to an otherwise nihilistic and horrific underworld.

John Wick is reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's protagonist in ""Unforgiven"" (1992) and other remarkable anti-heroes who, although they can never truly escape their past deeds, their painful and honest struggle to extract themselves (usually with help of a loved one), and their willingness to fight the evil of their former world provides the possibility of moral redemption. Needless to say, such richness raises these films to something far superior to mere revenge stories.

I cannot imagine that the coming John Wick sequel will be able to match the original's brilliance, but time will tell...",1486339200,6,1204,5.298429319371728

Little details like gold coins and hidden bars make the story a bit more interesting than it has a right to be. For an action movie about an angry anti-hero, the writing is good.

6766928,5,B00OV3VGP0,"This is a high production value, rapid paced, action & violence oriented, revenge flick. I think it pulls off what it was trying to achieve. The film creates a semi-fantastical, under belly world of assassins, kingpins and criminals with their own set of rules & culture, yet this is done without the graphic camp look of a Sin City type movie. Keanu Reeves performs well as a grief stricken former assassin abruptly dragged back into his old life. There are no big dramatic scenes, just plenty of action scenes with a simple story line. I would say that it is a classic ""B"" movie in all things that make such a movie excellent and fun, and not meaning low budget or less than in any way. The cast is thoroughly enjoyable with many familiar faces in small but key roles. Reeves is methodical as the steadfast anti-hero defying all odds in seeking justice for an obvious wrong which serves to vent his overwhelming grief experience which pre dated the action.",1486339200,,958,4.641176470588236

The bodies pile up like a stack of firewood.  I'm guessing at least 75 to 100 individuals are killed by John Wick, who, according to the plot, was the most effective hit-man the Russian mob had ever employed before he retired. Now he is back, and going after the same people he use to do contracts for. We are suppose to root for John Wick, vicious killer, as opposed to the head of the mob, vicious killer, because the mob beat him up and killed his dog.

Sure this is like other movies...  I think of taken... but, it is still a different movie.  This film noir at its best.

Picture a man hell bent on revenge with every resource and an infinite timeline at his disposal. Then picture that man as the immortal reincarnation of Rasputin. This is the story of Keanu Reeves as John Wick, the Dispatcher of Head Shots and Curator of Cute Puppies. Beyond the reach of mortal man, John Wick lives on the outskirts of society desperate for a life of solitude he will never know. Penance is a word that Mr. Wick must know well, for his previous life has doomed him to a life of strained retribution. Like Sisyphus, he must wade back into the waters of persistent current and fight against the pull of his fate. The grasp of the Moirai take hold and Wick never sees the light of day again, much to the delight of the viewer. This chapter will forever be noted as one of The Trials of John Wick, and this is just the beginning.",1485388800,,929,4.375722543352601

I was looking for a good time, and am amenable to nonsense.  But this was not a good movie.  The most effective portions were before the action kicked off (sad Keanu, dead wife, dead puppy).  After that, the action sequences were pretty trite (no really inventive choreography), and there was no feeling for me of ""Yeah, take that, bad guys!""  Honestly, the ""big bad"" is probably the most sympathetic character in the movie.  Anyway, not for me.  Glad others enjoy it, though.",1484784000,,611,4.7075471698113205

Everyone else was just really shallow.  Reeves is just too dark or cold to sell the ""I'm a grieving widower"" bit which is the impetus for the action.  The ""chase"" scenes are done with a non-typical style of using the car in...Car-fu (?), as opposed to just a standard chase.  The action was all good, but by the end of the movie, I really didn't care how it ended or what happened to who and was just a bit bored of the whole thing.",1484784000,,597,4.238938053097345

Reeves stars as John Wick, a retired hitman seeking vengeance for the theft of his vintage car and the killing of his puppy, which was a gift from his recently deceased wife.  The film is interesting as Wick / Reeves uses
a series of 9mm handguns along with martial arts. His guns are almost like the swords in martial arts movies.  Fights scenes are choreographed down to the last detail. The performances, visuals, and action sequences are gripping. And there is some dry humor as well amongst all the wonderfully gratuitous violence.

The fight scenes had me yelling at the movie theater and I found myself doing the same as I watched the video. It amazes me how well-directed the fight scenes were as well. The angle that you watched the battle from as the viewer was perfect - you could almost FEEL the blows as the camera kept pace with Reeves. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! I won't give anything away since I always hate it when other reviewers do that. I'll comment on what I just wish more Amazon Video purchasable content would include: behind the scenes bonus material. Whenever I buy instant video, I am always hesitant to purchase it or feel that I am missing something by not buying the Blu-Ray edition because the instant video doesn't include the extras. Not with this one! There is around and hour of extras at the end of this movie! PLEASE continue to include extras in instant videos! If you did this you'd have a buyer for life!!!

For me, it's nice to see Nyqvist again after having seen him in 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'. I strongly recommend not letting youngsters see 'John Wick' without parental guidance (if you let your kids see it at all) because of violence and because of the mature content/plot/premise. The story is really appropriate only for adults. I rented this on Amazon because I missed it in the theaters when it first came out and now the sequel, which I'd like to see, is about to be released.",1483833600,,584,4.518867924528302

6767522,4,B00OV3VGP0,Nice quality picture. I personally thought movie was stupid but my husband and adult son think it's amazing. Keanu Reeves has barely any lines. Just runs around killing and fighting while pouting. Which is why men appear to love it. Of course nobody has ever said they wish Keanu had more lines lol. I rate it 4 based on the opinions of the men in my family. I took away a star for those of us women who enjoy an actual storyline and a little dialogue!,1483488000,,452,4.267441860465116

Bullets fly,  all the bad guys die. Theres a fancy hotel for assassins and other people of dubious character.  The whole thing felt like watching Bruce Wayne going bad. And the urban landscape is as dark as Gotham.

6767571,4,B00OV3VGP0,"This is a violent killing-spree movie, NYC.  Helen was very sick and she knew that her days were numbered.  John Wick, a retired assassin, was her beloved husband.  In the opening, John was holding his wife's funeral service.  Next day at home, he got a delivery from his deceased wife.  She has bought him a pet dog as a companion.  Quite romantic in a way.
One day, John was driving his mustang with his pet dog as passenger.  At a gas station, a youth gang playfully tried to buy his mustang and the dog.  No business deal.  That night, John was beaten inside his house; his dog, killed and his mustang, stolen.  He decided to hunt down those burglars.  His connection led him to Losef, son of his former gangster boss Viggo.  From here, a violent revenge took over.
John asked Viggo to give up Losef.  No way.  Instead, Viggo upgraded his security circle by ways of adding more body guards; financing John's ex-honey assassin Ms. Perkins; hiring another assassin Marcus; and delivering a 2 million contract for John's head.  As expected, John directly searched for Losef in Johnathan's strip club.  Violent gun fighting scene.  Many died.  Losef ran out and sped off the bloody scene.  No pause. Ms. Perkin slipped into John's bedroom.  Her intent to kill failed because Marcus was shooting from a roof alerting John.  She got tied up but later escaped.  Where was Losef?  He was hiding with bodyguards in a Brooklyn warehouse.  This time, John found the place and killed everyone
there including Losef.  Quite a relief.  John thanked Marcus in person at a dark waterfront.  Alas, their secret meeting was accidentally caught by Ms. Perkins.  Her report to Viggo caused Marcus' life.
Johnathan the strip club owner has a house rule: Stay away from Viggo's game.  Ms. Perkins broke this rule and was killed.  Upon learning Marcus' death, John returned in a rainy night for Viggo.  Car chasing and gun shooting.  In a final violence, both John and Viggo were heavily injured by a long knife.  Viggo stayed dying on the fighting ground.  John was able to leave.  Inside a pet dog store, there was temporary medicine for him.  Ah, he led away a dog with him.",1483056000,,2158,4.6916890080428955

First time in ages that I've actually felt embarrassment for the cast and crew of a movie. Inane, vapid, and two-dimensional I could maybe forgive, but predictable - even boring - with a liberal dash of misogyny, a sprinkling of xenophobia, and just a twist of animal abuse is honestly too much.

6767591,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Seems to me this one got five stars when I looked at it. Someone liked it better than I did then. I gave it four because Keanu Reeves did a pretty good job in this one. He's a bit too underspoken for me, I like soft spoken gents like he portrayed here, but i like them a bit more chatty to the bad guys shades of Clint Eastwood.
  This story is following a much used recipe for bad guys we like. A retired hit man thrust back into the limelight by baddies doing wrong to his family. This one involves some wrong doing to John's pet left to him by his wife. While I could get revved up enough to do some damage to someone for hurting my Dog, some people nowadays wouldn't . I leave that part up to you to decide. I found a lot of what I would call ""Gun Kata"" Ju Jitsu with guns thrown in used. It's a tribute to Mr. Reeves to have pulled it off so well and making us believe he really did know how to do all of the fancy martial arts stuff and melding them seamlessly with the use of firearms.
  I found this movie entertaining enough, but was a little disappointed at how easily we found the bad guys in it. Then the rest of it was just timing, waiting to see the next battle.
  Would I recommend this movie? Sure I would. It won't win any Oscars but it's an entertaining show for an evening.  It's not something I buy to put into my video library as I can't see myself wanting to watch it over and over again like American Graffiti.",1482796800,,1433,4.024647887323944

6767775,5,B00OV3VGP0,"A classically designed action movie that has heart and centers around a man's search for justice in the cruel, dangerous underbelly of the world of contract assassins.  The story follows John Wick, a legendary but retired contract killer whos in pain.  We join the story's titular character as he newly grieves the loss of his wife, when russian thugs invade his home, kill his dog, which was a parting gift from his wife, make off with his 1969 Mach 1 Mustang, and proceed to spend 1hr and 41mins belittling the significance of those precious possessions.  It's up to John Wick to get the only justice known to contract assassins: Vengeance.  Willem Dafoe and Keanu Reeves give masterful, even artful performances.  John Leguizamo also delivers a solid and powerful performance.  Directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch create a beautiful and atmospheric world in their narrative stylings thats full of attitude and grit, but will seem one-dimensional to more sophisticated viewers.  The pacing structure persented is enjoyable because it keeps the energy high, the pace quick, with all the fun and intriguing dialogue of any James Bond film or even more modern examples like Kingman: The Secret Service.  The only criticism is that the plot is simple, in that once you know the set-up of the story, no new details are added to further complicate the plot progression.  This movie is more about getting an introspective experience in a world of mystery and intrigue thats dark and dangerous but enjoyable.  The only tangle after the film is being excited for the next iteration with very little else like it.  Overall: Simple good action entertainment.  Bravo.  #johnwick2confirmed.",1480636800,,1685,5.105839416058394

6767827,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Electrifying! Dynamic! And utterly..., mesmerizing! Talk about an awesome, fast-paced, action and adventure, drama! Without a doubt, this film about righteous indignation and justifiable revenge is nothing short of superb! It's a modern day combination of: 'The Count of Monte Cristo' and 'The Equalizer', as regarding - payback's, retaliation and warranted revenge is concerned. Written by: Derek Kolstad and Directed by: Chad Stahelski, this 2014, color, single-disc, DVD in 16 X 9 widescreen format which is approximately 101-minutes long, comes to it's audience in spoken English and Spanish in 5.1 Dolby Digital Audio, complete with English and Spanish subtitles. Ruthless and unrelenting, cut throat, former assassin: JOHN WICK, also referred too, in Russian, as the: ""Baba Yaga"" (The Boogeyman). By the Russian Mobster - Viggo, who used to employ him. JOHN WICK - the assassin of assassin's, the virtual school master in the art of execution and then some, the killer that will not be denied, JOHN WICK, is indeed: The ""Baba Yaga!"" With the fearful respect of everyone in the criminal underworld, JOHN WICK out maneuvered, out fought and out killed, all those that his former Russian Mobster Boss - Viggo, sent him to execute. But then..., the unimaginable happened. JOHN WICK - the supreme assassin extraordinaire, was struck by Cupid's Arrow and fell deeply in love with a beautiful woman, named: Helen. So much so, that he wanted out of the 'killing business.' Why? So that, he could get married and settle down. After a few short years in a blissfully happy, married state, JOHN's beloved wife, dies. JOHN is beside himself with grief. And, to add insult to injury, Viggo's' young son - Isoef, not realizing who he was dealing with together with his croonies, steals JOHN's car and mercilessly kills his adorable puppy which his late wife, gave to him. With his understandable fury aroused to a fever pitch, this former assassin who was tamed and halted by true love, arose from the ash heap and once again, stepped into the warranted shoes of retaliation by way of vengeful execution. Viggo - incensed at his son, not for what he did but more so..., for who he did it too, knew that JOHN WICK - The Executioner, will soon come after his son, to kill him. So, the shrewd, manipulative, Russian Mobster - Viggo the Father, reluctantly sends out a hit squad to silence an accomplished and lethal killer, like JOHN WICK. From there, ""it was on!"" Checking into the exclusive underworld hotel ""The Continental"", where doing ""business"" (killing) on the premises is against the ""Code"", is... after a long hiatus, welcomed by staff and management. But, is stalked by a surprise assassin. Only after, Viggo doubles the initial $2 million dollar contractual 'hit', that he had put out on JOHN. Especially since, the hit squad that Viggo sent to kill JOHN initially, shall we say... failed miserably, for the last time. But, as expected, the ""Baba Yaga"" the relentless ""Boogeyman"", pulls out all of the stop's and sets out on a murderous rampage. With superb Actor: Keanu Reeves starring in the title role, he is joined by an equally distinguished cast, namely: Ian McShane; Michael Nyqvist; Adrianne Palicki; Dean Winters; Willem Dafoe; Alfie Allen; John Leguizamo and Briget Moynaham. And, although this film is appropriately rated 'R' for brutal violence and graphic human carnage as relating to the story theme and contents, you can't help but cheer for JOHN, as he justifiably sets out to eliminate his enemies. And, although I don't condone violence for the sole sake of violence (like Viggo's son - Isoef did), the choreography in the combined forms of: Physical blocking for the fight and cloak and dagger scenes and the brilliant special effects are both, riveting and pristine in presentation. So much so, that it conceivably could have been nominated for an Oscar, in the cinematography category. For without a doubt, this adrenaline-rushing, edge-of-your-seat, enthralling, action and adventure drama is nothing short of superb. And dynamic JOHN WICK, is an executioner that you can't help but cheer, for! How can I possibly say that? Watch the film and you will see what I mean. A 'must see' and 'have' motion picture. For this film is truly: Absolutely Electrifying! Nina Kish",1479340800,,4290,5.043661971830986

in a more ambitious movie. As cartoons go this one was made well, thus three stars.

Revenge is a dish best served cold.  Unless you are a former assassin that is.  John Wick may have lost a step after retirement, but he is still the best there is at what he does.  And what he does is neither pretty or nice.

This is my favorite type of movie.  You find a man who has lost his will to live, you give him something that rekindles that spark and then you have someone take that spark away.

This isn't an overly gory film, most of the kills are done with precision.  The body count is extreme which is why I say it isn't for kids.",1477785600,,647,3.9921875

6768025,2,B00OV3VGP0,"The movie would have been a lot more fun if it took itself less seriously and were more self-aware. It's basically a stylishly shot run-of-the-mill shoot-em-up, complete with everything that bores me about that kind of movie: does the hero never miss until it's narratively convenient? Check. Is the bad guy from a foreign country? Check. Does the movie milk the moment the hero is gravely injured to try to add a modicum of emotion, only to have him get up and walk away when it's narratively convenient? Check. That said, if you care more about the number of people getting shot than about whether you care about the people getting shot or whether characters have any dimension beyond ""good"" and ""bad"", then this might be the film for you.",1477267200,,741,4.707692307692308

6768037,5,B00OV3VGP0,"What I love about this movie is the unprepossessing nature of it.  It doesn't tug at your heartstrings by introducing any sappy romance (the only even slightly romantic aspect is just background, to get the violence in motion).  It doesn't bother with deep moral judgements.  It doesn't dredge up societal moires from fifty years ago.  It's about a man who is very, very good at killing people, and paints, in brilliant, neon colors, WHY YOU SHOULD NOT PISS HIM OFF.
  What really makes the movie stick, though, is that John Wick is not Batman.  He's not a God.  He get cut, he bleeds, he gets hit, he falls down, and...most importantly...HE RELOADS.  The John Wick character is described by his actions as a man who has derived his skills and methodology from practical experience, and the implication is clear that he's had a LOT of it.  I can respect that a lot more than the old chestnut of, ""I was trained by the best to be better than them..."" that you see all too often in action movies today.  You know, the ones where the hero strolls through firefights and ambushes, out-gunned, outnumbered, casually drinking a glass of $1200 scotch and killing dozens of men with his Mateba revolver, without ever once reloading, and without getting more than the slight scar on his cheek (which only exists so that the horny supermodel at the end of the gunfight has a reason to approach him, before tearing off her dress and sexing him up).  None of that rubbish, here (oh, don't get me wrong...I don't MIND horny supermodels, but there's a time and place).
  So, if you're looking for some well-choreographed, intense action, look no further.  I you want intricate plot, moral twists, and all that stuff, you might walk on down the street to a Cruise movie.",1477180800,,1755,4.671009771986971

6768110,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Just...wow. WOW. I had heard a lot about this movie before, but had never gotten around to seeing it. After seeing the trailer for the sequel, my wife and I decided to check it out.

John Wick is absolutely nuts...he's hellbent on revenge, and the finesse and grace with which he enacts that revenge is what impressed me most. This is a revenge story with little in actual story and tons of incredible action sequences, which in my opinion compares with something like dead pool, minus the humor. John Wick looks like he is gracefully dancing as he takes on a literal army of mafia goons with some of the most impressive gunplay i've ever seen in a movie. It tackles concepts like loss, revenge, betrayal and sacrifice with such respect, and comes out better for it. This is truly an entertaining movie, and I can't wait to see where John Wick goes next!

And for that he kills somewhere around a hundred people.  I can just imagine the sequel.

What the body count is above average. Far far above average. Now if you like revenge movies that have a reason and a meaning to them in like to see the bad guys get their just rewards, then you will love this movie is much as I did. All the acting is superb right down to the small parts. I gave this movie five stars because I actually watched it twice I liked it so much. Once the action starts it does not stop. For those who might say that it's too violent or over the top, I say to them that they simply do not understand this movie. And it's got a great soundtrack to go with that as well.

The action scene in the club, in which John Wick uses gun-fu on several dozen opponents was the best action scene since Blade or Tom Cruise in Collateral. I bought both the movie and the soundtrack to listen and watch over and over. The premise was similar to a Mel Gibson movie that I saw many years ago called Payback. It too, had the revenge plot built around something in which the payback was far worse than what was lost. The Mel Gibson movie was also a classic in my book, and I have it in my collection too.

I guess I didn't see the part about this movie just being about Keanu Reeve's character getting the s*** beat out of him, and him beating the s*** out of a bunch of other guys. So if you like violent movies with blood, knives, guns, and whatever else was going on that I was tuning out at this point, this is the movie for you.

I am a few years younger than Keanu, exercise daily, and I jumped out of a tree yesterday from about 5 feet up, stuck the landing, and called it a victory. I'm wondering how he jumped off the stair balcony in his house without yelling ""Crap! My knees!"" And after his first brutal ass-whooping, he got up the next day and put a suit on and had an abrasion on his cheek. In the real world, he would have laid in his bed for 2 days unconscious, and then died from head trauma.",1472947200,2,861,4.094674556213017

Retired, lost his wife to some unnamed disease, John Wick everyday contemplates suicide until some gangsters' son steals his 69 Mustang and kills the Beagle puppy his wife gave him before she died. Then with long legged unstoppably determined stride, a face like granite of frozen pain, gold coins and plenty of weapons and ammunition, Keanu sets out to return the his universe to grieving for his wife. However, on the way to gunning down every bad guy possible, he discovers that he wants to not only live but get another puppy as well. Where anti-heroes used to just go on being anti-heroes in a bleak existence, the closing scene of John Wick finds our anti-hero less existentially threatened by his own hand or gangsters (because they are all dead)John Wick walking away through the rain a new dog -- a clumsy pit-bull puppy tagging along.

Except for the key bad guys, who dodged plenty of bullets.  And of course, Wick dodged plenty of bullets too.  I expect a certain amount of unreality in action movies, but the unreality here was unimaginative.  And the characters were shallow: everybody was fearless and willing to risk near-certain death because they were commanded to kill (bad guys) or to avenge a murdered puppy (Wick).  I can enjoy a well-made action movie with little plot and no realism, but this one was sort of the uncanny valley: it tried to be set in reality, with sympathetic characters, and touching motivations, but it failed.

The performances are good.  The plot is fairly cookie cutter, but is engaging enough.  The usual tropes all apply-- the big bad, the bad girl, the old friend who may or may not betray the hero, the elderly wise counsellor-- but it works out well enough.

I can understand how this movie can be underwhelming if you are expecting a complicated storyline with twists & turns, conspiracy theories, a subplot within a subplot within a subplot, and lots of explosions.  This movie's premise is simple.

If you want to watch the movie, and do not want to know more, stop reading this review.

If you are slightly interested, I won't be revealing too much about the ending or the main plot...

...then keep reading below...

...otherwise, stop right here.

POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT

Keanu's wife died. While grieving, thugs steal his car and kill his dog. A retired mob hitman, he seeks revenge. People die.

""John Wick"" is a great yet underrated B-movie. Keanu plays the part surprisingly well. He uses his hitman cache to seek out those responsible for his physical and emotional pain, and goes to town.

The cast includes John Leguizamo, William Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, and Alfie Allen (aka Theon Greyjoy).  The cast alone should make you want to at least consider watching this movie.

Probably my favorite movie quote comes from the scene where the mob boss Viggo (Nyqvist) was explaining to his spoiled son Iosef (Allen) John Wick's past as an associate. Iosef prematurely assumed that John Wick was called ""The Boogyman."" Viggo corrected him. ""John wasn't exactly the Boogeyman. He was the one you sent to kill the f-ing Boogeyman."" Mic drop. Iosef's realization was succinctly captured by his one-word stunned response ""Oh.""

Could it have been better? Maybe.  But IMO the movie was fine as it is.

Oh, and there is a ""John Wick 2"" in the works.  Highly recommended.",1470787200,,1726,4.940972222222222

As a bonus, as good of an actor as Keanu is, he's much better in action and when he's not doing too much talking. In this flick, he doesn't do much talking but lots of shooting.

6768583,3,B00OV3VGP0,"You have seen this type of movie before and the positive ratings are way overblown. Fight scenes are good but no where near as good as the Bourne series or even the recent Equalizer with Denzel Washington. In fact, if you have to choose...see the Equalizer. It's the same movie just much better.

John Wick starts with character building but it is done incredibly poorly. I think most would agree that the film really should have started about 20 minutes in with the gas station scene. Keanu is decent but nowhere near his best. Ian McShane, Micheal Nyqvist, and Adrianne Palicki are pretty good. No one else is memorable. The story line is as you would expect and could be much, much better. Cinematics are good, but again not where they should be. Overall, if you are bored - by all means watch it. But if you have anything better, avoid this.",1470528000,,845,4.559210526315789

6768588,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Great movie. Once the action gets going, it's nonstop, and even though I hate what's happened to the way hand-to-hand combat is filmed in Hollywood, this movie does a lot to try to redeem that. Keanu at his best!

6768744,5,B00OV3VGP0,"'John Wick' came to us in theaters during an influx of assassin-related films seemed to be hitting the theaters across the globe. To break away from the pack Keanu Reeves needed to will the film through the similarities between the sub-genre and lot of films that came out during the time period. When you look at films like 'Safe House' or 'The Mechanic' it becomes evident that 'John Wick' could linger into the same trap that this sub-genre is susceptible to. Truthfully I love everything about the assassin-related sub-genre, but finding something to truly connect with is a rare breed when considering the formula used to make these films.

Looking at Keanu Reeves' acting in 'John Wick' I have come to find this one of his best performances. The entire film revolves around John Wick and his transition from the assassin lifestyle to pseudo-retirement, back to full-time assassinating. While there is a pretty strong cast around Keanu (Willem Dafoe, John Leguizamo, Michael Nyqvist, Ian McShane to name a few) the linchpin that carries the entire film is Keanu. Portraying a wide multitude of emotions, physical stunts and work that is taxing to watch let alone perform, and deep emotional scenes throughout, Keanu delivers from the first scene through to the end. If you couldn't tell already I believe Keanu Reeves absolutely wills the film to success. But with his performance aside I want to hit on some of the other amazing components.

The action was raw and exhilarating. Each scene felt like it had to outdo the last and the building up of the drama only seemed to heighten as time went on. The choreographing and fight coordinating worked so well together that they truly did feel like part of the film and not just additions to keep the viewer's attention.
The emotion was intense and fulfilling. I think one of the most under rated aspects of 'John Wick' was the raw emotion throughout the story. We are meant to suffer with John Wick as he relives his past, endures the present, and plans for a better future. For assassin-genre films the emotional component his quite high.
I also thoroughly enjoyed the entire look of the film. I wouldn't exactly consider the film's color dulled, but the color choices are much darker and more deep rooted giving the entire film a more dark and mysterious feel.

I highly recommend 'John Wick' for anyone looking for an action flick, a Keanu Reeves success, or an assassin-genre top title. 'John Wick' is sure to please from first note to the final huzzah.

6768833,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Revenge flicks will never go out of style.  There is almost nothing more satisfying than when we see the bad guy get his. Depending on you political leaning, you either feel comfortable in letting others make you decisions for you or helpless you can't control the locomotive running down the track directly at you.
John Wick succeeds in taking control of the train and making it do his will.
Keanu Reeves as taken all kind of crap over the years about his acting, unjustly, I believe.  He is spot on as John Wick.  His training for this movie is amazing. (watch youtube vide on Reeves doing three gun and hand to hand training)
As a pistol safety instructor and competitive shooter, movies and TV that don't take the time to give the actors some training are dishonest and potentially dangerous.  Not to the actors necessarily, but to the general public that watches a movie and decides that what takes place on the screen is gospel.
Even thought John Wick is very stylized, the firearm depictions are accurate.  Everyone involved in this movie and especially Keanu Reeves, worked their asses off to pull this off.
Can't wait for John Wick 2.",1465776000,5,1143,4.695

6768846,5,B00OV3VGP0,"This is the best of Keanu Reeves. A man emotionally torn apart by the death of his wife only to be given a small ray of hope in the form of a gift from the very same wife. A puppy lovingly named Daisy.

However this hope of a normal life is ripped away by the son of his former employer. This act causes John, the family man, to turn back into John Wick, the unflinching, lethal, assassin bent on getting his revenge.

The character shows a softer emotional side one moment, then unflinching focus and ruthlessness the next. The type of person you'd want to have on your side. The type you'd never want to cross. Even the law gives him the respect warranted to someone with his capabilities.",1465430400,,691,4.348837209302325

The colors and not saturated and appear crisp in neon signs and appropriately white in interior lit scenes.
No blurring or tearing is visible during any of the myriad fight scenes.

6768946,5,B00OV3VGP0,I truly enjoyed this movie. It's rare to find a movie where you want to root for the guy doing all of the killing but I absolutely did. This movie had a wonderfully realized world to it. You can tell the writers and director spent a lot of time on getting the details right. There were points that were truly sad--especially the beginning--and points where I laughed out loud. I would absolutely watch this movie again and I'm delighted to hear they are planning a sequel. Fair warning: there is a lot of violence in this move so it's not for the young or faint of heart.,1463961600,,571,4.345794392523365

6768974,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I cannot get over that Keanu Reeves was 50 years old when he shot this movie.  That man is incredible.  I've been a fan of his for a long time, I think many people cannot get past the ""B&T's Excellent Adventure"" but I think he's a brilliant actor.  He gives so much of himself to each character he plays.

The action sequences in this movie are FABULOUS and very believable.  I love the fact that he always makes sure that the enemies are dead.  None of this ""comes awake and fights again"".  Why leave himself vulnerable by leaving them alive?  Right?

Highly recommended.",1463616000,,572,4.475728155339806

Having recently loss his wife to a lingering illness, Wick's grief is assuaged by an unexpected gift planned for him prior to her death. But the ruthless son of a Russian mobster takes that and another prized possession from him. This touches off a murderous rampage of revenge by Wick who comes out of retirement in a big way: running into the forces of the mobster and some old friends who all stand in his path to his ultimate target. Also starring Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Willem Dafoe, Dean Winters, Adrianne Palicki, Toby Leonard Moore, Ian McShane, Bridget Moynahan, and Lance Reddick.

Again, an Extremely high body count - the highest I can recall seeing in a movie. R-rated for Violence. Great revenge component, so you don't flinch at all when the Criminals get their just desserts. Again, Eastern European hyper-criminals who simply won't listen to reason.
The entire orgy of violence centered on a stupid psychopath (the first photo) -- but connected though -- and a dog.  Along the way - very interesting characters, including a female mobster. Willem Dafoe's character kept us guessing. Producer credit: Eva Longoria; I found that interesting.

I was most impressed with the civility of the various criminal elements as they interacted with Keanu's character while he searched for the object of his revenge.  In some instances they were a delightful switch from all the action that preceded their scenes.  The cop visiting Keanu's house because of a noise complaint was precious; ""Everything all right?"" ""Yup."" ""All right then. Have a good night."" (paraphrased, obviously) pointed out law enforcement's helplessness with a situation that they had absolutely no control over, but wisely understood that it wasn't their business (at least where Keanu's house was located).  The ending was long drawn out - protracted isn't too harsh a word - but it finally ended well, although I would have chosen a different dog at the end (watch the movie).",1462060800,,920,5.147651006711409

6769230,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I really loved this movie, great action but what I like most was the writing and the characters.  The beginning was a little rough, not much of a spoiler to note the puppy being killed. I liked the atmosphere created-the whole underground of assassins with their code of conduct and funky world of gold coins and speaking in code. The acting was great, the characters were all super-I wanted to know more about them. Visually the way it was filmed was interesting-great views of NYC that you don't often see. I hope the sequel is good. It would be cool for it to be a prequel.",1460851200,,576,4.433962264150943

6769244,5,B00OV3VGP0,"The next time some Hollywood Lefty starts complaining about gun violence in society, remind them that their beloved Hollywood cranked out this pedal to the metal, stylized blood bath featuring handguns, shotguns, assault rifles, grenades, stilettos, etc with a heavy metal sound track.  This is a well made revenge flick for the 21st century.  Reeve's character beats up, stabs, runs over and shoots more bad guys than you can count.  Willem Dafoe is excellent as a fellow professional hit man, and so is Michael Nyqvist as the bad guy Russian mobster.  This movie doesn't take itself too seriously and understands it is a bloody revenge flick thrill ride, nothing deeper or more meaningful.",1460160000,,691,5.088495575221239

6769274,5,B00OV3VGP0,One of the best Keanu Reeves movies ever (admittedly it is a short list of  candidates). Extreme violence in gun-fu style. A great supporting cast enhances the quality plus an outstanding performance by Daisy the Beagle. Lots of graphic violence and not for the young. Makes Jason Bourne look like an amateur but that is what happens when your peers call you The Boogeyman.  This is the birth of a franchise for Keanu Reeves -- a long time since Matrix. Worth a watch.,1459209600,,468,4.626506024096385

6769406,3,B00OV3VGP0,"I can't wait for the Key and Peele Spoof of this movie ""Keanu.""  It was the main reason for giving it a shot. This was such a cliched film start to finish. Though the opening scenes almost tricked me into thinking this film might be a litter deeper or less hackneyed.  But it quickly devolved into your typical vengeance fair that Hollywood and the public loves to fetishize. I have heard Keanu criticized often for his wooden, surfer-guy acting and it never bothered me so much as it did in this film. And I would even defend him sometimes thinking, he isn't that bad. But he really has almost no emotional range, (SPOILER Below) ....

...the best he can do to express the anger and sadness of his wife dying and his dog too is to increase the volume of his voice.
Again this movie is ripe for parody cannot wait for the spoof treatment.
Its funny how an actor like Liam Neesom can add gravitas to an inherently foolish plot just by being Liam Neesom. I almost think if he did this film it would be better just for that fact alone, and its glaring flaws would fade to the background.",1457654400,,1084,4.356435643564357
6769407,1,B00OV3VGP0,"What a lousy, crummy, BAD movie!  Fortunately, for Reeves' ""John Wick', the bad guys are utterly predictable, incredibly poor marksmen and are interminably stupid.  Not surprisingly, they have absolutely no concept of teamwork.  If the bad guys had any qualities beyond their ability to act as bullet sponges, they would have killed John Wick easily and quickly.

Lots of violence and gun play but no brains.  At all.",1457654400,3,417,5.073529411764706

And John Wick (played by bearded Keanu Reeves), who happens to be one of the best gunmen in the underworld, is back in business now.

John Wick benefits from the stylish photography and impressive performances from the supports including Ian McShane, John Leguizamo and Willem Dafoe, but the story itself is a pretty standard one, with our vengeful hero slowly showing what he is capable of. For action sequences directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch have opted for the so-called gun-hu style, mixture of close combat and gun shooting. (Remember Equilibrium and its hyper-kinetic gun-kata action? The action of John Wick is realistic than that, well, just slightly.)

With such ideas as a hotel managed by a league of contract killers  its mild-mannered concierge seems to know everything about you  John Wick is an adrenaline-filled action movie that knows what it is doing. It is pure, unapologetic escapism and it works as such.",1457568000,,1114,4.994594594594594

The interesting this is whether or not the genie can be put back in said bottle. Whilem  Dafoe, Ian McShane, and Adrian Palwicki  added that extra in their roles.

 John Wick:
You've got Russian crime lords. Modern day urban legends. The requisite arsenal buried under concrete for that rainy day. A fully fleshed out criminal underworld that operates on gold coins & its own particular brand of honor. And puppies.
Oh yeah, fight scenes, gun battles, car chases, and more that all use their stylish and unique locations that really add some cache.
Also, Willem Defoe, John Leguizamo, and lots of ""that's the guy that did that thing!"" Prepare to IMDB.

Ever since ""Bill and Ted"", I never took Keanu seriously...in fact, I haven't paid to see any of his movies since B&T.  In ""John Wick"", Keanu looks exponentially more mature than any of his previous movies both in appearance, stage presence and believably.

6769513,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Rare to see a good movie these days.  Reeves is not known to be a quality actor...more like a cheesy actor that stumbles into the right roles....many of which have been......poor choices, with a few iconic ones thrown in.

John Wick is an exception.  There is nothing special about the role.  And as far as I know, this was never promoted to any degree when it was in theatres.  It basically came to my attention purely because it was a trailer in a different movie I rented.  Normally, I would have skipped this except the trailer was exceptional.

Reeves takes a mediocre role and, for a change, does a spectacular job acting it, making this a superior film.  It's tough to describe the personality of the protagonist except by comparison.  He's like Clint Eastwood in a Fistful of Dollars.  Not on the surface mine you.  He's a very, very, bad man who redeemed himself only to have some idiots come along and give him good reason to snap.

Oddly, it cost more to simply buy the Blu-ray version then rent it on Amazon.  Which says something about media sales.",1456444800,,1061,4.550264550264551

I bought this movie just to have something different and was well pleased that I did. Mr. Reeves showed he could play a dark and tough character and appear believable. I think I'd like to see him in more movies like this. I didn't rate this film with 5 stars because I don't consider it a blockbuster or future classic.

6769535,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Keanu at his action best.  Crazy violent.  A bit like a strange cross between ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", ""Constantine"" (just with regard to the brooding character Keanu plays).  Really, it's a great, well choreographed, old school action flick with a modern choreographic spin.

Most people have never heard of John Wick, I'm not sure when if when the movie came out if it was up against some blockbuster film or what... it seems to have quietly moved through the theaters without getting the recognition that it deserved.

A must have for your action movie collection.",1455840000,,564,4.894736842105263

6769537,3,B00OV3VGP0,"Keanu Reeves is the most annoying actor ever except maybe for Nicholas Cage.  Let's get that out of the way first.

This can be overcome if the movie is good enough.  Interstellar was really good and Matthew Mcconaughey and Michael Cain are also annoying actors.  Although to be fair, they both do a good job in that film. MM is just a little annoying and Michael Cain not at all.

OK back to John Wick.  This is the standard formula Hollywood ridiculous movie, ridiculous setting, ridiculous character movie that you've seen dozens of times over the years.  You know the story, the plot is so ridiculous I can't bear to explain it.

But the bottom line is Wick kills a bunch of people.  There are no surprises, there is nothing deep, there is nothing you haven't seen before.  The best part of this movie is the appearance of several decent actors. They add almost enough to make the movie decent.  It plays like a superhero movie and is about as believable.

I have no idea why this movie is rated so highly on Rotten Tomatoes.  Three stars for action and it's a gift.  This is a 2.5 star movie.",1455840000,,1097,4.447236180904523

6769541,5,B00OV3VGP0,My favorite Keanu Reeves of all time!  Non stop action that does convey a thrilling story of revenge.  The way they convey the feelings of the characters and Keanu's portrayal of John Wick is just spectacular.  You really get pulled into the action as they limit the super Kung-Fu and keep him mostly just a highly talented if not lucky killer.,1455753600,,344,4.60655737704918

It was a semi-serious movie that thankfully had just enough irreverence to make it a lot of fun. I am not a big fan of spoilers, so, I tend to not add any of them. There is one bit of this one I will add, One of the characters got called by a ""boss"", his response when demanded why he did something was awesome. Transgression dropped. That was funny, but only one of the first of many great scenes. If you like such little things that make great movies, you'll enjoy this one.",1455580800,,569,4.04424778761062

One main  example, when the Character John wick returns to the Hotel injured and asks if there is a  Doctor on duty,  the Manager assures him one is available 24/7 and he recommends drink as a pain killer.... Blanton's bourbon.  In this version the actual brand of the bourbon is omitted and just bourbon is mentioned.  Minor aspect, but if  are a purist....this may be a sticking point.  There are some extra scenes involving his wife's demise that is included.

6769649,2,B00OV3VGP0,"There isn't much good to say about this movie. It wasn't absolutely horrible, which is why I gave it two stars and not one, but overall, this movie is low quality in my opinion. The following is what makes it low quality in my opinion. Please note that I will not give spoilers in this review, so some of these things may be intentionally vague.

1. The plot is completely predictable, and a bit bland. It's simply a revenge movie.
2. Character development, as well as most other things in the plot were rushed.
3. The movie was highly unrealistic, with rambo-style combat. John never misses and his enemies never hit type of thing. There are several instances where his enemies have him circled, and two or three of then just stand there staring at point blank with guns in their hands, waiting for John to finish off their accomplices.
4. I found the movie more disturbing than entertaining. Don't get my wrong either, I'm no pansy. I watch many R rated movies of this nature with lots of killing, blood and violence (The Punisher is an example of a very similar movie that I enjoyed, with an equally high level of blood and gore). But this movie has a particular seen that I cannot say without spoiling, that I found so exceptionally disturbing, it became a distraction from the rest of the movie.
5. The end of the movie was very rushed, and I found it very unsatisfying. It went along with the rushed and undeveloped nature that the rest of the movie seemed to have. All you ever seem to get is just a small taste.

Overall, if I were to describe this movie in three words, I would say this movie is undeveloped, rushed and predictable. A very bland and lousy film that I suggest you do not watch.",1454198400,,1702,4.451923076923077

This is his comeback. Movie wasted no time hitting hard and fast. The tagline should have been what he tells the crime boss is the reason he killed his son. As he is strapped to a chair, mind you.
Wilem Dafoe gives a good performance as well. Enough action for any hard core fan.
Lastly, only other problem is his stomach wound, which he gets while he is wearing a full vest.....

the movie is great, i was wondering when sarcasm would catch up to the movie biz.  he goes on a ""15 state killing spree"", cause they killed his dog, awesome.  well at least it wasn't one of the old worn out reasons like, oh, a friend or family member killed.  so over done.  i might be exaggerating when i say 15 state killing spree, a little.",1451952000,,1148,4.293023255813954

Good action, but highly unrealistic in the sense that the police are almost nowhere to be found, if I am not mistaken, one cop in the whole movie. Most killers like to be able to stay around and shoot up a place with impunity, but this movie takes it to a new level. Apparently, everyone left their cell phones at home, or were just not interested in phoning the police, while witnessing numerous public shootings.  At least no innocent bystanders were shot in the film, with all that lead flying.  A home alarm system might be a good idea as well, before John Wick 2.  Remember Death Wish.

6769757,2,B00OV3VGP0,"I was fully expecting John Wick to be a serious badass, but I was disappointed that he seemed to get lucky more than anything.  Perhaps it was an attempt at some realism, but this would be more believable perhaps if he didn't just go through the front door every time.  No special weapons/gadgets.  No elaborate ruse.  Just charging in and taking out the enemies one at a time.  Maybe my expectations were a little too high for this action flick, but I thought the Amazon reviews (4.2 out of 5 stars out of 5930 reviews) were quite a bit exaggerated.  The beginning started off with some great emotional character development, but dropped off from there.  I liked how they portrayed a code among assassins, and how that can easily be corrupted.

6769791,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Makes the Liam Neeson film  ""Taken"" look like a high school rendition of ""My Fair Lady!"" Keanu Reeves establishes himself as a Class-A bad-a** cast in the mold of Vigo Mortenson (History of Violence), Jason Patrick (The Prince) and Mel Gibson (Payback) and the long line of BAMF's that have starred in movies where ultra-vengeance by a nearly indestructible ""retired"" (hit man, enforcer, commando, big city cop... or other outwardly milk-toast unassuming nice guy, living a new life, has to revert to his former cold blooded, heartless, never-miss-a-shot, physically fit guy next door, with a buried personal stash of weaponry, in pristine condition, that requires our hero to bust the concrete floor of his garage... to get to his ""In case of Armageddon Break Floor"" collection of every conceivable handgun, shot gun, automatic rifle, 50 caliber sniperware, grenades and RPG you can imagine. He of course, has a bullet proof vest and sufficient ammo and explosives to wipe out any adversary.
So what motivates John Wick? (Thank you for reading this far!) John has lost his wife to cancer. Following her death he receives the cutest puppy (from her) so ""he won't have to grieve alone..."" (touching, ain't it?). After being accosted by some eastern european toughs who admire his classic muscle car (and the cute little doggie) he goes home to sleep. Sometime later, he (and the cute little dog who has been sleeping curled up next to him) are awoken by noisy intruders. The intruders beat him senseless, kill the cute dog and steal his car. To sweeten the plot, one of the thugs is the worthless son of Wick's former mob boss.
The boss understands that Wick must avenge his wife (not to forget the dog and that sweet  car!). Nonetheless, as a father, he has to place his army of bad guys in play to protect his A-H son,
The action is non-stop from this point forward. Strap yourself into you favorite seat. Crank the audio! And, if I were you... avoid colas, coffee, tea and anything with caffeine in it. This one is a real pulse pounding vengeance-fest. It's an absolute ""must watch"" for every red-blooded, pistol packing, rifle wielding, card carrying NRA gun freak out there. No offense there, my brother's of the scarlet nape! It'll make you want to enlarge your gun safe into a walk-in vault with a bed in it!

This movie Spoiler has great aspects ,but some that are kinda silly. First pros

Great action
Dark,gritty
Good acting

Cons Spoiler

Why introduce yourself at a gas station and ask to buy if you're going to steal anyway,that is your job, a car thief.

Why is it everyone knows who wick is cops,chop shops,town etc except the thieves and main thief is son of the Big Boss,who is afraid and tells story of wick to son. Makes no sense.

Knows where he lives breaks in wrecks house,kills dog,shows him who he is again by lifting mask. Beats him to a pulp,Then intentionally leave him alive,duh.

Had other opportunities to kill him then as usual, keep talking for a hour after he has killed a 100 people,leaving him a chance to escape,which he does.

Also he loved car stolen looked once at first chop shop. Then kills everyone ,never looked again or found car. Only thing he had left was dog and car after wife died,and he never really looks or finds it the end",1449792000,2,1107,4.392156862745098

6769891,2,B00OV3VGP0,"I came at John Wick with pretty high hopes. I love stylized crime thrillers, I lover Keanu's latter-day work, and I will give fair play to any new IP to escape the creatively bankrupt grave that is modern Hollywood. But in the end? I didn't like it.

I think a lot of the problem is that the movie tells us what it should show us. Wick sees the titular hitman turn on the Bratva that his working days propelled to power, after the sniveling heir to the family (Alfie Allen, who seems fated to play unlikable, doomed little jerks) kills his dog and steals his car. Wick's roaring rampage of revenge is indeed a sight to behold- a ballet of gun-kata-esque shootouts that leave nightclubs and upscale mansions in blood-soaked ruins- but before it begins, the head gangster spends a solid ten minutes explaining how badass Wick really is. Thus, when he handily dispatches a dozen gunmen we aren't surprised in the least. So it goes for the whole film, as every character spends their time either being scared of Wick or being killed by Wick, and not much else.

Wick himself is also rather underdeveloped. He lives in a nice house and drives fast cars and his wife is dead and that's it. We're told that he used to be an awesome hitman who ""got out of the game"" but we really never see this- his life is the thinnest illusion necessary to advance the plot. Fans may say (not totally without merit) that this is because Wick's life outside of the criminal underworld IS a thin illusion, but it also robs the proceedings of a lot of emotional impact.

Even if you shut off your brain and enjoy the mayhem, there are some odd decisions going on in the film. Every battle is a curbstomp one way or another- either Wick kills everyone with ease, or he is beaten to a pulp handily. A whole secret culture of assassins, headquartered in a fancy motel is hinted at, and even uses its own currency consisting of big shiny gold coins (no, really). This suggests a bit of world-building that never pans out. Similar attempts to introduce supporting characters and sub-plots fall flat, as the movie just can't be bothered to take a break from the breathless action. Make no mistake- the action in John Wick is beautifully done, but I feel like in the intervening years since the Matrix, maybe Keanu's audience has earned the right to expect more.

In terms of the package, the BD release is very sharp with loud, resonant sound and very little digital mucking with the picture to get in the way of the glorious violence. Features are a bit spare, which is par for the course with a smaller release.",1448323200,,2582,4.522483940042827
6769892,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Best Keanu Reeves movie yet. I can't wait for the next one. I have spent my entire adult life in the military or law enforcement and this movie is second only to HEAT in the realism of the weapon handling. The ground fighting has rival even close. The combination of the two and Reeves acting  make this great, unsurpassed by anything before it. There are six other actors in this movie that put in great performances also. Michael Nyquist is perfect as the Russian mob boss, his skill in this made me sad that he would not be in the next one. Alfie Allen plays the POS son of the Boss so well that you can't wiat to see him killed. Adrianne Palicki plays a female killer with a great body and some great fight moves. Willem Dafoe is as always a perfectionist. Ian McShane is a true British Gentleman. John Leguizamo has only a small part but he helps make this movie.

The best thing about it is Keanu Reeves he's the salvation

It's a cheap revenge style action film where they kill a puppy just for cheap shock and awe

Dean Winters,  Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe,  David Patrick Kelly, and  John Leguizamo are all misused or underused which is such a shame the film overall is anti-climatic (maybe it was budget reasons but, still) Nobody can say anything bad about this film i don't get it?

John Wick is a Hipster Gen Me film! It got legs cause some jerk-off pumped it up and others followed

Don't make the mistake of thinking that K's weapon load out, semi-synthetic suits, aggressive gunfight technique, the idea of safe haven Hotel and the 100 other facets of this movie that reflect the grey area few know of are not 95% accurate. The use of the Krugerrand was also a great touch and much more widely used for currency than many people think. Krugerrand's are 22k gold and weight slightly more that a Troy Oz. so they equal one Oz. pure (24k) gold. Nice cover charge for a club. The Barrel extensions on his primary pistols (P226?) top vent to reduce muzzle rise, extend overall barrel length to increase exit velocity and accuracy: which given he's probably using high PSI ammo makes em' 10"" long rifles. Ah, tangents.... Anyway, my point was the movie also showed them being used for (by design) as melee tools. Most 'pistol whips' you see in movies would seriously injure someone if not kill them. His do both depending on magazine capacity. I'm telling you this movie had great advisors!

Watch and see the confidence of a man that KNOWS HE AS THE TOOLS and think twice

My rule, as an editor, is to let each film, or book or piece of art, prove itself by its own virtues.  John Wick, is one of the finest films of its genre I have had the pleasure of experiencing. Yes, it is an action film, guns, death, brutality, sexual exploitation and extra helpings of creative violence. But really it is so much more than all that, because John John Wick is a genuine work of pure action storytelling that has blessed its genre, the film will stand on its own merits for decades to come. This is a film that knows what it is and never strays from the path it has chosen. Never losing sight of what it wants, it cannot be stopped and does not get lost or distracted from the purity of its mission.

 John Wick immediately immerses you in its mood which is masterfully crafted by it's cinematography, sound design, editing, acting and directing. All the technical and creative elements work in harmony and become invisible. Only the journey and it's story exist. You become cloaked in the environment that defines John Wick's universe. You attest to the pain which he can no longer feel. Stand witness to the trail of violence left behind him as he moves ever forward to collect the justice he feels is owed. You are there to forgive him for all that he cannot forgive in himself..",1444867200,,1375,4.448412698412699

6770055,5,B00OV3VGP0,"This story goes beyond just a story of revenge, but reveals the depth of grief and betrayal that Wick experiences. Wick is willing to put his own life on the line and goes against the odds, even with his skills. Also, the cinematography and direction give a fascinating surreal cast to the whole movie yet it is beyond the graphic novel shadows. Keanu Reeves continues to be a fascinating presence on film. He has the same walk first seen in ""My Own Private Idaho"" and maintains emotional levels that are always. The rest of the cast contribute great performances. Willem Dafoe is in his wonderful zone and Ian McShane does a great turn. Michael Nyqvist left me wondering why he isn't more seen. More roles for John Leguizamo please!

If that's what you are after, this flick does not disappoint! Once a sometimes slow moving but necessary character development is complete, the blindingly fast character - John Wick - delivers on his nearly mythical reputation amongst those of the seedy side of this big city's underworld. Not to give away too much, Mr. Wick takes on an incredible number of the ""soldiers"" and their masters in his all but forgotten world. And all to redeemed the memory of a gift given by his one true but tragic love. Given away too much?

If it was a series, it would be up there with the Bourne and Mission Impossible franchises.  Perhaps even better.  Yep . . . I just wrote that, and I mean it.",1442102400,,564,4.375

6770246,5,B00OV3VGP0,"John Wick is an action packed movie with a cast of very tried and true stars. Keanu Reeves plays John Wick, a former hitman who, as Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) says, ""Is the man you call to kill the Boogeyman"".

Wick receives a puppy from his now deceased wife which gives him a glimmer of hope that life doesn't totally suck. While filling up his classic Mustang at a gas station, Russian thugs, including Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), son of Viggo who make overtures about getting the car. Wick refuses. Later that night the same thugs come into Wick's house, kill the dog, beat up Wick and steal the car.

Wick come out of retirement and the body count starts. The total body count, according to IMDb.com is 119 with 77 or 84 attributed to Wick depending on who gives the answer, IMDb or Reeves. Regardless, this is a from the start ""GO!"" movie which any action junkie is sure to love.",1440892800,2,891,4.493827160493828

6770256,2,B00OV3VGP0,"I guess there is a very general sort-of spoiler ahead, if you wish to avoid such things.  I wanted to like this movie because I have enjoyed many of Keanu's efforts before.  I have an impression that he is not as popular an actor as he should be, and wanted to add my anticipated appreciation to his reviews here.  Unfortunately, I was so disappointed in the movie that I can not.  The plot and roles were predictable, with no particular twists.  ""Oh no, the super-bad guy is coming for certain revenge!"" about sums it up.  Yawn.",1440806400,,529,4.458333333333333

6770259,2,B00OV3VGP0,"Well , I suspect maybe this movie was done after a comic book of some similar story line.  Unlike others who gave bad ratings, I am not giving it two stars because of violence per say,  but for the unrealistic luck of John Wick.  No one is going in a night club and have a couple dozen shooters coming from all directions and one guy (John Wick) the gunjitsu expert shoot every single one of them dead and walk out.  As for plot yes there was a plot.  As for dialog, yes not much dialog in this movie.  That didn't bother me too much, and if you just want a revenge movie with lots of shooting, this is your best bet.  If that's what you like, who's to judge you.  I just like the revenge to be more believable and thoughtful, as in clever.  I'm just glad I only paid $5 for this.  Now I'll take it to the thrift store where some teenage boy will probably pick it up for a $1 and enjoy the heck out of it.",1440720000,,905,3.977777777777778

6770273,1,B00OV3VGP0,"While entertaining, I thought John Wick could have been better.

When you read the description about a man who's dog dies and he starts a quest for revenge, you don't think they're actually going to kill a puppy in the movie. Secondly, the movie was predictable from the start and didn't leave much room for excitement besides the ""gun-fu"" used during every action sequence. I can only think of one ending that would of sold me on giving this more than 1 star. The puppy lives and is nursed back to health by John Wick's wife who gave him the puppy. Although John's wife died in the opening scenes she also miraculously lived but was hidden away in witness protection faking her death.

Upon Johns impending demise during one of the gun battles she bursts through a nearby window, with the pup in tow. Some how the pup is fully grown even though the movie has only spanned a couple of days. The dog springs into action and takes down the bad guy by vaulting over a table dodging 6 bullets from the assailants gun and delivers a vicious bit to the throat before he's able to dispose of John. John's wife walks over with cold hatred in her and shoots the guy in the face point blank and says ""You've just been Wicked"".

Then she shoots John in the face... fade to black.",1440547200,,1268,4.410256410256411

6770279,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Although the generalities of the plot are familiar, this is one of the best action movies made.  A story of personal loss, injury and revenge with far reaching ramifications.  It channels the desire for  an ability to transform rage and helplessness into a way to strike back at the cause of emotional and physical pain. With minimal use of dialogue, Keanu Reeves plays the perfect conduit for this purpose.  His nonverbal expression and physical acting make him the perfect everyman with elite fighting skills.  The technical interweave of judo / jujitsu and firearms combatives used to narrate the story, instead of just existing inside it, made the violence of the movie an expository character which deftly guides the viewer to the foregone primal emotional release.",1440460800,,770,5.128

6770283,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Keanu Reeves.  It is a name closely associated with career defining roles and missed opportunities.  He has had some of the top fan favorite roles and cultural icons over the last twenty five years. From Neo (The Matrix Trilogy), to Ted (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure), John Constantine (Constantine) to Jack Traven (Speed).  He has been a part of science fiction remakes (The Day the Earth Stood Still), Expiramental Animation (A Scanner Darkly) and Horror (Bram Stoker's Dracula).
 Mr. Reeves has shown an acting range from the dramatic, comedy and physical action.  Though he has had a tremendous career his characters have tended to flat and a little unbelievable.

 Sure he proved in Speed that he could be an ""action star"", in The Watcher that he could be creepy and could handle lead acting duties in a franchise with The Matrices though his roles had become diminished over the last five years.  Though his performances have never been bad, the expectations that surround him have always been out of reach.  Then came John Wick.

 As of late, Mr. Reeves has begun a comeback of sorts.  The phrase ""of sorts"" is used as his comeback is not finished yet.  It started with Man of Tai Chi and 47 Ronin and has continued into John Wick.  It has the feel of a role that is perfect for Mr. Reeves' acting abilities.  John Wick is a character who is dark and brooding.  The character is not put into a position where he would express happiness.  He is angry, sad, and on the verge of grief throughout the film.  Mr. Reeves' ability to perform choreographed action scenes is put on display here.  These range from intense fighting scenes to wonderfully choreographed shootouts to elaborate set pieces that border extravagant but don't cross the line.

 Several times throughout the film the fight scenes are set up in a manner that allow Mr. Reeves to perform in a flawless manner.  This is done by letting the camera roll.  As opposed to the standard practice constant cuts during filming and letting the editors piece together a fight scene, the director of John Wick keeps the camera rolling and allows the audience to experience John Wick's physical struggle and exhaustion.  These are not simple fight scenes either.  In a couple of instances the actors are having to perform dozens of physical moves while the camera demands perfection.  Mr. Reeves not only succeeds at this but also helps to show the believability that he is capable of in the right circumstances.

 One can only hope that this movie will continue to place Mr. Reeves in strong roles that he is more than capable of continuing to play.  It is a definite treat to see Mr. Reeves at his best again.",1440374400,,2672,4.735357917570499

6770291,3,B00OV3VGP0,"There's something very likable about Keanu, but one thing he's not is menacing.  Even in a movie with almost no talking, he's like pressure treated lumber.  Not only are we supposed to believe Keanu is really mad; we're also supposed to accept that a gang of psychopathic Russian mobsters is terrified of Keanu. Granted, the Russians are not very scary either, but then, this isn't Eastern Promises.

Thing is, the plot of John Wick is essentially the same as a dozen other movies so unless you've never seen Jason Statham, Liam Neeson, Jet Li, Denzel Washington, Viggo Mortensen, Michael Cain, Kurt Russell, Joe Don Baker, Robert Culp, Roy Scheider, Dustin Hoffman, Charles Bronson etc, etc, etc. get even in a revenge story, Keanu just doesn't convince.  The movie looks nice, with some things, like the hotel, that suggest its all a fantasy.  But if it isn't real, that dilutes the story even more.  I came away wishing he was a little more convincing but he's just Keanu with a black suit and some martial arts choreography.",1440201600,,1028,4.8125

The story moves in an excellent fashion with typical Reeves acting style.  It creates a fictional type of world in which professional assassins move and exist outside the mainstream population together with a type of rules oriented ""safe"" areas.

6770305,4,B00OV3VGP0,"I heard from several people, ""You've gotta see John Wick.  It's great!""  You know what was great?  Chow Yun Fat doing this fifteen plus years ago in ""Hard Boiled"".  That was great.  This is merely good.

If you're in the mood for a brutal, take no prisoners revenge flick centered around an ex-super assassin (Keanu Reeves' titular anti-hero) who just won't be stopped then John Wick is your man.  The film, colored in that Omni-present metallic steel blue, follows Wick's character as he drolls around grieving the loss of his wife after he's left ""the business"".  He's ridiculously rich and fairly cultured, but the script doesn't make much of this, other than he's a high class/ high value target killer.  He was also a reluctant assassin who had just completed his career until the son of a Russian mob boss goes and kills his dog (don't worry, it's not graphic) while robbing him.  That's all it takes to unleash the Wickster and watch the body counts start to pile up.

Keanu Reeves has found yet another role where his wooden acting is a blessing and not a curse.  He's required to brood and little else other than look sleek and determined as he dispatches mobster after mobster.  The action style of the film recalls ""The Matrix"" and, especially, a fun dystopian future flick that starred Christian Bale called ""Equilibrium"".  In that film Bale played a special enforcer for the government who was steeped in the art of a fighting style dubbed ""gun-fu"".  [If you like(d) ""John Wick"" I highly recommend ""Equilibrium"".]  There's not a lot of plot or anything deeper than revenge here and the action sequences are sometimes exciting.  You'll root for Wick and the film does a decent job to create his bogey-man persona.  But at the end of the day this movie is ultimately style over substance.",1440028800,,1799,4.748387096774193

6770307,4,B00OV3VGP0,"The storyline? Impossible. Dialogue? Not much to, er, speak of. But if being catapulted through  an hour and a half of rollicking, sparks flying, cars careening action and more firepower deployed than in the War of 1812 this movie will delight you.
Wick, a hit man, comes out of retirement to right a terrible wrong done to him by a sadistic Russian gangster. Wick's path to vengeance is fantastic and relentless, mowing down anyone - heck, anything - silly enough to be in his way. Reeves may surprise you in his deft, satisfying performance as action-antihero. Oh, and look for the ""Mayhem"" guy from the insurance commercials and, just try, to see him as transcending typecasting in his attempt to fulfill his role in this film. It's 'nyet' possible.

6770310,3,B00OV3VGP0,"I had high hopes for this film based on the trailers for it. I really enjoy Keanu and like most of his work. This one just fell flat. It lacked any real substance story wise. I thought stealing a car and killing a puppy was a pretty weak reason for a supposed retired, reformed assasin to completely lose it and go full on assasin mode again. I also thought the fight scenes were too choreographed but not in a good way. A dozen guys attack him at home but he seamlessly takes them out one by one. It kind of reminded me of Commando with 50 guys shooting at Arnie with machine guns and he never gets hit once.

I also thought it was completely stupid that the leader of the bad guys had him tied up in a chair at one point but then leaves him alive only to escape and eventually take out his son. Why would he not have killed him when he had him? Seems there were too many of these types of scenes in the movie that just didn't make much sense overall. And then they end the movie and he never got his car back!! He gets a new dog but they totally drop the ball on the car. It meant so much to him, they should have had him taking off into the sunset with the dog in the passenger seat of the Mustang! Dumb thing to miss really as we knew the Russian guy kept the car he because he liked it so much.

Wick was a gunman for the Russian mob, but then quite when he married. His wife died, but before she died she had a cute dog sent to him so that he would have something to love. Wick formed an attachment to the dog.
But then the son of his prior employer came to his house, stole his car, and killed his dog. The son did not know that he had just hurt the most formidable killer.

Yousef and his cronies steal Wick's car and kill his dog. This dog was super special - John's wife died after suffering with an unknown illness. Prior to her death She arranged to have this dog delivered to John after her funeral. What an act of love.
Throughout the movie John Wick is chasing Yousef,  - everyone he kills is trying to protect Yousef and therefore collateral damage. But there's a couple of times he's saved by Marcus. Old friend, mentor, guardian angel..
Marcus is there. Now once Wick's revenge is satisfied and justice has been served, he checks out of the Continental and heads back towards New Jersey and life in the suburbs. But a phone call from Viggo (THE Russian mob boss) causes John to do a U turn and head to Marcus' (played by William Dafoe) house. The scene at Marcus' house sealed Viggo's fate.

This movie was very emotional within the first 10mins. (the wife's death & the dog) -it's tough for animal lovers  (like me), but, it was a Necessary scene. ...this is what sets Wick off, brings him back to the Continental...
pulling the curtain back and giving us a peek into this professional assassin underworld.

I did not think I would like this movie- I was wrong. This is NOT the Keanu Reeves from ""Speed"" - He's matured as an actor, honed his craft and delivered a stunning performance. This isn't a simple shoot em up flick -it has depth and emotion, ...the story draws you in within that first few minutes and holds you til the very end. And when it ends you wish you had part 2 to pop in the DVD player!

Add this movie to your collection - you will want to watch it again!!! Especially since they have announced part 2 is in the making.",1439251200,5,2373,4.5174825174825175

6770368,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Honestly, I'm not the biggest fan of Keanu Reeves acting skills, though I've always found his movies to be entertaining.  I watched 47 Ronins and didn't like it, and I've seen some other movies from him that were a total bust, but when a friend of mine recommended this movie as unquestionably awesome I was compelled to check it out.

I have to say my friend was right.  Don't let the plot throw you, a man's dog dies and then he goes on a murderous rampage, but as you learn why the death of a family pet prompted a killing spree you'll begin to identify with the main character. The action scenes and storytelling are amazing, and there's a surprising amount of character and humor worked into the movie as John Wick finds himself involved once again in a charming and respectable underground society of assassins.

6770369,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Keanu Reeves is John Wick, as Sean Connery is to James Bond. The flick is a fast action filled roller coaster ride that will whip you up and turn you inside out from beginning to end.

It's been sometime since Keanu chose a script that is befitting his innate talents. I've been a fan for years and felt he wasn't catching anymore waves. I'm happy to say, ""You have a hair trigger aimed at your head. What do you do?"" Well, you shoot everyone you can and keep going. Keanu is most definitely back with a vengence that will keep you coming back for more. Get the popcorn, turn on the surround sound and dim the lights.

The movie (as other reviewers have noted), is a classic ""revenge"" flick, and the action scenes are well executed and bound to keep the audience interested.  The weak point of this movie is the script, which makes characters come across as flat, cliche and lacking complexity.

Yes, it's a revenge movie, but with Keanu it is SO personal it rises above mere revenge - he had his thin thread of  HOPE stolen and killed  from him, and he had to restore his hope in his future. He is great in his part and the supporting actors also do an awesome job making the film feel true to heart. Very violent - but not just for effect - it had a point to be made...........and John Wick DOES make his point. Willam Defoe is also in the movie and I love him and his performance in this movie too.

They would be direct and efficient and would minimize their risk of being hurt back swiftly as possible, and be good at it.

It plays with your emotions by first showing some young punks killing of a puppy given to John Wick by his wife and the pain and anguish it causes John; to then somehow justifying a rampage of human carnage unparalleled in most movies.  If that isn't enough, it shows a hotel where hired killers can rest and play in a neutral zone with rules, standards and ethics.  Really?  Whose the good guys, whose the bad guys or do we just live by a set of situational ethics where one day I am right and the next day I am wrong doing the exact same thing?

The action is good for the most part with some exception but I do feel that the movie was a bit lacking at times. The character development and the backstory felt a bit empty to me and the story could have been done a bit better to develop an emotional connection to the character, especially when Reeves channels his inner Matrix a little too much and the supporting players feeling a bit shallow and one dimension. The story is also treading down familar territory with a plot that has been done many times before. The movie is not a bad one by any means and if you are looking for a violence filled action movie then this will fit the bill. The story is a bit erratic and the plot is a bit lacking overall, leaving me feeling like this could have been more than it ended up being. Not a terrible movie, just not a great one either but for a popcorn action film it entertained me.

6770453,3,B00OV3VGP0,"THE FILM: Word-of-mouth can be very useful in gauging if a film is worth seeing or not, but it can also lead to erroneous expectations. I went into this thinking it would be this absolutely awesome action romp, and to a degree that's true. I just thought it would also be a little more fun. JOHN WICK is by no means a bad film, but one that seems satisfied with a cool soundtrack and brutal, well-choreographed action while having a rather weak foundation of a story. The setup is that John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is an ex-hit-man who gets dragged back into the life after a Russian gangster's upstart son foolishly steals his car and murders his dog. That's it. I wasn't expecting anything deep, mind you, but I would have liked a little more complexity and intrigue. It was straight-forward almost to the point of being boring at times, and without a lot of the production and character design that fleshed out something like MAD MAX FURY ROAD, or the manic humor of KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE. To the film's credit, the action goes against the current trend of flashy camera-work and tricky editing, so one is able to comprehend and appreciate the brutality and choreography. And even though a lot of it takes place at night, geography is never in question and you can tell where people are in relation to each other. These elements were also well-supported by some good special effects, bullet hits, etc. In terms of the world of the film, there were a few nice touches that hinted at a complex criminal underworld, one where assassins have their own hotel and criminals use their own currency. The film was also well-acted for the most part, despite the characters being so shallow apart from Keanu Reeves' John Wick. To me, the film largely wasted talented actors like Ian McShane, Michael Nyqvist and Willem Dafoe by not really giving them anything fun or interesting to do. When it comes down to it, all the film really has is Keanu Reeves' charisma and some admittedly good action, and that wasn't really enough for me. Bringing this back full-circle, expectations can make or break a film and I think I went into this expecting a little too much. For the die-hard action fan who doesn't really care how much story goes along the beatings and bullets, JOHN WICK will do just fine. For those who expect a little more from a film, there's plenty others to choose from.

THE EXTRAS: The special features were fairly standard, but still complemented the film nicely. Being that this is an action film, most of the featurettes are devoted to the stunts and fight choreography. Since the action component of the film was so well-done, it wasn't a surprise to see that so much work went into previs, storyboarding and choreography. There was also a sense of fun with the cast and crew, that they were doing something inventive and new, even if I don't think it came across very well in the finished product. The most interesting ones are probably the first, ""Don't F*#% with John Wick,"" which dealt with Keanu Reeves' character, and ""The Assassin's Code,"" which focuses on the film's unique portrayal of the criminal underworld. To cap things off, there is a directors' audio commentary.

OVERALL: Not being a Keanu Reeves fan, per se, I didn't go into JOHN WICK with expectations of a comeback like I'm sure a lot of people might. It delivers a slick, rather formulaic, revenge/action film and in that respect, it is successful. However, I don't think it's God's gift to action cinema like a lot of people and critics have made it out to be. There simply isn't enough story or dramatic heft to make the action really mean much more than what you see, even if it is ""cool.""  Put simply, it's strengths lie in the brutally efficient and well-filmed action, and a good sense of atmosphere. Keanu Reeves, I could take or leave, but he doesn't bring the film down. Fortunately, the special features redeem this purchase for me, as they provide that additional perspective on the filmmaking process that I expect nowadays. I did grow up on these formulaic action flicks, but as I've grown and seen more and more types of films, my tastes and expectations have also evolved. Maybe if I'd seen this when I was a teenager I would have had the ecstatic reaction that so many people have had, but my present self feels like it could have been so much more.",1437782400,,4347,4.664928292046936

6770538,4,B00OV3VGP0,"A well done but fairly basic assassin revenge flick. Keanu Reeves plays John Wick, a retired assassin for the Russian mob who in a few days loses his wife to cancer, and then has his car stolen and dog killed by the son of the head of the Russian mob.

From that point on it is mostly one long chain of shooting and fighting, that is pretty entertaining, if also completely implausible.

Like other assassin movies, this one suggests there are whole networks of services for assassins like cleaning up bodies, and even a hotel where they can stay in peace that caters just to assassins.

Unlike some such movies, in this one Wick has to actually reload. The fight scenes are choreographed so well they are almost dance like in parts.",1436659200,,733,4.537878787878788

The story isn't something original (what action movie with revenge as a main selling point isn't??) but I liked Keanu Reeves' acting in this movie. He had to act like a man that had lost what meant the world to him, and he was out to 'settle the score,' so to speak.

6770546,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Before watching this, I had never heard of this movie. I came across it while searching for new releases at my local library. I decided to give it a chance, and am glad that I did.

John Wick first seems like your average guy. He recently lost his wife to a disease, cancer I believe, and is having trouble moving on with his life. One day a delivery person drops off a dog that is a gift from his dead wife. John slowly begins to rebuild his life with the dog, that is until a threesome of Russian mobsters decide to break into his home, steal his car, and kill the dog.

Most people would call the police and that would likely be the end of the story. Not John Wick. Word gets out that someone has done a great injustice to Wick, and people begin to panic. It turns out, one of the mobsters is the son of the head honcho. Wick and the boss worked together to arrange several hits, so they know what Wick is capable of. In a desperate plea, he asks Wick to forgive his son's transgression and move on. Wick only has revenge on his mind.

Roughly 70 to 80% of the movie is Keanu moving from one room to the next taking out people guarding the boss' son. At times it seems like he is simply invincible, able to walk into a room filled with guards and walking out without so much as a scratch. Stealth is not his strong suit, as he walks in the front door of a club filled with Russian enforcers. Somehow he makes it through the entire place without a single bullet wound. A tad farfetched to say the least.

He eventually defeats the son and his dad after A LOT of gun battles. At times this movie seems like the location is unimportant, Wick would kill anywhere and everywhere. In the movie, gold coins are exchanged among hitmen, although this is never really explained in detail. Are you given one for each job your complete? Does it matter that Wick has an entire suitcase full? What is the value of these coins? They obviously held some importance, but the writer/director failed to fully explain their significance.

If you're looking for a shoot 'em up, leave no one standing type movie, this is a great pick. It does have some drama at the beginning, but the rest of the movie is strictly gun totting action. While I doubt a sequel will be made, I'd definitely be up for watching another installment.",1436486400,,2307,4.318706697459584
6770547,2,B00OV3VGP0,"""John Wick - you did that to JOHN WICK? DO YOU KNOW WHO JOHN WICK IS?"" ""Oh my God, you did that to JOHN WICK?"" ""John Wick...killed three men with a pencil!"" When I heard that, fifteen minutes into the film, I couldn't help but burst into laughter. Keanu Reeves has all the sinister brooding quality of...a teddy bear. Now, compare this to The Equalizer and Denzel, a smiling mild-mannered man. Just one look in Denzel's eyes and you know he could do you faster than a buzz saw. This film might have been better if (a) Reeves had bothered to speak more than five words every few hours. He doesn't speak for 1/2 hour! What the heck's wrong here? (b) the puppy sequence is absurd. Okay he gets a puppy and the killers whack it. This sends him on a homicidal rampage? Absurd. The film moves surprisingly slowly yet, for all that, compared to all the other garbage floating around...",1436486400,,878,4.459627329192546

The Villain, great acting....and there were several.  Made me believe and hated them.
Keanu Reeves: Well, he's been making movies for so long, sometimes, you forgive him for his acting abilities.  Yet, he's lucked out in so many roles, that have made him an incredible, bankable, A-lister, Superstar!  What I felt is his best, overall: Point Break, Speed, Matrix, The Lake House and of course John Wick.

The action is fast and the gun play, is furious.  It gave you a sense of true police/swat tactics.  Keeping the weapon close to your body, moving rapidly, side to side, shoot and shoot again.  Clean, fast and efficient.

Only downside of the movie for me, was the hoakie attitude of the entire ""Murder for Hire"" underground, secretive society and the Gold Coins.  The Rules of the Continental Hotel, the Front Desk agent, the Femme Killer.  All a bit too cheesy.  Otherwise a great action movie.",1435881600,,926,4.871794871794871

6770641,1,B00OV3VGP0,"Oh my goodness, without any preamble or context, Keanu Reeves' (""John Wick"") wife passes away as our story opens, and she bequeaths him a pet puppy dog.  Next thing you know, three young punks are eyeing Reeves' luxury car as he fills up at a gas station, then break into his home, beat him up, kill his puppy and steal his car.  They take the car to a chop shop run by John Leguizamo.  When Leguizamo, who is apparently under the thumb of the city's Russian mafia bigwig, slugs one of the punks and tells him to take the car elsewhere, he is called on the carpet by his boss.  But the moment he mentions that the car belongs to John Wick, the boss confronts his sons with: ""do you know who John Wick is -- he once killed three men in a bar simply using a pencil.""  Yeah, right.  And Keanu Reeves resembles a menacing hitman in this film about as Sly Stallone could be mistaken for an Oxford don.  It's silly, ridiculous, and utterly unconvincing.  Reeves projects no sense of menace whatsoever, and is completely miscast in the role. But hey, apparently no sane man would mess with John Wick -- how is it he couldn't defend himself in the first place when the punks broke in?  The rest of the movie is given over to Reeves stalking the three thieves and shooting and karate-kicking anyone who gets in his way.  The body count is ridiculous, yet where are the police?  Does anyone take notice?  Reeves confronts the Russian mob boss: ""Step aside, give me your son.""  ""It was just a f--king car, just a f--king dog.""  ""When my wife died, I lost everything.  Your son stole that from me.""  All of which we don't believe for a single instant.  There is not one iota of depth or believability of character in the script.  The whole thing seems like pointless, emotionless exercise.",1435449600,2,1777,4.432098765432099

6770644,5,B00OV3VGP0,"""John Wick"" is great! This is how the story goes: An ex-hitman comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from him.

The cast led by Keanu Reeves (a solid and perfect fit as John Wick) is great. The directing by Chad Stahleski is great. The story & screenplay by Derek Kolstad is great.

The music by Tyler Bates & Joel J. Richard is great. The cinematography by Jonathan Sela is great. The film editing by Elisabet Ronalds is great. The casting by Jessica Kelly & Suzanne Smith Crowley is great. The production design by Dan Leigh is great. The art direction by C.J. Simpson is great. The set decoration by Susan Bode Tyson, set dressings by Phil Budinger, Sean Doyle, Jared Goldfeder, Jimmy Hays, Ricky Moson, Joseph Sacco, Thomas Schneider, Zach Selter, Gordon Tanner & James Whelan is great. The costume design by Luca Mosca is great. The special effects supervised by R. Bruce Steinheimer & coordinated by Drew Jiritano is great. The visual effects supervised by Jake Braver, Jeff Campbell & Colin Davies is great. The stunts coordinated by Darrin Prescott & Chris O'Hara and fights coordinated by Jonathan Eusebio & Jon Valera is great.

This is a great, solid action-thriller that is entertaining and well-made (it is also well-done, too.) Keanu Reeves gives a solid and well-crafted performance as John Wick, a role that is a seemingly perfect fit for him. Chad Stahleski (who has been Keanu's stunt double many times, beginning with ""The Matrix"" & has also coordinated the fights for ""The Matrix Reloaded & Revolutions"" & ""Constantine"") has made a terrific and well-crafted directorial debut. This is (or was) one of the best action films of last year and of the last fall season (fall 2014).

6770646,4,B00OV3VGP0,"I like this genre of movie and I had been anxiously awaiting this one.  I have to give this one 4 and recommend it to folks who enjoy this kind of movie.  It is a quest plot where damage is done (evil) and retaliation is demanded (good).  It starts slow enough and does develop that John Wick cares very deeply about something and all goes wrong.  Then the remnant of recovering from that loss is brutally taken from him.  Immediately thereafter you are alerted that John Wick is The Bogyman.  Rather the one you employ to kill The Bogyman.  And then it begins.  After the first action scene John makes a dinner reservation for 12.  This sent my mind staggering with imagination of what will come next, but it turns out to be much simpler than I imagined.  After this action and resolution the action begins again and never slows.

I did enjoy the quirk in this movie where John Wick was extremely well known in the deepest dark circles of society.

If you've watched a number of this flavor of movies you know pretty well what is coming.  While you never really know exactly what is next, you do understand the next high action scene is only moments away.

If you are looking for pure action in the spirit of Terminator, Jack Reacher, Mission Impossible,  Minority Report, Die Hard, Aliens, Indiana Jones you may enjoy this adrenaline rush.",1435363200,,1341,4.552301255230126

Like those Neeson kill-em-alls, though, it's as straight as an arrow and shallower than the kiddie pool. In some ways, it's refreshing to just dispense with all the stereotypical origin trappings and get right into the firefights, but at the end of the show it just feels like one long, easy excuse to watch a whole mess of cool stuff without any extra justification. Lust-worthy cars, ferocious weaponry, powerful western-styled physicality, stereo-thumping tunes, magnificent cityscapes, the list just goes on and on. Escapists delight, for John Wick has come to deliver a dream. Cinephiles, well just sit back and try to let the sheer, celebratory brutality beat your conscience into submission.

when at home a delivery is made at his door, it's a puppy, accompanied with a note from his wife telling that
he needs company after her passing.
Whilst filling up at a local gas-station he is approached by a cocky-young Russian asking how much he wanted
for his motor....not for sale....
The same night he is woken by the puppy who's heard noises down stairs, it's the young Russian thugs he'd seen
at the gas-station, they give 'John' a beating, kill the puppy and take the car.
The young Russian responsible for the attack is the son of Maffia-Boss 'Viggo Tarrasov' (Michael Nyqvist) who when
learning of his sons 'Iosef's (Alfie Allen) actions he looses his cool, then asks his son if he knew who he'd messed
with.......and tells him.......'John Wick'
'Viggo' had known 'John' before he'd retired as a mob-hit-man to get married some 5 years ago.
The young Russians had messed with the wrong guy -
'Viggo' puts an open contract out on 'John' with a Two Million Dollar reward even inviting 'John's' friend 'Marcus' (William
Defoe) to do the job..........many will try to collect, but can anyone stop 'John' from exacting the revenge he seeks ?
This is 'Keanu Reeves' at his very best in this fast moving action-packed thrill-ride.......Great Entertainment.
Good Picture and Sound Quality throughout.

6770706,1,B00OV3VGP0,"One of the dumbest and most pointless shoot-them-up flicks ever.

For one thing, there isn't really a plot. Not that unusual for shoot-them-up flicks, but still, would be nice if they at least try.

John Wick/Keanu Reeves is totally helpless one minute, and is an unstoppable killer the next minute. One minute a dumb punk totally dominates him and beats the crud out of him. The next minute John Wicks destroys 10 people without breaking a sweat. The next minute he gets crushed by being bumped with a car. The next minute he kills 20 more people. Totally unbelievable.

John Wick also keeps leaving alive all the people that are trying to kill him, just so that they can come back after him again to try to kill him again and kill his friends.

For some reason John Wick and all the bad guys pay for stuff in gold coins instead of normal money, even though they are in present day New York city. They tried to make the movie so cool, they made is stupid.

Don't take me wrong, I don't mind a mindless/pointless shoot-them-up flick one in a while, but this one was just too poorly done. I was bored watching it and was barely able to finish it.

6770739,5,B00OV3VGP0,I'm a sucker for a good action film.  If you like a lot of revenge and action movies this is a great one.  Keanu is excellent as always and the story line although a common theme was just done in a style that keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.  It was also sad.  Really liked the characters and the ending.  I watched in the theater twice and twice on Blu-ray and still not bored with it.,1434326400,,399,4.0
6770740,5,B00OV3VGP0,Good film,1434326400,,9,4.0
6770741,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Keanu Reeves has always been seen at a distance for me as a viewer.  While I've enjoyed films with him in them (Speed, The Matrix), and I admire that he's a film buff that insists on doing most of his own stunts and fight coreoography. but I couldn't say there was a film where I said ""This simply wouldn't work without Keanu Reeves...""

That all changed with John Wick.

John Wick is the directorial debut of prolific stuntman Chad Stahelski and is jam packed with engaging shootouts and fight sequences shot throughout a neon lit New York City.  If I were to describe it... try an imagine the action filled second half of 2011's Drive if that action half were an entire film.  That'd probably look something like John Wick.

Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as the titular assassin out for blood following the killing of his pet dog (a gift from his recently deceased wife).  As Wick, Reeves' limited emotional range and skill as a martial artists go together like peanut butter and chocolate.  While The Matrix I have always insisted I could easily imagine other action stars in the role of Neo, I cannot imagine anyone but Keanu Reeves pulling off John Wick.

The cast is rounded out by veterans such as Michael Nyqvist (the Swedish Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy), Alfie Allen (Game of Thrones), John Leguizamo, and the always entertaining Willem Dafoe, but John Wick really does hinge on the performance of Keanu Reeves.  Unlike The Matrix wherein Reeves was a sort of blank slate for the audience to project themselves onto (with and Laurence Fishburne  and Hugo Weaving stealing the show), John Wick truly does hinge on Reeves as an actor and he pulls it off magnificently.

If you were already a fan of Keanu Reeves, this film's already a no-brainer, but if you're someone like me who has always been on the fence about Reeves as a performer this is the Keanu Reeves movie to see.  This is a great action movie with a great lead character that any action fan should be happy to add to their collection.",1434326400,8,2014,4.623595505617978
6770742,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Loved this film. Full of action, intrigue, suspense and lots of people being shot, very violent but it works. Not a film for kids. Very pumped up action film that delivered the goods for me.",1434326400,,190,4.457142857142857

6770823,4,B00OV3VGP0,Kinda crazy movie!! Very interesting world that John Wick used to work in. I would recommend watching it. Would I watch it again? Only if I happen to catch it on while I was changing channels. Somewhat reminded me of Shoot'em up only with more of a plot.,1433721600,,254,4.3125

This movie was heart wrenching and devastating...  Then it turned it into a full fledged kick a$$ revenge flick.  The bad guys got exactly what was coming to them.

Not overdone, the film accomplishes what it sets out to do: keep you interested while watching a dude go all out with his guns.

For an original movie, when every other movie nowadays is a sequel, this is probably one of the best in a while.

Watched it with my boyfriend. He definitely enjoyed it, he's always been fond of Keanu.

Once in a while we'll pop this movie and let it play in the background while we're relaxing or eating or something. It's one of those movies that are exciting no matter which point you look at the screen, and there's nothing that you can lose track of, because the point is simple.

John Wick was crossed, and you wouldn't like him while he's very very angry.",1432944000,,645,4.394957983193278

6770971,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Some of the best gun-play sequences in an action movie for a long time. The other reviews for this are probably already doing a fairly good job of telling you how this movie is and I don't think I'd be able to say anything different.
I enjoyed this movie despite the cliche storyline and if they happen to make a sequel I'll totally be watching it even if I have to take my nephew and say, ""it's for him"".
If they do a sequel, I truly hope they do a story that involves the hit-man hotel featured in this film. In fact, I think it'd be awesome if they did maybe several interwoven short stories involving several residents with the villian being the connecting thread between them.
If you're looking for something to play in your mancave with some buds or maybe something you and your wife/girlfriend/partner can at least look at together while you eat a take-out dinner, give this one a shot. If you happen to be a retired hitman who had escaped the mob before being pulled back in by their thoughtless violence and was forced to go on a killing-spree and don't want to watch the same thing you've been forced to suffer through all day, then avoid this movie.",1432857600,,1160,4.425233644859813

Somewhere, somehow Keanu had an epiphany, perhaps, and realized that playing a part required real acting.  Or maybe the director of ""John Wick"" is on Reeves frequency and he was able to switch Keanu on.  Whatever the source of this change, it works well in this movie. This is a very fast paced action thriller.  No distractions, just a linear chronology of a man getting his just revenge. Every scene is well executed and very stylish.  It is so well done, the excitement never lets up and the result is amazing.  Recommended for all but the very squeamish.",1432598400,2,679,4.524590163934426

Shot with cameras ARRI ALEXA & presented with Dolby Atmos.
You will love the Dolby Atmos audio presented on this blu ray, is beyond great.
In general the movie presents the return of the greatest hitman to the mob underworld just to seek revenge. A little clich, I have to say it, but John Wick reinvents itself and will not dissapoint you.
The story is good, the acting is really good, the photography is great, the audio is mind blowing, the fight choreography is one of the best in american cinema since Matrix but I notice that has gun fu with brutality that makes the movie unique.
One of the best blu rays by Summit Entertainment.
One of the best modern action movies available in home video.

The film is dark and foreboding in many ways.  Many of the fast action scenes are almost dance-like.  Keanu Reeves hasn't much to say, but he's way better that way, and he delivers some of his lines with a bit of mischief and humor.

6771088,2,B00OV3VGP0,"After reading reviews culled from Rotten Tomatoes, Roger Ebert, and even here at Amazon I expected JOHN WICK to be a thrill ride with emotional undercurrents, but found its emotional underpinnings weak at best- and the movie a stylish and well made excursion into video game land.  There's a scene in the movie where bad guys are playing video games and Reeves' Wick is systematically wiping out a third of the criminal population in clean, nearly bloodless fashion.  Talk about irony.

Sure, the action is virtually non-stop and frenetic.  The movie sizzles and crackles with excitement and a sense of dark retribution between Wick and the baddies who killed the dog his dying wife emotionally willed to him.  But whatever good intentions are inherent in the screenplay, the non-stop, video game killing spree has a seemingly immortal and untouchable Wick killing nearly 100 people (I lost count).

The blood lust, coupled with Keanu Reeves' steely monotone and a sleazy and amateurish musical score, renders JOHN WICK devoid of any emotional punch whatsoever.  So while I liked the premise and revenge plot line, this unrealistic movie fell far short of being a must see.",1431907200,,1173,5.046632124352332

6771094,4,B00OV3VGP0,"**SPOILER ALERT**

To be honest, if Amazon did not have this on sale for $0.99 rental, I probably would not have rented. I am glad that I did. The short of it, John Wick is about a former assassin who goes after the men who killed his dog and stole his car. Just hearing or reading that might make you think this might be a ridiculous movie. That was my former opinion as well. It is much deeper than that.

The dog in question was the last gift sent to him by his wife that arrived after her death. So you are dealing with a much deeper emotional hurt that would push John Wick to go after the men who did this. So you have a former assassin grieving the loss of the wife for whom he left the ""business"" to be with. The last gift she gave him, so that he would have something to love, was killed in front of him, days after his wife's death. That might make a former killer for hire snap a little.

Of course, I would have loved to see more glimpses of his life with wife to see how she brought calm to him and caused him to leave his profession. However, this is an action movie so it did what it was supposed to do and focused on the action. The aspect of the film I found really compelling was the hotel for assassins, The Continental.

I kind of want to see a movie about that hotel and the people work in it and the owner. Charon, the hotel manager, played by Lance Reddick was very stoic and I wanted to know more about him. I am interested in the former life of Winston, the owner, played by Ian McShane.

All in all, this is a solid action movie. Oh and when you watch the movie, your eyes are not playing tricks on you, Daisy is a boy.",1431820800,,1645,4.018348623853211

""My name is John Wick.  You killed my dawg.  Prepare to die.""

Imagine my surprise when I found that the darn movie actually works and is Very Good (I'm rating it at 4 stars out of 5).  The problem was that the premise I had been reading wasn't actually complete.  Instead, it should read:

""My name is John Wick.  I'm not a good man.  But, for my wife, I was trying.  You killed my dawg.  The last gift from my wife and my last hope.  Prepare to die.""

We're not talking Shakespeare, here.  We're talking a Murder Death Kill type of movie.  And, it works.  I've got only one complaint with the whole thing:  [minor spoiler] at one point, the bad guys have John down.  Instead of ending it right there, the bad boss has him taken back to a lair so he can gloat and prepare the shark-mounted lasers (well, not really).  This is the same guy who practically soiled himself when he found out someone in his organization had done John wrong.  Yet, given the chance to get clear of it, he blows it [/minor spoiler].

By 15 minutes in, however, I was pretty much sold. I've always been a fan of Reeves, and I wondered, given his personal experiences in losing a loved one, how difficult this role must have been for him (or parts of it, at least). While by no means realistic, I appreciate that Wick took the time to reload during gunfights, and instances in fight choreography that involved reloading within the fights itself were pretty great.

I found the reference to Baba Yaga a bit humorous, growing up, my grandma always described Baba Yaga as an old woman, but hey, a Bogeyman is a Bogeyman. And let's talk about the fact that Willem Defoe and John Leguizamo are both in the movie.

6771219,2,B00OV3VGP0,"I like Keanu Reeves as an actor.  He displays a kind of intense emotion even as he plays near automatons.  However, this one was too much for me.  Reeves does OK but the plot was way, way thinner than Liam Neeson's Taken.  The shoot 'em up sequences were scripted as if in a video game.  His mysterious benefactor is never explained in any meaningful way.  While I like the idea that Wicks is the man who is sent to get the bogeyman, the reality is too silly.
Reeves is an actor who really needs good scripts or mind bending concepts.  The John Wick's script is just plain awful.

Spoiler Alert:  John Wick gets a puppy from his wife, something for him to cherish when she succumbs to a deadly disease.  The bad guys brutally kill the puppy.  If my wife had seen the movie, she would not have spoken to me for a week.  Be warned.",1431129600,,829,4.243589743589744

What I don't like is the Search for Private Ryan, Snowpearcer, 24, I'm gonna stab you with this knife slowly scene, and we're all going to enjoy it.  Hate that.  Killing people is not a good thing, in case people aren't aware.  Although, I must admit, the fact that John Wick wants people to stay dead after he's killed them is kinda refreshing.  No ""one shot"" for Mr. Wick--he will spend the time and the bullets.  Seems kinda professional, you know?
Now let's address the gorilla in the room...or maybe the much ado about not acting well that is Keanu ""Wind through the mountain"" Reeves.  Yes, Keanu is still the luckiest actor ever.  I remember watching the movie ""The 6th Day"" with Arnold Svartzy (I can't spell), and you'd have all these serious actors like Robert Duvall doing some serious acting, and you'd be concentrating on it, and then wham!, in comes Arnold and it was like someone let in a slow moving mumbling pig-latin robot on the scene, and all the drama and joy would drain out of the film.  I'm not saying it's exactly the same with Keanu, but it's exactly the same with Keanu.  He' cute, but he can't act.  Except as Neo.  He's a good Neo, cause Neo is basically Ted's excellent adventure in the matrix.  But who cares about my opinion--he's a millionaire, and I'm watching his movies.  Not speaking of which, that dude from Game of Thrones and that episode of Gay of Thrones needs to get a non-despicable bad guy role.",1431043200,,1548,4.514388489208633

This isn't a movie that will get an Oscar nod.  It is simply an action movie that while extremely violent you have to admire the purpose for his revenge.  Well, if you are a dog lover!  The sequence and fight scenes were good and well choreographed.  Keanu played the part very well, in my opinion.

The plot was simple, and the action was non-stop after about 10-15 minutes to set up the story.

If you are looking for a good shot'em up with an interesting revenge scenario, and little dialogue and there is nothing else interesting you then rent this.  You will not be disappointed.

Never again do I want to hear him accusing another film of not living up to his moral standards. Violence doesn't get more gratuitous than this. This was certainly entertaining and I'm glad if it helps ressurrect his film career, but whaddaya know, after vengefully killing hundreds of people John Wick's wife is still dead. Yes the fights are beautifully choreographed, but in this day and age do we still stand for the whole device of vilians tying up, rather than killing, our protagonist, and giving him ridiculous chances to escape? Also, as he does not seem to have advantages of speed or strength over his adversaries, one must conclude that it is literally his killer style that does the trick.  And I don't buy how helpless he is in the beginning vs how badass we're supposed to believe him to be--if he was such a highly dangerous assassin, wouldn't those responses still be in his muscle memory? Interesting that he started out with a beagle and ended up with a pit bull. Maybe that's the real moral of the story--every retired assassin needs a pit bull.",1430784000,3,1177,4.658653846153846

In closing still an amazing movie great fight scenes, car chase scenes, and Reeves still shows his talent is not all dry up as of yet.

Then they show the puppy dead.  I can't.  We finished the movie but I never got over the first 30 minutes.

It's funny reading some of the negative reviews on this film for sure. I'm not sure what people expected here. The dialogue is laser tight for the most part, the characters are interesting, and the circumstances are fully engaging. I appreciate all the work that went into setting up the backstory and environment here, which is very subtle but well-planned and intriguing.

This isn't a period drama folks. Nor is it Blade Runner. As long as you have a brain going into this you can sort out the rest and realize what the intentions of the film are rather than hope it to be something it never set out to do. Great choregraphy and acting all around for what amounts to a very terse picture based on simple values with a load of pretty violence to follow in wake of its vengeance. Give it a try.

6771382,1,B00OV3VGP0,"Short Attention Span Summary:

1. A man with no visible means of income drives a fancy car and lives in a fancy house with his cute puppy.
2. His wife has recently died From Causes Unknown
3. Someone wants to buy the car and he turns him down. That someone happens to be the son of a Russian mobster
4. Said Mobster's son finds the house........somehow.......and steals the car, beats the man, and kills the dog
5. The Man (John Wick) goes on a very long revenge killing spree, while staying in a hotel of assassins.

This is, bar none, the silliest movie that I've ever seen. Lots of questions:

1. How did the mobster's son know where he lived?
2. Has anyone ever heard of hotel that houses only assassins?
3. Has anyone ever heard of a bar that accepted gold coins as payments?
4. Has anyone ever heard of anyone who accepts gold coins for payments in the way that they would $50 bills?
5. Who could write such corny dialogue? (""By thine own hand, your membership is terminated."")

I only happened to find this movie because I was taking a long plane ride (Korean Airlines) and it was free-- and it was my only choice.

The whole movie consists of dark shots and almost all the characters are wearing black. Keanu Reeves manages to look very silly in this film.

Verdict: Not recommended. A waste of time. If you want to see a movie with a good, believable assassin (or, for that matter, a good believable plot), I recommend Tom Cruise's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Collateral-Blu-ray/dp/B00AEFXORM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Collateral [Blu-ray</a>] or Natalie Portman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Professional-1994/dp/B00170F0WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Professional (1994)</a>",1430438400,3,1787,5.456521739130435

6771433,4,B00OV3VGP0,"From out of nowhere, the name John Wick appeared on my movie radar. Keanu Reeves in a slick action-packed revenge movie? Count me in! The trailer promised well shot action, cool moves and R rated violence, and Im here to confirm, John Wick delivers on all counts.

The plot is simple enough. A young, stupid son of an important Russian mobster, Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), takes a liking to John Wicks beautiful 69 Mustang. When John declines Iosefs offer to buy the car, the young fool decides to just steal it, and kill the last remaining semblance of hope John had in the world after the death of his beloved wife. The fuse, wick, get it? Is lit! And John, as he exhumes his arsenal, so resurrects his past life as an unstoppable killing machine.

Action in Hollywood movies of late, has been pretty disappointing in my opinion. All too often each sequence gets shot too closely with hand-held cameras, and is then edited to become incomprehensible. John Wick benefits from having two former stunt men as directors and a lead star, who all seem to understand how good action movies work. They understand the audience want to watch the action, not be part of it. In that respect, an inventive well choreographed action scene is not unlike a great dance performance. A series of well-timed steps and movements to a good beat. Get that right, and all thats left to do is pull the camera back, tell your editor to chill out, and let your skilled performers do their work.

John Wick applies this methodology perfectly, and its loaded with great action, cool visuals and a really killer soundtrack. It also sets up a fun world for these killers to exist in. One with a code of conduct, hallowed ground, and even its own currency. Keanu Reeves as an actor is a mixed bag of tricks, but when paired with the right content, hes brilliant, and certainly seems to have found his stride in this awesome tale of revenge. (www.

6771454,4,B00OV3VGP0,"John Wick marks a return to form for Keanu Reeves, who has been in a bit of a slump movie-wise since his glory days of the Matrix trilogy (although the last two parts of that trilogy were nothing to write home about).

As plots go, the movie is nothing original; a retired hitman  the eponymous Mr Wick  is dragged back into his old world against his will but its all about execution and style. In this case, when we meet Wick (after a brief unnecessary flashforward) hes mourning the death of his wife. Her final gift to him is a puppy so he can still love something and hold onto his humanity, but after a chance meeting with an upstart young Russian (Game of Thrones Alfie Allen) and a couple of cronies, that last link is lost to him, and Wick is out for revenge.

Things are complicated by the fact that the Allens character is the son of Wicks former employer, who knows all too well what hes capable of and that he won't stop until his son is dead. After that, theres a bounty on Wicks head as he marches through piles of bodies on his way to revenge.

There are some nice tweaks to the formula, including a safe-house for assassins in a hotel run by the enigmatic Lance Reddick, but the real fun is in seeing Reeves plow through hordes of enemies using an impressive array of fighting skills and weaponry. And yes, Keanu Reeves still knows kung fu.

Reeves is surrounded by a great supporting cast, even if some of them only show up for what amounts to a brief cameo  John Leguizamo, Willem Dafoe, Adrianne Palicki and Ian McShane are all game. Palicki especially seems to relish the role of a rival assassin who takes up the contract on Wick.

If you're looking for a good straight-forward action movie, you could do a lot worse  John Wick is a bloody, enjoyable movie.",1430265600,3,1778,4.396341463414634

What I was not expecting was the amount of plot behind what goes on in this film. Now it is rather linear as most action movies are, but makes up for it in underlying plot. Finally I will state that there is going to be a moment in this movie that will pull hard at your heart strings and that moment in the movie is what made me choose a 5 star review over a 4.",1430265600,,540,3.873873873873874

From the first moment Keanu Reeves shoots someone in the face, every fight is well choreographed and fairly intense.  Being that the story wasn't anything to write home about, I think the movie could have ended earlier.  The last half hour doesn't feel necessary at all.  Still a great watch for any action aficionado.",1429747200,,584,4.676470588235294

6771594,3,B00OV3VGP0,"Well, what can I say? I like Keanu & all that, but he needs to find a more imaginative script. I mean this guy was a superman combination of Shaft, Mannix, Charles Bronson & Dirty Harry from start to bloody finish. Except his wife's illness & death broke his heart. And his dog gets snuffed. Really??? I mean did we have to murder a dog??? So every sympathetic tug on our hearts was made at the beginning to justify the storm of upcoming judgement that gets unleashed. What a cliche. Maybe seeing bad guys get their due reward is a psychological uplifting experience or something. But gratuitous violence was in scene after scene. Even the chicks were bad. What a waste. And the bad guys knew it was coming. Mix Equalizer & Taken 1-2-3 together & you get this. But he did drive a pretty hot car, & lived in a cool crib. He could only squeal tires for good measure in the various muscle cars he drove. Liked the muscle cars, but they were just eye candy for middle aged guys like me. Script writer needs to hone his characters more like ""Justified"" on FX that was from author Elmore Leonard's mix - John Wick was just too ""bad-ass"" to be believable. So there, I said it. Didn't resonate with me like the Matrix stuff did. Better luck next time Keanu. Probably made enough off this one for this month's payment on the Porsche, though.",1429574400,2,1332,4.41869918699187

That's the entire plot, with all of its subtleties. There was no tension, no surprises, nothing for anyone with more than the mind of a dumb 13-year-old to hook the viewer. Had bad was it? I was bored, and it had great reviews, so that's why I watched it and paid for the right to do so. I PAID for this. It was so bad that I watched everything but the last ten minutes.

Superb, taut direction by the guy who did the storyboards for The Matrix movies, great acting by all concerned (Willem Dafoe? Michael Nyquist? Lance Reddick, late of the Fringe franchies?. The real star here is the bare bones backstory -- 'justified' revenge -- how it propels a juggernaut of well-choreographed action. The only thing I felt, watching this, was a bit of heartbreak. Watching Keanu play a man who's wife has died (that is NOT a spoiler, by the way) is achingly close to real life. But, the best news of all, Keanu is back!

The storyline started to lead me more into the character's life, even to the point of tears a couple of times, but it still left me feeling slightly short at other times of the emotional connection I wanted, especially at the very beginning. There is good main character development, and the other cast members work well into the main storyline and are very good. Keanu Reeves can do a lot of action packed films like John Wick but he can also deliver more emotion. At times, I believe it was necessary for his character to not be more emotional but at other times, I thought there could have been more emotion to bring the audience out of the action and more into John Wick's life. Overall, I like this movie and I am glad I saw it, even though some parts a bit tough to watch.

6771672,1,B00OV3VGP0,Holy s*** gravy. How did that happen? How did hundreds of film industry professionals come together and decide it was ok to make that? Not smart. Not fun. Not suspenseful. Not well acted. This ranks right up there with Steven Soderbergh's Haywire as one of the biggest rottentomatoes.com dupes of my life. Got 1/3 of the way through and couldn't deal with the humiliating feeling that I brought this movie upon myself. No one clicked the rent button but me. Gah.

The mafia boss knows, as soon as he hears about it that his family is in grave danger.  John Wick has a BIG reputation.  The movies centers around John Wick getting revenge.  Very action packed with John winning the battle over un-surmountable odds.  He has a little help along the way. but pretty much on his own, he wins.  He is gravely injured in the process.

All I have to say that from opening to close of this film is, ""KEANU IS BACK!"" -- and it's about time. I have always admired Keanu is an actor and this role was completely built for him. It's not just a 'shoot the bad guys' flick; Keanu allows us to appreciate his knowledge of martial arts in several fight sequences.

I am all about knowing a backstory on a character and this film delivered that in a provocative and gripping manner. The simple words uttered of, ""He is the one you send to KILL the Boogeyman"" was enough to hook me right in. The joy of seeing Willem DaFoe and a modest, yet strong performance from John Leguizamo only added to the fantastic story telling laid out for us.

Keanu fans -- Do not hesitate on this flick. You will NOT be disappointed.

The choreography is amazing, and simply unmatched in modern action flicks which usually do CGI pasted over by lens flares.

The Gun-FU didn't take me back so far as the 70's Chinese action flicks, but it did remind me greatly of Gun Kata from 'Equilibrium', which is rather ironic if you know about that movie's past and how its profits were affected by the release of another Keanu film, 'The Matrix'

And the violence is somewhat unique in that it involves some aikido/jiujitsu/judo type moves with lots of gun play and a bit of grappling thrown in.  It all happens so quickly.  This is a movie that belongs to the revenge action genre, but is also heavily influenced by first person shooter games.  There are some stupid parts - some stupid decisions on the part of the criminal kingpin, but whatever, it's just an action film.  Many people make fun of Keanu Reeves' acting, but he really excels in this type of role:  few lines, lots of action, and moody cinematography.

Could he been avenging his wife, at least, not a dog? Which he knew for a day? Could his wife been killed by mob for some secret dealings or something?
Where those innumerable human lives spent in avenging the hurt feelings because of the killed dog, a bit too much?

C'mon, get a better formula if you want plenty of blood and gore and money. Just motivate the hero better, don't make it that sappy. You should know better than that how to use the formula, do not attempt on psychology with this cheap doggie trick. Classy shooting scenes do not make for a good move, not even for a commercially successful one.

Go to school.

They enter his house at night, kill his dog and steal his car. So John Wick gets angry and start killing people until he has destroyed the whole mafia.

Pros - Cutest dog ever,
Cons - Horrible acting, horrible action sequence. The bad ass John Wick first of all is not bad ass at all. Secondly he lets a girl live who is his worst enemy just for no freaking reason.

6772164,4,B00OV3VGP0,"""John Wick"" is a non-stop shoot-em-up in the style of ""The Killer"" (1989) with perhaps some spaghetti Western mixed in. John Wick (Keanu Reeves) was a fearsome assassin for the New York underworld before he retired to marry his love Helen (Bridget Moynahan). But his domestic calm was short-lived. Helen dies just five years later. Her parting gift is a Beagle puppy named ""Daisy"", intended to provide her husband some company and love after she passes away. Grieving over his wife's death, John copes by caring for the puppy and burning the rubber in his treasured vintage Mustang. Refueling at a gas station one day, a cocky Russian-speaking young man offers to buy the car, which John refuses. So the young man, Iosef (Alfie Allen), and two accomplices break into John's home to steal the car, igniting a bloody war between the inconsolable John and Iosef's mob boss father Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), who was John's former employer.

There is not a lot of plot. John will stop at nothing to take Josef's life in retribution, killing anyone who stands in his way. Viggo is compelled to protect his son, though the cost to him will be greater than the prize, if he succeeds. It seems we're back to having Russians as villains, after a couple of decades of Arabs. Michael Nyqvist deserves a lot of credit for Viggo's quiet panache. He's an interesting antagonist, not exactly a villain. Keanu Reeves does very well with laconic characters who express themselves physically, and he's still a convincing action star at age 50. ""John Wick""s appeal relies heavily on its visual style: well-edited fight sequences, distinctive production design, and wardrobe. When John sets out to kill half of New York's underworld, he wears a suit. A well-cut black suit with slim legs, black vest, and black shirt and tie. Viggo wears a red shirt and dark suit. Everyone in the film, except perhaps Iosef, cares about presentation.

Another device intended to enhance audience appeal is the film's creation of an assassin subculture, complete with its own inviolable rules, etiquette, and luxury hotel -The Continental in New York City, which caters specifically to the needs of those in the people-elimination business, provided that they don't eliminate anyone on the premises. The hotel's dapper concierge (Lance Reddick) dispenses surgeons, clean-up crews, and more traditional services, as needed. These people are pathologically violent but undeniably stylish, and that helps when the action consists primarily of shooting and hand-to-hand combat. Even the subtitles for the Russian conversation are stylish. Michael Nyqvist's instinct for when to sound imposing, ironic, or mocking helps too. Viggo talks much more than John, so responsibility for the film's wit falls to him, while John is the film's heart, and director Chad Stahelski, DP Jonathan Sela, and editor Elisabet Ronalds provide its kinetic energy.",1428710400,,2906,5.154661016949152

6772167,1,B00OV3VGP0,"I discuss the movie here, so spoilers.
Others have mentioned the pathetic plot.  I like Keanu.  He's great with the action in this movie.  But, it really is a violent video game with a pathetic plot made into a movie.  It's absolutely absurd how many people with guns aimed at him at close range that he kills without them being able to get one good shot at him to really wound or kill him.  Maybe 75-100?  The beatings he takes with metal pipes/bat, thrown over a balcony to land 1-2 stories flat on his back on a hard floor, kicks, punches, etc... then he shows some injuries but pretty much right back to fighting without much if any limitations from injuries.  He's supposedly a human being in this movie not Neo.  Just in the beginning of the movie late at night he gets heavily beaten with a metal pipe/bat, punched, kicked, etc..., but then the next morning he's up walking around with a little blood but doing all kinds of things like swinging a big sledge hammer to break a concrete floor and even fighting and killing 12 trained hit men that night without any kind of limitation.  Later, (next day?) he's in a gunfight going thru a big, dark nightclub with maybe 30-40 security people most all of whom have guns.  He single handedly fights, shoots, and kills a bunch while also getting into various hand to hand fights with one lasting 30 seconds to a minute during which all of the remaining security people with guns miraculously disappear until he finishes the fight.  Just plain stupid.  He also is standing right next to a car that gets rammed at high speed from an suv on the other side so he gets very violently knocked by the car maybe 20 feet in the air and lands on the pavement.  It's an impact that would kill any human being.  They tie him up, but maybe an hour thereafter he's back to fighting without any limitation.  Huh?  There's also an old friend longtime hit man who agrees to a contract with the Russian boss to kill Keanu, but ends up secretly betraying the Russians and helping Keanu.  After things seem to be finished,  he and Keanu meet in public in a friendly way while knowing the boss is still alive and would likely be watching them.  Of course, the Russian boss's person finds them together which tips off the boss that he helped Keanu so the boss kills him leading to a final showdown with the boss and Keanu.  Totally stupid that the top two and most highly experienced assassins would meet like that in public knowing they would very likely still be watched.  Keanu also goes walking around the streets killing people with a machine gun, plus many other guns fired at him, but the cops don't exist in what appears to be something like NY city.  In the final showdown between Keanu and the Russian boss outside at a shipyard, Keanu kills the bodyguards then you see him and the boss across the docks from each other.  In the very next scene showing the two face to face for the final fight, it miraculously starts pouring down raining but it wasn't before.  Remember the final fight in pouring rain between Smith and Neo?  Then right when the boss and Keanu end their fight the rain stops, just like the Matrix.  C'mon.  I like action movies, but they need to have some kind of decent plot and some level of believability.  I guess if you want a ridiculous revenge action video game/film essentially devoid of reality, then it's for you.  Otherwise, I hope my review saves you from wasting your time.",1428624000,4,3442,4.497584541062802

6772214,5,B00OV3VGP0,"The plot for this movie is a little mediocre, but honestly, I felt as it was just the vessel to deliver this action flick that is HEAVILY focused on details. Anyone who has a love for tactical training or combatives/martial arts will love this movie. Even though a movie about a single guy who just rips through dozens of bad guys is intrinsically unrealistic, this one puts its faith in the details. Everything from combat reloads and carbine-to-pistol transitions to grappling and close quarters combat, this movie just about hits all of it on the head. Keanu is shown racking his slides, cycling pump actions, slamming bolts forward. Man, as a guy with some firearms training, it was like manna from heaven to see somebody operate all these different weapons appropriately and realistically. Magazines didn't have a thousand rounds, pistols didn't make all kinds of crazy sounds every time they were lifted or pointed, etc. For the average viewer, maybe these will go unnoticed, but anyone who's spent time at the range or been in the thick of it will appreciate the care and obvious training that went into this movie.

6772217,3,B00OV3VGP0,"Ten things about John Wick:
1. It's a great action movie full of inconsistencies and bad editing but still very enjoyable.
2. It's the first movie ever made about a man who goes on a killing rampage over a puppy that he only had for two days and didn't seem to like that much.
3. Keanu Reeves hardly speaks, which is a big positive, because as they say in the movie ""people never change,"" and Keanu Reeves will never be a good actor.
4. It's the first film to completely underutilize the talent of Willem Dafoe.
5. Everyone except Keanu Reeve's and Willem Dafoe's character is a horrible shot.
6. If you're Russian, you need to wear red shirts with black suits so Keanu can identify you properly.
7. There is always an abandoned veterinary clinic (or doctor) nearby when, and if, the main character should become injured. Nothing is locked up so have at it.
8. Some assassins are great, and some are just lazy, just like normal people. The black guy who gets it in the hotel should have known not to walk up to the ""apparently"" tied up female assassin to speak directly into her face. You're just asking for trouble dude.
9. You can have prolonged automatic weapon fights in New York without the police ever showing up and ruining all the fun.
10. There will probably be a sequel, and we'll both probably watch it.",1428537600,4,1314,4.479166666666667

Action films are frequently, plain silly. This one works as a good movie experience, but I can't point out the ""why"" of it. Excellent audio for home theater folks.

However he did a final 'impossible' task for them to get out and marry a woman he had fallen in love with. Needless to say that this doesn't last for long when his old boss's son makes the mistake of attacking him for his car and killing his dog (a present his wife had arranged for him to receive after she passed away from cancer). Big mistake! John is back in the game and eliminating everyone in his old mob. Lots of action, lots of blood and a great storyline. He is known as the person you send for to kill the Boogey man. Best film he's done since the MATRIX series. Willem Defoe also stars as an assassin guardian angel for John and pays for it in the end.",1428364800,,1031,4.26530612244898

6772310,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I saw this movie in the theaters when it first came out. Luckily, Amazon had for rent or sale for a reasonable price so I went ahead and bought the movie.

First of all, I'm a sucker for a beagle puppy and when the puppy got killed by the bad guys, I was hooked! I wanted revenge exacted on those guys and who's better to do it than John Wick. If you like revenge movies, this is the one to see. It reminds me of the Samurai movies that I used to watch on Hawaiian TV back in the day. It's pure fantasy but it sure makes you feel good when he gets the bad guys.

Don't want to comment on the acting because there is no need to critic an action movie. It's a pure adrenaline rush, lots of shooting, lots of bones breaking, and of course, lots of blood, lots of it. Keanu Reeves is a movie star - an action movie star. That's what he does best. t's worth watching him kill all the bad guys in this movie because he is avenging the loss of his beagle puppy. That's the hook. Was it worth buying the movie for $10.

I think that Bruce Willis in RED, and Keanu Reeves in this movie, both pulled in lower ratings than they deserved.

I didn't buy the Blu-ray, not yet, but I may in a few months when I can get it cheaper through Amazon or some other reseller - meanwhile, watching it twice in a few weeks' time is enough for now.

Enough to ask one question: for a man who once killed 3 men with only a f**king pencil, what takes him to long to realize he has a backup pistol in his belt behind his back while he and the Russian punk kid's older brother are hashing it out in the club?  Did the fifteen foot drop off the balcony pound some sense into him?

I found it fun, intense, really wished the directors had gone into a little more detail about his background, done a little more character development (like what's that private little hit-man's club all about anyway? Is this what Martin Blank's nemesis played by Dan Ackroyd - Grosse Pointe Blank - had in mind in a parallel comic-book minded universe?),they could have given us more of a glimpse into the characters played by John Leguizamo, for example.  There's DEPTH there, briefly flashed upon when he grabs the gun being held to his head and says go ahead and shoot without a scintilla of fear.  Who IS this guy and who owns him that he's that fearless in the face of imminent death?  And he hits Viggo's kid and answers to Viggo in a tone like he simply said ""hey you, get off my lawn"" when Viggo could end him in very unpleasant ways, but doesn't.

There are layers upon layers of background, of RESPECT, of rules, a finely crafted code of honor among thieves (killers, dealers, power brokers) one wishes existed in our very own US Congress.  Everything looks very finely polished from the outside and the chaos within is managed by contracts, permissions, RULES, honorable men.  VERY unlike our US Congress (chaos on the outside, God knows what behind closed doors - or maybe it's the same thing and I'm reaching here for allegory that doesn't exist).

The choreography in the home invasion scenes were amazing.  Very detailed but could have been a little better.  I thought they were too choreographed where real CQB (and HTH) fighting is uglier, MUCH FASTER and chaotic (having been in more than a handful of bar fights and brawls in my somewhat misspent youth and surviving one home invasion) but (kudos to the director here) not entirely one-sided as John really has to struggle in a few places, but hey, wait a second... night vision gear (especially the cheap Russian stuff) is available just about everywhere and cutting the power before a hit like this isn't just for NAVDEVGRU or other SPECOPS forces anymore.  Just how stupid ARE the Russian ""mafia"" contract killers anyway?  Don't they know their target is (DUN-Dun-dun...)  JOHN WICK?  And he JUST might have a pencil or two lying around?

Every time I make ""dinner reservations"" in the future I'm going to laugh, at least inwardly.

My favorite scene so far?  The guy who played the brother in ""Rescue Me"" the one from the ""Mayhem"" insurance commercials, playing Viggo's ""consigliere"" getting capped.  If only more lawyers could wind up like that...

It's a rare action film I find wishing it had been longer, but I could have watched another 30 minutes of John Wick, easily.

I'm really looking forward to a sequel (prequel?).  Lot of undiscovered territory there. How DID he kill 3 guys with one pencil?",1428019200,37,3386,4.605

I like him, but his latest movies (47 Ronin, and John Wick) have moved him to the 'love' category.  It's like he's coming into his own as he gets older or something.  And this movie, wow.  We were literally screaming at the video at different points.  The plot, the story, the attitude, the acting were all on point.  And don't even get me started on some of the action scenes!

The back-story is not too whiny and the puppy is a perfect metaphor for his role as John Wicks' Last Chance. John Leguizamo is perfect - ""Hey' get out out here, don't involve me in this"". The kid is the right kind of self-centered silver-spooner. The Russian and the Brit, the Girl and the Front Desk Manager are not as convincing as needed, and given their key roles, roll this to 3.

I read online the body count for John Wick in the movie is 76 for Wick and 8 + 1 dog for the bad guys.

John Wick doesn't try to be more than it is ... it's violent, full of brutality and somewhat predictable. Badguys kill cute puppy dog, .... good guy seeks revenge and kills bad guys. Wick reminded me of the Quentin Tarantino Kill Bill movies, if you didn't know differently, you might think Tarantino directed this one too, but he didn't Chad Stahelski and David Leitch are the directors of Wick.

This movie was a roller coaster ride if there ever was one and Reeves who waited so long before he came back fast and hard made the right decision. Fight scenes galore, fast moving cars, action in every type of scenario you can think of and great performances and dialogue that can't be beat.

6772574,5,B00OV3VGP0,"This is a fantastic action movie. I loved Keanu Reeves in it. There are a lot of guns and shooting. It's very fast moving and the color of the film fit perfect with the story line. Yea, the puppy broke my heart, very sad. It also broke John's Wick's heart and set him on this exciting road to revenge. John Wick is great because while he might get beat up, shot and otherwise totally knocked down, he continues to get back up and takes care of things. There seems to be no stopping John Wick. He's like a machine with a purpose and he keeps going until he's accomplished what he's set out to do.

The 'rules' of this particular crime group was really interesting to me. I would really love to see another John Wick movie and please, with Keanu Reeves in it. Oh, and William Dafoe, too. My hope is that they make a prequel to this movie so we can see how these two characters met and worked together in the past.

The plot, what there is of it is completely inane.  One would guess the number of people killed by the subject is well over one hundred, give or take a few dozen.  Take your eyes off the screen for 10 seconds and you'll miss another bunch either blown to bits or with their necks used to sharpen their knives..  If you're twelve years old you might go for this (although who would allow any twelve year old to see this dribble is beyond me.)

The funny thing about Keanu Reeves is that I can't see him as a bad guy no matter how violent the character he plays.  He can dispatch a room full of people while still looking like the boy next door. My guess is that this is more true-to-life than we want to believe.,1427414400,,437,4.253012048192771

More importantly though I would like to address the 1 star ratings that specifically had to do w/ the lack of plot. This movie is in effect a cautionary tale, don't mess w/ me I won't come kill your entire crime syndicate, basically a classic. I found there was a lot of deeper meaning hidden in between the shots being fired. To those other reviewers stating this is marketed to a demographic with a lower I.Q. I just laugh at you and the high horse you reviewed from. Honestly out of the garbage actions movies (any of the expendables sequels come to mind as an example) this one seems to have the most plausibility. It was pleasantly surprising to see characters need to reload as well as pick up the better firearms available and use them.

6772694,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Best known from Game of Thrones' Alfie Allen. plays Losef Tarasov, a similar wussy thug who like Theon Greyjoy hides behind the protection of who his father is and family name, to bully, steal from, beat up and intimidate anyone he comes across. One day he sees a car he likes at a petrol station pump, and demands the owner sell it to him, the guy tells him it's not for sale and drives off. He of course decides to violently jump (with a heap of henchmen of course) the owner, smash his dog to death with a baseball bat and steal the car. Unfortunately for him he chose the wrong victim, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is the guy his organised crime boss father would hire to kill anyone, no matter how well protected they were or how big their entourage with them at the time. John Wick had retired from that world, that dog was a recent gift from his late wife, Losef has just brought him back!

This is a fun fast paced movie with plenty of violence. Sure some is bit far fetched and ammunition seems pretty unlimited when needed, bad guys give up an easy kill to gloat and torment tough guy and the standard sort of thing but that's part of the fun for this genre. It has a pretty cool time out/off limits hotel as a sort of separate character which is quite well done. David Morrell and a few others have used this concept before in their novels but I haven't seen it done so well in a movie before.

My only real criticism of the film would have been the car stealing dog killing scene, it just didn't seem consistent with the John Wick character in that you'd think he would have been more aware with what a dog barking could mean than he is, especially with the numerous enemies you'd assume he made in his previous life. Perhaps he could have just looked out his window and seen Losef breaking into his car and then deliberately running over the dog as he drove off or something. But that's nothing major to lessen the enjoyment of the film.",1427155200,,1946,4.314207650273224

6772739,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Take Matt Damon in the Bourne trilogy, Liam Neeson in the Taken trilogy, and Denzel Washington in the Equalizer, put them all together and that's about 1/5 of how awesome Keanu Reeves is in this movie. John Wick takes badassery and puts it into a complete separate category of its own. What I really enjoyed about this movie is the fact that it is believable. I can watch Reeves calmly take on a small army with precision, two in the chest one in the head, and take down people left and right in a manner that I find way more believable and accurate than many other movies. Good movie, worth every cent.",1427068800,,603,4.392857142857143

John Wick had neither.  And after it was all said and done, I almost think they made this as a comedy!  I won't spoil the reason Wick goes off on a shooting spree, but was there not ONE guy with a gun that could hit a moving target i.e. Wick?!  I mean how many perfect shots did John have on everyone of his foes?!  And his dialogue?  Can you say ""seen/heard it too many times in other films by other actors""?

6772844,4,B00OV3VGP0,"For me, much of how I feel about a movie has to do with expectation. When I go to see a comedy, I expect to laugh till I cry. When I go to see a drama, I expect great acting and a solid screenplay.

And when I go to see a revenge action/thriller, I expect to see an enormous body count, with lots of gunfights, fistfights, destruction, and mayhem. And on that front, my friends, let me assure you--John Wick delivers in full. If you're looking for original dialogue or an airtight plot, move along.

The Plot:
It's very simple. And I must say that I give it a lot of credit for its simplicity. There's no grand scheme or plot twists here. It's not original in this regard and it doesn't try to be. It's just a good ol' fashioned ""you did the wrong thing to the wrong guy at the wrong time and now you're gonna pay"" revenge movie. I'll admit when I heard the premise I rolled my eyes a little. They steal his car and kill his dog? That's the WHOLE premise for a 2+ hour movie? And that premise only accounts for about 15 minutes of screen time. But I must admit that when you see it happen--especially the brutality with which they treat his puppy (his wife's final gift to him)--your heart goes out to him, and you think to yourself, ""Yeah, if I had the kind of resources and skill that he has, I'd be going to war too."" So, to the naysayers, you're right. There's not much of a plot here. But, my rebuttal is, it's enough.

The Action:
There is plenty of it. As I alluded to above, the setup only takes about 15-20 minutes and there's not much pause after that, so this movie probably clocks in around an hour and 45 minutes of action. It's RELENTLESS, and for me that's what made it so good. If you're going to make a simple revenge movie with a simple plot, you shouldn't allow the audience to have much pause to consider how ludicrous it all is; a downfall that many action movies fall prey to in my opinion. John Wick doesn't. It is also here that there is some originality to be found. The style, described in the special features as ""gun fu""--a sort of mixed martial arts, judo, and close-combat use of firearms combination, is just downright fun. I don't care if it's realistic. It's a movie. Just enjoy it for what it is. That said, I would like to point out that this movie still wins several realism points in my book for doing something that I can't even recall seeing in other movies of this genre in recent history: Showing reloads during action scenes and NOT having vehicles explode on impact. Very refreshing (not to mention fun, seeing Keanu use his firearms as blunt force weapons while reloading when his target is right in front of him).

In conclusion, I come back to my observation about expectations. I'm not a huge Keanu Reeves fan. I find him kind of flat. So I can't say I came into this movie expecting anything groundbreaking. However I was pleasantly surprised to find that several of the action scenes were refreshingly original, awesomely brutal, and in some cases downright funny in terms of how much better Wick is at his craft than the people he's up against. If you liked Taken, Homefront, or Death Sentence, I feel confident in guaranteeing that you will find this movie quite enjoyable. It's wicked good fun (sorry, couldn't resist).",1426723200,,3271,4.419568822553897

6772879,2,B00OV3VGP0,"this is a war film and in a world of endless wars don't enjoy seeing war entertainmentfied, though Hollywood loves doing that. acting was good, Mr. Reeves looks fit and handsome and so many actors I really like are here, but the story sucked cause it's essentially endless violence after John's puppy, a gift from his recently deceased beloved wife, is brutally murdered. besides the warring, bad writing. the writer sets the story up with a criminal wanting somebody else's car and taking it, essentially picking the wrong victim, but he was so unbelievably over the top in killing the man's puppy that the setup is not believable. killing the dog might have worked if it was a scary watch dog, but a puppy - too heavy handed and basically unbelievable, unless you want to establish the criminal as a psychopath, but the movie establishes him as the spoiled, indulged son of a underworld boss, not an insane, out of control murderer, so too much of a mismatch. also really did not like the almost constant music, especially in the violent scenes or even with John Wick walking, and there was too much slow-mo. also didn't care for the portrayal of women, can't even make it acceptable by saying that criminals would have prostitutes and easy women around them, easy out, no sale. I'll watch whatever Keanu Reeves is in at least once and I'm ready to see his next project cause I usually like his choices, but this is not one of my favorites. I can see he'd be attracted to the grieving assassin aspect of it but what actually makes it onto the screen is monotonous violence. if you like shoot'em ups and unbelievable plot twists where the hero should've been killed (his enemies had him unconscious and let him regain consciousness to chat with him) then you may like it. 1 and 3/4 stars rounded up to 2, for the acting, costumes (the male characters looked great in their tailored suits), and a competent focus puller",1426636800,,1919,4.663716814159292

6773002,4,B00OV3VGP0,"One could write a country song set to John Wick's life. You know this if you'd seen the trailer. His wife had died. They stole his car. They beat him up. They trashed his place. They killed his puppy. More than anything, it's that final act of brutality that pissed off the man, that dog being the most tangible memory left of his late wife. It launches John Wick down a path of unholy reckoning. It's great to see Keanu Reeves nab a role so well suited to his skills set. It's his best film since The Matrix. Keanu infuses into Wick the same attributes with which he endowed Speed's Jack Traven: the patented ""man of action and few words"" persona and a singleminded dedication to the task at hand. There's a boiling, implacable air about John Wick when he gets going, when he cracks the cement floor of his basement to access the weapons he'd put away - he thought, for good - those years ago. Goosebumps skittered up my arms during a defining scene in which the Russian mob boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) - moments ago so secure in his spot in the food chain - is informed just whom it was his punk kid had been messing with - and then Tarasov's ""Oh, f--- me!"" reaction. And since that weasely punk kid is played by Theon Greyjoy, I admit to chortling like a true jerk.

John Wick is a badass throwback to 1980s action cinema, back when the hero stalked the screen like a boss, doled out R-rated asskickings, and cracked a cheesy one-liner. The action here is unrelenting and it's crucial that we see keanu actually performing his own stunts, and bear in mind that this cat is 50 years old. John Wick's directors were stuntmen on The Matrix so they knew a little something about staging a dynamite action sequence and delivering that brand of kinetic mayhem. I don't know if Wick's ""gun-fu"" style is as revolutionary as some folks have been lauding it. John Woo has probably done ill stuff like this before. But, for sure, there is wicked panache in how Keanu applies judo and jujitsu and wields his firearms, manipulating them as if they were natural extensions of his body.

The movie dabbles in fascinating world creation. I crave a spin-off that centers on the Continental, that hotel for assassins. The film doesn't much explore Wick's past, but we pick up enough to get us stoked. We learn that Wick once was this legendary hitman, a bogeyman they'd nicknamed ""Baba Yaga."" Keanu, with unflagging commitment and utter conviction, sells the hell out of this role. He gets us to cheer him on as he systematically takes apart Tarasov's underworld empire. There's not a pretentious bone in this movie. It celebrates its grindhouse roots and wallows in its excesses. The cast is all in, from that rat Alfie Allen to the concerned yet defiant Michael Nyqvist to the enigmatic Willem Dafoe to the lethal Adrianne Palicki (you can see why they cast her as Mockingbird in AoS). All credit to John Leguizamo whose first cameo immediately establishes John Wick's credentials as a badass m0fo. You should see John Wick, and don't fret when you hear, going in, that Wick's revenge spree is motivated by a dog. The movie makes it work, does it ever. I mustn't leave out the dark humor. There's some comic stuff that goes on, sometimes subtle, sometimes in your face. So, if you aren't offended by classic Mustangs, compromised morality, bad behavior, adorable puppies, Russian goons getting pwned, implausible gun-fu combat, and a hitman who comes out of retirement to live up to his own urban legend, well, John Wick awaits, madre-effers! Fortune favors the bold!

I'm about to write a spoiler, but... take that with a grain of salt. There's not much to spoil. You'll also thank me for saving two hours OF YOUR LIFE!!

The plot (spoiler alert):
* Hit-man exits the killing business. For love, of course.
* His love dies from some disease, and gives the ex hit-man a dog after her death (special delivery).
* Some Russian mobster-thugs like his car, so they rob his house to steal the car. In the process they kill his dog.
* Ex hit-man goes ballistic. Pun intended. He then kills about 50+ people on a dog-revenge-warpath.
* He gets a new dog in the end. Because conveniently, in the ""docks"" where the final showdown happens, there's a veterinarian hospital. At the shipping docks... right.

OK. That's it. That's the movie. Two hours of incessant violence, head-shots, more violence, and bad acting. I kept sitting there thinking.. is something interesting going to happen? Will the acting get better? Will there be a plot twist? No, No, and...No.

That said, it was more entertaining than I thought it would be. The hotel safe zone for assassins was almost charming in a homicidal way.

I only watched it because my husband had already purchased it, and I was feeling miserable anyway.

In fact, it has become one of my see-it-a-bunch-each year movies, which was a total surprise, as no other Reeves movie has gotten that far. Lots of action, a plot even I could understand, about like ""One Long Day,"" very capable supporting actors, fine photography, vicous fights, which, for once, don't make the fighter look like a moron for keeping his guns silent while wielding the deadly Kung Fuii, and so on.

This movie will not help us get out of Iran, will not make us understand how the Brits broke the German code, nor why Prof. Hawkins is smarter than you and I, and ten each of our friends, BUT it goes well with icy Pepsi and a pizza, and will be viewed again and again, now and then, which ""One Long Day"" may not be.",1426291200,,902,4.401197604790419

The campy feel to the culture in which Wick moves is a great addition to something that could have taken itself too seriously.  Some of the best close combat pistol work I have ever seen illustrates very well how effective a firearm is in a close encounter.  Sure, some of the choreography is set up to let the hero prevail...  So what?  It is done in a way that makes it work within the culture and settings framing the action.  The stitches are a hoot, as you would see in a graphic comic. (you'll get it when you see it.)
(Not to get off topic, but there are self defense experts and martial artists who claim that a gun is not a close range weapon.  If you are considering training in combative discipline and the prospective trainer says that a gun is not a good close quarters weapon, walk away.)

Yeah, it is a great ride with gritty stuff galore and some small surprises that just tickle the action geek.

Keanu Reeves does a great job playing a revenge driven hitman that comes out of retirement for one last revenge filled time. Very stereo typical but still fun to watch. He takes on the Russian mob after they steal his dog (his dead wife's last gift to him) The Russian mob is played by a whole shebang of stereo typical Russian bad guys ( the loser son, the Russian boss who only knows kill, the Russian muscle heads who protect the boss, ect) but like I said still fun to watch.

Fight scenes are top notch. If I had to complain, it would be the slight dark tone that the movie starts with. Not dark in that he is a killer - dark in the sense as to WHY he is a killer. It begins very sad becoming sadder, and a movie like this didn't need that. If it was brought out later in the film, or in flashbacks, it would have been better, instead of setting the starting tone. But after that, it's a fun ride - villains are truly bad, you love to see them get it.

6773302,4,B00OV3VGP0,"""John Wick"" is a great full-tilt action movie with a large body count.  Watching it is a whole lot better than kicking the dog.  Speaking of which, the dog Daisy's death precipitates the bloody rampage that comes.  Keanu Reeves is a lot of fun to watch.  His dialogue is terse.  He has a couple of nice emotional scenes, but mostly portrays a guy with nerves of steel and focus like a laser beam.  In the DVD extras, it talks about how he trained hard in martial arts moves for about three months before filming began.  The action sequences like the first one in his house as he lays in waiting for the bad guys are original and amazing.  Reeves did most of his own stunts for the film, which allows the camera to linger on his face more and gives the audience his riveting stare of evil intent.

Michael Nyqvist plays Wick's nemesis Vigo Tarasov in the film.  Nyqvist came to US attention with his three films from 2009 that started with ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.""  As a mob leader, he's ruthless and icy, giving the character some depth amid the gunfire and car chases.  His son who starts the mayhem is played by Alfie Allen known for ""Game of Thrones.""  As Iosef Tarasov, he is so sleazy and spoiled, that we can actively root for Wick to kill him.  Adrianne Palicki who is current in the series ""The Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" plays the insouciant Ms. Perkins who breaks the rules of the killer's hotel without a care.  Her action scene with Reeves in boxer shorts is as hilarious as it is wild with Palicki tossing out one liners with a vengeance.  John Leguizamo, Ian McShane, Dean Winters and Willem Defoe are also part of this exquisite cast.  I particularly liked Lance Reddick's ultra-controlled hotel clerk and hope he'll be back for John Wick 2 which I read is now in the works.

The DVD extras help flesh out how the film came to fruition.  Directors Chad Stahelski & David Leitch were have a career as stunt men and designing great action sequences.  When Reeves approached them about John Wick, they asked to be able to pitch to direct the feature, and were rewarded with their first film as directors.  The two seem to have a great collaborative relationship and are on tap to direct JW2.  I enjoyed hearing Reeves enthusiastically talk about the project and how he was a proponent of adding more violence and bigger car crashes to the film.

""John Wick"" is not a film with a great moral message, but it is a lot of fun to watch the cast smash things up.  Enjoy!",1425945600,,2484,4.4688888888888885

6773308,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Initially, all we know of John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is that he is deeply mourning the recent death of his wife from cancer.  Soon after her funeral, John receives delivery of a puppy his wife arranged to be sent to him after her death, so he'd still have something - someone - to love.  When a chance run-in with some Russian mob thugs results in Wick turning down their offer to buy his cherry 1969 Mustang, they show up at John's house and beat him, steal the car ... and kill his dog.  And that is when we learn John is a former mob assassin, The Boogeyman, who got out of the business when he fell in love five years before - but is now back, and after the leader of the thugs who took everything from him ... who also happens to be the son of his former mob boss.  Reeves' ""block of wood"" acting style is perfect here, and if you can handle that Wick kills about 5,000 people in this film there is a mindless, almost surreal fun about John Wick that somehow keeps things both deadly serious and darkly humorous.  Often at the same time.  (from sixtysecondcinema.blogspot.com)",1425859200,2,1079,4.343283582089552

But it is one of those cases where the film is so slick and stylish that all the energy went into that and NOT into CHARACTER development or story, or writing. Despite Keanu's best grunts and raspy-voiced deliveries there was nothing to make me care earnestly about the outcome of his situation. He is a hit man after all, who killed for a living, presumably other folks who also had wives and maybe even kids and dogs. What makes him special? The film never answers this question, or even asks it beyond the obvious fact that he excelled at his job. So the movie is an empty exercise in killing, just like a video-game. It is an empty gesture. And I felt emptier having seen it.",1425859200,8,716,4.350746268656716
6773311,4,B00OV3VGP0,"This is a very good film for those who like action/adventure movies but it is not necessarily one that you want to take someone to see on a first date. The reason: This is an intense movie and it features a fair amount of blood and gore, which is to be expected in a film about people who kill other people for a living.
In it, Keanu Reeves plays a retired killer named John Wick who is living quietly as he grieves for his late wife, a cancer victim.
Wick, however, goes back to work when the spoiled son of a Russian mob boss wrongs him in a brutal, savage way. Reeves brings a quiet intensity to the role as he seeks revenge for what is, in his mind, an unspeakable act. He is ably backed up by a strong cast, which includes the always excellent Willem Dafoe.
The writing is, well, nothing to write home about. The story line is simplistic and the dialogue is predictable. That said, the acting, pacing and photography in this film overcome what is, in my opinion, a thin script.
I'd recommend it for those who enjoy gangster movies with a lot of atmosphere.",1425859200,17,1061,4.31

6773322,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I know Keanu Reeves is not considered an Oscar worthy actor. However, he is one of my favorite living actors. So I have seen many of his movies, even the ones critics did not like. Warning: I am not an objective reviewer.

In this movie, Keanu plays a retired hit man for a Russian mobster. He had to somehow buy his retirement. He retired because he finally married and want to spend time with his wife. He lives in a beautiful modern home in the non-city setting. He dresses in very nice casual clothing.

In this semi near future world, the Russian mobster John Wick worked for in the past owns all of the political and church leaders in the city where John Wick worked.

When the movie begins, John Wick's wife has died and he is depressed. The doorbell rings and a delivery is made. It is an adorable puppy and a message from his wife. At first John is underwhelmed by the gift, but the puppy is so persistent in following him around and demanding affection, that he does develop an affection for the puppy and takes her with him everywhere.

One day, while out in his classic red car with his puppy, he stops for gas at a rural gas station. Some thugs are hanging around and one of them insists on buying the car. John Wick refuses and leaves. From this point on the film becomes violent. The thugs follow him and find out where he lives. That night they attack his home, beat up John Wick, kill his puppy, steal his car.

John buries his puppy. He cleans his house. He digs in his basement to retrieve his collection of weapons and the special gold coins that hit men are paid with in the future world. He dresses in his all black hit man clothes (Keanu looks so good in black). He finds out who the thugs were who killed his puppy and stole his classic car. The thug who wanted the car was the only son of the Russian mobster who rules the city. Thus begins the wonderful vendetta of John Wick against the mobster, his son, and everyone who works for the mobster. John Wick was the top hit man before he retired and he has not lost his touch. He kills many people, he uses many methods to kill. No one should underestimate John Wick, though some do.

One of my favorite parts of the movie is the cleaners. I liked the concept of the cleaners. They are a company that comes to your home or hotel in a van. They are tough looking guys. These are not your usual house cleaners. They clean up the mess made by killing one or multiple people. They bag up the bodies in plastic and take them away to be disposed of. You pay them in the special gold coins and they leave. When they leave, there is not a single clue left that anyone was killed at your home or hotel. There is not bill or invoice to indicate you have hired them. They come, they ""clean"", you pay them, and they disappear.

I am not a violent person but I do have a strong judgmental personality so I really enjoyed John Wick's vendetta and his meting out justice.",1425772800,,2930,4.268468468468469

It's by no means a perfect movie and there are some pretty flaws, but it's still enjoyable.

6773352,4,B00OV3VGP0,The young Mr. Reeves is one of my all-time favorite actors and the cast assembled for this action adventure was phenomenal. From the beginning I was hoping for some better thought processing by John as is evident by not noticing he was followed home and then in code white walks into a severe ass-kicking in his own home. A man touted as sent to kill the Boogey-man would not have had to endure this treatment from fools. I prefer not to go on and on about the many discrepancies in his given talents and failure to act more seriously and aggressively but letting his former employer walk was as stupid as leaving Ms. Perkins alive. A real Boogey-man would not have acted so foolishly. All said and done it was a fun walk on the darker side. Also John's gun handling was fairly good technically but I'd have liked to see some of the Matrix level Martial Arts applied as well. A very nice romp for the adventuresome and the dogs were sweet..,1425686400,,940,4.4393063583815024

We see a man in love, mourning, grieving and then take up the reins of a life that had, for a while, been buried in concrete. This film goes from being sad, quiet, tender and sweet to being vengeful, fast, action packed, stylish and extremely satisfying. I say extremely satisfying because some very nasty people get what they deserve. In a way the big bad dog has turned on his master and boy does he turn. And the best thing, the master is the one who is the most scared. Keanu Reeves is amazing in this role. You see John Wick cry, you see a tender and sweet side to him when he cuddles his dog, you see him beaten up, you see him angry then you see him composed, focused and ready to kill and he is so good at it. I saw the trailers to this film and could not wait to see it so I bought the DVD from the USA. We get to see this film in the cinema in the UK in April and yes, I will definitely be seeing this film at the cinema, and probably more than once.

He is so feared no one even bothers him.  Then his wife passes away from natural causes and leaves him a puppy.  Three thugs who don't know who he is break into his home, knock him out from behind, steal his car and kill his puppy.  The leader of the thugs turns out to be the son of the gangster that Wick use to work for.  The gangster knows what to expect.  This is a slam bang violent action packed shoot em up.

I'm not a country song lover or hater, but this thing was like viewing the MOST CLICHE country song. It was ""My wife died, they stoled my car, my dog got kill't, and I'm pissed off :( "".

That is basically the entire movie.

The lead, played by Keanu Reeves, has just experienced the death of his wife. A Russian mob(?) youth messes with him, knowing nothing about who he is, steals his car, beats him up and kills his dog. From that point on, it is a point and shoot video game. According to my husband, who is a an avid gamer, it wasn't even that good of one. Even I've been more entertained by watching my husband play Minecraft.

There was more depth & plot development in the 'Legally Blonde' movies. Neither of us liked this movie, and this wasn't outside our normal viewing preferences.

I do not venture fourth to rate a movie as four stars, but this movie did it for me. I rated the movie four stars, not because it was a better than average ""blockbuster"" or mainstream movie, or because it substantive like Oscar award winning movies. No, John Wick deserves four stars because as an action movie it delivers gut wrenching, brutal and rustic action without succumbing to being overly gory, or a blood bath such as the fairly recent Rambo movie. John Wick is a tasteful and sophisticated action film, using realistic and intensely coordinated combat styles and gun play while delivering a satisfying plot because of its narrative and casting.

Reeves' portrayal of Wick is fantastic; stoic, stern and at times vulnerable.  As for his handling of the action scenes, he spent 4 months training for them and it shows.

6773458,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Entertaining and well done.  The movie builds a good background and quickly plays to win you over to Wick's side, doing so with very efficiently to get on with the main line of the plot without dragging too long in the mud of character development.  There's a few very tough scenes early in the movie that win you over - perhaps in a somewhat rude, even cold-blooded way.  Because of those, even after you learn who Wick is you still are on his side, even while being conflicted about taking sides with characters that are just different shades of dark.

There are a couple different parallel tracks, not so much subplots as supporting lines.  They feel predictable, but then resolve in unexpected ways.

The gunplay is a little over the top, but for escapism that's not really a problem.  The point is made - Wick is just _that good_.

Four Stars:  There's a few quirks.  There's a little excess theatre for the screen, needed but perhaps could be done a little more in-line with the overall feel of the movie.

Watch it, but don't over-analyze it.  Let go of reality for a couple hours and enjoy the show.",1425427200,,1107,4.5353535353535355

6773469,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Keanu Reeves has matured into a great actor. This time he is the emotionless and steel faced killer John Wick. Here is a film where there is a big twist to the hero. Wick is mourning the loss of his beloved wife. Before she died, she arranged for an adorable beagle puppy to be delivered to Wick to keep him grounded and have a reason to live. It's a beautiful sentiment that is destroyed when  the son of a Russian Mobster and his band of thugs attack Wick in his home. Wick's shocking secret is soon revealed as he embarks on a rampage of revenge. The body count is soon into the dozens as Wick mercilessly pursues his target. Wick may have been a random target but he is no stranger to the mobster.
This is one stylistic journey into violence and mayhem. There is a beauty and a poetry to the film. The photography and choreography of motion are amazing. Nevertheless, one should be aware that the killing is nonstop as more and more players enter the seen.
Reeves stays cold and calm and stone faced throughout the film. He is the anti-hero that was forced into his acts of revenge. Emotionless is the only way to play John Wick and Reeves is on top of his game.",1425340800,,1166,4.324200913242009

The premise is super simple, but like a lot of other reviews the world in which the story takes place is rich, open, and a bit comic book-y.  That last bit is important because that lends the movie to some cool moments of gun-fu.

Keanu Reeves is quite convincing and quite menacing as an ex-assassin seeking revenge, as well. According to the extras on the disc, he went through extensive training to be able to do what he does, and it shows. He is definitely on his game. John Wick was fast-paced and fun and NOT for the faint of heart.

6773481,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Not very much like Lassie and Timmy, but more specifically the story of a man seeking justice for the abuse of his dog Daisy by the witless son of a Russian mobster. Keanu Reeves plays the role of John Wick, a man haunted by his past misdeeds and the need to atone for them while simultaneously seeking justice for his dog. I hadn't seen anything about this movie until a friend recommended it recently, but Reeves is at his best since The Matrix and carries on his mastery of the art of a single emotion as various roadblocks pop up in his quest. Non-stop action in this one, just enough plot to hold it together without the director get in the way of the story.

This review is coming from a guy who digs realistic action movies( IE no cheesy 80's movie explosions) like The Way of The Gun, Rambo, Heat, Iron Clad, Raid 2, etc. and this movie delivers! If you pay attention to the way he fights and shoots it's extremely tactical. He uses the C.A.R. system to shoot sometimes which is badass. When he gets into physical altercations it's a struggle. John doesn't Arnold everybody up in every scene, he gets his ass kicked sometimes but he always bounces back with that insane amount of anger that he portrays on screen, it's awesome! My dad noticed that this is the first movie that he saw someone get stabbed that actually pulled the knife out (like a reflex that you would have if someone jabbed you with a knife) instead of immediately curling up and dying. He also switched the knife in his hands when fighting John which was something else that was knew to see. Pretty much the best choreographed action movie thus far.

People reload their weapons, no random Michael Bay explosions, awesome fights and gun fights, STORY was GREAT!(seriously it was sweet and emotional at times, but I ain't crying *dabs eye with tissue), tons of action, beautiful cars, and beautiful women.

People need to realize that this is an A+ action movie, this ain't a romance so get off this movies back and take your filthy bondage straps and whips with you!",1425254400,,1389,4.66530612244898

This is not a story about good and evil, it is simply about revenge because John Wick is anything but a good man, just a man that has lost everything and a young thug who thinks he is above facing any consequences to his actions. Until he crosses paths with John. Then it is a cat and mouse game, finding, following and destroying everything and everyone in his path to get to the thug. It is action packed and will keep you riveted. Is it a great movie, no, but it is a very good movie to pass a couple of hours, so bring out the popcorn and sit back and watch Keanu Reeves in an unlikely role that proves he can do more than fly around in the Matrix.",1425254400,,732,3.9527027027027026

3) Some rude and crude Russian kicks dirt in his sand box.  CHECK
4) bad-ass hero is compelled find and open his can of whip ass weapons. CHECK
5) carnage begins and continues until the final credits roll across screen.. CHECK

I acknowledge that there are times when it is fun to just sit and watch the predicable ride of a good action movie.
Equalizer fits the bill and unfortunately John Wick is a carbon copy that has been run on an old printer.  It vaguely resembles a good action movie, but suffers from implausible action sequences and poorly written plot.  Far too often things just did not seem within the realm of possible for me.

The body count had to surpass 50 if not more and throughout the whole act of Wick's revenge not one...NOT ONE cop or siren is heard throughout the movie, with the exception of one encounter at Wick's home with a police officer who knows Wick and obviously what Wick does or did for living.  Wilhem Defoe appears in the movie as a confidant of Wick but it's not explained how they are connected.  Take a pass on this one.

6773607,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Rented on instant video, so I can not address the quality or content of the Blue-ray or DVD.  Nevertheless, as for the movie itself, The number of 1 star ratings entered just yesterday again proves that movie preferences, like most preferences, are completely subjective.  I agree that this, like any other movie, won't be enjoyed by everyone.  However, if one, like myself, loves action filled and/or high body count movies like Payback, Red, Lucky # Selvin, Shoot 'Em Up The Professional', by Luc Besson, and David Cronenberg's `A History of Violence', is a classic... or even the Unforgiven and Grand Torino, then you are more likely than not to enjoy John Wick.  Yes, the plot is a rather thin but when John explains his reasoning, as did Mel in Payback, it's perfectly logical.  In fact, in this instance, the impact of the explanation made me mist up with tears as did the scenes involving John's wife and pet.  The scene involving the pet are not graphic, but one is given enough detail to make one enjoy the thrilling death of each and every villain and henchman.  Overall, for me, the movie was a high octane, thrill ride of mayhem, some emotion and just plain Shot 'Em Up and ""Bloody Good"" Fun!  I'd love a sequel heck I'd take a prequel. LOL.

As an aside, furthermore,  I don't think that b/c one does not enjoy a movie that he or she should insult the intelligence of those who do, e.g. this movie could only be enjoyed by ""the lobotomized"".  Such personal attacks are without justification and completely uncalled for don't you think.

6773661,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Im not one of those people who decides to attend a screening of a movie because a certain actor/actress has decided to grace the film with his/her presence.  I attend screenings of films that I know will keep my attention, and if a certain famous actor/actress happens to be the principle actor in that film then good for him/her.  I go into a movie theatre with the same need that I have when opening a book, getting lost in a story.

Over the years I have developed a taste for a certain genre of film, and there are certain movie actors/actresses that tend to reappear in the films that I favor. Denzel Washington, Tom Cruise, Robert Downey Junior, Vin Diesel, Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, Christian Bale, Michelle Rodriguez, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Keanu Reeves are examples.  Some of these actors have occupied a diversified assemblage of roles, while others have tended to stick to what they know best.  I tend to gravitate toward movies that feature these actors/actresses in roles because I know that Im going to be entertained.

Ive watched dozens of Keanu Reeves movies over the years.  Point Break, Speed, The Matrix, and John Wick are my favorites.  All of my favorite Keanu Reeves films are action films; and Keanu tends to thrive in action and science fiction themed films.  However, Keanu is a brave soul who has broadened his repertoire of roles in dramas, suspense, and comedies (He was good in Somethings Gotta Give). But it is in the action film where Keanu Reeves proves that he is a great actor.

Keanu Reeves will probably never win an Oscar, but he is still one of the greatest actors living because of what he can do as an actor in action films.  He reaffirms his greatness as an action star in the film, John Wick.

John Wicks plot is very simple to follow.  Keanu Reeves plays the titular character of John Wick, an elite assassin/hitman who retires from the game after meeting and marrying the love of his life (played by Bridget Moynahan).  Wicks happiness is short lived after his wife succumbs to death from a mystery illness.  John Wick is of course crushed by the death of his wife; however, in death his wife provides him with a reason to keep on living by bequeathing to him the gift of a very cute puppy dog.  After some moments of reservation John accedes to his wifes wish, and makes the resolution to love and raise the puppy that his wife left for him.

While filling up his tank at a gas station one morning, John is approached by some Russian mobsters, all of whom are very interested in the car he drives.  John rebuffs their attempts at conversation before speeding off towards home, but the mobsters make the mistake of not letting things go.  They follow John to his home, and while they are there they beat him, rob him of his car, and.kill the puppy that his dead wife left him.  John comes out of retirement in response to the mobsters affront and embarks on the journey of exacting revenge upon his foes.

There are many great dramatic actors that infuse the film with respectability (Willem Dafoe, John Leguizamo, Michael Nyquist, Ian McShane, etc), but they are most ancillary characters in this film.  The success of the film rests on the shoulders of Keanu Reeves and his prowess as an action hero; and he once again proves (at the age of 50) that he is still capable of carrying an action film.

The action scenes in this film are entertaining, visceral, and intricate.  Ive read that Keanu Reeves was trained in the disciplines of judo, Brazilian ju-jitsu, and Japanese ju-jitsu for the film; and it shows. The film features many scenes of Keanu Reeves in close quarter combat with his foes, with many of the scenes being long, graphic, and gruesome.  Thank goodness the film was free of a form of choppy editing that would have decreased the effectiveness of the action sequences.

John Wick reminds me of Hard Boiled (1992), an action film that featured Chow Yun Fat. The principle character in both films is a man who uses his fists, legs, and guns as weapons to punish his enemies. In these movies Keanu Reeves and Chow Yun Fat deliver a type of action performance that not many actors in Hollywood could dream of pulling off, which is why that in John Wick Keanu Reeves once again proves his indispensability as an action star.",1425081600,,4293,4.638044914134743

6773821,4,B00OV3VGP0,"John Wick(released Oct/14)stars,among others,Keanu Reeves,Michael Nyqvist,Alfie Allen,Ian McShane,John Leguizamo and Willem Dafoe. This is a hard action romp starring Reeves,which is actually reminiscent of Jean Claude Van Damme's Wake of Death in intensity. In fact at times I could see JCVD in Keanu's place. However h(Reeves)e handles himself well here and the tension is nicely built throughout, until the final climactic moments.
The story starts out with Reeves severely injured,exiting his SUV and laying bleeding on the ground with a phone video playing of his wife. Time reverses as we now begin to discover the events leading up to this moment. Reeve's had a deep and loving relationship with his wife until tragically she was struck with a terminal condition which led to her being on life support. We are there to witness Reeves giving the ok to the doctor to pull the plug on his bedridden wife. After the funeral and at home he receives a package and in it is a cute little female Beagle pup in a cage. It is a gift from his departed wife. The two bond instantly.
At a gas station Reeves is filling up his /69 Mustang when he is approached by a Russian thug who wants to buy his car. Reeves refuses (in their language-something we will find out more about later),and drives away. Later that night Reeves home is burglarized by the very same group who now beat Reeves,kill his pup and steal his car. The Russian's take the car to a garage but the owner refuses to deal with it. It seems the thug who wanted/stole the car is the son of the head of the Russian mob in NYC.His father after contacting the garage owner to find out the why and wherefores, summons his son for a meeting. The father puts a beating on his son and tells him that he has stolen from a man he should never have. One who will stop at nothing to get revenge after what he has done.
True to the Russian's fears Reeves IS on a mission of revenge. Reeves was involved in a seedy underworld before he was married. Now he returns to this world in order to act out his plans of revenge,knowing that the Russians will try and stop him. They first storm his home but he dispatches each man(about a dozen) with rapidity. Reeves decides to check into a ""hotel"" which discreetly handles Reeves and his ilk. He now uses this as his home base from which to work. He goes after the Russians where they hang out in a nearby hotel,going after the son who is thickly guarded. By some stroke of luck the son manages to escape his clutches. After this his father puts him into a safe house for his own protection.
Reeves has a contract put out on him but an assassin sent to kill him fails. However another one who has been watching him and has had plenty of opportunity to do him in(an old friend and fellow assassin) is now warning him with missed shots from his scoped rifle. Reeves again takes the offensive and attends a  church which is just a front that the Russians use to funnel all their assets through. Reeves burns their""assets"".He waits outside for the Russians to come and they do. But Reeves gets captured and almost killed. After escaping(with his friends help once more) he confronts the mob father,who he spares for information on the location of his son. Reeves goes to that location and finally gets his man.
The Russian however now has Reeves friend (the one who has saved Reeves all along) and kills him. Reeves gets a call from the owner of the hotel he was staying in. Reeves learns that he not only dispatched the assassin who unsuccessfully tried to take him out(no ""business"" is ever allowed to be conducted on the hotel premises),but tells Reeves of the Russian father who is trying to flee the city in a helicopter .Reeves rushes to the area and catches up to two SUVS in transit to the helipad. He takes out one by pushing it over a wall with a fatal drop,and then slowly takes on each man from the second one until all that is left is the Russian father. The two fight hand to hand and Reeves is severely injured,but the mobster is worse off. Reeves leaves the scene and the story now comes full circle. Reeves slowly gets up and finds refuge in a nearby vet clinic. As he ""repairs""himself  he spots a caged pitbull. He opens the door and takes him out. The film ends as we see Reeves and his new companion walking back home.
The film's opening moments move along well,as the makers build us the foundation upon which the rest of the film will sit;Reeves injury,the death of his wife,the killing of Reeves' only living expression of his wife's devotion,his Beagle pup, and as a result,his forced return to his old life. From here the tension builds constantly throughout. I have heard some criticism and/or ""funny"" remarks/jabs about the point of Reeves seeking revenge for just a dog. Well this is totally unfounded nonsense. It is what the pup represented and stood for, that the Russians rip away from him for a lousy car jacking. It is totally believable and within reason. There are always those who are quick to tear things down to their lowest common denominator,aren't there?.The main body of the film deals with Reeves revenge and his immersion in his old ""world""in order to exact it. The fight scenes are well choreographed and help us tremendously in the believability of the situations Reeves faces. The entire cast does a great job.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all a wonderful action film,full of the latter with a good supporting cast. Reeves does well in his brooding and dark character. A solid 4 stars,maybe even a bit below 4 1/2.",1425081600,,5626,4.563798219584569

The movie is basically a collection of stunts stitched together into what amounts to a twelve year old boy's masturbation fantasy after he gets beat up walking home from school.

6773826,5,B00OV3VGP0,"John Wick is a simple yet elegant (violent elegance) revenge story. Seriously, it spends 15-20 minutes setting up the ""you took my stuff [""stuff"" not necessarily being tangible items]; now I'm going to kill you"" scenario, and everything flowed from there. After that, it's more than an hour of nearly non-stop action and mayhem and lots and lots of bullets. It's kind of amazing in its simplicity, actually, because lots of action movies go for this sort of thing but make the ""reason"" way too complicated. John Wick hits it just right.

I think the reason it really works is what I'm going to call the ""-edit-hole paradigm."" See, Wick runs into an -edit-hole. One of those entitled -edit-holes who thinks it's okay to do whatever he wants to do so, when Wick tells him ""no,"" the -edit-hole has to wreck Wick's life. We've all run into those guys (and, yes, ""guys"" means men because it's almost always men) who think they should just get what they want by virtue of nothing more than who they are and who will resort to violence of some sort (not necessarily physical) to get it. Generally, we are unable to do anything about those people. Which is what makes Wick so great because, after the -edit-hole does what he does, we find out who Wick used to be, and Wick goes after him. It's very... cathartic.

So, yeah, if you're not into action movies, this one isn't for you. If you're looking for a deep, meaningful, complicated story, this one isn't for you. This is pretty much as straightforward as you get. It's as straightforward as two kids on the playground who have a fight because one kid has a toy the other kid (the -edit-hole) wants. But with bullets.

Keanu Reeves is perfect in this part. I mean, he's so perfect that there are, maybe, only one or two other actors who could slip into this role without looking like they were trying to wear a suit coat that just didn't really fit.

Speaking of other actors, all of the other actors in this were great. You might say that it shouldn't be a difficult job to have a small part in a movie like this, and that might be true, but it didn't stop all of them from fitting their roles like fingers into a glove. Of particular note were Alfie Allen (the -edit-hole), Willem Dafoe (the wild card), Adrianne Palicki (whom I am liking more and more and I hope that Marvel goes all the way with her and actually turns her into Mockingbird), Lance Reddick (who is probably generally underrated), and Ian McShane (whom I just like). Oh, also, Clarke Peters (from The Wire along with Reddick and just very good).

These kinds of movies are what I would usually refer to as cotton candy. A lot of fluff but not a lot of substance. However, despite the fact that this movie is probably something like 85% action, it's backed by a kernel of solid story with enough hints at the back story to make it really intriguing. Basically, it escapes my cotton candy classification, and I will actually have to watch it again. It may even be a movie I need to own, which is saying a lot from me for an action movie.

So, if you like action flicks, I'd say that this one is a must-see.

I just hope they don't decide to do a sequel. If anything, go back and give us the back story, but this one feels complete and doesn't need anything after.",1424995200,,3275,4.448333333333333

6773911,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Keanu Reeves stars in this violent action film.  The first question one might pose is, is it TOO violent?  To which I think the answer is a resounding YES!  It makes no apologies for the high body count, depictions of bones breaking, blood spurting, bodies and bullets flying.  The second question: is there any REDEEMING MORAL QUALITY about it?  The answer to that, I think, is a guarded, Barely.  Now come possible plot spoilers.

As the film opens we see Reeves/Wick staggering out of a car and falling to the ground, to all appearances dying.  Then the film flashes back to what led to that moment.  OH NOsay it AINT SOyou aren't going to make me watch an hour and a half of relentless violence, just to see the main character die in the end, are you?

Well, not exactly, no.  The film does offer a glimpse of hope at the very end.  But what a road to get there

It turns out Wick was, for want of a fancier word, the most talented hit-man for a ruthless Russian mafia which had infiltrated its tentacles around New York City.  Eventually he fell in love and got out of the business, only to have this one love of his life die a few short years later, presumably from some cancer.  After her death he appears dazed & lost in his obviously luxurious apartmentuntil he receives a posthumous note from his wife that begins to give him hope for love of some sort in his life again.

Alas, this hope is abruptly shattered by an unexpected bad turn of events.  A group of young toughs follow him home, beat the crap out of him and rob him of his beloved muscle car, among other things.  Unfortunately they didn't actually kill him.  Also unfortunately, the lead punk just happens to be the son of the boss Wick had worked for.  Now the tables are set for a massive showdown between Wick [virtually on his own] and the entire Russian mob he had worked for.

The boss of the gang is played by Michael Nyqvist, but the one other character I actually recognized.from SOMEWHEREwas his son, the one that stole Wicks carplayed by one Alfie Allen, best known as the failed son Theon Greyjoy, raised like a stepson by Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell in The Game of Thrones.  Now, here he is in this movie.

Amidst all this violence the closest to philosophical the movie got was a pair of conversations Reevess character Wick has with Viggo, his former boss, in which they first agree that their lives are cursed, and in a final showdown, as they both appear to be lying on the ground dying, they say to each other, See ya! [in hell, that is].  Perhaps, if there is any moral at all, it is that very bad men can best be exterminated by other, more talented very bad men and sometimes maybe its a good thing for the world in general.

I give this film a B, in part for some novel fight scenes, in part for the sheer relentlessness of its action, and finally [and most of all] for the interesting cinematography which for much of the film manages to make scenes almost [but not quite] monochromatic.  In each scene one color scheme will predominate: dark blue, light blue, dusky gold, etc.  Other colors in the palette are used only to counterpoint the main color themethe color of blood, or red cloth being one frequent example (doh).  Regardless, the cinematography often managed to make what otherwise might look mundane, or ugly, or puzzling and suspenseful, also strangely beautiful.",1424736000,,3376,4.499178981937603

Keanu Reeves has definitely succeeded in making his mark as a top-rated action star in the movie John Wick.

Reeves was already good in The Matrix movies; he was the Kick-Butt anointed Good Guy in Constantine, and; he developed his unarmed tactical skills as well as his skill with weapons in other movies such as 47th Ronin and others.

As a certified firearms instructor, the movie John Wick NAILED the proper use of firearms with seldom Hollywood mistakes. in addition, there were no gratuitous sex scenes in the movie. Just pure, high octane fighting scenes at the level--or better-than the most action scenes in the movie Heat.

This movie is a classic KEEPER!

6773968,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Entertaining action-packed crime thriller.  It starts off as a drama and it just gets better with ever scene.  I was not really completely satisfied with Keanu's and Dafoe's acting in this production.  It seemed to me that both actors were not entirely engaged in the story.  Apart from Keanu's crying scene at the beginning he is totally all shots-n-punches in this one.  Also, the acting scenes (or rather the spoken script) between Keanu and Defoe is lame and amateurish.  What saves this film is an interesting story-line and lots of well choreographed action scenes involving shoot outs and fist fights. We even get to hear Keanu speak some Russian :)

In short the film is about a retired contract killer who against his won will is forced to return to his former profession and slowly but surely takes on a local East Coast (New York City) Russian organized crime family.  Its like watching Eastern Promises (2007) meet Jason Statham from any of his Transporter films.  BTW: the shoot-out scene in the bath-house /night club is epic.",1424649600,,1040,4.863636363636363

Why do I care about him, his stolen car (bought with blood money??) and a dog that had maybe 5 minutes of screen time?

The plot is good enough to keep John Wick's revenging moving forward but yes I know its not the most logical motive for a revenge rampage. My only argument for the plot making some sense is that this guy was a former hitman so his morality probably doesn't line up with a normal person.

6774030,4,B00OV3VGP0,"There's a ridiculous plotline that has something to do with Keanu Reeves playing a respected and legendary ex-assassin who falls in love and gets out of the killing business to have a real life.  He is happy for several years, then bad things happen (if you're a dog lover, you'll definitely cringe) and he is vulnerable.  His sordid and violent past rises up on the skinniest of premises and he is back to being big, bad John Wick. Having said that, my advice is to suspend disbelief, make some popcorn and just sit back and enjoy a thriller-action flick with Reeves in decent form.  There's a fair amount of humor and irony thrown in and the film seems to make fun of itself, as if it knows it's treading a fine line between predictable farce and legit cinematic fare. There's a kind of comic book/graphic novel feel to the film (a posh hotel for assassins in town on ""business"", some predictable action sequences) but the violence and gore are not as overwhelmingly a part of the visual canvas as, say, 300: Rise of an Empire. It was entertaining in the same way Denzel Washington's ""The Equalizer"" was, though Washington's performance had more nuance and heart. Also, Willem DeFoe plays a small, but key role that keeps you guessing about his character's motives. I recommend it as a solid pick for entertaining action distraction.",1424563200,,1335,4.721030042918455

When the son of a crime boss and his buddies steal Wick's car, beat him up, and kill his dog, he seeks revenge on any and all that stand in the way of him exacting revenge on his dog's killers.

However, during Keanu's eventual outburst and moment to perform on an emotionally charged level, he just comes-off as having some kind of cognitive mental decline that's affecting his enunciation.

Also, even if I did like super-human type movies, I did not like the character at all.  He was no better than anyone else.  If he would have died and any other character in the movie would have lived, it would have made no difference.

Not like Breaking Bad, for example, where even though Walter White does really bad things, we still kinda root for  him.  {also not like Breaking Bad in that the acting sucks {My partner said give Reeves one more chance.  Mistake:  He still sucks}, the writing sucks, the directing sucks, the action sucks and none if it is believable.

By the way, real guns have recoil are are really loud.  Reeves gun must have been magic.  It had no recoil and did  not cause him to go deaf when she shot it right next to his own ear....

There truly wasn't anything in them that made it look any different from any other action revenge flick but somehow, they were capturing my interest. And it was worth it. Word to the wise, don't mess with a grieving, retired hitman because he's got a lot of pent up anger and rage to unleash. A couple of quibbles -- a retired hitman would have an extreme security system to ward off bratty Russian mobsters (that's a real quibble) and secondly, the cars! Why, of why, did they have to destroy the cars??? Yeah, because it's an action flick. This movie is slick, focused and very stylish but it never gets caught up in the jazzy neon aura to lose sight of the John Wick story. Great score. In fact, I ordered it. What a fantastic job the director did with the Red Circle fight scenes. Reeves does very well in this film, the minimal dialogue suits his minimal acting. I really appreciated that his character was no longer on the top of his game and got beat up and tossed around. Wish there had been more Leguizamo. He's a really great actor.

Keanu Reeves plays a retired contract killer, who goes temporarily back into business to avenge an attack on himself by his former boss' son. Of course, the kid had no idea who Keanu Reeves was, so he didn't see the problem with stealing his car and beating KR up (with friends, of course). I have seen all of KR's movies and I'd have to rate this one in the top 3 or 4.

6774234,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Some cheeseplate dialogue, as is with any action movie. However, the premise is cool. And the direct manner in which the Protangonist dispatches his adversaries is on point. I have read other reviews that completely tear down every aspect of the film and read WAY too far into minor details. People who have to focus on things like that already made up their minds going into it that they would find a bunch of things to complain about. It doesn't make them seem more intelligent, as they like to believe. It is an action film. You should be able to write off the ""small stuff"" and at least TRY to enjoy the ride. If you know you're going to be annoyed or disatisfied going in to it, then don't start. I don't watch ""Fast and Furious"" sequels. Because I KNOW I won't like one single moment of it.

6774273,3,B00OV3VGP0,"Ok First off I am a Keanu Reeves fan I will always see his movies.  Now... about John Wick.  It's a pretty straight forward film about a guy who is targeted by some baddies of course they pick the WRONG guy to mess with.  I get that action films are all about action, JW has PLENTY of great action scenes and some rather original combat engagements that was inspiring.  Sometimes, its not all about the action, I personally would have liked a little bit more character development, something to get us to know a bit more about the JW persona.  A few action scenes I felt were a bit ""staged"" Keanu didn't really seem to follow through with some strikes, so it made some of the hand to hand seem a bit staged.

Sooo  aside from a few weak moments, I took this as an action film and I wasn't going to spend hours figuring out the meaning of the universe.  Good action, some really inventive combat scenes.. good actors... it was a lot of fun.  I hope they take a few notes and hopefully they can work on part 2.",1424390400,3,1008,4.2356020942408374

It's nice to have an action movie where it isn't just everyday Joe caught in bad situation, this is a master assassin going on a revenge fuelled murder-fest. No cowering behind cover constantly or diving out of the way, just headshots, headshots everywhere.

To elaborate on the title this movie has a lot of the same feeling from the other 2 movies. The revenge plot is obviously very much like The Punisher as well as a scene where our main character burns/blows up the antagonists money and business. And the whole John Wick world feels a lot like Constantine, with the secret club where people are not allowed to kill and the main protagonist that everybody knows not to mess with.

Well, heck, I mean after all, what would any former mob hit man do if someone killed his dog?  The major lesson taught by the film is that it would be a good idea to buy stock in Winchester's ammo division.",1424390400,,512,4.483870967741935

The basis of this movie is summed up as an ex hit man got out of the ""game"" for a women who dies of natural cause, (now if she was murdered the story line should make more sense) but no his car was stolen and his dog, that is wife gave him, was killed.

The captions also were really dumb and badly designed and poked in like some sort of hypertext, plus the sound design was just jarring.

If you want good action and a reasonable premise for running amok in a city that isn't as unbelievable or as this stupid film watch Taken with Liam Neeson.

Overall this film is so dumb that I gave up watching it, but then the viewer can decide, obviously some reviewers think it is great but if you appreciate something more challenging even for an action entertainment film don't waste your money.",1424390400,8,746,4.601503759398496

When you find out, you feel like you can relate on a personal level and it drags you right in. You hear yourself saying ""yeah, you picked the wrong guy to mess with"" the entire time as bullets fly and heads are pierced.

A great shoot-em-up and one of Keanu's better films. There is a bit of slack in the character development department, but that is easily overlooked.

6774517,4,B00OV3VGP0,"This is a modern day shoot 'em up version of a righteous man (a former mercenary in this case) set on a path of retribution after having been wronged but the wrong people (think of Taken and Liam Neeson). It also smacks of a combination of the beginning of the old Casino Royale film where James Bond (played by David Niven) is dragged out of retirement and back into his Royal Majesty's service and the end of Unforgiven when Clint Eastwood (also recently out of retirement)  righteously takes out the overly aggressive sheriff and his posse for their inappropriate actions. In between those scenarios as a beginning and an end, you have to add in, almost non-stop, a whole lot more action of the same kind, as Keanu Reeves wreaks havoc on the bad guys and their organization, shooting more ""bad guys"", with incredible accuracy, then I've ever seen in any other movie including the Rambo films. The finale leaves you feeling that the wrong has been put right.",1424390400,,960,4.680473372781065

Good thing, that, as Mr. Reeves has never really had much ""range"" and the writing was, well, let's just say I've read comic books that were more well written. The entire puupy-as-last-gift-from-dead-loved-one schtick wore thin very quickly.

That said, I really did enjoy the film. Nothing like a good revenge flick to get the blood pumping. Some of the fight scenes were very well done.

I did enjoy Michael Nyqvist in the role of Viggo Tarasov. Understated violence and psychopathy is difficult to pull off and he did it very well.

In sum, if you are looking for light entertainment in a slightly bloody vein go ahead and watch John Wick. You won't be disappointed.",1424390400,,788,4.779411764705882

The guild is run secretly from out of what seems to be a hotel, and the hit man John Wick is legendary among them. When he is attacked by the son of an associate who does not know him, this sets off what turns into a movie about retribution. One of Keanu's films I've made an effort to see in recent years. I was not disappointed; it was a pretty straight up story with not much surprising about it, but the basic idea was offset by the idea of his legendary status, and how he is treated by his peers in the guild, and just simply by the action which was taut and thrilling.",1424390400,,654,3.962121212121212

6774649,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Rented the movie upon the recommendations of friends. I was not disappointed. Action is visceral and fast paced. It doesn't pretend to be something it's not. Keanu's acting is never going to be spectacular, but he isn't awful.
The John Wick character has a dark, mysterious, head popping past which isn't clearly explained but makes him an intriguing and very menacing protagonist. You know you're a bad dude when even your enemies don't like making you mad.
The biggest negative was the anticlimactic resolution. I won't ruin it but I thought it left something to be desired. I will however go see any sequel. Worth a at least a rental.",1424390400,,637,4.8

I was disappointed with the story line from the beginning, but I figured it would get better because now it was time to seek revenge! Keanu played his part well that was the only win. The  fight scenes were not what I expected. It seems John Wick's fighting skills were subpar, so not what I expected. The only thing he could do and do well was shoot. He got hurt a lot and still persevered, so I guess that's something.

6774682,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I had a dog. She lived in a puppy mill most of her life, when they were done with her they took her out to a dump in Ely, Nevada and shot her. They left her for dead there but she survived. Her foster home taught her to do things like walk on grass, which she had never seen before. They nursed her back to health, and eventually I adopted her. She was a great dog. A couple of months after that, She developed cancer and we had to put her down. Later that week in a kind of boozey haze I saw John Wick in the Theater.
I love this movie so much. Keanu Reeves punch-shoots about 200 dog killers. Then he rescues a dog from being put down.

6774885,4,B00OV3VGP0,"I'd probably rate it 3 stars if I didn't know what I was getting into and if Keanu wasn't in it. As it was, I got what I expected; a Bourne-type killer with lots of action. Not usually my go-to movie genre, but, I like Keanu so gave it a shot.
Cardinal: ""Viggo will kill me.""
John: ""Uh-huh.""

6774886,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Keanu Reeves does great justice to his role as John Wick.  Apparently a former hit guy, he retires from the business, settles down, gets married, and all seems headed in the right direction.  However, his wife dies and this takes a horrible toll on him.  He tries to find consolence when he gets a puppy, but fate just won't have it.  John has one older classic car and while out runs afowl of some Russian mobsters who want to buy it.  He won't sell, they break into his house, kill is dog, and steal his car.  It's on from there!

The action in this movie is just about non-stop.  Reeves shows his age in this movie (he's been around for quite a while), but that's a good thing.  It helped me believe more in his performance.  Fight scenes are choreographed to perfection, the ""drama"" does not weigh down the movie, and it moves along at quite a nice pace.  Kudos to the fellow actors and the director!

This movie is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.  I'll say one thing:  I sure wouldn't want John Wick after me!  Enjoy.",1424304000,,1040,4.371727748691099

Here he is an ex-assassin who gets out and gets married and she passes away and circumstances conspire to get him back in when he gets re-involved with the Russian Mob. Be aware this is very violent and very bloody. There is a little humor and lots of action. I loved it and thought it was a non-stop thrill ride.",1424304000,,531,4.215686274509804

He goes after a mob family, knocking off red shirted and red tied goons two at a time.  Gone are the balletic martial arts moves we enjoyed in films like Matrix.  For that matter, gone is the sleek, perfectly groomed, trim man who played Neo.

6774893,5,B00OV3VGP0,"You want violence...blood...total mayhem?  Here it is. Get your action movie flick fix here! I winced through the car chase scenes, cheered when John Wick prevailed.  In spite of the violence, this is a good film, of revenge, perhaps, but can we say the villain(s) didn't deserve it?  The charmer (and catalyst for it all) is Daisy, a beagle puppy whose screen time is all too short and all too obviously a plot ploy but nevertheless, the scenes between her and hitman-turned-loving husband Wick are heart-warming.  Willem DaFoe as another hitman and friend of Wick who's hired to stop his murderous rampage and chooses to be a hovering guardian angel instead is great in an underplayed role. John Leguziamo's chop shop owner is another small gem.

Everyone is good in this film: the bad guys are Uber-BAD, and while Wick might've not been an angel in his former life, love and a good woman  have mellowed him. He survived her loss but the subsequent violence perpetrated on him by the Russian mobster's brat who destroys her ""gift"" can only be reconciled by revenge and it was well-deserved.

6774905,5,B00OV3VGP0,"After only hearing about the premise of this movie, I was extremely skeptical to watch it.  Then, after a friend told me that I would love this movie, I decided to take his word for it.  He was 100% right.  This movie was amazing from the first sign of credits until the first sign of the end credits.  I was hooked.  It was a fairly simple premise (I won't share because I do not believe in spoiling movies) but I will say that ""They pissed off the wrong guy"".

This is EASILY the best movie with gun fights that I've ever seen.  It seemed so real, and there were even times when Keanu had to reload. I know!  Crazy right!?  The protagonist actually seems like he has to work in reloading instead of a .38 6 shooter with an endless supply?  It's unheard of!  But it's true.  There were even times that the reloading was fit in so well, that it was almost a comic relief.

Hands down this is one of the best damn movies to have come out in a long time.  Simple premise.  Simple plot.  Simply awesome.

Had to buy it after watching it, and I've watched it 3 times now. I'm secure enough in my manhood to admit that this is only the 3rd movie in my 35+ years on this planet that has brought me to tears, and the 2nd one to help give me action scenes to replace those tears with absolute joy of watching the protagonist do what they do best.",1424217600,,1338,4.124031007751938

The bar we were in seemed to go silent. I looked my friend straight in the eye and said, ""I am going to watch that movie one million times.""

6774913,1,B00OV3VGP0,"I love the movie, so this is not a review based on content.  For some reason, the studio decided to use seamless branching to try to prevent piracy (which didn't work as the movie was still leaked in MKV format before the release date).  So if you have an older Blu-ray player and are bitstreaming the 7.1 track, you're likely going to hear an audio dropout every time the branching occurs, even on more capable players like the Oppo BDP-93 (which is what I own).  Note:  This branching is not from there being an alternate version of the movie - they just branched the movie 90+ times to try to keep pirates from easily ripping it.  Unfortunately, this means if you were planning on bitstreaming the Dolby TrueHD track, especially if you have an Atmos home system, your Blu-ray player may not be able to play this disc without skipping every time a branch occurs (and they occur often enough to make it unwatchable).  The only solution is to set your Blu-ray player to decode the track internally to PCM before output to your AVR, which will eliminate the Atmos information in the track.

THIS DISC SHOULD BE RECALLED AND REISSUED.  There is no sense in them making the disc nigh unplayable for many bitstreaming Blu-ray players just to try to subvert pirates who clearly had no problem working around this.  Copy protection should never be so extreme that it makes the product unusable for the people who bought the Blu-ray.",1424217600,16,1426,4.649402390438247

6774917,5,B00OV3VGP0,"This movie was... No other word to use... AWESOME!! From the fight scenes to the stunt work all the way to the nitty gritty of utmost violence and ""realism!"" In that the ""hero"" gets wounded and beat down (cuz I just hate it when the lead character never gets a beat down as would happen in real life) pushed over the edge.. I mean he got ""out"" of the game and didn't want to get back in. And it was touching the human side of losing someone you love, with the feeling of hopelessness. And it was beautiful that his wife thought to keep him moving forward in the life that she brought to him. But then some jackholes B&E to hurt him, a ""regular"" guy, then take from him, the gift, the very last gift from his wife. This wasn't vengeance, it was a reckoning. Justice in his old life ways... It was an extremely violent movie that takes you on a rollercoaster ride of purity in John Wick's art of killing. And I felt saddened because he was forced back into his past bloody life. So when you watch this movie, really pay attention and stay focused, and you will see that his way, is truly an art form.

It's a butt whooping action-revenge flick and I've certainly seen worse.  The 3rd star is just for Reeves playing the role well.  I really like Reeves.

There's just nothing special about it, but then they weren't really aiming for that, I suppose.  Just on a pure enjoyment level, I prefer Faster, another revenge flick.  Having said all of that, the value of this film could be enhanced by making a trilogy out of it, similar to the Borne series.  In each movie Reeves would lose something precious to him, until the final movie where it becomes an all out war zone, then fading into the background for awhile before another series of films!  hehe",1424131200,,860,4.821917808219178

Now wait a minute.
This guy, the anti-hero, Wick, goes in and wastes about forty to fifty baddies...and ends up with a few scratches on his face, as well as stabbed in the side a couple of times. Not kidding.
If you're 9, 10, 11 years old...you might buy it; on the other hand, if you have actually seen what bullets can do to the human body...you won't swallow most of this.
No one, but no one: not Rambo, not John Wick, not Van Damme, not Segal, not 'The Terminator' is invincible... This is where Hollywood flicks are truly laughable.

6774954,5,B00OV3VGP0,"John Wick is in my top 5 for action movies of the past few years. Pretty much non-stop action that flows in a way that seems, thankfully, out of style in today's shaky-cam school of directing. Both elegant and brutal in it's depiction of violence, John Wick is most definitely a movie that will leave you waiting for a follow up (and one is supposedly coming).",1424044800,,360,4.46969696969697
6774955,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Typical Hollywood shoot-em-up movie that is completely out of touch with reality.  If you like action, however, this is good movie to watch to get your blood flowing.  Keanu Reeves plays a retired hit man who is dragged back into his old profession when a group of thugs steal his car and kill his beloved pet dog.  Action (shooting) scenes are full of typical Hollywood physical acrobatics perpetrated by a 'killing machine' who somehow never misses his targets.......while his adversaries constantly miss theirs.

Charles F. Stahelski directed this film - the same guy who directed the fight scenes in the Matrix.
If your looking for an over blown action/blue screen movie then this flick is not for you.

Keanu is fine as an action movie guy, but personally, I would like him to do more Romantic Leads like he did in ""Walkiing in the Clouds.""

I would just like this good actor to be hugged and kissed more and punched and stabbed less on the big screen.  He does Lovey-Dovey pretty well too , so let's not type-cast him is all I am saying.

Well, John Wick was kind of like that. Lots of gratuitious violence, but you know you'll be seeing that from the beginning. I wasn't expecting anything else. Surprisingly, I was somewhat interested in seeing some pay-back given to the villains, since their evil was so pure I wanted them to suffer. In essence, I could best describe this as the kind of movie I really don't care for, but done exceptionally well! I have to give credit where credit is due.

Point in fact for the latter, there are snippets of the dialog superimposed on the screen for effect in certain scenes - with particular words emphasized in bold face and in color. Really??

6774993,4,B00OV3VGP0,"John Wick is not a great film, but it's a surprisingly solid and fun one. The premise is simple: Keanu Reeves stars as the titular character, an ex-hit man mourning the loss of his wife (Bridget Moynahan). After she passes, he receives a gift from her: a new puppy named Daisy to help him cope with her death. He bonds with Daisy and drives his vintage Mustang and is slowly, but surely, recovering. Russian gangsters, though, steal his car and kill his puppy. Reluctantly, John Wick is reluctantly thrown back into a violent lifestyle.

This probably sounds pretty silly, and it is, but Reeves is very good in the film (as is Willem Dafoe in a supporting role), and this movie reminded me of the kind of vehicle Sylvester Stallone would make in 80s (like Cobra), only decidedly better. Its thin on substance, but the entertainment value is high. It may be something of a guilty pleasure, but I had a blast.

First-time directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch are former stuntmen and they know how to stage an action setpiece with skill; the choreography in the fight sequences is excellent. John Wick is well-paced and also has a strong, rich color palette; Jonathan Sela's cinematography dazzles. I don't want to oversell the film, because it's not a masterpiece and it does have some flaws (theres no denying the bare-bones nature of the plot), but I had a surprisingly good time with it and actually would welcome some sequels.",1423872000,,1433,4.751004016064257

6774997,3,B00OV3VGP0,"This movie was seriously lacking in a storyline, and was almost (usually laughable). In fact I think it was a comedy, and not an action/drama at all. I hung in there 1) because I like Keanu Reeves and 2) because I paid for it.

Seriously, the writers had poor imagination, and they played off Reeve's fame on the Matrix trilogy, stealing scenes even. The storyline seriously sucked. Couldn't they do better? Or was it supposed to be a comedy, I just don't know.

Tired of these 5 star reviews being so misleading. I am not even believing they are 'real' anymore, but rather paid endorsements.",1423872000,6,592,4.628571428571429
6774998,3,B00OV3VGP0,"Meh.  This film was a remake of ""Payback"", set in the milieu of ""Eastern Promises"" only more stylish.  At least, that was what it was trying to be.

What we got was a gunfu orgy with stylish sets, hot cars that would make McT drool, cardboard characters, Miami Vice lighting and Keanu Reeves in the middle of it doing his best impression of Chuck Norris...  Or maybe a block of wood...  Is there a difference?

Oh, and it had Ian McShane.  With a well-written character and an impeccable acting turn, in his three minutes of screen time he completely stole the entire film.

It seems clear that the writer's inspiration was the Continental Hotel and its denizens, and then he attempted to hang a film around it.  It's the only part of the film that isn't cardboard and phoned in.

The motivation for the main character was just sad.  The ""killed my wife"" trope wasn't enough for this script.  Neither was the ""you shot my dog"" trope.  No-oh.  The main character's wife dies slowly from an agonizing disease and as her last act, gives John a puppy with a note that the puppy will help him learn to love again.  So when the provocateur of the film kills the puppy a couple of days after the wife's funeral, not only does he kill John's dog, but his wife is killed a second time, by proxy.  Oh please.

If you want to watch the gunfu stylings of a brilliant fight choreography team, watch this film.  If you want to see a great, dark spy/action/revenge film, watch ""November Man"" instead.  Pierce Brosnan knocks that one out of the park.",1423872000,3,1534,4.472924187725631

6775006,5,B00OV3VGP0,"This is one of the best action movies I have seen in a long time. I have never felt that Keanu Reeves is a great actor. But, he has undeniable talent in terms of landing unique and memorable action roles that often reach cult status. Like Speed and The Matrix, John Wick will once again bring Reeves well-earned attention and accolades. The movie moves quickly from one action scene to the next after a brief and haunting look at the events that have led John to revive his former talents and target them at those who have caused him pain. The film relies heavily on the action sequences. The emphasis pays off because the fight scenes are flawless. They are more like art and poetry than violence. Every scene is enhanced with a perfectly paired musical score. The songs on their own are deep and heavy, but when paired with the fight choreography, they are absolutely cool together. Each scene is refreshing and unpredictable, straying far from the usual formulaic car chase or brawny beat-down (even though the story itself is formulaic). The scenes are fast but fluid and always easy to follow. This is where Keanu Reeves excels. He moves effortlessly through each scene. He is so likeable as an action hero because his confidence does not come merely from his strength nor is it cheapened by trite dialogue. He outmaneuvers and outfinesses his opponents. He is badass because he is trained, lethal and focused and he, and everyone around him knows this. We don't question if John Wick will be successful in his revenge, we are simply looking forward to seeing him exact it.",1423872000,,1578,4.721014492753623

  A retired hit man with a recently deceased wife had his car stolen. His wife had recently died and had sent him a cute little lovable pup. Slimy low life thugs wanted to buy his car and he would not sell so they came at night and killed his puppy and stole his car and brutally beat him.
  It does not seem logical for such brutality just for Keneau not selling him his car nor to attach to the puppy so quickly but the attachment was well done and the brutality gained our support for Keneau.
  Keneau got more even than need be. However, The action was great eventhough the reality was missing. He never missed and merely made the movie a super entertaining revenge movie and it was well done and really well acted by all in it.",1423785600,2,956,4.254143646408839

I really don't want to give away a single thing about this film, even though it's been publicized, but for those of you who haven't listened to the spoilers, just know, this film is worth every moment you watch.",1423785600,,646,4.487179487179487

As far as th e movie,many reviewers enjoyed it and a few did not .As far as body counts only Clint in Where Eagles Dare and The Wild Bunch would be comparable to this movie. Keanu Reeves reminded me of Liam Neason in the Taken movies. Dead set on revenge but killing a lot more people to get it. I enjoyed it and will now buy it. If you are unsure than rent it or get it from your local library to check it out. You would be surprised how many first run and very recent movies are available in the library system.",1423785600,,594,4.0423728813559325

6775027,4,B00OV3VGP0,"I'm conflicted.  John Wick is one of  the most un-original movies I have EVER seen and yet it was strangely fun to watch the brutal kick-ass-ness of it.  John Wick, ex-hitman, retired to live a normal life with the love of his life.  Then she dies.  After her funeral he receives a strange delivery.  A beagle puppy an a card from his dead wife.  He learns to love again.  Racing his '69 Mustang around, taking his newfound pup for a ride, he runs into some Russian hoodlums at a gas station,  When one of them offers to buy his car he refuses.  Later, at the bat cave, the thugs break into his home, smash Wick and the place up, gank his keys and kill, yes KILL, his puppy. stealing his car as they leave him unconscious and bleeding.  Havok ensues.  It doesn't matter that the guy who did all this is the son of the Russian crime boss Wick used to work for.  Doesn't matter at all.  Now, like I said, this movie doesn't have an original bone in its body.  The part where Wick, freshly re-indoctrinated back into the killing business smashed the floor in his pad to retrieve his weapon casche ala Bruce Willis in Red.  Predicable.  Almost alarmingly so.  Anyone who doesn't see this as regurgitated Hollywood tripe is lying hard to themselves.  It's Payback (including a gun to the face through a pillow) and so many other movies.  Revenge runs deep.  Keanu Reeves is a badass here.  The best part is he doesn't talk much.  Willem Dafoe co-stars as a fellow hitman playing both sides.  Adrianne Palicki is a female killer.  Michael Nyqvist the crime boss.  Great ensemble cast.  The action is non-stop after the initial into buildup.  I wanted to hate this movie for everything it stands for, but I found it hellaciously entertaining. Watching Wick roll through a nightclub, stalking his cocky, misguided quarry (Alfie Allen) and popping bodyguards and hired goons in the head one after another is strangely intoxicating.  The body count rises quickly.  So here's YOUR dilemma, because I already bought this movie.  Do you care that the hackneyed premise is ludicrous and overblown or do you just wanna unwind and enjoy a good blaster flick?  Make the choice.  I was entertained.  No heavy thinking here.

Lead ""Producer"" in Credits, Ms. Eva Longoria.

Keanu Reeves as John Wick is Outstanding!
'John Wick' has excellent (fighting, shooting) choreography!
No wires or cables perceived by me!
No skinny females beating up grown men, YUCH! No bows & arrows or humans with wings or other phony nonsense!

One skinny woman (Perkins) tangled with a ""friendly"" and injured, tired and sleeping John Wick and got her butt whipped! Now THAT is reality! ,,, hahaha ,,, I loved it!

Sound Track: I usually never comment on the Sound Track because I always find sound tracks over-the-top CHILDISH, INVASIVE, DEAFENING, DISTRACTING and unnecessarily MELLO-DRAMATIC BS! (all to support a lousy production).

But, the 'John Wick' Sound Track ,,, was so apropos ,,, I turned it up, way-Way-WAY UP! SCREAMING and heart-pumping LOUD!!! --- I could not get enough of the Sound Track, playing along with Keanu Reeves' totally believable performance!

This is the BEST movie I've seen in a long time! And the acting BY ALL actors was fantastic! Especially Keanu Reeves!
Keanu Reeves' performance reminded me of a Johnny Cash song in which he said (paraphrasing) ""I killed a man just to watch him die"".

1. Opening scene - alarm clock going off.
2. Coffee brewing.
3. Casket being lowered; raining for effect; long shot of cemetery showing stranger watching.
4. Afterwards, solemn wake party.
5. Mystery package at door. From? Of course.
6.  Bad guys are (Guess what nationality?) $1000 if you have no idea. And, of course, are as stereotypic as cut-out doll figures.
7. Older hot cars and lots of squealing tires, burning rubber (or synthetic equivalent). You would think Reeves character would be past that 17 year old's infatuation.
8. Master killer still has an arsenal hidden away, why? Anticipated this precise series of events unfolding many years earlier. Or, nostalgia.
9. Reeves is covered in tats, of course, to show us toughness. Russian iconic tats no less - oops!
10. Dozen (cheaper that way) bad guys need some skill training because they're slow, dumb and can't seem to shoot at a target a few feet away and always walk around corners without looking first.
11. Been done before ""cleaning crew"" just a call away to dispose of waste animal tissue (human of course). They always look the same in these movies.
12. Usual cheap scene filler, and getting really tedious, helicopter shot of city and car traveling on road below (even did a several times).
13. Background music the usual rock/blues/alter/jazz sound.
14. Barely clothed chicks tossed in for the male viewer and one to be bad.
15. Same old club scenes with strobes.
16. Usual wharf/dock driving and shooting scenes.
17. Now for the fun part and a new record surpassing the past record of 65 kills by one individual in a movie (can't remember the movie from a couple of years ago but it had that Detroit blighted semi-deserted projects, public housing/towers backdrop with this guy going through the floors shooting all the druggies).

You get the idea that John just doesn't care anymore so he might as well kill the people who killed his dog. I wouldn't say it is the most convincing plot.

6775064,2,B00OV3VGP0,"Not another movie about a car and a dog (The Rover) - and I liked The Rover better.

I like Keanu Reeves in some movies like The Matrix, Johnny Mnemonic, & 47 Ronin and I had hoped he would be well suited to this role - his forte is not verbose dialogue. Anyway, this movie was the Russian mob vs Wick. Hundreds of seasoned killers against one man - John Wick. How many pained looks, uneasy swallows and bobbing Adam's apples did I see when his name was mentioned? This one man possesses a specific skill set to wipe them all out? This is a Wick revenge flick and that's all. If you enjoy extreme bloodbaths, it's sure to please.
***Potential Spoiler Alert***
A professional killer finds succor in a relationship with a woman and retreats into his modern mansion until one day she dies & bequeaths him a puppy to help him get over his grief. He has a snazzy muscle car that the son of a Russian mobster covets (Alfie Allen a.k.a. Theon Greyjoy from Game of Thrones). Wick is harmed, his poor puppy killed, & his prized muscle car stolen ('69 Mustang Cobra) by Allen & Russian cohorts. Then Wick uses his 'unique skill set' from his previous profession to get his stolen car back. The lengths and depths Wick is willing to go over that car and deceased dog was just one too many movies in the same vein. If Willem Defoe had a larger role, perhaps the film would be better rated. Even more on camera of John Leguizamo would have helped. If all you want to see is a wide variety of guns supposedly shooting everybody in sight, and one person dodging flying bullets from everywhere, then this movie is for you.",1423612800,,1606,4.389261744966443

The most elite assassins have an honor system and make trades in the currency of golden coins. They seek refuge in old-fashioned hotels complete with underground jazz bars. The overall atmosphere the film builds for its audience is a treat in itself. Add the dark humor and some impressive fight choreography and you have John Wick. It seems there is a growing trend to make the action movies made to be relatively realistic.

It holds your attention, it has fantastic action beats and set pieces while all the time creating a great aura and mythos around the character. The cinematography and direction complement Keanu's acting style perfectly, and the story although familiar will appear fresh especially to fans of the genre that have seen hundreds of these kinds of films.

There is no nudity, just partial. Thongs, bikinis. That sort of thing (for those that need to know this before hand).

Some have compared this to the Raid. Personally I cant see this. The Raid and the Raid 2 are much more hard edged and visceral. Much more violent and in many ways even chaotic. Such is the nature of the material.
In John Wick, the action just as with the main character the action and the violence is measured and precise. He doesn't unload 1000 bullets for one kill. He is truly efficient. Calm and collected.
Please don't take this to mean sleepy, its NOT.
Its just a different kind of action movie, something to clean your pallet for bombastic movies to follow like Transformers and the like which leave you numb.

But other than this the story is wooden and lacking depth. I mean don't get me wrong, the basically modern day assassins guild and the nuance that goes with that was cool. But still didn't save the plot. I really didn't feel for John.
 This movie is similar to ""The Equalizer"" with Denzel Washington, they share many similarities, Russian Mafia, check; Aging Badass who has left his old life; check; Spouse has died, check; something bad happens that causes them to go seeking revenge, check.
This movie makes me think of back in the nineties when movie companies would have basically competing films in the same genre, Dantes Peak and Volcano, come to mind. Funny, the Matrix and Equilibrium.... I get the feeling that this is either coincidence or a similar thing is happening between these movies.
If you want to watch basically a similar movie, with better action, better acting, better characters and a better story, watch ""the Equalizer""...

One thing I like is he has feelings to animals like the small puppy (given to him after his wife died); young people killed it just for fun and then the last episode; he took a pit bull dog from the shelter where the last fight incident happened(which I like to have in the future).",1423526400,,650,4.0859375

6775097,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Keanu Reeves movies have been hit or miss for me, but I really enjoyed 47 Ronin so I thought I'd give John Wick a try.
John Wick is about a retired hit man whose wife dies and she leaves him a little dog so he has something to love.
A group of well dressed thugs takes a liking to John Wick's tricked out car and follow him home. Long story short, they beat John senseless, take his car and kill his dog.
I love dogs, so I wasn't sure I'd want to watch a movie where a dog dies. And even though you don't see the actual killing, you know how it happened, you see the weapon in the air. And, you will see the dead dog as John Wick crawls to it and cradles it in his arms. It is heart wrenching. But, it was important for the audience to know how terrible this was and to see John Wick's reaction to it or you would never buy into the rest of the movie.
Yes, the rest of the movie is about the scariest hit man around, coming out of retirement to kill dozens of people to avenge his beloved pet. And teach people that cruelty to animals sometimes has a high price to it.
This movie had some of the best choreographed fight scenes I have ever seen. They went out of their way to do cool and unique fights. There was a great deal of action, so even if you don't care about the reason he's doing it, you'll love the action.
There were a few parts in it that were predictable, but far more that was insightful and well done. They did a great job of saying what a bad ass John Wick is in super intriguing ways.
There are so many amazing actors in this and it is so well written I may actually buy this movie.
Willem DeFoe was amazing in it, as he is amazing in everything.
There were some things that happened that I did not predict and I like that when a movie thinks outside the box.
There's insightful conversation about what you would do for someone you love. And the importance of love. It's peppered in there in such a way that is seems poignant.
The end was amazing and satisfying.
I heard that the movie did so well there will be a second one and I really hope there is.
I do recommend this movie if you love action and good writing. Like I said, it's not all great, but the stuff that is makes up for it.
You have to be okay with knowing his dog dies and seeing him weep while he holds it. That was tough.
And throughout the movie people ask him if a dog is worth it, or they say ""it's just a dog"" and his answer is satisfying every single time. And that alone is worth seeing the movie!",1423526400,,2489,4.020161290322581
6775098,5,B00OV3VGP0,"To repeat the words of many others - amazing, original and even realistic with regard to certain oft neglected detail, action. Reaves and stunt performers twist, curl & undulate like Bolshoi ballet after years of training and months of rehearsal.
And thank the movie gods, a filmmaker & minions finally directed more correct & realist firearm technique. None of that same-old same-old asinine hollywood-style moving while pointing weapons at the ground, arms fully extended, swinging at full radius back and forth to target and shoot baddies while they patiently, conveniently hold fire to be heroically dispatched with single, small caliber fires. Instead, more of what trained military & law enforcement know to be true - close quarter, ready-position multiple fires required to force real-life bad guys out of the fight.
Thank you, thank you, thank you ""John Wick"" for not treating your audience like knuckleheads. Yay!

I thought this movie was quite enjoyable.  It was quick paced and visually interesting.  I gotta say though, the violence was pure video game.  The low level guys get slaughtered first and easily and the tougher leaders a bit later and w/ some difficulty.  Thru most of the violent scenes, of which there are a lot, is this repeating synth motif in the soundtrack that sounded, again, pure video game.

To me, this movie is a fleshed out 1st person shooter.  Probably the best part of this movie, is it doesn't try to be more than it is.  It's a well done, violent entertainment.",1423526400,,684,4.495934959349594

The problem is, there was really no time spent developing the relationship between the dog and Keenu. We had like two short scenes with the puppy before all the crazy went down. Just not enough sympathy built up there to justify the amount of body count and bloodshed. I mean there must be like 80 head shots and God knows how many deaths.

The bad timing is when he receives a final gift from her later: a beagle puppy and a card that is a sad reminder of pain that will never subside. Life is somewhat routine, until he takes his prized 1969 Ford Mustang out for a ride. A Russian punk wants the car, but Wick refuses. This proves to be a mistake when Wick gets an unwanted visit from the punk and his crew later. They beat him, steal the car and kill the dog (final mistake)! A chop shop owner (John Leguizamo, ""Ice Age"") immediately recognizes the car and knows who it belongs to and what trouble he is in! For Wick, it has become personal, and he is on the rampage, tearing up nearly half of New York City for revenge. An old associate (Willem Defoe, ""Batman Begins"") pretends to take a contract on Wick, but bails him out later and is killed. This is not the guy you want living next door to you!

It's extremely violent (don't show this to your kiddos for heaven's sake), but if you like action and well executed fight scenes and close quarter's combat...this is a fantastic ride.  It reminds me of good ol' action films from back in the day.

Essentially (all shown in the trailer) John Wick is a retired assassin, but after he gets some unfortunate luck and gets wronged...he takes up his suppressed H&K's and takes to getting his revenge.  That's. About. It.  Don't expect much more.  Many fantastic ""whoa whoa whoa, rewind that"" parts just to see the sequence unfold again.  It's a high body count movie (87 I think is the total...)

6775159,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Yeah, this was one of the best movies I have ever seen, especially from the action genre. Unrelentingly violent, and yet not absent mindedly so. The violence has a reason within the context of the story which is surprisingly deep and sensitive.
When the antagonists find out theat John Wick is coming, they all react in fear first, then go into self preservation mode. Not because John Wick is necessarily the best warrior out there, but more because of his singular fcus and drive, which puts him over the top of all his opponents.
A friend of mine descried the movie as watching Hotline Miami (an ultra violent video game), and I would say that comparison is apt (although as mentioned before, the violence in John Wick is the sort that we the viewer can identify with....in that, if we were in his shoes, we would probably do the same).
Really an amazing movie with a catchy setting, cool and unique ideas to add to the world lore (such as the Continental for example), and an amazing cast featuring actors from pretty much every big show or movie out there. You will be hard pressed tol NOT recognize just about everybody in the movie, and there aren't just a few characters....I think I recognized probably 50 or more of the actors, even when they had a bit, couple second role. I think this speaks to the appeal making this movie had to the people in the filmmaking scene. I also think that Keanu continues to impress. For me, it started with Constantine and Street Kings, and he has really just elevated his game from there.

This movie is a surprise gem. You have revenge plot that is simple (with the right amount of gravitas and tragedy the hero faces to pull you in) and straight, but with elements that really peak your interest. I've come to notice that a pissed off Keanu Reeves can make for a good movie (Constantine being another)
I went into this movie cold and was treated to a surprise all star cast and full tilt action. This movie pays a proper homage to the 90's John Woo action flicks, but keeps it honest in the sense  that the, hero reloads, and takes proper injury. When John get's busy, he gets busy.

There are elements in the movie that merit a sequel or even a spin off. I for one found the Continental (the hotel in the movie) to be worthy point of interest in this regard.

6775163,5,B00OV3VGP0,Simply well done.  The action is non-stop and well choreographed.,1423267200,,65,5.5
6775164,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I first saw the film, John Wick, starring Keanu Reeves, at the theater when it was originally released.  I hadnt known anything about the movie until the week before when I accidentally saw a trailer for it on television.  That sparked my interest.  When I went to see the movie, I honestly didn't know what to expect.  Since this Fall season had proven to be a great year for me and seeing movies at the theater (The Expendables 3, The November Man, A Walk Among the Tombstones, The Fury, The Judge, and The Equalizer), I suspected that John Wick might turn out to be the biggest and most badass action thriller of the year.

For me, it certainly was.

Like most of the other titles listed above, I also realized I needed to see the film a second time to see if I still felt the same about the movie.  I had discussed the film with another reviewer whose opinion is usually right on the button with movies.  He had graded it, however, a star lower than I would have, expressing a problem with the change in attitude near the end with the head of the Russian mafia in New York City, Viggo Tarasov (as played by Michael Nyqvist).

Spoiler Alert!

In other words, to live, the mobster had to be willing to turn over his son (Iosef) to John Wick.  It took watching the movie a second time for me to feel comfortable with this change in attitude and to understand why the Russian mobster did it.

As most viewers already know, the movie opens up with the death of Wicks wife (played by the lovely Bridget Moynahan as Helen) and a few flashbacks to set up why Wick loved her so much.  It worked for me.  I could certainly emphasize with man when the Russian thugs break into his house, beat him up with a baseball bat, steal his muscle car, but more importantly, kill the puppy dog that was a final gift from his wife to help him with his grieving and to give him something else to love.

Once Viggo realizes that his son (Alfie Allen plays Iosef) did these things to John Wick, he fully understands the nature of his situation and what must be done.  He knows there will be no reasoning with John Wick about this, though he does give it the old American effort.  Thats when he realizes Wick must be killed.  I mean this is the man who used to work for Viggothe man Viggo sent to kill the Boogeyman.  He knows how deadly Wick can be and so sends a dozen well-trained killers to the mans house.  Wick kills them all with either gunshots to the head or hand-to-hand combat.  No mercy is shown.  Thats the moment in the film when most viewers realize something very special is going onthat Keanu Reeves is back in full battle mode.

John Wick eventually has to take out the entire Russian mob in New York City to get to that one person who instigated it all, and he does it with such proficiency and panache that it nearly takes your breath away.

The fights scenes alone will blow you away as Wick utilizes every move he knows from throat jabs to high kicks to using his knees and elbows to block and attack, not to mention countless take-down tactics.  And these are all done with intensity and speed.  They don't look choreographed at all.  Handguns are also treated realistically with Wick having to reload his semi-automatic handguns and automatic rifles continuously as he runs out of ammunition.  He also has more than one or two handguns on him at any given time, and when he shoots a bad guy, he always ends it with a head shot.  Its usually two to the chest or stomach, and then one to the head.  This way, no one gets back up to attack him.

I loved Ms. Perkins (played by Adrianne Palicki), who is just as dangerous as Wick with small arms and hand-to-hand fighting.  Shes called in for a high price to take Wick out and very nearly succeeds.  She fights him with such skill and relish that I think he spurred her at sometime in the past.  Maybe dropping her to marry Helen, and this is her revenge.

Then, theres the other assassin, Marcus, whos brilliantly played by Willem Dafoe.  You don't quite understand his motives until the end.  This is when you grasp the fact that he sees Wick as kind of a son figure.  This is a relationship that Viggo will never have with his own flesh and blood.  Marcus is ready to die for John Wick, but Viggo does just the opposite with Iosef, which tells you something about Wick and the person hes hunting.

Theres also Ian McShane as Winston, the owner of the hotel where Wick stays.  McShane brings his character wonderfully to life by underplaying him.  It gives his actions and dialogue even more strength, especially when he confronts Ms. Perkins at the end, knowing how deadly she is.

Beautifully filmed, expertly choreographed, this film truly delivers on the action and fight scenes.  This is not a thinking mans movie, but rather one designed to bring Keanu Reeves back with full force to the fans who loved him in the Matrix trilogy.

One major thing you should know about the regular DVD.  There are no extras on it, unless you count the previews.  No commentary, no deleted scenes, and no behind-the-scenes features.  I haven't seen the Blu-ray edition yet, so I cant comment on that.  I was totally surprised since this is the type of film youd expect to have a ton of extras on it, especially with regards to the fighting sequences.  So, if you buy the regular DVD, be aware of that.

The movie itself is certainly worth the price alone.",1423267200,2,5393,4.424365482233503

6775174,5,B00OV3VGP0,"SPOILERS AHEAD

John Wick is a simple but very solid revenge flick that doesn't set out to do any more than what it intends to, it just wants to do it the best that it can. And it works. Keanu Reeves is great as the titular hero, a man suffering from the loss of his wife and merely trying to get through the difficult grieving process with the dog that she leaves behind for him as a parting gift. A punk Russian kid and his buddies decide to rob Wick of his vintage muscle car after a brief run-in at a gas station and in the process, they kill the dog. Unfortunately for the punk, he doesn't know of Wick's capabilities but his mob boss dad does. All too well. Wick had done plenty of wetwork for this kid's father and knows what's coming. And when Wick unleashes his fury, it's a sight to see. Brutal, efficient and deadly, John Wick shows his true colors as he searches for the kid to take him out.

I found that what the film does really well is showcase Keanu's talents. The guy is pretty versatile and you've gotta give him credit. He sells the emotional scenes and convinces you that he's a deft assassin with a plethora of skills handy to such a person. The movie also does a great job of establishing its world, the rules and its supporting characters. At this point they've already got a green light for the sequel. I can't wait.

This Blu Ray is very well put together. The extras are all pretty much fluff but they do a good job of covering most of the bases regarding the film's production. You get the theatrical trailer and an intimate portrait of the cast and filmmakers, all of whom are obviously excited to take part in this film. The film itself looks absolutely astounding. The picture is flawless and in terms of the audio, you get a Dolby Atmos mix which sounds phenomenal. The clarity is noticeable and the surrounds get quite a workout.

This Blu Ray presents John Wick immaculately. The extras could have been a little more in depth but what's here will suffice. If you want John Wick in pretty much the best shape you can get at the moment, you'll be more than satisfied.",1423267200,,2099,4.360613810741688

It's what I imagine would happen if Michael Mann invented/directed a Marvel Comics anti-hero film, John Woo handled the action sequences, and Trent Reznor did the soundtrack. Just awesome. The premise is basically the classic Mad Max setup: somebody kills/takes someone/something an already-notorious man loves, and he flips out on the perpetrators. What separates this from lesser such action films (think anything starring Steven Seagal) is our hero clearly isn't invincible...he takes some hits/shots/stabs and he needs some bailouts from his friends. What also separates this film is, as so many point out, how effortlessly it produces a well-established comic-like world without stopping for exposition. Everything is laid out smoothly and effortlessly. The cinematography and soundtrack are awesome...this world exudes cool. The acting is fantastic for an action flick...Keanu Reeves was the perfect choice for the title character, Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane are excellent in their roles, and all of the evil-doers are great not just in their typical bad-guy mode, but also in their knowing fear of John Wick, ""the guy you send to kill the Boogeyman"".

If that weren't the case then this could easily be a dismissible empty exercise of gratuitous mayhem instead of a reasonably inspired shoot 'em up.  Keanu Reeves channels Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name as John Wick dispatching baddies with the efficiency of a killing machine and the requisite minimum of emotion.  Let me qualify that by saying the least amount of emotion you can exhibit if you are avenging the death of a puppy your recently deceased wife gave you. Michael Nyqvist makes for a particularly delicious adversary. Good bits by Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, and Willem Dafoe.  I particularly liked Clarke Peters' droll hotel desk clerk.

I like to see movies like ""John Wick"", ""The Equalizer"", and ""Lucy"" where Keanu Reeves, Denzel Washington, and Scarlett Johansson kick some serious...

John Wick took revenge against Russian men who were responsible for stealing his car, killing his dog, breaking into his home, and beating him up. John Wick probably retired from assassinating or doing some similar activity.

My favorite part of the movie was when he went into a nightclub and constantly shot lowlife men.

I see a lot of complaints about Reeves shooting people in the head multiple times to kill them and how his gun style in the movie looks clumsy. But all of that is because people are brainwashed by movies like Rambo lol. There is a reason the saying goes ""Two in the head, You know They're dead"". As far as style goes the movie has Reeves mainly using a mixture of Jiu Jitsu combined with the newest gun technique called Center Axis Relock which while looking a bit awkward is actually far superior then anything else in close quarters.",1423008000,,933,4.520710059171598

This film has gun fights, knife fights, car chases, hand to hand combat and explosions. Most importantly is that it has a plot that makes sense. This is not a senseless killing spree, John Wick has a purpose.

Great movie....what a ride. Non stop action along with an emotional side that pulls you in. John Wick has a good reason to go on a rampage, but perhaps he took it to far. Keanu Reeves did a great job, but I didn't feel he was the best person cast for this role, I would have preferred Jason Stathem for this role, none the less, kick ass job by Keanu. Lots of great NYC shots in this movie, a part of NYC I've never seen in movies. I liked some of the extras on disc, especially learning the dual directors was their fore directing job and they came from a long history of stuntmen backgrounds, they did a great job on this movie, some kick ass stunts and action, and Keanu pulled most of it of himself. Tough actor!
One thing in the story didn't make sense,...the gold coins....cool concept but the men paid in gold coins were highly underpaid for what they were doing. Still a cool concept though. Also I had to turn on the subtitles a in one scene when they captures Marcus, to hard to hear what they were say, only a couple of gripes, over all I loved it.

6775261,2,B00OV3VGP0,"I got suckered by all the 4/5 stars. The action sequences immediately ring of John Woo; ya can't help but think, ""movie fantasy-moves"" during the fight scenes, and there are a LOT of them. 'Action' movie doesn't begin to describe this offering. I was reminded of the childhood westerns I used to watch with all the horse chases for minutes on end--pointless except to pad the time; there was a lot of that kind of action here.

Even Keanu Reeves and Micheal Nyqvist can't save this production--there's just not enough storyline, nor intriguing twists to keep one's attention. I'd give it a '1', but it did pass the time and I only looked at the clock once.",1422921600,2,656,4.6068376068376065
6775262,4,B00OV3VGP0,"There are many movies in the ""revenge"" genre, and they're usually popular entertainment.  I can't help but wonder if perhaps we don't enjoy revenge movies so much, because there is some small part in all of us that wishes we could just pick up a gun and go hunt down the people who've wronged us or ticked us off.  I think maybe it taps in to one of our darker fantasies.

So I must admit it is not without a certain gleefulness that you watch Reeves striding through the movie, taking down bad guys with almost robotic precision.

The ""revenge"" movie plot is pretty much cookie cutter from one movie to the next - Man is wronged by thugs/kidnappers/assassins who think he's an easy mark; Man is really a bad ass living the quiet life, an ex-spy/ex-con/ex-hitman; Man takes back up his guns and wrecks havoc on any and everyone who dares to get in his way; extras die by the dozens and in the end, the thug/kidnapper/assassin gets what is coming to them.

John Wick is no exception.  There are no surprises here.  But the revenge plot moves along at a good pace and they manage to make the characters interesting enough to hold your attention.  And personally, I thought Reeves did a good job.  He seems to be one of those actors that people either love or hate...but I've always enjoyed his movies.  He isn't the best actor out there...but there is something attention grabbing about him.",1422921600,,1389,4.542168674698795

6775267,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Rule of thumb: don't mess with a man's dog. Just don't.

Once upon a time, John Wick was the most feared assassin of his day. He was, as his former employer described him, the man you sent to kill the Bogeyman. Then John fell in love and retired...only for his wife to die of illness and leave him a dog. Then not long after her death, a group of men break into John's house, steal his car, and kill his dog. Turns out, the leader is the son of John's former employer. And he doesn't know the bloody mess he's just gotten himself into.

Action movies tend to either take themselves too seriously, or be so utterly ridiculous as to be laughable (and not in a good way). Every now and then, however, an action film comes along that hits all of the right notes. It manages to be both bada** and legitimately good. JOHN WICK is such a film. It's anchored by Keanu Reeves's titular performance. Reeves is everything he needs to be and nothing more; he's witty when it's called for, he's passionate and brutal when that's necessary. Michael Nyqvist, as John's nemesis, gives his best English-language performance to date. Supporting roles are fleshed out by character actors you'll know: Dean Winters, John Leguizamo, Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, David Patrick Kelly, and especially Willem Dafoe as John's questionable ""friend.""

The script, by Derek Kolstad, is solid; there are a few one-liners, but not in the cheesy way action films generally use such jokes. The humor actually stems from events, which means in spots, this is a very serious movie, while at other times it's actually quite funny. The violence and humor are both organic. This is a brutal tale about brutal people; but even brutal people crack a smile every now and then. It helps JOHN WICK stand out in its genre: an action film that people who love quality movies can actually appreciate. That said, this is still just a great, brutal revenge flick, with stylized (thought not overly extravagant) fight sequences, some awesome gunplay, a femme fatale, and an antihero who isn't hard to root for. I mean, he's avenging a puppy. Surely a few dozen Russian gangsters are a small price to pay for closure.",1422921600,2,2166,4.6947368421052635

6775269,2,B00OV3VGP0,"Keanu Reeves is as one-note and cardboard-like as ever in ""John Wick"" (nor does he showcase half the likability he did in his greatest venture from over 20 years ago: ""Speed""), the latest re-packaging of every ""pulled into one last job"" cliche in Action movie history. The laughable 'revenge on those who killed my dog' plot that propels the unremarkable bulk of the been there, done that scenes of brutality that pad the run-time do not do much to help matters (even if there is a fair enough amount of it in the film's 101 minutes to satisfy those seeking a testosterone rush). The predictable ending follows suit with the tired images on display.

Yet, there is no denying the confidence on-screen, the almost operatic, John Woo-like style of the violence and the fact that the cinematography is artistic and beautiful in spite of the content. For those seeking cinematic comfort food this may work but don't expect anything heady enough to stick to your ribs. It's a fair film that will pass through you quickly and be mostly forgotten the next day. There's just not enough originality on-screen to generate anything more than a semi-pleasant way to pass the time, a shrug when all is said and done.",1422921600,,1203,4.755980861244019

6775273,5,B00OV3VGP0,"I am a bit surprised Keanu Reeves played the lead role in this; it is extreme, and yet great, for an Action movie.  I had thought, up to now, ""300"" was the bloodiest, must violent movie ever made.  Appropriately, this deals with the Russians; the Russians being the new ""imperium"" people with a cause, destiny and ""end justifies the means"" outlook.

The story centers around the dealings of a foreign crime org in NYC.  The ""wrench"" thrown into the gears of everyday life for these criminals (riding high - I might add) is John Wick, on a revenge kick.  Anyway, he does it good and he does it IN A SUIT - James ""Rambo"" Bond, I guess!.  The storyline is Outstanding.  Never are you confused or missing any part of the story. Every subplot, etc. is explained well - at one point or another.  A lot of movies today leave out parts and minor segments which makes the movie not a complete whole.  The not-so-noticeable sideline stories are a great added feature here also; they pertain to the world view of the participating characters.  The actors were well picked for these roles.  I was actually surprised to see the ""Mayhem""  Allstate Insurance commercial guy in this ... and he did well!

Keanu Reeves can now join The Action Hall of fame along with Angelina Jolie, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Clint Eastwood, Chuck Norris, Danny Trejo, Jean-Claude Van Damme,  Mel Gibson,  Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan,  Mickey Rourke,  Nicolas Cage,  Robert Downey, Jr,  Steven Seagal,  Sylvester Stallone,  Terry Crews, and  Vin Diesel.  The younger ones will have to  ""up their game""  - so to speak - to beat this.

Note: Director Chad Stahelski said influences on John Wick included; The Good, The Bad And The Ugly (1966), Point Blank (1967), Le Cercle Rouge (1970), and The Killer (1989)

6775275,1,B00OV3VGP0,"This is not the worst film ever made. To call it that would be to make it seem exceptional in some way and that would be misleading.  Rather, ""John Wick"" is one of hundreds of pieces of Hollywood ""movie star"" pablum that fails at everything except profitability. And in the end, with Hollywood having no 'raison d'etre' OTHER than profit, I suppose it qualifies as a ""success"". But as art, ""John Wick"" is a nursing home bowel movement left overnight in a bedpan on a windowsill in ninety degree summer heat. Only maggots enjoy the ""experience"".

A hitman retires for the woman he loves. She develops some fatal illness but before dying gives our now civilized husband a beagle puppy to ease the pain of her passing. Then some very bad Russian punks beat up the hitman and kill his puppy. Why? To steal his car of course...

Thus ends ""retirement"".

The rest of the film is a simple and silly puppy revenge bloodbath where something like a hundred people try to kill our righteously indignant hero but, being very stupid hitmen, attack him one by one like the bad guys in a video game.

""John Wick"" is a waste of time and money.",1422921600,8,1127,4.504901960784314

The film has several moments of surprise and straight to the throat action scenes which was well choreographed. Much better than even the Matrix. But that is an entirely different beast.

This is a movie about vengeance and enforcing your own brand of justice. Reeve's character is two dimensional and so is the overall story.

They did so much preparation regarding the action, which, if you enjoy fight scenes, there's plenty of, that they forgot you need to actually have some ability to like person the movie is about.  The audience had too little time to learn to care about the main character before everyone and their brother was trying to kill him.  What a shame too because Keanu poured all he had into making the fight scenes believable. I can't for the life of me imagine how the storyline being so weak escaped the movie director.

6775317,4,B00OV3VGP0,"When I told my dad that I had just seen ""John Wick"", the new film starring Keanu Reeves as a mythical hitman forced out of retirement, he replied ""You still go to Keanu Reeves films?""

""John Wick"" has been receiving almost universal good praise. One magazine even ranked ""Wick"" second of all of Reeves' films after ""Speed"". So, this good word of mouth increased my interest to see the film.

And you know what? ""Wick"" is pretty darn good. Not great. Not second-only-to-""Speed"" great. But it is a fun, intense action film and proves to be the perfect vehicle for Keanu Reeves.

Yes, dad. I do still go to Keanu Reeves' films.

John Wick (Reeves) is a retired hitman living a quiet life with his wife when she is struck by illness and passes away. After he buries her, a delivery van arrives at the house with a beagle puppy, a last gift from his wife. John is naturally mourning the loss of the love of his life (he quit doing what he does best because of her), but the puppy provides him with a distraction. Filling up his classic '68 Mustang at a gas station, the car attracts the attention of Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), the son of a Russian mobster named Viggo. That night, the son and his cronies break into John's house, steal the car, kill the puppy and beat John up. When John comes to, he decides to bring his unique skill set back to use and wreak vengeance on those responsible. When Viggo (Michael Nyqvist, ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"") finds out what his son has done, he chastises his impetuous offspring - he has a long relationship with John Wick and knows what he is capable of - but he still enlists a coterie of associates and fellow assassins to take out John Wick.

Directed by Chad Stahleski (a former stuntman and body double for Keanu Reeves) and David Leitch (also a former stuntman) and written by Derek Kolstad (""The Package""), there is a lot of good stuff going on, just enough to renew your faith in Keanu as an action star. ""Wick"" seems tailor made for Reeves, highlighting the best of his skills while downplaying his shortcomings.

Keanu suffers from the same problem many action stars suffer from: he is better when he has fewer lines. His voice is too distinctive and he has great trouble hiding it in an accent, so it is best when he plays characters that speak fewer words. When he attempts a character who speaks a lot, it usually means the death knell for the film. But when he does what he does best - highly choreographed action scenes, car chases, existing on the same plane as a bunch of special effects - the film is usually a hit. ""The Matrix"" and ""Speed"" are two great examples of this. Reeves is not required to talk a lot and his characters simply execute a lot of action. In a film like ""47 Ronin"", his voice becomes a liability -  I mean, who is going to believe this California Valley dude (I know, he's not from California, but this is the common perception of the actor) is living in feudal Japan. Apparently, no one, because the film tanked.

In ""John Wick"", Reeves is given few words and it works. Wick is out for vengeance and he doesn't have a lot to say to anyone who crosses his path. And a lot of people cross his path - Viggo sends a lot of his own men after Wick and also puts out a contract, capturing the attention of many other hitmen who are eager to kill off a God in their world. He meets each obstacle, employing his skill set to take them out of commission quickly.

""Wick"" has a unique look; since John is in a bad place mentally, this seems to color the look and feel of everything we see. Everything is very dark and it almost seems like we are watching a series of paintings created to show us the gothic look and feel of John's world. It is an interesting choice and it works to make the story seem more special.

The narrative is also pleasingly efficient, keeping us involved by moving at a fast clip. When the action happens, it seems quick and efficient as well, but also memorable. Each encounter John has is different and provides a couple of moments causing you to flinch or exclaim.

At one point, John is forced to take up residence at the Continental, a hotel owned by Winston (Ian McShane) who operates it as a safe haven for all hitpeople, enforcing his rules with an iron hand. The hotel seems to be from another world, created as a retreat for Winston's unique clientele. The design seems stark, but also luxurious, and the look is dark and foreboding, and further reinforces my feelings about the painting-influenced design.

The supporting cast is mostly appealing and does a good job. Michael Nykqvist gives a fairly typical Russian bad guy a little life and makes him more interesting. As soon as he hears who his son has angered, he becomes angry as well, not at John, but at his son, angry that he has hit that hornet's nest. But his son is his son and he can't simply let someone kill his offspring, he does have an image to uphold. Adrianne Palicki (TV's ""Marvel: Agent's of Shield"", the recent reboot of The Bionic Woman) plays a female assassin who seems to welcome the challenge of taking on John. Willem Dafoe plays Marcus, another well-known assassin who seems to be giving John a pass because he is grieving for his wife. John Leguizamo has a brief,but memorable role as an auto stripper who instantly recognizes Johns car when Iosef brings it to him. And Ian McShane is just about always good. He has found a niche playing memorable supporting characters, giving just about any film he is in some added interest and depth. It's too bad that every film he is in isn't worthy of his expertise.

Lance Reddick (TV's ""Fringe"") and Clarke Peters (TV's ""Person of Interest"" and HBO's ""The Wire) have interesting and fun cameos.

In fact, the one member of the supporting cast that doesn't work is Alfie Allen, who plays Iosef, Viggo's son. If I said to you ""Russian Mobster"", there is probably a certain image that immediately pops into your mind and that image is of a crass, uneducated, loud-mouthed bully who wears shiny suits and thinks he is king of the world. This is an over-used sterotype in film and television and Allen doesn't really do anything change this image. Iosef is all of these things. Thankfully, Viggo, as played by Nyqvist, is very different and seems to be trying to make the character newer and more interesting. He sort of makes up for the shortcomings his film son displays.

""John Wick"" is a very good action film, a real surprise actually, because it almost seemed like this type of visceral, hard-pounding, intense display of suspense was gone. Now we can hope that ""The Equalizer"" and ""John Wick"" are the beginning of a renaissance in the genre.",1422403200,2,6716,4.520593080724876

Some might say ""Story? Really? Did we watch the same movie?"",  but it's all in the little details.  You learn about his past life, and the fictional reality they constructed around his profession.  The hotel and its rules, the gold coins, the car, the mob boss, the dog, the dialog with other assassins and the local PD... they all tell a great story and inform you of who John Wick was, and who he is now.

6775323,2,B00OV3VGP0,"Cudos to Keanu for all the hard work explained in the post movie where they talk about the making of the movie.  But it was not a good movie.
What these people seem to miss as do some popular writers these days is that you have to care about the characters.  The only thing in the whole movie that touched me was when they killed the dog, a dog only has to be a dog to care about him.  A person has to be more to elicit emotional response.  John Wick is just a killing machine,,, a murderer.  You have no reason to care about him except that  you like the actor.
I held off watching this because of the price(12.99)  I want at least 11.00 back.  We have to at some point reject these movies where 30 or 40 or 60 men are killed like it is nothing.  The movie is basically that this ex assassin kills scores of bad guys for killing his dog.  Even though the men he kills are not responsible for the act.  There was also a lot of bad dialogue Hackneyed and silly in the movie.  Denzel's last movie sucked,  The last Bruce Willis movie I saw sucked,  and now Keanu joins the fray.

They realized the plot wasn't something to dwell on and it transitions from background information to revenge very gracefully. I've noticed a lot of movies that try to do this but they add narration which spoils the feel of the background story. Another thing that never hits me after watching a movie for the first time is the soundtrack. The soundtrack is perfect.

But where Kill Bill is so over-the-top it's almost silly, this is more believable.  Where Equilibrium made gunplay a science, this elevates it to an art form.

John Wick doesn't have much of a plot or a meaty story like ""Oldboy"" or the comic oneliners of ""Shoot em Up"" or ""Kick Ass"" (not KA2 - ugh) but overall it's so much slicker and keeps building momentum.  The pace is perfect.

6775337,4,B00OV3VGP0,"If you can think back to all the top revenge movies of all time, which would you think of? My revenge movies consist of Unforgiven, Braveheart, Gladiator, Kill Bill series, High Plains Drifter and JOHN WICK. This movie had me hooked from beginning to end. The lighting and cinematography was amazing. I even liked Keanu Reeves in this film.

I was very pleased to see little martial arts visible with Keanu Reeves on panoramic shots. He is a tall guy so when using martial arts It makes the shot awkward when competing against someone short. This was apparent in the movie ""The Man of Tai Chi.""  The cinematographer did a great job capturing his best looks on fighting scenes. There was one scene where again he's too big for the shot and his arms were tucked in when holding a gun and charging. It looked awkward because the camera should have been backed up more.

As for the screenwriting, this was on point. A good screenplay and the actors did well to portray the characters of this movie. Some bad Russian speaking, but unless you understand and speak Russian, I guess it's not that big a deal.

While some of the big wig reviews have given this 2 1/2 and three stars. I think it deserves a bit more credit as an action movie. Yes, the movie was a little choppy in the beginning, some people argue that there wasn't enough of his married life. I think the main plot of the movie was he had another life and it was an evil one prior to him being married. You don't mess with a man's dog.",1422144000,2,1492,4.394927536231884

6775340,5,B00OV3VGP0,"This is a superb action flick.  It doesn't carry a lot of the cheesy stereotypes of generic action films like the one liners, walking away from giant explosions, excessive monologues..etc...etc.  What it does do well is take the guts of an action movie and refine them.  It doesn't do anything really new, it just takes what has been done and perfects it.

The fighting in this is like a mix of martial arts and duel wielding pistols in a way that feels more real than a lot of other movies that do the martial arts/guns combo.  He incorporates the gunplay with martial arts, but with all of the emphasis on the gunplay, and turns it into an art form that doesn't feel way to out there (not like equilibrium where it just borderlines ridiculous-but-fun).  If you want a feeling of what the fight scenes are like, think of how fluid/entertaining those flash videos are where the stick figures are fighting each other, or just look up John Wick Gun Scene on youtube.

The acting is great for what the movie is.  It doesn't require the characters to have tons of depth or dialogue.  The dialogue does just enough to push the story forward, but not too much to take away the focus of the movie.  There are no really overly dramatic parts, and the dramatic parts are kept on a short leash to keep you from rolling your eyes.  It also has some great dark and dry humor as well, and sprinkles it throughout the film sparingly but effectively to give you a good chuckle when it happens, and it never feels out of place.  Also, I think the movie does a great job of showing and not telling.  It doesn't explain the entire background of every organization/place/character he runs into like a lot of hollywood movies do in a neatly packaged story for you.  Instead, you just hear bits through dialogue that let you know there is a deeper history there, but it isn't relative to the story so you aren't going to have it spelled out for you.  This gives some certain characters a mysterious, and sometimes, surreal presentation that just adds to the character of the film.

The complaints about it not being realistic...I mean I can't really say it IS realistic in that going up against as many people as John Wick does, he probably would have been killed at some point.  But let's look at this from another angle.  The movie is pushing a character who is such an amazing hitman, that when he decides to go against the mob, the mob is actually scared s***less.  As in, ""Throw everything at him right now, I don't care how many people die just keep sending them.""  In that context, it fits the character well to be able to do the crazy s*** he does and, at least to me, it doesn't feel out of place one bit.  It definitely feels a lot more grounded than movies like ""The Transporter"" and doesn't try to do anything else other than be what it is, a revenge/rampage action fest.  Based on it's intentions and how well it executed them, I'd give this five stars.",1422144000,2,2945,4.465420560747663
6775341,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Fantastic gun play. Believable, violent action scenes. I often get taken out of the theater/movie experience by movies when they never ever reload.

By how one bullet knocks a guy 100 feet back. I could go on and on. But this movie... it was something else, it kept me in, and seriously engaged.

6775343,3,B00OV3VGP0,"`He just viciously murdered like... eighty people!?'
`Yeah. It was a really cute dog.'
`He seemed angrier about the car.'
`It was a nice car.'
'John Wick' is another rousing entry in the ever-expanding action sub-genre known as `Now... you know you done ****** up, now, don't ya?'** To get more specific, there's actually a few basic templates; there's the `Taken' scenario, where the protagonist is a former special ops bad*ss turned bodyguard to the stars, and someone kidnaps his daughter, or kills his girl. Then there's the `Red' variation, where the hero is a former secret agent badass, who has been living quietly in retirement, until someone in the agency learns of his existence, labels him an unacceptable liability who knows way too much, and gives the order to terminate with mild prejudice. The scenario that `John Wick' shares with quite a few films, including `The Professional', by Luc Besson, and David Cronenberg's `A History of Violence', is a classic. It always involves a notoriously gifted hitman who has retired, gone into hiding, or been betrayed by his employer. He might be an emotionally stunted killer who finally makes a human connection - as in `The Professional' - or a one-time gangster who disappeared and made a new life for himself, forced to return to his violent ways to protect his family - as in `A History of Violence'.

In `John Wick', Keanu Reeves plays a killer of prodigious ability who retired when he met the love of his life. When she succumbs to a sudden illness, Wick is grief-stricken. After the funeral, a posthumous delivery from his wife arrives. It's an adorable beagle puppy, and the accompanying card from the woman he just buried says she doesn't want him to forget how to love. Sniff. A ridiculously unfortunate gas-station encounter -- with the son of the Russian gangster he used to work for -- leads to a home invasion. Neither party recognizes the other, they just want his 1970 Mustang. None of this makes any sense. As the viewer later learns, his father is very rich. And yet, they orchestrate a violent armed robbery to steal a car. They take Wick for a `nobody', who would certainly report the crime, so they'll have to sell the car, which they try to do. They wear Bellaclavas to hide their faces, but the mobster's son lifts his mask to reveal himself. Then... the stupid ****s kill his love-puppy.

That sad detail is not graphic, thankfully. It probably says something terrible that I've never enjoyed watching dozens of well-dressed thugs get super-slaughtered more than I did in `John Wick'. I don't know if there's any cosmic system of weights and measures that could balance the life of one sweet little beagle with a hundred dead a*******. And I'm quite sure no judicial system would accept a dead dog and a stolen car for a triple-digit massacre. But in Hollywood, you never, EVER, mess with another man's family, his car, OR his puppy.

Keanu is back in Matrix mode, staying away from the things he does poorly - emoting, for one - and playing the kind of character he does well - blank-faced, mostly silent killing machines with an enigmatic charm that can almost be confused for intelligence. Reeves isn't smart. I've seen enough footage of him screwing up references to everything from Greek Myth to physics, with hilarious results, to accept him as a genius. He has matured, though, and he can become an inscrutable-but-likable killer as convincingly as anyone... except Ryan Gosling, in `Drive', and Terence Stamp, in `The Limey', and Mel Gibson in `Payback', and Chow Yun Fat in `The Killer', and Denzel Washington in `Man on Fire', and Clint Eastwood in `Unforgiven' (my personal favorite) AND `Gran Torino' (another example of how stealing the wrong man's car can be hazardous to your health) AND... well, Eastwood is undeniably the master when it comes to inscrutable killers out for vengeance.

`John Wick' isn't doing anything that hasn't been done countless times before, but it does it well; it gets the hook set early, and it never lets the line go slack. And of course, the `Gun Fu' choreography is fast and slick, without glossing over the violent impact of bullets striking bone. If anyone in Hollywood qualifies as a 'Gun Fu' black belt, it's Keanu Reeves; regardless what your opinion of 'The Matrix' is, few films have revolutionized the mechanics of the action genre so profoundly. The supporting cast is solid as well; Willem Dafoe is a welcome addition as one of Wick's peers, looking to collect on the open 2 million dollar contract. For action fans, this is highly recommended; if you're not, stay away, because this is all about the chrome-plated carnage.

P.S.: *For 'Leave the Puppy Alone, Part 1', check it out by it's Muslim name, 'The Drop', which it acquired after a prison-yard conversion. Happens all the time in Hollywood.

P.S.2: **In case you were wondering, it's a line from the interrogation scene in 'Menace II Society'.

P.S.3: ***Thanks Amazon! Thanks for deleting reviews without warning or notice. It's nice to know the time and modest effort reviewers expend is appreciated less than 1 whiny person's irrational complaints about already censored 'profanity'. The 11 of 11 (last time I looked) positive/helpful votes were deleted with it, and worse than that, the comments were destroyed for all eternity. Yeah, many people wouldn't care that Amazon deleted their comments without cause, but some people put thought into them. Ammy asked me to review, I did. It passed the automatic protocols without incident and was up for weeks before getting pulled. Ammy asked people to vote, and eleven people did. Ammy asked people to comment, and a couple fine people did. 15 people contributed when Ammy asked, because they assumed their input would be valued. I do; I value it greatly. But Amazon gave all of us the big 'Yuck Fou' when one complainer did their thing. Well Ammy, Tuck You Foo. Now that MY whining is done, I'll whole-heartedly agree that expecting anyone to care about this crap is silly.

Cool to see a few members from The Matrix in the cast, and if Reeves has ever played a tougher role before, in terms of being bad@$$, he certainly raised the stakes and convinced me that he can get down & dirty in an unexpected way. Yeah, I feel him on the anger of bringing harm to a animal, pet or otherwise.

And the audio was extremely low - had to crank the volume big time. I went back and watched the trailer after and it displayed normal with black bars and normal audio.

He is a man with the will to persevere and need to punish those who have done wrong.

The only flaw this movie has, besides the simple story, is that there is a big name WWE wrestler in this movie who is used to get us all hyped up about a fight--then he does nothing.  And Wick does nothing to him.  LOL.  It makes sense, but I don't have to like it.  They missed out on a spectacular hand-to-hand sequence there!!!

Wick kills so many Russian mobsters that I think the population of Russia itself halved.  The supporting cast are excellent.  Keanu is his stiff but believable self on the dialogue front.

It's the kind of movie that haunts you and stays with you long after the final credits have rolled. Great action, very captivating story, music that rivals that of the Matrix, superb acting by Keanu Reeves and Michael Lindqvist, all the backgrounds, places, and the coloring of the movie itself. The movie direction is sophisticated, detailed, and masterfully done.
However. In the wake of all the public shootings the US has seen in the past few years, I couldn't help but wonder what kind of effect movies like this would produce, because it is, in fact, an account of a killing rampage. Vendetta killing, yes, but a mass shooting/killing nonetheless.

6775382,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Oh dear. So here we go.
I've always enjoyed Keanu Reeves even with his stone faced acting. His movements are always clear and fluid and he knows what movies he will be good in. With that I can't say I hated the movie because I actually really really liked it. If you can suspend your need for a plot that makes sense in reality. Yes I get he loved his wife. And yes the spoiled brat kills his dog (her last present to him after she died). But thats all the background we get.
We are told he is a badass, (which is defiantly proven), and that he will stop at nothing (once again...... shown very clearly.)  The rest of the movie is spectacular shots of him kicking ass.  Now that said I still enjoyed it but I would have liked more meat to sink my teeth into. Just a bit more for my heart to break with him when his dog it hurt. To fear him when he goes on his rampage. To root for him past just liking the good guy to win.

In the end if  you NEED a movie that has meat and bones AND good action, this movie might stress you out more than relax you. But if you are looking for a light movie with a lot of kickass gun fights then sit down and give John Wick a chance.

The Plots are somewhat the same but I thought John Wick was a bit more original. it knew when to be funny and when to be serious and most important The action was very impressive looking. John Wick's Gung Fu, judo, and jujuitsu style delivers an ass whoopin, and just the right amount which didn't feel like an eternity to get there because it didn't take long the intro and the whole gist of who John Wick was, was pretty simple and straight to the point. When comparing the two in The equalizer I found myself bored and wondering when this movie was going to finish, the characters in my opinion didn't fit well together specifically the victims, the movie dragged a lot. Where as John Wick you felt his pain because of his connection and his past and the pacing was good it didn't drag at all and some parts made me laugh.

This movie is horrible!

I wanted to like it. I like Keanu. And the movie almost ropes you in with the puppy/gift scene. However, it all goes down hill from that point on. The plot is paper thin, and the action scenes are weak (the punching/fighting looks fake). I purchased this movie (the Amazon Instant video version) because it received good ratings both here (Amazon) and on Rotten Tomato. I don't get it?

If you want to watch a movie about a tough guy killing a lot of Russian mobsters, I would recommend ""The Equalizer"". The plots are very similar. But at least Denzel's Robert McCall is a protagonist worth cheering for.",1421539200,8,745,4.423357664233577

I'm looking forward to watching it again to see if I missed anything on the first viewing. Maybe I shouldn't have expected anything more than a solid, vibrant, well-acted action movie (which it really is). If you're a big Keanu fan, I say you must see it.

Assassins can love, assassins have feelings, assassins know how to separate the job from home life, and when they don't want that interrupted I'd leave them alone. I noticed John Wick doesn't kill mindlessly, he has a purpose and if you play it straight with him there's no reason to harm. In the case of the idiocy of the thugs, timing is so important not that it would have changed the outcome but the moral here: Vanity can be a killer. A side note about the assassin's code, I like the way they do things, especially that they clean up their messes. I'm half Italian - we take housework seriously.

  There were a host of excellent actors in this film, but Keanu Reeves was running the show. He has a presence, something that is usually attributed to women but his persona is right there. The ending was his signature. Loved it!",1421539200,,989,4.364130434782608
6775406,2,B00OV3VGP0,"Keanu seems like a nice guy. His samurai movie flopped, but, foreign films aren't always bankable. However, this. SPOILERS. First off, if you buy from Amazon it seems like standard definition for the first ten minutes was potato quality clarity. Then, ahem. The story. Y'know, some of the characters in here smoke pot. It seriously makes me wonder if the screenwriters do, too. The movie follows a trend I've noticed recently- the style of the movie is often nuanced, knowing, very chill, very cool. Everyone knows what's happening- the character's in a flashback, the character's experiencing an emotion, the character is seeking revenge. No words are spoken, the cinephilic audience is hip. No words need be used. However, this technique often works best when there is a strong, cogent story. The plot device? A trio of random thugs randomly target the hero and randomly enter his house to steal his car and kill his dog. Only after the event does the reveal set the tone for the story, in a scene with the crime boss father of the thieves. ""who's car did you steal?"" ""Nobody?"" Who's car?"" Wick. His name was Wick."" YOu don't know who you're messing with."" C'mon, does that line of dialogue sound as if it might have been cooked up in a late night pot session or what? Yeah, it's got nightclub scenes choreographed with ultraviolence, so if that gets you happy, well there's that. Plus, it's got Theon Greyjoy.

It's just too simple in too many spots.

John is the ""good"" assassin that loses his wife, then some jerks steal his car and kill the dog that was her parting gift and that sets him off.  So...you have him as the super-assassin mowing down countless bad guys and the very James Bond-like part where he gets captured and instead of just putting him in a giant blender or running him over with a tank or putting a grenade in his mouth or a plain old shot to the head, the leave him tied up with just a couple of flunky bad guys where he *surprisingly* escapes and continues on until he kills pretty much everyone.

It even made us wonder why Willem Defoe would even waste his considerable reputation here. The only decent 30 second scene is that 1968 Chevy 396 SS Chevelle.

6775435,4,B00OV3VGP0,"I think by this time, you'll have read enough reviews to know you're either going to watch this movie, or you're not. So, spoilers incoming.

The world (or underworld) where John Wick exists in is setup in a very subtle way, which I liked. You've got this hotel ""Continental"", which is a refuge, a ""neutral zone"", if you will, of different factions of crime syndicates. It is managed by ""Management"", and there's no details on who or what exactly ""Management"" is, but I think of it as a United Nations kind of thing setup by these different factions. At any rate, John Wick had retired, and there are still professionals he knows that he encounters that help him out on his war path of vengeance, out of respect for him. Which gives this huge backstory, without having to tell the story of the backstory. The gold coins as payment within this underworld is also a nice touch.

The fighting is a nice fresh mix of incorporating martial arts with close combat handguns. There's also a cool scene with using a car in much the same way. You get some realism with some of the Jiu Jitsu and Judo moves, as not all moves are executed cleanly - because real fighting is messy. I think it could have been a little better, like showing more of the tactical decisions during combat, having some of the fighters being able to counter John Wick's moves, while he counters their counter, would have been nice to see. Though you do see a moment where Kirill (Daniel Bernhardt, who looks like a younger, badass version of Hugh Laurie) gets John Wick with a ""Teep"" (a Muay Thai Front Push Kick) while both of them are getting up. When John gets knocked down again, as he's getting up, Kirill does it again, but John's ready for it, and blocks it. I like that kind of fight sequence.

It's a solid action movie, with the exception of a few gripes:

The part of the trailer where John goes, ""People keep asking if I'm back... yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back."" was an iconic moment in the movie trailer. However, in the movie, it's a ruined moment. They should have kept it that way, instead of, ""People keep asking if I'm back, and I haven't really had an answer, but now, yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back. So you can either hand over your son, or you can die screaming aside him!"" They also pulled back the camera distance from when he said that in the trailer, as well. A perfect line ruined. Effect dampened. What a shame.

Other parts, if you're paying attention, is that the action scenes where he's executing his moves, the people he's fighting just stand, sit, or lie still until he gets to them to shoot them in the head. I don't like fighting scenes where the enemy is just waiting around to get killed. It could have made the film even better if people were fighting back more.

As a professional hit man, he really doesn't plan his infiltration's very well. John Wick's approach seems to be just going in with guns blazing, relying on his fighting and shooting skills, rather than any tactical considerations. It's one side of John Wick I would have liked to have seen.

Also, classic dumb bad guy monologuing cliche. Don't let your henchmen try and kill the boogeyman by putting a plastic bag over his head while you leave. Just shoot him in the head. John Wick being captured is the worst part of the movie, and sets up his potential iconic ""Yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back."" moment to a failure.

I can't give half stars, but I rate it closer to 3 and a half stars, than a full 4 stars. It is still a fun movie, but if the movie is trying to do something different (which it does in some areas), then stop with the cliche's.",1421280000,,3606,4.444780635400908

But it's actually really good!
For one thing, the action sequences are well made and a pure joy to watch (if you're into non-stop slaughter).

But even more importantly, this movie knows what it is. It knows that it doesn't have a greater message, and is totally comfortable with that. Comfortable enough that it makes fun of itself for how silly it's being (like in the scene towards the end in the warehouse), while still working very hard at the things it does well.
I have to say, I respect that. It makes the whole experience switch from eye-rolling to excited giggling  =)

You've Got to be Kidding!

Wick is one of the clumsiest ""Legendary Assassins"" I've ever seen.

One moment, great fight scenes, the next, the fight choreographer was clearly out to lunch and we have a schoolyard brawl.

Wick's tactics are..... well..... blunder in and shoot up the place.
Later he changes tactics to..... well..... blunder in and shoot up the place.
(The sniper rifle he has in his kit is clearly decorative.)

His dog barks and runs downstairs in the middle of the night.
Being a legendary assassin.... well..... he blunders after it and doesn't notice the Three thugs standing there at the bottom of the stairs until they knock him cold.
(Apparently assassins save money on alarm systems.... because..... you know..... cat-like reflexes.... except, of course, when
they're chasing dogs..... but how often does That happen?)

And the assassin's club.... where assassins mingle (including ones with whopping big bounties on their heads).

And why doesn't either side just ""take the shot"" and end the drama when they can Easily finish the job? (Aside from the movie run time issue.) - With a little assassin-like discipline, each side could have killed the other (quite easily) if they could only get over those assassin jitters (or learn to use a rifle like .... a rifle and not a fire hose) and Take The Shot!

This was written by a teenager.

Too bad so many great names were pulled into it.
With a mediocre writer, this could have been good at worst.

As it was.... made my face hurt from all the cringing.
I have a red blotch on my forehead where I kept slapping it.
It was painful on so many levels.

Big disappointment given the high production values and marvelous cast.

It's a pretty straightforward film - John Wick was once the guy you sent in to get the guy, and has now retired. A group of no-good hoodlums kill his dog, and he wants revenge. Keanu then sets about getting his revenge, and the action never stops. One of the best things about this film is that John Wick is no invincible superhero - it's just all guns, guts and determination.

6775443,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Head shots! So many head shots!!!

I knew this movie would be good. Well, I was hoping because everyone was saying this film is the return of Keanu Reeves. Oh, yes it is, and Reeves makes his comeback by kicking a door in and shooting up the place. It's the best way to go about making a comeback.

Reeves plays John Wick, a retired assassin who left the game for the love of a woman. A woman who, when the film starts, has just died of an illness she'd been struggling against. In an unbelievable poignant scene, Wick gets a puppy to help him grieve. On his first day out with the pup some Russians make it clear they want his car but he refuses and it all results in an unconcious Wick and an unfortunate end for his puppy. From there the name of the game is REVENGE. A especially bloody form of revenge.

This movie had my heart pumping while it sated my bloodlust. First, John Wick loves him a head shot and they come fast and furious once John gets back into the assassin game. Wick was not only an assassin, he was the best assassin. He was the person you called to kill the boogeyman as they say in the movie. So, we're invited into this underworld of murder for pay where there are cleaning crews, gold coins, and a hotel that caters especially to assassins and criminals but that has rules about conducting business on the premises. It's fabulous.

There's this great, and hilarious, comic book feel to John Wick's world but it never crosses the line into cheesy. Everything is very expensive like a finely tailored suit. As a matter of fact, almost all of the assassins are impeccably dressed while they trade gold coins for death and cleanup services.. The actors are all exceptional at not taking the parts too seriously but playing towards the intensity while still having fun.

Basically, I loved this film. I hope there's a sequal because there's definitely room for one. If there's never another John Wick movie though, I'll be content with this one because it is that good.",1421193600,,1990,4.486187845303867
6775444,1,B00OV3VGP0,"John Wick is an action flick for millennials who grew up on a diet of Call of Duty and Marvel movies. It's like that, sans that pesky ""plot"" stuff. Remove all semblance of coherent character development, leave all the running and gunning and you've got John Wick. It's actually less fun than it sounds. It's like a shooter video game with silly cut-scenes; except you're stuck watching the cut-scenes. My fingers where twitching, waiting for gameplay to start. This is like a movie based on a videogame based on a B movie. Actually, worse than Resident Evil Apocalypse based on Biohazard based on Return of the Living Dead. This isn't like watching 1995 Mortal Kombat ""so bad it's good"", it's like watching an Uwe Bol flick, it's just bad-bad. An action movie without a proper plot is like a shinny sports car without an engine.

I avoid watching a movie without first scrutinizing the people involved. I should have known better, I was tricked by my inner Keanu fan. You know how sometimes you watch a movie so bad you feel like punching something? I wrote my first review. This nearly plot-less drivel was written by stunt actors. I didn't know stunt actors could write and direct. The answer is they cannot, apparently. if you want stylish gun action, watch Equilibrium.

6775467,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Most people I know all are fans of The Matrix and a selective few movies that Keanu Reeves has done. But I think we can agree that movies like 47 Ronin are not some of Keanu's better movies. So naturally I was not expecting big things with the movie John Wick. Not until I began seeing reviews and hearing surprisingly good things about the movie. And so finally, I got around to seeing John Wick and I will say this:  this movie is really GOOD!
John Wick has gone through quite an ordeal, having just lost his wife. But something good comes out of his loss, after one day receiving an adorable dog. After politely turning down an offer for his car to a guy who apparently does not like being told no, the guy decides to break into John's house with a couple of goons who (as it seems) have nothing better to do. In the aftermath, they will learn why messing with John Wick was a VERY bad move.
John Wick as a movie has so much good going for it. And I read how Keanu Reeves trained Japanese and Brazilian jiu-jitsu which I respect a lot. And as for his take on the character, I think he does really well  in the titular role. He is not an especially suave type of character, but he IS a relentless loose cannon when wronged. And even though he takes a few hits, believe me when I say he can definitely throw down with the best of them. Willem Dafoe stars as the character Marcus and does a good job, Adrienne Palicki takes an evil turn in her role as Ms. Perkins and she does not mess around. Alfie Allen (who plays Theon my fellow Game of Thrones fans) stars as bad guy Iosef and does good at making his character unlikable. And Michael Nyqvistst portrays his evil father Viggo and does a good job.
If there is one thing I want to see when it comes to action movies, that is good action sequences. And the fight scenes in John Wick manage to have a good amount of force to them. But what John Wick manages to do even better is have a focused pace, in terms of storyline.
I am glad that this movie turned out as good as it did; though one can only wonder if there will be a sequel. Nonetheless, John Wick is a high octane action movie that I say give a watch and I sincerely believe you will enjoy it.

6775468,4,B00OV3VGP0,"This film is the very definition of lean and mean. After a very patient and heartfelt opening sets up the characters and motivations, the back half of the movie is relentless death and destruction. The introductory scenes are quite beautiful and tender, making one wonder if the film is even an R-rated action film and not a pleasant indie drama. But once ""The Boogeyman"" is awakened, the eponymous hero John Wick is practically a superhero in his ability to easily slaughter dozens of armed foes with guns, fists or his infinite wealth.

Featuring unexpected but welcome bursts of comedy as well, the movie is surprisingly effective in taking the viewer on a relatively intimate and involved journey with its antiherohero, even though the film is a bloody and pulpy revenge thriller. The boring title doesn't convey the absurdity of Keanu's superstar badass, but the actor really strives to cement his status as a bonafide martial-arts legend. His fighting repertoire now showcases a variety of innovative MMA moves, jiu-jitsu grapples and kickboxing strikes.

While the fighting is generally quite enjoyable and often gory, the battles sometimes feel a little stale in their execution. Likewise, the story becomes a little flat, and the characterization is uneven and inconsistent.

But in the end, ""John Wick"" is a superior action film, especially to those who enjoy classic, no-frills action of gunfights, fistfights and car chases. This is an old-school action film that favors traditional stunts and practical effects over unrealistic CGI.",1419552000,,1545,5.246963562753036

That said, I loved this movie.  I like Keanu Reeves, and I opted to give him a chance. My girlfriend and I thought it would be a movie that upon coming out we'd regret not having just BTed it, but we were greatly disappointed that we were wrong...although I guess that was more of surprised.  The notion of the wife giving the puppy as a service once she died, may seem far-fetched, but at least much more believable than in PS I Love You.  The man left a life of action, drugs, money, action, to live a quiet, yet happily peaceful life. So when you are devastated at the loss of your wife, you will find great solace in a puppy, especially if it was her gift, even if for 2 days.  Not just that but he was a dam waiting to overflow, held back by the bubblegum and bailing wire that was his wife and then the puppy. She knew he would snap, so she gave him something to snap him back.  This is why the ending leaves it that he is probably back in the game. Then again, he knows that and thus why he gets another puppy, to wrangle him in.",1418688000,2,1455,4.087719298245614

6775477,5,B00OV3VGP0,"John Wick, starring Keanu Reeves is about a lone hitman who seeks vengeance for crimes committed against him and his personal attachments, which in the hitman business, one should detach from so no leverage can be held against him in a tight situation as they say. In the film, John Wick is hailed as a legend, feared and respected by most of his cohorts in the Russian Organization. If they hear he's on the way, they either run, or arm themselves heavily for the tsunami that is about to strike.
Keanu does most of his own stunts here, and the stylized expertise with which he performs his gun kata and martial arts is impressive. Rarely does he make a mistake, and when he does, he's prepared for the consequences most times, resulting in a hero who doesn't disappoint; a guy who knows what he's doing. That is a hero to root for.

Tons of slick, intense action throughout this great action film highlighted by a great sound track in sync with the onscreen action. John Wick is a blast for any big action fan, though the film is admittedly light on story motivation. Revenge is understood, but for the audience, it doesn't always hold the emotional impact or conviction of accomplishing this ultimate task to take down the Mob, as it would resonate had it been Mr. Wick attempting to save someone still alive, or a higher motivation like freeing the city of this sinister organization altogether. In the end, John Wick is still a lot of fun to watch, and ultimately, that is what most action fans pay for in the first place.

End spoiler), the kid and his friends head over to Wick's house to pull off a prank. Well, boys will be boys and all, you know how it is, some things just got out of hand. Someone accidentally got hit while they were swinging at stuff in the dark, and somehow a poor puppy got hurt, which no one wanted! Things happen. So, turns out this Wick guy was some kind hit man back in the day and he takes things waaaaaay over the top; totally not a bro move.

Keanu Reeves plays the titular character, a widower who seeks vengeance against the Russian mobsters that have stolen his car and killed his poor sweet dog.

What did I think?

Behold: a pulpy retribution flick that puts THE EQUALIZER to shame. This goes through similar story beats to Denzel Washingtons killing spree, but with a fun and refreshing simplicity. A cool neon glow pulsates all throughout its visuals, and the music occasionally makes odd choices that turns the blood-soaked battles into a hypnotic ballet. Through it all, Reeves spits fire as a guy who recognises but cant help his own barbarism, and hes backed by a terrific supporting cast that includes Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo.

 Vigo, the Russian Mafia boss sums up John Wicks nature when he tells his henchman In a bar I once saw him kill three men-with a pencil.  That just about covers the build up of the Wick character.  He kills with single minded ferocity but we have no idea why he decided to go on a massive killing spree.  Sure, when a bad guy steals his prized car and kills his dog, it angers him.  But killing 78 bad guys in various ways seems excessive.  Maybe professional hit men get PTSD.
 But Keanu Reeves pulls it off.  Any film with a 119 body count has the danger of becoming, wittingly or not, a parody of itself.  John Wick just skirts that danger.  At all times, we sympathize with the perhaps deranged killer and hope he will avoid, escape or at least survive his plight.  The rest of the script mostly provides bad guys to be killed and different and gradually more sever injuries for John himself to contend with.  No real life crime lord could have so many functionaries willing to die or could afford to lose so many.  We have great fun though to see the athletic Reeves do his thing.
 And Reeves has a bunch of excellent actors backing him up.  In spite of the carnage this is a serious movie with serious actors doing good work.

him after Game of Thrones) kills Wick's (Keanu Reeves) dog (a present from his dead
wife) and steals his muscle car. And that is a NO NO.
Thus, Wick goes about getting his revenge

This is a fast paced action movie, a little dark, with a lot of killing.
There are quite a few fighting scenes where martial arts are
mixed with gun shooting in a satisfying form of combat. Action movie
fans will love that. Add to that the excellent club music by Le Castle Vania
and movie fighting has become really ""entertaining.""

This is not a complex movie with great acting (that is why Williem Dafoe stands

6775494,5,B00OV3VGP0,"If you like action flicks, you won't do better than seeing John Wick. Its the best action movie Ive seen since 2011s Haywire, starring womens martial arts contended Gina Carano. And like that movie, the lead in this one, 50-yearold Keanu Reeves, an accomplished martial artist on his own, does his own tricks. You can tell the difference almost at once, Instead of jiggly hand held camera sequences, in this movie as in Haywire, the camera holds back and catches the details. The result is a level of reality that just doesnt happen in most movies in this genre because most action stars cant do this stuff, or at least cant any more. Instead, fuzzy focus and quick cuts hide their deficiencies.

Keanu Reeves has many deficiencies as an actor. Watching him try to evoke sadness in the scenes in this movie where he laments his wife's premature death are basically throwaways.  But in other respects, his emotional passivity, the blankness of his visage, contributes to the effectiveness of his film persona in this case, and it certainly adds to the fight scenes, of which there are many, in almost nonstop flowing action. Because you cant get inside of him, you have to look at him from the outside only.

What you see is the wrong man to p*ss off and that's what the son of the local gang boss, a Russian, has done by breaking into his house, beating him senseless, killing his dog (his wifes last gift to him), and stealing his vintage car. John goes after him. And he's  a killing machine. Before he left to get married, he was a hired killer for the mob, so ferocious he was known as the boogieman, or as mob boss Viggo says it: He's the one you sent to kill the boogieman. (Paraphrase from memory.) When Viggo learns that John is after his son, he sends one after another assassin after him. In one scene alone, John wipes out twelve who foolishly enter his house at nighttime. The fight scenes are fast, furious, awesome, well choreographed . They stretch the bounds of credibility but don't pass them, and Reeves performs so well in them that you really don't care if one man could do all this or not. Youre too busy rooting for him.

Not only is the movie well filmed, slick and crisp, but its extraordinarily well cast. Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist (he starred in the Scandinavian version of the Stigg Larsen trilogy) plays Viggo. John Leguizano is a chop shop owner, Willem Dafoe a fellow assassin, and Ian McShane the proprietor of an unusual hotel that shelters only hardened criminals. If you're a movie nut, youll also recognize Lance Redick, Dean Winters and Adrienne Palicki.

6775495,4,B00OV3VGP0,"I like Keanu Reeves well enough but I'm not going to see a movie merely because he's in it. ""John Wick"" received some positive reviews so I thought I'd check it out. I'm very glad I did.

Here's the scoop. Reeves plays Wick who is a retired, top notch, hit man in a very upper up community of criminals. His wife has recently passed away due to an illness but left him with a puppy. The son of a Russian gangster invades Wick's house to steal his prize '70 Mustang, beats him up and kills the puppy. Problem is, he doesn't know who Wick is and that Wick once worked for this little puke's father. This was a really bad idea and Wick is now out of retirement with revenge being his top priority.

There is a lot that works here and very little that doesn't. As a revenge flick you know pretty much what needs to happen so it becomes an exercise in technique. This has technique to the 9s. These are possibly the best fight/shootout scenes I've ever seen. They're choreographed extremely well. The dialogue is nifty to boot. It almost seemed an exercise in how much could be conveyed with as few words as possible. I also enjoyed the depiction of this criminal community. They all know each other and live by a code. A scene where the police come to Wick's door right after he's killed a dozen would-be assassins is priceless and underscores how the community operates. There is a mild comic book quality to that that still managed to suspend my disbelief. But when they introduce the female hit person, Ms. Perkins, that put it too firmly in comic book land and it stuck out like a sore thumb.

All that being said this is one wild ride. As far as revenge/action flicks are concerned this is going to satisfy most fans. It's got high grade production values, a great cast and better than decent writing. If these kinds of films are your poison you'll have feast here.",1415491200,,1866,4.4186046511627906
6775496,5,B00OV3VGP0,"John Wick (Keanu Reeves) the other super crime fighter from New Jersey, the one without a mop, retired from being a hitman for the Russian mafia. When the undisciplined son (Alfie Allen) of the mafia steals John Wick's car and kills his puppy, this sets off Wick for some over-the-top revenge that includes the entire Russian mafia in New Jersey.

The film is action driven with moments of humor and dark humor, some unintentional. For instance, the mere mention of Wick's name makes men tremble, reminding me of the South Park Keanu Reeves running gag. Personally I would have loved it if they just left the name at Keanu Reeves. Yes, he once killed three men at a bar with a pencil, again a running story/gag in hitman films. John Wick is not the boogie man but ""the man you hire to kill the boogie man.""

There were some ""safe zones"" in New Jersey, places where mafia people can't kill each other. This was a bit weird and awkward as was the soundtrack during the first major fight which was like listening to someone trying to play metal grindhouse with drums which stutter start and stop. It worked better in subsequent scenes, but not the first one. It was also odd that someone could get the drop on John which started this whole thing off, and that John would sleep with his curtains open, after all he did kill three men with a pencil. Imagine if he had a ballpoint.

For those who like over-the-top action films with the improbable and impossible, plus some humor, this is it.

For a second there I thought I was back in the 80's - Violence, Action, Revenge, Body count, wow
Keanu is definitely back in this brooding revenge flick, that is fast paced, very violent and formulaic, but nonetheless a darn good watch, and satisfying to the end.
I won't give anything you won't have seen in the trailers, but will say you won't be disappointed if you like this kind of movie.

John Wick is a quiet man, recently grieving the loss of his young wife to some unknown illness, however, he also has a more than shady past that is about to catch up with him. I could sense some similarities here at first with the recently released (and equally entertaining) Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington. However, whereas that story although violent had a sense of morality to it, this is plain old revenge, served cold.......and bloody.
In the grand style of Seagal, Norris, Arnie and even Bruce our eponymous star goes on the rampage after someone steals his car, and kills his dog ( a dying gift from his wife)
It's at this point in the movie you know you're going to be in for a treat. When you hear characters say things like ""It's not what you did, but who you did it to"" and then the collective sphincter tightening in the room is almost audible at the mere mention of his name.
Keanu is believable, cold, calculating and brutal, almost killing with impunity.
The fight scenes, chase scenes and action are well choreographed and electric.
Timing at just over the 90 minute mark is about right, and even though you will probably figure out the end, and know what's coming it's still worth seeing.

A Russian mobster's son makes the mistake of killing his dog and stealing his car, unleashing John Wick to do his best imitation of the Terminator.  What follows is a sequence of stylishly-staged and extremely violent action scenes, as Wick returns to the business with a vengeance.

The movie is a quick hour and forty-four minutes, and there is a surprising amount of breathless suspense.  Wick manages to be a sympathetic character as a man following a personal code.  It isn't clear who Wick can count on among his former associates, some of whom are trying to execute a contract on his life.  Nor is it clear who will survive the violence.

6775510,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Nine Things About the Movie ""John Wick"" (USA, 2014)

1. This is probably the best action movie of 2014. It's certainly the movie with the highest body count of 2014.

2. It's directed by two guys who, before they made this movie together, were mostly stunt coordinators and stunt doubles for people like Brad Pitt, Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Keanu Reeves.

3. Speaking of Keanu Reeves, he's great in this. You see, there is a very specific type of movie in which Keanu excels - action flicks where he moves around a lot and hardly talks. This had to be his dream role.

4. Reeves plays John Wick, a depressed nobody dealing with the loss of his wife. When a few things go wrong, we find out that John isn't exactly a nobody. In fact, he has quite a reputation as an assassin for the Russian mafia.

5. What's fascinating about this film is that this is no street-level gang war stuff. These are all super rich, civilized professionals that move in their own exclusive circles. There are codes to be honored, and rules to be followed.

6. There are some truly great action sequences in the movie. These scenes were clearly inspired by John Woo's Chinese gun-fu classics like ""The Killer"" and ""Hard Boiled"".

7. The movie has a sleazy, industrial rock soundtrack which is a great counterpoint to the opulent, cultured environment that the characters live in.

8. Of course, being firmly in the action genre, it also follows those conventions, like bad guys that line up to take on the good guy one by one. And villains that like to tie the good guy up in a chair and give a speech, instead of just killing him. But people do run out of bullets sometimes, so that's a refreshing change.

9. The movie has a wry sense of humor, letting us know that it knows what it is. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and doesn't try to be anything other than a revenge flick that kicks ass. If that's what you're looking for, then you just found it.",1414800000,653,1936,4.4772727272727275
6775511,5,B00OV3VGP0,"The movie was one Kick-Ass movie, I recommend it to everyone!  (SPOILER ALERT)

The special effects were off the chart (still had to close my eyes for a fair amount of the head shots).  On top of that, the wrestling maneuvers and the focused shots were a thing of beauty - EXCELLENT choreography.  Damn it Keanu you just keep getting better and better.  Lolol

Watching the Mustang fly was just beautiful - I pray he got to keep her - WOW!  Beautiful '69.  The SS Camero, isn't my favorite by a long shot - clunky tanks, but if you got to go out on manhunt maneuvers, you might as well as have one of the toughest, civilian tanks with you - especially if it had the positraction. :)  The last car, a gift from the hotel, was a blank slate - both in it's lack of detail, and my knowledge of new cars.  Fortunately, I saw one on the way home and it ended up being a Dodge Challenger.  Blew me away and it was a real crime to see it get pushed over the side of the dock.  The car was just a thing of beauty.

The plot was unassuming, romantic and sentimental and perfectly in line with the main character - an assassin who bought his way out of a nightmare s***ty world into of normalcy for the ultimate Meaning of Life - Love.  If you spent most of your life with your emotions completely cut off, what would you do to keep that emotional connection alive?  Cut out the maggot promoters of that worthless life, and regain the emotional connection that helps you live?  ""Hell, Yeah.""

In this case, a gang of old-school Russian pigs, not unlike some I've met in the past, but thankfully rarely exists today.  Since the John Wick story is a case of self-protection and a commitment to family emotional ties, it fit perfectly with my Texan philosophy.  A woman would do well to have such a man as the John Wick character to protect the one gift she gave him - Love.  Having had my Wolf-brother killed by a Russian, I can see the character's point quite well.  The death of the long-haired vixen and the manhunt of the sniveling ruski, was just icing on the cake.  Bottom-feeders, self-promoters and stealers of lives - well, enough said.

Get out there and see this movie.  You will love it ! ! !",1414713600,3,2191,4.300733496332518
6775512,4,B00OV3VGP0,"I just got back from the theater after viewing John Wick, and let me tell you, it was awesome! I didn't give it 5 stars because I felt it could of had a better ending, but other than that, it was fantastic. This is where Keanu Reeves is at his best: shooting guns, dropping clever one-liners, and killing bad guys.

So basically the movie is about John Wick (Keanu Reeves) wanting to get revenge on the punks who stole his car and killed the puppy that was a last gift from his recently deceased wife. It just so happens that one of the punks, Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), is the son of his former boss, Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), so now Viggo must try to find a way to stop John from killing his son before he gets to him him first.

Even though everyone has seen revenge movies a thousand times over, this one stands out because of the way that John goes about getting his revenge. The action is what makes this movie so awesome, so it doesn't even matter if you already know the plot going into the movie. And the sets/scenery are fantastic. It is basically a criminal underground where protocol must be followed, even among killers, or else you will be made an example of.

The directing is great, the movie is well acted, and the fight scenes are terrific because they look like ""real"" fight scenes and not the fight scenes where everyone just automatically knows some form of martial arts. When someone gets hurt, you feel their pain!

If you like good action movies and don't mind the sight of blood, then this is for you. This is Keanu Reeves at his best, and I can't wait until it is available to own.",1414713600,,1616,4.376666666666667
6775513,5,B00OV3VGP0,"Keanu Reeves is something of an enigma. He's a good actor but not particularly great, and he's a smart performer but gets caught in a string of rather dull films until one comes alone that showcases the style of acting that he's best at, as well as giving it a physical style that's highly unusual for a modern action film. This was perhaps best showcased in his work in the MATRIX trilogy which, despite its decline by the end, set the standard for modern action set pieces. But Keanu has languished over the last several years in films like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, CONSTANTINE, and 47 RONIN. So his buddies, long-time stuntmen/stunt coordinators and first-time directing duo Chad Staheski and David Leitch decided to give Keanu a shot back at being a cinematic badass again in the dark, violent, super-charged and super-exciting action thriller JOHN WICK.

Reeves plays our titular protagonist, a man who has just lost his wife (in flashbacks by Bridget Moynahan) to a sudden illness. Shortly after her funeral, he receives a gift from his late wife, an adorable beagle puppy along with a note telling him that he needs something to love other than his classic 1969 Ford Mustang. He does indeed start loving the puppy pretty quickly, but when he runs afoul of Iosef (GAME OF THRONES' Alfie Allen), the spoiled wannabe tough guy son of a Russian mobster, who wants Wick's Mustang, Iosef and a few of his goons break into Wick's home, beat him unconscious, steal the car, and worst of all, kill his dog. Unbeknownst to Iosef, but well known to his father Viggo (Michael Nyqvist of the original Swedish GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO series and also MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL), Wick is possibly one of the most dangerous hitmen he's ever seen. Knowing Wick will come after his son, Viggo puts a $2 million bounty on his head. Wick, armed with an arsenal, comes after Iosef with everything he can muster.

There are several things working at once that make this film work. One is the style of the film, or rather the blending of several different styles. It takes the standard revenge thriller, blends it with a noirish world of crime, a hybrid of Hong Kong cinema combat styles to all of its big action set pieces, as well as a comic book/video game sensibility of its characters and settings. The second thing is the directon by Staheski and Leitch. They've made their careers as stuntmen and stunt coordinators, and the action sequences have such a fluid movement to them that few journeyman directors would have. Third is the cast. This film is packed with wall-to-wall great character actors such as Willem Dafoe as a fellow assassin who may or may not be against John, the aforementioned Nyqvist and Allen, Ian McShane as the proprietor of a hotel where assassins can stay at as sort of a neutral ground, Adrienne Palicki as another fellow assassin who is definitely interested in her payday, Dean Winters as Viggo's right-hand man, John Leguizamo as a scrupulous chop-shop operator, and Lance Reddick (THE WIRE, FRINGE) as the mysterious hotel's concierge. Fourth is the script by Derek Kolstad. Another newcomer, Kolstad cut his teeth on simplistic VOD fodder like Steve Austin vehicles, but this film has a depth to it that belies its absurd premise. There's an existentialist quality to the film, and while the film doesn't slow down too much to explore the concept, it's still there. The film is essentially about a killer lying in wait to take bloody revenge on a world that has robbed him of everything he loved. The death of the dog is just an excuse for Wick to become the man he was; a dealer of death so feared in the underworld that, at one point as Viggo explains, ""He's not a bogeyman. He's the man you sent to kill the bogeyman"".

Going back to the fighting style of the film, it requires some further praise. The concept of ""Gun-Fu"" has been something that has existed since the Hong Kong actioners of the late 80's/early 90's, but really didn't reach American cinemas until THE MATRIX, when suddenly guns were just an extension of the character's physical fighting skills. This premise was further explored to a greater degree with Kurt Wimmer's severly underrated sci-fi actioner EQUILIBRIUM, where they called their style ""Gunkata"". JOHN WICK explores that concept even further, but in a way that combines physical beating and gunplay seamlessly, and it's the first American film I've seen since EQUILIBRIUM that makes the combination of hand-to-hand combat and gunfighting so exciting. And in this film, it's put to some really astounding use, particularly in the first scene where Wick gets some unexpected intruders, and a nightclub sequence that might be one of the best action set pieces of the year.

While the real winners of the film are Reeves, who gives possibly the best performance of his career as well as a much-needed shot in the arm to it, and the directing duo of Staheski and Leitch, the best performance of the film is clearly Nyqvist, who plays Viggo as imposing and frightening, but still gives the film a necessary injection of dark humor and somewhat manic energy. To be fair, though, everyone in the film gives a great performance despite their somewhat limited screentime, which is also a great credit to Staheski and Leitch, showing they have a talent for casting the right people in the right roles.

JOHN WICK is a film that some people will walk away from feeling a little cheated because it's not a particularly ""fun"" film, but I believe that most will walk away feeling exhilarated and supremely entertained.

6775514,4,B00OV3VGP0,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

Keanu Reeves gets back in the game with this action-packed thriller and does what he does best, kick butt with a minimal amount of dialog.  Helmed by his former stunt double, Chad Stahleski (IMDb also credits David Leitch as director) from ""The Matrix"" and other films, ""Wick"" warrants a return to the franchise.

Reeves plays the title character who is a retired mob assassin, who we learn later was only allowed to retire after he completed an ""impossible"" assignment given to him by the top Russian gangster, Viggo (Michael Nyqvist).  John is in a state of depression after the death of his wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan), only shown in flashback and on a smart-phone video.  She has one last surprise for him however, a cute Beagle puppy to keep him company.  He also has a '69 Ford Mustang to die for.

When a trio of Russian punks try to buy his car at a gas station, John refuses.  Later, the Russians led by Iosef (Alfie Allen from ""Game of Thrones"") and the son of Viggo, invade John's home, beat him up, steal the car, wreck the house and kill the puppy.  John goes into a slow burn indicative of his surname, vows revenge and goes to work.  From that perspective, we've seen this movie before, but rarely with the constant movement and action that this cast and crew bring to bear.  This isn't the non-stop martial arts battles we've seen before, yet that style of fighting is also prevalent.  Wick wants to kill people, not just disable them.  So there is plenty of guns and knives.

It is Reeves' use of handguns and knives that caught my attention.  Often he wounds an attacker, then returns with a bullet or two to the head.  An interesting cast supports the film.  Willem Dafoe plays Marcus who, like John in his former occupation, is an assassin who may or may not be an ally or an enemy.  Ian McShane's character runs an interesting hotel for criminals who just need to get away from it all for a while.  Adrianne Palicki plays another killer for hire.

The fight choreography is perfect.  The sets look great and the soundtrack is superb with music by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard.  Reeves who just turned 50, joins the ranks of other actors just past their prime and delivers a memorable character and helps deliver a fine film which he is also an executive producer.",1414540800,3,2334,4.584541062801932

6775518,4,B00OV3VGP0,"""John Wick"" (2014 release; 96 min.) brings the story of the title character (played by Keanu Reeves). As the movie opens, we see Wick crash his SUV into a wall, and he crawls out, bleeding and in bad shape. We then go back in time, as we see how Wick's wife passes away (we later learn she had cancer). Knowing her time was near, she arranged for a post-funeral gift to Wick of a darling puppy dog (named Daisy). Daisy helps Wick cope with his grief. One day, at the gas station, Wick and the puppy run into a group of Russian thugs. They follow Wick home and overpower him, steal his car and kill the puppy. At this point we're maybe 10-15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would be pointless, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the debut feature of director Chad Stahelski, who previously was... none other than the long-time stunt double for Reeves! Talk about a promotion! Great directing debut, that's for sure. Second, plot, schmottt... Other than coming up for a reason for all of the mayhem, there is zero plot, and that's perfectly fine, as this is all about the action and the movie's mood (dark and stylish). The multiple fight and shooting scenes feel at times like a ballet, and at times like a cartoon. The overall theme of the movie is of course very much like the Charles Bronson ""Death Wish"" revenge vehicles from the 1980s. At one point Wick , in a very bad mood, takes care of one of the baddies, and yells at him ""You stole my care and you killed my dog!"", and I could've picture Bronson saying exactly the same thing (these are men of few words, obviously). When Wick was going on one of his one-against-all shooting sprees, I expected/hoped Bjorn's ""Army of Me"" to blast away (alas, it didn't). Third, Reeves looks like he's having more fun that he's had in years with this film, looking relaxed and confident. William Dafoe (as a old-time mentor and friend of Wick's) has a small role (maybe 10-15 min. of screen time). Last but not least, there is a very enjoyable (mostly electronic) soundtrack, courtesy of Tyler Bates and Joel Richard. When all was said and done, I found myself surprised how quickly the movie had rolled by.

The movie opened nationwide this past weekend and did better than expected, coming in second at the box office while grossing $15 million. I finally went to see it today (Tuesday) and the evening screening where I saw this at in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great, which is not a surprise for a weekday evening. The movie has gotten mostly positive reviews from the film critics, and it's easy to see why: this is a top-notch action movie, with Keanu Reeves in fine form, and it all flies by in no time. If you love action flicks (and you know who you are!), you cannot go wrong with this. ""John Wick"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1414454400,4,2853,4.474088291746641

This movie has amazing action sequences. The story is simple yet effective. The movie creates an intriguing criminal under world, with tremendous directing and film work. There are great performances from the entire cast, who each portray deep and interesting characters. IMO - a must see movie, for all movie fans (action and non-action fans alike). The pacing was perfect, the action was top of the class (and finds a way to feel much more realistic than all the other action movies these days), GO SEE THIS NOW!!!!

Each of the action scenes is carefully crafted. They are filmed so that you can clearly see all the action, and this film does not rely on ""fancy"" cut sequences or special effects. It relies on the ""action"" itself, which is top notch. Wish there were more movies like this! Keanu's performance is top notch, you can see the adrenaline pumping through his veins, as he gets ready to unleash his vengeance.

CRITIC RECEPTION

With over 100 critic reviews, John Wick is currently rated at 86% on Rotten Tomatoes. Being a big fan of action movies, and feeling like it's been a while since a good action movie has been released, I was anticipating this movie for a long time. I was not disappointed.

Easily one of the best action movies in recent years, and likely since The Bourne Ultimatum, Keanu stars in a no nonsense, action flick with beautifully crafted fight scenes. No surprise given the director was a trained martial arts instructor, who coordinated movie stunts for several years. Keanu is charismatic, and does a great job with John Wick. Pulls it off perfectly.

PLOT SUMMARY

Chances are, you already know the story line... Summarizing the trailer (with no further spoilers than what you are supposed to know), John Wick was once the mob's top hit man. He left the underworld to be with his loving wife.

Unfortunately, she dies from a sickness. Her last gift to John was a puppy, to help John cope with the loss.

The no-good son of the mob boss, decides to steal Keanu's car. In the process, he kills John's puppy. Big mistake. From there, John Wick seeks his vengeance, and wreaks havoc on those that stole his wife's last gift to him.

And boy, does it feel good to see John Wick take out bad guys!!!

While the plot may seem silly, it really works. The movie does a great job of letting you feel John Wick's pain, anger, and motivation.

SHOULD YOU SEE IT?

If you are looking for a good time, not offended by movie violence, and are a fan of action movies, see this movie NOW. There is a reason why this movie has been welcomed by critics. It's hard to not enjoy this film, unless you don't enjoy seeing bad guys get a bullet (or two or five).

Yes, it is violent. There is some foul language, but it is used tastefully and in small quantities. No nudity.

This movie builds up a very interesting ""under world"", that feels much deeper than you would expect from a 100 minute movie. You can read between the lines, and see a deep history between each of the characters.

One of my favorite movies. John Wick might easily become the next cult classic - it is that much fun.

MY RATINGS

As a movie: 8.5/10. Beautifully shot, well choreographed, interesting characters, brilliant performances from the actors. Perfect sound track.

In terms of enjoyment: 10/10. My favorite movie in a long time.

In terms of action sequences: 10/10. Some of the best I have ever seen. Relies on carefully choreographed action movements. Does not rely on fancy camera cuts, special effects, etc.

Overall: 10/10.

UPDATE: I saw this movie in the theaters again (I went with someone who hadn't seen the movie yet). Surprisingly, I enjoyed this movie just as much during the second viewing, as I did when I first saw it. I will definitely be purchasing this movie on Blu-Ray when it is released. It has strong replay value for me, and this movie will be added to my collection as soon as it is released.

His wife dies, but for some reason, decides to send him a puppy through some ""after-life"" service to keep him company. He literally has the dog for one or two days before some thugs looking to steal his car beat him up and kill his dog. It's an unfortunate scene because it makes it hard to believe what the rest of the movie tries to set up. John Wick is revealed by the thug's father to be the man who gets rid of boogeymen, which must have been confusing to Alfie Allen's character because...didn't his two boys almost waste this guy?

So for the rest of the movie, you get action scene after action scene of poorly done, cheap gun-fu in which this guy, who was taken out easily by Russian thugs, churns through the mob's best hit men and enforcers like cheap toy soldiers. All of these men conveniently decide to use the same tactics, charging at him one at a time in perfect succession, only to be killed. Not one of them looks at all this and thinks that perhaps it's not a smart idea to attack this man that apparently is the human Terminator. What's worse is, after Keanu has a contract put out on his life, he decides to leave his house to stay in just about the worst place imaginable; a hotel for hitmen. I am not kidding you. This, along with some other corny elements, ultimately were needless and turn this movie from a semi-realistic action film into something bordering on fantasy.

The other supporting characters behave like total morons who must not have been told by the director what part they were playing. The whole plot is based on logical fallacies, with characters doing stupid things that make zero sense, simply to continue the movie.

Couple the amateurly written and filmed movie with a grating, senselessly implemented rock soundtrack, and you have one heck of a mess of a film. Maybe there is a director's cut that is an improvement of this trash. It wouldn't surprise me. I just can't recommend this. I think Keanu is pretty much direct-to-DVD at this point, but it's his own fault, because he chooses to only really do one kind of movie, with himself in the leading role.

Recommendation - wait for the DVD; buy it from Amazon - and Jeff B. will understand when you return it for a COMPLETE REFUND! But, even Jeff can't refund your time. Just don't upload John Wick'y to the cloud - I do believe in the Matrix - NEO will getcha - and your DOG!

The only problem is that 15 months from now when Hollywood, Washington and Reeves want to pick our pocket again - will we remember, or will be looking for an escape from ISIS, Ebola, .....
