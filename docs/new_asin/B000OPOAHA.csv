8185972,5,B000OPOAHA,"I really enjoyed the anime; it was a good value. When watching the discs play on a large, flat-screen television, the resolution is noticeably poorer you see with more modern anime DVDs or Blurays, but this series was made in the late '90s or early 2000s so I think the low resolution is inevitable. Great price.",1467072000,,312,4.589285714285714

8185974,3,B000OPOAHA,Years ago I bought the second season of this series.  I was not terribly impressed.  I bought the first season to see if was an improvement.  It wasn't.  It is early anime and shows it.  It is interesting as a historical referent but for entertainment value go with something more modern.  The story line is alright but the anime rendering is not up to what's produced recently.,1403740800,,378,4.567164179104478
8185975,5,B000OPOAHA,"GTO (Great Teacher Onizuka) was one of the few animes I can recall that I thought at first I'd hate; turns out I was dead wrong! The story centering around the unorthodox teach Eikichi Onizuka is a few nice throw back to the roots of 90's anime. Onizuka (ex-biker gang leader and all-around jackass) decides he wants to go to school to hook up with high school girls; sadly no main character is ever so lucky. From what was a rather odd beginning with a unusual hero the story take a strange turn when Onizuka ends up the teacher of a private middle school class hell bent on ruining any teacher that dares to take their class...sadly they didn't plan on a teacher more childish than them to play dirty and even the playing field.

The first season covers Mr. Onizuka's entry into the Holy Forest Academy and clash after class with his students as he slowly starts to win them over and remind them that you can have fun, even in school. For me one of the highlights is in the English voice cast Onizuka is voiced by none other than David Lucas (known for his role as Spike Spigiel and Shishio Makoto just to name a few). This anime with make you laugh, cry, and even rethink putting off your homework.

If you're looking for a great anime that's timeless and will always be one of the legends, this is one you've just gotta have.",1345680000,,1329,4.376518218623482
8185976,5,B000OPOAHA,"Great Teacher Onizuka is one of the most underated anime's to be licensed in America. If you expect a series about a car driver or biker you are on ball... sorta. In this quirky anime Biker Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old, stumbles onto a job teaching at an academy called Holy Forest. There a whole lot of insane antics occur and you begin to warm up to what is ""Great Teacher Onizuka"" he is stupid, he is a man of action, and he is cool. If you like Initial D then you will like this series as jokes are made about Initial D in this anime on occasion. The language and nudity in this show are very tame, not too much is seen throughout. This series caught my attention when I was in the 8th grade, I randomly picked up volume 1 of it on DvD at Sam Goody and I was pleased; so pleased I bought the whole series overtime(I recently got semester 2 of this show<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GTO-Box-Set-Semester-2/dp/B000TSMOHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GTO Box Set - Semester 2</a>&nbsp;it was just as good.)",1294099200,,1046,4.816666666666666
8185977,5,B000OPOAHA,"This is a great series. It has some life lessons and makes you think a little. Caution though, there are some suggestive themes seeing that the main character is a slight perv.",1272153600,,176,4.53125
8185978,5,B000OPOAHA,"Series goes places I haven't seen others go. I have never before seen an anime based around ex-thug teacher. The show starts off very well showing how down hill some kids in school have gone, and how Onizoka can not only relate but actually get respect from what other teachers classify as ""trash"".

Onizoka is also a bit of pervert, who gets into teaching to meet and have power over high school girls. But as it goes on he develops a sense of morales, and learns that doing that may not be a bright move considering his past gang affiliation.

I'm still watching it sadly, but have put these box sets on my wish list, and plan seriously on adding them to my collection.",1224633600,,671,4.403225806451613
8185979,5,B000OPOAHA,"Starting off, the amazon synopsis says this set is just one disc.  Well, it isn't, it is five disc.  The first five disc of the series in fact, just as if you're buying them separatly but definitly more cheaper.
Now on to the review, the series is about a former biker leader, Onizuka, who wants to be not only a teacher but the best teacher japan has ever seen.  Of course their are obstacles such as other teachers, pta, and of course students that want to get rid of Onizuka because of his juvenile behavior, and the students have student-teacher complexes.  The animation is quite old school, meaning it has like Lupin animation; nothing like the action animes out.  The series is a comedy but does have serious parts, and most episodes have a deep lesson that has been taught.  A definite recommendation!",1191542400,13,809,4.6223776223776225
