2897329,4,B000TGJ81W,"Despite its failings, I enjoyed this disc. As soon as I heard about it, I put it on my must have list, and basically bought it because of Lance Henrikson's name. The sub-title, Blood Feud, out me in mind of the Sequel, which is a bit of a dog to watch, but still has some good creature FX. And the FX in this seem to be mostly practical, however so much CGI is seamless, there could be lots, but on what I suspect the budget is, I doubt. Whatever the budget is or was, it was not spent on ADR. Some scenes have been re-dubbed in the worst manner. This having been said, the elements of the occult, the full on appearance of the Demon, and some fleshing out of the Mythos provide some great material. Like the First film, its Lance who has the core of this film, even if he does only appear in a few scenes. The Attacks and the makeup work is first rate. Whomever they used for that did a great job.
THE DVD: The audio is fairly good. On a 5.1 sound systtem its excellent. However, the film is all you get. With one of Horrors iconic actors in an iconic role, you would think that some thought for extras might have been at  the very  least looked into. But, I had a blast watching the film. For me, Lance made this film, but hell, I'm a Lance Henrikson fan. I just wish that the producers of some films will stop short changing fans, and if they produce B class films, at least provide a ton of extras to make up the difference. I also wish that the ratings ""bored"" would stop with the idiocy; I see more violence on a news cast, and thats saying something, given that this film is fairly full on.",1230854400,,1597,4.131832797427653
2897330,2,B000TGJ81W,"Silly plot.  Horrible tie to first movie.  Goes on and on with same premise of kill the one who calls the monster, but takes for ever to do it.  Do not waste your money.",1224460800,,169,3.911764705882353
2897331,2,B000TGJ81W,"Picked this up for $2.99 at a local video store. I loved the original, so I thought for nostalgia's sake, I'd give it a shot.

""Pumpkinhead"" benefitted from the creature and makeup effects of Stan Winston, who also made his directorial debut. It was a spooky ghost story with plenty of atmosphere. The opening scene is still creepily effective.

This, is not that. ""Blood Feud"" has terrible editing, sound editing, effects...I could go on and on. It's just cringe-worthy to hear all those Romanians try to produce credible southern accents. More often than not, they sound like bad ""Forrest Gump"" impersonators.

Lance Henriksen returns (did he not see the script? Was the entire budget spent on his role?), as Ed Harley. I thought his character was sent to Hell, but I guess that doesn't matter when you need a familiar face for the 3rd sequel. The character of the witch is back as well, though in less-effective makeup and presence.

Having said all that, I didn't hate it. There are moments that remind me of the original. Obviously, the director did what he could with a limited  budget. The creature doesn't look too cheesy, though I suspect they were a little too proud of the costume, as you see it (and it's flaws) all the time!

Basically, it's just a good BAD movie. It made me laugh.",1203379200,,1295,4.682819383259912
2897332,3,B000TGJ81W,"What we have here Kiddies is the story of a backwoods family feud over a car that has been going on since the 1940s and now two family members are in love but they can't be together because of the feud and just when you think that we have the story of Romeo and Juliet some of the brothers on the girl's side are responsible for the death of the boy sister and they also roughed him up and he naturally calls the famous vengeance Demon.
despite the fact that he is warned by the ghost of Lance Henrickson against it.

This was another good sequel once again taking place in the same area that the first film took place despite the fact that it was more than likely filmed in Romania.

I liked most of the characters. despite the feeling of taking place in the 1940s then I remembered that this is in the back woods areas and some of them are like that. Those of you that have been to Arkansas you know what I mean...OK Arkansas isn't that bad but you get the picture.

Back to the point. The characters were all likable the ones that aren't to likable are the first ones to go at the hands of Pumpkinhead but all in all the flick was pretty good and the shooting editing and acting was good for a direct to DVD flick

Don't expect too much from the Extras on the DVD just your basic SCI-FI DVD.

2897333,3,B000TGJ81W,"It's no mistake that anyone who's ever seen the first of this series always mentions it when discussing the sequels.  The first film was original and the effects were done before CGI became commonplace at even low-budget levels, so the monster was genuinely firghtening and oter-worldly.  It was a smart film for the genre, and the acting was better than average.

The sequels have been abysmal, but this one is probably the best of the lot.  It has an interesting premise, marrying the genuine American folklore of the Hatfields and McCoys with the engaging original beast.  The story is a little overwrought, the CGI - when used - is laughable, and when CGI isn't used there's too much of the monster revealed so you see it for the rubber suit it is.  It's enough to make you wonder why they didn't just use the far better lighting/marionnette techniques of the original - it certainly had to be cheaper, if more work.  In the original, PH was impossibly designed.  Using a guy in a suit - even on sicks - just looks like a guy in a suit.  The too-many full-body, broad daylight shots of the creature don't help matters.

But in the end, it's certainly better than a lot of its ilk, and it's over-the-top with the kills, if you're into that sort of thing.",1199577600,,1257,4.546666666666667

2897335,4,B000TGJ81W,"I saw Ashes to Ashes (3rd in the Pumpkinhead series) and thought it was pretty awful. But I just couldn't resist this one. It has an interesting premise with the Hatfields and McCoys. The picture quality was amazing, combined with some nice gore and a storyline I haven't seen in the horror genre before. It's always nice to see the witch, and even though Ed Harley is only in a handful of scenes, its very effective. Hell, this movie even has a moral. Overall, if your looking for a Halloween treat, this will do well.",1192406400,11,519,4.473684210526316
2897336,4,B000TGJ81W,"After PUMPKINHEAD 3, I wasn't sure what to expect. And, there are rough edges to this new offering. But, the ghost of Ed Harley--Lance Henriksen--made this new film come alive for me. There are several scenes with Henriksen that remind all of us of two things: 1) the depth Lance has an actor; and 2) his ability to underscore again and again the deadend of revenge. If you care about horror as a genre of moral fable, then you should see this. Lance, thanks again!",1191715200,,465,4.482352941176471
2897337,4,B000TGJ81W,"This movie was pretty good but not great, the cgi is pretty lame but other than that this film works. It's way better than part 2 and 3. HOpefully soon Pumpkinhead is on its way to getting a even better film. AT least this film was a step in the right direction.",1191024000,7,262,4.0576923076923075
2897338,3,B000TGJ81W,"Having been a fan of the original PUMPKINHEAD i've been extremely disappointed with the so-called sequels. JEFF BURR's (1994) BLOOD WINGS and JAKE WEST's (2006) ASHES TO ASHES. Both had me wishing i could contact the hag and resurrect PUMPKINHEAD myself, for making me sit this pile of crap.

But MICHAEL HURST's BLOOD FEUD is different. The basic storyline is that of ROMEO and JULIET. Two long feuding families find themselves forced together, when one of thier own resurrects PUMPKINHEAD to avenge the death of his sister, but also so he and his estarnged love can be together, (by killing off the rest of her family. Ahh true love)

Although the film is very sterio-typical, and plods along from A to B, it is still an competant piece of work, the death scenes are bloody and gruesome, as you'd expect from a striaght to DVD released film, but why this film works is PUMPKINHEAD. He stands, quite literally, head and shoulders above everyone else and more to the point he looks great, even in broad daylight.

MICHAEL HURST will never be an ANTHONY HICKOX (WAXWORK, WARLOCK THE ARMAGEDDON) but he knows what looks good and what looks crap. The C.G.I. in the film is awful, but HURST seems to acknowledge this and uses it rearly, a wise choice.

PUMPKINHEAD: BLOOD FEUD was never going to win any Oscar's but at least someone has finally realised, 19 years later, why people love and buy these films, for PUMPKINHEAD of course.

PUMPKINHEAD is big, mean, ugly and doesn't take any crap off anybody, just as we like him.

Long may he stay that way.",1187481600,7,1550,4.680147058823529

2897341,2,B000TGJ81W,"For a cheesy horror movie, this one is pretty bad.  Pumpkinhead just looked lame and wasn't really scary, he was more goofy than anything.  Plus he looked a lot like one of the aliens from the Aliens franchise and that kinda took me out of the movie.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

The story itself is pretty basic, guy loses his sister and wants to be with his girlfriend but her family killed his sister and won't let the two lovers be together so he enlists the help of the supernatural.  But of course he sees the error of his ways after it cuts a bloody swath through his beloved's family and then he helps stop the monster.

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

The special effects are lame, the kills are just boring and the acting is terrible.  The only saving grace of the movie was that it had Lance Henriksen in it and he delivered the only good performance in this film.

2897354,3,B000TGJ81W,"I liked it okay. The Creature (Pumpkin Head) didn't look as real as the original one. But, It's still okay.",1366588800,,107,4.4
2897355,3,B000TGJ81W,"The appeal of the original ""Pumpkinhead"" (1988) was its creepy atmosphere, serious vibe, malevolent monster and the always reliable Lance Henriksen, but other than these factors it wasn't anything noteworthy. As far as overall entertainment goes, practically every Friday the 13th sequel was/is superior.

""Pumpkinhead 4: Blood Feud"" (2007) is the third sequel and -- although it was shot in Romania rather than California -- it stays true to the original concept by having a similar revenge plot and features the three main characters of the original: Ed Harley (Henriksen), albeit now a ghost; the ugly, old witch; and, of course, Pumpkinhead itself. Although Henriksen is 18 years older he's just fine; the witch looks almost exactly the same; as does Pumpkinhead. Speaking of which, some complain about the appearance of pumpkinhead, but he (it) looks great to me; I know it's probably done via CGI, unlike the original, but it works and I couldn't discern any strings, so to speak.

The unique thing here is that the story involves a modern-day take on the Hatfield/McCoy feud crossed with Romeo & Juliet, which I found interesting.

The creature is featured prominently throughout, as are Henriksen and the witch, and there's loads of gore, but I didn't find the story or the characters all that compelling. It's not bad, but it's not good either; it's somewhere in between. The story needed more drawing power. Still, it's a decent sequel.

2897357,3,B000TGJ81W,"Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud, while it exactly don't pick up where the last movie left off, though that there are still the witch Haggis along with the ghost of Ed Harley that make a come back in this Pumpkinhead movie.  Although that the story revolves around the old feud between the McCoys and the Hatfields, while a boy from the McCoys is in love with one of the Hatfield girls, while at first neither side knows about this.  They soon find out after a `death' occurs and once again the creature known as Pumpkinhead is called upon by one of the McCoys to take out the Hatfields so he can be in with his girl forever.  While that is going on, he seems to be a bit stubborn about is truly happening around him, and when it's too late he finally comes to his senses and does something about what he has done.  While the CGI in the movie seemed to be a little better than that in Ashes to Ashes, but it wasn't that good at least for this movie and as for the story I feel that was on par with the first movie.  Overall I give this 3.5 stars out of 5.",1281139200,,1046,4.107843137254902
2897358,4,B000TGJ81W,"Pumpkinhead is back for the forth time, straight to dvd and better then ever (except for his first appearance). After pretty weak reviews for Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes this installment has seemed to add a little hope that they can still pump out something decent in the series. It appears the producers decided to keep the revenge slayings to a maximum to keep viewers from falling asleep half way through. This one was bloody for sure, hence the title Blood Feud.

The story starts with the well known intense feud between the Hatfields and McCoys. Jodie Hatfield and Ricky McCoy are the only two between the families that have put rivalries behind due to their love for each other. With no end in sight they decide leave town so they can enjoy their relationship without the constant family feuding (not the game show type). So late one night after the Hatfields crashed a McCoy wedding Jodie sneaks away with Ricky while his sister Sara keeps a look out. Despite their efforts they are found in the woods by Jodie's brothers and Sara winds up being killed. Ricky being enraged consults the witch and summons Pumpkinhead who wastes no time ripping people apart. The fury is unleashed on the Hatfields in one non stop bloody mess.

As we've seen our fourth appearance of Pumpkinhead it is now evident we will see much more CGI and much less of the true creature himself. Hey things change overtime so you just roll with it. None the less the film is really fun and entertaining. It's by far the best sci-fi channel original they've put out yet to date. Like in other reviews I've done for the series I can only recommend this to the Pumpkinhead fans. I'd think most people who like horror will get a kick out of Blood Feud, but if you're not into the Pumpkinhead idea you probably won't enjoy this one.",1246752000,,1805,4.60248447204969

8208934,3,B000TGJ81W,"Of interest only because it features Pumpkinhead.  But then the writer/director (Michael Hurst) went off the beaten path to attach Pumpkinhead to the Hatfield and McCoy feud!!!  The result is a lot of Hillbilly hokum and the barest minimum of a plot.  In this offering, Pumpkinhead is already dealing with a hit on two men who killed a woman, fled the scene of the crime, and then for good measure the survivor killed her grieving husband.  Five years later, Pumpkinhead is revived to deal with the murdering Hatfields who caused the death of a young girl then tried to murder her brother by dragging him through the woods behind a speeding pickup.  He survives and makes a deal with the witch of the woods to resurrect Pumpkinhead to kill every Hatfield save one, his girlfriend.  As with the other films in this franchise, things do not end well for the ones marked or for the one who put out a contract on the killers.  And yes, Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen) keeps popping up like Jiminy Cricket, cautioning everyone not to do what theyve already done.  Reminding them that they won't live long enough to regret their actions.  YOURE DOOMED!  As the witch says to him, we all got our curses Ed Harly.

If you're into silly, low budget silly at best, you might just like this creature feature.  It is what it is......mildly amusing and somewhat entertaining.",1478044800,,1358,4.6835443037974684
