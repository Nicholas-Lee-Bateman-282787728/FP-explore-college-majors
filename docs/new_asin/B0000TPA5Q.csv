8002678,3,B0000TPA5Q,"It's probably due to the fact that I'm not from Latin American nor have I ever been to Mexico (where the movie takes place), but this movie was hard to follow.",1323475200,,159,4.161290322580645
8002679,3,B0000TPA5Q,"When first released, Maria Novaro's film was understandably poked fun as ""Telmita y Luisita"" by the press.  To be fair, there is more to the movie than what that remark suggests, and there lie its virtues and defects.  Like Novaro's ""The Garden of Eden"" (also on DVD), the film tries to link Mexican gender and politics.  In ""Sin dejar huella"", Novaro tackles drug-dealing and the rape and disappearance of factory workers in Mexican border towns, by weaving together the stories of two very different women: a sophisticated art smuggler and an uneducated factory worker (played by two excellent and attractive actresses, Spanish Aitana Sanchez-Gijon & Mexican Tiare Scanda). The leads are lovely to look at, the film has a great soundtrack, and there are gorgeous shots of Mexican landscapes, but by the time the two women start their cross-country journey running away from drug dealers, the film degenerates into a conventional road movie that never really pays off in its premise. It's no ""Thelma & Louise"" or ""Y tu mama tambien"", but still, its decent enough for a rental.",1133395200,13,1077,5.005586592178771
8002680,5,B0000TPA5Q,"I bought this movie not knowing what to expect from it, but simply wanting to gear up for taking spanish next semester..... I ended up loving this movie, love love love.  Tiar Scanda and Aitana Snches-Gijn are both excellent actresses, and this is the kind of script that really needs great actresses to carry it, since the focus is almost completely on them.  It's a simple film, but I don't mean ""simple"" in a bad way.  It lets the audience into the psychology of the characters without being too dark or dramatic.  The scenery is beautiful, and the soundtrack is great.  I highly reccomend it!",1105228800,11,596,4.6380952380952385
8002681,4,B0000TPA5Q,"Ana, an educated art historian, and Aurelia, lone mother of two, are two women in trouble, one with the law and the other with drug trafficking thugs.  Their paths cross as Ana asks if she can get a ride with Aurelia to Cancun as both attempt to escape their pasts.  This is in the backdrop of a vicious serial killer that has murdered over 250 women and haunts all women in Mexico.  Without a Trace is a wonderful road movie about the two women as they try to change their lives on their own in the shadow of a patriarchal society.  Novaro creates a motherly environment as mother Aurelia breast feeds and nurtures her little baby, but also a tough femme fatale atmosphere with the women drinking beer in different bars.  These two aspects of the women are brought to the screen with strong drama and comedy as the women venture for something better.  In the end, Novaro creates a wonderful cinematic experience that both entertains and enlightens the audience.",1085875200,19,962,4.629411764705883
