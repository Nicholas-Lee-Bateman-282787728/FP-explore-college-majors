8218048,2,B000VD4XWC,"I teach Jr. High Resource Students which means that they have mild learning disabilities. Shakespeare is a real stretch for them and most teachers don't attempt to introduce him to students until high school. I have a unit that introduces MacBeth and the students are given an overview of the play. This video helped with some of the explanatory information, but it would've been more understandable to them with more scenes and more perfunctory information. The academic panel was exactly that and more in tune with collegiate students and studies rather than my students. The panel could have also been more entertaining. They were obviously intellectuals with varying opinions which for average students and even average adults were beyond the norm.
 The scenes that were used for illustration were very well done. The acting, costumes,and minimal sets were excellent. I will use the DVD again, but will not dwell on the panel discussions.",1356998400,2,942,5.1568627450980395
