5040146,5,B006ZL84EW,"A first rate production and a good beginning to the Morse ""saga"", which still continues now with the ""Lewis"" series. (If young Mr. Fox continues as he has so far, may we be treated to a further continuation of the Morse story after ""Lewis""?) The producers have caught the essence of Morse in this initial (I hope) episode of the story of his early life as a detective. The lead actor's appearance is a jolt at first but by the end of the show one forgets that initial experience and sees the young Endeavour Morse as ""Morse"", and not just in the rear view mirror. Well done!",1331856000,88,574,4.373831775700935
5040147,5,B006ZL84EW,"This single 98 minute DVD plots out Morse's early police career as a young rookie detective on assignment to Oxford in 1965 tacking his first big case searching for a missing 15-year old girl .
Shaun Evans does a superb job, in what must have been a tough role to cast, following in the late John Thaw's classic role. Overall the acting is excellent, with Roger Allam playing an especially good supporting role as Inspector Fred Thursday.
The production team certainly achieved the feel of the old Inspector Morse series, with sweeping shots of Oxford colleges and the local surrounding area. This is an excellent stand alone British drama, but for those Inspector Morse aficionados there are many references to his future character that we see being developed, including a particularly poignant ending.

5040226,5,B006ZL84EW,"I saw this pilot episode a couple of years ago, and remember enjoying it immensely. It was my introduction to the long-running ""Inspector Morse"" series. The ""Endeavour"" series is incredibly well done, with Shaun Evans grabbing every scene he is in... unless Roger Allam is there with him, in which case the scene becomes a visual symphony!
I re-watched the pilot the other night, and I guess I now own it. I am delighted! I'd forgotten how deeply moving the story and performances were. Morse's keen intellect and observational powers are a consistent thread through this series and the ""Inspector Morse"" series, but the psycho-emotional origins of some of Morse's idiosyncrasies are brought to light, as devastating events unfold.
I think this is a classic, all on its own.",1476489600,8,774,5.007751937984496

5040494,3,B006ZL84EW,"If you like Grantchester you'll like Endeavour, they are essentially the same show. Young, gifted detective (in this case an actual detective constable and not a preacher) forms a surprising friendship with an older, experienced inspector, and they team up to solve a murder. Even the setting (Oxford) resembles the settings in Grantchester. There are implications that Endeavour Morse has a troubled past, a lost love, and he finds himself running into people he knew at college. Sound familiar, Grantchester fans? I realize this is a prequel to the Inspector Morse series, which I have never seen, but I suspect some of the characters introduced, particularly a sinister and mysterious British agent, may also be younger versions of characters in that series. (Grantchester also manages to work British intelligence operatives into the plot.)

However, this is a mystery series, but the mystery here is very disappointing. Despite a couple of limp red herrings, it is clear from the beginning who the murderer is: the only person it could be. This is not only obvious using the ""Mrs. Fletcher Rule"" where the least offensive person is always the murderer, but the circumstances and motivation for the murder. It points to this person from the start, so it is doubly disappointing when that is who it turns out to be. It is also a little creepy that both Endeavour and Grantchester seem obsessed with the murders of sexually active underage girls.",1466553600,,1448,5.058577405857741

5040618,5,B006ZL84EW,"Anyone who loved the Inspector Morse series will love this pre-quell.  It was clever, well written and Shaun Evans as the young Endeavour Morse is extremely likable.  In this series you get introduced to how Morse came to like a pint, as well as his fancy for the Jaguar he later acquires.  Right out of Oxford Morse is already hooked on classical music and is already a stumbler when it comes to the opposite sex!  He's always hooked on cross-word puzzles and faints the first time he witnesses an autopsy!  Few sequels or prequels are as good as what their derived from but Endevour is an exception.  My only compliant is there are too few episodes!",1465516800,,651,4.568965517241379

5040624,5,B006ZL84EW,"The perfect prequel to a Masterpiece. Evans truly set Morse in the role of a detective. What better way to demonstrate conscientiousness, purposefulness, and individual  enterprise as a detective constable in England than through Endeavour.",1465430400,,240,5.857142857142857

5040753,5,B006ZL84EW,"To add a different perspective, it is the way this drama series captures the era so perfectly that has me in awe. WW2 is a constant thread through series, much as I remember it to have been for the adults during my sixties childhood in the UK. Many of the character types don't really exist any more, but are very familiar. I had a boss in the early seventies, who could have been the inspiration for the Chief Inspector. The drinking at lunchtime was very normal, and an important detail. The events in the series reflect the times, and the general feel of the times.

In the second series, the racism of the time has been largely omitted.which I think is a failing, as younger people would be shocked at how blatant it was back then.",1464739200,4,735,4.404411764705882

5040893,5,B006ZL84EW,"No one does mystery quite like the British do. Superb acting and production values highlight a tragic and thumping good mystery that reminds us the human race has cultivated its seedy underbelly for as long as the species has been alive. Shaun Evans does a particularly fine job as the conflicted young Inspector Morse, unsure at the beginning of his career if police work and detecting are the path he wants to follow. The fact that he's just as unsure at the movie's end made the story all the more intriguing. One of the rare films I will watch again simply because I know there are more layers to uncover.",1463184000,,609,4.545454545454546

The literary and music references are refreshing compared to the trite offerings usually found on American and European TV.  The reality of life - especially women's life - is very accurate, as well as the tensions of town and gown in Oxford.  Beautiful scenery of Oxford makes me quite nostalgic.  Quality shows such as Endeavor, Foyle's War, and Prime Suspect are too few and far between.",1458345600,,509,4.872093023255814

The story lines, characters,actors, scripts are great & although the clues are in the story, i never identified the culprit until young Morse & DI Thursday brought him or her to justice. I liked the settings as well.  Have watched them more than once & will watch again. An interesting thing, for me, was DI Thursday's name.  We used to have Sgt. Friday with Jack Webb, ""just the facts ma'am.""",1458000000,,530,4.5

5041291,5,B006ZL84EW,Great series! I like all of the Inspector Morris trilogy. The writers cleverly tied into the original Morris series in areas of his background. The only funny thing about the series is that Morris seems a lot brighter in 2006 as a young man that he was in the 1987 original series.,1457308800,,281,4.423076923076923
5041292,5,B006ZL84EW,Endeavour is one of the best tv mystery series in recent time. The series provides great plots and character acting. Shaun Evans does a great job playing Inspector Morse.  I'm hoping PBS and Amazon continue the series with new episodes.,1457308800,,236,4.9

Nothing ridiculously over the top, only what was necessary to paint the picture. Great acting, and a good plot with the puzzle pieces fitting together quite nicely.

Only thing is that some details, or bits, went past my head as I am not overly familiar with British slang. Also, I have never seen the show so I cannot do a comparison. Otherwise, brilliant!",1457136000,,534,4.804347826086956

Not only is the wit and mystery on-target in each show, but the script is artfully and devotedly performed by actors who can make you care about their characters from day one. Hooked. Side-note: there are some graphic scenes which coincide with the more thematic episodes that in general are tastefully done, they could have been left-out and still retained Endeavor's captivated and enthusiastic audience.

I am also in love with Detective Inspector Thursday, Detective Inspector Lewis, Detective Inspector Hathaway and of course Colin Dexter who's fertile mind created the Inspector Morse novels.

I have not watched more than an episode or two of Inspector Morse (Endeavour is a prequel that takes place in the 1960s) and never really got hooked. But Endeavour was instant gratification. Shaun Evans as the young Morse is outstanding as the low key assistant to Detective Inspector Fred Thursday (Roger Allam--a stand out). Anton Lesser and the rest of the cast are as perfect as one could hope for.

There is a third season in production...",1451606400,,615,4.747663551401869

5041657,5,B006ZL84EW,"Shaun Evans is superb in the title role of this program, Endeavor Morse, a policeman with a mysterious past.  Part of what makes this story interesting is the way in which we slowly learn more about Morse's past life.  Roger Allam is outstanding as Morse's boss, Detective Inspector Thursday.  The crimes that Morse & co. are investigating provides a lot of twists and turns to keep things interesting without becoming so convoluted as to confuse us or strain credibility.  The setting in Oxford provides a beautiful backdrop for the story and allows tie-ins to Morse's college days.  At the end of this program I wanted to see more.  Fortunately, I was not alone!  The BBC has made two additional seasons of episodes and another is filming.",1446249600,2,741,4.833333333333333

5041685,5,B006ZL84EW,"I really did enjoy it, watched all the episodes available on Prime. I hope that more episodes are forthcoming, but feels a bit odd after watching the old Morse for so many years. Cool that Abigail Thaw is in the series, too. I nearly knocked off a star for a mistake in the pilot episode. Digoxin is foxglove aka digitalis, not deadly nightshade aka belladonna. Then again, I knew that wolfsbane, monkshood, and aconite were the same thing (ref. first Harry Potter movie/novel). And this is not even my area of expertise. Maybe I'm just odd. Or too much like Hermione.",1446076800,,568,4.633663366336633

I find the younger Morse a much more likable character than he became.  I know eventually all good things must come to an end, but I am a super fan who has emersed myself in this series as well as Inspector Morse and Inspector Lewis.

This new series sets up the others and is so very well done.  Roger Allam and Shaun Evans are brilliant.  'Nuff said!",1445731200,,487,4.239130434782608

5042011,5,B006ZL84EW,"This is a must-see for any Inspector Morse fan and it will stand alone well for a newcomer. I enjoyed Shaun Evans' performance as Morse, though I had a tough time connecting his Morse with John Thaw's version.  There is the usual great attention paid to period detail which always enriches the story and performances for me. Roger Allam is excellent, too.  The stories always seem to let me down, but I can forgive that because everything else is so well done.  Very enjoyable overall.",1433808000,,485,4.682352941176471
5042012,4,B006ZL84EW,"The young inspector Morse shows more grit, passion and compassion in this second series. I like him a great deal better than first season.
It is painful to see him drinking more and more, but that's a personal observation, knowing that he turns out to be a drunk in his later life. Guess this sort of work does that to cops.
Obviously a broken heart is on the way.",1433808000,,364,4.2898550724637685

5042023,5,B006ZL84EW,A mystery that is solved by a  brilliant young detective who is plagued by his past and is in love with opera.  Shaun Evans is wonderful!  His portrayal of Endeavour is flawless.  You have to try and stay one step ahead of Endeavour and see if you can solve the mystery first but it is very difficult.  This is a totally engaging drama.

5042039,5,B006ZL84EW,"One of my favorite Masterpiece Mysteries. Not having any familiarity with the Inspector Morse series, I loved this glimpse into his origins. Evans (Morse) and Roger Allan (Inspector Fred Thursday) make a dynamic duo, protege and mentor. From the beginning the series will draw you in as Morse's intellect and isolation leads him to fixate on peculiarities of each case, which inevitably lead him to the responsibility parties, although at times after the occasional misstep. Thursday tries to steer him down the copper path, often realizing its Morse's unique qualities that make him the detective he is. Thanks to this pairing and some outstanding whodunits, this series is a masterpiece!",1432944000,,689,5.2727272727272725

5042043,5,B006ZL84EW,"Seeing Morse ""before he was Morse"", so to speak, is wonderful! And the image of John Thaw in the rearview mirror when young Endeavor is asked where he thinks he will be in 20 years-- priceless nod to a great series and actor! I am looking forward to seeing the Series 1 and Series 2 stories that follow this ""Pilot"". Fantastic viewing experience and a nicely intricate mystery, as well.",1432944000,,386,4.5285714285714285

5042049,5,B006ZL84EW,"Having long been a Morse fan, I felt lost when I knew that we would no longer have any more new episodes. Then when Enveavour began, I was somewhat skeptical, but quickly I saw much of the same strength in acting and in plotting that I had appreciated in Morse. This depiction of the young unworldly, socially awkward detective captured me with his robust and imaginative mind as he finds answers to complex murders. I hope we can continue to have more of Endeavor as he develops into the keen-minded,acerbic personality of the incomparable Morse.",1432857600,,547,4.768421052631579

Shaun Evans, as the perennial outsider Morse, has just the right combination of awkwardness, determination and in-spite-himself charm. Roger Allam is perfect as his mentor, the gruff and kindly Fred Thursday. And the stories by Russell Lewis, one of the truly great mystery and character writers, are sublime.
With this show, and it's two related shows - Inspector Lewis and Morse - you can treat yourself to weeks and months of sophisticated entertainment. Each show is crafted as well as any film, runs at least one and half hours, and makes for a riveting night.",1426118400,,710,4.642857142857143

5042379,5,B006ZL84EW,"Fantastic on every level: writing, cast, ambiance. Loved every episode of series 1 & 2, but I'm saving the last episode of series 2 (2.4)  to watch until series 3 is released (sometime in 2016?). I read in advance of watching it that episode 2.4 has a rather serious cliffhanger, and cliffhangers, especially when it's years before a new episode arrives to provide resolution, bug the heck out of me. I checked online and ITV did order series 3; IMDB lists Shaun Evans (Morse) as having made 9 episodes of Endeavor - listing episode 3.1 as completed - so I'm guessing series 3 is being made now. Highly highly recommended, truly exceptional telelvision.",1422316800,,653,4.778761061946903

5042381,3,B006ZL84EW,"As a huge BBC fan, I'm upset to say that this series was merely okay. I was looking for the usual very high quality and instead I seemed to have gotten the usual pablum. A young cop tries so hard to make good in a corrupt police station in rural England only to find he is stepping on the toes all the time of the cops that don't care or are on the take. he is brilliant so they all hate him for that and the fact that one Inspector promotes him very fast makes the others angry. The reason I'm not thrilled? It is the usual he has to keep proving himself to everyone crap...gets very boring. If you can look past that, this is a wonderful series and I did like some.",1421712000,,667,3.985074626865672

Can`t understand why movies of this quality cannot be made here in the United States.  It seems we over do everything in TV series and try so hard to make us love the actors and then we add stupid side lines into the storys.  I`ve given up on U.S. television and now watch only British programing.

5042462,5,B006ZL84EW,"Pretty effin awesome. The usual British formula for crime drama. Movie length episodes. The remnants of class warfare and jurisdictional politics providing character revelations and depth to each case. Minor pieces of evidence amazingly woven together into improbably and unnecessarily complex attempts to cover up brutal murders! Its great.

Side note: I find that the British television industry has an uncanny wealth of extremely talented supporting actors who are really able to sell their roles. I have not noticed this to the same degree in American shows, and it really makes a big difference in a show like Endeavor.

Second side note: This is to the semi-anonymous web expert who might want to argue or expound upon my observation above. I don't wish to discuss the situation with you or to know why you think I'm either wrong or right. Please do not say, ""What about (insert name of American character actor or show),"" and explain why American actors and shows are just as good as British ones, etc. etc. If you are an expert on this issue, perhaps you should be expressing yourself through venues a little more substantial than a commentary page on a website. I am not an expert, nor do I seek to become one. Suffice it to say that I am impressed with the quality of the bit players in this series, as well as George Gently, Foyle's War, and many of the other modern crime dramas to come out of Britain.",1417651200,,1414,4.720647773279352

We both love the writing and characters. We only wish there were more episodes to watch.  Shaun Evans is perfect for the role of Constable Morse and makes me forget that I'm watching a TV show.  He is very believable as the cerebral, quiet, opera-loving detective.  Roger Allam costars as Detective Inspector Fred Thursday and the relationship of the two starts to develop ones they find out that they both believe in justice and abhor the corruption prevalent in the department.",1417478400,,638,4.678571428571429

There is no respect for the intelligence of the viewer.  Countless holes in the plot.  Just a few examples -- (spoiler alert) -- why did the pimp talk, and why wasn't the ""right"" dress left at the scene?  How did the mechanic fit in?

his character- Detective Morse - to life! The plots really pull you in to watch how his knack for noticing obscure details aids in his efforts to get to the truth.

You don't just watch it while you are working doing activities in the background. Pay attention to it!!!!! Very convoluted with plots and subplots. The characters and story lines are well developed. Tons of British nuances that can be easily be missed. One episode has the (natural) gas man come out to the house to empty out the money from the meter... What??? Most Americans would not know why there is money in the meter but I figured it out and it added to the story.
The cinematography is excellent. Beautiful, crisp, clean.

The acting is superb and the characters have depth and personality.  Plots are well developed and believable.  Shaun Evans is awesome as a cerebral former student at Oxford who has a gift for detective work.  Evans portrays this man of few words with great depth and subtlety.

5042616,4,B006ZL84EW,"As a PBS BBC/Masterpiece ""Morse"" fan from decades past, I generally enjoy both the sequel ""Inspector Lewis"" and prequel ""Endeavour"" shows-- with their predictably stacked weekly toll of corpses in Oxfordshire making one feel somehow safe in NYC.

Viewed by means of the Amazon Prime streaming video free month trial, I needed to ""pause"" playback.  After 15 minutes my PC's ""power/screen saver"" had kicked in, before I got back to viewing-- and I found that I was not able to restart that viewing session.  After terminating and restarting my browser the show wouldn't stream properly, hanging on one early frame, with the video strobing.  Ultimately I needed to reboot my PC to correct the problem-- after which the video played flawlessly, but I avoided any further attempt to ""pause"" it.

The audio was loud enough but seemed ""muddy"", making it had to follow the dialog at moments.  Simply turning up the volume didn't help, BUT, when I switched to audiophile quality headphones I discovered that the audio track of this British murder mystery show was very enjoyably produced, with attention to ""realism"" rather than artificial post-production dialog overdub or clarity enhancement.  I.e., when a character mutters something under his/her breath, it sounds like it (while remaining intelligible through audiophile quality equipment.)  Sadly, with the junk many people employ for online and/or especially mobile playback, the artistry of the show's audio track may not be widely experienced or appreciated.

5042632,5,B006ZL84EW,"*Anybody who loved  the Inspector Morse series portrayed by the late John Thaw, do not miss the opportunity to see this movie.  It takes you back to the early years, 1965 to be exact when a very young detective constable  Morse has been ordered to help the police to find a missing girl. At the moment he's at a crossroads with his life and the last thing he wants to do is to return to Oxford.  Being recruited to help and having no choice in the matter, he digs heavy into the investigation. Soon he is noticed by an Inspector Thursday.  He sees that even though he is young, he is also very diligent, has an uncanniness for the truth and refuses to give up even when he's ordered to.  Soon Thursday takes young Morse under his wing and together they hunt down a killer only to bring sadness to Morse but a destiny he could no longer deny!...............I believe whoever sees this movie especially if their Morse fans, will totally enjoy it. His love for opera and old vintage cars, crossword puzzles, of course, and lets not forget why we only know him as Morse?  Could it be that his first name is ""Endeavour""?",1408320000,3,1115,4.409756097560976

I am so glad he has a girlfriend...I think the first time I ever saw him laugh and look truly happy was with her. They seem very content together. I discovered this show last year and was so happy to see it come back in 2014. I wish there were more than 4 episodes per season. I record the show and keep watching it over and over again for clues. Morse is brilliant...can't wait until next year when it comes back! I was devastated when I saw the season finale...I am actually worried about what will happen to him.

5042674,5,B006ZL84EW,"I stumbled across Endeavour on my Amazon Prime using Roku. I had mostly enjoyed Inspector Morse stories and was intrigued by the idea that this show would be about Morse as a young man. Am I glad I decided to watch it! I like it better than Inspector Morse. It feels more rich, more clear, more - well - interesting. The concept of an opera loving detective plays out beautifully in this series. The young Morse is clever and dogged but also very sensitive to others' feelings and his own. Another reason for my high rating is that I can for the most part understand the English dialect. Shaun Evans is superb as the young Detective Constable Morse. I like the stories and the characters and am looking forward to watching Season 2!",1406764800,,732,4.511278195488722

5042676,4,B006ZL84EW,"This is an interesting British crime drama TV show. We've watched the entire series, and have mostly enjoyed it. Characters are interesting. Unfortunately, many of these characters mumble, so that even if you understand the British or Scottish accent, you can't even hear them to understand them.

5042686,5,B006ZL84EW,"This is where the story really begins. You can tell different camera angles are used which renders Shaun Evans, Endeavour, even more thin than he normally appears. Many characters don't make it into the regular series but thankfully Roger Allam, DCI Thursday, does. In the series Thursday is the perfect mentor for Morse. He shares wisdom when needed, is concerned and caring when Morse needs it the most. Morse is very much in need of nurturing and encouragement. Morse has an intuitive, imaginative and sharp mind that fits all the pieces together in their murder investigations which aids Thursday. John Thaw's (the original Inspector Morse - which I somehow never watched) daughter, Abigail Thaw shows up in this pilot and a few references to Morse's future. Thank you goes out to the British for coming up with yet another superb, addictive program to follow for many years - hopefully.",1406678400,3,891,4.9865771812080535

What a beautiful film, the cinematography, the music, the acting, all stunning! Shaun Evans as Morse is brilliant: quiet, introspective, gentle, whip-smart, though suffering from an internal crisis of what to do in his life and career. The beginning of his relationship with Inspector Thursday was a wonderful thing to see. I may not watch this again, but I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a gorgeous and thoughtful film. Loved it!",1406505600,2,587,4.9393939393939394

It is both well acted, believable, a worthy successor and memorable. every episode leaves you with food for thought and a better understanding of not only the characters but where your life might be going. It leaves one with explanations not just questions. This is my guilty pleasure and I have to confess, I have managed to infect my husband as well. We are older people. When one's husband says he enjoyed the hour and a half spent watching the young inspector Morse, and we concur, that equals a great Saturday night.

Those familiar with the John Thaw Inspector Morse series will see hints and nods to the original series, while still being a series that does not require the viewing of the former series to understand the character. Evans give a gripping portrayal as Endeavour, a man searching to find his place. The videography makes great use of the city of Oxford. Highly recommended for all Morse fans as well as those interested in historical mysteries.",1405641600,,484,4.843373493975903

5042737,5,B006ZL84EW,This is very very good too.  Shaun Evans is believable as Morse.  The plots are well written.  I love this series as much as Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries.

5042738,5,B006ZL84EW,"I'm pleased to say that ""Endeavour"" is, certainly in my experience, typical of the British-style detective-mystery-thriller genre, with defined and consistently portrayed characters, (first-rate actors), scripts written for adults, (not the lowest common denominator audience American productions favor), and solutions that only rarely stretch believability.  For those who pine for an engaging time with good guys versus bad guys, an escape from gratuitous sex, violence, and profanity, where respect for the audience's intelligence is evident, and ripping good yarns, then, uh, endeavor with ""Endeavour.""",1405382400,,606,6.214285714285714

Endeavour reminds me of a less cocky, more self effacing Sherlock. His deduction skills would give the consulting detective a run for his money, but he's not cocky or brash about it.

Detective Morse a young exOxford student uses his considerable deductive skills to shed light on the true nature of the crimes he and his colleagues encounter. However, he does this with what the viewer would surmise to be reasonable application of rational thought rather than the near psychic observations Holmes makes. I find the show to be extremely enjoyable and recommend it to anyone who appreciates how the power of the intellect can be an entertaining tool in solving what are sometimes inscrutable crimes.",1404691200,,600,5.195876288659794

5042826,5,B006ZL84EW,"I never have seen the original ""Inspector Morse"" series, but I am a huge fan of the ""Inspector Lewis"" series, and decided to see what Endeavor would be like in comparison.  I found that this seires is equally compelling and as thoughtfully crafted as Inspector Lewis was, and I hope that any future seasons will be available on Amazon Prime.

5042839,4,B006ZL84EW,"For John Thaw fans of Inspector Morse, it has been fun to see where his peculiarities started.  In Endeavour,  we see Detective Constable Morse become that fantastic detective and how he develops all his tricks of the trade.  His co-star and boss is as interesting a character as is Lewis in the earlier series.",1397433600,,311,4.722222222222222
5042840,5,B006ZL84EW,"This one is the first in this British master series.  I think the reason I like these is because the detective is obviously flawed, but still solves the mystery puzzle with flair and idealism of youth.  He brings his history back to Cambridge with him:  class and connections count against him, so there's a hint of social criticism in this puzzle, but it all comes out with justice.",1397347200,,383,4.602941176470588

I will never get enough of the well-crafted British murder-mystery. Apparently I have this in common with the general British populace! Because they keep coming up with new and better. I watched a couple of episodes last night and this morning I had the thought that the actor Shaun Evans has a face made for the screen. The subtleties of his reactions are exquisite, really just so fun to watch. His is NOT the kind of acting that could be as appreciated on stage. Really loved the guy who plays his superior too, also very understated.
Plot lines and writing also excellent. I don't know the books or ""sequel"" show but excited to know there's lots more.",1397260800,,820,4.547297297297297

Another component - his infatuation with an unattainable woman.

Shaun Evans is an excellent young Morse, the period (circa 1965) production values are well done, and the writing is up to par with the earlier series. Looking forward to Season Two.",1393804800,,339,4.3125
5042885,5,B006ZL84EW,"As an American I wasn't exposed to British episodic television. Having since discovered it, I can clearly see where we developed our drama and mystery from. Unfortunately, we took most of the depth from of our television/cinema. We also did a very American thing and made our offerings flashier and more extreme. This is for the most part of course, as American film and television has many powerful stories as well.

Endeavour is an example of the true art of telling stories on film. It has well defined character development, substantial plots, and believability. For the past year thanks to Amazon Prime I have been watching various British programs. Masterpiece does a good job of presenting many of these. It is also neat that some of what I find are continuations of a story that was made decades back. This is the case for Endeavour. There are also a lot of good remakes amongst the British programming I find on Amazon.

I encourage you to watch and enjoy! Be aware that these stories often develop at a slower pace than their American counterparts and may seem slow to you until you are tuned into British foreshadowing.",1393804800,,1130,4.760204081632653

5042887,5,B006ZL84EW,"It's a bloody masterpiece.  I enjoyed every bit of it. Endeavour will take you to the labyrinth of emotion, the sublime feeling of being loved and deceived by the rude desire of a young shabby beauty. She was only 15, and anyone fantasized about her. It was so painful to see such a such young girl became a salient rival of a  pretty married middle age woman,a diva of music,and so respected.

It's worthy to watch Endeavour.",1393632000,,426,4.5064935064935066

5042899,5,B006ZL84EW,"With this series, the ""prequel"" to Inspector Morse and Inspector Lewis, we learn much about the earlier years of Endeavour Morse.  The acting is first rate with so much genuine yet subtle emotion projected from these splendid British actors by the merest glance or raised eyebrow, let alone by their voices.  Fans of the Morse and Lewis series will love all the connections between the three story lines, witnessing how Morse started drinking, his early attitudes towards women, and his early connections with opera and crossword puzzles.  The young Morse is as irascible and at times as socially inept as the older one, but with a very obvious and very touching vulnerable side as well. As always the exquisite musical score by Barrington Phelung adds immeasurably to this viewing experience.  Recommended for anyone who likes complicated, intellectual mysteries, and especially recommended to devoted fans of Morse and Lewis.

I've never watched any Inspector Morse episodes, so the connection between the young Inspector Morse in Endeavor and the old Inspector Morse twenty years later meant nothing to me.  I appreciated this movie on its merits alone, which I understand was the pilot episode for a subsequent short-running series called Endeavor.  The plot and character development were quite interesting, but not toooo convoluted or fast for me to follow, because I get lost with detective movies that are too fast and too complicated -- although this one certainly wasn't simple.  I highly recommend it.",1391990400,,633,5.116504854368932

Love the 60's feel. Shaun Evans is odd enough to be interesting and nice enough to be engaging.

5042995,5,B006ZL84EW,"I love good British murder mysteries, and this one certainly qualifies.  I enjoyed ""Endeavor"" very much.  It's a great whodunnit with all of the requisite characters and elements: an idealistic protagonist seeking clarify of self and purpose while battling the forces of greed and dishonor; an attractive victim victimized on the basis of her youth and her social class; multiple unlikable suspects with motive, and clues that mislead and misdirect the audience.",1389571200,,462,5.402777777777778
5042996,4,B006ZL84EW,"I had never heard of this particular character before, and sat through this wondering where it would all lead. There were some twists, and it seems that some things were, well, not quite choppy as much a slightly disjointed at times. There seemed to be some important items of information left out, which leads me to believe the individual who wrote the review stating that there were scenes cut from the original. Fairly said, it was still an engaging mystery, reaching the bar that ""Masterpiece"" have set for themselves, and I found I rather liked this detective. Young, raw, still 'wet behind the ears' and quite human; I am now just off to find the Morse series of films and/or BBC television shows that air more of this! The creators of Morse have a new fan!",1389484800,,763,4.617647058823529

5042998,5,B006ZL84EW,I have always enjoyed Inspector Morse and later Inspector Lewis.  So this prequel was a delight.  When will there be more?,1389139200,,122,4.761904761904762
5042999,5,B006ZL84EW,"This was a Masterpiece Mystery so I knew it would be good. But it was great! Great acting, dialogue, drama, and a great twist for the who-dun-it! I highly recommend this movie.",1389139200,,176,4.53125
5043000,5,B006ZL84EW,"The story is terrific, and getting some of the Morse back-story is even better. You'll see Morse first as a young man who doesn't drink - doesn't even frequent the pubs. (!) But he always has the inquiring mind and skill at noticing seemingly-random details that help make him a great detective. You'll meet Morse's mentor, DI Thursday, and see how he brings along the callow Morse. Even if you don't love prequels (and with good reason, as many of them are just terrible!), this one is worth watching. The acting is terrific, the writing top-notch, and Oxford is reliably beautiful. Also, keep an eye out for John Thaw's daughter playing an Oxford Mail correspondent!",1389052800,,668,4.817391304347826
5043001,5,B006ZL84EW,"It was good to see Morse committing youthful indiscretions. It made him more ""real"" for me. I plan to watch the rest of this series and would recommend it to all who enjoy period BBC police procedurals. The cars and busses are always a ""bonus"" for me.
The ""orgy"" that some have complained about is soft focused and all the participants were wearing underwear, bottoms at least. It lasts for about 20 seconds and advances the plot. Less titallating than a pop music video or a super bowl halftime show. Bravo to all involved in this production.

The only other police drama this good is the original Swedish ""Wallander"".

Roger Allam as Fred Thursday (Endeavour's supervisor) sees the rough diamond in the former Oxford student that is Endeavour Morse.  The series is meant as a prequel to the Inspector Morse stories.",1385164800,,461,5.301369863013699

5043042,5,B006ZL84EW,"I loved the original Inspector Morse with John Thaw because of the intricate and cerebral quality of the story lines, together with the depth of character both Morse and Lewis have.  I think Endeavour has done an excellent job of maintaining the superior quality of the program and the actor, Shaun Evans, who plays Morse is the perfect choice being most believably the young version of Inspector Morse in both looks and character.  At the end of the program when Endeavour was asked where he thinks he will be in 20 years, I found it an extremely emotional moment when he looked in the rear view mirror and Shaun Evans' reflection was morphed into John Thaw's reflection.  I also love that John Thaw's daughter has a role in the Endeavour series.",1384646400,,747,4.687022900763359

5043049,5,B006ZL84EW,"I watch this show randomly on amazon and have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I had never heard of the original series or its spin-offs so I can not compare, but this show is very well written. Endeavour himself is a very endearing character and you cant help but route for him. The murder mystery in the show is well played out and keeps you guessing until the end. Its hard to find a murder mystery show that is not overly graphic. This show proves that all of that visual stimulation is unnecessary in a well planned show.",1383091200,,528,4.343434343434343

5043062,5,B006ZL84EW,"The fact that hundreds of viewers rank ""Endeavor"" at the highest level (via Amazon) only hints at the quality of ""Endeavor."" As a devoted fan of ""Inspector Morse"" and ""Lewis"" I can assure you that ""Endeavor"" is worthy of your time. Currently running (advancing to the second season) ""Endeavor"" reveals Morse's early days as a compassionate ""copper"" fresh out of the signal corps (deciphering covert code ~ beyond morse, ironically) during WWII. This thought-provoking show (set in the 1960's) features character-driven writing, amazing plots and vivid art direction. It also flashes back to that threshold era when the ""hard boiled copper days"" began to subside under the emergence of sophisticated DNA tracking and psychological profiling. Sean Evans as young Morse breaks your heart with his soulful performance. Roger Allam is riveting as his fatherly, caring mentor DI Fred Thursday (the solid man we learned about in Colin Dexter's novels). You may remember Allam in 1997 as the ambitious academic Denis Cornford in ""Death is Now My Neighbour"" from the ""Inspector Morse"" series. Two ""Endeavor"" episodes, for me, stand out: ""Fugue"" and ""Home."" In ""Fugue"" Morse's passion for opera helps him decode a serial killer's taunting puzzles. A touching scene between Morse and Thursday underscores why, years later, DCI Morse stayed true to the beauty of classical music and opera. We understand just how much young Morse needed the tender embrace of a loving family. ""Home"" takes us back to Morse's roots where we see into the hungry heart of a young man yearning for fatherly understanding and guidance. This episode is rich with gangsters, Playboy era nightclub atmospheres and dark alley politics blurring the line between criminals and coppers. DI Thursday's haunting past and the lengths a father will go to protect his family contrast with Morse's stark boyhood. We also see how the friendship developed between young Morse and beat cop Strange. Strange would later become Morse's blustery boss. A ""superior"" who, although seemingly filled with scold and scoff, deeply respected Morse's mind and would eventually mourn his death like no other (aside from Lewis). ""Endeavor"" grabs us by the heart and throat, only to stay embedded within our own psyches long after the credits roll.",1381708800,3,2284,5.226158038147139

Evans not only didn't look like a young Morse, but didn't sound like him, didn't walk like him, there was no physical resemblance at all.  I think he tried hard for some of the mannerisms, but they didn't really come across either.

Great story, well done and a great who done it.",1378339200,,482,4.404494382022472
5043115,4,B006ZL84EW,"My wife and I enjoyed this video, although I liked it better than my wife and I expect that if she were doing the reviewing, she would rate it one star less.  For myself, I liked the notion of the prequel to the inspector Morris series.",1378339200,,236,4.130434782608695
5043116,4,B006ZL84EW,"At first I was quite skeptical about an effort to prequel Inspector Morse, John Thaw's performance as Morse was so strong and I could never see anyone else in that role.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to see Shaun Evans' performance and the Endeavour script pay homage to John's Morse in so many ways.  I would love to see the rest of the series and hope it comes to Amazon Prime streaming soon!",1378339200,,401,4.47945205479452

5043118,5,B006ZL84EW,"This seems like a natural ""continuation"" of the Morse/Lewis series.  The acting is wonderful and it's very intelligently done, as were Morse and Lewis.",1378339200,,151,5.291666666666667
5043119,5,B006ZL84EW,I'd really love to see more of this series.  Shaun Evans was wonderful as a young police detective in the early 60s.,1378339200,,116,4.2727272727272725
5043120,4,B006ZL84EW,"As a fan of the original Morse series, I find it interesting to see Morse when he first started out, his interest in Jaguars, beer and opera. The show is well acted, entertaining and has many of the same characteristics as the original. With his first name Endeavor, it is easy to see why he was called only Morse.",1378252800,,314,4.338983050847458
5043121,5,B006ZL84EW,I'm a fan of Inspector Morse.  Enjoyed watching the show when he was a seasoned detective and am enjoying watching him now as a novice inspector.,1378252800,,145,4.576923076923077
5043122,4,B006ZL84EW,One of my favorite British mystery series was Inspector Morse.  This shows him has a young man showing how he became himself.,1378252800,,125,4.681818181818182

5043125,5,B006ZL84EW,"I quite enjoyed this ""prequel"" and look forward to further episodes of exploring the early Morse. The acting is quite good, and the plot leaves you guessing. I was certainly surprised.",1377993600,,184,4.967741935483871
5043126,5,B006ZL84EW,"I love the original Morse so when I heard they were doing a series with Morse as a young man I was a little skeptical. No need to be. This is an excellent series, exceptionally cast. It's fun to see some of the ""older"" characters (like Morse's boss Strange) as younger folks and where they figured into his life early on.

Shaun Evans is wonderful as Morse. He's captured one or two movements that make you feel comfortable with the character immediately, without overdoing it. It's as if he has captured Morse's signature moves and expressions at their birth so that you can envision them becoming part of the man as he grows older.

Very well done. I'll probably stream the heck out of it but still buy the series.",1377993600,,716,4.5
5043127,4,B006ZL84EW,"Shaun Evans does a fine job as the young Morse, a  great relief to the many fans of the late John Thaw's creation which graced  our television screens for so long and remains a lasting monument to the quality of BBC television products exported to the United States and to the Public Broadcasting System stations who gave it a home over here.
The remainder of the cast as well as the writer and Director must also be complimented  for maintaining the standard of quality which characterized the Thaw years. In every respect the  production should satisfy those who enjoy the quiet pacing of shows like Morse,  Poirot, and other dramatizations of works by the authors of the Classic British mystery which still resonates with the public decades after the death of most of its  practitioners.
Those accustomed to the very rapid bang, bang, slam,  smash style which is so well handled in the contemporary American action-thriller may not find the pace to their taste (as has been true of  some of the friends to whom I have lent DVD's containing classic style mysteries); that is a legitimate source of rejection. I would only urge them to give it a try, then, if not, then not. Aficionados can rest assured that they are getting what they have a right to expect.",1377907200,,1260,4.695454545454545
5043128,4,B006ZL84EW,"This shows the detective as an intimidated newcomer right out of school, and his intuitive insight and observation skills which become very useful later.",1377907200,,153,5.416666666666667
5043129,5,B006ZL84EW,"I enjoyed this production of a young Morse very much.  The older Morse was never humble nor appeared capable of humility but Evans in the role of a young Morse manages to make it believable that he didn't lack those qualities as a young man.  This production is very true to the book but little mention is made of the reason why he left Oxford -- a relationship that destroyed his confidence and his heart.  Morse as the older DCI was never successful at love and made terrible, almost laughable, choices in his pursuit of romance -- and he does here too.  I loved the original Morse and watched the entire series again a couple of years ago.  I miss Morse and I miss John Thaw.  Thaw was a wonderful actor and I liked that his daughter had a small role in this production.",1377820800,,773,4.333333333333333

5043131,5,B006ZL84EW,"The characters are complex and intriguing. Story line is clever and surprising. It is so good to see Morse's character developing, with all his faults he is just so brilliant. This certainly showed why he is like he is.",1377820800,,219,4.641025641025641
5043132,5,B006ZL84EW,Loved the original Morse series. Am serious fan of the Inspector Lewis series.  Endeavour does not disappoint.  Can't wait for more. Enjoy!!,1377734400,,140,5.318181818181818
5043133,4,B006ZL84EW,This movie was pretty good. I watch a lot of movies and I like a movie that grabs my attention within the first 10 - 15 minutes. While I have seen movies that I thought were better this one did grab me and held my attention. If you want a movie that entertains but don't feel like having to use all your brain cells to keep up then I think you might like this one.,1377734400,,364,3.8666666666666667

5043136,5,B006ZL84EW,I think this series is one of the best ever on Masterpiece Mystery. Shaun Evans is exceptional as Endeavour Morse and all the cast is excellent as well. I look forward to all the episodes in this brilliant series.,1377734400,,213,4.487179487179487
5043137,5,B006ZL84EW,"You must love the fact that Morse is a successful series. Inspector Lewis is a successful series, so what do you do?
Go to the beginning. Go to Morse when he is a new copper, taking his exams, and thought of as a strange duck.
Go to the fact that he does not drink. He thinks like no one else and instead of being appreciated, he gets served up a real hard time. I love this back story, the beginning. Why Morse s the way he is.
The writing is really good. It is fluid, logical, surprising and intelligent.
The choice of actors is perfect. That helps. Watch Endeavour.",1377734400,,568,4.220183486238532
5043138,5,B006ZL84EW,"A top-notch mystery/detective program.  Love the stories, the actors, the location!  I would recommend this show to anyone who likes a GOOD mystery.",1377734400,,148,5.391304347826087
5043139,4,B006ZL84EW,Great Prequel to the Morse series that will appeal to fans but also those not familiar with the PBS /BBC mystery classic,1377648000,,120,4.5

5043141,5,B006ZL84EW,Since we love inspector Lewis we love this.  It is fun to follow their lives and stories.  Clean and entertaining.,1377648000,,114,4.65
5043142,5,B006ZL84EW,"To be honest, I have never seen an Inspector Morse mystery all the way through. I've only dabbled, but I am a fan of BBC mystery series because, frankly, they are much more fun and better written than much of the formula mysteries pumped out on American TV.

So why pick this mystery? I heard about the Inspector Morse mysteries and thought, why not start at the beginning, even if it is not really the beginning. So I went in with no pre-conceived notions and I was quite taken with the setting and with the characters.

A young Morse is thinking of leaving the force when he is swept up into a missing persons case that evolves into a murder investigation, then a suicide, then. . . another twist, another new theory.

I liked that I saw a young man who was intelligent, cultured and willing to stick his neck out for the truth despite the opposition from more senior police. Yet, he wasn't just the young gun against the system, but a young man who wasn't as caught up in trying to prove himself as he was in solving the puzzle. Yes, he seemed to care about the victim and he had his own foibles that I'm sure were part of the original series. The mystery was solid, the acting excellent and the potential to make this a series on its own was there, although I have no idea if that was the intent or not. The young Morse is likeable and his initial quandary about leaving the force is clearly answered in the last few minutes as he unravels the mystery.

Young Morse becomes emotionally involved in the case, not in a way that compromises his morals or ethics, but in such a way that gives us a glimpse into his character and his background. If straddling that fine line is one of the hallmarks of the Inspector Morse series, I really want to see the series now.",1377561600,,1765,4.33939393939394
5043143,4,B006ZL84EW,We really like this series - has the analysis component that shows how a crime is solved and that we find interesting.  The biggest problem is understanding what is being said.  The talk is fast paced and several English accents that are hard to hear.  Unfortunately some of the episodes do not have subtitles.  Even with subtitles it is hard to keep up because the characters speak so fast.,1377561600,,391,4.6231884057971016
5043144,5,B006ZL84EW,Watch this along with the PBS episodes if you're curious about the back-story for Inspector Morse. It is entertaining and delightful!,1377561600,,133,5.380952380952381
5043145,5,B006ZL84EW,Watched this one on AMAZON due to missing it in the PBS series.  Actually liked this better than the original Morse.,1377561600,,116,4.523809523809524
5043146,4,B006ZL84EW,It was fun too see a story behind the story of this somewhat dysfunctional detective.  I look forward to more prequills.,1377475200,,120,4.714285714285714
5043147,5,B006ZL84EW,"This is such an intelligent, beautifully acted show. We have loved Morse and Lewis and this is just as wonderful. Masterpiece Mystery is just a treasure. I don't know how they keep coming up with such terrific writing and actors, but they do. We are the lucky ones! Keep it coming!",1377475200,,281,4.529411764705882
5043148,4,B006ZL84EW,Very good job of keeping the franchise alive with a prequel. A little too much play on the emotions of returning to Oxford. Great production design.,1377388800,,148,4.730769230769231
5043149,5,B006ZL84EW,I'd give this six stars or more.  Shaun Evans does a young John Thaw perfectly.  I hope there are more of these to come.,1377388800,,120,3.9583333333333335
5043150,5,B006ZL84EW,"If you like the new ""Sherlock"" series, you will enjoy ""Endeavor."" It is witty, smart, and yet has a ""sherlockian"" flair. Shaun Evans has come into his own as the character, Endeavor.",1377388800,,182,4.71875
5043151,1,B006ZL84EW,"Perfect movie if you love extremely slow-paced, mediocre crime dramas. This movie was placed in the ""thriller"" section of Amazon instant video and it is anything but. Amateur acting, amateur directing - what a bore! I cannot believe all the hype and high marks this movie received. I felt compelled to write this review to hopefully balance out some of the fanatical praise this movie has received. I can only hope that this review prevents one, just one, person from wasting an hour and a half of their life on this.",1377302400,4,517,4.6923076923076925
5043152,3,B006ZL84EW,I was pretty disappointed.  The worst part is the insult made toward Morse. Sean Evans is either a really bad actor or Colm McCarthy is a really bad director.,1377216000,,158,4.448275862068965
5043153,5,B006ZL84EW,"Seeing the beginnings of this marvelous character were so satisfying; Inspector Morse has always been a man I could have loved.. had he been real! To witness him as a young man, his lack of confidence, the antagonistic attitude toward his methodology, enabled me to view his character as complete..
The last scene, where he looks into the rear view mirror and sees himself as the Inspector Morse we all have come to know and love, was just so perfect!!!",1377216000,,453,4.675
5043154,5,B006ZL84EW,This is a great new series.  I think they did a splendid job in giving Inspector Morse a past. Can't wait for the next chapters.,1377216000,,128,4.12
5043155,5,B006ZL84EW,"As a huge fan of John Thaw's Morse, I shunned Endeavor at my first sort through available videos.  However, today I took the plunge and am I glad I did.  I hope they do lots more of these and that John Thaw's daughter is given a recurring role - loved that little exchange between her and young DC Morse.  No one does mysteries better than the Brits and this is absolutely on equal footing with the Morse we already know and love.  Bravissimo!",1377216000,,443,4.301204819277109

5043157,5,B006ZL84EW,The casting is so good. The sense of the time period is very effective. The scriptwriting and the direction is as good as Morse and Lewis. Very well done. Bless those Brits.,1377129600,,173,4.4375
5043158,5,B006ZL84EW,Very well done. Excellent introduction to the Morse series - rounds out the early history and beginnings of Inspector Morse. Highly recommended to all Morse lovers.,1377129600,,164,5.346153846153846
5043159,5,B006ZL84EW,"I am a fan of Inspector Morse (the elder). I liked his character, the setting in Oxford and the nature of the ""mysteries"". So I watched ""young Morse""  but expected it to be less interesting than the old series. I was pleasantly surprised. This episode provided some interesting character development and presented  an interesting story that did not end with some strange twist that I could not have anticipated. I am looking forward to more.",1377043200,,441,4.866666666666666

5043161,5,B006ZL84EW,"My hubby and I are huge fans of the British mini-series genre and this particular series is one of our favorites.  The acting is so outstanding, sometimes we feel as if we are watching a real event, rather than a scripted production.  In particular, Shaun Evans and Roger Allam simply shine in their roles.  As a ""prequel"" to Inspector Morse, this series does a brilliant job laying the foundation for the lonely and somewhat bitter ""mature"" Inspector Morse.  Highly recommended.",1377043200,,479,4.95
5043162,5,B006ZL84EW,This is a deeply engaging story.  Morse has to deal with a woman who exposed him to great beauty through her incredible singing but also the heartbreak of arresting her for the murder of two people because of her husband's cruelty and her desire to hold on to his love at any cost.  This is one of those movies that one must see several times to gather in all the details.  I bought the first season of Morse because this series is so good.,1376956800,,440,4.214285714285714

5043164,5,B006ZL84EW,"I had low expectations, but was very pleasantly surprised. Well written, well acted and Oxford still a great character in the story. Enjoyed the retrosepctive, Morses car on the lot, and the ending tribute to John Thaw was touching.",1376956800,,232,4.9743589743589745

5043169,4,B006ZL84EW,"Very interesting.  Story seems to be essentially same as some other one in the broad series, perhaps a relatively recent Inspector Lewis with Hathaway sidekick.

What a happy surprise to discover Endeavour!  Endeavour is the precursor to the Inspector Morse series, showing Morse's early years as a young police officer back in the early 1960s.  Shaun Evans is fantastic in this role and I hope this series continues for many seasons.",1376697600,,543,4.684210526315789

5043187,5,B006ZL84EW,"A lot of people have lauded this movie for reminding them of Inspector Morse, the beloved British inspector from the long-running TV series of which this is a prequel.  I'm sad to say I've never seen any of the Inspector Morse episodes, though I do plan to rent some soon out of curiosity, having seen this.  I have seen Inspector Lewis, its follow-up.  This was even better than Inspector Lewis.  Still set in Oxford (oh my!  How many people are murdered in Oxford in a year?  This would have you believe multitudes) it's a complex, cerebral mystery with great settings, and interesting characters.  I think Shaun Evans creates a provocative character and I've already watched the four episodes that were released the following year as the Endeavour series.  He's quirky, awkward and pained.  He's also fascinating and charismatic.  Highly recommended.",1376438400,,853,5.0285714285714285
5043188,5,B006ZL84EW,Great actor who plays the main character. Series does a great job of recreating the time period! Enjoy the story lines also.,1376438400,,124,4.681818181818182
5043189,4,B006ZL84EW,"I'd passed this one over several times thinking ""No, not a young Morse, what are they thinking"" ... It started out not too convincing but grew on me as he began to find his stride so to speak.
I liked it and plan to watch it again soon to pick up things I might have missed.",1376438400,,274,3.9107142857142856
5043190,4,B006ZL84EW,"Inspector Morse is a young Police Inspector who is tasked with various thankless tasks during a murder investigation. His cognitive abilities rapidly move him into being noticed by higher ups, and involvement with antagonistic members of the local Community, Politicians and Law Enforcement. During the course of the play the Inspector is involved in various interactions with suspects. Watch the show, I can't go into detail without spoiling the surprise end.",1376438400,,460,5.492957746478873

5043193,5,B006ZL84EW,"This show, which my husband and I happened upon by accident, has become one of our fast favorites. The writing is superb, the development of each case is intriguing and surprising, and the acting (especially by Shaun Evans, playing Morse) is really well done. The show is subtle - I mean, not as ""commercial"" as say, Sherlock (which we also love)- but that is such a great thing. We love, love and appreciate this show.
Also, if you're thinking of watching and might have a background in musicology or vocal music, you'll love this. There are multiple references to music and operas which I am just delighted to find. Having never seen Inspector Morse, I'm not sure if this is a given.",1376265600,,685,4.622950819672131
5043194,5,B006ZL84EW,"This was a great prequel to a series that I loved from my first ""Morse.""  The seemingly slow start was really a good character development for our old friend as a young man.

There is enough ""teasing"" in questions left unanswered to really take this series of our beloved Morse from his time as a young man through his cases and his promotions; filling in just who our ""Oxford educated Inspector"" really was and how he became the, shall we say, disillusioned, even cynical, short-tempered, observant, intelligent, type-A inspector we all grew to love.",1376265600,,551,4.851063829787234

Follows (or prequels, I suppose!) Inspector North so well in forn and in direction- both great!

5043199,5,B006ZL84EW,I have watched all of the Morse mysteries and Inspector Lewis mysteries.  So I consider myself a fan.  I really enjoyed Endeavour.  It explains a lot about how Morse turned out to be how he is.,1376092800,,193,4.305555555555555
5043200,5,B006ZL84EW,Being a huge fan of the original Morse series I really wanted this movie which initiated the new series of Morse to be successful and it certainly did not disappoint. The acting is superb by both characters playing the young Morse and his weathered tough boss who guides and supports the intelligent and  usually unconventional deductive methods of the young Morse. Can't wait to see more and more and more of Morse young and old.,1376092800,,430,4.733333333333333

5043203,5,B006ZL84EW,"Having watched the Morse series from the beginning, and relishing the spin-off of Lewis, I was delighted to see the Endeavour series.  Morse was always a fascinating character, and it was wonderful to see the early days of his life and career in this Masterpiece Mystery series.  The late John Thaw was brilliant in the role, and I wondered how another actor would do stepping into his shoes.  Shaun Evans more than met my expectations as the young Endeavour Morse.  His performance is reminiscent of Thaw's Morse, but he has made it his very own.  Evans is able to convey so much with just his facial expressions, and he aptly demonstrates the intelligence, temperament, aesthetics, and social awkwardness of Morse.  This show and the first season series are so well written and acted that I wondered how it got on tv.  Most of today's programming is insipid, crass, and void of any creativity.  Endeavour is a marvelous oasis in this wasteland, and proves that quality television still exists somewhere.  Roger Allam is wonderful as Morse's mentor, Fred Thursday, and it was great to see John Thaw's daughter, Abigail, as the newspaper editor.  It's also fun trying to spot Morse author, Colin Dexter, in the Morse, Lewis, and now, Endeavour series.

I was moved to tears by two scenes. One is when Endeavour first encounters the Abigail Thaw character.  She asks if they have met before as he looks familiar, but he tells her that he doesn't think so.  She replies, ""Well, maybe in another life.""  The other scene is when Thursday asks Endeavour where he thinks he'll be in 20 years.  We see Endeavour looking in the rear view mirror and watch his face morph into that of John Thaw as the Morse music theme begins.  Really moving.  I think John Thaw would be very pleased with this endeavour.

Note:  Season 2 with 4 more episodes has been ordered due to the great audience response to this program.",1376092800,,1902,4.7439024390243905

Endeavour's quirky, sometimes brusque personality fits with a young intellect who lives so much within his head.  The plots were well-developed and kept the viewer engaged from start to finish.

The story held my attention and kept me guessing until the end. I'm definitely going to begin watching Inspector Morse and look forward to reading the books.

If you're a fan of Masterpiece as I am then I recommend you watch this show. If you've never watched Masterpiece on PBS then I suggest starting with this program.  If you have Amazon Prime you can watch it for free.  I also recommend Inspector Lynley (watched all the shows and read all the books), Prime Suspect (Helen Mirren is Excellent), Vera . . .

5043221,5,B006ZL84EW,"My wife made me watch this at first. She told me that if I like the new BBC version of Sherlock I would like this too. I do like the new BBC Sherlock so I watched it with her. To be honest at first I was a little bored. It doesn't have much style or flash, I guess because it takes place in the 60's (The part of the 60's that was so boring it really was part of the 50's.) Slowly I became intrigued and thoroughly engrossed in the story. It moves slow and as I mentioned earlier does not have much style, but the way the different stories that at first I didn't think connected began to mesh together I ended up not getting up and using the toilet even though I really needed to. Fortunately my wife is very smart and she paused it for me. Really the only way this show is like Sherlock is that the main character Endeavour is very smart and sees the details and connections the others miss or ignore. The difference is that Endeavour has empathy and is not a sociopath like Sherlock. I highly recommend this show to people who like mysteries or British television. In fact I have been recording all the episodes as they appear on PBS.",1375833600,,1136,4.191780821917808

5043242,5,B006ZL84EW,This is the pilot for the series.  Watched it on our prime.  This gives the history of the young Morse's career with the police.  Actually liked this series better than the old Morse one.  Great acting and you realize that his character is quirky from the beginning.  Definitely liked his boss DI Fred Thursday and have a great respect for this man.  If you watch the series Thursday is able to see that Morse can link clues and come to a correct conclusion on the murders and takes Morse under his wing.  Morse is a thinker and is able to solve these murders for he does research and thinks outside the box.  Am watching this series on PBS and wish Amazon would add the series to prime $0.00.  There are so many great Masterpiece Mysteries that Amazon doesn't have availabe at prime no cost.  Wish they would change their policy for we have already seen them on PBS and would like to watch them again.  Two other items: Morse sees his future car and at the end he looks in the rear view mirror and sees.....Can't tell you for it will be a spolier if I do.

Suffice it to say, ""Endeavour"" may be superior to the original!  I love John Thaw, but Shaun Evans certainly holds his own. BQC",1374710400,,288,4.5
5043261,5,B006ZL84EW,I love watching the Inspector Morse series. I still haven't seen all of them so I have been buying the DVDs from Amazon. But I think I like Endeavour even better than Inspector Morse. It's nice to see the younger character before he became so crotchety but still definitely showing he's an independent thinker. And you wouldn't have to know a thing about Inspector Morse to enjoy this show. I also like Inspector Thursday. Reminds me of the hard-boiled detective from the 40s movies.,1374710400,,483,4.761904761904762
5043262,5,B006ZL84EW,Hope to see more of the Endeavor movie series. I watched this at least twice. I like to watch detective movies.,1374624000,,111,4.333333333333333
5043263,4,B006ZL84EW,"This BBC delving into the early life of ""Inspector Morse"" is long on mood and short on action.  The effort is dark, filled with enough bodies to make Freddy Kreuger smile. If you are interested in seeing a humorless, self absorbed character analyze clues while others around him are poo pooing his efforts, ENDEAVOUR is for you. I found it interesting, but it's definitely NOT everyone's cup of tea.",1374624000,,399,4.782608695652174
5043264,5,B006ZL84EW,"Love this prequel introducing Endeavour Morse before he became just 'Morse.'  The Brits seem to be focused on recreating the 50's and 60's in many of their serial dramas (Call the Midwife, George Gently, The Bletchley Circle, etc) and they do a bang up job of it. Thoroughly enjoyable.",1374624000,,285,4.816326530612245

5043271,5,B006ZL84EW,"This prequel to the Inspector Morse stands alone.  Really enjoy the period piece - the time frame is about the same as Mad Men.  This single episode is worth a look, as is the series on Masterpiece running now...",1374451200,,212,4.410256410256411

5043273,5,B006ZL84EW,If you are a who done it? fan this is one of the best written mysteries to come along in a while.  Clues abound but are very very subtle.  It is not one of the many mundane efforts that plague TV but a true detective masterpiece.  There are plot twists galore and the hero actually makes a mistake once in a while proving that he is human.,1374451200,,339,4.029850746268656
5043274,5,B006ZL84EW,"Inspector Morse has long been a favorite, and he seems to have vanished from the TV waves, so it was great to see this look back at the young Inspector Morse  - with, of course, all the fine acting, good writing and production values that we have come to expect from this series. If you like a good mystery, one that requires you to think a little, you'll love this one.",1374451200,,370,4.211267605633803

5043278,5,B006ZL84EW,"My husband and I have always been fans of all the great fictional British and European detectives that have appeared through out the years, and Inspector Morse has been a favorite.  This new series of Morse in his youthful first days at the Yard enthralled us!

Shaun Evans was certainly the right actor chosen to play young Morse.  Evans portrayal is top notch.  He not only makes you believe that HE IS young Morse, but that HE WILL become that mature Morse that we all grew to love.  Evans brings forth the intelligence, doggedness, terrific deductive skills, and most importantly, the COMPASSION of C. I. Morse.

Needless to say we will continue collecting this series, which is the ""missing half"" of the life of a dearly loved fictional detective hero.

We certainly recommend it!",1374364800,,785,4.813432835820896

5043282,5,B006ZL84EW,"This episode begins to reveal the beginnings of DI Morse. A young idealistic enthusiastic detective so different from the Morse of later years. A much more sympathetic  Morse. The disappointments of later years have not worn him down.
His love of opera is a joy to him not a refuge. I truly enjoyed it.",1374364800,,302,4.592592592592593
5043283,4,B006ZL84EW,"I love English mysteries.  Not a great fan of Inspector Morse.  Decided to watch this because too hot outside.  Really like young Morse and the relationship between Morse and Thursday.  Sometimes it is hard to understand the dialogue due to accents and muted sound.  Do not like the way it is introduced with credits alternating with opening scenes, find it very distracting",1374105600,,374,4.967741935483871

5043285,5,B006ZL84EW,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this Morse prequel. Well done 60's period piece plus telling information about how Morse started out and the painful events that made him so impatient, brooding and solitary. Only able to lose himself in classical music and many pints of his favorite beer. Are the best sleuths damaged souls, obsessed with death and the human condition, always searching but never finding peace? And, of course, we know know why he loves his red jag!",1374019200,,467,4.85

5043287,1,B006ZL84EW,I am sick to death of the in-your-face gross x-rated behavior so many movies throw at you.  This one opens up in the first 5 minutes with 2 guys casually playing a board game while an orgy is going on the background--give me a break.  This is the gratuitous grotesquery that caused me to give up going out to movies for a about 10 years.,1374019200,14,337,4.1692307692307695
5043288,5,B006ZL84EW,Gave me a good background for viewing the new Masterpiece Mysteries series. I'm getting much better understanding the British accents. Great story and I would recommend it highly if you like British mystery storys!,1374019200,,214,5.323529411764706
5043289,5,B006ZL84EW,"The makers of Endeavor succeed beyond expectations, building a past for the eponymous Morse.  A minor girl goes missing and a young man is found dead of suicide.  Rookie Morse uses his incomplete university education to unravel the mysteries and establish himself with his department superior.  The origin of his tastes for opera, beer, the classics and Jaguar motorcars are seamlessly interwoven throughout.  A must see for fans of Morse.  You won't be disappointed.",1373932800,,467,5.256756756756757
5043290,5,B006ZL84EW,"The Endeavour series is one of the best detective shows and I love this version of a young Inspector Morse just learning the ropes and showing how smart he always was.  Right now it's kind of annoying the way some of his superiors treat him, as if he doesn't have a brain and expect him to be wrong all the time.  But, I know eventually as the series continues he will show them that he is a truly gifted detective and better than all the rest.  It's a fun series.",1373932800,,464,4.133333333333334
5043291,4,B006ZL84EW,Oxford is a perfect place to illustrate the contrast between calm academia and the ugliness of murder.  Endeavour does that at least as well as the old Inspector Morse series and the newer Lewis series.,1373932800,,202,4.771428571428571

As I just saw that it is now being cast as a series.  This also makes me want to watch the original ""Morse"".  I have heard much about the character through the series, ""Inspector Lewis"", starring Kevin Whatley who also does a remarkable job.  You will not feel your time wasted by watching this show as all!",1373846400,,474,4.269662921348314

5043299,5,B006ZL84EW,Enjoyed the way they brought young Morse story to life. Note the very end and young Morse looking in rear view mirror. The next installment was even better. Looking forward to the 3 rd one (2nd in this season). Have a pint or a cuppa and enjoy!,1373587200,,244,4.212765957446808

Of course Endeavour is a fitting given name for such an earnest young man.  Like all British mysteries, the plot is a bit complicated with unexpected twists and turns.  That makes it all the more enjoyable. I look forward now to the rest of the series.",1373414400,,388,4.5

For those of you familiar with the Inspector Morse (I am not), this is a ""prequel"".  It begins with his career in Oxford.  The intro is interesting as it makes no sense but is gradually revealed as the story evolves.

Interesting characters and plot - enough so that I am recording and watching the actual series.",1373414400,,439,4.64935064935065

Not sure yet if I like this character.  He seems to mumble quite a bit, and with no closed captioning on this movie (unless you view it on a DVD) it's hard to follow -- I like to use my iPad to stream to my TV.

5043318,5,B006ZL84EW,"Loved it.  Same beautiful Oxford  - made more beautiful by becoming a period setting.  Seeing the young Morse gradually becoming the older man is moving.  His older mentor has many of the characteristics of the John Thaw incarnation of Morse and pays homage to this. Loved it.  See it if you liked Morse.  See it if you like detective fiction and you didn't.  See it if you have dreams of an England which sadly no longer exists, but should.  See it if you believe in moral judgments, not relativism.",1373068800,,500,4.53932584269663

5043355,4,B006ZL84EW,"Anyone who was a fan of John Thaw's 'Inspector Morse' was heartbroken when in the last episode of the series he died. And, then, in real life, John Thaw died soon after.  'Inspector Morse' was to me, the irrefutable detective of the BBC Mystery, well wrought, well written, so well acted and, we grew to love the irascible Morse. It was a joy to watch his episodes, and the series continues strong today.

In 2012, someone thought to write a show about the young Inspector Morse.  Morse, is an Oxford dropout, returning when he's temporarily assigned to the Oxford branch, taking part in an ongoing investigation surrounding the disappearance of a 15-year-old girl. The old Morse loved Oxford, crossword puzzles and opera. Working by himself, for the most part, he finds clues others have missed. Just like the Morse of old. Detective Inspector Fred Thursday recognizes young Morse's talents, and, others are upset with this newcomer.

Shaun Evans plays the young Morse, and what a job well done! I was a little leery at first, but the young Morse grew on me. He had the same qualities we loved in the old Morse. The love of cars, the opera and pretty women. His job is his life, but he has some very beautiful women friends.  I will look forward to the next series.

Two murders where the dead bodies are shown.  Some perverted sexual content (not shown) about a situation portrayed while trying to solve the murder case.  So caution to parents.  I would not let my children under the age of 15 or 16 watch this movie.  But this was not a gory detective movie, like most movies on the market today.  All blood and guts!

When I finished the series I wanted more, but found Inspector Morse too gritty and unkind for my current frame of mind. I stumbled upon Endevour and found it charming. Morse is both fleshed out and played well, and even if the viewer is unacquainted with his older self--the story of not only a murder but a young man's character development and how he learns his craft is charming and highly entertaining.

I particularly enjoyed the cameo by Abigail Thaw, John's daughter, and the fun reference when she (playing the newspaper editor) asks Morse his name and says she feels they've met before; when she smiles the family resemblance to the original Morse is apparent. I also liked the ending, when the young Morse looks into the car's rearview mirror and sees the image of himself twenty years later.

His compadres reject him or mock him but he is too much in his brain decrypting the clues to pay any attention.  His love of opera is complete as is his rejection of anything that does not fit into his proscribed life.  You see the beginnings of a life that can be predicted to be painful and that is hard.

5043398,5,B006ZL84EW,"The PBS Masterpiece Mystery ""Endeavor"" (a ninety-90- minute presentation on one -1- disc) is a superbly written, directed and acted mystery.  On the surface, it tells the story of Inspector Morse's beginnings giving the viewing audience a peep into Morse's ""early years"" (being a moody ""drop out"" student) as a constable  detective with his love of opera (one hears a lot of Puccini's music on the soundtrack), forming his love of Stout Ales,  vintage cars (the British  Jaguar model) and  longing after beautiful and talented women while fighting  the establishment with its corrupt officials and police/detective personnel.

As I have indicated above this presentation is acted superbly.  Sean Evans portrayal of a young Morse is ""spot on"".  I am sure that John Thaw (the older Morse seen in many wonderful episodes) would have been very pleased with Sean's acting skills.

In conclusion, if you want to see a great mystery about a young girl's murder a questionable suicide, and illicit sexual  ""carryings on"" by trusted public figures plus learning how Inspector Morse got his start, buy this disc--it's marvelous entertainment.

i realize that this ""masterpiece"" is based, to a point, on actual newspaper headlines from  the 1960's, so the content was not unexpected. what WAS unexpected was the unspoken question introduced by 'the choice' offered to one who considered himself above the law.

Therefore for me, this installment was both a stand-alone episode and an introduction. After viewing, I must say I was very pleased. Certainly, I can see where some time was spent building the character of the young Morse, probably introducting traits that are hallmarks of the character in the original episodes. From my perspective, I thought the overall characterization was very well done, particularly because the acting was also superb. I like shows with moderate pacing to the story and ""Endeavour"" delivers this nicely, in portions that string along gradually to unveil the action and the mystery. I loved the Oxford setting and the time period in which this mystery takes place (1965). Without giving away spoilers, all I can say is that some of the lines of reasoning that Morse follows are clever and the final payoff of the ending is bittersweet and appropriate. I hope they make more of these early Inspector Morse episodes, but I'm also now inspired to watch the original series.",1348099200,,1142,4.984293193717278

""Endeavor"" provided me with answers to many of the questions raised over the years that continued to linger in the back of my mind, and helped me to appreciate these other two series even more.  The acting is superb throughout and the story gripping from the first moment.  I love the cameo by John Thaw's daughter Abigail, when she meets Endeavor and questions why he seems familiar to her.  Her closing line, ""Another life then"", is a brilliant, though brief homage to her dead father.

Moody and atmospheric with great attention to period detail, this story left me pondering how individual will combines with the quirks of fate to make us what we become.

I had no difficulty believing the young detective played convincingly by Evans would--or at least could-- eventually become ""Inspector Morse.""  But I also found Evans' character rich and complex in his own right.  And I want to see more.

The story is studded with sly asides to the mature Morse--e,g., his fascination with crossword puzzles and Jaguars--all of which are deftly integrated into the plot.  But I must repeat that I want to watch Sean Evans grow into his character in ways that are all his own.  I want the opportunity to re-imagine Morse by giving him an intriguing, believable past.  I wonder how much more deeply we might--or might not (!) come to love and appreciate our adult friends and lovers, let alone fictional characters, if we could watch glimpses of these people's past lives stream by us like video clips ...

It's an invigorating restart to what I hope will be another long running intelligent crime series. Shaun Evans is picture-perfect as a young Morse and the remaining cast is at the top of their game.

Loved the broadcast, though it seemed a bit confusing. Now I know why.

This DVD runs 103 minutes (the back of the case says ""running time: approximately 98 minutes"").
PBS's Masterpiece Mystery runs 90 minutes.
When you subtract the time devoted to introductions and the previews of next week's show, PBS had about 82 minutes of Morse.

PBS chopped out 21 minutes: 1 in every 5 minutes just vanished into the ether.
This is not careful editing. More like wholesale vandalism.

5043445,5,B006ZL84EW,"Even if you haven't seen the Inspector Morse series (which you should because they are such great stories), ""Endeavour"" stands on its own two feet as a good mystery story.  But for fans of Inspector Morse, the film is a real treat and a great way to bring the beloved character so brilliantly played by John Thaw back to life.  Shaun Evans who plays the young detective constable with the odd first name does an excellent job bringing Morse to life.  I have a feeling that both he and the writers studied all of the Morse episodes to get the mannerisms and bits and pieces of characterization of Morse the person down right. And Roger Allam, who plays Morse's ""guv'nor"" Inspector Thursday very well too creating a gruff but kindly mentor for the young detective constable who would become a legend in the fictional world created by the films and novels as well as in the minds of their avid viewers and readers.

As for the plot of the film, I won't say more than two things (neither of them spoilers).  It is certainly a story of the same style as the Morse films.  The only flaw is that one tangent involving a high ranking government official has a preposterous, James Bond-ish ending.  I was tempted to give the film four stars because of that but because I liked the rest of the story so much, I decided not to.

Oh, and it was nice to hear the familiar theme music that ended the Morse films at the very end of ""Endeavour.""

So if you're a Morse fan, see it and revel in it.  And if you're not, see it and the Morse films.  You won't regret it.",1343433600,,1550,4.347222222222222

It is carefully crafted by the same people who made the two earlier series, and gives the same sense of Oxford as a backdrop for the problem of crime-solving.  Shaun Evans does a superb job of capturing the young Morse, with his intelligence, intensity, attention to detail, and determination to figure out all the elements that don't make sense.  My only disappointment occurred because I thought this was a series, and it was actually a single movie.  I fervently hope this was the pilot for a series, because I would like to see more mysteries solved by young Morse and his mentor/teacher, DI Thursday.  The show is definitely challenging, entertaining, and worth the money.",1343260800,,756,4.875
5043447,4,B006ZL84EW,"Following the success of ""Lewis"", ITV and Masterpiece created another spin-off of the popular ""Inspector Morse"" mystery series, originally based on Colin Dexter's novels. ""Lewis"" is a sequel. ""Endeavour"" is a prequel that follows Morse in his early days on the Oxford police force, when he was a Detective Constable and still occasionally went by his first name, ""Endeavour"". The year is 1965. The Vietnam War rages in Southeast Asia. The sexual revolution is gaining speed at home. And young Morse (Shaun Evans) is contemplating retirement from the police force already, when he is assigned, along with colleague DC Ian McLeash (Jack Ashton), to do spade work for DI Fred Thursday (Roger Allam) and DS Arthur Lott (Danny Webb).

His first case is the disappearance of 15-year-old working class school girl Mary Tremlett (Rachel Heaton). Mary told her parents she was going to the cinema on Saturday afternoon and never returned. Morse finds it odd that she was in possession of several valuable first edition poetry books and that Mary always worked out the first and last clues on the Saturday crosswords published by the Oxford Mail, never the rest of the puzzle. DS Lott resents Morse's education and discourages this obscure line of inquiry. But, when the crosswords turn out to be a clue to a person Mary was secretly meeting, DI Thursday sees Morse's potential and takes the young constable under his wing in an investigation that cuts a trail through an increasing number of Mary's male acquaintances, young and old, with whom she had entanglements that could have been motive for murder.

This episode briefly recaptures the tone of the early ""Inspector Morse"" in its opening disconnected scenes. The young Morse is introverted, contemplative, and an opera fan, but he in not yet inured to the job. He's quite squeamish and doesn't drink. The narrative self-consciously leads to Oxford University, which is more characteristic of the later shows than of Colin Dexter's work, if I recall correctly. And it makes an effort to foreshadow the ""Inspector Morse"" series, wisely or not. Colin Dexter, who endorsed this series, makes a cameo appearance, and Abigail Thaw, John Thaw's daughter, has a small role. There are some discontinuities in the plot. For example, the cause of Mary's death seems to be different in different scenes. But the period aspect of the mystery, albeit with some anachronisms, creates added interest, as does the allusion to the Profumo Affair.",1343174400,2,2475,5.078624078624078

I was skeptical that the authors of the prequel would be able to pull it off, and the actor playing the young Inspector Morse (Shaun Evans) was truly convincing in the role.  We find out a lot about the young police detective in the film, and it adds a lot to learn of the backstory of the great Inspector.

I've either purchased or received as a gift the entire Inspector Morse series, and it's great to pop one in the DVD player and be transported back a dozen years.  The great John Thaw as perfect in the roll of the easily-irritated Morse, who always rides his assistant Sergeant Lewis a bit too hard.  (The follow-up series to Morse called Inspector Lewis is a worthy effort as well.  It looks as though we may now have three distinct Morse contributions to the Morse universe, though truth be told, the original one is the best, though the follow-ons are very good.

Five stars for the welcome edition to the Morse Universe.  Well worth the time to watch the film.",1341964800,3,1052,4.442708333333333
5043450,5,B006ZL84EW,"I have watched the Inspector Morse series plus read the novels. One would think that inventing a prequel featuring a young Morse at the beginning of his career would be doomed to fail since it is usually unwise to mess with a brilliant piece of work.  Not so here.  This is every bit as good as original show based on the novels.

The reason this is called ENDEAVOUR is that is Morse's first name, one which he has always hated but is oddly apt for him.

This mystery involves the murder of a teenager who was ripe beyond her years at age fifteen. Morse investigates a variety of suspects, including a high reaching prostitution ring plus a married Oxford don who was tutoring the girl. While investigating the don, he meets one of his all time heroines as the don has married one of his favorite opera stars.

There is the creation of a mentor for Morse, Detective Thursday, who is quite good as well. Morse is the better detective but he needs Thursday's mentoring and wisdom as he is in his rawest, unformed state as yet.

I have just read that after the success of this two hour standalone, a series of episodes will now be produced in the UK.  I can hardly wait!

5043451,5,B006ZL84EW,"If you are a fan of the Inspector Morse series, and mourned the passing of John Thaw at the young age of 60 who was recently voted by British viewers as #3 in the best 50 actors over the past 50 years, you will be delighted to know that the series is being revived.

John Thaw, as the older Morse, is clearly irreplaceable. His brooding, melancholy, curmudgeonly Morse captured the policeman's essence. Thaw's own life paralleled Morse's own with the loss of his mother's constant presence in his life at an early age when she left home and he didn't see her again until he was 19. The character Morse's parents divorced when he was 12, and his mother died three years later. Did this life experience help Thaw to capture the depth and underlying strain of unresolved grief in Morse? Is this why Morse constantly falls for the women in his investigations, even when they turn out to be the culprit?

But now enters the new younger Morse in this series Endeavor, which is a prequel to the iconic series. Morse's mother was Quaker which explains the origin of the name. However, the author Colin Dexter, supposedly found the name on a building in which boats were housed along the river Thames in Oxford where he liked to walk. And the names Morse and Lewis actually came from arch-rival cross-word puzzle clue writers whom Dexter knew.

Is this new endeavor worthy of the old series? I found it to be so. The younger Morse is a tad gawky, as you imagine Morse probably was in his early days, but his enjoyment of fine cars, classical music, women witnesses, crossword puzzles, literature classics, stubbornness and tenacity is already in evidence. The production values I found to be superior to the old series. The sets for example--the police station, Morse's apartment rental, and even the car repair shop were amazing. The cinematography was original with unusual flashbacks, angles of camera etc.

The actors were stand-outs: Endeavor's boss and ""the governor"" or chief of police, the car dealer, the other police supervisors, the suspects, and an old friend of Endeavor's at Oxford. It was an inspired choice to use John Thaw's daughter as a newspaper editor--you could see a bit of her father's face in hers.

The crime was appropriately complex, involving a professor at Oxford. So, even though we miss Mr. Thaw, it appears the new actor, Shaun Evans, has the potential to mature into the role of Morse. Loved the morphing of Evan's face into Thaw's face in the rear-view mirror--a dramatic touch.

Can't wait for the next episodes of this brilliant and well-done series. We hope it will continue longer than the first incarnation of Colin Dexter's great books, which is probably my favorite mystery series. You can see this first episode on the PBS website until July 31, 2012 at which time you can buy the DVD from Amazon. I hope we'll be able to stream episodes from this series from Amazon as they become available, too, like we can for SHERLOCK!",1341619200,2,2957,4.743190661478599
5043452,5,B006ZL84EW,"My husband and I viewed this film on Masterpiece Theater and were quite pleased.  The plot and cast were, in our opinion, equal to the Morse series.  It was interesting to see how the character of Morse began in the early years.  It would be wonderful if the powers that be would decide to make this a series, Morse in the early years.  We would be first in line to order such a series.",1341532800,2,386,4.175675675675675
5043453,5,B006ZL84EW,"Comparing the old Morse to Endeavour is like comparing apples to oranges. You can't, we all loved Morse but I must say this new champ is bloody good his acting is impeccable the scene with him talking about his late mother is unforgettable. Hope for many more of the young Morse.",1341360000,3,279,4.490196078431373
5043454,5,B006ZL84EW,"There is something very tender about the early life of Morse.  Colin Dexter, in his many Morse mysteries, never really explored why Morse was the deep thinking, humorless, cranky individual who liked his solitude and his music.  He appeared to reject relationships, especially close ones.  Now we see Morse in the early years and his e reference to his formative years when he thought the world was bleak.  Then he heard the magnificent voice of a beautiful soprano that changed his outlook on life.  Not only is ""Endeavor"" a five star mystery delving into the seamy side of life, but it introduces us to Detective Morse, the man we have loved through those wonderful books by Colin Dexter.  I sincerely hope this will be a series - it's about the only way we can honor Morse's memory and the outstanding acting by John Thaw.  Colin Dexter is certainly the very best mystery writer of our time.",1341273600,3,894,4.6923076923076925
5043455,5,B006ZL84EW,"If you are a dyed-in-the-wool Morse fan, you will love this.  Not only have they cast a first-class, believeable young Morse, they cast a pathologist you would swear was really a younger version of the one in the Morse series.  Would love to see these develop (another 10 or 20? - I am really a fan).  Thoroughly enjoyed this.",1341187200,19,326,4.491525423728813
5043456,5,B006ZL84EW,"I have not watched the dvd yet. I watched this show on You Tube. I thought it was great. But than I decided to watch it again on PBS. What I discovered was that they edited scenes out of it. The show on you tube was 98 minutes, the show on PBS was barely 90 minutes. If I had not watched the You Tube show first I guess I wold not of noticed. I feel cheated. I hope the dvd will be longer.",1341187200,17,389,3.6987951807228914
5043457,5,B006ZL84EW,"I watched it last night on my local PBS channel, and loved it. Being a longtime fan of the original Morse series starring John Thaw (which is sadly not available to watch on BluRay by any subscription), and Inspector Lewis, I was very excited to see this prequel. It was very well done and I commend Shaun Evans in his performance as Detective Endeavour Morse --- not an easy character to inhabit. Spoiler alert --- when the young Morse looks into the rear view mirror of the Jaguar, and John Thaw's eyes look back... well, I think he would be pleased. Thank you, Masterpiece Mystery.",1341187200,4,584,4.571428571428571
5043458,5,B006ZL84EW,"Being a huge fan of John Thaw's and ""Inspector Morse"",  I was hoping I would not be disappointed while watching ""Endeavour"".  I was determined to keep an open mind and try to enjoy this pre-quel.

I was not disappointed!  The lead actor was wonderful!  I enjoyed the references to the Future Morse and the chemistry between him and Inspector Thursday was wonderful.  I see how Thursday's style of mentoring rubbed off on Morse and how Morse was able to translate that to his style of mentoring Lewis, and Lewis to Hathaway.

This episode was SO clever  -- I didn't see it coming!  The plotting was even and all the actors were well suited to their roles.  Nice to see some familiar faces also.

BRAVO!  BRAVO!  BRAVO!  Hoping for future installments.  Well done!",1341187200,17,762,4.666666666666667
5043459,5,B006ZL84EW,"I just finished watching this video and was stunned at how wonderful it was. Having watched all of the Morse videos and being a big fan of them, I was sure I was going to find that Endeavour was ""different"" or not up to the standards set by the original videos.
Endeavour has the same complex plotting, the same haunted characters, the same flavor, the same bureaucratic conflicts with other police personnel, and even more continuations from the originals. It is apparent that they deliberately worked very hard to retain the true ambiance of the Morse videos.
The actor playing the young Morse I was prepared to not like but came away thoroughly impressed by how well he captured the character that was well-established by John Thaw. It was a hard act to follow but he did it impressively well. By the end you just knew you were watching the young Morse and it was a joy. You even see the Jaguar at the car dealer and you just know he is going to go back and buy it and drive it for the rest of his life. There are many other blendings of the old to the new that are subtle but apparent to the regular Morse watcher.
I highly recommend watching this video and hope that you find it as enjoyable as I did. I know I will re-watch it in the future as I do with the other Morse videos.
And it would be even more amazing if they made more of the Endeavour videos in the future.",1340150400,248,1374,4.268199233716475
5043460,5,B006ZL84EW,"Fans of the Inspector Morse series can be heartened.  ""Endeavour"" is the pilot for the upcoming British series that goes back in time to reveal a young Morse working on his first real police case, giving us one more opportunity to get to know one of our favorite English detectives.

  Basically it's the same folks who've given us the Morse series and later the very successful (and very well done ) Sergeant Lewis series--and no complaints.  In this pilot, sometimes a bit rough at the edges and certainly evolves into a bit of a melodramatic ending, a young Shawn Evans gives us great background--and understanding--of the inimitable Morse.  It's a good biographical study--but only enough to give us a better knowledge of what makes Morse tick.

  In this initial episode, a young (15-year-old) girl turns up missing and soon after turns up very dead.  Young Morse is assigned to the case and, well, the story goes from there, with the usual  Colin Dexterian-like twists, turns, reversals, and surprises. What is not surprising, of course, is that Morse is on the scene. We know what to expect.

  For Morse fans, it's great having him back and the screenwriters have made certain that just enough of ""the old stuff"" is included to make the episode realistic and worth watching. It provides us to better know the later, older Morse--and it's exciting to catch the allusions to the later Morse episodes.

  After this pilot, of course, the younger Morse will ""come of age"" and his character will step outside the obvious references to the older Morse and will stand on his own. Young Morse gets caught up with the crosswords, he's introduced to that red Jag, he takes his first pint, he reveals his love of opera, he comes through full of integrity, but not yet full of himself and his abilities. And he's got a great mentor, Fred Thursday, and even Colin Dexter makes his trademark cameo appearance (watch for it--it's brief!).  Barrington Pheloung, a by word with Morse episodes, is there to set the music.

  We can now look forward to the series episodes.

  The Brits certainly know how to make a mystery series.",1340064000,51,2120,4.776859504132231
5043461,3,B006ZL84EW,"I bought this from Amazon.co.uk (region 2) because it was cheaper (less than $12, shipping included).  The focus is on young Morse; as a result the other characters and the plot are not fully developed.  The whole thing is sketchy and you are left to work out the details for yourself.  Also, the movie lasts only 98 minutes, not 120 as listed on Amazon.com. Interesting because of Morse, but I would not buy more of the same.",1339200000,15,426,4.5064935064935066
