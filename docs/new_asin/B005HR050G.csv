4702999,5,B005HR050G,"It is absolute entertainment to watch this good looking Russian tenor, a 34-year-old international star, Nikolai Baskov. This legendary concert performance takes place at Moscow's Hall of the Luzhniki Arena. Baskov is accompanied by a full orchestra and plays to an enthusiastic crowd of nearly 10,000 people. Taped with 24 HD cameras, this is Russia's most elaborate and expensive performance ever recorded for international television. He performs classic pieces from ""Tosca"", ""La Boheme"", ""Werther"", ""Turandot"" and other favorites such as ""Be My Love"", ""Granada"" and ""Back to Sorrento"". Baskov is joined by world-renowned soprano, Caballe Montserrat, and her daughter Marti, for several rousing duets. Considered Russia's most popular tenor, Nicolai Baskov has been charming audiences throughout Europe and is planning his first American tour in early 2012.",1320192000,4,860,5.7795275590551185
8473488,5,B005HR050G,"Very impressed by this Russian tenor. Amazing voice and acting skills. He sings ALL kind of music from operas
to club dancing. Great personality. No need to understand Russian language to admire this amazing singer. He
dresses as a dandy.",1474675200,,238,4.975
8473489,1,B005HR050G,"His voice is fantastic. The quality of the DVD is extremely poor, grainy, and the sound quality lacks. Don't waste your money.",1430784000,,126,4.7727272727272725
8473490,1,B005HR050G,"If this were popular music he'd be Lounge Lizard..  This is a live performance, from the old Arthur Godfrey Show?  The first seven songs are all sung at the top of his lungs.  By the eighth you get an insight as to what he might sound like with a decent arranger and less bombastic over orchestration and that infernal ""Heavenly Choir"", but by the ninth cut ( One of the worst renditions of an Andrew Lloyd Weber song I've ever endured ) my wife marched across the room and shut the stereo off.  ""Put them out of their misery"" she quipped.  I couldn't agree more.",1415750400,,563,4.3238095238095235
8473491,4,B005HR050G,This is Russia's answer to Russell Watson.  A Watson he's not but it's still a good performance.  What a shame that the producers felt it necessary to detract from the performance with excessive ridiculous light effects.,1413676800,,220,5.083333333333333
8473492,5,B005HR050G,Wonderful concert by a fine tenor!  He sings music that we all love.  Staging is awesome.  Well worth watching again and again!,1370908800,,127,4.681818181818182
8473493,5,B005HR050G,I was pleasantly surprised by this dvd. nikolai baskov is a great tenor . I would recomend this DVD to anybody who like crossover tenors.,1361318400,,137,4.52
8473494,5,B005HR050G,This is a wonderful DVD for a person who loves and enjoys music. The person I bought this for thoroughly enjoyed.,1360108800,,113,4.428571428571429
8473495,5,B005HR050G,"I taped this recording when it was aired on PBS and unfortunately my DVR had to be replaced and I lost it.  I lost other things that I had recorded as well but nothing as precious as this one so I ordered it from Amazon and just love having it without fear of losing it again.  I love opera, especially tenors and he has a great voice as well as presence.  I miss Pavarotti and haven't heard a great voice until Nicolai Baskov.  Everything about ""Romantic Journey"" is awsome; the voice, the setting and the selections.",1359417600,,518,4.364583333333333
8473496,5,B005HR050G,This dvd is truely the best I've ever watched. It is better everytime I watch it. Fantom of The Opera puts most enterment to shame. I can't say evough about the talent and back ground. It is stunning.,1357862400,,200,4.2894736842105265
