8361821,1,B000LPRPJI,"It's extraordinary how this video returns to critics with manifestly no idea why people like the band and this music. If you don't like Oasis and desperately need to hear random and unspecified people sneering and snarking at this and every other album they've done, this might be for you. And 'slowly walking down the hall, faster than a cannonball'? Think of a Michael Bay version of Raiders of the Lost Ark, compressed into an audacious image of badassery. Anything can be torn apart by wilfully mocking it. It's a lot safer, and a lot more cowardly, than enthusiasm.

I did get a lot of laughs out of this video, but I was laughing in disbelief. I'm not even the biggest Oasis fan, but this is completely ludicrous. Needs a good MSTing.",1495756800,,740,4.606060606060606
8361822,1,B000LPRPJI,"Started off as a pretty good review and turned into a bash oasis review....  It was a good source for background on the CD, but the opinions from a few of the reviewers seemed to me like they missed the point...  They're not food-critics but reviewing a album with songs on it... there is a big difference...",1347062400,,308,4.385964912280702
8361823,1,B000LPRPJI,I should of taken note of the previous reviewer. This DVD is terrible. Mostly it's just interviews with a couple of music critics who even begin to laugh and poke fun at Noel's lyrics. This DVD was so bad that we(my brother and I) couldn't stand to even watch the whole thing!!! If you like Oasis do not waste your money!,1220400000,4,321,4.278688524590164
