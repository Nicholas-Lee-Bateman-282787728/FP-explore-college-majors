7803655,5,6300181766,"The wonderful Children's Theatre of Minneapolis scores another HUGE hit with this truly delightful original musical adaptation of L. Frank Baum's second Oz Book, THE MARVELOUS LAND OF OZ. An absolute delight, and extremely faithful to the book. Scenic design, costumes and make up are terrific, and the cast is exceptional. The only quibble I might have is that, although the score is not up to par with the better Broadway scores, it serves the play well. Also, Ozma is a bit wooden and seems uncomfortable; perhaps a different young actress could have portrayed her, rather than the same child who portrays Tip. But overall, these are extremely minor flaws, in my opinion. This is a must-see and a must-have for any OZ fan and/or collector, and vastly superior to any other OZ sequel ever produced, including Disney's 1980's RETURN TO OZ and the current Broadway musical WICKED. This production should be broadcast on network television; it could very well serve as an impetus for an OZ revival and stir up interest in the rest of the wonderful OZ stories.",1107475200,10,1058,4.883333333333334
