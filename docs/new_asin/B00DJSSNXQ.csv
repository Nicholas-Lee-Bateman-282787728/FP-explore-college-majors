8593829,5,B00DJSSNXQ,"Don't miss this 3+ hours of unique personal stories from wildlife professionals who have dedicated their lives to the Black Bears of the South, overlaid with plenty of wonderful bear video by Kate and Al!  As a follow-on to their multi-award-winning Season of the Bear Volumes 1, 2 and 3, Kate Marshall Graphics has created a three-DVD set that was well worth the wait.  Starting with a video and photographic overview of all the Black Bear sub-species in North America, Bear 4 then takes us on a state by state tour of the South where wildlife professionals tell their stories ranging from the history of Black Bears in their states, to trials and tribulations of bear and human interaction, while all touching on common themes of educating the public about Black Bears, and the importance of keeping wild bears and human food sources separated.

From Maria Davidson, who runs her state's program to re-establish the endangered Louisiana Black Bear, to David Whitehead of Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, who is working on his state's new master bear management plan, to Bill Stiver, who as Chief Wildlife Biologist in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park has the herculean task of balancing the desire of millions of Park visitors wanting to see a Black Bear with the safety of both bears and visitors, to Lisa Stewart of Black Bear Solar Institute, who has been sole caretaker of 133 orphaned and injured Black Bear cubs raised and successfully released back into their wild homes in seven Southern States and the National Park, all have riveting stories and unique Black Bear insights to share with us.

The ""Extras"" at the end of Disc 3 delve into personal insights with many of the wildlife professionals interviewed, such as what steered them into their careers working with wildlife and what keeps them interested in going to work with Black Bears each day.  Hint:  Marlon Perkins and ""Hold that Python, Jim"" gets mentioned more than once...

Season of the Bear 4 builds on the Kate Marshall Graphics reputation of amazing wildlife video, and adds the element of more fully developed stories of the people who love and work with Black Bears daily in the South.  Kate and Al strike the balance perfectly.  If you love Black Bears, you will love Season of the Bear 4!",1375574400,2,2280,4.870801033591731
