6108775,2,B00GSTHDHK,"This is a completely different presentation than we usually get from WWE with this project as it wasn't based on specific superstars or matches but more of a behind the scenes view of how certain themes were put together with WWE music composer Jim Johnson commenting on each of the 25 themes highlighted along with playing on a guitar or piano the original notes to the song while also seeing footage of certain celebrities involved recording the tracks such as Lil Kim with each theme getting 1-2 minutes to discuss plus seeing the lyrics for each song.  You also hear additional comments from rock groups Rev Theory & Breaking Point & P.O.D. & Josey Scott of Saliva, Batista, Fandango, Sunny, Primetime Players, Goldust, Cameron & Naomi, Mick Foley, Christian, Edge, Randy Orton, Dusty Rhodes, Rob Van Dam, Mr. McMahon, Trish Status, Rey Mysterio, Steve Austin, The Rock, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, John Cena, Chris Jericho, and the New Age Outlaws.

This was a nice behind the scenes presentation on a very important but often overlooked element of a superstars' presentation telling the story of how the concepts of the themes come together & even talking about how the themes evolved with the superstars themselves such as Triple H & The Rock plus the impact the themes have had from The Brood in the NHL or ""Fandangoing"" with the big negatives the selection of some themes are real questionable (Primetime Players?) & could have covered some of the more older themes (I would have marked out for Demolition) along with how there was no mention or footage of Naughty By Nature when discussing Shane McMahon's theme when they showed the footage of them recording the song during his titantron.  In the end, it was a nice one hour presentation but wasn't one that I would watch more than once as this would be been better to have as a presentation on their network than a DVD release even if it's a low priced one so I would recommend this for a stream or to view later on their network but I wouldn't purchase it as it has no replay value to me.",1396137600,4,3201,4.2
6108776,3,B00GSTHDHK,Doesn't include full videos like I thought but for what the price is its still decent. I wouldn't pay for then 10,1395964800,,113,4.181818181818182
6108777,2,B00GSTHDHK,"This is a horrid dvd that had lots of potential, this will be selling for under 5 dollars for sure in a few months.

Too many omissions from the pre-attitude era IMHO, and where is ""Teal American"" on this list?  That's the theme song we heard at the end of every WWF/E pay per view from 1986-1992.  Oh, thats right, Vince and pals most likely don't want to pay Rick Derringer any royalties/money to be on this.  We rather hear Jim Johnston ramble on about how great he is at everything.

Too many attitude and post 2000 themes on this list done by the generic rock band of the week.  I understand they needed variation, but only 3 songs are on here from the pre new-generation era and I believe 2 are on here from the new generation era.  The rest are all post 96'.

The main documentary runs for about an hour and there is a few bonus features.  For some reason, they had a special feature about Steven Regal's horrible ""He's a Man"" gimmick that lasted a few weeks.  This must have been put on here for a joke.  We also get treated to Jim Johnston sucking up to his boss telling us how great WWE studios is in one special feature.

DONT BUY THIS, wait until its under 5$ at least.",1395878400,,1181,4.223214285714286
6108778,3,B00GSTHDHK,"First I want to thank Jim for his creation of many of my favorite WWF & WWE theme songs of all time but now I understand why he is a behind the scene type of guy, frankly I feel his vibe is very snide and un passionate on this dvd like almost he didn't want to do it . The superstars and bands who comment have great intensity and interest in there songs but Jim is more just simplistic in his feelings on the tunes but maybe that's just how he is in real life so I can't be too upset. As for the dvd it's short, kinda dull and leaves many questions unanswered for years of wanting to know the stories behind some of the greatest music in wrestling. It's worth the $6 but will keep you wishing for more.",1395273600,,703,3.99290780141844
6108779,3,B00GSTHDHK,"This video is a 50-minute documentary (not including the extras) that covers 25 of the greatest theme songs of WWE. We do get interview clips from various WWE Superstars and even some bands that helped make the music, but this DVD is mostly Jim Johnston and rightfully so. He is the music genius of WWE and this is his DVD. Not a bad video to put on every once in a while just for fun, but considering how short it is I say try to get it for cheap.",1395100800,11,448,4.044943820224719

8627020,4,B00GSTHDHK,This DVD was very entertaining. It would have been better though if they had played the entire song for each Wrestler instead of just parts pf the themes. Well worth the money though.,1439424000,,183,4.575757575757576
8627021,4,B00GSTHDHK,Short dvd (Maybe 1 hr) with good interview with WWE music director and composer Jim Johnston.,1438819200,,93,4.875

It was cool and anybody who likes and/or knows wwe themes you will like and enjoy this dvd. Theres only a couple things about it that kinda suck... Entrances like

Kane
The Hardy boyz
Lita

I feel they could have replaced sunnys and the primetime players with others ie kane, the hardys. I think they have enough to do a volume 2 that wasn't included on this disc. Hopefully they produce one.",1420934400,,546,4.29126213592233
8627025,3,B00GSTHDHK,"Meh, was worth a one-time watch. But regret buying it. Probably won't watch again.  Some interesting stories behind the theme music for the wrestlers, but kind of hokie at the same time. But if you're a die hard wrestling fan, get it lol",1419638400,,237,4.511627906976744

8627027,1,B00GSTHDHK,"I saw this DVD at Best Buy and decided to buy it blindly without researching it. I figured ""Hey it's only $10 and 'Real American' is worth the price of admission alone!"" Only ""Real American"" is not included in the top 25 themes of all time, even though it was rated #1 all time by WWE.com several years ago. That's just the beginning though. Many other classic theme's you'd expect to see are not on here as well. They do 2-3 minute segments on each song that lasts a little over an hour, and it's over. This has to be one of their worst releases ever. Now I know why this DVD was barely promoted and I didn't know to pick it up long before I seen it on that unfortunate day. It sucks and you should avoid this one at all costs.",1402531200,2,728,4.0979020979020975
8627028,3,B00GSTHDHK,As a fan of Jim Johnston's work im always curious of the backstory of his work. all the music featured in this DVD is just a 3 minute edited behind the music stuff,1397865600,,163,3.9696969696969697
