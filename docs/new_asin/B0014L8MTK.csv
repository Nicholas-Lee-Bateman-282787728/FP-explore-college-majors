8255999,3,B0014L8MTK,"This series has two-part arcs and twists and turns in addition to the style of the older series - it's the best of both worlds. Also, the actor is the legendary Hiroshi Miyauchi, and if you've seen any of his series, you won't want to miss any of the others. This is my favorite so far of the pre-revival KR series that I've seen.

However, the price *is* rather extreme. (I didn't see it through them.) Having seen it, is it worth $160-ish? Guess it depends on how die-hard a Kamen Rider fan you are, and how much money you have to spend on a 52-episode half-hour TV show.",1336003200,3,573,4.256880733944954
8256000,5,B0014L8MTK,"Growing up in Hawaii during the 70's, we were privileged to see the majority of the Henshin Heroes programs of that time, starting with the original Kamen Rider series to Lion Maaru, Kikaida & Kikaida 01, Rainbow Man, Inazuman, Super Barom-1, Robot Detective, Gorangers etc...of all these shows, Kamen Rider V3 is one of the greatest ""henshin"" programs. Unlike other henshin shows of it's time period (especially Kikaida) which were aimed at the 8-14 year old audience, the Kamen Rider series decided to create their new show as if it were an adult program. No comical sidekicks too relieve the tension. The story lines are much darker and full of great action and suspense. Miyauchi Hiroshi(Kazami Shiro) is incredible as he does all his own stunts which adds to the feel of danger for Kamen Rider V3. The Destron monsters are wonderfully creepy and you feel relieved when Kamen Rider V3 defeats them. The music is great with one of the best theme songs in the history of tokusatsu tv programs. BCI is bringing out all the ""GIANT ROBOT MONSTERS"" on fake sets type of shows like the great Ultraman series and I can only hope for more Henshin programs in the future. To find out more about Kamen Rider V3, visit either the Kamen Rider V3 homepage or the Generation Kikaida websites. HENSHIN.....V3!!!",1208563200,10,1299,4.803571428571429
