8662941,5,B00KZWTTMI,"I recommend this seller as he is always accommodating and friendly when I requested for this dvd set. The shipments come in ahead of the scheduled arrival date and it's always in perfect condition!

This dvd showcases Chichay finding out about Joaquin's precarious condition (bullet in the head) and now understands why his mother is overprotective. This volume also shows the admission of feelings between Chichay and Joaquin...the scenes are dramatic, but with a light heartedness that makes you want to keep watching the series over and over.",1405728000,,545,5.193181818181818
